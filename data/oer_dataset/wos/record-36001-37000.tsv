The existence of many surface- and edge-exposed active sites as well as tunable chemical composition with large concentration of redoxable component ions renders 2D inorganic nanosheets as promising electrocatalysts for diverse electrochemical reactions. Additionally, highly anisotropic 2D inorganic nanosheet with high surface-to-volume ratio can be used as efficient hybridization matrix to optimize the electrocatalyst performance of nanostructured material via strong interfacial interaction and synergistic coupling between hybridized species. For the electrocatalyst application, 2D inorganic nanosheets can play crucial roles as main active components, substrates, additives, and hybrid building blocks in hybrid-type electrocatalysts. In this review, unique advantages of 2D inorganic nanosheets in the design and synthesis of electrocatalysts are discussed with in-depth discussion about their critical roles in 2D nanosheet-based electrocatalysts. Depending on target electrocatalysis reactions, diverse examples of 2D inorganic nanosheet-based electrocatalysts are surveyed along with their versatile characterization techniques. Future research perspectives for the exploration of 2D inorganic nanosheet-based electrocatalysts are presented to provide valuable insights for the development of high-performance electrocatalysts applicable for emerging fields of renewable energy technologies.

In this work, insitu growing thickness-controlled polymer nanolayer on TiO2 nanorods electrode by a facile solvothermal reaction optimizes surface states conditions via mitigating oxygen vacancy induced hole trapping agents, while polymer nanolayer creates abundant active surface states that efficiently extract holes for photooxidation reaction. For modified photoelectrodes, 8 times improvement in interfacial charge transfer/recombination ratio (K-t/K-r) at a low applied bias contributes to a low onset potential (0.2 V vs. RHE) for photooxidation and shows 12 times improvement in photocurrent density at 0.4 V vs. RHE under simulated sunlight irradiation (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm(-2)) than that of r-TiO2, which contributes to the superior performance of a photochemical-assisted rechargeable Zn-air battery (PZAB). Equipping such a photoelectrode can photo-charge the battery at 10 mA cm(-2) with a record-low potential of 0.8 V, saving 76.5% electrical energy. The electrode shows excellent stability for a 10-h cycling test. This work provides scientific thoughts and synthetic strategies for a highly efficient solarrechargeable electric energy storage system and expands the scope of application for conjugated polymers.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000794925400001

However, the efficiency and long-term durability are still inevitably limited by the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in air electrode. Herein, we fabricated a planar all-solid-state rechargeable ZAB with excellent scalability by integrating atomically dispersed FeNx anchored on nitrogen-sulfur dual-doped porous carbon spheres and a highly conductive poly (acryl-amide-co-acrylic acid) solid polymer alkaline electrolyte. Owing to the introduction of sulfur in carbon substrate, the catalyst exhibits superior ORR performance over 20% commercial Pt/C. Specially, it also displays outstanding all-solid-state ZAB capacity with a maximum power density of 85.5 mW/cm(2), as well as ultralong cycle life for more than 40 h, which outperforms that of most conventional polyvinyl alcohol alkaline gel electrolyte-based flexible quasi-solid-state or all-solid-state ZAB. Density functional theory results reveal that the dopants N and S play a synergetic interplay in modulating the electronic structure of atomically dispersed FeNx species and provide a fast electron transfer path for ORR.

Anodic titanium dioxide nanotube (TNT) as the electrode has shown promising for its flexibility, economy and efficiency. Herein, a highly active and stable photocathode for HER was achieved with a technique of stepwise cathodic reduction of anodic TNT without loading any cocatalyst. It exhibits a self-improving PECWS performance after the five-step cathodic reduction process. The onset voltage displays an anodic shift from-0.79 to 0.19 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and the overall current shows an enhancement from-110.06 to-210.66 mA at-1.0 V-RHE in 1 M NaOH aqueous solution (pH = 13.6). The photocathode also withstands a voltage @-1.0 V-RHE and a current @-100 mA in the WS cell for more than 12,000 s sequentially. This work demonstrates a feasible strategy for forming a multijunction composite for efficient HER with the anodic TNT as the precursor.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000779933000002

Herein, NiMn-LDH was in situ incorporated with carbon black (CB) via a facile hydrothermal method, and the morphology of the LDHs tended to be small-sized flaky-like from large bulk flower-like with the increasing amount of CB. The fabricated 50CB/NiMn-LDH cathode tended to induce the poorly crystalline film-like Li2O2 to form, indicating the significant effect of NiMn-LDH flake on the surface redox reaction. The lithium-oxygen (Li-O-2) battery with 50CB/NiMn-LDH cathode exhibited improved capacity output (5684 vs 2682mAhg(-1)), low overpotential (1.49 vs 1.62V), and stable cyclability (35th vs 15th). The present synthetic strategy is very simple and low cost and can be easily extended to other LDH-based materials with significant effect.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000463866900007

The designed NiCo0.5Oy/NaCl catalyst exhibits the optimal performance with approximate to 100% EA conversion, 88.1% H-2 selectivity and high stability during autothermal reforming at 650 degrees C and achieves a very high H-2 selectivity of 96.3% at 600 degrees C by accelerating the water-gas shifting reaction (the rate-determining step). The multiple (NixCo1-x)(NiyCo2-y)O-4 inverse spinel structures play significant roles in the enhanced catalytic performance. Benefiting from the unique advantages of (i) stable inverse spinel structures, (ii) abundant domains and defects, (iii) abnormal Ni2+/Ni3+ (0.36) and Co2+/Co3+ (3.03) ratios, and (iv) rich redox ability, the catalyst possesses high adsorption capacity towards EA and H2O, abundant active sites and fast electron exchange ability between the reactants and the catalyst. Consequently, the catalyst exhibits a highly efficient and robust hydrocarbon fuel reforming performance. These findings will lead to the development of novel catalysts based on inverse spinels for hydrogen production applications.									13	1	0	0	2	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000459724300032

Herein, Mo2C micropillars decorated with Pt nanoparticles (< 4 nm) on Mo foil (Pt/Mo2C-L/Mo) are synthesized by laser ablation in a focused mode in CH4 atmosphere and laser-induced reduction in an under-focused mode in Ar/H-2 atmosphere. The Pt/Mo2C-L/Mo possesses excellent HER performance (21 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and stability (1317 mA cm(-2) for 100 h) in acid media. Integrated gas diffusion and catalytic electrodes of Pt/Mo2C-L/Mo are constructed by laser in a mixed model and used in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). The voltage of the constructed PEMWE of (-) Pt/Mo2C-L/Mo || IrO2/Ti (+) (1.55 V at 10 mA cm-2) is lower than that of (-) 20 wt. % Pt/C || IrO2 (+) (1.69 V at 10 mA cm-2) for overall water splitting.

Herein, metal-nitrogen sites (M-N-x, M = Ni and Cu) are success-fully implanted into zeolitic imidazolate zinc framework (ZIF-8)-derived nitrogen-doped porous carbon (ZIF/NC) to prepare Ni-ZIF/NC and Cu-ZIF/NC electrocatalysts for the HER. These M-Nx active sites significantly enhanced the electrocatalytic activities of Ni-ZIF/NC and Cu-ZIF/NC. Metal Ni acted as a catalyst for catalysis of Ni-ZIF/NC to form carbon nanotubes-like structures, which provided convenient ion transmis-sion pathways. Owing to its special morphology and an increased number of defects, Ni-ZIF/NC displayed superior electrocatalytic activity in the HER compared to those of Cu-ZIF/NC and ZIF/NC. In an alkaline environment, Ni-ZIF/NC exhibited an overpotential at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(10)) of 163.0 mV and Tafel slope of 85.0 mV dec(-1), demonstrating an electrocatalytic property equivalent to that of Pt/C. In an acidic environment, Ni-ZIF/NC yielded a tr10 of 177.4 mV and Tafel slope of 83.9 mV dec(-1), which were comparable to those of 20 wt.% Pt/C. Moreover, Ni-ZIF/NC and Cu-ZIF/NC also exhibited superior stabilities in alkaline environments. This work offers a valuable strategy for controlling the morphology and implanting M-Nx active sites into carbon for designing novel catalysts for use in alternative new energy applications.

In this work, Co@CoO/NG was obtained via calcinating ZIF-67 and in-situ preparation process, which exhibited excellent performance (water oxidation AQE 10.22% at lambda = 450 nm and oxygen production rate 543198 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) and hydrogen production rate 330 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)). A comprehensive analysis of SEM, XRD, TEM, UV-vis, EIS, and PL showed that Co@CoO/NG-7 prepared has a perfect skeleton and more crystal defects, which can provide more reactive sites. The core-shell structure Co@CoO has a synergistic effect with graphene, which is beneficial to the light absorption, separation of photo-generated charges.

Here we report a facile bottom up synthesis of high surface area and porous gold aerogel supported on carbon nitride sheets (CNx). The reduction of HAuCl4 in the presence of carbon nitride nanosheets using sodium borohydride and ultrasonic treatment produces gold aerogel supported on carbon nitride (Au-aerogel-CNx). When the reduction of HAuCl4 in the presence of CNx nanosheets was performed using only ultrasonication, highly dispersed ultrasmall (similar to 2 nm) gold nanoparticles on CNx sheets (AuNPs-CNx) were formed. The Au aerogel supported on CNx sheets was well characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, tunneling electron microscopy, selected area electron diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, UV-visible and X-rayphotoelectron spectroscopic methods. The Au-aerogel-CNx and AuNPs-CNx composites exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline and acidic media. The Au-aerogel-CNx composite showed ORR onset potentials at 0.92 V and 0.43 V (vs. RHE) in 0.5 M KOH and H2SO4 solution. The four electron oxygen reduction process occurred at these supported catalysts in both alkaline and acidic media. In alkaline (KOH) medium the onset potential at Au-aerogel-CNx was more positive (similar to 30 mV) than that of commercial Pt/C catalyst. The composites displayed excellent methanol tolerance and comparable durability with commercial Pt/C. Furthermore, the Au-aerogel-CNx composites exhibited high catalytic activity for the hydrogen reduction reaction (HER) with a small onset potential of -30 mV and a Tafel slope of 53 mV dec(-1) in acidic medium. At a small Au loading of 0.130 mg cm(-2), this catalyst also exhibits a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of -185 mV with excellent stability. The ORR and HER performances on porous Au-aerogel-CNx composites were better than those of the AuNPs-CNx catalyst and commercial flat gold electrode. The superior ORR and HER activities at the Au-aerogel-CNx composite originated from the unique synergistic effects between the porous Au network and carbon nitride (CNx) support.									46	2	0	0	0	0	48			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000365216000006

The thermal behaviour of PAN/lignin fiber (PL fiber) stabilized were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry(DSC) under nitrogen atmosphere. The cyclization kinetics parameters such as activation energy(E-a), rate constant(k), pre-exponential factor(A) and extent of oxidation reaction (EOR) at different temperature were calculated from Kissinger and Ozawa method. FTIR analysis was used to investigate the structural changes and calculate the cyclization index and dehydrogenation index of stabilized PL fiber. The cyclization index values for the temperature of stabilization from 235 degrees C to 265 degrees C varied from 40 to 85%. The variation in density, elemental composition and mechanical properties of PL fiber stabilized at different temperature was determined. The density of the stabilized fiber varied from 1.225 to 1.385 g/cc as the stabilization temperature increased from 235 to 265 degrees C. The mechanism of thermal stabilization of and a set of temperature profile for a complete stabilization of PL fiber has been deduced from the various characterization.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1022-9760	1572-8935		WOS:000857083300001

In this study, we demonstrate the optimized mild reduction of graphene oxide towards the synthesis of highly active and stable cobalt-graphene electrocatalysts for water oxidation. Contrary to the conventional use of fully reduced graphene oxide (RGO) as a composite material in electrocatalysis, our results suggest that the oxygen functional groups, which are retained during mild GO reduction, are crucial in the formation of cobalt oxalate (CoC2O4) microstructures. Gently reduced graphene oxide (gRGO) with a low degree of reduction results in CoC2O4/gRGO microrods with impressive water oxidation activity, reaching current densities 21.1% higher than conventional iridium oxide-based catalysts and 70.5% more than the unoptimized CoC2O4/gRGO catalysts. Mild reduction of GO favors the homogeneous formation of microstructures via the negatively-charged functional groups, which attract the positive Co ions and lead to a stronger chemical interaction between the two components. This work points towards investigating and reevaluating the role of the degree of GO reduction on graphene's contribution to the composition and catalytic activity of metal-graphene composites.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2046-2069			WOS:000359136500005

The present study investigates the atomic-scale mechanism of the cathode side of the corrosion reaction using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Despite the central role of the reaction, neither the site of reaction nor the active species has been previously established. Here we compare the cathodic reaction leading to H-2-evolution on pure copper and on chalcocite (Cu2S) surfaces. The considered H-donors are OH-/H2O and HS-/H2S which are all available at the neutral to alkaline conditions anticipated at the SNF disposal sites. Assuming Volmer-Tafel-Heyrovsky kinetics, we find that the cathodic reactions are many orders of magnitude faster on copper compared to copper sulfide. Although we find that HS-/H2S have lower reaction barriers than H2O, our kinetic analysis suggest that H2O is expected to be the main H-source for the cathodic reaction under SNF repository conditions as results of the low sulfide concentrations (less than or similar to 10 mu M) expected in SNF repositories in Sweden, Finland and Canada.

The Gaseous Detector with Germanium Tagging was used to measure 31Cl ??-delayed proton decay through the key J?? = 3/2+, 260-keV resonance. The intensity I260 ???0.9 ?? 10???6 represents the weakest ??-delayed, charged-particle emission ever measured below 400 keV, resulting in a proton branching ratio of ??p/?? = 2.5+0.4 model calculations for ???? and past work on other resonances, the total 30P(p, ?? )31S rate has been determined with reduced uncertainty. The new rate has been used in hydrodynamic simulations to model the composition of nova ejecta, leading to a concrete prediction of 30Si:28Si excesses in presolar nova grains and the calibration of nuclear thermometers.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0031-9007	1079-7114		WOS:000800497600001	35594108

The resulting materials exhibited similar Pt nanoparticles sizes, but different agglomeration rates. The electrocatalysts were tested toward the oxygen reduction reaction, and their stability was investigated in simulated load cycling (0.6 < E < 1.0 V vs. RHE) or start-up/shutdown (1.0 < E < 1.5 V vs. RHE) protocols. Irrespective the support material, the former protocol caused Pt nanocrystallites dissolution/redeposition via Ostwald ripening, mildly decreasing the electrochemically-active surface area and ORR activity. In contrast, the carbon supports were strongly corroded after the start-up/shutdown protocol, resulting in pronounced detachment/agglomeration of Pt nanocrystallites, albeit in absence of significant particle-size growth. Fluorination had different effects on the stability of structurally-ordered and structurally-disordered carbons: beneficial effects were observed for the latter whereas the former was affected negatively. "Free" dangling groups present in structurally-disordered carbon, known to be prone to preferential oxidation in PEMFC environment, combine with the fluorine precursors upon fluorination, leading to formation of more robust C-F bonds versus oxidation than original C-O bonds. In contrast, fluorination of structurally-ordered carbon creates structural disorder (C-C bonds are broken), leading to promotion of electrochemical corrosion. (C) The Author(s) 2018.

Redox signalling, based on cascades of oxidation-reduction reactions, is an evolutionarily ancient mechanism that uses ROS to regulate an array of vital cellular processes. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide anion (O-2(center dot-)) are employed as signalling molecules that alter the oxidation state of atoms, inhibiting or activating gene activity. Here, we conduct metazoan-wide comparative genomic assessments of the two enzyme families, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and NADPH oxidases (NOX), that generate H2O2 and/or O-2(center dot-) in animals.Results: Using the genomes of 19 metazoan species representing 10 phyla, we expand significantly on previous surveys of these two ancient enzyme families. We find that the diversity and distribution of both the SOD and NOX enzyme families comprise some conserved members but also vary considerably across phyletic animal lineages. For example, there is substantial NOX gene loss in the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi and divergent SOD isoforms in the bilaterians D. melanogaster and C. elegans. We focus particularly on the sponges (phylum Porifera), a sister group to all other metazoans, from which these enzymes have not previously been described. Within Porifera, we find a unique calcium-regulated NOX, the widespread radiation of an atypical member of CuZnSOD named Rsod, and a novel endoplasmic reticulum MnSOD that is prevalent across aquatic metazoans.Conclusions: Considering the precise, spatiotemporal specificity of redox signalling, our findings highlight the value of expanding redox research across a greater diversity of organisms to better understand the functional roles of these ancient enzymes within a universally important signalling mechanism.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1741-7007		WOS:000861920000002	36175868

The synthesis procedure determines morphology, composition, and consequently, the photo(electro)chemical performance. W-BiVO4 was produced through a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method, using ethanol (EtOH) or ethylene glycol (EG) as solvents, resulting in the materials W-BiVO4(EtOH) and (BiVO4(EG), respectively. WO3 films were grown onto a conductor substrate under microwave-assisted hydrothermal conditions. W-BiVO4/WO3 was prepared through drop-casting and applied as photoanodes for OER. Morphology, crystalline structure, chemical composition, and band gap energy were evaluated. Also, the electrochemical behavior and interfacial properties were investigated via surface interrogation (SI-SECM). It has been observed that the photoelectroactivity of W-BiVO4(EG)/WO3 is 16 times higher than W-BiVO4(EtOH)/WO3 due to its favorable band edge alignment toward OER. SI-SECM showed that W-BiVO4(EtOH)/WO3 exhibited a surface coverage of reactive oxygen species four times higher than W-BiVO4(EG)/WO3. The contrasting reactivity was ascribed to differences in morphology and crystalline structure of W-BiVO4.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000841558400001

Herein, a novel strategy is demonstrated for the rational design of hierarchical iron cobalt molybdenum sulfide nanoflower encapsulated in nitrogen doped graphene (FeCoMoS@NG) through a facile, cost-effective, and single-step in-situ hydrothermal process. Owing to its hierarchical nanostructures, larger specific surface area, and exclusive porous networks, the optimal FeCoMoS@NG shows excellent catalytic activities for OER eta 10 = 238 mV, HER eta 10 = 137 mV, and ORR (0.83 V vs RHE). Most significantly, PeCoMoS@NG parallel to FeCoMoS@NG water splitting device achieves a cell voltage of 1.58 V at 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, FeCoMoS@NG based zinc-air battery endows a high power density of 118 mW cm(-2), and overall water splitting was successfully driven by FeCoMoS@NG based zinc-air battery. This work provides new pathway for designing highly active and durable multifunctional catalysts for energy conversion and storage applications.									97	0	0	0	6	0	97			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000566452900010

Modeling the performance of an integrated photoelectrolysis system with 10times solar concentrators								Journal of the Electrochemical Society				161	10			F1101	10		10.1149/2.0751410jes				2014	2014	Two designs for an integrated photoelectrolysis system that uses a 10times concentrating solar collector have been investigated in detail. The system performance was evaluated using a multi-physics model that accounted for the properties of the tandem photoabsorbers, mass transport, and the electrocatalytic performance of the oxygen-evolution and hydrogen-evolution reactions (OER and HER, respectively). The solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiencies and the ohmic losses associated with proton transport in the solution electrolyte and through the membrane of the photoelectrolysis system were evaluated systematically as a function of the cell dimensions, the operating temperatures, the bandgap combinations of the tandem cell, and the performance of both the photoabsorbers and electrocatalysts. Relative to designs of optimized systems that would operate without a solar concentrator, the optimized 10times solar concentrator designs possessed larger ohmic losses and exhibited less uniformity in the distribution of the current density along the width of the photoelectrode. To minimize resistive losses while maximizing the solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency, etaSTH, both of the designs, a two-dimensional ldquotroughrdquo design and a three-dimensional ldquobubble wraprdquo design, required that the electrode width or diameter, respectively, was no larger than a few millimeters. As the size of the electrodes increased beyond this limiting dimension, the etaSTH became more sensitive to the performance of the photoabsorbers and catalysts. At a fixed electrode dimension, increases in the operating temperature reduced the efficiency of cells with smaller electrodes, due to degradation in the performance of the photoabsorber with increasing temperature. In contrast, cells with larger electrode dimensions showed increases in efficiency as the temperature increased, due to increases in the rates of electrocatalysis and due to enhanced mass transport. The simulations indicted that cells that contained 10% photoabsorber area, and minimal amounts of Nafion or other permselective membranes (i.e. areal coverages and volumetric fractions of only a few percent of the cell), with the remaining area comprised of a suitable, low-cost inert, non porous material (flexible polymers, inert inorganic materials, etc.) should be able to produce high values of etaSTH, with etaSTH = 29.8% for an optimized design with a bandgap combination of 1.6 eV/0.9 eV in a tandem photoabsorber system at 350 K.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651			INSPEC:15494567

Cobalt-based oxides have been considered as ideal HER electrocatalysts and have been intensively studied; however, their catalytic activity is still unsatisfactory. The modulation of electrical conductivity, which limits the catalytic activity of the transition metal cobalt-based oxides, is an effective way to improve the electron transfer efficiency, mass transfer and kinetic process of the HER. Herein, an ultrathin carbon layer coated cobalt(ii) oxide nanosheet array grown in situ on carbon cloth was synthesized by a simple two-step method for efficient HER. The obtained interconnected C@CoO nanosheet array possesses lower overpotentials and smaller Tafel slopes than those of bare CoO and shows excellent stability in 20 h long-term stability tests. The ultrathin carbon coated structure provides CoO with enhanced electron transfer efficiency, increased number of active sites and strong structural stability. This work paves an interesting route for boosting the HER performance of oxide-based electrocatalysts through introducing an ultrathin carbon coating for various energy systems in the future.									18	0	0	0	2	0	18			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000502091800009

Herein, a new class of ternary (Pt0.9Pd0.1)(3)Fe intermetallic is developed with excellent performance toward alkaline HOR. Specifically, the Pd-substitution facilitates the formation of L1(2)-Pt3Fe intermetallic at a lower annealing temperature. Electrochemical analysis and density functional theory calculations indicate that the in-situ formed interstitial alloying PdHx during the electrochemical cycle widens the d-band structure of (Pt0.9Pd0.1)(3)Fe and shifts downward the d-band center toward the Fermi level. The optimized ligand effect from PdHx gives rise to the encouraging activity for alkaline HOR. Meanwhile, a stepby-step monitoring technique and ex situ CO-stripping voltammetry jointly demonstrate that ordered atoms' arrangement of (Pt0.9Pd0.1)(3)Fe intermetallic contributes to stabilize the local coordination environment and enables the maintenance of the ligand effect from the in situ formed Fe/Fe(OH)(x) heterostructure. Negligible decay in electrochemical surface areas of (Pt0.9Pd0.1)(3)Fe intermetallic after a given accelerated durability test confirms the significant advantage in stability over Pt3Fe alloy. This work sheds light on the significance of ligand effects optimization and real-time tracing of the catalytic process to the structure-activity relationship establishment and subsequent catalyst designs.									29	3	0	0	4	0	30			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500075

However, these features usually come with the severe carbon loss during pyrolysis and activation process. Herein, we report a facile self-terminated activation strategy for high-yield production of nitrogen and phosphorus codoped nanoporous carbon (NP-NC) by using potassium phytate as carbonaceous source. The in-situ formed potassium species enable the effective carbon activation to create plenty of nanopores without additional corrosive chemicals while the formation of K4P2O7 properly terminates the activation, resulting in the extremely low weight loss less than 17%. Benefited from the high surface area of 1294 m(2) g(-1) and trimodal nanoporous structure, the resulted N, P-codoped catalyst exhibits superior ORR activity close to Pt/C, high catalytic current density as well as excellent methanol tolerance and durability. Importantly, as cathode catalyst for Zn-air battery, N, P-NC also exhibits current and power densities comparable to the state-of-the art 20% Pt/C. Therefore, such a facile, scalable and high-yield synthesis of N, P-codoped nanoporous carbon materials opens up opportunities for the mass-production of highly efficient cost-effective electrocatalysts for energy applications.

The modification of hematite mesoporous thin- film photoanodes with Ti(IV), as well as their functionalization with an oxygen-evolving catalyst, leads to a 6-fold increase in photocurrent density with respect to the unmodified electrode. In order to provide a detailed understanding of this behavior, we report a study of Ti-containing phases within the mesoporous film structure. Using X-ray absorption fine structure and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy coupled with electron energy loss spectroscopy, we find that Ti(IV) ions are incorporated within ilmenite (FeTiO3) near-surface layers, thus modifying the semiconductor-electrolyte interface. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that an FeTiO3/-Fe2O3 composite is used in a photoelectrochemical setup for water oxidation. In fact, previous studies of Ti(IV)modified hematite photoanodes reported the formation of pseudobrookite (Fe2TiO5) at the surface. By means of transient absorption spectroscopy, transient photocurrent experiments, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, we show that the formation of the Fe2O3/FeTiO3 interface passivates deep traps at the surface and induces a large density of donor levels, resulting in a strong depletion field that separates electron and holes, favoring hole injection in the electrolyte. Our results provide the identification of a phase coexistence with enhanced photoelectrochemical performance, allowing for the rational design of new photoanodes with improved kinetics.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000584489800028	32986954

Computational study of h-WO3 surfaces as a semiconductor in water-splitting application								SURFACES AND INTERFACES				28						101695	10.1016/j.surfin.2021.101695				FEB 2022	2022	Photocatalytic water-splitting using metal oxide semiconductors have been attracted much attention during recent years. Finding novel metal oxide materials with efficient conversion and sustainability is a critical challenge in this process. Here, a systematic theoretical study is conducted on h-WO3 photocatalytic properties employing density functional theory. The TB09 exchange-correlation with providing a 2.3 eV band-gap for bulk structure is introduced as a most appropriate functional. Based on the different terminations and corresponding stoichiometry, several h-WO3 (001) slab models were studied. Their properties such as band alignments, charge analysis, wave distributions, and work functions were compared to gain better insight on photocatalytic reactions over their surfaces. The Stoichiometric/Asymmetric slab in WO-term surface with lower surface energy, lower work function, and the band alignments closer to correspond photocatalytic water-splitting is selected to study. The wave function distributions showed the lowest unoccupied level in WO termination that provides the active site for chemical reactions to adsorb the molecules. The thermal stability of the slab, without surface reconstruction, is observed through ab initio molecular dynamic simulation. In addition, the strong adsorption energy of a water molecule on the h-WO3 surface achieved -0.912 eV by Vdw-DF-C09 functional. The activation energy for each step of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in a water-splitting reaction revealed acceptable values compared to other surfaces.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2468-0230			WOS:000784000200005

Here, the authors describe the design of Pt atomic clusters containing Pt-O-Pt units supported on Co single atoms and N co-doped carbon for enhanced hydrogen evolution catalysis.Platinum is the most efficient catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction in acidic conditions, but its widespread use has been impeded by scarcity and high cost. Herein, Pt atomic clusters (Pt ACs) containing Pt-O-Pt units were prepared using Co/N co-doped carbon (CoNC) as support. Pt ACs are anchored to single Co atoms on CoNC by forming strong interactions. Pt-ACs/CoNC exhibits only 24 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) and a high mass activity of 28.6 A mg(-1) at 50 mV, which is more than 6 times higher than commercial Pt/C with any Pt loadings. Spectroscopic measurements and computational modeling reveal the enhanced hydrogen generation activity attributes to the charge redistribution between Pt and O atoms in Pt-O-Pt units, making Pt atoms the main active sites and O linkers the assistants, thus optimizing the proton adsorption and hydrogen desorption. This work opens an avenue to fabricate noble-metal-based ACs stabilized by single-atom catalysts with desired properties for electrocatalysis.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2041-1723		WOS:000790940000012	35508501

However, the strong bonding strength of hydrogen on the catalyst surface significantly slows down the kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we have developed an in situ phase transition strategy to prepare a series of TM-MoC/Mo2C (TM = Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) heterostructures as catalysts for the HER with the transition metals acting as inducers. The MoC/Mo2C interface and the strong coupling between the TM and MoC/Mo2C enable the reconfiguration of the local electronic environment around the Mo sites, which efficiently balances the binding strength of hydrogen and the charge transfer rate for accelerating the kinetics of the HER. As a result, with adding a 0.5% molar ratio of Co and Mo, the Co-MoC/Mo2C-0.5 catalyst displays a low overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) of 114 mV (0.5 M H2SO4) and 82 mV (1 M KOH) as well as remarkable stability. This work provides an efficient strategy of using transition metal ions in heterojunctions to induce synergistic optimizations in the local electronic structure and molybdenum-hydrogen bond strength to enhance the kinetics of the HER.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000782251200001

The electrochemical overpotential of these TiNO films for water oxidation was found to be as low as 290 mV at 10 mA/cm(2), which is among the lowest overpotential values reported. The Tafel slopes, indicative of a rate of increase of electrode potential with respect to current, for these films are determined to be in the range of 85-57 mV/decade. These results further demonstrate the superiority of TiNO thin film as electrocatalyst for water oxidation to generate fossil-free fuels. The improvement in the electrocatalytic behavior of the semiconducting TiNO thin films is explained based on an adjustment in the valence band maximum edge and an enhancement in the number of electrochemically active sites. Both effects are realized by the substitution of N by O, forming a TiNO lattice that is isostructural with the rock-salt TiN lattice. These findings appear to assume significant importance in light of water electrolysis to produce fuels for the development of environmentally friendly power sources.									17	2	0	0	0	0	17			2574-0962			WOS:000576676900031

As with the myoglobin of the related abalone Sulculus diversicolor (Suzuki and Takagi, J. Mol. Biol. 228, 698-700, 1992), the sequence of Nordotis myoglobin showed no significant homology with any other globins, but showed high homology (35% identity) with vertebrate indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, a tryptophan degrading enzyme containing heme. The amino acid sequence homology between Nordotis and Sulculus myoglobins was 87%. These results support our previous idea that the abalone myoglobins evolved from a gene for indoleamine dioxygenase, but not from a globin gene, and therefore all of the hemoglobins and myoglobins are not homologous. Thus, abalone myoglobins appear to be a typical case of convergent evolution.									16	0	0	0	14	0	21			0277-8033			WOS:A1994ND62100002	8011076

Studies on the microstructure evolution and electrochemical extraction mechanism show that the formation of Ti5Si3 and the removal of impurity elements happened simultaneously during the electro-deoxidation process. It is found that the electro-deoxidation generated Ti5Si3 micro-particles typically possess a smooth surface, which could contribute to create a continuous anti-oxidation surface layer with excellent high-temperature oxidation resistance property. Consideration is also given to the parameters of electrolysis and the electrochemical characteristics including chemical and/or electrochemical reactions during the electro-deoxidation process, and then a relevant kinetic model is proposed.									39	6	0	0	1	0	41			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000334998400039

However, restricted by the highly competitive hydrogen evolution reaction and the highly inert N N bond, electrochemical nitrogen reduction research still faces significant chal- lenges with a Low level of selectivity and activity. Herein, we demonstrate a catalyst (PdCu/TiO2-x) composed of oxygen vacancy-rich TiO2-x nanosheets and PdCu alloy nanopartides by the co-reduction method of metal precursors. Such a catalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance at room temperature and pressure, with an NH3 yield rate of 8.51 mmol g(cat)(-1) h(-1) and the corresponding faradaic efficiency of 49.09% at -0.1 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode, which are much higher than most reported palladium-based catalysts and their alloy catalysts. Characterization and experimental results confirm that by properly constructing the surface defect and nanoalloy structure, the optimized electronic structure and synergistic effect can not only effectively improve the N-2 adsorption and activation, but also reduce the reaction barrier, resulting in efficient electrocatalytic performance. Meanwhile, the introduction of Cu accelerates the hydrogen desorption, further effectively improving the faradaic efficiency. Overall, we explored the electrocatalytic performance and mechanism of the bimetal alloy catalyst, as well as the optimization strategies for enhancing the nitrogen mass transfer process, providing new insight into the rational design of a highly efficient e-NRR system through tuning of the catalyst and reaction environment.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2052-1537		WOS:000825695100001

The rate of reaction was found to be second-order in both [FeO42-] and [H+]. These results are consistent with a proposed mechanism in which the first step involves the initial equilibrium protonation of FeO42- to give FeO3(OH)(-), which then undergoes rate-limiting O-O bond formation. Analysis of the O-2 isotopic composition for the reaction in (H2O)-O-18 suggests that the predominant pathway for water oxidation by ferrate is intramolecular O-O coupling. DFT calculations have also been performed, which support the proposed mechanism.									18	5	0	0	6	0	23			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000453065900022	30259584

The evolution of the phase characterization and morphology of ZrB2 powder oxidized at 700degC for varying durations was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. The excellent fit of TG curves by multiple-law model suggests that the oxidation of ZrB2 powder in air follows para-linear kinetics, and based on the fitted results, oxidation mechanisms can also be obtained. The reaction product of ZrB2 powder with oxygen is metastable tetragonal ZrO2 at 700degC, and the tetragonal phase transforms to the monoclinic phase with oxidation. The oxidation of ZrB2 powder is associated with surface microcrack formation, which is attributed to volume expansion resulting from oxidation of ZrB2 to tetragonal ZrO2 and tetragonal-to-monoclinic phase transformation of ZrO2. In the last stage of oxidation, each ZrB2 particle breaks into fragments. [All rights reserved Elsevier].									0	0	0		0	0	0			0925-8388			INSPEC:10754665

I: Metastability								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS				95	8			4046	4059		10.1063/1.1667007				APR 15 2004	2004	Amorphous hydrogenated silicon suboxides (a-SiOx:H) were deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition from the source gases SiH4, H-2, and CO2. The band gap of the samples can be tuned from 1.9 to 3.0 eV by varying the oxygen content from 0 to 50 at. %. The light-induced degradation of the photoconductivity and the generation of metastable dangling bond defects, known as the Staebler-Wronski effect in hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H), were studied in a-SiOx:H for a wide range of oxygen contents up to 44 at. % as a function of illumination time and intensity. Upon intensive illumination above their respective band gaps for several hours at comparable light intensities, all silicon suboxides displayed a similar increase of the subgap defect density and a corresponding decrease of the photocurrent. Also the temporal evolution of the dangling bond density and photoconductivity were found to resemble those of pure amorphous silicon. Apart from an irreversible redshift of the absorption edge for higher oxygen contents (comparable to the effect of photodarkening in chalcogenide glasses), the effects of light degradation could be reversed by an appropriate annealing at temperatures below 200 degreesC for all oxygen concentrations studied. However, for higher oxygen concentrations ([O]greater than or similar to30 at. %) partial irreversibilities were observed after repeated degradation cycles.

Nevertheless, the weak O-2 adsorption capacity and inefficient separation of charge carriers greatly restrict the production efficiency of H2O2. Herein, iodine ions were used as invisible chemical scissors to tailor the tubular g-C3N4 (TCN) precursor, and relatively ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets were prepared (TCN/NaI). The obtained TCN/NaI exhibits alkali metal (Na+) and hydroxyl (-OH) co-modification, and shows the highest H2O2 generation rate (1935.61 mu M h(-1)), greatly exceeding that of bulk g-C3N4 (BCN, 31.96 mu M h(-1)) and TCN (129.32 mu M h(-1)). In addition, excited states calculations of BCN + O-2 and TCN/NaI + O-2 further reveal that the electron of the beta spin-orbital in TCN/NaI can transfer to the pi* orbital of O-2 more easily than that in BCN, thus enhancing the activation of O-2. This work not only provides in-depth insights into the photocatalytic ORR for the H2O2 production mechanism, but also shows that the synergy of structure modification and doping can be further expanded to other semiconductors for photocatalytic applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000842491400001

The reaction pathways and kinetics in the photoreforming of C-3-C-6 polyols were explored. Polyols are converted via direct and indirect hole transfer pathways resulting in (i) oxidative rupture of C-C bonds, (ii) oxidation to alpha-oxygen functionalized aldoses and ketoses (carbonyl group formation) and (iii) light-driven dehydration. Direct hole transfer to chemisorbed oxygenates on terminal Ti(IV)-OH groups, generating alkoxy-radicals that undergo beta-C-C-cleavage, is proposed for the oxidative C-C rupture. Carbonyl group formation and dehydration are attributed to indirect hole transfer at surface lattice oxygen sites [Ti center dot center dot O center dot center dot center dot Ti] followed by the generation of carbon-centered radicals. Polyol chain length impacts the contribution of the oxidation mechanisms favoring the C-C bond cleavage (internal preferred over terminal) as the dominant pathway with higher polyol carbon number.

This model is tested here by performing quantum chemical calculations. An empirically parametrized hybrid density functional method is used, and both monomeric and dimeric manganese model systems are studied. It is found that, by coordination to a manganese center, the first O-H bond strength of water is lowered from 113.4 to 84.3 kcal/mol. This O-H bond strength is only 2.8 kcal/mol stronger than that in tyrosine. Using an extended basis set, we find that this difference decreases still further. The second hydrogen abstraction energy is quite similar. Since thermoneutrality in the reaction (or a weak exothermicity) is a requirement for the hydrogen abstraction model, the present calculations support this model. Possible functions of a coordinated chloride and a nearby calcium complex are suggested. Five-or six-coordination and ferro- or antiferromagnetic spin couplings of the manganese centers are discussed.									119	0	0	0	33	0	119			0002-7863			WOS:A1997XU61400017

Thence, N/P/B-codoped hollow carbon nanospheres were synthesized by doping B and P into polydopamine spheres. Thanks to the abundance of defects in the hollow carbon sphere shell, the large active area, the high content of pyrrolic N, and B-C, C-N, and other electrocatalytic active sites, NHCS@B1P2 exhibits excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic perform-ance. Electrochemical tests show that NHCS@B1P2 has outstanding ORR electroactivity in alkaline electrolytes, with a half-wave potential (E-1/2) 60 mV higher than Pt/C and a limiting diffusion current density 0.97 mA cm-2 greater than Pt/C. Meanwhile, NHCS@B1P2 (E-1/2 = 0.86 V) still exhibits superior electrochemical performance to Pt/C in neutral media. It is noteworthy that a Zn-air battery (ZAB) using NHCS@B1P2 as the ORR catalyst exhibits a higher peak power density (158.5 mW cm(-2) for an alkaline ZAB and 104.6 mW cm-2 for a neutral ZAB) than Pt/C (136/46.7 mW cm-2) in both alkaline and neutral electrolytes. In step discharge at different current densities, it still has a stable voltage value comparable to (even higher than) Pt/C. In addition, NHCS@B1P2 exhibits a more durable and stable voltage plateau than Pt/C at 10 mA cm(-2). This work provides a practical and valuable avenue for the application of heteroatom-doped carbon-based ORR catalysts in ZABs.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0888-5885			WOS:000830479300001

Consequently, the use of Ni-Pt nanoparticles (NPs) has been proved to be effective among other transition metals such as Co and Fe. Though there are some reports on the synthesis of nanometer-scale particles, optimization of their composition has scarcely been reported. Thus, in this study, the influence of Pt atoms' elemental distribution on the catalytic activities of Ni-Pt alloy NPs was investigated by measuring the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acidic medium. Ni-Pt NPs with Pt concentrations between 7 and 73 at% were synthesized by an alcohol reduction method via the oleylamine complexation of Pt for controlling the size, shape and composition. Ni74Pt26 alloy NPs exhibited the highest catalytic performance, and their mass and specific activities were about 5.1 and 8 times, respectively, that of the commercial Pt catalyst. Moreover, in order to enhance the stability and durability of the particles, Pt-coated Ni74Pt26 alloy NPs were also successfully synthesized by modifying the process to facilitate the heterogeneous nucleation of Pt on the particle surface expecting coherent and ligand effects. The activity of Pt-coated Ni74Pt26 NPs was about 2 times that of the commercially available catalyst but was almost 0.5 times that of Ni74Pt26 particles. The durability was enhanced and comparable to that of the commercial Pt catalyst, suggesting that Pt coating on Ni-Pt alloy nanoparticles could be the design criterion for a highly reactive and cost-effective catalyst.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000659216800001

To date, there have been numerous reports on the synthesis of single-layered nanoframes, but the preparations of double-layered nanoframes have rarely been reported. Here, PtCuCo double-layered rhombic dodecahedral nanoframes (DNFs) were successfully prepared via a one-pot solvothermal synthesis and an acid etching post-treatment. In the first step, PtCuCo heterogeneous nano crystals (HNCs) were constructed each consisting of a Cu-enriched core, PtCuCo double-layered nanoframes, and a Co-enriched shell, and in the second step, PtCuCo DNFs were obtained by acid-assisted selective removal of the leachable components. Evolution experiments reveal that the galvanic substitution reaction between Pt(II) precursor and Cu-enriched nuclei, the following outer-layer deposition of Co, and the atomic migration of Pt are responsible for the formation of PtCuCo HNCs. Remarkably, the electrocatalytic test of PtCuCo DNFs toward methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) shows a mass activity and a specific activity of 1.25 A mg(Pt)(-1) and 4.53 mA cm(-2), which are 2.7 and 4.9 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, the PtCuCo DNFs exhibit improved electrocatalytic stability for MOR compared to Pt/C catalyst.

A facile and green synthesis of nonprecious MnFe2O4 nanorod arrays at low temperature is developed here, where the as-obtained hierarchical MnFe2O4 nanorod arrays exhibit mesoporous structure, large surface area and nice dispersion. These fabricated mesoporous MnFe2O4 nanorod arrays are efficient for water oxidation in 0.1 M NaOH, giving rise to a low overpotential of similar to 0.31S V-RHE at 10.0 mA cm(-2), a high current density (10 times higher than that of commercial 20 wt % Pt/C catalyst at 1.80 V-RHE) and largely enhanced stability. These performances are much superior to previously reported electro-oxidation catalysts as well as the state-of-the-art RuO2 and precious 20 wt % Pt/C catalysts. In particular, this preparation method of MnFe2O4 nanorods is amenable to fast and cost-effective production and shows promising applications in water splitting and other clean energy systems.									18	0	0	0	2	0	18			2168-0485			WOS:000384791500029		
J	Wang, F; Wu, F								Effects of iron phthalocyanine on performance of MH/Ni battery								TRANSACTIONS OF NONFERROUS METALS SOCIETY OF CHINA				14	2			227	231						APR 2004	2004	Oxygen evolution causes a high inner pressure during charge and overcharge for MH/Ni battery, and an inappropriate eliminating way of the oxygen in the battery results in accumulation of heat. This is the main obstacle to develop and apply high capability and high power battery. How to reduce the ratio of the chemical catalysis rate to the electric catalysis rate in MH/Ni battery is considered as an urgent question. Iron phthalocyanine(FePc) was chosen as an electrochemical catalyst. The batteries were prepared by adding iron phthalocyanine with different dosages. The inner pressure, the capacity attenuation, the discharge voltage and capacity at high current of these three batteries were compared. The battery with 1 mg FePc in the negative electrode exhibits a good performance.									2	1	0	0	0	0	2			1003-6326	2210-3384		WOS:000221093600004

Flash pyrolysis technique combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TGA-FTIR), and reactive molecular dynamic simulations (ReaxFF MD) were employed in elucidating the trigger mechanism of coal pyrolysis. The proposed coal model was C1328H1130N21O245S7, whose pyrolysis was simulated using ReaxFF MD. Simulation results showed that the pyrolysis process could be divided into activation, decomposition and recombination stages, which agreed well with the experimental weight loss. Based on evolutions of gas species, it was found that the generation of gases was caused by the cleavage of oxygen-containing groups during the activation stage. Simulation results with the unimolecular of Shenfu coal showed that the order of chemical bond cleavage was C-O-C<C = O<aromatic-CH<COOH in the activation stage. The variation of chemical bond agreed well with those from TGA-FTIR and Py-GC/MS analyses, indicating that the simulated results are valid and convincing. Therefore, it was concluded that the free radical reactions responsible for gas generation were caused by the cleavage of oxygen-containing functional groups, and this was also the trigger mechanism of coal pyrolysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000743178300005

We propose a method enabling the evaluation of intrinsic catalytic activity of nanoparticles based on the diffusion-limited steady-state current. In a step-after-step process, the influence of coverage on kinetic and diffusion limited current is evaluated to highlight the challenges of sub-monolayer electroanalysis. Conclusions are used to point out strategies and their limitations for qualitative and quantitative comparison of intrinsic catalytic properties. Particularly, the impact of coverage, electrode geometry, altered diffusion profile for nanoparticles and the catalyst activity and selectivity are discussed. Fundamental information about electrochemical sub-monolayer nanoparticle analysis is provided.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1359-6640	1364-5498		WOS:000449765000010	29978879

Herein, Fe-Co inverse spinel oxide nanowires grown on Ni foam are fabricated as carbon-free and binder-free cathodes for Li-O-2 batteries. Superior high rate cycle durability and deep charge capability are obtained. For example, 300 cycles with a low overpotential under a fixed capacity of 500 mAh g(-1) are achieved at a high current density of 500 mA g(-1). In the deep discharge/charge mode at 500 mA g(-1), the optimized Fe-Co oxide cathode can stably work for more than 30 cycles with the capacity maintained at about 2100 mAh g(-1). Owing to the appreciable incorporation of Fe3+ into the surface of stable inverse spinel oxides, the regulated Fe-Co oxide cathodes possess a more stable and higher ratio of Co3+/Co2+, which offers improved adsorption ability of reactive oxygen intermediates and thus achieves the enhanced electrocatalytic performance in the higher current density. In addition, the morphology evolution from array to pyramid-like structure of nanowires further provides assurance in the superior cycle capability. By coupling pyramid-shaped nanowires with binary inverse spinel, the obtained Fe-Co oxide becomes a promising material for practical applications in Li-O-2 batteries. This work offers a general strategy to design efficient mixed metal oxide-based electrodes for the critical energy storage fields.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000550633400023	32530262

However, their fabrication is often costly and cumbersome, and they can easily pollute the environment. This study proposed using a natural Gabonese ore (GBO) containing MnxOy and FexOy as catalysts to degrade orange II (OH) via peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. The GBO PMS system exhibited extraordinarily high stability and catalytic activity towards OH elimination (92.2%, 0.0453 min(-1)). The reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in the system were identified using radical scavenging tests and electron spinresonance (ESR) analysis. Singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) represented the dominant reactive species for OH degradation, while the system presented a lower reaction energy barrier and was effective in a broad pH range (2-10). This work also proposed the activation mechanism for the GBO PMS system and OH degradation pathways. This study revealed a new approach for exploring inexpensive, eco-friendly, efficient, and stable heterogeneous transition metal catalysts.

The paper is divided into two main parts. The first part considers spinel without any sintering additives because there still is some controversy concerning the role of cation stoichiometry on sintering and grain growth. The second part discusses the role of the classic sintering aid, LiF, in processing transparent spinel. LiF is shown to have multiple behaviors: (1) it initially wets spinel and forms a liquid phase at relatively low temperatures, which affects early-stage densification and also grain growth; (2) upon cooling from intermediate temperatures, or even from higher temperatures if microstructure evolution (e.g., formation of closed porosity) prevents volatization, the LiF-containing liquid dewets and resides in isolated pockets; (3) LiF alters the cation stoichiometry, thereby enhancing diffusion via an increase in the concentration of oxygen vacancies; this affects both the densification rate and grain growth; and (4) it reacts with impurities in the system, thereby acting as a cleanser. For the production of transparent spinel, it is critical that LiF or associated reaction products not be retained as a secondary phase.									171	13	1	0	2	0	180			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000267426500017

Conceived by Alexander Frumkin in 1958 and first built by Lev Nekrasov, the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) was a spin-off of the rotating disk electrode (RDE) for which Benjamin Levich developed the hydrodynamic equations defining the electrochemical response. A fascinating account of the development of the RRDE technique by Soviet, American, and British electrochemists during and despite the Cold War can be found in an earlier issue of Interface.(1)									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1064-8208	1944-8783		WOS:000668558400001		
J	Xiangyun Gao; Xia Long; Han Yu; Xiaoyang Pan; Zhiguo Yi								Nanoparticles Decorated NiFe Layered Double Hydroxide as Bifunctional Electrochemical Catalyst								Journal of the Electrochemical Society				164	6			1050	3		10.1149/2.0561706jes				2017	2017	Reducing overpotential and increasing current density remain a great challenge for promoting the application of transition metalsbased layered double hydroxides (LDHs). Herein, Ni nanoparticles (~10 nm) decorated NiFe LDH ultrathin (thickness: ~2 nm) nanosheets (Ni NP/NiFe LDH) were successfully synthesized which exhibited advanced electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability on both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The onset potentials for OER and UOR are 1.50 V and 1.34 V, respectively, both are lower than NiFe LDH under the same conditions. Moreover, the peak current density of UOR was 300 mA/cm2, which is much larger than reported precious-metal free UOR catalysts. The excellent catalytic performance of Ni NP/NiFe LDH composite for OER and UOR is proposed to result from the abundant exposed active sites, small charge transfer resistance, and the synergistic effects between NiFe LDH and anchored Ni nanoparticles. This work provides inspiring ideas and helpful guidelines in design of low-cost but highly efficient electrochemical catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651			INSPEC:17644357

Following our recent work on carbon bipolar UME arrays, we have developed asymmetric carbon-gold bipolar UME arrays where each carbon UME is coated by a thin gold film on one side. To generate large quantities of compositionally varied electrocatalyst samples, a radial gradient of catalytic metal is electrodeposited on the surface of these UME arrays by delivering a plume of metal salt solution to the array surface with a micropipette while the entire array is biased at a reducing potential. We then utilize these bipolar UME arrays to investigate the impact of varied Ni(OH)(2) coverage on the catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of an Au surface in alkaline solution, with the catalytic performance of the modified Au being confirmed to exhibit a peak-shaped dependence on increasing Ni(OH)(2) coverage. Our future work will expand this unique platform to enable the screening of various metal alloys by incorporating additional micropipettes for delivering multiple metal salts to the array during the gradient electrodeposition process.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000704873000001

Compared to Pd/C, CeO2/C, and a physical mixture of Pd/C and CeO2/C, the Pd/CeO2 C hybrid exhibited a superior HER electrocatalytic activity. Stable performance of the Pd/CeO2/C hybrid was achieved during a 12 h chronopotentiometry test at 15 mA cm(-2). The improved HER activity and stability can be attributed to the presence of CeO2 not only as a support for anchoring and stabilizing of Pd nanoparticles, but also via strong interaction between Pd and CeO2. Here an intimate contact between Pd and CeO2 nanoparticles and the strong metal support interaction were demonstrated by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The electron transfer from Pd to CeO2 that results in Pd in the oxidized form was also shown by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XAS measurements additionally demonstrated that the surface Pd was partially oxidized to Pd oxide, and the formation of a plausible Pd-O-Ce structure in the Pd/CeO2/C hybrid.

These reactions play an important role in a wide range of biological processes, as well as in fuel cells, solar cells, chemical sensors, and electrochemical devices. A unified theoretical framework has been developed to describe both sequential and concerted PCET, as well as hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). A quantitative diagnostic has been proposed to differentiate between HAT and PCET in terms of the degree of electronic nonadiabaticity, where HAT corresponds to electronically adiabatic proton transfer and PCET corresponds to electronically nonadiabatic proton transfer. In both cases, the overall reaction is typically vibronically nonadiabatic. A series of rate constant expressions have been derived in various limits by describing the PCET reactions in terms of nonadiabatic transitions between electron-proton vibronic states. These expressions account for the solvent response to both electron and proton transfer and the effects of the proton donor-acceptor vibrational motion. The solvent and protein environment can be represented by a dielectric continuum or described with explicit molecular dynamics. These theoretical treatments have been applied to numerous PCET reactions in solution and proteins. Expressions for heterogeneous rate constants and current densities for electrochemical PCET have also been derived and applied to model systems.									298	2	0	0	56	0	299			1520-6106			WOS:000260675800005	18842015

In this study, hollow nickel hydroxide nanocages are successfully fabricated via an ion-assisted etching protocol using ZIF-8 as the structural template, and they are used as cocatalysts along with a molecular photosensitizer and sacrificial electron donor for reducing visible-light CO2. A remarkable CO evolution rate of 1.44 x 10(5) mu mol.g(co-cat)(-1).h(-1), a CO selectivity of 96.1%, and a quantum efficiency of 2.50% are achieved using the optimal cavernous structure with thin walls, attributing to the significantly improved light harvest owing to multiple light reflection and scattering, static electron transfer, abundant surface oxygen vacancies, as well as coherent energy flow among well-aligned band levels. This study highlights the design and development of hollow entities toward CO2 RR and provides insights into the structure-mediated photocatalytic response.									56	1	0	0	4	0	55			2155-5435			WOS:000606833100034

In particular, NOx storage capability upon admission of NO and NO2 in the absence or in the presence of excess oxygen at temperatures up to 623 K was investigated by in situ FT-IR spectroscopy. For comparative purposes, the bare mixed oxide support was also investigated. Pure NO2 is adsorbed according to a dismutation reaction with the simultaneous formation of nitrates and nitrites that progressively evolve to nitrates ("dismutation route"), the nitrite evolution to nitrates is promoted by the metal phase. When metal phase is present, the nitrites oxidation is further accelerated by the oxygen presence. Pure NO is not stored. When O-2 is present, NO is stored according to two different pathways, both promoted by the metal phases: (i) the NO oxidation to nitrites followed by their oxidation to nitrates ("nitrite route"); (ii) the NO oxidation to NO2, followed by the "dismutation route".

Herein we report the applicability of unrestricted density functional theory (DFT) using the B3LYP hybrid functional and the broken symmetry (BS) formalism for the prediction of thermodynamic properties of the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) steps involved in the electrocatalytic cycle. We characterize a series of three oxidations of the acetate-bound catalyst [(Mn2LAc)-L-II](+) in acetonitrile solution in terms of standard reduction potentials, and we show that the predicted thermodynamic results are in good agreement with experiment. We further apply this model to the prediction of reaction thermodynamics in the electrocatalytic cycle of the aqua-bound catalyst [(Mn2L)-L-II(OH2)(2)](2+), and we locate the most energetically favorable pathway for the oxidation of water by this catalyst. We show upon removal of four protons and four electrons that the remaining oxygen atoms approach to a distance of 1.397 angstrom with the formation of an OO single bond.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			1932-7447			WOS:000344978000006

Extensive earlier experimental findings indicate that inert oxides such as titanium oxide can greatly improve the reactivity of iron oxide over multiple redox cycles. Knowledge on the evolution of the nanoscale morphology of the Fe-Ti materials during the oxidation and reduction is thus of considerable importance. It is also of interest to the fundamental understanding of the ion diffusion mechanism in the reaction processes. In this study, Fe-Ti composite microparticles undergoing cycles of oxidation and reduction are examined at the nano-scale, and the interfacial characteristics of the iron titanium oxides within the composites are probed. Nanobelts are observed to simultaneously form on the microparticle surface during the oxidation at 700 degrees C, while microblades are found at 900 degrees C. Additionally, unlike pure iron microparticles that become dense on surface due to sintering effect, Fe-Ti microparticles are transformed into porous particles after redox cycles. The atomistic thermodynamics methods and density functional theory calculations are carried out to investigate the ionic diffusion and vacancy formation during the oxidation and reduction process. A number of surface configurations are considered, and the Ti-Ti-O-terminated surface is computed to the most stable surface structure at experimental conditions. It was found that in oxidation processes, surface Ti atoms are more favorable for oxygen adsorption and dissociation than Fe atoms. The energy barrier of Fe ion diffusion towards the surface, on the other hand, is lower than Ti ion diffusion, which contributes to the Fe2O3-dominant nanobelt formation. The volume change due to high temperature associated with the solid state transformation at the Fe2O3/FeTiO3 interface produces compressive stresses, which stimulate Fe2O3 nanobelt growth to accompany the interface reaction. Also, as the vacancy formation energy of FeTiO3 is lower than Fe2O3 in the reduction process, it indicates that it is easier for a FeTiO3 surface to form vacancy defects, thereby enhancing the porous surface structure formation and O-2 diffusivity. The good agreements between experiments and DFT calculations further substantiate nanostructure formation mechanism in redox reactions of iron titanium composite materials.									54	2	0	0	1	0	66			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000354952500018

These molecules would have reacted to produce various organic compounds during aqueous alteration which most of the primitive carbonaceous chondrite parent bodies have experienced. Our previous hydrothermal experiments involving formaldehyde and ammonia have already shown formations of amino acids and organic solids that resemble to macmmolecular organic matter in primitive meteorites. Here we focus on the characterization in liquid phases with various analytical methods including high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), in addition to kinetic analyses of the reactions using in-situ FTIR spectroscopy with a heatable liquid cell.The HRMS results showed that soluble fractions contain various carbohydrates (CHO molecules) and these with nitrogen (CHON molecules). The mass defect plots of the reaction products suggested the reactions involving CH2O addition, CH2 addition, dehydration and decarboxylation. C=C and C=N bonds increased with temperature by condensation reactions. Behaviors of oxygen-bearing functional groups showed high complexity. In general, carboxyl/ester/aldehyde compounds formed at the early stage of the reactions, then some of these decomposed by decarboxylation. N-XANES indicated the presence of amide-bearing compounds that could be precursors of amino acids.The in-situ FTIR spectra showed that formaldehyde and ammonia reacted and formed hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) before starting the heating experiments at room temperature. Kinetic analyses showed that the apparent activation energy of decreases in HMT is similar to 130-140 kJ mo1(-1). The decrease in HMT is faster than the other reactions, indicating that the reactions involving HMT occurred at the early stage of the aqueous alteration. The kinetics of the ammonia-aldehyde system suggested that the reactions involving formaldehyde, ammonia and HMT are efficient for aqueous alteration in parent bodies of CI, CM, and CR chondrites.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			0019-1035	1090-2643		WOS:000540258100015

However, their further optimization is restricted by the unclear HOR mechanism. In this work, the density functional theory calculations were carried out to study the alkaline HOR on pure Ni-13 and Ni(13 )supported on graphene (Ni-13/G) and B- and N-doped graphene (Ni-13/BG and Ni-13/NG). The calculations indicate that the HOR proceeds preferentially through the Tafel-Volmer mechanism, in which the adsorption of H* plays a dominant role in the HOR activity. The graphene support and B/N dopants can apparently lower the d-band center of Ni-13, thereby weakening the adsorption of H*, which leads to the HOR activity sequence of Ni-13 < Ni-13/G < Ni-13/BG < Ni-13/NG. Furthermore, compared to pure Ni-13, the oxidation resistance of Ni-13/G, Ni-13/BG and Ni-13/NG is also improved via elevating onset potential of the OH* phase and reducing energy barriers of the OH* reduction with H* and H-2* . An efficient way to improve the HOR performance is tuning the adsorption of H* to accelerate the HOR rate and regulating the adsorption of OH* to enhance the antioxidant capacity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000691177500004

The open circuit potential (OCP) relaxation after the polarization end was performed. Three characteristic regions are identified in the OCP and the bubble radius transients: (i) slow relaxation and shrinking, (ii) transition followed optically by means of a high speed camera. In addition, analytical modeling and numerical simulations for the bubble dissolution were electrode/electrolyte/gas. Simultaneously, the shrinking of the bubble was recorded and correlated with the dissolved H2 concentration at the interface region, and (iii) a long-term slowed down dissolution process. The high supersaturation after polarization remains longer than theoretically predicted and feeds the bubble in region (i). This reduces the dissolution rate of the bubble which differs significantly from that of nonelectrochemically produced bubbles. Numerical multispecies simulations prove that oxygen and nitrogen dissolved in the electrolyte additionally influence the bubble dissolution and slow down its shrinkage compared to pure hydrogen diffusion. In region (iii), a complete exchange of hydrogen gas with nitrogen and oxygen has occurred in the gas bubble.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1932-7447			WOS:000380590600016

However, finding single-phase triple conducting (H+/O2-/e-) electrodes with high electrochemical activity, structural and thermomechanical stability still faces great challenges. Herein, we propose a thermo-dynamically quasi-stable triple conducting perovskite-perovskite nanocomposite as bifunctional RePCC air electrode with exceptional performance, which is composed of a Ba0.5S0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta-based mixed oxygen ion and electronic conductor and a BaZr(0.1)Ce(0.7)Y(0.1)Yb(0.1)O3-delta-based protonic conductor and synthesized through one -pot method. Some unique structure introduces increased number of active sites and rich two-phase boundary, and tailored two phase composition, which contributes to the superior performance for both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. In addition, the intimate connection of the two phases, their cation interexchange characteristics and the thermodynamically quasi-stable composition in the nanocomposite brings the electrode matchable thermal compatibility to the electrolyte and high structural stability that accounts for the superior durability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000858836900004

The influence of lanthanum on the textural properties and catalytic performance was investigated. It was found that lanthanum-modified Cu-Co based catalysts possessed a novel nanosheet structure to form more oxygen vacancies. Compared with CuCo catalyst, the dissociative CO adsorption and associative CO adsorption capacities of LaxCuCo catalysts were improved markedly, and formate and methoxy intermediates were more easily formed on the surface of LaxCuCo catalysts, which is attributed to the proper synergy of the surface active sites (Cu-0, Co-0, and oxygen vacancies). In particular, the addition of lanthanum species reduced the thickness of the nanosheets and facilitated the high dispersion of LaxCuCo after reaction by acting as isolation islands to restrain the aggregation and growth of crystal grain. The evaluation results showed that optimized La0.3CuCo catalyst exhibited the highest CO conversion of 25.4%, superior total alcohols selectivity of 61.4%, and C2+ alcohols selectivity of 79.03% among the total alcohol products, and excellent stability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-3820	1873-7188		WOS:000827970800005

It is known that the apex of the volcano curve shifts with applied potential. However, the trend of the potential-dependent shift of the volcano apex has remained unclear. Herein, we address this question for a two-step electrocatalytic reac-tion. With the transfer coefficient assumed as 1/2, our analysis reveals that the adsorbate coverage at the volcano apex equals 1/2 regardless of potential. We present a criterion to predict the direction and mag -nitude of the apex shift as a function of the activation energies of the two steps. Thereafter, the criterion is extended to the oxygen reduction reaction. The influence of the transfer coefficient and the potential of zero charge on the volcano plot is revealed. Implications of the presented criterion for targeted design of electrocatalysts are discussed. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, desirable NO3R kinetics and N-2 selectivity remain challenges. In this research, 2.5 wt% Cu and 10 wt% Pd are loaded on various oxides supports and combine with electrolytic in-situ H-2 generation for NO3R. Pd10%Cu2.5%/TiO2 demonstrates a faster NO3R rate constant than Pd10%Cu2.5%/gamma-Al2O3 and even greater than Pd10%Cu2.5%/CeO2. Pd10%Cu2.5%/gamma-Al2O3 obtains better N2 selectivity than the other two. Crucially, the oxygen vacancies (VO) existing in TiO2 and CeO2 can reduce the nearby Cu2+ to Cu+, also Cu2+ can attract electrons from Pd-0 to form Cu' on the gamma-Al2O3 surface. Verified by experiments and density functional (DFT) calculations, these Cu' based active sites on the surface of substrates are vital for effective NO3 adsorption and high N-2 selectivity.

Regardless of the electrolyte type, SSA allows for the formation of nanotube walls more than twice as thick as other methods, leading to increased stability in the electrolyte. As a result, formation of nanograss is suppressed even after prolonged anodization. However, the SSA method exhibits a high onset potential for OER, whereas a newly grown barrier oxide is formed in PS. As a higher PS voltage is applied, a greater amount of ruthenium/ruthenium oxide is doped into TiO2 and a thicker barrier oxide is formed. Thus, optimization of PS voltage is required for each sample. The amount of ruthenium in TiO2 depends on the electrolyte used rather than the doping method: a higher amount of Ru in TiO2 is generally obtained in aqueous electrolytes compared to non-aqueous electrolytes. Empirical equation for maximum OER current density was deduced in terms of the total surface area of nanotubes, concentration of ruthenium, and barrier oxide thickness.

A woody waste, hinoki cypress sawdust (HCS), was used as a feedstock, and an entrained drop-tube furnace (DTF) was applied to all experimental tests. It is found that raising the temperature remarkably decreases tar evolution. Steam and oxygen also have a positive effect on tar destruction. Benzene and toluene are the most difficult condensable tar species to destroy. The achievement of their complete destruction in the product gas requires extremely high temperatures above 1200 degrees C, regardless of the gasifying agents. The coke deposits from 900 degrees C and reaches a maximum formation at 1000 or 1100 degrees C. The results obtained in this study suggest that competition occurs between the secondary decomposition of hydrocarbon species and gasification reactions of the produced char and/or coke with gasifying agents in the temperature range of 900-1100 degrees C.

It produces molecular oxygen and protons to drive ATP synthesis, fueling life on Earth. As a multi-subunit membrane-protein-pigment complex, Photosystem II undergoes a dynamic cycle of synthesis, damage, and repair known as the Photosystem II lifecycle, to maintain a high level of photosynthetic activity at the cellular level. Cyanobacteria, oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria, are frequently used as model organisms to study oxygenic photosynthetic processes due to their ease of growth and genetic manipulation. The cyanobacterial PSII structure and function have been well-characterized, but its lifecycle is under active investigation. In this review, advances in studying the lifecycle of Photosystem II in cyanobacteria will be discussed, with a particular emphasis on new structural findings enabled by cryo-electron microscopy. These structural findings complement a rich and growing body of biochemical and molecular biology research into Photosystem II assembly and repair.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2076-2607		WOS:000802498400001	35630282

According to experimental findings provided by X-ray powder diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectrometry, the model encompasses three major stages related to a series of oxygen levels, which are function of oxygen potential during milling. The initial step involves the formation of oxide mixtures, as evidenced by oxidizing highly reactive chalcogens (Se and Te) and re oxidation of PbO. In the middle step, which represents the largest process stage, Te or Se share electrons to act as Te (IV) and Se (IV) in order to form Pb complex chalcoxides. The formation of high purity Pb2SeTe semiconductor solid solution is detected at the final stage, in such stage the chalcogens act as reducing agents. Consequently, neither inert nor high vacuum atmospheres are required during the milling process. The model involves a quaternary interpretation whose predictions are validated with experimental findings, theoretical, and even analogous phases not reported so far in literature.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000674631000004

While the electrode surface structure and composition are primary, the role of electrolyte components in the activity and selectivity of catalytic centers is also significant, if not drastic. Interestingly, the performance of electrocatalysts is not only affected by the so-called specifically adsorbing ions. Many species, which are generally considered "inert", can de facto change the key properties of the catalytic sites. However, the origin of such experimentally observed effects is often poorly understood. Despite the fact that certain trends are frequently observed, further investigation of model systems and development in the field of quantum chemistry calculations are necessary in order to gain deeper insight into the effects of the electrolyte composition. The goal of this review article is to summarize and analyze recent achievements in the elucidation of the non-trivial effects of electrolyte components and their contribution to the observed performance of catalytic centers. A particular focus is set on the influence of (i) alkali metal cations, (ii) commonly used anions, (iii) unexpected pH effects, as well as (iv) the impact of certain ionic liquids on the activity and selectivity of catalytic systems. Reactions which are essential for the prospective sustainable energy provision schemes are selected as illustrative examples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The calculation results show that the primary decomposition reactions of Hatcher subbituminous model begin with intramolecular changes such as the cleavage of unstable C-C and C-O bonds. The formation mechanisms for typical pyrolysis products were explored. For example, the initial pathway for the formation of CO is by the decarbonylation of carbonyl or carboxyl group, while CO2 is mainly produced by hydrogen transfer and decarboxylation of carboxyl groups. CH4 can be formed mainly by CH3 center dot free radical abstracting a hydrogen atom from the hydroxyl group. H-2 is formed by two hydrogen atoms from one or two groups bonding together, which makes the residue fragments more stable. Hydrogen can also react with oxygen-containing free radicals or unsaturated bonds. Combining ReaxFF molecular dynamics (RMD) simulation and density functional theory (DFT) calculation, we find that the free radical C9H9O center dot is an important fragment during the pyrolysis process of Hatcher subbituminous model. As a precursor for cresol, it can capture hydrogen radical to form intermediate C9H10O and may continue to produce o-cresol and ethylene in the presence of hydrogen resource. These simulation results for the initial pyrolysis process and the reaction mechanisms agree with previous experimental observations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The prepared samples were further applied for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline solution, and the electrochemical performance was investigated and compared with porous graphene and Pt/C 20 wt.%. The results revealed that introducing nitrogen to the graphene structure leads to improvement in catalytic activity, enhanced catalytic current as well as more positive potential. Furthermore, N-doped graphene prepared using ammonium acetate exhibited excellent methanol tolerance and long-term stability. Finally, it was shown that the optimal pyrolysis temperature was obtained at 900 degrees C. Therefore, it is concluded that ammonium acetate could be used as an effective precursor for the ORR.

Herein, we demonstrate a facile and effective strategy for the controllable synthesis of nitrogen and phosphorus co-doped hierarchically porous carbon (N,P-HPC) electrocatalysts by pyrolyzing phytic acid (PA) and dicyandiamide (DCDA) with nitrogen-doped hierarchically porous carbon (NHPC) derived from cattle bones. The results show that optimal N and P co-doping plays an important role in enhancing the ORR catalytic activity of carbon-based electrocatalysts. The optimized N,P-HPC with a high content of N (3.2 at%) and P (4.0 at%) exhibits remarkable ORR activity with an onset potential of 0.924 V (comparable to commercial Pt/C), a half-wave potential of 0.853 V (12 mV higher than that of Pt/C) and a kinetic current density of 38.2 mA cm(-2) at 0.8 V (1.9-times that of Pt/C) in alkaline electrolyte. Furthermore, the N,P-HPC electrocatalyst also demonstrates superior electrochemical stability and methanol tolerance in comparison with Pt/C. The excellent ORR performance of N,P-HPC can be attributed to the increased number of active sites, the favorable three-dimensional hierarchically porous structure and the large specific surface area (1516 m(2) g(-1)). This attractive strategy opens a new avenue for the synthesis of highly efficient metal-free electrocatalysts for the ORR.									69	2	0	0	6	0	69			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000416340300035

However, their performance and large-scale practical applications are largely limited by poor durability and high overpotential on the air-cathode due to the slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER/ORR). Therefore, it is highly desired to develop new bifunctional catalysts to improve the OER and ORR kinetics. In this paper, NiCo2Se4 nanowires were uniformly grown on carbon fiber paper (CFP) for the first time. With an overpotential for OER of 327 mV, NiCo2Se4 nanowires show a better performance than RuO2 (350 mV) and a high stability. Moreover, their half-wave potential of 0.77 V and limiting current density of 3.75 mA.cm(-2) make it a promising non-precious-metal catalyst for ORR, with performance close to Pt/C (0.87 V, 3.7 mA.cm(-2)). The excellent performance is attributed to the nanowire morphology with efficient 1D electronic pathways, high conductivity of NiCo2Se4 and an enhanced electronic structure, thanks to a mixed valence of nickel and cobalt ions.

As models for the Li2O2 material at the cathode we employ small amorphous clusters with a 2:2 Li:O stoichiometry, whose energetically most stable atomic configurations comprise both O atoms and O-O pairs with mixed peroxide/superoxide character, as revealed by their bond lengths, charges, spin moments, and densities of states. The oxidation of Li8O8 clusters is studied in unbiased DFT-based MD simulations upon removal of either one or two electrons, either in vacuo or immersed in dimethyl sulfoxide solvent molecules with a structure previously optimized by means of classical MD. Whereas removal of one electron leads only to an enhancement of the superoxide character of O-O bonds, removal of two electrons leads to the spontaneous dissolution of either an O-2 or a LiO2+ molecule. These results are interpreted in terms of a two-stage process in which a peroxide-to-superoxide transition can take place in amorphous Li2O2 phases at low oxidation potentials, later followed by the dissolution of dioxygen molecules and Li+ ions at higher potentials.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000365463000015

Effect of steaming								JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				208	1			83	88		10.1006/jcat.2002.3536				MAY 15 2002	2002	In the first part of this investigation, we studied in detail the structure, the oxidation state, and the mutual interconversion of extraframework iron species formed in Fe silicalite samples upon migration of iron from framework to extraframework positions induced by thermal activation and redox treatments. In this second part, we used temperature-dependent EPR, UV-vis, and IR spectroscopies to investigate the nature of the extraframework iron species present in Fe silicalite after steaming. Relatively large (congruent to 30 nm) particles of iron oxide were detected. These large clusters are located outside the zeolite pores and are believed not to participate in partial oxidation reactions. It is shown that the Fe species which contribute to the formation of Fe2O3 extralattice particles are preferentially clustered grafted Fe2+ species. In contrast, isolated Fe2+ species are less affected by the steaming treatment. This suggests that the oxygen species active in the selective partial oxidation of benzene are adsorbed on isolated extraframework grafted Fe2+ centers. This result is of primary importance for the understanding of the structure of the oxygen species active in partial selective oxidation using N2O as oxidant.

Regenerative fuel cells are among the most promising sustainable energy power sources. Compared to secondary batteries, regenerative fuel cells possess unique advantages, including high power density, high specific energy density, light-weight, low-cost, high-efficiency, long-life, and zero environmental impact. More importantly, an regenerative fuel cell is an electrochemical device that can collect and store solar energy during the daytime and release it gradually whenever is needed, making energy available 24/7. Therefore, the development of high-performance regenerative fuel cells in the aerospace sector is becoming more and more important. Herein, in this review, various types of fuel cells are briefly introduced, followed by a detailed discussion and comparison between different unitized regenerative fuel cells. Electrocatalysts and membranes are two of the essential components in the unitized regenerative fuel cells that play a key role in enhancing the system's efficiency. Thus, recent progress and challenges on bifunctional hydrogen and oxygen electrodes are systematically summarized and discussed, respectively. More importantly, the progress and challenges of proton and anion electrolyte membranes are discussed. Further, power performance and durability are two important measures for the application of regenerative fuel cells in space energy systems. Therefore, the current progress of fuel cells in power performance and durability are summarized and discussed. In the end, the key issues and future perspectives of unitized regenerative fuel cells toward space energy storage and transportation are presented.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			0306-2619	1872-9118		WOS:000613289800003

Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)				21	11										2016 Nov 23	2016	The photocorrosion of a nanoporous carbon photoanode, with low surface functionalization and high performance towards the photoelectrochemical oxidation of water using simulated solar light, was investigated. Two different light configurations were used to isolate the effect of the irradiation wavelength (UV and visible light) on the textural and chemical features of the carbon photoanode, and its long-term photocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction. A complete characterization of the carbon showed that the photocorrosion of carbon anodes of low functionalization follows a different pathway than highly functionalized carbons. The carbon matrix gets slightly oxidized, with the formation of carboxylic and carbonyl-like moieties in the surface of the carbon anode after light exposure. The oxidation of the carbon occurred due to the photogeneration of oxygen reactive species upon the decomposition of water during the irradiation of the photoanodes. Furthermore, the photoinduced surface reactions depend on the nature of the carbon anode and its ability to photogenerate reactive species in solution, rather than on the wavelength of the irradiation source. This surface modification is responsible for the decreased efficiency of the carbon photoanode throughout long illumination periods, due to the effect of the oxidation of the carbon matrix on the charge transfer. In this work, we have corroborated that, in the case of a low functionalization carbon material, the photocorrosion also occurs although it proceeds through a different pathway. The carbon anode gets gradually slightly oxidized due to the photogeneration of O-reactive species, being the incorporation of the O-groups responsible for the decreased performance of the anode upon long-term irradiation due to the effect of the oxidation of the carbon matrix on the electron transfer.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1420-3049		MEDLINE:27886117	27886117

Here phosphorus doped single wall carbon nanotubes loaded with nanoparticles of iron carbide and iron phosphide are synthesized cost-effectively and time-efficiently using a one-pot and one-step chemical vapor deposition method, and exhibit superb catalytic activity for the HER. The nanohybrid electrocatalyst produces a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 157 mV in acid solution and 331 mV in basic solution. The Tafel slope is 60.8 mV dec(-1) in acid solution and 87.6 mV dec(-1) in basic solution. The catalyst can work stably in both acidic and basic solutions with 100% faradaic efficiency. The superb performance correlates with the doping of single wall carbon nanotubes with phosphorus, and the synergistic effect of iron phosphide and iron carbide.									43	0	0	0	1	0	43			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000382110200038

However, the issues of low selectivity and activity still call for solutions. The key to rationally optimizing the activity and selectivity of electrocatalysts for the ORR is to control their electronic structures. Carbon-supported atomically dispersed metal sites (C-ADMSs) feature isolated metal atoms with well-defined local coordination structures in a carbon host matrix, in which the coordination bonds, bond lengths and coordination number can be modulated to alter the selectivity/activity for the ORR. Benefiting from their metalloenzyme-like properties, C-ADMSs have been serving as an ideal and adjustable platform to controllably regulate the selectivity and activity for the ORR. Therefore, an in-depth summary of the regulation of coordination structures for the ORR is of great significance and a pressing need. In this review, we focus on the manipulation of the coordination number in the first coordination shell and the coordination atoms in the first, second and even outer coordination shells. Then, we summarize the influences of coordination numbers and coordination atoms in different coordination shells on the selectivity for 2e(-) ORR and the activity for 4e(-) ORR, respectively. In addition, we attempt to figure out the general principle of the regulating mechanism between the coordination environment and the catalytic activity/selectivity for the ORR. Finally, we present a brief conclusion, and discuss the challenges and opportunities with respect to the active microenvironment of central metals in C-ADMSs for the ORR.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000848574300001

However, its practical applications are impeded by the low NH3 yield and Faradaic efficiency (FE) mainly due to the inert N equivalent to N triple bond and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, ruthenium-doped defect-rich SnO2 nanoparticles on carbon cloth (Ru-SnO2/CC) are synthesized for efficient electrocatalytic NRR under ambient conditions. The catalysts exhibit an NH(3 )yield of 4.83 mg h(-1) cm(-2) with a FE of 17.01% at -0.2 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in 0.1 M Na2SO4. The integration of Ru species, SnO2 and oxygen vacancies leads a synergistic catalytic system, in which the semiconducting SnO2 particles not only stabilize the Ru active centers but also suppress the HER, while the oxygen vacancies in SnO2 lattice help to promote the N-2 adsorption and enhance the activity of the Ru active centers. Overall, this synergy result in a unique local environment around the Ru active sites that favors the NRR process, which is further reinforced by the binder-free and facile electron transfer nature of CC, leading to the outstanding NRR catalytic activity and durability. These results outperform majority of the noble-metals-based electrocatalysts under similar conditions. This metal-doping tuned local environment manipulation may open up a promising avenue to the design and fabrication of efficient catalysts for N-2 electroreduction. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Book of Papers								105	8						Feb. 1999	1999	This paper reports the monitoring of thin film growth and treatments by optical emission spectroscopy (OES) and spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE). The thin films are deposited from oxygen/TEOS (tetraethoxysilane Si-(OC2H5)4) plasmas in a rf helicon reactor. According to the TEOS fraction (%TEOS) in the mixture, either inorganic SiO2-like dielectric films (%TEOS<30%) or organic SiOxCyHz films (%TEOS>30%) are deposited. Ex situ analyses by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy have shown that the area of the infrared CHx absorption band between 2800-3000 cm-1 is proportional to the C atomic ratio in the SiOxCyHz films and thus is a good indicator of the evolution of the total carbon content in the films. In the first part of the paper, we investigate the in situ monitoring of the carbon content by ellipsometry and OES. In the second part, both OES and ellipsometry are used to gain insight into the surface reactions occurring during a post deposition treatment of an organic film by pure oxygen or argon plasmas.

Here, the reducing agent effect on Pd nanomaterials and their long-term chemical stability were scrutinized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The subsequent impact on the catalytic properties was examined using the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). We have discovered that the nature of the reducing agent has noteworthy effects on the final composition of Pd nanomaterials prepared from chemical methods. The surface state of the nanomaterials prepared by using sodium borohydride as reducing agent (Pd/C-NaBH4) is radically different from those obtained from L-ascorbic acid (Pd/C-AA). In addition to pure metal, two oxides were identified: PdO and PdOx (x > 1). XRD analysis has upheld the presence of PdO only in Pd/C-NaBH4, thus underpinning the conclusion that NaBH4 has drastically changed the Pd structure. Furthermore, the reducing agent substantially affects the electrocatalytic properties. The ORR starts with enhanced kinetics (E > 1 V vs. RHE) by a 4-electron process, producing p(H2O2) < 0.5% associated with excellent durability over 5000 cycles. Both catalysts outperform all reported data for Pd electrocatalysts. The novelty of this work is combining ex/in situ XPS and XRD analyses together with ORR as a catalytic model. Overall, this work represents a clear development in our understanding of Pd affinity towards hydrogen and paves new ways for the successful synthesis of Pd-based nanomaterials free fromhydrides and oxides, and having impressive catalytic activities.									40	0	0	0	2	0	40			2046-2069			WOS:000369545800090

Herein, a facile operation strategy is presented to construct the C-Fe/Fe3O4 nanoparticles embedded in the N-doped graphene framework (denoted as C-Fe/Fe3O4@NGF), which is derived from the introduction of ascorbic acid modified Fe/Zn-MOF guests into the graphene sheet host as a co-precursor and carbonized to obtain a high-performance catalyst. In this configuration, ascorbic acid with moderate acidity can corrode the surface of the MOFs to some extent, thus facilitating the exposure of active sites. As such, the optimized C-Fe/Fe3O4@NGF demonstrates superior ORR performance with a high onset potential (E-onset) of 0.96 V and half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.86 V for the ORR. More importantly, the durability and methanol-resistance of C-Fe/Fe3O4@NGF outnumbers those of commercial Pt/C in alkaline media. The presented strategy opens a new avenue for developing highly active MOF-derived electrocatalysts for diverse applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000834805600001

However, there are still remaining challenges in the modification of desired carbon-nitrogen bonding for further enhancement of ORR catalytic activity. Herein, we designed a simple and effective method to have selective C-N bonding in synthesized carbon nanoparticles via a liquid plasma process. The nitrogen-containing carbon was synthesized by pyrazine (an aromatic structure precursor) and acrylonitrile (a linear structure precursor). From elemental analysis, the atomic percentage of nitrogen content in carbon synthesized from pyrazine and acrylonitrile was 8.58 and 2.97 at%, respectively. The structural analyses from scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy showed slight differences in the carbon matrices. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) demonstrated that the chemical bonding states of nitrogen were different and dependent on the structure of the original precursor. The relative percentage of amino-N of nitrogen was significantly higher when the linear structured acrylonitrile was applied as a precursor. In contrast, pyridinic-type nitrogen bonding was more preferred in carbon synthesized from heterocyclic structural pyrazine. From electrochemical analyses, the key factor for high ORR performance was not related to the total nitrogen content. Instead, a more positive ORR onset and peak potential was observed when the ratio of amino-N and quaternary-N increased, where the content of pyridinic-N had a significant effect on current density. This work opens new directions in designing and synthesizing selective C-N bonding within a N-doped carbon matrix through a simple solution process operated at room temperature.									15	1	0	0	0	0	16			2046-2069			WOS:000389350700011

Meanwhile, Potentiodynamic polarization and SEM techniques were also used as assistant measurements. Three mathematic methods including average, standard deviation and wavelet transformation have been employed to analyze the records. The results showed that each single wet-dry cycle can be divided into three regions with respect to the change of the cathodic reaction rate, and with the increase of pH value the main cathodic reaction changes from the reduction of protons to that of oxygen molecules. The analysis of the EDP versus time evolution clearly indicates that the whole corrosion process can be divided into three segments for the case of pH 3.5 and only one for the cases of pH 4.5 and 6.0, which have been theoretically interpreted according to the corrosion theory and experimentally proved by SEM. The results also showed that the corrosion in the case of pH 3.5 was much more rigorous than that in the cases of pH 4.5 and 6.0. It may due to synergistic effects of that, the characteristic of hydrogen ions which is much more active than that of oxygen molecules, the high diffusion/migration rate of hydrogen ions in solution or through surface films and the lower stability of surface passive film at low pH value system.

Here, we report that oxygen-vacancy-rich Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets are developed as an ideal multifunctional layer between an Ir catalyst and Ni protected Si photocathode, which could not only effectively capture and stabilize atomic Ir via the newly formed O-Ir-O bonds, but also significantly enhance the reaction kinetics by accelerating charge and mass transport and reducing the energy barriers of both the Volmer and Tafel steps. A benchmarking applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of 12.4% and a sustainable stability of more than 300 h are achieved under AM1.5G one sun illumination, outperforming all the previously reported Si photocathodes in alkaline media. Our findings emphasize the importance of the interlayer for the Si photocathode and offer the avenue to achieve highly efficient and durable PEC devices.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000810093500001

A Cu2O-CuO heterogeneous composite with many nanometer-sized CuO nanoplates distributed on the Cu2O surface as well as Cu(OH)(2) nanowires was fabricated, and the structural evolution process was explored. The mechanism for the structure's formation can be attributed to the synergistic reaction of oxidation etching and acidic etching. It was found that the surface morphology and chemical composition of the nanostructures play important roles in catalyzing ozone decomposition. The Cu2O-CuO-Cu(OH)(2) hierarchical nanostructure exhibits a 100% ozone (20 ppm O-3 per air) decomposition efficiency at room temperature after 30 h of continuous operation, showing high stability. In addition, the hierarchical nanostructure also shows high moisture resistance, and the ozone conversion can still be above 80% at high relative humidity levels (ca. 90%) after a 16 h test. The excellent performance can be attributed to the delocalized holes speculated by EPR spectroscopy, which may facilitate the necessary electron transfer between intermediate oxygen anions and the catalytic surface.									30	5	0	0	7	0	31			1466-8033			WOS:000434312100012

Thermogravimetric (TG) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis was used to online analyze devolatilization components of kerogen pyrolyzed at 20 ℃ /min. The reactivity characteristic and variation of structural parameters of aliphatic hydrocarbon with pyrolysis time were obtained. The results show that the oil shale kerogen was composed of aliphatic hydrocarbon,aromatic hydrocarbon and oxygen functional groups. The relative content of aliphatic hydrocarbon structure,mainly long chain methylene,reaches 18.5% ~ 78.2%. With increasing degree of kerogen evolution,the content of aliphatic hydrocarbon and capacity of oil generation decrease. The decomposition of kerogen mainly occurs during 350~520 ℃. The thermal weightless is mild when above 520 ℃ at which mass fraction of the residual char is 19.5%~52.2%. FT-IR analysis shows that free water releases out firstly during pyrolysis,subsequently depolymerization and dehydration reactions occur, and in which main side chains of alkane fall off and cyclization and oxygen-containing groups break into various of hydrocarbons,acids,alcohols,aldehydes,etc. until more stable graphite-like structure is formed.			对五种不同地区油页岩中干酪根进行了固体KBr压片红外吸收光谱分析,并通过曲线分峰拟合建立了干酪根中脂肪烃区域结构参数的定量测定方法。利用TG-FTIR联用分析技术对干酪根在20 ℃/min升温速率下热解挥发分析出组分在线定性分析,得到了脂肪烃结构参数随热裂解过程的反应特性及变化规律。研究表明,油页岩中干酪根由脂肪烃结构、芳香烃结构和含氧等官能团三部分组成。脂肪烃结构相对含量为18.5%~ 78.2%,并均以含长链亚甲基结构为主。随着演化程度的加深,干酪根中脂肪烃含量逐渐减少,生油能力也不断降低。干酪根热分解主要发生在350~ 520 ℃, 520 ℃后热失重现象趋于平缓,在此温度下各样品残余半焦的质量分数为19.5%~ 52.2%。在线红外分析结果表明,干酪根热裂解过程中先析出游离水,随后发生解聚和脱水反应,主要的烷基侧链不断脱落、环化及含氧基团逐渐断裂生成各种烷烃类、羧酸类、醇类和醛类等物质,直至形成更加稳定的类石墨态结构。						11	10	0	0	0	0	21			0253-2409			CSCD:5566291

In this work, a hetero-layered composite photocatalyst was successfully prepared by a facile self-assembly method based on electrostatic interaction between oppositely charged Zn/Cr-layered double hydroxide (Zn/Cr-LDH) and lead niobate nanosheets. The layer-by-layer stacking of Zn/Cr-LDH and HPb2Nb3O10 nanosheets was beneficial for rapid migration of photo-induced charge carriers inside the photocatalyst because of large contact area. In the meantime, Zn/Cr-LDH and HPb2Nb3O10 components exhibited suitable energy-band alignment, which led to efficient separation of photo-induced charge carriers. The composite photocatalyst showed enhanced photo catalytic O-2-generation activity under visible-light irradiation without loading cocatalyst. Briefly, this work expanded the applications of AB(2)Nb(3)O(10)-based materials in photo catalytic energy conversion and proved that constructing composites based on electrostatic self-assembly of complementary 2D materials is a promising strategy for development of more efficient photocatalysts.

The galvanic replacement is an attractive method to prepare bimetallic particles with high catalytic activity and a high control of the morphology and chemical composition, varying with the experimental conditions during the synthesis. The influence of the time with the transformation from pure Pd nanocubes to concave core-shell PtPd nanoparticles synthesized by galvanic replacement is examined: after different times of preparation, the morphology of the particles was monitored by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) coupled with energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Via X-Ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), the crystallographic structure and the variation of size, lattice parameters, d-spacing, and composition were determined. The extended X-ray fine structure (EXAFS) measurements show the formation of a PtPd alloy at the surface of the particles for all samples. Finally, the electrochemical determination of the catalytic activity and stability tests revealed two different particle types as candidates to replace pure Pt as catalyst in the proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) due to their enhanced stability, higher catalytic activity, and lower Pt content.

Here, we designed a self-supporting 3D hierarchical porous electrode by filling carbon nanotubes (CNTs) loaded with Ni-P alloy into the framework of nickel foam (NF). Firstly, CNTs were decorated with a catalytically active Ni-P alloy via electroless plating (Ni-P@CNTs). Then, the Ni-P@CNTs were filled and anchored onto the framework of NF via electroplating to synthesise a self-supporting electrode (Ni-P@CNTs/NF). The Ni-P@CNTs/NF exhibited an excellent catalytic performance toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1 M KOH electrolyte, with an overpotential of 53 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 101.56 mV dec(-1) and excellent long-term durability. This facile and effective strategy might provide a new path to the design of self-supporting electrodes with enhanced HER catalytic. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

However, it is still ambiguous to identify the configuration of etched MoS2 with comparative hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity to commercial Pt. In this work, the HER activity on etched anti-triangular MoS2 are investigated by density functional theory calculations. We found the valence electron distribution of inner edge atoms can be affected by the corner, and accordingly determine their activity. The second-nearest atom to anti-triangular corner possesses the highest activity. The simulated polarization curves show etched anti-triangular Mo-edge MoS2 with moderate size (around 12 angstrom) maximize the HER performance. Further increasing size of etched MoS2 deactivate their HER activity to a certain degree, validated by available experimental data. This work suggests etched MoS2 catalysts with rational design may be a candidate to substitute Pt electrodes as HER electrocatalyst. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Here, we present an analysis of the chemical process of carbon surface modification using ammonolysis of preoxidized carbon blacks, and correlate their chemical structure with their catalytic activity and stability using in situ analytical techniques. Upon ammonolysis, the support materials were characterized with respect to their elemental composition, the physical surface area, and the surface zeta potential. The nature of the introduced N-functionalities was assessed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. At lower ammonolysis temperatures, pyrrolic-N were invariably the most abundant surface species while at elevated treatment temperatures pyridinic-N prevailed. The corrosion stability under electrochemical conditions was assessed by in situ high-temperature differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy in a single gas diffusion layer electrode; this test revealed exceptional improvements in corrosion resistance for a specific type of nitrogen modification. Finally, Pt nanoparticles were deposited on the modified supports. In situ X-ray scattering techniques (X-ray diffraction and small-angle X-ray scattering) revealed the time evolution of the active Pt phase during accelerated electrochemical stress tests in electrode potential ranges where the catalytic oxygen reduction reaction proceeds. Data suggest that abundance of pyrrolic nitrogen moieties lower carbon corrosion and lead to superior catalyst stability compared to state-of-the-art Pt catalysts. Our study suggests with specific materials science strategies how chemically tailored carbon supports improve the performance of electrode layers in PEMFC devices.									41	3	0	0	0	0	43			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000448752100036

However, it is still challenging to increase the specific active sites and enhance the electrocatalytic activity, the lack of which significantly limits the overall As(iii) sensing performance and largely prevent its utilization in ultra-trace detection of As(iii) in practical water systems. Herein, we report a detailed design of adsorbent assisted Fe oxide-based plasmonic Ag/Au hollow and porous nanoshells (Ag/Au HPNSs@FO) for electrochemical As(iii) determination and ultra-trace detection of As(iii) in practical water systems based on the integrated advantages of the plasmonic and ultra-microelectrode nanostructure. Ag nanoparticles were used merely as starting templates for the fabrication of plasmonic Ag/Au HPNSs and then, porous Fe oxide, with good adsorption capacity toward As(iii), was introduced by pyrolysis treatment of MIL-100(Fe) grown on the Ag/Au HPNSs. The remarkable features of abundant micro-reactive sites, improved electrochemical activity, and synergistic effects have vastly ensured outstanding electrocatalytical performance of the arsenic redox reaction. The wide linear range of detection is from 0.05 to 16 ppb and the detection limit (3 sigma) is 0.01 ppb. Moreover, Ag/Au HPNSs@FO exhibits high sensitivity (922.5 A ppb(-1)) and stable detection. Most importantly, the ultra-trace detection of As(iii) in practical water systems can be achieved by Ag/Au HPNSs@FO with unprecedentedly low concentrations (ca. 1 ppt and even lower concentrations).									21	1	0	0	3	0	22			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000443272700023

The design of optimal photocatalyst structures is a key to efficient overall water splitting, and the development of photocatalysts which can efficiently convert large portion of visible light spectrum has been required. Recently, a series of complex perovskite type transition metal oxynitrides, LaMgxTa1-xO1+3xN2-3x, was developed as photocatalysts for direct water splitting operable at wide wavelength of visible light. In addition two-step excitation water splitting via a novel photocatalytic device termed as photocatalyst sheet was developed. This consists of two types of semiconductors (hydrogen evolution photocatalyst and oxygen evolution photocatalyst) particles embedded in a conductive layer, and showed high efficiency for overall water splitting. These recent advances in photocatalytic water splitting were introduced.

The laser treatment allows us to tune the surface morphology and the chemical composition of the copper electrocatalysts. This tunability is used to correlate the role of the surface area and catalyst dopants with the selectivity of the CO2RR. The liquid products of the CO2RR are monitored through ex situ nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The products' distribution shows that the electrode surface area plays a key role in the electrochemical conversion of CO2 into multicarbon liquid products. We show that sulfur dopants boost the production of formate. Remarkably, by co-doping sulfur and fluoride, we show that the chalcogenide dopant counteracts the known boosting effect of fluoride to convert CO2 into multicarbon products. Oxygen doping in the range of 2-19 atom % does not significantly affect the distribution of liquid products from CO2 electroreduction. In a broad perspective, this work highlights the potential of the femtosecond laser process to fine-tune surfaces to produce photo- and electrocatalyst materials.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2574-0962			WOS:000669533800061

Reduced atomic collisional-radiative model for VUV radiation prediction in Earth's reentry								Proceedings of the 5th International Workshop on Radiation of High Temperature Gases in Atmospheric Entry								16	26						2012	2012	During hypervelocity reentry into Earth's atmosphere, a significant part of the radiative heat flux experienced by the spacecraft is emitted in the Vacuum Ultraviolet (VUV), in the nonequilibrium part of the post-shock region. Using radiation measurements for typical Moon or Mars return conditions performed at NASA Ames in the Electric Arc Shock Tube (EAST) facility, the main atomic electronic states responsible for the intense radiation in this wavelength range have been identified as being the fourth and fifth electronic states of atomic nitrogen and the fifth electronic state of atomic oxygen. We have developed a collisional-radiative (CR) model to predict the population of these emitting states and compared the predictions given by other CR models used in the aerospace community. The most significant mechanisms driving the evolution of these electronic states have been identified, leading to a reduced CR model to a set of seven electronic states and twenty-eight reactions.					5th International Workshop on Radiation of High Temperature Gases in Atmospheric Entry5th International Workshop on Radiation of High Temperature Gases in Atmospheric Entry	16-19 Oct. 201216-19 Oct. 2012	Centre de Recerca Matematica (CRM)Centre de Recerca Matematica (CRM)	Barcelona, SpainBarcelona, Spain	0	0	0		0	0	0					978-92-9092-278-0	INSPEC:13854107

Hollow fibre bioreactors show promise as cell expansion devices, owing to their potential for scale-up. However, further research is required to establish how to specify appropriate hollow fibre bioreactor operating conditions for expanding different cell types. In this study we develop a simple model for the growth of a cell layer seeded on the outer surface of a single fibre in a perfused hollow fibre bioreactor. Nutrient-rich culture medium is pumped through the fibre lumen and leaves the bioreactor via the lumen outlet or passes through the porous fibre walls and cell layer, and out via ports on the outer wall of the extra-capillary space. Stokes and Darcy equations for fluid flow in the fibre lumen, fibre wall, cell layer and extra-capillary space are coupled to reaction-advection-diffusion equations for oxygen and lactate transport through the bioreactor, and to a simple growth law for the evolution of the free boundary of the cell layer. Cells at the free boundary are assumed to proliferate at a rate that increases with the local oxygen concentration, and to die and detach from the layer if the local fluid shear stress or lactate concentration exceed critical thresholds. We use the model to predict operating conditions that maximise the cell layer growth for different cell types. In particular, we predict the optimal flow rate of culture medium into the fibre lumen and fluid pressure imposed at the lumen outlet for cell types with different oxygen demands and fluid shear stress tolerances, and compare the growth of the cell layer when the exit ports on the outside of the bioreactor are open with that when they are closed. Model simulations reveal that increasing the inlet flow rate and outlet fluid pressure increases oxygen delivery to the cell layer and, therefore, the growth rate of cells that are tolerant to high shear stresses, but may be detrimental for shear-sensitive cells. The cell layer growth rate is predicted to increase, and be less sensitive to the lactate tolerance of the cells, when the exit ports are opened, as the radial flow through the bioreactor is enhanced and the lactate produced by the cells cleared more rapidly from the cell layer.									9	0	0	0	5	0	9			0022-5193	1095-8541		WOS:000397701300005	28089874

Herein, we have shown that Ni(OH)(2)/TiO2 prepared in the presence and absence of molecular oxygen results in significantly varied hydrogen production activity. The sample synthesized in the presence of O-2 and N-2 produced 6624 mu mol/h/g and 4468 mu mol/h/g of hydrogen under direct solar light exposure. Additionally, the samples prepared in the presence of light irradiation produced 8289 mu mol/h/g of hydrogen, a 72 fold jump in hydrogen production compared to TiO2. XPS, FTIR, Raman, and ESR measurements were carried out to investigate the underlined mechanism for such variation in the photocatalytic activity. Our results suggest that the presence of molecular oxygen during Ni(OH)(2)/TiO2 synthesis causes the formation of terminal OH and reduced the oxygen vacancies on the surface of TiO2, which can significantly alter the H-2 production. Also, the reusability of the photocatalysts is greatly affected by the synthesis conditions, namely the presence of light and molecular oxygen. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

However, their widespread use is generally limited by recharging issues. In the case of Al-air cells, water on the anode prevents aluminium deposition during recharging by producing hydrogen at more positive standard potentials. This promotes parasitic reactions that consume the anode and shorten the cell shelf life. On the cathode side, depending on the pH, water allows efficient oxygen reduction or oxygen evolution reactions. To produce electrolytes with different water contents on the two electrodes, we prepared solid electrolytes using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and aqueous HCl solutions with ionic conductivity ranging from 0.7 to 2.2 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) and electrochemical windows wider than 2.2 V. The new materials resembled a thin plastic membrane (0.6-0.9 mm thick) and were able to oxidise the Al-air cell anode. We also explored the possibility of using a dual electrolyte to allow the presence of water mainly on the cathode side. Specifically, cells assembled with two electrolytes in contact, with an acidic PVA membrane as anolyte and saline hydrogel as catholyte without separator, showed discharge capacity more than one order of magnitude greater than cells with single acidic PVA electrolytes. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterisation verified that the improved cell discharge capacity was attributed to the soft aqueous catholyte on the cathode-electrolyte interface and to the membrane conductivity stabilisation during cell use through the saline gel water. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) characterisation suggested the possibility of recharging the dual electrolyte cells thanks to the substantial absence of water on the anode side.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000608667500002

The influence of varied microwave irradiation temperature on nitrogen doping efficiency in the graphene oxide (GO) catalyst has been investigated. Nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (NrGO) catalysts with varied nitrogen content were synthesized under microwave irradiation temperature at 120-200 degrees C. The catalyst synthesized at 180 degrees C (NrGO-180) has the highest nitrogen content of 9.8 at% with a maximum proportion of pyridinic-N moiety in the graphene structure. The XPS analysis demonstrates the presence of different nitrogen-containing moieties such as pyridinic, pyrrolic and graphitic nitrogen, and their respective composition changes significantly with microwave-irradiation temperature. The linear sweep voltammograms studies demonstrated that NrGO-180 with a maximum amount of pyridinic-N has displayed excellent electrocatalytic activity towards ORR with an E-onset potential similar to 0.89 V (vs RHE) and half- wave potential E-1/2 = 0.72, which is at par with the studied commercial Pt/C (E-onset = 0.93 V, E-1/2 =0.82) and demonstrated 4-electron pathway. The catalyst NrGO-180 with enhanced electrochemical activity has been subjected to durability test of 5,000 potential cycles via LSV. The durability test confirms the superiority of NrGO-180 over commercial Pt/C catalyst under similar condition.									12	0	0	0	2	0	12			2365-6549			WOS:000442985800027

Air catalycity determination in plasma wind tunnels and diffusion reactors								6th European Symposium on Aerothermodynamics for Space Vehicles								8 pp.	8 pp.						Jan. 2009	2009	Ground testing methodologies in plasma wind tunnels and diffusion reactors are presented with their associated determination procedure to characterize the TPS catalytic properties. The specificity of each these testing strategies are reported and illustrated on experiments carried out for metallic TPS. Experimental data of the recombination coefficient of atomic oxygen under air plasma flow were first obtained in the diffusion reactor MESOX on PM 1000, for two total pressures (300-1000 Pa) in the temperature range (850-1650 K) using actinometry and optical emission spectroscopy. In this investigation, the evolution of the recombination coefficient is dependent of the temperature, the pressure level and also of the chemical composition of the surface leading to one order of magnitude for a given temperature. Second, the recombination coefficient of PM 1000 in air is obtained in the in-situ reactor VKI Plasmatron at several conditions. Both techniques revealed consistent results, the recombination coefficient is increasing with temperature and also dependent on the static pressure. The surface change due to the plasma exposure is inspected with SEM which opens the path to further analysis. The paper concludes discussing the possible complementarities and synergies of both testing methodology to improve the characterization and modeling of TPS materials.					6th European Symposium on Aerothermodynamics for Space Vehicles6th European Symposium on Aerothermodynamics for Space Vehicles	3-6 Nov. 20083-6 Nov. 2008		Versailles, FranceVersailles, France	0	0	0		0	0	0					978-92-9221-223-0	INSPEC:10857316

The deposits were prepared by sputter deposition in a mixture of Ar and C2H2. Samples were exposed to oxygen plasma created in a quartz tube by a microwave discharge at the power of 1000 W. The evolution of the coating composition was monitored versus plasma treatment time by AES depth profiling. Furthermore, SEM characterization was performed to observe morphological differences. The results showed that at low tungsten concentration (20 at.% of W) almost entire hydrogenated carbon was removed from the mixed W-C films. At high tungsten concentration (50 at.% of W), a compact passive WO3 layer was formed on the surface of the samples. This compact layer prevented interaction with hydrogenated carbon even after prolonged plasma treatment as proved by SEM analysis. XRD characterization revealed that the oxide film was highly crystalline. In the case of a sample with the low tungsten content (20 at.% of W), WO3 layer was more porous with many cracks and thinner. Successful removal of carbon from W-C films with low tungsten content was explained by migration of particles through the porous films.					22nd International Conference Nuclear Energy for New Europe (NENE)22nd International Conference Nuclear Energy for New Europe (NENE)	SEP 09-12, 2013SEP 09-12, 2013		Bled, SLOVENIABled, SLOVENIA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-9-61-620736-2	WOS:000392268600133

Air electrodes integrated with bifunctional electrocatalysts play a vital role in improving performance and reducing cost of zinc-air batteries. Recently, the self-supported bifunctional electrocatalysts synthesized by in situ growth of active materials on conductive substrates have gained increasing popularity, because they often provide high performance of both electrocatalytic activity and stability. In this work, we review the state-of-the-art development of self-supported non-precious-metal electrocatalysts, including carbon-based metal-free materials, transition metal materials, and metal-based hybrid materials, especially the efficient strategies (e.g., heteroatom doping, defect engineering and structures design, etc.) for preparation of self-supported electrocatalysts, as well as the understandings of fabrication mechanism.

Herein, we propose a facile and cost-effective method for synthesizing Pd-Ni(OH)2 nanocatalysts on Ketjen black carbon as an alternative to commercial Pt/C catalysts. First, the Pd-Ni(OH)2/C nanocatalyst prepare using a sonochemical and solvothermal method. Then, the Pd-Ni(OH)2/C nanocatalyst analysis using transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Pd-Ni(OH)2 nanoparticles with sizes of approximately 5 nm well disperse on the Ketjen black carbon. XRD use to clarify face-centered cubic Pd and amorphous Ni(OH)2. The valence states of Pd and Ni(OH)2 confirm using XPS. The amounts of Pd and Ni in the nanocatalyst are 12.14 and 2.21 wt%, respectively, from ICP. Pd-Ni (OH)2/C exhibits high performance in linear sweep voltammetry for the ORR. In addition, long-term stability and methanol tolerance confirm via chronoamperometry experiments in an alkaline solution. Pd-Ni(OH)2/C exhibits better durability than that of commercial Pt/C. The high current density, durability, and methanol resistance of Pd-Ni(OH)2/C present a potential alternative to Pt/C in proton exchange membrane fuel cells and direct methanol fuel cells through a facile and cost-effective synthesis method.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1369-8001	1873-4081		WOS:000862498600001

Nevertheless, in the air cathode of the Mg-air battery, the slow dynamics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) seriously hinders its development and application. Herein, the Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) with tunable chemical compositions and controllable morphology were used as precursors to prepare effective and stable ORR electrocatalysts for Mg-air batteries. The Fe@NC and bimetallic CoFe@NC electrocatalysts were derived from calcining FeFe-PBA and CoFe-PBA precursors at various temperatures under an argon atmosphere. Compared with an Fe@NC electrocatalyst, the bimetallic CoFe@NC electrocatalysts possess better ORR activities and stability under alkaline and neutral conditions. When the pyrolysis temperature was 600 degrees C, the CoFe@NC-600 displayed the best ORR activities. Meanwhile, the CoFe@NC-600 electrocatalyst exhibits the similar ORR reaction mechanism and activity compared to the Pt/C catalyst. After 5000 CV cycles in alkaline (0.1 M KOH) and neutral (3.5 wt % NaCl) electrolytes, the half-wave potentials of CoFe@NC-600 electrocatalyst merely appear at 2 and 5 mV negative deviations, respectively. Furthermore, the homemade Mg-air battery composed with CoFe@NC-600 exhibits superior discharge behaviors compared to that of the Mg-air battery assembled with Fe@NC. This research offers the groundwork for future research into the progress of nonprecious bimetallic ORR electrocatalysts for Mg-air battery.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000864698900001		
J	Saint-Raymond, H; Huin, D; Stouvenot, F								Mechanisms and modeling of liquid steel decarburization below 10 ppm carbon								MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS JIM				41	1			17	21		10.2320/matertrans1989.41.17				JAN 2000	2000	Steel grades for packaging or automotive industry applications require ultra low carbon levels and carbon contents below 10 ppm have to be obtained in the industrial decarburization reactor (tank degasser or vacuum circulation degasser, known as RH). In the ultra low carbon range (below 10 ppm in the vacuum vessel), the decarburization kinetics cannot be obtained from the analysis of metal samples but can be deduced from continuous exhaust gas analysis and flow rate measurements. This was done on an industrial RH-OB degasser and a reliable and precise measurement of reaction rates in the ultra low carbon range was obtained. The rate was evaluated by an overall volumetric coefficient of decarburization ak/S. A model of de carburization kinetics in vacuum vessel has been developed at IRSID based on a physical description of three different reaction sites: spontaneous CO boiling in metal layer just beneath bath surface where carbon and oxygen contents are in excess with respect to equilibrium CO partial pressure, decarburization by purging gas in zones where metal and injected gas bubbles are in contact and decarburization of metal drops projected in vacuum vessel by bubble bursting. The experimental results indicate that CO boiling is responsible for the largest part of decarburization, but, the decarburization of metal drops projected in vacuum vessel is dominating below 10 ppm. The dynamic modeling of die process describes simultaneously the evolution of vessel pressure, oxygen and carbon contents. It explains with very good accuracy the experimental results and is used to define optimal process parameters for industrial treatments.									16	2	0	0	0	0	17			0916-1821			WOS:000086034800004		
J	Gupta, AK; Muller, P								Pyrolysis of paper and cardboard in inert and oxidative environments								JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER				15	2			187	194		10.2514/2.5441				MAR-APR 1999	1999	Data on the thermal destruction behavior of paper and cardboard under controlled conditions are presented. The decomposition behavior was determined using a thermogravimetric analyzer and differential scanning calorimetry. Tests were carried out on paper, cardboard, and cellulose at two different heating rates of 10 and 50 degrees C/min, and surrounding gas environments of argon (for pyrolysis), air, or oxygen (for oxidative pyrolysis), The temperature range for the thermal decomposition behavior was varied from 25 to 1000 degrees C to investigate the entire decomposition spectra, Global decomposition data show that the maximum decomposition shifts to higher temperatures at higher heating rates as a result of the competing effects of heat and mass transfer, product diffusion, and reaction kinetics. The Arrhenius parameters for thermal decomposition were determined using a first-order decomposition reaction of the form: dm = -k x in x dt. Results showed that the activation energy, heat of pyrolysis, and char yield are strongly dependent on the heating rate. An increase in heating rate results in a decrease in activation energy and an increased char yield. The heating rate dependence of the kinetic parameters is discussed. The decomposition behavior of the materials examined is endothermic, whereas the overall process is exothermic because of the presence of oxygen in the material. In general, parameters such as heat transfer, mass diffusion, product evolution, heating rate, temperature, and the surrounding environment control the decomposition process, The results show significant variation in the thermal decomposition behavior of the samples. Furthermore, marked variation have been found from sample-to-sample. These variations suggest challenges associated with the exact determination of thermal decomposition characteristics of real wastes. Despite these variations, data presented in this paper are useful for design guidelines for solid waste thermal destruction systems.

However, tailorable and efficient synthesis of TMDs to garner the electrochemical and electrocatalytic performance of thus-derived electrodes has by far remained challenging. Herein we demonstrate a versatile synthetic strategy to in situ grow CoSe2@vertically-oriented graphene (VG) hierarchical architecture on carbon fiber cloth (CC) via combined steps of plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition and wet chemistry. Such self-supporting and flexible CoSe2@VG/CC arrays possess significant implications for pseudocapacitive Na storage and electrocatalytic O-2 evolution (OER). When evaluated as an anode material for sodium-ion hybrid capacitors, full cells comprising a CoSe2@VG/CC anode and AC cathode enable a favorable cyclic stability at 0.5 A g(-1) for 1800 cycles in the potential range of 0.5-3.3 V, harvesting a high energy and power density of 116 Wh kg(-1) and 7298 W kg(-1). In addition, CoSe2@VG/CC array also exhibits an excellent OER performance with a low over-potential of 418 mV and Tafel slope of 82 mV dec(-1) on a basis of experimental exploration and theoretical simulation.									63	8	0	0	2	0	63			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000467774100043

The corrosion and stress corrosion mechanisms of titanium and titanium alloys in deep sea environment are still unclear, which poses a great threat to the application of titanium alloys in deep sea environments. The electrochemical behavior and stress corrosion behavior of industrial pure titanium TA2 in simulated deep sea environment were studied by electrochemical method and U-bend test. Results show that the hydrostatic pressure promotes the uniform corrosion of TA2 and the cathode hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). With the increase of hydrostatic pressure, the corrosion current density and cathode HER current density of TA2 increase. The addition of sulfides reduces the stability of the TA2 passive film to a certain degree, and promotes the cathode HER. The stress corrosion test shows that TA2 has stress corrosion sensitivity under the effect of sulfide ions in deep sea water. The SCC mechanism is mainly hydrogen-induced cracking for TA2 in deep seawater environment. However, due to the difference in oxygen content between deep sea and shallow sea, anodic dissolution mechanism is also one of the reasons for SCC.									0	3	0	0	0	0	3			1007-9289			WOS:000542482300002

Although ZABs are incredibly stable under normal conditions unlike popular Li-based energy storage devices, many challenging issues remain. Requirements such as rechargeability, low-cost fabrication, and mass production of an effective bifunctional catalyst restrict the use of commercial ZABs to a few small electronic gadgets. In this study, we introduce a functionalized pen-drawable ink composed of amorphous MnO2 with a large specific area, graphene sheet (GS) flakes, and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythio phene) (PEDOT). The MnO2-decorated GS is successfully immobilized on graphite felt (GF) using the PEDOT network. The pen-drawn MnO2@GS/PEDOT/GF substrate is further used as a bifunctional air cathode. Power density of the air cell is 37.8 mA.cm(-2) at 55 mA.cm(-2). The potential difference between the half-wave potential of the oxygen reduction reaction and the operational potential of the oxygen evolution reaction is 0.74 V; this value is comparable to that of traditional noble metal catalysts, and is obtained at a current density of 10mA.cm(-2) with the pen-drawn cathode in a two-electrode system containing a conventional 6 M KOH electrolyte.

In this work, 4.5 x 4.5 cm(2) Ag3PO4 microcrystalline films are grown via a room-temperature solution process, and vacuum annealing is proposed to solve the stability and light absorption issues. It is found that the major process below 400 degrees C of vacuum annealing is the vertical bar Recovery vertical bar process for Ag3PO4 microcrystals, when lattice defects and Ag-0 surface species get reduced. Next, vertical bar Recrystallization vertical bar stage occurs at >400 degrees C. The recovery of native defects of silver vacancies, with both density functional theory calculation and experimental results, could simultaneously improve the light absorption and catalytic activity of Ag3PO4. The 400 degrees C-annealed Ag3PO4 photoanode, with enhanced light harvesting and crystal quality, exhibits 88% increase in (J(light) - J(dark)) value (1.94 mA cm(-2)) than non-annealed photoanode (1.03 mA cm(-2)). Moreover, it retains >99% current density after a 4000-s stability test. These results suggest that vacuum annealing can substantially improve the PEC performance of Ag3PO4 microcrystalline film photoanodes due to mitigated effects of native defects, improved light harvesting, and inhibited Ag3PO4 decomposition during water oxidation reaction.

The methyl orange(MO)aqueous solution was selected as a simulated wastewater. The ordered microstructural TiO2-NTs substrate was synthesized by an electrochemical method to obtain large specific surface area and high space utilization. The phase structure, electrode surface morphology and electrochemical properties of electrodes were characterized by XRD, SEM and electrochemical technology, respectively. The results showed that praseodymium oxide was successfully doped into the SnO2-Sb film by CV method. Due to the doped Pr, the oxygen evolution potential increased from 2.25 V to 2.40 V. The degradation of MO was investigated by UV-vis. The Ct /C0(phi) was studied as a function to obtain the optimal parameters, such as the amount of doped Pr, current density and initial dye concentration. In addition, the degradation process followed pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics and the rate constant was 0.099 3 min-1. The result indicated that the introduction of Pr reduced the formation of oxygen vacancies or enhanced the formation of adsorbed hydroxyl radical groups on the surface, thus leading to better activity and stability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1006-4982			INSPEC:16686730

Herein, we report an effective strategy to develop flower-on-sheet structured nanohybrids, where CoP nanoflowers are epitaxially grown along the edges of Ni-Co-P nanosheets (namely NiCoP) on carbon cloth (m-CoP-NiCoP/CC), thus obtained as efficient self-supported electrodes for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in both acidic and alkaline media. This unique nanostructure endows NiCoP nanosheets with maximal exposed surface area, along with increased active sites brought by CoP nanoflowers. Moreover, due to good electrical connection between CoP nanoflowers and NiCoP, and between conductive NiCoP and carbon cloth, electrons can easily transfer from active sites to the conductive substrates. Therefore, the m-CoP-NiCoP/CC exhibits superior catalytic activity and stability for HER in both acidic and alkaline media. The as-prepared electrocatalyst requires overpotentials of only 75.0-81.5 mV to deliver a benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic and alkaline media, respectively, which are superior to most of the previously reported metal phosphides-based electrocatalysts. Hence, this work can provide a design for developing highly active electrocatalysts for water splitting.[GRAPHICS].									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000584354400013

We summarize here adventures with them since the early 1960s. This includes studies on light absorption by cyanobacteria, excitation energy transfer at room temperature down to liquid helium temperature, fluorescence (kinetics as well as spectra) and its relationship to photosynthesis, and afterglow (or thermoluminescence) from them. Further, we summarize experiments on their two-light reaction - two-pigment system, as well as the unique role of bicarbonate (hydrogen carbonate) on the electron-acceptor side of their photosystem II, PSII. This review, in addition, includes a discussion on the regulation of changes in phycobilins (mostly in PSII) and chlorophyll a (Chl a; mostly in photosystem I, PSI) under oscillating light, on the relationship of the slow fluorescence increase (the so-called S to M rise, especially in the presence of diuron) in minute time scale with the so-called state-changes, and on the possibility of limited oxygen evolution in mixotrophic PSI (minus) mutants, up to 30 min, in the presence of glucose. We end this review with a brief discussion on the position of cyanobacteria in the evolution of photosynthetic systems.									47	0	0	0	36	0	48			1664-462X			WOS:000208837500028	22645530

In this article, the steps leading to photosynthetic O-2 evolution are discussed. Emphasis is given to the proton-coupled electron-transfer steps involved in oxidation of the manganese cluster by oxidized tyrosine Z (Y-Z), the function of Ca2+ and the mechanism by which water is activated for formation of an O-O bond. Based on a consideration of the biophysical studies of photosystem II and inorganic manganese model chemistry, a mechanism for photosynthetic O-2 evolution is presented in which the O-O bond-forming step occurs via nucleophilic attack on an electron-deficient Mn-v=O species by a calcium-bound water molecule. The proposed mechanism includes specific roles for the tetranuclear manganese cluster, calcium, chloride, Y-z and His190 of the D1 polypeptide. Recent studies of the ion selectivity of the calcium site in the O-2-evolving complex and of a functional inorganic manganese model system that test key aspects of this mechanism are also discussed.

The morphology and porosity of this heteroatom containing carbon were tuned by varying the Ni : Zn molar ratio in Ni/Zn ZIF-8 and Ni/Zn ZIF-8@g-C(3)N(4)composites. The template aided synthetic strategy using g-C(3)N(4)helped in the controlled decomposition of composites leading to a heteroporous sheet like architecture with increased nitrogen content. The Ni/Zn ZIF-8 sample on heat treatment in the 800-1000 degrees C temperature range led to the formation of Ni,N co-doped porous carbon (Ni-NPC) with Ni-C active sites. The defective sites induced by nickel carbide along with the distributed N atoms on the carbon surface enabled active O(2)adsorption sites. The high surface area, high degree of graphitisation as well as the defects created by well dispersed N and Ni on porous carbon matrices favoured charge separation leading to higher electrochemical ORR activity. The Ni,N co-doped carbon catalyst in alkaline medium exhibited a limiting current density of 5.2 mA cm(-2)with a half-wave potential of 0.76 Vvs.RHE in 0.1 M KOH. The catalyst also showed improved methanol tolerance and better stability compared to the standard Pt/C catalyst.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000550065200045

A novel activated carbon electrocatalyst derived from chicken feather rachis (RCF), a poultry industry bio-waste is explored for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysis. The rachis is the central stem from which the fibrous ramus is completely removed and it is more crystalline compared to feather ramus. Ni-trogen doped activated carbon (CNAx) electrocatalyst is prepared by chemical activation coupled pyrolysis. The chemical activators used include potassium hydroxide (KOH), phosphoric acid (H3PO4) and zinc chloride (ZnCl2) followed by pyrolysis at 500, 700 and 900 degrees C. Electrochemical performance has been evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) using a rotating disk electrode (RDE). KOH activated electrocatalyst exhibits remarkable improvement in surface area favouring improved onset potential (-0.02 V vs Ag/AgCl). This increased activity is due to increase in number of well-exposed ORR active sites on activation. The effect of chemical activators on the structure and morphology of the activated carbons are discussed using Raman spectroscopy, adsorption-desorption isotherm study, electron microscopic techniques, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and XPS studies. KOH activated CNAx-900 exhibits best combination of properties and confirms its feasibility to be a suitable electrocatalyst for PEMFC. Hence, RCF derived electrocatalysts are propitious alternates for ORR catalysis. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, an electrocatalyst of graphitic carbon nitride (gC(3)N(4)) nanosheet-supported Pt nanoparticles (NPs) is prepared for enhancing the durability of Pt-based electrocatalysts in HT-PEMFCs. Pt NPs are homogeneously dispersed on gC(3)N(4) nanosheets with an average particle size of 1.84 nm. Acid-treated carbon black was introduced to Pt/gC(3)N(4) as a conductive agent to increase the electron-transfer pathways on Pt surfaces, resulting in the Pt/gC(3)N(4)-C electrocatalyst. Electrochemical characterization is carried out with a rotating disk electrode in a 2 mol L-1 H3PO4 electrolyte. After an accelerated durability test of 5000 scanning cycles, the retained electrochemical surface area of Pt/gC(3)N(4)-C is 87.6%, significantly higher than that of commercial Pt/C (54%). Furthermore, a preliminary 100 h durability test is conducted in a practical HT-PEMFC. During the durability test, the voltage decay rate of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) with commercial Pt/C as the cathode electrocatalyst is 91 mu V h(-1), whereas no obvious drop is observed for the MEA with the prepared Pt/gC(3)N(4)-C as the cathode electrocatalyst. All the results indicate that Pt/gC(3)N(4)-C shows a robust durability compared with commercial Pt/C.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2168-0485			WOS:000543715400033

Ceramic foam devices coated with NiFe2O4/m-ZrO2 or pure CeO2 particles are prepared as a receiver/reactor operating a thermochemical water splitting cycle to produce hydrogen. The foam devices are examined in a directly irradiated receiver/reactor by a sun simulator on a laboratory scale. The purpose of this study is to examine the evolution of oxygen and hydrogen during the cyclization reaction different thermal-reduction (T-R) temperatures of 1450 and 1550 degrees C, and to compare the reproducible and stoichiometric oxygen/hydrogen production for both foam devices through a repeatable two-step reaction. In this study, a zirconia ceramic foam was used as a matrix for the reacting materials of NiFe2O4/m-ZrO2 or CeO2 particles. The zirconia ceramic foam has a diameter of 60 mm, a thickness of 15 mm, and a porosity of 10 cpi (cell number per linear inch). The loading amounts of reacting materials are 5 wt% for NiFe2O4/m-ZrO2 and 40 wt% for CeO2 particles. A concentrated Xe-beam is radiated to the foam device in a N-2 stream for the T-R step and in a N-2/steam gas mixture for the subsequent water-decomposition (W-D) step. (C) 2013 The Authors.

The prepared nano-structured lead dioxide films were ultimately aimed at producing cathodes with improved electrocatalytic activity and stability for the lead acid batteries. During the measurements, the potential waveform, which consisted of the potential step for electrodeposition and potential ramp, was continuously applied on a glassy carbon disk electrode. Different parameters such as step potential and its duration time, and also scan rate of continuous cyclic voltammetry were optimized to obtain higher capacity. Results comparison of the voltammetric experiments previously reported and those from laboratory-designed test cells have confirmed a higher charge/discharge performance of our electrodeposited samples towards the PbO2/PbSO4 transformation in aqueous sulfuric acid solutions. The enhanced characteristics of this sample is attributed to its special morphology due to formation of nano structure at high scan rates, as confirmed by SEM. Maximum current efficiency was observed when step potential and time were equal to 1400mV and 1700ms, respectively, at a scan rate of 4000 mVs(-1). Analysis of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data revealed that the charge transfer resistance is decreased by a change in scan rate as the FFT continuous cyclic voltammetric tests showed. A higher overpotential for oxygen evolution reaction was also observed for electrodes prepared in this electrochemical technique in sulfuric acid solution. The morphology of electrodeposited oxide are very different from those of oxide forming in lower scan rates, due to the high surface area obtained as well as high connectivity between particles resulted in increased discharge capacity.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1452-3981			WOS:000302723700066

Some photosynthetic microorganisms, such as green algae and cyanobacteria, can produce hydrogen gas from water by using solar energy. In green algae, hydrogen evolution is coupled to the photosynthetic electron transport in thylakoid membranes via reaction catalyzed by the specific enzyme, (FeFe)-hydrogenase. However, this enzyme is highly sensitive to oxygen and can be quickly inhibited when water splitting is active. A problem of incompatibility between the water splitting and hydrogenase reaction can be overcome by depletion of algal cells of sulfur which is essential element for life. In this review the mechanisms underlying sustained hydrogen photoproduction in sulfur deprived C. reinhardtii and the recent achievements in studying of this process are discussed. The attention is focused on the biophysical and physiological aspects of photosynthetic response to sulfur deficiency in green algae.									63	2	2	0	38	0	67			0175-7598	1432-0614		WOS:000285884200001	20878321

The prepared materials are characterized by X-ray diffraction transient-state photoluminescence spectra, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electrochemical experiment. These results show that the ternary composite material has longer lifetime of photogenerated carriers and more active sites, thereby enhancing photocatalytic performance. CdS quantum dots act as a bridge between the intermediate transport charges in the ternary composite. The oxygen defect engineering prolongs the lifetime of carriers obviously, which is confirmed by transient-state photoluminescence. Moreover, the photocatalytic H-2 evolution and photodegradation of bisphenol A for MoS2/CdS/g-C3N4 is up to 956 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) and 95.2% under visible-light irradiation, respectively. Furthermore, excellent photocatalytic activity can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of defect engineering and formation of ternary heterostructures, which is with broad-spectrum response, longer lifetime of photo-induced electron-holes, and more surface active sites.									81	8	0	0	13	0	83			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000459642200044	30720265

The unique precursor is firstly prepared by coordinating SCN- with Fe3+ ions adsorbed in situ into the polypyrrole matrixes (PPy-Fe3+) during an oxidative polymerization process. Subsequent pyrolysis of PPy-Fe3+-SCN- precursor produced the FeNx/S-NC catalyst containing the active sites of Fe-N-x and thiophene-like sulfur structures. Furthermore, FeNx/S-NC has a larger specific area than FeNx-NC catalyst without SCN- in the precursor. Meanwhile, depending on the presence of the thiophene-like sulfur structure, FeNx/S-NC shows a higher valence band (-7.27 eV) than that of FeNx-NC (-7.76 eV), leading to the smaller energy gap with the LUMO level of O-2. FeNx/S-NC catalyst has an excellent initial potential of 1.02 V and a half-wave potential of 0.90 V, achieving one of the highest catalytic activities based on Fe-N-C reported so far, and ORR catalyst in an alkaline environment. For the stability test, the FeNx/S-NC catalyst still maintains this 91% current density after 20000 s, which is also better than Pt/C. Finally, FeNx/S-NC employed as the cathode material for zinc-air battery, shows greater maximum peak power and specific capacity than Pt/C.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000784350400001

We find that the formation of an adsorbed superoxo species, *O-2(-), via the reaction O-2(gas) + e(-) -> *O-2(-), is barrierless, whereas the transfer of another electron to transform the superoxo into an adsorbed peroxide, i.e. *O-2(-) + e(-) -> *O-2(2-), is nonadiabatic and has a barrier of 0.3 eV. The origin of this nonadiabaticity is attributed to the instability of an intermediate where the second electron is localized at the superoxo adsorption site. These results can explain the experimental finding that O-2 is not an efficient electron scavenger in photocatalysis.									76	1	0	0	15	0	77			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000320899200061	23713953

The skarn zone with little or no retrograde stage is represented by fluid inclusions with high homogenization temperatures (up to >600 degrees C) and a wide range of salinity (12 to >70 wt.% NaCl). Pluton-derived fluids facilitated occurrence of continuous pro-grade reactions in the country rocks (particularly in the proximal zone) and oxygen isotopic depletion in calc-silicate and calcite minerals. delta O-18 of anhydrous minerals within proximal and distal zones indicate that skarn-forming fluids had a magmatic origin. The delta O-18 values are 5.93-9.08 parts per thousand (mean 6.8 parts per thousand) for garnet, 4.08-9.94 parts per thousand (mean 6.49 parts per thousand) for pyroxene, 4.89-7.927 parts per thousand (mean 6.4 parts per thousand) for wollastonite and 6.65-8.28 parts per thousand (mean 7.5 parts per thousand) for vesuvianite. Temperatures estimated by isotopic compositions of mineral pairs are significantly lower than those measured from the fluid inclusions, indicating that isotopic equilibrium is not preserved between the skarn minerals. delta O-18 and delta O-13 values are systematically depleted from marbles to skarn carbonates. Calc-silicate forming reactions and permeability increase triggered by volatilization and consequent strong infiltration of H2O-rich siliceous fluids into the system promoted fluid-rock interaction causing isotopic resetting and isotopic depletion of silicates (e.g. pyroxene and wollastonite) and skarn calcites.

Compared with either single MoSe2@MoS2, the MoSe2@MoS2 electrocatalyst exhibits better electrocatalytic activity with a small Tafel slope (60 mV dec(-1)) and a low onset overpotential (-161 mV). The good HER activity is attributed to its core-shell nanostructure, which can not only efficaciously suppress the aggregation of MoS2 nanosheets, but also generate more active sites and produce a synergistic effect of the two components in the HER.

Porous Co-MOF/CF and defective CoMoO4/CF are used as structure-inducing templates to introduce rich defects and large voids that facilitate the formation of amorphous a-CoMoPx/CF. Theoretical calculations reveal a synergistic catalytic mechanism that is based on the bimetallic components. Hierarchical nanosheet arrays combined with amorphous structures provide a superior mass transfer capacity and fully exposed atoms, increasing the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA). The structural advantages and the synergistic catalytic effect of the bimetallic components generate a-CoMoPx/CF with excellent catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), displaying a very low overpotential of 59 mV and delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)under alkaline conditions. A full electrolysis apparatus with a-CoMoPx/CF as both cathode and anode shows a catalytic performance comparable to that of a noble metal-based catalyst set-up (Pt/C-CF // RuO2-CF), achieving 10 mA cm(-2)at a potential of 1.581 V and stable operation at 100 mA cm(-2)for more than 100 h. These findings provide a novel concept to design stable structured catalysts based on earth-abundant elements for the large-scale application of electrocatalysis processes related to energy conversion technologies.									59	1	0	0	4	0	59			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000565548000001

The sluggish kinetic characteristics of cathode oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are still the bottleneck of the crucial skill. Until now, the exploitation of high ORR performance nanocatalysts has been the most effective strategy to the commercial of PEMFCs. Hence, more attention is paid to preciously tuning the surface/interface electronic structure and optimizing the intermediate species of adsorption energy of nanocatalysts to improve the ORR performance. Herein, performance-construction engineering is introduced in terms of surface strain, defect site (adsorption site/coordination number effect), and crystal facet for Pt-based catalysts. The physical synergy between Pt-based and carbon-based catalysts is also systematically reported focusing on ordered and mesoporous carbon, physical encapsulated carbon, metal carbides, carbon-containing polymer, etc. for ORR mainly in acidic environment. The understanding, construction, and application of the ORR active sites combined the carbon-based and platinum-based catalysts are deeply concluded in low-temperature PEMFCs, as well as part of high-temperature PEMFCs under acidic environment. The doping strategy and the strong interaction are highlighted introduced to enhance the intrinsic activity and the apparent activity. Furthermore, to study the complex active sites of catalysts and the corresponding compositional and structural evolution, the structure-activity relationships are further depicted coupled with the existing advanced in situ characterization technology. Finally, the potential prospects and challenges for the two types of electrocatalysts are summarized to shed a new light for the development of ORR catalysts in commercial applications.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10				2639-4979		WOS:000752841700001

The electrode characterization, reaction mechanism, degradation performance, and toxicity assessment were studied. In contrast to the conventional Ti/SnO2-Sb2O3/alpha,beta-PbO2 electrode, our prepared Co-doped PbO2 electrode showed the characteristics of more compact surface, smaller crystal size, higher oxygen evolution potential (OEP) and an increased yield of center dot OH concentration. The application of Co-doped PbO2 electrode for the electrochemical oxidation of NOR was systematically analyzed. The optimal operating parameters were found to be Na2SO4 concentration of 0.1 mol L-1, initial NOR concentration of 50 mg L-1, initial pH of 5 and current density of 20 mA cm(-2). Under these conditions, NOR, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) removals reached 85.29%, 43.65% and 41.89% after 60 min of electrolysis, respectively. Through the intermediates detected during the electrochemical treatment process, a reaction pathway involving decarboxylation, defluorination and piperazine ring-opening was proposed. Finally, the toxicity assessment of the treated NOR solution towards Vibrio fischeri rapidly fell to non-toxicity and even reached to negative values after 50 min of electrolysis, indicating that electrochemical oxidation of NOR is an effective approach to reduce its toxicity to environmental ecosystem.

It describes the evolution of a complex chemical system with acceptable accuracy with a number of rate controlling constraints on the associated constrained-equilibrium states of the system, much lower than the number of species in the underlying detailed kinetic model (DKM). Successful approximation of the constrained-equilibrium states requires accurate identification of the constraints. One promising procedure is the fully automatable Approximate Singular Value Decomposition of the Actual Degrees of Disequilibrium (ASVDADD) method that is capable of identifying the best constraints for a given range of thermodynamic conditions and a required level of approximation. ASVDADD is based on simple algebraic analysis of the results of the underlying DKM simulation and is focused on the behavior of the degrees of disequilibrium (DoD) of the individual chemical reactions. In this paper, we introduce an alternative ASVDADD algorithm. Unlike the original ASVDADD algorithm that require the direct computation of the DKM-derived DoDs and the identification of the set of linearly independent reactions, in the alternative algorithm, the components of the overall degree of disequilibrium vector can be computed directly by casting the DKM as an RCCE simulation considering a set of linearly independent constraints equaling the number of chemical species in size. The effectiveness and robustness of the derived constraints from the alternative procedure is examined in hydrogen/oxygen and methane/oxygen ignition delay simulations and the results are compared with those obtained from DKM.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0195-0738	1528-8994		WOS:000678655400020

The effects of combined A/B sites defects on polarization hysteresis and electric-induced-strain properties of materials were explored. It is shown that single pseudocubic structure is revealed in all samples. Substitution leads to downward shift of the ferroelectric-relaxor transition temperature and increase in strain. Meanwhile, the samples exhibit high strain of 0.458% and inverse piezoelectric coefficient d(33)(*) of 770 pm/V, accompanied by an increased fraction of relaxor phase during fatigue test. The anomalies in temperature dependent dielectrics and hysteresis loops are highly related to the formation of A/B sites defect dipoles which mediated by oxygen vacancies in stoichiometric ceramics.									2	2	0	0	0	0	3			1000-324X			WOS:000439101800016

However, graphene and graphene oxide are electrocatalytically inert in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to their electronic properties. Herein, for the first time, we report a highly active and stable graphene oxide electrocatalyst for the HER. The graphene oxide-encapsulated IrNi alloy catalyst (IrNi@OC) was prepared via the pyrolysis of Ir-doped Ni-BTC, which exhibited an excellent electrocatalytic activity for the HER, achieving 100 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 95 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 10 mA cm(-2) at 27 mV in 1 M KOH. Furthermore, these results are superior to those of commercial Pt/C. DFT calculations revealed that electrons were transferred from the IrNi alloy core to the graphene shell, and this process became more facile when graphene was decorated with O species, which tuned the electronic structure of the carbon atoms and made them favorable for the formation of C-H bonds, thereby decreasing the Delta G(H*) for the HER.									20	1	0	0	0	0	20			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000473054500012

The activity and durability of these catalysts in membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) are greatly dependent on the surface and bulk properties of the catalyst material, integration with ionomer, and the three-dimensional structure of the electrode, necessitating extensive characterization of the catalyst in the electrode at multiple scales. In this work, extended surface PtNi nanowire-based electrocatalysts derived by spontaneous galvanic displacement, and post-treated to obtain high specific and mass activities, are characterized by X-ray spectroscopies to assess catalyst composition and to determine the extent of Pt-Ni alloying. Transmission X-ray microscopy (TXM) is used to generate two- and three-dimensional images of catalyst layers with varied compositions within the electrode to show the distribution of nanowires and to study Ni dissolution and redeposition within the electrode. These techniques are complemented by electron microscopy, which is used to confirm leaching of nickel from the nanowires and its redeposition within the electrode. This process is shown to have detrimental effect on the MEA performance, which can be at least in part recovered by soaking electrodes in acid. The combination of these techniques provides unprecedented detail of the evolution of the nanowire-based extended surface catalyst and electrode structure guiding the targeted design of high performance electrodes based on this class of materials.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2574-0970			WOS:000464491500057

An electrocatalyst composed of Pt nanoparticles supported on WC nanorods demonstrates higher electrocatalytic activity for methanol electro-oxidation, better tolerance to CO poisoning, and superior performance for cathodic electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution than a Pt/C catalyst. This work provides a novel method to synthesize high-surface-area nanorod-structured WC materials by preparing oxide precursors with the desired external morphology, thus offering great potential for a broad range of applications of these materials in related reaction systems.									57	7	0	0	6	0	59			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000310600600015	22829441

Electrolytic water splitting is an effective technique for generating molecular hydrogen. However, for hydrogen to be a viable alternative energy source to be produced from water electrolysis, affordable and durable electrocatalysts need to be developed to replace platinum. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a promising alternative since they are abundant, inexpensive, and have a tunable structure. There are various ways to produce TMD films including chemical and mechanical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and electrodeposition. Exfoliation and CVD techniques often require a transfer of TMDs from the growth substrate to an electrode, which introduces impurities and possible defects to the film. Electrodeposition, however, provides a way to produce TMDs directly onto the electrode with excellent surface coverage. This work uses electrodeposition to produce TMD and TMD bilayer electrodes using sequential electrodeposition for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The results presented include cost-effective deposition techniques along with enhanced proton reduction activity for the sequentially deposited bilayer TMD structure consisting of MoS2 and MoSe2, which suggests the electron transfer kinetics from the conductive glass substrate to the top-layer is enhanced with a MoS2 layer. Furthermore, the bilayer structures synthesized by sequential deposition are characterized via XPS, XPS depth-profiling, and SEM-EDS for enhanced understanding of the fabricated structure.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000751069400001

Ni ions were first incorporated into melamine before thermal polymerization. The morphologies of g-C3N4 from nanosheets to irregular tubular structure was created because of the effect of Ni atoms. The photo- and electro-chemical performance depended strongly on the morphologies of g-C3N4. Irregular tubular sample NCN675 with multiple scattering effect of light exhibited fast degradation for Rh B under visible light with a maximum degradation rate constant of 0.046 min?1. Electrocatalysis test indicates that NCN680 as N-doped carbon nanotubes with excellent electrocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen evolution rate (HER and OER), in which Tafel slopes of HER and OER are 111 and 107 mV/dec respectively. In addition, charge discharge test of supercapacitor confirms that NCN680 is the most suitable electrode material for supercapacitors and have larger specific capacitance (SC = 203.95F/g) when its current density is 1A/g.

Here, we show that enzymes can also be extremely efficient electrocatalysts (catalysts of redox reactions at electrodes). Despite being large and electronically insulating through most of their volume, some enzymes, when attached to an electrode, catalyze electrochemical reactions that are otherwise extremely sluggish (even with the best synthetic catalysts) and require a large overpotential to achieve a useful rate. These enzymes produce high electrocatalytic currents, displayed in single bidirectional voltammetric waves that switch direction (between oxidation and reduction) sharply at the equilibrium potential for the substrate redox couple. Notoriously irreversible processes such as CO(2) reduction are thereby rendered electrochemically reversible-a consequence of molecular evolution responding to stringent biological drivers for thermodynamic efficiency. Enzymes thus set high standards for the catalysts of future energy technologies.									239	3	0	0	70	0	239			0027-8424			WOS:000294163500042	21844379

MXenes-SnO2/Ti electrodes are fabricated by spin-coating followed by a thermal treatment under ambient atmospheric conditions using a solution containing MXene nano-sheets, SnCl2, citric acid and ethylene glycol as precursor. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and Xray diffraction analyses of the MXenes-SnO2/Ti electrodes surface indicate the formation of SnO2-TiO2 films with Ti4+ ions incorporated into the lattice of SnO2 crystals. Cyclic voltammetry curves demonstrate that the oxygen evolution reaction is restrained by the MXenes-SnO2/Ti electrodes, while the methyl red electro-oxidation is enhanced - with kinetics following a pseudo-first-order model compared to the performance of (pure) SnO2/Ti electrodes. These results suggest that oxygen vacancies are formed in the crystal lattice of MXenes-SnO2/Ti electrodes, which act as charge carriers and increase the electrical conductivity of SnO2 as confirmed by the lower charge transfer resistance of MXenes-SnO2/Ti electrodes determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1452-3981			WOS:000661483700017

Here, the durability of a novel iridium catalyst with a low iridium packing density, allowing for low iridium loadings without decreasing the electrode thickness, is being investigated in a 10-cell PEM water electrolyzer short stack. The anodes of the membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) of the first five cells utilize a conventional iridium catalyst, at loadings that serve as benchmark for today's industry standard (2 mg(Ir) cm(-2)). The last five cells utilize the novel catalyst at 8-fold lower loadings (0.25 mg(Ir) cm(-2)). The MEAs are based on Nafion (R) 117 and are tested for 3700 h by load cycling between 0.2 and 2.0 A cm(-2), with weekly polarization curves and impedance diagnostics. For both catalysts, the performance degradation at low current densities is dominated by an increase of the overpotential for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), whereby the OER mass activity of the novel catalyst remains approximate to 4-fold higher after 3700 h. The temporal evolution of the OER mass activities of the two catalysts will be analyzed in order to assess the suitability of the novel catalyst for industrial application. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

The photooxidative self-assembly of the Mn4CaO5 cluster, termed photoactivation, utilizes the same highly oxidizing species that drive the water oxidation in order to drive the incorporation of Mn2+ into the high-valence Mn4CaO5 cluster. This multistep process proceeds with low quantum efficiency, involves a molecular rearrangement between light-activated steps, and is prone to photoinactivation and misassembly. A sensitive polarographic technique was used to track the assembly process under flash illumination as a function of the constituent Mn2+ and Ca2+ ions in genetically engineered membranes of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 to elucidate the action of Ca2+ and peripheral proteins. We show that the protein scaffolding organizing this process is allosterically modulated by the assembly protein Psb27, which together with Ca2+ stabilizes the intermediates of photoactivation, a feature especially evident at long intervals between photoactivating flashes. The results indicate three critical metal-binding sites: two Mn and one Ca, with occupation of the Ca site by Ca2+ critical for the suppression of photoinactivation. The long-observed competition between Mn2+ and Ca2+ occurs at the second Mn site, and its occupation by competing Ca2+ slows the rearrangement. The relatively low overall quantum efficiency of photoactivation is explained by the requirement of correct occupancy of these metal-binding sites coupled to a slow restructuring of the protein ligation environment, which are jointly necessary for the photooxidative trapping of the first stable assembly intermediate.									17	0	0	0	14	0	17			0027-8424			WOS:000590738600014	33106422

In this study, the nanostructured morphology of multinary CuCo2S4 and CuCo2S4 was tuned using a different volume concentration of water and ethanol resulting in different nano-shapes maintaining similar crystal structure. The electrocatalytic performance was analyzed for all the synthesized samples as the hydrogen (HER) and oxygen evolution catalyst (OER). The HER and OER study for CuCo2S4 sample synthesized using ethanol required a low overpotential of 158 mV to reach 10 mA/cm(2) and 290 mV to achieve 20 mA/cm(2) , respectively. Furthermore, the electrolyzer cell using symmetrical electrodes required a low overall cell potential of 1.66 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) and maintained stable performance for over 24 h, suggesting a promising bifunctional catalytic behavior. Furthermore, the synthesized samples were studied as electrodes for high-performance energy storage systems. The CuCo2S4 electrode showed an areal capacitance of 6.3 F/cm(2) (3190.8 F/g) at a current density of 2 mA/cm(2) . The Ragone plot for the areal energy versus power density resulted to be 265 mWh/cm(2) (132 Wh/kg) and 11.9 W/cm(2) (5973 W/kg), respectively. Thus, from the overall study, it can be confirmed that tailoring morphology of nanostructured material such as CuCo2S4 could be a promising way for the advancement of energy generation and storage devices.

The nanostructure, morphology and chemical/electronic structure were characterized using various complementary methods, including X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning transmission X-ray microscopy. The presence of both reductive and oxidative surface states was evidenced and their impact on the photoelectrochemical efficiency was characterized. We show that both electronic conduction enhancement provided by the Ti substitution and charge transfer promoted by oxidative surface states improve the solar water splitting performance.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000578872600025

This report describes findings of an investigation of the heteroatomic dopant-activity relationship for Co3O4/doped CNTs catalysts with different heteroatoms including N, O, and P atoms in ORR. By using an array of techniques to probe the structure and elementary valence of the catalysts, the incorporation of the Co3O4 nanoparticles can introduce defects into the doped CNTs, especially the N-CNTs, which should contribute to the generation of active sites. The Co3O4/N-CNTs are shown to exhibit both the highest ORR activity and stability compared with Co3O4/O-CNTs, Co3O4/P-CNTs, and Co3O4/CNTs, manifesting the synergistic correlation of Co3O4 nanoparticles, heteroatoms, and CNTs. This kind of synergy is assessed by density functional theory calculations based on the electronic properties and molecular orbitals. It is found that N, O, or P atoms can tune the charge distribution of CNTs by decreasing the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital-highest occupied molecular orbital energy gap, thus activating the adjacent C atoms. And the addition of Co3O4 will further redistribute the charge of CNTs from CNTs to Co3O4 toward enhanced ORR activity. Moreover, the Co3O4/N-CNTs catalyst exhibits a maximum structural stability due to the strong electronic interaction between Co2+ ions and N atoms, which is believed to result in its high ORR stability. Analysis of the results, along with a combined theoretical and experimental study, has provided implications for the design of catalysts with controlled activity and stability for ORR.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000506719300043	31833358

In situ stress measurements are made using the cantilever-deflection method, and nanogravimetric measurements are made using an electrochemical quartz crystal nanobalance. Upon dealloying via successive voltammetric sweeps between -0.05 and 1.15 V vs standard hydrogen electrode, compressive stress develops in the dealloyed Pt layer at the surface of thin-film PtCu electrodes. The dealloyed films also exhibit enhanced catalytic activity toward ORR compared with polycrystalline Pt. In situ nanogravimetric measurements reveal that the mass of dealloyed Cu is approximately 210 +/- 46 ng/cm(2), which corresponds to a dealloyed layer thickness of 1.2 +/- 0.3 monolayers or 0.16 +/- 0.04 nm. The average biaxial stress in the dealloyed layer is estimated to be 4.95 +/- 1.3 GPa, which corresponds to an elastic strain of 1.47% +/- 0.4%. In addition, density functional theory calculations have been carried out on biaxially strained Pt(111) surface to characterize the effect of strain on its ORR activity; the predicted shift in the limiting potentials due to elastic strain is found to be in good agreement with the experimental shift in the cyclic voltammograms for the dealloyed PtCu thin film electrodes.									27	1	0	0	2	0	28			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000360026200024

Volume 3: General Paper Selections								299	306						2009	2009	The effect of varying oxygen content in the nitrogen atmosphere during successive stages of vapor infiltration on the microstructural evolution and physical properties of TiC/TiN porous ceramic composites was investigated. Composites were processed via the hybrid precursor system chemical vapor deposition (HYSYCVD) and direct nitridation (DN) routes. TiCp porous preforms were infiltrated in subsequent stages: S1-1 and S1-2 at 1300degC for 70 min in high purity nitrogen (HPN); S2 at 1350degC for 120 min in ultra high purity nitrogen (UHPN). The composites were characterized by XRD, SEM, He picnometry, volume-measurement approach and immersion in Hg. The study was complemented with thermodynamic analyses using the FactSageTrade program and databases. Results show that the presence of O2, NH3 and silicon-fluoride gaseous species throughout consecutive stages of processing affect the amount, morphology and distribution of TiN formed. Formation of TiN is ascribed to a combined effect of DN and HYSYCVD mechanisms.

Furthermore, the various weight ratios of NiOx (1:5 and 3:2) are explored to optimize the study. NiOx nanoparticles avoid corrosion on the n-GaN surface, decrease the solar water-splitting reaction overpotential, and enhance the photocurrent density at a working electrode applied bias of 1 V in the two-electrode system. Finally, in the stability test, the hydrogen evolution rate of NiOx (3:2) is more effective than that of pristine n-GaN even after 5 h. These results indicate that NiOx nanoparticle-decorated n-GaN gains higher photostability and hydrogen production performance in PEC cells.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0927-0248	1879-3398		WOS:000571735600002

However, the water-oxidation is the bottleneck for this important reaction. Thus, finding more details of water-oxidation mechanism leads to design more efficient water-splitting catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Herein, an aluminum-free manganese incorporated ZSM-5 type zeolite is synthesized and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Raman spectroscopy, UV Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and N-2 physical adsorption analysis. The water-oxidizing activity of the synthesized sample is studied in the presence of ammonium cerium(IV) nitrate as an oxidant. Water-oxidation experiments confirm that direct cooperation between Mn ions is one of the most important factors for the water-oxidation by Mn oxides. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Herein, a novel two-step synthesis strategy is developed to synthesize metal-organic framework (MOF) derived nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) with improved spatial isolation and a higher loading amount of cobalt (Co) and nickel carbide (Ni3C) nanocrystal decorated on graphene (denoted as Co@NC-Ni3C/G). Benefiting from multiple active sites of high N-doping level, uniform dispersion of Co and Ni3C nanocrystals, and a large active area of graphene, the Co@NC-Ni3C/G hybrids exhibit excellent methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) efficiency in an alkaline environment. For MOR, the opti-mized Co@NC-Ni3C/G-350 catalyst achieved a current density of 44.8 mA cm(-2) at an applied potential of 1.47 V (V vs. RHE), which is significantly higher than Co@NC-Ni3C (42.07 mA cm(-2)) and Co@NC (24.1 mA cm(-2)) in 0.5 M methanol + 1.0 M KOH solutions. In addition, during the CO retention test, the Co@NC-Ni3C/G-350 catalyst exhibits excellent CO tolerance capacity. Excitingly, the as-prepared Co@NC-Ni3C/G-350 hybrid exhibits significantly improved ORR catalytic efficiency in terms of positive onset and half-wave potential (E-onset = 0.90 V, E-1/2 = 0.830 V vs. RHE), small Tafel slope (34 mV dec(-1))									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-9797	1095-7103		WOS:000810414800009	35660914

Experiments were conducted in CO/CO2 gas mixtures with and without hydrogen at two different oxygen partial pressures. Ore in the size fraction 9.52-15 mm was reduced in a thermogravimetric furnace, and the O/Mn ratio from the chemical analysis was used to determine the extent of prereduction. The samples were investigated by X-ray diffraction to investigate the evolution of phases under the course of reduction. The X-ray diffraction revealed that bixbyite and braunite (I and II) were reduced to manganosite with no or limited formation of hausmannite. Reduction of iron oxides subsided with wustite, which is stabilized by manganese in the monoxide phase, and hydrogen was seen to improve the reduction of iron oxides. Modeling revealed that the reduction rate increased 2.8-fold upon increasing the CO content from 30% to 70% in a CO/CO2 gas mixture. The addition of hydrogen improved the reduction rate with factors of 1.3 and 2.6 for the low and the high oxygen partial pressures, respectively. Hence, the optimal conditions for pretreatment can be achieved by keeping the oxygen partial pressure as low as possible while adding hydrogen to the reducing gas and ensuring a high reduction temperature. Successful pretreatment limits the extent of the Boudouard reaction in the submerged arc furnace, reducing the amount of CO produced and, thus, reducing the CO available for pretreatment. Hydrogen is a useful addition to the pretreatment unit since it lowers the oxygen partial pressure and improves the kinetics of prereduction.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2075-163X		WOS:000711305000001

Because of the toxicity of this compound its use is restricted within the European Union to time limited authorization by REACH. Therefore, an alternative to sodium dichromate is essential to maintain, or even increase the process efficiency.The addition of cerium (III) salts to a hypochlorite solution increases the cathodic selectivity towards hydrogen evolution (HER), the preferred cathode process in industrial chlorate production. This is attributed to the deposition of a thin cerium oxide/hydroxide coating on the cathode, induced by the increased local alkalinity during electrolysis.Performing the electrodeposition of such protective coating ex situ, well-controlled coating thickness can be achieved. Optimizing the deposition conditions (time, current density), a coherent and stable coating is formed on the electrode surface. On this protected electrode surface the electrochemical reduction of hypochlorite is suppressed by ca. 90% compared to the bare Pt electrode, while the HER proceeds with high selectivity and unchanged kinetics. Interestingly, other electrochemical reactions (O-2 reduction, H2O2 reduction and oxidation) are also suppressed by the protective coating, suggesting that the deposited layer acts as an inorganic membrane on the electrode surface.

The experiments were carried out in NaCl and Na2SO4 as supporting electrolytes with initial concentration of 0.1 mM of NBB. The studied parameters were pH, applied current, concentration of Fenton catalyst, concentration of supporting electrolytes, and Cl-/SOa mixture. The degradation of NBB was almost total when NaCl was used compared to Na2SO4, thanks to the electro-generated active chlorine (HClO/ClO-). The higher degradation is found with EF compared to AO-H2O2 process, the kinetic of degradation of NBB always follows a pseudo first-order reaction. The optimum conditions for the mineralization of NBB (i.e., 0.1 mM NBB, 50 mM Na2SO4 at pH 3.0, 0.1 mM Fe2+, and a current of 300 mA) were determined. These conditions yielded a total color removal in less than 10 min and 98% of total organic carbon (TOC) removal at 120 min electrolysis time. The biochemical oxygen demand/ Chemical oxygen demand (BOD/COD) ratio was decreased from 0.5 to 0.3, during the same timescales. Whereas, the mineralization current efficiency (MCE%) dropped from 21.5% to 0.05% in the electrolysis time range from 15-120 min suggesting the concomitant parasitic reactions. The evolution of nitrite NO2-, nitrate NO3-, ammonium NH4+, and sulfate SOa concentrations were also followed as the end-products during the electrolysis.									9	0	0	0	4	0	9			2213-2929	2213-3437		WOS:000615231800001

Here we constructed a novel Ni12P5-Ni2P polymorphs catalyst (Ni-P/Ni/NF) through a successive hydrothermal treatment and annealing process on deliberately coarsened nickel foam (Ni/NF) support. Our experimental and theoretical studies demonstrate the application of Ni/NF is key to rendering a unique hierarchical porous architecture with Ni12P5Ni2P heterostructures, which not only increases the number of active sites but also enhances the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. Such a unique structure endows Ni-P/Ni/NF with low overpotentials of 129, 83, and 112 mV (at current density of 10 mA cm(-2)) for HER in alkaline, acidic and neutral media, respectively, which surpasses many of reported state-of-the-art nonprecious HER catalysts. This work presents a valuable route for designing and fabricating inexpensive and high-performance catalysts for electrocatalysis and beyond.									57	3	0	0	3	0	59			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000591693100005

The oxygen isotope ratios of individual chondrules and isolated grains show a wide variation in delta O-18 from -9.9 parts per thousand to +9.1 parts per thousand along the carbonaceous chondrite anhydrous mineral (CCAM) and primitive chondrule mineral (PCM) lines. The Delta O-17 (= delta O-17-0.52 x delta O-18) values of the measured objects increase with decreasing Mg#; i.e., FeO-poor objects (Mg# > 90; type I chondrules and isolated forsterites) mainly have Delta O-17 values of ca. -6%, and FeO-rich objects (Mg# < 90; type II chondrules and isolated olivines) have Delta O-17 values ranging from -3 parts per thousand to +2 parts per thousand. Similar trends are observed for ferromagnesian silicate particles from comet Wild2 and CR chondrite chondrules, particularly in terms of FeO-rich objects with Delta O-17 values ranging from -3 parts per thousand to + 2 parts per thousand. It is suggested that FeO-rich objects formed in the outer regions of the asteroid belt and were transported to the outer solar nebular regions where comet Wild2 formed.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1873-9652	1876-4428		WOS:000427579100004

In this study, a simple and general strategy is demonstrated for the synthesis of a polymer-derived, heteroatom-doped carbon supporting MoS2-MoP nanosheets (MoS2-MoP/C), which acts as an efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst. The unique composition of the MoS2-MoP/C enables catalysis of HER, demonstrating a Tafel slope of 58 mV dec(-1) and overpotentials of 102 mV and 130 mV, and is therefore able to deliver current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) and 20 mA cm(-2), respectively. Moreover, the MoS2-MoP/C nanosheets demonstrate superior long-term durability in acid electrolytes and the developed strategy is easily adapted to large-scale production of efficient electrocatalysts. This excellent HER performance is likely attributed to electronic interactions between P and S, a relatively-high specific surface area of the electrocatalyst (162 m(2) g(-1)), the characteristic nanosheet morphology, and high electrical conductivity, which promotes rapid charge transport and collection.									89	5	0	0	4	0	89			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000419188300034

In this work, the electrocatalysts based on N and S co-doped carbon nanofibers with embedded candle soot and designed surface decoration of NiCo and NiCo2S4 nanoparticles (NiCo/NiCo2S4@CNS-800) were fabricated by electrospinning technology and subsequent pyrolysis processes. The obtained NiCo/NiCo2S4@CNS-800 exhibited a positive half-wave potential of 0.80 V and a small Tafel slope of 60 mV dec(-1) for ORR. Moreover, it also delivered a low potential of 1.60 V at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 85 mV dec(-1) for OER. The low potential deviation (Delta E) of 0.8 V between the half-wave potential for ORR and the potential at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER revealed the outstanding bifunctional electrocatalytic activities of NiCo/NiCo2S4 @CNS-800. The superior behaviors of NiCo/NiCo2S4 @CNS-800 could be mainly attributed to the synergistic effects of the embedded candle soot, decorated NiCo and NiCo2S4 nanoparticles, continuous fibrous networks and incorporated N and S dopants, which could prevent the aggregation of decorated nanoparticles, increase the active sites, enhance the mass transfer and promote the surface adsorption, respectively. This work will provide a new perspective to design and fabricate the high-performance and low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts for further promising applications. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Yamamoto, Y.; Suemitsu, M.								A Study on the Initial Oxidation Process of the Si(110) Surface								Record of Electrical and Communication Engineering Conversazione Tohoku University				78	1			425	6						Sept. 2009	2009	Kinetics in the initial oxidation of the Si(110)-16times2 clean surface has been studied by using synchrotron-radiation photoemission spectroscopy (SR-PES). By observing the Si 2p core-level, we found that energetically meta-stable oxygen agglomerates are formed on the Si(110) surface at room temperature. After a 300degC annealing, these oxygen agglomerates turn into stable oxide. Time evolutions of the suboxide components in the Si 2p core-level during 600degC oxidation indicate dominance of the Si3+ species during formation of the 1st layer oxide. Taking into account the crystallographic structure of the Si(110) surface, we conclude that the initial thermal oxidation of the Si(110) surface proceeds with a non-ideal layer-by-layer manner.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0385-7719			INSPEC:11384946

In the present study, the density-functional theory (DFT) is employed to theoretically explore the mechanism of the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of methane on acid-promoted metal (Mo or W) oxides and carbide/zeolite catalysts. Various possible models of the catalyst are proposed. The structures of intermediate fragments together with CHx species that adsorbed on the catalysts were optimized and analyzed. The results suggest that the transition metal species located on the bridged hydroxyl groups, Si(OH)Al of zeolites, is the activation center competent to cleave C-H bonds. Methane activation proceeds through the initial overlap of electron density of methane with vacant d-orbitals of the metallo-center of the catalyst, followed by the formation of a transition state in which a H-H bond distance is noticeably shortened. At last, a hydrogen molecule is eliminated and a bound carbene is then shaped. The H-2 evolution sequence can be described in a stepwise reaction: CH4 + catalyst --> H4C-catalyst --> H2C-catalyst + H-2. The transition state of the adsorbed methane has a three-center-two-electron (2e-3c) bond, which is believed to be a key feature during the cleavage of two C-H bonds in the dehydrogenation process. The adsorbed CHx species on the models of catalyst MoCx[Si(O)Al] are comparable to pseudo-carbonium ions; Despite of the apparent differences in later stages, the initial steps in the dehydrogenation of methane on the MOxCy/HZSM-5 (M = Mo or W) catalysts share intrinsic properties with those of methane activation reactions in superacids.									26	7	0	0	0	0	29			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000087003200022

However, their insufficient catalytic sites and poor conductivity hamper the HER performance. Herein, an oxygen, phosphorus dual-doped ultrathin C3N4 nanosheet (O, P-CNS) is synthesized through a two-step method without a liquid solution, including calcination under air and subsequent chemical vapor deposition (CVD) with sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2) in N-2 atmosphere. The first thermal treatment in the air atmosphere results in the introduction of O dopant on the edge of C3N4 and the exfoliation of bulk C3N4 into ultrathin nanosheets. The following P incorporation contributes to the activation of the basal plane of C3N4 and the improvement of the intrinsic electronic conductivity, thus giving rise to the facilitated H-2 generation rate. Particularly, a superior H-2 generation rate of 8.7 mmol g(-1) h(-1) under visible light and an apparent quantum yield of 23.65% with 420 nm could be realized after the two-step dual-doping-induced calcination, further confirming the enhanced charge separation with the full activation of the edge and basal plane catalytic sites of C3N4. Our work on dual-doping-induced catalytic site activation on the edge and basal plane of C3N4 will provide more guidance in the field of designing C3N4-based photocatalysts.									45	2	0	0	8	0	46			2168-0485			WOS:000535305600027

Noble metal-free cocatalysts play a vital role in HER applications. Herein, a novel strategy to prepare a Ni2P/MoS2 cocatalyst through a simple hydrothermal-phosphorization method was reported, and the prepared cocatalyst was then loaded on an N-doped carbon substrate with excellent conductive performance. The large surface area of the carbon substrate provided many active sites, and the interface between Ni2P and MoS2 improved the catalytic performance for the HER. Compared with pure Ni2P catalyst and MoS2 catalyst, the prepared Ni2P/MoS2 cocatalyst exhibited enhanced catalytic performance. In addition, the results indicate that the prepared cocatalyst has a wide pH range and low onset potential values of 280, 350 and 40 mV in acidic, phosphate-buffered saline and alkaline solutions, respectively, and the corresponding Tafel slopes are 75, 121 and 95 mV dec(-1), respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) was adopted to calculate the hydrogen adsorption free energy (Delta G(H*)). The results showed that the interface between Ni2P and MoS2 reduced Delta G(H*), which was beneficial to the adsorption of hydrogen. Present preparation of cocatalysts with unique interfaces provides a new strategy for improving the catalytic performance of HER.

Here, we evaluate the effect of hydrogen and oxygen partial pressures in vacuum on the tribological response of steel pins sliding against films consisting of silicon- and oxygen-containing a-C:H (a-C:H:Si:O). Experiments are conducted in the low-friction/low-wear regime, where sufficient gas pressure prevents steel from adhering to the a-C:H:Si:O, with the velocity accommodation mode being interfacial sliding between the tribotrack formed in the a-C:H:Si:O film and the carbonaceous tribofilm that is formed on the countersurface. The experiments indicated a decrease (increase) in friction and wear with the hydrogen (oxygen) pressure (hydrogen pressures between 50 and 2000 mbar; oxygen pressures between 10 and 1000 mbar). Characterization by X-ray photoelectron and absorption spectroscopies indicated the occurrence of tribologically induced rehybridization of carbon-carbon bonds from sp(3) to sp(2). This mechanically induced structural transformation coincided with the dissociative surface reaction between hydrogen (oxygen) gas molecules and sp(2) carbon-carbon bonds that are highly strained, which results in the formation of carbon-hydrogen groups (carbonyl or ether groups together with silicon atoms having higher oxidation states). On the basis of variations of the fraction of these surface functional groups with gas pressure, a phenomenological model is proposed for the gas pressure dependence of friction for steel when sliding on a-C:H:Si:O films: while the decrease in friction with hydrogen pressure is induced by an increase in the percentage of carbon-hydrogen groups, the increase in friction with oxygen pressure is caused by a progressive increase in the relative fraction of silicon atoms having higher oxidation states and an increase in surface oxygen concentration.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000630398500109	33656848

Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and diffuse reflectance spectroscopies (DRS) were utilized to monitor changes in the electronic structures of both intrinsic defects (oxygen vacancies and/or Ti3+) and extrinsic dopants (Cr3+) at different reduction temperatures. We identify the existence of two temperature regimes where changes occur within 30 min. The first temperature regime occurs between 300-375 degrees C and results in (1) reduction of oxygen-related surface defects, and (2) an increase in the concentration of Cr3+ by over an order of magnitude, suggesting that EPR-silent Cr4+ or Cr6+ is being reduced to Cr3+ by NaBH4. The second temperature regime occurs between 375-430 degrees C where we observe clear evidence of Ti3+ formation by EPR spectroscopy that indicates chemical reduction of the SrTiO3 lattice. In addition, the oxygen-related surface defects observed in regime 1 are not formed in regime 2, but instead lattice oxygen vacancies (V-O) are observed by EPR. The changes to the Cr-doped SrTiO3 electronic structure after chemical reduction in regime 1 are quantitatively reversible after aerobic annealing at 400 degrees C for 30 min. The internal oxygen vacancies formed during the higher temperature reductions in regime 2 require increased temperatures of at least 600 degrees C to be fully reoxidized in 30 min. The effect of these different oxygen-related defects on the EPR spectrum of substitutional Cr3+ dopants is discussed. These results allow us to independently tune the dopant and host electronic structures of a technologically-relevant multifunctional material by a simple ex situ chemical perturbation.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000378276000037	27117721

The battery dynamics involve mass transport, charge transfer, ion-electron coupled reactions, electrolyte penetration, ion solvation, and interfacial evolution. However, it is difficult for the traditional electrochemical methods to capture the accurate and individual details of the dynamic processes in "black box" batteries; instead, only the net result of multi-factors on the whole scale. Recently, different advanced visualization techniques have been developed, which provide powerful tools to track and monitor the internal real-time dynamic processes, giving intuitive details and fine information at various scales from crystal lattice, single particle, electrode to cell level. Here, the recent progress on the investigation of electrochemical dynamics in battery materials are reviewed, via developed techniques across wide timescales and space-scales, including the dynamic process inside the active particle, kinetics issues at the electrode/electrolyte interface, dynamic inhomogeneity in the electrode, and dynamic transportation at the cell level. Finally, the fundamental principles to improve the battery dynamics are summarized and new technologies for future more stringent conditions are highlighted. In prospect, this review opens sight on the battery interior for a clearer, deeper, and more thorough understanding of the dynamics.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000839280900001	35363408

Hydrogen production emerges as a contemporary technique to get rid of this energy crises and environmental issues. This review focuses on the clean/fresh-water electrolysis and its commercialization aspects. Seawater is a great source of water that can be used for electrolysis as a substitute of clean water. Several issues impede the widespread use of seawater electrolysis as the substitute of fresh water. In this review, an extensive discussion on theoretical and experimental investigations has been presented to explore the most effective pathway to achieve the highest performance of seawater electrolysis. The basic parameters such as pH of seawater, use of buffer solution over the electrolyte, applied potential, effect of dissolved ions, and nature of electrocatalyst are systematically studied to explore the most effective route for direct seawater electrolysis. The overview of this article offers a through understanding of the existing shortcomings and the possible way out related to seawater electrolysis for the benefit of mankind.									7	0	0	0	0	0	6			2398-4902			WOS:000714413200001

Herein, a novel S-PtNix/g-C3N4 photocatalyst is obtained with sulfidization of PtNix/g-C3N4 through hydrothermal synthesis. Impressively, the optimal photocatalytic property of 0.5S-PtNix/g-C3N4 is far and away higher than g-C3N4 and also is almost twice as high as PtNix/g-C3N4, achieving 4966 mu mol h(-1) g(-1). This outstanding activity could be attributed to two factors. On the one hand, the modification of PtNix on g-C3N4 not only improves the separation efficiency but also accelerates the transfer of photogenerated charges. On the other hand, NiSx could capture photogenerated electrons and work as a reactive site to participate in the photocatalytic reaction. In other words, the intensive activity of 0.5S-PtNix/g-C3N4 is ascribed to the synergistic effect of the charge transfer channel of PtNix and electron acceptor of NiSx. This work for the first time illuminates the photocatalytic mechanism through the systematic characterization of photogenerated charges, which provides a theoretical basis for designing the photocatalyst modified with the cocatalyst upon photocatalytic hydrogen production.									24	0	0	0	6	0	24			2168-0485			WOS:000484071600090

Herein, we report a self-template method for preparing a two-dimensional cobalt sulfide holey sheet superstructure with hierarchical porosity followed by the encapsulation of thin iron-nitrogen-carbon as a protective layer. The iron-nitrogen-carbon layer to some degree precludes the phase transition of cobalt sulfide underneath and preserves the structural integrity during catalysis, therefore rendering an exceptional durability in terms of no obvious activity loss after 10,000 cycles of the accelerated durability test. It also noticeably enhances the intrinsic activity of cobalt sulfide and does not influence its exposure into the electrolyte, resulting in showing an extraordinary electrochemical performance in terms of a potential difference of 0.69 V for the overall oxygen redox. A rechargeable zinc-air battery assembled by a cobalt sulfide/iron-nitrogen-carbon air cathode delivers approximately 4.2 times higher power density than that without an iron-nitrogen-carbon layer and stably operates for 300 h with a high voltaic efficiency. This work gives a facile and effective strategy for improving the long-term durability of transition-metal sulfide electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000787543300046	35195407

A special class of 2D layered material refers to materials exhibiting phase transition based on environment variables. Among these materials, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) act as a promising alternative for their unique combination of atomic-scale thickness, direct bandgap, significant spin-orbit coupling and prominent electronic and mechanical properties, enabling them to be applied for fundamental studies as catalyst materials. Metal phosphorous trichalcogenides (MPTs), as another potential catalytic 2D phase transition material, have been employed for their unusual intercalation behavior and electrochemical properties, which act as a secondary electrode in lithium batteries. The preparation of 2D TMD and MPT materials has been extensively conducted by engineering their intrinsic structures at the atomic scale. In this study, advanced synthesis methods of preparing 2D TMD and MPT materials are tested, and their properties are investigated, with stress placed on their phase transition. The surge of this type of report is associated with water-splitting catalysis and other catalytic purposes. This study aims to be a guideline to explore the mentioned 2D TMD and MPT materials for their catalytic applications.									23	1	0	0	1	0	23				2198-3844		WOS:000627486700001	34026429

In this contribution, a new low-Pt electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has been fabricated by a facile one-pot synthesis approach, in which Pt2+ cations and phosphomolybdic acid confined in the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) were submitted to pyrolysis to yield Pt single atoms dispersed into Mo2C nanocrystals in 3D porous carbon matrix. The as-synthesized Pt-1-Mo2C-C catalyst with Pt content of only 0.7 wt% exhibited remarkably enhanced activity for HER in 1 M KOH, with overpotential at 10 mA/cm(2) lowered from 211 mV to 155 mV and 7-fold higher mass activity (7.14 A/mgPt) than the benchmark 20 wt% Pt/C. The promoted activity can be attributed to the electronic interaction between Pt single atoms and Mo2C surface, which not only improved water activation but also strengthened hydrogen adsorption, as indicated by FTIR and microcalorimetric characterizations.

The preparation method discloses the first report on the synthesis of iron tungstate nanoparticles. The large-scale synthesis of iron tungstate nanoparticles was achieved and characterized by analytical instruments. The powder XRD patterns authenticated the presence of monoclinic phase of FeWO4 with an average crystalline size of 19nm from Scherrer equation. The optical properties were deliberately assessed with vibrational spectroscopy which predicted the optical band gap of about 2.2 eV. DC and AC conductivity studies suggested that the prepared nanoparticles exhibit excellent conductivity. Furthermore, the semiconducting nature was proved with their temperature-dependent IV curves. The photoconductivity curves serve to be an evident for excellent behavior of light-induced charge carrier's increment on the prepared iron tungstate nanoparticles. Considerate the interactions between the electrode substrate and nanostructures being an important research in determining the inherent activity of the nanostructures. Photoelectrochemical water splitting towards oxygen evolution was performed on varying the working electrode substrates (Nickel, Platinum, stainless steel, copper) in which higher photon to oxygen conversion rates were observed to be in the increasing order of Pt > SS > Ni > Cu.

After removal of telluric lines, the equivalent width of the [O (I)] line could be measured with an accuracy of 0.2 to 0.3 M Angstrom. Using these data and the equivalent widths of eight weak Fe (II) lines, the trend of [O/Fe] with [Fe/H] has been derived. Below [Fe/H]similar or equal to - 1.0 the oxygen-to-iron ratio is nearly constant at a level of [O/Fe] similar or equal to 0.4 in contradiction to recent results from UV OH lines.

As a promising alternative to the Pt-group metals, considerable efforts have been devoted to exploring highly efficient Ni-based catalysts for alkaline HOR. However, their performances still lack practical competitiveness. Herein, based on insights from the molecular orbital theory and the Hammer-Norskov d-band model, we propose an ingenious surface oxygen insertion strategy to precisely tailor the electronic structures of Ni electrocatalysts, simultaneously increasing the degree of energy-level alignment between the adsorbed hydroxide (*OH) states and surface Ni d-band and decreasing the degree of anti-bonding filling, which leads to an optimal OHBE. Through the pyrolysis procedure mediated by a metal-organic framework at a low temperature under a reducing atmosphere, the obtained oxygen-inserted two atomic-layer Ni shell-modified Ni metal core nanoparticle (Ni@O-i-Ni) exhibits a remarkable alkaline HOR performance with a record mass activity of 85.63 mA mg(-1), which is 40-fold higher than that of the freshly synthesized Ni catalyst. Combining CO stripping experiments with ab initio calculations, we further reveal a linear relationship between the OHBE and the content of inserted oxygen, which thus results in a volcano-type correlation between the OH binding strength and alkaline HOR activity. This work indicates that the oxygen insertion into the top-surface layers is an efficient strategy to regulate the coordination environment and electronic structure of Ni catalysts and identifies the dominate role of OH binding strength in alkaline HOR.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000819291600001	35732007

William; Cardona, Tanai					Sanchez-Baracaldo, Patricia/0000-0002-5216-2664			Time-resolved comparative molecular evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis								BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-BIOENERGETICS				1862	6					148400	10.1016/j.bbabio.2021.148400		FEB 2021		JUN 1 2021	2021	Oxygenic photosynthesis starts with the oxidation of water to O-2, a light-driven reaction catalysed by photosystem II. Cyanobacteria are the only prokaryotes capable of water oxidation and therefore, it is assumed that the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis is a late innovation relative to the origin of life and bioenergetics. However, when exactly water oxidation originated remains an unanswered question. Here we use phylogenetic analysis to study a gene duplication event that is unique to photosystem II: the duplication that led to the evolution of the core antenna subunits CP43 and CP47. We compare the changes in the rates of evolution of this duplication with those of some of the oldest well-described events in the history of life: namely, the duplication leading to the Alpha and Beta subunits of the catalytic head of ATP synthase, and the divergence of archaeal and bacterial RNA polymerases and ribosomes. We also compare it with more recent events such as the duplication of Cyanobacteria-specific FtsH metalloprotease subunits and the radiation leading to Margulisbacteria, Sericytochromatia, Vampirovibrionia, and other clades containing anoxygenic phototrophs. We demonstrate that the ancestral core duplication of photosystem II exhibits patterns in the rates of protein evolution through geological time that are nearly identical to those of the ATP synthase, RNA polymerase, or the ribosome. Furthermore, we use ancestral sequence reconstruction in combination with comparative structural biology of photosystem subunits, to provide additional evidence supporting the premise that water oxidation had originated before the ancestral core duplications. Our work suggests that photosynthetic water oxidation originated closer to the origin of life and bioenergetics than can be documented based on phylogenetic or phylogenomic species trees alone.									22	0	0	0	21	0	23			0005-2728	1879-2650		WOS:000636043000006	33617856

In this work, we fabricated an In2O3 superset of NC@GO nanohybrid, in which In2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) were encapsulated by an N-doped carbon (NC) shell and supported on graphene. The multi-components in In2O3 superset of NC@GO synergistically optimize the structural and electronic properties of the material. The particle size and dispersion of In2O3 NPs were optimized owing to the separation effect of the amorphous NC shell and graphene support. This separation effect exposes more number of active sites for the electrochemical reaction. Abundant oxygen vacancies exist in In2O3, leading to a stronger ability for the adsorption and activation of CO2. The NC shell inhibits the direct contact between the electrolyte and In2O3, which significantly suppresses competitive H 2 evolution. The charge transfer during the electrocatalysis process is also effectively enhanced due to the carbon components. The synergistic effect of multi-components in the In2O3 superset of NC@GO sample results in a significantly improved CO2 reduction reaction performance with a high HCOO- Faradic efficiency (FE) of 91.2% and a current density of 40.38 mA cm(-2) at -0.8 V obtained using a flow cell. The present work demonstrates that rationally designing nanohybrids with multifunctional components is an effective strategy for optimizing the structural and electrocatalytic properties of materials for energy conversion. y(C) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The editorial office of Journal of Materials Science & Technology.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1005-0302			WOS:000788164600002

K-feldspar rims and veinlets, which accompany garnet and amphibole coronitic textures in the orthorocks, are the mineralogic indicators of rock interaction with fluids containing potassium and sodium salts. The calcium content of garnet in the rocks systematically increases from the earliest generation of the mineral to the latest, which coexist with newly formed K-feldspar. According to the reaction[GRAPHICS]an increase in the calcium content of the garnet corresponds to an increase in the alkali activity in the fluid (at constant T and P) during corona growth. Calculation of temperature, pressure, oxygen, and alkali activities showed that the formation of garnet-K-feldspar-quartz coronas in metamangerites and metaanorthosites from the Adirondack Complex has taken place at T = 700-600 degrees C, P = 7-6 kbar under conditions of low oxygen and carbon dioxide activities and has resulted from the isobaric cooling of the rocks from metamorphic peak at high potassium and sodium activities in aqueous-chloride reduced fluid. The determining factor in the formation of the Grt + Kfs + Qtz assemblage of the rocks was low a(H2O)(fl), which was caused by the high concentration of potassium and sodium salts (up to X-salts = 0.7) in the fluid. Two consequent stages were distinguished in the evolution of fluid in the Adirondack Complex: (1) high-temperature (700-600 degrees C) stage of rock interaction with aqueous fluid saturated with potassium and sodium chlorides and (2) low-temperature (<600 degrees C) stage of rock alteration by aqueous-carbon dioxide fluids.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			0869-5911	1556-2085		WOS:000077124600007

The EPO gene of C. hamatus and T. bernacchii are 2727 bp and 2820 bp, respectively. Both of them contain five exons and four intron structures, and the coding region is 558 bp in length, encoding 185 amino acids. In addition, EPO of both fish are a relatively soluble and acidic protein. The tertiary structure prediction shows a typical structure characteristic that they fold into a four-parallel-a-helix structure, which assue EPO keep original function in the organism. Amino acids alignment shows 95.2% identity in homology of the EPOs between C. hamatus and T. bernacchii. Compared with other species, the EPOs shared 53.9%85.5% identities. The phylogenetic tree of the EPO nucleic acid sequences shows a close relationship among C. hamatus, C. hamatus and other fishes. The phyletic evolution agrees with their genetics, showing a conservative evolution progress of the EPO gene. This study may provide a theoretical basis for revealing the genetic characteristics of the Antarctic icefish EPO gene, and lay foundation to EPO study on long-term biological adaption under an extremely low temperature and high oxygen environment.			运用PCR、TA克隆及二代测序技术获得了独角雪冰鱼(Chionodraco hamatus)、伯氏肩孔南极鱼(Trematomus bernacchii)的EPO区域基因组DNA序列,并结合生物信息学方法进行了基因结构与保守功能域等生物学特性研究。结果表明:克隆获得的独角雪冰鱼、伯氏肩孔南极鱼EPO基因序列分别为2727 bp和2820 bp,包括5个外显子和4个内含子结构,编码区全长皆为558 bp,推定编码185个氨基酸。理化性质分析得到两者的EPO蛋白皆为相对稳定的酸性可溶性蛋白。其三级结构预测结果都显示出典型的4个反相平行的alpha螺旋结构特征,保持了其在生物体内发挥的原有作用。多重序列比对显示,独角雪冰鱼EPO与伯氏肩孔南极鱼的氨基酸同源性为95.2%,而与其它物种的同源性在53.9%85.5%之间。系统发育树显示,独角雪冰鱼、伯氏肩孔南极鱼的EPO基因与鱼类的同源基因聚类,系统进化情况同亲缘关系一致,表明EPO基因在进化过程中具有较强保守性。本研究为揭示EPO基因在南极冰鱼内的遗传特性提供理论依据,并为进一步探讨EPO基因在极端低温高氧环境中的鱼类适应性进化研究奠定了基础。						0	0	0		0	0	0			0029-814X			CSCD:5545467

All these transition metal porphyrins were shown to be active for HER in acetonitrile using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) as the proton source. The molecular nature and the stability of these metal porphyrins when functioning as HER catalysts were confirmed, and all catalysts gave Faradaic efficiency of >97% for H-2 generation during bulk electrolysis. Importantly, by using 1-Cu, a remarkably high turnover frequency (TOF) of 48500 s' can be obtained, making 1-Cu the most efficient among this series of metal porphyrin catalysts. This TOF value also represents one of the highest values reported in the literature. In addition, electrochemical analysis demonstrated that catalytic HER mechanisms with these 1-M complexes are different. These results show that with the same porphyrin ligand, the change of metal ions will have significant impact on both catalytic efficiency and mechanism. This work for the first time provides direct comparison of electrocatalytic HER features of transition metal complexes of tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin under identical conditions, and will be valuable for future design and development of more efficient HER electrocatalysts of this series.									15	2	0	0	0	0	15			1088-4246	1099-1409		WOS:000582305700007

Under these conditions, species at the aerosol surface are more rapidly transformed than molecules residing in the particle interior. To examine the formation and evolution of chemical gradients at aerosol interfaces, the heterogeneous reaction of hydroxyl radicals (OH) on similar to 200 nm particles of pure squalane (a branched, liquid hydrocarbon) and octacosane (a linear, solid hydrocarbon) and binary mixtures of the two are used to understand how diffusion limitations and phase separation impact the particle reactivity. Aerosol mass spectrometry is used to measure the effective heterogeneous OH uptake coefficient (gamma(eff)) and oxidation kinetics in the bulk, which are compared with the elemental composition of the surface obtained using X-ray photoemission. When diffusion rates are fast relative to the reaction frequency, as is the case for squalane and low-viscosity squalane-octacosane mixtures, the reaction is efficient (gamma(eff) similar to 0.3) and only limited by the arrival of OH to the interface. However, for cases, where the diffusion rates are slower than reaction rates, as in pure octacosane and higher-viscosity squalane-octacosane mixtures, the heterogeneous reaction occurs in a mixing-limited regime and is similar to 10x slower (gamma(eff) similar to 0.03). This is in contrast to carbon and oxygen K edge X-ray absorption measurements that show that the octacosane interface is oxidized much more rapidly than that of pure squalane particles. The O/C ratio of the surface (estimated to be the top 6-8 nm of the interface) is measured to change with rate constants of (3.0 +/- 0.9) x 10(-13) and (8.6 +/- 1.2) x 10(-13) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) for squalane and octacosane particles, respectively. The differences in surface oxidation rates are analyzed using a previously published reaction-diffusion model, which suggests that a 1-2 nm highly oxidized crust forms on octacosane particles, whereas in pure squalane, the reaction products are homogeneously mixed within the aerosol. This work illustrates how diffusion limitations can form particles with highly oxidized surfaces even at relatively low oxidant exposures, which is in turn expected to influence their microphysics in the atmosphere.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			1089-5639			WOS:000476693600020	31283250

Thus, developing highly efficient and low-cost catalysts for electrochemical reactions in energy conversion devices is crucial. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with maximum metal atom utilization efficiency and superior catalytic performance have attracted significant attention, especially for electrochemical reactions. However, because of the highly unsaturated coordination environment, the stability of SACs can be a challenge for practical applications. In this review, we will summarize the strategies to increase the stability of SACs and synthesizing stable SACs, as well as the application of SACs in electrochemical reactions. Finally, we offer a perspective on the development of advanced SACs through rational design and a deeper understanding of SACs with the help of in situ or operando techniques in electrochemical reactions.									19	3	0	0	2	0	19				2637-9368		WOS:000669751300001

In this study, we report the in situ integration of non-noble (Ni1-xCox)(5)TiO7 nanostructures with different Co concentrations and tunable size on a flexible metal network support using a conventional PEO method; we further report their utilization for efficient CO oxidation. It was found that the Co/Ni ratios in the original electrolyte precursors directly result in the different size and morphology evolution. The (Ni1-xCox)(5)TiO7 nanowire arrays with x = 0.16 exhibit the best performance towards CO catalytic oxidation along with a good catalytic stability. Further analysis using XPS indicates that the CO catalytic oxidation was mainly determined by the amount of defective oxygen, lattice oxygen and surface area. The single crystal nature, large surface area, excellent CO catalytic capability and strong substrate adhesion of the (Ni1-xCox)(5)TiO7 nanostructures on a flexible metal substrate will open up more applications in CO oxidation ranging from processing autovehicle exhaust to chemical gas emissions in the industry.									19	3	0	0	1	0	20			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000407812000040	28776060

As an insulating by-product of the oxygen reduction reaction on the cathode of a Li-air battery, it cannot be decomposed below 4.75 V (vs. Li+/Li) during recharge and leads to a large polarization, low coulombic efficiency, and low energy conversion efficiency of the battery. On the other hand, more than 10% of the Li ions from the cathode material are consumed during chemical formation of a Li-ion battery, resulting in low coulombic efficiency and/or energy density. Consequently, lithium compensation becomes essential to realize Li-ion batteries with a higher energy density and longer cycle life. Therefore, reducing the oxidation potential of Li2CO3 is significantly important. To address these issues, we show that the addition of nanoscaled LiCoO2 can effectively lower this potential to 4.25 V. On the basis of physical characterization and electrochemical evaluation, we propose the oxidization mechanism of Li2CO3. These findings will help to decrease the polarization of Li-air batteries and provide an effective strategy for efficient Li compensation for Li-ion batteries, which can significantly improve their energy density and increase their energy conversion efficiency and cycle life.									19	5	0	0	0	0	20			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000388114400028

However, the catalytic inertness of the basal plane, low conductivity of its steady state (2H phase), and the agglomeration of lamellar structures have seriously hindered its catalytic performance. It is very essential to design and modulate the morphology and phase of MoS2 to improve the above issues by synergistic regulation of electrical structure and defect engineering. Herein, MoS2 was delicately composited on CoP nanoframe derived from a typical metal-organic frame nanostructure (ZIF-67), forming the hollow CoP@MoS2 hetero-nanoframe. This exquisite externally layered and internally hollow CoP@MoS2 electrocatalyst demonstrated excellent catalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction, with a low overpotential of 119 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1), a large electric double-layer capacitance of 10.28 mF cm(-2) , and prominent long-term stability. The remarkable catalytic performance of hollow CoP@MoS2 hetero-nanoframe can be attributed to the unique architecture of the hetero-nanostructures, appropriate component ratios, strong interaction between CoP and MoS2 , and large-scale defects and disorder. First-principles density-functional theory calculations can prove the above arguments adequately, the hydrogen adsorption free energy of CoP@MoS2 is close to zero. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

Herein, state-of-the-art ZIF-67-based CoSe/MoSe2 hybrid nanospheres were synthesized and examined as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and Oxygen evolution (OER) in basic media. For the first time, a hierarchical well-designed CoSe/MoSe2 hybrid nanospheres designed with the uniform distribution layered of 2D-MoSe2 and conductive CoSe nanoparticles are acquired from CoMoO4 via selenization. Due to its large surface area and extraordinary morphology, it exhibited significant catalytic activity, which leads to a small overpotential of 110 mV for HER and for 240 mV OER along with low Tafel values of 54.24 and 51.98 mV dec(-1), respectively. Surprisingly, the stability is marvelous and also comparable to the standard of HER and OER. The enhancement is endorsed by the increase in conductivity evolved from the porous nanospheres and the collaborative effect of Co/Mo. To deliver a current density of 10 mA per cm(2) for full water splitting 1.56 V is required, which is one of the least reported voltages. Therefore, this work leads to a new class of catalysts for the fabrication of an efficient water electrolyzer.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-3697	1879-2553		WOS:000803817500005

Polishing is one of the most used electrode treatments, however, we show that particles from the polishing media cannot be easily removed from the electrode surface by standard cleaning procedures. Comparing the HER activity of gold disc electrodes polished with either diamond suspension or alumina paste, we show that the latter leads to higher current densities, specifically for the water reduction to hydrogen. A similar enhancement in HER activity was observed by the addition of Al3+ cations to the electrolyte, demonstrating that the particles are not catalytically active, but that the A1(3+) species released in solution due to corrosion promote the water reduction reaction. Due to an increase in the local OH- concentration during HER, the contaminating Al3+ cations precipitate and may deposit at the electrode surface as Al(OH)(3). In the presence of a high enough Al3+ concentration, layered Al(OH)(3) plates cover the whole electrode surface. The plates are composed of Al(OH)(3) sheets intercalated by sulphate anions.

Here, we report a novel 3D free-standing film oxygen electrode based on N, P-codoped hollow carbon fiber embedded with MoP quantum dots (MoP QD@HCF). The MoP QD@HCF oxygen electrode delivers a higher discharge specific capacity of 6.75 mA h cm(-2), a lower charge voltage of < 3.85 V and an enhanced rate capability (up to 0.4 mA cm(-2)). It is ascribed to that the N, P-codoped hollow carbon fiber with open end serves as mass transfer channels and faciliates the electrons and Li+ ions transportation. DFT calculation results show that MoP is metallic and (100) crystal plane exhibits favorable surface oxygen adsorption, resulting in a superior catalytic activity towards the formation/decomposition of Li2O2. This new electrode architecture opens a promising avenue for LOBs electrode development through optimizing the electrode components and microstructure.									47	1	0	0	1	0	48			2405-8297			WOS:000456689500027

To meet the demand for high-performance, lasting catalysts at industry-relevant current densities (>= 500 mA cm(-2)) with overpotentials <= 300 mV, here, we uniquely heterointerface the Ni, Co, and W phosphoxide phases in situ on plasma-defect-engineered Ni-Co support (MxO@MxP/PNCF (M = Ni, Co, W) core-shell heterostructure) to dramatically enhance the electrocatalytic performances with very high current densities. The achieved H-2 evolution requires low overpotentials of only 53 and 343 mV for current densities of 10 (j(10)) and 1000 mA cm(-2) (j(1000)) and shows fast reaction kinetics with a small Tafel slope of 40 mV dec(-1). Importantly, the MxO@MxP/PNCF presents spectacular activity at industry-relevant current densities (>j(300)) and outperforms the industry Pt/C benchmark. Our catalyst shows excellent long-term stability and durability with no significant activity loss after 10(4) cycles and 100 h of operation in an alkaline electrolyte. First-principles simulations reveal the best metal-phosphide combination to minimize the Gibbs energy for absorbing H+ ions on the reactive sites and to enhance the desorption of H-2.									12	2	0	0	0	0	12			2168-0485			WOS:000661302000007

FESEM micrographs show that In and Cu co-doped ZnS crystallites have a rough surface nanostructure and the as-synthesized photocatalysts were tested for the photo catalytic hydrogen evolution from water splitting via the irradiation of simulated sunlight. Among In and Cu co-doped ZnS products, 4In4CuZnS photocatalyst can achieve the maximum hydrogen production rate (752.7 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)) in 360 min under simulated sunlight illumination. Meanwhile, we separated the hydrogen and oxygen cells using an ion exchange membrane. Both electrodes (working electrode and Pt electrode) are dipped into each cell containing an aqueous solution containing 0.1 M Na2S at pH 3 to convert water into hydrogen and oxygen under solar irradiation. As expected, the photo electrochemical water splitting cells could significantly improve the photocatalytic activity, where the 4In4CuZnS nanoparticles shows the photoelectrochemical performance with photocurrent density of 12.2 mA cm(-2) at 1.1 V and hydrogen evolution rate of 1189.4 mu mol h(-1) g(-2).

The evolution and explosion equations included only the carbon burning reaction C-12 + C-12 With energy release corresponding to the complete conversion of carbon and oxygen (at the same rate as that of carbon) into Ni-56. The ratio of mixing length to convection-zone size a, was chosen as the parameter. Although the model assumptions were crude, we obtained an acceptable (for the theory of supernovae) pattern of explosion with a strong dependence of its duration on alpha (c). In our calculations with sufficiently large values of this parameter, alpha (c) = 4.0 x 10(-3) and 3.0 x 10(-3), fuel burned in the regime of prompt detonation. III the range 2.0 x 10(-3) greater than or equal to alpha (c) greater than or equal to 3.0 x 10(-4), there was initially a deflagration with the generation of model pulsations whose amplitude gradually increased. Eventually, the detonation regime of burning arose, which was triggered from the model surface layers (with in = 1.33M(circle dot)) and propagated deep into the model up to the deflagration front. The generation of model pulsations and the formation of a detonation front are described in detail for alpha (c) = 1.0 x 10(-3).

A hand-made reactor provided a new set of parameters. The variation of UVon and UVoff periods resulted in samples with a range of different structures, compositions, and activities. Graphene/Pt was prepared with varying forms of illumination pulse, and its hydrogen oxidation and oxygen reduction reaction performances were evaluated. Controlling the reduction degree of Pt ions on partially reduced graphene oxide was achieved by manipulating the setup design. The results revealed a dominant growth and agglomeration phase of Pt particles, mostly with metallic states, by increasing both UVon and U-off time spontaneously. Long UVon without adequate UVoff did not result in promising electrocatalytic activities. In other words, different structures, compositions, and activities of samples suggested that not just the illumination is the crucial factor, it is also the resting time or UVoff which determines the surface adsorption kinetics, nucleation sites, and growth mechanism of nanoparticles. Further chemical reduction by highly concentrated ascorbic acid was used to confirm the proposed mechanisms, which lead to samples even with more metallic Pt (Pt-0).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000723830600001

In this study, carbon nitride nanorod (GCN-Rod) is designed to couple H2O2 generating and activation for efficient environment remediation. The limitation of the sluggish hole oxidation kinetics during the photocatalytic H2O2 production is overcome by oxidation of electrostatically adsorbed contaminant molecules. Acid-activated carbon nitride nanomd binds a large number of protons onto the surface, forming an acidic micro-environment prone to protonating organic molecules into positively charged molecules and adsorbed on the negative zeta-potential catalyst surface for oxidation reactions. The in situ synthesized H2O2 is confirmed to be the origin of reactive oxygen species by EPR and band position analysis. The photocatalytic tetracycline (10 ppm) degradation ability approaches approximately 100 % within 10 min under visible-light irradiation. Cycle tests also demonstrated sufficient stability. This work achieves a delicate coupling of H2O2 production and in-situ utilization, which is sufficient for continuous pollutant degradation, expanding the catalyst design methods.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000830802900004

The Ir-4f(7/2) signals of 1f-cus-Ir with and without on-top oxygen (O-top) emerge as surface features of the baked-out surface, whose positive and negative shifts in binding energy are in line with the DFT computation results. Progressively increasing the reduction temperature, the 1f-cus-Ir feature quickly disappears and the signal of 2f-cus-Ir emerges at 403 K. Meanwhile the feature of 1f-cus-Ir + O-top diminishes but persists when the It metal signal is evident. The intriguing coexistence of 1f-cus-Ir + O-top and Ir metal at 433-443 K is elucidated in the theoretical pathway study. DFT calculation reveals that O-2 desorption via pairing two neighboring O-top atoms is the rate-determining step of surface deoxygenation. Under the UHV conditions, O-top is replenished via migration of the surface oxygen species, including the threefold coordinated oxygen (O-3f) of a reduced surface. Hence the O-top atom is an active and long-lived surface species, which does not vanish until O-3f is consumed and surface It begins to cluster. Under the realistic pressure conditions, O-top can also be refreshed via the dissociative adsorption of gas-phase oxygen. In either pathway, O-top is a critical intermediary of IrO2(1 1 0) oxidation catalysis. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			0039-6028	1879-2758		WOS:000274591000009

In the present study, we report a novel chemical method for the simultaneous doping of nitrogen and sulfur by in-situ polymerization of 6-N, N-dibutylamine-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-dithiol on a graphene framework. The composites are subjected to annealing at temperature between 900 degrees C and 1100 degrees C to form N-S/Gr catalysts. N-S/Gr-1000 catalyst exhibits an enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity dominated through 4e(-) pathway compared to other catalysts. The excellent durability of N-S/Gr-1000 catalyst with only a 20-mV negative shift in its half-wave potential after 10,000 repeated cycling contributes to the enhanced ORR. Although a larger shift in onset and half-wave potentials is observed for commercial Pt/C from the initial cycle, the linear sweep voltammogram recorded after 5000 cycles shows poor ORR kinetics with several redox steps. The potential of N-S/Gr-1000 catalyst as a cathode catalyst was validated in a membrane electrode assembly and in a real anion-exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC). A peak power density of similar to 20 mW cm(-2) was achieved under ambient temperature and pressure, which makes N-S/Gr-1000 a promising alternative nonprecious metal catalyst in AEMFCs.

First, glutamine and glucose in ionic liquid were used as carbon and nitrogen source. The surface characterizations confirm the formation of N-doped carbon dots with the presence of imidazolium and ionic liquid anion at the extreme surface. Next to that, CDs were generated in the absence of glutamine while using the ionic liquid as source of nitrogen. The TEM and surface analysis confirm the formation of nanoscale N-doped carbon dots. Furthermore, the catalytic activity of the generated CDs towards the oxygen reduction were investigated. As a result, both CDs materials exhibit a pronounced electrocatalytic activity with a prevalent 2 electron pathway leading to the formation of hydrogen peroxide. More interestingly, the CDs generated in the presence of glucose and ionic liquid display a selective 2 electron reduction of O-2, with H2O2 production higher than 90% for a potential range up to 0.8 V (from 0.6 V to -0.2 V vs RHE).

Here, a facile pyrolysis method to obtain phase-pure CrP nanoparticles supported on N, P dual-doped carbon (CrP/NPC) is reported to be tuned toward industrial HER. Interestingly, CrP/NPC exhibits excellent HER activity that requires an overpotential of 34 mV to attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is only 1 mV positive to commercial Pt/C and a potential of 55 mV to achieve a current density of 200 mA cm(-2) which is better than Pt/C. In addition, the long-term durability of CrP/NPC is far superior to Pt/C due to the strong interaction between CrP and C support, restricting any agglomeration or leaching. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that electronic modulation at the interface (CrP/NPC) optimizes the hydrogen adsorption energy. The Cr-Cr bridge site with required density of states near the Fermi level is found to be the active site. Overall, this report provides a practical scheme to synthesize rarely investigated CrP based materials along with a computational mechanistic guideline for electrocatalysis that can be utilized to explore other phosphides for various applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000751838700001	35129312

Thus, not only the total mass of soot released from hydrocarbon combustion have to be controlled but also its particle size distribution. Combustion technologies such as oxygen-enriched and oxy-fuel allied with flue gas recirculation have demonstrated their potential for reducing pollutants while improving combustion efficiency. In this context, this work explores the effect of CO2 addition on the soot formation process under an oxygen enriched atmosphere. A set of laminar counterflow ethylene flames are numerically studied for CO2 addition on either the fuel or the oxidizer mixtures for the same CO2 amount in the reaction layer. The numerical approach accounts for detailed chemistry and transport properties, together with an advanced model for thermal radiation and the discrete sectional model for soot formation. It was observed that CO2 suppresses the formation of species such as hydrocarbon radicals (C2H, C3H3), C2H2 and A1, which are important PAHs building block species directly involved in the soot formation process. For the same amount of CO2 in the reaction layer, it was found a more expressive suppression of the aforementioned species concentrations when CO2 was added to the fuel mixture. Moreover, for the same amount of CO2 in the reaction layer, it was also found that while chemical effects played a major role on the formation of C2H2, C3H3 and PANs for the CO2 addition on the oxidizer side, both chemical and thermophysical effects are important for CO2 addition on the fuel side. In both cases, the temperature profile was mainly influenced by thermophysical effects while the soot volume fraction was mainly influenced by chemical effects. Finally, the particle-size distribution reveled to be strongly bimodal and slightly sensitive on the CO2 addition for the current flames. (C) 2019 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

While the principal reaction steps are well established, key features of the catalytic mechanisms are poorly characterized, including the identity of the turnover-limiting step and the catalyst resting state. Here, we report a mechanistic study of aerobic allylic acetoxylation of allylbenzene with a catalyst system composed of Pd(OAc)(2) and 4,5-diazafluoren-9-one (DAF). The DAF ligand is unique in its ability to support aerobic catalytic turnover, even in the absence of benzoquinone or other co-catalysts. Herein, we describe operando spectroscopic analysis of the catalytic reaction using X-ray absorption and NMR spectroscopic methods that allow direct observation of the formation and decay of a palladium(I) species during the reaction. Kinetic studies reveal the presence of two distinct kinetic phases: (1) a burst phase, involving rapid formation of the allylic acetoxylation product and formation of the dimeric Pd-1 complex [Pd-1(DAF)(OAc)](2), followed by (2) a post-burst phase that coincides with evolution of the catalyst resting state from the Pd-I dimer into a pi-allyl-Pd-II species. The data provide unprecedented insights into the role of ancillary ligands in supporting catalytic turnover with O-2 as the stoichiometric oxidant and establish an important foundation for the development of improved catalysts for allylic oxidation reactions.									22	0	0	0	4	0	22			0002-7863			WOS:000474669700040	31184479

The CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is carried out on chlorine-containing NiO octahedral particles made by a solid-state synthesis method yielding a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 70 % for formate production at -0.8 V vs. RHE with a partial current density of 14.7 mA/cm2. XPS confirms the presence of Ni3+ and Ni2+ species, indicating the existence of uncoordinated Ni. The Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio increases with the Cl concentrations on NiO. Cl concentrations are also confirmed with STEM-EDX. DFT modeling provides insights into the thermodynamic stability and CO2RR mechanism over the Cl-containing NiO surface. It is suggested that Cl can occupy the defective sites created by oxygen vacancies on the NiO model with Cl (O-alpha+Cl). The surface Pourbaix diagrams constructed from DFT indicate the preferred surface terminations favorable at the operating conditions for the CO2RR, which closely agrees with the experimental findings.

This phase transition leads to substantial changes in the physical and chemical properties of brownmillerite oxides, including electrical and ion conductivity, magnetic state, and oxygen diffusivity. In this study, the variations in the resistive switching mode of the epitaxial brownmillerite SrFeO2.5 thin film in the device were studied by systematically controlling the oxygen concentration, which could be varied by changing the compliance current during the first electroforming step. Depending on the compliance current, the SrFeO2.5 devices exhibited either low-power bipolar resistive switching or complementary resistive switching behaviors. A physical model based on the internal redistribution of oxygen ions between the interfaces with the top and the bottom electrodes was developed to explain the complementary resistive switching behavior. This model was experimentally validated using impedance spectroscopy. Finally, the gradual conductance variation in the brownmillerite SrFeO2.5 thin films was exploited to realize synaptic learning.									15	0	0	0	0	0	14			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000572965700079	32799524

The evolution of interfacial chemistry of the alpha-Al2O3 (0001) surfaces and metal/alpha-Al2O3 (0001) interfaces are well illustrate via modifications of the surface Ols spectra. Clean hydroxylated surfaces are obtained through water- and oxygen plasma treatment at room temperature. The surface OH groups of the hydroxylated surface are very sensitive to electron beam illumination, Ar+ sputtering, UHV heating, and adsorption of reactive metals. The transformation of a hydroxylated surface to an Al-terminated surface occurs by high temperature annealing or Al deposition. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we report a modified solvothermal approach for the preparation of composite carbonates between Mn and X (X = Co, Ni and Fe). Upon post-annealing treatment, the aforementioned carbonates are transformed into the corresponding micro/nano hierarchical structured mixed oxides with increased porosity. It is found that onion-like core-shell architectures appear in the Mn-Co and Mn-Ni systems because of volume shrinkage arising from the generation of chemical-level mixed oxides, while a less porous structure occurs in the Mn-Fe system with the formation of a physical-level mixture. The ORR activity of the prepared composite oxides in alkaline media is investigated by voltammetry under different hydrodynamic conditions. An enhanced ORR activity is observed in the Mn-Co mixed oxide, which is rationalized in terms of the unique microstructure and crystallographic phase. The present study suggests that proper mixing is an effective method for activating the ORR activity of manganese oxides, which is beneficial for developing non-precious electrocatalysts for fuel cells and metal/air batteries.									17	1	0	0	1	0	17			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000340514500020

The experimental group ("Group-ZVI") removed 12.7% more chemical oxygen demand (COD; 79%) than the control group ("Group-CK") through ZVI micro-electrolysis oxidation reactions. The presence of ZVI significantly increased the average voltage (326 + 1.08 mV in Group-ZVI, 176 + 1.15 mV in Group-CK) and power density (2.03 mW m(-2) in Group-ZVI, 1.32 mW m(-2) in Group-CK) compared with the control group by accelerating the electron transfer rate and enriching the community of electrochemically active bacteria (p < 0.05). The removal of COD dominant bacterial Sphingomonadceae was promoted and the main microorganisms that provided electricity, such as the Proteobacteria phylum, were also enriched under the action of the primary cell closed loop. The concentrations of the functional microbes Rhizobium and Alphatproteobacter also increased significantly (p < 0.05) in Group-ZVI (anode) compared with Group-CK. These observations led us to propose a new strategy to improve the performance of CWMFCs for wastewater treatment and power generation.									7	0	0	0	3	0	7			0964-8305	1879-0208		WOS:000564599100017

For this purpose, a new approach to the pulse fluorometry method was implemented. In the "dark" reaction center (RC) state, antenna fluorescence decay kinetics were measured under lowintensity excitation (532 nm, pulse repetition rate 1 Hz), and the emission was registered by a streak camera. To create a "closed" [P680(+)Q (A) (-) ] RC state, a high-intensity pre-excitation pulse (pump pulse, 532 nm) of the sample was used. The time advance of the pump pulse against the measuring pulse was 8 ns. In this experimental configuration, under the pump pulse, the [P680(+)Q (A) (-) ] state was formed in RC, whereupon antenna fluorescence kinetics was measured using a weak testing picosecond pulsed excitation light applied to the sample 8 ns after the pump pulse. The data were fitted by a two-exponential approximation. Efficiency of antenna fluorescence quenching by the photoactive RC pigment in its oxidized (P680(+)) state was found to be similar to 1.5 times higher than that of the neutral (P680) RC state. To verify the data obtained with a streak camera, control measurements of PSII complex fluorescence decay kinetics by the single-photon counting technique were carried out. The results support the conclusions drawn from the measurements registered with the streak camera. In this case, the fitting of fluorescence kinetics was performed in three-exponential approximation, using the value of tau(1) obtained by analyzing data registered by the streak camera. An additional third component obtained by modeling the data of single photon counting describes the P680(+)Pheo(-) charge recombination. Thus, for the first time the ratio of k (P) (+) /k (P) = 1.5 was determined in a direct experiment. The mechanisms of higher efficiency for non-photochemical antenna fluorescence quenching by RC cation radical in comparison to that of photochemical quenching are discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0006-2979	0320-9725		WOS:000378001700004	27301286

The relative concentration of C-2 (a(3)Pi(u)) radicals, which are generated via the photolysis of C2Cl4 with the focused output from the fourth harmonic of a Nd:YAG laser (266 nm), was monitored by laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) in the (0, 0) band of the C-2 (d(3)Pi(g)<- a(3)Pi(u)) transition at 516.5 nm. Under pseudo-first-order conditions, we measured the time evolution of C-2 (a(3)Pi(u)) and determined the rate constants for reactions of C-2 (a(3)Pi(u)) with alcohols. The rate constants increase linearly with the number of C atoms in the alcohols. All of them are larger than those for reactions of C-2 (a(3)Pi(u)) with alkanes (C-1-C-5). Based on the bond dissociation energy and linear free energy correlations, we believe the reactions of C-2 (a(3)Pi(u)) with alcohols proceed via the mechanism of hydrogen abstraction. The experimental results show that the H-atom on the C-H bonds is activated at the presence of the OH substituent group in the alcohol molecule. The theoretical calculations for the reaction of C-2 (a(3)Pi(u)) with methanol also support these hypotheses.									13	3	0	0	0	0	13			1089-5639			WOS:000228847300021	16833710

Laser radiation at 266 nm photodissociates ozone in a mixture of molecular oxygen and ozone. The photolysis step produces vibrationally excited O-2(a (1)Delta(g)) that is rapidly converted to O-2(X (3)Sigma(g)(-),upsilon=2,3) in a near-resonant adiabatic electronic energy-transfer process involving collisions with ground-state O-2. The output of a tunable 193-nm ArF laser monitors the temporal evolution of the O-2(X (3)Sigma(g)(-),upsilon=2,3) population via laser-induced fluorescence detected near 360 nm. The rate coefficients for the vibrational relaxation of O-2(X (3)Sigma(g)(-),upsilon=2,3) in collision with O-2 are 2.0(-0.4)(+0.6)x10(-13) cm(3) s(-1) and (2.6 +/- 0.4)x10(-13) cm(3) s(-1), respectively. These rate coefficients agree well with other experimental work but are significantly larger than those produced by various semiclassical theoretical calculations.

In this study, we utilized a facile H2O2 etching method for modulating S-vacancies in a TiO2/MoS2 nanostructure to enhance photoelectrochemical performance. The as-prepared TiO2/MoS2 with S-vacancies demonstrates an increased photocurrent density of 1.56 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is 2.14 times higher than that of pristine TiO2 (0.73 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE). An appropriate energy level alignment between TiO2 and MoS2 and defect modulation are demonstrated in this study. The photo-generated electrons and holes are effectively separated and transported due to the built-in electric field in TiO2/MoS2. Moreover, the surface oxygen production reaction is enhanced due to its plenty exposed reaction active sites. This study demonstrates the synergistic effects of S-vacancies and built-in electric field in enhancing the carrier separation and transport properties. Furthermore, this study provides a universal strategy in designing high quality photoelectrodes in the photoelectrochemical system.									36	2	0	0	1	0	36			2398-4902			WOS:000611818900019

Although two-dimensional (2D) MoS2 materials have large specific surface areas, the catalytic efficiency is normally low. In this work, Ag and other dopants are plasma-implanted into MoS2 to tailor the surface and interface to enhance the HER activity. The HER activty increases initially and then decreases with increasing dopant concentrations and implantation of Ag is observed to produce better results than Ti, Zr, Cr, N, and C. At a current density of 400 mA cm(-2), the overpotential of Ag500-MoS2@Ni3S2/NF is 150 mV and the Tafel slope is 41.7 mV dec(-1). First-principles calculation and experimental results reveal that Ag has higher hydrogen adsorption activity than the other dopants and the recovered S sites on the basal plane caused by plasma doping facilitate water splitting. In the two-electrode overall water splitting system with Ag500-MoS2@Ni3S2/NF, a small cell voltage of 1.47 V yields 10 mA cm(-2) and very little degradation is observed after operation for 70 hours. The results reveal a flexible and controllable strategy to optimize the surface and interface of MoS2 boding well for hydrogen production by commercial water splitting.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2198-3844		WOS:000733343200001	34939374

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) shows that the phase is formed at 900 degrees C in agreement with the thermal analysis (TG-TDA/DSC). The SEM micrographs exhibit spherical and uniform grains with agglomerated nature, confirmed through laser granulometry. The direct optical gap (1.31 eV) comes from the crystal field splitting of Ni2+ octahedrally coordinated. La2NiO4 is chemically stable in the pH range (5-14) and anodic potentials at pH ~ 12 give rise to surface oxidation of La2NiO4 in the diffusion plateau (0.35-0.6 V). The electrochemical oxygen insertion, studied using chrono-amperometry, is slow with a diffusion coefficient of ~ 2.5 x 10(-18) cm(2) s(-1) at 500 mV. The Mott-Schottky characteristic plotted in alkaline solution (NaOH 0.1 M) indicates p-type conductivity due to oxygen over-stoichiometry well-known in this class of compound. A flat band potential of 0.1 V-SCE and hole concentration of 10(19) cm(-3) were determined from the capacitance measurement. Therefore, the oxide has been successfully tested for the H-2 evolution under visible light irradiation. The best activity occurs at pH ~ 13 in presence of S2O32- as reducing agent with H-2 liberation rate of 23.6 mu mol mn(-1) (g catalyst)(-1) under visible light flux of 29 mW cm(-2).									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000511653100010

The 12 stable complex structures of the H2O@Pt-7 reactants and the corresponding structures of the H2O@Pt-7 and H + H2O@Pt-7 products are optimized for various adsorption sites on the cluster. The frequency analysis has been used to confirm the energy stability of the structures. The geometries of the transition states and the intrinsic reaction coordinates are calculated at the same theoretical level. The energy barrier for each reaction is determined. The results demonstrated that Pt7 cluster can abstract H or H-2 from H2O molecule depend on the initial structures of reactant and the active energy. These results are helpful for designing the practical hydrogen generation scheme with these reactions. (C)2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The "egg-box" structure in Na-Alg after ion-exchange with metal cations (Zn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, etc.) is the key to achieve a scalable and controllable synthesis of highly dispersed atomic metals. For instance, atomic Co, Ni and Cu have been successfully synthesized using this method. As a representative, the as-synthesized atomically dispersed Co on reduced graphene oxide (A-Co/r-GO) can reach a maximum metal loading of 3.6 wt%, showing outstanding catalytic activity and stability for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.842 V vs. RHE that is more positive than that of 20 wt% Pt/C (0.827 V vs. RHE) in alkaline solutions. The A-Co/r-GO catalyzed zinc-air batteries (ZABs) outperform Pt/C-based ZABs in the aspects of discharge voltage and specific zinc capacity, and can work robustly for more than 250 h with negligible voltage loss with refueling the Zn anode and KOH electrolyte periodically. This work opens up a new strategy for a general, practical and scalable synthesis of atomicmetal catalysts at very low cost.									39	1	0	0	2	0	39			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000451380800009

In the absence of these salts, with a decreasing potential, the reduction current on the Pt electrode in the 0.10 M H2SO4 solution exponentially increases (in absolute value) below the hydrogen reversible potential, ca. -0.05 V vs. SHE, and almost linearly increases below ca. -0.15 V. In the presence of 0.03 M Na2SO4 or K2SO4, however, the reduction current hardly changes in the potential region between ca. -0.9 and -1.7 V. When the current is. controlled, a new potential oscillation appears in this potential region. Almost the same behavior is also observed on the An electrode. When the potential of the Pt electrode is controlled in the 0.14 M H2SO4 Solution, the potential region where the reduction current hardly changes appears by the addition of 0.05 M Na2SO4, which is higher than that for 0.10 M H2SO4. We postulate that the decrease in the current by the addition of these salts is due to the decrease in the electromigration transport of hydrogen ions from the bulk solution to the electrode surface.

The color and UV-Vis absorption spectra of the photocatalysts were also changed before and after the catalysts were doped by Mo.					7th International Forum on Advanced Material Science and Technology7th International Forum on Advanced Material Science and Technology	JUN 26-28, 2011JUN 26-28, 2011	Natl Nat Sci Fdn China; KC Wong Educ Fdn; Dalian Univ Technol; Changchun Res Inst Mech Sci Co LtdNatl Nat Sci Fdn China; KC Wong Educ Fdn; Dalian Univ Technol; Changchun Res Inst Mech Sci Co Ltd	Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINADalian, PEOPLES R CHINA	4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0255-5476		*****************	WOS:000297036200243

However, the catalytic activity is restricted by the redox cycles of active sites. In this study, Fe was doped into ilmenite cobalt titanate to prepare Fe-doped CoTiO3 catalysts for antibiotic tetracycline (TC) degradation. Experiments and theoretical calculations illustrated that doping Fe in CoTiO3 increased the electron density of Co atoms of active sites, enhancing the redox cycles during peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation, and facilitating the generation of radicals for degrading pollutants. After doping Fe, over 99% of TC (20 mg/L) can be degraded in 40 min, and the reaction rate increased 5 folds compared with the pristine CoTiO3. The inherent crystal stability of ilmenite guarantees the reusability of catalysts and limited cobalt ions leaching (<= 0.22 mg/L). Besides, the impacts of PMS concentration, catalyst dosage, initial pH, coexisting ions, and reaction temperature on TC removal were systematically investigated, and the possible degradation pathway was proposed. Quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra indicated that sulfate radicals and singlet oxygen participated in TC degradation. This work provides new clues and strategies to construct highly efficient catalysts for heterogeneous catalytic oxidation.									16	0	0	0	5	0	16			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000683030600001		
J	BOWMAN, JR; WILLETT, SD; COOK, SJ				Willett, Sean D/B-1716-2008				OXYGEN ISOTOPIC TRANSPORT AND EXCHANGE DURING FLUID-FLOW - ONE-DIMENSIONAL MODELS AND APPLICATIONS								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE				294	1			1	55		10.2475/ajs.294.1.1				JAN 1994	1994	Solutions of one-dimensional transport equations including the mechanisms of advection, diffusion, hydrodynamic dispersion, and non-equilibrium exchange between water and rock indicate that the time-space evolution of oxygen isotopic compositions of rock and infiltrating fluid is dependent on (1) the rate of fluid infiltration, (2) the diffusive and dispersive properties of the rock matrix, (3) the rate of isotopic exchange, and (4) the rock-water mass oxygen ratio in a unit volume of water-saturated, porous rock. Infiltration generally leads to the development of an isotopic exchange front within the flow path, which separates an upstream segment of the flow column in which the rock is essentially equilibrated with the infiltrating water (water-dominated region), from a lower portion of the how path in which the infiltrating water has become largely equilibrated with the original isotopic composition of the rock (rock-dominated region). The geometry of isotopic exchange fronts developed in an infiltrated rock sequence depends on the interplay between the advective, the dispersive/diffusive, and the isotopic exchange processes, represented in scaled solutions of the transport equation by the Peclet (N-Pe) and Damkohler (N-D) numbers. The exchange front migrates through the flow path with increasing cumulative fluid flux and over time; its distance from the inflow boundary of the infiltrating fluid can be a realistic measure of time-integrated fluid flux. If both the exchange front and a portion of the water-dominated segment of the how path are preserved, their relative positions are a guide to the direction of fluid flow, including flow direction with respect to temperature gradient.Conventional W/R ratios computed for rocks along a flow path will depend not only on cumulative fluid flux, but on the conditions of flow ana exchange characterized by N-Pe and N-D, and on the position of the rock in the flow system. Reflecting these limitations, the conventional W/R ratio generally is an inappropriate method of measuring the actual extent of fluid infiltration at specific sites within hydrothermal and metamorphic systems.									128	7	0	0	2	0	132			0002-9599			WOS:A1994MR77900001		
J	Barber, J								Engine of life and big bang of evolution: a personal perspective								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				80	1-3			137	+		10.1023/B:PRES.0000030662.04618.27				2004	2004	Photosystem II (PS II) is the engine for essentially all life on our planet and its beginning 2.5 billion years ago was the 'big bang of evolution.' It produces reducing equivalents for making organic compounds on an enormous scale and at the same time provides us with an oxygenic atmosphere and protection against UV radiation ( in the form of the ozone layer). In 1967, when I began my career in photosynthesis research, little was known about PS II. The Z-scheme had been formulated [Hill and Bendall (1960) Nature 186: 136-137] and Boardman and Anderson [(1964) Nature 203: 166-167] had isolated PS II as a discrete biochemical entity. PS II was known not only to be the source of oxygen but of variable chlorophyll fluorescence [Duysens and Sweers (1963) In: Studies on Microalgae and Photosynthetic Bacteria, pp. 353-372. University of Tokyo Press, Tokyo] and delayed chlorophyll fluorescence [Arnold and Davidson (1954) J Gen Physiol 37: 677-684]. P680 had just been discovered [Doring et al. ( 1967) Z Naturforsch 22b: 639-644]. No wonder the 'black box of PS II' was described at that time by Bessel Kok and George Cheniae [Current Topics in Bioenergetics 1: 1-47 (1966)] as the 'inner sanctum of photosynthesis.' What a change in our level of understanding of PS II since then! The contributions of many talented scientists have unraveled the mechanisms and structural basis of PS II function and we are now very close to revealing the molecular details of the remarkable and thermodynamically demanding reaction which it catalyzes, namely the splitting of water into its elemental constituents. It has been a privilege to be involved in this journey.									40	1	1	0	32	0	41			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000221878600011	16328816

The cocatalyst consisting of a Pd core and a NiO shell formed simultaneously on the surface of La-doped NaTaO3 photocatalyst. The Pd core both induces migration of photogenerated electrons from the bulk of the La0.02Na0.98TaO3 and transfers electrons to the NiO shell. Without the NiO shell, Pd NPs show negligible H-2 production from water splitting, due to the rapid reaction between hydrogen and oxygen on the surface. On the other hand, the NiO shell allows the permeation of hydrogen and enables hydrogen reduction on Pd. The incorporation of NiO shell onto Pd remarkably enhances the photocatalytic performance of La-doped NaTaO3 for hydrogen production from pure water. In addition, the core/shell structure can significantly enhance the stability of Pd during the photocatalytic reaction. Similar concepts could be extended to other applications, where the catalytic activity and stability are of concerns. The formation mechanism of the core/ shell photocatalyst is proposed based on the high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) analyses.

Many environmental factors affect variation in these traits, but for fish, hypoxia and size-dependent mortality have become increasingly important because of human activities, such as increased nutrient enrichment (eutrophication), climate warming and selective fishing. Here, we study experimentally the effect of oxygen availability on maturation and growth in guppies (Poecilia reticulata) from two different selected lines, one subjected to positive and the other negative size-dependent fishing. This is the first study to assess the effects of both reduced ambient oxygen and size-dependent mortality in fish. We show that reduced ambient oxygen led to stunting, early maturation and high reproductive investment. Likewise, lineages that had been exposed to high mortality of larger-sized individuals displayed earlier maturation at smaller size, greater investment in reproduction and faster growth. These life-history changes were particularly evident for males. The widely reported trends towards earlier maturation in wild fish populations are often interpreted as resulting from size-selective fishing. Our results highlight that reduced ambient oxygen, which has received little experimental investigation to date, can lead to similar phenotypic changes. Thus, changes in ambient oxygen levels can be a confounding factor that occurs in parallel with fishing, complicating the causal interpretation of changes in life-history traits. We believe that better disentangling of the effects of these two extrinsic factors, which increasingly affect many freshwater and marine ecosystems, is important for making more informed management decisions.									11	0	0	0	11	0	12			2051-1434			WOS:000402599800001	28361001

For this study, we prepared LaMnO3 perovskite and Mn3O4 spinel composites using different types of carbon materials: carbon blacks, pyrolytic carbons, and catalytic filamentous carbon. Various analytical methods such as cyclic voltammetry, rotating ring disc electrode, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) were used to shed light on the influence of carbon in LaMnO3- and Mn3O4 - carbon composites during the ORR. These allowed us to define key characteristics of carbon materials, which determine the ORR activity and selectivity of the composites, among them sub-structural characteristics of carbon materials and pore accessibility. We conclude that (i) the ISAC route allows to significantly increase the number of accessible oxide sites and the ensuing ORR activity, (ii) the oxidation degree of Mn in LaMnO3 depends on the type and wt.% of carbon material and sub-structural order of carbon. (iii) We further claim that sub-structural characteristics of carbon materials, their pore size and size distribution affect the ORR activity of LaMnO3- and Mn3O4 - carbon composites. (iv) We see that an optimum combination of the carbon and the metal oxide allows obtaining the highest ORR activity. (v) Vulcan XC72 carbon seems to be the best suited for the ISAC synthesis of metal oxide-carbon composites due to its high structure consisting of highly branched flexible reticulate agglomerates.

As shown in our previous work [E.-S. Oh, A diffusional analysis for the oxidation on a plane metal-oxide interface, Chem. Eng. J. 117 (2006) 143-154; E.-S. Oh, A perturbation analysis for the metal oxidation fo cylindrical geometries, J. Chem. Eng.

Such concerns call for the development of novel electrode architectures to improve catalyst utilization and mass activity, thus promoting PEMWE cost competitiveness for large-scale implementation. In this study, we demonstrated, for the first time, a novel two-dimensional (2D)-patterned electrode with edge effects to address these challenges. The edge effect was induced by membrane properties, potential distribution, and counter electrode coverage and could be optimized by tuning the catalyst layer dimensions. To achieve identical PEMWE performance, the optimal pattern saved the 21% anode PGM catalyst compared with the conventional catalyst fully covered electrode. The PGM catalyst could be further reduced by 61% to boost mass activity with no significant performance loss. The results also indicated that the electrode uniformity in PEMWE cells might not be as critical as that in PEM fuel cells. The novel 2D-patterned electrode could effectively reduce PGM catalyst loading, accelerating affordable and large-scale production of hydrogen and other value-added chemicals via electrolysis.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000740269500001	34978183

To this end, sample membranes depleted of Ca2+ as well as 16 and 24 kDa extrinsic proteins were prepared and the effects of lanthanides substitution on OEC were studied. The lanthanides inhibited Ca2+-dependent restoration of oxygen evolution but the presence of Ca2+ during the treatment protected OEC from this inhibition, which occurred within 1 min at 20 degreesC but required much longer time at 0 degreesC Kinetic analysis suggests that lanthanides function as a mixed-type competitor for Ca2+. Lanthanides with ionic radii smaller than Ca2+ show higher affinity for the Ca2+ site than those with larger radii. A lanthanide-substituted OEC displayed a thermoluminescence (TL) band arising from S(2)Q(A)(-) charge recombination, indicating that the Mn cluster is oxidized to the S-2 state. However, the peak temperature of the TL band varied depending on lanthanide species. The results indicate that the oxidation potential of the Mn cluster is modified in various ways in a substituted OEC. Furthermore, the threshold temperature for the S-1 to S-2 transition in the lanthanide-substituted OEC was markedly upshifted to the temperature coincident with that found in Ca2+-depleted but 24 kDa protein preserved OEC. Changes in the OEC induced by the binding of lanthanides to the Ca2+-site are discussed based on these results. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, it is still challenging to achieve highly efficient overall water splitting because of the unsuitable electronic structure and the strong dependence on the noble metal co-catalysts to date. The development of photocatalytic water splitting is therefore immensely urgent to enlarge the uptake of photocatalysts by exploring novel compounds. Herein, we propose a novel two-dimensional (2D) pentagonal SiAs2(penta-SiAs2) photocatalyst suitable for water splitting based on first-principles calculations. Using a hybrid functional, we demonstrate the bandgap of 2D penta-SiAs(2)to be 2.35 eV, and its band-edges perfectly stride the redox potential of water. Most importantly, this material possesses both highly desirable carrier mobilities and strong light absorption in the visible and ultraviolet (UV) regions, which are superior to those of most previously reported 2D materials. Furthermore, the free energies suggest that hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions are feasible with penta-SiAs2. These extraordinary characteristics make penta-SiAs2 a promising 2D material for photocatalytic water splitting and provide a possible route for the future experiment scheme.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000565865500031

The model provides the temporal evolution of the heavy species along the pulse within this range time, where the coupling between vibrational and chemical kinetics is taken into account. This work shows that the predicted values for NO(X) molecules and O(P-3) atoms reproduce well previous measured data for these two species. A systematic analysis is carried out on the interpretation of experimental results. It is observed that the N-2(X, nu >= 13) + O -> NO(X) + N(S-4) and the reverse process NO(X) + N(S-4) -> N-2(X, nu similar to 3) + O have practically the same rates for a pulse duration longer than 10 ms, each of them playing a dominant role in the populations of NO(X), N(S-4) and, to a lesser extent, in O(P-3) kinetics. Our simulations show that for shorter pulse durations, from 0.1 to 10 ms, NO(X) is produced mainly via the processes N-2(A) + O -> NO(X) + N(D-2) and N(D-2) + O-2 -> NO(X) + O, while the oxygen atoms are created mostly from electron impact dissociation of O-2 molecules and by dissociative collisions with N-2(A) and N-2(B) molecules.									36	2	0	0	0	0	37			0963-0252	1361-6595		WOS:000265580800008

When tested as cathodic material, the mesoporous CO3O4/NiCO2O4 double-shelled nanocage with a large surface (112.9m(2)g(-1)) exhibits higher open circuit potential (0.252 V) and higher exchange current density (19.70 x 10(-4) A cm(-2)). Moreover, the maximum power density of the air-cathode microbial fuel cell equipped with the 5% as-prepared catalyst is 1810mWm(-2), 104% higher than the control. The morphology and crystal structure of CO3O4/NiCO2O4 are investigated by the Transmission electron microscope and X-ray diffraction. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis indicates that there exists Co3+/Co2+ and Ni3+/Ni2+ redox couples in the catalyst, and divalence trivalence - divalence redox cycles contribute to the improved oxygen reduction reaction performance and enhanced power output. Owing to the structural merits and improved electrochemical activity, the synthesized CO3O4/NiCO2O4 double-shelled nanocage would be considered as a replacement of the new material for Pt in microbial fuel cell.									25	0	0	0	7	0	25			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000440876700041

Therefore, precisely and effectively capturing the products of the reaction process is helpful to accurately deduce its reaction mechanism, optimize the reaction parameters and improve the reaction efficiency. At present, the mainstream electrochemical on-line monitoring techniques include spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and linear polarization curves. These methods are capable to detect the structure and composition changes of most substances in the reaction process. However, in order to more systematically and accurately grasp the information of all products, the real-time and in situ reaction monitoring technologies needs to be further expanded. Mass spectrometry (MS) has the advantages of high sensitivity, good selectivity, rapid response time and structural analysis, making itself an ideal research method for electrochemical reactions. In recent years, more and more reports on the study of electrochemical reaction by MS have been published. In particular, ambient ionization sources such as electrospray ionization (ESI) and its derived ionization techniques developed for electrochemistry have become a research hotspot. This review introduced the recently published electrochemistry-mass spectrometry (EC-MS) techniques, and described the electrochemical ion sources that designed and developed for different types of electrochemical reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7351			WOS:000558811500005

The carboxysome is a specialized bacterial organelle that encapsulates enzymes into a virus-like protein shell and plays essential roles in photosynthetic carbon fixation. The naturally designed architecture, semi-permeability, and catalytic improvement of carboxysomes have inspired rational design and engineering of new nanomaterials to incorporate desired enzymes into the protein shell for enhanced catalytic performance. Here, we build large, intact carboxysome shells (over 90nm in diameter) in the industrial microorganism Escherichia coli by expressing a set of carboxysome protein-encoding genes. We develop strategies for enzyme activation, shell self-assembly, and cargo encapsulation to construct a robust nanoreactor that incorporates catalytically active [FeFe]-hydrogenases and functional partners within the empty shell for the production of hydrogen. We show that shell encapsulation and the internal microenvironment of the new catalyst facilitate hydrogen production of the encapsulated oxygen-sensitive hydrogenases. The study provides insights into the assembly and formation of carboxysomes and paves the way for engineering carboxysome shell-based nanoreactors to recruit specific enzymes for diverse catalytic reactions.

Here, the authors build carboxysome shells in E. coli and incorporate catalytically active hydrogenases and functional partners within the empty shell for the production of hydrogen.									31	1	0	0	22	0	36				2041-1723		WOS:000588060400005	33116131	
J	Parvin, Sahanaz; Hazra, Vishwadeepa; Francis, Anita Gemmy; Pati, Swapan K.; Bhattacharyya, Sayan								In Situ Cation Intercalation in the Interlayer of Tungsten Sulfide with Overlaying Layered Double Hydroxide in a 2D Heterostructure for Facile Electrochemical Redox Activity								INORGANIC CHEMISTRY				60	10			6911	6921		10.1021/acs.inorgchem.1c00011		MAR 2021		MAY 17 2021	2021	The role of electrochemical interfaces in energy conversion and storage is unprecedented and more so the interlayers of two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures, where the physicochemical nature of these interlayers can be adjusted by cation intercalation. We demonstrate in situ intercalation of Ni2+ and Co2+ with similar ionic radii of similar to 0.07 nm in the interlayer of 1T-WS2 while electrodepositing NiCo layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) to create a 2D heterostructure. The extent of intercalation varies with the electrodeposition time. Electrodeposition for 90 s results in 22.4-nm-thick heterostructures, and charge transfer ensues from NiCo-LDH to 1T-WS2, which stabilizes the higher oxidation states of Ni and Co. Density functional theory calculations validate the intercalation principle where the intercalated Ni and Co d electrons contribute to the density of states at the Fermi level of 1T-WS2. Water electrolysis is taken as a representative redox process. The 90 s electrodeposited heterostructure needs the relatively lowest overpotentials of 134 +/- 14 and 343 +/- 4 mV for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively, to achieve a current density of +/- 10 mA/cm(2) along with exceptional durability for 60 h in 1 M potassium hydroxide. The electrochemical parameters are found to correlate with enhanced mass diffusion through the cation and Cl--intercalated interlayer spacing of 1T-WS2 and the number of active sites. While 1T-WS2 is mostly celebrated as a HER catalyst in an acidic medium, with the help of intercalation chemistry, this work explores an unfound territory of this transition-metal dichalcogenide to catalyze both half-reactions of water electrolysis.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000653539100008	33667066

Samples in different oxidation degrees were obtained by heating B particles until 600, 650, and 700 degrees C, using a temperature programmed thermobalance. A dual beam focused ion beam micro/nanofabricator was used to etch and cut the samples into thin slices (ca. 327 nm). The slices were observed under a scanning transmission electron microscope, accompanied with energy dispersive X-ray analysis. During the thermal oxidation process, B particles initially lost mass through dehydration. Then they began to get oxidized and gain weight markedly. The sample surface became more rough as the final temperature increased. Two different reaction modes took place in sequence during the thermal oxidation of the samples. Below 650 degrees C, the oxidation reaction occurred only on the surface of the particle (the surface reaction mode). However, when the samples were heated to 700 degrees C, the particle interior was also involved in the reaction (the global reaction mode), and a large number of pores were formed. The O content of the initial surface oxide layer was fairly high. The thickness distribution was uniform (average thickness 148.1 nm) and the two edges were both smooth. During the heating, the oxygen content of the surface oxide layer increased after an initial decrease. The average oxide layer thickness increased and the thickness distribution became irregular and unequal. The sample heated until 700 degrees C had an average surface oxide layer thickness of 379.3 nm, and the thickness span reached 354.3 nm. During the global reaction process (700 degrees C), the oxidation degree within the interior of the particle was lower than that on its surface. In the particle interior, pores near the center were smaller than those close to the edge, whereas the oxidation degree was uniformly distributed. Results in this work provide a deeper understanding of the surface oxide layer, which can potentially help improve the ignition and combustion features of B.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0721-3115	1521-4087		WOS:000401193900010

Ethylene oxidation is a surface structure-sensitive reaction being Pt(I 11) the only active electrode surface at potentials below surface oxidation. In situ infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) allows to identify the products formed during the adsorption and oxidation of ethylene. Vinylidene species were detected as oxidized adsorbates coming from ethylene and the only oxygen-containing species observed were on-top adsorbed CO and dissolved CO2 that is the final oxidation product. A potential dependent equilibrium for transformation between two different adsorption configurations of adsorbed vinylidene, mu(3)-eta(2)-C=CH2 and mu-C=CH2, has been observed. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The maximum H-2 evolution reaction rate for kv-PdO/TiNTs catalysts is measured to be in the magnitude of 6.5 mol g(-1) h(-1) at room temperature (similar to 25 degrees C), and the corresponding initial turnover frequency (TOF) is as high as 2601.6 h(-1). More importantly, for the first time we find that the H-2 production system is highly efficient for subsequent organic dye degradation without the addition of external energy, such as light, electricity and heat, or the addition of any artificial oxidants, e.g., H2O2. It is speculated that the active oxygen-centered species generated in the dehydrogenation catalytic system and the pre-reduction process induced by free hydrogen radicals play important roles in organic dye treatment. Thus, a unique tandem catalytic system by coupling hydrogen production with organic dye degradation is presented.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000451533800021

It catalyses the oxidation of D-amino acids to the corresponding alpha-ketoacids. The reducing equivalents are transferred to molecular oxygen with production of hydrogen peroxide. We have solved the crystal structure of the complex of D-amino acid oxidase with benzoate, a competitive inhibitor of the substrate, by single isomorphous replacement and eightfold averaging, Each monomer is formed by two domains with an overall topology similar to that of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase. The benzoate molecule lays parallel to the flavin ring acid is held in position by a salt bridge with Arg-283, Analysis of the active site shows that no side chains are properly positioned to act as the postulated base required for the catalytic carboanion mechanism, On the contrary, the benzoate binding mode suggests a direct transfer of the substrate alpha-hydrogen to the flavin during the enzyme reductive hail-reaction. The active site of D-amino acid oxidase exhibits a striking similarity with that of flavocytochrome b(2), a structurally unrelated FMN-dependent flavoenzyme. The active site groups of these two enzymes are in fact superimposable once the mirror-image of the flavocytochrome b(2) active site is generated with respect to the flavin plane, Therefore, the catalytic sites of D-amino acid oxidase and flavocytochrome b(2) appear to have converged to a highly similar but enantiomeric architecture in order to catalyze similar reactions (oxidation of alpha-amino acids or alpha-hydroxy acids), although with opposite stereochemistry.									270	2	2	0	228	0	276			0027-8424			WOS:A1996UY93000015	8755502

Currently, increasing attention has been concentrated on developing low-cost, high-activity, and long-life catalytic materials, especially for acid media due to the promise of proton exchange membrane (PEM)-based electrolyzers and polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Although non-precious-metal phosphide (NPMP) catalysts have been widely researched, their electrocatalytic activity toward HER is still not satisfactory compared to that of Pt catalysts. Herein, a series of precious-metal phosphides (PMPs) supported on graphene (rGO), including IrP2-rGO, Rh2P-rGO, RuP-rGO, and Pd3P-rGO, are prepared by a simple, facile, eco-friendly, and scalable approach. As an example, the resultant IrP2-rGO displays better HER electrocatalytic performance and longer durability than the benchmark materials of commercial Pt/C under acidic, neutral, and basic electrolytes. To attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) , IrP2-rGO shows overpotentials of 8, 51, and 13 mV in 0.5 M dilute sulfuric acid, 1.0 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and 1.0 M potassium hydroxide solutions, respectively. Additionally, IrP2-rGO also exhibits exceptional HOR performance in the 0.1 M HClO4 medium. Therefore, this work offers a vital addition to the development of a number of PMPs with excellent activity toward HOR and HER.									27	2	0	0	1	0	28			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000526609100042	32057234

Here, we report excellent HER activity achieved using three-dimensional (3D) tetsubo-like Co(OH)(2) nanorods on a macroporous electrically conductive network (MECN) synthesized by a hydrothermal method. This unique framework comprises three levels of porous structures, including a bottom-ordered MECN substrate, an intermediate layer of vertically porous Co(OH)(2) nanowires with a mean diameter of 100 nm and length of about 2 mu m, and outmost Co(OH)(2) nanosheets (approximate to 20 nm). The 3D array structure with a large aspect ratio provides a large specific surface area and exposes more active sites to catalyze electrochemical reactions at the electrode-electrolyte interface. Compared with Co(OH)(2) nanosheets on an MECN and foamy Co(OH)(2) on an MECN structure, the synthesized architecture has excellent HER catalytic reactivity, including a low potential of -69.2 mV vs. RHE, a cathodic current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 61.9 mV dec(-1), a high current density, and robust catalytic stability in 1 M KOH, and is promising in HER applications.									27	2	0	0	1	0	27			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000395075600026

The presence of V-O is generally believed to favor a catalytic reaction, but the formation of dopant-vacancy associations at a high doping concentration might produce an adverse effect. Herein, evolutions of the structural properties and catalytic performances in Sm-doped ceria (SmxCe1-xO2-delta, x = 0-1) are investigated to explore the doping effect of Sm3+ on the ceria-based nanoctrystals. The SmxCe1-xO2-delta films composed of nanoctrystals are elaborately prepared via electrodeposition under mild conditions to prevent phase separation. A combination of studies, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman, photoluminescence (PL), and methanol electro-oxidation (MEO) reaction, reveals that variation trends for the V-O concentration and catalytic property of SmxCe1-xO2-delta are unsynchronized. The lattice structures of SmxCe1-xO2-delta nanoctrystals undergo a smooth and steady transition from F-type (fluorite CeO2) to C-type (cubic Sm2O3) with the increase of Sm3+ contents. The structural transition occurs in the Sm3+ concentration range of 64-84%, within which the V-O concentration reaches the maximum as well. However, the optimal MEO performance is obtained at a relatively lower doping concentration of 24%. Above this concentration, significant dopant-vacancy associates are observed by XRD, Raman, and PL characterizations. It is inferred that, for these ceria-based nanocrystals, the dopant-vacancy association induced by high doping would impede the growth of catalytic performance despite all the benefits of V-O.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000489676400068	31556292

The morphology, crystal phase, electro-catalytic performance, safety assessment and stability were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Acid red G (ARG) degradation, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) detection and the accelerated life test, respectively. In addition, cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were applied. The results showed that SDS could obviously refine the coating particles, increase the oxygen evolution potential (OEP) and accelerate charge transfer. After modified with SDS, the electro-catalytic performance and stability of PbO2 electrode were greatly improved. The PbO2 electrode modified at 5.0 vt% volume fractions of SDS (PbO2-SDS(5.0)) exhibited the highest ARG decolorization rate of 83.5% and the largest COD removal rate of 53.9%, respectively, which could be attributed to the highest OEP and massive adsorbed hydroxyl oxygen (O-ad). Besides, PbO2-SDS(5.0) electrode showed a high reusability for ARG degradation and the accelerated service life could reach 348 h, which was almost 3.6 times longer than that of PbO2 electrode (96 h).

However, the improvement effect is limited by the decreased redox ability of charge carriers. The rational design of heterojunction from type II to Z-scheme is expected to overcome this obstacle. Herein, we demonstrate that the introduction of interfacial oxygen vacancies (OVs) can switch charge transfer of g-C3N4/BVO heterojunction from type II to Z-scheme. The interfacial OVs acted as the reactive center of charge carriers to quench the electrons of BVO and holes of g-C3N4, thereby promoting charge separation and migration. As a result, the interfacial OVs mediated Z scheme g-C3N4/BVO heterojunction kept the strong oxidation/reduction potential of two single-component photocatalysts thereby significantly enhancing the photodegradation of tetracycline and CO2 photoreduction. The kinetic constant of tetracycline degradation on the optimal g-C3N4/BVO-20 sample was 2.04-fold and 2.29-fold higher than those on g-C3N4 nanosheets and pure BVO, respectively. This work provides a feasible strategy by the interfacial vacancy engineering of heterojunction for enhanced photocatalysis. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Some key principles of PSII and artificial systems for light-induced charge accumulation are discussed. Systems are described where biomimetic electron donors - manganese complexes and tyrosine - have been linked to a Ru(II)-polypyridine photosensitiser. Oxidation of the donors by intramolecular electron transfer from the photo-oxidised Ru(III) complex has been studied using optical flash photolysis and EPR experiments. A step-wise electron transfer Mn-2(III,III) --> tyrosine --> Ru(III) has been demonstrated, in analogy to the reaction on the donor side of PSII Electron transfer from the tyrosine to Ru(III) was coupled to tyrosine deprotonation. This resulted in a large reorganisation energy and thus a slow reaction rate, unless the tyrosine was hydrogen bonded or already deprotonated. A comparison with analogous reactions in PSH is made. Finally, light-induced oxidation of a manganese dimer linked to a Ru(II)-photosensitiser has been observed. Preliminary results suggest the possibility of photo-oxidising manganese dimers in several steps, which is an important advancement towards water oxidation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

We find that none of the electrolytes studied are truly rechargeable, with OER/ORR <90% for all. Our findings emphasize that neither the overpotential for recharge nor capacity fade during cycling are adequate to assess rechargeability. Coulometry has to be coupled to quantitative measurements of the chemistry to measure the rechargeability truly. We show that rechargeability in the various electrolytes is limited both by chemical reaction of Li2O2 with the solvent and by electrochemical oxidation reactions during charging at potentials below the onset of electrolyte oxidation on an inert electrode. Possible mechanisms are suggested for electrolyte decomposition, which taken together, impose stringent conditions on the liquid electrolyte in Li-O-2 batteries.									342	12	0	0	14	0	347			1948-7185			WOS:000310177200021	26292247

Herein, core?shell g-C3N4@ZIF-8 were prepared by exfoliating-wrapping of g-C3N4 via ZIF-8 in-situ growth. XRD, SEM, TEM, and EDX mapping demonstrate the inclusion of curled g-C3N4 sheets in ZIF-8. UV?vis, PL, FTIR, and XPS confirm the coordination of TC with Zn of ZIF-8. Steady-transient PL, EIS and transient photocurrent response indicate that the combination of two materials favors the carriers? separation and transfer. Further band analysis suggests that interfacial band bending of g-C3N4 promotes the separation of electron-hole and electron diffusion toward ZIF-8. As result, the optimized gC3N4@ZIF-8 exhibits a superior TC degradation rate constant (k = 0.068 min-1), 4.8 times higher than that of gC3N4 (k = 0.014 min-1), and enhanced TC removal rate of 87.6% higher than g-C3N4 (58.6%). Also, the optimized material shows superior degradation rate and removal efficacy in RhB (99.3%) and Cr (VI) (96.6%) in surface water. The investigations on active species and degradation routes (EPR, LC-MS) reveal that synergetic effects of ZIF-8 confined g-C3N4 facilitate the formation of oxygen radicals (?O2- ) and their transformation toward singlet oxygen (1O2) for boosting TC degradation.									59	1	0	0	7	0	60			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000661105400052

Two of these were carried out using molecular gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide) and two using plasma of the same molecules. The textural and chemical modifications produced by these treatments were studied by N-2 and CO2 adsorption at 77 and 273 K, respectively, mercury porosimetry and Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). In addition, the changes in the external surface produced by the treatments were observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Molecular carbon dioxide treatment opens and creates microporosity. However, plasma treatments mainly produce constrictions at the entrance of the micropores. The effect of the molecular treatments on the external surface is not easily observed, while plasmas treatments produce pits on the surface. The statistical analysis of these have been obtained in order to establish their evolution. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Herein, OH-modified SrTiO3 was successfully obtained via a novel low-temperature solid-state precursor method and employed as a catalyst for photocatalytic, piezocatalytic and piezo-photocatalytic hydrogen production. Thanks to the super hydrophilic that is facilitating the contact of catalyst and water molecular and the more oxygen vacancies that can promote electronhole separation, the photocatalytic, piezocatalytic and piezo-photocatalytic hydrogen generation of OH-modified SrTiO3 (OH-STO) is about two times higher than pristine SrTiO3 (STO). It is worth mentioning that the optimal piezo-photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of OH-STO (701.2 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)) is 5.3 times higher than the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution process of STO. This study presents a low-energy approach to the rational design of functional group modification nanomaterials that possess excellent piezo-photocatalytic performance.

However, KFeO2 is sensitive to conditions such as moisture and carbon dioxide, which would trigger severe phase evolution and consequently deteriorate the performance. In this work, we investigated the phase evolution using freshly prepared KFeO2 and KFeO2 after exposure to ambient air and after immersion in water, respectively. We found that the phase evolution of KFeO2 was composed of K-redistribution and phase transition, both of which originated from K+ extraction. We observed that K+ cations were extracted after exposing KFeO2 to ambient air, resulting in the formation of K2CO3 center dot 1.5 H2O outside KFeO2 and lattice expansion inside KFeO2. We also observed that water molecules were crucial to K+ extraction when calculating the function between potassium and the adjacent oxygen atoms via ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Moreover, we successfully reinserted K+ cations into lattice expanded KFeO2 by high-temperature calcination at 900 degrees C; such a reversible extraction-insertion process would have great potential for application in catalyst reactivation and rechargeable high-temperature batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000752459700001	35132975

This single-organism, two-stage H-2 production method circumvents the severe O-2 sensitivity of the reversible hydrogenase by temporally separating photosynthetic O-2 evolution and carbon accumulation(stage 1) from the consumption of cellular metabolites and concomitant H-2 production (stage 2). A transition from stage 1 to stage 2 was effected upon S deprivation of the culture, which reversibly inactivated photosystem II (PSII) and O-2 evolution. Under these conditions, oxidative respiration by the cells in the light depleted O-2 and caused anaerobiosis in the culture, which was necessary and sufficient for the induction of the reversible hydrogenase. Subsequently, sustained cellular H-2 gas production was observed in the light but not in the dark. The mechanism of H-2 production entailed protein consumption and electron transport from endogenous substrate to the cytochrome b(6)-f and PSI complexes in the chloroplast thylakoids. Light absorption by PSI was required for H-2 evolution, suggesting that photoreduction of ferredoxin is followed by electron donation to the reversible hydrogenase. The latter catalyzes the reduction of protons to molecular H-2 in the chloroplast stroma.									753	32	10	0	452	1	805			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000084840300015	10631256

In this paper, we report WS2-MoS2 in-plane few-layer heterostructures that function as efficient photocatalysts. Because of the built-in potential at the epitaxially-grown WS2-MoS2 interface, the electron-hole carriers underwent rapid separation upon irradiation with light, such that the H-2 generation yield rate reached as high as 9.83 mmol g(-1) h(-1). This improved photocatalytic H-2 evolution from purely twodimensional in-plane heterostructures has the potential to deliver outstanding catalysts for solar energy conversion as well as the production of chemical fuels.									31	0	0	0	5	0	31			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000620327200003

The low potential requirement, inhibition of the crossover of gases, and formation of value-added products at the anode are benefits of the electrocatalytic oxidation of organic molecules. Herein, we developed cobalt-nickel-based layered double hydroxide (LDH) as a robust material for the electrocatalytic oxidation of alcohols and urea at the anode, replacing the WOR. A facile synthesis protocol to form LDHs with different ratios of Co and Ni is adapted. It demonstrates that the reactants could be efficiently oxidized to concomitant chemical products at the anode. The half-cell study shows an onset potential of 1.30 V for benzyl alcohol oxidation reaction (BAOR), 1.36 V for glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR), 1.33 V for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), and 1.32 V for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) compared with 1.53 V for WOR. Notably, the hybrid electrolyzer in a full-cell configuration significantly reduces the overall cell voltage at a 20 mA cm(-2) current density by similar to 15% while coupling with the BAOR, EOR, and GOR and similar to 12% with the UOR as the anodic half-cell reaction. Furthermore, the efficiency of hydrogen generation remains unhampered with the types of oxidation reactions (alcohols and urea) occurring at the anode. This work demonstrates the prospects of lowering the overall cell voltage in the case of a water electrolyzer by integrating the hydrogen evolution reaction with suitable organic molecule oxidation.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000800533100032	35377138

The enzyme receives two electrons from NADPH via thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and passes them on to multiple cellular reductases via disulfide exchange. Despite the ubiquity of thioredoxins in all taxa, little is known about the functions of resurrected ancestral thioredoxins in the context of a modern mesophilic organism. Here, we report on functional in vitro and in vivo analyses of seven resurrected Precambrian thioredoxins, dating back 1-4 billion years, in the Escherichia coli cytoplasm. Using synthetic gene constructs for recombinant expression of the ancestral enzymes, along with thermodynamic and kinetic assays, we show that all ancestral thioredoxins, as today's thioredoxins, exhibit strongly reducing redox potentials, suggesting that thioredoxins served as catalysts of cellular reduction reactions from the beginning of evolution, even before the oxygen catastrophe. A detailed, quantitative characterization of their interactions with the electron donor TrxR from Escherichia coli and the electron acceptor methionine sulfoxide reductase, also from E. coli, strongly hinted that thioredoxins and thioredoxin reductases co-evolved and that the promiscuity of thioredoxins toward downstream electron acceptors was maintained during evolution. In summary, our findings suggest that thioredoxins evolved high specificity for their sole electron donor TrxR while maintaining promiscuity to their multiple electron acceptors.									8	1	0	0	8	0	9			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000490729800023	31366732

Moreover, the development of graphene and graphene-like two-dimensional (2D) materials has brought fresh vitality in the field of photocatalysis. Here, we prepared two to four layers of GeTe nanosheets by ultrasonic-assisted liquid-phase exfoliation in argon and air, which we referred to as Ar-GeTe and O-GeTe, respectively. The photocatalytic hydrogen production potential of 2D GeTe was experimentally investigated for the first time. The results indicated that minimally layered GeTe samples are indirect-gap semiconductors with the GeTe band gap increasing after oxidation. All samples have suitable band positions that can drive photocatalytic water splitting into H-2 under mild conditions, providing maximum hydrogen evolution rates of 1.13 mmol g(-1) h(-1) (Ar-GeTe) and 0.54 mmol g(-1) h(-1) (O-GeTe). With density functional theory computations, the structural stability of GeTe in air was discussed, revealing that oxygen atoms could easily combine with Ge to form a more stable structure, thus impacting the photocatalytic performance of 2D GeTe. Therefore, the light requirement and oxygen deficiency of the material give an advantage in the field of energy supply in space.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000563074900028	32643918

Here, we investigated photocatalytic water oxidation on NaTaO3-based photocatalysts. With in situ FT-IR spectroscopy, two new water oxidation intermediates with IR absorption peaks centered at 1058 and 935 cm(-1) were observed and assigned to Ta(vi)& xe001;O and Ta(O-2) peroxo species, respectively. With (H2O)-O-18 as the reactant and (NaTaO3)-O-16 as the photocatalyst, both (OO)-O-16-O-18 and O-18(2) were evolved continuously from overall water splitting as analyzed by mass spectroscopy (MS), demonstrating that the lattice O atoms in NaTaO3-based photocatalysts participate in the formation of O-2 during the reaction. DFT results are consistent with the formation of Ta & xe001;O, (OO)-O-16-O-18 and (OO)-O-18-O-18 intermediates and products, while predicting that several water oxidation pathways are thermodynamically accessible for water oxidation on NaTaO3. Based on these observations, we propose a three-step two-site mechanism for photocatalytic water oxidation on NaTaO3-based photocatalysts in which lattice oxygen plays a key role. The elucidation of the present mechanism should help in broadly understanding water oxidation on semiconductor-based photocatalysts.									17	2	0	0	1	0	17			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000526953200036

A series of catalysts, including PtAu/CB, PtAu/CB400 and PtAu/CB600, with different particle size are synthesized. The particle size of PtAu/CB600 is slightly larger than that of PtAu/CB400 and PtAu/CB, but the electrochemical performance of PtAu/CB600 is the best due to more active sites available in PtAu/CB600. Moreover, the durability of PtAu/CB600 and commercial Pt/C is researched in acidic media. After 5000 cycles accelerated durability test, it can be seen from CV and LSV that PtAu/CB600 shows better stability. Therefore, the better activity and stability of PtAu/CB600 can be ascribed to the ordered structure and the synergistic effect of Pt and Au. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Activation of water reduction in the presence of REM salts in aqueous solution								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				33	3			937	944		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2007.11.025				FEB 2008	2008	When rare earth metal (REM) cations are added into an aqueous solution, the mechanism of the cathodic process on steel is deeply modified. in air-saturated solutions, the potentiodynamic cathodic curves present four distinct zones: a short current plateau due to oxygen reduction, then a straight current increase with a slope value close to 0.12Vdec(-1). Then the cathodic reaction becomes once again diffusion limited before water reduction occurs. In the present work, the mechanism of the cathodic process observed in the second and the third regions is discussed from potentiodynamic experiments performed in 0.5 M sodium chloride solutions, under different hydrodynamic conditions using a rotating steel disk electrode, and as a function of the concentration of REM(III) in the solution, for three different REM cations (yttrium, cerium, and lanthanum). It clearly appears that in the presence of REM(III) in the solution, the reduction of bonded water in the REM(III)-aqua complex is observed at a potential close to the equilibrium potential for water reduction. A simple thermodynamic model is used to estimate the onset potential for water-ligand reduction as a function of the solubility product of the corresponding REM hydroxide.

Formation and evolution of naphthalene radical cations in thermally treated H-ZSM-5 zeolites								MICROPOROUS AND MESOPOROUS MATERIALS				155				82	89		10.1016/j.micromeso.2012.01.001				JUN 1 2012	2012	The effect of zeolite pre-treatment conditions on the ionization of naphthalene, to form naphthalene radical cations, is investigated on H-ZSM-5 with Si/Al ratios of 12 and 18. The ZSM-5 samples were prepared using an all-inorganic route to avoid heating the sample prior to naphthalene adsorption. Naphthalene is adsorbed into ZSM-5 by mixing solid naphthalene with the pre-treated ZSM-5 sample. The samples are characterized using X-ray powder diffraction, nitrogen adsorption isotherms. UV/Vis diffuse-reflectance spectroscopy and ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). The samples are treated in Ar at 780 degrees C or in oxygen at 500 degrees C. Radical cation formation is observed in both cases with a higher ionization yield observed for the oxygen-treated samples and also for the sample with the lower aluminum content (Si/Al similar to 18). Control experiments using silicalite-1 or Na-ZSM-5 show that framework Al and Bronsted acid sites are both needed to form electron-abstracting sites. The time-evolution of the UV/Vis spectra after naphthalene adsorption indicates that after a few hours, the naphthalene radical cation captures an electron from the zeolite framework forming long-lived electron-hole pairs. The rate of formation of the electron-hole pairs as well as details of the electron-hole electronic transitions observed by UV/Vis spectroscopy are different, indicating that the sites generated by the Ar and O-2 treatments are different as well. Oxygen gas treatment at temperatures as low as 200 degrees C lead to the formation of naphthalene radical cations, suggesting that the electron-abstracting sites can be formed during calcination procedures used prior to catalyst testing. These electron-abstracting sites appear to be responsible for the changes in the selectivity of the propane cracking vs. dehydrogenation reaction at high temperatures, as was recently reported.

The oxygen reduction catalyst MnO2 is grown on the nickel foam using a hydrothermal method. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis are employed to characterize the morphology, crystal structure, chemical composition, and pore structure of the electrodes, respectively. The air electrodes are evaluated using constant-current tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. A PTFE: CNT mass ratio of 1:4-2:1 with 3-mm-thick nickel foam yields the optimal performance due to the balance of hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity. When the electrodes are applied in primary zinc-air batteries, the electrode with a PTFE: CNT mass ratio of 1:4 achieves the maximum power density of 95.7 mW cm(-2) with a discharge voltage of 0.8 V at 100 mA cm(-2), and completes stable discharge for over 14400 s at 20 mA cm(-2).

One approach is high-pressure and high-temperature hydrogenation, which results in reduced 'black TiO2' nanoparticles with a crystalline core and a disordered shell that absorbs visible light. Here we elucidate the formation mechanism and structural features of black TiO2 using first-principles-validated reactive force field molecular dynamics simulations of anatase TiO2 surfaces and nanoparticles at high temperature and under high hydrogen pressures. Simulations reveal that surface oxygen vacancies created upon reaction of H-2 with surface oxygen atoms diffuse towards the bulk material but encounter a high barrier for subsurface migration on {001} facets of the nanoparticles, which initiates surface disordering. Besides confirming that the hydrogenated amorphous shell has a key role in the photoactivity of black TiO2, our results provide insight into the properties of the disordered surface layers that are observed on regular anatase nanocrystals under photocatalytic water-splitting conditions.									72	2	0	0	0	0	71			1476-1122	1476-4660		WOS:000445410900018	30013054

M-17. Since the compound seemed to exhibit selective activities against cyanobacteria and such selectivity were considered to be quite rare, the mode of action of argimicin A was investigated. Argimicin A showed a unique delayed action, i.e., the cyanobacterial cell division continued until at least 36 hours treatment even though the decrement of oxygen evolution has been observed at 24 hours treatment. The compound-is concluded to be a photosynthetic inhibitor which interrupts electron transport chain prior to photosystem II. From the preliminary fluorescent spectrum of argimicin A treated cyanobacterial cells, the site of action was speculated to be photo energy transfer from a cyanobacterial specific complex of accessory protein pigments, phycobilisome, to photosystem II.									5	2	0	0	5	0	7			0021-8820			WOS:000181245000015	12715875

Images obtained solely with the supporting electrolyte suggested that the oxide layer is virtually homogenous. However in the presence of ferrocyanide a spectacular contrast was observed. A number of possible sources of image contrast are discussed and in part differentiated. In the presence of ferrocyanide the main mechanism for photoinduced current variations at a gold electrode is the effect of the small temperature change induced by the illumination on the rate of electrooxidation of Fe(II). The origin of the chemical heterogeneity thereby revealed was explored by examining the influence of electrode potential and pretreatment and is ascribed to a chemical species formed below regular monolayer oxide formation. Significantly this ''incipient oxide'' was found to be exceptionally stable, affecting image contrast up to oxygen evolution, and only being removed by prolonged evolution of hydrogen. Intense illumination resulted in a photoinduced aging or reconstruction of the oxide layer.									16	0	0	0	3	0	16			0002-7863			WOS:A1994NG88900035

Unlike short-term energy storage strategies (e.g. batteries and supercapacitors), catalytic conversion of simple molecules to value-added chemicals using renewable energy represents a more long-term solution to the world's energy crisis. Significant advances in density functional theory and low-cost computing in the past decade have enabled the generation of reliable materials data from fundamental physics equations. The paradigm shift towards theory-guided materials design is expected to enhance the catalyst discovery and development process by providing rational guidance to screen viable MXene catalysts more rapidly than an experimental-only approach. In this review, we aim to provide a critical appraisal of the latest theoretical and experimental work on MXenes in the fields of electro- and photocatalytic energy conversion, including relevant reactions involving hydrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen molecules. In the process, we will also be pointing out current limitations in theoretical models, existing scientific gaps and future research directions for this field.									148	6	0	0	17	0	148			2055-6756	2055-6764		WOS:000474586600003

However, the synergism of metal and acid-base pairs for tunable C-H, O-H and C-O cleavage and metal-H strength is under debate in this area. Herein, we present a series of bimetallic PtRu/Zn3Ce1-LDO catalysts, with abundant Lewis acid-base pairs and heterojunction structures at the metal-support interface, exhibiting enhanced performances of transfer hydrogenolysis of glycerol. The key finding is that the incorporation of ZnO unexpectedly induced the formation of large amounts of oxygen vacant sites and surface hydroxyl sites on the CeO(x)support, leading to abundant Lewis acid-base pairs. The strong electron coupling effect of PtRu and Lewis acid-base pairs results in weakened PtRu-H bonding, facilitating a hydrogen transfer reaction. Synergism between enhanced Lewis acid-base pairs and weaker PtRu-H hydride bonding is critical for remarkable catalytic activity (TOF: 526 h(-1)) and selectivity towards glycols (70.8%), and results in one of the best performances in the current literature. Moreover, the influence of hydrogen donors, reaction temperature and time on conversion and product distribution was further investigated in detail. An alternative reaction pathway for the transfer hydrogenolysis of glycerol over the proposed acid-base pair catalysts was proposed and validated with experimental data. The outcome of this work will provide new insights into the rational design of efficient catalytic materials for energy and environmental applications.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000547719400020

In the last couple years, abundant transition metals (and their compounds and hybrids) attracted ever-growing attention as the alternatives of noble metals. Particularly the layered transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDs) are interesting with their stability and promising electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the neat TMDs are often poor in terms of the abundance of catalytically active sites and electrical conductivity, which limit their application potential significantly. Herein, as a proof-of-concept, we report on the design of a high-performance electrocatalyst system formed by the decoration of ultrasmall molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) nanosheets on carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The ultrasmall MoS2 nanosheets provide distorted lattice, confined size and rich defects, which endows the resulting electrocatalysts (MoS2/CNT) with abundant active sites. The CNTs, on the other hand, serve as the conductive net for ensuring electrocatalytic performance. As a result, the hybrid electrocatalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for HER, achieving a large current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at overpotential of only 281 mV and a small Tafel slope of 43.6 mV dec(-1) along with a decent stability. Our results are of high interest for electrocatalyst technologists as well as hydrogen fuel researchers. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In plants and algae, peroxisomes connect biosynthetic and oxidative metabolic routes and compartmentalize potentially lethal steps of metabolism such as the formation of reactive oxygen species and glyoxylate, thus preventing poisoning of the cell and futile recycling. Peroxisomes exhibit properties resembling inside-out vesicles and possess special systems for the import of specific proteins, which form multi-enzyme complexes (metabolons) linking numerous reactions to flavin-dependent oxidation, coupled to the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide by catalase. Hydrogen peroxide and superoxide originating in peroxisomes are important mediators in signal transduction pathways, particularly those involving salicylic acid. By contributing to the synthesis of oxalate, formate and other organic acids, peroxisomes regulate major fluxes of primary and secondary metabolism. The evolutionary diversity of algae has led to the presence of a wide range of enzymes in the peroxisomes that acre only similar to higher plants in their direct predecessors, the Charophyceae. The appearance of seed plants was connected to the acquirement by storage tissues, of a peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation function linked to the glyoxylate cycle, which is induced during seed germination and maturation. Rearrangement of the peroxisomal photorespiratory function between different tissues of higher plants led to the appearance of different types of photosynthetic metabolism. The peroxisome may therefore have played a key role in the evolutionary formation of metabolic networks, via establishing interconnections between different metabolic compartments.

Herein, the coherent effects of local atomic and electronic structure in Li2RuxMn1_xO3 (LRMO) with a wide voltage window (1.3-4.8 V) is identified by in situ X-ray absorption fine spec-troscopy (XAFS) and chemometrics. We not only skillfully separated the redox active structures to track the electrochemical path, but also visualized the coupling mechanism between the evolution of Ru-Ru dimer and the (de) excitation of cations and anions. Furthermore, introducing manganese triggers the "heterogeneity" of coordination environment and electronic structure between Ru and Mn after dis-charge to 3 V. The change of thermodynamic and kinetic paths affects the relithiation, and further leads to the hysteresis of the anion activation structure relaxation of Li2Ru0.4Mn0.6O3 relative to Li2RuO3 (LRO). Additionally, it is demonstrated that the high charge cut-off voltage restrains the relaxation of anionic active structure in LRO from a new perspective through comparative experiments. Our work associates the evolution of atomic structure with charge compensation and negative electrochemical reactions such as voltage hysteresis (VH) and capacity attenuation, deepening the understanding electrochemical reac-tion mechanism of LLOs during the first cycle and providing a theoretical support for the further design and synthesis of high-efficiency cathodes.(c) 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Although activating strategies, such as defects and composition engineering, have led to remarkable activity gains, there remains the requirement for better performance that aims for real device applications. We report here a phosphorus-doping-induced phase transition from cubic to orthorhombic phases in CoSe2. It has been found that the achieved orthorhombic CoSe2 with appropriate phosphorus dopant (8 wt%) needs the lowest over-potential of 104 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1M KOH, with onset potential as small as -31 mV. This catalyst demonstrates negligible activity decay after 20 h of operation. The striking catalysis performance can be attributed to the favorable electronic structure and local coordination environment created by this doping-induced structural phase transition strategy.									255	9	0	0	20	0	255			2041-1723			WOS:000436549100006	29955067

However, seawater has detrimental effects on the stability and activity of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts under different pH conditions. In this work, we report the synthesis of binary metallic core-sheath nitride@oxynitride electrocatalysts [Ni-(ETM)](delta+) -[O-N](delta-), where ETM is an early transition metal V or Cr. Using NiVN on a nickel foam (NF) substrate, we demonstrate an HER overpotential as low as 32 mV at -10 mA cm(-2) in saline water (0.6 M NaCl). The results represent an advancement in saline water HER performance of earth-abundant electrocatalysts, especially under near-neutral pH range (i.e., pH 6-8). Doping ETMs in nickel oxynitrides accelerates the typically rate-determining H2O dissociation step for HER and suppresses chloride deactivation of the catalyst in neutral-pH saline water. Heterointerface synergism occurs through H2O adsorption and dissociation at interfacial oxide character, while adsorbed H* proceeds via Heyrovsky or Tafel step on the nitride character. This electrocatalyst showed stable performance under a constant current density of -50 mA cm(-2) for 50 h followed by additional 50 h at -100 mA cm(-2) in a neutral saline electrolyte (1 M PB + 0.6 M NaCl). Contrarily, under the same conditions, Pt/C@NF exhibited significantly low performance after a mere 4 h at -50 mA cm(-2). The low Tafel slope of 25 mV dec(-1) indicated that the reaction is Tafel limited, unlike commercial Pt/C, which is Heyrovsky limited. We close by discussing general principles concerning surface charge delocalization for the design of HER electrocatalysts in pH saline environments.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000752869700004	34730350

Accordingly, hydrogen production is a crucial issue nowadays. Different polymers are applied to attain the purpose. Among all polymers, biodegradables polymers are the best choices to develop the main aim. Polysaccharides and proteins are biodegradable polymers with unique places and advantages with regards to their ecofriendly properties. There are different techniques to apply and achieve the foremost purpose. It is worthwhile to mention that green and facile methods are always attracting attention in different aspects and fields. The three non-polluting and economical techniques, that is, electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), photocatalytic technique, and hydrolysis of hydrides, are reviewed in this paper.

Interestingly, the carbon doped g-C3N4 displayed an increased specific surface area and a more negative conduction band energy level, which not only provided a large number of reaction sites for the photocatalytic hydrogen production, but also effectively enhances the separation of photogenerated electrons-holes. And the experimental results showed that the hydrogen evolution rate of the optimal sample was as high as 320 mu mol-h(-1), which is 29.10 times than that of bulk g-C3N4 (11 mu mol-h(-1)). More importantly, this work may provide a promising idea for the design of efficient g-C(3)N4 by controlling the material morphology and combining the electronic modulation strategy.

Literature comparisons using similar methods are scant and inconclusive. To clarify differences (or similarities) between coal- and biomass-derived chars, we performed a systematic study using three different carbon-based solids at different stages of coalification.Two biomass materials and a low-rank coal were demineralized and heat-treated between 550 and 1450 degrees C. Even after heat treatment, biomass-derived chars remained less structurally ordered, more microporous, and more reactive towards oxygen than their coal-derived counterparts. Through computational chemistry, we compared the thermodynamic driving forces and kinetic barriers for biomass-like and coal-like representative graphene clusters. The oxidation pathway to CO was the same for both clusters, but different for CO2 formation. We predict that the energy barrier of CO desorption is higher for coal-derived chars, whereas that of CO2 desorption is higher for biomass-derived chars: this is consistent with the dominant formation of CO2 at the relatively low reaction temperatures used in our study. We demonstrate also that in a kinetically controlled reaction regime, in the absence of catalytically active minerals, the reactivity differences can be explained on the basis of differences in char surface chemistry.

To provide new insight into the mechanism underlying the pH-dependent activity of the electrooxidation reaction, we performed UV-vis spectroelectrochemical detection of the intermediate species for water oxidation by a manganese oxide electrode. Layered manganese oxide nanoparticles, delta-MnO2 (K-0.17[Mn0.904+Mn0.073+square 0.03]O-2 center dot 0.53H(2)O) deposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide electrodes were shown to catalyze water oxidation at pH from 4 to 13. At this pH range, a sharp rise in absorption at 510 nm was observed with a concomitant increase of anodic current for O-2 evolution. Using pyrophosphate as a probe molecule, the 510 nm absorption was attributable to Mn3+ on the surface of delta-MnO2. The onset potential of the water oxidation current was constant at approximately 1.5 V vs SHE from pH 4 to pH 8, but sharply shifted to negative at pH > 8. Strikingly, this behavior was well reproduced by the pH dependence of the onset of 510 nm absorption, indicating that Mn3+ acts as the precursor of water oxidation. Mn3+ is unstable at pH < 9 due to the dispropottionation reaction resulting in the formation of Mn2+ and Mn4+, whereas it is effectively stabilized by the comproportionation of Mn2+ and Mn4+ in alkaline conditions. Thus, the low activity of manganese oxides for water oxidation under neutral conditions is most likely due to the inherent instability of Mn3+, whose accumulation at the surface of catalysts requires the electrochemical oxidation of Mn2+ at a potential of approximately 1.4 V. This new model suggests that the control of the disproportionation and comproportionation efficiencies of Mn3+ is essential for the development of Mn catalysts that afford water oxidation with a small overpotential at neutral pH.									398	14	0	0	47	0	403			0002-7863			WOS:000301084400034	22206433

While this terminology is educatively useful to explain bioluminescence, it gives a false idea that all luminous organisms are using identical or homologous molecular tools to achieve light emission. As usually observed in biology, reality is more complex. To date, at least 11 different luciferins have indeed been discovered, and several non-homologous luciferases lato sensu have been identified which, all together, confirms that bioluminescence emerged independently multiple times during the evolution of living organisms. While some phylogenetically related organisms may use non-homologous luciferases (e.g., at least four convergent luciferases are found in Pancrustacea), it has also been observed that phylogenetically distant organisms may use homologous luciferases (e.g., parallel evolution observed in some cnidarians, tunicates and echinoderms that are sharing a homologous luciferasebased system). The evolution of luciferases then appears puzzling. The present review takes stock of the diversity of known "bioluminescent proteins," their evolution and potential evolutionary origins. A total of 134 luciferase and photoprotein sequences have been investigated (from 75 species and 11 phyla), and our analyses identified 12 distinct types-defined as a group of homologous bioluminescent proteins. The literature review indicated that genes coding for luciferases and photoproteins have potentially emerged as new genes or have been co-opted from ancestral non-luciferase/photoprotein genes. In this latter case, the homologous gene's co-options may occur independently in phylogenetically distant organisms.									5	0	0	0	3	0	5				2296-7745		WOS:000669506500001

Thin films were prepared over F-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrate using suspension of the SC powders in ethylene glycol followed by drying at 600 degrees C. Absorption spectrum measures the direct band gap of In2O3 as 3.60 eV along with an indirect gap of 2.78 eV. Scanning electron microscopy reveals the agglomerated nature of In2O3 particle whereas X-ray diffraction analysis confirms presence of cubic crystallites with preferably (222) orientation. With the gradual rise in annealing temperature (600-900 degrees C), the size of the crystallites as well as their quality improves, as evident through transmission electron microscopy and PL emission spectra. The In2O3 semiconductor thin films exhibit significant photoelectrochemical activity and long term stability in terms of oxygen evolution reaction from water. The sample annealed at an optimized temperature of 800 degrees C exhibits the highest photo-current of 1.15 mA cm(-2) for H2O -> O-2 oxidation reaction (in 0.1 M Na2SO4 - pH7, PBS), at 1.51 V vs. RHE (1.23 V vs. NHE) under illumination of 35 mW cm(-2). Electrochemical impedance spectra (Mott-Schottky) analysis confirms n-type conductivity for the semiconductors, whereas the action spectra suggest similar to 40% incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for the optimized materials.

Platinum (Pt)-based catalysts represent the benchmark performance but are less studied for HER under high current densities in neutral electrolytes due to their high cost, poor stability, and extra water dissociation step. Here a facile and low-temperature synthesis for constructing "blackberry-shaped" Pt nanocrystals on copper (Cu) foams with low loading as self-standing electrodes for HER in neutral media is proposed. Optimized hydrogen adsorption free energy and robust interaction induced by charge density exchange between Pt and Cu ensure the efficient and robust HER, especially under high current densities, which are demonstrated from both experimental and theoretical approaches. The electrode exhibits small overpotentials of 35 and 438 mV to reach current densities of -10 and -1000 mA cm(-2), respectively. Meanwhile the electrode illustrates outstanding stability during chronoamperometry measurement under high current densities (-100 to -400 mA cm(-2)) and 1000 cycles linear sweep voltammetry tests reaching -1000 mA cm(-2). This study provides new design strategies for self-standing electrocatalysts by fabricating robust metal-metal interactions between active materials and current collectors, thus facilitating the stable function of electrodes for HER under technologically relevant high current densities.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000682383000001

The effect of <1 wt% of Pd loadings on polarization resistance of Ni/GDC cermet anodes for H-2 oxidation reaction was examined using symmetric Ni-GDC20IGDC20IPt electrolyte-supported cells at 400-600 degrees C. Nanostructure evolution before and after H-2 reduction at 600 degrees C and also after anodic performance test revealed effectiveness of PdO loading content on the nanoparticles architecture, with Pdaas the sole Pd-phase after calcination at 600 degrees C with no residual chloride. In the process of H-2 reduction in high loading of PdO (0.26 mg/cm(2)), a nano-grained network of metallic palladium (Pd-0) containing nanopores structure, which resulted from 40% volume deoxidizing shrinkage of PdO, was developed on the anode surface. But, in the case of small loading, PdHx phase indicating of H affinity of palladium and minute amounts of PdO on NiO were detected. The significant decrease of anodic polarization resistance, e.g. similar to 100 times at 500 degrees C, on highly Pd-infiltrated anode was accompanied with <= 40 nm agglomerates in Pd-nanonetwork and 45% oxidizing of Pd to PdO in H-2 environment. Detailed anodic impedance analysis and activation energy (E-a) evaluation can be denoted to a balance between the E-a of reaction-limiting step of charge transfer and the E-a of the facilitating step of diffusion/adsorption/dissociation of the arrived O2- species to triple phase boundaries (TPBs). Our findings verified that oxygen spillovering on the Pd-0/PdO-pair nanocoating caused by the shift of the TPBs to the nanocoating-pair for H-2 oxidation reaction in LT-SOFC.

Herein, we reported a novel 2D hybrid electrocatalyst containing Mo-doped WC core with particle size of similar to 5 nm embedded into N-doped carbon shells (Mo-WC@NCS) through a carbonization treatment of Mo-doped W/Zn bimetallic-imidazolate frameworks. Benefiting from large surface area and optimized electronic structure, the achieved Mo-WC@NCS hybrid displayed a low overpotential of 179 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 81 mV dec(-1) for HER in base, showing almost the best performance among all previously reported WC-based hybrid HER electrocatalysts. This Mo-WC@NCS hybrid also delivered robust HER catalytic activities in both acidic and neutral media. Experimental observations and theoretical calculations demonstrated that the d-band center of W in Mo-WC@NCS hybrid was obviously downshifted after Mo dopants, which was beneficial to modulate the electronic structure of the W centers and thereby facilitated the H desorption, thus boosting hydrogen generation. Acting as a cathode in alkaline-acid Zn-H2O fuel cell, the Mo-WC@NCS hybrid delivered a power density of up to 41.4 mW cm(-2) and maintained a long-term stability for H-2 generation.									95	10	0	0	4	0	94			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000546641600018

Here we demonstrate a simple one-step reduction process that can in situ grow plasmonic silver nanoparticles on the surface of AgTaO3. The exsolution of silver out of AgTaO3 does not seem to have a significant impact on the crystal integrity, whilst its visible light sensitivity is greatly enhanced. Such Ag nanoparticles decorated AgTaO3 system showed improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution both under visible and full range irradiation. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The influence of solvent and ionic liquid content on the assemble behavior of the cyanuric acidmelamine complex is studied in detail, respectively. It is found that the as-prepared hollow g-C3N4 spheres possess plenty of mesopores with a high surface area, which is related to the release of volatile domains and decomposition of ionic liquids. Moreover, as-prepared g-C3N4 exhibit improved light absorption in visible ranges, faster separation rate of photogenerated hole-electron pairs than the bulk carbon nitride. Besides, the as-prepared hollow mesoporous carbon nitride exhibits almost 30 times higher than traditional g-C3N4 which calcined by melamine for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction under visible light irradiation, which may be caused by the fact that the high surface area is beneficial for improving light absorption in visible ranges, and finally enhancing the H-2 evolution rate. This method paves new opportunities for designing other catalysts with high surface area. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The main channels of destruction of the admixture of Freon in air are analyzed, and the products thus formed are identified. It is shown that the dissociation processes involving charged particles and oxygen atoms play an important part in the destruction of Freon. It is established that, in the process of treating a mixture containing C2Cl3F3, successive destruction occurs of chlorofluorocarbons formed at the preceding stage, and Cl-2 and SiF4 molecules are the predominant products at the final stage of the process. The destruction of C-CI and C-C bonds in CFC molecules occurs mainly at the initial stage of the process, and it is only after this that stronger C-F bonds are destroyed in fluorine-enriched reaction products. It is shown that Freon destruction processes in nanosecond corona and microwave discharges exhibit the same behavior defined by high values of reduced electric field in such discharges. The experimental results lead one to a conclusion about the promise held by the application of nanosecond discharges for the purification of industrial waste-from Freons.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0018-151X			WOS:000083118700018

The crystallite characterization and morphology were examined via XRD and SEM. The electrochemical properties were examined via cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in saturated sodium chloride. Through the study of different series of Ti/IrO2-Ta2O5 anodes, we find that the preparation conditions have a great impact on the electrode catalytic activity. Experimental results indicate that the electrochemically active surface area is determined by the content and morphology of the anode coating. When the IrO2 content and the preparation temperature are 70% and 500 degrees C, the surface of the electrode is aggregated with segregated crystallite flower-like particles, which brings about the best electrode catalytic activity. The current density in the chlorine evolution reaction of IrO2-Ta2O5 (70% and 500 degrees C) is 0.4 A cm(-2) in saturated sodium chloride. The properties and sterilization effect of EO water are closely related to the electrode catalytic activity. The higher the current density is in chlorine evolution, the higher the available chlorine and HClO content. When the IrO2 content is 70% and the preparation temperature is 500 degrees C, the maximum values of the killing logarithm value and killing rate are 3.01-3.05 and 99.9023-99.9109%, respectively. In addition, when the Ti substrate undergoes 40 minutes of activation treatment, the Ti/IrO2-Ta2O5 anodes have the highest stability.									30	2	0	0	3	0	31			2046-2069			WOS:000347721300030

As a result of mixing and light attenuation in a PBR, microalgae experience light-dark cycles that could enhance, or reduce, PBR productivity.The objective of this study was to develop and validate a mechanistic model that describes net specific photosynthetic oxygen production of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii under flashing light in the range of 100 to 1 Hz. The model is based on the biomass specific light absorption rate and the dissipation rate of excess absorbed photons. Net oxygen production is a direct measure of biomass growth.The model describes specific photosynthetic oxygen production based on the availability of reducing equivalents (electrons), which result from the light reactions. Electrons accumulate during the flash and serve as a pool for carbon dioxide fixation during the dark leading to partial or full light integration. Both, electron consumption and photon dissipation rates are based on a Monod-type kinetic relation.The underlying assumption of an electron pool appeared functional and its filling and emptying depended on the flash time. The simulations show that if the dark time between flashes is not sufficiently long the pool will not be completely emptied, and is responsible for a high energy dissipation rate and reduced photosynthesis. The measured net specific oxygen production rates are described well, but the description of the specific photon dissipation rate will need further investigation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

It binds FAD and three substrates, producing dTMP (2'-deoxythymidine-5'-monophosphate) from dUMP (2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate). However, ThyX proteins also act as NADPH oxidase by reacting directly with O-2. In the present study we investigated the dynamic interplay between the substrates and their role in competing with this wasteful and potentially harmful oxidase reaction in catalytically efficient ThyX from Paramecium bursaria Chlorella virus-1. dUMP binding accelerates the O-2-insensitive half-reaction between NADPH and FAD by over four orders of magnitude to similar to 30 s(-1). Thus, although dUMP does not have a direct role in FAD reduction, any turnover with molecular O-2 requires its presence. Inversely, NADPH accommodation accelerates dUMP binding similar to 3-fold and apparently precedes dUMP binding under physiological conditions. In the oxidative half-reaction, excess CH2H4 folate (N-5,N-10-methylene-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate) was found to reoxidize FADH(2) within 1 ms, thus very efficiently competing with FADH(2) oxidation by O-2 (1.5 s(-1) under aerobic conditions). The resulting reaction scheme points out how the interplay between the fast reactions with the native substrates, although not rate-limiting for overall catalysis, avoids NADPH oxidase activity in aerobic micro-organisms, including many pathogens. These observations also explain why ThyX proteins are also present in aerobic micro-organisms.									7	0	0	0	7	0	7			0264-6021	1470-8728		WOS:000333718700004	24422556	
J	Cheng, Yao-Lin; Hsieh, Chi-Tien; Ho, Yeu-Shiuan; Shen, Min-Hsiu; Chao, Tzu-Hsuan; Cheng, Mu-Jeng								Examination of the Bronsted-Evans-Polanyi relationship for the hydrogen evolution reaction on transition metals based on constant electrode potential density functional theory								PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS				24	4			2476	2481		10.1039/d1cp05723e		JAN 2022		JAN 26 2022	2022	In the search for efficient and inexpensive electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the hydrogen binding energy (Delta G(*H)) is often used as a descriptor to represent the catalytic activity. The success of this approach relies on the Bronsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) relationship. In this study, we used constant electrode potential density functional theory calculations to examine this relationship. Eight fcc metals with a low hydrogen adsorption concentration of 1/9 were used as the model systems. We found that the HER kinetic barriers are indeed correlated to the Delta G(*H). Both the Delta G(*H)S of the hollow site and less favourable top site correlate to the kinetic barriers; however, the correlation is better for the latter. This behaviour leads to a set of equations for estimating the HER kinetic barriers with improved accuracy that can be used to predict the HER performance of the materials with a low hydrogen adsorption concentration. This work demonstrates the importance of calculating the Delta G(*H) of a suitable adsorption site to establish good BEP relationships.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000742075500001	35022624

A reaction front combustion model was also proposed, coupled with effect of char gasification, to predict the key parameters of char combustion in the O-2/CO2 atmospheres. The combustion process and particle evolution of coarse chars were observed and measured to calculate the carbon conversion. Experimental results showed that the burnout time of the char particle in the O-2/CO2 atmosphere in the was prolonged about 20-25%, compared to the burnout time of chars in air. The overall reaction rates of char particles in the O-2/CO2 atmosphere were lower than the rates in the air for different particle sizes. In addition, reaction rates from model prediction showed good agreements with the experimental data for different particle sizes both in the air and O-2/CO2 atmospheres, which proved the reaction front combustion model was applicable for the char combustion in this study. The reaction front combustion model also predicted that the reaction front decreased with burning time and mass consumption of char particle. For the char combustion in the O-2/CO2 atmosphere, the gasification with CO2 absorbed part of the combustion heat or radiation heat and caused lower particle temperatures and heat fluxes for different particle sizes. The proposed combustion model also predicted that although the effect of the gasification reaction was dominant at the beginning of combustion and then reduced, the conversion of particles was hindered compared to the combustion of char in air.									17	1	0	0	0	0	18			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000441893200019

In this study, we report Co/CoN Janus nanoparticles embedded in a porous nitrogen doped carbon (Co/CoN-NC) composite catalyst, derived by the heat treatment of a Co2+ containing polymer in ammonia atmosphere. The as-obtained hybrid catalyst showed excellent electrocatalytic activities for the hydrogen evolution reaction in both acidic and basic media, and it delivered a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at the overpotential of 160 mV in 1 M KOH and 190 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. In addition, the catalyst could sustain potentiostatic electrolysis for at least 100 hours at 10 mA cm(-2) in both acidic and alkaline solutions. Mechanistic study suggested that the high activity of the composite electrocatalyst originated from the Janus effects between Co and CoN, which enhanced the electron transfer efficiency and led to fast hydrogen adsorption and desorption kinetics.									30	1	0	0	4	0	31			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000438934700026

J	Bai, Jing Yang; Wang, Li Jie; Zhang, Yi Jun; Wen, Chun Fang; Wang, Xue Lu; Yang, Hua Gui								Carboxyl functionalized graphite carbon nitride for remarkably enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution								APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL				266						118590	10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.118590				JUN 5 2020	2020	Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has recently emerged as a promising candidate for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, but only showed limited activity owing to its sluggish photogenerated carriers separation and migration. Herein, the carboxyl-functionalized g-C3N4 (OCN) was synthesized by a grafting post-treatment method to alleviate the negative influences from this intrinsic drawback. As a result, the surface carboxyl groups greatly improve charge carrier dynamics to suppress carriers recombination via the driving force originated from its electron-withdrawing effects. The resultant O-CN exhibits 52 times higher hydrogen evolution rate than the pristine, and possesses a high apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 15.7 % at 420 +/- 15 nm. This work deepens the understanding of the surface group related modifications for photocatalytic materials, further providing a promising approach for rational design of photocatalysts with highly efficient solar energy conversion.									36	3	0	0	4	0	38			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000517665200004

Here, conductive nickel foam is proposed to be used as a substrate to support (Fe,Ni)(OH)(2) nanosheet arrays and a reducing agent to reduce Ru3+ ions to metallic Ru. The formed 3D self-supported Ru/(Fe,Ni)(OH)(2)/NF (denoted as RFNOH) with a superhydrophilic surface and high conductivity ensures rapid release of gases and efficient electron transportation and mass transfer at a high current density. The resultant RFNOH requires an overpotential of only 152 mV to achieve a current density of 1 A cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction in 1 m KOH solution, along with excellent stability at high current density. Meanwhile, density functional theory calculations suggest that (Fe,Ni)(OH)(2) promotes the dissociation of water molecules considerably, which plays a critical role in enhancing the generation of molecular hydrogen on Ru nanoparticles. Furthermore, the proposed dual-active site mechanism solves the problem of low water-dissociation efficiency faced by noble metal-based catalysts under alkaline media. This study provides a new route for the practical production of large quantities of hydrogen via electrochemical water splitting.									41	0	0	0	4	0	41			2366-9608			WOS:000509378900001

Here, this study presents a p-type ZrO2 nanoplate-decorated ZrO2 nanowire photocathode with a high photoconversion efficiency that makes it potentially viable for commercial solar H-2 production. The composition of oxygen vacancy defects, low charge carrier transport property, and high specific surface area of these as-grown hierarchical nanowires are further improved by an hydrofluoric acid (HF) treatment, which causes partial delamination and produces a thin amorphous ZrO2 layer on the surface of the as-grown nanostructured film. The presence of different types of oxygen vacancies (neutral, singly charged, and doubly charged defects) and their compositional correlation to the Zrx+ oxidation states (4 > x > 2) are found to affect the charge transfer process, the p-type conductivity, and the photocatalytic activity of the ZrO2 nanostructured film. The resulting photocathode provides the highest overall photocurrent (-42.3 mA cm(-2) at 0 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) among all the photocathodes reported to date, and an outstanding 3.1% half-cell solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency with a Faradaic efficiency of 97.8%. Even more remarkable is that the majority of the photocurrent (69%) is produced in the visible light region.									19	2	0	0	1	0	19			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000424152200004

However, they commonly suffer from performance fading because of carbon corrosion under harsh oxidative environments in Li-O-2 batteries. Herein, an elegant cathode material for Li-O-2 batteries is developed through doping Se in carbon. The results show that the Se-doped carbon cathode reveals 53% higher discharge capacity, decreased overpotential and superior rate capability. Structure evolution analysis and density functional theory calculation reveal that the products mainly grow via solution driven mechanism, which can better sustain discharge. Se-doped carbon cathode also presents high stability due to its prominent antioxidant ability, efficiently suppressing the side reaction and cathode passivation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, their large-scale fabrication remains a great challenge. Here, we report a self-supported electrocatalyst in the form of Fe-doped Ni3S2 nanoparticles in-situ grown on three-dimensional (3D) conductive Fe-Ni alloy foam (Fe-Ni3S2/AF) by surface-assisted chemical vapor transport (SACVT) method. Homogeneous growth environment and scalability of SACVT method allow Fe-Ni3S2 nanoparticles uniformly growing on AF in large-scale. Fe-Ni3S2/AF exhibits high activity and durability when act as HER catalyst and OER precatalyst in alkaline media. The HER and OER overpotential at 10 mA/cm(2) is considerably small, only 75 and 267 mV, respectively. Moreover, the electrolyzer assembled by Fe-Ni3S2/AF for overall water splitting exhibits a low cell voltage and high durability in long-term test. Based on experiments and theoretical calculation, the significantly enhanced activity could be originated from the incorporation of Fe, which contributed to increase the electrochemical active surface area, enhance electrical conductivity, optimize the hydrogen and H2O adsorption energy of Ni3S2 (101) surface in HER, and form active bimetallic Ni-Fe(oxy)hydroxide in OER. The excellent durability of self-supported Fe-Ni3S2/AF could be benefited from the in-situ growth of Fe-Ni3S2 nanoparticles on 3D AF, which could ensure closely mechanical adhesion between active materials and substrate, promote charge transport and increase surface area. This work provides a facile method for large-scale synthesis of electrocatalysts with high activity and long-term durability for efficient water electrolysis in alkaline media.									20	1	0	0	1	0	20			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000638526100002

Morphology control as a promising and effective strategy is widely implemented to change the surface atomic coordination and thus enhance the intrinsic catalytic performance of current electrocatalysts. Herein, a series of cobalt phosphide (CoP) electrocatalysts with tunable morphologies of nanosheets, nanowires, nanorods, and nanoblocks have been prepared for the enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by only adjusting the amount of ammonium fluoride (NH4F) in the hydrothermal process. Benefiting from the large active area, high surface activity, and favorable ion and gas diffusion channels, the clustered CoP nanorods obtained at a concentration of 0.15 M NH4F show the best HER performance with only an overpotential of 71 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 60.75 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH. After 3000 CV cycles and 24 h durability tests, there is only a very slight degradation of performance owing to its outstanding stability and robust substrate adhesion.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000675430900072	34191500

Meanwhile, graphitic carbon nitride is a non-metallic polymer that has been widely used in the environmental and energy conversion fields due to its abundant precursor species and simple process of synthesis. In this study, an amorphous carbon nitride/NiO/CoN-based composite (Ni-Co-CN) is in situ fabricated via simple one-step pyrolysis; it displays high capacitive performance and efficient electrocatalytic capability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Specifically, the optimized Ni-Co-CN electrode shows an ultra -high areal specific capacitance of 18.8 F cm(-2) at 2 mA cm(-2) in 3 M KOH electrolyte, and it retains 91.4% of its areal specific capacitance even after 10 000 cycles of CV scans. Upon being used as an electrocatalyst in the OER process, the overpotential of Ni-Co-CN can reach 195 mV versus a reference hydrogen electrode (RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2), which is far lower than those of most reported Ni/Cobased catalysts. Additionally, the potential loss of Ni-Co-CN electrode is less than 1% after a long-term durability test over 60 h. The experimental results integrated with density functional theoretical calculations reveal that the excellent performance of the Ni-Co-CN self -supported electrode can be ascribed to the fast redox reduction of multi-valent transition metal ions, abundant surface defects and plentiful nano -scaled porous structures. This work provides a promising strategy for exploring methods to combine economic Ni/Co-based compounds with carbon -based materials to obtain low-cost yet efficient electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage and conversion.									20	1	0	0	1	0	20			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000524947900049	32091065

The morphology and composition characterization show that the composite has a flower-like structure with a large number of edges and surfaces exposed, and the content of the 1T phase in MoS2 is 63%. 1T-MoS2/NiCo2S4/CC exhibits an overpotential of 107 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and a Tafel slope of 66.4 mV dec(-1) in an alkaline electrolyte. After continuous electrolysis for 24 h at an overpotential of 170 mV, 86% of the original current density was retained in an chronoamperometry measurement. The outstanding catalytic performance of the composite is ascribed to its unique structure, high 1T-MoS2 content and the synergistic catalysis between 1T-MoS2 and NiCo2S4. This work provides a facile and effective strategy for fabricating the 1T-MoS2/NiCo2S4/CC composite and demonstrates that the composite is expected to be a competitive non-noble HER catalyst.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000691695000001	34608913

The obtained integrated catalyst (3-D CNF@CoP/NC) consists of CoP/NC polyhedra with abundant active sites as the "neurons" and carbon nanofibers as the "axons", and displayed remarkable activity with an overpotential of 64.5 mV and 105.6 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH respectively and good stability with negligible current change after 80 h of chronoamperometric measurement or 4000 CV cycles.

However, the inappropriate binding with H* and sluggish reaction kinetics limit their overall HER performance, especially in alkaline electrolyte. Herein, we report a robust and high active HER electrocatalyst with optimized metal-H* interaction and low water dissociation energy barrier through interatomic d-p orbital hybridization. The Ru nanoparticles with mean size down to 1.7 nm are anchored on two-dimension nitrogen-doped carbon nanocone arrays via a facile aqueous-organic interfacial method. This unique architecture induces strong interaction between Ru and the carbon support. Electrons are transferred from Ru to the N-doped carbon, causing a shift of charge distribution and modified surface properties of Ru. Furthermore, the newly emerged Ru-N bonds endow the catalyst with high structure robustness. As a result, the catalyst exhibits superior HER performances in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes, with low overpotentials (31 and 29 mV at 10 mA cm-2 respectively), high H2 turn over frequency (2.20 s- 1 at the overpotential of 25 mV) and excellent durability (10,000 cycles). The density functional theory calculations reveal that the boosted HER activity can be attributed to the downshift of the d-band center of Ru, which lowers the |Delta G(H*)| and accelerates the H-OH cleavage.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000655649500003

The NP embedded in a porous SiC/C nanocomposite matrix is synthesized via a single-source-precursor approach which involves the reaction of allylhydridopolycarbosilane with MoO2(acac)(2). Thermal treatment of the single-source-precursor up to 1400 degrees C in a protective atmosphere results in the in situ formation of nanocrystalline Mo3+2xSi3C0.6 immobilized in a thermally and corrosion-stable SiC/C matrix. The weight fractions of the observed crystalline phases Mo3+2xSi3C0.6 and SiC amount to ca. 28 (26) and 72 (74) wt%, respectively, when prepared at 1400 degrees C (1350 degrees C). The porosity of the formed nanocomposite is adjusted by the addition of polystyrene (PS) as a pore former to the single-source-precursor resulting in a specific surface area up to 206 m(2)/g. The electrocatalytic activity of the Mo3+2xSi3C0.6/C/SiC nanocomposite with respect to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is characterized by low over potentials of 22 and 138 mV vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for applying 1 and 10 mA cm(-2) of current density, respectively. The analyzed electrocatalytic performance exceeds that of most Mo-based electrocatalysts and shows high stability (over 90%) during 35 hours.									23	2	0	0	6	0	24			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000483984100001

The evolution of the electronic structure of the surface has been characterized by near-ambient-pressure photoemission and mimics the inverse two-step sequence observed in the electro-oxidation of platinum, i.e. the surface-oxidized platinum species are reduced first and then the adsorbed species desorb in a second step leading to a surface dominated by metallic platinum. The comparison with measurements performed under high-vacuum conditions suggests that the reduction process is mainly induced by the reactive species generated by the radiolysis of water. When the photon flux is decreased, then the reduction process becomes slower.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				1600-5775		WOS:000474454400045	31274456

Until now, cable bacteria have only been reported from marine environments. In this study, we demonstrate that cable bacteria also occur in freshwater sediments. In a first step, homogenized sediment collected from the freshwater stream Giber angstrom, Denmark, was incubated in the laboratory. After 2 weeks, pH signatures and electric fields indicated electron transfer between vertically separated anodic and cathodic half-reactions. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed the presence of Desulfobulbaceae filaments. In addition, in situ measurements of oxygen, pH, and electric potential distributions in the waterlogged banks of Giber angstrom demonstrated the presence of distant electric redox coupling in naturally occurring freshwater sediment. At the same site, filamentous Desulfobulbaceae with cable bacterium morphology were found to be present. Their 16S rRNA gene sequence placed them as a distinct sister group to the known marine cable bacteria, with the genus Desulfobulbus as the closest cultured lineage. The results of the present study indicate that electric currents mediated by cable bacteria could be important for the biogeochemistry in many more environments than anticipated thus far and suggest a common evolutionary origin of the cable phenotype within Desulfobulbaceae with subsequent diversification into a freshwater and a marine lineage.									70	5	0	0	62	0	75			0099-2240	1098-5336		WOS:000359259000036	26116678

The powder was calcined at various temperatures to change its physical properties and then used for three types of photocatalytic reaction: mineralization of acetic acid ( AcOH) in an aerated aqueous suspension of bare TiO2 powder, evolution of molecular hydrogen from 2-propanol in an aqueous suspension of in situ platinized powder and formation of molecular oxygen (O-2) from silver sulfate in a deaerated aqueous suspension of bare TiO2 powder. Dependence of the photocatalytic activities on calcination temperature (T-c) and correlations with the physical properties of brookite- type TiO2 samples were examined. In the case of mineralization of AcOH, the uncalcined brookite TiO2 sample having the largest surface area showed the highest rate of carbon dioxide evolution (R-CO2), which was equal to that of representative commercial TiO2 (Degussa P-25), and R-CO2 decreased monotonously with T-c, i.e., with decrease in surface area. On the other hand, in the case of O-2 formation, the photocatalytic activity was enhanced by calcination at a higher temperature, despite the simultaneous decrease in surface area. Overall, the effects of calcination on the photocatalytic activities for the three reaction systems strongly suggested that photocatalytic activity of brookite- type TiO2 depends on two significant factors, adsorbability and recombination probability, corresponding to the specific surface area and crystallinity, respectively, and that the balance of these two factors determines T-c dependence.									78	2	0	0	6	1	78			1011-372X			WOS:000186905700007

These effects include: i) non-steady state kinetics, ii) spatially non-local polymer chain growth, iii) time varying photon absorption, iv) diffusion controlled effects, v) multiple termination mechanisms, vi) inhibition, and vii) post-exposure or dark-reaction effects. The resulting analytic expressions for the monomer and polymer concentrations are then derived and their validity tested against experimental data using a 4-harmonic, numerical fitting regime. The temporal variation in the refractive index modulation is accounted for using the Lorentz-Lorenz relation, and the effects of dark reactions for short holographic exposures are examined for a range of photopolymer materials.

Chemical Properties and Electronic Structure of Molybdenum Oxysulfide Films for Advanced Photoelectrocatalysts for Hydrogen Production								INORGANIC MATERIALS-APPLIED RESEARCH				13	5			1173	1181		10.1134/S2075113322050306				OCT 2022	2022	The effect of sulfur and oxygen concentrations on the formation of chemical bonds in films based on the ternary Mo-S-O compound has been studied. The compound is of interest with respect to the creation of efficient thin-film catalysts for electrochemical and, especially, photoactivated water splitting reaction. The films have been created by pulsed laser deposition in a mixture of gases (argon and oxygen) at room temperature of the substrate. The factors that greatly affect the position of the Fermi level in the band gap of the triple compound have been determined, which is mainly responsible for the choice of components in hybrid and heterostructures for photoelectrodes. The change in the chemical state of Mo-S-O films in the electrochemical process of hydrogen production in an acidic solution has been investigated. Indicators of changes in the local packing of atoms (self-organization) have been revealed: they consist in a decrease in the concentration of metal oxide clusters and an increase in the concentration of Mo-S clusters on the surface of the films. According to the thermodynamic analysis performed using the density functional theory, when oxygen is removed from the surface of Mo-S-O films, and, consequently, a hybrid MoSx/(Mo-S-O) structure is formed, the efficiency of hydrogen formation can be controlled by the quantum-chemical interaction of various clusters. Here, only certain combinations of clusters can provide sufficiently high catalytic activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2075-1133	2075-115X		WOS:000862441000005

Electrochemical decomposition of water for hydrogen production has attracted more and more attention as an appealing hydrogen production strategy. Previous studies have proved that controlling the morphology of Ru can improve hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. Therefore, the preparation of ordered spherical ruthenium nanocatalysts by hydrothermal method (Ru-HT) is described in this paper. The morphology, crystal structure and electronic state of Ru-HT were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). At the same time, the electrochemical properties and surface charge were studied and analyzed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) characterization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The experimental results have demonstrated that the HER activity of Ru-HT is obviously better than that of Ru by liquid phase reduction method (RuLR). When HER current density reaches 10 mA cm(-2), the overpotential of Ru-LR electrocatalyst is 88.8 my, while the overpotential of Ru-HT electrocatalyst is reduced to 55.7 mV in acidic medium. The Tafel slope of Ru-HT is only 36.5 mV dec(-1) and the exchange current density is 0.44 mA cm(-2), which indicates the rate determining step of the HER process should be the electrochemical desorption step (Heyrovsky step). By adjusting hydrothermal time and hydrothermal temperature, HER activity was further optimized. During the optimization process, the preparation conditions would change the hydrogen adsorption intensity on Ru surface to some extent. The adsorption strength of Ru-H, together with the electrochemical surface area, will affect the HER activity of Ru. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

With the combination of different experimental techniques, such as thermal desorption spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), high-resolution core-level spectroscopy (HRCLS), infrared spectroscopy, and first-principles studies employing density functional theory calculations, we are able to elucidate surface properties of single-crystalline IrO2(110). We provide spectroscopic fingerprints of the active surface sites of IrO2(110). The freshly prepared IrO2(110) surface is virtually inactive toward gas-phase molecules. The IrO2(110) surface needs to be activated by annealing to 500-600 K under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions. In the activation step, Ir cus sites are liberated from on-top oxygen (O-ot) and monoatomic Ir metal islands are formed on the surface, leading to the formation of a bifunctional model catalyst. Vacant Ir-cus sites of IrO2(110) allow for strong interaction and accommodation of molecules from the gas phase. For instance, CO can adsorb atop on Ir-cus and water forms a strongly bound water layer on the activated IrO2(110) surface. Single-crystalline IrO2(110) is thermally not very stable although chemically stable. Chemical reduction of IrO2(110) by extensive CO exposure at 473 K is not observed, which is in contrast to the prototypical RuO2(110) system.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000551543800040

We report here that stimulation of the Atlantic salmon monocytic cell line SHK-1 with native salmon PRL resulted in activation of the respiratory burst and induction of the expression of the genes encoding the phagocyte NADPH oxidase components p47phox, p67phox and gp91phox, and the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1). Interestingly, the pharmacologic inhibition of the Jak/Stat signaling pathway with AG490 blocked reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and the induction of genes encoding the NADPH oxidase components and IRF-1 in PRL-activated SHK-1 cells. In addition, PRL promoted the phosphorylation of Stat and induced the DNA binding activity of IRF-1. These results, together with the presence of several consensus target motifs for Stat and IRF-1 in the promoter of the tilapia p47phox gene, suggest that PRL regulates p47phox gene expression in fish through the activation of these two key transcription factors. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PRL induces the expression of the genes encoding the major phagocyte NADPH oxidase components and ROS production in fish macrophages via the JAK2/Stat/IRF-1 signaling pathway.									9	0	0	0	8	0	9			1753-4259	1753-4267		WOS:000329760100009	23548829

The success for a coupled electrolysis relies on not only the appropriate anodic and cathodic reaction pairs but also the suitable electrocatalysts that show high intrinsic activity, barrier-free ionic and electronic transport to the catalytic centers. Towards this goal, we showcased an efficient coupled electrolysis composed of the chloride oxidation reaction and the CO2 reduction reaction, in which the hexagonally ordered mesoporous electrocatalysts in terms of cobalt oxide and nickel, nitrogen co-doped carbons were used as anodic and cathodic electrocatalysts, respectively. Benefiting from the unique mesoporous structures, both the anodic and cathodic reactions exhibited prominent electrocatalytic performance in chloride salt electrolyte. Impressively, the coupled electrolysis showed a Faraday efficiency of 97% and 87% for CO and ClO-, respectively at cell voltage of ca. 2.5 V and current density of 20 mA cm(-2). By doing so, a reduction in cell voltage by 1.8 V and an increase in energy efficiency by 40% were obtained as compared to the conventional system composed of cathodic CO2 reduction and anodic O-2 evolution. This work not only highlights the importance of ordered mesoporous transport channels in accelerating the catalytic kinetics, but also showcases a high-performance coupled model for overall electrolysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000779707900003

It was found that GaN has activity for producing hydrogen from water containing electron donors (Na2S-Na2SO3, CH3OH) without a loading of a noble metal; the obtained H-2 yield was ca. 150 mu mol for a 200 h-Xe lamp (300 W) irradiation. The activity was increased by adding NaOH in the reaction solution due to the photo-etching of GaN by NaOH and concomitant removal of the native oxide from the surface, as confirmed by XPS, XRD, and PL measurements. The band energy scheme for GaN suggests that the conduction band edge of GaN is positioned at 0.5 V higher than the redox potential of H+/H-2. This large energy difference (overpotential) makes the photocatalytic H-2 evolution over GaN from water possible.									50	2	0	0	3	0	50			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000238777900039

This circumstance limits the scope of biochemical reactions in extant metabolism - yet it offers a phenomenal playground for synthetic biology. Xenobiology aims to bring novel bricks to life that could be exploited for (xeno)metabolite synthesis. In particular, the assembly of novel pathways engineered to handle nonbiological elements (neometabolism) will broaden chemical space beyond the reach of natural evolution. In this review, xeno-elements that could be blended into nature's biosynthetic portfolio are discussed together with their physicochemical properties and tools and strategies to incorporate them into biochemistry. We argue that current bioproduction methods can be revolutionized by bridging xenobiology and neometabolism for the synthesis of new-to-nature molecules, such as organohalides.									11	0	0	0	8	0	11			1439-4227	1439-7633		WOS:000531895400001	32274875

In this study, a facile and cost-efficient route is designed to construct nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur tri-doped mesoporous carbon (NPSpC) by direct pyrolysis of ZIF-8 after pretreatment with sodium phytate solution and dodecyl mercaptan. The resultant NPSpC exhibits a large specific surface area (1641 m(2)/g) and excellent catalytic activity toward ORR. The values for its onset potential (0.923 V vs RHE), half wave potential (0.821 V vs RHE) and limiting diffusion current density (4.89 mA/cm(2)) in 0.1 M KOH are close to those of commercial Pt/C (0.945 V, 0.839 V and 5.01 mA/cm(2), respectively). It also displays the superior methanol tolerance and long-time stability to Pt/C in alkaline medium. Additionally, NPSpC demonstrates the comparable ORR performance to and much better stability than the commercial Pt/C in acidic and neutral solutions. The desirable ORR performance is originated from the synergistic effects including the tri-doping of N, P and S heteroatoms, the large active surface area, the more exposed catalytic sites, well mesoporous nanostructure for sufficient accessibility of the reactants and rapid mass transfer.

Herein, IrCo hollow nanospheres featuring a novel structure with ultrathin continuous shells which have only eleven atomic layers (2.26 nm) were synthesized by a facile sequential reduction route using NaBH4 as a reducing agent at room temperature. It is revealed that the key intermediate in the formation of hollow nanospheres is amorphous cobalt boride formed between Co2+ and NaHB4 in the first reducing step. The average diameter of the IrCo nanospheres was found to be 73.71 nm with the atomic ratio of 47.1% and 52.9% for Co and Ir, respectively. The IrCo hollow nanospheres exhibit highly efficient OER activity and long-term durability with a low overpotential of 284 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) (32.5 mu g(Ir) cm(-2)) and a high mass activity of 8.49 A mg(-1) (5.7 times higher than that of commercial IrO2 (1.49 A mg(-1)) at 1.7 V. The performance is also proved using an overall water splitting device with the overpotential of 318 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) as well as a 17 mV shift at 5 mA cm(-2) after 14 h. This improvement is critically attributed to the advantages of the hollow structure, ultrathin continuous shells which are oxidized into IrO(x)in situ and strong lattice strain effects induced by the specific hollow structure and alloying Co into Ir crystal lattices (1.6% against metallic iridium). These characteristics endow the hollow nanospheres with great potential to minimize the Ir loading dramatically for practical applications, compared to other previously reported structures like nanoparticles, nanoneedles and nanowires.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000600106100018	33241831

The oxidation of water is the bottle-neck of this process that hampers its practical utility; hence, efficient, robust, and easy to make catalytic systems based on cheap and earth-abundant materials are of exceptional importance. Herein, an in situ generated cobalt catalyst, [Co-II(TCA)(2)(H2O)(2)] (TCA=1-mesityl-1,2,3-1H-triazole-4-carboxylate), that efficiently conducts photochemical water oxidation under near-neutral conditions is presented. The catalyst showed high stability under photolytic conditions for more than 3 h of photoirradiation. During electrochemical water oxidation, the catalytic system assembled a catalyst film, which proved not to be cobalt oxide/hydroxide as normally expected, but instead, and for the first time, generated a molecular cobalt complex that incorporated the organic ligand bound to cobalt ions. The catalyst film exhibited a low overpotential for electrocatalytic water oxidation (360 mV) and high oxygen evolution peak current densities of 9 and 2.7 mA cm(-2) on glassy carbon and indium-doped tin oxide electrodes, respectively, at only 1.49 and 1.39 V ( versus a normal hydrogen electrode), respectively, under neutral conditions. This finding, exemplified on the in situ generated cobalt complex, might be applicable to other molecular systems and suggests that the formation of a catalytic film in electrochemical water oxidation experiments is not always an indication of catalyst decomposition and the formation of nanoparticles.									35	2	0	0	0	0	35			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000398182300008	27921384

Here, using Co3N electrocatalyst as a prototype, we find that during water splitting in alkaline electrolyte a cobalt-containing hydroxide formed on the surface of Co3N, which greatly decreased the activation energy of water dissociation (Volmer step, a main rate-determining step for water splitting in alkaline electrolytes). Combining the cobalt ion poisoning test and theoretical calculations, the efficient hydrogen production on Co3N electrocatalysts would benefit from favorable water dissociation on in-situ formed cobalt-containing hydroxide and low hydrogen production barrier on the nitrogen sites of Co3N. As a result, the Co3N catalyst exhibits a low water-splitting activation energy (26.57 kJ mol(-1)) that approaches the value of platinum electrodes (11.69 kJ mol(-1)). Our findings offer new insight into understanding the catalytic mechanism of nitride electrocatalysts, thus contributing to the development of economical hydrogen production in alkaline electrolytes.									41	1	0	0	3	0	41			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000438179000038	29890067

Herein, heterostructured nickel foam-supported cobalt carbonate hydroxide nanoarrays embellished with NiCoSx nanoflakes (NiCoSx@CoCH NAs/NF) are designed via room-temperature sulfurization, which can drive 10 and 1000 mA cm(-2) at low overpotentials of 55 and 438 mV for HER and exhibit impressive long-term stability at the industrial-level current density. Surprisingly, NiCoSx@CoCH NAs/NF after a 500 h stability test at 500 mA cm(-2) exhibit better catalytic performance than the initial one at high current densities. Simulations showed that NiCoSx@CoCH NAs have an optimized hydrogen adsorption free energy (Delta G(H*)) of 0.02 eV, owing to the synergistic effect of CoCH (Delta G(H*) = 1.36 eV) and NiCoSx (Delta G(H*) = 0.03 eV). The electric field at the heterostructure interface leads to electron transport from CoCH to NiCoSx, which enhances HER dynamics. The hierarchical nanostructure has a large specific area and a superaerophobic surface, which are beneficial to hydrogen generation/release for efficient and stable HER.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000683741400036	34283575

This work shows that the method used to model core@shell structures is of fundamental importance in order to truly represent the physicochemical changes arising from the formation of a core-shell structure. We demonstrate that using a slab approach for modelling nanoparticles the oxygen adsorption energies are qualitatively well represented. Although this is a good descriptor for the catalytic activity, huge differences are found for the calculated surface stability between the results of a nano-cluster and those of a slab approach. Moreover, for the slab method depending on the geometric properties of the core and their similarity to the elements of the core or shell, contradictory effects are obtained. In order to determine the changes occurring as the number of layers and nano particle size are increased, clusters of Ni@Pt from 13 to 260 atoms were constructed and analyzed in terms of geometric parameters, oxygen adsorption, and dissolution potential shift. It is shown that the results of modelling the Ni@Pt nanoparticles with a cluster approach are in good agreement with experimental geometrical parameters, catalytic activity, and stability of a carefully prepared series of Ni@Pt nanostructures where the shell thickness is systematically changed. The maximum catalytic activity and stability are found for a monolayer of Pt whereas adding a second and third layer the behavior is almost the same than that in pure Pt nanoparticles.									24	2	0	0	0	0	24			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000363686800041	25942590

The pyrite sulphur, carbonate carbon and oxygen and kaolinite oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions have been determined. These data (pyrite, delta(34)S = -24.8 to +21.0 parts per thousand; "siderite", delta(13)C(PDB) = -14.7 to +5.0 parts per thousand, delta(18)O(PDB) = -19.1 to -0.6 parts per thousand; Fe-calcite, delta(13)C(PDB) = +17.5 to +17.9 parts per thousand, delta(18)O(PDB) = -8.3 to -8.0 parts per thousand; kaolinite, delta(18)O(SMOW) = +14.7 to +17.5 parts per thousand, delta D (SMOW) = -86 to -43 parts per thousand) have been used to interpret the isotopic compositions of the precipitating pore fluids and/or the temperatures of mineral formation. The interpretation of these results indicate that in the deltaic depositional setting the syndepositional pore waters had a significant but variable marine influence that favoured the early formation of pyrite. Subsequently the subsurface influence of meteoric waters, showing varying degrees of modification involving organic and/or water-rock reactions, played an increasingly significant role in the development of later diagenetic cements in the sediments when abundant authigenic carbonates and kaolinites were formed.

As a potential alternative to such catalysts, this investigation addresses the facile synthesis of an efficient, durable and highly poison-tolerant metal-free N-doped carbon-Nd2O3 hybrid bifunctional electro-catalyst for ORR and water splitting compared to commercial Pt/C catalyst. Chitosan obtained from crustacean's shells assists to yield a nitrogen-doped graphitic structure with superior activity and durability for ORR. Nd2O3/N C shows a high tolerance towards crossover of various anodic fuels concurrent with high poisoning tolerance against various hydrocarbon impurities in-situ generated during fuel cell operation. H-2-air single cell tests using Nd2O3/N C as cathode catalyst delivered outstanding power density (similar to 287 mW cm(2)) and current density (similar to 572 mA cm(-2)) at 0.6 V. The superior electro-catalytic activity and durability of the as prepared catalysts mainly originates from the synergistic effects between Nd2O3nano particles and the nitrogen-doped graphitic structure. The facile synthesis method and the high performance together with low-cost of our suggested Pt-free catalyst make it as a promising alternative for the commercial Pt/C. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Vangioni-Flam, E; Casse, M; Cayrel, R; Audouze, J; Spite, M; Spite, F								Lithium-6: evolution from Big Bang to present								NEW ASTRONOMY				4	4			245	254		10.1016/S1384-1076(99)00015-9				AUG 5 1999	1999	The primordial abundances of deuterium, He-4, and Li-7 are crucial to the determination of the baryon density of the Universe in the framework of standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). Li-6 is only produced in tiny quantities and it is generally not considered to be a cosmological probe. However, recent major observational advances have produced an estimate of the Li-6/Li-7 ratio in a few very old stars in the galactic halo which impacts the question whether or not the lithium isotopes are depleted in the outer layers of halo stars, through proton induced reactions at the base of (or below) the convective zone. Here, we use (i) an empirical relation, independent of any evolutionary model, to set an upper limit on the Li-6 rise compatible with the very existence of the Spite's plateau (i.e. the flat lithium abundance measured in very old stars of the halo of our Galaxy of different iron content) and (ii) a well founded evolutionary model of light elements based on spallation production (Vangioni-Flam et al., 1997; Vangioni-Flam et al., 1998). Indeed, Li-6 is a pure product of spallation through the major production reactions, fast oxygen and alphas interacting on interstellar H, He (especially in the early Galaxy). The rapid nuclei are both synthesized and accelerated by SN II. In this context, the Li-6 evolution should go in step with that of beryllium and boron, recently observed by the Keck and HST telescopes. Li-6 adds a new constraint on the early spallation in the Galaxy. In particular, if confirmed, the Li-6/Be-9 ratio observed in two halo stars (HD 84937, BD + 26 degrees 3578 = HD 338529) gives strong boundary conditions on the composition and the spectrum of the rapid particles involved. Both methods converge to show that Li-6 is essentially intact in halo stars, and a fortiori Li-7, which is more tightly bound. Moreover, extrapolating empirical and theoretical evolutionary curves to the very low metallicities, we can define a range of the Li-6 abundance in the very early Galaxy consistent with Big Bang nucleosynthesis (5.6 x 10(-14) to 3 x 10(-13)). Following the evolution at increasing metallicity, we explain the abundance in the solar system within a factor of about 2. The whole evolution from Big Bang to present is reasonably reproduced, which demonstrates the general consistency of the present analysis of Li-6. The baryonic density derived from both lithium isotopes is between 1.5 to 3.5% of the critical one, in good agreement with the determination based on independent analyses. Consequently, thanks to these new data and theoretical developments, we show that Li-6 can be used to establish stellar Li-7 abundances as a valid tracer due to the fact that it allows to reinforce the Spite's plateau as a primordial test of BBN; on the other hand, its early evolution can be used to corroborate the calculated BBN abundances. In the framework of this work, a pregalactic alpha + alpha process producing Li-6 is not necessary. Finally, thanks to Li-6, the physics of spallative production of light elements should be more easily mastered when more data will become available. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Here we report the development and characterization of a cost-effective catalyst, which consists of metallic Ir nanoparticles supported on commercial Ti4O7. The catalyst is synthesized by reducing IrCl3 with NaBH4 in a suspension containing Ti4O7, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and anhydrous ethanol. No thermal treatment was applied afterwards in order to preserve the high conductivity of Ti4O7 and the metallic properties of Ir. Electron microscopy images show an uniform distribution of mostly single Ir particles covering the electro-ceramic support, although some agglomerates are still present. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis reveals a cubic face centered structure of Ir nanoparticles with a crystallite size of ca. 1.8 nm. According to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the ratio of metallic Ir and Ir-oxide, identified as Ir3+, is 3 : 1 after the removal of surface contamination. Other surface properties such as primary particle size distribution and surface potential were determined by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Cyclic and linear voltammetric measurements were conducted to study the electrochemical surface and kinetics of Ir-black and Ir/Ti4O7. The developed catalyst outperforms the commercial Ir-black in terms of mass activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid medium by a factor of four, measured at 0.25 V overpotential and room temperature. In general, the Ir/Ti4O7 catalyst exhibits improved kinetics and higher turnover frequency (TOF) compared to Ir-black. The developed Ir/Ti4O7 catalyst allows reducing the precious metal loading in the anode of a PEM electrolyzer by taking advantage of the use of an electro-ceramic support.									34	0	0	0	2	0	34			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000369509100027	26791108

Herein, we demonstrate a facile Anderson-type polyoxometalate-assisted synthesis route to prepare defect-rich doped 1T/2H-MoSe2 nanosheets. As demonstrated, the optimized defect-rich doped 1T/2H-MoSe2 nanosheets display low overpotentials of 116 and 274 mV to gain 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic and simulated seawater for the HER, respectively. A magnesium (Mg)/seawater battery was fabricated with the defect-rich doped 1T/2H-MoSe2 nanosheet cathode, displaying the highest power density of up to 7.69 mW cm(-2) and stable galvanostatic discharging over 24 h. The theoretical and experimental investigations show that the superior HER and battery performances of the heteroatom-doped MoSe2 nanosheets are attributed to both the improved intrinsic catalytic activity (effective activation of water and favorable subsequent hydrogen desorption) and the abundant active sites, benefiting from the favorable catalytic factors of the doped heteroatom, 1T phase, and defects. Our work presents an intriguing structural modulation strategy to design high-performance catalysts toward both HER and Mg/seawater batteries.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000778608900024	35184551

As one of the promising candidates, transition metal phosphides unfortunately suffer from inevitable surface oxidation which obstructs active-site exposure. Herein, a facile reduction followed by a surface phosphorization is introduced to convert surface-oxidized cobalt phosphides to a Co-2(P2O7)-CoP heterostructure embedded in N-doped carbon (Co-2(P2O7)-CoP/NC), accomplishing an efficient HER in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. It affords low overpotentials (eta(10)) of 88 and 97 mV to reach a current density of -10 mA cm(-2), and small Tafel slopes of 51 and 61 mV dec(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH, respectively, outperforming the parent surface-oxidized Co2P and most previouslyreported Pt-free electrocatalysts. The remarkably improved electrocatalysis should be ascribed to the strong surface acidity of the Co-2(P2O7) component and thereby the promoted HER kinetics on Co-2(P2O7)-CoP interfaces. This work will encourage the development of cost-efficient electrocatalysts via surface engineering.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000475397000001	31195381

However, the employment of costly Pt-based electrocatalyst in the cathode of electrolyzer greatly hampers the development of hydrogen economy. Ruthenium phosphide catalysts have recently drawn wide attention due to the Pt-like activity but relatively lower cost. Herein, a facile strategy was proposed for the controlled preparation of the ultrasmall RuP2 nanoparticles on N,P-codoped carbon from common precursors of Ru (II) complex and phytic acid. By taking advantage of simple mixing and pyrolysis, the as-synthesized RuP2 nanoparticles were uniformly embedded onto the N,P-codoped carbon nanosheet. The composite catalyst shows better activity than Pt/C for alkaline HER and comparable activity for acidic and neutral HER. The superior activity can be ascribed to the ultrasmall-size and efficient RuP2 together with good mass and charge transfer ability assured by N,P-codoped carbon support. The advantages including low-cost and simple synthesis in this work present an encouraging substitute to replace commercial Pt/C for hydrogen-related practical applications.

Here, the design and in situ growth of Ag nanodots decorated Cu2O porous nanobelts networks on Cu foam (denoted as Ag@Cu2O/CF) are carried out via a simple one-pot solution strategy at room temperature. Serving as self-supporting electrocatalysts, Ag@Cu2O porous nanobelts provide plentiful active sites, and the 3D hybrid foams provide fast transportation for electrolyte and short diffusion path for newly formed H-2 bubbles, which result in excellent electrocatalytic HER activity and long-term stability. Owing to the synergistic effect between Ag nanodots and Cu2O porous nanobelts and CF, the hybrid electrocatalyst exhibits a low Tafel slope of 58 mV dec(-1), a small overpotential of 108 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and high durability for more than 20 h at a potential of 200 mV for HER in 1.0 mol L-1 KOH solution.									62	0	0	0	4	0	62			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000477762400002	30650234

It is discovered that the self-templated conversion of NiMoO4 into MoNi4 nanocrystals and MoO3-x as dual active components dramatically boosts the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance. Benefiting from high intrinsic activity, high electrochemical surface area, 3D open network, and improved electron transport, the resulting MoNi4/MoO3-x electrode exhibits a remarkable HER activity with extremely low overpotentials of 17 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 114 mV at 500 mA cm(-2), as well as a superior durability in alkaline medium. The water-alkali electrolyzer using MoNi4/MoO3-x as cathode achieves stable overall water splitting with a small cell voltage of 1.6 V at 30 mA cm(-2).

Developing efficient, cost-effective and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts toward carbon dioxide reduction and carbon dioxide evolution reactions (CO2RR and CO2ER) is highly essential for the application of Li-CO2 battery. Herein, we explore the catalytic ability of Cu-LSCM (Cu-La0.96Sr0.04Cu0.3Mn0.7O3-delta) heterostructure in Li-CO2 battery. The LSCM perovskite substrate can provide abundant oxygen vacancies facilitating the movement of CO2 and ions. The in-situ exsolved Cu NPs ensure a strong intercalation with the perovskite and then deliver superiority catalytic activity, durability, and considerable conductivity. Accordingly, the catalyst exhibits excellent CO2RR and CO2ER activity (peak current densities: 0.4 mA cm(cathodic)(-2), 0.22 mA cm(anodic)(-2)) in nonaqueous media. Benefiting from the mesoporous nanofiber architecture accelerating the deposition and decomposition of Li2CO3 , the Li-CO2 battery with Cu-LSCM heterostructure delivers an ultrahigh discharge capacity of 11350 mAh g(-1), low voltage gap of 1.35 V, and prolonged cycle lifespan of 107 cycles (restricted capacity of 1000 mAh g(-1), 400 mA g(-1)) without obvious degradation. This work demonstrates the synergistic effect between the metal nanoparticles and perovskite oxide in the hybrid heterostructures, and exemplifies the bifunctional catalysts for Li-CO2 battery.

To date, the synthesis of catalysts that are both ultrathin (monolayer) and ultrafine (lateral size <10 nm) has proven extremely challenging. Herein, using a facile ultrasonic exfoliation procedure, we describe the successful synthesis of ultrafine ZnCo-LDH nanosheets (denoted as ZnCo-UF) with a size similar to 3.5 nm and thickness similar to 0.5 nm. The single layer ZnCo-UF nanosheets possess an abundance of oxygen vacancies (V-O) and unsaturated coordination sites, thereby affording outstanding electrocatalytic water oxidation performance. DFT calculations confirmed that V-O on the surface of ZnCo-UF enhanced H2O adsorption via increasing the electropositivity of the nanosheets.

High-resolution optical spectroscopic observations of comet C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy) were performed on 2015 January 11 (at 1.321 au pre-perihelion) with the High Dispersion Spectrograph mounted on the Subaru Telescope on Maunakea, Hawaii. We derive the N-14/N-15 ratio of NH2 (126 +/- 25), as well as the ortho-to-para abundance ratios (OPRs) of the H2O+ ion (2.77 +/- 0.24) and NH2 (3.38 +/- 0.07), which correspond to nuclear spin temperatures of > 24 K (3 sigma lower limit) and 27 +/- 2 K, respectively. We also derive the intensity ratio of the green-to- red doublet of forbidden oxygen lines (0.107 +/- 0.007). The ammonia in the comet must have formed under low-temperature conditions at similar to 10 K or less to reproduce the observed N-14/N-15 ratio in this molecule if it is assumed that the N-15-fractionation of ammonia occurred via ion-molecule chemical reactions. However, this temperature is inconsistent with the nuclear spin temperatures of water and ammonia estimated from the OPRs. The interpretation of the nuclear spin temperature as the temperature at molecular formation may therefore be incorrect. An isotope-selective photodissociation of molecular nitrogen by protosolar ultraviolet radiation might play an important role in the N-15-fractionation observed in cometary volatiles.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0004-6256	1538-3881		WOS:000387764500002

This not only leads to shielding effects and a decrease of the nanoparticle (NP) productivity but also can directly affect the NP properties such as the oxidation degree. In this study, we demonstrate that liquid decomposition during laser ablation in water is triggered by the redox activity of the 7 different bulk materials used; Au, Pt, Ag, Cu, Fe, Ti and Al, as well as by the reactivity of water with the plasma. Laser ablation of less-noble metals like aluminum leads to a massive gas evolution up to 390 cm(3) per hour with molar hydrogen to oxygen ratios of 17.1. For more noble metals such as gold and platinum, water splitting induced by LAL is the dominant feature leading to gas volume formation rates of 10 up to 30 cm(3) per hour and molar hydrogen to oxygen ratios of 1.2. We quantify the material-dependent ablation rate, shielding effects as well as the amount of hydrogen peroxide produced, directly affecting the yield and oxidation of the nanoparticles on the long-time scale.									31	0	1	0	0	0	31			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000483701200018	31414685

In this study, we have investigated the effect of two nanometric manufactured polymers, high-generation cationic G5 and G7 poly.amidoamine) dendrimers, in a prokaryotic primary producer of aquatic ecosystems, the filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC7120. Dendrimers significantly decreased the growth of the cyanobacterium and they induced morphological alterations both at the filament and the single-cell level. Furthermore, the exposure to dendrimers induced significant alterations in several physiological parameters of the cyanobacterium: intracellular reactive oxygen species overproduction, damage in membrane integrity, membrane potential alterations, increase of metabolic activity, acidification of intracellular pH, oxidative DNA damage and alteration of intracellular free Ca2+ homeostasis. Dendrimers also induced alterations in the photosynthesis of Anabaena: decrease in oxygen evolution and in PSII activity, alteration in different photochemical events and in chlorophyll a content. Moreover, both dendrimers were internalized into cyanobacterial cells. In conclusion, high-generation cationic dendrimers exhibited high toxicity towards Anabaena, severely affecting several physiological, morphological and photosynthetic parameters.									12	1	0	0	9	0	12			2051-8153	2051-8161		WOS:000461449900008

In order to predict the shelf life, food industry is very interested in easy, quick and reliable solutions able to estimate the oxygen sensitivity of a product. The degree of lipid oxidation can be measured by physical or chemical methods (i.e. peroxide value -PV) as well as stability tests, which measure the stability of a fatty food under conditions that attempt to accelerate the normal oxidation process. In the field of accelerated shelf-life testing, Oxitest permits food stability to be investigated: it is based on the absolute pressure change in a closed and thermostatted chamber, assumed as the oxygen uptake by reactive substances.The aim of the present study was firstly the assessment of the Oxitest ability to discriminate the growing oxidation degree of soybean oil at different temperatures and secondly to verify the existence of correlation between a common method such as PV and a more innovative accelerated technique like Oxitest.Soybean oil samples were stored at growing temperatures: the evolution of the oxidation was monitored during time by analyzing the samples by both Oxitest and PV. The increase of PV and decrease of the Induction Period (IP) values followed a zero order kinetic at all the different temperatures tested. On consequence the reaction rate constant (k) for each temperature, the Arrhenius parameters and the Q10 index were estimated. The degree of correlation between the two techniques was also evaluated pointing to the Oxitest method as a reliable alternative to classic methods.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			1120-1770			WOS:000208717100018

AFA alloys with composition formula Fe-3Al-16Cr-(19-21)Ni (wt.%) and HEA with formula Al(7.9-8.9)Cr(21.4-23.2)Ni(34.3-35)Febal (at.%) show low oxidation rate due to the formation of alpha-Al2O3 scale. By adding yttrium to AFA or niobium to HEA, the samples show no evidence of scale exfoliation. HEA with titanium addition forms a thick oxide layer based on TiO2, Cr2O3 and internal Al oxidation. The growth of oxide scale is discussed based on the oxygen partial pressure of metal oxides and dissociation oxygen pressure of the steam.

The evolution of AlOx on the CH3-SAMs was studied by comparing with that on hydrophilic OH-terminated silicon dioxide (OH-SiO2). The AlOx grown on the CH3-SAM surfaces underwent growth instability and developed significantly rough surface morphologies while the AlOx on the OH-SiO2 maintained atomically smooth surface morphologies. The structural integrity of the CH3-SAMs was also found to be disturbed substantially at the onset of the ALD process with H2O. In order to improve the surface morphology of AlOx on CH3-SAM surfaces, a two-stage ALD process was developed. In the two-stage ALD process for AlOx, the first stage utilized n-propanol as the oxygen source and the second stage proceeded with H2O. The optimized two-stage ALD process significantly improved the surface morphology of AlOx films and effectively protected the structural integrity of underlying CH3-SAMs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1816-093X			INSPEC:10341947

Tungsten trioxide (WO3) has been used as a source for 'W' while 'Mo' has been derived from Mo based substrate. Different experimental parameters were used in this experiment. Higher gas flow rate decreases the size of the sample flake and on other side increases the dopant concentrations. The interaction mechanism between Mo, S, W and oxygen (O) have been explored. The influence of oxygen seems to be not avoidable completely which also imposes effective growth condition for the reaction of Mo with incoming sulfur atoms. The difference in the migration energies of Mo, WO3, S clusters on the graphene and the higher reactivity of Mo clusters over other possibly formed atomic clusters on the graphene leads to the growth of W doped MoS2 monolayers. Formation of MoS2 monolayer and the nature of edge doping of 'W' is explained well with the crystal model using underlying nucleation principles. We believe our result provide a special route to prepare W doped MoS2 on graphene substrate in the future.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2045-2322			WOS:000431737300082	29743558

In this study, Co-MOF nanorods (NRs) were prepared at room temperature followed by a calcination and hydrothermal sulfurization strategy to transform the MOF into CoS NRs on carbon cloth (CoS/CC). Intriguingly, the resultant 3D sulfide NRs can serve as scaffolds to electrodeposit layered double hydroxides (LDHs) on the surfaces. Through combining the advantages of structure and composition, the as-fabricated CoS@CoNi-LDH/CC exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). An overpotential of 124 mV is needed to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of only 89 mV dec(-1), which is superior to that of pure CoS/CC (141 mV along with 103 mV dec(-1)) and other reported cobalt-based catalysts. Notably, after the chronopotentiometry test for 50 h, the overpotential of CoS@CoNi-LDH/CC increased by 17 mV only.									47	1	0	0	2	0	46			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000557854700014	32628440

Such nanoparticles can be deposited or synthesized in situ via nonstoichiometric methods. To date, nanoparticles have been exsolved from perovskite oxide surfaces using nonstoichiometric processes. However, the density of the space-separated nanoparticles on the oxide surfaces is still low. And less attention is paid toward the changes that happen to the host during the nanoparticle exsolution process. In this work, we demonstrated in situ exsolution of ultrafine nanoparticles (similar to 5 nm) of either Co3O4 or Ca(OH)(2) via judicious control of nonstoichiometry in a misfit Ca3Co4O9 (CCO). The nanoparticle density over the CCO surface reached as high as 8500/mu m(2), which is significantly higher than previously reported values. High-resolution electron microscopy studies reveal the formation mechanism of Co3O4 nanopartides over CCO, and the formation takes palace via the formation of wavy surfaces on the CCO. Defects caused by the nonstoichiometric synthesis created microstrain within the host CCO, resulting in making the new density of states near the Fermi energy. Further, the exsolution process turned the inert host (CCO) into electrocatalytically active toward water splitting. The nonstoichiometric samples obtained by shorter annealing times showed high electrocatalytic behavior for the hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions. The catalytic activity is further enhanced (reaching overpotential of 320 mV and 410 mV for HER and OER respectively, for a current density of 10 mA/cm(2)) by removing the surface nanoparticles. The observation indicates that the active sites that are produced during the nonstoichiometric synthesis also present in the bulk of the CCO (host). We believe that similar nonstoichiometric synthesis can be applied to a wide variety of tricomponent systems, and they could endow the hosts with novel properties for applications such as catalysis and thermoelectrics.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000626502700045	33591175

In this study, a p-n heterojunction consisting of Cu2O and In2O3 was synthesized using the hydrothermal in situ deposition method. The Cu2O/In2O3 hybrid exhibited enhanced performance in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction and degradation of organic pollutants compared with pure Cu2O and In2O3. The sensitization of In2O3 by Cu2O considerably enhanced the light response of the Cu2O/In2O3 hybrid, and the close contact between In2O3 and Cu2O led to the generation of the p-n heterojunction. The photoelectrochemical properties test proved that the successful fabrication of the p-n heterojunction in the Cu2O/In2O3 hybrid promoted the transfer of photoinduced electrons and holes and inhibited the recombination of photogenerated carriers efficiently. The present strategy provides an efficient approach to improve the performance of photocatalysts through the fabrication of p-n heterojunctions.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1533-4880	1533-4899		WOS:000473105800023	31196276

But it is highly challenging to realize due to the harsh requirement for band edge levels and interfacial contact. Herein, we report the preparation of a high-efficiency and stable Z-scheme catalyst Cd0.5Zn0.5S-BiVO4 with a core-satellite structure through the charge-induced assembly process in a mild water bath. A Cd0.5Zn0.5S-BiVO4 Z-scheme junction shows an enormously enhanced photocatalytic activity for H-2 evolution under visible light illumination. The optimal photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate reaches 2.35 mmol g(-1) h(-1), which is 7.13 times higher than that of Cd0.5Zn0.5S, and an appreciable apparent quantum efficiency of 24.1% at = 420 nm was achieved. In particular, without any sacrificial donor, the Cd0.5Zn0.5S-BiVO4 Z-scheme junction can overall split water into H-2 and O-2. The efficient photocatalytic activity of Cd0.5Zn0.5S-BiVO4 is attributed to the formation of an intimate core-satellite structure and a Z-scheme photocatalytic mechanism, which not only greatly benefit the charge separation, but also prompt the photoinduced holes from Cd0.5Zn0.5S to rapidly recombine with the electrons of BiVO4, hence reserving the most favorable reductive and oxidative reaction sites. Meanwhile, it inhibits the photocorrosion of Cd0.5Zn0.5S, guaranteeing the high photochemical stability (no activity decay after half a year). This work provides a new reference for the fabrication of a high-performance Z-schematic photocatalyst for water splitting.									114	8	0	0	12	0	114			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000445218000021

(2) The activity of PSI, as measured by the photoreduction of methylviologen with reduced DCIP, was not much affected even after treatment at 500 MPa, whereas this electron transport became uncoupled from phosphorylation at 200 MPa and above. (3) In pressure-treated PSII membranes, the EPR signal of Y-Z(+) became photoinducible with the concomitant appearance of an EPR signal for Mn2+. (4) The 33-kDa extrinsic protein was retained in inhibited PSII membranes, but the 17- and 23-kDa extrinsic proteins were lost.

Features of the pressure-induced inhibition of various reactions in photosynthetic membranes are discussed on the basis of these results.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0032-0781			WOS:A1995RW97700019

The most pressing of these is the development of viable, 'green' ways to store this energy as carbon carbon bonds. Natural photosynthesis provides a ready blue print for the conversion of solar energy into carbohydrate, i.e., a fuel composed of carbon carbon bonds. Natural photosynthesis is too complicated and its components too fragile ever to be copied in an artificial context. Natural photosynthesis, however, does provide many templates that can be mimicked in any future bio-inspired version of artificial photosynthesis, such as the oxygen evolving complex and the enzyme RuBisCO. Many options will need to be explored to find the best ways to achieve artificial photosynthesis and to achieve it will require a large-scale, coordinated international effort. There is simply no time left to continue in the way we are now. Climate change needs to be stopped as soon as possible and the clock is ticking for us to make clean, renewable solar fuels.

This Account provides an overview of the use of theory to describe the mechanisms of oxidation of diamond and graphite using hyperthermal (few electronvolts) oxygen atoms. The theoretical studies involve the use of Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics calculations in which on-the-fly electronic structure calculations have been performed using either density functional theory or density-functional-tight-binding semiempirical methods to simulate collisions of atomic oxygen with diamond or graphite. Comparisons with molecular-beam scattering on surfaces provide indirect verification of the results.Graphite surfaces become oxidized when exposed to hyperthermal atomic oxygen, and the calculations have revealed the mechanisms for formation of both CO and CO2. These species arise when epoxide groups form and diffuse to holes on the surface where carbonyls are already present. CO and CO2 form when these carbonyl groups dissociate from the surface, resulting in larger holes. We also discuss mechanisms for forming holes in graphite surfaces that were previously hole-free. For diamond, the (111) and (100) surfaces are oxidized by the oxygen atoms, forming mostly oxy radicals and ketones on the respective surfaces. The oxy-covered (111) surface can then react with hyperthermal oxygen to give gaseous CO2, or it can become graphitized leading to carbon removal as with graphite. The (100) surface is largely unreactive to hyperthermal atomic oxygen, undergoing large amounts of inelastic scattering and supporting reactions that create O-2 or peroxy radicals. We did not observe a mechanism for the removal of carbon for this surface. These results are consistent with experimental studies that show formation of CO and CO2 in graphite oxidation and preferential etching on (111) CVD diamond surfaces in comparison with (100) surfaces.									15	2	0	0	3	0	17			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000311858300015	22694904

In this work, we focus on anatase TiO2 with controllable exposed facets toward photocatalytic hydrogen evolution by water splitting. By combining temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS), we obtain that the adsorption of hydroxyl groups and the photo-driven breaking of hydroxyl groups depend strongly on the exposed facets. As a result, the higher catalytic hydrogen evolution activity of TiO2 enclosed with (101) facets than that of (001) facets should be ascribed to the more favorable depletion of hydroxyl groups. Moreover, graphene quantum dots (GQDs) with rich surface functional groups are deliberately deposited on the TiO2 surface. The determination of the states and dynamics of surface hydroxyl groups suggests that GQDs facilitate the reaction of hydroxyl groups on (001)TiO2 , thus leading to the activity enhancement. By contrast, the already active (101)TiO2 become apparently less efficient after GQD deposition due to the restricted reaction of hydroxyl groups. Overall, our findings not only provide a unique guidance for understanding the crystal-plane-dependent photocatalysis but also present a powerful approach by which to tailor the photocatalytic performance.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000797959300061	35380775

In this work, the temporal evolution of non-equilibrium air plasmas self-induced by energetic X-rays is experimentally and theoretically investigated at atmospheric pressure. Time resolved electron density measurements are based on transmission measurements of an electromagnetic wave in the microwave range. The electromagnetic wave is launched into a wave guide, which is irradiated by a high flux of multi-MeV pulsed X-rays. For different X-ray fluxes, the electron density is determined from the comparison between the transmitted microwave signal at the waveguide output, and the result of the calculation of the propagation of an electromagnetic wave through time varying plasma contained in a waveguide. These measurements require a priori assumptions on electron temperature, which is obtained and confirmed by a reaction kinetics model of the evolution of the electron energy and the densities of the different humid air plasma species inside the waveguide. The considered chemical kinetics scheme involves 39 influent species (electrons, positive ions, negative ions, and neutral atoms and molecules in their ground or metastable excited states) reacting following 265 selected reactions. A good agreement is observed between the calculated and measured time evolution of the transmitted signal for specific profiles of electron energy and density. In our experiments, the maximum electron density is of the order of few 10 12 cm(-3), for a mean electron energy of about 0.5 eV. For doses range from 3Gy to 21Gy, the discrepancies between the measurements and the model for the maximum of the electron density are within a factor of 2.

Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was employed to study loop C of CP47 (approximately Trp-162 to Gly-197) which faces the thylakoid lumen. Five short amino acid deletion strains, Delta (S169-P171), Delta (Y172-G176), Delta (G176-P180), Delta (E184-A188) and Delta (F190-N194), were created that span this domain. The deletion between Gly-176 and Pro-180, located around the middle of loop C, produced an obligate photoheterotroph that could not assemble functional PSII centers. The deletions in mutants Delta (S169-P171) and Delta (Y172-G176) reduced PSII levels to less than or equal to 20% of the control and thus impaired photoautotrophic growth. In contrast, mutants Delta (E184-A188) and Delta (F190-N194) were photoautotrophic even though the number of photosystems was decreased by 50%. All PSII complexes assembled in the deletion strains had an increased susceptibility to photoinactivation and deletion of Glu-184 to Ala-188 prevented photoautotrophic growth under chloride-limiting conditions. Furthermore, the removal of the extrinsic PSII-O, PSII-U and PSII-V proteins from mutants Delta (E184-A188) and Delta (F190-N194) reduced the rates of oxygen evolution and, in the strains lacking either the PSII-O or PSII-V proteins, also increased the photoautotrophic doubling times. These effects were greater in mutant Delta (E184-A188) than in mutant Delta (F190-N194) and the order of importance for the removal of the extrinsic proteins was found to be Delta PSII-V greater than or equal to Delta PSII-O > Delta PSII-U.									16	1	0	0	12	2	18			0167-4412			WOS:000165791400003	11198421

In a weak-alkaline medium (pH 8.0, 9.2, 10.0) in the presence of a one-electron oxidant (Ru(bpy)(3)(3+)), the catalyst provided the yield of oxygen as high as 56, 73 78% of the stoichiometric quantity, respectively. Catalysts based on ZSM-5 zeolite exhibited higher catalytic activity as compared to the catalysts based on the MOR, BEA, Y. Inspection of the electron states of cobalt in the Co-containing zeolite-based catalysts using TPR-H-2 and UV-Vis DR techniques revealed that -Co(OH)(2)-like polynuclear clusters and hydrocomplexes stabilized in the zeolite channels were most active to catalytic oxidation of water, while their transformation to Co3O4-like clusters/nanoparticles and Co2+ oxocomplexes, respectively, during thermal treatment led to some decrease in the catalyst efficiency. Coarsening of Co3O4-like clusters/nanoparticles caused the further decrease in the system efficiency. The minimal activity was observed with the catalysts containing predominantly isolated Co-Oh(2+) ions. The result obtained indicates a kind of at least polynuclear structure of the catalytically active center ConOx, where n>2.					4th International Symposium on the Catalysis for Clean Energy and Sustainable Chemistry (CCESC)4th International Symposium on the Catalysis for Clean Energy and Sustainable Chemistry (CCESC)	20182018		Bilbao, SPAINBilbao, SPAIN	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1022-5528	1572-9028		WOS:000473213000003

The characterization of these CNVs is important for understanding the molecular mechanisms and unraveling the complex genetic architecture of underlying diseases. In this study, we reported a genome-wide CNVs map in Chinese sheep breeds using a custom-designed Roche NimbleGen array comparative genome hybridization (aCGH) platform. We identified a total of 245 CNVs, which were located within 51 CNV Regions (CNVRs) in five different sheep breeds. Of these, 21(41.18%) involved DNA losses, 23(45.10%) involved DNA gains and 7 (13.73%) involved both. These CNVRs covered approximately 15.55 Mb of the sheep genome, and this coverage corresponded to 0.60% of the autosomal genome sequence. Moreover, we identified 1726 genes within or overlapping with these 51 CNVRs by functional enrichment analysis, which indicates that they are involved in antigen processing, the immune response, oxygen transport, and heme binding. The results elucidate the genetic variability in the sheep genome and offer genetic foundations for the construction of economically important phenotypes of sheep, such as sheep with high immunity and oxygen binding capability.

Unlike model organisms, the growth of Chlorella ohadii, isolated from desert soil crust, remains unchanged and photosynthetic O-2 evolution increases, even when exposed to irradiation twice that of maximal sunlight.Spectroscopic, biochemical and molecular approaches were applied to uncover the mechanisms involved.D1 protein in photosystem II (PSII) is barely degraded, even when exposed to antibiotics that prevent its replenishment. Measurements of various PSII parameters indicate that this complex functions differently from that in model organisms and suggest that C. ohadii activates a nonradiative electron recombination route which minimizes singlet oxygen formation and the resulting photoinhibition. The light-harvesting antenna is very small and carotene composition is hardly affected by excess illumination. Instead of succumbing to photodamage, C. ohadii activates additional means to dissipate excess light energy. It undergoes major structural, compositional and physiological changes, leading to a large rise in photosynthetic rate, lipids and carbohydrate content and inorganic carbon cycling.The ability of C. ohadii to avoid photodamage relies on a modified function of PSII and the dissipation of excess reductants downstream of the photosynthetic reaction centers. The biotechnological potential as a gene source for crop plant improvement is self-evident.									49	0	0	0	45	0	49			0028-646X	1469-8137		WOS:000379211400011	26853530

Further elucidating the underlying mechanism determining the HER activity will be helpful to design more highly efficient CNT-based catalysts for the HER. In this work, first-principles density functional theory calculations were performed to investigate the HER on a series of CNTs, substitutionally embedded with atomic Mn (MnCNT(n,n)s, n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9) and co-embedded with Mn and double N (MnN2CNT(5,5)). The theoretical calculations suggest that the principal HER active sites on all studied CNT catalysts are the C atoms adjacent to the metal center, and the HER is dominated by the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism with the Heyrovsky reaction as the rate-determining step. Tuning the CNT curvatures and embedding heteroatoms (Mn and N) could elevate the C p-band center (epsilon(p)), weaken the absolute H adsorption free energy (|Delta G(H*)|), lower the absolute electrode potential (Uabs0), and thus enhance the HER performance. For MnCNT(n,n)s, the HER activity shows a volcano dependence on the surface curvature, peaking at n = 5. Substitutionally doping double N atoms into MnCNT(5,5) could further substantially enhance the HER activity, reflected by its thirtyfold current density relative to platinum. Furthermore, the Uabs0 descriptor, besides Delta G(H*) and the free energy barrier, could overcome the limitation of epsilon(p) applied in the same metal-embedded CNTs, extending to describe the HER activity of the transition metal-incorporated CNT system.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000496289200005

Heterogeneous CuCo2S4@Ni(OH)(2) nanorod arrays with abundant oxygen vacancy firstly have been designed through a controllable hydrothermal and electrodeposition method. The synergies and open structures of the particular hierarchical structure together with the abundant oxygen vacancies offer more surface reactive centers, which can promote the electron transfer rate and reduce the activation energy of intermediate species. The CuCo2S4@Ni(OH)(2)-20 min nanorod arrays are considered as an excellent and robust electrocatalyst for the proton reduction under an alkaline condition with an extraordinary low overpotential of 117 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The CuCo2S4@Ni(OH)(2)-20 min heterostructures electrode is also stable and robust for the water oxidation reaction, needing an overpotential of only 250 mV to obtain 100 mA cm(-2). Therefore, an alkaline electrolyzer was designed using CuCo2S4@Ni(OH)(2)-20 min nanorod arrays as bifunctional electrocatalyst, which can complete overall water splitting at a cell voltage of 1.47 V with 10 mA cm(-2), suggesting a promising combination of the same material for efficient overall water splitting device. The cell voltage of 1.47 V, to our knowledge, is among the lowest values of the published support catalysts for electrocatalytic water splitting up to now.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000485515300001	31478600

The predominant peak observed at 36.6 degrees corresponds to the X-ray crystal plane orientation of (1-10) and confirmed rhombohedral phase MnNiO3. The other well-resolved peaks were attributed to MnNiO3/Mn3O4 nanocomposites. Vibrational properties and metal oxygen vibrations were revealed in Fourier transform infrared profile around similar to 570-620 cm(-1). The oxygen vacancies and electron trapping mechanism were exposed from photoluminescence spectra. The combined morphology of nanorods and distinguished nanopetals was determined for highly active MnNiO3 nanocatalyst. The band structure and modification was thoroughly studied by employing UV-visible diffuse reflection spectra and the observed band gap was 2.8 eV for MnNiO3/Mn3O4 nanocomposites. Cyclic voltammogram and linear sweep voltammogram study were used to investigate the redox behavior and water oxidation nature of the novel MnNiO3/Mn3O4 nanocomposites. A higher OER activity of 274 mA/g at 10 mV/s was achieved for the electrode loaded with optimized electrocatalysts. The excellent conductivity and ionic mobility were confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectra. The 72-h stability test was carried out and long-time durability was reported for the optimized electrocatalysts. Thus, the present study completely dealt with the preparation of novel combinations of MnNiO3/Mn3O4 nanocomposites by using controlled synthesis techniques and the exploration of optimized candidates for efficient water electrolysis process.[GRAPHICS].									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0928-0707	1573-4846		WOS:000483728100001

Herein, CdS nanoparticles are grown in situ on oxygen deficiency-rich WO3-x nanosheets, successfully providing a direct Z-scheme CdS/WO3-x heterojunction to enhance photocatalytic hydrogen production. We demonstrate an effective electron collection in the Z-scheme CdS/WO3-x heterojunction by regulating the relative content of WO3-x. The optimized CdS/20 wt% WO3-x (CW20) affords a high photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of 6545.3 mu mol g(-1)h(-1) in lactic acid aqueous solution under visible light (400-800 nm), which is about 54.1 times that of pure CdS (121.0 mu mol h(-1)). In addition, CW20 also provides a considerable external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 10.03% at lambda = 420 nm. The best-performing CW20 sample is explored by cyclic stability experiment and XRD characterization after hydrogen production, which reveals the robust stability of CW20. The excellent photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the formation of a Z-scheme CdS/WO3-x heterojunction, resulting in an efficient spatial separation of photogenerated carriers. Electron and hole catalytic centers are maintained in two separate components to minimize the adverse products of photocatalytic hydrogen production. This study uncovers the role of oxygen deficiency based on the Z-scheme heterojunction in affecting electron transfer and reaction sites, opening new opportunities for achieving efficient hydrogen production.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1466-8033			WOS:000568966100011

Herein, we show that reaction sites consisting of single Pt atoms and neighboring oxygen vacancies (V-O) can be prepared on CeO2 (Pt-1/CeO2) with unique catalytic properties for the reversible dehydrogenation and rehydrogenation of large molecules such as cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane. Specifically, we find that the dehydrogenation rate of cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane on such sites can reach values above 32,000 mol(H2) mol(Pt)(-1) h(-1), which is 309 times higher than that of conventional supported Pt nanoparticles. Combining of DRIFTS, AP-XPS, EXAFS, and DFT calculations, we show that the Pt-1/CeO2 catalyst exhibits a super-synergistic effect between the catalytic Pt atom and its support, involving redox coupling between Pt and Ce ions, enabling adsorption, activation and reaction of large molecules with sufficient versatility to drive abstraction/addition of hydrogen without requiring multiple reaction sites.Developing highly efficient and reversible hydrogenation-dehydrogenation catalysts shows great promise for hydrogen storage technologies. Here the authors develop a highly efficient and reversible de/rehydrogenation single-site platinum catalyst which exhibits great promise for hydrogen storage technologies with cyclic alkanes/aromatics as liquid organic hydrogen carriers.									8	0	0	0	2	0	7				2041-1723		WOS:000771136200006	35232968

However, carbon cathodes usually present poor catalytic activities toward oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER), resulting in a large charge over-potential and a short cycling life. In this work, a non-aqueous Li-O-2 battery with a bifunctional catalyst, ruthenium dioxide (RuO2)-decorated carbonized tubular polypyrrole, is reported. Compared with conventional catalysts, the bifunctional catalyst has two special features: i), a high content of graphitic N, and ii), a large number of RuO2 nanoparticles. The battery with the novel bifunctional catalyst shows a large discharge capacity (10095 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 200 mA g(-1)), a high rate capacity (6758 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 1000 mA g(-1)) and a long cycling life (55 cycles at the current density of 500 mA g(-1)). In addition, at the first cycle with a fixed capacity of 1000 mAh g(-1), the discharge and charge over-potentials are only 0.28 and 0.78 V, which are 180 and 360 mV lower than those of the batteries fitted with pristine carbonized tubular polypyrrole cathode.

Here we present CoOx/Ti electrocatalytic films deposited by thermal and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (CVD) onto titanium substrates. We report electrochemical (EC), photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements. The electrochemical behavior of the samples was correlated with the chemical and electronic structure by recording XPS spectra before and after each electrochemical treatment (conditioning and cyclovoltammetry). The results show that the electrochemical behavior of CoOx/Ti strongly depends on the resulting electronic structure and composition. The thermal deposition leads to the formation of a pure Co(II)O-x which transforms to a mixed Co(II)Co(III)O-x during the OER. This change in oxidation state is coupled with a decrease in overpotential from eta = 0.57 V to eta = 0.43 V at 5 mA cm(-2). Plasma deposition in oxygen leads to a Co(III)-dominated mixed CoOx, that has a lower onset potential as deposited due to a higher Co(III) content in the initial deposited material. After the OER XPS results of the CoOx/Ti indicate a partial formation of hydroxides and oxyhydroxides on the oxide surface. Finally the plasma deposition in air, results in a CoOxOH2 surface, that is able to completely oxidizes during OER to an oxyhydroxide Co(III)OOH. With the in situ formed CoOOH we present a highly active catalyst for the OER (eta = 0.34 at 5 mA cm(-2); eta = 0.37 V at 10 mA cm(-2)).									78	1	0	0	4	0	77			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000374786300005	26694730

This paper describes the interaction between oxidation and damage during high temperature aging of polymeric matrix composites. The oxidation layer growth in neat resins depends upon the relative dominance of the oxygen diffusion rate in oxidized region and the reaction rate in the un-oxidized region. Oxidation in fiber-reinforced composites is seen to be orthotropic with axial direction of fiber being the preferred oxidation growth direction. Transverse oxidation growth correlates with growth rates in neat resins after accounting for the fiber microstructure effects and attributing additional diffusivity to the fibers and fiber-matrix interphase. However, the oxidation growth in areas where discrete cracking is observed is substantially higher. Close coupling is observed between discrete crack growth rates and oxidation layer growth rates in axial direction. Damage evolution and the interaction of damage and oxygen diffusivity are critical factors and must be considered for oxidation growth prediction in composite materials. In this paper, a model-based analysis of oxidation in composites is presented using a systematic methodology that determines the relative effects of the matrix oxidation, role of fiber and interface effects and that of the damage growth. Carbon fiber-reinforced PMR-15 composites are used for both experimental characterization and simulations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Nanostructured manganese oxides have been dispersed on commercial carbon nanotubes as a result of both preparation methods. A strong influence of the preparation history on the electrocatalytic performance was observed. The as-prepared state of a 6.5 wt.?% MnOx/CNT sample could be comprehensively characterized by comparison to an unsupported MnOx reference sample. Various characterization techniques revealed distinct differences in the oxidation state of the Mn centers in the as-prepared samples as a result of the two different preparation methods. As expected, the oxidation state is higher and near +4 for the symproportionated MnOx compared to the impregnated sample, where +2 was found. In both cases an easy adjustability of the oxidation state of Mn by post-treatment of the catalysts was observed as a function of oxygen partial pressure and temperature. Similar adjustments of the oxidation state are also expected to happen under water splitting conditions. In particular, the 5 wt.?% MnO/CNT sample obtained by conventional impregnation was identified as a promising catalytic anode material for water electrolysis at neutral pH showing high activity and stability. Importantly, this catalytic material is comparable to state-of-art MnOx catalyst operating in strongly alkaline solutions and, therefore, offers advantages for hydrogen production from waste and sea water under neutral, hence, environmentally benign conditions.									129	7	0	0	8	0	129			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000304441900021

Moreover, in the process of water oxidation catalysis, the inhibition of severe photocorrosion is an immense task, requiring effective photogenic hole-transfer kinetics. Herein, stratified Co-MnO2@CdS/CoS hollow cubes with spatially separated catalytic sites were rationally designed and fabricated as highly efficient controllable catalysts for photocatalytic overall water splitting. The unique self-templated method, including a continuous anion/cation-exchange reaction, integrates a Co-doped oxidation co-catalyst (Co-MnO2) and a reduction co-catalyst (CoS) on the nanocubes with uniform interface contact and ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) nanometer sheets. We demonstrate that the stratified Co-MnO2@CdS/CoS hollow cubes can provide an abundance of active sites for surface redox reactions and contribute to the separation and migration of the photoionization charge carriers. In particular, CoS nanoparticles dispersed on the walls of CdS hollow cubes were identified as reduction co-catalysts accelerating hydrogen generation, while Co-MnO2 nanosheets attached to the inner walls of the CdS hollow cube were oxidation co-catalysts, promoting oxygen evolution dynamics. Benefiting from the desirable structural and compositional advantages, optimized stratification of Co-MnO2@CdS/CoS nanocubes provided a catalytic system devoid of precious metals, which exhibited a remarkable overall photocatalytic water-splitting rate (735.4 (H-2) and 361.1 (O-2) mu mol h(-1) g(-1)), being among the highest values reported thus far for CdS-based catalysts. Moreover, an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 1.32% was achieved for hydrogen evolution at 420 nm. This study emphasizes the importance of rational design on the structure and composition of photocatalysts for overall water splitting.

All compounds crystallize in the orthorhombic crystal structure with the space group Pbnm down to 3 K, showing a random distribution of Fe and Ru at the B site. Thermogravimetric analysis indicates oxygen deficiency in the Ca-rich and formal oxygen hyperstoichiometry in the La-rich members of the present series. While Mossbauer spectra verify the Fe3+ state for all compositions, the XANES study reveals a variable Run+ oxidation state which decreases with increasing La content. The end member actually is a Ru3+/Ru4+ compound with possibly some cation vacancies. From magnetic susceptibility and neutron diffraction measurements, the presence of a G-type antiferromagnetic ordering was observed with a drastic increase in transition temperature from 275 K (Ca1.5La0.5FeRuO6) to 570 K (La2FeRuO6). Mossbauer spectroscopy confirms the presence of long-range ordering but, due to local variations in the exchange interactions, the magnetic states are microscopically inhomogeneous. All the samples are variable range hopping semiconductors. A complex interplay between structural features, charge states, anion or cation defects, and atomic disorder determines the magnetic properties of the present disordered 3d/4d double perovskite series.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000698177900001	34549738

ACS CATALYSIS				8	3			1818	+		10.1021/acscatal.7b03734				MAR 2018	2018	Supported bimetallic nanoparticles have good activities in heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysts. Among those systems, PdAu shows improved stability and enhanced catalytic activity toward electrochemical reactions such as oxygen reduction, formic acid oxidation, and hydrogen evolution. The aim of this work was to study comprehensively the influence of ligand and ensemble effects on surface processes, such as oxide formation/reduction, oxidation of adsorbed CO, and adsorption of hydrogen, taking place on carbon-supported PdAu nanoparticles of different compositions. Toward that end, we thoroughly characterized the properties of PdAu/C catalysts with nominal Au contents of 20-50 atom % prepared by the same procedure and having similar average particle diameters. The combination of results obtained by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicates that nanoparticles had Pd-enriched surfaces and a Au-rich interior. X-ray absorption spectroscopy ()CAS) measurements around the Pd L3 edge evidenced that Au promotes an increase in the electronic occupation of the Pd 4d band, consistent with XPS results showing varying amounts of surfacelike and bulklike Pd oxide and metallic Pd. We show herein that ligand effects determine the formation of a Pd oxide layer on PdAu/C catalysts and ensemble effects govern hydrogen and CO adsorption. CO oxidation is delayed as the Au content increases as result of the decreasing availability of oxygen-containing species.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000426804100026

In the presence of gaseous oxygen the bulk structure remains essentially unchanged for more than 5 h, and during this time the catalyst is selective for C2 production; following this there is rapid reduction of the catalyst through NiO to Ni metal, with corresponding evolution of CO2 and finally CO as the dominant gaseous products. By contrast, in the absence of gaseous oxygen the bulk structure immediately starts to decompose, yielding successively a total of four rock salt-type lithium nickel oxide phases. In this case the initial selectivity for C2 Production is 100% and declines as the solid breaks down. The in situ measurements allow direct correlation of the appearance of different solid phases during the experiments with variations in the rate of production of gaseous products, giving important insights into the behavior of this material as catalyst. A reaction scheme is proposed based on the catalytic and structural results. Additional studies of the structure of Li+0.45Ni2+0.10Ni3+0.45O as a function of temperature in air using Rietveld structure refinements have been carried out to augment the in situ studies, showing that the ordered lithium nickel oxide structure is essentially invariant up to 700-degrees-C in air.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0897-4756			WOS:A1992JQ59000013

Herein, a phosphorus modified mesoporous AuRh film grown on Ni foam (P-mAuRh film/NF) is synthesized via the combination of an in situ micelle assisted chemical displacement method and post phosphorization treatment process, and serves as a highly active and durable electrocatalyst for both the HER and UOR. Impressively, the self-supported P-mAuRh film/NF as both the anodic and cathodic catalyst can efficiently drive overall urea-assisted water electrolysis. The outstanding electrocatalytic performance of P-mAuRh film/NF is attributed to the synergism of the mesoporous film nanoarchitecture and optimized bimetallic composition, as well as the electron interaction between metal and nonmetal. This research offers a universal route to synthesize bifunctional nonmetal-metal mesoporous films for energy-saving H-2 production via hybrid water electrolysis.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000742161400001

Herein, a selective phosphorization strategy by controlling the only phosphorization of higher activity Ni atoms in precursor to construct Ni2P/MoO2/NF heterostructure nanorods arrays (Ni2P/MoO2/NF HNRs) electrocatalyst is realized. By effective interface construction, the strong electronic coupling effect is induced by spontaneously electron transfer across Ni2P/MoO2 heterointerface, which modulates the electronic structure and enhances intrinsic catalytic activity, leading to outstanding electrocatalytic activities and long-time durability in alkaline electrolyte. The Ni2P/MoO2/NF HNRs present ultralow overpotential of 34 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction. Impressively, when coupled it for urea-assisted electrolyzer, the potential as low as 1.35 V is needed to achieve 10 mA.cm(-2). Experimental and density functional theory results reveal that the strong electronic coupling effect enhances the synergy effect between Ni2P and MoO2, beneficial for boosting the H-2 production.									45	3	0	0	3	0	46			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000532683200050

Herein, nanohybrid organic-inorganic nanosheets are grown on carbon paper via a pulse-electrochemical deposition technique. A benzo[2,1,3]selenadiazole-5-carbonyl protected dipeptide BSeFL (BSe = benzoselenadiazole; F = phenylalanine; and L = leucine) cross-linked with Ni2+ ions (Ni-BSeFL) and nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)(2)) in a BSeFL/Ni(OH)(2) electrode exhibits stable electrocatalytic activity toward urea oxidation. The cross-linked nanosheet morphology of nanohybrids was optimized by controlling the reduction potential during pulse electrodeposition. The BSeFL/Ni(OH)(2) (-1.0 V) nanohybrid deposited at -1.0 V provides abundant active sites of Ni3+ with low charge transfer resistance (R-CT) and high exchange current density (J(0)) at the electrocatalytic interface. The nanohybrids with Ni-BSeFL and Ni(OH)(2) show low overpotential and superior stability for electrocatalytic urea electro-oxidation. The BSeFL/Ni(OH)(2) (-1.0 V) nanohybrid based electrode requires a low potential of 1.30 V (vs. RHE) to acquire a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) in urea containing alkaline solution which is lower than that for water oxidation in alkaline solution (1.49 V vs. RHE). The organic-inorganic nanohybrid BSeFL/Ni(OH)(2) (-1.0 V) shows durability over 10 h for oxygen evolution and urea electro-oxidation, thereby confirming the BSeFL/Ni(OH)(2) (-1.0 V) nanohybrid-based electrode as an efficient electrocatalyst.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000597751800021	33210694

Significant improvement of stability was observed for Mn2O3-coverded n-TiO2, i.e., n-TiO2/Mn2O3, film electrodes. The Mn2O3, layer also enhanced the rate of oxygen evolution instead of H2O2 formation, due to its catalytic effect. The highest photoresponse was found in n-TiO2 film prepared at 850 degrees C for 13 min by thermal oxidation. The bandgap energy of both n-TiO2 and n-TiO2/Mn2O3 films was found 2.85 eV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results indicate rutile structure for the n-TiO2 film. The flat-band potential of the n-TiO2 film was found to be -1.13 V/SCE from the intercept of the Mott-Schottky plot. The highest potential-assisted photoconversion efficiencies, 5.1% and 4.1%, and the corresponding practical photoconversion efficiencies, 2.0% and 1.6%, were obtained for photoelectrolysis of water by n-TiO2 and n-TiO2/Mn2O3 films, respectively.					4th International Symposium on Quantum Confinement - Nanoscale Materials, Devices, and Systems, at the 191st Meeting of the Electrochemical-Society4th International Symposium on Quantum Confinement - Nanoscale Materials, Devices, and Systems, at the 191st Meeting of the Electrochemical-Society	MAY 04-07, 1997MAY 04-07, 1997	Electrochem SocElectrochem Soc	MONTREAL, CANADAMONTREAL, CANADA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					1-56677-138-2	WOS:A1997BK03E00007

The carbonate oxygen isotopic compositions range from +20.0 to +35.7parts per thousand for delta(18)O, +8.0 to + 17.7parts per thousand, for 5170, and -0.7 to - 2.7parts per thousand for Delta(17)O. Carbonate Delta(17)O values are inversely correlated with MAI and track the evolution of fluid composition from higher to lower Delta(17)O values with increasing alteration on the CM parent body. Similar A 170 values for calcite and dolomite fractions from the same splits of the same meteorites indicate that calcite and dolomite in each split precipitated from a single fluid reservoir: However, reversed calcite dolomite fractionations (delta(18)O(dol) - delta(18)O(cc)) indicate that the fluid was subject to processes, such as freeze-thaw or evaporation, that fractionated isotopes in a mass-dependent way. Consideration of the carbonate isotopic data in the context of previously proposed models for aqueous alteration of carbonaceous chondrites has provided important insights into both the evolving alteration conditions and the utility of the models themselves. The data as a whole indicate that the isotopic evolution of the fluid was similar to that predicted by the closed-system, two-reservoir models, but that a slightly larger matrix-water fractionation factor may apply. In the context of this model, more altered samples largely reflect greater reaction progress and thus probably indicate more extended times of fluid exposure. Petrographic observations of carbonates reveal a trend of variable carbonate morphology correlated with alteration that is also consistent with changes in the duration of fluid-rock interaction. The data can also be reconciled with fluid-flow models in a restricted region of the parent body, which is consistent with assertions that the different types of carbonaceous chondrites derive from different regions of their parent bodies.

Toward this end, an effective and promising approach is based on the electrolysis of water for hydrogen production. To date, the most effective hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts are Pt-group metals with a low overpotential to generate large cathodic current densities. However, the high cost and scarcity severely limit their broad utilization. As alternatives to Pt electrocatalysts, transition metal compounds as effective HER catalysts have been prepared in a series of recent studies. However, thus far, it remained a great challenge to develop highly active HER catalysts with a low overpotential based on earth-abundant and cost-effective materials. Recently, the new significant developments about carbon-based electrocatalysts with a low overpotential toward HER have stimulated a great deal of the researchers' interest. In particular, the catalytic activity of carbon based-catalysts can be enhanced by transition metal nanoparticles as core and nonmetal doping into carbon skeleton, which can modulate the electronic state density of carbon to produce new active sites for HER. In this feature article, we review the research progress in the development of carbon-based electrocatalysts toward HER in acid electrolytes throughout the past few years. In addition, some notable matters and challenge in the research of HER are discussed in this review. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Monometallic Fe (catalyst A) and Co (catalyst F) were also prepared along with mixed-metal Fe/Co catalysts (B-E) by changing the Fe/Co ratio. For mixed-metal catalysts (B-E) SEM energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirmed the incorporation of both Fe and Co in the catalysts. However, a spindle-shaped morphology, typically known for the Fe-MIL-88B structure and confirmed by PXRD analysis, was only observed for catalysts A-D. To test the catalytic potential of mixed-metal MOFs, reduction of nitroarenes was selected as a benchmark reaction. Incorporation of Co enhanced the activity of the catalysts compared with the parent NH2-BDC-Fe catalyst. These MOFs were also tested as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the best activity was exhibited by mixed-metal Fe/Co-MOF (Fe/Co batch ratio=1). The catalyst provided a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 410 mV overpotential, which is comparable to the benchmark OER catalyst (i.e., RuO2). Moreover, it showed long-term stability in 1 m KOH. In a third catalytic test, dehydrogenation of sodium borohydride showed high activity (turnover frequency=87 min(-1)) and hydrogen generation rate (67 L min(-1) g(-1) catalyst). This is the first example of the synthesis of bimetallic MOFs as multifunctional catalysts particularly for catalytic reduction of nitroarenes and dehydrogenation reactions.									50	2	0	0	3	0	51			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000476850600001	31163099

To improve the OER performance of metal tellurides, we propose to synthesize a cobalt-nickel bimetallic telluride electrocatalyst (Ni-doped CoTe2) by a one-step hydrothermal method with the addition of transition metal Ni sources in this work. The influence of the addition amount of NiCl2 center dot 6H(2)O and the reaction temperature on the crystal structure, morphology, chemical composition, and electrocatalytic performance is studied systematically. The results show that the optimized sample Co@0.2gNiCoTe(2)-240 exhibited a low overpotential of 280 mV to attain an anodic current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and the Tafel slope was as low as 34 mV dec(-1). The improved activity and stability could be attributed to the Ni-doped CoTe2 structure that has an increased electrochemical surface area, the formation of the high valence state of Co and/or Ni species, rapid charge transfer ability, and faster catalytic kinetics during the OER process. This work not only provides a highly active and durable 3D catalyst for the OER under alkaline conditions, but also provides a new approach for the development of bimetallic tellurides for energy conversion application.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2052-1553			WOS:000683765700001

Here, it is reported that the MoS2 basal planes could be activated by growing nickel phosphide (Ni2P) nanoparticles on them. Thus a Ni2P/MoS2 heterostructure is constructed via in situ phosphidation of an indigenously synthesized NiMoS4 salt as a single precursor to form a widely cross-doped and chemically connected heterostructure. The conductivity and stability of the Ni2P/MoS2 heterostructure are further enhanced by hybridization with conductive N-doped carbon supports. As a result, the Ni2P/MoS2/N:RGO or Ni2P/MoS2/N:CNT electrocatalyst displays Pt-like HER performance in acidic media, outperforming the incumbent best HER electrocatalyst, Pt/C, in a more meaningful high current density region (>200 mA cm(-2)) making them a promising candidate for practical water electrolysis applications. Since nonprecious metal catalysts showing Pt-like HER performance in acidic media are rare, the Ni2P/MoS2 heterostructure catalyst is a promising candidate for practical hydrogen production via water electrolysis.									102	5	0	0	4	0	101			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000460474200001

This work investigated adsorption of ethanol on bimetallic catalysts containing Pt with loading 01 0.5 wt% and Co, Cu, or Mn with loading of 15 wt% supported on RH-MCM-41 by temperature programmed desorption (ethanol-TPD) and thermogravimetric analysis (ethanol-TGA). Evolution of gases from the ethanol-TPD indicated the role of oxides as potential oxygen supplier in ethanol oxidation. On the monometallic catalyst containing oxides of Co, Cu, and Mn on MCM-41, the oxide of Co was the better oxygen supplier than that of the others to react with the adsorbed ethanol to produce CO2. Furthermore, the bimetallic 0.5Pt-15Co/RH-MCM-41 with cobalt in the form of CO3O4, showed the highest ethanol adsorption and CO2 desorption. Consequently, ethanol oxidation was studied on the bimetallic 0.5Pt-15Co/RH-MCM-41 by in situ infrared spectroscopy in which intermediates and reaction pathways were proposed when ethanol and oxygen were flowed through the cell at various temperatures. Results from the ethanol oxidation in a fixed bed flow reactor showed that the bimetallic catalyst gave lower ethanol conversion than monometallic Pt but seemed to be more stable than the monometallic Pt catalyst.

Although carbon materials have been amended to Ti4O7 electrodes to enhance the electrochemical performance or are present as an unwanted residual during the electrode fabrication, there has been no comprehensive investigation of how these carbon materials affect the electrochemical performance of the resultant Ti4O7 electrodes. As such, we investigated the electrochemical properties of Ti4O7 electrodes impregnated with carbon materials at different contents (and chemical states). Results of this study showed that while pure Ti4O7 electrodes exhibited an extremely low rate of interfacial electron transfer, the introduction of minor amounts of carbon materials (at values as low as 0.1 wt %) significantly facilitated the electron transfer process and decreased the oxygen evolution reaction potential. The oxygen-containing functional groups have been shown to play an important role in interfacial electron transfer with moderate oxidation of the carbon groups aiding electron uptake at the electrode surface (and consequently organic oxidation) while the generation of carboxyl groups-a process that is likely to occur in long-term operation-increased the interfacial resistance and thus retarded the oxidation process. Results of this study provide a better understanding of the relationship between the nature of the electrode surface and anodic oxidation performance with these insights likely to facilitate improved electrode design and optimization of operation of anodic oxidation reactors.									29	0	0	0	16	0	29			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000527738300056	32202775

A decrease in the average Si-O-Si angle, an increase in the population of three-membered rings and an increase of the glass polymerization are evidenced. The molecular oxygen appears in the irradiated glasses after the irradiation fluence reaches approximately 10(16) ions/cm(2). The 02 concentration decreases with the depth of irradiated glass at the ion fluence of 2 x 10(16) ions/cm(2). A sodium depleted layer at the surface and a depleted zone at around the penetration depth of 5 MeV Xe ions are observed. The thickness of the sodium depleted layer increases with the irradiation fluence. Moreover, comparing with previous results after electron and Ar ion irradiation, it can be concluded that the nuclear energy deposition can partially inhibit the formation of molecular oxygen and increase the threshold value of electron energy deposition for the molecular oxygen formation.

J	Beuzet, Emilie; Lamy, Jean-Sylvestre; Perron, Hadrien; Simoni, Eric; Ducros, Gerard								Ruthenium release modelling in air and steam atmospheres under severe accident conditions using the MAAP4 code								NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN				246				157	162		10.1016/j.nucengdes.2011.08.025				MAY 2012	2012	In a nuclear power plant (NPP), a severe accident is a low probability sequence that can lead to core fusion and fission product (FP) release to the environment (source term). For instance during a loss-of-coolant accident, water vaporization and core uncovery can occur due to decay heat. These phenomena enhance core degradation and, subsequently, molten materials can relocate to the lower head of the vessel. Heat exchange between the debris and the vessel may cause its rupture and air ingress. After lower head failure, steam and air entering in the vessel can lead to degradation and oxidation of materials that are still intact in the core. Indeed, Zircaloy-4 cladding oxidation is very exothermic and fuel interaction with the cladding material can decrease its melting temperature by several hundred of Kelvin. FP release can thus be increased, noticeably that of ruthenium under oxidizing conditions. Ruthenium is of particular interest because of its high radio-toxicity due to Ru-103 and Ru-106 isotopes and its ability to form highly volatile compounds, even at room temperature, such as gaseous ruthenium tetra-oxide (RuO4). It is consequently of great need to understand phenomena governing steam and air oxidation of the fuel and ruthenium release as prerequisites for the source term issues.A review of existing data on these phenomena shows relatively good understanding. In terms of oxygen affinity, the fuel is oxidized before ruthenium, from UO2 to UO2+x. Its oxidation is a rate-controlling surface exchange reaction with the atmosphere, so that the stoichiometric deviation and oxygen partial pressure increase. High temperatures combined with the presence of oxygen in the atmosphere lead to fuel expansion and formation of cracks. In these conditions, intra- and inter-granular diffusions of ruthenium in the fuel matrix are so enhanced that it is possible to consider an instantaneous volatilisation of ruthenium oxides at the fuel surface.Based on these considerations, a completely new model has been implemented in the EDF local version of the MAAP4.07 severe accident code (Modular Accident Analysis Program), owned by EPRI (Electric Power Research Institute). The fuel oxidation modelling takes into account many kinds of atmospheres (steam and/or air and/or hydrogen), the stoichiometric evolution and the oxygen partial pressure of the fuel matrix. The release of ruthenium oxides is calculated considering their particular reaction constants. The model was assessed by the simulation of different CEA-VERCORS experiments in air, steam and mixed atmospheres. These experiments are specifically designed to study FP release from fuel under different atmospheres and temperatures. This paper deals with the main results obtained with MAAP4.07 when simulating these tests. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, their applications remain faces great challenging due to its unsatisfactory exposure to catalytic active sites and electronic conductivity. Here, powder sintering was used to prepare Ni-P-Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (Ni-P-MWCNTs) composite electrodes with a hierarchical flower-like structure with a large surface area, the composite electrodes were synthesized by phosphating mixed powder (porous nickel powder, red phosphorus and MWCNTs). Due to the flower-like nanoplate hierarchical structure, the fast vectorial electron transfer along the building block nanoplates was effectively induced and active sites were highly exposed. The resulting Ni-P-43 wt%MWCNTs shows high activity and durability towards the Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under acidic conditions. It demands extremely low onset-potential of 29 mV, 96 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This work suggests an effective method to facilitate grain preferred orientation growth and exposure high activity active, experimental results demonstrate that the electrocatalytic performance of as-prepared Ni-P-MWCNTs were successfully optimized through the addition of MWCNTs, and might promote further study of the TMPs catalysts for HER.

The results show that the conditioning procedures do not have much influence on the catalytic activity, oxygen transport, and proton resistance in the catalyst layer. However, the conditioning procedures have significant influence on the hydration of the MEAs, which determines the electrochemical performances of the MEAs before eventually reaching their maximum performances. Among the various procedures investigated, the combination of methanol circulation and electric load is a convenient and effective in situ way to activate the fresh MEAs in DMFC, which speeds up the hydration of the MEAs due to large amount of water on both electrodes.

However, deficient active sites limit its specific capacitance (SC). Herein, we demonstrate that engineering ZF's interfacial microstructure and hydrophilicity mitigate this limitation. ZF@Nf is used as the working electrode in a 3-electrode cell and subjected to multiple oxygen evolution reaction cycles in potassium hydroxide. Systematic changes in ZF's porosity, crystallinity, hydrophilicity, and composition after each cycle were characterised using spectroscopy, sorption isotherm, microscopy and photography techniques. During cycling, the edges of ZF partially phase-transform into a dense polycrystalline zinc(iron) oxyhydroxide film via semi-reversible oxidation resulting in zinc(iron)oxyhydroxide/ZF interface formation. The maximum ion-accessible zinc(iron)oxyhydroxide film density is obtained after 1000 cycles. Strong ionic interaction at the interface induces high hydrophilicity, this together with the 3dimensional diffusion channels of the zinc(iron)oxyhydroxide significantly increase electroactive surface area and decrease ion diffusion resistance. Consequently, the SC, energy density, and rate-capability of the interface compare favourably with state-of-the-art electrodes. The strong interfacial interaction and polycrystallinity also ensure long-term electrochemical stability. This study proves the direct correlation between interfacial microstructure and hydrophilicity, and SC which provides a blueprint for future energy-storage electrode design. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Polyaluminocarbosilane (PACS) is the precursor of Al-containing SiC fiber. PACS was synthesized via elimination of HCl during the reaction between dimethyaluminium chloride ((CH3)(2)AlCl) and poly-carbosilane (PCS) in this work. Composition and structure of the as-synthesized PACS were characterized by elemental analysis, FT IR, GPC, and TG, respectively. The results showed that, the yield of the reaction was 72.5% and the reaction degree of Si-H bonds was 16.5%. The obtained PACS had melting point of about 218.8 degrees C, experimental formula as SiC2.003Al0.023O0.048H3.713, number average molecular weight M-n of 1859, weight average molecular weight 11,4, of 4895, polydispersity index (M-w/M-n) of 2.632. The molecular structure of PACS was similar to that of PCS. Four stages could be divided during pyrolysis process of PACS according to TG spectrum. The ceramic yield was found to be around 67.3% at 1000 degrees C in N-2 atmosphere. The PACS precursor is melt spinnable into flexible and uniform green fibers with the diameter about 12.6 mu m.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows that the electron density features change in density of state with mixing of delocalized valence states as well as localized deeper energy states of O(p), Ni(d), and Ru(d) for the highly desodiated Na-1-(x)[Ni2/3Ru1/3]O-2 electrode, revealing the covalent characteristic of the transition metal (TM)-O and TM-TM bonds in the charged system. These properties lead to cycling stability for 200 cycles, with approximate to 79% of the capacity retained at a rate of 1C (210 mA g(-1)). Operando X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and DFT calculations reveal the reversible electrochemical activity of the Ni2+/Ni3+ and O2-/O1- redox reactions, which are sustainable throughout the cycles. In addition, no loss of oxygen from the crystal structure of Na[Ni2/3Ru1/3]O-2 occurs according to differential electrochemical mass spectrometry. The findings provide additional insight into the complex mechanism of the oxygen redox activity of high-capacity O3-type cathode materials for SIBs, encouraging further studies on their development.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000652107800001

This study presents a facile approach for the synthesis of nanostructured pyrite-phase transition metal dichalcogenides as highly active, earthabundant catalysts in electrochemical hydrogen production. Iron disulfide (FeS2) nanoparticles are in situ loaded and stabilized on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) through a current-induced high-temperature rapid thermal shock (approximate to 12 ms) of crushed iron pyrite powder. FeS2 nanoparticles embedded in between RGO exhibit remarkably improved electrocatalytic performance for HER, achieving 10 mA cm(-2) current at an overpotential as low as 139 mV versus a reversible hydrogen electrode with outstanding long-term stability under acidic conditions. The presented strategy for the design and synthesis of highly active earth-abundant nanomaterial catalysts paves the way for lowcost and large-scale electrochemical energy applications.									120	12	0	0	1	0	122			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000414918700013

The results suggest that the N-MWCNT is favorable for the dispersion of few layer MoS2 nanosheets due to the strong interaction between the N-containing groups and Mo precursor. The N-MWCNT coated with few layer MoS2 (MoS2/N-MWCNT) exhibits the highest HER activity: onset potential of 90 mV vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, Tafel slope of 40 mV dec(-1), high current density of 80.3 mA cm(-2) at overpotential 0.2 V, together with excellent stability during 10,000 cycles. Such high HER activity is superior to most of MoS2 based catalysts reported so far, and attributed to the intimate contacts between highly conductive network of N MWCNT and thin MoS2 nanosheets, the high quantity of unsaturated sulfur atoms or the bridging S-2(2-), and high pyridinic and graphitic N concentrations. This work shows that the few-layer MoS2 nanosheets coated on conductive N-doped MWCNT has a great potential for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

J	Kercek, A; Hillebrandt, W; Truran, JW								Three-dimensional simulations of classical novae								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				345	3			831	840						MAY 1999	1999	We present first results of three-dimensional (3D-) calculations of turbulent and degenerate hydrogen-burning on top of a C+O white dwarf of 1.0 M.. The simulations are carried out by means of a code which solves Euler's equation for an arbitrary equation of state together with a nuclear reaction network and the energy input from nuclear reactions on a Cartesian grid covering a fraction of the white dwarf's surface and accreted envelope. The flow patterns we obtain are very differ ent from those of earlier 2D simulations using the same initial conditions and the same numerical resolution. The possibility of self-enrichment of the accreted hydrogen-rich envelope with carbon and oxygen from the surface layers of the white dwarf during the violent phase of the burning is investigated, and it is demonstrated that self-enrichment proceeds too slowly if the accreted gas has near-solar CNO-abundances at the onset of the thermonuclear runaway. As a result, we do not find a fast nova outburst. This conclusion remains valid if the initial metallicity of the accreted gas is raised by a factor of five. Therefore we conclude that fast nova outbursts indeed require huge enrichments of C and O, as postulated from spherically symmetric models, and that the mechanism which leads to such enhancements must operate prior to the outburst.									61	2	0	0	0	0	62			1432-0746			WOS:000080528100018

Despite tremendous efforts, the development of ORR electrocatalysts with high activity and low cost remains a great challenge. Here, we report the fabrication of well-defined carbon network with honeycomb-like structure as a high-performance catalyst toward ORR, via pyrolysis of bimetallic Co, Zn-zeolitic imidazolate (Co, Zn-ZIF) crystal arrays grown on the surface of layered double hydroxide nanoplatelets (LDHs@Co, Zn-ZIF). The concentration of doped-heteroatoms (N, Co), the graphitic degree as well as the surface porosity of the resulting carbon network can be finely controlled by tuning the Coan molar ratio in the LDHs@Co, Zn-ZIF precursors. The optimal carbon catalyst (CoZn-2) exhibits excellent ORR activity with an onset potential of 0.976 V vs. RHE and a limited current density of 5.8 mA cm(-2), which is superior to commercial Pt/C catalyst. In addition, both an extraordinary long-term stability (similar to 99.5% current retention over 20,000 s) and a strong tolerance against methanol corrosion are also obtained. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to artificially regulate the nanostructure and intrinsic active site of carbon-based ORR electrocatalysts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The present work deals with the development of surface-tuned cobalt oxide (Co3O4) nanoparticles dispersed on nitrogen-doped graphene as a potential ORR electrocatalyst possessing some unique advantages. The thermally reduced nitrogen-doped graphene (NGr) was decorated with three different morphologies of Co3O4 nanoparticles, viz., cubic, blunt edged cubic, and spherical, by using a simple hydrothermal method. We found that the spherical Co3O4 nanoparticle supported NGr catalyst (Co3O4-SP/NGr-24h) has acquired a significant activity makeover to display the ORR activity closely matching with the state-of-the-art Pt supported carbon (PtC) catalyst in alkaline medium. Subsequently, the Co3O4-SP/NGr-24h catalyst has been utilized as the air electrode in a Zn-air battery, which was found to show comparable performance to the system derived from PtC. Co3O4-SP/NGr-24h catalyst has shown several hours of flat discharge profile at the discharge rates of 10, 20, and 50 mA/cm(2) with a specific capacity and energy density of similar to 590 mAh/g(-zn) and,840 Wh/kg(-zn), respectively, in the primary Zn-air battery system. In conjunction, Co3O4-SP/NGr-24h has outperformed as an air electrode in mechanical rechargeable Zn-air battery as well, which has shown consistent flat discharge profile with minimal voltage loss at a discharge rate of 50 mA/cm(2). The present results, thus demonstrate that the proper combination of the tuned morphology of Co3O4 with NGr will be a promising and inexpensive material for efficient and ecofriendly cathodes for Zn-air batteries.									117	2	0	0	3	0	117			1944-8244			WOS:000362243500018	26376490

Herein, biaxially compressive strained nickel/ruthenium core/shell hexagonal nanoplates (Ni/Ru HNPs) with lattice compression of approximate to 5.1% and approximate to 3.2% in the Ru {10-10} and (0002) facets are developed as advanced catalysts for Li-CO2 batteries. It is demonstrated that tuning the electronic structure of Ru shell through biaxially compressive strain engineering can boost the kinetically sluggish CO2 reduction and evolution reactions, thus achieving a high-performance Li-CO2 battery with low charge platform/overpotential (3.75 V/0.88 V) and ultralong cycling life (120 cycles at 200 mA g(-1) with a fixed capacity of 1000 mAh g(-1)). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the biaxially compressive strain can downshift the d-band center of surface Ru atoms and thus weaken the binding of CO2 molecules, which is energetically beneficial for the nucleation and decomposition of Li2CO3 crystals during the discharge and charge processes. This study confirms that strain engineering, though constructing a well-defined core/shell structure, is a promising strategy to improve the inherent catalytic activity of Ru-based materials in Li-CO2 batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000811577600001	35640098

CuM (M=Ti, Zr, Hf) and PdZr amorphous alloys were obtained by Mechanical Alloying from the initial substances, whereas Cu-MO2 (M=Ti, Zr, and Hf) and Pd-ZrO2 composites were obtained, respectively, from Cu2O and PdO through mechanically activated Self propagating High temperature Syntheses involving oxygen displacement. HfO2 powders were produced by Reactive Milling of pure Hf under O-2 atmosphere. The catalysts were tested in the conversion of 4-methylpentan-2-ol. The reaction was performed in a flow-type reactor. Different values of conversion and selectivity were observed for the tested systems, the reaction mainly leading to the 1- and 2-ene compounds, by a dehydration mechanism, and to the ketone, resulting from a competing dehydrogenation process. At variance with the oxide based systems, the amorphous powders showed different structural evolutions, which started during the pretreatment process, and led to stable structures during the catalytic runs. Hypotheses are made concerning the influence of the observed structural reconstruction on the catalytic behaviour.

Herein, a novel hamburger-like nanostructure of a triadic photoanode composed of BiVO4 nanobulks, Co3O4 nanosheets and Ag nanoparticles (NPs), that is, Ag/Co3O4/BiVO4, was designed. In our study, an interlaced 2D ultrathin p-type Co3O4 OEC layer was introduced onto n-type BiVO4 to form a p-n Co3O4/BiVO4 heterojunction with an internal electric field (IEF) in order to facilitate charge transport. Then the modification with Ag NPs can significantly facilitate the separation and transport of photogenerated carriers through the surface plasma resonance (SPR) effect, inhibiting the electron-hole recombination. The resulting Ag/Co3O4/BiVO4 photoanodes exhibit largely enhanced PEC water oxidation performance: the photocurrent density of the ternary photoanode reaches up to 1.84 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is 4.60 times higher than that of the pristine BiVO4 photoanode. The IPCE value is 2.83 times higher than that of the pristine BiVO4 at 400 nm and the onset potential has a significant cathodic shift of 550 mV for the ternary well-constructed photoanode.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2				2046-2069		WOS:000601124900050	35516271

Amorphous materials show much better performance than their crystalline counterparts. However, it is still challenging to design amorphous metal materials. Here, a series of amorphous transition metal nanoparticles (NPs) is successfully synthesized using a twisted covalent organic network (CON) that can provide twisted carbon layers as well as asymmetrically distributed nitrogen. With the fixed monomer pore, a low loading amount of RuCl3 results in amorphous-only Ru nanoclusters (NCs, 1.5 nm), while a high content of RuCl3 leads to crystalline dominant Ru NPs (3 nm). The mixed phased Ru-CON catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) shows extremely low overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) (12.8 mV in 1.0 m KOH) and superior stability (after 100 h test, current loss 5.3% at 75 mA cm(-2)). More importantly, amorphous-only Ru-CON with smaller Ru NCs shows much better mass activity and considerable stability compared to mixed-phase Ru-CON materials since amorphous Ru NPs can provide more active sites than in their crystalline state. With this strategy, amorphous Fe NPs and Ir NPs are successfully prepared for extended applications, and the HER activities are reported.									5	0	0	0	0	0	4			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000751777800001

Mo-terminated defects of MoS2 spontaneously guide the oriented growths of ultrasmall Au nanocrystals on specific sites of liquid-exfoliated (LE) nanosheets, which are experimentally and theoretically performed with programmable heterostructures. The conjugated construction of Au plasmonics and MoS2 semiconductors is manipulated with the aim of the optimal synergistic activity. Additionally, with photonic irradiation, hot electrons excited from attached plasmonic nanostructures are injected into MoS2 semiconductors, which remarkably increases the carrier density of catalyst to match the energy level of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Obeying the principle of proximity, localized MoS2 defect-adjacent Au plasmonics exhibit a more valid pathway, transferring hot electrons from donators to receptors of catalytic sites, in comparison to planar Au decoration. Meanwhile, Au nanostructures located at basal planes are essential for accelerated electron transport rates between catalysts and electrodes, and high stabilities in plasmonic-motivated electrocatalytic performances are guaranteed. The dual function of location-discriminated Au nanostructures accounts for superior electrocatalytic HER performances with photonic excitation, which imparts high inspiration in expanded heterostructures and integrated plasmonic techniques for catalysis and devices.									23	1	0	0	1	0	23			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000467774100077

This novel ganoderma-like heterostructure can not only efficiently disperse and confine the few-layer MoS2 nanosheets to fully expose the edge sites of MoS2, and provide more opportunity to capture the Pt atoms, but also tune the electronic structure to modify the catalytic activity. Because of the favorable dispersibility and exposed large specific surface area, single Pt atoms can be easily anchored on MoS2 nanosheets with ultrahigh loading of 1.8 at% (the highest is 1.3 at% to date). Owing to the ganoderma-like structure and platinum atoms doping, this catalyst shows Pt-like catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction with an ultralow overpotential of 34 mV and excellent durability of only 2% increase in overpotential for 72 h under the constant current density of 10 mA cm(-2).									49	4	0	0	3	0	49			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000437695800008	29806097

Herein, a simple but unique technique is reported to in situ generate a thin-film of alpha-Co(OH)(2) on the surface of zeolite-Y [hereafter referred to as Y-alpha-Co(OH)(2)] that acts as an efficient and stable catalyst for electrochemical water oxidation in alkaline medium. Catalyst Y-alpha-Co(OH)(2) is so stable that it retains its catalytic activity even after 2000 cyclic voltammetric cycles of water oxidation. Expectedly, the chemical composition of alpha-Co(OH)(2) on the surface of zeolite-Y remains same as that of parent Y-alpha-Co(OH)(2) after 2000 electrocatalytic cycles. A Tafel slope as low as 59 mV decade(-1) in 0.1m KOH (pH 13) suggests faster oxygen evolution kinetics (overpotential = 329 mV; turnover frequency = 0.35 mol O-2 (mol Co)(-1)s(-1) at 1 mA cm(-2)) than the existing alpha-Co(OH)(2)-based electrocatalysts operating in alkaline medium.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000403150100030	28430375

However, it is difficult to simultaneously increase the metal loading and reduce the particle size since isolated individual atoms are easy to aggregate into nanoparticles when increasing the metal loading. To tackle this contradiction, we report a bottom-up ligand-mediated strategy to facilely prepare ultrafine CoOx nanoclusters anchored on a Co-N-containing carbon matrix (CoOx@Co-NC). The co-exist of N and O atoms prevent Co atoms agglomerating into large particles and allowing the formation of ultrafine dispersed Co species with large Co loading (up to 20 wt.%). Since the relationship between ultrasmall size and large metal loading is well balanced, the CoOx nanoclusters have no inhibitory effect, but facilitate the catalytic performance of Co-N-4 sites during OER process. Consequently, due to the synergistic effect of ultrafine CoOx nanoclusters and Co-N-4 macrocycles, the as-synthesized CoOx@Co-NC exhibit promising OER activity (eta(10)=370 mV, Tafel plot=40 mV/dec), bettering than that of benchmark RuO2 (eta(10)=411 mV, Tafel plot=72 mV/dec). This ligand-mediated strategy to synthesize carbonaceous materials containing dual active centers with large metal loading is promising for developing active and stable catalysts for electrocatalytic applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000654947500001	33876453

Fouvry, Siegfried/0000-0002-8850-0645			Effect of variable normal force and frequency on fretting wear response of Ti-6Al-4V contact								WEAR				271	9-10	SI		1535	1542		10.1016/j.wear.2011.01.060				JUL 29 2011	2011	Fretting wear damage is one of the major problems in turbojet compressors. In conventional fretting test investigations, the normal force is usually imposed constant whereas contact displacement oscillates. The real blade-disk contact is in fact much more complex: both normal force and relative sliding vary during the cycle. Hence, a new fretting wear system has been developed where the relative sliding evolution can be controlled and the normal force varied, and which includes a contact opening stage during the loading cycle. The wear processes and wear kinetics under constant and variable normal conditions have been investigated. We demonstrate that variation in the normal force and the contact opening sequence significantly modify the wear process. Another result of the normal force variation is that the dissipated energy decreases. In addition to the complex influence of the variable loading spectrum, the influence of frequency is investigated. It is shown that the formation of a titanium nitride layer previously observed in a constant normal force contact, which is related to limited oxygen diffusion inside the contact, no longer takes place in a contact opening situation where the fretting wear damage process is mainly controlled by an oxidation process.

Insight into how catalyst-support interactions can be exploited to optimize the catalytic activity in aqueous electrochemistry, however, is still lacking. In this work, we show the rationally designed electrocatalyst/support interface can greatly impact the overall electrocatalytic activity of Ni-Fe layered double hydroxide (NiFeLDH) in water oxidation. In particular, the use of Co as a non-noble metal support greatly improves the activity of NiFeLDH 10-fold compared to the traditional electrocatalytic supports such as fluorine-/indium-doped tin oxide (FTO/ITO) and glassy carbon. We attribute the activity enhancement of NiFeLDH/Co to the in situ formation of a porous NiFeCoOxHy layer via Co incorporation, which dramatically promotes the redox chemistry of metal centers on the outer surface and enhances the electrical conductivity of the catalyst over 2 orders of magnitude. This new discovery highlights the importance of a rationally designed electrocatalyst/support interface and offers a new paradigm for designing and developing highly active electrocatalytic systems via marrying catalyst and support and creating synergy.									21	4	0	0	2	0	22			2380-8195			WOS:000580586400011

We use the FLASH code to perform multidimensional simulations in the deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) explosion paradigm. Our hybrid progenitor models were produced with the MESA stellar evolution code and include the effects of the Urca process, and we map the progenitor model to the FLASH grid. We performed a suite of DDT simulations over a range of ignition conditions consistent with the progenitor's thermal and convective structure assuming multiple ignition points. To compare the results from these hybrid WD stars to previous results from C-O WDs, we construct a set of C-O WD models with similar properties and similarly simulate a suite of explosions. We find that despite significant variability within each suite, trends distinguishing the explosions are apparent in their Ni-56 yields and the kinetic properties of the ejecta. We compare our results with other recent work that studies explosions from these hybrid progenitors.									18	1	0	0	1	0	18			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000388203200002

Herein, we report a single-atom cobalt electrocatalyst with CoN4 moieties dispersed on nitrogen-doped graphitic nanosheet (marked as CoN4/NG) by a surfactant-assisted approach. The CoN4/NG catalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activities with a half-wave potential of 0.87 V (versus RHE) for ORR and a low overpotential of 0.38 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER. Moreover, the liquid Zn-air battery with the CoN4/NG catalyst as the air electrode displays a superior discharging and charging performance, larger power density, higher energy density and robust stability (without any decay after 100 h cycle test), compared to the 20% Pt/C + IrO2 counterpart. Importantly, the CoN4/NG-based flexible solidstate Zn-air battery also exhibits a high power density and a long-term stability of 30 cycles under flat and folded states, which means that the single-atom cobalt catalyst may be a promising candidate for practical applications in wearable flexible solid batteries.									216	17	0	0	5	0	219			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000438076200080

This work presents an alkaline HER catalyst composed of earth-abundant elements. Through a one-step facile and non-toxic process that combines the phosphorization of copper and the cyclization of polyacrylonitrile (PAN), copper phosphide (Cu3P) particles embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon were synthesized (Cu3P/N-C). In the complex structure, Cu3P is catalytically active towards the HER and N-doped carbon connects the Cu3P particles electrically and physically. Thus, the incorporation of N-doped carbon simply by adding PAN to a phosphorus precursor improves the electrical conductivity and structural integrity of the Cu3P electrode during the HER. To achieve the best HER activity, the P-to-PAN ratio was optimized. Cu3P/N-C prepared on copper foam showed HER overpotentials of 211.1 and 301.8 mV to obtain corresponding current density of 10 and 50 mA cm(-2)in a 1 M KOH solution. At the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the HER overpotential was stably maintained from 211.1 to 222.1 mV for 24 h. In addition to the enlarged electrochemical active surface area (ECSA), the synergistic effects of the disordered carbon structure formed by the influence of the P source result in the superior performance outcomes of Cu3P/N-C.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2398-4902			WOS:000573449300031

Here a series of nearly monodispersed alloyed bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts are introduced, optimized among transition metals, and found to be extremely efficient and highly selective with sharp positive synergy between 2/3 Ni and 1/3 Pt embedded inside a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) support. These catalysts are much more efficient for H-2 release than either Ni or Pt analogues alone on this support, and for instance the best catalyst Ni2Pt@ZiF-8 achieves a TOF of 600 mol(H2).mol(catal)(-1). min(-1) and 2222 mol(H2).mol(pt)(-1)min(-1) under ambient conditions, which overtakes performances of previous Pt-base catalysts. The presence of NaOH boosts H-2 evolution that becomes 87 times faster than in its absence with Ni2Pt@ZiF-8, whereas NaOH decreases H-2 evolution on the related Pt@ZiF-8 catalyst. The ZIF-8 support appears outstanding and much more efficient than other supports including graphene oxide, active carbon and SBA-15 with these nanoparticles. Mechanistic studies especially involving kinetic isotope effects using D2O show that cleavage by oxidative addition of an O-H bond of water onto the catalyst surface is the rate-determining step of this reaction. The remarkable catalyst activity of Ni2Pt@ZiF-8 has been exploited for successful tandem catalytic hydrogenation reactions using ammonia borane as H-2 source. In conclusion the selective and remarkable synergy disclosed here together with the mechanistic results should allow significant progress in catalyst design toward convenient H2 generation from hydrogen-rich substrates in the close future.									212	8	0	0	8	0	215			0002-7863			WOS:000441475800032	29996053

Two different electrolytes containing sulfide were evaluated: a buffered solution of Na2HPO4 at pH 9.2, and a NaOH solution at pH 13. At pH 9.2, deposition of sulfur on the Ni anode was observed, resulting in a significant decrease in electrochemical performance. The composition, morphology, and thickness of the sulfur deposit, as determined by Raman spectroscopy and SEM, was found to strongly depend on the applied potential, and ranged from dense S-8 films to highly porous spherical sulfur structures. Oxidation of the anode was also observed by conversion of Ni to NiS2. The formation of the sulfur film was prevented by performing the reaction at pH 13 in NaOH in the range of - 1.0 V to + 0.6 V versus Hg/HgO. It is proposed that at these highly basic pH values, sulfur is dissolved in the electrolyte in the form of polysulfides, such as S-2(2-) or S-8(2-). When using Ni anodes some oxygen evolution was observed at the anode, in particular at pH 13, resulting in a Faradaic efficiency for sulfur removal of similar to 90%.

In order to understand these processes associated with complex hydrogeochemical evolution, a typical basin was chosen in Houzai, southwest China. The basin was hydrogeologically classified into three zones based on hydrogen and oxygen isotopes as well as the field surveys. Isotopic values were found to be enriched in zone 2 where paddy fields were prevailing with well-developed underground flow systems, and heavier than those in zone 1. Zone 3 was considered as the mixture of zones 1 and 2 with isotopic values falling in the range between the two zones. A conceptual hydrological model was thus proposed to reveal the probable hydrological cycle in the basin. In addition, major processes of long-term chemical weathering in the karstic basin were discussed, and reactions between water and carbonate rocks proved to be the main geochemical processes in karst aquifers.									6	3	0	0	2	0	9			1025-6016	1477-2639		WOS:000331361400005	24437667

The contribution describes for the first time the preparation of RuS2 thin films deposited on (100)- and (111)-oriented FeS2 (pyrite) substrates using reactive magnetron sputtering. The epitaxial growth of 60 nm thick films was confirmed by X-ray diffractometry, texture measurements, and the evaluation of cross section transmission electron micrographs. By optical reflectance spectroscopy and Seebeck coefficient measurements a direct band gap of 1.9 eV and p-type conductivity could be determined. Due to the modest electrochemical stability of the epitaxial layers in electrochemical investigations, polycrystalline films of laurite were also deposited on Ti sheets and Si wafers. As a function of grain size, [S]:[Ru] ratio and grain orientation highest activity towards oxygen evolution was found when the conditions were fulfilled that the layer composition was close to stoichiometry and increased particle sizes showed a strong texture in the grains. Some structural and chemical properties argue for the (100) surface as catalytically active and stable layer compared to other surfaces. (C) 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The thermal reduction of chemically exfoliated graphene oxide (GO) sheets represents an important step for large-scale, solution-based graphene synthesis. Therefore, understanding the reduction process and being able to provide new handles to control the resulting sheet properties is highly desirable. Using atomistic calculations combined with experiments, we study and demonstrate the impact of one such new handle - oxygen clustering on the graphene basal plane - on the structural and electrical properties of reduced GO (rGO) structures. Our calculations reveal that the number of oxygen and carbon atoms removed from the graphene plane during reduction can be tuned depending on the degree of oxygen clustering, without altering the reduction temperature. Further, we demonstrate that rGO thin films with improved sheet resistance (up to 2-fold smaller) can be obtained by facilitating oxygen clustering prior to reduction. Overall, our results highlight that oxygen clustering serves as a useful handle in controlling the structural and electrical properties of the resulting rGO structures, and could be potentially useful toward the synthesis of electrodes, graphene quantum dots and for different graphene-based thin film applications.

The ORR efficiency is found to be changed on different active sites with the variation of dopant position and dopant configuration on the sulfurized GQD. Charge transfer from the dopant site to the active sites and to the intermediates, as well as the binding energy of intermediates on the active sites play an important role to realize the potential determining step, onset potential and the overpotential for ORR. The increase in the doping concentration of S or the presence of oxygen is found to drastically enhance the ORR efficiency of GQD. Furthermore, S-linkers are exploited to connect two GQDs entangled or twisted with each other and resulting in a rather complex system. The combined effect of entangling, S-linkers and presence of a single N dopant at the meta position of the active site resulted in the adsorption of the intermediates with optimum binding strength. Consequently, the ORR activity is found to be enhanced, thereby resulting in a metal-free and cost-effective electrocatalyst with efficiency similar to the Ptbased metal catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000648537200005

However, just this reversible phase transition behaviors between lambda and beta phases made its high purity preparation be challenging, and the high energy consumption of present industrialized method also limited the high-level applications of beta-Ti3O5. In this work, a novel carbothermal reduction method has been acquired to produce highly pure beta-Ti3O5 compacts from titanium dioxide "wrapped" by phenolic resin served as carbon source. Their phase and microstructure evolutions during the whole reaction process were systematically characterized under the assistance of Rietveld refinement and SEM images. The highly active pyrolytic carbon of phenolic resin could deposit on the surface of TiO2 and this compacted state could promote the generated CO to accelerate the reaction process and decrease the addition of reductant, simultaneously. The reduction sequences were TiO2 -> Ti4O7 -> Ti3O5 -> Ti2O3. The weight ratio of phenolic to precursor of 9.0% could achieve the pure beta-Ti3O5 as high as 98.06% under the calcination temperature of 1250 degrees C for 4 h.

Herein, a bimetallic Ni-W catalyst fabricated by the rapid dehydration of W-doped Ni(OH)(2) is reported. The Ni-W surface exhibits the following merits for an enhanced alkaline HER: a greater number of vacant outer d-orbitals, better discharge characteristics, and a more significant difference in H adsorption between W and Ni atoms. The free water molecules are adsorbed onto W sites, then dissociated into *OH and *H. While *OH is released into the solution, *H is re-adsorbed by nearby Ni sites. The synergistic effect of the Ni-W surface sites imparts this catalyst with the highest activity and the best stability at high current density. Specifically, at a current density of 500 mA cm(-2), the Ni-W catalyst reduces the overpotential to 303 mV, compared with 409 mV for the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst. Additionally, the Ni-W catalyst exhibits better long-term stability than the state-of-the-art Pt/C. Whereas the Pt activity decreases by 181 mA cm(-2) after 31 h of testing at 500 mA cm(-2), the Ni-W loses only 55 mA cm(-2) under the same conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm the synergistic mechanism, which can be useful for general alkaline HER processes.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			2196-7350			WOS:000468810200020

Herein, we exhibit the preparation of nanoporous PtFe nanoparticles (np-PtFe NPs) supported on N-doped porous carbon sheets (NPCS) via facile in situ thermolysis of a Pt-modified Fe-based metal-organic framework (MOP). The np-PtFe/NPCS exhibit a more positive half-wave potential (0.92 V) compared with commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.883 V). The nanoporous structure allows our catalyst to possess high mass activity, which is found to be 0.533 A.mg(pt)(-1) and 3.04 times better than that of Pt/C (0.175 A.mg(pt)(-1)). Moreover, the conversion of PtFe NPs from porous to hollow structure can maintain the activity of electrocatalyst. Our strategy provides a facile design and synthesis process of noble transition metal alloy electrocatalysts via noble metal modified MOFs as precursors.									39	2	0	0	0	0	40			1944-8244			WOS:000411771400095	28841004

Herein, by means of large-scale density functional theory (DFT) computations, we reported a descriptor-based design principle to explore the large composition space of two-dimensional (2D) biatom catalysts (BACs), namely, metal dimers supported on 2D expanded phthalocyanine (M-2-Pc or MM'-Pc), toward the NRR at the acid conditions. We sampled both homonuclear (M-2-Pc) and heteronuclear (MM'-Pc) BACs and constructed the activity map of BACs by using N2H* adsorption energy as the activity descriptor, which reduces the number of promising catalyst candidates from over 900 to less than 100. This strategy allowed us to readily identify 3 homonuclear and 28 heteronuclear BACs, which could break the metal-based activity benchmark toward the efficient NRR. Particularly, using the free energy difference of H* and N2H* as a selectivity descriptor, we screened out five systems, including Ti2Pc, V-2-Pc, TiV-Pc, VCr-Pc, and VTa-Pc, which exhibit a strong capability of suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with favorable limiting potential of -0.75, -0.39, -0.74, -0.85, and -0.47 V, respectively. This work not only broadens the possibility of discovering more efficient BACs toward N-2 fixation but also provides a feasible strategy for rational design of NRR electrocatalysts and helps pave the way to fast screening and design of efficient BACs for the NRR and other electrochemical reactions.									317	23	0	0	11	0	317			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000526393100033	32068399

In constant to a dual-oxide-species (DOS) model in which the surface migration of adsorbed oxygen is not considered for Langmuir-type adsorption, the observed changes in work function due to the surface dipole layer mean that adsorbed oxygen can migrate on the surface more frequently with increasing temperature, leading to a decrease in the number of adsorbed oxygen atoms bonded at dimer backbond centers and furthermore a significant structural change of the oxide layer.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			0021-4922			WOS:000232318900004

Thus, from the atomic-scale engineering we develop a high intrinsic activity ORR catalyst in terms of incorporating atomically dispersed dual Fe centers (single Fe atoms and ultra-small Fe atomic clusters) into bamboo-like N-doped carbon nanotubes. Benefiting from atomically dispersed dual-Fe centers on the atomic interface of Fe-N-x/carbon nanotubes, the fabricated dual Fe centers catalyst exhibits an extremely high ORR activity (E-onset = 1.006 V; E-1/2 = 0.90 V), beyond state-of-the-art Pt/C. Remarkably, this catalyst also shows a superior kinetic current density of 19.690 mA.cm(-2), which is 7 times that of state-of-the-art Pt/C. Additionally, based on the excellent catalyst, the primary Zn-air battery reveals a high power density up to 137 mW.cm(-2) and sufficient potential cycling stability (at least 25 h). Undoubtedly, given the unique structure-activity relationship of dual-Fe active species and metal-nitrogen-carbon substrates, the catalyst will show great prospects in highly efficient electrochemical energy conversion devices.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000728291800002

Here, we report a heterogeneous WS2/WO2 electrocatalyst with abundant planar defects at the heterointerface ascribed to the strain effect induced by the mismatched lattice spacing between WS2 and WO2, which enables efficient electrocatalysis toward the NRR with a faradaic efficiency of 13.5% and an NH3 yield rate of 8.53 mu gNH(3) h(-1) mg(cat.)(-1) at -0.1 V vs. RHE in acidic medium compared to bare WS2 with a faradaic efficiency of 7.87% and an NH3 yield rate of 6.99 mu g(NH3) h(-1) mg(cat.)(-1). The superior NRR electrocatalytic activity of heterostructured WS2/WO2 is attributed to the introduction of WO2 effectively impeding the HER catalysis because of the blocking of edge defects in WS2 and simultaneously creating planar defects at the WS2/WO2 heterointerface as active sites for stable NRR catalysis. The extraordinary NRR electrocatalytic activity of WS2/WO2 is further confirmed by NMR measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demanding comparably lower uphill free energy for the rate-determining step of NRR catalysis, i.e. formation of NNH species. This work offers useful information for constructing efficient NRR electrocatalysts.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000546391600049

The polymer-Cu complex (PHTPP-Cu) was obtained by immersing the polymer modified electrode in copper sulfate solution. The PHTPP-Cu catalyst provides two types of active sites including pyridinic-N atoms and Cu-N-x-C units, and also has a high specific surface area and better conductive property. These excellent features facilitate the reduction of oxygen to water by the catalyst through a four-electron mechanism in the phosphate buffer solution (PBS). Be employed as the cathodic catalyst, PHTPP-Cu also exhibits excellent performance in microbial fuel cell (MFC), which was comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Such a polymer based catalyst providing a good opportunity for the preparation of low-cost non-noble metal ORR catalyst for fuel cell utilization. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Experimental studies on non-catalytic overlayers passivating the hematite surface states claim a favorable reduction in the overpotential for the water splitting reaction. As a first step towards understanding the effect of these overlayers, we have studied the system Ga2O3 overlayers on hematite (0001) surfaces using first principles computations in the PBE+U framework. Our computations suggest that stoichiometric terminations of Ga2O3 overlayers are energetically more favored than the bare surface, at ambient oxygen chemical potentials. Energetics suggest that the overlayers prefer to grow via a layer-plus-island (Stranski-Krastanov) growth mode with a critical layer thickness of 1-2 layers. Thus, a complete wetting of the hematite surface by an overlayer of gallium oxide is thermodynamically favored. We establish that the effect of deposition of the Ga2O3 overlayers on the bare hematite surface is to passivate the surface states for the stoichiometric termination. For the oxygen terminated surface which is the most stable termination under photoelectrochemical conditions, the effect of deposition of the Ga2O3 overlayer is to passivate the hole-trapping surface state.

For such technologies (MILD, LTC, etc.), working temperatures are enough low to boost the formation of several classes of pollutants, such as NOx and soot. To access this temperature range, a significant dilution as well as preheating of reactants is required. Such conditions are usually achieved by a strong recirculation of exhaust gases that simultaneously dilute and pre-heat the fresh reactants. However, the intersection of low combustion temperatures and highly diluted mixtures with intense pre-heating alters the evolution of the combustion process with respect to traditional flames, leading to significant features such as uniformity and distributed ignition. The present study numerically characterized the turbulence-chemistry and combustion regimes of propane/oxygen mixtures, highly diluted in nitrogen, at atmospheric pressure, in a cyclonic combustor under MILD Combustion operating conditions. The velocity and mixing fields were obtained using CFD with focus on mean and fluctuating quantities. The flow-field information helped differentiate between the impact of turbulence levels and dilution ones. The integral length scale along with the fluctuating velocity is critical to determine Damkohler and Karlovitz numbers. Together these numbers identify the combustion regime at which the combustor is operating. This information clearly distinguishes between conventional flames and distributed combustion. The results revealed that major controllers of the reaction regime are dilution and mixing levels; both are significantly impacted by lowering oxygen concentration through entrainment of hot reactive species from within the combustor, which is important in distributed combustion. Understanding the controlling factors of distributed regime is critical for the development and deployment of these novel combustion technologies for near zero emissions from high intensity combustors and energy savings using fossil and biofuels for sustainable energy conversion.

However, the oxidation of the TM would lead to the electronegativity difference between Pt and TM being much lowered, which induces a decrease in the number of electrons transferred from the TM to Pt, resulting in excessive oxygenated species accumulating on the surface of Pt, thus deteriorating their performance. In this work, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance of PtNi (Pt68Ni32) concave octahedral NPs (CONPs) in alkaline electrolytes is much improved by doping small amounts of phosphorus. The P-doped PtNi CONPs (P-PtNi) show about 2 and 10 times enhancement for ORR compared to PtNi and commercial Pt/C catalysts. The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy mapping characterizations reveal that the P dopant uniformly distributes throughout the CONPs, Pt mainly locates at the edges and corners, whereas Ni situates at the center, forming a P-doped Pt-frame@Ni quasi-core shell CONP. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectra indicate that the P dopant obviously increases the electron density of Pt compared with that of PtNi NPs, which contributes to the stabilization of the electronic structure of PtNi CONPs, thus restraining the excessive HO2- species produced on the catalysts, which endow them with a high catalytic performance in the ORR. In addition, the P attached to the Ni sites in the PtNi NPs partially prevents the Ni atoms being oxidized by the external O species, which is conducive to the structural and electrochemical stability of the PtNi NPs during the ORR. The present results provide a new insight into the development of ORR catalysts with low utilization of Pt.									44	2	0	0	2	0	42			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000442460400022	30040371

The as-prepared NiFe LDH/MoS2 composite (abbreviated as MNF) exhibits a low overpotential (eta(10)) of 190 mV; a low Tafel slope of 31 mV dec(-1); and more importantly, a high stability in its performance manifested by the delivery of current output for 45 h. It is important to note that this could be achieved with an exceedingly low loading of 0.14 mg cm(-2). The mass activity of this composite (97 A g(-1)) is about 14 times greater than that of the conventional RuO2 (7 A g(-1) ) at eta = 200 mV. When normalized with respect to the total metal content, a mass activity of 1000 A g(-1) (eta = 300 mV) was achieved. Impedance analysis further reveals that the significant reduction in charge-transfer resistance and hence high current density (5 times greater as compared to NiFe LDH at eta = 300 mV) observed for MNF is associated with interfacial adsorption kinetics of intermediates (R-1). Significant enhancement in the intrinsic activity of MNF over LDH has been observed through normalization of current with the electrochemically active surface area. Computational studies suggest that the Ni centers in the composite act as the active sites for OER, which is well-corroborated with the observed postreaction appearance of Ni3+ species.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000828576800001	35796762

Rational design of the Ru/C interface is expected to simultaneously decrease the free energy barrier of intermediate species and create a favorable electronic structure, effectively promoting the catalytic reaction kinetics of the CRR and CER. Herein, a 3D self-supporting cellulose carbon aerogel (CCA) with well-defined Ru/C interfaces (Ru@CCA) is synthesized as an advanced CO2-breathing cathode for Li-CO2 batteries. The results show that the energy efficiency significantly improves to 80% with a high discharge capacity of 10.71 mA h cm(-2) at 20 mu A cm(-2), and excellent cyclic stability of 421 cycles at 100 mu A cm(-2). These outstanding performances are highly competitive compared with state-of-art Li-CO2 cathodes. In addition, the unique interface design strategy is applied to other non-noble metal@CCA cathodes, which confirms the advantages of constructing nanostructure metal/C interfaces for improving the kinetics of CRR and CER. This fundamental understanding of the structure-performance relationship provides new inspiration for designing highly efficient cathode catalysts for Li-CO2 batteries.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000780439100001

By using a facile heating-electrodeposition method, here we fabricated a porous but crystalline Fe-doped Ni3S2. A thin porous surface NiFe hydroxide layer (similar to 10 nm) is then formed through OER-running. By virtue of the core Fe-doped Ni3S2 with good conductivity and the shell NiFe hydroxide surface with good electrocatalytic activity, the core-shell nanostructure on Ni foam exhibits excellent OER activity in 1 M NaOH, needing only 195 and 230 mV to deliver 10 and 100 mA/cm(2), respectively, much more superior to those of 216 and 259 mV for the sample deposited under normal temperature. The enhanced photo-response of the sulfide@hydroxide core-shell structure was also demonstrated, due to the efficient transfer of photo-generated carriers on the core/shell interface. More interestingly, it shows a good compatibility with Si based photoanode, which exhibits an excellent PEC performance with an onset potential of 0.86 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, an applied bias photon-to-current efficiency of 5.5% and a durability for over 120 h under AM 1.5 G 1 sun illumination, outperforming the state-of-the-art Si based photoanodes.

This study has two-pronged objectives: the first is to investigate the feasibility of titanium (Ti) and graphite felt (GF) coated with nickel (Ni), and the second is to generate hydrogen from the fermentation effluent (FE). The electrodeposition (ED) method was used to deposit Ni catalyst onto Ti (Ni/Ti) and GF (Ni/GF) surfaces. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy were used to characterize the cathode morphology and element composition. The catalytic properties of Ni/Ti and Ni/GF could be evaluated using the linear sweep voltammetry tests.

In this paper, we deliberately design molybdenum phosphosulfide nanoparticles anchored on the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and systematically study the correlation between structure/surface composition and the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity and stability. We discover that the HER activities show significant enhancement with the incorporation of P in the molybdenum disulfide structure (MoS2 vertical bar P/CNT) or Sin the molybdenum phosphide structure (MoP vertical bar S/CNT). The stability of the MoS2 vertical bar P/CNT catalyst exhibits high stability which is consistent with the pristine MoS2/CNT, while the stability of the MoP/CNT sample is enhanced after the introduction of the S element. The density function theory (OFT) results indicate that the doped P atoms in the MoS2 structure provide more enhanced active sites, leading to promoted HER activity. For the MoP vertical bar S/CNT samples, the doped S site is calculated to be less active for HER yet can greatly enhance P site to present better activity. The anion doping effect unveiled here provides insights into molybdenum phosphosulfides for HER and may also be expanded to broad catalyst design for energy related applications.

The usual immobilization of metal or metal oxide particles on semiconductor photocatalysts offers an uncontrolled assembly of active sites during the reaction. The introduction of single metal atoms on photocatalysts can lead to extremely high atomic utilization and precise active sites. However, this approach is limited because of the lack of suitable photosensitizers for single atom immobilization. Here, we have designed photocatalytic carbon quantum dots with anchoring sites for single cobalt atoms in a defined Co-N-4 structure via facile pyrolysis of vitamin B12. Carbon dots functioned as both light-harvesting antenna and support for the cobalt atom with high atom loadings up to 3.27 wt %. This new photocatalytic material demonstrated enhanced visible light absorption, efficient charge separation, and reduced electrochemical impedance, while single Co atoms acted as the active site with strong oxidative ability. As a result, the photocatalysts showed excellent visible light-promoted photocatalytic efficiency with oxygen evolution rates up to 168 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) via water oxidation, imine formation with high conversion (similar to 90%) and selectivity (>99%), and complete photodegradation of organic dyes.									52	8	0	0	7	0	53			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000510530500010

Here, we report a highly stable and efficient Ti/TiONC/Sb-SnO2 electrode, which was fabricated through hydrothermal reactions using urea to form TiONC interlayers and electrodeposition-annealing to coat the active SbSnO2 catalysts. The triple-layered anode was characterized by highly crystalline structures, high oxygen evolution potentials, and corrosion-resistance properties. The structural arrangement yielded better electrocatalytic performances than that using the control electrode (Ti/Sb-SnO2), showing enhanced organics degradation efficiencies. This new electrode's lifetime was significantly (similar to 25 times) longer than that of either the control or any Sb-SnO2 electrode modified with non-precious materials reported in the literature. The electrode's enhanced stability was attributed to the insertion of the mixed C and N interlayers that are resistant to oxidants and corrosive ions. The Ti/TiONC/Sb-SnO2 anode holds promise for use in electrochemical water treatment.									18	0	0	0	8	0	18			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000543713600087

We observe that all atoms are most stable (higher binding energy) on the top of a Si atom, which moves out of the plane (in the opposite direction to the adsorbed atom). Alkali atoms adsorbed give raise to two spin unpaired electronic levels inside the band gap leading the SiC single layer to exhibit n-type semiconductor properties. For alkaline atoms adsorbed there is a deep occupied spin paired electronic level inside the band gap. These finding suggest that the adsorption of alkaline and alkali-earth atoms on SiC layer is a powerful feature to functionalize two dimensional SiC structures, which can be used to produce new electronic, magnetic and optical devices as well for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (HER and OER, respectively). Furthermore, we observe that the adsorption of H-2 is ruled by dispersive forces (van der Waals interactions) while the O-2 molecule is strongly adsorbed on the functionalized system.

GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY				28	2			64	77		10.1111/geb.12847				JAN 2019	2019	Aim The negative correlation between temperature and body size of ectothermic animals (broadly known as the temperature-size rule or TSR) is a widely observed pattern, especially in aquatic organisms. Studies have claimed that the TSR arises due to decreased oxygen solubility and increasing metabolic costs at warmer temperatures, whereby oxygen supply to a large body becomes increasingly difficult. However, mixed empirical evidence has led to a controversy about the mechanisms affecting species' size and performance under different temperatures. We review the main competing genetic, physiological and ecological explanations for the TSR and suggest a roadmap to move the field forward. Location Global. Taxa Aquatic ectotherms. Time period 1980-present. Results We show that current studies cannot discriminate among alternative hypotheses and none of the hypotheses can explain all TSR-related observations. To resolve this impasse, we need experiments and field-sampling programmes that specifically compare alternative mechanisms and formally consider energetics related to growth costs, oxygen supply and behaviour. We highlight the distinction between evolutionary and plastic mechanisms, and suggest that the oxygen limitation debate should separate processes operating on short, decadal and millennial time-scales. Conclusions Despite decades of research, we remain uncertain whether the TSR is an adaptive response to temperature-related physiological (enzyme activity) or ecological changes (food, predation and other mortality), or a response to constraints operating at a cellular level (oxygen supply and associated costs). To make progress, ecologists, physiologists, modellers and geneticists should work together to develop a cross-disciplinary research programme that integrates theory and data, explores time-scales over which the TSR operates, and assesses limits to adaptation or plasticity. We identify four questions for such a programme. Answering these questions is crucial given the widespread impacts of climate change and reliance of management on models that are highly dependent on accurate representation of ecological and physiological responses to temperature.									69	0	0	0	57	0	69			1466-822X	1466-8238		WOS:000457789900001

This design considerably reduced the charge transfer and injection resistance, thus decreasing the recombination and improving the oxygen reaction kinetics. As a result, the rGO-ITO@Fe2O3 photo-anode yields a photocurrent up to 5.38 mA cm(-2) at 0.6 V (versus SCE), which is 3.5 times and 10 times of ITO@Fe2O3 and Fe2O3 in the same situation. The rGO-ITO@Fe2O3 photoanode also exhibits an excellent photoelectrochemical stability and there is no obvious degradation after 60 min. Our work has provided an efficient strategy to improve the energy conversion efficiency and life-time of water splitting materials. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A test bench for the treatment of diesel PM using an NTP injection system was constructed, and PM samples before and after NTP reaction were accumulated on filter papers. The apparent morphology, oxidative activity, surface functional groups, and soluble organic fractions (SOF) components of PM samples were investigated using modern techniques (i.e., SEM, TGA, FT-IR, and GC-MS). Results show that after NTP reactions, the amount of PM declined substantially and the surface stacking structure became relatively smooth; the proportion of SOF reduced and that of DS increased. Carbon atoms and functional groups on the edge or surface of the carbon layer were first oxidized by the NTP active substance (O-3, O) to form CO or CO2, causing carbon atoms to fall off the original bond and new oxygen-containing functional groups to be generated as intermediates. After the NTP reaction, the oxidation characteristic temperatures decreased and high-carbon-atom-number components were transformed into low-carbon-atom-number components. Results reveal that NTP can improve PM oxidizing activity and promote low-temperature combustion of PM; PM decomposition can be regarded as a process of constantly removing carbon atoms.									19	4	0	0	2	0	21			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000471841600125

Herein, we designed and synthesized a novel and efficient Ni3N@VN-NF composite by nitriding treatment of a NiV-LDH precursor. The obtained electrode exhibits superior performances including a much lower overpotential of 56 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel value of 47 mV dec(-1) compared to pure Ni3N-NF and VN-NF electrodes. The Ni3N@VN-NF composite as a cathode and a conventional OER electrode NiFe-LDH-NF as an anode were combined to form a complete water-splitting system. The voltage at 10 mA cm(-2) is about 1.55 V, which is superior to the voltage value reported in many literature studies. In addition, the two-electrode system exhibits excellent durability after as long as 50 hours of operation.									51	4	0	0	5	0	51			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463824300041

XRD, SEM, TEM, UV-Vis DRS and PL were adopted to analyze the effect of C-dots modification on the structure and properties of g-C3N4. Photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4/C-dotswas evaluated by the degradation ofmethyl orange (MO) under different conditions. The results show that C-dots can increase photocatalytic reaction rate of g-C3N4/C-dots composite under visible-light irradiation, especially in the presence of H2O2. C-dots act as electron-sinks, therefore preventing the recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs. Meanwhile, H2O2 not only acts as an oxygen-donor to make contribution to generation of O-2, but can directly react with the photo-generated electrons transferred from the conduction band of g-C3N4 to C-dots, leading to the formation of center dot OH active group, which promotes the degradation of MO. Therefore the photocatalytic activities of g-C3N4/C-dots can be improved significantly when adding H2O2 to the photocatalytic reaction system. (C) 2017 The Electrochemical Society.

Tuning precious metal structure to expose active sites is an effective strategy to reduce mass loading in the practical application. Herein, Pt-Co hollow nanospheres were synthesized via a sequential reduction strategy using amorphous Co-B-O complex as the key spheres-forming intermediates. The modulation mechanism of Pt-Co hollow nanospheres formation was established by investigating critical factors of addition sequence of reducing agent, the type of reducing agents and the ratio of Pt and Co precursors. The optimized Pt-Co hollow nanospheres with the Pt/Co molar ratio of 1:1 by this method is characterized by the average diameter of around 30 nm and the shell thickness of 2.3 nm. They displays superior performance for enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the aspect of activity and stability in 0.5 M H2SO4, in which the mass activity of the Pt-Co hollow spheres exhibits 2.82 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C and its stability also has a significant enhancement. The outstanding activity of the Pt-Co hollow nanospheres for HER is mainly attributed to its highly accessible electron/mass transport path, expose active sites on the ultra-thin shells and strain effect induced by the hollow sphere structure. This hollow nanospheres with ultra-thin shell provides a promising way to develop highly efficient precious metal based electrocatalysts. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, several natural organisms have been used as element sources to synthesize low-cost and environmentally friendly electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells and metal-air batteries, which are clean energy devices. However, to date, no naturally optimized smart structures have been employed in the synthesis of ORR catalysts, including graphene-based materials. Here, we demonstrate a novel strategy to synthesize graphene-graphite films (GGFs) by heating butterfly wings coated with FeCl3 in N-2, in which the full power of natural organisms is utilized. The wings work not only as an element source for GGF generation but also as a porous supporting structure for effective nitrogen doping, two-dimensional spreading, and double-face exposure of the GGFs. These GGFs exhibit a half-wave potential of 0.942 V and a H2O2 yield of < 0.07% for ORR electrocatalysis; these values are comparable to those for the best commercial Pt/C and all previously reported ORR catalysts in alkaline media. This two-in-one strategy is also successful with cicada and dragonfly wings, indicating that it is a universal, green, and cost-effective method for developing high-performance graphene-based materials.									27	3	0	0	0	0	28			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000453629900004

A novel efficient ZnWO4/CdS photocatalyst was fabricated with the significantly effective performance of photocatalytic H-2 evolution. The ZnWO4/CdS composites exhibit the promoting photocatalytic evolution activity of 792.7 mu mol/h and the outstanding stability in the following reactions of 12 h. The excellent photocatalytic performance of ZnWO4/CdS composites is mainly ascribed to the efficient separation of carriers and migration of electrons from CdS to ZnWO4 via their intimate contact interfaces. Moreover, the photocatalytic mechanism, which the analysis on XPS spectrum and radical-trapping experiments provide clues for is demonstrated to explicate the enhanced performance of the ZnWO4/CdS photo catalyst. This work provides a new design of ZnWO4/CdS photocatalysts for more efficient utilization of solar energy and some new perspectives for explicating the migration process of carriers.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			1010-6030			WOS:000487765700024

However, these devices suffer from irreversible side reactions leading to battery failure, especially when ambient air is used as the O-2 source, so a deep understanding over the surface chemistry evolution is imperative for building better devices. Herein, a multi-scale (nano-micro) FTIR analysis is made over the electrode surface during cell discharge employing synchrotron infrared nanospectroscopy (SINS) for the first time, to track the chemical composition changes at the nanoscale which are successfully correlated with in operando micro-FTIR characterization. The in situ results reveal homogeneous product distribution from the nano to the micro scale, and that the discharge rate does not interfere in chemical composition. In operando micro-FTIR shows the atmosphere dependency over Li products formation; the presence of HCOO- species occurring due to CO2 electroreduction in water, LiOH and Li2CO3, are also detected and even the lowest concentration of CO2 and H2O affects the O-2 reactions. Finally, evidence of the Li2O2 reaction with DMSO forming DMSO2 after just 140 s of cell discharge shows this new technique's relevance in aiding the search for stable electrolytes.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000707869200001

However, a few TM-Nx-C single-atom catalysts (SAC) are capable of reducing CO2 to multielectron products with high activity and selectivity. Herein, using density functional theory calculations, we investigated the electrocatalytic performance of a single TM atom embedded into a defective BCN nanosheet for CO2RR. The N and B atom co-coordinated TM center, namely, TM-B2N2, constructs a symmetry-breaking site, which strengthens the overlapping of atomic orbitals, and enables the linear CO2 to be curved and activated, compared to the weak coupling of CO2 with the symmetric TM-N-4 site. Moreover, the TM-B2N2 sites play a role of dual-atom active sites, in which the TM atom serves as the carbon adsorption site and the B atom acts as the oxygen adsorption site, largely stabilizing the key intermediates, especially *COOH. The symmetry-breaking coordination structures shift the d-band center of the TM atom toward the Fermi level and thus facilitate CO2 reduction to hydrocarbons and oxygenates. As a result, different from the TM-N-4-C structure that leads to CO as the major product, the Ni atom supported on BCN can selectively catalyze CO2 conversion into CH4, with an ultralow limiting potential of -0.07 V, while suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction. Our finding suggests that introduction of a nonmetal active site adjacent to the metal site provides a new avenue for achieving efficient multi-intermediate electrocatalytic reactions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000757848200001	35138796

In this paper, we investigate the reduction kinetics by diluted hydrogen of La2Mo2O9 to amorphous, and the oxygen range of the amorphous form. The reduction kinetics is studied as a function of the powder specific surface area and of the temperature, on powders synthesized by solid state reaction and by polyol process using two different solvents. The reduction process was carried out by TGA under 10% H-2 diluted in argon, and its kinetics is analyzed and modeled. As expected, small particles and high temperature lead to higher reduction rates. Several reduction steps were identified by XRD during the process. At 700 degrees C La2Mo2O9 is directly reduced into the amorphous phase La2Mo2O7-y, whereas at 760 degrees C reduction occurs through an intermediate crystallized La7Mo7O30 congruent to La2Mo2O8.57) phase before amorphization. In both cases, further reduction of La2Mo2O62 amorphous phase leads to an exsolution of metallic molybdenum and a molybdenum deficiency in the amorphous phase. Reoxidation of amorphous La2Mo2O7-y was studied by TGA, DTA and XRD. At low temperature in air, the reduced compounds are reoxidized while remaining amorphous. The annealing for 60 h at 350 degrees C in air of reduced La2Mo2O6.66, obtained beforehand by solid state reaction, gives an amorphous phase with composition La2Mo2O8.85. The existence domain of the reduced amorphous phase in terms of oxygen content therefore ranges at least from O-6.2 to O-8.85, thus including the composition La2Mo2O8.50 of the amorphous surface layer at the origin of a huge increase of ionic conductivity recently reported in nanowires of La2Mo2O9.									6	0	1	0	0	0	8			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000371753500063	26910206

The rate of corrosion was determined from time profile measurements of dissolved oxygen concentrations in a solution stream circulating in a closed loop through a tubular reactor containing the corroding specimen, and accessories to help intermittent oxygenation of the solution. The results showed that the corrosion process in distilled water followed first-order kinetics with respect to dissolved oxygen concentration. This kinetic expression was maintained after several hours of immersion before being affected by the oxide layer formed on the steel surface. In the presence of NaCl solutions the corrosion kinetic behavior was altered significantly not only by immersion time, but also by the dissolved oxygen concentration in the electrolyte. The experimental evidence is in agreement with known mechanisms of oxide transformation in contact with a metal surface.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0010-9312	1938-159X		WOS:000248630800002

However, the nature of the "host" cell and the mode of entry are subject to heavy debate. It is becoming clear that the mutual adaptation of a relatively simple, archaeal host and the endosymbiont has been the defining influence at the beginning of the eukaryotic lineage; however, many still resist such symbiogenic models. In part 1, it is posited that a symbiotic stage before uptake ("pre-symbiosis") seems essential to allow further metabolic integration of the two partners ending in endosymbiosis. Thus, the author argued against phagocytic mechanisms (in which the bacterium is prey or parasite) as the mode of entry. Such positions are still broadly unpopular. Here it is explained why. Evolutionary thinking, especially in the case of eukaryogenesis, is still dominated by anachronistic reasoning, in which highly derived protozoan organisms are seen as in some way representative of intermediate steps during eukaryotic evolution, hence poisoning the debate. This reasoning reflects a mind-set that ignores that Darwinian evolution is a fundamentally historic process. Numerous examples of this kind of erroneous reasoning are given, and some basic precautions against its use are formulated.

However, fine control of the amount of co-catalyst deposited on the electrode surface usually does not receive much attention, although it is an essential factor that crucially determines the efficiency of photoelectrodes. In this context, this study illustrates how the dark electrochemical characterization of co-catalyst-modified photoanodes may provide valuable information on the precise amount of electroactive co-catalyst present on the surface, facilitating our understanding of the manner in which co-catalysts work and paving the way for their optimization. For this purpose, ultrathin Ni(OH)(2) layers were deposited on either doped or pristine BiVO4 and FeVO4 photoanodes by a cost-effective and versatile chemical bath deposition method in which the deposition time allows to control the Ni(OH)(2) loading. The deposited Ni(OH)(2) is demonstrated to successfully catalyze the photoelectrochemical water oxidation process on both BiVO4 and FeVO4 electrodes, by improving the effective transfer of photogenerated holes from the semiconductor to solution. In fact, the electrocatalytic activity of the Ni(OH)(2)-modified photoanodes rapidly increases with the amount of deposited Ni(OH)(2) until an optimum value is reached equivalent to only 0.46 and 1.68 Ni(OH)(2) monolayers for BiVO4 and FeVO4 electrodes, respectively. Under these conditions, Ni(OH)(2) enhances the photocurrent generation by a factor of 2 for BiVO4 and of 1.2 for FeVO4 photoanodes in contact with slightly alkaline solutions. The small loadings of Ni(OH)(2) leading to an optimum photoanode behavior indicate that hole transfer is favored on vanadate active surface sites, which would also be the preferential sites for Ni(OH)(2) deposition. Additional amounts of co-catalyst deposited for longer times induce a drastic decrease in the photoelectrocatalytic activity due to charge recombination at the semiconductor/Ni(OH)(2) interface, probably enhanced by the low carrier mobility in Ni(OH)(2). On the other hand, this study demonstrates that the preparation of efficient photoanodes for oxygen evolution with an extremely small amount of co-catalyst through a facile and scalable method is possible.

Electrochemical water splitting is a new move toward H2 and O2 gas production. It can be used in sustainable and pollution-free energy conversion applications. In this work, Ti2O3-CeO2 nanocomposites were successfully synthesized with different molar ratios by facile hydrothermal method for electrochemical water oxidation. Mixed phase structure of Ti2O3-CeO2 nanocomposites was confirmed by X-ray diffraction spectra and well identified by highest peak of Ti2O3 in 2 theta values of 33.0 and CeO2 in 2 theta values of 28.5. The characteristic peaks from Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy further confirmed Ti2O3-CeO2 nanocomposite formation. Existence of multidimensional nanostructures such as nanoparticles and small nanocubes of Ti2O3-CeO2 nanocomposites were investigated by scanning electron microscope images. Mesoporous nature of Ti2O3-CeO2 nanocomposites was further analyzed by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis. The high surface area could benefit the Ti2O3-CeO2 nanocomposites with greatly improved oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. In three molar ratios, 1:3 M ratios of Ti2O3-CeO2 nanocomposites showed high catalytic action at overpotential of 244 mV. The best OER electrocatalyst was obtained by 1:3 M ratios of Ti2O3-CeO2 nanocomposites, which exhibited high current density and high specific capacitance values of 238 mA/g and 517 F/g, respectively. Therefore, Ti/Ce molar ratio played a crucial role in enhancing the OER performance.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0301-4797	1095-8630		WOS:000681105800004	34198173

The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) analysis and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area analysis. The photocatalytic performance of the samples was measured by the degradation of dye methylene blue (MB) and O-2 evolution under visible light irradiation. The results indicated that the couple of AgCl and GO could effectively enhance the photoactivity and stability in comparison with bare Ag3PO4. From the analysis, it can be inferred that GO sheets could accelerate the separation of electron hole pairs and also improve the light absorption ability in comparison with bare Ag3PO4 and AgCl/Ag3PO4. Additionally, an optimum amount of GO added in the composite was obtained. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, an excellent electrocatalyst of CoMoP nanosheet arrays grown on nickel foam (CoMoP NAs @NF) composite is constructed via a combination of hydrothermal and phosphating process for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). SEM and TEM characterizations indicate the composite has a unique three-dimension structure, where CoMoP nanosheets uniformly grow on NF substrate. Due to the unique structure and the synergetic effect between CoMoP nanosheet and bare NF, electrochemical tests suggest that the composite has an excellent HER performance with a low overpotential of only 24mV to achieve a current density of 10mAcm(-2) and Tafel slope of 44.6mVdec(-1). Moreover, a certain overpotential can be maintained at 10mAcm(-2) for over 20h, suggesting its superior stability. Considering its superior HER performance and stability, we envision that this composite could be a prospective substitute for non-noble-metal HER catalysts for practical applications.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000471289600018

It can be accomplished by the functionalization of the pristine electrode surface, hematite for instance with mesoscale elements such as Co3O4 results in the formation of Co3O4 flower like oriented aggregate (FLOA) in a small two pot hydrothermal solution deposition. These are formed in both the free standing form on an electronically conductive substrate such as fluorine doped tin oxide (A4) and in combination on top of Hematite (A3). This unique structure shows promising electrocatalytic performance in the presence of iron from Hematite and electrochemical stability. The morphology in A4 remains preserved even after 20- hour electrochemical operations while the morphology of hybrid counterpart (A3) transforms into dendritic microstructures after long- term electrochemical treatment (LTE). Both electrodes show a significant amount of hydrogen and oxygen evolution representing its water splitting capability with electrocatalytic effect. Also, electrocatalysts crystallographic structural development and compositional characteristics are studied. (C) 2017 The Electrochemical Society.

The photoanode consisted of a thin layer of silicon nanowires deposited on molybdenum and a platinum wire as the cathode was used. The prepared photo-anodes were stable up to 0.3 V against the saturated Ag/AgCl electrode without any signs of gaseous oxygen evolution. This photo-electrochemical system enhanced the nanoparticle formation during the illumination phase accompanied with lowering the external potential needed. The present results show that hydrogen in statu nascendi is formed during illumination of photoanode, which causes the formation of nanoparticles by reduction of metal salts. During the photo drive electrolysis, hydrogen is stored in/on forming nanoparticles. The size of nanoparticles can be determined by time and an external bias value inserted between the working and platinum electrodes in a classical three electrode system. It was confirmed that the formation of nanoparticles was limited by diffusional processes of hydrogen in statu nascendi in electrolyte, which is in agreement with literature.

Perovskitetype LaMnO3 nanoparticles were first synthesized via chemical precipitation, and the carbon support (Vulcan XC-72) was modified using graphitization, followed by HNO3 and ammonia treatments. The morphology and electronic states of the carbon black-LaMnO3 hybrid catalyst were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The loaded LaMnO3 particles featured rod-like, three bars-like, and bamboo rod-like structures and were homogeneously dispersed in the carbon matrix that featured a hollow spherical structure. At a sintering temperature of about 300 degrees C, C-O-M (M = La, Mn) bonds formed at the interface between the carbon and LaMnO3 nanoparticles. Electrochemical measurements in 1 mol/L NaOH showed that the carbon-LaMnO3 hybrid prepared at a LaMnO3/GCB mass ratio of 2:3 displayed the highest electrocatalytic activity towards ORR among all the synthesized hybrid catalysts. The electrocatalytic activity was comparable with that obtained by commercial Pt/C catalyst (E-TEK). The average electron transfer number of ORR was similar to 3.81, and the corresponding yield of the hydrogen peroxide intermediate was similar to 9.5%. The remarkably improved electrocatalytic activity towards ORR was likely because of the formation of covalent bonds (C-O-M) between the LaMnO3 nanoparticles and carbon that can effectively enhance the ORR kinetics. This information is important to understand the physical origin of the electrocatalytic activity of carbon-supported rare earth oxides as catalysts for ORR.

The structural and morphological details of the synthesized samples were determined by employing X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. These studies revealed the formation of well-dispersed nano-Co3O4 particles with sizes, shapes, and crystallinity levels that differed for the different decomposition temperatures. The prepared catalysts were immobilized on filter-paper-derived carbon electrodes for checking their electrochemical properties. The electrochemical efficiency levels of the Co3O4 catalyst samples were evaluated by employing each of them as an anode to study the water oxidation reaction. The nano-Co3O4 sample prepared at 420 degrees C yielded the highest efficiency and good stability towards the water oxidation reaction. The higher efficiency of this sample was attributed to the relatively small average size and low level of agglomeration of its nanoparticles, and to the high electrochemically active surface area of its electrode.[GRAPHICS].									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000459178400002

Herein, the in situ growth of Mo-containing MOFs was achieved on three-dimensional (3D) nickel foam (NF) through the conversion of pre-deposited bimetal hydroxide/oxide nanosheets (Mo and Co). After pyrolysis, ultrafine Mo carbide nanoparticles encapsulated in cobalt and nitrogen-doped carbon layers were obtained. The ultrafine metal carbide nanoparticles favored the exposure of active sites, the in situ growth enhanced the binding between catalysts and substrate, and the cobalt and nitrogen-doped carbon layer facilitated charge transfer. The MoxC electrode showed a current of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 33.5 mV under alkaline conditions, which was 6 mV lower than that of the 20% Pt/C/NF electrode. The WxC electrode was also prepared. This work highlights a novel universal strategy to synthesize metal carbide electrodes.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000669578100001

Its outstanding visible-light driven hydrogen evolution and its excellent H-2 storage ability have been examined and confirmed. The formation of oxygen vacancies by surface defect creates the Ni3+ and Ti3+ on the interface of the heterostructure induce the efficient H-2 evolution, benchmarked by 1200% enhancement in catalytic performance. The underlying chemistries include the near-unity occupancy of e(g) orbital (t(2g)(6) e(g)(1)) of Ni3+ which speeds up the electron transfer and significantly promote the excellent electron-hole separation efficiency, establishes the outstanding overall charge-transfer efficiency and long-term photocatalytic activity in the visible light spectrum. Multiple Ti3+ adsorption centers in the structure attract multiple intact H-2 molecules per each center via a sigma - pi bonding motif - namely the Kubas interaction - which leads to 480% higher H-2 adsorption capability against the performance of the pristine mesoporous TiO2. Not only the significant results, the study also provide an air-stable synthetic method on the basis of low-cost and abundant materials, which are strongly favoured for scaling up production.									15	0	0	0	5	0	15			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000540457100011

Herein, we have devised a new, one-phase strategy for achieving heavy Ag-doping in Au-25(SR)(18) nanoclusters. This strategy overcomes the light doping of silver by previous methods. X-ray crystallography together with ESI-MS determined the composition of the product to be [AgxAu25-x(SC6H11)(18)](-) with x similar to 21. Cryogenic optical spectroscopy (80-300 K) revealed fine features in optical absorption peaks. Interestingly, the heavy doping of silver does not significantly change the electron-phonon coupling strength and the surface phonon frequency. DFT simulations reproduced the experimentally observed trend of electronic structure evolution with Ag doping. We further investigated the electrocatalytic performance of such heavily Ag-doped nanoclusters for oxygen reduction in alkaline solutions. The mass activity of ligand-off [AgxAu25-x(SC6H11)(18)](-) nanoclusters (217.4 A g(metal)(-1)) was determined to be higher than that of ligand-on nanoclusters (29.6 A g(metal)(-1)) at a potential of -0.3 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The rotating disk electrode (RDE) studies revealed the tunable kinetic features of the nanoclusters by ligand removal.									34	1	0	0	3	0	34			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000418098000022	29186224

Unlike the acid soluble metals (such as Fe, Co, Ni), the resultant W/BrN has successfully inherited the excellent corrosion resistance from pure metallic W, particularly in proton exchange membrane compatible acid electrolytes. However, more importantly, the W/BrN develops some outstanding electrochemical properties, such as enhanced electrical conductivity, optimized electronic properties, and large turnover frequency (TOF), after codoping with Br and N. Hence, the HER performance of W/BrN was higher by several orders of magnitude in current density than that of pure metallic W. To attain current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the W/BrN only needs overpotentials of 148, 190 and 94 mV in acidic, neutral and alkaline conditions, respectively. In addition, we investigated the long-term stability of W/BrN in three electrolytes.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000408592900013

The first model involves adsorption of monomers onto single empty sites, and we the second involves dissociative adsorption of dimers onto diagonally adjacent empty sites, where adsorption in both models occurs subject to the constraint that no adjacent pairs of occupied sites can be created. These adsorption processes produce adlayers comprised of disordered 'checkerboard' or c(2 x 2) domains, adsorption continuing until a non-equilibrium 'jammed' state is reached where no further space is available for adsorption. We focus on characterizing the evolution from this jammed state as a result of slow surface diffusion, or slow desorption (or reaction) processes. These relaxation processes open up further adsorption sites which are immediately filled in the presence of continued adsorption. In all cases, evolution involves Lifshitz-Cahn-Allen-type coarsening of the c(2 x 2) domains. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

A model, based on a set of partial differential equation describing the distribution of temperature and species concentrations and their evolution with time has been developed. Numerous experiments, both in static and dynamic modes, have been carried out in order to validate the model. They have notably allowed the identification of the oxidation kinetics, which is governed by the diffusion into the oxide layer and represented by Jander's model. The activation energy has been set at 97.5 kJ mol(-1). The experimental minimum ignition temperature of pure zirconium has been determined to be 213 degrees C, whereas the model leads to a value of 210 degrees C. It has also shown a good agreement with the tests performed both in static and dynamic modes at various alumina concentrations ranging from 0 to 90 wt.%. The average deviation obtained is 3.5%, which confirms the adequacy of the model. In static mode, a threshold-like behavior has been observed with a threshold level as high as 85 wt.%, whereas a more progressive increase has been obtained for the dynamic heating mode. A parametric study including especially the influences of layer porosity, oxygen partial pressure and layer dimensions has notably demonstrated the importance of the thermal effusivity and of the oxidation kinetics. The limitation due to the oxygen diffusion being predominant, the chemical reactions between nitrogen and zirconium could not be neglected in the lower part of the dust layers. This model allows a good visualization of the ignition process. Thus, it enables the estimation of the ignition delay and temperature, parameters which are essential to evaluate quantitatively the ignition risk of such powders and to propose adequate prevention and protection means.

However, the methods used to synthesize it require high pressure/temperature and/or hazardous/costly reagents. Here we propose Vo introduction, concomitant with N doping in TiO2, as an alternative strategy for achieving efficient co-catalyst-free solar photocatalytic activity under less extreme conditions. After calcination at 450 degrees C of mesoporous spherical assemblies of a layered titanate nanosheet containing N,N-dimethylformamide as its synthesis solvent in the structure, we successfully synthesized mesoporous spherical assemblies of nanosheets composed of anatase TiO2 nanoparticles with Vo mediated by N doping. This material exhibits good co-catalyst-free solar photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution via water splitting under irradiation with simulated solar light, which is considerably higher than that of typical co-catalyst-free defective TiO2 materials. We discuss the possible role of the introduced Vo in facilitating charge separation and raising photocatalytic efficiency.									48	5	1	0	6	1	50			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000623245900003

However, the period four oscillations of the fluorescence yield detected 1 s after a strong flash (in the P(680)Q(A) state) have not yet been fully explained.									29	0	0	0	22	0	29			0166-8595			WOS:000178321400022	16245118	
J	Cummins, Peter L.; Kannappan, Babu; Gready, Jill E.								Directions for Optimization of Photosynthetic Carbon Fixation: RuBisCO's Efficiency May Not Be So Constrained After All								FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE				9						183	10.3389/fpls.2018.00183				MAR 1 2018	2018	The ubiquitous enzyme Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (RuBisCO) fixes atmospheric carbon dioxide within the Calvin-Benson cycle that is utilized by most photosynthetic organisms. Despite this central role, RuBisCO's efficiency surprisingly struggles, with both a very slow turnover rate to products and also impaired substrate specificity, features that have long been an enigma as it would be assumed that its efficiency was under strong evolutionary pressure. RuBisCO's substrate specificity is compromised as it catalyzes a side-fixation reaction with atmospheric oxygen; empirical kinetic results show a trend to tradeoff between relative specificity and low catalytic turnover rate. Although the dominant hypothesis has been that the active-site chemistry constrains the enzyme's evolution, a more recent study on RuBisCO stability and adaptability has implicated competing selection pressures. Elucidating these constraints is crucial for directing future research on improving photosynthesis, as the current literature casts doubt on the potential effectiveness of site-directed mutagenesis to improve RuBisCO's efficiency. Here we use regression analysis to quantify the relationships between kinetic parameters obtained from empirical data sets spanning a wide evolutionary range of RuBisCOs. Most significantly we found that the rate constant for dissociation of CO2 from the enzyme complex was much higher than previous estimates and comparable with the corresponding catalytic rate constant. Observed trends between relative specificity and turnover rate can be expressed as the product of negative and positive correlation factors. This provides an explanation in simple kinetic terms of both the natural variation of relative specificity as well as that obtained by reported site directed mutagenesis results. We demonstrate that the kinetic behaviour shows a lesser rather than more constrained RuBisCO, consistent with growing empirical evidence of higher variability in relative specificity. In summary our analysis supports an explanation for the origin of the tradeoff between specificity and turnover as due to competition between protein stability and activity, rather than constraints between rate constants imposed by the underlying chemistry. Our analysis suggests that simultaneous improvement in both specificity and turnover rate of RuBisCO is possible.									27	2	0	0	17	0	28			1664-462X			WOS:000426364700001	29545812

In particular, we have generated a thermodynamically unstable but catalytically promising nitrogen-rich phase of tungsten via a hydrothermal generation of a tungsten oxide intermediate and subsequent annealing in ammonia. The net product consisted of three-dimensional (3D) micron-scale flower-like motifs of W2N3; this architecture not only evinced high structural stability but also incorporated the favorable properties of constituent two-dimensional nanosheets. From a performance perspective, as-prepared 3D W2N3 demonstrated promising hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities, especially in an acidic environment with a measured overpotential value of -101 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). To further enhance the electrocatalytic activity, small amounts of precious metal nanoparticles (such as Pt and Au), consisting of variable sizes, were uniformly deposited onto the underlying 3D W2N3 motifs using a facile direct deposition method; these composites were applied towards the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). A highlight of this series of experiments was that Au/W2N3 composites were found to be a much more active HER (as opposed to either a CO2RR or a methanol oxidation reaction (MOR)) catalyst.									11	2	0	0	0	0	11			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000536754100027

To ascertain the correlation between lattice/oxygen vacancy defects and microwave absorption properties (MWAPs), we herein developed a one-pot hydrothermal reaction to controllably synthesize Fe/Co/Ni-doped CeOHCO3 laminated dendrites as defects steered wide-frequency absorbers for the first time. The crucial effect of dopants on their MWAPs has been investigated based on the morphology, composition, and defect features. Fe/Co/Ni doping restricts the growth of CeOHCO3 nanosheets along the [1100], [0110], and [1010] directions, causing the morphology evolution from laminated dendrites to spherical aggregates. Meanwhile, the increase of lattice/ oxygen vacancy defects with Fe doping amount causes a linear increase in Ms and conductivity. Such changes improve the impedance matching and attenuation ability of CeOHCO3 owing to the enhanced permeability and multiple polarizations. The optimal comprehensive MWAPs are achieved by 10%Fe-doped CeOHCO3 laminated dendrites with an RLmax of -47.22 dB at 2.4 GHz and an EABmax/d of 3.47 GHz/mm, much superior to those of most other absorbers. Our work not only enlightens the precise defect modulation in dielectric-type absorbers via metal atomic doping but creates a new research methodology to develop advanced microwave absorbents.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000801845500002

However, pore blockage, cathode passivation and degradation all result in low discharge rates and poor cycling capability. To get rid of these predicaments, a novel highly conductive dual pore carbon aerogel based air cathode is fabricated to construct a lithium-air battery, which exhibits 18 to 525 cycles in the LiTFSI/sulfolane electrolyte at a current density varying from 1.00 mA cm(-2) to 0.05 mA cm(-2), accompanied by a high energy efficiency of 78.32%. We postulate that the essence lies in that the as-prepared air cathode inventively create a suitable tri-phase boundary reaction zone, facilitating oxygen and Li+ diffusion in two independant pore channels, thus realizing a relative higher discharge rate capability, lower pore blockage and cathode passivation. Further, pore structure, carbon loading, rate capability, discharge depth and the air's effect are exploited and coordinated, targeting for a high power and reversible lithium-air battery. Such nano-porous carbon aerogel air cathode of novel dual pore structure and material design is expected to be an attractive alternative for lithium-air batteries and other lithium based batteries.

Here we demonstrate the electronic synergy of neighboring Ir and Ni diatomic sites on carbon supports (IrNi-N-C) for promoting the hydrogen evolution. The catalyst exhibits superior catalytic activity with low overpotentials (28 and 45 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and high turnover frequencies (TOFs, 3.06 and 1.40 H-2 s(-1) at 50 mV) in acidic and alkaline electrolytes, respectively. Theoretical and experimental results suggest that the incorporation of adjacent Ni-N-4 moiety increases the occupancy of Ir 5d orbitals and shifts the d-band center down in the IrNi-N-C catalyst, thus facilitating the catalytic process by the optimal intermediate binding energy. This work highlights the significance of Ni 3d-Ir 5d electronic coupling between neighboring single metal sites for catalytic activity, and paves a way for the SACs design by manipulating d-d electronic interaction except for tuning of the coordination ligands and the electronic metal-support interactions.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000799796900002

All children (33 months +/- 35 DS) discharged from the Pediatric Unit of Itigi Hospital, Tanzania, with a diagnosis of CAP from August 2014 to April 2015 were enrolled. Clinical data were gathered. Dried blood spot (DBS) samples for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for bacterial detection were collected in all 100 children included. Twenty-four percent of patients were identified with severe CAP and 11% died. Surprisingly, 54% of patients were admitted with a wrong diagnosis, which increased complications, the need for antibiotics and chest X-rays, and the length of hospitalization. Comorbidity, found in 32% of children, significantly increased severity, complications, deaths, need for chest X-rays, and oxygen therapy. Malnourished children (29%) required more antibiotics. Microbiologically, Streptococcus pneumonia (S. p.), Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. a.) were the bacteria more frequently isolated. Seventy-five percent of patients had mono-infection. Etiology was not correlated with severity, complications, deaths, oxygen demand, or duration of hospitalization. Our study highlights that difficult diagnoses and comorbidities negatively affect clinical evolution. S. p. and Hib still play a large role; thus, implementation of current vaccine strategies is needed. DBS is a simple and efficient diagnostic method for bacterial identification in countries with scarce resources.									9	0	0	0	2	7	15				1422-0067		WOS:000396253700152	28335406

Mass spectrometry was used to measure O-2 uptake and evolution together with CO2 uptake in leaves of French bean and maize at CO2 concentrations saturating for photosynthesis and the CO2 compensation point. In French bean at high CO2 and low O-2 concentrations no significant water-water cycle activity was observed. At the CO2 compensation point and 3% O-2 a low rate of water-water cycle activity was observed, which accounted for 30% of the linear electron flux from water. In maize leaves negligible water-water cycle activity was detected at the compensation point. During induction of photosynthesis in maize linear electron flux was considerably greater than CO2 assimilation, but no significant water-water cycle activity was detected. Miscanthus x giganteus grown at chilling temperature also exhibited rates of linear electron transport considerably in excess of CO2 assimilation; however, no significant water-water cycle activity was detected. Clearly the water-water cycle can operate in leaves under some conditions, but it does not act as a major sink for excess excitation energy when CO2 assimilation is restricted.									91	2	0	0	86	1	93			0140-7791	1365-3040		WOS:000289168600012	21332508

Owing to their unique physicochemical properties, perovskite oxide materials are one of the most promising water oxidation (OER) catalysts solely comprising earth-abundant elements. Nonetheless, many perovskite oxide catalysts suffer from a number of inherent problems such as the A-site cation segregation on the surface, coarse particles due to agglomeration/sintering, and surface decomposition during catalytic reactions. Besides, the catalytic activity is often incomparable with those of the state-of-the-art catalysts. In this work, we developed a proton-assisted approach to mitigate these common challenges. The protonation via the interaction of oxygen vacancies and water molecules induced the formation of protonic defects and the lattice expansion of the perovskite, leading to the fracture of big particles to yield small nanoparticles. This hydration in an acidic solution also selectively removed the A-site cation segregates and generated a spinel/perovskite heterostructure on the surface. We verified this approach using three typical perovskite OER catalysts including Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF), La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3 (LSCF), and La0.75Sr0.25MnO3 (LSM). The processed catalysts showed much improved activity while maintaining their excellent stability, surpassing most of today's OER catalysts based on complex oxides.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000651750000107	33909406

The PSII which had been depleted of the extrinsic 17- and 23-kDa polypeptides, was obtained by exposing the solution to a high concentration of NaCl, and the complex of PSII-La3+ was prepared by treatment with LaCl3. The result indicated that La3+ could inhibit the oxygen-evolution activity of PSII by replacing the Ca2+. The local structural environment of La in PSII has been also studied by using extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). The primary result of EXAFS indicated that La coordinated with eight oxygen and/or nitrogen atoms, with the distance of the La-O/N bond being 2.5 Angstrom. In addition, La coordinated with four carbon atoms, with a distance of 3.5 Angstrom in the second shell. In the third shell, La coordinated with two manganese atoms, with the distance of La-Mn bond being 4.49 Angstrom, and it was also found that the La-Mn distance (4.49 A) was longer than that of Ca-Mn (3.3.Angstrom) (1) in PSII.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			0163-4984			WOS:000171653500020	11697771

Cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), Tafel curve, and chronoamperometry (i-t) were performed to investigate electrochemical performance of as-prepared spinel catalysts. The results showed that NiCo0.8Fe1.2O4 exhibited distinct redox peaks and the larger CV area (626.2 +/- 0.03 mu V A cm(-2)), lower Rct (42.42 +/- 0.03 Omega) and Tafel slope (21 mV dec(-1)) than that of pristine NiFe2O4 and NiCo2O4, signifying Co-doped NiFe2O4 is beneficial to accelerate the catalytic oxidation of glycerol. Moreover, the ECSA and stability of NiCo0.8Fe1.2O4 were also observably improved. This excellent performance is comparable to that of commercial Pt/C (20 wt.%)-SA. The enhanced electrocatalytic property of NiCo0.8Fe1.2O4 is ascribed to the uneven distribution of oxygen in NiFe2O4 structure caused by Co doping, thus forming oxygen defect sites.

Fe-boosting carbonization of CPFs with abundant Sn species (Sn-CPFs) resulted into the formation of FeSn2@FeSnOx nanoparticles encapsulated in thin sulphur and nitrogen doped carbon shells (FeSn2@FeSnOx@S-N-C). These unique dual-shell nanostructures embedding in S-N-doped porous carbons were among the best Sn-based ORR electro catalysts in both alkaline and acidic media. Its ORR half-wave potentials reached 0.88 V in 0.1 M KOH and 0.79 V in HClO4 electrolytes, together with long-time ORR durability. Moreover, FeSn2@FeSnOx@S-N-C-900 catalyst demonstrated a peak power density of 64.5 mW cm(-2) in the Zn-air batteries, comparable to the Pt/C-based counterpart (about 61.0 mW cm(-2)). The special Fe-boosting Sn-based dual-shell nanostructures greatly contributed to high ORR performance of this catalyst. The reported synthesis opens up a feasible route to obtain high-efficiency ORR cathode materials from p-block metals. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the activity and the modification strategy of the catalytic properties have not been firmly established yet. In this study, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the stability and HER performance of functionalized Mo2C MXene. The Pourbaix diagram indicates the fully oxidized surface is the most stable state. The oxidized Mo(2)CO(2)is electrically conductive, yet the surface HER activity is unsatisfactory owing to the strong first H adsorption. The doping of transition metals (TM) into the Mo lattice, however, leads to much more enhanced H adsorption and deteriorates the activity. Alternatively, the H binding can be effectively weakened and flexibly tuned by anchoring the TM atoms over the surface with appropriate coverage, and Mn/Fe decoration at 12.5 % ML (monolayer) coverage is identified as the promising candidates with close to zero Gibbs free energy of H adsorption (Delta G(H*)) for the first H adsorption. The weakening effect arises from charge transfer from TM to surface O, resulting in increased occupancy and weakened O-H bonds. Furthermore, contrary to the weakening effect, the tensile strain leads to enhanced O-H binding by the up-shifted Opelectronic states, which can further modulate the HER performance of TM-modified Mo2CO2. The synergistic effect between TM modification and strain engineering offers beneficial advantages for the realization of efficient electrochemical HER, which can be applied to other MXenes for electronic and catalytic applications.									18	1	0	0	0	0	18			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000575095900001	32959977

The paper considers the application of Raman and IR (infrared) Fourier spectroscopy for revealing the mechanisms of simultaneous dissolution and relative contents of N, C, O, and H in glasses, which represent the quench products of reduced model FeO-Na2O-Al2O3-SiO2 melts after experiments at 4 GPa, 1550A degrees C, and fO(2) 1.5-3 orders of magnitude below the oxygen fugacity of the iron-wustite buffer equilibrium (fO(2)(IW)). Such fO(2) values correspond to those inferred for the origin and evolution of magma ocean. It was established that the silicate melt contains complexes with N-H bonds (NH3, NH2+ , NH2- ), N-2, H-2, and CH4 molecules, as well as oxidized hydrogen species (OH- hydroxyl and molecular water H2O). Spectral characteristics of the glasses indicate significant influence of fO(2) on the N-C-O-H proportion in the melt. They are expressed in a sharp decrease of NH2+ , NH2- (O-NH2), OH-, H2O, and CH4 and simultaneous increase of NH2- ( Si-NH2) and NH3 with decreasing fO(2). As a result, NH3 molecules become the dominant nitrogen compounds among N-C-H components in the melt at fO(2) two orders of magnitude below fO(2)(IW), whereas molecular CH4 prevails at higher fO(2). The noteworthy feature of the redox reactions in the melt is stability of the OH- groups and molecular water, in spite of the sufficiently low fO(2). Our study shows that the composition of reduced magmatic gases transferred to the planet surface has been significantly modified under conditions of self-oxidation of mantle and magma ocean.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0016-7029	1556-1968		WOS:000392198300006

The initial reaction of photosynthesis takes place in photosystem II (PSII), a 700-kilodalton homodimeric membrane protein complex that catalyses photo-oxidation of water into dioxygen through an S-state cycle of the oxygen evolving complex (OEC). The structure of PSII has been solved by X-ray diffraction (XRD) at 1.9 angstrom resolution, which revealed that the OEC is a Mn4CaO5-cluster coordinated by a well defined protein environment(1). However, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) studies showed that the manganese cations in the OEC are easily reduced by X-ray irradiation(2), and slight differences were found in the Mn-Mn distances determined by XRD1, EXAFS(3-7) and theoretical studies(8-14). Here we report a 'radiation-damage-free' structure of PSII from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus in the S-1 state at a resolution of 1.95 angstroms using femtosecond X-ray pulses of the SPring-8 angstrom compact free-electron laser (SACLA) and hundreds of large, highly isomorphous PSII crystals. Compared with the structure from XRD, the OEC in the X-ray free electron laser structure has Mn-Mn distances that are shorter by 0.1-0.2 angstroms. The valences of each manganese atom were tentatively assigned as Mn1D(III), Mn2C(IV), Mn3B(IV) and Mn4A(III), based on the average Mn-ligand distances and analysis of the Jahn-Teller axis on Mn(III). One of the oxo-bridged oxygens, O5, has significantly longer distances to Mn than do the other oxo-oxygen atoms, suggesting that O5 is a hydroxide ion instead of a normal oxygen dianion and therefore may serve as one of the substrate oxygen atoms. These findings provide a structural basis for the mechanism of oxygen evolution, and we expect that this structure will provide a blueprint for the design of artificial catalysts for water oxidation.									824	25	1	0	323	0	837			0028-0836	1476-4687		WOS:000347178400043	25470056

Isolated single atom (ISA) catalysts have sparked tremendous interests in electrocatalysis due to their maximized atom utilization efficiency. Nevertheless, the fabrication of ISA catalysts remains a grand challenge. Here, a template-assisted approach is demonstrated to synthesize isolated Fe single atomic sites anchoring on graphene hollow nanospheres (denoted as Fe ISAs/GHSs) by using Fe phthalocyanine (FePc) as Fe precursor. The rigid planar macrocycle structure of FePc molecules and the steric-hindrance effect of graphene nanospheres are responsible for the dispersion of Fe-N-x species at an atomic level. The combination of atomically dispersed Fe active sites and highly steady hollow substrate affords the Fe ISAs/GHSs outstanding ORR performance with enhanced activity, long-term stability, and better tolerance to methanol, SO2, and NOx in alkaline medium, outperforming the state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C catalyst. This work highlights the great promises of cost-effective Fe-based ISA catalysts in electrocatalysis and provides a versatile strategy for the synthesis of other single metal atom catalysts with superior performance for diverse applications.									68	6	0	0	2	0	69				2198-3844		WOS:000456385900004	30693179

Here, by using density functional theory calculations, we suggest a novel 2D TlPt2S3 material whose layered bulk counterpart was synthesized in 1973. Theoretical calculation results indicate that the exfoliating energy of monolayer and bilayer TlPt2S3 is 34.96 meV angstrom(-2) and 36.03 meV angstrom(-2). We systematically studied the electronic and optical properties of monolayer and bilayer TlPt2S3, and revealed that they are indirect band gap semiconductors with band gaps of 2.26 eV and 2.10 eV, respectively. Monolayer and bilayer TlPt2S3 exhibit superior carrier mobility (901.63 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) and 13635.04 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) for electron mobility of the monolayer and bilayer, respectively) and photocatalytic performance (as high as 1 x 10(5) light absorption coefficient in the visible light region). Interestingly, we find that monolayer TlPt2S3 has significant hydrogen evolution performance, while in the bilayer, the electron band distribution shows complete oxygen evolution ability, which indicates that the proposed monolayer and bilayer TlPt2S3 are potential novel 2D materials suitable for photocatalytic water splitting driven by visible light.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000770046700001	35297434

The well-recognized properties of cerium oxide materials regarding improved oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) were utilized towards the synthesis of stable catalytic systems. The iron-cerium oxide solid solution catalysts with an Fe dopant content from 1% up to 15% were successfully synthesizedviaa co-precipitation method and calcined at 873 K. It was confirmed by XRD and Raman characterization that all samples featured a single cerianite crystalline phase with periodic lattice Ce ions substituted by Fe ions, with no hematite phase identified. Initial screening of catalytic behavior showed that the propane ODH pathway was enhanced at high Fe/Ce ratio while propane cracking was suppressed. Stable propane conversion and propylene selectivity for up to 20 hours were achieved for the synthesized catalysts with moderate Fe loading.Ex situRaman, XPS and STEM were applied to analyze post-reaction catalysts and confirmed that deactivation occurring over low Fe catalysts resulted from coke deposition on the surface, while CeO(2)sintering and Fe migration to form nanocrystals were the primary deactivation reasons for high Fe loading catalysts.									15	2	0	0	0	0	15			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000547719400018

The role of light in determining the profile of Rubisco, glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, catalase, fumarase, and cytochrome-c-oxidase across spinach leaves was examined by exposing leaves to illumination on either the adaxial or abaxial leaf surfaces. Oxygen evolution in fresh paradermal leaf sections and CO2 gas exchange in whole leaves under adaxial or abaxial illumination was also examined. The results showed that the palisade mesophyll is responsible for the midday depression of photosynthesis in spinach leaves. The photosynthetic apparatus was more sensitive to the light environment than the respiratory apparatus. Additionally, examination of the paradermal leaf sections by optical microscopy allowed us to describe two new types of parenchyma in spinach-pirum mesophyll and pillow spongy mesophyll. A hypothesis that oxaloacetate may protect the upper leaf tissue from the destructive influence of active oxygen is presented. The application of mathematical modeling shows that the pattern of enzymatic distribution across leaves abides by the principle of maximal ecological utility.

J., Hankamer, B., Bald. D., Kruip, J., Nield, J., Boonstra, A. F., Barber, J. & Rogner. M. (1995) Proc, Natl Alcan. Sci. USA 92, 175-179]. This PSII-LHCII SC bound the 33-kDa subunit of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC), but lacked the 33-kDa and 17-kDa subunits of the OEC. Herl the isolation procedure was modified by adding 1 M glycine betaine (1-carboxy-N,N,N-trimethylmethanaminium hydroxide inner salt) to the sucrose gradient mixture. This procedure yielded PSII-LHCII SC that contained both the 33-kDa and the 23-kDa subunits and had twice the oxygen-evolving capacity of the super complexes lacking the 23-kDa polypeptide. Addition of CaCl2 to PSII-LHCII SC with the 23-kDa subunit attached did not increase the oxygen-evolution rate. This suggests that the 23-kDa subunit is bound in a functional manner and is present in significant amounts. Over 5000 particle projections extracted from electron microscope images of negatively stained PSII-LHCII SC, isolated in the presence and absence of glycine betaine, were analyzed using single-particle image-averaging techniques. Both the 33-kDa and 33-kDa subunits could be visualized in top-view and side-view projections. In the side view the 23-kDa subunit is seen to protrude 0.5-1 nm further than the 33-kDa subunit, giving the PSII particle a maximal height of 9.5 nm. Measured from the centres of the masses, the two 33-kDa subunits associated with the dimeric PSII-LHCII SC are separated by 6.3 nm. The corresponding distance between the two 23-kDa subunits is 8.8 nm.									55	0	0	0	50	0	55			0014-2956			WOS:000072387700012	9523698

However, it is still a great challenge to rationally design bimetallic MOFs due to the lack of a tunable and reasonable hybrid structure architecture. Herein, a new series of bimetallic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with tunable pillar linkers were prepared by a one-step synthesis method. These bimetallic MOFs retain the same crystal structure when the mole fraction (based on metal) of the two metals changes from 0 to 1 and both metal ions occupy random nodal positions. The incorporation of a second metal cation has a large influence on the intrinsic properties (e.g. thermal stabilities and band gaps) of the MOFs. Furthermore, these bimetallic MOFs were used as self-sacrificial templates to prepare bimetal oxide catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). After pyrolysis, a porous and hierarchical honeycomb-like structure with carbon network covered (bi)metal oxides is formed. Among all the bimetallic MOF-derived catalysts, CoNi1@C showed the best performance for the OER with the lowest Tafel slopes (55.6 mV dec(-1)) and overpotentials (335 mV on a glassy carbon electrode and 276 mV on Ni foam) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is higher than those of state-of-the-art Co-Ni mixed oxide catalysts derived from MOFs for the OER. Our results indicate that the incorporation of a second metal ion is a promising strategy to tailor the properties of MOFs. More importantly, this new bimetallic MOF family with tunable linkers is expected to serve as a flexible assembly platform to offer broad possibilities for practical applications of MOFs.									99	6	0	0	5	0	100			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000459724300024

Despite intense research, the relation of structure-activity for single-atom catalysts (SACs) still bedazzles researchers, since diversified configurations of active sites would bring about difficulty in structural identification and theoretical simulations. Here, recent results on the applications of SACs are reviewed with an emphasis on identifying the active sites and discussing the relation between structure and property.									42	2	0	0	1	0	42			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000652107900004

The optimum firing condition for the thermal stability of the fiber was investigated by examining gas evolution, grain growth, resistivity, morphology and strength. The strength was low for the fibers fired below 1373 K, because of imperfect ceramization. The firing of 3.6 ks at 1473 K yielded the highest strength (3.5 GPa). The high strength of 1.9 GPa was retained when exposed at 1873 K in argon. Above 1573 K, the fiber strength was degraded by the thermal decomposition of amorphous SiCXOY phase. The residual oxygen in the tube caused the active-oxidation of beta -SiC crystals during firing at 1673 K, resulting in the loss of fiber strength.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0021-4876	1880-6880		WOS:000166560800022

The surface and structural properties of the electrode materials were assessed by means of energy dispersive X-ray (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. Electrochemical studies were carried out using cyclic voltammetry, polarizations curves and chronopotentiometry. A Nafion (R) 117 membrane was used as the only electrolyte for the studies using the filter-press cell. EDS data showed that the composition of the oxide films is quite different from the nominal composition evaluated from the precursor solutions. XRD spectra revealed that the presence of Sb can change the degree of crystallinity of the SnO2 phase (rutile structure). SEM images revealed a compact surface morphology of the oxide coatings containing some distributed rectangular grains. Voltammetric curves (VCs) obtained in electrolyte-free water revealed the electrochemically active surface area and the onset of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are both affected by the Sb content. Polarization curves obtained in electrolyte-free water revealed the overpotential for the OER increases with the Sb content. A comparative study using a 1.0 mol dm(-3) H2SO4 solution revealed that the anion of the electrolyte affects the behaviour of VCs, as well as the Tafel plots for the OER. In addition, the Tafel plots are also affected by microstructure of the oxide's surface. The endurance tests carried out under galvanostatic conditions using electrolyte-free water revealed that the electrode service life depends on the Sb content. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Kang, Taeoh; Lee, GeunHyeong; Kim, Jooheon								Optimized cobalt and graphitic carbon hybrid catalysts derived from zeolite imidazolate framework for oxygen evolution reaction								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH				46	7			9812	9821		10.1002/er.7853		MAR 2022		JUN 10 2022	2022	Catalysts with cobalt (Co) and graphitic carbon hybrid structure are receiving significant attention in various electrocatalysis applications because of their stability and high activities. In addition, the size and the well dispersed distribution of metal active site are some of the most important factors for electrocatalyst. In this paper, we successfully synthesized ultra-small and well dispersed Co nanoparticle on nitrogen-doped carbon structure (Co/NC) adding and evaporating a Zinc (Zn) and found the optimized ratio of Co and Zn. We used a bottom-up method to synthesize catalysts with Co on carbon substrate structure from zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF). Zinc (Zn) was also added and evaporated by pyrolysis. By addition and evaporation of Zn, Co nanoparticle became smaller and more evenly dispersed. As a result, the OER performance was significantly improved than the catalyst without Zn. Also, an optimized catalyst with abundant uniformly dispersed Co was successfully synthesized by appropriately controlling the ratio of Co and Zn comprising the ZIFs. As the ratio of Zn increased, the size and the amount of Co nanoparticles were decreased, and Co nanoparticles were more evenly dispersed. Furthermore, carbon substrate has more porous structure due to the evaporation of Zn atoms. When the Co:Zn ratio was 1:3, Co/NC showed the best electrocatalytic performance due to optimized active sites and large surface area. The optimized Co/NC showed an overpotential of 1.56 V (vs RHE) to acquire a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is higher activity than commercial RuO2. We also analyzed the material characterization occurred as the ratio of Zn in ZIF increased, revealing the factors enhancing the OER activity. Optimized Co/NC (Co:Zn = 1:3) exhibited improved OER activity and long-term and cycle stability in the OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000769184600001

The deterministic influence of external magnetic fields on CVD deposits was found to be substrate-independent as demonstrated by the growth of anisotropic alpha-Fe columns on FTO (F:SnO2) and Si (100), whereas the films deposited in the absence of the magnetic field were constituted by isotropic grains. TEM images revealed gradual increase in average crystallite size in correlation to the increasing field strength and orientation, which indicates the potential of magnetic field-assisted chemical vapor deposition (mfCVD) in controlling the texture of the CVD grown thin films. Given the facet-dependent activity of hematite in forming surface-oxygenated intermediates, exposure of crystalline facets and planes with high atomic density and electron mobilities is crucial for oxygen evolution reactions. The field-induced anisotropy in iron nanocolumns acting as templates for growing textured hematite pillars resulted in two-fold higher photoelectrochemical efficiency for hematite films grown under external magnetic fields (J = 0.050 mA cm(-2)), when compared to films grown in zero field (J = 0.027 mA cm(-2)). The dark current measurements indicated faster surface kinetics as the origin of the increased catalytic activity.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2516-0230			WOS:000496186600006	36134397

The resulting alternating copolymer was characterized by H-1-, C-13- and F-19-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies, and by size exclusion chromatography. The linear first-order kinetic plot, the linear evolutions of the molar mass with total monomer conversion, and the relatively low dispersity (D similar to 1.55) of the resulting copolymers suggest that this cobalt complex provides some degree of control over the copolymerization of VAc and MAF-TBE. Compared to the previously investigated cobalt complex OMRP mediators having a fully oxygen-based first coordination sphere, this study emphasizes a few peculiarities of Co(SAL)(2): a lower ability to trap radical chains as compared to Co(acac)(2) and the absence of catalytic chain transfer reactions, which dominates polymerizations carried in the presence of 9-oxyphenalenone cobalt derivative.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14				2073-4360		WOS:000419239400068	30966002

We have calculated the free energy surface for the electron transfer step by a combination of DFT calculations, MD simulations and the theory of electrocatalysis. We analyze in detail the interaction of the metal d band with the valence orbital of the hydrogen and its effect on the catalytic activity as well as several aspects that influence the electrode reactivity such as spatial arrangements of the nanostructures, the solvation shell and chemical factors. We found that the mixed Pd2Pt wire interacts strongly with hydrogen, and retains an almost complete solvation shell, which is reflected in a substantially reduced activation energy for the Volmer step. Thus, Pd2Pt wires on Au(111) are predicted to be efficient electrocatalysts for the reaction.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0953-8984	1361-648X		WOS:000667938200001	34062525

The photo- oxidative stress was brought on by photosensitization of singlet oxygen ( (1)Delta(g)) in the presence of a novel photosensitizer, water- soluble fullerol C-60(OH)(19)(ONa)(17), and resulted in partial protein denaturation. This process was monitored via ESR measurements performed for a spin- labelled SNase Thr- 62- Cys mutant, with MTSSL spin label ( SL) attached to the cysteine 62 residue ( SNase T62C- SL). Prior to ESR measurements of the oxidative stress- induced alterations in protein conformations, the efficiency of C-60(OH)(19)(ONa)(17) for (1)Delta(g)- generation was confirmed by three different techniques: ( i) selective reactive scavenging of (1)Delta(g) and ESR detection of the resulting paramagnetic product, ( ii) (1)Delta(g)- mediated photo- oxidative loss of tryptophan and ( iii) by measuring the characteristic near-infrared phosphorescence of singlet oxygen at 1270 nm. The observed evolution of the ESR spectra of SNase T62C- SL as a function of exposure to the photooxidative stress points to marked changes in protein conformation due to the deleterious action of (1)Delta(g).

The latter process results in the formation of a graded alloyed ZnOxS1-x layer with a continuously decreasing content of sulfur and increasing content of oxygen from the bulk to the surface of the crystals. These photolytic changes are observed within the surface layer with a thickness of 50-80 nm which is comparable to the depth of light penetration into the ZnS crystals. Coupling of ZnS to ZnO, both via pre-photolysis thermal oxidation of ZnS in the dark or by in situ formation of ZnO via the oxidative photocorrosion of ZnS accelerates the photolysis considerably, most probably, as a result of directed and opposite flow of the electrons and holes within the graded ZnOxS1-x layer and suppression of the electron-hole recombination.The ZnOxS1-x heterostructures revealed a relatively high photocatalytic activity in hydrogen evolution from water/ethanol mixtures under illumination with the UV light with a quantum yield of up to 1.6% in the absence of any co-catalysts. The dependence between the rate of photocatalytic hydrogen formation and the duration of ZnS photolysis was found to be dome-shaped one as a result of the interplay of two factors (i) an increase of the probability of the spatial separation of the electron and hole within the ZnOxS1-x layer and (ii) a decrease of the probability of ethanol oxidation by the holes with an increase in the ZnOxS1-x layer thickness (or photolysis duration as an equivalent). In the optimal conditions the rate of photocatalytic H-2 evolution was 30 times higher than that. for original nonphotolyzed ZnS owing to the unique graded structure of the alloyed zinc oxysulfide layer produced by the oxidative photolysis.

In this case, nonlinear behaviors such as electrochemical oscillation and metal fractal occur in the electrode reaction process. The multiple valence state changes of manganese and the nonlinear coupling of multiple chemical reactions cause the electrolytic process to be unstable and unmanageable, and increase extra energy consumption. Therefore, a study regarding the physical and chemical processes of the electrode/solution interface will help in revealing the electrode reaction mechanism and elaborate the nonlinear behaviors of the interface reaction process. This should control the electrode reaction process more effectively and regulate the entire process more efficiently. This paper presents a new mode of chaotic current electrolysis by introducing a hyperchaotic circuit instead of the original direct current power supply. Galvanostatic polarization, anode polarization, the Tafel test, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy were employed to analyze the relationship between the electrochemical oscillation behavior and anodic deposited manganese oxides on lead alloy anodes. Research results show that the potential oscillation behavior of the anode is suppressed to a certain extent. The average oscillation period was increased by 5.6 s, and the average oscillation amplitude was reduced by 38 mV compared with direct current polarization after $350\;{\rm{A}} \cdot {{\rm{m}}^{ - 2}}$ constant current polarization for 30 min. This would help to reduce the generation of anode slime and additional energy consumption during electrolysis. At the same time, the deposited ${\rm{Mn}}{{\rm{O}}_2}$ on the anode under hyperchaotic current had a dense and flat surface, which improved the oxygen evolution reaction activity and the corrosion resistance of the lead alloy anode. The comprehensive analysis demonstrated that the application of hyperchaotic current to manganese metal electrolysis could achieve effective regulation of anode electrochemical oscillation, providing a new insight for the further reduction in the energy consumption and pollution emission in the electrolysis process.			金属锰湿法电冶过程是一个典型的远离平衡态的非线性体系,直流作用下会出现电化学振荡、金属分形等非线性行为而引发体系额外的能耗.本文提出一种超混沌电流电解的新模式,通过引入超混沌电路代替原有直流电源来实现.超混沌电流作用下,采用恒电流极化曲线、阳极极化曲线、塔菲尔测试等分析方法和X射线衍射分析、扫描电子显微镜的表征方法,研究铅合金阳极电化学振荡行为与阳极沉积的锰氧化物之间的关联.研究结果表明,在电流密度为$350\;{\rm{A}} \cdot {{\rm{m}}^{ - 2}}$恒电流极化30 min后,超混沌电流极化作用下电位振荡的平均振荡周期较直流极化提高5.6 s,平均振幅降低38 mV;超混沌电流作用下阳极生成的${\rm{Mn}}{{\rm{O}}_2}$,其表面较为致密平整,在一定程度上可以提高铅合金阳极析氧反应活性和耐腐蚀性.综合分析可知,将超混沌电流运用于金属锰电解过程,可以实现对阳极电化学振荡的有效调控,为进一步降低电解过程能耗和污染排放提供新思路.						1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2095-9389			CSCD:7036921

The textile printing and dyeing industry use synthetic dyes to color its products producing lots of wastewater. In this work, ultrasmall size of TiO2 supported on N-doped carbon (TiO2@NC) have been prepared via electron-induced dye dissociation and reassembly method. The dye precursors of methyl orange (MO), methylene blue (MB), and rhodamine B (RB) provide N and C sources. TiO2 are sputtered and loaded onto carbon simultaneously during the one-step synthesis process. TiO2@NC-MO with the highest proportion of graphitic-N exhibits the best OER performance with a low overpotential (325 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and excellent durability (over 50,000 s at 10 mA cm(-2)) in alkaline solution. A two-electrode electmlyzer is assembled by using TiO2@NC-MO as anode and cathode in 1.0 M KOH media for the overall water splitting, which delivers an initial cell voltage of only 1.71 V at 10 mA cm(-2), as well as long-term stability up to 50,000 s. Density functional theory calculations verification that the TiO2-N-C interface with high radio of graphitic-N leads to the optimal catalytic activity. This study sheds light on the recycling and reuse of dye wastewater for the fabrication of highly efficient electrocatalysts with controllable N-doping structures and metal oxide size via a novel eco-friendly approach.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000791644900004

Herein, we demonstrate Ru2P nanoparticles (without any doping and modifications) as a highly efficient Pt-like catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in different pH electrolytes. On transferring the hexagonal close-packed crystal structure of Ru to the orthorhombic structure of Ru2P, a greatly improved catalytic activity and stability toward HER is found owing to Ru-P coordination. The electronic state change originates from the P-Ru bonding structures, which accounts for the HER activity improvement compared with Ru nanoparticles. Specifically, Ru2P nanoparticles can drive 10 mAcm(-2) at a very low overpotential of 55 mV, only 8 mV more than Pt/C in an acidic solution; and an extremely low overpotential of approximately 50 mV is needed in alkaline solution, about 20 mV less than the Pt/C catalyst. The Volmer-Tafel mechanism is indicated on Ru2P nanoparticles with the typical Tafel slope of 30 mVdec(-1) of Pt metal indicating a Pt-like catalytic ability. Ru2P is more active in the Ru-P family as H atoms prefer to adsorb on Ru atoms rather than on the P element according to theoretical calculations. Considering the low price of Ru (20% of Pt), anti-corrosion ability in the electrolyte, and the safe and reliable fabrication approach, the powder Ru2P nanoparticles make an excellent HER catalyst with great promise for large-scale water electrolysis applications.									76	6	0	0	3	0	78			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000442491300010	29888872

The resultant GO-PcP nanohybrids exhibit markedly enhanced nonlinear optical and optical limiting performances over those of their components and physical mixtures at 532 nm in the nanosecond pulse range. The optical nonlinearity can be further optimized by tuning the linkage type between the four-branched tetraamine metallophthalocyanine units. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is investigated by linear sweep voltammetry in a 0.5-M H2SO4 aqueous solution. Under optimal conditions, the overpotentials needed to reach 1 mA cm(-2) are measured as 237 and 210 mV for GO-PcP 1 and GO-PcP 2, respectively, which places GO-PcP 2 as the best metallophthalocyanine polymer-based HER catalyst to be reported in the literature. The improved performances were ascribed to the positive synergistic effects between MPc-COPS and GO. Notably, the present study introduces a new strategy for the precise preparation of MPc-COP-based nanomaterials while exploring their applications to develop highly efficient optical limiters and electrocatalysts.

Strong size dependences are found for the reactivity of these cationic Pb-n(+) clusters with CH3I. For the Pb-n(+) with n <= 4, iodinated clusters PbnI+ were found to be the dominant products, in strong contrast to n > 4 where no such products were seen. Quantum chemical studies show that with an increasing number of Pb atoms, the Pb-Pb interatomic interactions become stronger compared with the Pb-I bonding in PbnI+ clusters. Furthermore, the reactions of Pb-1-4(+) with CH3I have fairly small transition state energy barriers, in contrast to those for Pb-n>4(+) clusters which have magnitudes that will prevent reactions under the ambient conditions.									2	1	0	0	0	0	2			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000526393200016	32091897

Coll ions seem to cause only a moderate perturbation of the reaction mechanism, causing a fast conversion of the cyclohexyl hydroperoxide via a redox cycle, rather than via abstraction of the alpha H-atom by chain carrying peroxyl radicals. Nevertheless, both the radical propagation and the Co-II-induced decomposition of the hydroperoxide cause the formation of cyclohexoxy radicals that are partially transformed to 6-hydroxyhexanoic acid, the major primary byproduct for these systems. However, during the Co-II-catalyzed reaction, the concentration of cyclohexanone increases much faster than that of the hydroperoxide, causing the ketone to take over the role of dominant byproduct source. A mechanism for the conversion of cyclohexanone to ring-opened byproducts is put forward. Cr(acac)(3) seems to catalyze additional reactions, some of them probably leading directly to byproducts. Indeed, the evolution of (by)products is significantly different from the Co-II-catalyzed and the thermal systems, in the sense that they all seem to be primary in origin.									25	1	2	0	1	0	25			1089-5639			WOS:000253355300011	18247511

In one stage of the cycle, the active site is regenerated through formation of a new nucleophilic mu-hydroxy moiety and reprotonation of the proton donor, His125 (numbered according to the protein phosphatase 1 sequence). To date the exact details of the mechanism of this step remain uncertain. On the basis of recurring observations in several crystal structures, we propose an activation mechanism in which dephosphorylation of PPPs proceeds mainly through proton transfer from the water molecule that bridges the metal ions to His125, which is mediated by another water molecule. Our calculations using hybrid density functional theory and B3LYP functionals support this activation mechanism. We also propose that Asp95 facilitates proton transfer by eliminating the energy barrier and the backbone carbonyl oxygen atom of His248 acts mainly to orient and stabilize the mu-hydroxo (or water molecule) through hydrogen bonding. Furthermore, on the basis of the structural similarities of the active sites of purple acid phosphatases (PAPs) and PPPs, we speculate that PAPs are activated by a dual proton transfer mediated by one water molecule. Our calculations support this hypothesis and indicate that the active site of PAPs can still be active in an acidic environment (in agreement with the acid phosphatase activity of PAPs). Therefore, the variant of the activation mechanism from PPPs to PAPs implies an evolutionary adaptation to acidic environments.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			0949-8257	1432-1327		WOS:000327406000014	24142377

Here, an electricity-heat complementary strategy was achieved by a heat-electricity-sensitive interconversion of the alpha-Ni(OH)(2)/gamma-NiOOH redox couple. In our strategy, the thermo-activated effects significantly lower the barrier energies of initial electroxidation of Ni2+/Ni3+ and subsequent chemical water oxidation to the nearly equal value via coupling a low-grade heat field (<100 degrees C), thereby achieving a consecutive two-step cascade reaction without kinetic delay. As a result, the cascaded water splitting reaction can happen at an extremely low overpotential of 130 mV and affords a low cell voltage of 1.73 V at 100 mA cm(-2) at 90 degrees C in alkaline electrolyte. Our findings open a new avenue to produce hydrogen by complementation and gain effects of different-grade energies.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1948-7185			WOS:000737969900001	34958228

However, nano-scale particles are easy to aggregate and inactivate, so confining nano-scale particles in crystalline porous materials is a best way to solve the above problems. Covalent-organic frameworks with high crystallinity, high porosity, and tunable structures will be a potential alternative, and have attracted substantial attention. More importantly, the interaction between nano-scale particles and supports (confinement effect) could be controlled through different synthetic methods. The confinement effect has a great influence on the performance of the catalysts, for example, the size effect for activity promotion, encapsulation effect for stability enhancement, and molecular-sieving effect for selectivity improvement. Therefore, the confinement effect of COF-confined catalysts provides functional sites for catalytic reactions. There has been a major breakthrough in solving the problems of environmental pollution and energy shortage. The efficiency of heterogeneous catalytic reactions such as hydrogen production, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, 4-nitrophenol reduction, hydrogenation reaction, and organic pollutant degradation has been improved by using COF-confined catalysts. Herein, the synthetic methods of nano-scale particles confined in COFs are summarized, and the interaction between nano-scale particles and COFs is discussed to understand their various confinement effects. Then, the interaction between nano-scale particles and the reactant was understood through heterogeneous catalytic reactions. Finally, perspectives on the future developments in COF-confined catalysts in various fields are highlighted.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000711562300001

The results indicated (i) that the in-vivo responses of the two photosystems to high-temperature pretreatments were markedly different and in some respects opposite, with photosystem (PS) II activity being inhibited (or down-regulated) and PSI function being stimulated; and (ii) that light strongly interacts with the response of the photosystems, acting as an efficient protector of the photochemical activity against its inactivation by heat. When imposed in the dark, heat provoked a drastic inhibition of photosynthetic oxygen evolution and photochemical energy storage, correlated with a marked loss of variable PSII-chlorophyll fluorescence emission. None of the above changes were observed in leaves which were illuminated during heating. This photoprotection was saturated at rather low light fluence rates (around 10 W.m-2). Heat stress in darkness appeared to increase the capacity for cyclic electron flow around PSI, as indicated by the enhanced photochemical energy storage in far-red light and the faster decay of P700+ (oxidized reaction center of PSI) monitored upon sudded interruption of the far-red light. The presence of light during heat stress reduced somewhat this PSI-driven cyclic electron transport. It was also observed that heat stress in darkness resulted in the progressive closure of the PSI reaction centers in leaves under steady illumination whereas PSII traps remained largely open, possibly reflecting the adjustment of the photochemical efficiency of undamaged PSI to the reduced rate of photochemistry in PSII.									179	8	0	0	167	1	191			0032-0935	1432-2048		WOS:A1991GV36700012	24186579

The surface orientations of grains, measured by electron backscatter diffraction, were correlated to the amounts of reduced and oxidized products on each surface. The results show that the photochemical reduction of Ag+ is strongly favored on BiVO4 (001) surfaces (indexed in group I2/b). However, Ag+ can be reduced on all orientations, with the rate of reduction decreasing with increasing inclination from the [001] direction. The oxidation of Pb2+ is strongly favored on (hk0) surfaces perpendicular to (001). Surfaces within 50 degrees of [001] have a much lower activity for the oxidation of Pb2+. The results also show that reduction and oxidation reactions occur on complementary surfaces of BiVO4 crystals.									25	1	0	0	0	0	25			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000348146600076

The hydrophobic (surfactant) organic molecules on the surface of such an aerosol can be processed by chemical reactions with some atmospheric species; this affects the hygroscopicity of the aerosol and hence its ability to become a cloud droplet either via nucleation or via Kohler activation. The most probable pathway of such processing involves atmospheric hydroxyl radicals that abstract hydrogen atoms from hydrophobic organic molecules located on the aerosol surface (first step), the resulting radicals being quickly oxidized by ubiquitous atmospheric oxygen molecules to produce surface-bound peroxyl radicals (second step). These two reactions play a crucial role in the enhancement of the Kohler activation of the aerosol and its evolution into a cloud droplet. Taking them and a third reaction (next in the multistep chain of relevant heterogeneous reactions) into account, one can derive an explicit expression for the free energy of formation of a four-component aqueous droplet on a ternary aqueous organic aerosol as a function of four independent variables of state of a droplet. The results of numerical calculations suggest that the formation of cloud droplets on such (aqueous hydrophilic/hydrophobic organic) aerosols is most likely to occur as a Kohler activation-like process rather than via nucleation. The model allows one to determine the threshold parameters of the system necessary for the Kohler activation of such aerosols, which are predicted to be very sensitive to the equilibrium constant of the chain of three heterogeneous reactions involved in the chemical aging of aerosols.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1089-5639			WOS:000431724100011	29668281

Thin films of amorphous CA(2) were deposited on sapphire substrates by pulsed-laser deposition at 900 A degrees C in an oxygen ambient atmosphere. After deposition, the reaction couples were heat treated in air for various times either at 1300 or 1400 A degrees C. Atomic-force microscopy was used to monitor changes in the microstructure of the films. Interfaces between the different regions were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of cross-sectional samples prepared by focused ion-beam milling. The CA(2) films had dewetted the substrate surface as a result of the heat treatment. An interfacial reaction layer was observed between the dewetted CA(2) droplets and the substrate. The structure of this reaction layer was found to be consistent with gamma-Al2O3 by computer analysis of high-resolution TEM images. There is a perfect epitaxy between the interfacial layer and the substrate. For the samples heat treated for longer times, hexagonal features were found on the substrate surface. The presence of these features on (0001)-oriented alpha-Al2O3 suggests that CA(6) platelets form by the transformation of the interfacial reaction layer. The results are discussed in relation to the crystallization behavior of the various calcium aluminate phases and the equilibrium-phase diagram of the CaO-Al2O3 system.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			0022-2461			WOS:000262402200007

We measure both O III] 1666 Angstrom and C III] 1909 Angstrom in our spectra, enabling us to determine C+2/O+2 with relatively small uncertainties. The results from our HST observations show a continuous increase in C/O with increasing O/H, consistent with a power law having an index of 0.43 +/- 0.09 over the range -4.7 to -3.6 in log (O/H). One possible interpretation of this trend is that the most metal-poor galaxies are the youngest and dominated by the products of early enrichment by massive stars, while more metal-rich galaxies show increasing, delayed contributions of carbon from intermediate-mass stars. However, recent evolution models for massive stars including mass loss suggest that the yield of carbon from massive stars may increase with metallicity relative to the yield of oxygen; new chemical evolution models for the solar neighborhood which include nucleosynthesis from these recent stellar evolution models predict a C/O abundance evolution similar to that observed in the metal-poor galaxies. The trend in the C/N ratio increases steadily with O/H in the irregular galaxies, but decreases suddenly for solar neighborhood stars and H II regions. This may indicate that the bulk of nitrogen production is decoupled from the synthesis of carbon in our Galaxy. Our results also suggest that it may not be appropriate to combine abundances in irregular galaxies with those in spiral galaxies to study the evolution of chemical abundances. Our measured C/O ratios in the most metal-poor galaxies are consistent with predictions of nucleosynthesis from massive stars for Weaver SZ Woosley's best estimate for the C-12(alpha, gamma)O-16 nuclear reaction rate, assuming negligible contamination from carbon produced in intermediate-mass stars in these galaxies.We detect a weak N III] 1750 Angstrom multiplet in SMC N88A and obtain interesting upper limits for two other objects. Our 2 sigma upper limits on the 1750 Angstrom feature indicate that the N+2/O+2 ratios in these objects are not significantly larger than the N+/O+ ratios measured from optical spectra. This behavior is consistent with predictions of photoionization models, although better detections of N III] are needed to confirm the results.									173	1	0	0	0	1	175			0004-637X			WOS:A1995QQ87900008

Of the many factors simultaneously influenced by infauna, alterations of the diagenetic transport regime during particle reworking, burrow formation, and irrigation play particularly important roles in controlling net degradation of organic material and nutrient recycling. Particle and fluid transport in the bioturbated zone influences the overall rates of reaction, reaction distributions, degradation pathways, synthetic reactions, coupled redox reaction balances, and the eventual extent of organic matter degradation (preservation). Macrofaunal and meiofaunal effects on transport are highly density, size, and species specific. In general, overall suboxic decomposition pathways and microbial activities are greatly enhanced by both particle and solute transport. Reaction zonation and coupling become more complex and highly dynamic in the presence of infauna. Experimental studies of both bulk sedimentary organic matter and decay of specific compounds, such as lipids and photopigments, demonstrate that macrobenthic activity results in more rapid and complete decomposition relative to deposits without bioturbation. Net rate increases (typically similar to2-10X) are due both to alteration of the effective reaction rate constants governing net decomposition (k) of organic material, and to enhancement of the effective pool size of material available to react (er). Effects on pool size are directly related to reaction pathway, synthetic reactions, and increased total decomposition under steady or oscillating oxic-suboxic conditions. Reactivity, parameterized as a rate constant, A; is a conditional function of solute transport, and at least for the refractory organic pool, also of redox reaction path. Enhanced solute transport resulting from density-dependent irrigation clearly promotes net rates of remineralization independent of oxidant availability. Microbial populations are more abundant and individual cells larger and more active as solute exchange increases, even under strictly anoxic conditions.

X-ray diffraction revealed an enlargement of the unit cell and an increase of the crystallite size with increasing ammonolysis temperature. Scanning electron microscopy showed reduced particle sizes for beta-TaON synthesized at 800 and 900 degrees C compared to the precursor oxide. With increasing nitridation temperature the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area was reduced and the nitrogen content increased. UV-Vis spectroscopy showed a bandgap energy of 2.6-2.4 eV. The highest oxygen evolution rate of 220 mu mol.g(-1).h(-1) was achieved for beta-TaON synthesized at 800 degrees C. The factors determining the photocatalytic activity of beta-TaON powders were found to be the specific surface area and defects in the beta-TaON.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1110-662X	1687-529X		WOS:000315883700001

The tight coupling between paired anodic and cathodic reactions in conventional electrochemical processes, however, constrains the products and their efficiencies. Here, we demonstrate a strategy to achieve modular electrochemical synthesis (ModES) of different chemicals by decoupling and pairing the oxidative and reductive half-reactions with a heterogeneous redox reservoir (RR). Specifically, sodium nickel hexacyanoferrate (NaNiHCF) can serve as a robust and reversible RR that enables the modular production of several strong oxidants, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and sodium persulfate (Na2S2O8) or active chlorine, in separate RR-coupled electrochemical processes. The system's excellent performance and operational stability is demonstrated by continuous operation over 100 cycles (similar to 36 h) to produce H2O2 and Na2S2O8 with a high voltage efficiency. The concept presented here highlights the prospects for using RRs to enable efficient, modular, and on-demand electrochemical synthesis of valuable chemicals.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2542-4351			WOS:000610121200015

We start by introducing the potential and current limitations in the development of energy conversion technologies based on this process, followed by a brief description of the two main proposed reaction mechanisms. We next present an overview of the different theoretical approaches adopted to describe this reaction, and summarise the most recent computational works devoted specifically to the investigation of the O-O bond formation step. The latter part also includes a review of the advances in the modelling of electrochemical energy barriers. The chemical descriptors proposed to rationalise the OER activity and the theoretical methods developed to account for solvent effects, are also reviewed. Finally, we present a selection of theoretical studies reported over the last two years to illustrate the descriptive and predictive power of computational methods.									25	0	0	0	2	0	25			2451-9103			WOS:000433581100007

Inspired by energy challenges and the emerging understanding of photosystem II, the development of artificial molecular catalysts for water oxidation has become a highly active area of research in recent years. In this Focus Review, we describe recent achievements in the development of single-site ruthenium catalysts for water oxidation with a particular focus on the overpotential of water oxidation. First, we introduce the general scheme to access the high-valent ruthenium-oxo species, the key species of the water-oxidation reaction. Next, the mechanisms of the O-O bond formation from the active ruthenium-oxo species are described. We then discuss strategies to decrease the onset potentials of the water-oxidation reaction. We hope this Focus Review will contribute to the further development of efficient catalysts toward sustainable energy-conversion systems.									25	0	0	0	2	0	25			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000348719500002	25318678

Several bimetallic nanostructures have been investigated: wires and clusters with different Pd:Pt ratios. Modifications in the material reactivity due to electronic, chemical and geometrical effects were evaluated in terms of energetics, charge redistribution and the densities of states projected onto the involved atoms to provide a deeper insight into the material behavior. Additionally, we discussed the nanostructure reactivity for the hydrogen reaction by analysis of the behavior of the adsorbed intermediate (H-ads).									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0039-6028	1879-2758		WOS:000541372900006

All the models have been computed with the latest version (4.97) of the FRANEC code that now includes a nuclear network extending from neutrons to Mo-98. The explosive nucleosynthesis has been computed twice: a first one with a hydro code and a second one following the simpler radiation-dominated shock approximation (RDA). The main results concerning the models and the associated explosions are as follows: (1) the inclusion of the latest available input physics does not alter significantly the main properties of the presupernova models with respect to our previous ones; (2) the differences between the old and new explosive yields computed with the RDA remain confined within a factor of 2 for most of the nuclei; (3) the differences between the elemental RDA yields and those computed with a hydro code do not exceed 0.1 dex, with the exceptions of the elements produced mainly by the complete explosive Si burning: in this case the variations are anyway less than a factor of 3; (4) the relation between the final kinetic energy and the Ni-56 ejected weakens as the mass of the progenitor star increases; (5) the yields corresponding to the ejection of a given amount of Ni-56 are in fair agreement with those obtained by a more energetic explosion in which the mass cut is chosen in order to give the same Ni-56. The production factors (integrated over a Salpeter mass function between 13 and 35 M-circle dot) of the majority of the isotopes show an almost scaled solar distribution relative to oxygen. The few exceptions are discussed in detail. We also find that the present integrated yields allow a fraction of the order of 10%-20% of Type Ia supernovae if their latest available yields are adopted.									201	1	1	0	0	0	202			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000184098600034

Genes required for free-living existence were lost. Most genes useful to the symbiosis were transferred to the nucleus of the host. Some genes, a small minority, were retained within the organelle. Here we suggest that a selective advantage of movement of genes to the nucleus is decreased mutation: plastids and mitochondria have high volume-specific rates of redox reactions, producing oxygen free radicals that chemically modify DNA. These mutations lead to synthesis of modified electron carriers that in turn generate more mutagenic free radicals-the ''vicious circle'' theory of aging. Transfer of genes to the nucleus is also advantageous in facilitating sexual recombination and DNA repair. For genes encoding certain key components of photosynthesis and respiration, direct control of gene expression by redox state of electron carriers may be required to minimize free radical production, providing a selective advantage of organelle location which outweighs that of location in the nucleus. A previous proposal for transfer of genes to the nucleus is an economy of resources in having a single genome and a single apparatus for gene expression, but this argument fails if any organellar gene is retained. A previous proposal for the retention of genes within organelles is that certain proteins are organelle-encoded because they cannot be imported, but there is now evidence against this view. Decreased free radical mutagenesis and increased sexual recombination upon transfer to the nucleus together with redox control of gene expression in organelles may now account for the slightly different gene distributions among nuclei, plastids, and mitochondria found in major eukaryote taxa. This analysis suggests a novel reason for uniparental inheritance of organelles and the evolution of anisogametic sex, and may also account for the occurrence of nitrogen fixation in symbionts rather than in nitrogen-fixing organelles.									122	2	1	0	114	0	128			0022-2844			WOS:A1996UR42300002	8662000

However, it remains a challenge to increase the number of atomically dispersed active sites on these catalysts. Here we report a highly efficient impregnation-pyrolysis method to prepare effective ORR electrocatalysts with large amount of atomically dispersed Fe active sites from biomass. Two types of active catalyst centers were identified, namely atomically dispersed Fe sites and Fe,P particles. The ORR rate of the atomically dispersed Fe sites is three orders of magnitude higher than it of Fe,P particles. A linear correlation between the amount of the atomically dispersed Fe and the ORR activity was obtained, revealing the major contribution of the atomically dispersed Fe to the ORR activity. The number of atomically dispersed Fe increases as the Fe loading increased and reaching the maximum at 1.86 wt% Fe, resulting in the maximum ORR rate. Optimized Fe-N-P-C complex catalyst was used as the cathode catalyst in a homemade Zn-air battery and good performance of an energy density of 771 Wh kg(zn)(1), a power density of 92.9 mW cm(-2) at 137 mA cm(-2) and an excellent durability were exhibited.

The reclamation of old mine sites with pre-oxidized tailings is particularly challenging because of indirect oxidation reactions which can limit the overall effectiveness of an oxygen barrier to prevent AMD. The goal of this project was to quantitatively compare the effectiveness of different cover systems to reclaim two pre-oxidized acid-generating tailings sites, located in Quebec (Canada). Following laboratory column tests, field measurements and observations, coupled hydrogeological and geochemical numerical simulations were conducted to evaluate the effect of various system characteristics. Cover performance was assessed by simulating the evolution of the degree of (water) saturation, pore water pressures, oxygen fluxes and leachate quality. Several reclamation options, including monolayer covers and two-or three-layer covers with capillary barrier effect(s) were simulated. The simulations indicate that because of reduced cover effectiveness with pre-oxidized tailings, the general design targets developed for non-oxidized tailings may not always be directly applicable to already oxidized tailings. The simulations also illustrate how the behaviour and efficiency of a monolayer cover placed over reactive tailings depend on specific factors, including water table position, initial porewater chemistry, and cover materials' hydrogeological properties and thicknesses. The results indicate that under a given set of conditions, a bilayer cover (with a capillary break above the reactive tailings) would not significantly improve cover performance (compared to a monolayer cover) due to water losses by evaporation. The simulations show, however, that a well-designed three-layer cover with capillary barrier effects (CCBE) would be efficient in reducing the oxygen flux and AMD generation, even in the case of highly pre-oxidized tailings. The outcomes from this investigation highlight some of the advantages of carrying out coupled hydrogeological and geochemical simulations to assess the long-term behaviour of reclaimed mining sites.									22	1	0	0	7	0	23			0169-7722	1873-6009		WOS:000437373200004	29861334

The surface nucleation phenomenon was observed by suppressing the interface (n-Si/SiO2) nucleation by the incorporation of oxygen atoms during the initial deposition period of a-Si. It was found that the surface-nucleated polycrystalline Si (poly-Si) had equiaxial grains with the size of about 3-5 mu m, while interface-nucleated one had elliptical grains with the size of about 0.3-1 mu m.

The data available for studying this phenomenon, and the hypotheses as to its origin, have both co-evolved with observing technology; once high-resolution spectra were available even for main-sequence stars in globular clusters, scenarios involving multiple closely spaced stellar generations enriched by feedback from moderate-and high-mass stars began to gain traction in the literature. This paper briefly reviews the observational history of globular cluster abundance inhomogeneities, discusses the presently favored models of their origin, and considers several aspects of this problem that require further study.

The loading of semiconductors in a junction architecture is a promising strategy to improve charge separation. Using first-principles calculations with the HSE06 functional, we propose the type-II semiconductor heterojunction SIn2Te/TeIn2Se as a promising solar-driven water-splitting photocatalyst with a high utilization rate for solar power. Its band edges straddle the redox potential of the water-splitting reaction, satisfying the requirements for water-splitting photocatalysts. Its type-II band alignment promotes the separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs. The high optical absorption coefficient (5 x 10(4) cm(-1)), high absorbance (20.6%) in the visible region, high solar power conversion efficiency (18.5%) and significant excitonic effects indicate that SIn2Te/TeIn2Se can efficiently utilize solar power. Because of its weak interlayer coupling, its electronic, optical and photocatalytic properties remain outstanding under an external force field, guaranteeing its applicability under the actual experimental environment. Furthermore, its stability in liquid water and low reaction barrier for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) also support the promise of SIn2Te/TeIn2Se as a photocatalyst for the water-splitting reaction.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000658828000001

N-2) and the mass gain as well as the thicknesses of the individual oxide phases have been measured. The oxidation process has been simulated using a modified version of the homogenization model as implemented in Dictra; this has helped to rationalize the kinetics of oxide scale formation and in particular the evolution of the hematite (Fe2O3), magnetite (Fe3O4), and wustite (FeO) which form. Independently assessed thermodynamic and kinetic Calphad databases are needed for the calculations; details of these are given. Reasonable agreement between simulation results and experimental data is obtained, though it is concluded that the large influence of grain boundary diffusion on the oxidation rate needs further consideration.									17	1	0	0	1	0	18			0947-5117	1521-4176		WOS:000394663600003

The doping concentration is improved from 2.2% to 19.7% after the in situ solid-state reaction. X-ray absorption analysis indicates the substitution of Fe ions by Ti ions, without the generation of Fe2+ defects. Photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveals the dramatic improvement of the electrical conductivity of the hematite film after the in situ solid-state reaction. As a consequence, the photocurrent density increases 8-fold (from 0.15 mA/cm(2) to 1.2 mA/cm(2)), and it further increases up to similar to 1.5 mA/cm(2) with the adsorption of Co ions. Our findings demonstrate that the in situ solid-state reaction is an effective method to increase the doping level of Ti ions in hematite films with the retention of the micro-nanostructure of the films and enhance the photocurrent.									104	3	0	0	6	1	104			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000315619100019	23347501

By choosing amino acids as precursors, structure regulation of carbon nanosheets could be realized via switching the side chains of organic linkers, showing structure evolution from dense monolithic to porous nanosheets. Graphene-like carbon nanosheet constructed foam superstructure was also obtained. Owing to high porosity (BET surface area 1680 m(2) g(-1) with hierarchical pore structure) and nitrogen (8.23 wt%) modified graphitic frameworks, glutamic acid derived nitrogen doped porous carbon nanosheet superstructure showed high ORR activity (onset potential 0.9 V vs. RHE).									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1387-1811	1873-3093		WOS:000457662500005

We found here that the hemocytes of the oyster Crassostrea gigas release antimicrobial H1-like and H5-like histones in response to tissue damage and infection. These antimicrobial histones were shown to be associated with extracellular DNA networks released by hemocytes, the circulating immune cells of invertebrates, in response to immune challenge. The hemocyte-released DNA was found to surround and entangle vibrios. This defense mechanism is reminiscent of the neutrophil extracellular traps (ETs) recently described in vertebrates. Importantly, oyster ETs were evidenced in vivo in hemocyte-infiltrated interstitial tissues surrounding wounds, whereas they were absent from tissues of unchallenged oysters. Consistently, antimicrobial histones were found to accumulate in oyster tissues following injury or infection with vibrios. Finally, oyster ET formation was highly dependent on the production of reactive oxygen species by hemocytes. This shows that ET formation relies on common cellular and molecular mechanisms from vertebrates to invertebrates.

Considering water oxidation, interfacial charge transfer occurs on the millisecond to second timescales while bulk charge carrier lifetimes of metal oxides are typically in the fast picosecond-nanosecond regime. For charge transfer to efficiently compete with charge recombination, strategies that substantially increase the charge carrier lifetime need to be applied. In this chapter, we discuss the magnitude of the kinetic mismatch, overview common effective charge separation strategies that address this mismatch and highlight recent developments in our understanding of these processes. We also touch upon recent advances in determining the chemical nature of key reaction intermediates.									30	0	0	0	6	0	30			2451-9103			WOS:000424675500022		
J	Djikae, Yuri S.; Ruckenstei, Eli								Formation and evolution of aqueous organic aerosols via concurrent condensation and chemical aging								ADVANCES IN COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE				265				45	67		10.1016/j.cis.2019.01.001				MAR 2019	2019	We review recent results on the formation and evolution of aqueous organic aerosols via concurrent nucleation/condensation and chemical aging processes obtained mostly using the formalism of classical nucleation theory In this framework, an aqueous organic aerosol was modeled as a spherical partide of liquid solution of water and hydrophilic and hydrophobic condensable organic compounds; besides these compounds, the surrounding air contained some chemically reactive, non-condensable species. Hydrophobic organic molecules on the aerosol surface can be processed by chemical reactions with some atmospheric species; this affects the hygroscopicity of the aerosol and hence its ability to become a cloud droplet. Such processing is most probably triggered by atmospheric hydroxyl radicals that abstract hydrogen atoms from surfactant molecules located on the aerosol surface (first step), resulting radicals being quickly oxidized by ubiquitous atmospheric oxygen molecules to produce surface-bound peroxyl radicals (second step). These two reactions play a crucial role in the enhancement of the Kohler activation of the aerosol. Taking them and a third reaction (next in the multistep chain of relevant heterogeneous reactions) into account, one can derive an explicit expression for the free energy of formation of a four-component aqueous droplet on a ternary aqueous organic aerosol as a function of four independent variables of state of a droplet This approach was also applied to study a large subset of primary marine aerosols which can be initially treated using an "inverted micelle" model whereof the core consists of aqueous "salt" solution. Numerical evaluations suggest that the formation of cloud droplets on such (both aqueous hydrophilic/hydrophobic organic and marine) aerosols is most likely to occur via Kohler activation rather than via nucleation. The models allow one to determine the threshold parameters necessary for the Kohler activation of such aerosols. Furthermore, heterogeneous chemical reactions involved in the chemical aging of aerosols are most likely exothermic. Due to the release of the enthalpy of these reactions, the temperature of an aerosol particle during its chemical aging may become greater than the ambient (air) temperature. The analysis of the characteristic timescales of four most important processes involved suggests that this effect may play a significant impeding role in the formation of an ensemble of aqueous secondary organic aerosols via nucleation and, hence, must be taken into account in atmospheric aerosol and global climate models.

Herein, we report a synthesis of molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) supported on carbon supports with high concentration of doped-nitrogen derived from large scale industrial waste plastics, i.e. melamine (CWM) and polyurethane (CWPU), by a simple hydrothermal reaction. Few layers of MoS2 nanosheets with high catalytic activity can be very-well dispersed on CWM and CWPU. The supports with high-nitrogen content can not only greatly improve the conductivity of supported MoS2 nanosheets, but also provide additional active sites with the presence of high pyridinic-N content. The synergistic effects between the MoS2 nanosheet and CWM and CWPU contribute to high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. As the concentration of doped-N increases, the HER performance of MoS2-based catalysts is improved. MoS2/CWM 1:1 with the highest nitrogen content (11.1 wt %) shows the lowest overpotential of 56 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), the smallest Tafel slope of 36.6 mV.dec(-1), and the highest exchange current density of 0.35 mA cm(-2) in acidic condition, which are comparable to that of commercial 20% Pt/C.

These self-sensitized carbon nitride microspheres exhibit high visible-light activities in photocatalytic H-2 generation with excellent stability for more than 100 h reaction. Comparing to the traditional g-C3N4 with activities terminated at 450 nm, the polymeric triazine dyes on the carbon nitride microsphere surface allow for effective wide-range visible-light harvesting and extend the H-2 generation activities up to 600 nm. It is believed that this new type of highly stable self-sensitized metal-free structure opens a new direction of future development of low-cost photocatalysts for efficient and long-term solar fuels production.									58	5	0	0	4	0	61			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000383374600008	27225827

We study the evolution of microstructure in self-templated carbons derived from magnesium nitrilotriacetate, in the 600-1000 degrees C temperature range. The materials are characterised using N-2 adsorption, Hg intrusion, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, elemental analysis, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The carbons display high specific surface areas (up to 1830 m(2) g(-1)), and high pore volumes (up to 3.1 mL g(-1)). Interestingly, each porosity type -micro, meso, and macro -evolves along its own route. Micropore growth is most significant between 600 and 700 degrees C, yet it slows down and stops around 800 degrees C; this indicates that micropores form by removal of tarry matter from the interstices between graphitic sheets, rather than by physical/chemical etching of these sheets. Mesopores, templated by spontaneously forming MgO nanoparticles, become dominant at 800 degrees C; further agglomeration of these particles leads to macropore templating at 900 degrees C. The porosity evolution is explained by the growth of MgO particles, as monitored by XRD broadening. Furthermore, the degree of disorder decreases with the pyrolysis temperature, most significantly between 700 and 800 degrees C, with the Raman I-D/I-G ratio dropping from 1.36 to 1.17. Correspondingly, the in-plane length of graphitic crystallites increases along the series, from 14 to 17 nm. Although the nitrogen content decreases with pyrolysis temperature, from 6.9 to 4.1 at%, the ratio between graphitic and pyridinic nitrogens remains constant. We then measure the performance of these carbons as electrocatalysts in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at pH 13 using rotating disk electrode voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Remarkably, the ORR activity trend is independent of nitrogen concentration or degree of disorder. Instead, it is governed by the microstructural parameters, most importantly surface area and microporosity.									36	0	0	0	4	0	36			2046-2069			WOS:000383903500004		
J	Xie, Bo; Long, Xinggui; Hu, Sheng								The formation mechanism of cerium-bearing aerosols with the aid of chemical explosions in airtight scenarios								NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY				45	44			20696	20712		10.1039/d1nj03330a		OCT 2021		NOV 15 2021	2021	A laboratorial facility has been built for the generation and obtainment of cerium (Ce)-bearing aerosols with the aid of chemical explosions in an airtight tank. The characteristics of particles of Ce-bearing aerosols, including size distributions and evolution, morphology and chemical composition, and variation of crystal structures, have been systematically examined by combining in situ measurements (aerosol spectrometer) with off-line analysis techniques, for instance, Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Focused Ion Beam (FIB) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The experimental results indicate that the formation mechanisms of Ce-bearing aerosols under chemical explosions depend on different morphological characteristics of Ce materials, composition of the pellets and explosive dosage. The kinetics of the growth of aerosol particles formed by Ce tablets can include macroscopic decomposition and microscopic diffusion. The growth rate of particles is controlled by the adhesion coefficient between grains and the formed CeO2 concentration. A sea of Pb atoms can prevent the reaction of Ce atoms with oxygen radicals, and perhaps retard the diffusion of oxygen radicals to the surface of CeO2 particles. The dendritic particles with monoclinic Ce6O11 (5CeO(2)center dot CeO) as the main phase are dominant in the Ce-bearing aerosols formed by Ce powder. The temperature gradient may cause the difference in the rate of inter-particle advance to become larger, and the inhomogeneity of inter-particle growth more evident, which makes it facile to form dendritic structures. The formation feature of Ce-bearing aerosols by CeO2 shows an ocean of particles with irregular fragment structures, the reaction mechanism of which can in fact be described by the diffusion characteristics of oxygen defects on the surface of CeO2-x, resulting in the coexistence of Ce(iv) and Ce(iii) in aerosol particles. Ce is an excellent surrogate and homologue of lanthanide elements to the physical chemistry of actinides mainly due to the f-electrons, which have several identical properties. Consequently, investigations regarding the formation mechanisms of Ce-bearing aerosols may offer valuable data for the discussion of plutonium (Pu)-bearing aerosols.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000711569800001

When tuned to the dissociative core-excited state at the O1s pre-edge of water, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering back to the electronic ground state exhibits a long vibrational progression due to ultrafast nuclear dynamics. We show how the coherent evolution of the OH bonds around the core-excited oxygen provides access to high vibrational levels in liquid water. The OH bonds stretch into the long-range part of the potential energy curve, which makes the X-ray probe more sensitive than infra-red spectroscopy to the local environment. We exploit this property to effectively probe hydrogen bond strength via the distribution of intramolecular OH potentials derived from measurements. In contrast, the dynamical splitting in the spectral feature of the lowest valence-excited state arises from the short-range part of the OH potential curve and is rather insensitive to hydrogen bonding.									43	1	0	0	5	0	43			2041-1723			WOS:000460125000002	30833573

Red algae are unique photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms in the evolution of algae, as they contain phycobilisomes (PBSs) on their thylakoid membranes. In this report, the in vivo chlorophyll (Chl) a fluorescence kinetics of nitrogen-starved Porphyridium cruentum were analyzed to determine the effects of nitrogen deficiency on photosynthetic performance using a multi-color pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) chlorophyll fluorometer. Due to nitrogen starvation, the photochemical efficiency of PSII and the activity of PSII reaction centers (RCs) decreased, and photoinhibition of PSII occurred. The water-splitting system on the donor side of PSII was seriously impacted by nitrogen deficiency, leading to the inactivation of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) and decreased light energy conversion efficiency. In nitrogen-starved cells, a higher proportion of energy was used for photochemical reactions, and thermal dissipation was reduced, as shown by qP and qN. The ability of nitrogen-starved cells to tolerate and resist high photon flux densities was weakened. Our results showed that the photosynthetic performance of P. cruentum was severely impacted by nitrogen deficiency.									66	3	0	0	48	1	69			2045-2322			WOS:000407864000009	28819147

In a similar reaction, 2-hydroxy-2'-carboxy-5-methylazobenzene (H2azc) furnishes KMn(III) (azc)2.4H2O, which can be oxidized Mn(IV) (azc)2 by persulfate. The X-ray structures of Mn(amp)2 and Mn(azp)2 are reported. Crystal data for Mn(amp)2: space group C2/c, Z = 4, a = 20.163 (12) angstrom, b = 7.921 (4) angstrom, c = 12.994 (10) angstrom, beta = 97.65 (5)-degrees, and V = 2057 (2) angstrom 3. Crystal data for Mn(azp)2: space group P1BAR, Z = 2, a = 7.766 (5) angstrom, b = 10.377 (5) angstrom, c = 12.964 (5) angstrom, alpha = 92.80 (3)-degrees, beta = 90.33 (5)-degrees, gamma = 102.92 (4)-degrees, and V = 1016.8 (9) angstrom 3. The ligands act as meridional tridentate ONO donors. The Mn-O distances fall in the range 1.861 (4)-1.893 (6) angstrom. The Mn-N(azomethine) length, 1.968 (8) angstrom, is shorter than the average Mn-N(azo) length, 2.007 (10) angstrom. The MnO4N2 coordination spheres deviate considerably from octahedral geometry, and this is reflected in the EPR spectra of the complexes: strong and weak signals near g = 4 and g = 2, respectively. The manganese(IV)-manganese(III) reduction potentials of Mn(amp)2, Mn(azp)2, and Mn(azc)2 in dimethyl sulfoxide are respectively -0.09, +0.15, and 0.31 V vs SCE. In MnO4N2-type salicylaldimine complexes, the potential varies with oxygen donors according to the order alcoholate < phenolate < carboxylate. The total shift can be as large as 600 mV. The trend is correlated with the pK's of the oxygen donor functions. The significance of the results with respect to carboxylate binding of PS II manganese is noted.									100	0	0	0	6	0	100			0020-1669			WOS:A1991GK98200012

To demonstrate the effect of exposed facet on the performance of composite photocatalyst and understand the corresponding mechanism, we prepared ZnFe2O4 and Ag3PO4 with {111}, {110}, {100}, and mixed exposed facets, and constructed corresponding Z-scheme Ag/ZnFe2O4-Ag-Ag3PO4 heterojunctions using a photo-assisted isoelectric point method. The {111} facet of Ag3PO4, which has higher surface activity, better separation efficiency of photogenerated e- and h+, and higher energy and activity of photogenerated electrons, exhibited the highest activity in photocatalytic H2O2 production under simulated sunlight (146.1 mu mol/L in the presence of 10 vol% methanol as a hole sacrificial agent by 120 min). The H2O2 production efficiency was significantly improved for the Z-scheme Ag/ ZnFe2O4-Ag-Ag3PO4 composites (up to 206.3 mu mol/L in the presence of 10 vol% methanol by 120 min for the one with the {111} facet of Ag3PO4 exposed). The band potentials of ZnFe2O4 and Ag3PO4 were suitable for forming Z-scheme heterostructure, while the recombination of photogenerated e- and h+ was effectively inhibited with the Ag introduced as a conductive channel and co-catalyst in the composite photocatalysts. Photocatalytic H2O2 production in the presence of Ag3PO4 occurred through the direct two-electron oxygen reduction reaction, while that in the presence of Z-scheme Ag/ZnFe2O4-Ag-Ag3PO4 involved sequential two-step single-electron oxygen reduction reaction. The insights obtained in this work could help guide the design and development of highly active composite photocatalysts through crystal facet engineering.									9	1	0	0	2	0	10			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000724758900002

The S2- ions are produced after decomposition from respective sulfur precursors, which, in general, react with oxidized Ni2+ ions from the NiF at optimized temperatures and pressures, forming the NixSy superstructures. These NixSy electrocatalysts are initially screened for their structure, morphology, phase purity, porosity, and binding energy by means of various sophisticated instrumentation technologies. The as-obtained NixSy electrocatalyst from sodium thiosulfate endows an overpotential of 200 mV. The oxygen evolution overpotential results of NixSy electrocatalysts are comparable or superior to those reported previously for other self-grown NixSy superstructure morphologies.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			2470-1343			WOS:000466552500044	31459781

Following a pulsating phase, an accretion shock develops above a core of similar to 1 M, composed of carbon and oxygen, inducing a converging detonation. A three-dimensional simulation of the explosion produced a kinetic energy of 1.05 x 10(51) ergs and 0.70 M-circle dot of Ni-56, ejecting scarcely 0.01 M-circle dot of C-O moving at low velocities. The mechanism works under quite general conditions and is flexible enough to account for the diversity of normal Type Ia supernovae. In given conditions the detonation might not occur, which would reflect in peculiar signatures in the gamma-ray and UV wavelengths.									48	0	0	0	0	0	48			0004-637X			WOS:000237554300018

The time-dependent evolution of habitable zone (HZ) boundaries is calculated for each stellar evolution track based on stellar mass, effective temperature, and luminosity parameterizations. The rate of change of stellar surface quantities and the surrounding HZ position are strong functions of all three quantities explored. The range of orbits that remain continuously habitable, or habitable for at least 2 Gyr, are provided. The results show that the detailed chemical characterization of exoplanet host stars and a consideration of their evolutionary history are necessary to assess the likelihood that a planet found in the instantaneous HZ has had sufficient time to develop a biosphere capable of producing detectable biosignatures. This model grid is designed for use by the astrobiology and exoplanet communities to efficiently characterize the time evolution of host stars and their HZs for planetary candidates of interest.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000354905000067

The crystallite size and the unit cell volume decrease with the increase of Sb content in the lattice. BaPbO3 presented the lowest relative roughness factor and BaPb0.7Sb0.3O3 the highest one. However, the variation of this parameter is not linear with Sb content. These oxides were used as anodes in the oxidation of the Direct Red 80 dye, at applied current densities of 5.0 and 7.5 mA cm(-2). All the materials have promoted the complete color removal of the dye solutions, being the highest chemical oxygen demand removal rate obtained with the BaPbO3 perovskite. There is a partial change in the degradation mechanism when part of the Pb content of the BaPbO3 perovskite is substituted by Sb. (C) 2014 The Electrochemical Society.

BiVO4 Photoanodes for TEMPO-Mediated Benzyl Alcohol Oxidation in Organic Media								CHEMPLUSCHEM				87	10					e202200187	10.1002/cplu.202200187		AUG 2022		OCT 2022	2022	The photoelectrochemical production of fuels, exemplified by light-driven water splitting to hydrogen and oxygen, offers a sustainable option to offset dependence on fossil fuels. A low-cost, efficient, and stable photoelectrochemical approach to solar fuels remains elusive but using similar materials and photoelectrodes for chemical production or biomass conversion offers an appealing alternative. This work reports a facile method for fabricating pristine (undoped) BiVO4 photoanodes to carry out TEMPO-mediated benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzaldehyde in organic media (TEMPO=2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyl-N-oxyl). The best performing BiVO4 photoanode studied here gave a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 85 +/- 5% for benzaldehyde formation in the presence of TEMPO and pyridine during a 2.5-hour reaction. Compared with direct electrocatalytic conversion under the same conditions, light capture and conversion by the BiVO4 surface decreased the required applied bias by 46 %. To our knowledge, this is the first report of visible light assisted, TEMPO-mediated benzyl alcohol oxidation using pristine BiVO4 photoanodes in organic media.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2192-6506			WOS:000846897800001	36036540

Herein, oxygen-substituted ultrathin porous graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets are prepared through a two-step hydrothermal-recalcination treatment of bulk g-C3N4 (BCN), and it is found that the obtained samples display enhanced ROS generation, as reflected by the removal of oxytetracycline hydrochloride (OTC). When stimulated by visible light, about 85.76% of OTC can be removed by the optimal sample (OCN-24-550) within 120 min, which is obviously higher than that of bulk g-C3N4 by a factor of 4.99. Meanwhile, nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) transformation and H2O2 generation also indicate that the OCN-24-550 possess the highest reactivity, which can produce 47.25 mu M of H2O2 and 9.07 x 10(-1)0 M of the steady-state center dot O-2(-) during the reaction. The enhanced photocatalytic performance of OCN-24-550 is attributed to the synergistic effect of ultrathin porous structure and heteroatom O substitution. Specifically, the ultrathin porous structure can enlarge the surface area and then facilitate the diffusion of reactant, while the O substitution can optimize the electronic structure by creating a local electronic polarization effect, as confirmed by density functional theory (DFF) calculations, and thus result in a boosted exciton dissociation and accelerated charge migration. This work not only presents a comprehensive insight into g-C3N4-based reaction system from exciton and charge carrier, but also provides a meaningful guidance for exploring novel photocatalytic wastewater treatment devices from a more environment-friendly perspective.									90	2	0	0	37	0	90			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000507465200130

One energy storage scheme of great interest is splitting water to form hydrogen and oxygen gas and converting back to electrical energy by their subsequent recombination with only water as a byproduct. However, kinetic limitations to the rate of oxygen-based electrochemical reactions hamper the efficiency in technologies such as solar fuels, fuel cells, and electrolyzers. For these reactions, the use of metal oxides as electrocatalysts is prevalent due to their stability, low cost, and ability to store oxygen within the lattice. However, due to the inherently convoluted nature of electrochemical and chemical processes in electrochemical systems, it is difficult to isolate and study individual electrochemical processes in a complex system. Therefore, in situ characterization tools are required for observing related physical and chemical processes directly at the places where and while they occur and can help elucidate the mechanisms of charge separation and charge transfer at electrochemical interfaces. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), also known as ESCA (electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis), has been used as a quantitative spectroscopic technique that measures the elemental composition, as well as chemical and electronic state of a material. Building from extensive ex situ characterization of electrochemical systems, initial in situ studies were conducted at or near ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions (<= 10(-6) Torr) to probe solid-state electrochemical systems. However, through the integration of differential-pumping stages, XPS can now operate at pressures in the torr range, comprising a technique called ambient pressure XPS (AP-XPS).In this Account, we briefly review the working principles and current status of AP-XPS. We use several recent in situ studies on model electrochemical components as well as operando studies performed by our groups at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to illustrate that AP-XPS is both a chemically and an electrically specific tool since photoelectrons carry information on both the local chemistry and electrical potentials. The applications of AP-XPS to oxygen electrocatalysis shown in this Account span well-defined studies of (1) the oxide/oxygen gas interface, (2) the oxide/water vapor interface, and (3) operand measurements of half and full electrochemical cells. Using specially designed model devices, we can expose and isolate the electrode or interface of interest to the incident X-ray beam and AP-XPS analyzer to relate the electrical potentials to the composition/chemical state of the key components and interfaces. We conclude with an outlook on new developments of AP-XPS end stations, which may provide significant improvement in the observation of dynamics over a wide range of time scales, higher spatial resolution, and improved characterization of boundary or interface layers (solid/solid and liquid/solid).									66	3	0	0	5	0	68			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000365150500019	26305627

The electrochemical behavior of the composite anode was studied by cyclic voltammetry, anodic polarization, EIS and corrosion resistant test under simulated zinc electrowinning conditions. The results show that nano-carbon materials enhanced Pb composite anodes show excellent electrocatalysis for OER and their stable overpotential are lower than that of pure Pb anode by more than 96 mV at the current density of 500 A/m(2). The electrochemical catalytic performance of 2-dimensional nano-carbon materials is not as well as that of 0-dimensional nano-carbon materials, and the 1-dimensional ones have the best performance among them. After modified with functional groups or decorated with functional particles on the surface of 1-dimensional nano-carbon materials, the increase of electrochemical catalytic performance is significant.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1002-185X			WOS:000752491900038

For this matter, a series of Febased NPMC electrocatalysts have been prepared from different carbon sources, carbon black and multiwalled carbon nanotubes. The catalysts have been subjected to chemical treatments in 0.5 M H2SO4 and thoroughly characterized. Their performance for the ORR in different electrolytes e.g. HCIO4, H2SO4, CF3SO3H, KOH and NaOH has been.studied. Higher ORR rates have been recorded in the alkaline electrolytes as compared to the acid ones. Remarkably, the effect of the electrolyte is almost negligible when measured at a given pH value; i.e., the ORR performance is not affected by the nature of the anion when measured in acid electrolytes or the cation when measured in alkaline electrolytes. On the other hand, the activity of NPMCs for the ORR decreases remarkably after treatment of the catalysts in 0.5 M H2SO4. This effect accounts to both the removal of active sites for the ORR during acid treatment and to the blockage of active sites due to the presence of adsorbed sulfates. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The negative interface formation energies suggest the formation of CdZnHT is exothermic. The bandgap of CdZnHT is favorable for absorbing visible light, and the decent band edge position makes it thermodynamically feasible for spontaneous generation of oxygen and hydrogen. The formed electric field across the interface induced by charge transfer will reduce photogenerated carrier recombination and promote carrier migration. Particularly, CdZnHT is a type-II heterostructure. Oxygen generation takes place at ZnO layer and hydrogen production occurs at CdS layer, which will also promote the effective separation and migration of phogogenerated carriers and enhance photocatalytic performance. These findings suggest that 2D CdZnHTs are possible candidates as water-splitting photocatalysts.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000573476400001	32931462

Herein, we develop a template-assisted method to synthesize a series of single metal atoms anchored on porous N,S-codoped carbon (NSC) matrix as highly efficient ORR catalysts to investigate the correlation between the structure and their catalytic performance. The structure analysis indicates that an identical synthesis method results in distinguished structural differences between Fe-centered single-atom catalyst (Fe-SAs/NSC) and Co-centered/Ni-centered single-atom catalysts (Co-SAs/NSC and Ni-SAs/NSC) because of the different trends of each metal ion in forming a complex with the N,S-containing precursor during the initial synthesis process. The Fe-SAs/NSC mainly consists of a well-dispersed FeN4S2 center site where S atoms form bonds with the N atoms. The S atoms in Co-SAs/NSC and Ni-SAs/NSC, on the other hand, form metal-S bonds, resulting in CoN3S1 and NiN3S1 center sites. Density functional theory (DFT) reveals that the FeN4S2 center site is more active than the CoN3S1 and NiN3S1 sites, due to the higher charge density, lower energy barriers of the intermediates, and products involved. The experimental results indicate that all three single-atom catalysts could contribute high ORR electrochemical performances, while Fe-SAs/NSC exhibits the highest of all, which is even better than commercial Pt/C. Furthermore, Fe-SAs/NSC also displays high methanol tolerance as compared to commercial Pt/C and high stability up to 5000 cycles. This work provides insights into the rational design of the definitive structure of single-atom catalysts with tunable electrocatalytic activities for efficient energy conversion.									366	32	0	0	25	0	374			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000505627300028	31804069

Pioneer 8500), soybean (Glycine max L. cv. Flyer) and eastern gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides L.) during experimental sun and shade periods simulating summer cloud cover. Leaf gas exchange measurements of field plants showed that short-term (5 min) shading of leaves to 300-400 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) photosynthetic photon flux density reduced photosynthesis, leaf temperature, stomatal conductance, transpiration and water use efficiency and increased intercellular CO2 partial pressure. In all species, photosynthetic recovery was delayed when leaves were reilluminated, apparently by stomatal closure. The strongest stomatal response was in soybean. Photosynthetic recovery was studied further with soybeans grown indoors (maximum photosynthetic photon flux density 1200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). Plants grown indoors had responses to shade similar to those of field plants, except for brief nonstomatal limitation immediately after reillumination. These responses indicated the importance of the light environment during leaf development on assimilation responses to variable light, and suggested different limitations on carbon assimilation in different parts of the soybean canopy. Photosynthetic oxygen evolution recovered immediately upon reillumination, indicating that the light reactions did not limit soybean photosynthetic recovery. While shade periods caused stomatal closure and reduced carbon gain and water loss in all species, the consequences for carbon gain/water loss were greatest in soybean. The occurrence of stomatal closure in all three species may arise from their shared phenologies and herbaceous growth forms.									18	2	0	0	16	0	20			0031-9317	1399-3054		WOS:A1995RU93100011

The as-fabricated Ni-P foam consists of Ni2P skeletons covered with vertically aligned Ni5P4-NiP2 nanosheets. When used as a self-supported anode to catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), it exhibits exceptionally high catalytic current density (191.0 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of eta = 0.35 V) and outstanding long-term stability and durability (affording 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.45 V vs. RHE for 26 h without degradation). Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffractometry analyses show that during the galvanostatic OER electrolysis the surface Ni-P nanosheets are transformed to nickel oxide/hydroxide (NiO/Ni(OH)(x)), forming a Ni-P/NiO(Ni(OH)(x)) heterojunction on ligament surfaces of the porous Ni-P foam which would enhance the OER performance. The synergistic effect between Ni-P and NiO/Ni(OH)(x) is also confirmed by control experiments with self-supported NiO and Ni(OH)(2) nanosheet electrodes. An alkaline electrolyzer has been built using two identical self-supported porous Ni-P foams as the anode and cathode, respectively. The electrolyzer exhibits superior electrolysis efficiency of 90.2% at 10 mA cm(-2), and can maintain sufficiently high efficiency of 72.2% even at 100 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the electrolyzer is substantially durable when working at 10 and 20 mA cm(-2), splitting water constantly up to 1000 h with only a minor variation in the cell's voltage. The self-supported porous Ni-P foam holds substantial promise for use as both cathode and anode in industrial alkaline water electrolyzers.									183	5	0	0	3	0	185			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000374790400033

The titanium room temperature dissolution mechanism in chlorinated acidic medium (pH < 0) is not fundamentally modified by oxygen. Deduced from the 'current-potential' and 'valence-potential' curves, it is based on four crucial elementary steps leading to two branches: a so-called active branch corresponding to a trivalent dissolution (its effect is inversely proportional to the pH), and a passive branch (TiO2 Oxide formation with a very limited tetravalent dissolution). In hydrothermal oxidation (pH > 1), only the second. branch is effective. The titanium protection is directly related to the oxide stability in high pH systems. The mechanism model is expressed in terms of 'current -potential' laws, which provide kinetic parameters using optimization calculations. The different elementary steps reaction rates were estimated as well as the evolution of the reaction intermediates coverage ratios with the potential. The quantification of each elementary step was performed to understand and/or orient the materials behavior according to different factors (pH, chloride ions contents, potentials...).

Stimulated emission pumping enabled preparation of individual vibrational states of O2(X3SIGMA(g),19 less-than-or-equal-to v less-than-or-equal-to 27) and laser induced fluorescence was used to follow the time evolution of the prepared states and thereby determine the vibrational-state-specific total-removal rate-constants for relaxation by O2 and N2 at 295K. Self-relaxation shows a sharp threshold for enhanced relaxation near the energy of O2(X3SIGMA(g)-, v=26) which is coincident with the energetic threshold for reaction (2). The magnitudes of the self-relaxation rate constants for O2(X3SIGMA(g), v=26 and 27) are quantitatively consistent with the kinetic parameters of reaction (2). Relaxation by N2, while important for lower O2 vibrational states, is shown to be about 10 and 200 times slower than self relaxation for v=26 and v=27, respectively. These are the first two vibrational states of O2 that could form O3 via reaction (2).									69	0	0	0	1	0	69			0094-8276	1944-8007		WOS:A1993MQ17300026

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) featured with porosity, crystallinity, and tunable constitution offer enormous potential in photocatalytic applications. Herein, a critical overview of MOFs-based photocatalysts is presented. Following a concise introduction of the structural characteristics of MOFs, the synthesis methods of MOFs-based photocatalysts are summarized. Moreover, subtle modification strategies for MOFs inspired by the development of other inorganic photocatalysts are also discussed on the basis of the photocatalytic mechanisms of light absorption, electron transfer, and surface catalytic reactions. Furthermore, the applications of certain MOFs-based photocatalysts are introduced in detail. In addition, other organic frameworks-based photocatalytic materials, such as covalent organic frameworks and covalent triazine frameworks, are also described to provide a guided insight into the rational design and fabrication of efficient frameworks-based photocatalysts. Finally, a brief conclusion and perspective on the opportunities and challenges for the future development of MOFs-based photocatalysts are proposed.									12	0	0	0	2	0	12			2367-198X			WOS:000503202200001

Ferguson, Jason W/A-7735-2009; Weiss, Achim/C-4870-2013				New asymptotic giant branch models for a range of metallicities								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				508	3			1343	U313		10.1051/0004-6361/200912043				DEC 2009	2009	We present a new grid of stellar model calculations for stars on the Asymptotic Giant Branch between 1.0 and 6.0 M-circle dot. Our grid consists of 10 chemical mixtures with 5 metallicities between Z = 0.0005 and Z = 0.04, and with both solar-like and alpha-element enhanced metal ratios for each metallicity. We treat consistently the carbon-enhancement of the stellar envelopes by using opacity tables with varying C/O-ratio and by employing theoretical mass loss rates for carbon stars. The low temperature opacities have been calculated specifically for this project. For oxygen stars we use an empirical mass loss formalism. The third dredge-up is naturally obtained by including convective overshooting. Our models reach effective temperatures in agreement with earlier synthetic models, which included approximative carbon-enriched molecular opacities and show good agreement with empirically determined carbon-star lifetimes. A fraction of the models could be followed into the post-AGB phase, for which we provide models in a mass range supplementing previous post-AGB calculations. Our grid constitutes the most extensive set of AGB-models, calculated with the latest physical input data and treating carbon-enhancement due to the third dredge-up most consistently.									126	0	1	0	0	1	127			1432-0746			WOS:000273057300025

The structures and properties of synthesized materials were systematically investigated. The characterization results revealed that LNO nanoparticles were encapsulated in RGO sheets with meso-macroporous framework, which was beneficial to the adsorption and diffusion of methanol and further promote to the capture of photogenerated holes. The anchoring effect of oxygen vacancies and chemical bonding reactions between LNO and RGO contributed to the encapsulated structure. The forming NieC bond produced to the strong interaction between LNO and RGO, which acted as a bridge to promote the effective separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. The as-prepared LNO-RGO nanoreactors presented high performance of photocatalytic activity and stability for H-2 evolution from water in the presence of methanol as a scavenger. A maximum H2 production rate of 3.22 mmol h(-1) g(-1) was obtained over a LNO-5% RGO photocatalyst which was 12 times higher than that of pure LNO with excellent long-term stability for 36 h.									42	2	0	0	5	0	42			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000447004100059

LCFCr has also been shown to be a very active catalyst for CO2/CO reactions at the fuel electrode, thus making it a good candidate for use in symmetrical RSOFCs. In the present work, GDC and GDC + LCFCr polymeric precursor solutions were infiltrated into a porous LCFCr scaffold to further enhance the performance, producing a high surface area, nanoporous coating on the LCFCr surface. GDC infiltration resulted in a ca. 2-fold decrease in polarization resistance, specifically lowering the high frequency resistance, which is associated with the electrode/electrolyte interface. When the porous LCFCr electrode structure was co-infiltrated with GDC + LCFCr, the resistance of both the high and low frequency processes decreased, which according to our model, indicates that the quality of both the electrode/electrolyte (high frequency) and solid/gas (low frequency) interfaces were improved. Overall, it was shown to be possible to reduce the polarization resistance of the LCFCr air electrode by up to ca. 2.5 times using these infiltration approaches. (C) The Author(s) 2017.

A similar phenomenon is observed with the acridine-induced petit mutant. Cytochromes P450 EC 1.14.14.1 (and mimics) display a range of redox iron-mediated bioconversions in food processing, with mixed function oxidase (O-2:mono-oxygenase) intervention results. Unfortunately these enzymes generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) through redox electron recycling, whilst isoform CYP 1A1 can activate precarcinogens such as benzo(a)pyrene to the ultimate (proximate) carcinogen that binds to nuclear DNA.Conclusions: In conclusion, another 5000 CYP isoforms, for example, might be identified in micro-organisms and many more made to order through recombinant DNA technology and utilized both in vitro and in vivo for aimed bioconversions in industry and in the environment, as part of the impact of greener-approach supporting strategies to minimize global pollution.									8	0	0	0	4	0	8			0266-8254			WOS:000184616500014	12904231

As a proof-of-concept, the optimized SCF-800 perovskite (SrCo0.5Fe0.5O3 (delta) prepared with a calcination temperature of 800 degrees C) shows prominent OER activity (e.g., 327 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) on a glassy carbon electrode in 0.1 M KOH), outperforming the benchmark noble-metal RuO2 and ranking the highest among perovskite-based catalysts reported to date. Experimental results reveal that the reduced particle size (increased surface area) due to a lower calcination temperature provides more active sites, and that the favorable electronic structure with high covalency of metal-oxygen bonds, as demonstrated by advanced soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS), contributes to the intrinsic activity enhancement. This work provides a new and facile way for improving the catalytic performance via only regulating preparation conditions.									23	1	0	0	0	0	23			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000526953200047

This results in gradual increases in smoke and dust emissions, which seriously affect the ecological and geological environment of the mining area. To avoid spontaneous combustion of the residual coal, protect the resources and ecology of mining areas, and investigate the influence of the deep thermal environment on the microstructure and oxidation properties of coal, the pore evolution characteristics and functional group migration of coal in a thermal environment were studied by N-2 adsorption and infrared spectroscopy. A temperature-programmed test system was used to simulate the low-temperature oxidation process occurring in deep coal seams, and the heat release characteristics and oxidation kinetic parameters of the index gas were calculated. The experimental results revealed that the pore oxygen storage capacities and coal oxygen contact areas of residual coal in deep mines are larger than those of coal in shallow seams. As the preheating temperature is increased, the rates of CO and CO2 production and the amount of oxygen consumed in oxidation of heat-treated coal increase. The crossing point temperature (CPT) of heat-treated coal decreases. The deep thermal environment accelerates the rate of condensation decomposition of the aliphatic hydrocarbon groups in coal and fracture of side chain hydrogen bonds connecting strong electron-absorbing groups, which increases the exothermic intensity of the oxidation process. The reaction trigger temperatures for aliphatic hydrocarbon groups, peroxyl radicals, associative hydrogen bonds and other active groups in coal are different. With increasing ambient temperature, the types of active groups in coal increase, and the contents accumulate. With an increase in the deep geothermal temperature, the oxidation activity of coal is enhanced, and the coal is more prone to spontaneous combustion. These research results provide a theoretical reference for deep coal clean mining and prevention of spontaneous combustion disasters and have a potential guiding role in environmental protection and ecological improvement of deep mining areas.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0959-6526	1879-1786		WOS:000863092500003

Additionally, bifunctional characteristics give an added benefit for the overall water splitting. Herein, we report the synthesis and fabrication of Fe-doped Cu/Cu3P supported on a flexible carbon cloth (CC) with a hydrophilic surface for efficient bifunctional water electrolysis under alkaline conditions. Surface doping of Fe in the hexagonal Cu3P does not alter the lattice parameters, but it promotes the surface metallicity by stimulating Cu delta+ and Cu-0 sites in Cu3P, resulting in an augmented electroactive surface area. Cu2.75Fe0.25P composition exhibits unprecedented OER activity with a low overpotential of 470 mV at 100 mA cm(-2). Under a two electrode electrolyzer system the oxygen and hydrogen gas was evolved with an unprecedented rate at their respective electrode made of same catalyst. Density functional theory further elucidates the role of the Fe center toward electronic state modulation, which eventually alters the entire adsorption behavior of the reaction intermediates and reduces the overpotential on Fe-doped system over pristine Cu3P.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000566813600009	32820761

The phase and morphology evolution of the oxide nanofiber are characterized by Thermo-gravimetric-Differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-TR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. The results show that PLNCG nanofiber with an average diameter of 420 nm is produced after sintering the precursors at 950 degrees C for 5 h. The nanofiber cathode is formed with mesh-like morphology and keep good contact with the Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta (CGO) electrolyte after heat-treated at 1 000 degrees C for 2 h. The electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) results indicate that the nanofiber cathode exhibits superior performance than the powder cathode. The polarization resistance (R-P) of the nanofiber cathode is 0.134 Omega center dot cm(2) at 700 degrees C in air, which is 32% less than the PLNCG powder cathode (R-p=0.197 Omega center dot cm(2)). The maximum power density of electrolyte-support single cell with PLNCG nanofiber cathode (Ni-CGO/CGO/PLNCG) reaches 231 mW center dot cm(-2) at 700 degrees C. The oxygen partial pressure measurement indicates that the charge transfer process is the reaction rate limiting step of the nanofiber cathode.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1001-4861			WOS:000429758300004

As platinum nanoparticles have served as the catalysts of choice towards ORR, minimizing the cost of the catalysts by diminishing the platinum nanoparticle size has become a critical route to advancing the technological development. Herein, first-principle calculations show that carbon-supported Pt-9 clusters represent the threshold domain size, and the ORR activity can be significantly improved by doping of adjacent cobalt atoms. This is confirmed experimentally, where platinum and cobalt are dispersed in nitrogen-doped carbon nanowires in varied forms, single atoms, few-atom clusters, and nanoparticles, depending on the initial feeds. The sample consisting primarily of Pt-2(-7) clusters doped with atomic Co species exhibits the best mass activity among the series, with a current density of 4.16 A mg(pt)(-1) at +0.85 V vs. RHE that is almost 50 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12				2639-5274		WOS:000587303100001	33623914

Inorganic chemistry											10.1021/acs.inorgchem.2c03431				2022-Oct-28	2022	The rational design of 2D polyoxometalate-based metal-organic framework (POMOF) nanosheets on a conductive substrate as a self-supporting electrode is highly attractive but a great challenge. Herein is the first demonstration of POMOF nanopillar arrays consisting of 2D nanosheets as a self-supported electrode for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic conditions. Single-crystal X-ray analysis reveal that our as-prepared 2D [Co2(TIB)2(PMo12O40)]·Cl·4H2O [named CoMo-POMOF; TIB = 1,3,5-tris(1-imidazoly)benzene] crystalline materials are connected by Co-alpha-Keggin polymolybdate units act as secondary building blocks and TIB as the organic ligands. The 2D CoMo-POMOF nanosheets were successfully arrayed on a conductive nickel foam substrate by a facile CoO nanorod template-assisted strategy. Remarkably, the CoMo-POMOF nanopillar arrays demonstrate superior electrocatalytic performance toward the HER with an overpotential of 137 mV and Tafel slope of 59 mV dec-1 at 10 mA cm-2, which are comparable to those of state-of-the-art POMOF-based electrocatalysts. Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the exposed bridging oxygen active sites (Oa) of Co-alpha-Keggin polymolybdate units in CoMo-POMOF optimize the Gibbs free energy of H* adsorption (DeltaGH* = -0.11 eV) and increase the intrinsic HER activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1520-510X		MEDLINE:36306476	36306476

A conventional carbon supported Pt catalyst was used as cathode. An excellent performance, of 4 A cm(-2) at 1.9 V at 90 degrees C, was achieved for this electrolyser configuration in the presence of a moderate noble metal loading (1.5 mg cm(-2) Ir + Ru; 0.5 mg cm(-2) Pt). The interface of IrRuOx with Aquivion provided a 10% enhancement in performance compared to an equivalent interface with a Nafion membrane of similar thickness but characterized by a larger equivalent weight (EW: 1100 g/eq). The enhanced performance essentially derived from a decrease of polarization resistance. This appeared to be due to better interface characteristics between the electrodes and Aquivion (R) ionomer giving rise to an increased catalyst utilization. Whereas, no significant change in Tafel slope and activation energy was recorded indicating a similar reaction mechanism. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

In this work, single-atom-V catalysts (V SACs) substitutions in 1T-WS2 monolayers (91% phase purity) are fabricated to significantly enhance the HER performance via a one-step chemical vapor deposition strategy. Atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging together with Raman spectroscopy confirm the atomic dispersion of V species on the 1T-WS2 monolayers instead of energetically favorable 2H-WS2 monolayers. The growth mechanism of V SACs@1T-WS2 monolayers is experimentally and theoretically demonstrated. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the activated V-atom sites play vital important role in enhancing the HER activity. In this work, it opens a novel path to directly synthesize atomically dispersed single-metal catalysts on metastable materials as efficient and robust electrocatalysts. Ru is one of the most active metals for oxygen evolution reaction, but it quickly dissolves in acidic electrolyte particularly in nanosized form. Here the authors show that coral-like solid-solution RuIr consisting of 3nm-thick sheets with only 6at% Ir is a long-lived catalyst with high activity									66	1	0	0	3	0	65				2041-1723		WOS:000684846200008	33514706

The approach allows probing catalysts inside operating fuel cells with atomic-level precision (similar to 0.02 angstrom) and element specificity (similar to 2-3 at%) in both time (similar to 1 min) and space (similar to mu m) resolved manner. The approach is demonstrated on exemplary Pd-Sn and Pt-Ni-Cu nanoalloy catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) deposited on the cathode of an operating proton exchange membrane fuel cell. In operando x-ray data show that under operating conditions, the catalyst particles can undergo specific structural changes, ranging from sub-A atomic fluctuations and sharp nanophase transitions to a gradual strain relaxation and growth, which inflict significant losses in their ORR activity. Though triggered electrochemically, the changes are not driven solely by differences in the reduction potential and surface energy of the metallic species constituting the nanoalloys but also by the formation energy of competing nanophases, mismatch between the size of individual atomic species and their ability to interdiffuse fast in search of energetically favorable configurations. Given their complexity, the changes are difficult to predict and so the resulting ORR losses remain difficult to limit. We show that in operando knowledge of the structural evolution of nanoalloy catalysts helps create strategies for improving their activity and stability. In particular, we show that shaping Pd-Sn nanoalloys rich in Pd as cubes reduces the interdiffusion of atoms at their surface and so makes them better catalysts for ORR in fuel cells in comparison to other Pd-Sn nanoalloys. In addition, we demonstrate that the approach introduced here can provide knowledge of other major factors affecting the performance of fuel cells such as operating temperature and the overall catalyst utilization, in particular the evolution of elemental and mass distribution of catalyst particles over the cells' cathode. Last but not least, we discuss how in operando x-ray spectroscopy and total x-ray scattering can bridge the knowledge gap between the widely used in situ SAXS, EXAFS and monocrystal surface XRD techniques for structural characterization of nanoalloy catalysts explored for energy related applications.									10	1	0	0	0	0	11			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000434829500026

The molten salt was changed into Li2O-LiCl-KCl to decrease the operation temperature to 550 degrees C at which the boron doped diamond was chemically stable. The potential for oxygen evolution on the boron doped diamond electrode was determined to be approximately 2.2 V vs. a Li-Pb reference electrode whereas that for Li deposition was around -0.58 V. The density of the anodic current was low compared to that of the cathodic current. Thus the potential of the cathode might not reach the potential for Li deposition if the surface area of the cathode is too wide compared to that of the anode. Therefore, the ratio of the surface areas of the cathode and anode should be precisely controlled. Because the reduction of UO2 is dependent on the reaction with Li, the deposition of Li is a prerequisite in the reduction process. In a consecutive reduction run, it was proved that the boron doped diamond could be employed as an inert anode. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Non-noble transition metals are the most promising candidates for the replacement of conventional Pt group catalysts for the HER. Herein, we constructed two isostructural Ni/Co(II) MOFs based on nitrogen heterocyclic ligands, that is, 4-(4-(5-(pyridin-4-yl)-4H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)phenyl)pyridine (PPPT), pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA), and nickel nitrate or cobalt nitrate. After high-temperature calcination in a nitrogen atmosphere, Ni-MOF/NC-T (NC is nitrogen-doped carbon) and Co-MOF/NC-T were obtained. Ni-MOF/NC-800 shows a good HER performance. The overpotential of Ni-MOF/NC-800 was 369 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) current density. The Tafel slope was 127.1 mV dec(-1) for NiMOF/NC-800, Meanwhile, the HER performance of Co-MOF/NC-700 is slightly worse than that of NiMOF/NC-800. This work provides an idea for the simple synthesis of HER catalysts with better performance. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

However, there are numerous scientific challenges in developing these technologies. These include finding suitable materials for the absorption of incident photons, developing more efficient catalysts for both water splitting and the production of fuels, and understanding how interfaces between catalysts, photoabsorbers and electrolytes can be designed to minimize losses and resist degradation. In this Review, we highlight recent milestones in these areas and some key scientific challenges remaining between the current state of the art and a technology that can effectively convert sunlight into fuels and chemicals.									857	44	0	0	60	1	863			1476-1122	1476-4660		WOS:000391343300015	27994241

When the small amount of Pt atoms decorated on O-PdFe/C surface forming O-PdFe@Pt/C core-shell structure, the sublayer of Pd and Fe atoms may cause the lattice contraction of surface Pt and then weak the bonding energy on O-PdFe@Pt/C catalyst relative to bulk Pt/C, which is further illustrated by density functional theory (DFT) calculation. The weakened oxygen affinity results in the enhancement of ORR performance on O-PdFe@Pt/C. For a practical application, the well-constructed O-PdFe@Pt/C exhibits higher voltage and peak power density than D-PdFe@Pt/C and Pt/C when applied as the air-breathing cathode material in Zn-air battery.									53	7	0	0	1	0	55			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000438076200009

It is generally considered a favorable characteristic, because it increases the catalytically active surface area. However, the effect of nanoporosity on the intrinsic activity and stability of a nanoparticle electrocatalyst has remained unclear. Here, we present a facile atmosphere-controlled acid leaching technique to control the formation of nanoporosity in Pt-Ni bimetallic nanoparticles. By statistical analysis of particle size, composition, nanoporosity, and atomic-scale core-shell fine structures before and after electrochemical stability test, we uncover that nanoporosity formation in particles larger than ca. 10 nm is intrinsically tied to a drastic dissolution of Ni and, as a result of this, a rapid drop in intrinsic catalytic activity during ORR testing, translating into severe catalyst performance degradation. In contrast, O-2-free acid leaching enabled the suppression of nanoporosity resulting in more solid core-shell particle architectures with thin Pt-enriched shells; surprisingly, such particles maintained high intrinsic activity and improved catalytic durability under otherwise identical ORR tests. On the basis of these findings, we suggest that catalytic stability could further improve by controlling the particle size below ca. 10 nm to avoid nanoporosity. Our findings provide an explanation for the degradation of bimetallic particle ensembles and show an easy to implement pathway toward more durable fuel cell cathode catalysts.									234	11	0	0	10	0	237			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000316243800042	23360425

The catalyst films were tested for activity in water oxidation over a range of neutral to alkaline pH. The onset of water oxidation in case of the nanostructured MnO2 films is found at an overpotential (h) of 300 mV at pH 13.6 (1.0 M NaOH), with current densities reaching 10 mA cm(-2) at eta = 500 mV. The screen-printed MnO2 (nano) is one of the most active manganese oxide-based catalysts reported to date, despite consisting mostly of the common pyrolusite (beta-MnO2) phase, so far generally found inactive in water oxidation. The films prepared from commercial beta-MnO2 were found to be moderately active, with an onset of water oxidation at eta = 500 mV (pH 13.6), and currents up to 5 mA cm(-2) at eta = 800 mV. At pH 6, the two samples exhibit similar activity and also match or surpass the performance of recent benchmark manganese oxides. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) studies suggest that the crystal phase is unchanged after prolonged electrochemical cycling. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis indicates very little corrosion of the surface morphology after prolonged catalyst operation at alkaline pH. However, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis shows the formation of a small amount of an amorphous phase on the surface of the nanorods after oxygen evolution over 12 hours in alkaline media.									139	4	0	0	12	0	139			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000320779700024

Recently developed in situ and/or operando methods are gaining increasing interest as judicious tools for investigations of heterogeneous electrocatalysis. In this Perspective, recent applications of various in situ characterization techniques in tracking the structural reconstruction of the catalysts, identifying real active sites, and recording intermediates formed during water electrolysis and CO2 reduction reaction are thoroughly summarized. Finally, on the basis of the unique capabilities as well as limitations of each in situ or operando technique, we established an "in situ probing map" for the corresponding in situ technologies in liquid-solid interfaces and offer guidelines for the successful development of next-generation efficient catalysts.									164	8	0	0	5	1	166			2380-8195			WOS:000526315900034

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) can maximize the atom utilization efficiency, thus offering a promising strategy for reducing the cost of electrode materials. In this work, we systematically explored the alkaline HOR performance of single noble metal and 3d transition metal atoms anchored on the divacancy graphene (M/G, M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Pt) by first-principles density functional theory calculations. The calculations suggested that the alkaline HOR on M/Gs proceeds through the Heyrovsky-Volmer mechanism with the Heyrovsky reaction as the rate-determining step. Both the full free energy profile and H adsorption free energy indicate that all considered M/Gs show superb HOR activity in the order Cr/G < Fe/G < Co/G < Ni/G < Mn/G < Pt/G. However, only Pt/G and Ni/G can maintain high electrochemical stability at the HOR operating potentials, while Mn/G, Cr/G, Fe/G, and Co/G easily suffer from oxidation. Therefore, both Pt/G and Ni/G SACs are promising candidates as anodic HOR electrocatalysts for AFCs.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000729860000001

Thermochemical kinetics								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				664						A82	10.1051/0004-6361/202142816				AUG 10 2022	2022	Context. Growing evidence has indicated that the global composition distribution plays an indisputable role in interpreting observational data. Three-dimensional general circulation models (GCMs) with a reliable treatment of chemistry and clouds are particularly crucial in preparing for upcoming observations. In attempts to achieve 3D chemistry-climate modeling, the challenge mainly lies in the expensive computing power required for treating a large number of chemical species and reactions.Aims. Motivated by the need for a robust and computationally efficient chemical scheme, we devise a mini-chemical network with a minimal number of species and reactions for H-2-dominated atmospheres.Methods. We apply a novel technique to simplify the chemical network from a full kinetics model, VULCAN, by replacing a large number of intermediate reactions with net reactions. The number of chemical species is cut down from 67 to 12, with the major species of thermal and observational importance retained, including H2O, CH4, CO, CO2, C2H2, NH3 and HCN. The size of the total reactions is also greatly reduced, from similar to 800 to 20. We validated the mini-chemical scheme by verifying the temporal evolution and benchmarking the predicted compositions in four exoplanet atmospheres (GJ 1214b, GJ 436b, HD 189733b, and HD 209458b) against the full kinetics of VULCAN.Results. The mini-network reproduces the chemical timescales and composition distributions of the full kinetics well within an order of magnitude for the major species in the pressure range of 1 bar-0.1 mbar across various metallicities and carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratios.Conclusions. We have developed and validated a mini-chemical scheme using net reactions to significantly simplify a large chemical network. The small scale of the mini-chemical scheme permits simple use and fast computation, which is optimal for implementation in a 3D GCM or a retrieval framework. We focus on the thermochemical kinetics of net reactions in this paper and address photochemistry in a follow-up paper.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000838257200014

Here, a new nitrogen doped carbon dots (NDCDs)-AgNi alloy based electrocatalyst is used for electrochemical water splitting. NDCDs-AgNi alloy nanoparticles are synthesized by easy and scalable methods. NDCDs are prepared by pyrolizing ethanolamine and act as a good electrocatalyst for HER. Electrochemical activity of the catalyst is evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and linear swap voltammetry. The prepared electrocatalyst work well under acidic media. To enhance the catalytic performance of the material, the heat treatment at temperature from 300 degrees C to 500 degrees C is carried out. After series of optimizations, NDCDs-AgNi alloy demonstrated superior OER activity. The results show that the limiting current density has been increased and the heat treated samples shows HER phenomena. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Nevertheless, the catalytic efficiency of single-component TMPs is still restricted that cannot endure long-term running and easy to be corroded especially under harsh conditions. In this work, a multicomponent electrocatalyst combined with CoP/Ni2P heteronanoparticles and Co/Ni single-atom active sites (denoted as N-C@CoP/Ni2P) is rational designed and prepared. The obtained N-C@CoP/Ni2P electrode material exhibits enhanced performance with the overpotential of 153 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and the small Tafel value of 53.01 mV dec(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4, and a satisfied result is obtained in basic media as well. The outstanding HER performance is mainly benefiting from the synergistic effect between CoP and Ni2P, and the highly catalytic faction of atomic Co/Ni dual sites. Furthermore, a powerful conductive network fabricated by N-doped carbon skeleton and in-situ grown CNTs improves the conductivity of catalyst. Such a stereoscopic 3D nanostructure is also facile to accelerate the shuttle of electrons and ions. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The catalytic behavior of the treated and untreated surfaces has been interpreted both in terms of real surface area and surface structure evolution.The most active surface has been produced with a treating period time of 120 mm. Interestingly the maximum stability has been obtained with the sample produced with square wave potential with a period of 360 min with slightly lower initial performance.We have also found that the treated samples limit C-C cleavage, as compared to bare Pt, offering an effective strategy to minimize the formation of CO. Via in situ FTIR we have demonstrated that the major oxidation product is acetate. These findings are especially important in view of the application of Pt as a catalyst in alkaline direct ethanol fuel cells. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, a sludge-based biochar catalyst (GSC-P) was synthesized and used in photo-Fenton reaction for the degradation of MTO wastewater from the outlet of a biological aerated filter. More iron was distributed on the surface of GSC-P catalyst, facilitating the photo-Fenton oxidation of MTO wastewater, with chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rate of 75.4% and total organic carbon (TOC) removal rate of 62.5%. The 2223 unique molecular formulas assigned by a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) in the original MTO wastewater showed that CHO compounds shared the lowest peak numbers (20.2%) but the highest peak abundance (51.6%) among the four groups. Besides, lipids, unsaturated hydrocarbons, lignins and proteins were the main structural types. After photo-Fenton treatment of 60 min, there were 56.7%-74.0% of compounds removed by the analysis of van Krevelen diagram, indicating that the MTO wastewater was degraded efficiently. Three possible evolution processes of dissolved organic matters during the photo-Fenton reaction were disclosed at the molecular-level.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0045-6535	1879-1298		WOS:000853586000005	35944669

Here, the physiological responses of Wolffia globosa to AgNPs have been probed using different light schemes, and these data may reveal new insights into the toxic mechanism of AgNPs. W. globosa was grown in culture medium and treated with different concentrations of AgNPs for 24 h under pre- and post-illuminated conditions. However, fluorescence quenching, the accumulation of sugar and the reduction of Hill reaction activity were found in response to the AgNP-stresses. In the pre-illuminated condition, oxidative damage was obvious, as indicated by the higher malondialdehyde (MDA) content and an up-regulation of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. The maximum increases of MDA content and SOD activity were 1.14 and 2.52 times the respective controls when exposed to 10 mg/L AgNPs. In contrast, in the post-illuminated condition, the alterations in photosynthetic pigment and soluble proteins content were more significant than the alterations in oxidative stress. The contents of chlorophyll a, carotenoids and soluble protein decreased to 77.7%, 66.2% and 72.9% of the controls after treatment with the highest concentration of AgNPs (10 mg/L). Based on the different physiological responses, we speculated that in the pre-illuminated condition, oxidative stress was responsible for the decline in the oxygen evolution rate, while in the post-illuminated condition, the decrease in the Hill reaction activity could be attributed to the blocking of electron transfer and an insufficient proton supply. Our findings demonstrate that environmental factors regulate the physiological responses of plants to AgNPs through distinct mechanisms. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In our present work, porous LaNiO3 nanocubes were employed as electrocatalyst in Li-O-2 battery cell. The as-prepared battery showed excellent charging performance with significantly reduced overpotential (3.40 V). The synergistic effect of porous structure, large specific surface area and high electrocatalytic activity of porous LaNiO3 nanocubes ensured the Li-O-2 battery with enchanced capacity and good cycle stability. Furthermore, it was found that the lithium anode corrosion and cathode passivation were responsible for the capacity fading of Li-O-2 battery. Our results indicated that porous LaNiO3 nanocubes represent a promising cathode catalyst for Li-O-2 battery.									227	10	0	0	30	0	229			2045-2322			WOS:000340593300002	25103186

Here we report the Ni-Co-Mo-O nanosheets decorated with NiCo nanoparticles supported on NF (NF/NiCoMoO-H-2) as efficient HER electrocatalysts in alkaline media. The introduction of oxygen vacancies and multiple metal ions (Ni-Co-Mo-O nanosheets) accelerates water dissociation, while metal atoms (NiCo nanoparticles) promote the adsorption and association of hydrogen intermediates into H-2 molecules. The efficiently synergistic effect between Ni-Co-Mo-O nanosheets and NiCo nanoparticles results in the NF/NiCoMoO-H-2 with a low overpotential of 15 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 33.1 mV dec(-1). More importantly, the water-alkali electrolyzer using NF/NiCoMoO-H-2 as cathode and NF/NiFe-LDH as anode shows a low voltage of 1.44 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and remarkable stability. Owing to the controllable fabrication process and excellent HER performance, the NF/NiCoMoO-H-2 is a promising electrocatalyst for the practical water splitting.									41	1	0	0	1	0	42			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000487570000008

In this regard, we synthesized a series of mace-like g-C3N4-decorated Cs0.33WO3 nanocomposites for photocatalytic conversion of low concentration methane under mild conditions. The optimized g-C3N4@Cs0.33WO3 (weight ratio = 3:7) photocatalyst selectively converted low concentration methane (1000 ppm) into methanol with a yield of 4.38 mol/h/g under light irradiation and at room temperature. Both performance experiments and trapping experiments verified that methane activation and methyl oxidation were involved in the photocatalytic conversion process of methane. The O<bold>(2)</bold> first activated the methane to methyl on the surface of g-C3N4 in the composite and then the photogenerated electrons from the Cs0.33WO3 in the composite inhibited the peroxidation and increased the generation of methanol. This research provides a new route to design and synthesize photocatalysts for converting methane into value-added chemicals.									34	4	0	0	4	0	36			2168-0485			WOS:000459367400082

Al and Ca intercalated g-C3N4 photocatalysts with superior visible-light utilization and charge-carrier have been synthesized using one-step thermal condensation method. An enhanced visible-light harvesting capacity due to a red shift in the optical band gap of inserted g-C3N4 photocatalysts was observed. The charge-transfer, its kinetics across the interface and electron-hole pairs separations were systematically investigated using photoelectrochemical measurements. The evaluation of photocatalytic activity of Al and Ca intercalated g-C3N4 through degradation of RhB dye revealed 4.6 and 2.5 fold improvement in performance of g-C3N4. Al intercalated g-C3N4 shows highest photocurrent density, lowest Tafel slope and highest exchange-current density due to least recombination rate of photo generated charge-carriers, facile kinetics and least charge-transfer resistance without use of any noble metal co-catalyst towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with excellent stability.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			2365-6549			WOS:000449073200014

Using a surface directed vapor phase reaction, at relatively low temperature, we show that a highly reactive and volatile molecule can be used to selectively reduce the interface, without changing the bulk of the treated material, and without the need of alternating sequence of multiple precursors, normally involved in ALD. The model system we use to demonstrate the efficacy, and potential of our approach is trimethyl aluminum, and high energy Li and Mn rich cathode (HE-NCM) as the functional material of interest. We demonstrate that with the proposed method, the particles of HE-NMC were conformally coated with similar to 3 nm amorphous layer of the reduced surface in less than 1 h (including the cooling time), as witnessed using HR-TEM. XPS and solid-state NMR, further confirmed that surface treatment was successfully achieved using the proposed method and is well explained by DFT calculations. Utilizing online electrochemical mass spectrometry (OEMS), we show in-operando that this amorphous layer helps to suppress parasitic reactions under extreme electrochemical conditions as indicated by the significant reduction in oxygen and CO2 evolution. The surface treatment further resulted in enhancement in specific capacity during the first cycle. This methodology provides a non-conventional path to achieve thin layer surface modification under facile conditions, and opens a new way to meet the requirements of surface modification strategies for improving the performance of electrode materials without utilizing expensive instrumentation and high temperature processes.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			2405-8297			WOS:000469207500027

The CdS QDs-anchored MoO3/g-C3N4 heterostructure photocatalysts demonstrated enhanced visible-light absorption capacity, which was realized by the quantum confinement of the CdS QDs. The maximum photocatalytic hydrogen (H-2) production rate with the CdS QDs-anchored MoO3/g-C3N4 heterostructure photocatalysts reached 294.32 mu mol g(-1).h(-1), which was 76.84, 215.21, 27.12, and 3.64 folds superior as compare to bare g-C3N4, MoO3, CdS, and MoO3/g-C3N4 catalysts, respectively. The enriched photocatalytic performance was mainly credited to the high surface area and MoO3 with oxygen vacancies (OV), ultra-thin g-C3N4 and high optical adsorption ability of CdS QDs. Thus, forming a dual Z-scheme system in the CdS QDs-supported MoO3-OV/g-C3N4 nanostructures not only facilitated efficient interfacial charge transfer but also preserved the robust redox ability of the photoinduced electrons and holes.									23	1	0	0	3	0	24			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000582503700062

Herein, knittable fiber-shaped zinc-air batteries with high volumetric energy density (36.1 mWh cm(-3)) are fabricated via a facile and continuous method with low-cost materials. Furthermore, a high-yield method is developed to prepare the key component of the fiber-shaped zinc-air battery, i.e., a bifunctional catalyst composed of atomically thin layer-by-layer mesoporous Co3O4/nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) nanosheets. Benefiting from the high surface area, mesoporous structure, and strong synergetic effect between the Co3O4 and N-rGO nanosheets, the bifunctional catalyst exhibits high activity and superior durability for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. Compared to a fiber-shaped zinc-air battery using state-of-the-art Pt/C + RuO2 catalysts, the battery based on these Co3O4/N-rGO nanosheets demonstrates enhanced and stable electrochemical performance, even under severe deformation.

In this work, we use low-cost and highly abundant coke as the coating material on Pb negative electrodes in ultracells. The effects of the surface treatments of the coke prior to coating are investigated in terms of the electrochemical properties of the resulting cells. The coke is subjected to KOH activation, followed by surface treatments of either mild oxidation (MO) or H2O2 treatment, resulting in the increase in its specific surface area and porosity. Additionally, oxygen-containing functional groups, such as-hydroxyl,-carbonyl, and-carboxyl groups, are formed on the surfaces of the coke, which appear to hinder the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction that occurs during charging. The full-cell tests demonstrate that coating of the KOH-MO-treated coke on the Pb electrodes results in the improvement of the charge acceptances and HRPSoC cycling stabilities over 10(4) cycles for these cells. This is due to the improved charge delocalization that hinders the occurrence of severe sulfation during repeated cycles.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2352-152X		WOS:000560680700008

The stable oxidized surface was determined by calculating the formation energies of TiC (100) surface under various O coverage rates. The interfacial catalytic models of LixO2 (x = 2, 1, and 0) molecules adsorbed on pristine and oxidized TiC (100) surface were used to simulate the OER process. The results of thermodynamics calculation indicate that the oxidized TiC (100) surface has smaller O-2 evolution barrier and lower charge voltage. The electron-withdrawing O layer plays an important role in increasing charge transfer from O-2(x-) (x = 2, 1, and 0) to the substrate, which is helpful for O-2(2-) oxidation and Li-O bond activation. The theoretical results have well verified experimental findings of the oxidized TiC surface as the potential state of TiC cathode material in the Li-O-2 battery. The surface-modified strategy of the stronger electron-withdrawing layer is proposed to improve OER catalysis in the Li-O-2 battery, which provides a way for designing more active catalysts.									20	1	0	0	0	0	20			1932-7447			WOS:000436381600011

Similar experiments were carried out for i-butane and n-butane flames to better understand the influence of fuel structure and the presence of the alcohol group on detailed processes of soot nucleation and growth. In terms of fuel structure, the branched chain functionality has the most observable effect on soot formation. The onset of soot nucleation is faster in the branched fuels in comparison to the straight-chain counterparts. Under the same C/O ratio, however, the butanol flames were found to nucleate soot earlier and have higher soot volume fraction than the butane flames. A combustion reaction model for i-butanol and n-butanol was used to explore the precursor chemistry. Similar to the measured PSDF, benzene is computed to rise earlier in flames of the branched fuels than the straight-chain fuels. (C) 2012 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Here, we explored bimetallic MnCo-MOF-74 as a cathode catalyst in Li-O-2 batteries. MnCo-MOF-74 was synthesized with the Mn to Co ratio of 1:4 by a simple hydrothermal reaction. Compared to monometallic Mn-MOF-74 and Co-MOF-74 with only single catalytic activity for LiOH formation or oxygen evolution reactions, bimetallic MnCo-MOF-74 demonstrated a capability to facilitate improved reversibility and efficiency during both discharge and charge cycles. Benefitting from the porous structure of the MOF as well as the complementary contribution from both Mn- and Co-metal clusters, MnCo-MOF-74 outperformed Mn-MOF-74 and Co-MOF-74. A high full discharge capacity of 11 150 mAh g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1) was achieved in MnCo-MOF-74. During the cycling test, MnCo-MOF-74 stably delivered a limited discharge capacity of 1000 mAh g(-1) for 44 cycles at 200 mA g(-1), which is remarkably longer than those of carbon black, Mn-MOF-74, and Co-MOF-74 with cycle lives of 8, 22, and 18 cycles, respectively.									81	8	0	0	4	0	82			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000422814400071	29243914

Herein, 3D hierarchical thornlike multi-metallic PtPdNiCu alloyed nanotripods (PtPdNiCu TNTPs) were efficiently fabricated by a one-pot aqueous method, in which Pluronic F127 performed as the structure-director and dispersing agent. The as-prepared PtPdNiCu TNTPs exhibited distinct electrocatalytic activity for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) with a mass activity (MA) of 1.465 A mg(Pd)(-1), which is superior to commercial Pt/C (0.925 A mg(Pd)(-1)) in 1.0 M KOH solution, along with the greater MA (1.019 A mg(Pd)(-1)) for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) than Pt/C (0.712 A mg(Pd)(-1)). This work would provide an impetus for rationally constructing multimetal nanomaterials to commercial implementation of advanced alcohol fuel cells. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

However, multiple challenging obstacles stand in the way of their commercial application, especially their poor cycling stability resulting from the bad reversibility of the conversion reaction. Herein, Ni-Co bimetal sulfide was selected and investigated with the goal of improving the reversibility of the conversion reaction owing to the similarity of Ni and Co. As expected, when three-dimensional hierarchical Ni@NiCo2S4 (NiCo2S4 nanowires growing on the Ni foam) was applied as the freestanding anode for sodium ion batteries, it demonstrated high capacity and excellent cycling stability (90.65%, 100 cycles) compared with those of monometallic sulfides. Various characterization [in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), ex situ XRD, ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, FESEM mapping, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy] tests confirmed that the Ni-Co alloy was formed during the discharge process and effectively prevented the crystalline grain growth of conversion reaction products, improving the reaction kinetics and reversibility.									43	6	0	0	2	0	43			1948-7185			WOS:000515424300037	31922750

A two-dimensional cobalt oxy-hydrate sulfide (CoO(OH)(1-x)S-x) nanosheet was synthesized for the first time via a facile electrochemical deposition method followed by an anion-exchange process. Owing to the modified t(2g) orbitals of octahedral Co-O-x, enhanced electrical conductivity, and abundant active sites, CoO(OH)(1-x)S-x delivers high activity toward overall water splitting in alkaline media. The obtained CoO(OH)(0.75)S-0.(25) nanosheets deliver a low overpotential of 166 mV and a small Tafel slope of 93.4 mV dec(-1) in HER, while the CoO(OH)(0.75)S-0.25 catalyst delivers an extremely small overpotential of 378 mV (at 30 mA cm(-2)) and a suppressed Tafel slope of 106.3 mV dec -I for oxygen evolution reaction. The X-ray absorption fine structure and first-principle calculations further demonstrate that the substitution of sulfur heteroatoms in CoOOH can result from the unoccupied t(2g) orbit state and hence contribute to enhanced electrical conductivity and reduce the reaction barrier, all of which favor electrocatalytic functions in water splitting. This work not only proves that the specific CoO(OH)(1-x)S-x nanosheet is a promising catalyst for water splitting but also provides an facile route to synthesize new transition-metal oxide sulfides for electrocatalytic water splitting.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			2168-0485			WOS:000492117200042		
J	Wang, Ting; Xu, Ming; Li, Fengrui; Li, Yunjiang; Chen, Weilin								Multimetal-based nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes bifunctional electrocatalysts for triiodide reduction and water-splitting synthesized from polyoxometalate- intercalated layered double hydroxide pyrolysis strategy								APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL				280						119421	10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.119421				JAN 2021	2021	Over the years, transition metal-based hybrids have been advocated as one of the most promising classes of nonnoble catalysts and investigated exclusively for the electrocatalytic triiodide reduction reaction (IRR) or hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, there is lack of effective strategy to address their site accessibility, intrinsic activity and structural stability issues, and their successful utilization as bifunctional catalysts of IRR and HER is rarely explored. Herein, presented is a multimetal-based carbon nanotube hybrid (CoFeNiMo@NCNT), synthesized from a novel polyoxometalate (P0M)-intercalated layered double hydroxide (LDH) pyrolysis strategy, as an efficient catalyst for IRR and HER. During both electrochemical IRR and HER, the regulated NCNT provides a highway for electron migration and acts as a network for I-3(-)/H+ adsorption. Benefitting from the features of porous structure, multimetal component and fast electron transfer, the CoFeNiMo@NCNT catalyst delivers a high power conversion efficiency of 6.46 % when assembled as counter electrode in dye-sensitized solar cell, superior to N benchmark. Furthermore, it mediates efficient HER with a relatively small overpotential of 209.9 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The strategy to achieve tunable catalytic properties via in situ pyrolysis well-defined inorganic materials paves a new way to design cost-effective and efficient bifunctional catalysts.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000572833100001

The oxygen evolution reaction is widely accepted as the performance limiting stage in this technology, which emphasizes the need of innovative anode materials. Metal oxide semiconductors are relevant in this respect owing to their cost-effectiveness and broad availability. The combination of chemical vapor deposition and atomic layer deposition was implemented in this study for the synthesis of randomly oriented CNT-ZnO core-shell nanostructures forming an adhering porous coating. Relative to a directly coated ZnO on Si, the porous structure enables a high interface area with the electrolyte and a resulting 458% increase of the photocurrent density under simulated solar light irradiation. The photoelectrochemical characterization correlates this performance to the effective electrons withdrawing along the carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and the resulting decrease of the onset potential. In terms of durability, the CNT-ZnO core-shell structure features an enhanced photo-corrosion stability for 8 h under illumination and with a voltage bias.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2079-6412		WOS:000747472800001

This in situ probing facilitates an experimentally verifiable clue about the underlying active sites in the highly active catalyst (TiO1.23) resulting from the cathodization. Furthermore, this study correlates the evolution of cathodization-driven defects and the resultant polaronic motion with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The defect richness and structural diversity in the reduced titania attribute 'magic effects' on its charge carrier dynamics and activity. Also, the enhanced electrocatalytic activity of TiO1.23 is explained in terms of its orbital reconstruction, electronic and structural modifications. Moreover, work function measurements reveal shifting of Fermi level toward the conduction band by defect-mediated Urbach tail and bound excitonic emissions, in line with the findings based on EPR spectroscopy. The observed phenomenon in TiO1.23 is further validated by its high (negative) surface charge, enhanced hydrophilicity and surface roughness compared with native TiO2. Therefore, these studies are earmarked for deep insight into the electronic structure modification of titania during the cathodization process and also provide a better understanding of the HER process that occurred in TiO1.23.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			1932-7447			WOS:000423652700024

Their potential application as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions in neutral medium is demonstrated. The dimensions of porous tubular structures can be tuned by altering the composition of electrolyte, time of anodization, and applied voltage. Surface morphological analysis and structural characterizations are carried out by means of SEM, TEM, AFM, and XRD studies. The precise band-gap value of these electrodes is determined from diffuse reflectance UV/Vis spectroscopic studies by using the Kubelka-Munk function. These studies also reveal that the wavelength of absorption of light by nanotubular TiO2 electrodes can be extended without the addition of any dopants or sensitizers by simply tuning the parameters of the anodization process. SEM, TEM, and AFM analyses show the formation of homogeneous, porous nanotubular structures with uniform dimensions for anodized titanium plates. XRD studies confirm the formation of the anatase phase of TiO2 when the anodized samples are post-heated at a temperature of about 450 degrees C and above.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2196-0216			WOS:000338295800016

In this study, mesoporous TiO2 was prepared via biomimetic synthesis based on yeast cell templates, and used to prepare a modified electrode for the sensitive detection of pancreatic cancer miR-1290. The structure and the morphology of the TiO2 were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherm (NADI), Atomic force microscopy (AFM), and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). As a sensing active material, the yeast-templated mesoporous TiO2 could detect pancreatic cancer miRNAs with single-nucleotide discrimination. The sample prepared by calcination at 400 degrees C showed the best electrochemical sensing activity. Moreover, compared with the blank electrode, the yeast mesoporous TiO2 sensing electrode could oxidize the pancreatic cancer microRNAs at a lower potential, which minimized the interference from oxygen evolution reaction at high potentials.

J	Newton, MA								The oxidative dehydrogenation of methanol at the CuPd[85 : 15]{110} p(2x1) and Cu{110} surfaces: Effects of alloying on reactivity and reaction pathways								JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				182	2			357	366		10.1006/jcat.1998.2356				MAR 10 1999	1999	The adsorption and selective oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde over CuPd[85:15]{110}p(2 x 1) and Cu{110} has been investigated using a thermal molecular beam. Methanol oxidation on the alloy surface appears, at first sight, to be very similar to that seen on Cu{110}: the shapes of the methanol sticking curves and product evolution curves are very similar to those seen on Cu{110}. It is found, however, that temperature dependence of the sticking coefficient for methanol varies in a manner opposite that seen for Cu{110}; at temperatures below similar to 400 K the reaction stoichiometry is consistently lower than seen for Cu{110}; above 400 K in the 1/4ML O/CuPd[85: 15]{110}p(2 x 1) case this stoichiometry is seen to increase with temperature. Preoxidation of the surface to 1/2ML oxygen coverage results in behaviour that is more Cu like with no obvious increase in reaction stoichiometry at high (similar to 400 K) temperature; in this case an increase in the net stoichiometry of reaction only occurs at lower surface temperatures. In both 1/4ML and 1/2ML cases the rate of reaction of methanol is found to be faster on the alloy surface than on Cu{110}. The above differences in behaviour are rationalised in terms of an alloy-induced destabilisation of the surface methoxy species of around 2.5 kJ mol-l and a thermally induced Pd segregation during beam reactions conducted at above similar to 400 K, The apparent differences in behaviour between the 1/4ML and 1/2ML O cases on the alloy surface are also discussed in terms of the microscopic manner in which the methanol oxidation reaction is known to proceed on Cu{110}.

Their catalytic capability can be greatly boosted by the rational design and construction of complex PBA hybrid nanostructures. However, present-day structure engineering inevitably involves additional etchant or procedure. Herein, a facile, yet controllable one-pot self-assembly strategy is introduced to prepare hierarchical core-shell polymetallic PBAs (featuring bimetallic FeMn PBAs cores and CoNi PBAs shells) with hollow nano-cages/solid nano-cube architectures. The detailed characterization of material morphology/composition, assisted with theoretical simulations, reveals the underlying formation mechanism where the key factor is the control of the nucleation rate via the use of chelating agent (citrates) and reaction kinetics. The resulting FeMn@CoNi-H compound is found to accelerate the oxygen evolution reaction activity with a low overpotential (236 mV at a current density 10 mA cm(-2)) as well as a low Tafel slope (58.4 mV dec(-1)). Such an impressive performance is endowed by the rational compositional and structural design with optimized electronic structures as well as an increase in exposed active sites. This work provides a robust, cost-effective pathway that enables chemical and morphological control in creating high-performance catalysts for water electrolysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000849601300001	36056900

One of the key elements of these systems is the electrode material on which the electrochemical reactions occur, and therefore its design will impact their performance. This review focuses on the electrospinning method by examining a number of features of experimental conditions. Electrospinning is a fiber-spinning technology used to produce three-dimensional and ultrafine fibers with tunable diameters and lengths. The thermal treatment and the different analyses are discussed to understand the changes in the polymer to create usable electrode materials. Electrospun fibers have unique properties such as high surface area, high porosity, tunable surface properties, and low cost, among others. Furthermore, a little introduction to the 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) electrooxidation coupled to H-2 production was included to show the benefit of upgrading biomass derivates in electrolyzers. Indeed, environmental and geopolitical constraints lead to shifts towards organic/inorganic electrosynthesis, which allows for one to dispense with polluting, toxic and expensive reagents. The electrooxidation of HMF instead of water (OER, oxygen evolution reaction) in an electrolyzer can be elegantly controlled to electro-synthesize added-value organic chemicals while lowering the required energy for CO2-free H-2 production.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1996-1944		WOS:000818295300001	35744395

Homologous recombination is one of the mechanisms providing integrity of the mitochondrial genome. Some proteins that take part in this process in budding yeast mitochondria have been identified. These include Abf2p, the major protein of the mt-nucleoid that specifically binds cruciform DNA, and Cce1p - Holliday junction resolvase. Here we show that Abf2p does not significantly affect either binding of Cce1p to branched DNA or rate and specificity of Holliday junction resolution. These data suggest the existence of an alternative homologous recombination pathway in yeast mitochondria.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0006-2979	0320-9725		WOS:000386558100009	27908236

Nonetheless, its wide practical application urgently requires the development of highly active and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts with self-supported structures. This paper reports on a novel, simple way to fabricate an efficient cobalt/cobalt selenide (CS) catalytic electrode with a unique 3-D finger-like structure. More specifically, porous Co substrate was fabricated by a phase-inversion tape-casting and sintering method, followed by one-step selenization in Ar atmosphere. The resultant CS electrode manifested superior catalytic performance in both HER and OER (hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively) that took place in an alkaline medium, with low overpotential and high long-term stability. Furthermore, the electrolysis test for overall water splitting was successfully performed by assembling the CS electrodes as both anode and cathode. The excellent electrocatalytic performance is ascribed to the high conductivity of the Co substrate, the distinctive finger-like structure, and the numerous in-situ developed heterojunctions, which suitably adjust the electronic structure and decrease the energy barrier of water splitting. Moreover, the density function theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the heterojunction enhances the density of the state near the Fermi level and optimize the kinetics of HER and OER processes. As a result, the hydrogen adsorption free energy (Delta G(H*)) is close to zero, and the energy barrier of the rate-determining step of OER is low due to the heterojunction formed.

Herein, a facile and sustainable strategy is demonstrated that biomass-derived lignosulfonate (LS) as carbon precursors is first co-precipitated with metal salt precursors to form LS-conformal Co-Al layered double hydroxides (Co-Al LDHs) flower-like architectures. After calcination, the pyrolyzates of Co-Al LDHs (Co-Al-O-x) and the corresponding vulcanized products cobalt chalcogenides (Co3S4) are in-situ co-doped into LS-derived carbon nanosheets (LSCN), forming novel flower-like Co-Al-O-x/S-y@LSCH hybrid materials. Owing to the structural and compositional benefits, the resulting hybrid materials and LSCN as electrode materials endowed flexible all-LS based asymmetric supercapacitor high energy density (21.83 Wh Kg(-1)@374.28 W kg(-1)). Due to the in-situ multi-component doping and heterojunctions, the hybrid materials could serve as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (264 mV@10 mA cm(-2)) and hydrogen evolution reaction (291 mV@10 mA cm(-2)) and exhibited remarkable stability for overall water splitting (over 100 h). This study not only demonstrates a feasible route to explore low-cost and renewable bio-based electroactive materials for future wearable energy electronics and large-scale hydrogen production, but also proposes a grand opportunity for the valorization of waste LS to high-valued multifunctional materials.

However, the widespread use of this method has been limited owing to the low efficiency of existing materials. Recently, two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been attracting researchers' attention owing to their unique optical and electronic properties.

As an alternative to the state-of-the-art OER catalyst, recently, transition-metal-based hydroxide materials have been shown to play important roles for the same. Owing to the high earth abundance of various Ni-based hydroxide and its derivatives, these are known to be highly studied materials for the OER. Herein, we report a simple wet-chemical synthesis of metallic gold-incorporated (by varying the concentration of Au3+ ions) Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets as an active and stable electrocatalyst for the OER in 1 M KOH medium. The Au-Ni(OH)(2) (2) catalyst demanded a low overpotential of 288 mV to attain a geometric current density of 10 mA/cm(2) with a lower Tafel value of 55 mV/dec compared to bare Ni(OH)(2) with a lower mass loading of only 0.1 mg/cm(2). Tafel slope analysis reveals that the incorporation of metallic gold on the hydroxide surfaces could alter the mechanistic pathways of the overall OER reaction. It has been proposed that the incorporation of metallic gold over the Ni(OH)(2) surfaces led to a change in the electronic structure of the electroactive nickel sites (Jahn-Teller distortion), which favors the OER by electronic aspects.									9	0	0	0	0	0	8			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000710270100080	34601871

For the first time, its advancement through the reaction cycle was monitored by time-resolved X-ray absorption measurements at the Mn K-edge at room temperature. The complex was stepped through its four oxidation states by nano-second-laser flashes applied to samples exposed to the X-ray beam. Time courses of the X-ray fluorescence intensity were recorded during a flash sequence. Extended X-ray absorption fine-structure spectra were recorded with the S-1, S-2, and S-3 oxidation states highly populated. The room temperature data is compatible with the formation of a third di-mu-oxo bridge between two Mn atoms upon the S-2 --> S-3 transition. (C) 2002 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

Unfortunately, the sluggish charge transport dynamics and poor CO2 activation performance result in a low CO2 conversion efficiency. Herein, we develop a multidimensional In2O3/In2S3 (IO/IS) heterojunction with abundant lattice distortion structure and high concentration of oxygen defects. The close contact interfaces between the junction of the two phases ensure undisturbed transmission of electrons with high-speed. The increased free electron concentration promotes the adsorption and activation of CO2 on the catalyst surface, leaving the key intermediate *COOH at a lower energy barrier. The perfect combination of the band matching oxide and sulfide effectively reduces the internal energy barrier of the CO2 reduction reaction. Furthermore, the lattice distortion structure not only provides additional active sites, but also optimizes the kinetics of the reaction through microstructural regulation. Remarkably, the optimal IO/IS heterojunction exhibits superior CO2 reduction performance with CO evolution rate of 12.22 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), achieving about 4 times compared to that of In2O3 and In2S3, respectively. This work emphasizes the importance of tight interfaces of heterojunction in improving the performance of CO2 photoreduction, and provides an effective strategy for construction of heterojunction photocatalysts.

Phase pure perovskites were synthesized up to x=0.300 in 0.025/0.050 steps. HAADF STEM and EDX analysis points towards FeO2-terminated (001)-facets in LaFeO3, in accordance with the stability diagram obtained from density functional theory calculations with a Hubbard U term (DFT+U). Linear sweep voltammetry conducted in a rotating disk electrode setup shows a reduction of the OER overpotential and a nonmonotonic trend with x, with double layer capacitance measurements indicating an intrinsic nature of activity. This is supported by DFT+U results that show reduced overpotentials for both Fe and Co reaction sites with the latter reaching values of 0.32-0.40 V, similar to 0.3 V lower than for Fe. This correlates with a stronger reduction of the binding energy difference of the *O and *OH intermediates towards an optimum value of 1.6 eV for x=0.250 , the OH deprotonation being the potential limiting step in most cases. Significant variations of the magnetic moments of both surface and subsurface Co and Fe during OER demonstrate that the beneficial effect is a result of a concerted action involving many surrounding ions, which extends the concept of the active site.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000711556700001	34496083

Similarly, noble metals often excel as electrocatalytic counter electrode materials in regenerative liquid-junction photoelectrochemical solar cells, such as quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) that employ the sulfide/polysulfide redox electrolyte as the hole mediator. Here, we systematically investigate thin films of the earth-abundant pyrite-phase transition metal disulfides (FeS2, CoS2, NiS2, and their alloys) as promising alternative electrocatalysts for both the HER and polysulfide reduction. Their electrocatalytic activity toward the HER is correlated to their composition and morphology. The emergent trends in their performance suggest that cobalt plays an important role in facilitating the HER, with CoS2 exhibiting highest overall performance. Additionally, we demonstrate the high activity of the transition metal pyrites toward polysulfide reduction and highlight the particularly high intrinsic activity of NiS2, which could enable improved QDSSC performance. Furthermore, structural disorder introduced by alloying different transition metal pyrites could increase their areal density of active sites for catalysis, leading to enhanced performance.									479	23	0	0	25	1	484			1932-7447			WOS:000342118500006	25247028

The energy generated by renewable energy sources can be stored either in a chemical (water splitting) or an electrochemical (battery or supercapacitor) form, that are two distinct processes. Here, we introduce an integrated solar-powered system for both electrochemical energy storage and water electrolysis. A nickel-cobalt-iron layered double hydroxide (Ni-Co-Fe LDH) was successfully synthesized on nickel foam as a substrate using a fast, one-step electrodeposition approach. The Ni-Co-Fe LDH exhibited excellent electrochemical properties both as an active electrode material in supercapacitors, and as a catalyst in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). When employed as the positive electrode in a supercapacitor, along with activated carbon as the negative electrode in an asymmetric configuration, the ultrathin and porous Ni-Co-Fe LDH nanoplatelets delivered an ultrahigh specific energy of 57.5 W h kg(-1) with an outstanding specific power of 37.9 kW kg(-1) and an excellent cycle life. As an OER electrocatalyst, Ni-Co-Fe LDH exhibited superior electrocatalytic performances with a very low overpotential of 0.207 V versus a reference hydrogen electrode (RHE) at 10.0 mA cm(-2), and a small Tafel slope of 31 mV dec(-1). The superior energy storage and catalytic OER properties of the Ni-Co-Fe LDH nanoplatelet array can be attributed to both the synergistic effects among the metal species and the unique mesoporous structure of the LDH that provides facilitated charge/ion diffusion pathways and more available active sites.									65	0	0	0	2	0	65			2405-8297			WOS:000425894300031

Furthermore, the compositions of alloys were tunable. These nanofascicles exhibited significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activity due to their alloy nature, ultrathin size, and attractive morphological features. Noticeably, PtM electrocatalysts exhibited superior HER performances not only in the acidic but also in alkaline conditions when the electrocatalysts were deposited on a carbon paper. Pt8Co demonstrates the smallest eta(10) value of 26.1 mV under acidic conditions, which is significantly lower than that of Pt/C (63.4 mV). Under alkaline conditions, the eta(10) of Pt8Co is 47.2 mV, which is substantially lower than that of commercial Pt/C (187.9 mV). Pt6Mn shows the lower eta(10) values of 39.0 and 67.5 mV under acidic and alkaline conditions, respectively. In addition, PtM electrocatalysts exhibit excellent long-term durability under alkaline conditions.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			2052-1553			WOS:000587892200005

However, the lack of efficient photothermal electrocatalysts for overall water splitting hinders its widespread application. Herein, we report a novel photothermal-electrocatalytic system of Ru-Fe3O4 heterojunctions grown on iron foam (Ru-Fe3O4 /IF). Through a feasible hydrothermal corrosion strategy, ruthenium ions effectively etch the reactive IF substrate to form Ru-Fe3O4 heterojunctions. The Ru-Fe3O4/IF enables remarkable photothermal conversion under near infrared (NIR) light irradiation due to the contributions of Fe3O4 and metallic Ru nanoparticles. When exposed to NIR light irradiation, the photothermal Ru-Fe3O4 /IF shows small overpotentials (eta 10) of 297 and 128 mV for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, respectively, which are 58 and 45 mV lower than those without NIR light irradiation and compare favorably to most of previously reported photothermal electrocatalysts. Importantly, the photothermal Ru-Fe3O4 /IF exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.521 V at 10 mA cm(-2) with good durability within 24 h. This study provides a new platform for improving water splitting electrocatalysis by utilizing the photothermal effect.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000835150300001

It remains a challenge to effectively activate catalytic sites for interfacial carbon-catalyzed electrocatalysts. Here, we report a polyoxomolybdate-derived carbon-encapsulated multicomponent catalyst with nanowire structure. The activation of catalytic sites and enhancement of HER kinetics are achieved by incorporating tiny MoO2 and Ni nanoparticles into a N-doped carbon layer (denoted as MoO2-Ni@NC). The MoO2-Ni@NC catalyst possesses a remarkable HER activity and is superior to most carbon-encapsulated electrocatalysts. In particular, it achieves a low overpotential of 58 mV at -10 mA cm(-2), and a high exchange current density of 0.375 mA cm(-2) with good stability (up to 80000 s) in 0.5 M H2SO4. Theoretical analyses suggest that the N-doped carbon layer acts as an active adsorption site for hydrogen. The inner MoO2-Ni species behave as effective promoters to synergistically modulate the hydrogen adsorption strength on the interfacial carbon and enable the active sites to be more efficient. The synthesis strategy and the revealed catalytic mechanism can guide the rational design of high-efficiency carbon-encapsulated HER electrocatalysts.									25	3	0	0	1	0	25			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000448340100005

In this study, a new BiVO4/CuBi2O4/Co-Pi photoanode has been prepared. CuBi2O4 and BiVO4 form a heterojunction structure that widens the absorption range of light and accelerates the separation of photogenerated carriers in the photoanode, thereby allowing holes into the next layer (cocatalyst layer) faster. The Co-Pi constituent acts as a water oxidation catalyst that can accelerate the interface charge transfer and increase the active surface area. Linear sweep voltammetry is used to determine the photocurrent density of BiVO4/CuBi2O4/Co-Pi, being 1.88 and 1.23 times bigger than that of BiVO4 and BiVO4/CuBi2O4, respectively. In addition to this, the BiVO4/CuBi2O4/Co-Pi photoanode creates a synergy effect that leads to a wider range of light absorption, higher carrier separation efficiency, and greater water oxidation power so the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution rates after recombination increased by 5.68 times and 5.66 times. The results prove that ternary semiconductor structures can improve photoelectrochemical performance. The strategy has great potential in the development of photoelectrochemical water splitting.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000746665300001

The O-3-sourced Al2O3 gate dielectric featured good thermal stability and breakdown behavior, even at a PMA temperature of 700 degrees C. Moreover, deep interface/bulk traps in the O3-sourced Al2O3/GaN structures were effectively suppressed, as confirmed by characterization using deep-level transient spectroscopy. However, extended line defects and holelike traps were observed at higher PMA temperatures (750 degrees C), which were considered to originate from the interface reaction between partially crystallized O-3-sourced Al2O3 and the GaN epitaxial layer.

The activity trend was found to follow the sequence of Ni/SC > Ni/NC > Ni/BC. Specifically, benefiting from the optimum anchoring effects and strong metal-support interaction, Ni/SC shows remarkable HOR catalytic performance, which is about 2.9 and 7.7 times higher than that of the dopant-free counterpart, Ni/C, in terms of specific activity and mass activity, respectively.									55	9	0	0	4	0	56			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472225200009

Herein, a CoxP-Fe2P heterostructure array electrocatalyst supported on nickel foam (CoxP-Fe2P/NF) is fabricated via phosphating of the CoFe-layered double hydroxide (CoFe-LDH) nanosheets decorated with CoFe Prussian blue analogue (CoFe-PBA) nanocubes. The as-fabricated CoxP-Fe2P/NF heterostructure arrays with an abundant and strongly electronic coupled interface not only guarantee the fast charge transfer and improve the reaction kinetics but also enable the charge redistribution between CoxP and Fe2P, thus possibly optimizing the adsorption capabilities of reactants. Benefiting from the compositional and structural advantages, this as-fabricated CoxP-Fe2P/NF heterostructure can efficiently convert water to H-2 and O-2 with the potentials of 75 and 265 mV to achieve the current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm(-1) in 1 M KOH, respectively. Especially, when CoxP-Fe2P/NF is used as both anode and cathode materials, a cell voltage of 1.61 V is required at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with excellent stability in long-term operation over 100 h, which is comparable to Pt/C/NF parallel to RuO2/NF. This work highlights the key roles of the interface in accelerating the electrocatalytic reaction kinetics and paves a way for the design of a high-performance electrocatalyst for overall water splitting.									22	0	0	0	1	0	21			2168-0485			WOS:000662271200006

Herein, we developed a simple and rapid microwave-assisted hydrothermal approach for the controllable synthesis of a butterfly-shaped Ce(OH)CO3 hierarchical structure as an efficient EMW absorber for the first time. Kinetic factors, including the CO(NH2)(2)/Ce3+ molar ratio (beta), reaction temperature (T), and reaction time, can be expediently utilized to tune the size, morphology, and defects of the products, which is helpful for tailoring the EMW absorption capability. The cooperation of selective adsorption and minimum surface free energy results in the evolution of the morphology. The appropriate defects, oxygen vacancies, and surface functional groups along with hierarchical structure can synergistically benefit the superior EMW absorbing capacity. Strong damping and perfect impedance matching can be achieved by tuning the balance between conductivity loss and polarization loss. Excellent comprehensive properties are reached at T = 140 degrees C and beta = 2.5 : 1 with a maximal absorption bandwidth of 9.52 GHz, which is significantly broader than those of the previously reported cerium-based compounds/composites. Our current work not only sheds light on the precisely controllable synthesis of hierarchical structures but also opens up a novel methodology for designing new efficient EMW absorbers.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000728821400001

The gallium oxynitride catalyst has a bandgap energy of 2.1 eV, exhibiting photocatalytic activity for H-2 and O-2 evolution from aqueous methanol and silver nitrate solutions under visible light illumination. The crystalline structure and oxidation state of gallium oxynitride were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XAS and XPS). These results indicate that the gallium oxynitride photocatalyst has a hexagonal wurtzite-like structure similar to that of GaN. Elemental analysis also reveals that the visible-light-active gallium oxynitride catalyst has a composition of Ga-0.71 square 0.29O(0.21)N(0.79) (square indicates cation vacancies), suggesting the presence of gallium vacancies, and shallow donors formed by the nonstoichiometric substitution of nitrogen for oxygen. These defect states act as radiative centers in photoluminescence and induce charge recombination in photocatalytic reaction. (C) 2016 The Electrochemical Society.

Here we demonstrate that earth-abundant NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets grown on carbon fiber paper can efficiently catalyze the oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) at the anode of an electrochemical cell. A near-quantitative yield of FDCA and 99.4% Faradaic efficiency of HMF conversion under ambient conditions can be achieved in the electrochemical process. HMF has a higher rate of oxidation than water and can act as an alternative anodic reaction for alkaline H-2 evolution in water-splitting cells. As the first report on using bimetallic metal hydroxide/oxide catalysts for electrochemical oxidation of HMF, this work opens up opportunities in electrochemical devices to simultaneously produce building-block chemicals from biomass-derived molecules and clean H-2 fuels under ambient conditions with earth-abundant materials.									213	12	0	0	13	0	215			2155-5435			WOS:000434369600082

A challenging issue in water splitting for solar fuel production is developing high performance and scalable photo/electro catalysts using low cost approach. Here, CoOx nanostructures were grown on anodized TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNAs) by amperostatic electrodeposition method as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) photoanodes. The effects of electrodeposition current density and deposition time on the growth of so-called nanostructures were investigated based on photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements and structural characterizations. X-ray diffraction patterns of the photoanodes revealed formation of stoichiometric anatase TiO2 as well as cobalt oxide on the surface. Based on scanning electron microscope, by increasing the electrodeposition current, the morphology of CoOx nanostructures changed which makes electrodeposition current of 0.1 mA.cm(-2) resulting in optimum distribution of cobalt oxide electrocatalysts with average size of 35 nm which exhibit the highest photocurrent density due to efficient and uniform distribution of electrocatalysts with no screening effect. Electrodeposition time was found to have a linear relationship with the surface coverage of TNAs by the electrocatalyst, and 2000s, having long charge carrier lifetime and successfully adjusted electrocatalyst to photocatalyst amount ratio turned out to be the optimum electrodeposition time. In this work, we achieved optimized electrodeposition conditions (current density and deposition time) which improve the PEC performance of CoOx-TNAs by 2 times higher than the pristine TNA photocatalyst. Photovoltage measurement and conductive atomic microscopy along with absorption spectra of the samples revealed formation of visible active p-type CoOx species in interface with n-type titania nanotube.									12	2	0	0	1	0	14			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000447744200009

Herein, we synthesized a novel hexagonal annular Mn(OH)F by a simple hydrothermal method. We also investigated the growth process of the materials from hexagonal block to hexagonal ring via controlling the hydrothermal temperature and time. Comparing with the hexagonal block, the hexagonal rings showed enhanced electrocatalytic water oxidation performance in alkaline solutions. The observed catalytic performance of this novel Mn(OH)F is correlated to its unique structure. Furthermore, we expect that Mn(OH)F would be a new type of Mn-based water oxidation catalyst.

The samples were characterised by gel permeation chromatography (GPC); morphology features were analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Limited Oxygen Index (LOI) and a thermovision camera (TC) have been used to investigate the burning process. It was found that introduction of 3-chloro-1,2-propanediol into the polymer structure changes both the morphology and the flammability behaviour. A possible mode of stabilising action of this internal flame retardant is discussed in terms of relatively rough structure of polyurethanes containing CPD that may play an important role by inhibiting polymer-specific condensed phase-reactions. Some cooling and fuel-diluting effects of the evaporated CO2 or crystallized water may push the heat- and light-emitting zone of the flame further away from the pyrolysing polymer surface. This increased distance would cut down heat transfer. On the other hand, the rate of evolution of volatile products from the degrading polymer is probably controlled by diffusion and the primary products of degradation may undergo secondary reactions while they are retained in the hot zone.

Metal nanoparticles and their supports often undergo changes in structure and oxidation state when exposed to reactants, hindering a straightforward understanding of the structure-activity relations using only ex situ or ultrahigh vacuum techniques. Overcoming these limitations, we explored the metal-support interaction between gold nanoparticles and ceria supports in ultrahigh vacuum and after exposure to CO. A combination of in situ methods (on powder and model Au/CeO2 samples) and theoretical calculations was applied to investigate the gold/ceria interface and its reactivity toward CO exposure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements rationalized by first-principles calculations reveal a distinctly inhomogeneous charge distribution, with Au+ atoms in contact with the ceria substrate and neutral Au-0 atoms at the surface of the Au nanoparticles. Exposure to CO partially reduces the ceria substrate, leading to electron transfer to the supported Au nanoparticles. Transferred electrons can delocalize among the neutral Au atoms of the particle or contribute to forming inert Au delta- atoms near oxygen vacancies at the ceria surface. This charge redistribution is consistent with the evolution of the vibrational frequencies of CO adsorbed on Au particles obtained using diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000849738400001	36117879

As the precursor solution of spray pyrolysis can significantly influence the nanostructure and the amount of oxygen vacancies of the final films, modifying the precursor solution is an efficient strategy for improving the photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of BiVO4 photoanodes. Herein, an ultraviolet and ultrasonic treatment for modifying a vanadium precursor solution of spray pyrolysis was developed to produce efficient nanoporous BiVO4 photoanodes. By the simple treatment, the AM 1.5 photocurrent density of the photoanode reached 1.76 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for water oxidation, which is 12.3 times higher than the untreated BiVO4 photoanode. The good PEC performance was mainly attributed to the excellent charge separation that reached approximately 94.2% at 1.23 V vs RHE. Systematic studies revealed that the treatment for the precursor solution could tune the nanoporous structure and increase the amount of oxygen vacancies in the final films. This finding offers a facile and effective approach for fabricating efficient photoelectrodes for PEC water splitting.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2166-532X			WOS:000521299400001

Herein, we report a pre-chelation assisted one-pot synthesis of a heterostructure CoSe/Co-N-C, where uniform CoSe nanoparticles are supported and enwrapped by single atomic Co doped carbon backbones. CoSe/Co-N-C demonstrates superior HER activities in the entire pH range, requiring small overpotentials of 71 mV, 63 mV, and 128 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, 0.5 M H2SO4, and 1.0 M PBS, respectively. Moreover, remarkable long-time stabilities are achieved in all electrolytes, thanks to the attenuated corrosion with the carbon layer encapsulation derived from the fluid catalytic cracking slurry. To elucidate the interaction mechanism, theoretical calculations reveal an apparent electron transfer at CoSe and Co-N-C interfaces, which modulates the electronic structures to realize the improved intrinsic HER activities. The synergistic advances of excellent activity and remarkable stability in a wide range of pHs present its great potential for practical hydrogen mass production.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2052-1537		WOS:000870776000001

Herein, a highly active 3D bulk catalysts of core-shell nanostructures, in which Flower-like CuCoMoOx nanosheets embellished with CoCu alloy nanoparticles are evenly wrapped on Cu NWs cores supported on CF, toward overall water splitting is firstly reported. The coaction of CoCu alloy nanoparticles and CuCoMoOx nanosheets with 3D hierarchical and porous nanoarchitecture can accelerate the ionization of H2O molecules and formation of H-2.

Since Co(II) has multiple valence states and is especially abundant, CoMOFs have emerged as latent materials of electrocatalysts in overall water splitting. In fact, CoMOFs/carbon-based hybrid materials (Co/CHMs) exhibit all kinds of architectures, marvelous electrochemical capabilities, and synergistic effects, overcoming the relative insulation of CoMOFs and single structure carbon materials. The synergistic effect of CoMOFs-based materials and carbon materials forming a unique interface can increase the specific surface area and accelerate electron transfer rates, resulting in enhanced overall water splitting. In terms of this review, the various Co/CHMs (carbon = GO/RGO, CNT, and carbon black) are summarized. The relationship between the synergistic effect of Co/CHMs and the activity of overall water splitting is discussed. Finally, this review can supply a certain degree of reference for Co/CHMs as electrocatalysts in the field of overall water splitting and a number of helpful comments for prospective energy materials.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1528-7483	1528-7505		WOS:000812717000001

Here, we adopted a simple two-step method to successfully prepare the 3D V-Ni3S2@CoFe-LDH core-shell electrocatalyst. The V-Ni3S2@CoFe-LDH/NF shows excellent OER performance with low overpotential (190 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and 240 mV at 50 mA/cm(2)), small Tafel slope (26.8 mV/dec) and good longterm durability. Excitingly, to reach the same current density, V-Ni3S2@CoFe-LDH/NF electrode even needs much smaller overpotential than RuO2. Furthermore, the outstanding OER activity of V-Ni3S2@CoFe-LDH/NF is ascribed to the following reasons: (1) V-Ni3S2 nanorod cores improve the conductivity and ensure the fast charge transfer; (2) CoFe-LDH nanosheets interconnected with each other provide more exposed active sites; (3) the unique 3D core-shell structures are favorable for electrolyte diffusion and gas releasing. Our work indicates that building 3D core-shell heterostructure will be a useful way to design good electrocatalysts. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Both impurities and H3BO3 were found to reduce the corrosion rate. Cyclic voltammetry revealed that the presence of impurities or H3BO3 significantly retarded the formation of large crystal PbSO4. H3BO3 increased the rates of oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions for all alloys. Impedance measurement was used to quantify the amounts of PbSO4 and PbO in the initial stage of the oxidation. H3BO3 decreased the positive grid corrosion of all alloys, while impurities increased it. Although impurities increased the self-discharge during constant current discharge, H3BO3 was found to decrease it, except for the alloy containing the 3 impurities and the Cu-containing alloy. Under open-circuit conditions, H3BO3 increased significantly the self-discharge rate, but impurities were found to suppress it.									4	1	0	0	0	0	5			1300-0527			WOS:000332942200009

Chemical relaxation solves the evolution of the system and can treat disequilibrium chemistry, as the source/sink terms are driven toward chemical equilibrium on a prescribed chemical timescale, but it has surprisingly never been validated. First, we generalize the treatment by forgoing the use of a single chemical timescale, instead developing a pathway analysis tool that allows us to identify the rate-limiting reaction as a function of temperature and pressure. For the interconversion between methane and carbon monoxide, and between ammonia and molecular nitrogen, we identify the key rate-limiting reactions for conditions relevant to currently characterizable exo-atmospheres (500-3000 K, 0.1 mbar to 1 kbar). Second, we extend chemical relaxation to include carbon dioxide and water. Third, we examine the role of metallicity and the carbon-to-oxygen ratio in chemical relaxation. Fourth, we apply our pathway analysis tool to diagnose the differences between our chemical network and that of Moses and Venot. Finally, we validate the chemical relaxation method against full chemical kinetics calculations in one dimension. For WASP-18b-, HD 189733b-, and GJ 1214-b-like atmospheres, we show that chemical relaxation is mostly accurate to within an order of magnitude, a factor of 2, and similar to 10%, respectively. The level of accuracy attained allows for the chemical relaxation method to be included in three-dimensional general circulation models.									29	1	0	0	1	0	29			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000439376100009

By density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we explored the possibility of using single-atom dispersed Cu or Co on two-dimensional (4 x 4 x 1) 2H-MoS2 monolayer (Cu@2H-MoS2 and Co@2H-MoS2) to activate the inert basal planes of 2H-MoS2 and to realize overall water splitting reaction. Our results reveal that Cu@2H-MoS2 and Co@2H-MoS2 can significantly alter surface charge distribution and electronic band structure of 2H-MoS2, and Gibbs free-energies of adsorbed H and O species on 2H-MoS2. As a result, the incorporation of Cu or Co single atoms can activate inert in-plane S-atoms, and lead to the improved electrochemical activity for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). Relatively, Co@2H-MoS2 exhibits better performance for HER with smaller Gibbs free energy of the hydrogen adsorption (Delta G(H)=0.08 eV), which is comparable to (4 x 4 x 1) Pt (111) surface (Delta G(H)=-0.22 eV). Compared to pristine 2H-MoS2 or Co@2H-MoS2, the catalytic activity of Cu@2H-MoS2 for OER is considerably improved with a reduced overpotential of 1.25 eV and a lower energy barrier. This study provides a design route for constructing high-performance single-atom catalysts for the overall water splitting.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2468-0230			WOS:000711827200003

Many challenges still remain in improving energy conversion efficiency, such as utilizing longer-wavelength photons for hydrogen production, enhancing the reaction efficiency at any given wavelength, and increasing the lifetime of the semiconductor materials. This introductory review covers the fundamental aspects of photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical water splitting. Controlling the semiconducting properties of photocatalysts and photoelectrode materials is the primary concern in developing materials for solar water splitting, because they determine how much photoexcitation occurs in a semiconductor under solar illumination and how many photoexcited carriers reach the surface where water splitting takes place. Given a specific semiconductor material, surface modifications are important not only to activate the semiconductor for water splitting but also to facilitate charge separation and to upgrade the stability of the material under photoexcitation. In addition, reducing resistance loss and forming p-n junction have a significant impact on the efficiency of photoelectrochemical water splitting. Correct evaluation of the photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical activity for water splitting is becoming more important in enabling an accurate comparison of a number of studies based on different systems. In the latter part, recent advances in the water splitting reaction under visible light will be presented with a focus on non-oxide semiconductor materials to give an overview of the various problems and solutions.									2969	115	1	0	204	2	2991			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000343993100005	24413305

A Review of Neutron Scattering Applications to Nuclear Materials								ISRN Materials Science								302408 (24 pp.)	302408 (24 pp.)		10.1155/2013/302408				2013	2013	The growing demand for electric energy will require expansion of the amount of nuclear power production in many countries of the world. Research and development in this field will continue to grow to further increase safety and efficiency of nuclear power generation. Neutrons are a unique probe for a wide range of problems related to these efforts, ranging from crystal chemistry of nuclear fuels to engineering diffraction on cladding or structural materials used in nuclear reactors. Increased flux at modern neutron sources combined with advanced sample environments allows nowadays, for example, studies of reaction kinetics at operating temperatures in a nuclear reactor. Neutrons provide unique data to benchmark simulations and modeling of crystal structure evolution and thermomechanical treatment. Advances in neutron detection recently opened up new avenues of materials characterization using neutron imaging with unparalleled opportunities especially for nuclear materials, where heavy elements (e.g., uranium) need to be imaged together with light elements (e.g., hydrogen, oxygen). This paper summarizes applications of neutron scattering techniques for nuclear materials. Directions for future research, extending the trends observed over the past decade, are discussed.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2090-6080			INSPEC:13700378

The gas evolution during the activation process was analyzed by thermogravimetry-mass spectrometry. The SO2 adsorption equilibrium and desulfurization kinetics at low temperatures were also investigated. The results of this study indicate that three reactions are mainly responsible for the formation of pore structure in the activated carbons. The physical adsorption dominates the adsorption of SO2 (250-1250 ppm SO2, N-2 as balance gas) at lower temperature for activated carbons. The Boltzmann model was found to be suitable for describing the desulfurization behavior of selected activated carbon at low temperatures under non-oxygen atmosphere instead of the linear driving force model. The apparent sorption rate constant of activated carbon ranges from 0.0027 to 0.0038 s(-1). The temperature-programmed desorption study of the adsorption-saturated (393 K, 5% O-2 + 1250 ppm SO2 + N-2 balance) activated carbon suggests the presence of two types of adsorbed SO2 with the bond energy of 45.17 and 52.00 kJ mol(-1), respectively.									11	3	0	0	1	0	13			1388-6150	1588-2926		WOS:000407309900030

The thermal shock properties of C/SiC composites were investigated in air. 3D-C/SiC specimens were thermally shocked for five cycles between 1500 degrees C and 100 degrees C. The thermal shock resistance was characterized by mass variation and residual flexural strength properties. Scanning electron microscope was used to examine the change of the surface morphology and micro-structural evolution of the composites. In addition, the phase evolution of the surfaces was identified by XRD, EDS and XPS. It was found that the strength of 3D-C/SiC composites decreased after thermal shock tests. The phase composition of 3D-C/SiC composites was mainly beta-sic and carbon. After thermal shock tests, more oxides were generated and more 0 atoms were detected when there was no coating on the surface of 3D-C/SiC. The matrix cracking offered the channels through which oxygen could penetrate into the composites and consume the fibers during thermal shock tests. CVD-SiC coating played an important role in enhancing the resistance to the thermal shock of the composites. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

Herein, a renewed host-guest photocatalyst (Ov-WO3@CB[5]) prepared by anchoring cucurbit[5]uril on oxygen vacancy-rich WO3 was efficient for reductive upgrading of biomass derivatives using NH3-BH3, such as cascade photocatalytic hydrogenation-cyclization of ethyl levulinate to gamma-valerolactone (up to 99 % yield) at 25 degrees C in 1 h, and quan-titative production of primary/secondary bio-alcohols or arylamines from various aldehydes/ketones or nitro-arenes, respectively. Also, the rate of H2 production by direct photocatalytic hydrolysis of NH3-BH3 could reach 5.75 mL h-1 g-1. The inclusion of cucurbit[5]uril effectively adjusted the semiconductor band structure and enhanced migration efficiency of photo-generated carriers, and the hydrophobic cavity of cucurbit[5]uril favored the entrance of NH3-BH3, as elaborated by theoretical calculations. Properly engineering supramolecular surface-active sites based on interface host-guest chemistry opens new avenues for reductive upgrading of biomass and hydrogen evolution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000870849200001

The as-prepared nanomaterials were investigated for catalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic medium. Doping of sulfur and nitrogen was achieved by adding different weights of thiourea along with ferrocene and toluene precursors. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy verify the presence of sulfur and nitrogen species in the synthesized material. It is found that a small and optimum amount (10 and 20 wt %) of thiourea addition leads to significant enhancement in the number of active sites, which leads to a many-fold increase in current density for the prepared samples. Among the synthesized samples, Fe@C-SN/25 and Fe@C-SN/50 exhibit robust catalytic performance with overpotential values of 518 and 536 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2), respectively, while an optimum S, N codoped graphitic carbon-Fe/Fe3C (Fe@C-SN/50) shows the lowest onset potential of 372 mV among its others counterparts, for a catalyst loading of 0.554 mg cm(-2).									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000707030800058

Herein, ZnO/BiVO4 hierarchical nanostructures were exemplified to demonstrate new concept of multi-electric field-assisted charge separation. The contribution of both facet engineering and defect modulation to the facilitated photocatalysis was confirmed by both experimental observations and theoretical calculations. Such integration of built-in fields in faceted BiVO4 and anisotropic ZnO nanorods, together with the possible Z-scheme at the interfaces resulted into 1.36 mmol h(-1) g(-1) O-2 produced under visible light irradiation, and more than one order of magnitude enhanced apparent quantum yield at 450 nm. This work not only provides fundamental insights into the facet-dependent distribution of interfacial defects, but also offers a strategy for the design of faceted heterojunctions with controlled vacancies for significantly enhanced charge separation.									68	3	0	0	7	0	70			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000440682100085

Herein, the synthesis of NiSe2/CoSe2 heterostructures with different interfacial densities via an innovative strategy of successive ion injection is reported. The resulting hybrid electrocatalyst with dense heterointerfaces exhibits superior electrocatalytic properties in an alkaline electrolyte, superior to other benchmarks and precious metal catalysts. Advanced synchrotron techniques, post structural characterizations, and density functional theory (DFT) simulations reveal that the introduction of atomic-level interfaces can lower the oxidation overpotential of bimetallic Ni and Co active sites (whereas Ni2+ can be more easily activated than Co2+) and induce the electronic interaction between the core selenides and surface in situ generated oxides/hydroxides, which play a critical role in synergistically reducing energetic barriers and accelerating reaction kinetics for catalyzing the oxygen evolution. Hence, the heterointerface structure facilitates the catalytic performance enhancement via increasing the intrinsic reactivity of metallic atoms and enhancing the synergistic effect between the inner selenides and surface oxidation species. This work not only complements the understanding on the origins of the activity of electrocatalysts based on metal selenides, but also sheds light on further surface and interfacial engineering of advanced hybrid materials.									150	8	0	0	5	0	150			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000535525600001	32459056

The first is an individual cell (Cell 1) with monopolar electrode BDD and the second (Cell 2) has two bipolar electrodes BDD self-polarized. The bulk electrolysis was performed at the same initial operating conditions in order to quantify the influence of the initial pH and current density on dye discoloration and global mineralization removal. The current efficiency and the consumption energy were also evaluated. When the same solutions have been comparatively treated with the two cells, a quite good mineralization is found in Cell 2. This result supposed more fraction of the applied current is used for the electrocombustion reaction on Cell 2 if compared to Cell 1 and small amount rest for the side reaction of oxygen evolution. The HPLC analyses confirmed this hypothesis and showed that the concentration trend of intermediates (sulfanilic acid, phthalate acid and salicylic acid) with electrolysis time was different on two cells. Phototoxicity tests show that the electrochemical oxidation with BDD electrodes could be useful as a pretreatment technique for reducing hazardous wastewater toxicity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The GaPSb crystalline layer is grown on Si by Molecular Beam Epitaxy with different Sb contents. The bandgap value and bandgap type of GaPSb alloy are determined on the whole Sb range, by combining experimental absorption measurements with tight binding (TB) theoretical calculations. The indirect (X-band) to direct (Gamma-band) cross-over is found to occur at 30% Sb content. Especially, at a Sb content of 32%, the GaP1-xSbx alloy reaches the desired 1.7eV direct bandgap, enabling efficient sunlight absorption, that can be ideally combined with the Si 1.1 eV bandgap. Moreover, the band alignment of GaP1-xSbx alloys and Si with respect to water redox potential levels has been analyzed, which shows the GaPSb/Si association is an interesting combination both for the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions. These results open new routes for the development of III-V/Si low-cost high-efficiency photo-electrochemical cells.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0927-0248	1879-3398		WOS:000603561700001

It was demonstrated that the steady-state rest potential of a copper electrode is very close to that of a cupric ion selective electrode for most part of the duration of the respective experimental runs and therefore can be considered to be determined by traces of divalent copper in the aqueous solution. No evidence of sustained corrosion of copper was found by the methods employed. The results were interpreted by a kinetic model previously proposed for shorter exposures with the addition of the disproportionation reaction of monovalent copper to explain the persistence of soluble divalent copper at longer exposure times. A hypothesis on possible hydrogen formation by a catalytic mechanism involving adsorbed CuOH is advanced and a preliminary estimate of the upper limit of hydrogen production rate is obtained using calculation results from the kinetic model.

To ameliorate this problem, the free-standing and carbon-free CoO nanowire array cathode was purposely designed for Li-O-2 batteries. The single CoO nanowire formed as a special mesoporous structure, owing even comparable specific surface area and pore volume to the typical Super-P carbon particles. In addition to the highly selective oxygen reduction/evolution reactions catalytic activity of CoO cathodes, both excellent discharge specific capacity and cycling efficiency of Li-O-2 batteries were obtained, with 4888 mAh gcoO(-1) and 50 cycles during 500 h period. Owing to the synergistic effect between elaborate porous structure and selective intermediate absorption on CoO crystal, a unique bimodal growth phenomenon of discharge products was occasionally observed, which further offers a novel mechanism to control the formation/decomposition morphology of discharge products in nanoscale. This research work is believed to shed light on the future development of high-performance aprotic Li-O-2 batteries.									55	4	0	0	2	0	56			1944-8244			WOS:000363438000052	26400109

Herein, a hierarchical core-shell NiP2@MoO2/Co(Ni)MoO4 cuboid array electrode with superhydrophilic/superaerophobic properties is successfully fabricated and the formation mechanism of the core-shell structure is systematically investigated. Through an in situ partially converted gas-solid reaction during the phosphating process, Ni and Co elements are leached and rearranged to form NiP2 particles and amorphous CoO as the shell layer and the inner undecomposed Co(Ni)MoO4 crystals serve as the core layer. Because of its seamless core-shell structure and superhydrophilicity/superaerophobicity of hierarchical cuboid arrays, NiP2@MoO2/Co(Ni)MoO4 exhibits superior HER activity in 1 M KOH with only an overpotential of 297 mV to deliver 1000 mA cm(-2) and can work steadily for 650 h at 200 mA cm(-2). Remarkably, when coupled with NiFe LDH for overall water splitting, it can drive an AA battery with an ultralow cell voltage of 1.49 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2). This work sheds new light on designing large-current-density efficient HER electrocatalysts for large-scale industrial applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000813076200001	35469395

The potential improvement of hydrogen production processes involves the reduction of the oxidation reaction overpotential, as well as the prohibition of photo-generated electron-hole combination in the photoelectrocatalytic process. Herein, we present high efficiency hydrogen production from PEC glucose oxidation by employing the ultrathin carbon-coated perovskite (Cr-doped SrTiO3) modified TiO2 nanotube photonic crystal (C@CrSrTiO3/TiO2 NTPC) as a photoanode material. The photocurrent density of the C@ Cr-SrTiO3/TiO2 NTPC photoanode reached as high as 0.43 mA cm(-2) at the bias potential of 0.6 V (vs. SCE) and in glucose electrolyte, which is about 4.8 and 3.3 times higher than that of TiO2 NTPC and C@ Cr-SrTiO3/TiO2 NTPC photoanode in pure KOH electrolyte, respectively. The excellent PEC activity and photoelectrochemical performance can be attributed to the less endergonic process of glucose oxidation compared to water oxidation. Additionally, the rational design and fabrication of C@ Cr-SrTiO3/TiO2 NTPC is favorable towards the high-efficiency generation and transfer of photo-generated electrons, due to the high electrical conductivity and fast transport characteristics of the ultrathin carbon layer, the superior visible light absorption properties of Cr-SrTiO3 and the independently modulating carrier diffusion length of TiO2 NTPC. A probable mechanism for PEC hydrogen production from glucose oxidation over the ultrathin carbon-coated heterostructure photoanode is proposed and discussed.									38	3	0	0	4	0	40			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000374413300020

Searching for low-cost and efficient electrocatalysts toward hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) is of great importance for commercial application of water electrolysis. Cobased phosphides and oxides/hydroxides are extensively developed as HER and OER electrocatalysts, respectively. Herein, a novel strategy is developed to prepare a self-supported N-doped CoP ultrathin nanosheets (namely N-Co-Ni-P/Ni) for HER and Fe-doped CoOOH nanosheets (namely Fe-Co-OOH/Ni) for OER based on the MOF-derived Co(OH)(2) nanosheets, along with short lateral size caused by Co-MOF confinement growth. The self-supported N-Co-Ni-P demands an overpotential of 50 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline conditions (1M) for HER The self-supported Fe-Co-OOH nanosheet electrocatalysts also exhibit high catalytic activity for OER. The experimental measurements demonstrate that the increased positive charge of Co atoms caused by the introduction of N atoms can significantly enhance HER performance. Moreover, the large surface areas, high exposure of active sites, and effective mass transport channels are also favorable to improved catalytic activity. The electrolyzer with N-Co-Ni-P/Ni and Fe-Co-OOH shows excellent activity with an electrolysis voltage of 1.51 Vat 10 mA cm which is superior to the Pt(-)//Ir/Ta (+) electrolyzer (1.62 V).									28	0	0	0	0	0	28			2168-0485			WOS:000543715400007

Herein, two-dimensional (2D) bimetal-MOFs (CoxFe-MOF) nanosheets with a thickness of similar to 10 nm are synthesized and employed for OER and NRR in alkaline medium. By regulating the composition of CoxFe-MOF, the optimized Co3Fe-MOF can achieve an overpotential of 280 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 38 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, outperforming the commercial RuO2 (351 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), 99 mV dec(-1)). The enhanced OER performance can be attributed to the abundant active centers and the positive coupling effect between Co and Fe metal ions in the MOF. Additionally, the NRR performance of the obtained Co3Fe-MOF is evaluated on glassy carbon electrode to achieve real NH3 faradaic efficiencies (FE) and NH3 yield rates. The Co3Fe-MOF delivers a FE up to 25.64% with the corresponding NH3 yield rate of 8.79 mu g h(-1) mg(cat)(-1) at -0.2 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. The results indicate the potential application of 2D MOFs in NRR and provide the rational design of efficient electrocatalysts for coupling both OER and NRR in a full-cell configuration.									57	6	0	0	1	0	60			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000521346600010

The flow mode experiments revealed thermokinetic oscillations, i.e., the oscillatory rate of heat evolution accompanying the process and the corresponding oscillations in the differential heat of process, in sync with oscillatory conversion of hydrogen. Mathematical evidence has been found for the deterministic character of the aperiodic oscillations. In the outburst of quasiperiodic oscillations of large amplitude, the instances of differential heats as high as 700 kJ/mol H-2 have been detected, exceeding the heat of the gaseous water formation from elements (242 kJ/mol H-2) by a factor of nearly 3. Another occurrence of anomalously high thermal effects has been measured in calorimetric oxygen titration using 0.09 mu mol pulses of O-2 injected onto hydrogen- or deuterium-saturated catalysts, including 2%Pd/Al2O3, 5%Pd/Al2O3 and 2%PdAu/Al2O3. Repeatedly, the saturation/oxidation cycles showed the heat evolutions in certain individual O-2 pulses as high as 1100 kJ/mol O-2, i.e., 550 kJ/mol H-2, again 2 times as much as the heat of water formation. It has been pointed out that it seems prudent for the PAR technologists to assume a much larger rate of heat evolution than those calculated on the basis of a standard thermodynamic value of the heat of water formation, in order to account for the possibility of large thermokinetic oscillation occasionally appearing in the recombination process of hydrogen. A possible relation of the anomalous heat evolution to an inadvertent occurrence of low energy nuclear reaction (LENR) phenomena is also briefly considered.									10	1	0	0	1	0	10			0888-5885			WOS:000358555500005

With the help of a self-built high-temperature tube furnace, the coal samples were processed under different temperatures and gas atmospheres. Through comprehensive use of electron microscope scanning, low temperature nitrogen adsorption, and C-13 NMR, the pores and fractures development rules of coal before and after heat treatment were researched. The coal samples heated in nitrogen atmosphere produced many strip-shaped fractures and coal debris, while the coal samples heated in air atmosphere produced many pores and an evident melting phenomenon. In addition, the proportion of carboxyl groups in coal samples heated in nitrogen atmosphere was always greater than that of the coal heated in air atmosphere. The pore specific surface area and volume of coal samples heated under air atmosphere increased significantly, while the degree of development was significantly reduced in nitrogen atmosphere. Thereby weakening the coal-oxygen reaction to a certain extent and inhibiting the generation of harmful gases (CO, CH4, etc.), which is conducive to preventing coal spontaneous combustion disasters.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000824278300007

However, only 4% of the total hydrogen is produced in this way because the electrode materials are expensive, inefficient, or unstable. Here, it is reported that the large-scale 3D printed martensitic steel (AerMet100) can be the bifunctional electrode for AWE with high catalytic performance, which may dramatically increase the green-hydrogen percentage in the market and provide strategic planning for energy management. It is found that the martensitic steel by fast anodization (3 min) can realize ultra-high hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER), and excellent stability at high current densities. Particularly, this electrocatalyst shows a low overpotential of 3.18 V and long-term stability over 140 h at 570 mA cm(-2) in overall water splitting. Additionally, the treated large-scale steel can work well under a very high current up to 20 A. This study demonstrates that martensitic steel can be commercialized as a highly efficient catalyst for industrial hydrogen production in AWE, which should provide solutions to the energy crisis and environmental pollution.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000772772700001

Fresh Pd powder was found to have very low stationary initial catalytic activity. The activity gradually rose with time on stream reaching a certain value where oscillations of the reaction rate began. The oscillation phases with relatively high catalytic activity were accompanied by a periodic accumulation/removal of carbon in Pd bulk, whereas during the low activity phases a periodic accumulation/removal of oxygen in Pd surface layer took place. The correlation between Pd oxidation state and catalytic activity was drawn. The metallic Pd had the lowest catalytic activity in alkane oxidation at high partial pressure of O-2 and while the highest catalytic activity was observed at low partial pressure and high conversion of O-2. Microscopic study of Pd samples revealed that the catalyst evolution caused changes in Pd surface morphology resulting in formation of sponge-like structure. In turn, such morphological changes were found to increase duration and intensity of the high activity phase. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To mitigate the adverse issue, combustion technologies of a new type were successfully developed and debuted around 1990, associated with various terms of "flameless oxidation (FLOX)", "flameless combustion (FLC)", "high-temperature air combustion (HiTAC)", and "moderate and intense low-oxygen dilution (MILD) combustion". These combustion processes may be regarded as similar or the same class of combustion, because they all involve high preheat and deep dilution of individual reactants (non-premixed) or the reactant mixture (premixed), prior to main combustion reactions, with high-temperature flue gases (burnt products) internally and/or externally. Very significantly, all of these combustion technologies can simultaneously achieve high efficiency and ultralow emissions of nitric oxides (NOx), light, and noise. This class of combustion has been frequently unified as "MILD combustion". Highly worthy to note, as a particular type of combustion, the MILD combustion has thus far been most extensively explored, resulting in many hundreds to 1000 academic articles published by various energy-related journals and conferences. The present review summarizes the research progress in the gaseous-fuel MILD combustion on its definition, ignition, evolution, and NOx emissions, specifically, through its aspects associated with open jet flames in hot coflow and industrial flames in combustion chamber or furnace. Also, discussions are provided on the relevant terminologies, existing problems, and further fundamental issues.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000648878900037

OH radical uptake by laboratory-generated levoglucosan and methyl-nitrocatechol particles, serving as surrogates for biomass burning aerosol, is determined as a function of RH. Increasing RH lowers the viscosity of amorphous levoglucosan aerosol particles enabling enhanced OH uptake. Conversely, OH uptake by methyl-nitrocatechol aerosol particles is suppressed at higher RH as a result of competitive coadsorption of H2O that occupies reactive sites. This is shown to have substantial impacts on organic aerosol lifetimes with respect to OH oxidation. The results emphasize the importance of organic aerosol phase state to accurately describe the multiphase chemical kinetics and thus chemical aging process in atmospheric models to better represent the evolution of organic aerosol and its role in air quality and climate.									103	5	0	0	25	0	106			0094-8276	1944-8007		WOS:000340536000051

The phase compositions and microstructures of the oxide scales for early stage oxidation were investigated by using glancing angle XRD and SEM equipped with EDS. The results showed that during the initial oxidation stage Cr-rich oxide film formed and then it covered the sample surface rapidly. The initial Cr-rich oxide film was mainly composed of FeCr2O4, (Fe,Cr)2O3 and Fe2O3. This oxide film acted as a barrier against outward diffusion of iron and inward diffusion of oxygen. During the initial oxidation stage, chromium in the sample surface was consumed gradually, and then a large amount of iron ions penetrated the oxide film and diffused rapidly to the sample surface, resulting in forming an outer ldquonon-protectiverdquo Fe2O3 layer.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0030-770X			INSPEC:14554025

To ease the water oxidation process, the development of stable, robust, and efficient catalysts is needed that can operate under mild conditions. Here we present the heterogenization of a Cu-based molecule [Cu(MC)](ClO4)(2) (where MC = 5,7,7,12,14,14-hexamethyl-1,4,8,11-tetra-azacyclotetradeca-4,11-diene) by immobilizing it on a 4-(pyridine-4 '-amido)benzene (L) layer modified gold electrode and explore its activity for the electrocatalytic oxidation of water in neutral phosphate buffer solution. The modified electrode was characterized using FE-SEM, EDX, ATR-FTIR, SERS, CV, and EIS techniques. The newly developed surface-bound complex [Cu(MC)]-L-Au can catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) exceptionally well with an onset overpotential of 227 mV (J = 1.0 mA cm(-2)), an overpotential similar to 284 mV at J = 1.32 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 48 mV decade(-1).

The intrinsic activity of electrocatalysts is determined by its electronic structure, whereas the apparent activity can be further optimized by reasonable design on micro-/nanostructures of electrocatalysts. The core goal of electrocatalytic research is to reveal the relationship between the structure and performance of electrocatalysts, which is also the basis of reasonable design and construction of efficient electrocatalysts. Traditional synthetic methods, namely bottom-up and top-down routes, usually induce the change of different structural parameters at the same time. The solid-state conversion strategy, which is converts solid precursors into target materials through chemical reactions, has been widely adopted to produce materials with precisely controllable structures. In this Minireview, we focus on recent advances in the solid-state conversion synthesis of water-splitting electrocatalysts. First, the basis of solid-state conversion chemistry is introduced. Then, the specific methods of precise control of electronic structure by solid-state conversion and the relationship between electronic structure and performance are summarized. Based on the understanding of the electronic structure-performance relationship, synergistic regulation of electronic structure and micro-/nanostructures by solid-state conversion to achieve the copromotion of intrinsic activity and apparent activity are described.

The fascinating properties of graphic carbon nitride (g-CN) in water splitting make the photoelectrode engineering of it for PEC use quite meaningful. In this work, we report the fabrication of the core shell-structured TiO2/g-CN composite film by hydrothermal growth for TiO2 nanorod arrays and solvothermal growth for the g-CN layer. Herein, TiO2 is used as an effective electron-transfer layer, and g-CN is used as a visible light absorption layer. Different reaction conditions were investigated in order to obtain the uniform TiO2/g-CN nanorod core shell structure. Outstanding photo electrochemical performances of the optimized composites were obtained compared to that of pristine TiO2 or g-CN because the high-quality heterojunction between g-CN and TiO2 turned out to effectively reduce the recombination of charge carriers and improve the photoelectric conversion ability. Thus, the photocurrent density under visible light of TiO2/g-CN reached 80.9 pA cm(-2), which is 21 times that of g-CN under 0.6 V (vs SCE). Finally, a systematic photoelectrocatalytic mechanism of charge carrier migration and the recombination path in the TiO2/g-CN nanorod core shell heterojunction was proposed, which can be considered to be a probable explanation of efficient PEC performance.									60	3	0	0	7	0	61			0743-7463			WOS:000390619900003	27936327

TiO2 thin films treated with HF solution (HF-TiO2) were found to exhibit a remarkable enhancement of the photocatalytic activity for H-2 evolution from a methanol aqueous solution, as well as efficient photoelectrochemical performance under UV light irradiation as compared with the untreated TiO2. Moreover, Pt-loaded HF-TiO2 thin films were found to act as efficient and stable photocatalysts for the decomposition of water under UV light irradiation. The mechanistic insights obtained in the present study will be useful in the design of highly efficient photocatalysts for the decomposition of water.

The effects of the layer composition and preparation temperature on the electrochemical. morphological and microstructural characteristics and durability were investigated. An increase in the voltammetric anodic charge was observed, which has a maximum value for the nominal composition RuO2-Nb2O5 70:30 mol%. The voltammetric charge of the RUO2-Nb2O5 70:30 mol% electrodes was maximum for those prepared at 300 degrees C. A decrease in the voltammetric charge was detected as the preparation temperature increased, which could be related to the crystallization process and reduction of the surface area of the layer. X-ray diffraction patterns show the main peaks of RuO2 in rutile phase for nominal compositions higher than 30 mol% of RuO2. On the other hand, Nb2O5 orthorhombic crystalline phase was observed only for electrodes prepared at 600 degrees C. The highest value of the accelerated stability test (AST) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was 22.0 h per mg of RuO2 for the Ti/RuO2-Nb2O5 70:30 mol% composition.

J	Ikeuchi, M; Shukla, VK; Pakrasi, HB; Inoue, Y								Directed inactivation of the psbl gene does not affect Photosystem II in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp PCC 6803								MOLECULAR AND GENERAL GENETICS				249	6			622	628		10.1007/BF00418031				DEC 20 1995	1995	PsbI is a small, integral membrane protein component of photosystem II (PSII), a pigment-protein complex in cyanobacteria, algae and higher plants. To understand the function of this protein, we have isolated the psbI gene from the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and determined its nucleotide sequence. Using an antibiotic-resistance cartridge to disrupt and replace the psbI gene, we have created mutants of Synechocystis 6803 that lack the PsbI protein. Analysis of these mutants revealed that absence of the PsbI protein results in a 25-30% loss of PSII activity. However, other PSII polypeptides are present in near wild-type amounts, indicating that no significant destabilization of the PSII complex has occurred. These results contrast with recently reported data indicating that PsbI-deficient mutants of the eukaryotic alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii are highly light-sensitive and have a significantly lower (80-90%) titer of the PSII complex. In Synechocystis 6803, PsbI-deficient cells appear to be slightly more photosensitive than wild-type cells, suggesting that this protein, while not essential for PSII biogenesis or function, plays a role in the optimization of PSII activity.									36	0	0	0	34	0	37			0026-8925			WOS:A1995TN59300006	8544827

The formation, structure, high temperature reactivity, and magnetic susceptibility of phase pure YPrO3+delta (0 <= delta < 0.46) are reported. The topotactic reduction and oxidation of the YPrO3+delta system was investigated by powder X-ray in situ diffraction experiments and revealed bixbyite structures (space group: Ia<(3)over bar>) throughout the series. Combined neutron and X-ray data clearly show oxygen uptake and removal. The research provides a detailed picture of the Y3+/Pr3+/Pr4+ sublattice evolution in response to the redox chemistry. Upon oxidation, cation site splitting is observed where the cation in the (1/4 1/4, 1/4) position migrates along the body diagonal to the (x, x, x) position. Any oxygen in excess of YPrO3.0 is located in the additional 16c site without depopulating the original 48e site. The in situ X-ray diffraction data and thermal gravimetric analysis have revealed the reversible topotactic redox reactivity at low temperatures (below 425 degrees C) for all compositions from YPrO3 to YPrO3.46. Magnetic susceptibility studies were utilized in order to further confirm praseodymium oxidation states. The linear relation between the cubic unit cell parameter and oxygen content allows for the straightforward determination of oxygen stoichiometry from X-ray diffraction data. The different synthesis strategies reported here are rationalized with the structural details and the reactivity of YPrO3+delta phases and provide guidelines for the targeted synthesis of these functional materials.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000371753500048	26878461

The addition of acetic acid and its variation creates a strong bond with oxide surfaces, which generates various oxidizing agents. X-ray diffraction analysis of the prepared TiO2 nanoparticles reveals their semicrystalline nature. The results show that holes are captured by the surface and subsurface, producing equivalent to Ti-IV-OH center dot, equivalent to Ti-IV -O center dot- - Ti-IV equivalent to and the reducing agent =Ti-III-, which act as active oxidizers during photocatalysis, thus confirming the occurrence of an OH radical via an advanced oxidation process. Increasing the acetic acid amount leads to disordered structural defects below the conduction band (CB). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis shows the induction of hydroxylation of surface defects, such as Ti-OH. The results indicate that an oxygen vacancy is favourable due to a large number of surface defects. Detailed discussion of the energy band structure with the concept of a valence band (VB) and a CB maximum is implemented. The electron-withdrawing carboxylic group can affect oxygen vacancies and acetate ligands on the photocatalyst surface. The formation of a bidentate acetate adstructure with a lower acetic acid concentration leads to an explanation for higher visible-light-driven methylene blue degradation. The mechanism for the formation of an additional Ti-O-Ti bond by a condensation process is also illustrated elaborately. Theoretical calculations of the potentials of the VB and CB show the effects of active sites on degradation and can be associated with redox reactions for water splitting abilities. A possible model of sensitized photocatalysis for hydrogen production with hydrogen and oxygen evolution sites is also proposed in this article. Thus, TiO2 nanoparticles with acetic acid variation are promising sources for photocatalytic/catalytic applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0268-1242	1361-6641		WOS:000760504600001

However, their practical application is still hindered by the suboptimal activity and tedious preparation. In this work, self-supported transition-metal phosphide microarrays have been synthesized on Ni foam via electrodeposition followed by a low-temperature gaseous phosphorization. We discover that Ni2P or Ni-x-Co-y-P can be obtained with tunable composition. Among the obtained phosphides with different Ni and Co contents, Ni-1-Co-1-P exhibits a low overpotential of only 90 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for HER in 1 M KOH, whereas that of Ni2P is as high as 137 mV. Furthermore, Ni-1-Co-1-P also demonstrates a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of only 292 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). An overall water splitting device has been assembled with two Ni-1-Co-1-P electrodes, and it displays an excellent performance at 1.65 V for a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) with a good stability up to 30 h. The density functional theory calculation results suggest that by incorporating Co into the phosphide, the surface electronic structure of Ni-1-Co-1-P has been optimized, showing a much smaller Gibbs free energy change of absorbed intermediates during the HER and OER than Ni2P. Considering the ease in fabrication and the superior performance, this material displays good potential for industrial applications at a large scale.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2196-0216			WOS:000616356900001

We studied in the laboratory the thermal evolution of a model ice sample: a mixture of water, hydrogen peroxide, dioxygen, and ozone produced by irradiating solid H2O2 with 50 keV H+ at 17 K. The changes in composition and release of volatiles during warming to 200 K were monitored by infrared spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and microbalance techniques. We find evidence for voids in the water component from the infrared bands due to dangling H bonds. The absorption from these bands increases during heating and can be observed at temperatures as high as similar to 155 K. More O-2 is stored in the radiolyzed film than can be retained by codeposition of O-2 and H2O. This O-2 remains trapped until similar to 155 K, where it desorbs in an outburst as water ice crystallizes. Warming of the ice also drastically decreases the intrinsic absorbance of O-2 by annealing defects in the ice. We also observe loss of O-3 in two stages during heating, which correlates with desorption and possibly chemical reactions with radicals stored in the ice, triggered by the temperature increase.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000235837200015

Through comparing the changes of microstructure, thermal residual stress, interface bonding state, and interface microstructure evolution of composites before and after heat treatment, the evolution of mechanical and dielectric properties of Si3N4f/BN/Si3N4 composites was analyzed. Flexural strength and fracture toughness of composites acquired the maximum values of 96 +/- 5 MPa and 3.8 +/- 0.1 MPa.m(1/2), respectively, after heat treatment at 800 degrees C; however, these values were maintained at 83 +/- 6 MPa and 3.1 +/- 0.2 MPa.m(1/2) after heat treatment at 1200 degrees C, respectively. The relatively low mechanical properties are mainly attributed to the strong interface bonding caused by interfacial diffusion of oxygen and subsequent interfacial reaction and generation of turbostratic BN interphase with relatively high fracture energy. Moreover, the Si3N4f/BN/Si3N4 composites also displayed moderate dielectric constant and dielectric loss fluctuating irregularly around 5.0 and 0.04 before and after heat treatment, respectively. They were mainly determined based on the intrinsic properties of materials system and complex microstructure of composites.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0955-2219	1873-619X		WOS:000564727300001

However, this remains a huge challenge. In this work, the catalytic performance of transition metal-phthalocyanine (TM-Pc) monolayers as single-atom catalysts for the electroreduction of CO2 was systematically investigated by spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our results show that the bonding of single metal atoms with Pc can be large enough for the individual atoms to be uniformly dispersed and anchored in a modified 2D TM-Pc monolayer. Considering the competing hydrogen evolution reaction, TM-Pc has a good hydrogen evolution inhibition. The main CRR reduction products of Sc-Pc, Ti-Pc, V-Pc, and Fe-Pc monolayers are CH4. For Cr-Pc, Mn-Pc, and Zn-Pc monolayers, HCOOH is dominant, while for Co-Pc, HCHO is predicted. Except for the Sc-Pc, Ti-Pc, and V-Pc monolayers by (with too large overpotentials, exceeding 1 V), the reduction overpotential of other TM-Pc catalysts are in the range of 0.017-0.819 V, among them Mn-Pc has the lowest overpotential (0.017 V) and Fe-Pc has the highest overpotential (0.819 V). These were all lower than the overpotentials of well-studied copper which has the best catalytic performance. Therefore, our work may open up new avenues for the development of highly efficient catalytic materials for CO2 reduction.									90	3	1	0	7	0	90			2168-0485			WOS:000449577200207

Sulfate adsorption on platinum was found to generate positive feedback, promoting the electrooxidation of sulfide and introducing new hidden N-shaped negative differential resistance (HN-NDR) oscillations at approximately 2.3-2.6V. In terms of patterns at the electrode/electrolyte interface, sulfate addition inhibited oxygen formation and promoted the emergence of rich patterns in the transpassive potential region due to synchronous sulfur deposition and dissolution, fronts, spirals, and multiarm spirals. A mechanism for HN-NDR oscillations induced by the competitive adsorption of sulfate and hydroxide was proposed, and the effects of sulfate adsorption on Pt oxides in a pure sodium hydroxide solution were elucidated: chemisorbed sulfate ions significantly inhibited the formation of high-valence Pt oxides and delayed the oxygen evolution potential by 0.55V.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000467618000024

According to the chemical analysis of individual nanoparticles, the redox treatments promote the formation of more compositionally homogenous ceria zirconia solid solution nanoparticles, resulting in a uniform low-temperature reduction. Local pyrochlore-type cation ordering in individual nanoparticles was also observed after the high temperature reduction step. For nanoparticles with 70% ceria content, redox cycling treatment was critical to obtain material which exhibits a strong low temperature reducibility. The origin of significant X-ray diffraction line broadening and particle sintering mechanism in the solid solution nanopowders are discussed based on compositional and structural variation within and between individual nanoparticles and oxygen vacancies formed during high temperature reduction treatment.									10	0	0	0	1	0	9			0959-9428			WOS:000281223200028

However, because saltwater such as seawater contains Cl-, O-2 and HClO are produced competitively during oxidation reactions by photogenerated holes from electrolytes containing CI- during the photoelectrolysis reaction. HClO is a high value-added chemical used for bleaching, etc., however, it is also an undesirable chemical that accelerates corrosion deterioration of large-scale water splitting systems. Therefore, it is necessary to control selectivity of oxidative O-2/HClO production in electrolytes containing Cl- over photoelectrodes. In this review, we summarized our recent innovations in selective O-2 or HClO production over the visible-light driven BiVO4/WO3 photoanodes by simple modification of metal oxides. Modifications of metal oxides such as MnOx or CoOx via spin-coating onto a photoelectrode could control the selectivity on the O-2/HClO production from an aqueous solution containing Cl effectively. In addition, controlling loading conditions such as the loading amount of metal oxides, and calcination temperatures after coating a metal precursor solution enabled us to prepare photoelectrodes that produce O-2 or HClO with selectivity of almost 100 % using MnOx or CoOx, respectively, along with maintaining their PEC performance under solar-light irradiation.

The model was used to numerically investigate the influence of air traces on the evolution of the helium dielectric barrier discharge (DBD). The level of dry air used as impurity was in the range from 0 to 1500 ppm, which corresponds to the most commonly encountered range in atmospheric pressure discharge experiments. The results presented in this study clearly show that the plasma chemistry and consequently the discharge evolution is highly affected by the concentration level of impurities in the mixture. In particular, it was observed that air traces assist the discharge ignition at low concentration levels (similar to 55 ppm), while on the other hand, they increase the burning voltage at higher concentration levels (similar to 1000 ppm). Furthermore, it was found that the discharge symmetry during the voltage cycle highly depends on the concentration of air. For the interpretation of the results, a detailed analysis of the processes that occur in the discharge gap is performed and the main reaction pathways of ion production are described. Thanks to this approach, useful insight into the physics behind the evolution of the discharge is obtained.									57	8	0	0	0	0	60			0963-0252	1361-6595		WOS:000385494000004

The experiment was performed by using a novel cell for in operando measurements capable to overcome the so called pressure gap'. We have found that the oxidation of Cu proceeds through the formation of Cu(I) oxide domains in the micron and submicron range size, the evolution of which affects the overall morphology of the Cu surface as well. Chemical and morphological changes have been simultaneously detected. It was, surprisingly, found that during the oxidation process in many areas domains having +1 valence state do not spread on the metallic regions which homogenously oxidize; no chemical oxidizing wave was detected by the available lateral resolution and time frame.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			0142-2421	1096-9918		WOS:000443706000003

ANNALES DE CHIMIE-SCIENCE DES MATERIAUX				28				S215	S222					1	2003	2003	This paper presents a study on the growth of yttrium mixed oxides on a model alumina-forming alloy Fe-20Cr-5Al, in sir at 1100degreesC. In situ X-ray diffraction has been used to follow the yttrium mixed oxides evolution. Two different introduction modes of yttrium (MOCVD and ion implantation) have been applied on their alloy surface. On yttrium implanted specimens YAlO3 and Y3Al5O12 appear at the same time at the beginning of the oxidation at high temperature. With time, Y3Al5O12 progressively totally replaces YAlO3. On MOCVD coated specimens, Y2O3 firstly leads to the formation of YAlO3. Y3Al5O12 is only observed after five hours of oxidation due to a reaction between YAlO3 and Al2O3.					13th French-Polish Seminar on Reactivity of Solids13th French-Polish Seminar on Reactivity of Solids	SEP 03-05, 2002SEP 03-05, 2002		CLUNY, FRANCECLUNY, FRANCE	3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0151-9107			WOS:000187152900025

J	Liu, Jialin; Bi, Hai; Zhang, Lei; Zhou, Gang								Transition metal Dual-Atom Ni-2/TiO2 catalysts for photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen Evolution: A density functional theory study								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				608						155132	10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.155132				JAN 15 2023	2023	Dual-atom catalysts (DACs), compared with single-atom catalysts (SACs) that have been widely studied, are now in their infancy, although they are expected to have unique catalytic properties. Here, we propose and investigate the Ni-2 dimer on TiO2 system, Ni-2/TiO2, that is taken as a representative of metal oxide-supported transition metal DACs, for electrocatalytic and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution using density functional theory calculations. A bottom-up self-assembly approach is developed, which can be generalized to transition metal DACs. The localization and hybridization of electronic states of the Ni2 dimer are illustrated from the coordination environments. As compared with Ni-1/TiO2 SACs, the delocalized states of the Ni2 dimer of Ni-2/TiO2 not only increase the reaction sites and the reduction capacities, but also positively change the H adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics, facilitating hydrogen production. The band gap of Ni-2/TiO2 is narrowed into the visible region, and deep trap levels in the gap are smeared, improving the photoactivity efficiency. Our study presents a facile adsorption-deposition method to design and fabricate oxide-supported transition metal DACs for photo(electro)catalytic H-2 production.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000874101700002

When interactions between these two species occurred at the surface of the solid powder, an obvious CL effect was obtained. This performance could be attributed to the evolution of a ROOOH intermediate, which subsequently released emissive O-1(2) species. This is the first report analyzing the gas solid phase CL performance of O-3 with alcohols, phenols, and saccharides. It is believed that this strategy can be extended to applications in other gas solid phase CL analyses utilizing the O-3 system. This has also created a novel area of gas solid CL performance; thus, relevant processes and mechanisms can be deduced and identified.									4	1	0	0	1	0	5			0743-7463			WOS:000399860000012	28316231

The effect of annealing atmosphere on microstructure and electrical properties were investigated. All the NBTMn thin films crystallize into the single-phase rhombohedral distorted perovskite structure with a competitive growth mode among various orientations. With the decrease of the content for oxygen vacancies in O-2, the improved insulating property and enhanced ferroelectricity (P-r =38 mu C/cm(2)) can be obtained in NBTMn thin film. Also, the relative dielectric constant and loss tangent are 501 and 0.04 at 100 kHz, respectively. The evolution of performances for NBTMn film annealed at different ambiences can be analyzed in terms of defect dipoles and free oxygen vacancies based on defect chemistry. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Because of the hysteresis phenomenon, IrO2 is rarely used as a cathode material for the HER. Herein, an IrO2-TiO2 composite oxide was prepared using the thermal decomposition method. The physical and electrochemical characterization of the materials was achieved by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). In the process of the HER, the current of IrO2 is only 1.91 mA cm(-2)@-0.2 V in the first segment scan. However, at the 51, 101 and 151 segment scan, the HER current increases to 6.85, 15.7 and 18.2 mA cm(-2)@-0.2 V, respectively. During the activation process of IrO2, the HER current has increased ten times. Compared with the HER activity of IrO2, there is almost no hysteresis for the IrO2-TiO2 electrode. In the first segment scan, the HER current has already reached 27.9 mA cm(-2)@-0.2 V and further increased to 31.1, 33.1 and 35.0 mA cm(-2) at the 51, 101 and 151 segment scan. The difference between them is not significant, which means that the IrO2-TiO2 electrode does not need activation. The IrO2-TiO2 electrode has exhibited a higher HER activity than the IrO2 electrode, which may be attributed to the electronic structure modification and the increase of the electrochemical area.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000405276100014

Nevertheless, due to the complexity of seawater environment, efficient anode catalyst, that should be, cost effective, highly active for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) but negligible for Cl-2/ClO- formation, and robust toward chlorine corrosion, is urgently demanded for large-scale application. Although catalysis typically appears at surface, while the bulk properties and morphology structure also have a significant impact on the performance, thus requiring a systematic optimization. Herein, a multiscale engineering approach toward the development of cost-effective and robust OER electrocatalyst for operation in seawater is reported. Specifically, the engineering of hollow-sphere structure can facilitate the removal of gas product, while atom-level synergy between Co and Fe can promote Co sites transforming to active phase, and in situ transformation of sulfate ions layer protects catalysts from corrosion. As a result, the as-developed hollow-sphere structured CoFeSx electrocatalyst can stably operate at a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in the alkaline simulated seawater (pH = 13) for 700 h and in a neutral seawater for 20 h without attenuation. It provides a new strategy for the development of electrocatalysts with a broader application potential.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2198-3844		WOS:000821630200001	35798320	
J	Zhang, Di; Guo, Yongle; Zhao, Zhongkui					Guo, Yongle/0000-0002-0632-655X			Porous defect-modified graphitic carbon nitride via a facile one-step approach with significantly enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation								APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL				226				1	9		10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.12.044				JUN 15 2018	2018	Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has been considered as one of the most promising photocatalysts for solar energy conversion. However, the intrinsic drawbacks of insufficient visible-light absorption and poor charge separation efficiency seriously limit its practical applications in visible light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. In this work, a facile one-step strategy was proposed to construct a novel porous defect-modified graphitic carbon nitride (P-DCN) via thermal polymerization of a freeze-dried crystalline mixture containing dicyandiamide (DCDA) and ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) under nitrogen atmosphere, in which both porous feature and two types of defects (cyano group and nitrogen vacancy) were simultaneously introduced into g-C3N4 framework. Results show that the as-synthesized P-DCN Exhibits 26 times higher hydrogen evolution rate (HER) under visible light irradiation than bulk g-C3N4, reaching 20.9 mu mol h(-1). In combination of porous and defective characteristics, P-DCN even demonstrates 2.0 and 1.8 folds higher HER than highly active porous graphitic carbon nitride (P-CN) and defect-modified g-C3N4 (DCN), respectively. The outstanding photocatalytic performance for hydrogen production originates from the remarkably improved visible light harvesting capability, the notably promoted separation and recombination inhibition of photoinduced charge carriers, and the increased amount of active sites and the strengthened mass transfer resulting from the combination effect of the porous feature, as-formed defects, and the enlarged specific surface area. Moreover, this approach could render a new insight for designing highly efficient visible light photocatalysts for the other transformations including CO2 reduction, environmental remediation, and organic synthesis process.									209	6	0	0	27	0	209			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000425476800001

Herein, a nickel-organic compound constituted of elemental nickel and glycine was first synthesized through a solvothermal process in an ethyl alcohol solution. Then, novel 3D hierarchical nanocatalysts consisting of ultrathin N-doped graphitic-nanocarbon-coated nickel clusters with a hollow interior structure were facilely fabricated via calcining the prepared nickel-organic compound. Outstanding electrocatalytic activity with a small overpotential of 70 mV and a low Tafel slope of 119 mV dec(-1) for the hydrogen evolution reaction process can be readily achieved in a 1 M KOH aqueous solution through a controllable synthesis method. The investigation on electrocatalytic activity certifies that the thickness of the graphitic nanocarbon shells has a great influence on water splitting efficiency for hydrogen; the thinner the graphitic nanocarbon shells, the more excellent the electrocatalytic efficiency. Additionally, the detailed electrochemically active surface area suggests that the 3D hollow structured hybridized electrocatalysts with defect-rich ultrathin graphitic nanocarbon shells could limit the aggregation of nickel clusters, and small electrochemical impedance accelerates the penetration of electrons, inducing a high efficiency for electrochemical water splitting. Therefore, thoughtful design using the self-sacrificing template method provides a promising strategy for the fabrication of other hybridized composites with hierarchical architectures consisting of nanoclusters and nanocarbon for more efficient water splitting.									14	2	0	0	0	0	14			2168-0485			WOS:000484071600089

Among La5Ti2CuxAg1-xS5O7 materials, La5Ti2AgS5O7 was found to have the highest performance on Z-scheme overall water splitting in conjunction with PtOx-WO3 as an OEP and a triiodide/iodide (I-3(-)/I-) redox couple as a shuttle electron mediator in a powder-suspension system. Loading Pt/NiS on La5Ti2AgS5O7 benefitted the Z-scheme to achieve an apparent quantum yield of 0.12% at 420nm. The results for this powder-suspension system differ from earlier studies on photocatalyst sheet configurations, in which p-type doping and the formation of a solid solution could effectively enhance the water-splitting activity. This work not only demonstrates a La5Ti2AgS5O7-based Z-scheme water-splitting photocatalyst but also improves the understanding of the difference between particulate sheets and a powder-suspension system available in an optimal strategy for water splitting.									20	3	0	0	0	0	20			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000471314900012	30644173

To explore the damage evolution of this composites after oxidation in wet atmosphere, the changes of damage behavior of composites before and after oxidation were studied using acoustic emission (AE) pattern recognition (PR) technology. Results show that since the damage behavior of the composites changes after oxidation, the optimal number of clusters transforms from 3 to 5. In addition, as the oxidation time increases, the area of concentration of damage events is gradually broadened towards lower stress direction due to the decrease of damage threshold of composites. Meanwhile, because the BN interface is gradually oxidized, the density of C3-cracks (axial yarns cracks) near the fracture and the proportion of Cluster-4 (the signals of transverse yarns cracks) will increase, for which the rising of interfacial shear stress should be responsible. Through this research, not only can the damage evolution of SiCf/SiC-B4C composites after oxidation be understood, but also the method employed in this research can be as guide for studying other similar materials.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000643156400001

This value was determined by measuring the ratio of the N-14(p, n)O-14(0) to N-14(p, n)O-14(1) cross sections via neutron time of flight, and the ratio of N-14(p, n)O-14(0) to N-14(p, n)O-14(1)(gamma)O-14(0) cross sections at the same center-of-mass energy by bombarding a hydrogen target with a N-14 beam and kinematically distinguishing the O-14(0) recoils from the two reaction channels. The present value for GAMMA(gamma) is consistent with other measurements at the 2-sigma level; a weighted mean of all measurements is used to calculate the stellar N-13(p, gamma)O-14 reaction rate, and thereby determine the temperatures and densities at which the stellar carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle is converted to the hot CNO cycle.									14	2	0	0	0	0	15			0556-2813	1089-490X		WOS:A1993LF95600038	9968749

Genome biology				1	6			REVIEWS3003	REVIEWS3003						2000	2000	SUMMARY: Cytochrome P450 proteins, named for the absorption band at 450 nm of their carbon-monoxide-bound form, are one of the largest superfamilies of enzyme proteins. The P450 genes (also called CYP) are found in the genomes of virtually all organisms, but their number has exploded in plants. Their amino-acid sequences are extremely diverse, with levels of identity as low as 16% in some cases, but their structural fold has remained the same throughout evolution. P450s are heme-thiolate proteins; their most conserved structural features are related to heme binding and common catalytic properties, the major feature being a completely conserved cysteine serving as fifth (axial) ligand to the heme iron. Canonical P450s use electrons from NAD(P)H to catalyze activation of molecular oxygen, leading to regiospecific and stereospecific oxidative attack of a plethora of substrates. The reactions carried out by P450s, though often hydroxylation, can be extremely diverse and sometimes surprising. They contribute to vital processes such as carbon source assimilation, biosynthesis of hormones and of structural components of living organisms, and also carcinogenesis and degradation of xenobiotics. In plants, chemical defense seems to be a major reason for P450 diversification. In prokaryotes, P450s are soluble proteins. In eukaryotes, they are usually bound to the endoplasmic reticulum or inner mitochondrial membranes. The electron carrier proteins used for conveying reducing equivalents from NAD(P)H differ with subcellular localization. P450 enzymes catalyze many reactions that are important in drug metabolism or that have practical applications in industry; their economic impact is therefore considerable.									1	5	0	0	1	0	5				1474-760X		MEDLINE:11178272	11178272	
J	Fo, Yumeng; Wang, Miaomiao; Ma, Yanxia; Dong, Hao; Zhou, Xin								Origin of highly efficient photocatalyst NiO/SrTiO3 for overall water splitting: Insights from density functional theory calculations								JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY				292						121683	10.1016/j.jssc.2020.121683				DEC 2020	2020	SrTiO3 loaded with NiO cocatalyst is one of representative photocatalysts for overall water splitting, which have attracted considerable attention. However, the function of NiO particles in the photocatalytic system is still under debate. In this work, we present a theoretical investigation based on density functional theory calculations to reveal the origin of the high photocatalytic performance achieved by loading NiO onto SrTiO3 surface. By considering two terminations of SrTiO3 (001), the interfacial geometries, electronic structures, charge densities and optical absorptions of NiO(001)/SrTiO3 (001) have been calculated. The interface including SrO-termination connecting with NiO(001) (NiO/SrO) has a stronger covalent interaction than the one including TiO2-termination connecting with NiO(001) (NiO/TiO2). The analyses on electronic properties and charge redistributions indicate that the formation of interfacial structures reduces the effective masses of photoinduced carriers and results in a type-II band alignment, which is conducive to separate the photogenerated carriers into two components of the interface. The electrons gathering on SrTiO3 side will take part in the hydrogen evolution reaction, while the holes accumulating on NiO side will participate in the oxygen evolution reaction. It is found that the geometrical reconstruction around the interface has no influence on the extension of absorption edge due to the characteristics of heterostructures with indirect band gap. This study reveals that NiO functions as the water oxidation cocatalyst to suppress the recombination of photoinduced electron and hole pairs, which leads to the enhancement of photocatalytic activity in SrTiO3 system.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000600992000010		
J	Jassim, Esam I.								CFD Modeling of Toxic Element Evolved During Coal Combustion								ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING				40	12			3665	3674		10.1007/s13369-015-1792-9				DEC 2015	2015	The combustion of coal is a complex series of reactions, dominated by the transport mechanism. An aspect that is poorly understood is the influence that the evolution of trace elements has on the environment and the pollution level. To explore this impact, a mathematical model of arsenic was incorporated into a computational fluid dynamics code to predict the behavior of its evolution during the combustion of pulverized coal inside a Drop Tube Furnace. Coal particles are treated as non-interacting spheres with full coupling of mass, momentum and energy with the gaseous phase. The eddy dissipation model is coupled with Arrhenius-type expressions for devolatilization, char combustion, and CO (x) production. The simulation employs the turbulence model, the eddy dissipation model for the gas mixture phase, and the discrete transfer model for particle radiation. The char remaining after devolatilization is considered to be pure carbon, and its reaction is governed by external diffusion of oxygen to the particle surface. The simulation outcome showed a fair prediction of the flame progress, as the flame base was found to be close to the fuel feed source. Flow recirculation was shown to be very lean, resulting in no coal and/or ash particulates near the furnace walls, hence keeping the by-product gas streams flow smoothly toward the furnace exit. The simulation results have also proved that complete combustion in the combustion zone was obtained for the prescribed coal/air ratio. Hence, less NO (x) gasses are emitted. Arsenic oxide, the product of oxidization of the evolved arsenic, is observed to concentrate at high temperature spots, while the trioxide arsenic spreads out through the combustion zones. The conclusion obtained from the simulation could be used as a benchmark for comparison with available experimental data for agreement.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1319-8025	2191-4281		WOS:000364971200024

This study demonstrates an in-depth understanding of pretreatment effects on the photo catalytic O-2 evolution reaction (OER) activity of visible-light-responsive Ta3N5 decorated with CoOx nanoparticles. The CoOx/Ta3N5 sample was synthesized by impregnation followed by sequential heat treatments under NH3 flow and air flow at various temperatures. Various characterization techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), were used to clarify the state and role of cobalt. No improvement in photocatalytic activity for OER over the bare Ta3N5 was observed for the as-impregnated CoOx/Ta3N5, likely because of insufficient contact between CoOx and Ta3N5. When the sample was treated in NH3 at high temperature, a substantial improvement in the photocatalytic activity was observed. After NH3 treatment at 700 degrees C, the Co-0-CoOx core-shell agglomerated cobalt structure was identified by XAS and STEM. No metallic cobalt species was evident after the photocatalytic OER, indicating that the metallic cobalt itself is not essential for the reaction. Accordingly, mild oxidation (200 degrees C) of the NH3-treated CoOx/Ta3N5 sample enhanced photocatalytic OER activity. Oxidation at higher temperatures drastically eliminated the photocatalytic activity, most likely because of unfavorable Ta3N5 oxidation. These results suggest that the intimate contact between cobalt species and Ta3N5 facilitated at high temperature is beneficial to enhancing hole transport and that the cobalt oxide provides electrocatalytic sites for OER.									42	3	0	0	3	0	42			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000360323700029

The redox couples involved in these oxides are CoO2/CoOOH and NiOOH/Ni(OH)(2). The CoO2/CoOOH couple behaves like a confined redox couple at the electrode surface. The influence of a cathodic treatment on the cyclic voltammograms was investigated. The combination of experimental results and thermodynamically calculated electrode potentials allowed us to propose an overall mechanism for the different electro-chemical reactions at these oxides films in alkaline solution.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0151-9107			WOS:000073836300005

However, it remains challenging to fully understand the size-dependent synergistic effect of active sites inherited in substantial nanocatalysts. In this work, four types of small iron clusters Fe-n(n= 1-4) supported on nitrogen-doped graphene sheets are constructed to figure out the size dependence and synergistic effect of active sites for NRR catalytic activities. It is revealed that Fe(3)and Fe(4)clusters on N(4)G supports exhibit higher NRR activity than single-iron atom and iron dimer clusters, showing lowered limiting potential and restricted hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) which is a competitive reaction channel. In particular, the Fe-4-N(4)G displays outstanding NRR performance for "side-on" adsorption of N(2)with a small limiting potential (-0.45 V). Besides the specific structure and strong interface interaction within the Fe-4-N(4)G itself, the high NRR activity is associated with the unique bonding/antibonding orbital interactions of N-N and N-Fe for the adsorptive N(2)and NNH intermediates, as well as relatively large charge transfer between N(2)and the cluster Fe-4-N(4)G.									28	1	0	0	0	0	28			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000541071900002

Recent advances have also revealed that surface engineering, interface engineering, and strain engineering for LDMNs can readily lead to increased surface active centers, strong synergistic effects, and electronic modulation, thus providing new approaches that greatly promote the electrocatalytic performance. In this review, the recent progress in LDMNs is highlighted in the context of their potential as electrocatalysts with superb performance for advanced electrocatalytic reactions. The latest achievements in their structural design, controllable synthesis, mechanistic understanding, and avenues for performance enhancement are illustrated. Strategies for controlled synthesis of high-quality LDMNs and discussed, and to boost the future development of LDMNs for energy-related conversion technology, future perspectives and potential challenges are also proposed.									47	4	0	0	6	0	47			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000567546300001

In pursuit of complementary morphologies, formation of graphene foams is often preferred over the native two-dimensional (2D) forms due to the higher available area. Graphene foams have been successfully prepared by several routes including chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods and by wet-chemical approaches. For these methods, one often needs either high temperature furnaces and highly pure gases or large amounts of strong acids and oxidants. In 2014, using a commercial laser scribing system as found in most machine shops, a direct lasing of polyimide (PI) plastic films in the air converted the PI into 3D porous graphene, a material termed laser-induced graphene (LIG). This is a one-step method without the need for high-temperature reaction conditions, solvent, or subsequent treatments, and it affords graphene with many five-and seven-membered rings. With such an atomic arrangement, one might call LIG "kinetic graphene" since there is no annealing in the process that causes the rearrangement to the preferred all-six-membered-ring form. In this Account, we will first introduce the approaches that have been developed for making LIG and to control the morphology as either porous sheets or fibrils, and to control porosity, composition, and surface properties. The surfaces can be varied from being either superhydrophilic with a 0 degrees contact angle with water to being superhydrophobic having >150 degrees contact angle with water. While it was initially thought that the LIG process could only be performed on PI, it was later shown that a host of other polymeric substrates, nonpolymers, metal/plastic composites, and biodegradable and naturally occurring materials and foods could be used as platforms for generating LIG. Methods of preparation include roll-to-roll production for fabrication of in-plane electronics and two different 3D printing (additive manufacturing) routes to specific shapes of LIG monoliths using both laminated object manufacturing and powder bed fabrication methods. Use of the LIG in devices is performed very simply. This is showcased with high performance supercapacitors, fuel cell materials for oxygen reduction reactions, water splitting for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions coming from the same plastic sheet, sensor devices, oil/water purification platforms, and finally applications in both passive and active biofilm inhibitors. So the ease of formation of LIG, its simple scale-up, and its utility for a range of applications highlights the easy transition of this substrate-bound graphene foam into commercial device platforms.									270	12	0	0	18	0	275			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000439398000005	29924584

Herein, we report an in situ observation of graphene-based self-healing, in which this functional activation is induced by a redox reaction. Specifically, graphene on stainless steel (SUS) switches between graphene (C-C) and graphene oxide (C-O) coordination via an electrical redox reaction to activate water splitting. A heterostructure comprising Pt-NiO thin films on single-layer graphene directly grown on a SUS substrate (Pt-NiO/Gr-SUS) was also synthesized by electrodeposition. Pt-NiO/Gr-SUS exhibited water splitting activity with low Pt loading (<1 wt %). The findings provide valuable insight for designing robust electrodes based on reversible redox-induced self-healable graphene to develop more efficient catalysts.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000744464400001	35029361

Herein, we report a simple method for constructing F, P double-doped Fe3O4 with abundant defect sites for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on iron foam (F, P-Fe3O4/IF). Significantly, the obtained F, P-Fe3O4/IF showed great HER catalytic activity in high- and low-concentration alkaline electrolyte solutions. To drive 100 mA cm(-2), it only required the overpotentials of 179.5 and 149.4 mV in 1 M and 6 M KOH solutions, respectively. Furthermore, the long-time stability test indicated that F, P-Fe3O4/IF lasted for more than 12 h at various high current densities (500, 1000 and 2000 mA cm(-2)), which revealed its great potential in the water electrolysis industry. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that doping with F and P could effectively optimize the electronic structure of Fe3O4, thus lowering the hydrogen adsorption energy. This work provides a unique strategy of utilizing elements with different electronegativities for doping to improve the HER performance of iron oxides.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000669970700001

The obtained catalyst was amorphous in nature, resembling the spherical morphology of Co-B nanoparticles. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that B loses electrons to Co while P gains electrons from Co. This unique electron transfer mechanism in Co-P-B is a combination of the characteristics showcased by Co-B and Co-P catalysts individually. The optimized catalyst (Co-P-B-5) showed overpotentials of 145 mV and 290 mV to achieve the benchmark current density of 10 mA/cm(2) for HER and OER, respectively, in 1 M NaOH. From theoretical calculations, it was observed that addition of P modulates the electron density at Co sites, thereby optimizing the H-adsorption capability, leading to higher HER rate. During anodic polarization, Co-P-B-S shows formation of large number of CoOOH species on its surface, facilitating OER. Finally, stability, recyclability and wide-pH suitability of Co-P-B-5 was established to demonstrate its industrial viability.									79	2	0	0	4	0	81			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000488308800031

For the first time, the photoelectrocatalytic oxygen evolution of Pd@g-C3N4 photoanode was investigated in this research. To elucidate the role of Pd and compare it with Ag, the photocurrent density, photostability, intrinsic electronic properties, and interfacial reaction kinetics at electrode/electrolyte interface were measured. The photoconversion efficiencies of 0.162% at 0.44 V (vs RHE) for Pd2%@g-C3N4 and 0.076% at 0.38 V (vs RHE) for Ag2%@g-C3N4 were achieved under visible light irradiation and are greater than that of g-C3N4 (0.014% at 0.62 V vs RHE). The transient photocurrent density for g-C3N4, Ag2%@g-C3N4, and Pd2%@g-C3N4 photoanodes was achieved as 24.5, 40.6, and 79.2 mu A cm(-2), respectively. The Mott-Schottky plots showed that the degree of band bending for Pd@g-C3N4 is deeper than those of g-C3N4 and Ag@g-C3N4 which leads to the facilitated electron transfer at the photelectrode/electrolyte interface.									23	0	0	0	2	0	23			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000493865700008

The model framework is based on the two-dimensional volatility basis set approach (2D-VBS), in which SOA oxidation products in the model are distributed on the 2-D space of effective saturation concentration (C*(i)) and oxygen-to-carbon ratio (O : C). The modeled organic aerosol mass concentrations (C-OA) and O: C agree with laboratory measurements within estimated uncertainties. However, while both measured and modeled O: C increase with increasing OH exposure as expected, the increase of modeled O: C is rapid at low OH exposure and then slows as OH exposure increases while the increase of measured O: C is initially slow and then accelerates as OH exposure increases. A global sensitivity analysis indicates that modeled C-OA values are most sensitive to the assumed values for the number of C*(i) bins, the heterogeneous OH reaction rate coefficient, and the yield of first-generation products. Modeled SOA O: C values are most sensitive to the assumed O: C of first-generation oxidation products, the number of C*(i) bins, the heterogeneous OH reaction rate coefficient, and the number of O : C bins. All these sensitivities vary as a function of OH exposure. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the 2D-VBS model framework may require modifications to resolve discrepancies between modeled and measured O : C as a function of OH exposure.									19	2	0	0	5	0	19			1680-7316	1680-7324		WOS:000318941300034

STUDIES WITH ISOLATED THYLAKOIDS								PLANT AND CELL PHYSIOLOGY				32	8			1267	1274						DEC 1991	1991	Chilling of leaves of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) at 5-degrees-C in moderate light for 5 h caused almost complete suppression of photosynthetic oxygen evolution in the leaves. Comparison of electron transport activities determined in the presence and absence of an uncoupler, methylamine, indicated that thylakoids prepared from such treated leaves were uncoupled without any significant changes in the capacity for electron transport. Immunoblotting revealed that the amount of coupling factor 1 (CF1) associated with membranes was reduced by the chilling treatment in the light.Thylakoids prepared from leaves that had been chilled in moderate light for 5 h and then rewarmed for 1 h were coupled and capable of synthesising ATP. However, the capacity of leaf photosynthesis was not restored by the rewarming.These results indicate that the thylakoids are uncoupled by the dissociation of some CF1 complexes from the thylakoid membranes during the chilling treatment of leaves in the light and that thylakoids are recoupled by reassociation of CF1 during the subsequent rewarming of the treated leaves at 25-degrees-C. It also appears that chilling in the light causes irreversible damage to reaction(s) other than those involved in electron transport and photophosphorylation.									36	3	0	0	31	0	40			0032-0781			WOS:A1991GV84000018

The addition of a small amount of hydrazine hydrate mediates the deoxygenation of the reaction mixture by the consumption of oxygen through its use to oxidize Cu(0) to Cu2O, followed by the reduction of Cu2O with hydrazine back to the active Cu(0) catalyst. SET-LRP of MA in methanol in the presence of air requires a smaller dimension of Cu(0) wire, compared to the nonactivated Cu(0) wire counterpart. Activation of Cu(0) wire allowed the polymerization in air to proceed with no induction period, linear first-order kinetics, linear correlation between the molecular weight evolution with conversion, and narrow molecular weight distribution. The retention of chain-end functionality of alpha,omega-di(bromo) poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA) prepared by SET-LRP was demonstrated by a combination of experiments including H-1 NMR spectroscopy and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry after thioetherification of alpha,omega-di(bromo) PMA with thiophenol. In SET-LRP of MA in the presence of limited air, bimolecular termination is observed only above 85% conversion. However, for bifunctional initiators, the small amount of bimolecular termination observed at high conversion maintains a perfectly bifunctional polymer. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In contrast to the commercial Ir black, the collective data confirmed the outstanding activity and stability of the fabricated IrxSn1-xO2 (x = 1, 0.67 and 0.52) NPs, which could be ascribed to the amorphous structure, good dispersion, high pore volume, solid-solution state and Ir-rich surface for bi-metal oxides, and relatively large size (10-11 nm), while Ir0.31Sn0.69 exhibited poor electro-catalytic activity because of the separated two phases, a SnO2-rich phase and an IrO2-rich phase. Furthermore, compared with highly active IrO2, the improved durability, precious-metal Ir utilization efficiency and correspondingly reduced Ir loading were realized by the addition of Sn component. When the Ir0.52Sn0.48O2 cell operated at 80 degrees C using Nafions (R) 115 membrane and less than 0.8 mg cm(-2) of the noble-metal Ir loading, the cell voltages we achieved were 1.631 V at 1000 mA cm(-2), and 1.821 V at 2000 mA cm(-2). The IR-free voltage at the studied current density was very close to the onset voltage of oxygen evolution. The only 50 mu V h(-1) of voltage increased for the 500 h durability test at 500 mA cm(-2). In fact, these results are exceptional compared to the performances for OER in SPEWE cells known so far. This work highlights the potential of using highly active and stable IrO2-SnO2 amorphous NPs to enhance the electrolysis efficiency, reduce the noble-metal Ir loading and thus the cost of hydrogen production from the solid polymer electrolyte water electrolysis.									59	6	0	0	1	0	65			1463-9076			WOS:000314365800028	23338525

A TBC consists of an oxide/metal bilayer: the outer oxide layer (top-coat) imparts thermal insulation, while the metallic layer (bond-coat) affords oxidation protection through the formation of a thermally-grown-oxide (TGO) at elevated temperatures. The TGO layer possesses significantly different elastic, thermal expansion, and creep properties than the surrounding top-coat and bond-coat layers. An intrinsic mechanism which controls the long-term stability and mechanical integrity of a TBC is the volumetric change accompanying the oxide formation, and the attendant locally large stresses that can arise due to the geometrically uneven development of the TGO layer. In this paper we focus on modeling the response of the bond-coat material and its oxidation, and present a new continuum-level thermodynamically-consistent, large-deformation, fully three-dimensional theory which couples high-temperature elastic-viscoplastic deformation of the material with diffusion of oxygen, eventually leading to an oxidation reaction in which the reaction-product causes permanent swelling.The theory is chemo-thermo-mechanically coupled and complex, and at this point in time the list of material parameters appearing in the theory are not fully known. Once the material parameters in our theory are calibrated from suitable experiments, and the theory is numerically-implemented and validated, then the numerical simulation capability should provide an important ingredient for analyzing the evolution of the local stress and strain states which are important ingredients for the life-prediction and performance-improvement of TBCs.

J	Hervant, F; Mathieu, J; Culver, DC								Comparative responses to severe hypoxia and subsequent recovery in closely related amphipod populations (Gammarus minus) from cave and surface habitats								HYDROBIOLOGIA				392	2			197	204		10.1023/A:1003511416509				1999	1999	The locomotory and ventilatory activities, oxygen consumption, and the intermediary and energy metabolism modifications of a spring and a cave population of the aquatic amphipod crustacean Gammarus minus were investigated in normoxia, severe hypoxia (P-O2 < 0.03 kPa) and subsequent recovery. The aims of this study were to compare (1) the reactions of both populations to these experimental conditions, (2) these results with those obtained on the hypogean amphipod Niphargus, and (3) the degree of adaptation to hypoxia showed by both populations of G. minus. Despite their different origins, both populations of G. minus presented identical responses in all experimental conditions. The lethal time for 50% of the population was about 6 h, and the oxygen consumption about 44 mu mol O-2/g dw per h in normoxic conditions. The metabolic effects of severe hypoxia and subsequent recovery were significant compared to normoxic conditions, but also similar between both populations for alanine, arginine phosphate, ATP, glycogen and lactate levels. This study (i) underlines the statement that a high resistance to lack of oxygen is not universally found in subterranean organisms, but is more related to oxygen availability and/or to the energetic state of each subterranean ecosystem, and (ii) highlight the diversity of adaptive responses to an environmental constraint expressed by hypogean crustaceans.									33	0	0	0	30	0	33			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000081035300011		
J	Lin, SS; Huang, JL								Microstructure and optical properties of AlOx thin films grown on ZnO-deposited glass								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH				18	8			1943	1949		10.1557/JMR.2003.0270				AUG 2003	2003	AlOx, thin films were grown on ZnO-deposited glass substrates under different conditions using magnetron sputtering. The influence of processing parameters (mainly direct-current power and oxidizing atmosphere) on the structure and optical properties were investigated. The AlOx films for all samples in this study showed the coexistence of amorphous and polycrystalline structures. The kinetics of crystal growth could influence the dominant crystal orientation. Fast-growing planes were not the most thermodynamically stable, but were kinetically controlled under the film growth condition. Oxidizing the sample in O-2 atmosphere made the AlOx film grow in random directions. The excess oxygen was chemisorbed at the interface between AlOx and ZnO. Therefore, the neighboring oxygen-oxygen distance of AlOx and that of ZnO on their closest-packed planes seriously mismatched. At high power, the particles arrived at the substrate with high kinetic energy and high rate, which led to low density due to porous structure. The transmission decreased with an increase of the pores and surface roughness of AlOx film on ZnO-deposited glass. However, the diffusion of oxygen into the grains improved transmission when the sample was oxidized in O-2 atmosphere.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0884-2914	2044-5326		WOS:000184611200032

They consist of the modified perovskite with rhombohedral symmetry (R (3) over barc) and modified ceria with fluorite structure (Fm (3) over barm). The cross-dissolution of La, Sr, Co and Ce cations between the initial La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta(LSC) and CeO2 takes place and results in the modification of the initial phases. This is particularly important for the modified ceria. The lattice parameter of the modified ceria increases due to the dissolution of La and Sr cations with larger ionic radii, thereby changing noticeably the oxygen sublattice in the fluorite structure. Above 300 degrees C LSCCx composites are three-phase due to the reversible change in the symmetry from rhombohedral (R (3) over barc) to cubic (Pm (3) over barm) within the perovskite phase. Red-ox behaviour of the LSCC composites has been explored under air and argon atmospheres in terms of evolution of the chemical composition at the grain's surface and phase interfaces, formation of oxygen vacancies and thermochemistry of this process. Reversible red-ox behaviour was observed in LSCCx with x - 8-37 most probably due to an observed high surface concentration of Co cations, that can be easily involved in the reduction/re-oxidation cycle. The increase in the surface concentration of Ce4+ cations together with the decrease in surface concentration of Co cations seems to result in the differences in the reduction and oxidation behaviour under air in LSCCx with x = 57-76. Formation of oxygen vacancies in LSC, LSCC02 and LSCCx with x = 5-76 in air was not accompanied by any distinct thermal events. This process becomes more endothermic with further increase in oxygen nonstoichiometry (delta) above certain values: delta > 0.08 in LSC, delta > 0.13 in LSCC02, and LSCC with x = 5-76. The LSCCx with x = 5-37 and with x = 57-76 show slightly different reduction behaviour under a(o(2)) = 7.4 x 10(-5). In the composites with a relatively low CeO2 content, the extent of the reduction is proportional to the Co content in a composition, whereas the reduction of the LSCCx with x = 57-76 was more significant than expected. The changes in the enthalpy of oxygen vacancy formation and the kinetics of reduction have been discussed.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0959-9428	1364-5501		WOS:000295278000060

Herein, we report that the synergistic effect and electron redistribution effect in the Pt1Ru1 dimer can simultaneously accelerate the H-2 generation and improve the catalyst's activity. The as-developed Pt1Ru1/NMHCS-A exhibits a quite low overpotential (eta(10)) of 22 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a large mass activity of 3.49 A mg(-1) at 50 mV overpotential, a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 74.14 H-2 s(-1) at 200 mV overpotential, and a slight increment of 3 mV for eta(10) after 10,000 consecutive cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, greatly outperforming the commercial 20 wt % Pt/C benchmark and nanoparticle counterparts. The detailed spectroscopic investigations and theoretical calculations confirm the formation of a C-1-Pt-Ru-N-2 coordination structure in Pt1Ru1/NMHCS-A and reveal the electron redistribution effect of Ru on the Pt atom. With the Ru atom tuning the electron redistribution, the Pt atom acting as the active site shows strong abilities to adsorb and reduce the proton, thus leading to the optimal HER activity. Our work provides constructive guidance for the fabrication of metal(I)-metal(II) dimers and the precise regulation of their electronic structures to achieve excellent catalytic activities.									4	1	0	0	1	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000813310500001

However, HE-NCM cathodes suffer from severe degradation during cycling, causing gradual capacity loss, voltage fading, and low-rate capability performance. In this work, we applied an effective approach to creating a nano-sized surface layer of Li2SO4 on the above material, providing mitigation of the interfacial side reactions while retaining the structural integrity of the cathodes upon extended cycling. The Li2SO4 coating was formed on the surface of the material by mixing it with nanocrystalline Li2SO4 and annealing at 600 degrees C. We established enhanced electrochemical behavior with similar to 20% higher discharge capacity, improved charge-transfer kinetics, and higher rate capability of HE-NCM cathodes due to the presence of the Li2SO4 coating. Online electrochemical mass spectrometry studies revealed lower CO2 and H-2 evolution in the treated samples, implying that the Li2SO4 layer partially suppresses the electrolyte degradation during the initial cycle. In addition, a similar to 28% improvement in the thermal stability of the Li2SO4-treated samples in reactions with battery solution was also shown by DSC studies. The post-cycling analysis allowed us to conclude that the Li2SO4 phase remained on the surface and retained its structure after 100 cycles.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2304-6740		WOS:000775132400001

In this paper, a typical liquefied coal-Naomaohu coal (NMHC)-was liquefied under mild conditions (400 degrees C, initial H-2 pressure of 3 MPa), and a NMHC conversion of 90.6% was obtained with an oil+gas yield of 65.1%. In the DCL process, the solid particles of coal and its residues are not only reactants but also carriers of catalysts of DCL. To study the structural characteristics of these residues, the reaction mixture was extracted with n-hexane and tetrahydrofuran (THF), separately, yielding n-hexane insoluble residues (Re-HEIS) and THF insoluble residues (Re-THFIS). Several patterns of the reaction progresses were identified. First, the particle sizes of Re-HEIS and Re-THFIS have a decreasing trend, and the particle surface becomes loose and porous while raw coal has a relatively flat surface. Second, most of the aliphatic structure and some small aromatic compounds can gradually split off from coal skeleton structure, and the condensation degree of aromatic clusters in residues increases with the aromatic condensation degree of Re-THFIS being higher than that of Re-HEIS. Third, the contents of carbonyl carbon and oxygen-attached carbon decrease while methylene chain and side chain of aromatic clusters are broken. Lastly, the aromatic structure of Re-THFIS becomes regular, and the graphitization degree increases, while the pyrolysis rate slows down. These results of element analysis show that the H/C of Re-HEIS is larger than that of Re-THFIS, which implies that preasphaltene and asphaltene are relatively rich in hydrogen.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0378-3820	1873-7188		WOS:000621191500003

For efficient design of type-II coherent heterostructures, it is essential to calibrate the band gaps, band edge positions, bonding, and lattice misfit strain at the interface. To this end, we apply the first principle study to screen type-II heterostructures by exploring "native" and "non-native" structures of widely used semiconductor materials such as TiO2, ZnO, BiVO4, CdSe, and ZnS. "Non-native" structures differ from the "native" (ground state) structure of bulk crystals in terms of discrete translational symmetry. Due to a change in discrete translational symmetry, atomic, and electronic properties of native and non-native materials are expected to be different. The screening process is based on three criteria: band edges, type-II band alignment between two semiconductors, and identification of coherent interfaces between them. Band edge calculations show that most of the polymorphs are not only suitable for oxygen evolution reaction, but also for the hydrogen evolution reaction. On the basis of band edge positions, several isomaterial and heteromaterial type-II combinations of heterostructures have been explored in which 221 (out of 297) materials have type-II combinations, including many combinations that have not yet been explored experimentally. However, a requirement of the complementary translation symmetry and motif positions to minimize lattice mismatch brings down the possibilities to 19 misfit strained coherent interfaces (e.g., WZ (10 (1) over bar0)-ZnS/ZB (110)-ZnO). This study points to the centrality of constraints of the coherency of the interface in determining the efficiency of electron-hole separation.									7	1	0	0	0	0	8			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000500417600012

Highly crystalline MoP nanocrystals with ultrasmall sizes embedded in an N,P-codoped carbon matrix (MoP@NPCS) were designed and fabricated for hydrogen evolution. Due to the highly active catalytic nature of the MoP nanocrystals, the ultrasmall MoP nanoparticles on the conductive carbon matrix, the high surface area of the carbon matrix with abundant N and P dopants, and the strong coupling effect between the MoP nanoparticles and the carbon matrix, the designed MoP@NPCS catalysts show excellent hydrogen evolution behaviour, with an onset potential of -47 mV and an overpotential of 107 mV, to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, along with robust operational durability. Specially, the fabricated N,P-codoped carbon matrix (NPCS) exhibits high OER catalytic activity with an overpotential of 390 mV to afford 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent stability. Finally, a two-electrode electrolyzer using MoP@NPCS and NPCS as the cathode and anode electrodes, respectively, requires a low voltage of 1.70 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) over long-term operation. Due to this impressive performance, MoP@NPCS is a promising electrocatalyst for practical hydrogen production from electrocatalytic water splitting.									34	4	0	0	1	0	34				2052-1537		WOS:000448416200021

Based on this channel-inserted Na-doping mechanism, herein, an in situ ion migration-based internal electric field (IEF) engineering strategy is developed. Firstly, Na channel-doped WO3 (Na/WO3) was prepared via a hydrothermal method. Driven by an increase in temperature, Na ions directionally migrated through channels towards the surface region of WO3, leading to an uneven charge distribution between the inner and outer side of the WO3 structure, together with the formation of a core-shell m-WO3/h-WO3 phase junction, and then the IEF from h-WO3 (+) to m-WO3 (-) was built. With a further increase in temperature, Na ions formed chemical bonds with O atoms belonging to the WO6 octahedra, forming a series of core/shell heterojunctions with consecutive -O-W-O- at the interface, including m-WO3/T-Na2W4O13 and mWO(3)/T-Na5W14O44, which provide a pathway for the electron transfer. The distinct O 1s oxidation states between the two sides of the atomic junction interface were suggested to be the driving force for the formation of IEF in two heterojunctions. Electrons transfer to one side with a higher O 1s oxidation state along -O-W-O- bands at the interface to build IEF. Transient photocurrent measurement, photoluminescence spectroscopy, steady-state surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SS-SPV) and MottSchottky curves were used to investigate separation efficiencies of Na/WO3-T and the relationship with their relative IEF strength and activities. Results indicate that the synergistic effect of IEF and junctions is the main reason for the efficient carrier separation, finally resulting in improved photocatalytic oxygen evolution.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000612470000033

Because the surfaces of the nanoparticles are typically covered with surfactant molecules, these synthetic nanoparticles are often ineffective catalysts for chemical transformations. Moreover, recent applications of nanoparticles as electrocatalysts require costly processes, such as calcination or potential cycling, when converting the nanoparticles to electrodes. Here, we report a novel electrochemical route in direct synthesis of surfactant-free multimetallic nanoparticles. The synthesis occurs by electrolysis of an aqueous nanodroplet (approximately 50 attoliter in volume) containing metal precursor ions, and the stoichiometry inside the nanodroplet precisely translates to the synthesized nanoparticle. Multimetallic nanoparticles of binary, ternary, and quaternary combinations are prepared employing Cu, Ag, Pd, Pt, and Au as constituents. The synthesized nanoparticles are evaluated as electrocatalysts for alkaline oxygen reduction. Particularly, Cu0.75Pd0.25 and Cu0.375Pd0.25Pt0.375 nanoparticles demonstrate catalytic performance comparable to the benchmark catalyst PVC and boast far superior durability, while consuming at least 200 fold less metal atoms.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000502040600126

The difficulty with performing seawater splitting arises from the complex seawater composition and environment, but from the viewpoint of better utilization of natural resources, it is highly desirable to conduct the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in seawater. Herein, we design and synthesize few-layer heterostructured ReS2 nanosheets with the lateral metallic T and semiconducting Td phase interface, in which cationic vacancies are intentionally introduced as active sites. The ReS2 nanosheets respond to the whole spectrum of visible light and produce hydrogen from seawater efficiently. Theoretical calculation and experiments indicate that the cationic vacancies are favorable to H+ adsorption because H+ has the lowest adsorption energy compared to other cations. The nanosheets deliver stable HER performance for over 12 h in a wide range of salinity. This effective strategy to produce hydrogen from seawater may be extended to other 2D materials to accomplish highly efficient hydrogen evolution from seawater.									69	3	0	0	4	0	71			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000454636200005

The aforementioned report showed a remarkable 48% increase in power density while switching from common GDC interlayer to a new interlayer chemistry (PGCO). Furthermore, a stable long-term performance was linked with suppressed reaction between the cathode and PGCO interlayer. In this article, we report in situ studies of the phase evolution. The high energy XRD studies at a synchrotron source showed fully suppressed phase transition in praseodymium nickelates with PGCO interlayer, while the electrodes on the GDC interlayer undergo substantial phase transformation. Furthermore, in operando and post-test XRD analyses shown fully suppressed structural changes in electrodes operated in full cells at 750 degrees C and 0.80 V for 500 hours. SEM-EDS analysis showed that the formation of PrOx at the cathode-interlayer interface may play a role in a decrease of mechanical integrity of the interfaces, due to thermal expansion mismatch, leading to a local stress between the two phases. Consequently, phase evolution at a narrow interface may propagate toward the electrode bulk, leading to structural changes and performance degradation. (C) The Author(s) 2017. Published by ECS.

Herein, we report the exploration of freestanding bifunctional cathode with rationally designed structures, namely, tiny Co nanoparticles embedded in N-doped carbon nanofiber aerogels, which have desired features including uniform Co dispersity, balanced distribution of N-C species, hierarchically porous structure with increased fraction of meso- to micropores, and moderate amounts of defects. Accordingly, the as-fabricated cathodes exhibit positive half-wave potential of 0.82 V for oxygen reduction and small overpotential of 350 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution, respectively, which deliver smaller reversible oxygen electrode index (0.76 V) than the commercial Pt/C+RuO2 (0.80 V) and most Co-based electrocatalysts ever reported. Impressively, the as-constructed liquid rechargeable ZAB behaves high peak power density (160 mW cm(-2)), large specific capacity (759.7 mAh g(-1) at 10 mA cm(-2), tested after 120 h of OCV tests), and robust stability over 277 h. Moreover, the as-assembled quasi-solid-state ZAB using such freestanding cathode represents excellent mechanical flexibility and outstanding cycle performance, regardless of being serviced under extremely bending conditions from 0 degrees to 180 degrees, underscoring their promising applications as durable bifunctional cathode for portable metal-air batteries.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2575-0356		WOS:000752939800001

Herein, a simple and effective one-step pyrolysis method was developed to successfully prepare a series of molybdenum carbide catalysts dispersed on B and N-codoped carbon materials (Mo2C@BNC-x). Under a calcination temperature of 1000 degrees C, the as-prepared Mo2C@BNC-1000 served as a highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of flavanones into flavones, and the conversion and yield were both 99%. Moreover, several characterizations and density functional theory calculations showed the excellent catalytic performance of Mo2C@BNC-1000 catalyst originated from the synergistic effect between Mo2C and the B/N co-doped carbon support with rich oxygen vacancies. In addition, the Mo2C@BNC-1000 catalyst showed good applicability and reusability, with no significant reduction in catalytic activity at least five runs. The prepared Mo2C@BNC catalyst thus triggers facile synthesis of flavones through oxidative dehydrogenation of flavanone with green economy and high efficiency. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Johan				Zack, Thomas/K-7228-2013	Zack, Thomas/0000-0003-4747-4134; Hogmalm, Johan/0000-0003-3857-3261			Laser ablation Rb/Sr dating by online chemical separation of Rb and Sr in an oxygen-filled reaction cell								CHEMICAL GEOLOGY				437				120	133		10.1016/j.chemgeo.2016.05.027				OCT 25 2016	2016	The Rb-Sr beta-decay dating system is one of the most attractive tools in geochronology, as Rb is sufficiently abundant in common K-bearing minerals like biotite, muscovite and K-feldspar. This allows dating of a wide variety of rocks (e.g., volcanic, magmatic, metamorphic, sedimentary and hydrothermal environments) without the need of preconcentration, as is often required for U-Pb dating of zircon. However, this advantage was to date negatively counteracted by the lack of a suitable in-situ technique, as beta decay systems by nature have isobaric interferences of the daughter isotope by their respective parent isotope. A reaction cell sandwiched between two quadrupoles within an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) allows exactly this, the online chemical separation of two different elements. Coupled to a laser ablation (LA) system, in-situ Rb-Sr dating is therefore possible if a suitable reaction gas within the reaction cell can be found that separates Sr from Rb.We present here a simple procedure in which Rb-Sr ages can be obtained from a suite of individual phases in regular thin sections. Using the most established reaction gas, oxygen (O-2), it is possible to react part of the ablated Sr to SrO+ while no RbO+ is formed. Measurements of feldspars andmicas with a spot size of 80 mu m were calibrated against glass standards NIST SRM 610, BCR-2G and biotite from La Posta (California; 91.6 Ma). Results are presented for a variety of magmatic rocks with well-established thermal records: a sample each from the Klokken syenodiorite (Greenland; 1161 Ma), the Ulvo alkaligabbro (Sweden; 1256 Ma) and a pegmatite from the Bohus granite (Sweden; 920 Ma). Obtained in situ Rb-Sr isochron ages are accurate <1.5%, while initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios are accurate <0.2% compared to published data.The methodology outlined in this study has significant implications for Rb-Sr studies due to the high spatial resolution: (1) quality of measurements can be better controlled by avoiding alterations and inclusions, (2) large sample numbers can be investigated simply by using regular thin sections, (3) several mineral generations can be targeted that would not be distinguishable in mineral separates, and (4) isotope zonation within single crystals can be revealed. This will open the Rb-Sr dating system to new fields of study. For example, thermochronologic studies can use Sr-87/Sr-86 and Rb-87/Sr-86 zonation within crystals to better work out cooling and/or reheating paths. Further applications are in the field of provenance studies and temporal evolution of shear zones. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, it encounters great challenges for practical applications. For instance, to avoid aggregation and precipitation, a continuous stirring process is required for the bare g-C3N4 powder during the photocatalytic reaction. In addition, recycling of the powder photocatalyst is complicated and usually not environment friendly. To overcome these drawbacks, we present a hybrid materials. This material combines g-C3N4 nanosheets loaded with cocatalyst Pt atoms (CN) with a polymer hydrogel. In the ready-to-use photocatalyst, CN is well distributed in the hydrogel matrix. Water stored in the hydrogel can serve as a water reservoir for the photocatalytic water splitting. Due to the intermolecular interactions between CN and the hydrogel, a 3D network with a small-sized nanostructure is formed, which enhances the light absorption and the charge carrier separation. As a result, the H-2 evolution rate is 7437 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), which is 130% higher than that of the bare CN powder in water. Furthermore, the hydrogel-supported CN is able to function under ambient environment conditions without any significant reduction of the photocatalytic performance, as compared to the bare CN powder. In the hybrid material, the combination of hydrogel and CN provides a possibility for the photocatalyst to work without a water environment and accomplish an efficient H-2 evolution.									20	1	0	0	3	0	20			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000593047100007

While annealing in the absence of oxygen there was a notable increase in the concentration of paramagnetic defects as measured by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The presence of these defects increased the metal-free photocatalytic activity of the samples towards hydrogen evolution from photocatalytic methane steam reforming (MSR) under UV illumination. Catalyst activity was stable for over 42 h while illuminated owing to the regeneration of Ti3+ defects by UV photoexcitation, but rapidly decayed in the dark. The high concentration of unique Ti3+ defect sites generated during annealing catalyze hydrogen evolution, avoiding the need for precious metal cocatalysts, while anatase lacking these defects is inactive. This work shows that the implementation of defect-rich anatase TiO2 provides new catalytic pathways for hydrogen generation from photocatalytic methane steam reforming.

The deposition process and the silicon thin films are studied by using optical emission spectroscopy (OES) and Fourier transfer infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, respectively. The results show that when the silane concentration changes from 10% to 1%, the peak frequency of the Si-H stretching mode shifts from 2000 cm(-1) to 2100 cm(-1), while the peak frequency of the Si-H wagging-rocking mode shifts from 650 cm(-1) to 620 cm(-1). At the same time the SiH*/H-alpha intensity ratio in the plasma decreases gradually. The evolution of the infrared spectra and the optical emission spectra demonstrates a morphological phase transition from amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) to microcrystalline silicon (mu c-Si:H). The structural evolution and the mu c-Si: H formation have been analyzed based on the variation of H-alpha and SiH* intensities in the plasma. The role of oxygen impurity during the plasma process and in the silicon films is also discussed in this study.									9	2	0	0	0	0	10			1674-1056	1741-4199		WOS:000293175900068

The composition, morphology and surface roughness of the deposits were studied as a function of the deposition current density (j(DEP)) and compared to that of Ni + RuO2 composites deposited from the chloride electrolyte. For all systems, the volume fraction of the dispersed phases (alpha(IrO2) or alpha(RuO2) ) decreased as j(DEP) increased. At the high j(DEP) values usually employed to deposit porous Ni, alpha IrO2 was very low, irrespective of the deposition bath, whereas alpha(RuO2) remained as high as 0.2. At the same j(DEP) values, the surface roughness of the Ni + RuO2 composites was ca. four times higher than that of the Ni + IrO2 composites, which was comparable to that of porous Ni devoid of dispersed particles. Since composites simultaneously possessing large surface roughness and large concentration of catalytic sites were obtained only when RuO2 was used as dispersed phase. the Ni + RuO2 cathodes had much higher catalytic activity in the hydrogen evolution reaction than Ni + IrO2 cathodes, the latter being only slightly more active than porous Ni cathodes.

The dielectric properties of catalysts are among the relevant parameters facilitating catalytic reactions under electromagnetic radiation. This study describes the dielectric properties of polyoxometalate catalysts in aqueous and organic solutions to understand the mechanism of interactions between polyoxometalates and electromagnetic waves. Specific loss factors of polyoxometalates were observed at lower frequencies (<1 GHz) by the ionic conduction of the polyoxometalate solution. The evolution of ionic conduction depended strongly on cations rather than anions. Proton-type polyoxometalates exhibited significantly higher loss factors than other cations did. The activation energy for ionic conduction in protonated silicotungstic acid (H4SiW12O40) was significantly low in water (7.6-14.1 kJ/mol); therefore, the high loss factor of protonated polyoxometalates in water was attributed to the proton relay mechanism (i.e., Grotthuss mechanism). The results suggested that the proton relay mechanism at the radio-frequency band is critical for generating selective interactions of polyoxometalates with applied electromagnetic fields.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			1996-1944			WOS:000442117300153	30011791

The oxygen electrode is the key component that determines the capacity and cycling performance of this type of battery. In this study, a Co3O4/mesoporous carbon composite (Co3O4/C) with a carbon content of 42 wt%, a rich mesoporous pore content and a homogeneous distribution of Co3O4 nanoparticles over the carbon surface was prepared using a facile silica template method with sucrose as the carbon source, and H3BO3 as an agent for expanding the space between the silica and carbon to impregnate and accommodate the Co3O4 precursor. This composite was used directly as the oxygen electrode in LOBs without additional conductive carbon additives. Galvano charge-discharge tests showed that the capacity of the composite electrode based on the mass of the mesoporous carbon reached approximately 4500 mA h g(carbon)(-1) at a current density of 123 mA g(carbon)(-1). The cell was further successfully run for over 200 discharge-charge cycles at a fixed current density of 246 mA g(carbon)(-1) and a trapped capacity of 740 mA h g(carbon)(-1), which indicated the superior electrochemical performance of the electrode. Different materials have been comparatively tested as oxygen electrodes, including Super P (SP), SP + nano Co3O4, carbon derived from KIT-6 (KIT-6-C), and the as-prepared Co3O4/C, among which the current Co3O4/C composite showed the best performance. The proposed Co3O4/C material has significant potential as an electrode material for rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries.									28	3	0	0	2	0	28			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000358722200041

XRD confirms the formation of single-phase cubic LFO thin films with a rather complex dependence on the nature of the AMC and extent of substitution. Interestingly, subtle trends in lattice constant variations observed in XRD are closely correlated with shifts in the binding energies of 2p(3/2) and O 1s orbitals associated with the perovskite lattice. We establish a scaling factor between these two photoemission peaks, unveiling key correlation between Fe oxidation state and Fe-O covalency. Diffuse reflectance shows that optical transitions are little affected by AMC substitution below 10%, which are dominated by a direct bandgap transition close to 2.72 eV. Differential capacitance data obtained from EIS confirm the p-type characteristic of pristine LFO thin-films, revealing the presence of subbandgap electronic state (A-states) close to the valence band edge. The density of A-states is decreased upon AMC substitution, while the overall capacitance increases (increase in dopant level) and the apparent flat-band potential shifts toward more positive potentials. This behavior is consistent with the change in the valence band photoemission edge. In addition, capacitance data of cation-substituted films show the emergence of deeper states centered around 0.6 eV above the valence band edge (B-states). Photoelectrochemical responses toward the hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions in alkaline solutions show a complex dependence on alkaline-earth metal incorporation, reaching incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency close to 20% in oxygen saturated solutions. We rationalize the photoresponses of the LFO films in terms of the effect sub-bandgap states on majority carrier mobility, charge transfer, and recombination kinetics.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000551488400041	32539332

Nevertheless, the current development of NRR electrocatalysts is far from enough and a systematic research is needed to gain a better improvement. This article presents that 2D C3N4-NV with a large specific surface area and abundant nitrogen vacancies is prepared by a simple and feasible method, and used as a metal-free catalyst for electrocatalytic NRR. Experiment result and density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveal that nitrogen vacancies in 2D C3N4-NV can act as an efficient active site for catalytic NRR, which is conducive to capturing and activating N-2, lowering Gibbs free energy (Delta G) in reaction and inhibiting hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the same time. In addition, the larger specific surface area also makes more active site exposed, which is good for the contact between the electrolyte and the active site, thus enhancing its NRR activity. The electrocatalyst shows an excellent catalytic activity for NRR in 0.1 M HCl, including Faradaic efficiency of 10.96%, NH3 yields of 17.85 mu g h(-1)mg(cat.)(-1), and good stability (over 20 h).

Once constructed, they can be used to estimate and predict the performance of a catalyst from one or more descriptor variables. The relevance and utility of these tools has been demonstrated in several areas of catalysis, with recent applications to homogeneous catalysts having been pioneered by our research group. Both volcano plots and activity maps are built from linear free energy scaling relationships that connect the value of a descriptor variable(s) with the relative energies of other catalytic cycle intermediates/transition states. These relationships must be both constructed and postprocessed appropriately to obtain the resulting plots/maps; this process requires careful execution to obtain meaningful results. In this protocol, we provide a step-by-step guide to building volcano plots and activity maps using curated reaction profile data. The reaction profile data are obtained using density functional theory computations to model the catalytic cycle. In addition, we provide volcanic, a Python code that automates the steps of the process following data acquisition. Unlike the computation of individual reaction energy profiles, our tools lead to a holistic view of homogeneous catalyst performance that can be broadly applied for both explanatory and screening purposes.Volcano plots and activity maps are powerful tools for studying homogeneous catalysis. This protocol describes how to build these from computed DFT data and use them to predict and rationalize the performance of homogeneous catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1754-2189	1750-2799		WOS:000842606200002	35978038

Here, we have developed a template-free hydrothermal synthesis followed by calcination to produce highly active hybrid material of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) supported NiCo2O4 (NiCo2O4/rGO) nano-rods as a non-expensive electro-catalyst for methanol oxidation. The electrochemical performance of the prepared NiCo2O4/rGO spinel catalyst was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry (CA) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. Impressively, the NiCo2O4/rGO showed greater electrocatalytic activity (78 mA/cm(2)) and stability during methanol oxidation in comparison to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst, which was 3.11 folds higher than the commercial Pt/C (25.08 mA/cm(2)). The NiCo2O4/rGO electrode also maintained its remarkable catalytic stability even after consecutive 500 cycles, which was similar to 50 times higher than that of the commercial Pt/C. The overall electroactivity of NiCo2O4/rGO was remarkably enhanced by the synergistic effect between NiCo2O4 and rGO. This may be due to the formation of mixed-valence cations of Ni2+ and Co3+ from the octahedral sites and high electron-transfer conductivity of rGO as well.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000503202600001

The extrinsic proteins and the Mn cluster were removed by TRIS treatment from PSII-enriched membrane fragments and purified by anion exchange chromatography. Room temperature EPR spectra of the purified 23 kDa protein demonstrated the presence of Mn. Photoactivation was successful with low Mn concentrations when the 23 kDa protein was present, while in its absence a higher Mn concentration was needed to reach the same level of oxygen evolution activity. In addition, the rate of photoactivation was significantly accelerated in the presence of the 23 kDa protein. It is proposed that the 23 kDa protein plays an important role in providing Mn during the process of PSII assembly and that it acquires Mn during the light-induced turnover of D1 in the PSII damage-repair cycle and delivers Mn to repaired PSII.

Electrochemical experimental and theoretical results manifest that Ni-Co dual sites synergistically participate in HMF oxidation, where Co sites promote the transformation of the aldehyde (CH=O) group to the carboxyl group with the strong diatomic adsorption (O and C atoms) on the CH=O group of HMF, while Ni sites speed up the reaction rate of 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) generation. Meanwhile, the coordinating S species also contributes to the formation of strong diatomic adsorption with the CH=O group of HMF, and a larger density of state (DOS) of NiCo-S at the Fermi level demonstrates a higher conductivity for carrier transfer compared with NiCo-O. All the above studies confirm the effects of the Ni-Co dual-sites and S coordination on accelerating reactions and lowering energy barriers, thus facilitating the catalytic activity (98.0% selectivity and 97.1% yield for FDCA) with rapid reaction kinetics and low onset potential (12 V vs. RHE).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000792331700001

Perez, Felio/GLN-3393-2022	Perez, Felio/0000-0002-0208-9761			Nanostructured nickel-cobalt oxide and sulfide for applications in supercapacitors and green energy production using waste water								SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY				410						126933	10.1016/j.surfcoat.2021.126933		FEB 2021		MAR 25 2021	2021	With the advancement in technology, the demand for green energy production and storage is increasing year by year. To meet the increasing demand for green energy, there has been continuous research in a bid to find better materials and efficient ways to store energy. Supercapacitors continue to show a promising green energy storage capacity with their modified and improved electrode materials, which show better electrochemical properties. Transition metals such as Fe, Mo, Ni, etc. based materials have shown great potential for electrode materials in supercapacitors, electrocatalysts for water splitting, and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). In this work, nanostructured nickel-cobalt oxide and nickel-cobalt sulfide were synthesized using a facile hydrothermal method for their applications in a supercapacitor, water splitting, and urea oxidation reaction. It was observed that the properties of nickel-cobalt oxide improved significantly after converting it to nickel-cobalt sulfide. The energy storage capacity of nickel-cobalt sulfide was significantly enhanced compared to nickel-cobalt oxide. Additionally, nickel-cobalt sulfide showed an overpotential of 282 mV, while nickel-cobalt oxide displayed an overpotential of 379 mV to generate a current density of 10 mA/cm(2), towards oxygen evolution reaction. After the introduction of 0.33 M urea, the potential for oxidation of urea for both nickel-cobalt oxide and nickel-cobalt sulfide was reduced significantly.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0257-8972	1879-3347		WOS:000655539400010		
J	Zhang, Yangping; Gao, Fei; Song, Pingping; Wang, Jin; Guo, Jun; Shiraish, Yukihide; Du, Yukou					Shiraishi, Yukihide/0000-0003-2579-142X			Glycine-Assisted Fabrication of N-Doped Graphene-Supported Uniform Multipetal PtAg Nanoflowers for Enhanced Ethanol and Ethylene Glycol Oxidation								ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING				7	3			3176	3184		10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b05020				FEB 4 2019	2019	The pursuit of efficient electrocatalysts with better activity, stability, and controllable morphology and size for alcohol oxidation is of decisive significance yet challenging for the application of direct alcohol fuel cells (DAFCs) in large scale. Herein, a series of glycine-assisted N-doped graphene (NG)-supported multipetal PtAg nanoflowers (NFs) has been successfully engineered to serve as high-performance electrocatalysts for ethanol electrooxidation and ethylene glycol electrooxidation catalysis. The introduction of glycine and NG played important roles on the size evolution, where the size decreased by around 7 nm, and well dispersion of PtAg NFs, respectively, which assisted in the formation of PtAg nanoparticles with high surface areas and optimized multipetal structure. The multipetal PtAg NFs exhibit great improvement in electrochemical activity and durability toward the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) and ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR), whose mass activities are 3598.4 and 4587.2 mA mg(-1), respectively. Meanwhile, with the promoting impact of glycine and NG, the as-obtained PtAg NFs can even retain 49.8% and 41.2% of the initial catalytic activity for EOR and EGOR after 500 cycles. This work suggests that PtAg NFs with superior electrochemical activity and stability are one of the optimized choices for high-performance catalysts toward alcohol oxidation.									54	6	0	0	1	0	55			2168-0485			WOS:000458086100036		
J	Kondo, T; Kotachi, S; Tsuji, Y; Watanabe, Y; Mitsudo, T								Novel ruthenium-complex-catalyzed synthesis of ureas from formamides and amines								ORGANOMETALLICS				16	12			2562	2570		10.1021/om970201k				JUN 10 1997	1997	Various N,N'-disubstituted and trisubstituted ureas were obtained in high yields by the ruthenium-complex-catalyzed dehydrogenation of N-substituted formamides and amines under reflux in mesitylene for 12 h under an argon atmosphere. From formamide (1a) and aniline (2a), N,N'-diphenylurea (3a) was obtained in 92% yield. During this reaction, a stoichiometric amount of gaseous hydrogen was spontaneously evolved; thus, the addition of a hydrogen acceptor was not required. Formamide itself, i.e., HCONH2 (4), can also be used as a versatile carbonyl source. From HCONH2 (4) and primary amines, the corresponding N,N'-disubstituted ureas were obtained in high yields together with the evolution of hydrogen and ammonia. To identify a catalytically active species, the stoichiometric reaction of RuCl2(PPh3)(3) with formanilide (1a) was carried out in CH2Cl2 at room temperature to give a novel oxygen-atom-bridged dinuclear ruthenium complex, Ru-2(mu-Cl)(2)Cl-2(mu-PhNH-CHO-O,O)(PPh3)(4) (5), in 87% yield. Complex 5 showed a high catalytic activity for the synthesis of N,N'-diphenylurea from formanilide (1a) and aniline (2a), and the stoichiometric reaction of 5 with aniline gave N,N'-diphenylurea, which strongly suggests that complex 5 is the key intermediate in the RuCl2(PPh3)(3)-catalyzed synthesis of ureas using formamides as a versatile carbonyl source.									30	4	0	0	3	0	33			0276-7333			WOS:A1997XE32800017

Efficient heteroatom doping emerged a large number of joints in Co3S4-WSX, providing multitudinous active sites for hydrogen catalysis. Moreover, due to these unmatched structural and compositional features, the optimized Co3S4-WSX hybrid without introducing any noble metal cocatalysts in the catalytic system also displayed a brilliant performance for hydrogen evolution and prominent stability under long-term visible light irradiation. In particular, the sample of Co3S4-WSX(0.6)), the amount of hydrogen evolution in the five-hour continuous light could reach up to 428.3 mol, which was increased by 38 times compared with Co-ZIF-9. In addition, some necessary characterization such as XRD, FTIR, SEM, TEM, XPS, BET, UV-vis diffuse spectroscopy, photoelectrochemistry and PL etc. were further examed to support related results and put forward the possible reaction mechanism.									29	2	0	0	2	0	29			2398-4902			WOS:000453816900008

The focus is on the anode, where mitigation of the hydrogen evolution reaction and loss in redox kinetics due to cycling is considered as a challenge. The growth of bamboo-like carbon nanostructures is achieved through a catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process with a very small geometric loading of Fe (from FeCl3) as the catalyst. Anhydrous acetonitrile, used as a nitrogen/carbon precursor, is fed to the electrode sample at 900 degrees C for 3 hours in a stream of H-2-Ar (carrier gas). The three-electrode-cell study shows enhanced kinetics and durability of the electrode for V3+/V2+ redox reactions; N-CP shows a significant suppression of the peak potential separation (Delta E similar to 80 mV), indicating faster kinetics compared to conventional CP (Delta E similar to 160 mV). In addition, the subscale cell performance shows good durability (about 5% and 15% loss in energy efficiency in N-CP and CP, respectively) after 50 charge-discharge cycles. The improved durability of the N-CP electrode is attributed to the presence of nitrogen-carbon nanostructures, increased active area, and improved sp(2) carbon content. Such findings can contribute to the development of large scale high performance VRFB systems.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2633-5409		WOS:000613922600046		
J	Kwok, Sun								Planetary Nebulae as Sources of Chemical Enrichment of the Galaxy								FRONTIERS IN ASTRONOMY AND SPACE SCIENCES				9						893061	10.3389/fspas.2022.893061				MAY 10 2022	2022	During the late asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase of stellar evolution, the element carbon is created through the triple-alpha nuclear reaction. This is followed by the synthesis of other heavy elements via neutron capture in the core and the dredge-up of these elements to the surface by convection. Simple molecules and solid-state minerals begin to form in the upper photosphere. These molecules and solids are ejected into the interstellar medium by a strong stellar wind. During the subsequent post-AGB evolution, complex organics with aromatic and aliphatic structures are synthesized in the circumstellar envelope. Planetary nebulae, formed by swept-up circumstellar material, are found to show strong spectral signatures of ions, atoms, molecules, and inorganic and organic solids. These ejected materials of planetary nebulae serve as primordial ingredients of formation of new stars and planetary systems. Stellar synthesized organic solids may survive their journeys through the interstellar medium and evidence for remnants of such organics can be found in our own Solar System. In this paper, we summarize the recent observations of circumstellar synthesis of molecules and solids and discuss the implications of these ejected circumstellar materials on the chemical enrichment of the Galaxy and planetary systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2296-987X			WOS:000799657200001

The reaction flow analysis reduction method was adopted to lump and remove the unimportant species and the related reactions. The reduced mechanism of n-butanol contains 71 species and 349 reactions. The reduced mechanism of n-butanol was merged into a reduced mechanism of biodiesel to construct a combined mechanism of n-butanol/biodiesel with 171 species and 765 reactions. The combined mechanism was validated against the n-butanol experimental data including ignition delays in shock tubes and the mole fractions of species in a jet-stirred reactor. The n-butanol/biodiesel mechanism was further validated against the engine experiments fuelled with the n-butanol/biodiesel dual fuel under multiple operating conditions. The predicted pressure and the heat release rate profiles, as well as CO, HC, NOx, and soot emissions under various conditions agreed well with the experimental data. Analysis of the interaction of n-butanol/biodiesel during the ignition process shows that the biodiesel produces OH radicals at the low in-cylinder temperature, and the produced OH radicals are consumed by n-butanol to produce HO2 radicals after a consecutive reaction. HO2 radicals are then transformed to H2O2, which dissociate to OH radicals at higher in-cylinder temperature. OH radicals in turn facilitate further consumption of n-butanol/biodiesel dual fuel. Analysis of the evolution of oxygen contained in the fuel molecules indicates that the O atom in the n-butanol molecule ends up in CH2O, which is turned into CO and the O atoms in the biodiesel may also give rise to CO2 directly.

In the water splitting process, the reduction of H2O gives H-2, while H2O oxidation produces O-2 with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in tiny amounts as a by-product (poisoning the catalyst). It remains challenging to simultaneously produce H2O2 and H-2 within one photocatalytic system. Inspired by a biological H2O2 generator, chlorella, the authors firstly realize the simultaneous photocatalytic water splitting and biological H2O2 generation by a living Chlorella vulgaris and carbon micro particle (needle coke) comodified g-C3N4 (C-N-g-C3N4) photocatalyst. The C-N-g-C3N4 exhibits the optimal H2O2 (H-2) evolution rate of 0.98 mu mol h(-1) (0.84 mu mol h(-1)), giving an apparent quantum efficiency of 0.86% for H-2 evolution at 420 nm. In this system, the needle coke serves as cocatalyst to work as reduction sites for H-2 evolution, while the living C. vulgaris plays the key role in the production of H2O2 under the protection of g-C3N4.									55	5	0	0	5	0	55			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000452401000018

Knowing how the molecules that are present in the ISM can evolve to more complex ones is an interesting topic in interstellar chemistry. The study of possible reactions between detected species can help to understand the evolution in complexity of the interstellar matter and also allows knowing the formation of new molecules which could be candidates to be detected. We focus our attention on two molecules detected in space, vinyl alcohol (CH2CHOH) and azanone (HNO).Aims. We aim to carry out a theoretical study of the ion-molecule reaction between protonated vinyl alcohol and azanone. The viability of formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) from these reactants is expected to provide some insight into the formation of prebiotic species through gas phase reactions.Methods. The reaction of protonated vinyl alcohol with azanone has been theoretically studied by using ab initio methods. Stationary points on the potential energy surface (PES) were characterized at the second-order Moller-Plesset level in conjunction with the aug-cc- pVTZ (correlation-consistent polarized valence triple-zeta) basis set. In addition, the electronic energies were refined by means of single-point calculations at the CCSD(T) level (coupled cluster single and double excitation model augmented with a non-iterative treatment of triple excitations) with the same basis set.Results. From a thermodynamic point of view, twelve products, composed of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen which could be precursors in the formation of more complex biological molecules, can be obtained from this reaction. Among these, we focus especially on ionized glycine and two of its isomers. The analysis of the PES shows that only formation of cis-and trans-O-protonated imine acetaldehyde, CH2NHCOH+ and, CHNHCHOH+, are viable under interstellar conditions.Conclusions. The reaction of protonated vinyl alcohol with azanone can evolve in the interstellar medium to more complex organic molecules of prebiotic interest. Our results suggest that imine acetaldehyde could be a feasible candidate molecule to be searched for in space.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000406619100149

The metal-support interactions and interatomic synergies, however, are severely limited due to the isolation of active sites in SACs which hinder their applications in some complex reactions. To this end, supported sub-nanometer cluster catalysts (SNCCs, <2 nm) with nearly fully exposed active atoms may outperform the SACs in some specific catalytic reactions. The presence of abundant chemical bonds in the clusters can flexibly regulate the support-cluster interaction and build ensemble effect in the sub-nanometer clusters for different electrocatalysis applications. In this review, recent advances of supported SNCCs in electrocatalysis applications are summarized and discussed for the first time. In particular, the importance of the support-cluster interactions and ensemble effect of the clusters in determining the catalytic performance of SNCCs are highlighted. Lastly, challenges and opportunities in SNCCs electrocatalysis are prospected.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000794213600001

Observable increase in the activity of chemically bonded G-TiO2 catalyst for photochemical H-2 evolution and degradation of Evans blue (EB) after solar light irradiation due to efficient migration photoinduced electrons and electrostatic interaction between G and TiO2 coating. G-TiO2 shows enhanced catalytic activity with the liberation of 3.85 mmol g(-1) of H-2 through water splitting reaction as compared to 0.76 mmol g(-1) of H-2 evolution for standard P25. It becomes completely colorless for a period of 60 min of irradiation with solar light and shows respectable catalytic activity even after recycling it five times. The G-TiO2 composite is a non-toxic, stable, economical material that can be applied in photocatalytic applications.									28	1	0	0	3	0	29			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000491876500021		
J	Lin, Sen; Li, Shutao; Huang, Hongwei; Yu, Han; Zhang, Yihe								Synergetic Piezo-Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution on CdxZn1-xS Solid-Solution 1D Nanorods								SMALL				18	8					2106420	10.1002/smll.202106420		DEC 2021		FEB 2022	2022	Conversion of solar and mechanical vibration energies for catalytic water splitting into H-2 has gained substantial attention recently. However, the sluggish charge separation and inefficient energy utilization in photocatalytic and piezocatalytic processes severely restrict the catalytic activity. In this paper, efficient piezo-photocatalytic H-2 evolution from water splitting is realized via simultaneously converting solar and vibration energy over one-dimensional (1D) nanorod-structured CdxZn1-xS (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1) solid solutions. Under combined visible light and ultrasound irradiation, Cd0.4Zn0.6S 1D nanorods deliver a prominently synergetic piezo-photocatalytic H-2 yield rate of 4.45 mmol g(-1) h(-1), far exceeding that under sole ultrasound or illumination. The consumedly promoted catalytic activity of Cd0.4Zn0.6S is attributed to strengthened charge separation by piezo-potential as disclosed by light-assisted scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (SKPFM), increased strain sensitivity, and desirable optimization between piezoelectricity and visible-light response due to the formation of 1D configuration and solid solution. Metal and metal oxide depositions disclose that reduction and oxidation reactions separately occur at the tips and lateral edges of the Cd0.4Zn0.6S nanorods, in which the spatially separated reactive sites also contribute to super catalytic activity. This work is expected to inspire a new design strategy of coupled catalysis reactions for efficient renewable fuel production.									7	0	0	0	0	0	6			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000732712100001	34936197

Hydroperoxides, characterized by an -OOH group, are ubiquitous in the atmospheric oxidation of volatile organic compounds (similar to 300 K), and in the liquid and gas phase oxidation of fuel components at elevated temperatures (similar to 400-1000K). They are responsible for two-stage fuel ignition in internal combustion engines and they play an important role in the formation and evolution of secondary organic aerosols in the atmosphere. The introduction outlines the importance of hydroperoxide chemistry in combustion reaction processes. In addition to this main topic, the role of hydroperoxides in atmospheric and liquid phase oxidation chemistry is also introduced, for a more general perspective. The second part of this paper briefly reviews the mechanistic insights of hydroperoxide chemistry in combustion systems, including experimental detection of these reactive species before 2010. Since that time significant progress has been made by advanced diagnostic techniques like tunable synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry and infrared cavity ring-down spectroscopy. The third chapter of this work summarizes progress in gas phase oxidation experiments to measure hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydroperoxides, olefinic hydroperoxides, ketohydroperoxides, and more complex hydroperoxides that include as many as five oxygen atoms. The fourth section details recent advances in understanding the combustion chemistry of hydroperoxides, involving the formation of carboxylic acids and diones, as well as the development of oxidation models that include a third O-2 addition reaction mechanism.

Herein, a simple one-step chemical vapor deposition method is developed to effectively introduce oxygen vacancies into In2O3 nanowires with the active {001} facets exposed. Theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of oxygen vacancies produces a new defect level as shallow donor and increases the states of density, thereby enhancing the visible light absorption and promoting the separation and transportation of photogenerated carrier of faceted In2O3 nanowires. The In2O3 nanowires grown at optimal condition yield the maximal photocurrent density of 1 mA/cm(2) at 0.22 V versus Ag/AgCl with unity Faradic efficiency. The results demonstrate that introducing oxygen vacancies into faceted photoelectrodes is feasible for further promoting the photoelectrochemical performance. Moreover, the methodology can be extended to other practical optoelectronic devices such as solar cell and photodetectors. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

J	Markl, Gregor; Marks, Michael A. W.; Frost, B. Ronald								On the Controls of Oxygen Fugacity in the Generation and Crystallization of Peralkaline Melts								JOURNAL OF PETROLOGY				51	9			1831	1847		10.1093/petrology/egq040				SEP 2010	2010	The formation of peralkaline melts is generally recognized to be related to enrichment of the mantle in sodium or potassium during a metasomatic event that predated magma generation. The wide range in mineral assemblages, mineral compositions, and fluid compositions in peralkaline melts are, to a large extent, a function of the sodium/potassium content of these mantle-metasomatizing fluids, which also governs redox conditions. We propose that sodic fluids will reduce the mantle assemblage by depleting ferric iron from garnet to form the aegirine component in pyroxene. In contrast, potassic fluids would oxidize the mantle assemblage by extracting Al2O3 from the garnet to make phlogopite. We suggest that during differentiation of peralkaline melts, once Fe-Ti oxides have been depleted from the assemblage, simple crystallization reactions of common solid phases such as aegirine or arfvedsonite control the oxygen fugacity by equilibria such asNa2O + 2 FeO + 4 SiO2 + 1/2 O-2 = 2 NaFeSi2O6.Hence, the more persodic a melt is, the more aegirine will be crystallized and the more reduced this melt will be. This is because without a mineral donor for ferric iron, the crystal chemical forcing of the coupled crystallization of Na with Fe3+ drives oxidation of the dominant Fe2+ in the melt and thereby reduction of the C-H-S-O-bearing fluid and/or melt phase. This is in convincing agreement with observations from a variety of silica-undersaturated peralkaline complexes such as Ilimaussaq in Greenland, Mt. St. Hilaire in Canada, Lovozero and Khibina in Russia, and Tamazeght in Morocco, and explains the occurrence of magmatic methane in the most sodic of these complexes. In silica-oversaturated peralkaline melts such as comendites and pantellerites, however, this equilibrium appears to be less influential and these melts are accordingly less reduced. In perpotassic melts, in contrast, no K-Fe3+ pyroxene is stable and K can only be incorporated into dominantly Fe2+-bearing phases such as biotite or K-amphibole, if no K-feldspar is stable. Here, redox conditions in the coexisting fluid and/or melt are either unaffected or even driven to more oxidized values by the crystallization reactions, which is in accordance with observations on the ultrapotassic rocks of the Roman Province (Italy) or the kalsilite-bearing Murun complex in Siberia. We conclude that peralkalinity in magmatic rocks is tightly connected to oxygen fugacity, that both the generation and the evolution and crystallization of peralkaline melts are governed by redox equilibria, and that these depend strongly on the Na/K ratio as well as on the (Na + K)/Al ratio of the melt. The specific features of peralkaline rocks, such as the difference between agpaitic and miaskitic rocks, the unusual enrichment of high field strength elements and the occurrence of magmatic hydrocarbons in some of them, can all be explained by the oxygen fugacity-controlling model reactions discussed in this study.									82	4	0	0	0	0	83			0022-3530	1460-2415		WOS:000281346100002		
J	Xiao, R; Ghosh, S; Tanaka, AR; Greenberg, BM; Dumbroff, EB								A rapid spectrophotometric method for measuring photosystem I and photosystem II activities in a single sample								PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY				35	5			411	417						MAY 1997	1997	A spectrophotometric method has been developed for the sequential measurement of photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI) activities in a single sample of thylakoid membranes. The assay is based on the reduction and subsequent oxidation of DCPIP (2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol) by PSII and PSI respectively. Electrons donated from water reduce DCPIP during the PSII reaction, whereas reduced DCPIP acts as the electron donor and methyl viologen as the electron acceptor during the assay of PSI. DCPIP absorbs strongly at 580 nm in oxidized form, but it loses absorbance when it is reduced, thus providing the potential for a spectrophotometric assay of both photosystems. Although PSII activity is commonly monitored spectroscopically using DCPIP, PSI is traditionally assayed polarographically as O-2 consumption. However, PSI activities obtained with the spectrophotometric method we describe, using thylakoid samples equivalent to only 10 mu g of chlorophyll, were significantly higher than measurements obtained with 30-mu g samples using a standard oxygen electrode. Ascorbate was added to the PSI reaction mixture to complete the reduction of DCPIP before PSI measurement. and DCMU was included to block electron transport from PSII to PSI. The highest activities were recorded at pH 8 for PSI and at pH 7 for PSII. Nevertheless, values that approximated or exceeded 80% of the peak activities of both photosystems were obtained at pH 7.5, which allowed sensitive, sequential measurement of PSII and PSI in a single cuvette.									22	0	0	0	16	0	22			0981-9428			WOS:A1997XA38500011

Previous studies have suggested that ROS contributes to resistance to the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) or Vibrio alginolyticus in Litopenaeus vannamei. However, the regulation of ROS metabolism in L. vannamei remains elusive. In the present study, we proved that the overexpression of L vannamei reactive oxygen species modulator 1 (LvROMO1) increases ROS production in Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cells. Real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that LvROMO1 is induced by WSSV or V. alginolyticus infection and beta-glucan or microcystin (MC-LR) injection. Further investigation showed that LvROMO1 responding to MC-LR, thereby inducing hemocytes to undergo apoptosis, and ultimately resulting in hepatopancreatic damage. And LvROMO1 downregulation induced an increase in the cumulative mortality of WSSV-infected shrimp by reducing ROS production and suppressing the expression of antimicrobial peptides genes. The findings of present study suggest that LvROMO1 plays an important role in ROS production in L vannamei and is involved in innate immunity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The construction of the hole-transfer bridge between co-catalysts and BiVO4 photoanode could be an effective way to overcome sluggish hole-transfer kinetics of BiVO4 photoanode. Herein, CxNy/BiVO4 photoanode was prepared by coupling carbon nitride hydrogel (CNH) containing unsaturated N on the BiVO4 photoanode during annealing. CxNy/BiVO4 photoanode exhibited excellent PEC performance and stability. Photoelectrochemical tests proved that the coupling of CxNy accelerated holes transfer and enhanced oxygen evolution kinetics. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and theoretical calculations confirmed the existence of the Bi-N-V bond between BiVO4 photoanode and CxNy, which could serve as the hole-transfer bridge to significantly accelerate separation and transfer of carriers driven by the interfacial electric field. Moreover, it was found that the coupling of CxNy effectively inhibited the dissociation of metal ions through changing their coordination environment, resulting in the excellent stability of CxNy/BiVO4 photoanode. This result provides unique insights into vital roles of the interfacial structure, which might have a significant impact on the construction of PEC devices. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The lower activity of methane oxidation reaction (MOR) is primarily attributed to the dominant oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the higher barrier for CH4 activation on transition metal oxides (TMOs). However, a satisfactory explanation for the origins of such lower activity of MOR on TMOs, along with the enabling strategies to partially oxidize CH4 to CH3OH, have not been developed yet. We report here the activation of CH4 is governed by a previously unrecognized consequence of electrostatic (or Madelung) potential of metal atom in TMOs. The measured binding energies of CH4 on 12 different TMOs scale linearly with the Madelung potentials of the metal in the TMOs. The MOR active TMOs are the ones with higher CH4 binding energy and lower Madelung potential. Out of 12 TMOs studied here, only TiO2, IrO2, PbO2, and PtO2 are active for MOR, where the stable active site is the O on top of the metal in TMOs. The reaction pathway for MOR proceeds primarily through *CHx intermediates at lower potentials and through *CH3OH intermediates at higher potentials. The key MOR intermediate *CH3OH is identified on TiO2 under operando conditions at higher potential using transient open-circuit potential measurement. To minimize the overoxidation of *CH3OH, a bimetallic Cu2O3 on TiO2 catalysts is developed, in which Cu reduces the barrier for the reaction of *CH3 and *OH and facilitates the desorption of *CH3OH. The highest faradaic efficiency of 6% is obtained using Cu-Ti bimetallic TMO.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0027-8424			WOS:000621797000075	33597304

Surface morphology and chemistry of the oxide scale grown were examined using SEM/EDX and XPS. The oxidation kinetics was determined by measuring the weight change using an electronic balance. At the initial stage, up to 500 h of exposure time, the oxidation rate was rapid due to surface reactions governed primarily by oxygen ingress, and then, dropped to a low rate after prolonged oxidation for 1000 h. The diffusion of reactants through the initially formed oxide scale limits the oxidation rate at longer times, thus, the progress of reaction followed the parabolic kinetics. The formed oxide scale was enriched significantly with segregation and subsequent oxidation of Nb, and finely dispersed metallic Cu particles. Within the time frame of oxidation, the oxide scale was mainly composed of mixed oxides such as FeCr2O4 and MnCr2O4 along with the binary oxides of Fe, Cr and Mn. Moreover, the precipitation fraction of Cu-rich particles on the oxide scale increased markedly with increase of exposure times. The chemical heterogeneity of oxide scale suggests that the oxidation occurred in a non-selective manner. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The main disadvantage of silicon as anode material is its reduced cell performance in terms of cycling stability. One promising approach to improve this is embedding silicon nanoparticles in a graphene-like matrix via spray drying. All processes described so far need a time- and energy-intensive two-step-synthesis to obtain the graphene-like rGO structure. Here, we present a reactive spray drying process for synthesis of Si/rGO composites. For proper reactor design, the reaction kinetics are investigated by simultaneous thermal analysis in various atmospheres. We can describe thermal decomposition of GO to rGO as a second-order reaction. STA data also show that additional presence of water in the atmosphere due to the one-step synthesis is negligible at temperatures below 600 degrees C for both the reaction of GO and the additional oxidation of Si. To evaluate the electrochemical performance, the composites are cycled in a half cell setup. Delithiation capacity after cell formation could be raised from 252 mAh g(-1) for GO to 327 mAh g(-1) for rGO. In addition, we are able to synthesize Si-containing composites suitable for the anode of LiB using our process. (C) 2021 The Electrochemical Society ("ECS").

Then using galvanic replacement reaction, one layer of Ag was deposited on the surface of electrode. The electrochemical behavior of the modified carbon paste electrode was studied by electrochemical methods such as cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. This Ag/Cu modified carbon paste electrode shows good activity for electrocatalytic oxidation of ethylene glychol. The parameters which are effective on response of modified electrode to oxidation of ethylene glychol, such as applied potential and duration of potential applying for electrodeposition of Cu, duration of galvanic replacement reaction in AgNO3 solution and the kind of acidic solution for electrodeposition of Cu were optimized. The morphology of modified carbon paste electrodes was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Stability of prepared electrode as an anode for oxidation of ethylene glychol was studied.

In the current study, an interfacial model is first constructed to study the decomposition reaction mechanism of Li2O2 supported on Co3O4 surfaces. The computational results indicate that the O-rich Co3O4 (111)C with a relatively low surface energy in high O-2 concentration has a high catalytic activity in reducing overpotential and O-2 desorption barrier due to the electron transfer from the Li2O2 layer to the underlying surface. Meanwhile, the basic sites of Co3O4 (110)B surface induce Li2O2 decomposition into Li2O and a dangling Co-O bond, which further leads to a high charging voltage in the subsequent cycles. The calculations for transition-metal (TM)-doped Co3O4 (111) indicate that P-type doping of Co3O4 (111) exhibits significant catalysis in decreasing both charging overpotential and O-2 desorption barrier. The ionization potential of doped TM is determined as an important parameter to regulate the catalytic activity of metal oxides.									120	9	0	0	7	0	123			2155-5435			WOS:000347513400011

To examine if the protein transport inside chloroplasts is similar between these organisms, we carried out heterologous protein import experiments with Euglena precursor proteins and spinach chloroplasts, The precursor of a 30-kDa subunit of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC30) from the thylakoid lumen of Euglena chloroplasts contained the N-terminal signal, stroma targeting, and thylakoid transfer domains. Truncated preOEC30s lacking the N-terminal domain were post-translationally imported into spinach chloroplasts, transported into the thylakoid lumen, and processed to a mature protein. These results showed that protein translocations within chloroplasts in Euglena and higher plants are similar and supported the hypothesis that Euglena chloroplasts are derived from the ancestral Chlorophyta.

However, the traditional method obtains the average information based on the whole and cannot study the catalytic activity of a single nanoparticle. It is critical to investigate the catalytic activity of individual nanoparticles using in situ techniques. This review summarizes some of Prof. Xu's recent accomplishments in studying the catalytic behavior of nanoparticles at the single-particle level using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy (SMFM). These achievements include revealing the effect of size, shape, and surface atoms of Pd nanoparticles on catalytic kinetics and dynamics as well as obtaining the activation energy of single Au nanoparticles for catalytic reactions by single-molecule methods. It is the first time to study the kinetics and dynamics of single-atom Pt catalysts. Furthermore, the method was extended to study the Pt deactivation process for hydrogen oxidation reactions as well as the catalytic kinetics of two-electron oxygen reduction reactions of individual Fe3O4 nanoparticles in electrocatalysis. Finally, single-molecule super-resolution techniques were used to observe the evolution of the activity of single Sb doped TiO2 nanorod domains. These studies are of guiding significance for in-depth understanding and realization of rational design of optimal catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000834690400001

The introduction of 2D atomic layers of Ni-Al LDH sheet is of vital importance for the removal of poisonous carbonaceous intermediates on Pt surface in the methanol oxidation process due to its outstanding performance in dissociative absorption of water molecules. Structural characterizations show that the active Pt particles with a size range of 3-5 nm are uniformly dispersed on the LDH 2D platelets and the rGO sheet acts as a conductive supporter for the Pt/LDH composites. An itt-situ reactivation process for recovery of Pt activity is proposed in virtue of different working potential ranges between Ni-Al LDH and Pt in alkaline solution. Under periodic reactivation, the activity of Pt can be fully recovered without renewing the reaction solution. Electrochemical tests show that the as-prepared ternary composite exhibits better activity and durability towards MOR than the commercial Pt/C catalyst. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, carbon corrosion caused by local fuel starvation and during a startup/shutdown (SUSD) procedure is investigated. The present model considers coupled transport of charged and non-charged species, and multiple electrochemical and chemical reactions. In the Simulations, the same set of governing equations is solved for the local fuel starvation case and the SUSD case with appropriate boundary conditions and local properties applied to each case respectively. In the local fuel starvation case, a portion of the gas diffusion layer (GDL) is artificially set to have extremely low gas diffusivity in order to mimic the condition when locally the GDL is flooded by liquid water. For the SUSD case. a portion of the anode channel is filled with air, which simulates the purging/refilling in an SUSD procedure. Several mitigation techniques to reduce carbon corrosion are evaluated and it is found that for the local fuel starvation case, using OER (Oxygen Evolution Reaction)-favorable catalysts and using membranes with low O-2 diffusivity are two effective techniques for carbon corrosion mitigation. For the SUSD case, using OER-favorable catalysts appears to be the only effective mitigation technique. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Roh, Hyogyun; Choi, Hyuntae; Kim, Jin-Soo; Shin, Hyeyoung; Park, Taiho; Yong, Kijung								Low power consumed PV-electrolysis with CoFeP nanowires for hydrazine-assisted hydrogen production								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				606						154951	10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.154951				DEC 30 2022	2022	Water electrolysis is becoming increasingly important in green hydrogen production. However, it consumes large amount of power due to sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Recently, hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) attracted significant attention in replacing OER owing to its low oxidation potential. In this study, CoFeP nanowires (NWs) are presented as a novel effective HzOR electrocatalyst. An array of CoFeP NWs was directly synthesized on a cobalt foam (CF) by cation exchange and subsequent phosphorization. Fe doping on CoP changes rate determine step of hydrazine degradation, required less energy of 0.17 eV, confirmed by DFT calculation. Our CoFeP/CF exhibited high HzOR activity with a low potential of-7 mV for generating a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 29 mV dec(-1), which is superior to noble metal catalysts. The overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) of the combined Pt/CF||CoFeP/CF required remarkably low cell potential of only 63 mV to generate a current density of 10 mA cm-2. Furthermore, the unassisted solar hydrogen production was realized by assembling Pt/CF||CoFeP/CF with a single perovskite solar cell, generating a high current generation of 23 mA cm(-2). This value is about two times higher than that of an unassisted overall water splitting system with a solar to hydrogen efficiency of 13.1%, confirming a great potential of our OHzS system in lowering power consumption of electrolysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000864482100002

Peroxygenases, which can achieve clean C-H activation, are ideal candidates for incorporation into such tandem systems, however a constant supply of low-level hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is required. The use of such enzymes at industrial scale will likely necessitate the in situ generation of the oxidant from cheap and widely available reactants. We show that combing heterogeneous catalysts (AuxPdy/TiO2) to produce H(2)O(2)in situ from H-2 and air, in the presence of an evolved unspecific peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita (PaDa-I variant) yields a highly active cascade process capable of oxidizing alkyl and alkenyl substrates. In addition, the tandem process operates under mild reaction conditions and utilizes water as the only solvent. When alkenes such as styrene are subjected to this tandem oxidation process, divergent reaction pathways are observed due to the competing hydrogenation of the alkene by palladium rich nanoparticles in the presence of H-2. Each pathway presents opportunities for value added products. Product selectivity was highly sensitive to the rate of reduction compared to hydrogen peroxide delivery. Here we show that some control over product selectivity may be exerted by careful selection of nanoparticle composition.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000652243000001

Non-metallic doping is a robust way to enhance the HER activity of MoC in experiments, yet the systematic theoretical study is still lacking. In this work, we investigate the surface doping effect on HER activity of C-terminated gamma-MoC(100) by density functional theory (DFT). The thermodynamical stability and realistic catalytic surface of doped surfaces, including mono- and co-doping by three elements (N, P and S) with various doping ratios, are verified by formation energies and surface Pourbaix diagrams, respectively. According to the hydrogen adsorption ability on different coverage and the calculated exchange current densities (i(0)) of the doped surfaces, the surfaces doping in range of (P% > 60% and N% > 5%), (60% < N% <85% and P% < 25%), and (60% < N% < 85% and S% < 25%), show larger i(0) (i(0) > 4 mA/cm(2)). Especially the N/P co-doping g-MoC(100), their larger i(0) in greater range enables their promising excellent performance in hydrogen evolution in experiments. The improved HER activities of doped MoC(100) are ascribed to suitable hydrogen adsorption abilities tuned by suitable p(z)-band centers and the charge redistribution. Our DFT simulations provide more insight and guidance for improving the HER performance of electrode catalysts using non-metallic doping effects. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The chemical evolution of the ice samples was followed online and in situ via a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer and a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The temporal profiles of the cyclopropenone and propynal isomers suggest (pseudo-) first-order kinetics. The cyclic structure (c-C3H2O) is formed via an addition of triplet carbon monoxide to ground-state acetylene (or vice versa); propynal (HCCCHO) can be synthesized from a carbon monoxide-acetylene complex via a [HCO center dot center dot center dot CCH] radical pair inside the matrix cage. These laboratory studies showed for the first time that both C3H2O isomers can be formed in low-temperature ices via nonequilibrium chemistry initiated by energetic electrons as formed in the track of Galactic cosmic ray particles penetrating interstellar icy grains in cold molecular clouds. Our results can explain the hitherto unresolved gas phase abundances of cyclopropenone in star-forming regions via sublimation of c-C3H2O as formed on icy grains in the cold molecular cloud stage. Implications for the heterogeneous oxygen chemistry of Titan and icy terrestrial planets and satellites suggest that the production of oxygen-bearing molecules such as C3H2O may dominate on aerosol particles compared to pure gas phase chemistry.									35	0	0	0	1	0	35			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000260370500060

The concentration of H2O2 produced in the reaction solution of the cathode cell reached as high as 61 mM, when surface-modified BiVO4 with iron(III) oxide(hydroxide) (FeO(OH)) and Co-II(Ch) were employed as a water oxidation catalyst in the photoanode and as an 02 reduction catalyst in the cathode, respectively. The highest solar energy conversion efficiency was determined to be 6.6% under simulated solar illumination adjusted to 0.05 sun after 1 h of photocatalytic reaction (0.89% under I sun illumination). The conversion of chemical energy into electric energy was conducted using H2O2 produced by photocatalytic reaction by an 11202 fuel cell, where open-circuit potential and maximum power density were recorded as 0.79 V and 2.0 mW cm(-2), respectively.									77	4	0	0	9	0	77			2380-8195			WOS:000390085700005

The oxidation of the starting TAML-Fe3+-OH2 complex by removing three electrons and two protons leads to the formation of a key intermediate, TAML-Fe5+=O, which can undergo nucleophilic attack by either a water molecule or a nitrate ion. Both pathways involve attack on the oxo group and lead to the production of O-2. The water attack is more favoured and has a total barrier of 15.4 kcal/mol. The alternative nitrate attack pathway has a barrier of 19.5 kcal/mol. Nitrate functions as a cocatalyst by first donating an oxygen atom to the oxo group to form O-2 and a nitrite ion, which can then be reoxidized to regenerate a nitrate ion. Three possible competing pathways result in ligand modification, namely, water and nitrate attack on the ligand, as well as ligand amide oxidation. The water attack on the ligand has a low barrier of only 10.9 kcal/mol and leads to the opening of the benzene ring, which explains the observation of fast catalyst degradation. The lack of activity or lower activity of other catalysts with different substituents is also rationalized.									57	3	0	0	9	0	57			1434-1948	1099-0682		WOS:000336741600017

The analysis addresses the impact of the solvent reorganization energy, the proton donor-acceptor mode vibrational frequency, and the distance dependence of the nonadiabatic coupling on the dynamics of the reaction and the magnitude of the rate. The rate for nonadiabatic PCET is expressed in terms of a time-dependent probability flux correlation function. The time dependence of the probability flux correlation function is determined mainly by the solvent reorganization energy and is not significantly influenced by the proton donor-acceptor frequency or the distance dependence of the nonadiabatic coupling. The magnitude of the PCET rate becomes greater as the solvent reorganization energy decreases, the proton donor-acceptor frequency decreases, and the distance dependence of the nonadiabatic coupling increases. The approximations underlying a previously derived analytical PCET rate expression are also investigated. The short-time approximation for the solvent is valid for these types of systems. In addition, solvent damping effects on the proton donor-acceptor motion are not significant on the time scale of the probability flux. The rates calculated from the molecular dynamics simulations agree well with those calculated from the analytical rate expression.									28	0	0	0	7	0	30			1520-6106			WOS:000232318500052	16853391

Low-rank coal, which has a high abundance, is rich in mineral matter and oxygencontaining functional groups (OGs). To promote the development of Fe3+-mediated CAWE of low-rank coal, the roles of mineral matter and OGs in Fe3+-mediated CAWE are investigated in this study. Be sides, to understand the reaction mechanism of coal electrolysis and provide guidance for the effective use of electrolyzed coal, the microstructural, surface structure, and microcrystalline changes of the coal are analyzed via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction, respectively. The results show that minerals and OGs have a positive and negative influence on the Fe3+-mediated CAWE, respectively. The hydrogen yields of demineralized coal and oxidized coal are 33.15% and 68.47% lower than that of raw coal owing to the influence of minerals and OGs, respectively. After electrolysis, the degree of aromatic ring condensation increases whereas coal rank decreases; the content of -OH on the coal surface increases and the composition of organic sulfur on the coal surface is altered; and the crystallite diameter of the coal changes.

The physicochemical structures of the raw coal and dewatered coal samples were determined by N-2 adsorption, Fourier transform infrared, and chemical titration methods. The combustion behavior of coals was investigated by thermogravimetric analyzer, and the results demonstrated that the combustion reactivity of the dewatered coals was enhanced. The apparent activation energies of the coal samples were obtained from nonisothermal single heating rate method, and the results illuminated that the combustion process of these coals could be divided into three stages according to the variations of their apparent activation energies. Those variations were used as the medium to investigate the correlations between combustion reactivity parameters and physicochemical structures. It was found that at stage I of the combustion process, the ignition temperature of the coal was mainly affected by intrinsic chemical reactivity; at stage II, the maximum combustion reaction rate of the coal was affected by intrinsic chemical reactivity and specific area diffusion, and the temperature corresponding to the maximum combustion reaction rate was mainly affected by intrinsic chemical reactivity; and at stage III, the burnout temperature was affected by intrinsic chemical reactivity, and the overall reaction rate was controlled by gas diffusion rate.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000468365400026

Solar water splitting to produce hydrogen is one of the effective ways to solve the energy and environmental problems. Water oxidation (2H(2)O -> 4H(+) + 4e(-) + O-2), as one half of the water-splitting reaction, is the primary reaction of both natural and artificial photosynthesis, thus the development of highly active and robust water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) is extremely important for constructing a sustainable artificial photosynthesis system for solar energy conversion. Molecular catalysts and inorganic nanoparticles, as representatives of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, have their respective advantages and have been widely studied. Moreover, hybrid systems combining the molecular catalysts and inorganic nanoparticles, exhibit unique advantages for water oxidation and bridge the gap between homogeneous catalysis and heterogeneous catalysis. Despite significant efforts made so far, a practically viable catalytic system with sufficient efficiency, stability and low cost is yet to be demonstrated. The present topic mainly focuses on the recent advances on different types of WOCs that are generally screened out by several evaluating approaches, such as chemical water oxidation, electrocatalytic water oxidation and photo(electro)catalytic water oxidation. Furthermore, understanding the water oxidation mechanism, including elucidation of the role of active intermediates during the water oxidation process, is helpful to develop more efficient WOCs.									23	1	0	0	2	0	23			0898-8838	1557-8917	978-0-12-816082-4	WOS:000501573300002

The mixed hydrogen-uplake/-evolution signal that has been described in a previous paper (R. Abdel-Basset, K.P. Bader, J. Photochem. Photobiol. B: Biol. 43 (1998) 146-151) can be converted into a net evolution signal by the addition of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and under these conditions the reaction is stable for at least 30 min. The effect is saturated at the low protonophore concentration of 2 mu M. The participation of photosystem II in the electron supply for proton reduction has been substantiated by detailed analyses of the sensitivity of hydrogen evolution to 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-N-N'-dimethylurea ( DCMU). The inhibitory effect of DCMU, which is only minimal under steady-state anaerobic conditions ( when photolysis of water is inhibited in cyanobacteria), can be revealed and is shown to suppress three quarters of the evolution rate during the transition phase from aerobic to anaerobic conditions. In these early phases of the experiments when the time-dependent hydrogen evolution is suboptimal, electron-donor systems Like methylviologen/dithionite and dichlorophenolindophenol/ascorbate (DCPIP/asc) significantly enhance the hydrogen evolution. Dark evolution of molecular hydrogen is also stimulated under the conditions of DCPIP/asc-dependent electron supply for proton reduction. The concentration dependence of the electron-donor system DCPIP/asc reveals a clear sigmoidal curve. From this and from the specificities of the resulting Lineweaver-Burk plot, it can be concluded that Michaelis-Menten kinetics do not appear to be operational in this case but rather that cooperative interactions must be taken into account. Fitting the data to a log (V/V-max-V) versus logS Hill plot yields values of about three, which might be interpreted in terms of the cooperative binding of three (or four) substrate molecules to, e.g., the iron-sulfur clusters of the heterotetrameric reversible hydrogenase system in Oscillatoria chalybea. Addition of water molecules containing the stable isotope D-2 (D2O) to the cyanobacterial reaction assays in the dark results in the light-induced evolution of D-2; thus deuterons that immediately come into exchange equilibrium with protons and the complex water clusters have been reduced by the analysing light. The resulting photoevolution of molecular deuterium (m/e=4) in this case is by no means smaller than that observed following a 30 min pre-illumination, which excludes the substantial (and inevitable) participation of reduced electron-transport carriers in the proton supply for hydrogenase activity. Protons (and deuterons) from the supramolecular structure of the bulk water clusters appear to be preferentially used in the reaction of cyanobacterial hydrogen evolution.

Herein, we report the effects of different crystal phases of Ru on the electrocatalytic performance of ultrathin Ru@Pt core-shell NSs for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). Importantly, Ru with a novel face-centered-cubic phase was found to have more effect on the electronic structure of Pt than Ru with a conventional hexagonal close-packed phase, thereby leading to improved electrocatalytic activity toward the MOR under acidic and basic conditions.

We propose a catalytic mechanism supported by the density functional theory analysis of reaction intermediates that agrees with available experimental observations and kinetic data. We rule out a five-coordinate Ni(II) species as well as a Ni(III) intermediate which was previously proposed and instead identify a key four-coordinate Ni(II) carbonyl species. We find that the turnover-limiting step is likely the formation of the Ni(II) carboxylic acid species, although if a worse oxidant were used or if the concentration was less, then the oxidation of the Ni(I) species would be the turnover-limiting step. The reported findings should enable the design of better catalysts to favor one of the two competing pathways for CO to CO2 conversion as catalyzed by this particular complex.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0020-7608	1097-461X		WOS:000428413300011

Herein, a porous nanoplate composed of small MoP flakes confined in thin N, P, S-triple-doped carbon (MoP@NPSC) was prepared by the assembly of phosphomolybdic acid (H3PMo12O40 center dot nH(2)O, {PMo12}) and egg white, followed by phosphorization. Given its small size (ca. 1 nm) in favor of deriving small particles and the oxygen-rich surface with strong coordination ability, the {PMo12} cluster was selected to combine with egg white to obtain a lamellar hybrid precursor via a hydrogen bond. Through controllable phosphating, a nanoplate organized by interconnected MoP particles was generated, accompanied by the in situ formation of the N, P, S-doped carbon thin layer and pores from the pyrolysis of egg white. The plentiful pores, thin carbon coating, and multielement doping bring about promoted electrolyte/bubble diffusion, enhanced conductivity and stability, and lowered adsorption energy of hydrogen/hydroxyl, respectively. All of the above merits endow MoP@NPSC with prominent activity with low overpotentials of 50, 76, and 71 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) toward the HER in alkaline, neutral, and acid media, respectively, and nearly no attenuation after 40 h of testing. Especially, compared with commercial Pt/C, MoP@NPSC exhibits similar low onset potential and even better at large current density in 1 M KOH. The electrolyzer equipped with the MoP@NPSC cathode and the NiFe-LDH anode requires only 1.52 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) and can be powered by a solar cell (1.524 V) charged by sunlight.									25	1	0	0	1	0	26			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000589384100028	33089984

Herein, we report a facile method to fabricate Co porphyrin functionalized electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (CoTMPyP/ERGO) thin film by direct assembly of oppositely charged tetrakis(N-methylpyridyl) porphyrinato cobalt (CoTMPyP) and GO nanosheets under mild conditions followed by an electrochemical reduction procedure. STEM analysis confirms that CoTMPyP nanoaggregates are homogeneously distributed over the graphene surface. The electrochemical properties of CoTMPyP/ERGO were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results demonstrate that CoTMPyP/ERGO nanohybrid film can serve as excellent electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution in alkaline solution with high activity and stability. The intimate contact and efficient electron transfer between CoTMPyP and ERGO, as well as the crumpled structure, contribute to the improvement of the electrocatalytic performance.

However, the exact oxide structure and reaction mechanism are not fully understood. Here, we used in situ surface X-ray diffraction experiments to resolve the oxide formation at a Pt(111) model electrode at potentials near the onset of the oxygen evolution reaction. Fast experiments are possible by using X-ray photons with a high kinetic energy in combination with a large 2D detector. By employing very low potential sweep rates we obtain a more ordered oxidized surface compared to literature data from potential step experiments. This demonstrates that the oxidation process is strongly governed by the reaction kinetics. The increased surface order enables us to disentangle two subsequent oxidation process; initially the place-exchange process, followed by the formation of a partially disordered oxide in which still 50% of the surface atoms reside on sites commensurate to the Pt(111) surface. The reduction experiments indicate that the place-exchange process is structurally reversible, whereas the disordered oxide causes the surface roughen-ing observed during potential cycling. Despite the increased surface order, oxide superstructures are not observed. These results provide important insights in the oxidation and degradation process of Pt(111), which are valuable for the design of improved electrocatalysts and they rationalize operating procedures.

J	Alsac, Elif Pinar; Smith, Rodney D. L.								Linking Lattice Strain and Electron Transfer Kinetics in Crystalline Layered Double Hydroxides								ACS CATALYSIS											10.1021/acscatal.2c03645		SEP 2022			2022	The improved electrocatalytic property of disordered metal hydroxides relative to that of crystalline layered double hydroxides remains a poorly understood phenomenon. We use a hydrothermally synthesized series of mixed metal hydroxides to study these composition-dependent structural similarities and electrochemical behavior differences. X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy provide complementary perspectives on the structure of the FexNi1-x(OH)(2) series. These techniques reveal near quantitative incorporation of Fe(III) into the Ni(OH)(2) lattice at low Fe-content but also that Fe(III) is distributed into a contaminating iron oxide phase and a non-traditional coordination environment atop the layered double hydroxide structure as the Fe-content increases. Systematic lattice contraction is observed with increasing Fe-content, similar to structurally disordered analogues, but the electrochemical behavior is markedly different. The characteristic anodic shift of pre-catalytic redox peaks does not occur, and electron transfer kinetics exhibit a much more gradual improvement. Measured Tafel slopes are found to possess a linear relationship with the O-Ni-O bond angles within the lattice across the full composition series. The asymmetric Marcus-Hush theory is used to explain this unexpected result, where Fe(III) ions systematically introduce a lattice strain that alters the reaction coordinate for the nickel oxidation reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000863534000001

EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY					4	SI		742	749		10.1002/ejic.201300249				FEB 2014	2014	Treatment of Ir(OH)(2) with sodium periodate in aqueous solution results in formation of dioxygen following the rate law v = k(obs)[Ir](0.65)[IO4](0.5), with k(obs) = 1.5 x 10(-3) {Ir(OH)(2) = [IrCp*(Me2NHC)(OH)(2)], where Me2NHC = N-dimethylimid-azolin- 2-ylidene and Cp* = cyclopentadienyl}. In situ ESI-MS experiments in combination with DFT calculations show that [Ir-III(IO3)](+) and [Ir-V(=O)(IO3)](+) species are present in the reaction mixture. On the basis of the presence of these species, a mechanistic pathway was calculated illustrating that water is not necessarily the source of the oxygen. A low-lying path-way exists wherein O-2 production proceeds via two consecutive O-atom-transfer reactions from periodate to the catalyst. The resulting iodite ligand is further oxidized to close the catalytic cycle. The rate-determining step in this process is formation of the O-O bond. For this transition a 21.8 kcal/mol barrier was found. This value fits very well with the observed turnover frequency of 0.27 s(-1). Although it is difficult to prove that this is the dominant pathway, these data clearly illustrate that one has to be very careful with interpretation of catalytic results in periodate-driven water oxidation reactions.									37	0	0	0	5	0	37			1434-1948	1099-0682		WOS:000336741600018

Herein, the catalytic effect of NaCl (1 and 3 wt%) in the presence of oxygen functional groups on the improvement of the physicochemical structure of coal-based activated carbons is studied in this work. A large quantity of Na can be retained in 1NaJXO and 3NaJXO with the presence of oxygen functional groups to promote further its catalytic characteristics during pyrolysis, resulting in the disordered transformation of the carbon structure. In addition, the development of micropores is mainly affected by the distribution and movement of Na catalyst, whereas the growth of mesopores is mainly influenced by the evolution of oxygen functional groups. Then, the active sites of 3NaJXO-800 can no longer be consumed preferentially in the presence of Na catalyst during subsequent CO2 activation to facilitate the sustained disordered conversion of the microstructure and the rapid development of the micropores, resulting in the obvious high S-BET value as activation proceeds. And the high S-BET/burn-off ratio value (41.48 m(2).g(-1)/%) of 3NaJXO-800 with a high value of S-BET (1995.35 m(2).g(-1)) at a low burn-off value (48.1%) can be obtained, presenting the high efficiency of pore formation. Finally, the SO2 adsorption efficiency of 3NaJXO-800-48.1 maintains at 100% within 90 min. After 180 min, 3NaJXO-800-48.1 still presents a high adsorptive capacity (140.2 mg/g). It is observed that a large micropore volume in the case of hierarchical pore structure necessarily assures optimal adsorption of SO2.									5	2	0	0	0	0	7			2227-9717			WOS:000475306200022

Three different mass flow recirculation rates in the reactor are compared to assess the impact of interfacial mass transfer on the sodium acetate consumption. The system used was a single-tube membrane attached biofilm reactor, connected to a reservoir with the model waste water. The substrate and oxygen dissolved concentrations in the liquid, were measure at the exit of the reactor. The decreases of substrate and oxygen concentration were measured along batch operation, using different recirculation flow rates. A dynamic,model was employed to predict the observed evolution of substrate and oxygen dissolved in the tank. The model accounts for the counter-diffusion of substrate and oxygen as well as for the bioreaction within the biofilm, and the, external mass transfer. The interfacial mass transport coefficients were estimated specifically for each one of the different flow rates used and they were compared to those calculated from the Blasius' solution to the boundary layer equations. The model successfully predicted concentration measurements for the different sets of experiments, and it was able to predict the concentration profiles and reaction profiles inside the biofilm.									8	0	0	0	2	4	8			1665-2738			WOS:000261800400002

Introduction of n-type Ta3N5 suitable for the reduction reaction and p-type Ag3PO4 suitable for the oxidation reaction pose effect on photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of Ag3PO4/Ta3N5-TiO2. This provides important insights into PEC performance by testing the optical absorption, carrier concentration, band gap, photocurrent density and stability of Ag3PO4/Ta3N5-TiO2. Compared with the bare TiO2, Ag3PO4/Ta3N5- TiO2 with a bandgap of 1.89 eV enhances absorption on the red side of the visible light spectrum. The optimised Ag3PO4/Ta3N5-TiO2 photoelectrode with the uniform morphology exhibits an enhanced photocurrent density of 15.08 mA cm(-2) at 1.88 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), with 8.7 times enhancement compared with bare TiO2 (1.55 mA cm(-)2). Both the PEC performance and stability of the Ag3PO4/Ta3N5-TiO2 photoanode could be enhanced by the decoration of Ag3PO4 nanoparticles and Ta3N5. In addition, the synthesis of Ta3N5 materials by hydrothermal methods under low temperature strategies can be used as a reference to guide the preparation of more efficient photoelectrodes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000859214600001

Initially very active, fresh chlorine-free catalysts deactivate in isothermal conditions of reaction, while fresh chlorine-containing catalysts, initially poorly active, undergo an activation with time on stream. Consequences of dechlorination of chlorine-containing catalysts and of impregnation by various amounts of NH4Cl on both types of catalysts are examined. Chlorine is responsible for the inhibition observed on ex-H2PtCl6 catalysts, which could be attributed, more specifically, to the chloride ions remaining at the platinum-support interface after reduction of platinum. After aging of the catalysts under reaction, sintering of the platinum particles is observed on all samples, regardless of their preparation mode. This phenomenon is linked to the presence of oxygen in excess in the gas phase and can account for the deactivation of chlorine-free catalysts. The water produced during the reaction removes the inhibiting chlorine on all chlorine-containing catalysts. The activity of the largest sintered particles is shown to vary with the nature of the fresh catalyst, the aged ex-H2PtCl6 catalysts giving the best results: the molecular nature of the fresh catalyst would also affect the activity of the stable aged catalyst. Both the initial presence of chloride ions at the metal-support interface and the composition of the reacting mixture are key factors to this positive reconstruction.

Land plants and charophycean green algae oxidize glycolate in the peroxisome using oxygen as a co-factor, whereas chlorophycean green algae use a mitochondrial glycolate dehydrogenase (GDH) with organic co-factors. Previous analyses revealed the existence of a GDH in the mitochondria of Arabidopsis thaliana (AtGDH). In this study, the contribution of AtGDH to photorespiration was characterized. Both RNA abundance and mitochondrial GDH activity were up-regulated under photorespiratory growth conditions. Labelling experiments indicated that glycolate oxidation in mitochondrial extracts is coupled to CO2 release. This effect could be enhanced by adding co-factors for aminotransferases, but is inhibited by the addition of glycine. T-DNA insertion lines for AtGDH show a drastic reduction in mitochondrial GDH activity and CO2 release from glycolate. Furthermore, photorespiration is reduced in these mutant lines compared with the wild type, as revealed by determination of the post-illumination CO2 burst and the glycine/serine ratio under photorespiratory growth conditions. The data show that mitochondrial glycolate oxidation contributes to photorespiration in higher plants. This indicates the conservation of chlorophycean photorespiration in streptophytes; despite the evolution of leaf-type peroxisomes.									34	1	0	0	32	0	37			0022-0957	1460-2431		WOS:000250644400029	17595195

In this work, a novel coordinated polymer was prepared feasibly in polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) aqueous solution using aminotrimethylene phosphonic acid (ATMP, L-1) and 2-methylimidazole (MeMI, L-2) as ligands with the ratio of 2:5, Co2+ and Zn2+ as metal centers. Based on the concept of acid-base neutralization reaction, the proton-transfer induced "deprotonation and protonation" for L-1 and L-2, respectively. Thus, the coordination was dominated by the deprotonated L-1. Owing to also partial of protonated L-2 adsorbed as "counter ions", carbonization of the obtained precursor at 800 degrees C under N-2 atmosphere endows the pyrolysis product with nitrogen-doped carbon supported metal pyrophosphate (M2P2O7@NC). Thus, the resulting M2P2O7@NC exhibits the enhanced and durable ORR and HER performance. For ORR in 0.1 M KOH, an enhanced onset potential (0.925 V vs. RHE), half wave potential (0.793 V vs. RHE) and diffusion limiting current (6.132 mA cm(-2)) can be obtained comparable to those of Pt/C. For HER in 0.5 M H2SO4, it only needs an over potential of 180 mV to realize a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, for the first time, we investigated a simple and smart concept to fabricate dual-function vapor solid phase grown copper oxide nanowires (CuxO NWs) integrated metal-organic frameworks-derived (MOFs) hollow and porous cobalt sulfide (CuxO NWs@CoS2) hybrid nanostructures as an effective binder-free electrode for super capacitors and the OER. When utilized as an electrode material for supercapacitors, the CuxO NWs@CoS2 hybrid electrode displayed an ultrahigh specific capacity of 331.6 mAh/g (volumetric capacity of 2.46 mAh/cm(3)) with an outstanding rate capability of 67% even at a high current density of 50 mA/cm(2); moreover, the electrode possessed a long-term durability of 100.2% after 10,000 cycles. An all-solid-state asymmetric device (CuxO NWs NWs@CoS2//Fe2O3/rGO aerogels) delivered a specific energy density of 49.8 Wh/kg. In addition, the oxygen evolution activity of the CuxO NWs@CoS2 electrode was also investigated and the electrode demonstrated superior catalytic properties compared to other formulations. This investigation emphasizes a novel synthetic approach and its multifunctional applicability in energy storage and generation devices.									42	1	0	0	7	0	42			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000561576500002

Supported single-atoms (SAs) exhibit major advantages, such as high atom utilization, strong interfacial interaction, and well-defined active centers, compared with nanopar-ticles. From a practical point of view, SACs comprising non-noble metals seem to be an attractive alter-native to expensive noble-metal catalytic systems. As the intrinsic activity and the electronic structure of SACs are governed by the support material and coordination environment of the metal species. Two-dimensional (2D) materials could be a promising candidates for supporting SAs owing to their high chem-ical stabilities and layered structures. This review provides an overview of recent developments in 2D materials-supported non-noble metal SACs for electrochemical energy conversion applications.

It was evaluated as the heterogeneous catalyst firstly to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for the oxidative degradation of several typical pharmaceuticals in water. The mechanism study indicated a coaction of electron transfer and oxygen defects in this system. The obtained catalyst can promote electron transfer efficiency of Cu+/Cu2+ cycle and provide abundant oxygen defects for catalytic oxidation, which is responsible for the generation of center dot OH, SO4 center dot (-). and O-1(2) . These active species played crucial roles in efficient degradation of thiamphenicol (TAP), diclofenac sodium (DCF), ibuprofen (IBF) and paracetamol (PR), achieving more than 95% removal within 30 min. The catalyst kept high removal efficiency over pH range from 5.0 to 9.1 and suppressed copper leaching in reaction process. Besides, the catalyst exhibited good performance for TAP degradation and mineralization in raw water matrixes from Taihu Lake Basin, which showed a possible practical application to the remediation of water pollution.									27	0	0	0	17	0	27			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000507465200001

It not only can reduce energy consumption caused by the high overpotential of OER but also simultaneously removes the urea present in polluted water, having a huge potential in industrial applications. Ni- and Fe-based transition metal hydroxides have been shown to be significantly effective in OER and urea oxidation reactions (UORs). Herein, by using FeCoNi layered double hydroxide (FeCoNi-LDH) nanorods as the precursor, we successfully develop the Prussian blue analogue (PBA)/FeCoNi-LDH nanorods grown uniformly on the surface of nickel foam (NF). The obtained electrocatalyst PBA/ FeCoNi-LDH/NF nanorods as the anode could provide a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at the applied potential of 1.383 V in 1.0 M KOH solution with 0.5 M only 1.52 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) to afford the same current density. The high conductivity and 3D porous structure created by the Ni substrate can lead to superior electrocatalytic activity. Nanoarrays are constructed intimately with the base and allow the rapid escape of newly produced gas molecules, and a large number of active sites and rapid charge transfer can be induced by the introduction of sodium nitroprusside.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2574-0970		WOS:000752894100104

HCOOH has been proposed as an important C1 precursor to the formation Of CO2 and H-2 in the water-gas-shift (WGS) reaction, in which ceria is also used as a stable support rich in oxygen. The HCOOH is observed to adsorb by way of a formate intermediate species (HCOO-) through the dissociation of the acidic H over both CeO2 (Cell) and CeOX (Ce4+/Ce3+) surfaces. On the fully oxidized CeO2 surface, this H species reacts with surface O and desorbs as H2O when the temperature is < 300 K. In addition to water, temperature programmed desorption spectra indicate the evolution of CO2 and H-2 between 350 and 400 K followed by CO desorption in two regimes at 450 and 525 K. On reduced ceria, only CO and H-2 were produced between 450 and 600 K. The reaction of HCOOH with ceria therefore leads to both the reduction of the oxide, through the formation of H2O and CO2, and oxidation of the oxide, through decomposition to H-2 and CO, depending on the initial state of the ceria. C K-edge near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure and soft X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicate that formate and -OH were the only surface intermediates.									104	1	0	0	2	0	104			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000257155200033

A novel screening strategy, featuring energy-efficient and rapid solution combustion (SC) synthesis techniques in combination with a throughput catalyst activity testing method, was employed. It was demonstrated that most of these mixed-conductor complex perovskites with ruthenium on the B-site are promising candidates for the development of effective catalysts. A possible reaction pathway on the perovskite (e.g., ARuO(3)) surface is proposed in analogy to the well-established reaction mechanism of methanol oxidation on a Pt surface. Additional experiments by using ethanol and formic acid as fuels were conducted to give further insights on the proposed reaction pathway. Furthermore, composite perovskite-Pt compositions were also synthesized directly by the SC method for the design of multifunctional catalysts, where the optimum amount of noble metal was found to be similar to 10 wt %. These novel catalysts, containing 4 times less platinum, display comparable apparent catalytic activity to standard Pt-Ru alloy. Structure and surface properties of these novel catalysts were also studied by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques. The above findings strongly suggest that the proposed approach for design of multifunctional catalysts is practical and effective.									34	2	1	0	0	0	37			1932-7447			WOS:000247599300079

In contrast, the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) enables the carbon neutral production of syngas at ambient conditions. Among non-precious metal catalysts, metal-nitrogen-carbon electrocatalysts are inexpensive and highly selective towards syngas production. This study examined the selectivity of mono- and bi-metallic (M-N-C, M=Fe, Mo or FeMo) electrocatalysts towards syngas production. The ratio of the CO : H-2 in the syngas was tuned by modifying the ratio of the metallic precursors in the bi-metallic FeMo-N-C catalysts, tailoring the catalysts' selectivity towards the CO2RR or the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The catalyst synthesis temperature(s) were considered as they influence the catalyst morphology and activity. Further, the dependence of the ratio of CO : H-2 in the syngas as a function of the potential was explored for the different bi-metallic catalysts. This work showed that by tailoring both the ratio of Fe : Mo in the bi-metallic catalyst and optimizing the reductive potential, a CO : H-2 ratio between 0.25 to 5 was achievable. This study demonstrated a novel approach in which the ratio of the product syngas composition could be tailored in a single reaction, without the need for further downstream processing to reach a desired composition.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000852059800001		
J	Wu, Xing; Cheng, Yi; Veder, Jean-Pierre; Jiang, San Ping								An Efficient Bio-inspired Oxygen Reduction Reaction Catalyst: MnOx Nanosheets Incorporated Iron Phthalocyanine Functionalized Graphene								ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL MATERIALS				4	3			474	480		10.1002/eem2.12134		NOV 2020		JUL 2021	2021	Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts play a critical role in energy storage and conversion devices and have been attracted enormous interests, and however, it remains challenging to develop highly active cheap catalysts in a simple and green route. Inspired by the heme-copper oxidases (HOCs), in which the ORR active center is originated from the incorporation of Fe-N-4 with copper atom, we here developed a fine manganese oxide nanosheets (MnOx NSs) integrated with iron phthalocyanine (FePc) anchored on highly conductive graphene (MnOx/FePc-G) through a green route only involve ethanol as the reagent. The bio-inspired catalyst MnOx/FePc-G demonstrated high ORR activity with a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.887 V, about 57 mV more positive than that of Pt/C. And the current density (j) at 0.9 V is about 1.9 mA cm(-2), which is three times of Pt/C and FePc-G. More importantly, the bio-inspired systems show superior stability in comparison to commercial Pt/C, showing a potential of 0.863 V to deliver a j of 3 mA cm(-2) after 18 000 s polarization, about 80 mV higher than that of 0.783 V for Pt/C. The high activity is contributed by the integration of the FePc and MnOx NSs that plays the role to assist the cleavage of the O-2 bond. Our approach provides a new evidence to develop highly efficient ORR catalysts through imitate the naturally involved systems through a simple route.									9	1	0	0	0	0	10				2575-0356		WOS:000593294000001

Formation of real nanoalloys was supported by the shifts in the binding energy values of Au and Pt 4f(7/2) peaks in XPS. Using 532 nm laser excitation it was observed that the six samples exhibit similar photocatalytic activity for hydrogen generation in the presence of methanol as a sacrificial electron donor. In contrast, in pure water remarkable differences in efficiency for hydrogen generation between the sample containing exclusively Au that was the most active and the others containing Pt were observed. In addition, oxygen evolution was also observed in the absence of methanol under visible light irradiation. Our results illustrate the potential that nanoalloys offer to optimize the photocatalytic activity of TiO2.									24	2	0	0	2	0	26			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000322780200013

The photoelectrocatalytic activity of the hematite electrodes modified with Ti4+ and Zn2+ was optimized through the controlled variation of the dopant ion concentration in the electrodeposition solution. Under optimized conditions, for standard illumination of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm(-2)), the photocurrent density at the Ti/Zn-modified hematite anode reached 1.5 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs RHE that was 2.5-times higher than that observed with the pristine hematite electrode, the photoelectrocatalysis onset potential being 63 mV reduced. Effects of Ti and Zn doping on the photoelectrochemical activity of pristine hematite were studied by scanning electron microscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. On the basis of the obtained results, the improved performance of the Ti/Zn-modified hematite stemmed from the combination of the enhanced electrical conductivity along with the facilitated charge transport in the bulk phase and at the surface of hematite. The effect of Zn-doping decreasing the overpotential of the reaction by 218 mV (solely Zn-doped compared to that of the pristine hematite) was correlated with the Zn contribution to the interfacial catalysis of water oxidation.									159	4	0	0	9	0	160			2155-5435			WOS:000337074700041		
J	Rosenberg, C; Christian, J; Bricker, TM; Putnam-Evans, C								Site-directed mutagenesis of glutamate residues in the large extrinsic loop of the photosystem II protein CP 43 affects oxygen-evolving activity and PSII assembly								BIOCHEMISTRY				38	48			15994	16000		10.1021/bi991326r				NOV 30 1999	1999	The psbC gene encodes the intrinsic chlorophyll protein CP 43, a component of photosystem II in higher plants, green algae, and cyanobacteria. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce mutations into the portion of psbC that encodes the large extrinsic loop E of CP 43 in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803. Three mutations, E293Q, E339Q, and E352Q, each produced a strain with impaired photosystem II activity. The E293Q mutant strain grew photoautotrophically at rates comparable to the control strain. Immunological analyses of several PS II components indicated that this mutant accumulated normal quantities of PS II proteins. However, this mutant evolved oxygen to only 56% of control rates at saturating light intensities. Measurements of total variable fluorescence yield indicated that this mutant assembled approximately 60% of the fully functional PS II centers found in the control strain. The E339Q mutant grew photoautotrophically at a severely reduced rate. Both immunological analysis and variable fluorescence yield experiments indicated that E339Q assembled a normal complement of PS IT centers. However, this mutant was capable of evolving oxygen to only 20% of control rates. Variable fluorescence yield experiments demonstrated that this mutant was inefficient at using water as an electron donor. Both E293Q and E339Q strains exhibited an increased (approximately 2-fold) sensitivity to photoinactivation. The E352Q mutant was the most severely affected. This mutant failed to grow photoautotrophically and exhibited essentially no capacity for oxygen evolution. Measurements of total variable fluorescence yield indicated that this mutant assembled no functional PS II centers. Immunological analysis of isolated thylakoid membranes from E352Q revealed a complete absence of CP 43 and reduced levels of both the D1 and manganese-stabilizing proteins. These results suggest that the mutations E293Q and E339Q each produce a defect associated with the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II. The E352Q mutation appears to affect the stability of the PS II complex. This is the first report showing that alteration of negatively charged residues in the CP 43 large extrinsic loop results in mutations affecting PS II assembly/function.									33	0	0	0	29	0	33			0006-2960			WOS:000084115400034	10625467

It has been proposed that this transition in Striga spp. is controlled simply by an exuded oxidase that converts host cell-surface phenols into benzoquinones which act as developmental signals that mediate the transition. An understanding of this mechanism may identify the critical molecular events that made possible the evolution of parasitism in plants.Results: PoxA and PoxB are identified as the only apoplastic phenol oxidases in Striga asiatica seedlings, and the genes encoding them have been cloned and sequenced. These peroxidase enzymes are capable of oxidizing the 60 known inducing phenols into a small set of benzoquinones, and it is these quinones that induce parasitic development. Analysis of the reaction requirements and comparisons to host enzymes, however, lead us to argue that PoxA and PoxB are not necessary for host recognition.Conclusions: A new model is proposed where constitutive production of an activated oxygen species (in the case of Striga, H2O2) mediates host recognition. This strategy would allow a parasite to exploit abundant host enzymes to produce the diffusible recognition signals by converting a standard host defense into a parasitic offense.									56	7	0	0	50	1	64			1074-5521	1879-1301		WOS:000072376100007	9495831

After the oxidation and molecular recomposition processes that occur within the BC precursors during pyrolysis, sub-2 nm Ru nanoparticles (NPs) and atomic Ru species confined within surface-oxidized N-doped carbon nanofibers (CNFs) can be observed in the derived catalysts. The surface oxidation of CNFs leads the derived catalysts with super hydrophilicity and water-absorbing capacity, and also provides dimensional confinement for the nanoscaled and atomic Ru species. With these added structural advantages and the component synergy, the derived catalysts show superior HER activities, for which the overpotentials are as low as 19.6 mV (1 m KOH) and 55.0 mV (0.5 m H2SO4) for the most active case at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, superior HER activity can be also achieved for the catalysts derived with a wide range of Ru loadings. Finally, the influence of Ru NP size on HER activity is investigated by density functional theory simulations. This method provides a reliable protocol for preparing highly active HER catalysts for scale-up applications.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000682423600001	34363306

Result from X-ray diffraction demonstrated a perovskite La0.6Ca0.4CoO3 lattice, indicating the incorporation of Ru3+ at the Co3+ sites. Image from the scanning electron microscope revealed a foamlike microstructure with various pores at 0.5-3 mu m. La0.6Ca0.4Co0.8Ru0.2O3 exhibited a higher H2O2 decomposition rate in KOH solution as opposed to that of ACP-derived La0.6Ca0.4CoO3, which suggested an improved catalytic ability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). A similar behavior was observed during the ORR current-potential polarization using La0.6Ca0.4Co0.8Ru0.2O3 supported on Black Pearl 2000 as a gas diffusion electrode. In addition, impedance spectra at the open-circuit voltage and selective cathodic overpotentials also confirmed a smaller charge-transfer resistance for La0.6Ca0.4Co0.8Ru0.2O3. In galvanostatic measurements and lifetime evaluation, La0.6Ca0.4Co0.8Ru0.2O3 demonstrated steady voltage profiles with negligible degradation. (C) 2010 The Electrochemical Society.

Herein, the roles of calcium oxide on the release of these compounds, especially the heavy ones containing nitrogen and oxygen atoms were investigated. The results showed that calcium oxide significantly decreased light substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the volatiles from 450 to 850 degrees C and showed obvious inhibitory effects on the formation of heavy substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at 850 degrees C. To understand the impact mechanisms, pyrolysis experiments of sludge model compounds lipid, protein and polysaccharides were conducted. It was found that calcium oxide could catalyze or react with all three components to decrease the content of light substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Heavy oxygencontaining aromatics in sludge derived volatiles mainly resulted from polysaccharides and protein, and they considerably decreased after mixing with calcium oxide. Oxygen-containing aromatics content in the lipid derived volatiles, however, would increase due to polymerization reactions. The decreasing release of nitrogen substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from sludge could be attributed to the synergy effects of CaO and other minerals or the effects of CaO on the interaction between protein and other organics.									6	0	0	0	3	0	6			0959-6526	1879-1786		WOS:000722897600003

Hydrogen is the simplest fuel to produce and while platinum and other noble metals are efficient catalysts for photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution, earth-abundant alternatives are needed for large-scale use. We show that bio-inspired molecular clusters based on molybdenum sulfides and tungsten sulfides mimic nature's enzymes for hydrogen evolution, molybdenum sulfides evolve hydrogen at a slightly higher overpotential than platinum when deposited on various supports. It will be demonstrated how this overpotential can be eliminated by depositing the same type of hydrogen evolution catalyst on p-type Si which can harvest the red part of the solar spectrum. Such a system could constitute the cathode part of a tandem dream device where the red part of the spectrum is utilized for hydrogen evolution while the blue part is reserved for the more difficult oxygen evolution. The samples have been illuminated with a simulated red part of the solar spectrum i.e. long wavelength (lambda > 620 nm) part of simulated AM 1.5G radiation. The current densities at the reversible potential match the requirement of a photoelectrochemical hydrogen production system with a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency in excess of 10%. The experimental observations are supported by DFT calculations of the Mo3S4 cluster adsorbed on the hydrogen-terminated silicon surface providing insights into the nature of the active site.

In order to reveal the microscopic physical process of glow corona in air, a plasma chemical model of glow corona discharge in 1D coaxial wire was established based on COMSOL, considering 28 species and 127 chemical reactions (CKS, a comprehensive kinetic scheme), and the photoionization process. The temporal and spatial distribution and evolution of the major species during the glow corona discharge were obtained. The results show that the major positive ions in the gap are O2+, which are distributed in a shell shape. Negative ions are O- ,O2- and O3-, which mainly exist in the ionization layer. O- and O2- participate in the detachment and provide seed electrons for the next pulse. The classical fluid model (FPM, a fully coupled physical model) fails to fully consider the detachment process of negative ions, resulting in the steepness and peak-to-peak value of current waves are too large. In order to accurately predict the current oscillation waveforms, in addition to O2-, it is also necessary to consider O- in detachment process.					2021 IEEE Electrical Insulation Conference (EIC)2021 IEEE Electrical Insulation Conference (EIC)	7-28 June 20217-28 June 2021	IEEEIEEE	Denver, CO, USADenver, CO, USA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-6654-4686-0	INSPEC:21442366

In this work, a one-pot hydrothermal method has been developed for the direct synthesis of the Rh nanosheets (Rh-NSs) on reduced graphene oxide (RGO). The newly prepared Rh-NSs/RGO hybrids have great electrocatalytic activity for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in alkaline media, much better than single-component Rh nanoparticles (Rh-NPs) and Rh nanoparticles/RGO (Rh-NPs/RGO) hybrids, originating from the two-dimensional structure of Rh nano sheets and excellent physical/chemical property of the RGO. Very importantly, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements show the onset oxidation potential of the MOR at the Rh-NSs/RGO hybrids negatively shift ca. 120 mV compared to the commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst. Meanwhile, CV measurements show that the MOR current at the Rh-NSs/RGO hybrids is 3.6 times bigger than that at the commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst at 0.61 V potential. Additionally, chronoamperometry measurement shows the Rh-NSs/RGO hybrids have excellent stability for the MOR. These electrochemical data demonstrate that the Rh-NSs/RGO hybrids are a highly promising Pt-alternative anode electrocatalyst for the MOR in alkaline media.									65	5	0	0	3	0	66			2168-0485			WOS:000414825900070

In this paper, we report that CoP nanosheet arrays on carbon cloth (CoP NA/CC), derived from alpha-Co(OH)(2) NA/CC, behaves as a three-dimensional bifunctional water-splitting catalyst electrode with high activity and durability in neutral and alkaline media. Such CoP NA/CC demands overpotentials of 145 and 52 mV to afford 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER in 1.0 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and 1.0 M KOH, respectively, with much superior activity to alpha-Co(OH)(2) NA/CC. It can be attributed to the more thermo-neutral hydrogen adsorption free energy for CoP than alpha-Co(OH)(2), according to density functional theory calculations. This electrode also demonstrates superior OER activity over alpha-Co(OH)(2) NA/CC and needs overpotentials of only 536 and 300 mV to drive 10 mAcm(-2) at neutral and alkaline pH, respectively. The two-electrode water electrolyzer using CoP NA/CC as both the cathode and anode shows a 2 mAcm(-2) water-splitting current at a cell voltage of 1.60 V in 1.0 M PBS and needs 1.65 V for 10 mAcm(-2) under alkaline condition with excellent stability.									330	15	0	0	8	0	331			2196-0216			WOS:000410498700006

The chemical evolution calculation employs a simple dynamical model for the Galaxy (infall with a 4 Gyr e-folding timescale onto an exponential disk and 1/r(2) bulge), and standard evolution parameters, such as a Salpeter initial mass function and a quadratic Schmidt star formation rate. The theoretical results are compared in detail with observed stellar abundances in stars with metallicities in the range -3.0 less than or equal to [Fe/K] less than or equal to 0.0 dex. While our discussion focuses on the solar neighborhood where there are the most observations, the supernova rates, an intrinsically Galactic quantity, are also discussed.Sampling 4.6 Gyr ago at a distance of 8.5 kpc, we find a composition at the solar circle that is in excellent agreement with the solar abundances from hydrogen to zinc. Type Ia supernovae provide about one-third of solar iron abundance in this distribution. Oxygen comes from the massive stars, but carbon and nitrogen come chiefly from stars with M less than or equal to 8 M.. The light metal and iron group elements, with the exception of titanium, are in generally good agreement with the stellar abundance data. We also find an age-metallicity relation, a G dwarf distribution, and present-day supernova rates that are in satisfactory agreement with observations. The neutrino process provides a good explanation for the origin of B-11 and F-19 and the increase in Li-7 over its canonical homogeneous big bang value. In order to explain the observed helium-to-metal enrichment (Delta Y/Delta Z similar or equal to 4), we find a favored cutoff in the mass of supernovae that eject all material external to the iron core of about 30 M., but this limit may be increased by considering the effects of mass loss. The robustness of the results to variations in the iron yields of the Type II supernova models are examined.									869	11	1	0	5	0	874			0067-0049			WOS:A1995QZ75800005

Based on scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, the nano-coated SnO2-Sb electrode had very small (23 nm) catalyst grains that had a stacked sphere appearance, and thus a much greater specific surface area than the control electrode (SnO2-Sb prepared by a dip-coating method, 106 nm grain size). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis showed that the nano-coated electrode possessed a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies, which provided many more active centers for the formation of adsorbed Oxygen (Oads), which increased the production of center dot OH radicals and therefore the catalytic activity of organic pollutant degradation. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) showed that the electrode with a nano-structure coating had a higher oxygen evolution potential (2.1 V, vs. Ag/AgCl) and smaller charge transfer resistance (49 Omega) than the control (1.95 V and 93 Omega). A kinetic analysis of the electrochemical degradation of phenol showed that the first-order kinetic rate constant for the nano-coated electrode was 1.72 times higher than the control. Accelerated service life testing showed that the stability of this novel fabricated electrode was 15 h, which was nearly 11 times longer than that of non-nano SnO2-Sb electrode.

However, an effective conversion technology from distributed energy resources, such as solar energy and thermal energy, to hydrogen energy is still a challenging research. Here, earth-abundant and multifunctional Ni nanosheets array as electrocatalysts and light absorption layer integrated thermoelectric (TE) device for overall water splitting was proposed. Instead of the traditional power source, the output voltage from thermoelectric (TE) device was directly used for water splitting. More importantly, the structural, photothermal transformation and electrocatalytic characterizations confirmed that the earth-abundant and multifunctional Ni nanosheets array grown on the hot side of TE device was not only as an efficient photothermal conversion layer for providing temperature difference (Delta T) of TE, but also as an active electrocatalysts for HER. The Electrolyzer-TE hybrid devices were designed for overall water splitting in a two-electrode configuration, which possessed high hydrogen production rate of 1.818 mmol/h and oxygen production rate of 0.912 mmol/h. The proposed integrative TE device herein offered great advantages in terms of designing the overall water splitting system, which are helpful for its practical applications for utilization of solar thermal and waste heat.									39	2	0	0	4	0	40			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000455264600060

In the simplest possible model, a supernova of quite low mass (similar to 15 M-.) underwent a " normal" explosion and ejected similar to0.06 M-.. of while Ni-56 a second one was massive enough (similar to35 M-.) to experience a strong fallback that locked in a compact remnant all the carbon-oxygen core. In a more general scenario, the pristine gas clouds were polluted by one or more supernovae of relatively low mass (less than similar to25 M-.). The successive explosion of a quite massive star experiencing an extended fallback would have largely raised the abundances of the light elements in its close neighborhood.									74	0	0	0	0	0	74			0004-637X			WOS:000185257700015

A zirconium O-2 analyser, combined with a flexible gas system, was used for these measurements. Oxygen yield from saturating single turnover flashes was the equivalent of 1.3-2.0 mu mol e(-) m(-2) in leaves pre-adapted to low light. It did not decrease when q(E) quenching was induced by a 1 min exposure to saturating light, but it decreased when pre-illumination was extended to 30.60 min. Oxygen evolution from saturating multiple turnover pulses behaved similarly: it did not decrease with the rapidly induced q(E) but decreased considerably when exposure to saturating light was extended or O-2 concentration was decreased to 0.4%. Parallel recording of chlorophyll fluorescence and O-2 evolution during multiple turnover pulses, interpreted with the help of a mathematical model of photosystem II (PS II) electron transport, revealed PS II donor and acceptor side resistances. These experiments showed that PS II properties depend on the type of non-photochemical quenching present. The rapidly induced and rapidly reversible q(E) type (photoprotective) quenching does not induce changes in the number of active PS II or in the PS II maximum turnover rate, thus confirming the antenna mechanism of q(E). The more slowly induced but still reversible q(I) type quenching (photoinactivation) induced a decrease in the number of active PS II and in the maximum PS II turnover rate. Modelling showed that, mainly, the acceptor side resistance of PS II increased in parallel with the reversible q(I).

The optimal ratio of FeCl3/EDA was found to be close to 1/3 under the consideration of the electrocatalytic performance, such as better oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and higher power density. Two-stage calcination, one at 900 degrees C in N-2 and the other at 800 degrees C in mixed gases of N-2 and NH3, result in an FeNxC catalyst (FeNC-900-800-A) with pretty high specific surface area of 1098 m(2)g(-1) covered with both micro- and mesopores. The ORR active sites focused mainly on Fe-Nx bonding made of various pyridinic, pyrrolic, and graphitic N-s after calcination. The max. power density reaches 140 mWcm(-2) for FeNC-900-800-A, which is superior to other FeNxC catalysts, experiencing only one-stage calcination in N-2. The FeNxC demonstrates only 10 mV half-wave-voltage (HWV) loss at 1600 rpm after 1000 redox cycles, as compared to be 27 mV for commercial Pt/C catalyst in the durability test.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9				2073-4360		WOS:000484552900138	31430934

In this work, real-time hydrogen evolution measurement was coupled with potentiodynamic measurements on high-purity aluminium and AA2024-T3 aluminium alloy. The results show that both materials exhibit superfluous hydrogen evolution during anodic polarisation and that the presence of cathodically active alloying elements enhances hydrogen evolution. Furthermore, it was observed for the first time that superfluous hydrogen evolution also occurs during cathodic polarisation. Both the anodic and cathodic behaviours can be rationalised by a model assuming that superfluous hydrogen evolution occurs locally where the naturally formed oxide is disrupted. Specifically, during anodic polarisation, oxide disruption is due to the combined presence of chloride ions and acidification, whereas during cathodic polarisation, such disruption is due to alkalinisation. Furthermore, the presence of cathodically active alloying elements enhances superfluous hydrogen evolution in response to either anodic or cathodic polarisation, and results in 'cathodic activation' of the dissolved regions. Corrosion of aluminium: the contribution of hydrogen evolutionAqueous corrosion is an electrochemical reaction resulting in materials degradation, involving simultaneous oxidation of metal and reduction of species in a wet environment. The overall corrosion rate depends on how fast the two processes proceed. Although the reduction of oxygen is the most important cathodic reaction, for more reactive materials such as Al and Mg the reduction of hydrogen is thermodynamically allowed and could contribute to the overall rate. Now a team led by Michele Curioni at University of Manchester look at the hydrogen evolution behaviour of high purity aluminium and AA2024T3 alloy utilising coupled real-time hydrogen evolution and potentiodynamic measurements. Superfluous hydrogen evolution was observed during both anodic and cathodic polarisation and associated in both cases to local oxide disruption. The derived understanding of corrosion could enable us to develop new protection treatments.									33	0	0	0	0	0	33				2397-2106		WOS:000558379600001

Although possibly applicable for pitfall and flypaper trappers, more variables may be required for active trapping systems. Bladderwort (Utricularia) suction traps react to prey stimuli with an extremely rapid release of elastic instability. Trap setting requires considerable energy to engage an active ion transport process whereby water is pumped out through the thin bladder walls to create negative internal pressure. Accordingly, empirical estimates have shown that respiratory rates in bladders are far greater than in leafy structures. Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is a multi-subunit enzyme that catalyzes the respiratory reduction of oxygen to water and couples this reaction to translocation of protons, generating a transmembrane electrochemical gradient that is used for the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATIP). We have previously demonstrated that two contiguous cysteine residues in helix 3 of COX subunit I (COX 1) have evolved under positive Darwinian selection. This motif, absent in approximate to 99.9% of databased COX I proteins from eukaryotes, Archaea, and Bacteria, lies directly at the docking point of COX I helix 3 and cytochrome c. Modeling of bovine COX I suggests the possibility that a vicinal disulfide bridge at this position could cause premature helix termination. The helix 3-4 loop makes crucial contacts with the active site of COX, and we postulate that the C-C motif might cause a conformational change that decouples (or partly decouples) electron transport from proton pumping. Such decoupling would permit bladderworts to optimize power output (which equals energy times rate) during times of need, albeit with a 20% reduction in overall energy efficiency of the respiratory chain. A new model for the evolution of bladderwort carnivory is proposed that includes respiration as an additional tradeoff parameter.									44	0	0	0	39	0	45			1435-8603	1438-8677		WOS:000243167100004	17203431

We investigated effects of Co-60 gamma radiation, which generates oxidative stress, on thylakoid structure and function in cyanobacteria. Cells of unicellular, non-nitrogen fixing cyanobacterium Anacystis nidulans (Synechococcus sp.) showed D-10 value of 257 Gy of Co-60 gamma radiation. When measured immediately after exposure, cells irradiated with 1500 Gy (lethal dose) of Co-60 gamma radiation did not show any differences in photosynthetic functions such as Co-2 fixation, O-2 evolution and partial reactions of photosynthetic electron transport in comparison to unirradiated cells. Incubation of irradiated cells for 24 h in light or dark resulted in decline in photosynthesis. The decline in photosynthesis was higher in the cells incubated in light as compared to the cells incubated in dark. Among the partial reactions of electron transport, only PSII activity declined drastically after incubation of irradiated samples. This was also supported by the analysis of membrane functions using thermoluminescence. Exposure of cyanobacteria to high doses of Co-60 gamma radiation did not affect the thylakoid membrane ultrastructure immediately after exposure as shown by electron microscopy. The level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in irradiated cells was 20 times higher as compared to control. In irradiated cells de novo protein synthesis was reduced considerably immediately after irradiation. Treatment of cells with tetracycline also affected photosynthesis as in irradiated cells. The results showed that photoinhibition of photosynthetic apparatus after incubation of irradiated cells was probably augmented due to reduced protein synthesis. Active photosynthesis is known to require uninterrupted replenishment of some of the proteins involved in electron transport chain. The defective thylakoid membrane biogenesis may be leading to photosynthetic decline post-irradiation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Observation results by SEM, EDS and XRD confirmed that Mn and Co catalysts were successfully loaded onto GAC. The electrochemical properties were measured using an electrochemical workstation. Mn-Co/GAC had a much higher oxygen evolution potential (1.46V) than GAC (1.1V), which demonstrated that it could effectively reduce the oxygen evolution side reaction. In addition, Mn-Co/GAC had an electrochemically active surface area 1.34 times that of GAC and a much smaller mass transfer resistance than GAC, which could provide favorable conditions for the degradation of pollutants. The investigation of the influences of single operating parameters on total organic carbon (TOC) removal rate and electrical energy consumption (EEC) indicated that current density and treatment time had the greatest effect. In order to maximize TOC removal rate and minimize EEC, optimization of operating parameters was also carried out using response surface method in combination with central composite design. The optimal operating parameters were determined as current density of 5.68 mA/cm2, electrolyte concentration of 0.127M, particle electrode dosage of 31.14g and treatment time of 120min. Under this optimum operating condition, TOC removal rate of 85.24% and amoxicillin removal rate of 100% could be achieved with a low EEC of 0.073 kWh/g TOC. In addition, TOC removal rate and EEC were significantly improved compared to the use of bare GAC as particle electrode under the same operating conditions, demonstrating the excellent electrocatalytic ability of the new particle electrode Mn-Co/GAC. A possible mechanism of enhanced amoxicillin and TOC removal was also recommended. In summary, the 3D electrochemical method using Mn-Co/GAC particle electrodes is a suitable choice for amoxicillin wastewater treatment.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-9351	1096-0953		WOS:000772071400006	35081359

Connolly, Devin/0000-0001-9104-7485			Direct measurement of resonance strengths in S-34(alpha,gamma)Ar-38 at astrophysically relevant energies using the DRAGON recoil separator								PHYSICAL REVIEW C				97	3					035801	10.1103/PhysRevC.97.035801				MAR 7 2018	2018	Background: Nucleosynthesis of mid-mass elements is thought to occur under hot and explosive astrophysical conditions. Radiative a capture on S-34 has been shown to impact nucleosynthesis in several such conditions, including core and shell oxygen burning, explosive oxygen burning, and type Ia supernovae.Purpose: Broad uncertainties exist in the literature for the strengths of three resonances within the astrophysically relevant energy range (E-CM = 1.94-3.42 MeV at T = 2.2GK). Further, there are several states in 38Ar within this energy range which have not been previously measured. This work aimed to remeasure the resonance strengths of states for which broad uncertainty existed as well as to measure the resonance strengths and energies of previously unmeasured states.Methods: Resonance strengths and energies of eight narrow resonances (five of which had not been previously studied) were measured in inverse kinematics with the DRAGON facility at TRIUMF by impinging an isotopically pure beam of S-34 ions on a windowless He-4 gas target. Prompt. emissions of de-exciting Ar-38 recoils were detected in an array of bismuth germanate scintillators in coincidence with recoil nuclei, which were separated from unreacted beam ions by an electromagnetic mass separator and detected by a time-of-flight system and a multianode ionization chamber.Results: The present measurements agree with previous results. Broad uncertainty in the resonance strength of the E-CM = 2709 keV resonance persists. Resonance strengths and energies were determined for five low-energy resonances which had not been studied previously, and their strengths were determined to be significantly weaker than those of previously measured resonances.Conclusions: The five previously unmeasured resonances were found not to contribute significantly to the total thermonuclear reaction rate. A median total thermonuclear reaction rate calculated using data from the present work along with existing literature values using the STARLIB rate calculator agrees with the NON-SMOKER statistical model calculation as well as the REACLIB and STARLIB library rates at explosive and nonexplosive oxygen-burning temperatures (T = 3-4GK and T = 1.5-2.7GK, respectively).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2469-9985	2469-9993		WOS:000426780000007		
J	Mani, Kyle; Zournas, Apostolos; Dismukes, G. Charles								Bridging the gap between Kok-type and kinetic models of photosynthetic electron transport within Photosystem II								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				151	1			83	102		10.1007/s11120-021-00868-6		AUG 2021		JAN 2022	2022	Historically, two modeling approaches have been developed independently to describe photosynthetic electron transport (PET) from water to plastoquinone within Photosystem II (PSII): Markov models account for losses from finite redox transition probabilities but predict no reaction kinetics, and ordinary differential equation (ODE) models account for kinetics but not for redox inefficiencies. We have developed an ODE mathematical framework to calculate Markov inefficiencies of transition probabilities as defined in Joliot-Kok-type catalytic cycles. We adapted a previously published ODE model for PET within PSII that accounts for 238 individual steps to enable calculation of the four photochemical inefficiency parameters (miss, double hit, inactivation, backward transition) and the four redox accumulation states (S-states) that are predicted by the most advanced of the Joliot-Kok-type models (VZAD). Using only reaction kinetic parameters without other assumptions, the RODE-calculated time-averaged (e.g., equilibrium) inefficiency parameters and equilibrium S-state populations agree with those calculated by time-independent Joliot-Kok models. RODE also predicts their time-dependent values during transient photochemical steps for all 96 microstates involving PSII redox cofactors. We illustrate applications to two cyanobacteria, Arthrospira maxima and Synechococcus sp. 7002, where experimental data exists for the inefficiency parameters and the S-state populations, and historical data for plant chloroplasts as benchmarks. Significant findings: RODE predicts the microstates responsible for period-4 and period-2 oscillations of O-2 and fluorescence yields and the four inefficiency parameters; the latter parameters are not constant for each S state nor in time, in contrast to predictions from Joliot-Kok models; some of the recombination pathways that contribute to the backward transition parameter are identified and found to contribute when their rates exceed the oxidation rate of the terminal acceptor pool (PQH(2)); prior reports based on the assumptions of Joliot-Kok parameters may require reinterpretation.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000685379300001	34402027

Herein, a covalent-organic frameworks (COFs) based composite with FeN species and Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles embedded in N-doped carbon nanosheets (Fe/Fe3C@FeN-Cs) has been successfully synthesized by an in-situ reduction of pre-designed Fe-N-2-O-2 units. Benefit from the compositional and structural synergistic effect, the optimized Fe/Fe3C@FeN-C-900 displays excellent ORR activity in both acidic (E-1/2 = 0.77 V) and alkaline (E-1/2 = 0.88 V) electrolytes, which are comparable and even superior to the benchmark Pt/C. Impressively, the maximum power density of fuel cell using Fe/Fe3C@FeN-C-900 as cathode catalyst reaches 408 mW cm(-2). Moreover, the Fe/Fe3C@FeN-C-900-drived rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs) deliver a higher power density (156.8 mW cm(-2)), larger specific capacity (775 mA h g(-1)) and better cycling stability (270 cycles) as compared with the state-of-the-art Pt/C counterpart. The interfacial electron transfer between Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles and neighboring FeN species, as well as the porous carbon architecture contribute to the excellent ORR performance of Fe/Fe3C@FeN-C-900, resulting in the easily adsorption/activation of O-2 and accelerated ORR kinetics because of the fast mass transfer. The COF-derived synthetic strategy inspires new perspectives to develop hetero-nanoparticle composites as high-efficiency ORR electrocatalysts for the economical-practical energy conversion devices.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000776698100001

TOS synthesis has faced a great challenge as it requires a controllable technique. In this article, molybdenum oxysulfide nano-flowers decorated on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets were synthesised by a facile, easy and controllable plasma technique. Anionic substitution is performed by oxygen incorporation, which improves poor conductivity, lack of intrinsic activity and limited active sites. To control sulfur substitution, we have used the O-2 plasma technique to incorporate O as an anionic substitute and form molybdenum oxysulfide. Anionic substitution by O-2 plasma exposure is an effective, time-efficient, and promising way to fabricate transition metal oxysulfide. We found that after irradiation for continuously 180 s with O-2 plasma partial S is substituted by O, which forms molybdenum oxysulfide with the formula MoS2-xOx supported on RGO. After anionic substitution, it shows high-performance towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst as well as towards supercapacitor applications. After irradiation for 180 s with O-2 plasma, MoS2-xOx shows the best HER catalytic activity with an exchange current density of 8.6 x 10(-5) A cm(-2), Tafel slope of 140 mV dec(-1) and transfer coefficient of 0.42. In this study, we also investigate the supercapacitor properties that delivered high specific capacitance (14.57 mF cm(-2) at 0.01 mA cm(-2)) along with impressive cycling stability. This strategy will pave a new pathway for the development of TOSs, which act as a new class of electrocatalysts due to synergistic structural and electronic modulations.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2398-4902			WOS:000668621600001

Herein, we report a novel remarkable octopus tentacles-like tungsten oxide and carbon coated cobalt oxide (WO3/C@CoO) catalyst on Ni foam (NF) for HER at the first time, which is synthesized via simple hydrothermal process and immersion method. The obtained Ar/H-2-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF catalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity toward HER with an onset potential of 40mV (vs. RHE) and a Tafel slope of 115mV dec(-1) in 1M KOH, which is significantly better than the Ar-treatedWO3/C@CoO/NF and the CoO/NF NWs. In addition, the prepared Ar/H-2-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF electrode has an outstanding electrocatalytic durability in a long period of stability test for 110 h. Such outstanding property of the Ar/H-2-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF electrocatalyst is attributed to its 3D conductive substitute, carbon coating, strong synergistic effect of between WO3 and CoO and the unique octopus tentacles-like structure making it a very excellent catalyst for hydrogen production. All these experimental results clearly suggest that Ar/H-2-treated WO3/C@CoO/NF electrocatalyst can improve HER catalytic activity and thus has potential practical applications in water splitting.

Strong evidence for multiple populations of stars in globular clusters derives from observed abundance anomalies. A puzzling example is the recently detected Mg-K anticorrelation in NGC 2419. We perform Monte Carlo nuclear reaction network calculations to constrain the temperature-density conditions that gave rise to the elemental abundances observed in this elusive cluster. We find a correlation between stellar temperature and density values that provide a satisfactory match between simulated and observed abundances in NGC 2419 for all relevant elements (Mg, Si, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, and V). Except at the highest densities (rho greater than or similar to 10(8) g cm(-3)), the acceptable conditions range from approximate to 100MK at approximate to 10(8) g cm(-3) to approximate to 200 MK at approximate to 10(-4) g cm(-3). This result accounts for uncertainties in nuclear reaction rates and variations in the assumed initial composition. We review hydrogen-burning sites and find that low-mass stars, asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, massive stars, or supermassive stars cannot account for the observed abundance anomalies in NGC 2419. Super-AGB stars could be viable candidates for the polluter stars if stellar model parameters can be fine-tuned to produce higher temperatures. Novae, involving either CO or ONe white dwarfs, could be interesting polluter candidates, but a current lack of low-metallicity nova models precludes firmer conclusions. We also discuss whether additional constraints for the first-generation polluters can be obtained by future measurements of oxygen, or by evolving models of second-generation low-mass stars with a non-canonical initial composition.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000370370800098

The enlargement of the intercalant size and the lowering of the charge density were effective in increasing the content of oxygen vacancies and enhancing the porosity of the stacked nanosheets via layer thinning. The defect-rich Co-Al-LDH-NO3- nanohybrid with a small stacking number exhibited excellent performance as an oxygen evolution electrocatalyst and supercapacitor electrode with a large specific capacitance of similar to 2230 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1), which is the largest capacitance of carbon-free LDH-based electrodes reported to date. Combined with the results of density functional theory calculations, the observed excellent correlations between the overpotential/capacitance and the defect content/stacking number highlight the importance of defect/stacking structures in optimizing the energy functionalities. This was attributed to enhanced orbital interactions with water/hydroxide at an increased number of defect sites. The present cost-effective lattice engineering process can therefore provide an economically feasible methodology to explore high-performance electrocatalyst/electrode materials.									19	1	0	0	1	0	19			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000656994100033	33861569

The O K edge, Ti L-2,L-3 and Cr L-2,L-3 edge were monitored. Upon removal of Li ions, the oxygen K edge shows a continuous change while the Cr L edges remain almost unchanged. The Cr 2p multiplet was compared with reference samples (Cr2O3, CrO2 and K2Cr2O7) in order to assess on the sensitivity of the Cr L-edge to the oxidation state of chromium ion.The similarity between the Cr L spectra of Cr2O3 and CrO2 makes the valence analysis difficult in Li5/3-xTi7/3CrO7 but the presence of Cr-VI is excluded in oxidized samples. However, evolution of the low energy loss spectra observed in the 10-15 eV region confirms the modification of the electronic structure and partial oxidation of Cr-III to Cr-IV.

Defect engineering is proved to be a very useful strategy to promote the photocatalytic performance of metal-based photocatalysts, however, the vital role of defects is still ambiguous. This work comprehensively reviews point defective metal-based photocatalysts for water splitting, focusing on understanding the defects' disorder effect on optical adsorption, charge separation and migration, and surface reaction. The controllable synthesis and tuning strategies of defective structure to improve the photocatalytic performance are summarized, then the characterization techniques and density functional theory calculations are discussed to unveil the defect structure, and analyze the defects induced electronic structure change of catalysts and its ultimate effect on the photocatalytic activity at the molecular level. Finally, the challenge in developing more efficient defective metal-based photocatalysts is outlined. This work may help further the understanding of the fundamental role of defect structure in the photocatalytic reaction process and guide the rational design and fabrication of highly efficient and low-cost photocatalysts.									154	13	0	0	12	0	154				2198-3844		WOS:000468187200014	31131201

The interplay between reconstruction, Sr enrichment, and reduction at the La0.75Sr0.25MnO3 (001) surface								PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS				4	1					015801	10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.4.015801				JAN 31 2020	2020	Perovskite oxides used in heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis are tuned by substitutional doping. Sr-doped LaMnO3 is a popular choice of electrode material for electrochemical energy conversion. At elevated temperatures, relevant to solid oxide fuel or electrolysis cells, Sr enriches at the surface, which leads to fast degradation of the oxygen exchange activity at the surface. In this work, we investigate the effect of oxygen partial pressure p(O-2) and temperature on Sr segregation at the La0.75Sr0.25MnO3 (001) (LSM25) surface by ab initio thermodynamics calculations, taking into account different terminations and point defects Sr'(La), V-O(center dot center dot), V-Mn''' , V-La''', O-ad, as well as associated defects of the type [V-O(center dot center dot)- V-cation''']. This model of the LSM25(001) surface addresses the connection between point defects and surface stability and makes quantitative predictions about the surface termination and Sr enrichment. Our results indicate that the MnO2 termination is stable under oxidizing conditions, while a partially covering SrO termination on MnO2 is stable for reaction conditions between 1000 and 1400 K and effective oxygen partial pressures between 10(-11) bar and 0.1 bar relevant to solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathodes. Under more reducing conditions, we find that Sr is enriched at the surface regardless of surface termination. This trend is a direct consequence of the increased formation of positively charged oxygen vacancies at the surface, and this conclusion holds regardless of which surface termination is assumed. The partial SrO termination is exceptionally stable under SOFC cathode conditions because it minimizes the surface dipole density, while all the defect-free terminations of LSM25(001) are unstable due to surface polarity. This newly proposed termination leaves both Sr, as well as Mn and O sites of the MnO2 layer exposed at the surface and available for interaction with the gas phase. We propose that the LSM25(001) surface may consist of coexisting (La,Sr)O and MnO2 domains under SOFC cathode conditions, and we propose to include such a micropatterned surface in the future discussion of the active site in the oxygen reduction reaction.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2475-9953			WOS:000510393500002

Pyrite cobalt disulfide (CoS2) is one of the potential HER catalysts due to its low price and inherent metallicity, but its catalytic activity is still unsatisfactory possibly attributed to the S sites with catalytic inert; hydrogen adsorption on S sites is weak extremely. Metal cation doping has been considered as one of the most available methods to modulate the electronic structure of electrocatalysts. Here, we report non-transition metal tin (Sn) doped CoS2 nanowire arrays grown on carbon cloth (Sn-CoS2/CC) as available catalysts for HER. The Sn-CoS2/CC catalyst with optimal doping concentration not only has an enhanced over potential of 161 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and the Tafel slope is 94 mV dec(-1), but also shows good long-term durability in 32 h of testing. Experimental results and further density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that Sn doping can improve the charge transfer ability, enhance electronic conductivity, and arouse the catalytic insert S sites with optimal hydrogen adsorption free energy (Delta G(H*)). This work investigates a new method to activate the inert sites in metal-compound catalysts for water splitting and beyond through non-transition metal doping.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000620786300002

Combining novel self-supporting structure and high-performance transition metal phosphides (TMP) shows substantial promise for practical application in water splitting. In this review, we try to provide a comprehensive analysis of the design and fabrication of various self-supported TMP electrodes for hydrogen evolution reaction, which are divided into three categories: catalysts growing on carbon-based substrates, catalysts growing on metal-based substrates and freestanding catalyst films. The material structures together with catalytic performances of self-supported electrodes are presented and discussed. We also show the specific strategies to further improve the catalytic performance by elemental doping or incorporation of nanocarbons.

This study introduces an approach to simultaneously load two redox cocatalysts, atomically dispersed cobalt for improving oxidation activity and anthraquinone for improving reduction selectivity, onto graphitic carbon nitride (C3N4) nanosheets for photocatalytic H2O2 production. Spatial separation of oxidative and reductive cocatalysts was achieved on a two-dimensional (2D) photocatalyst, by coordinating cobalt single atom above the void center of C3N4 and anchoring anthraquinone at the edges of C3N4 nanosheets. Such spatial separation, experimentally confirmed and computationally simulated, was found to be critical for enhancing surface charge separation and achieving efficient H2O2 production. This center/edge strategy for spatial separation of cocatalysts may be applied on other 2D photo-catalysts that are increasingly studied in photosynthetic reactions.									112	6	0	0	18	0	114			0027-8424			WOS:000521821800020	32161133

The inhibition of S state cycling, slowing of Y-Z(.) reduction, appearance of Mn2+ and the yield of a Hpp < 10 mT S-3 type EPR signal are decreased by calcium addition. This indicates that these effects were probably associated with calcium depletion arising from the high concentration of ammonium cation. The ammonia-induced changes to the S-2 multiline EPR signal are not affected by calcium addition. The appearance of Mn2+ is shown to be reversible on illumination, suggesting that the Mn reduced from the native state is located at or near the native site. Simulations of the interaction which gives rise to the S-3 EPR signal are also presented and discussed. These indicate that lineshape differences occur through small changes in the exchange component of the interaction between the manganese complex and organic radical, probably through minor structural changes between the variously treated samples.									40	0	0	0	30	0	40			0005-2728			WOS:A1994QG26500017	7803449

The evolution of the phase characterization and morphology of ZrB2 powder oxidized at 700 degrees C for varying durations was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. The excellent fit of TG curves by multiple-law model suggests that the oxidation of ZrB2 powder in air follows para-linear kinetics, and based on the fitted results, oxidation mechanisms can also be obtained. The reaction product of ZrB2 powder with oxygen is metastable tetragonal ZrO2 at 700 degrees C, and the tetragonal phase transforms to the monoclinic phase with oxidation. The oxidation of ZrB2 powder is associated with surface microcrack formation, which is attributed to volume expansion resulting from oxidation of ZrB2 to tetragonal ZrO2 and tetragonal-to-monoclinic phase transformation of ZrO2. In the last stage of oxidation, each ZrB2 particle breaks into fragments. (c) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.									42	2	0	0	0	0	42			0925-8388			WOS:000265086300110

However, the HER catalytic active sites of ReS2 are still limited to the finite edges of the nanosheets and the basal-plane is catalytically inert. How to activate the in-plane catalytic activity of ReS2 accordingly becomes the sticking point to further boost its H-2 evolution efficiency. Here, the fluorinated ReS2 hierarchical structure assembled as ultrathin nanosheets is proved to exhibit excellent HER activity, where the optimal sample of ReS2-F-5.93 shows a low overpotential of 142 mV vs. RHE at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 64 mV dec(-1), and significantly improved stability. The enhanced HER performance is mainly attributed to the synergistic effects of increased in-plane active sites and remarkably accelerated charge transfer kinetics. The density functional theory calculation results reveal that F doping can yield the optimal H* adsorption Gibbs free energy and meanwhile increase the electronic states near the Fermi level for accelerated electron transfer. This work can broaden the horizon for designing efficient HER electrocatalysts via activating the in-plane catalytic activity of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs).									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000661965600001

Herein, a novel 3D hierarchical V-Ni-based nitride heterojunction on carbon cloth (VN@Ni3N-Ni/CC) was designed and fabricated as a promising pH-universal HER electrocatalyst through the controllable nitridation of the corresponding V-Ni-O/CC precursor. A series of experimental parameters were tested to adjust the nanostructure of the material and to gain insight into the relationship between its structure and activity. The VN@Ni3N-Ni/CC sample produced under optimized conditions showed excellent catalytic activity and stability over a wide pH range with onset potentials of 8, 23 and 32 mV and Tafel slopes of 40, 97 and 79 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH, 1.0 M PBS and 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolytes, respectively. Notably, with regards to catalytic activity, our VN@Ni3N-Ni/CC sample outperformed most currently available non-noble metal catalysts, and was also found to be superior to Pt-C/CC at certain current density intervals in alkaline and neutral media. The outstanding performance of VN@Ni3N-Ni/CC was mainly attributed to the highly active heterointerfaces, excellent electronic conductivity and facilitated mass transport of its 3D hierarchical framework. We expect the results of this work to help in the design and engineering of other heterojunction materials based on hybrids of early- and late-transition metals, and hence yield materials that may be used as highly efficient catalysts for various applications.									72	7	0	0	1	0	73			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000474271200032

Different anode processes take place during the electrochemical machining (ECM) process of iron in NaNO3. Iron is dissolved as Fe2+ and Fe3+ and oxygen evolution appears. The different reaction products are analysed quantitatively and time resolved for pulses 10 ms less than or equal to t(pulse) less than or equal to 5000 ms under ECM conditions by a combination of our flow-through-microcell with an UV-vis-spectrometer and a pulse generator. The surface structure during pulsed ECM and the appearance of the machined surface is shown in dependence of the pulse length and the prepolarisation of the electrode. Crucial for the obtained results are the build-up and removal of the oxides. as well as the polishing film. The model for stationary ECM conditions is extended to a time resolved model.

In this work, a facile co-precipitation method, followed by thermal postsynthetic treatment in N-2/air, was developed to synthesize molybdenum-doped alpha-Mn2O3 materials (Mn2O3:1.72%Mo, Mn2O3:2.64%Mo, Mn2O3:32.23%Mo, and Mn2O3:49.67%Mo) as low-cost water-oxidizing electrocatalysts. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) investigations showed the presence of strong distortions in the molybdenum-doped alpha-Mn2O3 host lattice (Mn2O3:2.64%Mo) and an average oxidation state of Mn-2.84. Several test assays demonstrated that these structural features significantly promote the OER activity. Mn2O3:2.64%Mo was found to exhibit very good activity among the series in cerium ammonium nitrate (CAN)-assisted water oxidation with a maximum turnover frequency (TOF) of 585 mu mol O-2 m-(2) h(-1), which is a 15-fold improvement of the pure alpha-Mn2O3 activity and higher than the value of the previously reported benchmark Mn-based catalyst, birnessite. The optimized catalyst (Mn2O3:2.64%Mo) excelled through a low onset potential (300 mV) and a promising overpotential of 570 mV for OER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is only 20 mV above that of the noble metal benchmark RuO2 electrode and competitive with that of the most active Mn-based OER catalysts reported to date. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies demonstrated that the catalytically active surface area of Mn2O3:2.64%Mo is much higher than that of alpha-Mn2O3 for the OER at the applied potential. In addition, stability during 30 h without degradation was achieved, which exceeds that of a wide range of current noble-metal-free electrocatalysts. Our study provides a facile and effective approach for the preparation of economical and high-performance manganese-based electrocatalysts for water oxidation.									44	0	0	0	6	0	44			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200043

A mechanistic study shows that the high chemical reactivity of NH3 causes ammonolysis of the ligands and allows ligand removal well below their carbonization temperature. In conventional thermal decomposition in Ar, metal-ligand bond dissociation and ligand carbonization occurs in the same temperature region, resulting in a catalyst with high carbon content and much poorer HER performance. We further improve the HER performance by combining the NH3 induced fragmentation and destabilization of the Ni-MOF structure by low levels of Co substitution, which results in smaller, more uniform catalyst particles. Using the noble metal free HER catalyst, an overall solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 7.9% is achieved in an electrolyzer driven by a commercial polycrystalline solar cell with an efficiency of 12.9%.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			2055-6756	2055-6764		WOS:000433439100005	32254074

Overpotentials at the cathode and anode are minimised by incorporating light-driven elements into both biphasic reactions. The concepts viability is demonstrated by electrochemical H-2 production from water splitting utilising a polarised water-organic interface in the cathodic compartment of a prototype H-cell. At the cathode the reduction of decamethylferrocenium cations ([Cp-2*Fe-(III)](+)) to neutral decamethylferrocene (Cp-2*Fe-(II)) in 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) solvent takes place at the solid electrode/oil interface. This electron transfer process induces the ion transfer of a proton across the immiscible water/oil interface to maintain electroneutrality in the oil phase. The oil-solubilised proton immediately reacts with Cp-2*Fe-(II) to form the corresponding hydride species, [Cp-2*Fe-(IV)(H)](+). Subsequently, [Cp-2*Fe-(IV)(H)](+) spontaneously undergoes a chemical reaction in the oil phase to evolve hydrogen gas (H-2) and regenerate [Cp-2*Fe-(III)](+), whereupon this catalytic Electrochemical, Chemical, Chemical (ECC') cycle is repeated. During biphasic electrolysis, the stability and recyclability of the [Cp-2*Fe-(III)](+)/Cp-2*Fe-(II) redox couple were confirmed by chronoamperometric measurements and, furthermore, the steady-state concentration of [Cp-2*Fe-(III)](+) monitored in situ by UV/vis spectroscopy. Post-biphasic electrolysis, the presence of H-2 in the headspace of the cathodic compartment was established by sampling with gas chromatography. The rate of the biphasic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was enhanced by redox electrocatalysis in the presence of floating catalytic molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) microparticles at the immiscible water/oil interface. The use of a superhydrophobic organic electrolyte salt was critical to ensure proton transfer from water to oil, and not anion transfer from oil to water, in order to maintain electroneutrality after electron transfer. The design, testing and successful optimisation of the operation of the biphasic electrolysis cell under dark conditions with Cp-2*Fe-(II) lays the foundation for the achievement of photo-induced biphasic water electrolysis at low overpotentials using another metallocene, decamethylrutheneocene (Cp-2*Ru-(II)). Critically, Cp-2*Ru-(II) may be recycled at a potential more positive than that of proton reduction in DCE.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000408671600010	28820214

Herein, core-shell NiOOH/Ni nanoarchitectures supported on the conductive carbon cloth have been successfully prepared by a facile electrodeposition process of Ni, and a subsequent in situ electrochemical oxidation. When explored as an alkaline HER electrocatalyst, the as-synthesized NiOOH/Ni nanoarchitecture requires only a low overpotential of similar to 111 mV to attain a current density of -10 mA cm(-2), demonstrating its strong catalytic capability of hydrogeneration. The excellent HER activity could well be attributed to the decreasing charge transfer resistance and competitive electrochemical active area of the amorphous NiOOH, compared with inactive Ni substrate. The feasible methodology established in this study can be easily expanded to obtain a series of nano-sized metal oxyhydroxide materials for various energy conversion and storage applications, where Ni-based nanomaterials are among the highly active ones.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000485722400001	31426044

Consequently, fuel cells have been designed to efficiently generate electricity from clean and renewable fuels and have gained increasing attention. In recent years, the development of earth-abundant and cost-effective materials for application in fuel cells has become a key objective worldwide to push the commercialization of this technology. Anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) have become one of the most popular research topics because their alkaline environment allows a wider range of cost-effective materials to be employed as membranes and electrodes. Unitized regenerative AEMFCs (UR-AEMFCs) have also attracted great research interest because of their additional energy storage capability. The electrode performance plays critical role in the practical application of (UR-)AEMFCs. Oxide-based precious metal (PM)-free electrocatalysts have been developed as one class of promising candidates for application in (UR-)AEMFCs due to their many advantages, such as low cost, earth-abundant resources, intrinsic tunable electronic structures and surface properties, and structural flexibility, which can be utilized to lower the kinetic and thermodynamic barriers of oxygen electrocatalysis in an alkaline environment. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review of recent advances in oxide-based PM-free electrocatalysts used for (UR-)AEMFCs considering their synthetic strategies, such as morphology and structure control, electronic and surface properties. In addition, their design principles and corresponding catalytic performances are summarized. The current challenges with their wide application are also discussed to provide some guidelines for the design of next-generation oxide-based electrocatalysts for (UR-)AEMFCs.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000618794400002		
J	Lei, Y; Cant, NW; Trimm, DL								The origin of rhodium promotion of Fe3O4-Cr2O3 catalysts for the high-temperature water-gas shift reaction								JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				239	1			227	236		10.1016/j.jcat.2006.01.033				APR 1 2006	2006	Rhodium promotion of iron-chromium oxide (Fe-Cr) catalysts for the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction was investigated through measurement of the rates of individual reduction and reoxidation steps. The temperature-programmed reduction of the starting Fe2O3 form by H-2 is accelerated by rhodium, with the extent of oxygen removal at 450 degrees C corresponding to Fe3O4 formation. The corresponding reduction by CO proceeds further, in agreement with bulk thermodynamic expectations. However, rhodium has no effect oil the oxygen removal rate. although it leads to substantially increased carbon deposition. The behavior with respect to reoxidation of reduced catalysts is somewhat similar. Rhodium greatly enhances H-2 release during reoxidation by water, presumably by recombining hydrogen atoms transferred from oxide to metal by reverse spillover. The rate of H-2 evolution from the Rh/Fe-Cr system at 280 degrees C is greater than that from Fe-Cr at 380 degrees C. Reoxidation by CO2 is not promoted by Rh and is much slower than that by H2O for the Rh-contaming catalyst. Likewise, reoxidation by H2O/CO2 mixtures results in a much higher yield of H-2 relative to CO for the promoted catalyst compared with the Unpromoted one. The extent to which catalysts previously equilibrated in WGS feeds at 350 degrees C can then be reduced in pulses of CO or H-2 depends oil the composition of the WGS feed. Fe-Cr catalysts do not reduce in H-2 after exposure to H2O/CO (2:1) or it reformate (H2O/CO/H-2/CO2) feed. Hydrogen reduction is possible with Rh/Fe-Cr after exposure to H2O/CO but not after exposure to reformate, for which thermodynamic considerations suggest that the working oxidation state may be lower. The greater reducing power of CO leads to continuing reduction after treatment with both prior feeds. Overall. it is concluded that of the two steps that may restrict the rate of the WGS reaction over iron-chromium oxide catalysts (reduction by CO and H-2 generation through reoxiclation by water), rhodium acts primarily by accelerating the second.

The Al2O3/MgAl2O4/MgO system provides an ideal model system for investigating the mechanisms underlying the migration of interfaces during interface reaction. MgAl2O4 layers have been grown between Al2O3 and MgO, and the atomic structure of Al2O3/MgAl2O4 interfaces at different growth stages was characterized using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy. The oxygen sublattice transforms from hexagonal close-packed (h.c.p.) stacking in Al2O3 to cubic close-packed (c.c.p.) stacking in MgAl2O4. Partial dislocations associated with steps are observed at the interface. At the reaction-controlled early growth stages, such partial dislocations coexist with the edge dislocations. However, at the diffusion-controlled late growth stages, such partial dislocations are dominant. The observed structures indicate that progression of the Al2O3/MgAl2O4 interface into Al2O3 is accomplished by the glide of partial dislocations accompanied by the exchange of Al3+ and Mg2+ cations. The interface migration may be envisaged as a plane-by-plane zipper-like motion, which repeats along the interface facilitating its propagation. MgAl2O4 grains can adopt two crystallographic orientations with a twinning orientation relationship, and grow by dislocations gliding in opposite directions. Where the oppositely propagating partial dislocations and interface steps meet, interlinked twin boundaries and incoherent Sigma 3 grain boundaries form. The newly grown MgAl2O4 grains compete with each other, leading to a growth selection and successive coarsening of the MgAl2O4 grains. This understanding could help to interpret the interface reaction or phase transformation of a wide range of materials that exhibit a similar h.c.p./c.c.p. transition.									3	0	1	0	0	0	3			2053-2733			WOS:000443900900006	30182934

In this work, a synergistically PVP/EG-assisted in situ self-assembly strategy has been successfully developed for preparing flowerlike BiOCl nanospheres (NSP) assembled by ultrathin nanosheets (thickness of 3.8 nm) with abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs). During the hydrothermal process, PVP plays a template role in controlling the orientation of the crystallite growth, leading to the forming of nanosheets. Meanwhlie, ethylene glycol would induce the self-assembly of nanosheets into a loose hierarchical architecture duo to its stereo-hindrance effect. NSP achieves a twice higher photocatalytic conversion of benzylamine than BiOCl nanosheets (NST) under visible light. XPS, ESR, NH3-TPD results manifest that NSP possesses more active sites including OVs and unsaturated Bi atoms than NST, because of avoiding the accumulation of ultrathin nanosheets. In situ FTIR reveals that benzylamine molecules can be chemisorbed and activated on BiOCl interfaces via forming -N center dot center dot center dot Bi- species. The OVs can facilitate the forming of superoxide radicals (center dot O-2(-)), achieving the selective photooxidation. Finally, a possible synergetic mechanism based on the interaction of reactants and catalyst interfaces was proposed to illustrate the photocatalytic process at the molecular level.

Besides providing good information regarding overall treatment performance and dynamics, this methodology also implies large analytical time consumption, and does not offer the actual full sequence of compounds appearing and disappearing during oxidation. On-line Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is herein reported as a very useful tool for this purpose. In particular, it was successfully applied to monitoring the Fenton's oxidation of three model compounds (phenol, acetic acid, and oxalic acid) performed in continuous, providing precise control of the effect of reagents over time. Hydroxylation reactions resulted in the formation of hydroquinone and catechol as the main aromatic by-products being generated along the oxidation of phenol by the Fenton process. All phenolic substances (phenol, hydroquinone, benzoquinone, and catechol) were totally removed along the reaction. Carboxylic acids (oxalic and acetic mainly) were significantly present as final by-products of the oxidation process, highlighting their oxyrecalcitrant behavior. On-line FTIR successfully enabled monitoring the Fenton process, and it provided a precise control of the effect of reagents along reaction time. Applications for a future on-line control of Fenton processes in industry may be developed in order to optimize the use of reagents and the potential combination with biological treatment stages; therefore reducing the operational cost of this advanced oxidation treatment.

Herein, we design mesoporous cobalt ferrite phosphides hybridized on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as a highly efficient bifunctional catalyst through a simple nanocasting method. The hybrid catalyst possesses the abundant interface, which provides the large active sites, as well as the hybrid rGO accelerates the electron exchange and ion diffusion. Moreover, the mesoporous structure not only prevents the aggregation of actives sites, but also benefits for the rapid escape of bubbles during catalytical process, which can significantly improve the catalytic performance. Consequently, the resulting mCo0.5Fe0.5P/rGO shows superior catalytic performance with a low overpotential of 250 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm2 for OER and outstanding long-term stability.

The Ni-Co coating was measured by XRD, SEM and EDS to determine the composition and morphology. The deposition of Ni-Co alloy is anomalous deposition, that is, the ratio of Ni-Co in alloy is not equal to that in the deposition bath. With the increase of cyclic times, the content of Co increases. Polarization curves and AC impedance measurement show that the alloy coating electrodes are more active than the Ni electrode. With the content of Co increase in the alloy coating, the electrocatalytic activities of the alloy coating increase. Heat treatment can also improve the properties of alloy coating for OER.

Graphene-based materials have attracted tremendous research interest owing to special physicochemical properties, for example, unique two-dimensional structure, high theoretical specific surface area, high electrical conductivity, and outstanding acid-base resistance properties. Graphene-supported metal complexes/oxides have been extensively investigated, and exhibit good catalytic activity and stability in water splitting (H-2 generation or oxygen evolution), oxidation/epoxidation of alkenes, C-C bond formation, and so forth. Herein, recent developments in graphene-supported metal complexes/oxides for the catalytic epoxidation of different alkenes are summarized. Site isolation and synergistic interactions between metal complexes/oxides and graphene are the two key roles for enhancing the catalytic activity, whereas the hydrophobicity of the support can efficiently improve epoxide selectivity. In addition, the possible mechanisms of catalytic epoxidation are summarized. This review provides a feasible scheme for the potential application of graphene-based materials and guidance for the rational design of heterogeneous catalysts for catalytic applications.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000453745000002	30277312

By using ethanol as intercalator, the bulk production of high quality graphene with its defects being satisfactorily healed is achieved. The repair of defects using extraneous carbon atoms and the hybrid state of these carbon atoms are definitely demonstrated using isotopic tracing studies with C-13-labeled ethanol combined with C-13 solid-state NMR. The defect healed graphene shows excellent crystallinity, extremely tow oxygen content (C: O ratio of 23.8) and has the highest sheet conductivity (61 500 S m(-1)) compared to all other reported graphene products derived from GO. By using methanol or benzene as intercalators, hierarchically porous graphene with a self-supported 3-dimensional framework (similar to 917 m(2) g(-1)) containing both macropores and mesopores (2-5 nm) is obtained. This graphene possesses a distinctive amorphous carbon structure around the edge of the nanopores, which could be conducive to enhancing the lithium storage performance (up to 580 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles) when tested as an anode of lithium ion batteries, and might have promising applications in the field of electrode materials, catalysis, and separation, and so on. The mechanism involved for the controlled defect evolution is also proposed. The simple, ultrafast and unified strategy developed in this research provides a practical and effective approach to harness structural defects in graphene-based materials, which could also be expanded for designing and preparing other ordered carbon materials with specific structures.									24	1	0	0	3	0	24			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000344836800029	25265966

Herein, we constructed a conductive circuit by growing a layer of hydroxide on the surface of the Fe-MOF, and composite materials (Fe-MOF@Ni(OH)(2)) are applied in the fields of supercapacitor, OER, and electro-chemical sensing. Fe-MOF@Ni(OH)(2) not only maintains the intrinsic advantages of Fe-MOF, but also improves the electrical conductivity. Fe-MOF@Ni(OH)(2) exhibits a high specific capacity of 188 mAh g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) . The energy density of the asymmetric supercapacitor (Fe-MOF@Ni(OH)(2)-20//AC) reaches 67.1 Wh kg(-1). During the oxygen evolution reaction, the overpotential of the material is 280 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and the Tafel slope is 37.6 mV dec(-1). The electrochemical sensing tests showed the detec-tion limit of BPA is 5 mu M. Hence, these results provide key insights into the design of multifunctional elec-trode materials.

CH4/H-2 Mixture was studied as the starting gas mixture. The predictions of gas evolution calculated from this model were used to interpret certain published experimental observations. From the initial analysis, it was concluded that the thermodynamic state of the gas composition determined the effects of transport parameters on diamond growth. In many filament-assisted diamond CVD systems the gas composition was found to be kinetically controlled. The analysis also suggested that CH3 is a major precursor of diamond films. When CH4/H-2/O2 was used as the starting gas mixture, the results indicated that the oxygen additive catalyzed the process to increase the concentrations of CH3 and H, thereby increasing the growth rate and improving the quality of diamond films.					93RD ANNUAL MEETING OF THE AMERICAN CERAMIC SOC93RD ANNUAL MEETING OF THE AMERICAN CERAMIC SOC	APR   30, 1991APR   30, 1991	AMER CERAM SOCAMER CERAM SOC	CINCINNATI, OHCINCINNATI, OH	2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0002-7820			WOS:A1992JH47400012

In this work, quantitative RT-PCR and in situ RNA hybridization were used to determine how the expression of the ethylene biosynthetic machinery in maize roots is spatially and temporally regulated following exposure to 4% oxygen (i.e. hypoxia) for up to 24 h, conditions that induced aerenchyma formation in the fully-expanded region of the root and reduced cytoplasmic density throughout the root. Expression of ACC oxidase, the ethylene forming enzyme, was observed in the root cap, protophloem sieve elements, and companion cells associated with metaphloem sieve elements. Exposure to 4% oxygen induced ACC oxidase expression in these cell types as well as in the root cortex. ACC synthase, which generates the ethylene precursor, was expressed in the root cap and the cortex and its expression was induced in cortical cells following low oxygen treatment. The induction of expression of the ethylene biosynthetic machinery was accompanied by an induction of ethylene evolution and a reduced rate of root growth. These results suggest that maize roots respond to conditions of hypoxia by inducing the spatially restricted expression of the ethylene biosynthetic machinery, resulting in increased ethylene production.									63	4	1	0	59	5	68			0022-0957	1460-2431		WOS:000274345000022	20008461

Kinetic data from in situ PXRD monitoring were analyzed using Sharp-Hancock and Gualtieri approaches, which both clearly indicate a change of the growth mechanism for reaction temperatures above 185 degrees C. This mechanistic transition goes hand in hand with morphology changes that notably influence the photocatalytic oxygen evolution activity. Complementary quenching investigations of conventional hydrothermal Co3O4 growth demonstrate that these insights derived from in situ PXRD data provide valuable synthetic guidelines for water oxidation catalyst production. Furthermore, the ex situ analyses of hydrothermal quenching experiments were essential to assess the influence of amorphous cobalt-containing phases arising from the acetate precursor on the catalytic activity. Thereby, the efficient combination of a single in situ technique with ex situ analyses paves the way to optimize parameter-sensitive hydrothermal production processes of key energy materials.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000452614800025	29790222

We utilize gold as a site blocking element and investigate the CO monolayer oxidation as a model structure-sensitive surface reaction on nanostructured electrodes prepared by Pt electrodeposition. The evolution of the hydrogen UPD with the gold coverage suggests that Au adatoms sequentially block (100) terraces and steps, then (110) steps, and finally (111) facets. This leads to a systematic shift of the CO-stripping peaks towards positive potentials. Investigation of the carbon monoxide dosing in situ with infrared spectroscopy provides information on the influence of Au adatoms on the formation of COads adlayers. We conclude that an exceptionally high activity of nanostructured Pt electrodes prepared by electrodeposition results from the presence of low-coordinated defect sites which are presumably located at the emergence of grain boundaries at the surface. These defects on the one hand serve as active sites for the formation of active oxygen-containing adsorbates, and on the other hand prevent formation of densely packed CO islands.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1868-2529			WOS:000312634100008

Previous researches have certified that diffuse plasma can be generated in some mixture gas gap between needle and plate, which may have potential application in biomedicine, film surface modification etc. In this paper, a self-consistent, multiple species, two-dimension numerical model, based on hydromechanics and electric Poisson's equation, is established to study the properties of gas-mixture discharge in needle-to-plate structure with a 0.1mm gas gap, where the needle is connected to high voltage sources and the grounded plate electrode is covered by a 0.03mm PTFE film. Moreover, the gas-mixture is consisted of 99% helium and 1% air (79% nitrogen and 21% oxygen) while 11 kinds of particles and 27 kinds of chemical reactions are taken into account. After about one-week computation, models driven by both positive and negative 400 V pulse voltages are solved respectively, which releases that electron has similar and dispersive distribution in both positive and negative discharge when it is at the peak of discharge current pulse, differing slightly from that of streamer. Then, the spatial and temporal evolutions of neutral particles (O3, O, N, He* etc.) are analyzed, which demonstrates that the ozone and oxygen atom have their maximum density near the cathode regardless of the polarity of voltage, and the high concentration area of nitrogen atoms and metastable helium atoms are always behind the head of ionization wave. Through the model, it can be proven precisely that the electrical field can be distorted by the electric field created by 8 kinds of charged particles, where various ions have very different spatial and temporal distribution because of the different production mechanism and ion mobility. In the process of discharge, Penning reaction and charge exchange reactions are believed to be significant in the production of some ions (e.g. N2+, O2+ etc.) and seeding electron.					2015 42nd IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science (ICOPS)2015 42nd IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science (ICOPS)	24-28 May 201524-28 May 2015		Antalya, TurkeyAntalya, Turkey	0	0	0	0	0	0	0						INSPEC:15360851

Metal hydroxide such as Ni (OH)(2) has been proven useful for promoting alkaline HER, but the performance remains unsatisfactory. Herein, the electronic structure of Ni(OH)(2) is modulated by the interfacial electron rearrangement between Ni-Ni(OH)(2) heterojunction. Combined experiments with DFT simulations, the electrons of Ni species accumulate to the interfacial Ni-Ni(OH)(2) sites, which modifies the d band center for promoting conversion of hydrogen intermediates and narrows the energy gap for boosting charge transfer in the HER process. Thus, the integrated electrode exhibits an efficient HER performance to drive 10 mA cm(-2) at the overpotential of 72 mV with a low Tafel slope of 43 mV dec(-1). Our work renders a valuable insight for understanding and rationally designing efficient catalysts in alkaline HER.

Thus, the evolution of molecular biology has significantly changed our methods of approaching our research. A similar far-reaching finding has been the advent of radical reactions into biology. Although radical chemistry has been utilized for many technological advances that affect our daily lives, the appreciation of this same process within our cells has opened an unexplored arena for research enquiry. As cellular messengers, radical molecules seem whimsically designed: they are evanescent, rapidly and apparently indiscriminately reactive, and barely detectable by most biological methods. Yet, our initial probing of these reactive agents in cells and organisms has led us to postulate a virtually undescribed system of communication within and among cells which may have significant effects in multiple organs.

The electrodes were used to study the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the dark and under illumination using in situ potential-modulated absorption spectroscopy (PMAS) and light-modulated absorption spectroscopy (LMAS) combined with impedance spectroscopy. Formation of surface-bound higher-valent iron species (or "surface trapped holes") was deduced from the PMAS spectra measured in the OER onset region. Similar LMAS spectra were obtained at more negative potentials in the onset region of photoelectrochemical OER, indicating involvement of the same intermediates. The impedance response of the mesoporous alpha-Fe2O3 electrodes exhibits characteristic transmission line behavior that is attributed to slow hopping of holes, probably between surface iron species. Frequency-resolved PMAS and LMAS measurements revealed slow relaxation behavior that can be related to the impedance response and that indicates that the lifetime of the intermediates (or trapped holes) involved in the OER is remarkably long.									135	4	0	0	8	0	136			0002-7863			WOS:000301084300082	22191733

The reductive quenching pathway facilitated by photoexcited [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) overcomes the high overpotential observed for CoMP11-Ac in electrocatalysis, yielding turnover numbers ranging from 606 to 2390 (2 mu M - 0.1 mu M CoMP11-Ac). The longevity of CoMP11-Ac in the photochemical system, sustaining catalysis for over 20 h, is in contrast to its previously reported behavior in an electrochemical system where catalysis slows after 15 min. Proton reduction turnover number and rate are highest at a neutral pH, a rare feature among cobalt catalysts in similar photochemical systems, which typically function best under acidic conditions. Incorporating biomolecular components into the design of catalysts for photochemical systems may address the need for hydrogen generation from neutral-pH water sources.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0162-0134	1873-3344		WOS:000632487200008	33588276

This involved an electrolytic reactor with aluminium electrodes and a separation/flotation tank. The water to be treated passed through the reactor and was subjected to coagulation/flotation, by Al(III) ions dissolved from the electrodes, the resulting flocs floating after being captured by hydrogen gas bubbles generated at cathode surfaces. Apparent current efficiencies for Al dissolution as aqueous Al(III) species at pH 6.5 and 7.8 were greater than unity. This was due to additional reactions occurring in parallel with Al dissolution: oxygen reduction at anodes and cathodes and hydrogen evolution at cathodes resulting in net (i.e. oxidation + reduction) currents at both anodes and cathodes. The specific electrical energy consumption of the reactor for drinking water treatment was as low as 20 kWh (kg Al)(1) for current densities of 10 20A m(-2). The water treatment performance of the electrocoagulation process kas found to be superior to that of conventional coagulation with aluminium sulphate for treating a model-coloured water, with 20% more dissolved organic carbon (DOC) being removed for the same Al(III) dose. However, for a lowland surface water sample, the two processes achieved a similar performance for DOC and UV-absorbance removal. In addition, an up-flow electrocoagulator configuration performed better than a horizontal flow configuration, with both bipolar and monopolar electrodes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Li, Tang-ming; Han, Jing-hua; Hu, Bing-qian; Yu, Fan; Li, Bao								A highly active oxygen evolution electrocatalyst derived from Co/Ni-succinic acid framework under mild conditions								CRYSTENGCOMM				24	7			1453	1458		10.1039/d1ce01636a		JAN 2022		FEB 14 2022	2022	In order to explore oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with advantages of energy saving, high efficiency, and environmental protection, a bimetallic Co/Ni-based succinic acid framework has been utilized as the parent scaffold to derive a related electrocatalyst under mild conditions. Compared to commonly selected MOFs as sacrificial parents constructed with aromatic ligands under high-temperature reactions, the Co/Ni-based succinic acid framework is synthesized at room temperature with very cheap components. The overall cost has been reduced in terms of starting materials. The electrocatalytic performance for OER has been realized by the doping of Ni into the Co-succinic framework. Then, the pristine MOFs were modified with NaBH4 to produce Co/Ni-B derivatives. The doping amount of the second metal and the modification time of sodium borohydride were systematically studied as variables. The related electrocatalytic performances revealed that Co0.9Ni0.1MOF-10 min showed the best catalytic activity. When the current density is 10 mA cm(-2), the over-potential is 0.264 V while the Tafel slope is 56.2 mV dec(-1) along with excellent stability, which is better than those of commercial IrO2. The improved OER electrocatalytic performance might be caused by the following factors: the existence of high oxidation state Co3+/Ni3+ and defective vacancies. During the post-treatment process of NaBH4, the produced Co or Co/Ni clusters could be oxidized by the co-effect of O-2 and H2O, and subsequently transfer to the higher valence state Co3+ and Ni3+, which could be stabilized by the carboxylate ligands or Co-B/Ni-B coupling. Additionally, bubbles further promote the formation of porous and loose structures, resulting in the formation of multiple defective vacancy sites in the nano-flake sample, which further supplies plenty of active sites and permeable channels for the adsorption and transportation of ions. These special structural characteristics ensure accessible surface area and numerous active sites, leading to enhanced OER electrocatalytic performance. Therefore, using mild preparation conditions to treat very simple MOFs, excellent OER electrocatalysts could still be prepared, which also provides a new research insight into reducing the cost of electrocatalysts and realizing the real industrial application of related materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1466-8033		WOS:000747359900001		
J	Wei, Yan-jie; Li, Guo-yi								Membrane fouling behavior and microbial community succession in a submerged membrane bioreactor treating harbor oily wastewater								JOURNAL OF ZHEJIANG UNIVERSITY-SCIENCE A				17	9			745	757		10.1631/jzus.A1500289				SEP 2016	2016	A membrane bioreactor (MBR) was established for treating harbor oily wastewater. It showed good removal performance for chemical oxygen demand (COD), oil content, suspended solids (SS), and other pollutants. However, serious membrane fouling occurred. It was recognized that the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) accumulated on the membrane surface, especially the proteins, were of great importance for the transmembrane pressure (TMP) increment and membrane fouling. The MBR was optimized via improving aeration rate and reducing the ratio of Ar/Ad (Ar and Ad are the cross-sectional areas of the riser and the downcomer of the MBR). The increasing rate of TMP was slowed, indicating that the optimization strategy could effectively mitigate membrane fouling. Microbial community evolution was monitored and analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), cloning, and sequencing of 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) fragments. Results revealed that low community shift occurred during the whole operational period. Geobacter sp. and Rhodocyclales sp., which have also been identified by other studies in a petroleum refinery wastewater MBR or an infiltration basin receiving highway runoff, dominated in the MBR system throughout. Comamonas sp. was thought to accommodate the lower aeration rate in this study, while Rhodocyclales sp. preferred the higher aeration rate. In addition, during the operational time under high organic loading rate, a few species were present in abundance, and may have been responsible for the good removal performance at this time.									2	3	0	0	0	0	5			1673-565X	1862-1775		WOS:000385412600006

From an evolutionary perspective, the utilization of oxygen as a life supporting means makes oxidative stress an inescapable part of an organism's biological system. The inseparability of oxidative stress from the biological system can be viewed as an adaptive response that all aerobic organisms undergo to ward-off the potentially harmful effects of oxygen and its derivatives, including free radicals. The organism's adaptive mechanisms include an intricate network of defenses that regulate and guard against any over-acting oxidative reactions to ensure its survival. This review discusses and illustrates several adaptive responses at various levels (from gene regulation to physical exercise) that organisms use as part of their survival strategy.

However, little attention has been paid to the doping effect on the photocurrent onset potential of hematite and the underlying mechanism. In this paper, Ti doped hematite nanorod arrays were successfully prepared through a facile treatment of hematite with TiCl3 solution. The photocurrent of the Ti doped hematite photoanode increases by three times, and its onset potential shifts more positively as compared with that of the undoped one. Electrochemical analyses were employed to unravel the mechanism of anodic shift of the onset potential. Cyclic voltammograms and electrochemical impedance spectra confirmed that more surface states were formed in Ti doped hematite than the undoped one. As a result, lower activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and increased electron-hole recombination after light on/off in low potential region were observed in Ti doped hematite. It is concluded that these doping induced surface states may be a hindrance to charge transfer and the onset potential of Ti doped hematite shifts anodically.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1533-4880	1533-4899		WOS:000458411600041	30744771

The inexpensive catalytic material, prepared simply by arc-melting followed by ball-milling, exhibits high stability and sustained catalytic performance under alkaline conditions. The overpotential value of 0.24 V observed at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) remained constant for at least 10 days. Electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy performed on the initial ball-milled material and on the material activated under electrocatalytic conditions suggest that the catalytic mechanism involves partial leaching of Al from the layered structure of AlFe2B2 and the formation of Fe3O4 nanoclusters on the exposed [Fe2B2] layers. Thus, the AlFe2B2 structure serves as a robust supporting material and, more importantly, as a pre-catalyst to the in situ formed active electrocatalytic sites. Comparative electrochemical measurements demonstrate that the electrocatalytic performance of the AlFe2B2-supported Fe3O4 nanoclusters substantially exceeds the results obtained with unsupported nanoparticles of Fe3O4, FeB, or such benchmark OER catalysts as IrO2 or RuO2. The excellent catalytic performance and long-term stability of this system suggests that AlFe2B2 can serve as a promising and inexpensive OER electrocatalyst.									34	2	0	0	1	0	34			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000459929800026	30997000

Here, graphene was successfully created from the greenhouse gas CO2 using molten salts. The results showed that CO2 could be effectively fixed by oxygen ions in CaCl2-NaCl-CaO melts to form carbonate ions, and subsequently electrochemically split into graphene on a stainless steel cathode; O-2 gas was produced at the RuO2-TiO2 inert anode. The formation of graphene in this manner can be ascribed to the catalysis of active Fe, Ni, and Cu atoms at the surface of the cathode and the microexplosion effect through evolution of CO in between graphite layers. This finding may lead to a new generation of proceedures for the synthesis of high value-added products from CO2, which may also contribute to the establishment of a low-carbon and sustainable world.									56	4	0	0	2	0	58			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000373579700004	26871684

In this study, we have designed a facile strategy by tailoring the concentration of precursors to successfully obtain nickel-cobalt bimetallic sulfide (NiCo2S4) using a simple hydrothermal method. The morphology of the newly prepared NiCo(2)S(4)comprised a mixture of microparticles and nanorods, which were few microns in dimension. The crystallinity of the composite sample was found to be excellent with a cubic phase. The sample that contained a higher amount of cobalt compared to nickel and produced single-phase NiCo(2)S(4)exhibited considerably improved HER performance. The variation in the salt precursor concentration during the synthesis of a material is a simple methodology to produce a scalable platinum-free catalyst for HER. The advantageous features of the multiple active sites of cobalt in the CN-21 sample as compared to that for pristine CoS and NiS laid the foundation for the provision of abundant active edges for HER. The composite sample produced a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)at an overpotential of 345 mV. Also, it exhibited a Tafel value of 60 mV dec(-1), which predominantly ensured rapid charge transfer kinetics during HER. CN-21 was highly durable and stable for 30 hours. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed that the charge transfer resistance was 21.88 ohms, which further validated the HER polarization curves and Tafel results. CN-21 exhibited a double layer capacitance of 4.69 mu F cm(-2)and a significant electrochemically active surface area of 134.0 cm(2), which again supported the robust efficiency for HER. The obtained results reveal that our developed NiCo(2)S(4)catalyst has a high density of active edges, and it is a non-noble metal catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction. The present findings provide an alternative strategy and an active nonprecious material for the development of energy-related applications.									3	1	0	0	0	0	4				2046-2069		WOS:000542724200054	35516652

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are routinely used to study the electronic and atomic structures of these materials as well as the thermodynamics and mechanisms of the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction. The accuracy of these theoretical predictions has never been compared to high-level quantum chemistry methods. We perform coupled cluster (CC) quantum chemistry calculations on model cobalt oxide surface sites and use them to benchmark the accuracy of the most popular exchange and correlation functionals. Hybrid B3LYP and PBE0 functionals lead to fair agreement with the CC energies, while standard gradient-corrected functionals show important discrepancies. The inclusion of on-site electronic repulsion (DFT +U) substantially improves the calculated electronic and structural properties, but no value of the U parameter reproduces the CC results. We discuss the implications of these findings for amorphous cobalt phosphate nanoparticles, showing that the reactivity of these catalysts is not altered by surface phosphate groups.									37	1	0	0	2	0	37			1948-7185			WOS:000328920700006	26296169

Here, Mo2C nanosheets well-regulated in N-doped carbon (MCNS/NC) are facilely achieved by in situ confining carburization of a Mo-based inorganic-organic lamellar mesostructure at 900 degrees C, and demonstrated for the first time as an ultra-efficient and durable HER catalyst. The MCNS/NC displays a very low onset overpotential of similar to 0 mV and an overpotential of 19 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 28.9 mV dec(-1) in acid media, which is remarkably superior to most other transition metal-based catalysts and comparable to commercial Pt/C. The HER kinetics are further studied by EIS and Tafel slope analysis, suggesting the dominant Volmer-Tafel mechanism. An "outside-in" carburization mechanism for the evolution of MCNS/NC is proposed through detailed investigation of the samples annealed at different temperatures. This study highlights the importance of designing well-regulated functional nanostructures combined with a conductive carbonaceous matrix for versatile applications.									51	2	0	0	1	0	52			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000384531600017	27714037

Notothenioid fishes have at least 4 hepcidin variants, in 2 distinctive structural types. Type I hepcidins comprise 3 distinct variants that are homologs of the widespread 8-cysteine hepcidins. Type II is a novel 4-cysteine variant and therefore only 2 possible disulfide bonds, highly expressed in hematopoietic tissues. Analyses of d(N)/d(S) substitution rate ratios and likelihood ratio test under site-specific models detected significant signal of positive Darwinian selection on the mature hepcidin-coding sequence, suggesting adaptive evolution of notothenioid hepcidins. Genomic polymerase chain reaction and Southern hybridization showed that the novel type II hepcidin occurs exclusively in lineages of the Antarctic notothenioid radiation but not in the basal non-Antarctic taxa, and lineage-specific positive selection was detected on the branch leading to the type II hepcidin clade under branch-site models, suggesting adaptive evolution of the reduced cysteine variant in response to the polar environment. We also isolated a structurally distinct 4-cysteine (4cys) hepcidin from an Antarctic eelpout that is unrelated to the notothenioids but inhabits the same freezing water. Neighbor-Joining (NJ) analyses of teleost hepcidins showed that the eelpout 4cys variant arose independently from the notothenioid version, which lends support to adaptive evolution of reduced cysteine hepcidin variants on cold selection. The NJ tree also showed taxonomic-specific expansions of hepcidin variants, indicating that duplication and diversification of hepcidin genes play important roles in evolutionary response to diverse ecological conditions.									51	5	0	0	47	1	58			0737-4038	1537-1719		WOS:000255758200010	18310660

A pathway that avoids this problem would be the development of photocathodes for CO2 reduction that could then be coupled to a photoanodic oxygen evolution reaction. Here, we present the use of copper-substituted graphitic carbon nitride (Cu-CN) on a fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) electrode for the photoelectrochemical two-electron reduction of CO2 to CO as a major product (>95 %) and formic acid (<5 %). The results show that at a potential of -2.5 V versus Fc\Fc(+) the CO2 reduction activity of Cu-CN on FTO electrode improves by 25 % upon illumination by visible light with a faradaic efficiency of nearly 100 %. Independently, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy conclusively shows a pronounced increase in the electrical conductivity of the Cu-CN upon white light illumination under vacuum and a contactless measuring configuration. This photo-assisted charge mobility is shown to play a key role in the increased reactivity and faradaic efficiency for the reduction of CO2.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000678698700001	34278625

Formation of humic substances in the reaction of D-glucose with p-toluidine in anhydrous ethanol								IZVESTIYA VUZOV-PRIKLADNAYA KHIMIYA I BIOTEKHNOLOGIYA				10	2			188	195		10.21285/2227-2925-2020-10-2-188-195				2020	2020	The aim of the study was to investigate the processes of formation and structural group composition of the products formed during the reaction of D-glucose with p-toluidine in anhydrous ethanol using electronic and vibrational spectroscopy methods. The evolution of the profiles of the electronic spectra of working solutions shows the formation of a chromophore system: clear peaks at 380 and 440 nm are already present at a reaction time of 60 min. The appearance of an additional maximum at 520 nm (90, 120 min) likely corresponds to the formation of chromophores in condensed structures, as confirmed by a decrease in the values of the E-4/E-6 indices over time. The dynamics of the transformation of structural elements is also clearly seen in the analysis of IR spectra: as the reactions proceed, the CH aliphatic component of the structure decreases, while the aromatisation and functionalisation of products by chromophore groups increases. For products obtained between 90 and 120 min, a clear band at 1656 cm(-1), attributed to stretching vibrations of multiple bonds in conjugated C=C-C=O systems and azomethine fragments, indicates the of condensation reactions. In the spectra of insoluble solid products fractionated by water, the intensity of the bands at 1656 and 1190 cm(-1) is significantly reduced; this is possibly due to the transfer of some of the coloured low molecular weight products to the aqueous phase. A comparison of the IR Fourier transform spectra of the final solid products with the spectra of natural and synthetic humic-like substances indicates their similar structural group composition. The intensity of the bands at 1620, 1508 and 815 cm(-1) indicates a significant contribution of the aromatic component to the structure of the products of water-insoluble fractions; the water-soluble fractions mainly include aliphatic oxygen-containing structures resulting from the oxidative destruction of the initial carbohydrate. The synthesised products seem promising as convenient plant growth regulators with controlled release of the active substance.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2227-2925	2500-1558		WOS:000546996500002

CDH's ability to directly use polysaccharide derived mono-and oligosaccharides as substrates is a considerable advantage compared to other oxidases such as glucose oxidase which are limited to monosaccharides. However CDH's low activity with oxygen as electron acceptor hampers its industrial use for H2O2 production. A CDH variant with increased oxygen reactivity is therefore of high importance for biotechnological application. Uniform expression levels and an easy to use screening assay is a necessity to facilitate screening for CDH variants with increased oxygen turnover.Results: A uniform production and secretion of active Myriococcum thermophilum CDH was obtained by using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as expression host. It was found that the native secretory leader sequence of the cdh gene gives a 3 times higher expression than the prepro leader of the yeast a-mating factor. The homogeneity of the expression in 96-well deep-well plates was good (variation coefficient < 15%). A high-throughput screening assay was developed to explore saturation mutagenesis libraries of cdh for improved H2O2 production. A 4.5-fold increase for variant N700S over the parent enzyme was found. For production, N700S was expressed in P. pastoris and purified to homogeneity. Characterization revealed that not only the k(cat) for oxygen turnover was increased in N700S (4.5-fold), but also substrate turnover. A 3-fold increase of the k(cat) for cellobiose with alternative electron acceptors indicates that mutation N700S influences the oxidative-and reductive FAD half-reaction.Conclusions: Site-directed mutagenesis and directed evolution of CDH is simplified by the use of S. cerevisiae instead of the high-yield-host P. pastoris due to easier handling and higher transformation efficiencies with autonomous plasmids. Twelve clones which exhibited an increased H2O2 production in the subsequent screening were all found to carry the same amino acid exchange in the cdh gene (N700S). The sensitive location of the five targeted amino acid positions in the active site of CDH explains the high rate of variants with decreased or entirely abolished activity. The discovery of only one beneficial exchange indicates that a dehydrogenase's oxygen turnover is a complex phenomenon and the increase therefore not an easy target for protein engineering.									32	0	0	0	20	0	32				1475-2859		WOS:000318980500001	23617537

However, the spatial resolution of these studies has not yet matched the nanoscale SECM resolution attained without substrate illumination. Herein, we introduce nanoscale photo-SECM with a glass sealed, polished tip simultaneously serving as a nanoelectrode and a light guide to produce a microscopic light spot on the substrate surface. The advantages of this approach are demonstrated by comparing current transients obtained using through-tip and global illumination of the sample. The spot of light on the substrate surface facing the nanotip was sufficiently bright to measure diffusion-controlled positive feedback current in good agreement with the theory. We employed this approach for high-resolution photoelectrochemical mapping of ferrocenemethanol oxidation and oxygen evolution reactions at the Nb:TiO2 rutile (110) single crystal surface. The images obtained using 40-50 nm radius tips showed only minor and random variations in photoelectrochemical reactivity for both processes, pointing to essentially uniform distribution of the Nb dopant over the TiO2 surface and no measurable segregation on the similar to 50 nm scale.									16	1	0	0	2	0	16			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000491219900001	31560518

On the shape of stress corrosion cracks in sensitized Type 304 SS in Boiling Water Reactor primary coolant piping at 288degC								Journal of Nuclear Materials				454	1			359	72		10.1016/j.jnucmat.2014.08.022				Nov. 2014	2014	Evolution of the shape of surface cracks in sensitized Type 304 SS in Boiling Water Reactor primary coolant circuit piping at the reactor operating temperature of 288 degC is explored as a function of various environmental variables, such as electrochemical potential (ECP), solution conductivity, flow velocity, and multiplier for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) standard exchange current density (SECD), using the coupled environment fracture model (CEFM). For this work, the CEFM was upgraded by incorporating Shoji's model for calculating the crack tip strain rate and more advanced expressions were used for estimating the stress intensity factor for semi-elliptical surface cracks. This revised CEFM accurately predicts the dependence of the crack growth rate on stress intensity factor and offers an alternative explanation for the development of semi-elliptical cracks than that provided by fracture mechanics alone. The evolution of surface crack semi-elliptical shape depends strongly upon various environmental variables identified above, and the CEFM predicts that the minor axis of the ellipse should be oriented perpendicular to the surface, in agreement with observation. The development of the observed semi-elliptical cracks with the minor axis perpendicular to the surface is therefore attributed to the dependence of the crack growth rate on the electrochemical crack length.

CO2 corrosion of BCFN membrane was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transformed spectroscopy (DRIFT) and X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (XAFS). Cobalt (Co) K-edge absorption spectra of BCFN annealed in CO2 reveal that the oxidation states of Co in all the samples were larger than +3 and they decreased with the increase of calcination time. At 800 degrees C, 1% CO2 introduced into He could speed up the reduction of Co cations in comparison with pure He. In addition, sulfate ions in the bulk of BCFN membrane preferred to migrate to the surface under CO2 calcination and form monoclinic Ba(CO3)(0.9)(SO4)(0.1) besides orthorhombic witherite. Moreover, SEM results indicate that the nucleation and growth of carbonates grains started at the grain boundary of the membrane.									10	3	0	0	1	0	11			2095-4956			WOS:000342966300004

The crystalline phase changed from monoclinic hydrogen tetratitanate to an orthorhombic lepidocrocite-type hydrogen titanate by increasing the amount of Cu2+ doped. Both compounds could be excited by visible light irradiation (lambda>400 nm) and were capable of hydrogen gas evolution from an aqueous methanol solution, where the photocatalytic activity of Cu2+ doped hydrogen tetratitanate was slightly greater than that of Cu2+ doped lepidocrocite-type hydrogen titanate. The photocatalytic activity of Cu2+ doped hydrogen tetratitanate was enhanced by constructing Pt and TiO2 pillars in the interlayer, and the incorporation of Pt in Cu2+ doped hydrogen tetratitanate enabled the cleavage of water into hydrogen and oxygen by irradiating visible light (lambda>400 nm) without a sacrificial hole acceptor.

Herein, we report a highly active and stable anode material for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under mild-pH conditions based on cobalt oxide-nanoparticles embedded into a poly(pyrrole-alkylammonium) matrix (denoted as PPN+-CoOx). Examples of hybrid materials combining metal oxide nanoparticles as OER catalysts within a polymer film are still rare. However, they are very promising to control the formation and the size of metal particles in view of enhancing the electrochemically active surface area and thus the electrocatalytic performances. Our strategy consists in electroprecipitating Co-0 nanoparticles by the reduction of an anionic cobalt oxalate complex into a cationic PPN+ film, the latter being previously deposited onto an electrode surface by electropolymerization. The Co-0 nanoparticles within the composite are then partially in situ oxidized under air exposure to CoO, and then finally fully oxidized to CoOx by successive scans between 0 and 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl in a borate buffer at pH 9.2. This nanocomposite material is highly structured with around 30 nm-large CoOx nanoparticles well dispersed into the polypyrrole film conferring a high OER electrocatalytic activity at a near neutral pH of 9.2 with exceptional values of mass activity and turnover frequency of 3.01 A mg(-1) and 0.46 s(-1) respectively, at an overpotential of 0.61 V and with a cobalt loading of 1.34 mu g cm(-2). These performances place the PPN+-CoOx electrode among the most active anodes described in the literature employing cobalt oxide under mild pH conditions. In addition, when the PPN+-CoOx material is electrodeposited on carbon paper with a higher roughness than a simple carbon electrode, the physisorption of the film on the electrode is considerably enhanced resulting in a stable catalytic current for over more than 43 h. Post electrolysis characterization by SEM and EDX confirms the integrity of the PPN+-CoOx material after many hours of electrocatalysis. This demonstrates the beneficial role of the polypyrrole matrix in the achievement of very stable and highly active anodes for water oxidation.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2398-4902			WOS:000687269800001

Annales pharmaceutiques francaises				61	4			282	7						2003-Jul	2003	The stomach is an organ which is usually sterile and without lymphoid tissue. Its colonization by Helicobacter pylori leads to an important inflammatory response, gastritis. Polymorphs and macrophages are attracted and activated. Epithelial cells contribute to this innate response by the chemokines produced such as interleukin 8. The reaction observed is of Th1 type, probably inappropriate against an extra-cellular pathogen. The deleterious effect caused by oxygen free radicals is important. Two types of topographic evolution of the gastritis can be observed: antral gastritis which can lead to ulcer disease, and pangastritis which can lead to gastric carcinoma. In addition to host genetic factors, environmental factors and characteristics of the infecting strain can be involved. The maximum risk to develop a gastric cancer occurs for subjects harboring certain alleles of the interleukin 1B and H. pylori strains with the cag pathogenicity island.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0003-4509			MEDLINE:12843963	12843963

The overall mass loss rate (DTG curve) and the mass spectrometric intensities of ions H-2(+), CH3+, C2H2+, C2H3+, and C2H5+ were evaluated. The distributed activation energy model (DAEM) was employed, since it can mathematically represent the physical and chemical inhomogeneity of the charcoal. Some of the evaluated experimental curves consisted of 2-4 overlapping partial peaks. In those cases parallel reactions were assumed, and each reaction was described by a DAEM. The unknown parameters were determined by a simultaneous least-squares evaluation of a series of experiments. Parameters were identified that enabled the model to describe equally well the nonisothermal experiments and the experiments containing isothermal sections. Kinetic information was obtained on the drying and the evaporation of the organics trapped on the surface of the samples, the decomposition of the side groups with low thermal stability, the splitting-off of the more resistant side groups and the formation of the aromatic rings, and the elimination of heteroaromatic oxygen followed by the formation of polyaromatic structures during carbonization.									70	3	0	0	5	3	74			0887-0624			WOS:000175693900026

The performance of the system is studied under defined conditions (SoC, temperature) using a complex methodology including EIS, dynamic load curves, steady-state galvanostatic loads and galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles. The internal components of both devices are optimised with respect to performance and its stability. When compared to a standard vanadium-based negolyte, the AQDS-based fuel cell shows lower ohmic resistance and lower capacity fade due very slow AQDS permeation through the cation-exchange membrane. On the other hand, its open circuit voltage is approx. 0.48 V lower and the fuel cell shows higher overall resistance due to deteriorating performance of oxygen gas diffusion electrode, which is most probably related to the adsorption of the permeated AQDS on the platinum electro-catalyst. The method of performance restoration by applying opposite polarization to the fuel cell is successfully tested and optimised enabling stable battery operation.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000744249600003

The results of the potentiodynamic polarization experiment under cavitation condition showed that the corrosion current density increased with cavitation amplitude increase. Above oxygen evolution potential, the current density in a static condition was the largest because the anodic dissolution reaction by intergranular corrosion was promoted. In the static condition, intergranular corrosion was mainly observed. However, damage caused by erosion was observed in the cavitation environment. The micro-jet generated by cavity collapse destroyed the corrosion product and promoted the repassivation. So, weight loss occurred the most in static conditions. After the experiment, wave patterns were formed on the surface due to the compressive residual stress caused by the impact pressure of the cavity. Surface hardness was improved by the water cavitation peening effect, and the hardness value was the highest at 30 mu m amplitude. UNS N08367 with excellent mechanical performance due to its high hardness showed that cavitation inhibited corrosion damage.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1598-6462	2288-6524		WOS:000800655700005

In this work, an atomic scale 2D/2D Schottky heterojunction is prepared using titanium carbide as 2D platform for in situ growth of 2D ultrathin bismuth molybdate nanosheet through anaerobically hydrothermal conditions. This 2D/2D Schottky heterojunction displays high performance for MOA, which is 5.56-fold higher than pristine one. The excellent activation efficiency is originated from ultrahigh charge carrier transfer channel, in which the surface charge transfer efficiency is enhanced (30.73 % vs 18.45 %) and the surface recombination constant is decreased (0.0019 s(-1) vs 0.0031 s(-1)) compared to pristine one. The mechanism of photocatalytic MOA is unearthed based on experiment results and various characterizations. This study shows the great potential of atomic scale 2D/2D Schottky heterojunction in photocatalytic MOA.									102	1	0	0	44	0	102			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000517665200032

The sample generation-tip collection (SG-TC) mode of SECM shows limitations arising from complications connected with the reduction of Cl(2) at the SECM tip due to the presence of a significant amount of nondissolved Cl(2) gas. Because only dissolved Cl(2) can be electrochemically reduced at the tip, a large amount of the Cl(2) gas which is produced at active spots of the DSA is not detected. Additionally, a decrease of the cathodic current at the tip may Occur owing to the adhesion of gas bubbles and blocking of the electrode surface. To overcome this limitation, the redox competition mode of SECM was extended and applied to the local visualization of Cl(2) evolution from highly concentrated brine solutions. High concentrations of Cl(2) produced at the sample can cause inhibition of the same reaction at the tip by accumulation of Cl(2) in the proximity of the SECM tip. In this way the tip current is decreased, which can be used as a measure for the catalytic activity of the sample underneath the tip.									48	2	0	0	1	0	49			0003-2700			WOS:000295817500011	21875045

However, poor stability, caused by structure collapse and strong oxidants, prohibits further application of these catalysts. Therefore, the fabrication of stable and efficient water oxidation catalysts with robust structures and mild driving forces is in high demand. In this paper, we demonstrate the heterogeneous, porous and stable structure of Ir-doped metal organic frameworks (MOFs) by functionalizing bipyridine-incorporated MOFs with [IrCp*Cl(-Cl)](2) complexes. The resultant Ir-doped MOFs were immobilized on the surface of a glassy carbon electrode to drive the water oxidation process directly by electricity. Through the condition optimization, the enhanced electrocatalytic activity with an onset potential of 0.87 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) towards oxygen evolution reaction with the highest Faradaic efficiency of 99% could be obtained. Moreover, it maintains high activity with no apparent loss for at least 3600 s. The excellent electrochemical performance may be ascribed to the unique MOFs structure, which not only protects the molecular catalyst from collapse, but also facilitates uniform distribution of active sites and efficient electron transfer through the channel.									18	1	0	0	1	0	18			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000429025600028	29527609

Nano-micro letters				13	1			77	77		10.1007/s40820-021-00607-5				2021 Feb 19	2021	Developing highly effective and stable non-noble metal-based bifunctional catalyst working at high current density is an urgent issue for water electrolysis (WE). Herein, we prepare the N-doped graphene-decorated NiCo alloy coupled with mesoporous NiCoMoO nano-sheet grown on 3D nickel foam (NiCo@C-NiCoMoO/NF) for water splitting. NiCo@C-NiCoMoO/NF exhibits outstanding activity with low overpotentials for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (HER: 39/266mV; OER: 260/390mV) at±10 and±1000mAcm-2. More importantly, in 6.0M KOH solution at 60°C for WE, itonly requires 1.90V to reach 1000mAcm-2 and shows excellent stability for 43h, exhibiting the potential for actual application. The good performance can be assigned to N-doped graphene-decorated NiCo alloy and mesoporous NiCoMoO nano-sheet, which not only increase the intrinsic activity and expose abundant catalytic activity sites, but also enhance its chemical and mechanical stability. This work thus could provide a promising material for industrial hydrogen production.									15	4	0	0	0	0	17				2150-5551		MEDLINE:34138320	34138320

Herein, we have developed novel and environmentally friendly Fe/Ni@g-C3N4 nanocomposites for dual application in hydrodechlorination of trichloroethylene (TCE) and the consecutive oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). A homogeneous distribution of 2-3 nm Ni nanoparticles aligned onto the Fe-0 nanoparticles is observed to form bimetallic Fe/Ni nanocomposites. The decoration of Fe/Ni onto a few layers of lamellar g-C3N4 provides large surface area and accelerated electron transfer properties, resulting in the enhanced hydrodechlorination efficiency and rate of TCE. An 8-fold increase in the rate constant for TCE dechlorination by Fe/Ni@g-C3N4 is observed when the external voltage of -0.4 V is applied. Moreover, the generated iron oxides on the surface of Fe/Ni@g-C3N4 after the dechlorination exhibit superior electrocatalytic ORR activity with an electron transfer number of 3.9. In addition, the current density and onset potential of Fe/Ni@g-C3N4 are 3.6 mA cm(-2) and 0.84 V, respectively, which are close to those of standard Pt/C electrode materials. Results obtained in this work clearly demonstrate the excellence of Ni/Fe@g-C3N4 nanocomposites in consecutive applications to dechlorination and the ORR, which can open an avenue to design multifunctional metal@carbon nanocomposites as excellent electrochemical activity materials for water-energy nexus applications.									7	0	0	0	3	0	7			2051-8153	2051-8161		WOS:000590786100013

Their performance is established using electrochemical characterisation methods. Besides basic characterisation techniques such as voltammetry and chronoamperometry, employed in the dark or under illumination, more advanced techniques, including (photo-) electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, intensity-modulated impedance spectroscopy and transient absorption spectroscopy, can be used to evaluate key parameters and processes. For some of these techniques, data is often interpreted using over-simplified models, leading to the calculation of unreliable parameters. The values of the flat band potential and charge transfer efficiency depend heavily on the methods used to determine them, and it is recommended that the values are corroborated using multiple techniques. Lastly, certain 'efficiencies' defined in the literature for electrically biased systems should be revised.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2452-2236			WOS:000659958300008

However, the development of highly efficient photocatalysts for NRR still remains a grand challenge as a result of the sluggish activation of inert N-2, the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and inadequate photogenerated external potential, which usually cause extremely poor NRR performance and low light utilization efficiency. Herein, on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) computations, we rationally designed a series of two-dimensional (2D) pi-d conjugated metal-B3N3 (M3B6N6S12) semiconductors. Using the electron "sigma acceptance-pi* backdonation" process, Mo3B6N6S12 and Nb3B6N6S12 can efficiently activate and reduce N-2 to ammonia with a rather low overpotential of 0.07 and 0.21 V, respectively. Importantly, a high photogenerated external potential enables spontaneous NRR on Mo3B6N6S12 and Nb3B6N6S12 under visible/ infrared light irradiation, contributing to the extraordinary photoactivity of Mo3B6N6S12 and Nb3B6N6S12 as promising solar light-driven N-2 fixation catalysts. Meanwhile, the competing HER is effectively restrained. For the first time, we rationally propose a series of M3B6N6S12 semiconductors as promising metal-based photocatalysts for N-2 reduction with extraordinary photoactivity and a high photogenerated external potential. This work paves a new path for the rational designing of 2D metal-based NRR photocatalysts with high activity, good selectivity, and high stability.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000745908100001	35044767

Guided by the density functional theory calculation, the Nb doping can move up the Fermi energy level to the conduction band, thus enhancing the electronic conductivity. Meanwhile, the surface modification by Ni/Co alloy can moderate the surface M-H affinity, which will further enhance the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. A series of Ni/Co alloy attached on Nb-doped Ti3C2Tx MXene nanohybrids (denoted as NiCo@NTM) are successfully prepared. As expected, the Ni0.9Co0.1@NTM nanohybrids present an extraordinary HER activity in alkaline solution, which only needs an overpotential (eta) of 43.4 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution and shows good stability. The performance of the Ni0.9Co0.1@NTM nanohybrids is comparable to the commercial 10% Pt/C electrode (34.4 mV@10 mA cm(-2)) and is better than most state-of-the-art Pt free HER catalysts. Inspired by the facile synthesis process and chemical versatility of both MXene and transition metal alloys, the nanohybrids reported here are promising non-noble metal electrocatalysts for water-alkali electrolysis.									59	5	0	0	1	0	59				2198-3844		WOS:000470189500006	31179219

Apart from reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced in endogenous reactions, parasites are usually exposed to high ROS concentrations imposed by the host immune system. The glutathione and thioredoxin systems represent the two major antioxidant defence lines in most eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Trypanosomatids, however, are characterized by their unique trypanothione system. These systems are NADPH-dependent and based on the catalytic activity of the flavoenzymes glutathione reductase, trypanothione reductase and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), respectively. TrxR reduces the 12-kDa protein thioredoxin (Trx), which in turn provides electrons to ribonucleotide reductase, thioredoxin peroxidases (TPxs), certain transcription factors and other target molecules. Comparing the thioredoxin systems of different parasites and their respective host cells enhances our understanding of parasite biology and evolution, of parasite-host interactions and mechanisms of drug resistance. It furthermore opens avenues for the development of novel antiparasitic compounds. Here we review the current knowledge on the Trx systems of eukaryotic parasites, finally focusing on the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum.									58	0	0	0	54	1	61			1420-682X	1420-9071		WOS:000176982900008	12169015	
J	Cheng, Jun; Zhang, Bo; Dai, Tingkai; Liu, Hong								Effects of jet/flame interaction on deflagration-to-detonation transition by non-reactive gas jet in a methane-oxygen mixture								AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				126						107581	10.1016/j.ast.2022.107581				JUL 2022	2022	Jet-in-crossflow (JICF) is a potential and reliable technique that can promote flame acceleration and deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT). Most of the previous researches utilized combustible mixture or oxygen as the medium of JICF, therefore the detonation enhancement effect may be partly attributed to the chemical properties of the jet, and the purely turbulent effect induced by JICF on DDT has not been fully understood. In our previous work, the non-reactive gas jet affected flame propagation indirectly by separating the injection and ignition in the control sequence. A competing mechanism between the positive combustion-enhancement effect caused by jet-induced turbulence and the negative non-reactive gas-inhibition effect on combustion has not been found, the non-reactive gas jet with high pressure and short duration time was also verified to be beneficial for precursor shock wave formation and flame acceleration. However, no detonation was observed in the work. In this paper, the non-reactive jet interacts with the flame propagation directly by overlapping the working time of the jet and ignitor partly, and the effect of jet parameters including injection pressure and time delay on DDT is investigated systematically. The results show that the flame affected by the non-reactive gas jet with a high-pressure ratio and a short time delay can transit to detonation in a short run-up distance successfully. The schlieren images of the flame evolution process illustrate that the flame interacted by the jet experiences four states: layered flame, wrinkled flame, cellular flamelets, and turbulent flame. Kelvin-Helmholtz (K -H) instability and Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T) instability dominate in the flame distortion. The characteristic timescales of the flow and reaction are computed in the four flame states, turning out that as the flame evolving, the turbulent intensity of the flame is enhanced. Damkohler number (Da) on the flame front eventually converges to [1,2] demonstrates the characteristic timescales of the turbulence and reaction are on the same order, and the turbulence dominates the flame evolution.

Temporal Development of Ozone Generation in Electron-Induced Corona-Discharge Plasma								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PLASMA SCIENCE				39	11			3168	3172		10.1109/TPS.2011.2166980				NOV 2011	2011	Ozone (O(3)) generation and its temporal development to steady state are investigated in a precise model using all high-rate reactions for various conditions of gas pressure (P), electron density (n(e)), and temperature (T) of an evolving electron-induced O(2) corona plasma. Densities of O and (O(3)) radicals are determined from their gross formation and destruction. Net (O(3)) density so attained in steady state at T = 300 K is over 10(25) m(-3) for P similar to bar and n(e) similar to 10(15) m(-3). However, net O density for the same is lower similar to 10(20) m(-3) even though O density exceeded (O(3)) density in early times of formation. It is shown that (O(3)) density reduced with temperature heated by discharge in corona, while O density reduced with T up to 500 K and thereafter increased to similar to 10(21) m(-3) with still higher T. Both O and (O(3)) densities varied proportional to the electron density enhanced by avalanche in corona. (O(3)) varied proportional to pressure, and O exhibited swing to inverse proportionality with larger P.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0093-3813			WOS:000298079400002

The anode process was investigated via anodic polarization curves, cyclic voltammetry curves, electrochemical impedance spectra, and corrosion tests. The microscopic morphology and phase composition of the anodic oxide layers were observed by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, respectively. Observable variations in the electrocatalytic activity and reaction kinetics of anodes during electrowinning indicated that the electrochemical behavior of the anodes was strongly affected by the rolling technology. An increase in the rolling number tended to decrease the oxygen evolution overpotential and the corrosion rate of the anodes. These trends are contrary to that of the apparent exchange current density. Furthermore, the intensities of diffraction peaks associated with PbO, PbOx, and alpha-PbO2 tended to increase with increasing rolling number. In addition, the rolled anodes exhibited a more uniform microstructure. Compared with one-way rolled anodes, the eight-time cross rolled anodes exhibited better electrocatalytic activity and improved corrosion resistance.									4	3	0	0	0	0	7			1674-4799	1869-103X		WOS:000364575500011

Atomic clusters-based catalysts show high efficiency of atom utilization and high performance toward electrocatalysis. Herein, an environmentally friendly preparation strategy is proposed to construct Pt atomic clusters on the polyoxometalates-carbon black (Pt-POMsCB) support. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the Pt clusters can be stably anchored on the surface with the driving force arising from the charge transfer from Pt atoms to O atoms of the POMs. Benefiting from metal-support interaction, Pt atomic clusters embedded in silicotungstic acid-carbon black (Pt-STA-CB) exhibit excellent HER activity with an overpotential of 33.8 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and high mass activity is 1.62 A mg(-1) (Pt) at 33.8 mV, which is 5.4 times that of the commercial Pt/C. In addition, the catalyst displays high stability of 800 h at current density of 500 mA cm(-2). It provides a platform for facile and low-cost preparation of stable Pt-based catalysts, which is crucial for their large-scale production and practical application in the industry.

Of special relevance due to environmental and practical reasons is the production of 2D materials in aqueous medium, which generally requires the use of certain additives (surfactants and other types of dispersants) to assist in the exfoliation and colloidal stabilization processes. In this context, biomolecules have received, in recent years, increasing attention as dispersants for 2D materials, as they provide a number of advantages over more conventional, synthetic surfactants. Here, we review research progress in the use of biomolecules as exfoliating and dispersing agents for the production of 2D materials. Although most efforts in this area have focused on graphene, significant advances have also been reported with transition metal dichalcogenides (MoS2, WS2, etc.) or hexagonal boron nitride. Particular emphasis is placed on the specific merits of different types of biomolecules, including proteins and peptides, nucleotides and nucleic acids (RNA, DNA), polysaccharides, plant extracts and bile salts, on their role as efficient colloidal dispersants of 2D materials, as well as on the potential applications that have been explored for such biomolecule-exfoliated materials. These applications are wide-ranging and encompass the fields of biomedicine (photothermal and photodynamic therapy, bioimaging, biosensing, etc.), energy storage (Li- and Na-ion batteries), catalysis (e.g., catalyst supports for the oxygen reduction reaction or electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction), or composite materials. As an incipient area of research, a number of knowledge gaps, unresolved issues and novel future directions remain to be addressed for biomolecule-exfoliated 2D materials, which will be discussed in the last part of this review.									106	3	0	0	19	0	107			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000382053300002	27518874

The presence of sp(1) linear carbon chains is revealed by a large structured band with a main peak at nearly 2100 cm(-1) and a shoulder at 1980 cm(-1), assigned to polyyne (alternating single-triple bonds) and polycumulene (double bonds) moietes respectively. The stability of these species has been analysed following the temporal evolution of the characteristic sp(1) Raman band intensity under exposure to several gases (He, N(2), H(2) and dry air). The carbynoid species appear to be very reactive to oxygen-rich environment, whereas the effects of other gases are less destructive. Actually, exposure to oxygen reveals different decay mechanisms with respect to other gases. The thermal stability in ultra high vacuum has been also studied up to 200 degreesC. We observe different decay kinetics as a function of annealing temperature, showing thresholds in the chain stability. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We observe release kinetics with half-times of similar to 0.85 and similar to 145 ms for thylakoids and PSII membranes, respectively, which are in close agreement with the EPR determined Y-z decay kinetics for the S-3 --> --> S-0 transition in these systems. The results show conclusively that water-oxygen chemistry is not a rate-limiting step in the donor side of PSII under normal turnover conditions. By analyzing the oxygen release kinetics in thylakoids under nonphysiological, but still functionally competent conditions (low pH or high salt), we observed an initial delay in the O-2 release of up to 200 mu s following flash turnover from the; S-3 state. This is the first direct indication of a probable quasi-stable intermediate in the S-3 --> --> S-0 turnover of PSII, possibly representing the putative S-4 state. Under conditions more closely approaching physiological, no such delay was resolved, indicating that the S-4 --> O-2 transition occurs within 50 mu s under such circumstances. Two possible reaction sequences for O-2 formation consistent: with these and other data are discussed. It is suggested that the more probable form of "S-4" is in fact the S-3 + Y-z(.) combination, which must undergo some molecular rearrangement on the tens to hundreds of microseconds time scale before O-2 formation chemistry occurs.									78	1	0	0	51	0	78			0006-2960			WOS:000078836500012	9930985

However, due to limited light absorption capacity, a high photogenerated charge carrier recombination rate, and sluggish surface oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetic on the surface, the photocurrent density generated by bare hematite is lower than the theoretical value. To overcome these limitations, we fabricate hematite photoanodes with a dual metal-organic framework (MIL-88B@ZIF-67) coating, which greatly enhances light harvesting efficiency and the intrinsic charge carrier transport rate. Owing to these spectacular advantages, the optimized Fe2O3/MIL-88B@ZIF-67 photoanode affords a stable photocurrent density of 2.52 mA.cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under one sun irradiation. The photocurrent density is signif-icantly higher than that achieved with a bare Fe2O3 photoanode (0.27 mA.cm(-2)). Most importantly, the cathodic shift of the Fe2O3/MIL-88B@ZIF-67 photoanode (119 mV) is larger than that of pristine Fe2O3. The measured incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency of the Fe2O3/MIL-88B@ZIF-67 photoanode reaches 30.85% at 330 nm. A photocurrent decay of only 5% over 20 h indicates that the photoanode is also extraordinarily stable. We find that it is crucial to precisely control the number of MIL-88B@ZIF-67 coating layers to reduce the charge carrier recombination rate. We expect that our approach will be effective for the design of efficient and stable photoanodes for PEC water splitting. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Some cyanobacteria contain two natural isoforms of D1 that function better under low light (D1:1) or high light (D1:2). Herein, rates and yields of photoassembly of the Mn4CaO5 water-oxidizing complex (WOC) from the free inorganic cofactors (Mn2+, Ca2+, water, electron acceptor) and apo-WOC-PSII are shown to differ significantly: D1:1 apo-WOC-PSII exhibits a 2.3-fold faster rate-limiting step of photoassembly and up to seven-fold faster rate to the first light-stable Mn3+ intermediate, IM1*, but with a much higher rate of photoinhibition than D1:2. Conversely, D1:2 apo-WOC-PSII assembles slower but has up to seven-fold higher yield, achieved by a higher quantum yield of charge separation and slower photoinhibition rate. These results confirm and extend previous observations of the two holoenzymes: D1:2-PSII has a greater quantum yield of primary charge separation, faster [P-680 (+) Q (A) (-) ] charge recombination and less photoinhibition that results in a slower rate and higher yield of photoassembly of its apo-WOC-PSII complex. In contrast, D1:1-PSII has a lower quantum yield of primary charge separation, a slower [P-680 (+) Q (A) (-) ] charge recombination rate, and faster photoinhibition that together result in higher rate but lower yield of photoassembly at higher light intensities. Cyanobacterial PSII reaction centers that contain the high- and low-light D1 isoforms can tailor performance to optimize photosynthesis at varying light conditions, with similar consequences on their photoassembly kinetics and yield. These different efficiencies of photoassembly versus photoinhibition impose differential costs for biosynthesis as a function of light intensity.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000374593600004	26687161

The spinel high-entropy oxide (HEO) electrodes were fabricated through soft-templating followed by a rapid heating step to 600 degrees C to achieve mesoporosity. Dense and mesoporous thin films were systematically investigated regarding their physicochemical and (photo-) electrochemical properties. The HEO electrodes were structurally characterized by means of X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy together with elemental mapping verifying the formed spinel structure and the homogeneous distribution of cations. Scanning electron and atomic force microscopy proved a mesostructured surface morphology offering a highly accessible mesoporous network. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies provided-for the first time-detailed information about the electronic structure of the spinel HEO thin films proposing p-type conductivity. Analyzed as a photoelectrode for solar water reduction in alkaline media, the HEO samples showed only small cathodic photocurrents. Evaluating the mesoporous HEO as an oxygen evolution catalyst, overpotentials of 390 and 350 mV were found at jgeo = 10 mA/cm2 for the dense and mesoporous HEOs, respectively. Taking the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) into account, the improved catalytic activity of the mesoporous HEO was predominantly assigned to the substantially increased number of catalytically active sites.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2574-0962			WOS:000743730100001

Solid state C-13 and N-15 CP-MAS NMR spectra of the POP showed evidences for the presence of the three moieties in varying composition. Raman analysis of the carbonized samples exhibited varying degrees of graphitization and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis showed patterns corresponding to N-doped amorphous carbon. Surface morphological characteristics obtained from SEM and TEM analysis confirm different morphologies with slight variations in the particle size and porosity. Further, the electrocatalytic activities of the prepared metal free catalysts were evaluated. Sample carbonized at 700 degrees C (PPT-700) showed excellent catalytic activity towards electrocarboxylation of 4-bromoacetophenone in 0.1 M TBABF(4)/DMF and OER in 1 M KOH as indicated by their onset potential and current density, whereas the sample calcined at 900 degrees C (PPT-900) exhibited excellent HER activity in 1 M H2SO4. The catalytic activity of PPT-700 towards electrocarboxylation and OER activity is ascribed to the presence of pyridinic, pyrrolic and quaternary nitrogen's, whereas the presence of pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen's are responsible for the enhanced HER activity of PPT-900 sample as evident from XPS.

Accurately regulating the electronic structure of these nanohybrids to reveal the underlying mechanism for enhanced HER performances is still challenging and thus requires deep excavation. Herein, a series of pomegranate-like NixSey@NC core-shell nanohybrids (including Ni0.85Se @ NC, NiSe2@NC, and NiSe@NC) through controllable selenization of a Ni-MOF precursor is reported. The component of the nanohybrids can be fine-tuned by tailoring the selenization temperature and feed ratio, through which the electronic structure can be synchronously regulated. Among these nanohybrids, the Ni0.85Se @ NC exhibits the optimum pH-universal HER performance with overpotentials of 131, 135, and 183 mV in 0.5mH(2)SO(4), 1.0mKOH, and 1.0mPBS, respectively, at 10 mA cm(-2), which are attributed to the increased partial density of state at the Fermi level and effective van der Waals interactions between Ni0.85Se and NC matrix explained by density functional theory calculations.									31	1	0	0	2	0	31			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000578748600001	33048466

In the superparamagnetic size regime, the moments of nanoparticles fluctuate as a result of thermal energy. To understand the fundamental behavior of superparamagnetism and develop relevant potential applications, various preparation routes have been explored to produce MNMs with desired properties and structures. However, some challenges remain for the preparation of well-defined magnetic nanostructures, including exchange-coupled nanomagnets, which are considered as the next generation of advanced magnets. In such a case, effective synthetic methods are required to achieve control over the chemical composition, size, and structure of MNMs. For instance, liquid-phase chemical syntheses, a set of emerging approaches to prepare various magnetic nanostructures, facilitate precise control over the nucleation and specific growth processes of nanomaterials with diverse structures. Among them, the high-temperature organic-phase method is an indispensable one in which the microstructures and physical/chemical properties of MNMs can be tuned by controlling the reaction conditions such as precursor, surfactant, or solvent amounts, reaction temperature or time, reaction atmosphere, etc. In this Account, we present an overview of our progress on the chemical synthesis of various MNMs, including monocomponent nanostructures (e.g., metals, metal alloys, metal oxides/carbides) and multicomponent nanostructures (heterostructures and exchange-coupled nanomagnets). We emphasize the high-temperature organic-phase synthetic method, on which we have been focused over the past decade. Notably, multicomponent nanostructures, obtained by growing or incorporating different functional components together, not only retain the functionalities of each single component but also possess synergic properties that emerge from interfacial coupling, with improved magnetic, optical, or catalytic features. Herein, potential applications of MNMs are covered in three representative areas: biomedicine, catalysis, and environmental purification. Regarding biomedicine, MNMs can detect or target biological entities after being modified with specific biomolecules, and they can be applied to magnetic resonance imaging, imaging-guided drug delivery, and photothermal therapy. Apart from their magnetic features, the catalytic performance of some MNMs resulting from their highly specific chemical components and surface structure will be briefly introduced, highlighting its impact in the methanol oxidation reaction, the oxygen reduction reaction, the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, and the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Finally, environmental purification, primarily for water remediation, will be highlighted with two main aspects: the effective capture of bacteria and the removal of adverse ions in wastewater.We hope that this Account will clarify the progress on the controllable preparation of MNMs with specific compositions, sizes, and structures and generate broad interest in the realms of biomedicine and catalysis as well as in environmental issues and other potential applications.									168	15	1	0	19	0	171			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000426014500022	29412634

Buried-junction np+-Si(111) photoanodes with an 18.0% filling fraction of a square array of Ni microelectrodes, np+Si( 111)| NimE18.0%, demonstrated performance equivalent to a Ni anode in series with a photovoltaic device having an open-circuit voltage of 538 20 mV, a short-circuit current density of 20.4 1.3 mA cm 2, and a photovoltaic efficiency of 6.7 0.9%. For the np+-Si(111)| NimE18.0% samples, the photocurrent density at the equilibrium potential for oxygen evolution was 12.7 0.9 mA cm 2, yielding an ideal regenerative cell solar-to-oxygen conversion efficiency of 0.47 0.07%. The photocurrent passed exclusively through the Ni catalyst islands to evolve O2 with nearly 100% faradaic efficiency, while a passivating, insulating surface layer of SiOx formed in situ on areas of the Si in direct contact with the electrolyte. The (photo) electrochemical behavior of Si electrodes patterned with varying areal filling fractions of Ni catalyst islands was also investigated. The stability and efficiency of the patterned-catalyst Si electrodes were affected by the filling fraction of the Ni catalyst, the orientation and dopant type of the substrates, and the measurement conditions. The electrochemical behavior at different stages of operation, including Ni catalyst activation, Si passivation, stable operation, and device failure, was affected by the dynamic processes of anodic formation and isotropic dissolution of SiOx on the exposed Si. Ex situ and operando microscopic and spectroscopic studies revealed that these processes were three-dimensional and spatially non-uniform across the surface of the substrate, and occurred near the active catalyst islands. The patterned catalyst/substrate electrodes serve as a model system for accelerated studies of failure mechanisms in photoanodes protected by multifunctional catalytic coatings or other hole-conductive thin-film coatings that contain defects.									22	1	0	0	0	0	22			2398-4902			WOS:000431422700008

Herein, we first develop a novel, simple, rapid, and environmentally friendly plasma-induced transformation approach to in situ engineer MOF-derived heterointerface catalyst. The plasma engineered MOF-derived Co4N-Co3O4-C has a well-defined interface structure and exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic performance for alkaline hydrogen evolution with a very low overpotential of 46 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Theory calculation verifies that the formation of heterointerface induces electron redistribution mainly in the interface region, particularly to the side of Co4N, triggering interface Co as active sites, in which there is stronger water capture capability, decreasing the energetic barrier of water dissociation, and optimal hydrogen absorption. This work presents a feasible and ingenious strategy to design and synthesize diverse electrocatalysts with MOF-derived heterointerface.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000755186600001

Substantial increase in photocurrent density, i.e., from 1.13 mA/cm2 to 1.66 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) was observed when the optimized Cu2O layer was applied to the bare TiO2 photoanode. Moreover, the highest photocurrent density, i.e., 1.94 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V vs RHE was obtained when the surface of the TiO2Cu2O heterojunction photoanode was further modified using a cobalt-phosphate co-catalyst. The remarkable performance of the p-n heterojunction structure photoanode was mainly attributed to improved light harvesting in the visible region and improved charge dynamics due to the band alignment between TiO2 and Cu2O.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000723218700002

Bifunctional air electrodes employing a La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 perovskite catalyst for O2reduction and O2- evolution are manufactured in small scale ( 4 cm2) and in up- scaled sizes ( 50- 55 cm2) and tested in unit cell configuration with flowing electrolyte. Stable operation of 1000 h is achieved in the small set- up with an overall 1800 h of operation over 700 cycles at high voltage efficiencies of > 50% ( air electrode) at 50 mAcm 2. The up- scaled flow cell reaches nearly the same performance for 320 h and 130 h, respectively, proving the successful scale- up. Slowly decreasing hydrophobicity is found to be the main reason of initially increasing but then decreasing performance. This is confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Although many problems are suppressed with flowing electrolyte, zinc morphology proves to be the major challenge especially in larger cells in long- term operation of a few hundred hours.									4	1	0	0	1	0	5				2566-6223		WOS:000477087800012

The enzyme consists of two subunits, 64 and 30 kD; pI = 4.5. The optimal pH was 8.5-9.5 for hydrogen uptake and 4.0 for H-2 evolution. Hydrogenase preparations were resistant to the effects of O-2, CO, and temperature, revealing high stability under storage. A considerable inactivation of the enzyme was observed at temperatures above 80degreesC; the temperature optimum of methyl viologen reduction by H-2 was 85degreesC. Inhibitory effects of Ni2+, Cd2+, and Mg2+ on the hydrogenase activity were shown to be reversible and competitive with respect to methyl viologen in the hydrogen oxidation reaction.									9	0	0	0	5	0	10			0006-2979	1608-3040		WOS:000220754400006	15000682

ZnRh2O4/Ag/Bi4V2O11 was able to photocatalyze overall pure-water splitting under red-light irradiation with a wavelength of 700 nm. On the basis of the analogy with a solid-state heterojunction photocatalyst composed of ZnRh2O4, defective silver antimonate (Ag1-xSbO3-y), and Ag (R. Kobayashi et al., J. Phys. Chem. C, 2014, 118, 22450-22456), we consider that the overall water-splitting performance of the ZnRh2O4/Ag/Bi4V2O11 photocatalyst was derived from the photoproduced holes that were generated in the valence band (VB) of Bi4V2O11 contributing to O2 liberation and the photoexcited electrons that were generated in the conduction band (CB) of ZnRh2O4 contributing to H-2 liberation. Importantly, Ag possibly acts as a solid-state electron mediator for the transfer of electrons from the CB of Bi4V2O11 to the VB of ZnRh2O4.									26	1	0	0	0	0	26			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000371077300033

Carbon steel is used as a container material because of the low possibility of local corrosion in bentonite. However, after the storage is closed, the decrease of oxygen content will create a near-field environment where the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) in the corrosion process of the container could happen. To evaluate the safety of containers in deep geological disposal of Beshai, the preselected area in China, hydrogen permeation efficiency and HE were estimated in highly pressed saturated bentonite by electrochemical and extrapolation analyses. It is concluded that hydrogen permeation efficiency increases with the disposal year, which proves that the hydrogen evolution reaction dominates the cathode process in the corrosion during long-term disposal. However, slow strain rate tensile shows that Q235 steel has a low HE sensitivity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2296-8016			WOS:000779125000001

All the composite photocatalysts exhibited a more excellent photocatalytic performance than bare CeO2 and ZIS, and reached the highest with a CH3OH evolution rate of 0.542 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) when the content of CeO2 was 5 wt%. In the composites, the CeO2 with oxygen vacancies acted as a significant cocatalyst to efficiently trap the photogenerated electrons from ZIS and thus boosted the separation of photoinduced charge carriers, while the unique 3D structure of ZIS made it with a relatively large specific area, which could provide abundant active reaction sites and render the reactants and products diffuse more easily. This study verified the CeO2 as one of the ideal cocatalyst candidates for ZnIn2S4 in the application of photocatalytic CO2 reduction, and gave rise to an increasing interest in expanding potential applications of ZnIn2S4 based materials in the field of energy conversion.					3rd International Symposium on Energy and Environmental Photocatalytic Materials (EEPM3)3rd International Symposium on Energy and Environmental Photocatalytic Materials (EEPM3)	MAY 15-19, 2018MAY 15-19, 2018		Jagiellonian Univ, Fac Chem, Krakow, POLANDJagiellonian Univ, Fac Chem, Krakow, POLAND	101	8	0	0	8	0	102			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000447744200047

Non-hyperbolic kinetics were observed and Hill coefficients in the 037-1.00 range were obtained. The catalytic constants and the Hill coefficients were found to be quantitatively correlated with two independent variables: the energy level of the highest-occupied molecular orbital (E-HOMO), which describes the intrinsic redox activity of the substrates and the pK(a)-values, which are related to substrate ionization. Oxygen evolution in the presence of each phenol derivative was also measured, and good correlation between peroxidase-like and catalase-like activities of the protein was observed. It is also shown that bovine metHb, although less active than other peroxidases, may represent a good alternative from an economical point of view for phenol removal processes. The equations here obtained may serve as a basis to further explore the potential use of metHb-mediated reactions in the treatment of phenols in wastewaters and to predict which phenol will be removed most efficiently under this treatment with satisfactory reliability.

SEM and EDS reveal that the existence of the G/A composite prevents the electrode from pulverizing and oxidizing. The oxygen content in the surface of the electrode is reduced from 21% to 10% after 50 cycles for a Mg-Ni-La electrode with 0.2 mass fraction of G/A. The crystallization process of the amorphous electrodes coated by G/A is reduced compared to the uncoated electrode and the stable Mg2NiH4, alpha-Mg, MgH2 and La oxihydroxide phases are present with the grain size about 40-60 nm after 50 charge/discharge cycles. The G/A coating reduces the corrosion and oxidation of the electrode alloy and provides both a pathway for hydrogen diffusion and active sites for the redox reaction of hydrogen. All of these factors result in a significant improvement of the discharge capacity by about 200 mAh g(-1) in each cycle (after activation) for Mg-Ni-La electrodes with 0.2 mass fraction of G/A nanocomposites.

While CO oxidation has been investigated for such systems in model studies, the added influence of hydrogen gas, representative of PROX, remains less explored. Herein, we use ambient pressure scanning tunneling microscopy and ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy on a CoOx/Pt(111) planar model catalyst to analyze the active phase and the adsorbed species at the CoOx/Pt(111) interface under atmospheres of CO and O-2 with a varying partial pressure of H-2 gas. By following the evolution of the Co oxidation state as the catalyst is brought to a reaction temperature of above 150 degrees C, we determine that the active state is characterized by the transformation from planar CoO with Co in the 2+ state to a mixed Co2+/Co3+ phase at the temperature where CO2 production is first observed. Furthermore, our spectroscopy observations of the surface species suggest a reaction pathway for CO oxidation, proceeding from CO exclusively adsorbed on Co2+ sites reacting with the lattice O from the oxide. Under steady state CO oxidation conditions (CO/O-2), the mixed oxide phase is replenished from oxygen incorporating into cobalt oxide nanoislands. In CO/O-2/H-2, however, the onset of the active Co2+/Co3+ phase formation is surprisingly sensitive to the H-2 pressure, which we explain by the formation of several possible hydroxylated intermediate phases that expose both Co2+ and Co3+. This variation, however, has no influence on the temperature where CO oxidation is observed. Our study points to the general importance of a dynamic reducibility window of cobalt oxide, which is influenced by hydroxylation, and the bonding strength of CO to the reduced oxide phase as important parameters for the activity of the system.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000779733300001	35388844

EFFECT OF OXYGEN CURING ON PROPERTIES OF EX-PCSZ MONOFILAMENTS								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE				28	10			2632	2638		10.1007/BF00356197				MAY 15 1993	1993	Si-C-N-O monofilaments were spun from a molten new polycarbosilazane (PCSZ) precursor, cured under oxygen within the temperature range 90-230-degrees-C and submitted to a pyrolysis treatment in argon up to 1600-degrees-C. The curing step was studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)and infrared (i.r.) analysis. The effect of the curing conditions on the weight loss, composition, structure and tensile properties was characterized after pyrolysis. The main reaction occurring during the curing step is the oxidation of Si-H bonds. The mechanical characteristics after pyrolysis have maximum values (sigma(R) = 1850 M Pa and E = 185 G Pa) for a curing temperature theta(R) = 140-degrees-C, corresponding to an oxygen atomic concentration of 12%. The lowering of sigma(R) and E observed when theta(R) not-equal 140-degrees-C could be due to: (i) a tendency of the monofilaments to stick to one another during pyrolysis (theta(R) < 140-degrees-C) and (ii) the evolution of gaseous oxygen-containing species during pyrolysis as well as an increase in Si-O bonds (theta(R) > 140-degrees-C). The Si-C-N-O monofilaments remain amorphous up to 1400-degrees-C whatever their oxygen concentration is.									18	1	0	0	0	0	19			0022-2461			WOS:A1993LE39600006

The results show that the rate and quantity of oxygen storage/release capacity are greatly enhanced by Pd support, showing a more prominent CO2 slope gradient and CO2 reduction peak than that of Ce0.67Zr0.33.O-2 The existence of Pd-(Ce,Zr)Ox (interface between Pd and ceria-zirconia mixed oxides) interaction is confirmed to be important for oxygen reduction. During the CO-He pulse, acceleration of oxygen reduction by Pd promotion is limited by the reducibility of the whole system. At low reducibility; Pd-(Ce,Zr)Ox interaction is evident for OSC. Conversely, when the reducibility reaches above 12%, Pd-(Ce,Zr)Ox interaction is less effective, ascribed to the bulk oxygen migration in ceria-zirconia becoming the rate-determining step of the reduction process., The experiments with dynamic pulses of CO-O-2 reveal that dynamic oxygen storage capacity (DOSC) is closely affected by the temperature range; DOSC is greatly affected by Pd-(Ce,Zr)Ox at low temperature. Considering the effect of Pd deterioration and ceria-zirconia sintering on OSC, after hydrothermal aging at high temperature, no significant difference is related to support sintering. Additionally, deteriorated Pd sites are more effective in decreasing OSC. Pd site evolution under hydrothermal aging may be dominated by Pd sintering, rather than by Pd encapsulation. By calculating the CO2 production rate, Arrhenius plots are suggested to show that the apparent activation energy increased by Pd site deterioration, rather than by sintering of ceria-zirconia.									20	2	0	0	1	1	20			0888-5885			WOS:000250931400004

Employing state-of-the-art DFT calculations and a statistical mechanical approach, we investigated the incorporation of Bi into AgSbO3 to form a AgSb1-xBixO3 solid-solution for tuning the band gap to the optimum (around 2.0 eV) for the photocatalysis of water splitting under sunlight. A phase transition from the pyrochlore to ilmenite phase was predicted at x approximate to 0.21. The band gap decreases almost linearly with increasing Bi concentration for each phase. The decreased band gap is attributed to the lower energy of the Bi s-O p antibonding orbitals than that of the Sb s-O p antibonding orbitals in the conduction bands. Excitingly, a band gap of around 2.0 eV was obtained at x = 0.1875. The combination of a strong oxidizing potential and an optimal band gap for solar light absorption makes the pyrochlore AgSb0.8125Bi0.1875O3 solid-solution a promising candidate for the production of oxygen in a Z-scheme water-splitting system.									17	1	0	0	3	0	17			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000356372300007

Herein, we achieve significantly improved Li-ion diffusion kinetics and reversibility of Li2O in a MoO2 anode by elaborately constructing oxygen vacancies and atomic-level spatial distribution of a Ni catalyst, therefore evidently boosting its rate behavior and initial CE. The oxygen vacancy and highly distributed metallic Ni modulation is achieved by finely controlling the annealing time. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the creation of oxygen vacancies results in unbalanced charge distribution within MoO2, thus inducing a foreign coulomb force to boost the Li-ion transfer. Furthermore, the metallic Ni in Ni/MoO2-delta can perform as an effective catalyst to ensure the fully reversible conversion of the as-formed Li2O, thereby increasing the initial CE. Benefiting from this multiscale coordinated design, Ni/MoO2-delta displays high discharge capacity (1630.9 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1)), large initial CE (83.7%), and excellent rate capability, and outperforms most of the previously reported MoO2-based anodes. Such a design concept not only brings MoO2 one big step closer to practical application, but also can be extended to guide the design of other anode materials with high theoretical capacity.									27	2	0	0	0	0	27			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000476913600038

In dense molecular cloud models, at a later stage of the evolution, the O2 molecule may become a substantial grain mantle constituent, at the expense of the water ice abundance. Since infrared dipole vibrational transitions for the homonuclear diatomic molecule O2 are forbidden, the abundance of this potentially important grain mantle component cannot be determined. However, embedded in a dirty ice matrix, the fundamental vibration of O2 around 1550 cm-1 becomes observable. The interaction with other molecules in the matrix environment perturbs the symmetry of the O2 molecule and the electric dipole becomes visible in the mid-infrared.In the laboratory, the O = O stretching mode of O2 is detectable in a "dirty ice" matrix at 10 K. The identification of O2 has been confirmed by the use of isotopically labelled O-18(2). Furthermore we have performed experiments to study the role of solid O2 in astrophysically relevant ice mixtures. The integrated absorbance of O2 diluted in various matrices is presented. The possible detection of solid O2 and its major photolysis product O3 in interstellar grains, in dense molecular clouds is discussed.									62	1	0	0	0	0	63			0004-6361			WOS:A1992JE83400050

When intracellular ROS homeostasis is disrupted, it can induce cellular necrosis and apoptosis. It is desirable to effectively cascade-amplifying ROS generation and weaken antioxidant defense for disrupting ROS homeostasis in tumor micro environment (TME), which has been recognized as a novel and ideal antitumor strategy. Multifunctional nanozymes are highly promising agents for ROS-mediated therapy.Methods: This study constructed a novel theranostic nanoagent based on PEG@Cu2-xS@Ce6 nanozymes (PCCNs) through a facile one-step hydrothermal method. We systematically investigated the photodynamic therapy (PDT)/photothermal therapy (PTT) properties, catalytic therapy (CTT) and glutathione (GSH) depletion activities of PCCNs, antitumor efficacy induced by PCCNs in vitro and in vivo.Results: PCCNs generate singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) with laser (660 nm) irradiation and use catalytic reactions to produce hydroxyl radical (center dot OH). Moreover, PCCNs show the high photothermal performance under NIR II 1064-nm laser irradiation, which can enhance CTT/PDT efficiencies to increase ROS generation.

TGA, XRD, Raman, FTIR, SEM, TEM, EDS, XPS and BET have been used to characterize the as-prepared products. The results showed that their compositions, microstructures and concentrations of oxygen vacancies were closely related with the species of organic amines in the hybrid-POMs. When the WO3-x/C composites were used as catalysts for degradation of dyes such as methylene blue, methyl orange and Rhodamine B under visible light irradiation, they showed much enhanced photocatalytic abilities compared to that of WO3 and P25, which could be ascribed to the coating of WO3 by amorphous carbon and the construction of defects (oxygen vacancy) in WO3. The synthetic strategy presented in our work is simple and shows a great potential in fabricating efficient transition metal-based composites for photocatalysis applications and so on.									24	0	1	0	2	0	24			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000468051900007

Their structural and chemical evolution over pO(2) range of 10(-0.9) to 10(-19) atnt was investigated using in situ neutron diffraction at isothermal condition (similar to900degreesC). Neutron diffraction data were analyzed through Rietveld refinements. The following sequences of structural transformation from alpha-Fe2O3 hematite --> (Fe, Co)-spinel --> (Fe, Co)(1-x)O wustite --> (Fe, Co)O rocksalt --> gamma-(Fe, Co) --> alpha-(Fe, Co) --> (gamma-(Fe, Co)) were observed on the reduction of Fe-Co-O based ceramics. With the development of reduction at pO(2) down to 10(-15) atm, mixed valence (Fe2+ and Fe3+) spinel was first formed in Fe-excess (Fe, Co) spinel phases. The intermediate phases were usually Co-rich compared with their parent mixed oxide phases. Particularly, the initial metallic precipitate is Co-rich gamma, independent of initial stoichiometry. Reduction kinetics at pO(2) Of similar to10(-19) atm is extremely fast, but crystalline form and structural integrity are maintained. As crystal structures of the various involved phases are very similar, few structural blocks were disturbed as oxygen was released from the samples. In addition, re-oxidation behavior of reduced products was also studied, and phase composition and microstructure of post-neutron experiments were characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy.

The 3D pores are uniformly distributed on the high fidelity of substrate with pore sizes of 7-12 nm, as confirmed by SEM analysis. Compared to Ti/Sb-SnO2 electrode, the fabricated 3D porous electrode possesses high oxygen evolution potential (2.40 V), smaller charge transfer resistance (29.40 Omega cm(-2)), higher porosity (0.90), enhanced roughness factor (181), and larger voltammetric charge value (57.4 mC cm(-2)). Efectrocatalytic oxidation of Rhodamine B (RhB) was employed to evaluate the efficiency of the fabricated 3D-Ti/Sb-SnO2-Gr anode. The results show that the electrochemical reaction follows pseudo first order kinetics with rate constant (k) value of 4.93 x 10(-2) min(-1), which is about 3,91 times higher compared to flat Ti/Sb-SnO2. The fabricated electrode demonstrates better stability and low specific energy consumption signifying its potential usage in electrocatalysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The surface structures of 3D assembled latex particles, nanovoids and metal nanodomes (ND) were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Their heights and widths analyses were performed with the help of atomic force microscopy (AFM). The effect of diameter of the NDs on their hydrogen evolution activity was examined in 6 M KOH solution at 298 K using electrochemical techniques. Their activities were compared with the activity of bulk Ag electrode. The preparation of 3D-AgNDs having various diameters and examination of their size effects on the water splitting activity have not been studied yet and are being reported firstly. It was found that very well-structured and very uniformly distributed NDs can be fabricated using this procedure. AgNDs exhibit higher hydrogen evolution activity with respect to bulk Ag. Their hydrogen evolution activity depends on their diameters; 1200 nm NDs were the best among them. The current density at -1.40 V(Ag/AgCl) which is proportional to the rate of hydrogen releasing reaction increases from 0.70 mA cm(-2) to 44.13 mA cm(-2) at this ND electrode with respect to the bulk Ag electrode. At the same 3D-AgNDs electrode and potential, the resistance against the HER reduces from 148.7 Omega cm(2) to 1.12 Omega cm(2) (99.6%) by comparing with the bulk Ag electrode. The average surface roughness factors of bulk Ag, 400 nm, 800 nm, 1200 nm and 1600 nm AgNDs are 8, 123, 100, 291 and 176, respectively. The superior hydrogen evolution performance of this electrode is related to its well-structured surface and large real surface area. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The anodic potential-time curves showed four regions: the charging of the anodic double layer, an arrest corresponding to anodic dissolution and/or oxide film formation, linear rise in the potential due to the formation of barrier oxide film and finally deviation from linearity to reach steady-state potential value attributed to oxygen evolution reaction. The duration time of the arrest decreases with increasing current density and concentration of borate anion while the rate of oxide film formation increases. On the other hand, the duration time of the arrest increases with increasing pH and temperature of the solution while the rate of oxide film formation decreases. Increasing the borate concentration and pH of the solution shifted the starting potential of the arrest towards more negative values. Linear relationships were obtained between the starting potential of the arrest and both borate concentration and pH. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In the electrosynthesis of Fe:Ni-Bi, OER kinetics was found to have great influence not only on the current efficiency for film deposition, but also on the surface morphology and crystal structure of the synthesized Fe:Ni-Bi. In addition, the Tafel analyses indicate that incorporating iron modified the OER mechanism and promoted the OER activity. Moreover, both the applied turnover (current) and electrolyte pH used in the anodic pretreatment of Fe:Ni-Bi have great influences on the OER activity of the pretreated Fe:Ni-Bi; the applied turnover rate decides the applied oxidative level and thus affects the extent of phase transformation of beta-NiOOH to gamma-NiOOH, whereas the solution pH for anodic pretreatment affects the electrochemically effective surface area. Finally, the developed electrosynthetic approach can effectively translate the high OER activity of Fe:Ni-Bi from a flat FTO substrate to a porous BiVO4 photoanode, facilitating the interfacial hole transfer and improving photostability of BiVO4.

The current work investigated the effect of the increasing particle concentration on the group combustion with the consideration of temperature and solid fuel type, including bituminous coal char and petroleum coke. A visual imaging technology was used to record and analyze the combustion process and group evolution of burning particles in the two-dimensional scale. Results showed that a delayed combustion phenomenon was found for both coal char and petroleum coke with the increasing particle concentration in a group. The burnout time increased in multiples from the combustion of a single particle, dispersed particles to a particle group. The total carbon conversion and combustion rate of the particle group significantly decreased with the increasing particle concentration in the group, especially for the bituminous char of a high reactivity. With increasing the combustion temperature, the burnout time was additionally prolonged from 20% to 80% between the internal and external particles in the particle group. The theoretical analysis with the consideration of Stefan flow, gas diffusion, and gas-solid reaction was used to propose the delayed combustion mechanism, and the results matched well with the experimental data. The increasing particle concentration in the group, which consumed the oxygen, generated the advance effect of Stefan flow, and hindered the oxygen diffusion, was the key factor to delay the group combustion. For the group combustion of petroleum coke with low reactivity, although the surface reaction was the controlling step, the reactant gas diffusion inside the group could not be ignored. For the group combustion of coal char particle with high reactivity, the diffusion of the reactant gas in the group was the dominant controlling step for the delayed combustion behavior.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000471841600051

To date, the reasons behind this phenomenon are unclear. For the one-step evolution of anode material for lithium-ion batteries, it is essential to understand the lithium storage reaction mechanism of the anode material. Herein, we provide a detailed report on the lithium storage and release mechanism of MnO2, using synchrotron-based X-ray techniques. X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy results indicate that during the first discharge, MnO2 is reduced in the order of MnO2 -> LixMnO(2) (1<X<2) -> MnO -> Mn metal, followed by a reversible reaction between Mn metal and Mn3O4. Furthermore, soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy results indicate that additional reversible formation-decomposition of the electrolyte-derived surface layer occurs and contributes to the reversible capacity of MnO2 after the first discharge. These findings contribute to further understanding of the reaction mechanism and additional lithium storage of MnO2 and suggest practical strategies for developing high energy density anode materials for next-generation Li batteries.

The addition of palladium salt to a copper-plating bath under conditions of vigorous hydrogen evolution was found to influence the pore size and bulk concentration of copper and palladium in the honeycomb bimetallic structure. The surface was characterised by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which revealed that the surface of honeycomb Cu/Pd was found to be rich with a Cu/Pd alloy. The inclusion of palladium in the bimetallic structure not only influenced the pore size, but also modified the dendritic nature of the internal wall structure of the parent copper material into small nanometre-sized crystallites. The chemical composition of the bimetallic structure and substantial morphology changes were found to significantly influence the surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopic response for immobilised rhodamine B and the hydrogen-evolution reaction. The ability to create free-standing films of this honeycomb material may also have many advantages in the areas of gas-and liquid-phase heterogeneous catalysis.									30	3	0	0	0	0	31			0947-6539			WOS:000295357800026	21769955

However, due to the lack of direct evidence at the molecular level, the nano/micro processes of amorphous and crystalline heterostructure electrocatalysts, including self-reconstruction and reaction pathways, remain unknown. Herein, the Leidenfrost effect assisted electrospray approach combined with phase separation was used for the first time to create amorphous NiOx/crystalline alpha-Fe2O3 (a-NiOx/alpha-Fe2O3) nanowire arrays. The results of in situ Raman spectroscopy demonstrate that with the increase of the potential at the a-NiOx/alpha-Fe2O3 interface, a significant accumulation of OH can be observed. Combining with XAS spectra and DFT calculations, we believe that more OH adsorption on the Ni centers can facilitate Ni2+ deprotonation to achieve the high-valence oxidation of Ni4+ according to HSAB theory (Fe3+ serves as a strong Lewis acid). This result promotes the electrocatalysts to follow the lattice oxygen activation mechanism. This work, for the first time, offers direct spectroscopic evidence for deepening the fundamental understanding of the Lewis acid effect of Fe3+, and reveals the synergistic effect on water oxidation via the unique amorphous and crystalline heterostructures.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000788171100001	35694335

Here we measure the kinetics and products of the heterogeneous oxidation of highly oxidized organic aerosol, with an aim of better constraining such atmospheric aging processes. Submicrometer particles composed of model oxidized organics-1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic acid (C8H10O8), citric acid (C6H8O7), tartaric acid (C4H6O6), and Suwannee River fulvic acid-were oxidized by gas-phase OH in a flow reactor, and the masses and elemental composition of the particles were monitored as a function of OH exposure. In contrast to our previous studies of less-oxidized model systems (squalane, erythritol, and levoglucosan), particle mass did not decrease significantly with heterogeneous oxidation. Carbon content of the aerosol always decreased somewhat, but this mass loss was approximately balanced by an increase in oxygen content. The estimated reactive uptake coefficients of the reactions range from 0.37 to 0.51 and indicate that such transformations occur at rates corresponding to 1-2 weeks in the atmosphere, suggesting their importance in the atmospheric lifecycle of organic particulate matter.									45	0	0	0	9	0	45			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000305444100060	22483038

The chemical composition of meltwaters is observed to switch in accordance with subglacial hydrological evolution and redox status. Changing rapidly from reducing to oxidizing conditions, subglacial waters also depict that N-15/N-14 values show microbial denitrification is an active component of nutrient cycling beneath the glacier. O-18/O-16 ratios of sulphate are used to elucidate mechanisms of biological and abiological sulphide oxidation. Concentrations of bicarbonate appear to be governed largely by the degree of rock: water contact encountered in the subglacial system, rather than the switch in redox status, although the potential for microbiological activity to influence ambient bicarbonate concentrations is recognised. Glaciers are therefore highlighted as cryospheric ecosystems supporting microbial life which directly impacts upon the release of solute through biogeochemically mediated processes.									47	3	0	0	23	0	49			0168-2563	1573-515X		WOS:000237568700003

The study of electro-chemical activity on gas doped defective SL-MoS2 is of importance yet still scarcely discussed. Herein, we performed density functional theory calculations to study the adsorption and chemical activity of four major air molecules on the defective SL-MoS2 under different defect concentrations, and evaluated the influence on the hydrogen evolution reaction activity. The N-2 and CO2 molecules are in physisorption states, H2O molecule is in molecular chemisorption state, while O-2 can be strongly captured and dissociated into atomic O*, which repair the S-vacancy and form O-doped structure. Further study showed that compared to the inert S surface of pure MoS2, the O incorporation greatly enhance the surface reactivity. Using H adsorption as the test probe, the adsorption of H becomes stronger with the increasing oxygen concentration. We further unravel the electronic origins underlying the catalytic activity. The lowest unoccupied electronic states are shown to correlate linearly with the activity, and thus can be used as an electronic descriptor to characterize the electrocatalytic activity.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			0953-8984	1361-648X		WOS:000731625600001	34256369

Ultrathin layered metal hydroxides (LMHs) are increasingly being recognized as an important category in 2D nanomaterials, and the corresponding research has been experiencing a significant renaissance. Due to the flexible tunability of metal ions, their naturally positively charged plane and 2D anisotropy with nanometre thickness, ultrathin LMHs and their derived hybrids have shown exciting perspectives in many fields, such as catalysis, and energy storage and conversion. As for practical application, ultrathin 2D LMHs have exhibited high performances in electrocatalysis (e.g. the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions), photocatalysis and supercapacitors. In particular, hybrid materials based on ultrathin LMHs have proven to further improve the catalytic performance by synergistic effects derived from the hybrid interfaces. Nevertheless, studies on ultrathin LMHs are still in the infant stage and lag far behind other important 2D nanomaterials. Hence, it is essential to update the reported work in this emerging research area. In this tutorial review, we aim to summarize recent developments in ultrathin LMHs and their derived hybrids.

While boron is not detected in either star, upper limits to the boron abundance are set, with 12 + log(B/H) less than or equal to 1.6 for both AV 304 and NGC 346-637. The upper limits are consistent with the relationship between boron and oxygen previously reported for Galactic disk stars. The SMC upper limits are discussed in light of that galaxy's star formation history, present oxygen abundance, and present cosmic-ray flux. The UV spectrum has also been used to determine the iron-group abundances in the SMC stars. For AV 304, [Fe/H] = 0.6 +/- 0.2, from both an absolute and a differential analysis ( with respect to the Galactic B-type star HD 36591). This is consistent with results from A-F supergiants in the SMC. A lower iron abundance is found for NGC 346-637, [Fe/H] = 1.0 +/- 0.3, but this is in good agreement with the supergiant iron abundances in NGC 330, another young SMC cluster. We propose that NGC 346-637 might be an unrecognized binary, however, which complicates its spectral analysis.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000176663000011

Layered Co1-xNix hydroxides (x=0, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1) of three different morphologies-nanocones, 2 D nanosheets obtained by the rapid exfoliation of nanoconical counterparts, and 2 D superlattice-like nanostructures alternately restacked by the oppositely charged hydroxide and graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets-have been systematically investigated for electrocatalytic oxygen oxidation. High activity is obtained with the 2 D Co2/3Ni1/3 hydroxide nanosheets/GO superlattice (Co2/3Ni1/3NS-GO), achieving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 259 mV accompanied by a small Tafel slope of 35.7 mV dec(-1), surpassing nanocones and 2 D nanosheets, as well as the congeneric heterostructured Co1-xNix hydroxide nanosheets/GO nanoarchitectures (Co1-xNixNS-GO; x=0, 1/2, 1/4, 1) and the commercial RuO2 electrocatalyst. The outstanding activity of Co2/3Ni1/3NS-GO superlattice uncovers the combined merits of 2 D superlattice-like structure and composition optimization for electrocatalysis, providing a strategy for developing high-performance electrochemical materials by rational morphology and composition design.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000500055700001	31680476

This is the foremost technical challenge to the researchers to progress clean and alternative sustainable energy sources. Among various kinds of energy sources, an environment-friendly fuel, hydrogen is recognized as a favorable energy carrier to reduce the necessity on fossil fuels and protect the environment by reducing the discharge of greenhouse and other toxic gases. Thus, effective production and storage of hydrogen through a cost-effective and significant approach are the important factors of sustainable hydrogen production. Electrocatalytic water splitting is a favorable method for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which requires an efficient and strong electrocatalyst to accelerate the kinetics of HER. To date, the well-developed electrocatalysts for HER activity are Pt-group metals, but, these electrocatalysts are inadequate and more expensive. In recent years, significant improvement has been achieved in the development of carbon cloth-based HER electrocatalysts as a replacement to Pt-based catalysts for hydrogen production in acidic medium. In this review, we mainly focused on the recent growth in the establishment of carbon-cloth functionalized transition metal (Fe-, Co-, Ni-, Mo-, and W-) based electrocatalysts towards the enhancement of HER activity. Depending on the results, we believed that the transition metal-based electrocatalysts have been appearing as fascinating and future alternative catalysts due to their morphology improvements, synergistic effects, a significant enhancement in the production of active sites, charge transfer efficiency, and superior HER activity with great durability. In addition, we outline the remarkable challenges and future prospects in this inspiring field. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we report a multilayer stabilization strategy for constructing M-SACs in nitrogen-, sulfur- and fluorine-co-doped graphitized carbons (M=Fe, Co, Ru, Ir and Pt). Metal precursors are embedded into perfluorotetradecanoic acid multilayers and are further coated with polypyrrole prior to pyrolysis. Aggregation of the metals is thus efficiently inhibited to achieve M-SACs with a high metal loading (similar to 16wt%). Fe-SAC serves as an efficient oxygen reduction catalyst with half-wave potentials of 0.91 and 0.82V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode) in alkaline and acid solutions, respectively. Moreover, as an air electrode in zinc-air batteries, Fe-SAC demonstrates a large peak power density of 247.7mWcm(-2) and superior long-term stability(.) Our versatile method paves an effective way to develop high-loading M-SACs for various applications.									106	2	0	0	7	0	106			2041-1723			WOS:000595687000012	33208746

Chilling does not lead to a decrease in the extrinsic 16, 23 and 33 kDa polypeptides. Upon illumination of chilled leaves both Mn content and O2 evolution in thylakoids are restored and FFA content is reduced to the level of the control. Photoactivation of O2 evolution in chilled leaves does not change the ratio of unsaturated/saturated FFA. Constant Arrhenius activation energy (Ea) for O2 evolution by thylakoids isolated from control leaves was found, whereas it increased at temperatures below 8.0 and 10.5-degrees-C in thylakoids from cold-treated and photoactivated leaves, respectively. This indicates that restoration of O2 evolution as well as of FFA and Mn contents is not accompanied by a complete reversal of membrane conformation.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0031-9317			WOS:A1991FW45300024

It has been shown that hollow shells of cobalt oxide were formed in this process, consisting of the mixture of CoO and Co3O4 oxides. A linear relationship between the thickness of shells and the initial particles size was established which suggests that both diffusion of cobalt ions through the oxide layer and diffusion of the oxygen into cobalt occur, but particles sintering is negligible compared with the reverse diffusion of cobalt. The lower critical diameter of cobalt particles was estimated, above which formation of hollow shells occurred. The hollow shells formation is suggested to be the reason for cobalt redispersion upon oxidation-reduction cycling of supported heterogeneous catalysts.									44	3	0	0	3	0	45			1932-7447			WOS:000257155200007

Here, the authors investigate the degradation mechanisms at the LGPS/NCM622 interface providing a quantitative model to interpret the interfacial resistance growth.All-solid-state batteries are intensively investigated, although their performance is not yet satisfactory for large-scale applications. In this context, the combination of Li10GeP2S12 solid electrolyte and LiNi1-x-yCoxMnyO2 positive electrode active materials is considered promising despite the yet unsatisfactory battery performance induced by the thermodynamically unstable electrode|electrolyte interface. Here, we report electrochemical and spectrometric studies to monitor the interface evolution during cycling and understand the reactivity and degradation kinetics. We found that the Wagner-type model for diffusion-controlled reactions describes the degradation kinetics very well, suggesting that electronic transport limits the growth of the degradation layer formed at the electrode|electrolyte interface. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the rate of interfacial degradation increases with the state of charge and the presence of two oxidation mechanisms at medium (3.7 V vs. Li+/Li < E < 4.2 V vs. Li+/Li) and high (E >= 4.2 V vs. Li+/Li) potentials. A high state of charge (>80%) triggers the structural instability and oxygen release at the positive electrode and leads to more severe degradation.									12	0	0	0	0	0	11				2041-1723		WOS:000720682300022	34795212

To investigate the evolution of particulate matter, partial regeneration of a filter was produced by active substances generated by a plasma injection system. The surface morphology, oxidation characteristics, and surface functional groups of particle samples inside the filters before and after regeneration were investigated using digital electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis, and fourier transform infrared spectrometry. Results show that during the regeneration step, the soot cake surface changed from random irregular cracks to more uniform and relatively dense pores. Decreases in characteristic temperatures and the growth of oxygen-containing functional groups indicated that nonthermal plasma could improve the oxidizing activity of particulate matter. The reaction between nonthermal plasma and particulate matter was most intense but not limited to the regeneration interface area of the soot cake.									38	4	0	0	3	0	39			1359-4311			WOS:000462418200054

Especially, the substrate concentration, as well as oxygen availability, determine the metabolic rates. In large-scale bioreactors, microorganisms encounter dynamic conditions in substrate and oxygen availability (mixing limitations), which influence their metabolism and subsequently their physiology. Earlier, single substrate pulse experiments were not able to explain the observed physiological changes generated under large-scale industrial fermentation conditions.Results: In this study we applied a repetitive feast-famine regime in an aerobic Escherichia coli culture in a timescale of seconds. The regime was applied for several generations, allowing cells to adapt to the (repetitive) dynamic environment. The observed response was highly reproducible over the cycles, indicating that cells were indeed fully adapted to the regime. We observed an increase of the specific substrate and oxygen consumption (average) rates during the feast-famine regime, compared to a steady-state (chemostat) reference environment. The increased rates at same (average) growth rate led to a reduced biomass yield (30% lower). Interestingly, this drop was not followed by increased by-product formation, pointing to the existence of energy-spilling reactions. During the feast-famine cycle, the cells rapidly increased their uptake rate. Within 10 s after the beginning of the feeding, the substrate uptake rate was higher (4.68 mu mol/g(CDW)/s) than reported during batch growth (3.3 mu mol/gCDW/s). The high uptake led to an accumulation of several intracellular metabolites, during the feast phase, accounting for up to 34% of the carbon supplied. Although the metabolite concentrations changed rapidly, the cellular energy charge remained unaffected, suggesting well-controlled balance between ATP producing and ATP consuming reactions.Conclusions: The adaptation of the physiology and metabolism of E. coli under substrate dynamics, representative for large-scale fermenters, revealed the existence of several cellular mechanisms coping with stress. Changes in the substrate uptake system, storage potential and energy-spilling processes resulted to be of great importance. These metabolic strategies consist a meaningful step to further tackle reduced microbial performance, observed under large-scale cultivations.									8	0	0	0	5	0	8				1475-2859		WOS:000548280900003	32471427	
J	Yao, Yuchao; Li, Qi; Dai, Xuhang; Dai, Ping; Xu, Dongyan								A novel hierarchical CdS-DETA@CoP composite as highly stable photocatalyst for efficient H-2 evolution from water splitting under visible light irradiation								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				588						152890	10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.152890				JUN 30 2022	2022	The photolysis of water using photocatalysts under sunlight irradiation for hydrogen generation reaction is an efficient strategy to solve energy and environmental issues. Herein, a novel hierarchical CdS-DETA@CoP composite was fabricated and applied to visible-light-driven photocatalytic water splitting for generating H-2. To achieve this goal, we first prepared a 3D hierarchical CoP co-catalyst via direct phosphatization of the ZIF-67 precursor. Then, two-dimensional (2D) CdS-DETA nanosheets were in situ grown on the surface of hierarchical CoP through a facile water bath method, obtaining a CdS-DETA@CoP composite with a high surface area. The CdS-DETA@CoP composite with 20 wt% CoP exhibits a maximum photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate of 48.76 mmol g(-1)h(-1) under visible light irradiation with lactic acid as the sacrificial reagent, which is 46.4 times as high as CdS-DETA. The synergistic effect between CdS-DETA and CoP induced remarkable ability of light-harvesting and efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, thus profoundly promoting the activity and stability. The excellent activity is also closely related to the better dispersion of CdS-DETA on the surface of hierarchical CoP co-catalyst.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000786674900005		
J	Meakin, Casey A.; Arnett, David								Anelastic and compressible simulations of stellar oxygen burning								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				665	1			690	697		10.1086/519372				AUG 10 2007	2007	In this paper we compare fully compressible ( Meakin & Arnett 2006, 2007) and anelastic ( Kuhlen et al. 2003) simulations of stellar oxygen shell burning. It is found that the two models are in agreement in terms of the velocity scale ( v(c) similar to 10(7) cm s(-1)) and thermodynamic fluctuation amplitudes ( e. g., rho'/<rho > similar to 2 x 10(-3) ) in the convective flow. Large fluctuations ( similar to 11%) arise in the compressible model, localized to the convective boundaries, and are due to internal waves excited in stable layers. Fluctuations on the several percent level are also present in the compressible model due to composition inhomogeneities from ongoing entrainment events at the convective boundaries. Comparable fluctuations ( with amplitudes greater than similar to 1%) are absent in the anelastic simulation, because they are due to physics not included in that model. We derive an analytic estimate for the expected density fluctuation amplitudes at convective boundaries by assuming that the pressure fluctuations due to internal waves at the boundary, p'(w) , balance the ram pressure of the convective motions, rho v(c)(2). The predicted amplitudes agree well with the simulation data. The good agreement between the anelastic and the compressible solution within the convection zone and the agreement between the stable layer dynamics and analytic solutions to the nonradial wave equation indicate that the compressible hydrodynamic techniques used are robust for the simulated stellar convection model, even at the low Mach numbers found, M similar to 0.01.									58	0	0	0	0	0	58			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000248675700051

Epitomizing this conception, the first cells may have arisen in submarine hydrothermal vents in the middle of a gradient established by the hot and alkaline hydrothermal fluid and the cooler and more acidic water of the ocean. To enable their escape from this energy-providing gradient layer, the early cells must have overcome a whole series of obstacles. Beyond the loss of their energy source, the early cells had to adapt to a loss of external iron-sulfur catalysis as well as to a formidable temperature drop. The developed solutions to these two problems seem to have followed the principle of maximum parsimony: Cysteine was introduced into the genetic code to anchor iron-sulfur clusters, and fatty acid unsaturation was installed to maintain lipid bilayer viscosity. Unfortunately, both solutions turned out to be detrimental when the biosphere became more oxidizing after the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis. To render cysteine thiol groups and fatty acid unsaturation compatible with life under oxygen, numerous counter-adaptations were required including the advent of glutathione and the addition of the four latest amino acids (methionine, tyrosine, tryptophan, selenocysteine) to the genetic code. In view of the continued diversification of derived antioxidant mechanisms, it appears that modern life still struggles with the initially developed strategies to escape from its hydrothermal birthplace. Only archaea may have found a more durable solution by entirely exchanging their lipid bilayer components and rigorously restricting cysteine usage.									12	0	0	0	7	0	12			1431-6730	1437-4315		WOS:000506672200001	31318686

The fundamental design strategy for producing such high efficiency in multijunction amorphous silicon devices involves careful current. matching in each of the junctions by adjustment of the absorption spectra through bandgap tailoring. Integrated electrical/optical models are frequently used to aid in the optimization procedure, as well documented in the PV literature. Typically, the top nip junction in an a-Si triple-junction cell is designed to absorb most strongly in the 350-500 mn range. In principle, this top cell could be replaced by a PEC junction with strong absorption in a similar range to form a water-splitting photoelectrode for hydrogen production. This photoelectrode could be fabricated on SS with the back surface catalyzed for the hydrogen evolution reaction, and the front surface deposited with an a-Si:nipnip/ITO/SC structure. The top layer semiconductor (SC), which forms the PEC junction with an electrolyte, must have appropriate conduction band alignment for the oxygen evolution reaction, and the junction must be strongly absorbing in the 350-500 nm region for current matching. Possible candidate SC materials include dye-sensitized titanium dioxide (TiO2), tungsten trioxide (WO3), and iron oxide (Fe2O3). This paper discusses the specific design considerations for high solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency in a hybrid solid-state/PEC photoelectrode, and describes the use of integrated electrical/electrochemical/optical models developed at the University, of Hawaii for the analysis of such hybrid structures.. Important issues include the bias-voltage and current-matching requirements in the solid-state and electrochemical junctions, as well as fundamental quantum efficiency considerations.

Appropriate regulation of the interaction between Pt and substrate could enhance the intrinsic activity of composite catalysts toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the alkaline media. Herein, we electrodeposit Pt nanoparticles on amorphous NiFe LDH (Pt/NiFe-ED) or crystalline NiFe LDH (Pt/NiFe-HD) to regulate the interaction between Pt and NiFe LDH. Experimental results reveal that Pt nanoparticles on NiFe-ED are smaller than those on NiFe-HD and possess a narrower size distribution. Thus, Pt/NiFe-ED (300 mu M) exhibits a much lower overpotential of 81 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) than Pt/NiFe-HD. In contrast, Pt/NiFe-HD exhibits a higher intrinsic activity than Pt/NiFe-ED, which could be caused by the easily elongated Pt-O bond. These findings provide new opportunities to understand the relationship between activity and crystallinity of substrates in the composite electrocatalyst.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1948-7185			WOS:000683816500021	34310144

Toufiq/0000-0001-9856-5947; 			Characterization of products from hydrothermal carbonization of orange pomace including anaerobic digestibility of process liquor								BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY				196				35	42		10.1016/j.biortech.2015.06.115				NOV 2015	2015	In this study, the effect of the temperature and reaction time on hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of orange pomace was investigated. In addition, a set of anaerobic batch tests were performed to determine the resulting biogas and methane potential of the spent liquor. Hydrochar yields followed a decreasing trend with the increasing temperature, whereas reaction time had no considerably effect on the yield. The evolution of the H/C and O/C atomic ratios from the raw material to the hydrochars suggested that dehydration reactions prevail during HTC. The hydrochars tended to become enriched in Ca, Mg and P minerals by increasing HTC temperature. The heavy metal contents in hydrochars were found below limits and no PAH compound was detected. Anaerobic digestion tests showed that the aqueous phase from HTC can be used as feedstocks for biogas production. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

On the other hand, the semiconductor/liquid interface is a key factor governing the water splitting efficiency due to its influence on charge separation and collection. Herein, we synthesized vertically aligned WO3 nanosheet array (NS) films on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), and followed by electroreduction for tuning the surface structure of WO3 NSs. A disordered layer is formed on the surface of WO3 NSs by controlling the external bias voltage and reduction time of electroreduction, and its thickness of the disordered layer varies with reduction time. The optimal WO3 NSs with a 1.2nm disorder layer thickness exhibit a remarkable photocurrent density of 1.07mAcm(-2) at 1.23V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under AM 1.5G illumination, which is 1.43 times of pristine WO3 NSs. The results indicate that the electroreduction voltage and reduction time exert great influence on the formation of the surface disordered layer, and the optimized reduction conditions can enhance charge transfer and charge separation efficiency, substantially improving the PEC performance of WO3 photoanode.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000467618000034

The pendant hydroxy or amino groups are very important for activity, and the complexes with heteroatom-functionalized NHC ligands show up to 15 times higher rates of oxygen evolution in CAN-induced water oxidation than a reference (IrCp)-Cp-III* complex without heteroatom functionalization. The formation of molecular high-valent Ir intermediates that are presumably involved in the rate-determining step for water oxidation is established by UV/Vis spectroscopy and ESI-MS under turnover conditions. The hydroxy groups on the NHC ligands, as well as chloride ligands on the iridium center are proposed to structurally stabilize the highvalent species, and thereby improve the catalytic activity. The Ir-III complex with a hydroxy-functionalized NHC shows the highest catalytic activity with a TON of 2500 obtained in 3 h and with >90% yield relative to the amount of oxidant used.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000416158500039	28885785
