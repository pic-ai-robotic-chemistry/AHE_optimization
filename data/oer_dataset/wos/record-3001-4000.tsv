J	Ahmed, Sheraz; Rim, Hyung-Ryul; Sun, Ho-Jung; Lee, Hong-Ki; Shim, Joongpyo; Park, Gyungse								Fabrication of heteroatom doped cobalt catalyst for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in alkaline medium								BULLETIN OF THE KOREAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY				43	5			745	749		10.1002/bkcs.12518		MAR 2022		MAY 2022	2022	The application of heteroatom doped cobalt (Ni@Co/C) prepared from a porous metal-organic framework as the cathode material for the rechargeable zinc-air batteries has been demonstrated. The Ni@Co/C-modified electrode showed an excellent catalytic activity toward oxidation-reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reactions. The Co/C catalysts, which were Co particle impregnated on graphitic carbon powders, were synthesized after the calcination of Co-3 (SDA)(3)(DMF)(2) precursor, and then Ni deposition (Ni@Co/C) was followed on it by chemical reduction. Linear sweep voltammetry measurement indicates that Ni@Co/C-H800, which had Ni particles on Co/C derived from MOF at 800 degrees C under N-2, exhibited excellent performance. The stable charging/discharging profiles at 20 mA cm(-2) of current were obtained for the 350 h in alkaline medium, suggesting Ni@Co/C-H800 as a potential candidate for oxidation-reduction and evolution reactions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0253-2964	1229-5949		WOS:000770447000001

The MnxCo3-xO4-delta materials showed ultrahigh oxygen evolution activity and strong durability in alkaline solutions, and are capable of delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.58 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode in 0.1 M KOH solution, which is superior in comparison to IrO2 catalysts under identical experimental conditions, and comparable to the most active noble-metal and transition-metal oxygen evolution electrocatalysts reported so far. The high performance for catalytic oxygen evolution originates from both compositional and structural features of the synthesized materials. The moderate content of Mn doping into the spinel framework led to their improved electronic conductivity and strong oxidizing ability, and the well-developed porosity, accompanied with the high affinity between OH- reactants and catalyst surface, contributed to the smooth mass transport, thus endowing them with superior oxygen evolution activity.									39	1	0	0	1	0	40			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000342626200042	25124830

Ultralow cell voltages of only 1.47 and 1.75 V are enough to deliver current densities of 10 and 500 mA cm(-2), respectively, for overall water splitting, outperforming the benchmark couple, Pt/C and IrO2. The stability of the product is also outstanding, remaining stable after operations at an ultrahigh current density of 500 mA cm(-2) for 50 h. The success of the product catalyst is attributed to the much increased active site number with the construction of inverse-opals on nickel foam and the much enhanced intrinsic activities of the active sites through synergistic effects between the three constituent elements.									43	2	0	0	2	0	43			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000518865300054

While the common approach in search of active, durable and cost-effective oxygen evolution catalysts involves the development of novel materials, it is equally important to tune the properties of existing materials so as to improve their catalytic performance. Here, we demonstrate the general efficacy of electrochemical lithium tuning in organic electrolyte on enhancing the oxygen evolution catalytic activity of olivine-type lithium transition metal phosphates, a widely-researched family of cathode materials in lithium ion batteries. By continuously extracting lithium ions out of lithium transition metal phosphates, the materials exhibited significantly enhanced water oxidation catalytic activity. Particularly, the electrochemically delithiated Li(Ni,Fe)PO4 nanoparticles anchored on reduced graphene oxide sheets afforded outstanding performance, generating a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of only 0.27 V for over 24 h without degradation in 0.1 M KOH, outperforming the commercial precious metal Ir catalysts.									145	7	0	0	9	0	145			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000355985700011

Herein, a cobalt metal-organic frameworks (Co-MOFs) array is employed as the platform to fabricate oxygen-defect-rich Co3O4 flakes that are vertical grown on nickel foam substrates. This MOFs-derived Co3O4 arrays show a hierarchical interconnected porous flake network structure with tunable oxygen vacancies. The unique structural features obtained from an optimal hydrogenation condition render outstanding catalytic performance toward the oxygen evolution in alkaline media (an ultralow overpotential of 205 mV at 10 mA cm(-2); a small Tafel slope of 65.3 mV dec(-1) as well as high stability). This OER performance is among the best non-noble metal catalysts reported to date. Meanwhile, this defect-rich Co3O4 array electrode is also efficient for catalyzing hydrogen evolution in the same basic solution (overpotential of.108 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)). The electrolyzer for overall water splitting can deliver a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage as low as 1.84 V. Density functional theory calculation reveals that the enhanced OER performance mainly arises from the oxygen vacancies and consequently the lowered activation energy as well as improved electrical conductivity.

Oxygen evolution was used as a model reaction to investigate the dependence of the electrocatalytic properties on oxide composition. Kinetics was studied by quasistationary current-potential curves and reaction order determination. A minimum Tafel slope of about 30 mV has been found in the 10-30% CeO2 composition range. On the basis of a zero reaction order at constant overpotential, a reaction mechanism has been proposed accounting for the composition dependence of the Tafel slope. It has been concluded that the replacement of TiO2 with CeO2 brings about an increase in the electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution, while the layer becomes more prone to mechanical erosion.									100	3	0	0	2	2	101			0021-891X			WOS:A1996VU42700014

Being one of the half reactions, the water oxidation was proved to be the key step to restrain the overall of water splitting. Herein, Co3O4 composites were successfully obtained by directly annealing a MOF-derived Co complex under air condition. The Co3O4 complex with a surface area of 34.7 m(2)/g and wider pore size distribution obtained at 350 degrees C was found to be the most active OER catalyst in 1 M KOH, an overpotential of 420 mV@10 mA/cm(2) with a Tafel slope of 55 mV/dec was detected.

The synergetic effects between bimetallic atoms provide many active sites, promising to improve catalytic performance and even catalyze more complex reactions. This paper reviews the recent research progresses of two kinds of DACs, including homonuclear and heteronuclear DACs, and their applications in oxygen reduction, carbon dioxide reduction, hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, Zn-air batteries, tandem catalytic reactions, and so on. In addition, in order to promote the further development of DACs, the challenges and perspectives of DACs are put forward.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000820655600001	35686615

However, research has yet been insufficient on oxygen transport analysis to reaction site surface in catalyst layer under surge evolution. In this paper, an agglomerate model is used to investigate oxygen concentration, local current density, and activation over-potential along catalyst layer thickness under surge evolution. The results are validated versus experimental data from our test. Unlike previous analyses of oxygen transport in the catalyst layer, this study presents an analytic dynamic compressor model that is able to examine the various surge phenomenon. In this study, an agglomerate model is introduced and fuel cell system model including a dynamic compressor is implemented to investigate the influence of surge evolution on the cell performance. At the end, fuel cell system model is simulated during Highway Fuel Economy (HWFET) cycle. The results indicate that oxygen concentration at the GDL/CL interface within the range z = 0 mu m to z = 3 mu m is most strongly affected by surge evolution, and oxygen concentration changes are strongly affected by surge evolution up to z = 3 mu m.									9	2	0	0	0	0	11			1359-4311			WOS:000469892000024

The as-obtained porous Co-P foam, compared to other control samples prepared under different conditions, shows outstanding electrocatalytic performance in alkaline electrolyte for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), requiring an overpotential of 290 mV for HER and 380 mV for OER, respectively, at a high current density of 1000 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the electrolyzer consisting of two symmetric porous Co-P foam electrodes only requires a cell voltage of 1.98 V to operate at 1000 mA cm(-2) for overall water electrolysis, with extraordinary stability of 4000 h, showing great potential for use in industrial alkaline water electrolysis.									26	1	0	0	1	0	27			2168-0485			WOS:000551360900025

Cobalt nanomaterials have been widely identified as a promising candidate for the anode (oxygen evolution) reaction in this process, but much work has focused on applied materials or electrode design. Given the importance of oxidation state changes Co(III) -> Co(IV) in the accepted reaction mechanism, in this work we look at size effects in small (4-10 nm) cobalt nanoparticles, where the ease of oxidation for lower cobalt oxidation states is known to change with particle size. To discriminate between geometric and chemical effects we have compared the catalysts in this study to others in the literature by turnover frequency (widely used in other areas of catalysis), in addition to the more commonly employed performance metric of the overpotential required to produce a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Comparisons are drawn to key examples of using well defined nanomaterials (where the surface are of cobalt sites can be estimated). This has enabled an estimated intrinsic turnover rate of similar to 1 O-2 molecule per surface Co atom per second at an overpotential of 500 mV in the oxygen evolution reaction under typical alkaline reaction conditions (pH 14.0) to be identified.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			1022-5528	1572-9028		WOS:000435827900024	30996581

The catalyst achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.61 V on an inert support and at 1.59 V when impregnated with nitrogen-doped graphene. Stable performance is maintained at 10 mA cm(-2) for at least 60 h. The optimized catalyst, Co2B annealed at 500 degrees C (Co2B-500) evolves oxygen more efficiently than RuO2 and IrO2, and its performance matches the best cobalt-based catalysts reported to date. Co2B is irreversibly oxidized at OER conditions to form a CoOOH surface layer. The active form of the catalyst is therefore represented as CoOOH/Co2B. EXAFS observations indicate that boron induces lattice strain in the crystal structure of the metal, which potentially diminishes the thermodynamic and kinetic barrier of the hydroxylation reaction, formation of the OOH* intermediate, a key limiting step in the OER.									563	39	0	0	22	0	569			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000373149700019

Cost-effective transition metal oxide-based catalysts are superbly active for OER; however, their applications in catalyzing HER remain challenging due to unsatisfactory activity and intrinsically poor electronic conductivity. Here, we report the synthesis of NiO nanorods (NRs) with abundant oxygen (O) vacancies via a facile cation exchange strategy. Based on the experimental studies and density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that the chemical and electronic property of NiO NRs is successfully optimized through O-vacancy engineering; the O-vacancies on the surface of NiO NRs remarkably enhance their electronic conduction and promote HER reaction kinetics simultaneously. The resulting NiO NRs exhibit excellent alkaline HER catalytic activity and durability. Furthermore, these specific designed NiO NRs in situ on carbon fiber paper substrates were directly employed as both HER and OER catalysts for overall water splitting, affording better performance than benchmark Pt and RuO2 catalysts. The successful synthesis of these metal oxides nanomaterials with abundant O-vacancies may pave a new path for rationally fabricating efficient HER/ OER bi-functional catalysts.									373	18	0	0	10	0	376			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000419832100012

Development of bifunctional catalysts that are active for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key factor in enhancing electrochemical water splitting activity and simplifying the overall system design. Here, recent developments in HER-OER bifunctional catalysts are reviewed. Several main types of bifunctional water splitting catalysts such as cobalt-, nickel-and iron-based materials are discussed in detail. Particular attention is paid to their synthesis, bifunctional catalytic activity and stability, and strategies for activity enhancement. The current challenges faced are also concluded and future perspectives towards bifunctional water splitting electrocatalysts are proposed.									766	38	1	0	14	0	773			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000388504800001

Hydrogen production from electrolyzed water is of great significance to solve the energy crisis and environmental problems in the future. Recently, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) materials have been widely studied in the electrocatalysis field, due to their unique layered structure, tunable metal species and highly dispersed active sites. Moreover, the LDHs supporting noble metal catalysts obtained through the topotactic transformation of LDHs precursors significantly reduce the energy barrier of electrolyzing water, showing remarkable catalytic activity, good conductivity and excellent durability. In this review, we give an overview of recent advances on LDHs supporting noble metal catalysts, from a brief introduction, to their preparation and modification methods, to an overview of their application in the electrocatalysis field, as well as the challenges and outlooks in this promising field on the basis of current development.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6				2079-4991		WOS:000714841500001	34685086

In this work, we have investigated tantalum based catalysts supported on carbon nanofibers (CNF) for the first time. The effect of CNF characteristics and the catalyst annealing temperature on the electrochemical response for the OER have been analyzed in alkaline environment using a rotating ring disc electrode (RRDE). The best OER activity and oxygen efficiency were found with a highly graphitic CNF, despite its lower surface area, synthesized at 700 degrees C, and upon a catalyst annealing temperature of 800 degrees C. The ordering degree of carbon nanofibers favors the production of oxygen in combination with a low oxygen content in tantalum oxides. The most active catalyst exhibited also an excellent durability.

Based on the type of materials, the discussions are categorized into sections attributed to transition metal alloys, hydroxides, oxides, chalcogenides, carbides and nitrogenous materials. In general, a brief introduction of HER and OER mechanisms followed by a detailed discussion of the presently considered catalysts with endeavors have been made to highlight the new technologies and alternative approaches that are being considered promising towards production of clean H-2 energy.

Here, we developed a one-pot pyrolysis approach toward the preparation of heteroatom-doped hierarchical porous three-dimensional (3D) graphene frameworks decorated with multilayer graphene shell-coated cobalt oxide nanocrystal. Large literal sheet size of graphene nanomeshes may stimulate rapid thermolysis with cobalt-oleate complex to form Co3O4 nanocrystals and in situ growth of multilayer graphene coating co-doped by boron and nitrogen with controlling heating rate up to 600 degrees C. This new material worked as superior bifunctional electrocatalyst on oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction to commercial Pt/C with better onset potential/half-wave potentials, larger current density, better stability, and stronger methanol tolerance. The heteroatom co-doping into porous/curved graphene confined nanocrystals in 3D porous walls provided adequate accessibility of created catalytic active sites and ideal mass transport route for the excellent catalytic activity on redox reaction of oxygen. The synthesized material-based Zn-air battery further confirmed its superior electrolytic activity with high specific capacity and smaller overpotential. This one-pot pyrolysis method shows a great potential of scalable synthesis of high-performance practical electrocatalyst for metal-air batteries and fuel cells at a low cost.									34	2	0	0	1	0	35			1944-8244			WOS:000417005900022	29110450

However, the precise role of the guest elements, B and P, in enhancing the OER of the host element (Ni) remains unclear. Herein, we present insight into the role of B and P in enhancing electrocatalysis of oxygen evolution by nickel borides and nickel phosphides. The apparent activation energy, E-a*, of electrocatalytic oxygen evolution on Ni2P was 78.4 kJ/mol, on Ni2B 65.4 kJ/mol, and on Ni nanoparticles 94.0 kJ/mol, thus revealing that both B and P affect the intrinsic activity of nickel. XPS data revealed shifts of -0.30 and 0.40 eV in the binding energy of the Ni 2p(3/2) peak of Ni2B and Ni2P, respectively, with respect to that of pure Ni at 852.60 eV, thus indicating that B and P induce opposite electronic effects on the surface electronic structure of Ni. The origin of enhanced activity for oxygen evolution cannot, therefore, be attributed to such electronic modification or ligand effect. Severe changes induced on the nickel lattice, specifically, the Ni-Ni atomic order and interatomic distances (strain effect), by the presence of the guest atoms seem to be the dominant factors responsible for enhanced activity of oxygen evolution in nickel borides and nickel phosphides.									47	3	0	0	1	0	48			2196-0216			WOS:000454705900028

Polyoxometalates (POMs) can be excellent candidates in this context. In this study, we found that oxo-bridged tetraruthenium polyoxometalate (RuPOM) exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity for both oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER and ORR) with minimal use of noble metal elements and can be used for the development of efficient seawater batteries (SWBs). The deposition of RuPOM on a desired electrode with conducting carbon Ketjen black (KB) by the simple slurry coating method imparted bifunctional OER/ORR activity to the underlying electrode. Although the mass activity was similar, RuPOM/KB mixtures exhibited superior activity even compared to commercially available Pt/C when comparing the activity per noble metal element. Based on these findings, we employed RuPOM to develop efficient SWBs. RuPOM significantly lowered the charging potential and increased the discharging potential of SWBs, which are related to OER and ORR, respectively. This study can provide insights into the development of POM-based electrocatalysts and their application in energy storage and conversion devices.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000555417200045	32589016

However, the catalytic mechanisms of pyrochlore oxides have not been comprehensively revealed yet. Herein, we intensively investigate the redox reactions and changes of local structures of the A- and B-site cations of bismuth ruthenate pyrochlore (Bi2Ru2O7) during the OER by in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis. Particularly, the catalytic activity at bismuth and ruthenium sites could determine the degrees of redox reactions, which compete with oxygen evolution for transferring electrons by the applied potentials during cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. Furthermore, we successfully clarify the neighboring atoms of bismuth and ruthenium ions in the first and second coordination shells by Morlet wavelet analysis to reveal the correlation of redox reactions with the consumption of Bi2Ru2O7.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000732008900001

Great efforts have been devoted to developing efficient photocatalysts; however, the surface catalytic reactions, especially for the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), still remain a challenge, which limits the overall photocatalytic energy efficiency. Herein, we design a Rh-n cluster cocatalyst, with Rh-0-Rh3+ sites anchoring the Mo-doped BiVO4 model photocatalytic system. The resultant photocatalyst enables a high visible-light photocatalytic oxygen production activity of 7.11 mmol g(-1) h(-1) and an apparent quantum efficiency of 29.37 % at 420 nm. The turnover frequency (TOF) achieves 416.73 h(-1), which is 378 times higher than that of the photocatalyst only with Rh3+ species. Operando X-ray absorption characterization shows the OER process on the Rh-0-Rh3+ sites. The DFT calculations further illustrate a bifunctional OER mechanism over the Rh-0-Rh3+ sites, in which the oxygen intermediate attacks the Rh3+ sites with assistance of a hydrogen atom transfer to the Rh-0 sites, thus breaking the scaling relationship of various oxygen intermediates.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000674837600001	34170067

Oxygen vacancy can optimize the electrochemical activity of electrocatalyst toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, the formation of oxygen vacancy in NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) is tailored by the simple Co-doping strategy, leading to the weakening of metal-O bond and the upshift of O 2p band center. As a result, the density of oxygen vacancy is increased, which can effectively improve the OER and HER performance of NiFe-LDH. The optimal Co-doping NiFe-LDH/NF displays as low as 1.58 V and 1.79 V for overall water splitting at 10 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, better than the precious metal IrO2//Pt/C combination. Moreover, the water splitting setup can been continuously driven by the photovoltage device in the sun.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000704467300007

Here, we report a composite architecture that consists of onion-like ultrathin graphene shells encapsulating uniform metallic nickel nanoparticles (Ni@graphene) derived by a straightforward thermal treatment of a Ni-based metal organic framework in an inert atmosphere. The resulting Ni@graphene is highly catalytically active for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1.0 M KOH solutions. It only requires relatively low overpotentials (OER 370 mV; HER 240 mV) to yield a catalytic current of 10 mA/cm(2), which compares favorably to most previously reported Ni-based elecrocatalysts for water splitting. The excellent performance would be attributed to the catalytic sites of metallic Ni and the intact metal protection effect of the outer graphene layers.									149	7	0	0	4	0	149			2168-0485			WOS:000402950000033

Herein, we design a two action sites strategy to break interdependence restriction to reduce the calculative overpotential. Density functional theory demonstrated that the introduced oxygen vacancies could accelerate the oxidation of H2O by induced an extra reaction step, corresponding deprotonation of H2O* decomposed into two separated reaction steps: H2O* <-> (HO + H)* and (HO + H)* <-> HO* + H+ + e(-). Meanwhile, experimental observations confirm that two action sites promote the Vo-CoOOH OER performance including a lower onset potential, a lower Tafel slope and an incremental Turnover frequency (TOF) from 0.01 to 0.04 s(-1). Through this work, a viable design principle for, but not limited to, CoOOH OER catalyst is proposed: injected hole can activate the synergistic catalytic effect of two actions sites to accelerate the water oxidation.									82	4	0	0	3	0	83			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000418344200011

Herein, we demonstrate a novel bifunctional electrocatalyst with CeO2 and Co nanoparticles being embedded in N-doped carbon, which is achieved via pyrolyzing CeO2@zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 particles. In 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution, CeO2/Co@N-doped carbon shows an excellent electrocatalytic performance with an oxygen reduction reaction onset potential of 0.998 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode with an oxygen evolution reaction overpotential of 474 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The liquid rechargeable Zn-air battery that is assembled by using CeO2/Co@N-doped carbon as the air cathode shows excellent charge/discharge performance, with an open-circuit potential of 1.42 V and a maximum power density of 102.69 mW cm(-2). Furthermore, the rechargeable Zn-air battery exhibits stable cycling performance at a constant current density of 5 mA cm(-2) after 70 hours, with a charge/discharge gap of only 0.8 V and round-trip efficiency of ca. 59%. The remarkable bifunctional properties are considered to arise from the synergistic effect between the N-doped carbon and CeO2 nanoparticles, where abundant Ce3+ and oxygen vacancies in CeO2 are generated and more defect sites are available in N-doped carbon.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2052-1553			WOS:000512754200029

Infrared spectroscopy identifies a common? tilted methoxy intermediate at high temperature on all overlayers studied; electron energy loss spectroscopy shows that this intermediate decomposes to deposit oxygen exclusively in high-coordination sites; While C-O bond scission to evolve gas-phase methyl radicals is the only reaction observed for methoxy on highly oxidized Mo(110), on the surface oxygen overlayers competition between dehydrogenation and methyl evolution is highly sensitive to oxygen coverage. The enhanced selectivity for hydrocarbon formation from methanol reaction on oxygen-modified Mo(110) relative to the clean surface is attributed to inhibition of dehydrogenation pathways rather than to marked changes in the C-O bond potential of methoxy.

Three different compositions, namely, NiCoMnO4, Ni1.5Co0.72Mn0.75O4, and Ni2Co0.5Mn0.5O4 were prepared by a simple template-free hydrothermal route followed by a thermal treatment in air at 600 degrees C. The ORR/OER activity and the stability of these ternary metal oxides strongly depend on the composition of transition metals. The best performing Ni1.5Co0.75Mn0.75O4 catalyst exhibits modest OER and ORR activity with an over potential difference (Delta E = E-ORR-E-OER) of 0.79 V vs. RHE between two reactions in alkaline solution, comparable to expensive and supported IrO2, Pt catalysts. Electrochemical studies and extensive physical characterizations indicated that amount of nickel substituted in the crystal lattice influence the bifunctional catalytic activity of the studied ternary metal oxide compositions.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000468710500026

Cyclic voltammetry curves in 1-M KOH aqueous solution indicate that the (110) film has the highest activity for oxygen evolution and reduction reactions. An expansion of the La0.8Sr0.2CoO3 lattice is observed after the oxygen reduction process, indicating the formation of oxygen defects, with the highest number of defects being produced in the (110) film. X-ray reflectivity analysis demonstrates the formation of a surface layer on the La0.8Sr0.2CoO3 films during electrochemical cycling due to the decomposition of La0.8Sr0.2CoO3.

First of all, our previous broken-symmetry (BS) molecular orbitals (MO) calculations are reviewed to elucidate the instability of the d pi-p pi bond in high-valent (HIV) Mn(X)=O systems and the d pi-p pi-d pi bond in HV Mn=O=Mn systems. The triplet instability of these bonds entails strong or intermediate diradical characters: center dot Mn(IV)=O center dot and center dot Mn-O-Mn center dot; the BS MO resulted from strong electron correlation, leading to the concept of electron localizations and local spins. The BS computations have furthermore revealed guiding principles for derivation of selection rules for radical reactions of local spins. As a continuation of these theoretical results, the BS MO interaction diagrams for oxygen-radical coupling reactions in the oxygen evolution complex (OEC) in the PSII have been depicted to reveal scope and applicability of local singlet diradical (LSD) and local triplet diradical (LTD) mechanisms that have been successfully utilized for theoretical understanding of oxygenation reactions mechanisms by p450 and methane monooxygenase (MMO). The manganese-oxide cluster models examined are London, Berlin, and Berkeley models of CaMn4O4 and related clusters Mn4O4 and Mn3Ca. The BS MO interaction diagrams have revealed the LSD and/or LTD mechanisms for generation of molecular oxygen in the total low-, intermediate and high-spin states of these clusters. The spin alignments are found directly corresponding to the spin-coupling mechanisms of oxygen-radical sites in these clusters. The BS UB3LYP calculations of the clusters have been performed to confirm the comprehensive guiding principles for oxygen evolution; charge and spin densities by BS UB3LYP are utilized for elucidation and confirmation of the LSD and LTD mechanisms. Applicability of the proposed selection rules are examined in comparison with a lot of accumulated experimental and theoretical results for oxygen evolution reactions in native and artificial PSII systems.

Herein we report the synthesis of nickel boride layers supported on a nickel plate via a direct solid boronization of the nickel substrate with amorphous boron powder. The resulting boronized nickel plate was studied systematically to illustrate its surface structural evolution and activity variation during the OER. The initial electrochemical OER testing process resulted in the in situ generation on the nickel boride of thin nanosheet films that consist of metaborate-containing oxyhydroxides, as the efficient catalytically active phase. Correspondingly, this electrochemically activated, boronized nickel plate exhibits a nearly ten-fold increase in catalytic activity compared to the nickel plate, and shows remarkable catalytic stability for over 1500 hours. The enhanced catalytic performance during electrochemical activation is attributed to synergistic catalytic effects from the thin nanosheet structural features of the oxyhydroxides (i.e., geometric optimization) and modification of the electronic structure of the oxyhydroxides by metaborates (i.e., electronic optimization). Our results provide new insights into boride-based oxygen evolution electrocatalysts, and provide a new strategy for the design of high-performance electrocatalytic materials for the OER.									45	1	0	0	2	0	45			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463824300017

To fulfill highly active site exposure and optimized intrinsic activity, the 2-dimensional NiS2/CeO2 with unique heterostructure and abundant sulfur and oxygen vacancies (v-NiS2/CeO2 HS) was prepared by solvothermal reaction and annealing. The density functional theory calculations illustrate that the materials with both heterostructure and vacancies simultaneously have a positive effect on promoting the kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction and optimizing the adsorption energy of hydrogen. As a result, v-NiS2/CeO2 HSs deliver the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at the low overpotential of 271 mV for oxygen evolution reaction and the overpotential required by v-NiS2/CeO2 HSs for hydrogen evolution reaction is 123 mV (at 10 mA/cm(2)). The v-NiS2/CeO2 HSs demand a lower cell voltage with 1.64 V (at 10 mA/cm(2)) toward overall water splitting. These results provide a theoretical and practical direction for the development of low-cost, earth-abundant electrocatalysts. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, atomically-thin nickel-doped spinel cobalt oxide (NCO) was prepared as OER/ORR catalyst through a simple hydrothermal method. Electrochemical test results show that the NCO nanosheets exhibit bifunctional catalytic performances with the overpotential of 275 mV for OER and the onset-potential of 0.92 V for ORR. Moreover, the assembled Zn-air battery based on the material exhibit excellent performance among transition metal oxides based oxygen electrocatalysts. Characterization results demonstrate that the Ni dopants contribute to creating the oxygen vacancies and promoting the electron transfer from nickel to cobalt. More importantly, the ratio of Co2+ and Ni3+ in the octahedral oxygen gap are significantly increased, which serve as the active sites for ORR and OER, respectively. In addition, the 2D nanostructure and Ni dopants help to facilitate the charge transfer during the reaction and the real active species of OER process is more biased towards Ni ions which were proven by in-situ Raman. This work offers a strategy for preparing highly active and durable spinel transition metal oxides materials for bifunctional oxygen catalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000774914800006

Tailoring the d-band center is thought to be an effective strategy to promote the electrocatalytic activity. However, the current catalysts usually present the high absorption energy for water molecules. To solve this issue, we report heterogeneous Cr-doped NiCoP electrocatalysts. Due to the high conductivity of Cr ions, the prepared catalysts possess excellent hydrogen evolution performance in wide pH ranges. For alkaline environment, the overpotential is only 50.9 mV. Meanwhile, CreNiCoP-0.45 samples possess the overpotential of 279 mV@50 mA cm-2 for oxygen evolution reaction. They deliver a cell voltage of 1.70 V at 50 mA cm-2 for water splitting. Density functional theory calculation results confirm that Cr doping can not only promote the charge transfer but also reduce the d-band center.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we report a laser-induced graphene (LIG) process to fabricate efficient catalytic electrodes on opposing faces of a plastic sheet, for the generation of both H-2 and O-2. The high porosity and electrical conductivity of LIG facilitates the efficient contact and charge transfer with the requisite electrolyte. The LIG-based electrodes exhibit high performance for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction with excellent long-term stability. The overpotential reaches 100 rnA/cm(2) for HER, and OER is as low as 214 and 380 mV with relatively low Tafel slopes of 54 and 49 mV/dec, respectively. By serial connecting of the electrodes with a power source in an O-ring setup, H-2 and O-2 are simultaneously generated on either side of the plastic sheet at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at 1.66 V and can thereby be selectively captured. The demonstration provides a promising route to simple, efficient, and complete water splitting.									77	5	0	0	3	0	81			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000408178400021	28753271

Herein, a novel high-performance oxygen electrode catalyst is developed based on bimetal FeCo nanoparticles encapsulated in in situ grown nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon nanotubes with bamboo-like structure. The obtained catalyst exhibits a positive half-wave potential of 0.92 V (vs the reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) for oxygen reduction reaction, and a low operating potential of 1.73 V to achieve a 10 mA cm(-2) current density for oxygen evolution reaction. The reversible oxygen electrode index is 0.81 V, surpassing that of most highly active bifunctional catalysts reported to date. By combining experimental and simulation studies, a strong synergetic coupling between FeCo alloy and N-doped carbon nanotubes is proposed in producing a favorable local coordination environment and electronic structure, which affords the pyridinic N-rich catalyst surface promoting the reversible oxygen reactions. Impressively, the assembled zinc-air batteries using liquid electrolytes and the all-solid-state batteries with the synthesized bifunctional catalyst as the air electrode demonstrate superior charging-discharging performance, long lifetime, and high flexibility, holding great potential in practical implementation of new-generation powerful rechargeable batteries with portable or even wearable characteristic.									653	43	0	0	23	0	655			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000404751700007

Herein we report an evident improvement of oxygen evolution reaction activity via incorporating iron and vanadium into nickel hydroxide lattices. X-ray photoelectron/absorption spectroscopies reveal the synergistic interaction between iron/vanadium dopants and nickel in the host matrix, which subtly modulates local coordination environments and electronic structures of the iron/vanadium/nickel cations. Further, in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopic analyses manifest contraction of metal-oxygen bond lengths in the activated catalyst, with a short vanadium-oxygen bond distance. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the vanadium site of the iron/ vanadium co-doped nickel (oxy)hydroxide gives near-optimal binding energies of oxygen evolution reaction intermediates and has lower overpotential compared with nickel and iron sites. These findings suggest that the doped vanadium with distorted geometric and disturbed electronic structures makes crucial contribution to high activity of the trimetallic catalyst.									430	29	0	0	27	0	433			2041-1723			WOS:000439426100012	30038335

Here we successfully applied soft X-ray spectroscopy to follow in operando the valence and spin state of the Co ions in Li2Co2O4 under oxygen evolution reaction (OER) conditions. We have observed that a substantial fraction of the Co ions undergo a voltage-dependent and time-dependent valence state transition from Co3+ to Co4+ accompanied by spontaneous delithiation, whereas the edge-shared Co-O network and spin state of the Co ions remain unchanged. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the highly oxidized Co4+ site, rather than the Co3+ site or the oxygen vacancy site, is mainly responsible for the high OER activity. Determining catalyst electronic structures during electrochemical reactions is crucial to understand mechanisms. Here authors perform in operando soft X-ray spectroscopy on a cobalt oxide catalyst during O-2 evolution and observe voltage and time-dependent valence state transitions.									65	1	0	0	6	0	65			2041-1723			WOS:000558820800002	32332788

It was shown that the mechanism of the oxygen evolution is potential sensitive. At potentials negative to 1.12 V vs. SCE all the evolved oxygen originates from the electrolyte solution. At higher potentials an additional mechanism involving an exchange of the oxygen between electrolyte and electrocatalyst starts to apply. The extent of this oxygen exchange mechanism reflects the chemical composition of the electrocatalyst and is significantly higher at Ru0.9Ni0.1O2-delta electrodes. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the efficiency-limiting process in plenty of key renewable energy systems, such as electrochemical water splitting and rechargeable metal-air batteries. In this regard, ongoing efforts have been devoted to seeking high-performance electrocatalysts for enhanced energy conversion efficiency. Apart from traditional precious-metal-based catalysts, nickel-based compounds are the most promising earth-abundant OER catalysts, attracting ever-increasing interest due to high activity and stability. In this review, the recent progress on nickel-based oxide and (oxy)hydroxide composites for water oxidation catalysis in terms of materials design/synthesis and electrochemical performance is summarized. Some underlying mechanisms to profoundly understand the catalytic active sites are also highlighted. In addition, the future research trends and perspectives on the development of Ni-based OER electrocatalysts are discussed.									117	8	0	0	3	0	118			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000456280800005	30024645

Nevertheless, the inherent high reaction energy barrier and four-electron mechanism of anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) result in higher reaction overpotential, slower reaction rate, and more power consumption, affording low hydrogen evolution efficiency in the cathodic half reaction. This considerably limits practical applications. Manganese-based oxides (MnOx) show great promise for driving OER due to their worthwhile intrinsic properties, such as well-controlled morphology, structure, and electronic state. Moreover, a large number of unsaturated edge sites on the surface of MnO(x)can not only improve the active area to increase the number of active sites, but they also help adsorb OH(-)in alkaline solutions, thereby facilitating oxygen production. From this perspective, we review the emerging applications of a series of MnO(x)materials as highly efficient electrocatalysts for OER. By highlighting the reaction mechanisms, superiorities, and challenges of each type of MnOx, we hope to provide guidance for constructing more efficient MnO(x)electrocatalysts and reveal the bright future for future applications in the highly exciting energy-conversion-related areas.									77	3	0	0	2	0	78			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000553632500004

Herein, a high-performance bifunctional electrode formed by vertically depositing a porous nanoplate array on the surface of nickel foam is provided, where the nanoplate is made up by the interconnection of trinary Ni-Fe-Mo suboxides and Ni nanoparticles. The amorphous Ni-Fe-Mo suboxide and its in situ transformed amorphous Ni-Fe-Mo (oxy)hydroxide acts as the main active species for HER and OER, respectively. The conductive network built by Ni nanoparticles provides rapid electron transfer to active sites. Moreover, the hydrophilic and aerophobic electrode surface together with the hierarchical pore structure facilitate mass transfer.

Heteroatom doped carbon-based materials exhibit a promising strategy to achieve the bifunctionality within one catalyst. Herein, we report a highly efficient Fe-N-C oxygen redox catalyst derived from a new class of Fe coordinated bis(imino)-pyridine ligand based polymer synthesized via Schiff base condensation between 2,6-diacetylpyridine and 1,8-diaminonaphthalene. The Fe-N-C catalyst prepared by this precursor without templates or supports is characterized by spherical structure, ultrahigh specific surface area up to 1796.0 m(2)/g, a high degree of graphitization and atomically dispersed five-coordinated Fe-N-5 sites. These unique features endow the catalyst with outperforming performance for ORR and OER in terms of remarkable activity and stability in both alkaline and acidic media. The overall oxygen redox activity (Delta E = E-j=10 - E-1/2) (0.70 V in alkaline media and 0.86 V in acidic media) of the catalyst for both ORR and OER is much higher than those of none precious metal catalysts previously reported. These outstanding features remark the great possibility of the introduced catalyst for the practical application. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we report an ultrafine iridium oxide supported on boron-doped carbon nanotubes with rich defects for high-efficiency hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions and overall water splitting at all pH values. Theoretical study shows that the excellent OER and HER activities of ultrafine IrO2 nanoparticles can be attributed to their enhanced redox abilities comparing to those of bulk IrO2 catalysts. Under OER conditions, the O-excessive surface of ultrafine IrO2 nanoparticles weakens the binding strengths of oxygenated species, leading to enhanced OER activity. Under HER conditions, the surface of the IrO2 nanoparticle will be reduced to an intermediate state between Ir oxide and Ir metal, which greatly enhances the H binding energy and thus improves HER activity (even higher than Pt(1 1 1)).									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000663662600005

Herein, synthesized, porous, perovskite-type Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta hollow nanofibers (SSC-HF) are hybridized with cross-linked, 3D, N-doped graphene (3DNG). This rationally designed hybrid catalyst, SSC-HF-3DNG (SSC-HG), exhibits a remarkable enhancement in ORR/OER activity in alkaline media. The synergistic effects between SSC and 3DNG during their ORR and OER processes are firstly revealed by density functional theory calculations. It suggests that electron transport from 3DNG to O-2 and SSC increases the activity of electrocatalytic reactions (ORR and OER) by activating O-2, increasing the covalent bonding of lattice oxygen. This electron transfer-accelerated catalysis behavior in SSC-HG will provide design guidelines for composites of perovskite and carbon with bifunctional catalysts.									82	3	0	0	4	0	82			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000451566800012	30226302

Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations showed the unique interconnected and mesoporous structure. When employed as anode materials for lithium ion batteries, mesoporous Co3O4 nanoflakes delivered a high specific capacity of 883 mAh/g at 0.1C current rate and stable cycling performances even at higher current rates. Post-mortem analysis of ex situ FESEM images revealed that the mesoporous and interconnected structure had been well maintained after long-term cycling. The mesoporous Co3O4 nanoflakes also showed both OER active properties and good catalytic stability. This could be attributed to both the stability of unique mesoporous structure and highly reactive facets.									149	7	0	0	6	0	153			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000349580800037	25584769

Electro-oxidation of ammonia induces inhibition of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to adsorption of the ammonia oxidation products on the BDD surface. The inhibition of the OER enhances ammonia electro-oxidation, which becomes the main reaction. The amino radicals, formed during ammonia oxidation, trigger a reaction chain in which molecular oxygen dissolved in solution is involved in the ammonia electro-oxidation. Nitrogen, nitrous oxide, and nitrogen dioxide were detected as the ammonia oxidation products, with nitrogen being the main gaseous product of the oxidation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

B	Abbott, D.F.								The Rational Design of Selective Electrocatalysts for Renewable Energy Devices								The Rational Design of Selective Electrocatalysts for Renewable Energy Devices								174 pp	174 pp						2015	2015	The rational design of electrocatalysts is paramount to the development of electrochemical devices. In particular, modifications to the structure and electronic properties of a particular catalyst can have a strong influence on the activity and selectivity towards various electrochemical reactions or pathways. In many cases this can lead to a particular reaction pathway being opened or closed, the formation of intermediates being stabilized or inhibited, the adsorption of poisonous species being mitigated, or the removal of poisonous species being promoted. In the this dissertation the design and characterization of catalysts for electrochemical devices (fuel cells, electrolyzers, and hydrogen pumps) will be discussed with regards to tailoring the selectivity in order to promote or inhibit certain electrochemical reactions. The electrochemical reactions of primary interest will include the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR).									0	0	0		0	0	0					978-13-216-9004-0	INSPEC:15325309

Accompanying the urgent need for clean and sustainable technologies for energy storage and conversion, as well as the fast improvement of the chemical stability of these materials, MOFs and their composites are emerging as unique electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, and some other redox reactions. This review summaries representative progress and focuses on the structure-property relationships. Combining the advantages of inorganic heterogeneous and molecular homogeneous catalysts, MOFs can serve as a promising platform for achieving high electrocatalytic performances and studying the electrocatalytic mechanisms. More attention should be devoted to designing new MOFs with high chemical stability and electric conductivity, and optimizing their crystal growth on conducting substances. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, the atomically thick ultrathin Rh2O3 nanosheet nanoassemblies (Rh2O3-NSNSs) were obtained by oxidizing the atomically thick ultrathin Rh nanosheet nanoassemblies with HClO. For the first time, Rh-based nanostructures were used as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst in an alkaline medium. Surprisingly, the as-prepared Rh2O3-NSNSs displayed extremely improved catalytic activity and durability for the OER compared with those of the commercial Ir/C catalyst and most recently reported Ir-based electrocatalysts. The result indicated Rh-based nanostructures that have great promise to become a potential candidate for efficient OER electrocatalyst because of the similarity of Rh and Ir prices. These experimental results demonstrated the reasonable morphological control of Rh2O3 nanostructures could significantly improve their catalytic activity and durability during heterogeneous catalysis.									62	1	0	0	2	0	62			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000402498600050	28471161

The ORR plays a significant role in the performance of numerous energy-conversion devices, including low-temperature hydrogen and alcohol fuel cells, microbial fuel cells, as well as metal-air batteries. The viability of such fuel cells is strongly related to the cost of the electrodes, especially the cathodic ORR electrocatalyst. Hence, inexpensive and abundant plant and animal biomass have become attractive options to obtain electrocatalysts upon conversion into active carbon. Bioresource selection and processing criteria are discussed in light of their influence on the physicochemical properties of the ORR nanostructures. The resulting electrocatalytic activity and durability are introduced and compared to those from conventional Pt/C-based electrocatalysts. These ORR catalysts are also active for oxygen or hydrogen evolution reactions.									287	28	0	0	20	0	294			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000436455800007	29205520

The highresolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) demonstrates that the Zn and S substitution significantly stabilizes the layered structure and causes an increase in the electron density around the Co center. The role of both cation and anion substitution is evaluated to enhance the oxygen evolution reactions. This enhanced activity is due to the in-situ oxidation of divalent Co into trivalent Co, and partially due to the stabilization of the layered structure, as highlighted by PXRD and TEM analysis, the gap between the layers is slightly reduced from 7.8 A??? to 7.5 ???A, for S-Zn-Co(OH)2. The in-situ conversion of Co2+ to Co3+ during electrocatalysis improved the OER electrocatalysis. The structural and physical characterizations are performed via XRD, EDX, SEM, TEM, XPS, AFM and BET. ?? 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To promote the efficiency of such systems, engineering of the electrocatalyst interface is an effective strategy. In the fabrication toolbox for complex surface/interface, the advanced atomic-layer deposition (ALD) technique is superior to conventional methods, evidenced by precise control of thickness, composition, uniformity, etc. This review summarizes recent developments in ALD implementation in a variety of electrocatalytic systems, especially the electrode interface preparation and modulation. Beyond all doubt, the introduction of the ALD process could dramatically increase the number of electrocatalytic-active sites and hence improve the performance. However, its practical application in this field is open to deliberation, while process cost and complexity are in consideration.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2699-9412			WOS:000789463500001		
J	Lin Sheng-ling; Wang Jun-de; Xie Chun-sheng; Yan Zhi-ming								Study on the chemical electrode dynamics of complex oxide LaxSr1-xNiO3								Chinese Journal of Power Sources				27	3			318	21						May 2003	2003	LaxSr1-xNiO3, the ceramic powder of complex oxide with high specific surface area, was prepared by the glycine-nitrate process, a new combustion synthesizing method. It was used to prepare oxygen electrode and its cyclic voltammetry curves were mensurated. The results show that the electrode has the characteristics of bifunctional oxygen electrode and its catalytic activity is higher than that of the electrode consisting of nickel grid and ethyne black. Generally, the oxygen reduction and evolution is a two-electron chemical reaction. However, it will become a four-electron chemical reaction by adding KI catalyst and decreasing the area of Pt electrode in the 1 mol/L solution. According to the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve of LaxSr1-xNiO3 (x = 0.15, 0.70, 0.75, 1.00) functional oxygen electrode at various temperature, the chemical dynamic parameter In Ic and I/T, or -ln Va and 1/T, are both linear, while the activation energy of oxygen reduction and evolution are obtained. Oxygen is proved to be absorbed on the surface of functional oxygen electrode by changing the scanning rate and analyzing the CV curves. When 8.6 times 10-3 g/mL KI was added, two oxidation peaks change into one and the potential of oxygen evolution is decreased from 0.94 V to 0.62 V ( vs. saturated calomel electrode), whereas the oxygen reduction peak is also descended sharply. The oxygen electrode will be more efficient by decreasing the area of Pt electrode, heating the solution and adding KI catalyst.									0	1	0		0	0	1			1002-087X			INSPEC:7826939

To reduce the energy consumption and cost of these advanced technologies, various transition metal-based nanomaterials, like metal oxides/hydroxides, nitride, and phosphide are synthesized. Among these, metal-organic framework (MOF)-based materials are considered as the ideal candidate for the fabrication of efficient OER electrocatalysts owing to their unique physicochemical properties. In this review, the fundamental catalytic mechanisms and key evaluation parameters of OER in acidic and alkaline media are presented first.

To reduce cost and enhance stability of electrocatalysts, intensive works have been done in recent decades. Although research on noble-metal free electrocatalysts has achieved great progress, their full water splitting performance is still incomparable to that of noble metal based catalysts. For this reason, reducing content of noble metal in catalysts is a more practical way. In this work, we report our recent progress on developing bifunctional electrocatalyst based on nitrogen-doped graphene chainmail wrapped IrCo alloy particles on nitrogen-doped graphene (NG@IrCo/NG). Benefited from strong interaction among iridium, cobalt and nitrogen-doped graphene, impressively high electrocatalytic activity of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in both acid and alkaline solutions, which are comparable to commercially used Pt/C and IrO2 electrocatalysts respectively, is found. Catalyst with the structure of nitrogen doped chainmail wrapping on metal core is found to have highly stable full water splitting performance.									14	2	0	0	1	0	14			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000497857800010

Herein, sulfur vacancy-rich Ni3S2 on two dimensional MXene (VS-Ni3S2 @MN) is fabricate as a bifunctional catalyst for LOBs. The introduction of sulfur vacancy via Ar plasma bombards exposes massive coordination unsaturated sites on the surface of V-S-Ni3S2@MN, which is available for deposition and decomposition of uniformly distributed Li2O2 during oxygen reduction reactions and oxygen evolution reactions, thus efficiently decreasing overpotentials and ameliorating round-trip efficiency. In addition, theoretical calculations confirm that sulfur vacancies as the active sites can memorably improve the intrinsic appetency of intermediates and thus fundamentally adjust the deposition mechanism of Li2O2. Specifically, LOBs with the V-S-Ni3S2@MN electrode afford remarkably decreased overpotential (0.77 V) and improved long-term cyclic stability (200 cycles with current density 400 mA g(-1)). This work provides a unique view that the regulation of intermediate adsorption via surface vacancies is a practical strategy for enhancing the performance of the LOBs and sheds new light on designing oxygen electrode materials.									15	0	0	0	3	0	15			2405-8297			WOS:000667459600005

Here we explore the stability and reaction mechanisms of synthesized one-dimensional transition metal dithiolene wire (TM-DWs, TM = Cr - Cu, Rh, Ir, Pt, Pd) for the ORR and the OER in acid solution by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our calculations reveal that CoDW intrinsically exhibits high catalytic activity for bi-functional ORR/OER with low limiting overpotentials (g) of 0.46/0.45 V via four-electron reactions. These low limiting overpotentials arise from modified scaling relations by strengthening the binding free energy of OOH* compared to OH* on TM-DWs, yielding universal minimum ORR/OER overpotentials of g = 0.28/0.22 V, remarkably decreased compared to both metal and oxide surfaces (gideal = 0.37 V). By applying uni-axial strain, the adsorption strength of reaction intermediates on TM reactive sites can be optimized due to shifts in d-band centers. Our findings provide valuable insight into rational design of non-precious metals based electrocatalysts, and demonstrate a new strategy of tuning adsorptions via uni-axial strain to develop efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts of ORR/OER under optimal conditions.

Low-cost spinel oxides have attracted increasing interest as alternatives to noble metal-based OER catalysts. A rational design of spinel catalysts can be guided by studying the structural/elemental properties that determine the reaction mechanism and activity. Here, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is found that the relative position of O p-band and M-Oh (Co and Ni in octahedron) d-band center in ZnCo2-xNixO4 (x = 0-2) correlates with its stability as well as the possibility for lattice oxygen to participate in OER. Therefore, it is testified by synthesizing ZnCo2-xNixO4 spinel oxides, investigating their OER performance and surface evolution. Stable ZnCo2-xNixO4 (x = 0-0.4) follows adsorbate evolving mechanism under OER conditions. Lattice oxygen participates in the OER of metastable ZnCo2-xNixO4 (x = 0.6, 0.8) which gives rise to continuously formed oxyhydroxide as surface-active species and consequently enhances activity.

Here, a new Co-Fe-B ternary catalyst with improved crystallinity is successfully synthesized by combining the chemical reduction and subsequent solid-state reaction method. Synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicate the electronic structure redistribution is favor for the improved performance. The overpotential is only 129 mV and 280 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline condition, the corresponding Tafel slope is 67.3 mV dec(-1) and 38.9 mV dec(-1). Density functional theory calculations distinguish that the ternary crystalline Co-Fe-B catalysts are thermodynamically favorable for HER and OER. The actual active species of the ternary catalyst in OER is the CoOOH and FeOOH as indicated in ex situ Raman spectra. The present work may introduce promising crystallinity borides material for the anode and cathode of water splitting device. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

In this work, bimetallic nickel-iron carbonate hydroxide arrays were strongly grown on a conductive carbon cloth (NiFeCH/CC) through a facile one-step hydrothermal method, which were used as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Ni0.8Fe0.2CH/CC requires overpotential of just 246 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), Tafel slope of 43 mV dec(-1), and charge transfer resistance of 3.1 omega for OER in 1 M KOH. The catalyst also shows excellent durability by a long-term operation for 10 h. A post-OER study of Ni0.8Fe0.2CH/CC reveals that the NiFeOOH species form on the surface during OER and the carbonate ions still intercalate between the cationic layers. Benefiting from a three-dimensional structure and Fe doping strategy, the performance of Ni0.8Fe0.2CH/CC has been improved. This work provides an effective strategy to design efficient OER electrocatalysts in alkaline media.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2365-6549			WOS:000826508500001

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A dual-phase nickel selenide bifunctional water electrolysis catalyst comprises both a nickel selenide (NiSe2) phase (A) and a nickel selenide (Ni3Se4) phase (B). The catalyst is prepared by changing the quality of selenium powder to adjust the ratio of the two phases in the catalyst. The dual-phase bifunctional water electrolysis catalyst is grown on the foamed nickel, and is denoted as nickel selenide/nickel fluoride (NiSe2/Ni3Se4/NF). Also claimed is preparation of the dual-phase nickel selenide water catalyst, which involves (a) ultrasonically treating three nickel foam with a size of 2.5x4 cm2 with 3 mol/L hydrochloric acid solution, deionized water and ethanol for 30, 5 and 10 minutes, drying at 50degrees Celsius for 6 hours, immersing a nickel foam in a PTFE autoclave containing 35 ml of 1 mmol/L dipotassium hydrogen phosphate solution, hydrothermally treating at 180degrees Celsius for 12 hours, naturally cooling to room temperature, washing with deionized water and drying at 50degrees Celsius for 6 hours, putting the obtained green precursor nickel foam into a PTFE autoclave containing 30 mL potassium hydroxide aqueous solution with a concentration of 0.1 mol/L, hydrothermally reacting at 120degrees Celsius for 5 hours, and washing with deionized water at 50degrees Celsius, drying it overnight to obtain a light gray catalyst nickel(II) hydroxide/nickel fluoride, (b) placing the nickel(II) hydroxide/nickel fluoride obtained in (a) in a porcelain boat downstream of the tube furnace, and placing the selenium powder with a mass of 0.1-0.5 g in the tube furnace upstream of the furnace, raising the temperature to 250-450degrees Celsius at a heating rate of 3degrees Celsius/minute in a nitrogen atmosphere, then keeping it warm until the selenium powder is completely sublimated, and cooling to room temperature to prepare the catalyst nickel selenide/nickel fluoride surface (NiSe2/Ni3Se4/NF).

Perovskite oxides are a popular category of OER catalysts, while their activity remains insufficient under the conventional adsorbate evolution reaction scheme where scaling relations limit activity enhancement. The lattice oxygen-mediated mechanism (LOM) has been recently reported to overcome such scaling relations and boost the OER catalysis over several doped perovskite catalysts. However, direct evidence supporting the LOM participation is still very little because the doping strategy applied would introduce additional active sites that may mask the real reaction mechanism. Herein, a dopant-free, cation deficiency manipulation strategy to tailor the bulk diffusion properties of perovskites without affecting their surface properties is reported, providing a perfect platform for studying the contribution of LOM to OER catalysis. Further optimizing the A-site deficiency achieves a perovskite candidate with excellent intrinsic OER activity, which also demonstrates outstanding performance in rechargeable Zn-air batteries and water electrolyzers. These findings not only corroborate the key role of LOM in OER electrocatalysis, but also provide an effective way for the rational design of better catalyst materials for clean energy technologies.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18				2198-3844		WOS:000770788400001	35306740

Herein, an interpolation principle is proposed to activate CoOOH via W doping and Co vacancies for the oxygen evolution reaction. Density functional theory suggests opposite roles for the W dopant and the Co vacancy but a synergy between them in tuning the electronic states of the Co site, leading to near-ideal intermediate energetics and dramatically lowered catalytic overpotential. Experimental studies confirm the modulation of the electronic structure and validate the greatly enhanced catalytic activity with a small overpotential of 298.5 mV to drive 50 mA cm(-2). The discovery of the interpolation between dopants and vacancies opens up a new methodology to design efficient catalysts for various electrochemical reactions.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000720242500001	34693576

Nevertheless, the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions limit the commercial development of ZABs, so it is of great significance to develop efficient, low-cost and non-noble metal bifunctional catalysts. Electrospun one-dimensional nanofibers with unique properties such as high porosity and large surface area have great advantages on possessing more active sites, shortening the diffusion pathways for ions/electrons, and improving the kinetics via intercalation/de-intercalation processes, which endow them with promising application in the field of energy storage devices, especially ZABs. This review firstly introduces the electrospinning technique. Then, the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction triggered by electrospun nanofibers with self-supported structures are presented, followed by the application of electrospun nanofibers for liquid and flexible solid-state ZABs. Finally, the remaining challenges and research directions of ZABs based on electrospun nanofibers electrocatalysts are briefly discussed.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2524-7921	2524-793X		WOS:000723500300002

Iridium-based oxides are the state-of-the-art acidic oxygen evolution reaction catalysts but still suffer from inadequate activity and stability, and iridium's scarcity motivates the discovery of catalysts with lower iridium loadings. Here we report a mass-selected iridium-tantalum oxide catalyst prepared by a magnetron-based cluster source with considerably reduced noble-metal loadings beyond a commercial IrO2 catalyst. A sensitive electrochemistry/mass-spectrometry instrument coupled with isotope labelling was employed to investigate the oxygen production rate under dynamic operating conditions to account for the occurrence of side reactions and quantify the number of surface active sites. Iridium-tantalum oxide nanoparticles smaller than 2 nm exhibit a mass activity of 1.2 +/- 0.5 kA g(Ir)(-1) and a turnover frequency of 2.3 +/- 0.9 s(-1) at 320 mV overpotential, which are two and four times higher than those of mass-selected IrO2, respectively. Density functional theory calculations reveal that special iridium coordinations and the lowered aqueous decomposition free energy might be responsible for the enhanced performance.Low-cost, high-performance oxygen evolution catalysts would facilitate implementation of water electrolysers for hydrogen production. Here the authors report a low-iridium mass-selected iridium-tantalum oxide catalyst with high intrinsic activity in acid and carefully evaluate oxygen production to account for parasitic reactions.									23	0	0	0	1	0	23			2058-7546			WOS:000728458000001

ACS applied materials & interfaces				14	43			48598	48608		10.1021/acsami.2c11456				2022-Nov-02	2022	The kinetic-sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the main obstacle in electrocatalytic water splitting for sustainable production of hydrogen energy. Efficient water electrolysis can be ensured by lowering the overpotential of the OER by developing highly active catalysts. In this study, a controlled electrophoretic deposition strategy was used to develop a binder-free spinel oxide nanoparticle-coated Ni foam as an efficient electrocatalyst for water oxidation. Oxygen evolution was successfully promoted using the CoFe2O4 catalyst, and it was optimized by modulating the electrophoretic parameters. When optimized, CoFe2O4 nanoparticles presented more active catalytic sites, superior charge transfer, increased ion diffusion, and favorable reaction kinetics, which led to a small overpotential of 287 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm-2, with a small Tafel slope of 43 mV dec-1. Moreover, the CoFe2O4 nanoparticle electrode exhibited considerable long-term stability over 100 h without detectable activity loss. The results demonstrate promising potential for large-scale water splitting using Earth-abundant oxide materials via a simple and cheap fabrication process.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1944-8252		MEDLINE:36256595	36256595

But the oxygen vacancy strategy can inspire its electrocatalytic activity for HER because it has a positive effect on improving the charge transfer and compensating for the weak hydrogen adsorption of the tungsten trioxide. By synthesizing a series of substoichiometric tungsten oxides, we reveal the linear relationship between the catalytic activity and the content of oxygen vacancies, which indicates that the oxygen vacancy strategy is an achievable route to enhance the HER for metal oxides.

The electrolyzer voltage decreased to only 1.41 V@10 mA cm(-2) with the Ni9Fe1-LDHs anode. It was demonstrated that Fe induced the formation of Ni(III) on the surface and promoted the reversible Ni(II)/Ni(III) transition.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1566-7367	1873-3905		WOS:000821316400013

Herein, a novel class of three-dimensional (3D) CoMoOx/CoMoSx/CoSx (CoMoOS) nanoboxes (NBs) electrocatalysts with abundant interfaces is designed through a facile dissolution-regrowth and ion-exchange process employing ZIF-67 as the sacrificial template. Remarkably, the rich interfaces not only endow the CoMoOS with a high surface active area but also provide a "highway" for charge transport, thereby optimizing the binding strength of reaction intermediates on CoMoOS and drastically boosting the oxygen production. More interestingly, the unique nanobox structure also endows the catalyst with a 3D accessibility for reactants. As a result, the 3D CoMoOS NBs achieve not only an ultralow overpotential of 281 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), but also high-performance overall water electrolysis at alkaline media, with a cell potential of 1.58 V at 10 mA cm(-2).									125	5	0	0	2	0	126			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000514218900049

In this study, beta-Ni(OH)(2) nanoplates with abundant oxygen vacancies were synthesized via the hydrothermal method followed by a partial reduction reaction in a mild hydrogen atmosphere, and applied to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline solution. The beta-Ni(OH)(2) nanoplates prepared by partial reduction in a hydrogen atmosphere at 100 degrees C exhibited a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 340 mV in 1 M KOH; the overpotential was much lower than those required for pristine beta-Ni(OH)(2) nanoplates (391 mV) and air-treated beta-Ni(OH)(2) nanoplates (369 mV). Furthermore, the H-2-treated beta-Ni(OH)(2) nanoplates also displayed outstanding long-term stability even after 1000 cyclic voltammetry cycles. This excellent OER activity and stability could be ascribed to the abundant oxygen vacancies and a well-defined hexagonal structure. It is worth noting that this method will offer a facile synthesis of metal hydroxides for generating oxygen vacancy, improving the electrochemical performance of energy storage applications.

The electrochemical efficiency of the electrodes has been studied on the basis of electrochemical data obtained from steady-state polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques in 1 M NaOH solution at 298 K. The results were compared with those obtained on a Ni60Co40 commercial alloy. The overall experimental data indicate that alloying Ni-Co with Cr, Mn and Cu leads to an increase of electrocatalytic activity in oxygen evolution with respect to the Ni-Co alloy. High catalytic efficiencies were achieved on Ni60Co30Mn10 and Ni60Co30Cr10 electrodes, the latter being the best electrocatalyst for the OER. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The photocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution was investigated. The results show that 0.05% Pr3+ dopant can make the optic response range of WO3 catalysts expand to the visual light obviously. The analytical results of XPS indicate that Pr3+-doping can result in the increase of the density of surface oxygen vacancies of catalysts. In the experiment of water splitting to oxygen at the visible radiation, the rate for oxygen evolution of 0.05% Pr3+ doped WO3 is up to 196.64 mumol/(L.h), which is two times of that of pure WO3.									1	1	0	0	0	0	1			1004-0609			INSPEC:9872461

In this work, we use SrCoO3-delta (SCO) films as an example to demonstrate the structure evolution and the resulting catalytic degradation by varying the thickness. It was found that the insertion of oxygen into the sample led to a lattice shrink and caused a strain between the transformed perovskite SCO and the raw brownmillerite SCO. For films thinner than 20 nm, the P-SCO layer was pinned by the substrate. However, it was peeled off in thicker films due to the strain relaxation and resulted in laminate cracking and tilting along the out-of-plane direction. This microstructure damage suppressed the catalytic current flowing through the electrode and thus hampered the OER performance significantly. These findings indicate the importance of eliminating intrinsic strains for antidegradation in electrochemical electrodes.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2574-0962			WOS:000734165700001

Intensive investigations have recently focused on cobalt based complex/solid catalysts. Here, we have introduced a new type of cobalt-based WOC made of metal-organic frameworks where the redox function of cobalt centres was modified by imidazolate linkers for facilitating the proton transfer process. This cobalt-containing zeolitic imidazolate framework (Co-ZIF-9) has been demonstrated for the first time to electrocatalyze the oxygen evolution reaction in a wide pH range. The catalyst was found by theoretical calculation to be capable of activating the water molecule via binding the OH-group to the metal sites with low activation barriers, while the eliminated proton was accepted by the nearby benzimidazolate motifs. This allows Co-ZIF-9 to work effectively for the electrochemical oxygen-evolution reaction.									121	1	0	0	10	0	121			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000340520500003	25051349

However, their semiconducting nature necessitates the use of activated carbons as conductive supports to generate applicably relevant current densities. In efforts to advance the performance and theory of oxide electrocatalysts, the chemical and physical properties of the oxide material often take precedence over contributions from the conductive additive. In this work, we find that carbon plays an important synergistic role in improving the performance of La1-xSrxCoO3- (0 x 1) electrocatalysts through the activation of O-2 and spillover of radical oxygen intermediates, HO2- and O-2(-), which is further reduced through chemical decomposition of HO2- on the perovskite surface. Through a combination of thin-film rotating disk electrochemical characterization of the hydrogen peroxide intermediate reactions (hydrogen peroxide reduction reaction (HPRR), hydrogen peroxide oxidation reaction (HPOR)) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), surface chemical analysis, HR-TEM, and microkinetic modeling on La1-xSrxCoO3- (0 x 1)/carbon (with nitrogen and non-nitrogen doped carbons) composite electrocatalysts, we deconvolute the mechanistic aspects and contributions to reactivity of the oxide and carbon support.									16	1	0	0	1	0	16			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000459584900049	30688319

Until now, special emphasis has been placed on technology development for water electrolysis in acidic electrolytes, owing to the more facilitated hydrogen production under acidic conditions compared to alkaline water electrolysis. Among various catalyst design concepts, bifunctional catalysts capable of driving low overpotentials for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are particularly interesting, owing to the simplicity of cell system design and potential capital reduction for catalyst production. Therefore, it is intriguing to prepare bifunctional catalysts that are compatible with acidic electrolytes. In this Minireview, we introduce the recent progress in bifunctional catalysts for overall water electrolysis under acidic conditions. We briefly describe the merits of water electrolysis in acidic solution and summarize the preparation and performance of the state-of-the-art bifunctional catalysts towards both the acidic HER and OER. Finally, perspectives are provided for the current challenges and opportunities for bifunctional catalysts in acidic water electrolysis.									42	3	0	0	1	0	43			2196-0216			WOS:000475512500003

Herein, we report a reliable and facile anion-exchange reaction strategy for conversion of one-dimensional (1D) Co3O4 nanowires (NWs) into CoP porous nanowires (PNWs). Notably, such evolution process provides the as-formed CoP PNWs with significantly improved defect sites and thus endows the CoP PNWs with a high electrochemical activity surface area. Accordingly, the CoP PNWs exhibit outstanding catalytic activity toward HER and OER when serving as bifunctional electrocatalysts, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with low over potentials of 147 and 326 mV for HER and OER, respectively. We demonstrate the water splitting electrolyzer with such CoP PNWs electrocatalyst as cathode and anode can be driven by a double A battery and a solar panel (1.5 V). The advantages, including facile and low-cost synthetic process, high activity for HER and OER, endow the as-developed CoP PNWs to be one of the most promising candidates for full water splitting system.

Substitution of Ru by Ni has a minor. effect on the structural characteristics extractable from X-ray diffraction patterns. The electrocatalytic behavior of Ru1-xNixO2-y with respect to parallel oxygen (oxygen evolution reaction, OER) and chlorine (chlorine evolution reaction, CER) evolution in acidic media was studied by voltammetry combined with differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS). The DEMS data indicate a significant decrease of the over-voltage for chlorine evolution with respect to that of pure RuO2. The oxygen evolution is slightly hindered. The increasing Ni content affects the electrode material activity and selectivity. The overall material's activity increases with increasing Ni content. The activity of the Ru-Ni-O oxides towards Cl-2 evolution shows a distinguished maximum for material containing 10% of Ni. Further increase of Ni content results in suppression of Cl-2 evolution in favor of O-2 evolution. A model reflecting the cation-cation interactions resulting from Ni-doping is proposed to explain the observed trends in electrocatalytic behavior. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

It is essential to have a good bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst which can exhibit high activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this regard, Pt-Pb2Ru2O7-x is synthesized by depositing Pt on Pb2Ru2O7-x wherein Pt individually exhibits high ORR while Pb2Ru2O7-x shows high OER and moderate ORR activity. Pt-Pb2Ru2O7-x exhibits higher OER (eta(@10mAcm-2) = 0.25 +/- 0.01 V) and ORR (eta(@-3mAcm-2) = -0.31 +/- 0.02 V) activity in comparison to benchmark OER (IrO2, eta(@10mAcm-2) = 0.35 +/- 0.02 V) and ORR (Pt/C, eta(@-3mAcm-2) = -0.33 +/- 0.02 V) electrocatalysts, respectively. Pt-Pb2Ru2O7-x shows a lower bifunctionality index (eta(@10mAcm-2), OER - eta(@-3mAcm-2), ORR) of 0.56 V with more symmetric OER-ORR activity profile than both Pt (>1.0 V) and Pb2Ru2O7-x (0.69 V) making it more useful for the AEM (anion exchange membrane) URFC or metal-air battery applications. FG-URFC tested with Pt-Pb2Ru2O7-x and Pt/C as bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst and bifunctional hydrogen electrocatalyst, respectively, yields a mass-specific current density of 715 +/- 11 A/g(cat)(-1) at 1.8 V and 56 +/- 2 A/g(cat)(-1) at 0.9 V under electrolyzer mode and fuel-cell mode, respectively. The FG-URFC shows a round-trip efficiency of 75% at 0.1 A/cm(-2), underlying improvement in AEM FG-UR FC electrocatalyst design.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0027-8424			WOS:000705930300007	34593643

Herein, firstly, the Ni nanocubes precursor as a self-sustaining template is synthesized through a reflow method. Afterward, the nanocubic NiFe bimetallic organic frameworks was formed under the self-assembly approach between the exogenous Fe2+ and released Ni2+ from Ni nanocubes with terephthalic acid organic ligand on the Ni nanocubes precursor, i.e Ni nanocubes@MIL-53(NiFe). The synthesized Ni nanocubes@MIL-53(NiFe) exhibit excellent activity, which only requires the overpotential of 271 and 388 mV to deliver the current density of 20 and 100 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solution (1.0 M KOH). The noticeable catalytic performance can be ascribed to the aspects as following: 1) Ni nanocubes as a template provides a Ni source during the self-assembled process; 2) the metal-metal coupling effect arisen within the Ni and Fe atom is substantially contributed to the oxygen evolution reaction performance; 3) the abundant active sites, enhanced electron transport ability also endow the superior electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction activity; 4) rich carboxyl groups in the metal-organic frameworks structure could enhance the hydrophilicity of the catalysts.

In addition, cheap catalysts have associated overpotentials that render the reaction inefficient. This impels the search to discover novel catalysts for this reaction computationally. In this communication, we present machine learning algorithms to enhance the hypothetical screening of molecular OER catalysts. By predicting calculated binding energies using Gaussian process regression (GPR) models and applying active learning schemes, we provide evidence that our algorithm can improve computational efficiency by guiding simulations towards candidates with promising OER descriptor values. Furthermore, we derive an acquisition function that, when maximized, can identify catalysts that can exhibit theoretical overpotentials that circumvent the constraints imposed by linear scaling relations by attempting to enforce a specific mechanism. Finally, we provide a brief perspective on the appropriate sets of molecules to consider when screening complexes that could be stable and active for this reaction.</p>									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				1420-3049		WOS:000718614400001	34770771

In this work, such electrocatalysts are obtained, first in two-step hydrothermal reactions to form Ni3S2/MnS nanosheets on Ni foam (NF/Ni3S2/MnS), then by slightly electroxidizing the Ni3S2/MnS to generate tremella-like Ni3S2/MnS-O with ultrathin nanosheets and abundant oxygen vacancies (denoted as NF/T(Ni3S2 /MnS-O)) favorable for electrocatalyzing HER and OER. Benefiting from the abundant oxygen vacancies, tremella-like ultrathin nanosheets with hierarchical porous structure and large active surface area, NF/T(Ni3S2/MnS-O) shows high catalytic performance, including lower overpotential and electrochemistry stability for both HER and OER than so far reported MnOx and other metal oxides/sulfides. The NF/T(Ni3S2/MnS-O) directly used as bifunctional electrodes for overall water splitting exhibits a low voltage of 1.54 V with a low overpotential of 0.31 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a fast H-2 and O-2 evolution speed of 4.13 and 2.04 mu mol min(-1) and a good electrochemistry stability with unchanged current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for 50 h.									111	7	0	0	3	0	112			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000480669500014

Metal co-ordination complexes (MCCs) consisting of central metals and surrounding ligands generally possess abundant active sites owing to the rich boundaries between short-range crystalline components, making them promising candidates for tailored electrocatalysts. Herein, Ni/Fe based bimetallic MCCs with hybrid ligands are successfully constructed. With rich active sites residing in nanocrystal boundaries, bimetallic synergistic effect, and quick mass transfer derived from the nanosheet-like structure, excellent OER performance in terms of over-potential (229 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel slope (30 mV dce(-1)) is achieved. This unique architecture can shed light on the coordination design of highly efficient OER electrocatalysts.									20	0	0	0	2	0	20			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000621197400004

Our theoretical prediction that single atoms can be stabilized on the modified TiC surface is confirmed by experimental findings using them on a TiC support. The predicted activities where Pt and Au single atoms would be the best for hydrogen evolution and selective oxygen reduction reactions, respectively, agree well with experimental results. This rational strategy using computational modeling of materials enables effective design of highly active and stable single-atom catalysts.									68	11	0	0	0	0	70			2380-8195			WOS:000456493100016

A facile synthesis of CoFe layered double hydroxide (CoFe LDH) is reported as a highly active and stable oxygen evolution catalyst. By varying the concentration of the metal ion precursor, the Co/Fe ratios of LDH products can be tuned from 0.5 to 7.4. The structure and electrocatalytic activity of the obtained catalysts were found to show a strong de-pendence on the Co/Fe ratios. The Co2Fe1 LDH sample exhibited the best electrocatalytic performance for OER with an onset potential of 1.52 V (vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) and a Tafel slope of 83 mVdec(-1). The Co(2)Fe1 LDH was further loaded onto a Ni foam (NF) substrate to form a 3D porous architecture electrode, offering a long-term current density of 100 mAcm(-2) at 1.65 V (vs. RHE) towards the OER.									67	9	0	0	1	0	69			2192-6506			WOS:000398034000021	31962033

Ir-based nanomaterials are deemed as one of the most high-efficiency oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysts while the hydrogen evolution reaction performance is unfavorable. In this work, we report a one-pot hydrothermal synthesis of N-doped graphene anchored Ir nanoparticles (Ir/N-rGO) with ultrasmall particle size (similar to 2.0 nm). Apart from the predictably superior OER performance, the resultant Ir/N-rGO also displays excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance, requiring merely 76 and 260 mV overpotentials to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) towards HER and OER, respectively. When applied as the bifunctional electrodes for overall water splitting, Ir/N-rGO needs a lower overpotential (1.74 V) to achieve a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solution, exceeding that of Pt/C and RuO2 couple (1.85 V). Thus, the as-fabricated Ir/N-rGO has a commendable prospect in the practical application of alkaline water electrocatalysis. (c) 2021 Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Commonly used precious metal catalyst could not support the large scale application of these devices due to their high cost and limited stability. In this paper, we report the synthesis of a coordination polymer and its use for the preparation of oxygen electrocatalyst. Our results show that the use of the coordination polymer as catalyst precursor could results in a homogeneous catalyst with both high activity and good stability, which is close to that of commercial Pt/C catalyst. Our results show that the nitrogen doped carbon wrapped Fe3O4 could function as a promising oxygen catalyst in a variety of applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1452-3981			WOS:000406090700027

To address this, we introduce copper inverse opal (IO) frameworks offering a well-developed network of interconnected pores as highly conductive high-surface-area supports for thin catalytic coatings, for example, the extremely active but poorly conducting nickel-iron layered double hydroxides (NiFe LDH). Such composites exhibit significantly higher OER activity in 1 m KOH than NiFe LDH supported on a flat substrate or deposited as inverse opals. The NiFe LDH/Cu IO catalyst enables oxygen evolution rates of 100 mA cm(-2) (727 +/- 4 A g(catalyst)(-1)) at an overpotential of 0.305 +/- 0.003 V with a Tafel slope of 0.044 +/- 0.002 V dec(-1). This high performance is achieved with 2.2 +/- 0.4 mu m catalyst layers, suggesting compatibility of the inverse-opal-supported catalysts with membrane electrolyzers, in contrast to similarly performing 10(3)-fold thicker electrodes based on foams and other substrates.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000859608200001	35875904

Herein, we demonstrate that the double perovskite LaFexNi1-xO3 (LFNO) nanorods (NRs) can be adopted as highly active and stable OER electrocatalysts. The optimized LFNO-II NRs with Ni/Fe ratio of 8:2 achieve a low overpotential of 302 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 50 mV dec(-1), outperforming those of the commercial Ir/C. The LFNO-II NRs also show high OER stability with slight current decrease after 20 h. The enhanced activity is explained by the improved surface area, tailored electronic structure as well as strong hybridization between O and Ni.									116	13	0	0	5	0	121			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000458417700021	30609139

It discusses the possible evolution of the relevant cofactors needed for splitting water into molecular O-2 with respect to the following functional domains in PSII: the reaction center (RC), the oxygen evolving complex (OEC), and the manganese stabilizing protein (MSP). Possible ancestral sources of the relevant cofactors are considered, as are scenarios of how these components may have been brought together to produce the intermediate steps in the evolution of PSII. Most importantly, the driving forces that maintained these intermediates for continued adaptation are considered. We then apply our understanding of the evolution of PSII to the bioengineering of a water oxidizing catalyst for utilization of solar energy.									42	1	1	0	33	0	46			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000286199300006	20512415

The results show that anodic layer on Pb-Ag-RE anode formed in electrolyte with cr exhibits 'volcanic vent-like holes, and the metallic substrate in this electrolyte shows obvious localized corrosion feature with large numbers of corrosion pits. In addition, the presence of Cl- decreases the amount of PbO2 on the surface of anodic layer. It also inhibits the formation and adsorption of oxygen evolution intermediates, and further enhances the charge transfer resistance of oxygen evolution reaction. Therefore, Cl- is detrimental to the corrosion resistance and oxygen evolution reactivity of Pb-Ag-RE alloy anode. Consequently, the Cl- concentration in electrolyte should be reduced as low as possible during industrial operation.									4	2	0	0	0	0	6			0412-1961			WOS:000351982400015

This study developed a simple and efficient method to synthesize CoFe-PBA by directly growing the Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) precursor on a self-supporting electrode with a conductive substrate, which is further phosphorized into CoFe-P/NF electrocatalyst. The high conductivity and large surface area of NF could accelerate electron transmission and increase the number of active sites. Fe incorporation could also enhance electronic structure and optimize adsorbate energy. The obtained CoFe-P/NF exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for the OER in 1 M KOH, which only provides overpotentials of 264 and 278 mV at current densities of 100 and 200 mA cm-2, respectively, and exhibits excellent durability over 120 h.

To investigate this effect, we study the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on two possible reconstructed (001) surfaces of NaTaO3, by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and compare them with the non-polar (113) surface of the same material. For the clean surface the reconstruction has a beneficial effect on the catalytic activity, lowering the minimal overpotential from 0.88 V to 0.70 V while also changing the most active reaction site from Na to Ta. Under photocatalytic conditions, the Ta sites are covered by oxygen adsorbates, rendering lattice oxygen sites on the NaO terrace the most active with a very low overpotential of 0.32 V. An alternative reconstructed surface which is stable in contact with water leads to an oxygen coupling mechanism with an overpotential of 0.52 V. Our results show that terraced surface reconstruction enables novel reaction pathways with low overpotentials which did not exist on previously investigated non-polar NaTaO3 surfaces or on non-polar surfaces of chemically similar materials such as SrTaO2N.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000476599900014

Transition metal borides (TMBs) have displayed unique metalloid characteristic and outstanding performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the last few decades. Herein, recent developments of the TMBs for HER and OER are summarized. Initially, the impact factors and relevant evaluation of electrocatalytic performance are described, that is, overpotential, Tafel slope and exchange current density, stability, faradaic efficiency, turnover frequency, mass and specific activities. Moreover, the optimization strategies of borides are emphasized, which principally include coupling with effective substrates, elemental doping, phase modification, interfacial engineering, and morphology control. Finally, in order to reach the goal of application, the remaining challenges and perspectives are given to point out a direction for enhancing the performance of borides.									19	2	0	0	1	0	19				2575-0356		WOS:000670649300001

In recent years, increasing insights into the design of water electrolysers, fuel cells, and metal-air batteries emerge in response to the need for developing sustainable energy carriers, in which the oxygen evolution reaction and the oxygen reduction reaction play key roles. However, both reactions suffer from sluggish kinetics that restricts the reactivity. Therefore, it is vital to probe into the structure of the catalysts to exploit high-performance bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts. Spinel-type catalysts are a class of materials with advantages of versatility, low toxicity, low expense, high abundance, flexible ion arrangement, and multivalence structure. In this review, we afford a basic overview of spinel-type materials and then introduce the relevant theoretical principles for electrocatalytic activity, following that we shed light on the structure-property relationship strategies for spinel-type catalysts including electronic structure, microstructure, phase and composition regulation, and coupling with electrically conductive supports. We elaborate the relationship between structure and property, in order to provide some insights into the design of spinel-type bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts.

Herein, the authors demonstrate that engineering the hole transfer kinetic by embedding reduced graphene oxide (rGO) in the interface of light absorber (2D carbon nitride, 2D g-CN) and oxygen evolution cocatalysts (MOx, M = Fe, Co, Ni) can both tune the hole extraction rate and oxygen evolution performance. As a result of breaking the rate-determining step (i.e., oxygen evolution reaction) in overall water splitting, the optimal Pt/2D g-CN/rGO-FeOx photocatalyst can evolve H-2 and O-2 in pure water with the rates of 14.07 and 7.03 mu mol h(-1), respectively, showing roughly higher gas evolution rates and also excellent stability compared to the photocatalysts without hole transport engineering. This work reveals the feasibility of overall water splitting by tuning the oxygen evolution dynamic and affords a versatile strategy for designing cocatalyst/photocatalyst systems for efficient photocatalysis.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2196-7350			WOS:000710443200001

Development of new design strategy for NiFeOxHy electrode with respect to intrinsic activity and number of active species is highly attractive. Here we report a hierarchical fabrication for NiFeOxHy electrode towards efficient oxygen evolution. Three-dimensional mesoporous NiO was initially prepared and reduced to a polycrystalline Ni metal framework. Despite the poor OER activity for Ni-based catalyst, the incorporation of surface Fe species induced a notably high current density for the oxygen evolution. The results indicated that the Fe species, located at outer surface region, played a key role as the OER active sites. It is also found that the surface of metallic Ni was reconstructed to (oxy)hydroxide phase with ease compared to NiO. As a result, a heterostructure composed of an OER-active NiFe (oxy)hydroxide shell and an electron-conductive Ni core was formed. In this fabricated NiFeOxHy/Ni catalyst, the promoted intrinsic activity, number of active sites and charge-transfer ability all taken into account contribute to an efficient OER process.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000632009100001

Conventionally, it is considered as a passive reactant. In this work, we investigate the potential of plasmon-activated water (PAW) with intrinsically reduced hydrogen-bonded structures compared to normal deionized (DI) water to serve as an active green energy resource. The efficiency of the electrochemical oxidation of water performed on a platinum electrode to form hydrogen peroxide is significantly enhanced in PAW compared to that in DI water. In addition, the limiting current density of the oxygen reduction reaction on a platinum/carbon-coated disk electrode is also enhanced when using PAW (in 0.9 wt % NaCl or in 0.1 M KOH). Moreover, the cell capacitance with semitransparent platinum-coated fluorine-doped SnO2 electrodes is significantly increased from ca. 2 x 10(-9) to 6.1 x 10(-7) F when decreasing the applied frequency from 10 to 0.1 Hz in a cell containing PAW instead of DI water (without the supporting electrolyte). More interestingly, compared to that in DI water, the efficiencies of the hydrogen evolution reaction in an acid solution (0.05 M H2SO4) and the oxygen evolution reaction in an alkaline solution (0.1 M KOH) performed with PAW in situ increase by about 20% with nanoscale-granulated gold electrodes under resonant illumination. These increases are more significant in neutral solutions for hydrogen evolution reactions and oxygen evolution reactions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2470-1343			WOS:000470094000013	31459889

The FeCoN-MWCNT and FeMnN-MWCNT catalysts were prepared as cathodes and tested in anion-exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs).

Acidic active bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalyst determines the performance of asymmetric Zn-air battery greatly. Here, an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst is synthesized through the loading of coordination compound modified polyoxometalate on rice paper derived nitrogen doped carbon paper. This elctrocatalyst exhibits three-dimensional network with bulky appearance, which can be employed as air cathode in asymmetric Zn-air battery directly. In acidic electrolyte, it oxygen reduction reaction completes through a typical four-electron process. In oxygen evolution reaction, its overpotential is only 359 mV. With this electrocatalyst as air cathode and Zn plate as anode, an asymmetric Zn-air battery is assembled. The open circuit voltage of this battery is 2.09 V. Its peak power density achieves 349 mW cm(-2). When discharge at 20 mA cm(-2), its specific energy density reaches 1009 Wh.kg(-1). Furthermore, this battery keeps stable in long time chargedischarge experiments. This asymmetric Zn-air battery is superior to traditional Zn-air battery in both charge and discharge process.

Lollipop-shaped interconnected MnO2 nanotube/Co3O4 polyhedron composite derived from zeolitic-imidazolate framework-67 as an efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction								MATERIALS TODAY CHEMISTRY				26						101063	10.1016/j.mtchem.2022.101063				DEC 2022	2022	The development of efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great importance to energy-related necessities. Currently, the fabrication of precious metal-free electro-catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction is a desirable and challenging task for the widespread application of water splitting. In this work, a novel lollipop-like MnO2/Co3O4 composite is prepared as an electro-catalyst for enhanced oxygen evolution reaction by using zeolitic-imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) template. The ZIF-67 is grown on the open end of MnO2 nanotube and the obtained MnO2/ZIF-67 is then converted to MnO2/Co3O4 by simple calcination treatment under air atmosphere. The lollipop-like structure of the MnO2/Co3O4 composite was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), trans-mission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterizations. The lollipop-like structure consists of MnO2 nanotube and porous Co3O4 polyhedron that exhibited significant electrocatalytic activity with lowest onset potential (1.54 V vs. RHE), Tafel slope (69 mV/dec) and higher current density (84.9 mA/cm2) compared with MnO2/ZIF-67, Co3O4 and MnO2 catalyst. Therefore, it is evident that the MnO2/Co3O4 composite possesses enhanced OER activity and shows good electrochemical stability in alkaline medium, which makes it an efficient precious metal-free electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we examine from a computational point of view the possibility to improve the material's water-splitting capacity by forming composites with carbon nanotubes. Apart from providing natural channels for charge transport, the nanotubes can also play an important role as catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction. Our results show that in nanotube- Fe2O3 complexes the OER overpotential, which is prohibitively high in isolated carbon nanotubes, is substantially reduced. We also consider the effect of doping and vacancies on the reaction and find that under the energetically most favorable binding geometry the presence of oxygen vacancies can lead to an overpotential as low as 0.44 eV, nearly halfening the overpotential observed on pristine hematite surfaces.

Since non-noble metal electrocatalysts with satisfactory activities are not currently available, costs must be reduced by improving performance and durability of noble metal electrocatalysts. Moreover, it is mandatory to understand the mechanisms of oxygen evolution and find out how the reaction kinetics could be improved. Here the kinetic pathway for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on RuO2, IrO2 and RuIrCoOx surfaces is analyzed with electrochemical polarization and Density Functional Theory (DFT) analyses of the changes occurring when pure oxides are doped with Co and their effect during the first stages of oxygen evolution. Experimental electrochemical methods are used to find indicators of electrocatalyst quality: the lower the Tafel slope, the faster the reaction kinetics and the more active the electrocatalyst. It is found that RuIrCoOx surfaces show the lowest Tafel slope value, 0.068 v dec(-1), and the rate determining step at low overpotential is the second H-O breaking. Changes in electronic structure responsible of the sluggish second reduction step in comparison to the first are identified by the theoretical study. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We report, herein, a molybdenum and niobium codoped B-site-ordered double perovskite oxide with a compositional formula of Ba2CoMo0.5Nb0.5O6-delta (BCMN) as an active and robust catalyst for OER in an alkaline electrolyte. BCMN displayed a low overpotential of 445 mA at a current density of 10 mA cm(disk)(-2). BCMN also showed long-term stability in an alkaline medium.

Now a hybrid nanostructure has been decorated with CeOx nanoparticles on the surface of ZIF-67-derived hollow CoS through in situ generation. Proper control of the amount of CeOx on the surface of CoS can achieve precise tuning of Co2+/Co3+ ratio, especially for the induced defects, further boosting the OER activity. Meanwhile, the formation of protective CeOx thin layer effectively inhibits the corrosion by losing cobalt ion species from the active surface into the solution. It is thus a rare example of a hybrid hetero-structural electrocatalyst with CeOx NPs to improve the performance of the hollow TMS nanocage.									471	40	0	0	19	0	476			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000437668700052	29719107

The W:CoO catalyst displays an attractive performance for the oxygen evolution reaction in an alkaline solution. In an NaOH solution of pH13, W:CoO operates with a moderate onset overpotential of 230mV and requires 320mV overpotential to generate a catalytic current density of 10mAcm(-2). A low Tafel slope of 45mVdecade(-1) was determined, indicating a rapid O-2-evolving kinetics. The as-prepared W:CoO belongs to the best cobalt oxide-based catalysts ever reported for the oxygen evolution (OER) reaction.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000435773300002	29708656

These structural advantages help reduce the reaction potential and increase the diffusion rate and reaction rate in electrochemical energy storage and conversion.

Among many potential OER catalysts, the metal oxyhydroxides, especially FeOOH, show promising OER reactivity. In the present work, we performed a DFT + U study of the OER mechanism on the gamma-FeOOH (010) surface. In particular, we established the chemical potential of the OH- and hole pair and included the OH-anion in the reaction pathway, accounting to the alkaline conditions of anodic OER process. We then analyzed the OER pathways on the surface with OH-, O- and Fe-terminations. On the surface with OH-and O- terminations, the O-2 molecule could form from either OH reacting with the surface oxygen species (-OH* and -O* or the combination of two surface oxygen species. On the Fe-terminated surface, O-2 can only form by adsorbing OH on the Fe sites first. The potential-limiting step of the oxygen evolution with different surface terminations was determined by following the free-energy change of the elementary steps along each pathway. Our results show that oxygen formation requires recreating the surface Fe sites, and consequently, the condition that favors the partially exposed Fe sites will promote oxygen formation.

Herein, a facile hydrothermal method is developed to achieve the coupling of NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) film, forming an integrated flexible electrode for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The electrode requires a low overpotential of 250 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, and shows rapid reaction kinetics with a Tafel slope of 35 mV dec(-1). Advanced soft X-ray absorption near-edge structure measurements efficiently indicate strong interfacial electron coupling between the LDH and SWNT, which authentically contributes to superior OER performance. This work provides a new strategy to design binder-free and flexile electrodes for practical application.									34	6	0	0	2	0	35			2168-0485			WOS:000427092900013

The rapid development of two-dimensional transition metal chalcogenide (such as WO3, MoS(2)and WS2) nanostructures offers a hopeful strategy to increase the active edge sites and expedite the efficiency of electronic transport for hydrogen evolution reaction. Herein, we report a distinctive strategy to construct two-dimensional MoS2@dWO(3)heterostructure nanosheets by in situ wet etching. Synthesized oxygen-incorporated MoS2-was loaded on the surface of defective WO(3)square nanoframes with abundant oxygen vacancies. The resulting nanocomposite exhibits a low overpotential of 191 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)and a very low Tafel slope of 42 mV dec(-1)toward hydrogen evolution reaction. The long-term cyclic voltammetry cycling of 5000 cycles and more than 80,000 s chronoamperometry tests promises its outstanding stability. The intimate and large interfacial contact between MoS(2)and WO3, favoring the charge transfer and electron-hole separation by the synergy of defective WO(3)and oxygen-incorporated MoS2, is believed the decisive factor for improving the electrocatalytic efficiency of the nanocomposite. Moreover, the defective WO(3)nanoframes with plentiful oxygen vacancies could serve as an anisotropic substrate to promote charge transport and oxygen incorporation into the interface of MoS2. This work provides a unique methodology for designing and constructing excellently heterostructure electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction.									4	1	0	0	1	0	5				2073-4344		WOS:000580107800001

Such M-N-C electrocatalysts with M-N-x sites show good activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) but moderate activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, an oxygen-rich M-N-C material (O-Co-N/C) with a highly porous nanosheet structure is reported as a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst, which is prepared by the direct pyrolysis of ultrathin CoO nanosheets decorated with zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 nanoparticles under an inert atmosphere. Particularly, Co nanoparticles in the O-Co-N/C electrocatalyst contain both Co-N-x and Co-O-x coordination environments to provide intrinsic active sites for the ORR and OER, respectively. Furthermore, electrochemical studies show that the O-Co-N/C catalyst retains comparable ORR activity to common M-N-C materials with a half-wave potential of 0.85 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode and better OER activity with an overpotential of 0.29 V at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This study provides insights into the development of effective oxygen-involving electrocatalysts with bifunctional metal active centers coordinated by both nitrogen and oxygen atoms.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000764188500001

Here, using well-defined, isotope (O-18) enriched, epitaxial LaNiO3 thin films as a model system, we show that dynamic lattice oxygen exchange occurs during OER Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry studies reveal that lattice oxygen exchange can affect the top 2 nm of the LaNiO3 films, but the surface largely remains crystalline and in the perovskite phase after OER, In addition, cyclic voltammetry and potentiostatic measurements show that OER kinetics are strongly pH-dependent, which is different from what is expected from the typical four concerted proton-electron transfer steps, most likely due to the involvement of lattice oxygen. Our findings suggest that the roles of lattice oxygen during OER and the mechanism of charge transfer in such systems need to be further studied in order to design more efficient and stable electrocatalysts.									26	0	0	0	0	0	26			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000551543800046

Since catalytic stability and activity are inversely related, long service lifetime still demands large amounts of low-abundant and expensive iridium. In this manuscript we elaborate on the concept of maximizing the utilisation of iridium for the oxygen evolution reaction. By combining different tin oxide based support materials with liquid atomic layer deposition of iridium oxide, new possibilities are opened up to grow thin layers of iridium oxide with tuneable noble metal amounts. In-situ, time- and potential-resolved dissolution experiments reveal how the stability of the substrate and the catalyst layer thickness directly affect the activity and stability of deposited iridium oxide. Based on our results, we elaborate on strategies how to obtain stable and active catalysts with maximized iridium utilisation for the oxygen evolution reaction and demonstrate how the activity and durability can be tailored correspondingly. Our results highlight the potential of utilizing thin noble metal films with earth abundant support materials for future catalytic applications in the energy sector.									60	5	1	0	1	0	61			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000485041800026

Biomass with and without containing nitrogen could be designed and optimized to prepare PNC via hydrothermal carbonization, pyrolysis, and other methods. The presence of nitrogen in carbon can provide more active sites for ion absorption, improve the electronic conductivity, increase the bonding between carbon and sulfur, and enhance the electrochemical catalytic reaction. The synthetic methods of natural biomass derived PNC, heteroatomic co- or tri-doping into biomass derived carbon and the application of biomass derived PNC in rechargeable Li/Na batteries, high energy density Li-S batteries, supercapacitors, metal-air batteries and electrochemical catalytic reaction (oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, hydrogen evolution reaction) are summarized and discussed in this review. Biomass derived PNCs deliver high performance electrochemical storage properties for rechargeable batteries/supercapacitors and superior electrochemical catalytic performance toward hydrogen evolution, oxygen reduction and evolution, as promising electrodes for electrochemical devices including battery technologies, fuel cell and electrolyzer.

Porous N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) were fabricated by KOH activation and pyrolysis of polypyrrole nanotubes. The NCNTs possessed a large surface area of more than 1,000 m(2) g(-1). NCNT electrocatalysts, particularly those annealed at 900 degrees C, exhibited excellent ORR electrocatalytic performance. Specifically, they yielded a more positive onset potential, higher current density, and long-term operation stability in alkaline media, when compared with a commercially available 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst. This resulted from the synergetic effect between the dominant pyridinic/graphitic-N species and the porous tube structures. The NCNT electrocatalyst also exhibited good performance for the OER. The metal-free porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanomaterials were prepared from low cost and environmentally friendly precursors. They are potential alternatives to Pt/C catalysts, for electrochemical energy conversion and storage.									47	8	0	0	6	0	47			2095-9273	2095-9281		WOS:000377389700011

Until now, noble-metal-based electrocatalysts have shown excellent catalytic performances toward fuel cell and water splitting electrode reactions, such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Despite their outstanding activities, their high cost interrupted any further progress toward practical applications. Recently, the fabrication of metal/metal compound hetero-nanostructures has emerged as a promising strategy to develop a cost-effective and high-performance electrocatalyst. The introduction of metal compounds, such as sulfides, phosphides, oxides, and carbides, appropriately modified the energy state of the metal catalyst to achieve optimum activity, thus lowering the usage of expensive noble metal species to reduce the overall cost. In this review, we present recent advances in the synthetic strategies for metal/metal compound hetero-interfaces within a nanostructure. We also summarize the beneficial and synergistic effect of nanoscale metal/metal compound hetero-interfaces on the catalytic performances. Finally, we provide perspectives on further development of hetero-structured electrocatalysts toward energy conversion applications.									89	5	0	0	3	0	91			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463824300002

Herein we present a series of nonnoble metal [M = Fe(III), Co(II), Ni(II)]-nitrogen co-doped oxidized graphite rods (M-N/OGRs) that function as in situ working electrodes for tri-functional OER, HER and ORR electrocatalysis. The enhanced performance of the hybrid catalysts appear mostly associated with dual active site mechanisms originating from the synergic effects of M-N/Co-doped on the surface of the OGR. Our findings suggest that, the development of multifunctional electrocatalysts with optimal catalytic activity using transition metals and nitrogen doped OGR opens new doors for in situ synthesized electrocatalysts for use in clean electrochemical energy storage and conversion technologies.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0009-2673	1348-0634		WOS:000405675700002

TMCs are interesting because of their similar electronic structures to noble metals near the Fermi level (i.e., WC and Pt), which can promote electron transfer between the catalyst and its support-to enhance the stability of supported Pt nanoparticles as well as enhance its intrinsic activity for select reactions. This perspective article summarizes both theoretical and experimental results for Pt catalysts supported by TMCs for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to explore the interaction mechanism of the catalysts and the carbide supports. The strategies to improve the present carbide supports for HER and ORR are also discussed, which is expected to shed light on future development of TMC electrocatalyst supports.									229	13	0	0	6	0	233			2155-5435			WOS:000320298800013

However, synthesis of low-cost non-noble metal-based bifunctional high-performance electrocatalysts is still a great challenge. In this work, we report on the design and synthesis of a novel Co-B/N codoped carbon with core-shell-structured nanoparticles aligned on graphene nanosheets (denoted as CoTIB-C/G) derived from cobalt tetrakis(1-imidazolyl)borate (CoTIB) and graphene oxide hybrid template. Compared with pristine CoTIB-derived bulk structure (CoTIB-C), CoTIB-C/G particles with an average size of 25 nm are uniformly dispersed on highly conductive graphene sheets in the hybrid material, thus dramatically increasing the utilization efficiency and activity of the active components upon oxygen reduction and evolution. After all, because of the "barrier effect" of graphene sheets toward CoTIB-C/G and the synergistic effect between Co nanoparticles and carbon shells linked to the graphene sheets, as well as heteroatoms' doping effect, the as obtained bifunctional electrocatalyst exhibits remarkable oxygen reduction and evolution reaction activities in alkaline media, indicating its feasibility and potential in practical applications.									27	1	0	0	0	0	27			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000444793000050	30101584

The development of according electrocatalysts is key to boost their electrocatalytic performances. Dramatic efforts have been put into the development of advanced electrocatalysts to overcome sluggish kinetics. On the other hand, the electrode interfaces-architecture construction plays an equally important role for practical applications because these imperative electrode reactions generally proceed at triple-phase interfaces of gas, liquid electrolyte, and solid electrocatalyst. A desirable architecture should facilitate the complicate reactions occur at the triple-phase interfaces, which including mass diffusion, surface reaction and electron transfer. In this review, we will summarize some design principles and synthetic strategies for optimizing triple-phase interfaces of gas-involving electrocatalysis systematically, based on the electrode reaction process at the three-phase interfaces. It can be divided into three main optimization directions: exposure of active sites, promotion of mass diffusion and acceleration of electron transfer. Furthermore, we especially highlight several remarkable works with comprehensive optimization about specific energy conversion devices, including metal-air batteries, fuel cells, and water-splitting devices are demonstrated with superb efficiency.

However, improvements in catalyst design and preparation are currently hampered by the lack of a detailed understanding of the reaction mechanisms of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) facilitated by nonprecious-metal (NPM) catalysts. In this paper, we conducted a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) study in an effort to identify the rate-determining step (RDS) of these intricate electrocatalytic reactions involving multiple proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes. We observed an inverse KM for OER catalyzed by Ni and Co electrodes.

The iron-polypyrrole (Fe-PPy) is firstly prepared with a reverse emulsion. Direct pyrolysis of Fe-PPy yields turbostratic Fe-N-doped carbon (FeNC) with excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysis, while the melt salt (CoCl2) mediated pyrolysis of Fe-PPy obtains onion-like Co/CoO@FeNC with a reversible overvoltage value of 0.695 V, largely superior to Pt/C and IrO2 (0.771 V) and other Co-based catalysts reported so far. The ORR activity is mainly due to the graphitic FeNC and further enhanced by CoANx bonds, whereas the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity is principally due to the Co/CoO composite. Concurrently, Co/CoO@FeNC as cathode catalyst enables Zn-air battery with a high open circuit voltage of 1.42 V, a peak power density of 132.8 mW cm(-2), a specific capacity of 813 mAh g(Zn)(-1), and long-term stability.

The incorporation of Cr affects the oxidation state of Co and compared to the binary cobalt-iron hydroxide composite, the ternary composite shows excellent electrocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, whose onset potential is only around 1.43 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and the overpotential is merely of 270 mV to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. This enhanced oxygen evolution activity is attributed to the "regulation effect" of chromium. In other words, during water oxidation, chromium in the composite is partially oxidized into high valence 6 + and the electrons generated by this oxidation reaction can be transferred to the cobalt cites to maintain cobalt at a relatively lower oxidation valence state (but OER active), which accelerates the third electron-transfer process (M-O + OH- -> M-OOH + e(-)).									46	2	0	0	0	0	47			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000449447800046

However, they are rarely utilized in other oxygen-involved reactions, e.g. 2e(-)ORR to produce H2O2, 4e( -)oxygen evolution reaction (4e(-)OER), and 2e (-)water oxidation reaction (2e(-)WOR). Herein, we applied density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the applicabilities of SACs, including Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Pt, and Au with axial coordination (e,g,-OH, =O, and equivalent to N) for all 4e (-)/2e(-) oxygen reactions. With axial coordination, SACs derived from early transition metals exhibit high catalytic performance, including V-SAC-OH with an overpotential of 0.61 V for 4e(-)ORR, Mo-SAC-OH with an overpotential of 0.05 V for 2e(-)ORR, Mo-SAC-O with an overpotential of 0.52 V for 4e(-)OER, and Nb-SAC-OH with an overpotential of 0.14 V for 2e(-)WOR. Among them, most SACs deliver a trend of adsorption -energy decreasing with the increase of axial bond, which successively meets various adsorption requirements of all 4e(-)/2e(-) oxygen reactions. This finding has led to the discovery of highly active SACs adapted to different oxygen reactions. Importantly, an intrinsic framework that combines SAC configuration, transition metal (TM) species, and TM charges was established to describe the adsorption ability of SACs. This work offers an intrinsic landscape to understand the correlation of the adsorption ability of SACs with the tendentiousness of oxygen-involved reactions and guides the rational design of SACs.

J	Zhang, Linlin; Wang, Yijing; Niu, Zhiqiang; Chen, Jun								Single Atoms on Graphene for Energy Storage and Conversion								SMALL METHODS				3	9	SI				1800443	10.1002/smtd.201800443				SEP 2019	2019	Single atoms are attracting much attention in the field of energy conversion and storage due to their maximal atomic utilization, high efficiency, and good selectivity. Moreover, their unique electronic structure could improve the intrinsic activity of the active sites. However, the high surface free energy of single atoms inevitably results in their serious aggregation, leading to degraded catalytic activity and poor cycling life. To solve these issues, supports with high surface areas have to be developed to reduce loading density of single atoms and further decrease the surface free energy. Furthermore, engineering the active sites of these substrates can also regulate chemical coordination of single atoms, enhancing their catalytic performance. Owing to high surface area, excellent conductivity and adjustable surface properties, graphene is widely utilized to load atomic metal catalysts. In this review, the fabrication strategies and characterization methods of single atoms on graphene (SAG) are summarized first. Subsequently, the electrochemical applications of SAG on the oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, carbon dioxide reduction, and methane oxidation are discussed in detail. Finally, the future developments and prospects in fabrication and application of SAG are also discussed.									44	3	0	0	0	0	45			2366-9608			WOS:000485927700022

However, the most studied intrinsic cobalt oxides still need a high overpotential to overcome the current density threshold of oxygen evolution and are unstable for continuous reactions. Herein, we found that the catalytic activity of cobalt oxides improved significantly on soaking them in a weakly acidic iron-ion solution. The structure of the catalyst could be modified by the abovementioned treatment to reduce the overpotential, thus achieving improved catalytic efficiency for the oxygen evolution reaction. The formation of Fe-Co(3)O(4)delivered a much lower overpotential of 280 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)(with a small Tafel slope of 55 mV dec(-1)) compared with normal Co3O4(409 mV) for the OER; additionally, Fe-CoO also exhibited a lower overpotential of 296 mV compared with normal CoO (361 mV). The activity of the Fe ion-treated cobalt oxides was promoted by a thousand CV scans, which might form an amorphous phase layer. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations also indicated that the theoretical overpotentials of Fe-Co(3)O(4)and Fe-CoO were obviously lower than that of the untreated material. The treated cobalt oxides replaced cobalt atoms with a certain number of iron atoms, which dramatically changed the electronic structure and charge transfer rate.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			2052-1553			WOS:000569507700003

However, due to the slow kinetics of oxygen evolution as one of the semi-reactions of water splitting, it is urgent to develop high-performance and cheap bifunctional catalysts. In this paper, we propose an effective onestep hydrothermal method to synthesize Fe doped NiC2O4 nanorods on Ni foam, which exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance and stability in alkaline electrolytes. The oxygen evolution reaction overpotential is only 231 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) and hydrogen evolution reaction overpotential is only 151 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to that most NiFe-based catalysts. Furthermore, the overall water-splitting device constructed with Fe doped NiC2O4 as anode and cathode achieves a low voltage of 1.60 V at 10 mA cm(-2). The contribution of its excellent performance comes from the increase of effective active area and the decrease of electron transportation resistance after Fe doping. This work provides important guidance for the development of NiFe based catalysts. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000534346200007

Herein, a 3D hierarchical heterostructure LSTN@NiMn-layered double hydroxide (La0.4Sr0.4Ti0.9Ni0.1O3-delta@NiMn-LDH) supported on highly conductive nickel foam, is presented as a novel bifunctional electrocatalyst with outstanding performance. LSTN heterostructure synthesized by sol-gel method followed by hydrothermal reaction to grow LDH layers (LSTN@NiMn-LDH) resulted in phenomenal bifunctional activity towards both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), by exhibiting a low overpotential of 125 mV at 15 mA cm(-2) (OER) and 32 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) (HER). Moreover, the 3D electrode showed good long-term durability for 24 hrs. stability test at a current density of 100 mu A cm(-2), as well as constant LSV results after operating HER for 1000 cycles. This approach of preparing heterostructure LSTN@NiMn-LDH combines the fundamental properties of La0.4Sr0.4Ti0.9Ni0.1O3-delta (highly efficient HER catalyst) with NiMn-LDH (catalytically active for OER) by using interface engineering, resultantly opens a new way of enhancing the overall activity of water splitting reactions.									30	1	0	0	1	0	31			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000588132400127

Benefiting from synergistic cooperation of intrinsic open porous structure, in situ formed high valent cobalt species, and existing Co4O4 cubane, the UTSA-16 exhibits excellent activity toward OER catalysis in alkaline medium. The UTSA-16 needs only 408 mV to offer a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER catalysis, which is superior to that of most MOF-based electrocatalysts and the standard Co3O4 counterpart.

The electrodes composed of specifically designed particles exhibited enhanced capacity retention with stable charge-transfer impedance change during the overall lithium conversion reactions as compared to the electrodes composed of conventional particulate nanoparticles. The LAB cathodes with the as-prepared porous compounds exhibit better reversibility with a similar to 10% higher oxygen-evolution reactions efficiency and stable capacity retention than those of the Ketjen black-only electrodes. We believe that these novel performance is achieved due to the rational design of the pore-embedded/interconnected CoMn2O4 nanoparticles, which mitigate the detrimental volume change during the repetitive Li+ reversible arrow LiOx reaction and facilitate effective lithium ion (for LIBs) and oxygen diffusion (for LABs) in the porous electrode.

Herein, Co-Fe phosphates and their composites with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) were prepared by a simple hydrothermal method, which then acted as oxygen evolution reaction catalysts. In 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution, the as-obtained optimal composite, Co-Fe phosphate/rGO, can catalyze oxygen evolution reaction with a very sharp onset potential and a small over-potential of 338 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). It was found that in these Co-Fe phosphates, the optimal Co:Fe ratio is 0.75:0.25. The excellent electrocatalytic performance of the Co-Fe phosphate/rGO composite would benefit from the synergistic effects between Fe and Co species, as well as rGO substrate providing conductive channels. The formed Co-Fe phosphate/rGO electrocatalysts can be the promising replacement of precious metal-based catalysts for more practical and cost-efficient water splitting.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1793-2920	1793-7094		WOS:000457467500003

Here, superaerophobic electrodes with metal@metal-oxide powder catalysts are shown, which demonstrate high and stable OER activity. The active-site-density of metal@metal-oxide catalysts is increased over one order of magnitude than those of pure metal oxides due to the large enhancement of electrical conductivity, revealing the substantial enhancement of electrochemical OER kinetics. Furthermore, the superaerophobic property of electrodes is favorable for fast O-2 desorption, which improves electrochemical active surface area (EASA) during OER. The superaerophobic electrode with metal@metal-oxide powder catalysts provides the new insight for increase of active-site-density and EASA simultaneously, which are the key factors to determine the activity of OER electrode.									68	8	0	0	4	0	69			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000383609100005

Herein, corrosion engineering was employed for the straightforward preparation of FeAl layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets and Fe3O4 nanooctahedrons via the feasible modification of dealloying conditions. The FeAl-LDH nanosheets display an excellent catalytic performance for oxygen evolution reactions in 1 M KOH solution, such as low overpotentials (333 mV on glass carbon electrode and 284 mV on Ni foam at 10 mA cm(-2)), a small Tafel slope (36 mV dec(-1)), and excellent durability (24 h endurance without deactivation). The distinguished catalytic features of the FeAl-LDH nanosheets comes from the Al and Fe synergies, oxygen vacancies, and well-defined two-dimensional (2D) layered LDH structure.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2079-4991		WOS:000816679500001	35745313

Here the authors show that, under reaction conditions, mixed metal oxyhydroxides form at the nodes of bimetallic MOFs, which are highly catalytically active.Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are increasingly being investigated as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Despite their promising catalytic activity, many fundamental questions concerning their structure-performance relationships-especially those regarding the roles of active species-remain to be answered. Here we show the structural transformation of a Ni0.5Co0.5-MOF-74 during the OER by operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy imaging. We suggest that Ni0.5Co0.5OOH0.75, with abundant oxygen vacancies and high oxidation states, forms in situ and is responsible for the high OER activity observed. The ratio of Ni to Co in the bimetallic centres alters the geometric and electronic structure of as-formed active species and in turn the catalytic activity. Based on our understanding of this system, we fabricate a Ni0.9Fe0.1-MOF that delivers low overpotentials of 198 mV and 231 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 20 mA cm(-2), respectively.									296	11	0	0	15	0	296			2058-7546			WOS:000584361800001

These oxides were synthesized by the hydrothermal method and reproduced in the form of film on a nickel support by an oxide-slurry painting technique. The effect of Ni substitution in the base oxide (Fe3O4) was investigated with regards to morphology, structure and catalytic performance by using techniques, such as, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), infrared (IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), cyclic voltammetry (CV), Tafel polarization, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Among synthesized oxides, the NiFe2O4 electrode was found to be the most active anode for oxygen evolution (OE). Tafel slope values (b = 41 +/- 6 mV decade(-1)) were approximately the same for each electrocatalyst in spite of the amount of the Ni-metal being doped and the order for the OER with respect to OH-concentration were found to be similar to 2. The electrocatalytic activities of the electrodes are correlated with their surface roughness. Based on the electrode kinetic results, mechanism of the oxygen evolution is suggested.									44	2	0	0	2	0	46			1452-3981			WOS:000305267400011

The IrO2-Ta2O5 coatings were then prepared on the ion nitrided titanium substrate by thermal decomposition method. Morphology was observed by SEM and FESEM. Matter phases and crystal structure were analyzed by XRD. Electrochemical and semiconducting properties were analyzed by cyclic voltammetry, polarization, AC impedance and Mott-Schottky. Cracks on the surface of IrO2-Ta2O5 anode with ion nitrided titanium substrate were smaller and more compact than anode without its substrate ion nitrided, which provided more active sites for oxygen evolution reaction. TiNx interlayer can dramatically reduce the charge transfer resistance and oxide film resistance for oxygen evolution reaction. Anode with ion nitrided substrate owned higher voltammetric charge and flat band potential than anode without ion nitrided substrate. The existence of TiNx interlayer of the anode with ion nitrided substrate can effectively promote oxygen evolution reaction. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we report a facile approach to synthesize the Ir-based multimetallic, hierarchical, double-core-shelled architecture (HCSA) assisted by oil bath reaction for boosting overall water splitting in acidic environment. The IrNiCu HCSA shows superior electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which are comparable to commercial Pt/C and better than IrO2. The IrNiCu HCSA exhibits remarkably catalytic efficiency as bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting where a low cell voltage of 1.53 V is enough to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and maintains stable for at least 20 h.

Water splitting is an environment-friendly and effective route for producing high-purity hydrogen, which contains two important half-cell reactions, namely, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). At the heart of water splitting is high-performance electrocatalysts that efficiently improve the rate and selectivity of key chemical reactions. Recently, perovskite oxides have emerged as promising candidates for efficient water splitting electrocatalysts owing to their low cost, high electrochemical stability, and compositional and structural flexibility allowing for the achievement of high intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. In this review, we summarize the present research progress in the design, development, and application of perovskite oxides for electrocatalytic water splitting. The emphasis is on the innovative synthesis strategies and a deeper understanding of structure-activity relationships through a combination of systematic characterization and theoretical research. Finally, the main challenges and prospects for the further development of more efficient electrocatalysts based on perovskite oxides are proposed. It is expected to give guidance for the development of novel non-noble metal catalysts in electrochemical water splitting.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2073-4344		WOS:000817364600001

Here, we report a facile 2D-ZIF transformation strategy for fabricating highly efficient hybrid catalysts composed of highly dispersed Co quantum dots (-4.57 nm in diameter) embedded in ultrathin N-doped carbon layers (-3 nm in thickness), denoted as Co@NCL. The as-fabricated hybrids have excellent overall trifunctional electrocatalytic activities toward oxygen reduction (half-wave potential (E1/2) = 0.84 V), oxygen evolution (potential at 10 mA cm-2 (Ej10) = 1.63 V), and hydrogen evolution (Ej10 = -0.22 V) reactions in alkaline media. Notably, its reversible oxygen electrode index (Delta E = Ej10 - E1/2 = 0.79 V) is comparable with that of benchmarked noble-metal catalysts (0.80 V for Pt/C-RuO2) and superior to ZIF polyhedrons-derived counterpart (0.90 V) as well as most Cobased bifunctional catalysts ever reported. The as-constructed Zn-air battery and overall water splitting electrolyzer based on Co@NCL delivered a high peak power density of 170 mW cm-2 and a small voltage of 1.70 V that affords a current density of 10 mA cm-2 along with robust long-term stability, respectively, which demonstrates its promising applications in rechargeable metal-air batteries and water splitting.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000691551900001

We report a simple cation exchange approach to produce Turing-type Ag2Se on CoSe2 nanobelts relied on diffusion-driven instability. The resultant Turing-type Ag2Se-CoSe2 material is highly effective to catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolytes with an 84.5 % anodic energy efficiency. Electrochemical measurements show that the intrinsic OER activity correlates linearly with the length of Ag2Se-CoSe2 interfaces, determining that such Turing-type interfaces are more active sites for OER. Combing X-ray absorption and computational simulations, we ascribe the excellent OER performance to the optimized adsorption energies for critical oxygen-containing intermediates at the unconventional interfaces.									21	1	0	0	1	0	21			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000617254200001	33438257

Here we report that Ruddlesden-Popper-type layered perovskite, RP-LaSr3Fe3O10 (n = 3), functions as a reversible air electrode catalyst for both ORR and OER at an equilibrium potential of 1.23 V with almost no overpotentials. The function of RP-LaSr3Fe3O10 as an ORR catalyst was confirmed by using an alkaline fuel cell composed of Pd/LaSr3Fe3O10-2x(OH)(2x)center dot H2O/RP-LaSr3Fe3O10 as an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.23 V was obtained. RP-LaSr3Fe3O10 also catalyzed OER at an equilibrium potential of 1.23 V with almost no overpotentials. Reversible ORR and OER are achieved because of the easily removable oxygen present in RP-LaSr3Fe3O10. Thus, RP-LaSr3Fe3O10 minimizes efficiency losses caused by reactions during charging and discharging at the air electrode and can be considered to be the ORR/OER electrocatalyst for rechargeable metal-air batteries.									167	9	0	0	7	0	169			0002-7863			WOS:000322752900043	23802735

A novel laser-based synthesis method for the preparation of multifunctional Ni-CuO nanocomposites, which can be utilized in methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), is described herein. The growth dynamics of CuO in presence of Ni nanoparticles, as well as the corresponding effects on the electrocatalytic activity, are investigated. The prepared electrocatalyst exhibits trifunctional catalytic activity. The controlled change of the CuO morphology into homogenous nanospheres with more electrochemically accessible Cu sites results in excellent MOR activity with a high current density of 10.21 mA cm-2 at the vertex potential. Moreover, the electrocatalyst displays high oxygen and hydrogen turnover capability with outstanding operational durability in OER and HER. It is demonstrated that Ni-CuO can potentially be used as a bifunctional water splitting electrocatalyst in alkaline conditions. Importantly, this work provides a viable methodology, which can be employed for the development of efficient and stable multifunctional electrocatalysts by pulsed laser ablation.

The shell number could be controlled by using different solvents. Compared with regular La0.9Sr0.1CoO3 particles, yolk-shell structured La0.9Sr0.1CoO3 oxides have larger specific surface area. Catalytic activities of the as-prepared catalysts for the ORR and OER in 0.1 M KOH media have been studied by using a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technique. RRDE results show that multi-shelled La0.9Sr0.1CoO3 exhibits better catalytic activity for the ORR and OER with durabilities superior to commercial Pt/C catalysts.									51	4	0	0	3	0	52			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000364080400060

Here, phosphorus-doped SrCo0.5Mo0.5O3 perovskites has been prepared and evaluated as bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst. X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results show that P-doping benefits the formation of more stable tetragonal phase, and the generation of more surface adsorbed oxygen species. Compared with SrCo0.5Mo0.5O3 perovskites without doping, rotating disk electrode measurements indicates that P-doped SrCo0.5Mo0.5O3 exhibits a positively shifted half-wave potentional of 50 mV for ORR, and a reduced OER overpotential (similar to 58 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH solution. The enhanced catalytic activities and stabilities contribute to optimized surface characteristic and stable phase structure. The work not only provides a new strategy to develop efficient bifunctional oxygen catalysts, but also enriches knowledge of perovskite oxides. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

We accomplish the goal by calculating free energy diagrams for the redox reactions of oxygen to identify a rate-determining step controlling the overpotentials. We unveil that the catalytic performance is well described by the adsorption energies of the intermediates LiO2, and Li2O2 and propose that graphene-based materials can be substantially optimized through either by N doping or encapsulating Cu(111) single crystals. Furthermore, our systematic approach with DFT calculations applied to design of optimum catalysts enables screening of promising candidates for the oxygen electro-chemistry leading to considerable improvement of efficiency of a range of renewable energy devices.									43	2	0	0	0	0	44			1948-7185			WOS:000380415400027	27392527

It was found that the porous carbon structure with uniformly distributed active N-doping and Fe-N sites was conduced to oxygen adsorption, electronics, and mass transfer. In addition, the integrated electroconductive multi-walled carbon nanotube skeleton loaded with the porous carbon boosted the density and stability of reactive sites. As a result, the prior catalyst exhibited a high-efficiency oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity with a half-wave potential of - 0.078 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) positive than the commercial Pt/C (- 0.092 V). For oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, the potential was 0.732 V at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) compared with IrO2 (0.643 V). The presented strategy provided a method to design a bi-functional electrocatalyst with superior performance, prior stability, and favorable methanol tolerance.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000474477800026

In addition to better surface electron transfer kinetics, the radial growth of NCNTs offers plenty of electrochemically active sites (high roughness factor similar to 340) in tiny spaces, better accessibility to reactant species and appropriate gas outlets to prevent bubble accumulation during OER. Besides OER, the preferential 4e(-) pathways for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and excellent overall oxygen electrochemistry Delta E (E-j(OER)=10 - E-1/2(ORR) = 0.71 V) suggest excellent bifunctionality and advocate the practical importance of Anthocephalus cadamba shaped carbon nanostructures as a possible unitary oxygen electrocatalyst for metal-air battery systems.									52	0	0	0	3	0	52			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000448412700055

Bifunctional catalysts for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are pivotal for the energy conversion and storage, and alternatively, the photochemical water oxidation in biomimetic fashion is also considered as the most useful way to convert solar energy into chemical energy. Here we present a facile solvothermal route to control the synthesis of amorphous and crystalline cobalt iron oxides by controlling the crystallinity of the materials with changing solvent and reaction time and further utilize these materials as multifunctional catalysts for the unification of photochemical and electrochemical water oxidation as well as for the oxygen reduction reaction. Notably, the amorphous cobalt iron oxide produces superior catalytic activity over the crystalline one under photochemical and electrochemical water oxidation and oxygen reduction conditions.									461	22	0	0	24	0	468			0002-7863			WOS:000346682600031	25469760

However, RZABs still face serious challenges (such as sluggish oxygen reactions, poor durability, inferior reversibility of the zinc anode, and low cell energy efficiency) that conspire against their widespread commercialization. The reactions that occur at the three key components of the RZAB (air cathode, zinc anode, and electrolyte) co-operatively conspire against its performance. Thus, this review focuses on the bifunctional electrocatalytic events at the cathode (i. e., oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER)). That is in addition to the recent developments aimed at mitigating the performance-limiting events at the anode and the electrolytes. This review directs the attention of researchers and users to the critical areas for the development of the next-generation RZABs.									11	0	0	0	0	0	10			2196-0216			WOS:000671895000001

Iron carbide has been investigated in recent times as an electrochemical catalyst due to its potential as a great ORR catalyst. Using a unique amine-metal complex anion composite (AMAC) method, iron carbide/nitride nanoparticles (Fe3C and Fe3-xN) were synthesized through varying several reaction parameters. While the synthesis is generally quite robust and can easily afford phase pure Fe3C, it now has been shown that the particle size, morphology, excess carbon, and amount of nitrogen in the resulting nanomaterials can readily be tuned. In addition, it was discovered that Fe2N can be synthesized as an intermediate by stopping the reaction at a lower heating temperature.

To develop an efficient electrocatalyst for water splitting, the overpotential for this reaction must be minimized by using a capable electrocatalyst that can support the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this study, we prepared a unique core-shell structure, Co-metal-organic framework (MOF) derived cobalt diselenide laminated with molybdenum diselenide (MOF-CoSe2@MoSe2) and assessed its performance as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the HER and OER in alkaline media. The CC/MOF-CoSe2@MoSe2 core-shell structure fabricated directly on a flexible carbon cloth substrate demonstrated low overpotentials (eta 10) of 109.87 and 183.81 mV for the HER and OER, respectively, and a low voltage of 1.53 V for overall water splitting activity with an electrolyzer cell with symmetric CC/MOF-CoSe2@MoSe2 electrodes. The developed CC/MOF-CoSe2@MoSe2 catalyst had excellent stability over 24 h for OER, HER, and overall water splitting activity. These results suggest that lamination of MOF with a transition metal dichalcogenide is an effective route for developing the highly efficient and sustainable bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting activity.									28	0	0	0	2	0	28			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000729884800003

Herein, we synthesized metal-organic framework (MOF)-supported molecular catalysts for hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reaction (HER/ORR). Ligand exchange strategy was used to prepare molecule@support hybrids due to the same functional group. A series of hybrids were obtained using Co porphyrin (1) and different MOFs including MIL-88(Fe), MOF-5(NiCo) and UIO-66(Zr). The 1@MOF-5(NiCo) had the best HER and ORR activity compared with 1@MIL-88(Fe) and 1@MOF-5(NiCo). These hybrids also exhibited tunable selectivity for ORR with four-electron process, which can be attributed to the synergistic effect of porphyrin molecules and MOFs. This work provides a possibility for molecular catalysts to improve activity of HER and tune selectivity of ORR.

Identifying efficient non-precious metal catalysts for HER and OER remains a great challenge for applications in different kinds of electrolyzers. Herein, we report that cobalt nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon (Co@N-C) show high activity and durability for HER in a wide pH range and for OER in alkaline medium as a bifunctional catalyst. The HER and OER activities of Co@N-C are higher than those of multiwall carbon nanotube and iron nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon with a similar content of nitrogen.

It hinders the wide-spread applications of renewable energy conversion devices. For those electrocatalysts that are made of transition metal oxides, poor electrical conductivity further compounds the problem. In this study, we show a strategy, in which low level of dopants is used to increase the electrical conductivity of both perovskite CaMnO3 and reduced, oxygen-deficient perovskite CaMnO2.5 electrocatalysts. Introduction of tungsten cation to replace B-site manganese up to 3% in CaMn1-xWxOy (x = <0.03; y = 2.5 and 3) results in enhanced ORR and OER performance, due to the increase of electrical conductivity of these oxide catalysts via double-exchange mechanism. The concept of using low-level dopants to increase the electrical conductivity, thus the activity, should be a quite useful strategy for designing the transition metal oxide electrocatalysts for enhanced performance in OER and ORR.

Here we report a general method based on successive deposition and then selective etching for the facile synthesis of such nanocages. We have fabricated 11 different types of Janus nanocages characterized by a uniform size and well-defined {100} facets, together with porous, ultrathin, asymmetric walls up to 1.6 nm thick. When tested as dual-electrocatalysts toward oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, the Janus nanocages based on Pt and Ir exhibited superior activities depending on the thickness and relative position of the metal layer. Density functional theory studies suggest that the alloy composition and surface structure of the nanocages both play important roles in enhancing the electrocatalytic activities by modulating the stability of key reaction intermediates.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000631989900001	33600031

The important processes in oxygen electrocatalysis includes oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remain clean affordable efficient and economically feasible solutions. Carbon based metal-free materials owing to their abundance, electrical conductivity, porosity, structural modification at the molecular levels and exceptional stability under harsh conditions are emerging as advanced electrodes toward the design of high-performance oxygen electrocatalysts. This review provides a critical overview of this rapidly developing field including the design of efficient hetero atom doped graphene-based metal-free catalysts, defect engineering and co-doping with special emphasis on the electrochemical activity in acidic media. The latest trends in the design of hetero atom doped graphene nanoarchitectonics for ORR and OER along with important electrochemical parameters in the field were also outlined. Furthermore, the design of efficient and robust bi-functional hetero atom doped graphenes elucidating structure-property relationship toward multifunctional OER/ORR behaviour was highlighted.

A series of graphenes doped with nonmetal elements was designed and synthesized, and their ORR performance was evaluated in terms of four electrochemical descriptors: exchange current density, on-set potential, reaction pathway selectivity and kinetic current density. It is shown that these descriptors are in good agreement with DFT calculations, allowing derivation of a volcano plot between the ORR activity and the adsorption free energy of intermediates on metal-free materials, similarly as in the case of metallic catalysts. The molecular orbital concept was used to justify this volcano plot, and to theoretically predict the ORR performance of an ideal graphene-based catalyst, the ORR activity of which is comparable to the state-of-the-art Pt catalyst. Moreover, this study may stimulate the development of metal-free electrocatalysts for other key energy conversion processes including hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions and largely expand the spectrum of catalysts for energy-related electrocatalysis reactions.									780	47	0	0	41	1	790			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000333435500042	24580116

The deviations can be minimised by semiempirical or fully theoretical correction schemes. However, little is known about the impact of those errors on Sabatier-type activity plots, which are used extensively in electrocatalysis. Here, we show that gas-phase errors can induce drastic changes in the activity plots and may even lead to predictions in stark contrast with experimental results. We obtain simple expressions to accurately predict the location of the Sabatier maxima and the corresponding optimal adsorption energies for a variety of exchange -correlation functionals, using as case studies two important and extensively studied reactions, namely O-2 reduction and evolution. The effects are qualitatively and quantitatively different for oxygen reduction compared to oxygen evolution, and the latter is more likely to provide results in qualitative agreement with experiments. In general, and not just for O-2 electrocatalysis, accurate gas-phase energetics should become an essential ingredient of volcano plots.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000829308700002

Their unique porous structural features (such as high porosity, high surface areas, and highly ordered nanoporous structures) and designable structures and compositions have facilitated their use in gas capture, separation, catalysis, and energy storage and conversion. Recently, the design and synthesis of pure MOFs and their derivatives have opened new routes to develop highly efficient electrocatalysts toward oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER), which are the core electrode reactions in many energy storage and conversion techniques, such as metal-air batteries and fuel cells. This review first discusses recent progress in the synthesis and the electrocatalytic applications of pure MOF-based electrocatalysts toward ORR or OER, including pure MOFs, MOFs decorated with active species, and MOFs incorporated with conductive materials. The following section focuses on the advancements of the design and preparation of various MOF-derived materials such as inorganic nano-(or micro-) structures/porous carbon composites, pure porous carbons, pure inorganic nano-(or micro-) structured materials, and single-atom electrocatalysts and their applications in oxygen electrocatalysis. Finally, we present a conclusion and an outlook for some general design strategies and future research directions of MOF-based oxygen electrocatalysts.

Development of non-precious metals and efficient bifunctional catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction (ORR & OER) is highly demanded for metal-air batteries. Herein, a conjugate of tetra-cobalt sandwich polyoxometalate [Co-4(H2O)(2)(PW9O34)(2)](10-) (CoPOM) and polyvinyl butyl imidazolium (PVIM) (PVIM-CoPOM) supported on carbonaceous materials was explored as an oxygen bifunctional catalyst in alkaline media. The PVIM-CoPOM/NCNT composite is highly active towards ORR and OER. The novel composite exhibits a low overpotential (eta(j10)) of 0.28 V vs. RHE for OER, outperforming the state-of-the-art RuO2 catalyst (0.35 V), and a comparable ORR activity to Pt/C with similar overall oxygen electrode activity to the benchmark precious metal catalyst. A conventional Zn-air battery with the PVIM-CoPOM/NCNT air cathode shows high energy density and a low charge-discharge potential gap.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000633042900001

In order to minimize the associated energy loss as an overpotential, these electrochemical half-reactions of water splitting should be catalyzed by suitable materials. Due to the abundant exposed surface area and extensive active edge sites, black phosphorous quantum dots (BP QDs) have shown great potential in OER. Here, BP QDs was introduced to incorporate with bio-based carbon nanofibers (CNF) and Co-Ni bimetallic organic framework (CoNiMOF), preparing a novel catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by a facile one-pot reaction (Scheme 1). The unique structures and greater BET surface areas of CoNiMOF-BP QDs/CNF could possibly supply a larger electrocatalytic surface, expose further active sites. The obtained CoNiMOF-BP QDs/CNF possesses excellent electrocatalytic activity in alkaline electrolyte (1 M KOH) with a low overpotential of 281 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 111.9 mV dec(-1). The CoNiMOF-BP QDs/CNF can remain stable for 25,000 s under alkaline electrolyte, showing excellent stability. The increase of electrocatalyst activity is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of excellent conductivity and enriched active sites arising from BP QDs. This work not only provides an effective strategy for the development of bimetallic MOFs derived electrocatalysts, but also puts forward a new insight for the application of BP QDs in water splitting.

Two-dimensional (2D) materials, possessing tunable band gap, large surface area with more active sites, and short photogenerated carriers migrating distance, have attracted massive research interests as promising photocatalysts. In the water splitting reaction, compared with the hydrogen evolution reaction, the four elementary steps of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a complex and difficult reaction. Among 2D materials, Bi4TaO8Cl exhibits great potential for the OER. It is worth noting that the thicknesses of 2D materials is a significant factor for modifying physicochemical properties. However, the thickness dependence of OER performance remains unclear in Bi4TaO8Cl. Here, we systematically studied the effects of thicknesses on photocatalytic performance. Interestingly, we found that the few-layer Bi4TaO8Cl possesses more remarkable photocatalytic properties than monolayer Bi4TaO8Cl deriving from interlayer coupling effect. Compared with monolayer Bi4TaO8Cl, the few-layer exhibits broader range of light absorption accompanied with larger transition dipole moment, stronger reduction potential to drive the OER, and lower recombination probability of photogenerated electron and hole. The interlayer coupling interaction improves the photocatalytic properties, which promotes the progress of 2D material at photocatalytic water splitting reaction.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000594833000003

An important yet less studied feature is the repercussion of the lattice oxygen content of the oxide in the active site's coordination and catalytic performance. This is illustrated here for the Ba-Ni-O system. We synthesized two oxides with Ni in different coordination and oxidation states, namely BaNiO2 with Ni2+ in square-planar positions, and BaNiO2.78(2) with Ni3+ and Ni4+ in octahedral positions. We show that the square-planar configuration of Ni endows BaNiO2 with high intrinsic OER activity, comparable to the best catalysts in the literature. DFT indicates that progressively lowering the lattice oxygen content from BaNiO3 to BaNiO2 increases the Ni sites' affinity for the reaction intermediates, thereby lowering the OER overpotential. Thus, oxygen content is an important parameter in oxide catalysts, as it modulates the coordination, orbital splitting, oxidation number, and catalytic activity of the active sites.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000452584900008

Typically, this involves invoking scaling relations leading to the Sabatier-type volcano relationship for the catalytic activity, where each leg represents a unique potential determining an elementary step. The success of such screening efforts relies heavily not only on the prediction robustness of the activity determining step, but also on the choice of the descriptor. This becomes even more important as these methods are being applied to determine selectivity between a variety of possible reaction products. In this work, we develop a framework to quantify the confidence in the classification problem of identifying the potential determining step for material candidates and subsequently the pathway selectivity toward different reaction products. We define a quantity termed as the classification efficiency, which is a quantitative metric to rank descriptors on the basis of robustness of predictions for identifying selectivity toward different reaction products and the limiting step for the corresponding pathway. We demonstrate this approach for the reactions of oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution, and identify that Delta G(OOH*) is the optimal descriptor to classify between 2e(-) and 4e(-) oxygen reduction. We further show that Delta G(OH*) and Delta G(OOH*) have comparable performance in identifying the limiting step for 4e(-) oxygen reduction reaction. In the case of oxygen evolution, we study all possible 2 descriptor models and identify that {Delta G(OOH*), Delta G(O*)} and {Delta G(OH*), Delta G(O*)} both are highly efficient at classifying between 2e(-) and 4e(-) water oxidation. The presented methodology can directly be applied to other multi-electron electrochemical reactions such as CO2 and N-2 reduction for improved mechanistic insights.

RuO2 has been proved as a highly active and standard OER electrocatalyst with poor stability. Herein, we are successfully providing the facile approach to synthesize the mixed oxide composite of RuO2 tailored with MoO3. Fifty percent reduction of noble metal contents, two times enhanced activity and excellent durability as compared to pure homemade and commercial RuO2 have been confirmed by numerous characterization techniques. Enhanced electrochemical performance of best mixed oxide composite is observed due to increasing number of oxygen vacancies, electronic distortion, lower oxidation state of noble metal, and reduced value of the Tafel slope.

Thus, it becomes possible to consider intrinsic electrochemical properties of nanocatalysts when researching how activity relates to physical and structural material properties. Conversely, conventional electrochemical techniques provide a normalized sum current referring to a huge ensemble of NPs constituting, along with additives (e.g., binders), a complete catalyst-coated electrode. Accordingly, recording electrocatalytic responses of single NPs avoids interferences of ensemble effects and reduces the complexity of electrocatalytic processes, thus enabling detailed description and modelling. Herein, we present insights into the oxygen evolution catalysis at individual cubic Co3O4 NPs impacting microelectrodes of different support materials. Simulating diffusion at supported nanocubes, measured step current signals can be analyzed, providing edge lengths, corresponding size distributions, and interference-free turnover frequencies. The provided nano-impact investigation of (electro-)catalyst-support effects contradicts assumptions on a low number of highly active sites.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1				1422-0067		WOS:000734866300001	34884941	
J	Evazzade, Iman; Zagalskaya, Alexandra; Alexandrov, Vitaly								On the Role of Interfacial Water Dynamics for Electrochemical Stability of RuO2 and IrO2								CHEMCATCHEM											10.1002/cctc.202200932		OCT 2022			2022	Based on the coincident onsets of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and metal dissolution for many metal-oxide catalysts it was suggested that OER triggers dissolution. It is believed that both processes share common intermediates, yet exact mechanistic details remain largely unknown. For example, there is still no clear understanding as to why rutile IrO2 exhibits such an exquisite stability among water-splitting electrocatalysts. Here, we employ density functional theory calculations to analyze interactions between water and the (110) surface of rutile RuO2 and IrO2 as a response to oxygen evolution involving lattice oxygen species. We observe that these oxides display qualitatively different interfacial behavior that should have important implications for their electrochemical stability. Specifically, it is found that IrO2(110) becomes further stabilized under OER conditions due to the tendency to form highly stable low oxidation state Ir(III) species. In contrast, Ru species at RuO2(110) are prone to facile reoxidation by solution water. This should facilitate the formation of high Ru oxidation state intermediates (>IV) accelerating surface restructuring and metal dissolution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000869566500001

The composition strategy changed the electron structure of LaNiO3 and g-C3N4, ensures high Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio and more absorbed hydroxyl on the surface of CNL that can promote the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The composite catalyst presents higher activities than the individual components g-C3N4 and LaNiO3 for both ORR and OER. In non-aqueous Li-O-2 batteries, CNL shows higher capacity, lower overpotentials and better cycling stability than XC-72 carbon and LaNiO3 catalysts. Our results suggest that CNL composite is a promising cathode catalyst for Li-O-2 batteries.									51	3	0	0	5	0	52			2045-2322			WOS:000374035900002	27074882

Here, by performing an unbiased structural search and first-principles calculations, the electrocatalytic performance of the emerging 2D transitional-metal carbides, MC2 (M represents the transition metal of Ti, V, Nb, Ta, and Mo, C is carbon), is systematically investigated. Owing to their super stability and outstanding electronic conductivity, fast charge transfer kinetics is allowed during catalysis. Specifically, NbC2, TaC2, and MoC2 possess excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance under the reaction by the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. Moreover, taking advantage of the dual-active-site catalytic mechanism for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and ORR over traditional single-active-site mechanism, TaC2 presents promising bifunctional electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential of 0.06 and 0.37 V for HER and ORR, respectively. Meanwhile, the low overpotential endows MoC2 remarkable multifunctional electrocatalytic performance in overall water splitting (0.001 V for HER, 0.45 V for OER) and ORR (0.47 V). These intriguing results demonstrate the robust applicability of MC2 monolayers as effective electrocatalysts.									123	5	0	0	5	0	124			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000527675500001

Unfortunately, the OER kinetics in neutral electrolyte is sluggish due to the low concentration of adsorbed reactants, with overpotentials of neutral OER at present much higher than that in acidic or alkaline electrolyte. Here, hydrated metal cations (Ca2+) are sought to be incorporated into the state-of-the-art Ru-Ir binary oxide to tailor the surface oxygen environments (lattice-oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species) for efficient neutral OER. Using a sol-gel method, ternary Ru-Ir-Ca oxides are synthesized in atomically homogenous manner, and the obtained catalyst on glassy carbon electrode achieves 10 mA cm(-2)at a low overpotential of 250 mV, with no degradation for 200 h of operation. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ(18)O isotope-labeling differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, and(18)O isotope-labeling secondary ion mass spectroscopy studies are carried out. The results reveal that incorporation of Ca(2+)can enhance the covalency of metal-oxygen bonds and the electrophilic nature of surface metal-bonded oxygen sites; and simultaneously facilitate the adsorption of water molecules on catalyst surface, which accelerates the lattice-oxygen-involved reaction, thus improving the overall OER performance of RuIrCaO(x)catalyst.									36	1	0	0	2	0	37			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000542832200001	32584508

Here, NiFe Layered-double-hydroxide nanosheet-anchored CoSe nanotubes (composed of plicated nanosheets) supported on Ni foam are prepared through our developed hydrothermal-selenization-hydrothermal method. Benefiting from the unique nanoarchitecture, optimized adsorption/desorption of oxygenated species at the interface (owing to the re-delocalization of electron spin status via n-donation), the bifunctional hybrid catalysts exhibit low overpotentials of 201 and 98 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction in 1 M KOH aqueous solution, respectively. Particularly, the full-cell only requires 1.53 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) when choosing the hybrid catalysts serving as both anode and cathode, being superior than that of the state-of-the-art commercial noble-metal based cells for overall water splitting. This work presents a general strategy to boost the oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction kinetics of selenides, which is also expected to extend to other noble-metal-free catalysts.									67	5	0	0	2	0	67			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000468717900017

However, the contribution of varied Na to charge transfer, electrocatalytic kinetics, and energetics in terms of the electrochemical interface reaction for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water splitting and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells is not yet fully understood. This work reveals that varied Na concentrations indirectly affect the electrochemical OER or ORR activity by changing the Co-O bond in the constituent CoO6 octahedron of NaxCoO2. Tuning the Na concentration gives rise to the unique evolution of the electronic configuration and subsequently further enhances the Co-O bond's covalency, which results in promoting the catalytic kinetics of OER and ORR. As the Fermi level descends deeper into the O 2p orbitals with increasing Na extraction, the lattice oxygen becomes active in the proton-electron transfer process, which is reflected in the pH and oxygen-concentration dependence of the OER activity. Based on the characterization of its electrochemical properties, the high electrocatalytic activity of Na0.75CoO2, which exhibits competent OER activity superior to that of IrO2, is rationalized. Meanwhile, intrinsic Na0.75CoO2 reveals a half-wave potential of 0.74VRHE for ORR. The evolution of the structure and the electronic configuration of NaxCoO2 related to its electrochemical properties enables further improved NaxCoO2-based catalysts for efficient electrochemical OER and ORR.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000691302400005

It is widely recognized that the introduction of vacancies is becoming an important and valid strategy to promote the electrocatalytic performances of the designed nanomaterials. In this review, the significance of vacancies (i.e., cationic vacancies, anionic vacancies, and mixed vacancies) on the improvement of electrocatalytic performances via three main functionalities, including tuning the electronic structure, regulating the active sites, and improving electrical conductivity, is systematically discussed. Recent achievements in vacancy engineering on various hotspot electrocatalytic processes are comprehensively summarized, with focus on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), and their further applications in overall water-splitting and zinc-air battery devices. The recent development of vacancy engineering for other energy-related applications is also summarized. Finally, the challenges and prospects of vacancy engineering to regulate the electrocatalytic performances of different electrochemical reactions are discussed.									112	4	0	0	2	0	112			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000596117900001

Herein, we proposed a facile in situ templated method for the fabrication of oxygen-species-modified nitrogen doped carbon nanosheets (O-N-CNs). The epoxy oxygen and ketene oxygen combined with graphitic-nitrogen defects in O-N-CNs gave more active sites for the oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER), as proven via theoretical and experimental results, while the carbonyl-oxygen and epoxy-oxygen species showed more efficient electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Hence, the O-N-CNs showed highly active electrocatalytic performance toward ORR, OER, and HER More importantly, the superior multifunctional electrocatalytic activity of O-N-CNs allowed their use in the construction of Zn-air batteries to power the corresponding water-splitting cells. This work can offer an understanding of underlying mechanisms of oxygen species on N-doped carbon materials toward multiple electrocatalysis and facilitate the engineering of electrocatalysts for energy-storage and-conversion devices.									47	5	0	0	1	0	50			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000430156000033	29570274

However, catalysts that are active for both hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions are rare. Herein, we demonstrate that cobalt phosphide (CoP), which was synthesized via the hydrothermal route and has been shown to have hydrogen evolution activity, is highly active for oxygen evolution. A current density of 10 mA cm(-2) was generated at an overpotential of only 320 mV in 1 M KOH for a CoP nanorod-based electrode (CoP NR/C), which was competitive with commercial IrO2. The Tafel slope for CoP NR/C was only 71 mV dec(-1), and the catalyst maintained high stability during a 12 h test. This high activity was attributed to the formation of a thin layer of ultrafine crystalline cobalt oxide on the CoP surface.									371	15	0	0	13	0	372			2155-5435			WOS:000364441300078

Intensive efforts have been focused on the structure design and metal-site integration in MOF-derived catalysts. However, the key catalytic processes related with the metal sites in MOF-derived catalysts that dominate the electrocatalytic performance still remain obscure. Herein, we show a neglected but critical issue in the pyrolytic synthesis of MOF-derived catalysts: the coupled evolution of dual sites, that is, metallic sites and single-atom metal sites. The identification of active sites of single-atom sites from the visible particles has been elucidated through the combined X-ray spectroscopic, electron microscopic, and electrochemical studies. Interestingly, after a total removal of metallic cobalt sites, catalysts with purified single-atom metal sites show no faltering activity for either the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) or hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), while significantly enhanced ORR selectivity is achieved; this reveals the dominant activity and selectivity contribution from single-atom electrocatalysis. The insight of the coupled evolution of dual sites and the as-demonstrated dual-site decoupling strategies open up a new routine for the design and synthesis of MOF-derived catalysts with the optimized single-atom electrocatalysis towards various electrochemical reactions.									46	6	0	0	2	0	48			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000446981300014	30076689

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of promising materials for diverse heterogeneous catalysis, but they are usually not directly employed for oxygen evolution electrocatalysis. In this paper, it is reported that a series of CeO2/MOF/GO composites prepared by the hydrothermal method can be directly used as high-efficiency electrocatalysts. The new materials have excellent properties, including high catalytic activity, high specific surface area, and abundant oxygen vacancies. The factors increase the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and improve the OER performance of the catalyst. The optimized CeO2/MOF/GO catalyst has a low overpotential of 386 mV at 10 mA center dot cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 98.1 mV center dot dec(-1), and has good stability under alkaline conditions. Therefore, the newly synthesized lanthanide-doped layered materials are expected to be a promising and efficient electrocatalyst for water decomposition.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000677241400001

Using density functional theory, we show that the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) can lead to higher OER activity than the conventional adsorbate evolving mechanism (AEM) by minimizing the thermodynamically required overpotential. We also show that the OER activity volcano for AEM is universal for all perovskites, whereas that for LOM depends on the identity of the A cation in ABO3. This explains experimental observations that perovskites such as Pr0.5Ba0.5CoO3-delta and SrCoO3-delta show higher OER activities than the conventionally predicted optimum compounds such as LaNiO3 and SrCoO3. Furthermore, we show that LOM is preferred to AEM in achieving bifunctional catalysts capable of promoting both OER and ORR Using our overall activity volcano, we finally suggest several candidate materials that are predicted to be highly active for OER via LOM.									186	4	0	0	13	0	186			2155-5435			WOS:000431727300099

By analyzing the CVs, the mechanism of the anodic oxidation of PAN-based CFs was investigated. The results show that the anodic oxidation of CFs is virtually the activated oxygen formed by oxygen evolution reaction of water reacts with the surface carbon of CFs. Although there are more activated oxygen formed in alkaline electrolytes, surface oxides of CFs are easier to be formed in acidic electrolytes. The higher temperature can make the oxygen evolution reaction of water and surface oxidation of CFs be easier and more violent. The variation in electrolyte concentration can affect intensity of the two reactions, whereas it does not affect the difficulty of the reactions.

In this study, the synthesis of pentlandite sulfide of Fe, Ni, and Co was tried by a ball milling and subsequent pyrolysis. It was proved that the ball milling method is a promising way for a pentlandite formation and simultaneous carbon encapsulation. An aniline monomer played a role of carbon source for carbon encapsulation, and ammonium persulfate provided sulfur for a sulfide formation. Three kinds of compounds were synthesized by varying the Ni/Co ratio, and their structural characteristics and electrochemical activity were investigated and compared each other. X-ray diffraction patterns showed that they consisted of pentlandite sulfide and metal alloy phase. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that nanoparticles enwrapped by carbon shell were uniformly distributed on N-doped carbon. Electrochemical activity was studied under alkaline condition, and the overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) was obtained in 1 M KOH solution for oxygen evolution reaction. After 500 cycles, the overpotential increased slightly to 310 mV. From this study, it was revealed that the electrochemical activity of (Fe, Ni, Co)(9)S-8 depends on structural parameters not elemental composition.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000705182800001

However, their electrocatalytic performance toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is still unsatisfactory. Herein, a new hybrid catalyst of Fe7S8/Fe2O3 is designed via a deep eutectic solvent (DES)-based strategy. The Fe7S8/Fe2O3 particles are in a porous nanosheet structure and possess oxygen vacancy-rich characteristics. The porous nanosheet structure and oxygen vacancy-rich Fe2O3 in the Fe7S8/Fe2O3 significantly improves the electrocatalytic activity toward the OER. The as-prepared Fe7S8/Fe2O3 nanosheets demonstrate a small overpotential of 229 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1), which outperform most of the state-of-the-art Fe-based catalysts. This work not only reports a new Fe-based electrocatalyst with an improved performance toward the OER but also provides a rational DES-based strategy for construction of advanced catalysts.									5	2	0	0	0	0	6			2366-7486			WOS:000540599700004

Manganese dioxide (MnO2) is one of the most widely studied catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on account of the high reserves and environmental friendliness. Whereas, the catalytic activity of MnO2 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is so inferior that it cannot be used as the bifunctional oxygen catalysts. In this work, the assembled nanospheres of cobalt ion intercalated birnessite type MnO2 with a unique lamellar structure are synthesized by a very facile one-step liquid-phase method under mild conditions. Importantly, compared with the pristine MnO2, the optimized cobalt ion intercalated delta-MnO2 (24Co-MnO2) shows the greatly enhanced OER catalytic activity and stability. Specially, 24Co-MnO2 displays a low OER overpotential of 430 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH. In addition, 24Co-MnO2 shows much higher bifunctional oxygen catalytic activity than most of the manganese oxide based catalysts. Moreover, 24Co-MnO2 as the bifunctional oxygen catalyst is assembled in the aqueous and flexible solid-state zinc-air batteries (ZABs), showing the high peak power density and outstanding cycling stability.

However, as one of the most active oxide catalysts, cubic SrCoO3 presents poor OER performance relative to the theoretically predicted activity. Appropriate introduction of a guest component in the lattice and surface could largely promote the OER activity. Herein, we present a thermal-induced phase-segregation strategy to synthesize a heterostructured SrCo0.8Fe0.5-xO3-delta/FexOy (SC8F5) catalyst for OER. This novel perovskite/Fe3O4 heterostructure allows us to enhance the electrical conductivity ability, increase the Co oxidation state, and activate the surface oxygen to active oxygen species (O-2(2-)/O-) for efficient OER. In contrast to the poor stability of SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-delta, we found that the SC8F5 heterostructure with segregated Fe3O4 on the surface can mitigate surface reconstruction and stabilize the catalyst structure, thereby increasing catalytic stability.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000643578300027	33829757

A cobalt porphyrin is synthesized when two electron-withdrawing groups are used in an attempt to reduce the overpotential involved in O-2 reduction and H-2 evolution. The results show that in the case of O-2 reduction, instead of reduction of overpotential, the selectivity for O-2 reduction changes to 2e(-)/2H(+) to produce H2O2. In the case of H-2 evolution, the Co-I state is incapable of catalyzing H+ reduction. Rather, a Co-III-H species needs to be reduced to Co-II-H before H-2 can be produced. There results add to the ongoing investigations into the factors that control the rates, overpotential and selectivity of these important cathodic processes.					9th Asian Biological Inorganic Chemistry Conference (AsBIC)9th Asian Biological Inorganic Chemistry Conference (AsBIC)	DEC 09-14, 2018DEC 09-14, 2018		Singapore, SINGAPORESingapore, SINGAPORE	6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0949-8257	1432-1327		WOS:000473236700001	31147783

This review focuses on the recent trends and ac-complishments in applying monometallic and bimetallic oxide-based photo-electrocatalysts for the OER. Particular attention is given to the synthetic methods of these metallic oxide-based photo-electrocatalysts, their modification strategies towards performance improvement, their structure catalytic activity relationship, and a comparison of related activities. The peculiarities of the modification strategies, such as doping, morphological nanostructuring, oxygen vacancies creation, homojunctions/heterojunction formation, phase structure engi-neering, surface modification with oxygen evolution cocatalysts amongst others, to each photo-anode presented in the review are addressed. We furthermore highlight the electronic and optical properties from density func-tional theory (DFT) calculations for most reported photo-electrocatalysts, and provide future perspectives for further improvement.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-3697	1879-2553		WOS:000840890200001

It is a feasible method for creating a novel Ni phosphide/oxide heterogeneous interface to promote the oxygen evolution kinetics of Ni phosphide materials in an alkaline medium, yet it has been an unprecedented challenge for researchers. In this work, NiP3@CeO2 hybrid nanoparticles are firstly in situ grown on Ni foam (NiP3@CeO2/NF) via a novel controlled phosphating strategy. The NiP3@CeO2/NF catalysts display a fairly small overpotential of 200 mV to achieve a current density of 25 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions, 110 mV smaller than that of NiP3@CeO2/NF. It is noteworthy that the improved electrocatalytic performance of NiP3@CeO2/NF can be attributed to rapid electron transfer and the synergistic catalytic effect of the hybrid material. Density functional theory results demonstrate that NiP3 shows a stronger water adsorption energy than CeO2. The novel strategy of controlled phosphating to construct transition metal phosphide/oxide interfaces provides new ideas and methods for the development of efficient and practical water splitting catalysts.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000571979900009	32856030

However, the catalytic activity of MnCo2O4 is limited by its poor electronic conductivity. Herein MnCo2O4 coated with conducting polypyrrole (i.e. MCO@PPyhybrid) is synthesized. The obtained MCO@PPy hybrid exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity for both the ORR and OER, outperforming pristine MCO, PPy and MCO+PPy mixture. The ORR and OER activities of MCO@PPy are comparable to that of the commercial Pt/C (20 wt.%) and RuO2/C (20 wt.%), benchmark electrocatalysts for ORR and OER, respectively. While the stabilities of MCO@PPy hybrid toward both the ORR and OER are much higher than that of Pt/C (20 wt.%) and RuO2/C (20 wt.%), respectively. The PPy coating on the surface of MCO provides a conductive network for fast electron transfer and the coupling between the PPy layer and MCO promotes the transfer of electrons from PPy to MCO, benefiting the ORR and OER. The results reveal the effectiveness of surface modification with conducting polymer on improving the electrocatalytic activity of spinel oxide. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The supply of energy to meet that demand can be fulfilled by slowly introducing energy from renewable resources. The fluctuating nature of the renewable energy production (i.e., affected by weather such as wind, sun light, etc.), necessitates the increasing demand in developing electricity storage systems. Reliable energy storage system will also play immense roles to support activities related to the internet of things. In the past decades, metal-air batteries have attracted great attention and interest for their high theoretical capacity, environmental friendliness, and their low cost. However, one of the main challenges faced in metal-air batteries is the slow rate of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) that affects the charging and the discharging performance. Various types of nanostructure manganese oxide with high specific surface area and excellent catalytic properties have been synthesized and studied. This review provides a discussion of the recent developments of the nanostructure manganese oxide and their performance in oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions in alkaline media. It includes the experimental work in the nanostructure of manganese oxide, but also the fundamental understanding of ORR and OER. A brief discussion on electrocatalyst kinetics including the measurement and criteria for the ORR and the OER is also included.

Distinguish from complex nano-structuring, this work focuses on the spin-related charge transfer and orbital interaction between catalysts and intermediates to accelerate catalytic reaction kinetics. Herein, we propose a simple magnetic-stimulation approach to rearrange spin electron occupation in noble-metal-free metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with a feature of thermal-differentiated superlattice, in which the localized magnetic heating in periodic spatial distribution makes the spin flip occur at particular active sites, demonstrating a spin-dependent reaction pathway. As a result, the spin-rearranged Co0.8Mn0.2 MOF displays mass activities of 3514.7 A g(metal)(-1) with an overpotential of similar to 0.27 V, which is 21.1 times that of pristine MOF.

Among transition metal oxides, Mn oxides are very active for both ORR and OER and can act as a bifunctional catalyst. But due to their poor electronic conductivity, carbon materials are used as supports or mixed with other metal oxides to increase their conductivity that assistances in electrochemical applications. Herein, a highly active mesoporous cubic material consisting of Mn2O3 nanoparticles grown on carbon (Vulcan XC-72 R) as a high performance bifunctional catalyst for both ORR and OER have been synthesized. The synthesized Mn2O3/C has been characterized by various structural analyses. The Mn2O3/C material exhibits much better ORR activity compared to the commercially available Pt/C and Pd/C in alkaline media. The same material is also active for OER, making it a bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the reactions. Consequently, Mn2O3/C is quite stable up to 1000 cycles displaying its better stability. The reaction mechanism follows a 4-electron pathway for ORR. The superior electrocatalytic presentation mainly arises due to the better synergistic coupling effect of carbon and Mn2O3.

The iron content in the coating (5-55 at.% Fe), the loading of the deposit (0.5-30 mg cm-2) and the preanodization conditions had an influence on the Tafel parameters of the OER and the oxygen overvoltages. The lowest oxygen overvoltages were observed with 55 at.% Fe in the coating. For such electrodes, the oxygen overpotential was 50 mV and 30 mV lower at a c.d. of 0.01 and 1 A cm-2, respectively, compared to pure nickel electrodes.									33	1	0	0	1	1	33			0254-0584			WOS:A1992HW80000003

Electrocatalytic studies showed that nickel (7.7 atomic %)-intercalated birnessite exhibits an overpotential (eta) of 400 mV for OER at an anodic current of 10 mA cm(-2). This eta is significantly lower than the eta values for birnessite (eta approximate to 700 mV) and the active OER catalyst beta-Ni(OH)(2) (eta approximate to 550 mV). Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that a competition among the interactions between the nickel cation, water, and birnessite promote redox chemistry in the spatially confined interlayer region.									95	3	0	0	7	0	95			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000383373700036	27151204

The preparation process is easy-operation and doesn't require any complex synthesis steps. This strategy was demonstrated with Fe3+/Ni2+ loaded on porous carbon as an example. The thus formed pre-catalyst was in situ activated in the electrochemical test process, during which the electrochemically active species for OER are achieved. With the optimized catalyst, a current density of 10 mA(.)cm(-2) can be obtained at an overpotential of 275 mV. This catalytic performance is close to or even better than the benchmarked RuO2 and IrO2 catalysts. Especially, the catalyst also exhibits good catalytic stability. This study presents a new non-chemical synthesis route for advanced oxygen evolution catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1434-1948	1099-0682		WOS:000596931000001

However, the involved redox reaction of the metal layer typically requires extended operation time and elevated temperature condition, which greatly hinders its practical applications. Here, we achieve reversible sub-millisecond and room-temperature electric-field control of ferromagnetism in the Co layer of a Co/SrCoO2.5 system accompanied by bipolar resistance switching. In contrast to the previously reported redox reaction scenario, the oxygen ion evolution occurs only within the SrCoO2.5 layer, which serves as an oxygen ion gating layer, leading to modulation of the interfacial oxygen stoichiometry and magnetic state. This work identifies a simple and effective pathway to realize the electric-field control of ferromagnetism at room temperature, and may lead to applications that take advantage of both the resistance switching and magnetoelectric coupling.									60	5	0	0	2	0	62			2041-1723			WOS:000418247100005	29255274	
J	Du, Xiaoqiang; Su, Hui; Zhang, Xiaoshuang								3D MnCo2O4@CoS nanoarrays with different morphologies as an electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				44	39			21637	21650		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.06.086				AUG 13 2019	2019	The efficiency and stability of electrocatalysts are the key factors for measuring oxygen evolution reaction. In this work, the MnCo2O4 structure assembled from well-arranged nanowires or nanosheet arrays has been grown vertically on nickel foam by in-situ hydrothermal method. Interestingly, different morphology of MnCo2O4 can be easily regulated by adding NH4F to a mixed solvent to achieve conversion from nanowires to nanosheets. In addition, further synthesis of unique three-dimensional hierarchical core/shell MnCo2O4@CoS nanowires or nanosheets arrays was performed primarily by electrochemical deposition. Both MnCo2O4@CoS-7 cycles nanowires and MnCo2O4 CoS-7 cycles nanosheets exhibit high efficiency and long-lasting stability for the oxygen oxidation reaction. The lower overpotential of only 280 mV and 270 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) for the MnCo2O4@CoS-7 cycles nanowires and MnCo2O4@CoS-7 cycles nanosheets were obtained with lower Tafel slopes of 139.19 mV dec(-1) and 131.81 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M potassium hydroxide respectively comparing with our other MnCo2O4@CoS catalysts. The results demonstrate that the crystal morphology of MnCo2O4@CoS does not significantly influence their electrocatalytic activity in water oxidation reactions by comparing nanostructured MnCo2O4@CoS nanowires and MnCo2O4@CoS nanosheets. The high catalytic activity of the MnCo2O4@CoS nanoarrays is attributed to the possession of more active sites, larger specific surface area, abundant oxygen vacancy, and fast electron transport rate. Not only that, the durability of the MnCo2O4@CoS nanoarrays is also excellent after continuous oxygen evolution test of 1000 cycles. The results of XRD, SEM and XPS show that MnCo2O4@CoS-7 cycles nanowires and MnCo2O4@CoS-7 cycles nanosheets materials can be used as a highly efficient and stable catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction.

Herein, we report the synthesis of cobalt compounds supported on B-, N- and S-doped graphene (Co-B,N,S-G) via simple hydrothermal method. The as-prepared Co-B,N,S-G exhibited excellent electro-catalytic activity and long-term stability for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Notably, scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) was specifically improved to allow the investigation of local ORR and OER reactivity of the Co-B,N,S-G sample at variable temperatures. Practically, the Co-B,N,S-G-based air electrode was used as cathode to construct a Zn-air battery, which presented an extremely small charge/discharge voltage gap of 0.64 V, and remained a high voltage efficiency of 67% after 500 cycles (ca. 84 h). The constructed Zn-air battery was capable of powering LED-figures for at least 30 h. Impressively, the reported work exhibited the feasible prospect of temperature-controlled SECM on evaluating electrocatalysts at submicrometer scale at different temperatures. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we report core-shell NiO@Ni-P nanosheet arrays as a high-performance 3D catalyst for water oxidation electrocatalysis. Such nanoarrays demand overpotentials of 292 and 350mV to drive geometrical catalytic current densities of 10 and 100mAcm(-2), respectively, with an activity superior to its NiO and Ni-P counterparts. Notably, this catalyst also shows a high long-term electrochemical durability with a Faradaic efficiency of 98.1%. Density functional theory calculation reveals that the superior activity benefits from the synergistic effect between NiO and Ni-P.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000430168800009	29508950

However, despite the numerous reaction mechanisms and descriptors proposed, the understanding of the nature of their electrochemical activity is still far from complete. Herein, we present YBaCo4O7.3 oxide with tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+/Co3+ as a fundamentally new bifunctional catalyst, which demonstrates OER activity of 1.18 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 400 mV and ORR activity of 2.76 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of -537 mV, exceeding that of the LaNiO3 benchmark catalyst. The electrochemical activity of YBaCo4O7.3 was rationalized in terms of the Zaanen-Sawatzky-Allen model using DFT-based calculations. According to the results, overstoichiometric oxygen induces octahedral Co positions as active sites in the OER, while large Coulomb on-site repulsion energy for Co in the tetrahedral coordination makes these sites active in the ORR.									25	1	0	0	1	0	26			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000454251000025

Here we exploit the versatility of the perovskite structure to search for oxide catalysts that are both active and stable. We report double perovskites (Ln(0.5)Ba(0.5)) CoO3-delta (Ln Pr, Sm, Gd and Ho) as a family of highly active catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction upon water oxidation in alkaline solution. These double perovskites are stable unlike pseudocubic perovskites with comparable activities such as Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta which readily amorphize during the oxygen evolution reaction. The high activity and stability of these double perovskites can be explained by having the O p-band centre neither too close nor too far from the Fermi level, which is computed from ab initio studies.									980	36	0	0	67	0	994			2041-1723			WOS:000325533700036	24042731

Herein, for the first time, we report a nanostructured catalyst of nickel phosphides ruthenium phosphides self-supported on nickel foam (Ni2P-Ru2P/NF) through an in situ growthphosphorization process. As expected, by virtue of prominent intrinsic activity, rich electrochemically active sites, and high electronic conductivity, the resultant Ni2P-Ru2P/NF exhibits enhanced electrocatalytic behavior for the oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, which delivers low overpotentials of 160 and 101 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media, respectively. Remarkably, the Ni2P-Ru2P/NF can dramatically accelerate full water splitting with an ultralow cell voltage of 1.45 V at 10 mA cm(-2), which far exceeds the benchmark Pt-C/NF//RuO2/NF (1.64 V) and ranks among the best electrocatalysts previously reported.									24	0	0	0	3	0	24			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000787898300003

Electrocatalysts for seawater electrolysis must maintain a steady-state operation without suffering from chloride corrosion. In this study, we report a three-dimensional structure metal phosphide electrocatalyst by depositing cobalt-doped Fe2P (Co-Fe2P) on Ni foam. Density functional theory calculations showed that CoFe2P was beneficial for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) because of its suitable H* adsorption. Thus, the asprepared Co-Fe2P acted as an efficient bifunctional electmcatalyst, exhibiting enhanced electrocatalytic properties for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and HER. Moreover, the simulated alkaline seawater was used to determine the optimum potential (1.69 V at 100 mA cm(-2)) required for seawater splitting using the assynthesized electrocatalyst. This study proposes a novel material for electrocatalytic application.									36	1	0	0	2	0	36			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000697428600006

However, it is a big challenge to introduce defects into ultrafine catalysts because of the surface tension and self-purification effect of the nanoparticles. In the present work, physical laser fragmentation with chemical oxidization reaction is combined to synthesize Co3O4 nanoparticles (L-CO) with ultrasmall size (approximate to 2.1 nm) as well as abundant oxygen vacancies, thus providing an effective solution to the long-standing contradiction between the size reduction and defect generation. The ultrasmall particle size allows more catalytic sites to be exposed. The surficial oxygen vacancies enhance the intrinsic activity, while the internal oxygen vacancies improve the electron transfer, and all of these benefits make L-CO an active and durable bifunctional catalyst for oxygen reduction/evolutions. As the air cathode of zinc-air battery, L-CO displays excellent rechargeable performance with a power density of approximate to 337 mW cm(-2), outperforming the commercial noble metal couple (Pt/C+RuO2).									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000520140600031

Herein, the reaction between Fe3+, Ni2+, and 8-hydroxyquinoline was used to generate iron/nickel hydroxyquinoline salts (FeNi-HQ), which were loaded on a nickel framework for water oxidation. The formed coordination compound contains iron/nickel bimetal sites that show strong interaction between them, and so presents excellent electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution after an electrochemical activation process. Driven by a small overpotential of 293 mV, the activated catalytic electrode can provide 50 mA cm(-2) of current density with higher stability. Investigation on the catalyst after long time catalytic operation confirms that the surface layer is activated with the formation of metal oxyhydroxides.

Herein, we report an advanced mild synthesis of three conjugated triazine-based polymers (CTPs) with different chain lengths by increasing the quantity of electron-donating benzyl units in the backbone. Varying the chain length of the CTPs modulates their electronic, optical, and redox properties, resulting in an enhanced performance for photocatalytic oxygen evolution, which is the more challenging half-reaction of water splitting owing to the sluggish reaction kinetics. Our results could stimulate interest in these functional polymers where a molecular engineering strategy enables the production of suitable semiconductor redox energetics for oxygenic photosynthesis.									194	12	0	0	11	0	197			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000419110500015	29168279

However, carbon oxidation during the OER was rarely considered or even neglected in most of the reports. Herein, using carbon black as a model material, we develop a method to estimate the contribution of carbon oxidation reactions (CORs) to the measured current during the OER test. It is shown that the CORs could result in significant overestimation of the OER activity of carbon black-based electrocatalysts.									33	1	0	0	0	0	33			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000413271900007	28990621

Developing the highly efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great concern for the hydrogen industry. In the water electrolyzed reaction, the overpotential and the kinetics are the main hurdles for OER. Therefore, an efficient and durable oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalyst is required. In this study, an activated graphene (AG)-black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets hybrid is fabricated for supporting Ni3N particles (Ni3N/BP-AG) in the application of OER. The Ni3N particles are combined with the BP-AG heterostructure via facile mechanical ball milling under argon protection. The synthesized Ni3N/BP-AG shows excellent catalytic performance toward the OER, demanding the overpotential of 233 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 42 mV dec(-1). The Ni3N/BP-AG catalysts also show remarkable stability with a retention rate of the current density of about 86.4% after measuring for 10 000 s in potentiostatic mode.

Here, we report the oxygen vacancy engineering of Co(OH)(2) hexagonal nanoplates by doping Ni element, which can efficiently lower the average Co oxidation state and thus optimize the Gibbs free energy of the intermediates, giving rise to the largely promoted OER performances. Impressively, the as-obtained oxygen-vacancy-rich Ni-doped Co (OH)(2) hexagonal nanoplates manifest OER overpotential as low as 238 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution, being superior to most of binary CoNi hydroxides.

Herein, a facile and practical strategy is developed to successfully incorporate Ir single atoms into the lattice of transition metal oxides (TMOs). The chemical environment of Ir and its neighboring lattice oxygen is modulated, and the lattice oxygen provides lone-pair electrons and charge balance to stabilize Ir single atoms, resulting in the enhancement of both OER activity and durability. In particular, Ir0.08 Co2.92 O4 NWs exhibit an excellent mass activity of 1343.1 A g-1 and turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.04 s-1 at overpotentials of 300mV. And this catalyst also displays significant stability in acid at 10mA cm-2 over 100h. Overall water splitting using Pt/C as the hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst and Ir0.08 Co2.92 O4 NWs as the OER catalyst takes only a cell voltage of 1.494V to achieve 10mA cm-2 with a perfect stability. This work demonstrates a simple approach to produce highly active and acid-stable transition metal oxides electrocatalysts with trace Ir.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1613-6829		MEDLINE:36310342	36310342

In this work, we identify a heretofore unknown two-dimensional palladium carbide using the structure swarm intelligence algorithm. The proposed monolayer, named alpha-PdC, consists of fully dispersed Pd atoms and a rigid carbon backbone, exhibiting high mechanical, dynamical, and thermal stability with desirable electrical conductivity. Further calculations show that the proposed monolayer is an intrinsic multifunctional electrocatalyst. It possesses an excellent catalytic performance toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with low overpotentials. Specifically, the overpotential for the HER is only -0.01 V, and the significantly low activation energy barrier (0.16 eV) on alpha-PdC elucidates the fast kinetics. Moreover, alpha-PdC could also be highly active towards the OER and ORR with comparable overpotentials (0.38 and 0.27 V, respectively). This study identifies an intrinsic versatile electrocatalyst with potential applications in the fields of energy conversion and storage.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000764254800001	35244636

However, promoting vacancies at the lower temperatures required for operation in devices such as metal air batteries and portable fuel cells has proven elusive. Here we used thin films of perovskite-based strontium cobaltite (SrCoOx) to show that epitaxial strain is a powerful tool for manipulating the Oxygen content under condition consistent with the oxygen evolution reaction, yielding increasingly oxygen-deficient states in an environment where the cobaltite would normally be fully oxidized: The additional oxygen vacancies created through tensile strain enhance the cobaltite's catalytic activity toward this important reaction by over an order of magnitude, equaling that of precious-metal catalysts, including IrO2. Our findings demonstrate that strain in. these oxides can dictate the oxygen stoichiometry independent of ambient conditions, allowing unprecedented control over oxygen vacancies essential in catalysis near room temperature.									165	4	0	0	8	0	165			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000378193300012	27232374

Overpotential-Dependent Volcano Plots to Assess Activity Trends in the Competing Chlorine and Oxygen Evolution Reactions								CHEMELECTROCHEM				7	6			1448	1455		10.1002/celc.202000120				MAR 16 2020	2020	The selectivity problem of the competing chlorine evolution (CER) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions at the anode in chlor-alkali electrolysis is a major challenge in the chemical industry. The development of electrode materials with enhanced stability and CER selectivity could result in a significant reduction of the overall process costs. In order to gain an atomic-scale understanding of the CER versus OER selectivity, commonly, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are employed that are analyzed by the construction of a volcano plot to comprehend trends. Herein, the binding energy of oxygen, Delta E-O, has been established as a descriptor in such analyses. In the present article, it is demonstrated that Delta E-O is not suitable to assess activity trends in the OER over transition-metal oxides, such as RuO2(110) and IrO2(110). Quite in contrast, the free-formation energy of oxygen with respect to hydroxide, Delta G(O-OH), reproduces activity trends of RuO2(110) and IrO2(110) in the CER and OER correctly. Consequently, re-investigation of the CER versus OER selectivity issue, using Delta G(O-OH) as a descriptor, is strongly suggested.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2196-0216			WOS:000522359100014

In this work, cobalt nanoparticles are encapsulated within a 3D N-doped open network of carbon tubes (Co@N-CNTs) by a molten-salt synthesis procedure conducted at a high temperature. Physical characterization demonstrates that Co@N-CNTs are comprised of Co particle inserted carbon tubes with mesoporous tube walls, providing significant active surface area for electrochemical reactions. High electrocatalytic activity of Co@N-CNTs towards both oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions is due to its well-developed active surface and a synergistic effect between N-doped carbon and Co nanoparticles. Both primary and secondary Zn-air battery cells assembled using Co@N-CNTs as an air cathode show higher electrochemical performance than similar cells containing commercial Pt/C and Pt/C +RuO2, making the newly developed material a promising alternative to existing metal-based air cathodes.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000552352600001	32101342

Herein, an efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst of ultrathin Co(OH)(2) nanosheets supported on nitrogen-doped carbon nanoflake arrays (named as Co(OH)(2)@NC), is reported, which yields excellent bifunctional activity, i.e., a low overpotential of 285 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a high half-wave potential (0.83 V) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and a low potential gap (Delta E) of 0.69 V. The excellent bifunctional catalytic performance can be ascribed to the concerted efforts of cobalt hydroxide toward OER and nitrogen-doped carbon for ORR. The Co(OH)(2)@NC nanoflake arrays is further used as binder-free air cathodes for rechargeable Zn-air batteries, exhibiting a high specific capacity of 798.3 mAh g(Zn)(-1), improved stability (a working life of >70 h at 5 mA cm(-2)), as well as a reduced long-term charging voltage, which outperforms the counterparts of NC nanoflake arrays and Pt/C-based air cathodes. One step further, the Co(OH)(2)@NC nanoflake arrays on carbon cloth are directly used as binder-free air cathodes for flexible, solid-state ZABs, showing excellent performance under deformation as well.									10	0	0	0	0	0	9			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000673337500001	34258855

The oxygen electrocatalyst (Y1.85Ba0.15Ru2O7) optimized by oxygen vacancy modulation presents an extraordinary catalytic activity and stability. Y1.85Ba0.15Ru2O7catalyst presents an overpontential of 0.278 V in acid OER, which surpass most of the reported oxygen catalysts. Proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) with Y1.85Ba0.15Ru2O7 anode attains 1.34 A cm-2 under a cell voltage of 1.7 V at 60 degC. Ba-doped Y2Ru2O7 shows an obvious advantage electrocatalytic activity than undoped Y2Ru2O7 in both OER and ORR process.

In this paper, to avoid the parasitic reactions of carbon and binder with discharge products and reaction intermediates, we proposed an effective design of a free-standing catalytic cathode for Li-O-2 batteries. The FeCo2O4@Ni electrode consists of FeCo2O4 nanosheets grown directly on nickel (Ni) foam. The resultant hierarchical macroporous/mesoporous structure provides sufficient space for the insoluble discharge product Li2O2 and catalytically active sites for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Consequently, the carbon- and binder-free self-supporting electrode has demonstrated a high discharge capacity with relatively low charge overvoltage and a better cycle performance than the corresponding carbon-based electrodes.

In this study, we explored methods of reducing such bubble-related errors and improving the reliability of the collection factor under high-intensity gas evolution. We attempted the mounting of a thin wire close to the surface, to dislodge bubbles that formed specifically on the interface between the disk and the disk-ring spacer. This approach was tested for the detection of chlorine during parallel chlorine and oxygen evolution, and resulted in a notable alteration of the collection efficiency; its value became lower than theoretical expectations and also quite stable, even under higher current densities. We also coated the RRDE tip in a hydrophilic polymer, to reduce the tendency of bubble formation: this was tested for the collection of hydrogen and oxygen gas, and led to a mild increase in overall performance. The coating allowed for approximately 50% higher hydrogen evolution current density without ring failure, and for oxygen collection led to an overall improvement in behaviour. (C) 2019 The Authors.

J	Liu, Fang; Zhao, Jiangyuan; Xuan, Guohui; Zhang, Fan; Yang, Li								Spatial evolution characteristics of active components of copper-iron based oxygen carrier in chemical looping combustion								FUEL				306						121650	10.1016/j.fuel.2021.121650		AUG 2021		DEC 15 2021	2021	Reactivity of oxygen carriers (OCs) is a key issue in chemical looping technology. Exploring spatial evolution characteristics of active components and lattice oxygen migration during reduction reaction is of great importance in improving the reactivity of OCs. In this study, thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) is used to control the reduction degree of OCs. Oxygen migration to the surface of CuFe2O4 (100) and CuO (111) is studied based on density functional theory (DFT). X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are used to investigate phase change and valence evolution of active components of the oxygen carriers. The results show that the ratios of lattice oxygen, chemical adsorbed oxygen and physical adsorbed oxygen at three points are very close in OCfresh. As the reduction reaction progresses, lattice oxygen is gradually consumed and the content of Cu-0 and Fe2+ is increased. The closer to the edge point, the more lattice oxygen is consumed and the larger ratio of Cu-0 and Fe2+. Moreover, there is no Fe-0 in sample OC6.24% or OC9.19%, which is caused by the rapid migration and replenishment of lattice oxygen. The calculation results show that bulk oxygen migration to the surfaces of the OCs is exothermic and has a certain energy barrier.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000702831600004

Recently, a lattice oxygen-mediated mechanism (LOM) derived from lattice oxygen redox chemistry has received a lot of attention as it can rationalize the highly intrinsic activity and surface reconstruction issue in solid-state electrocatalyst alternatives with high metal-oxygen covalency. The physicochemical fundamentals of LOM further guide the exploration of efficient OER electrocatalysts. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the recent progress in lattice oxygen redox chemistry in solid-state OER electrocatalysts and its induced LOM. We begin with a brief introduction of LOM together with proposed pathways, and discuss the fundamental correlations between electronic structure of catalysts and OER mechanism to provide several electronic descriptors. Subsequently, we summarize the strategies for triggering lattice oxygen redox chemistry to promote the intrinsic OER activity, together with the theoretical calculations and experimental measurements for corroboration of lattice oxygen oxidation. Finally, we offer an outlook of the remaining challenges and future perspectives towards lattice oxygen redox chemistry in OER electrocatalysts. We anticipate that this review can inspire researchers to develop this attractive research area together.									38	3	0	0	1	0	38			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000672498500001

Herein we report an active Janus electrocatalyst of amorphous-crystalline cobalt-molybdenum bimetallic phosphide heterostructured nanosheets on nickel foam (CoMoP/CoP/NF) for efficient electrolysis of alkaline water. As-reported CoMoP/CoP/NF consists of amorphous bimetal phosphide nanosheets doped with crystalline CoMoP/CoP heterostructured nanoparticles on NF. It can efficiently catalyze both HER (eta = 127 mV@100 mA cm(-2)) and OER (eta = 308 mV@100 mA cm(-2)) in alkaline electrolyte with long-term durability. Serving as anode and cathode of water electrolyzer, CoMoP/CoP/NF generates electrolytic current of 10, 50 and 100 mA cm(-2) at low voltage of 1.50, 1.59, and 1.67 V, respectively.

The formation process was investigated by the evolution of phase structure and morphology with hydrothermal reaction time. And it can be explained by a 'disks-flowers-urchins' mechanism. Moreover, the Co3O4 urchins/NF exhibits considerable catalytic properties. It shows a low overpotential of 308 mV at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solution. In the meantime, such material has a small Tafel slope of 82.1 mV dec(-1), large electrochemical active surface area and good long-term stability. The obvious promotion of oxygen evolution reaction performance can be attributed to the special morphology and the direct attachment to the substrate, which improve the exposed active sites, lower the internal resistance and accelerate the charge transport. Thus, the Co3O4 urchins/NF not only has a great potential promising behavior, but also provides the basis for subsequent performance improvement.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000446363200001	30207544

However, the surface lattice is amorphous during the reaction, which gradually decreases the intrinsic activity and stability of catalysts. Herein, the precisely control tungsten atoms substituted perovskite oxides (Pr0.5Ba0.5Co1-xWxO3-(delta)) nanowires were developed by electrostatic spinning. The activity and Tafel slope were both dependent on the W content in a volcano-like fashion, and the optimized Pr0.5Ba0.5Co0.8W0.2O3-(delta) exhibits both excellent activity and superior stability compared with other reported perovskite oxides. Due to the outermost vacant orbitals of W6+, the electronic structure of cobalt sites could be efficiently optimized. Meanwhile, the stronger W-O bond could also significantly improve the stability of latticed oxide atoms to impede the generation of surface amorphous layers, which shows good application value in alkaline water splitting.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2296-2646			WOS:000748031900001	35083197

In the past few decades, multiple strategies have been developed to synthesize bulk and nanosized MG based materials. Here, combining the structure-activity relationship of MG with electrochemical reaction kinetics, the substantial progress of glass structures in electrocatalytic processes are highlighted, including the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, methanol oxidation reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, and nitrogen fixation. Meanwhile, applications of MG materials in energy storage devices, like supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries, are also introduced in detail. Finally, challenges and possibilities for reasonable design of highly-efficient MG-based electrode materials are proposed. The integration of high-throughput methods, artificial intelligence technology, as well as advanced characterization techniques is fundamental to screen materials with remarkable performance.

Herein, a series of phosphorus-doped Fe7S8 nanowires integrated within carbon (P-Fe7S8@C) are rationally synthesized via a one-step phosphorization of one-dimensional (1D) Fe-based organic-inorganic nanowires. The as-obtained P-Fe7S8@C catalysts with modified electronic configurations present typical porous structure, providing plentiful active sites for rapid reaction kinetics. Density functional calculations demonstrate that the doping Fe7S8 with P can effectively enhance the electron density of Fe7S8 around the Fermi level and weaken the Fe-H bonding, leading to the decrease of adsorption free energy barrier on active sites. As a result, the optimal catalyst of P-Fe7S8-600@C exhibits a relatively low overpotential of 136 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to reach the current density of 10 mA/cm(2), and a significantly low overpotential of 210 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 20 mA/cm(2) in alkaline media.

In this work, we developed an efficient cobalt nitride hybrid bifunctional electrocatalyst, which consists of sulfur-doped and mildly oxidized Co5.47N nanoparticles supported on nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide sheet (O-S-Co5.47N@N-RGO). The composite exhibits good ORR-OER catalytic activity and excellent stability as well. It delivers an ORR half-wave potential of 0.82 V and an over-potential of 380 mV for OER at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the ORR activity of the composite might have originated from the Co-N-4 site in the RGO sheet, whereas the surface Co sites on O-S-Co5.47N crystal are responsible for its OER activity.

The IrO2-RuO2 material is XRD amorphous and exists as clusters on the surface of the ATO. Systematic changes to the surface chemical composition of the ATO as a function of the IrO2 center dot RuO2 ratio suggests an interaction between the IrO2-RuO2 and ATO. Cyclic voltammetry indicates that the electrochemically active surface area of IrO2-RuO2 clusters is maximised when the composition is 75 mol% IrO2-25 mol% RuO2. Decreasing the loading of IrO2-RuO2 on ATO reduces the electrochemically active surface area, although there is evidence to support a decrease in the clusters size with decreased loading. Tafel slope analysis shows that if the clusters are too small, the kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction are reduced. Overall, clusters of IrO2-RuO2 on ATO have similar or better performance for the oxygen evolution reaction than many previously reported materials, despite the low quantity of noble metals used in the electrocatalysts. This suggests that these oxides may be of economic advantage if used as PEM water electrolysis anodes (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Excellent electro-catalytic activity toward both the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions is achieved by selecting a highly active core-shell of silica with CdS and rGO nanosheets as co-catalysts. In particular, the excellent catalytic activity of the 2 wt. % rGO/CdS/ silica nanocapsule catalyst for both reactions can be attributed to the large surface area and mesoporous nature, because they facilitate facile electrochemical activity, and lower the overpotentials and smaller Tafel values than other catalysts. In addition, it is more tolerant to methanol fuel crossover than commercial Pt/C, and exhibits long-term durability.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15			0025-5408	1873-4227		WOS:000458710300013

This study reports one step synthesis of cobalt and molybdenum hybrid materials for high performance overall water splitting. The binder-free CoS-doped beta-Co(OH)(2)@amorphous MoS2+x is coated on nickel foam (NF) to form 3D networked nanoplates that have large surface area and high durability for electrochemical reactions. The catalytic activity of electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution is mainly attributed to the unsaturated sulfur site of amorphous MoS2+x. Meanwhile, the CoS-doped beta-Co(OH)(2) plays the major role in oxygen evolution. CoS-doped beta-Co(OH)(2) and aMoS(2+x) are strongly bound to each other due to CoSx bridging. This CoS-Co(OH)(2)@aMoS(2+x)/NF hybrid exhibits excellent catalytic activity and stability for overall water splitting. For over 100 000 s the cell voltage required to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is only 1.58 V, which is remarkably low among the commercially available electrocatalysts. The findings open up an easy and inexpensive method of large scale fabrication of bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									179	7	0	0	14	0	181			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000387545500002

Transition metal phosphides have been regarded as promising candidates due to their high electrochemical activity, high conductivity and widespread abundance. However, currently, the oxygen evolution capability of the transition metal phosphides is still limited. It can be noted that the surface state of the electrocatalysts also plays a crucial role in determining the electrocatalytic reaction. In this study, we demonstrate a surface modification strategy using oxygen incorporation in the metallic Ni2P nanosheets catalyst for the first time, leading to dramatically enhanced oxygen evolution activity. The oxygen-incorporated Ni2P nanosheets were achieved through a simple low-temperature phosphidation from the Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets precursor. We found that the oxygen incorporation in the Ni2P nanosheets could actively promote the electrochemical performance and presented stable current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small overpotential of 347 mV with a Tafel slope as low as 63 mV dec(-1). Furthermore, the large electrocatalytic current is about 25 times enhanced compared with the pure Ni2P counterpart. Moreover, the high OER performance is superior to most of the reported pure metal phosphide electrocatalysts. These findings point to new opportunities for surface modification to manipulate and improve the reaction of electrocatalysts for designing high performance electrocatalysts and for the investigation of the underlying mechanism of the electrochemical reaction.									52	3	0	0	2	0	52			2052-1553			WOS:000384140800005

This technique principle is based on the deposition of charged particles from a stable colloidal suspension on a conductive substrate using either a direct or alternating current. Using relatively simple and low-cost equipment, the EPD technique enables the deposition of layers with controlled microstructures at nanoscale. The EPD technique has been particularly successful in the fabrication of the electrocatalyst layers for low-temperature fuel cells, which are anchored on the top of the fuel cell electrodes. In comparison with other electrocatalyst layer deposition techniques such as drop-casting, the EPD technique offers clear advantages for the control of the thickness and packing density of the electrocatalyst layers. Owing to the dense packing density, electrocatalyst layers deposited by EPD could achieve enhanced conductivity and efficiency. The present review aims at comprehensively evaluating the recently published results on the electrocatalyst layers fabricated by EPD and applied in oxygen reduction reactions, alcohol electro-oxidation reactions, hydrogen evolution reactions, and oxygen evolution reactions.

Accompanying this increase of formal Co oxidation state, the overpotential for the catalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 mA/cm(2) decreases from 470 mV to 415 mV, while all the NaxCoO2 materials (x = 0.75, 0.65, 0.52, 036) share a common Tafel slope of 41(+/- 5) mV/decade, implying a common rate-limiting process for the whole series. Our use of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on the de-intercalation-derived NaxCoO2 catalysts, on the other hand, led to the unexpected observation that the percentage of surface Co(III) increases from 23% to 37% even as the Na deintercalation increases the formal Co oxidation state above 3+. These observations suggest that when the formal oxidation state of the central metal is pushed to an unusually high value, i.e. Co(IV) in this case, oxygen vacancies on the materials surface formed from the relaxation of the highly oxidized metal to a more stable oxidation state are the key to improving catalytic OER activity.

Reducing overpotential is a great challenge because of four electrons transfer and slow kinetics compared to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Highly efficient and stable OER catalyst with low-cost is important for industrial hydrogen production by water splitting. Here we report a simple approach to synthesize free-standing amorphous FexNi77-xNb3P13C7 with the nanoporous structure through electrochemical dealloying. The npFe50Ni27Nb3P13C7 exhibits remarkable OER catalytic activity with a low overpotential of 248 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm-2 in 6 M KOH solution. Also, the np-Fe50Ni27Nb3P13C7 exhibits good long-term stability. The improved OER property is due to bimetallic synergy, decreased resistance of charge transfer, nanoporous structure, amorphous nature, and the generation of NiOOH during the OER process. The free-standing amorphous catalysts with nanoporous structure via electrodealloying method provide a promising approach to boost the performance of non-noble metal OER catalysts for the applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0021-9797	1095-7103		WOS:000744115700010	34752978

Herein, we have proposed vanadium doping and co-modification of alpha-Fe2O3 utilizing NiFe LDH for noble metal free electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which exceeds the performance of benchmark RuO2 under similar experimental conditions. Vanadium doping enhances the carrier density, whereas NiFe LDH contributes to the surface active sites for promoting water oxidation kinetics. A five-fold enhancement in electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) for alpha-Fe2O3:V-NiFe LDH (2.5 mF/cm(2)) compared to alpha-Fe2O3 (0.5 mF/cm(2)) is observed with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 7.6/s (alpha-Fe2O3:V-NiFe LDH). alpha-Fe2O3:V-NiFe LDH exhibited an impressive overpotential of 190 mV @ 10 mA/cm(2) with corresponding Tafel slopes of 42 mV/dec. The electrocatalyst, alpha-Fe2O3:V-NiFe LDH also exhibited excellent durability for over 10 0 0 cycles and continuous chronoamperometric responses for over 12 h at 25 mA/cm(2), current density with an average Faradaic yield of 93%. Detailed electrochemical studies with long-term stability indicate the potential of as-synthesized composite alpha-Fe2O3:V-NiFe LDH for utilization as a heterogeneous catalyst for efficient oxygen evolution reaction.

Recent studies have proven that TM-P-C can act as an efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst in the cathodic compartment of fuel cells. Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) are explored for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with high activity and stability over a wide pH range of 0-14. In addition, TMPs are found to exhibit striking electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. Relevant research into transition metal phosphate and phosphonate is relatively scarce, but several studies prove their potential in the field of electrocatalytic OER. Herein, this review focuses on the recent progress in TM-Ps, with the aim of giving a systematic summary of their fabrication, characterization, as well as catalytic performance and mechanisms in a series of key energy conversion reactions including ORR, HER and OER.

The catalytic films were based on cobalt oxide while the electrically conducive carbon-nitrogen films were produced from acrylonitrile. The electrocatalytic activity of the system was tested for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), on O-2 gas, and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), from H2O2. Studies on the molecular structure showed that the catalytic films contained only a fraction of CoO without Co3O4 spinel. It was found that the catalytic activity of the sandwich-like system, for both the ORR and OER, was a several-fold higher compared with a film containing the same amount of the catalyst without the conducing films. It confirms the predictions on the possibility of increasing the catalytic activity by constructing the sandwich-like systems.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0040-6090			WOS:000441177500016

Herein, we synthesize a transition metal coordinating nitrogen (Fe/Ni-N) doped carbon material (FeNi-MNC) with unique morphology combining external diverging carbon nanotubes and internal carbon matrix with ordered macropore alignments. With the co-catalysis of Fe and Ni species and the space limiting of SiO2 template in carbonation, the obtained FeNi-MNC shows high Fe/Ni-N contents. Profiting from the hierarchical morphology and abundant active sites, the catalyst exhibits excellent activity for ORR in 0.1 M KOH with a half-wave potential of 0.834 V and a Tafel slope of 53.1 my dec(-1) being superior to Pt/C. Moreover, it only needs an overpotential of 298 mV reaching 10 mA cm(-2) for OER in 1.0 M KOH.

However, the absence of a cost-effective and stable bifunctional catalyst that can replace expensive platinum (Pt)-based catalyst to promote oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the air cathode hinders their broader adaptation. Here, it is demonstrated that Tin (Sn) doped beta-gallium oxide (beta-Ga2O3) in the bulk form can efficiently catalyze ORR and OER and, hence, be applied as the cathode in Zn-air batteries. The Sn-doped beta-Ga2O3 sample with 15% Sn (Sn-x(=0.15)-Ga2O3) displayed exceptional catalytic activity for a bulk, non-noble metal-based catalyst. When used as a cathode, the excellent electrocatalytic bifunctional activity of Sn-x(=0.15)-Ga2O3 leads to a prototype Zn-air battery with a high-power density of 138 mW cm(-2) and improved cycling stability compared to devices with benchmark Pt-based cathode. The combined experimental and theoretical exploration revealed that the Lewis acid sites in beta-Ga2O3 aid in regulating the electron density distribution on the Sn-doped sites, optimize the adsorption energies of reaction intermediates, and facilitate the formation of critical reaction intermediate (O*), leading to enhanced electrocatalytic activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000831195000001	35900063

The chemical surface composition was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Laser structuring increased the overall electrochemical performance by more than one order of magnitude. The overpotential of the laser-structured electrodes for the oxygen evolution reaction was decreased by more than 100 mV due to high defect densities of the structures created by the laser ablation process.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2090-3529	2090-3537		WOS:000453294800001

The catalyst is a material which exhibits an increased Berry phase induced by the exposure of the catalyst to the external magnetic field. USE - The process is useful for enhancing catalytic efficiency of catalyst for OER. The external magnetic field of at most 200 mT is useful for increasing the efficiency of OER. The material which exhibits an increased Berry phase is useful in OER under the influence of an external magnetic field of at most 200 mT (all claimed). ADVANTAGE - The method is a simple method to increase the activity of OER catalyst through an increase of the Berry phase induced by the presence of a constant magnetic field that is larger than the average magnetic field of the earth (which is about 65x 10-6mT). The catalytic activity of electrocatalysts can be increased with only a small magnetic field of &#8804; 200 mT. This enhancement of OER catalytic efficiency under a small constant magnetic field occurs in OER catalysts which exhibits an increased Berry phase induced by the exposure of the catalyst to the low external magnetic field that is larger than the average magnetic field of the earth (which is about 65x 10-6mT). It is possible to tailor the Berry phase and as a consequence to enhance the OER activity.															0						DIIDW:202132907F		
J	Pan, Weiping; He, Shuai; Chen, Kongfa; Ai, Na; Lu, Zhe; Jiang, San Ping								Verification and applicability of symmetric cell configuration for mechanistic study of oxygen electrode reactions of solid oxide cells								SOLID STATE IONICS				357						115457	10.1016/j.ssi.2020.115457				DEC 1 2020	2020	Symmetric cell configuration is commonly used for the study of reaction mechanism and kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and/or oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of solid oxide cells (SOCs) to avoid the issues associated with the possible inaccuracy and errors of the reference electrode in three-electrode cell configuration. The electrode impedance behavior and reaction parameters such as electrode polarization resistance are taken as half of the measured overall value of the cell, based on the assumption that the oxygen reaction measured on the symmetric electrodes is completely reversible. However, the applicability of symmetric cell configuration for such mechanistic studies of oxygen reaction has never been verified with respect to the electrode materials. In this paper, the reversibility of symmetric cell configuration is investigated on model electrodes of platinum (Pt), La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM) and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF) using a three-electrode configuration. The results indicate the reversibility of ORR at working electrode and OER at counter electrode depends strongly on the reversibility of the electrode/electrolyte interface for the oxygen incorporation/exsolution process, which in turn is closely related to the oxygen ionic conductivity of the electrode and in less extent to the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte. Therefore, LSCF electrode shows a much high degree of reversibility as compared to LSM, while for the reaction on Pt electrode, the oxygen reaction is essentially not reversible. This study clearly indicates that the applicability of the symmetric cell configuration for the mechanistic study of electrode reactions in SOCs is closely related to the reversibility in the molecular level (the individual reaction steps) as well as the interface level (the regions where the individual reaction steps occur).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0167-2738	1872-7689		WOS:000591907000002

Recently, transition-metal-modified zirconium phosphate (ZrP) catalysts were studied for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. These studies suggest that the OER occurs preferentially on the surface of the layered ZrP nanoparticles rather than the interlayer gallery. Herein, ZrP nanoparticles are exfoliated with tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBA(+)OH(-)) to further expose surface sites which are subsequently modified with Co and Ni cations by an ion-exchange reaction. Because of the greater surface accessibility of the exfoliated ZrP support, higher loadings of catalyst material were achieved along with improved site access for catalysis. These new composite materials have improved geometric area normalized overpotentials than metal-adsorbed ZrP nanoparticles without exfoliation. Specifically, Co-modified and Ni-modified exfoliated ZrP show a reduction in overpotential at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) by 41 and 181 mV, respectively.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			2574-0962			WOS:000469885300064

Here, Co-tuned nickel phosphide electrocatalysts have been prepared by a facile co-precipitation, oxidation, and phosphidation method by regulating the atomic ratio of Co/Ni. Co species could modulate the electronic state behaviors of NixPy and the hierarchically nanostructured Ni/Co-P shows highly electrochemical activity with a small Tafel slope of 45 mV dec(-1) and an overpotential of 148 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In 1.0 M KOH, an overpotential of 360 mV is required to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Our research results suggest that doping metal is a useful route to improve the catalytic activity and our method may open up facile avenues to design other catalysts.									22	2	0	0	0	0	22			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000464931800148

The lattice oxygen mechanism tends to be triggered on oxygen-enriched surfaces underin situconditions; however, the required specific geometry and electronic structure need in-depth exploration. Here, tunable Co(3)O(4)is used as a model material, where the reconstruction of dominantly exposed (110) surface under reaction conditions is first presented using anab initiothermodynamic approach. We found the geometry of the neighboring oxygen on the reconstructed surface, and oxidized Co(3+)with five-fold coordination (Co3+5f) was identified as the active site. A total of 23 metal doping types were employed based on the reconstructed surface. We showed that the OER process with lattice oxygen participating can lead to favorable thermodynamics by the doping of early transition metals, and the O-O coupling of surface lattice oxygen can be facilitated kinetically by dual doping with Zn. Considering both thermodynamics and kinetics, the dual doping of Zn-Cr exhibits theoretical OER activity beyond the conventional AEM limitations and is suggested to be a candidate with enhanced OER performance. Moreover, we demonstrated that the dual doping with Zn enhances metal-oxygen covalency, where the moderate activity of the surface lattice oxygen is required for feasible O-O coupling kinetics while retaining favorable thermodynamic propensity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000565157900040

Ni/nitrogen-carbon (Ni-N-C), Ni@NiO-N-C and NiO-N-C mixtures derived from metal organic skeleton were successfully prepared by controlling the heat treatment conditions and applied in the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Through a series of research of OER catalytic performance, OER process kinetics, and stability, the as-prepared Ni @ NiO/N-C nanowires (NW) (250 degrees C) with core-shell structure showed the most prominent activity. Compared with other derived mixed materials, the oxygen evolution overpotential was 390 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and the Tafel slope was 100 mV dec(-1). Moreover, the material showed excellent stability without significant decrease of activity after a long time of testing. The detail study regarding the formation and evolution of Ni/NiO NWs is of considerable value and may offer prospects for developing highly active electrocatalysts in electrochemical energy devices.

However, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a slow kinetic process, so it is of great significance to develop efficient oxygen evolution catalysts (OECs). Many studies have shown that Ce plays an important role in high-performance transition-metal-based OECs. We discuss and summarize possible causes for the improved OER activity and stability with emphasis on the hybrids of cerium and transition metals, including cerium-doped catalysts, ceria-support catalysts and ceria-loaded catalysts. Finally, current challenges for the Ce-containing catalysts are identified, pointing to the future directions for propelling the water electrolysis research.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1793-6047	1793-7213		WOS:000720921900013

The electrochemical measurements show a superior enhancement of the nano-Au/GC towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) compared to bulk GC and Au electrodes. That is, the onset potential of the OER is shifted by ca. 600 mV in the negative direction compared with bulk Au and unmodified GC electrodes. The enrichment in the Au (110) facet orientation (of the electrodeposited nano-Au) [1] at the expense of other low facet orientations induces a favorable geometric arrangement of the Au surface atoms which is believed to facilitate the OH-adsorption and, hence, the charge transfer process during the water electrolysis into molecular oxygen. Thus, the OER is accelerated and realized at less positive potential.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1452-3981			WOS:000297571400020

The search for efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution has been pursued owing to their significance for green energy generation and storage. Layered Double Hydroxide (LDH) based materials are promising for the OER to improve this weakness. However, the wide application of LDHs is limited by their electronic properties and active sites. Here we report a simple and promising method to improve the OER catalytic activity via an acid-base reaction, which resulted in an exfoliation process and multiple defects including Co, Fe and O vacancies. The acid etched LDHs exhibit better oxygen evolution performance than the pristine LDHs under alkaline conditions with a small Tafel slope and good durability. The acid etching improves the electronic structure and provides more active sites, which results in significant enhancement of OER activity. This work will open up a novel and inexpensive way to improve the catalytic performance in an alkaline substance.									147	13	0	0	5	0	150			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000413866900010	29034926

The precursor which consists of ball-milled polyaniline (BM-PANI), carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and cobalt acetate tetrahydrate (Co(Ac)(2)center dot 4H(2)O) was obtained via homogeneous mixture in the presence of ethanol, and thus, satisfactory interface was formed.

Herein, the concentration of oxygen vacancy in spinel NiCo2O4 is first regulated via magnetron sputtering and its relationship with catalytic activity is comprehensively studied in Li-O-2 battery based on experiment and density functional theory (DFT) calculation. The positive effect posed by oxygen vacancy originates from the up shifted antibond orbital relative to Fermi level (E-f), which provides extra electronic state around E-f, eventually enhancing oxygen adsorption and charge transfer during oxygen redox reactions. However, with excessive oxygen vacancy, the negative effect emerges because the metal ions are mostly reduced to low valence based on the electrical neutral principle, which not only destabilizes the crystal structure but also weakens the ability to capture electrons from the antibond orbit of Li2O2, leading to poor catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER).									62	2	0	0	2	0	63			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000534503900001	32431080

Herein, a novel Co2+-based mixed transition metal oxide composite, the three-dimensional (3D) nanosheet-structured NiCoO2/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) composite, was successfully synthesized through a facile one-pot method. The better electrocatalytic activities of NiCoO2/CNTs for both ORR and OER than those of pure NiCoO2, CNTs, physically mixed NiCoO2 and CNTs, and Co3O4/CNTs are proved. The comparison of local ORR and OER electrocatalytic activities of NiCoO2/CNTs to other catalysts are obtained by scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) characterizations. The closed oxygen reduction peak and half-wave potentials, nearly four-electron dominated process, better methanol tolerance and electrochemical stability confirm the comparable electrocatalytic performance and better stability of NiCoO2/CNTs to the commercial Pt/C catalyst for ORR. The similar stability of NiCoO2/CNTs demonstrates its comparable electrocatalytic performance to the state-of-the-art RuO2 catalyst for OER.

Here, a remarkable enhancement in OER activity is reported by introducing cerium into Co3O4. An electrode made of Co3-xCexO4 requires a much lower overpotential than that of Co3O4 nanosheets to reach a current density of 100 mA cm(-2), and it is stable for at least 100 h with high intrinsic activity. The structure becomes partially disordered after Ce doping, thus exposing more active sites. In situ Raman spectra reveals a polyhedral distortion of Co3O4 accompanying the oxygen evolution process. Moreover, the active cobalt (oxy)hydroxide phase in Co3-xCexO4 appears at lower bias as compared with Co3O4. It is proposed that the enhanced activity is ascribed to the structural disorder and electronic transport after the introduction of cerium.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			2574-0962			WOS:000526598300111

The CuO-NiO/NF electrode obtained through annealing the in-plane epitaxial Cu(OH)(2)-Ni2O3H/NF in the oven, exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activities for the oxygen evolution reaction at a low overpotential of 319 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of CuO-NiO/NF is over 2 times larger than that of Cu(OH)(2)-Ni2O3H/NF electrode.

Interface engineering can modify the local electronic structure of active sites, which is one of the important strategy to enhance catalytic activity. Herein, we synthesized NiMoSx heterostructure nanorods by simple hydrothermal method. The self supporting electrode of NiMoSx heterostructure nanorods grown in situ on nickel foam can reduce the indirect contact resistance between the substrate and the catalyst, and promote the timely release of bubbles produced by the oxygen evolution reaction. The heterogeneous interface in NiMoSx can provide abundant electroactive centers and optimize the adsorption energy of active intermediates. NiMoSx heterostructure nanorods showed excellent oxygen evolution catalytic activity (g100 = 279 mV, g1000 = 436 mV, Tafel slope b = 72.3 mV dec-1) and more than 200 hours of sustainable durability in 1 M KOH. When NiMoSx heterostructure nanorods are used as anode materials for water electrolysis, the electrolytic cell could obtain 10 mA cm-2 at 1.48 V. The current research results not only show that NiMoSx nanostructure is an excellent oxygen evolution electrocatalyst, At the same time, it also provides a valuable interface regulation method for the design of high-performance heterostructure electrocatalyst.@2022 Elsevier Inc.

In this work, a simple hydrothermal synthesis method was used to obtain FeMn bimetallic organic materials (FeMn-MOF/NF) grown on foamed nickel (NF) in one step. Moreover, FeMn-MOF/NF(1:1) had larger electrochemical specific surface area and unique nano-flower-like structure. The overpotentials of OER and HER in alkaline solution at a current density of 50 mA.cm(2) were 290 mV and 260 mV, respectively, and the total water splitting potential at this current density is only 1.7 V. The excellent activity and stability were attributed to the synergistic effect of FeMn.

In this work, rare-earth-based bimetallic metal-organic framework (NiY-BTC) nanorods anchored with transition metal-organic frameworks (ZIF-67) were used as versatile precursors to prepare novel metal/rare-earth metal oxide coupled carbon-based bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts (NiY/C@Co/C). Due to the stable nanorods framework structure, appropriate Y2O3 active center, and richness of Co-N sites in the carbon skeletons, the NiY/C@Co/C catalyst exhibits high onset potentials (Eonset = 0.928 V) and half-wave potential (E1/2 = 0.83 V) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and expresses a low overpotential (eta = 392 mV@10 mA cm-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Moreover, a rechargeable Zn-air battery assembled with NiY/C@Co/C as the air cathode catalyst displayed a great specific capacity (899.6 mAh gZn-1) and a remarkable peak power density of 102.2 mW cm(-2), as well as excellent durability and stability.

This report describes a general approach for preparing cobalt and iron oxide nanoparticles co-supported on nitrogen-doped carbon materials as an efficient oxygen electrode catalyst with an improved catalytic activity toward OER and ORR; these nanoparticles were obtained through pyrolysis of Co- and Fe-based metal-organic frameworks grown directly on the surface of polyvinylimidazole-functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The Fe/Co-CNTs-800 catalyst pyrolyzed at 800 degrees C exhibited high electrocatalytic activity for ORR, with only approximate to 50mV lesser activity than that of Pt/C at the half-wave potential, and for OER, with only approximate to 70mV lesser activity than that of RuO2 at a current density of 10mAcm(-2) in a 0.1M KOH solution. The potential difference between OER and ORR for Fe/Co-CNTs-800 (EOER-ORR) was 0.905V, which was significantly lower than that for noble-metal catalysts (20wt% Pt/C (1.137V) and RuO2 (1.341V)). The preparation temperature and value of Fe/Co in the catalyst composite are crucial for achieving high electrocatalytic activity for both ORR and OER.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			2365-6549			WOS:000419480300029

Wider meso-/macropores are expected to enhance the reaction kinetics by facilitating the ion transport to and fro from an active interface, thereby continuously regenerating it at accelerated rates. Herein, we report a generic, simple, and ultrafast synthetic method to obtain highly graphitized porous carbon containing well-dispersed Co3O4 nanoparticles (similar to 1 wt % Co) using cobalt acetate and piperidine precursors. The obtained catalyst (Co3O4@CS) exhibits onset potential and oxygen evolution kinetics similar to that of the state-of-the-art catalyst, RuO2. For oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the synthesized material exhibits excellent cycling performance over 2000 cycles. Such a performance metric can be attributed to the uniform dispersion of active sites (Co3O4) over a low-density, highly interconnected conducting carbon matrix leading to facile mass transport and charge transfer, respectively.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2574-0962			WOS:000458706500006

Engineering favorable defects on the electrocatalysts to provide accessible active sites can boost the sluggish reaction thermodynamics or kinetics. Herein, Co1-xS nanosheets were designed and grown on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) by controlling the successive two-step hydrothermal reaction. A belt-like cobalt-based precursor was first formed with the assistance of ammonia and rGO, which were then sulfurized into Co1-xS by L-cysteine at a higher hydrothermal temperature. Because of the non-stoichiometric defects and ultrathin sheet-like structure, additional cobalt vacancies (V'(Co)) were formed/exposed on the catalyst surface, which expedited the charge diffusion and increased the electroactive surface in contact with the electrolyte. The resulting Co1-xS/rGO hybrids exhibited an overpotential as low as 310 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) in an alkaline electrolyte for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Density functional theory calculations indicated that the V'(Co) on the Co1-xS/rGO hybrid functioned as catalytic sites for enhanced OER. They also reduced the energy barrier for the transformation of intermediate oxygenated species, promoting the OER thermodynamics.									59	7	0	0	3	0	59			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000400005000028

A sharp reduction in initial and steady state rates of O-2 evolution and in the intensity of different components of ms-DLE under excess light on the stage of lag-phase of chlorophyll biosynthesis (4-6 h of greening) were observed. An increasing stability of the oxygen-evolving process and ms-DLE of chlorophyll during formation of the thylakoid membrane photosystems (12-24 h of greening) was shown. Rifampicin did not influence the stability of oxygen evolution whereas cycloheximide led to the intensification of photoinhibition of the initial and steady-state rates of oxygen evolution under the inhibitory light action. The early stages of photosystems formation during short time of greening of etiolated seedlings were more sensitive to the action of inhibitory light, possibly due to a weak interaction of the oxygen-evolving system components and connection with reaction centers of Photosystem II.

We demonstrate here that a moderate amount (similar to 12 wt %) of borate doping of crystalline alpha-Ni(OH)(2), a common low-cost catalyst, can lower the Tafel slope of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution from the typical value of 60 to 43 mV decade(-1) and the overpotential for 10 mA cm(-2) of current density from 390 to 340 mV. Borate doping also improves the stability of alpha-Ni(OH)(2) in OER The borate-doped alpha-Ni(OH)(2) can even surpass the benchmark Ir/C precious metal catalyst in terms of activity and stability.

However, the catalytic activity of CoFe2O4 is limited by its poor electronic conductivity. In this study, CoFe2O4 strongly coupled with carbon nanotubes (CoFe2O4/CNTs) hybrid has been fabricated to address this issue. The as-synthesized CoFe2O4/CNTs hybrid exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activities for both the ORR and OER in alkaline solution. The onset potential of CoFe2O4/CNTs for ORR is -0.124 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), which is much higher than that of the CoFe2O4 + CNTs mixture (-0.259 V). Meanwhile, the CoFe2O4/CNTs hybrid shows much higher activity for OER as compared to the CoFe2O4 + CNT mixture. The onset potential of the former is 54 mV higher than that of the latter. The CoFe2O4/CNTs also holds high stability for both the ORR and OER, outperforming the CoFe2O4+ CNTs mixture. The excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability of the CoFe2O4/CNTs hybrid for both the ORR and OER make it a potential bi-functional electrocatalysts for metal-air batteries.

O-vacancies (V-o) play important roles in tailoring the local surface and electronic environment to lower the activation barriers. Herein, an effective strategy is shown to enhance the oxygen evolution reduction (OER) performance on Co3O4 ultrathin nanosheets via combined cation substitution and anion vacancies. The oxygen-deficient Fe-Co-O nanosheets (3-4 nm thickness) display an overpotential of 260 mV@10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 53 mV dec(-1), outperforming those of the benchmark RuO2 in 1.0 m KOH. Further calculations demonstrate that the combined introduction of Fe cation and V-o with appropriate location and content finely tune the intermediate absorption, consequently lowering the rate-limiting activation energy from 0.82 to as low as 0.15 eV. The feasibility is also proved by oxygen-deficient Ni-Co-O nanosheets. This work not only establishes a clear atomic-level correlation between cation substitution, anion vacancies, and OER performance, but also provides valuable insights for the rational design of highly efficient catalysts for OER.									78	7	0	0	0	0	78			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000531289800001	32390233

The efficiency of water splitting largely depends on the intrinsic activity, selectivity, and stability of the electrocatalysts. Hence, soaring scientific endeavors have been made to develop high-performance electrocatalysts and uncover the underling reaction mechanisms. Iridium (Ir)-based nanomaterials are most promising for water splitting due to their favorable intrinsic activity, wide pH window, and high stability. In this review, we first discussed the mechanisms of various Ir-based catalysts in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), including metal, alloys, and oxides. Important criteria and methods for precise evaluation of water splitting catalysts are discussed. Then, the applications of Ir-based nanomaterials in the HER, OER and the overall water splitting are comprehensively reviewed, with an emphasis on correlating the structure-function relationships and the advanced strategies for rational design of reaction-oriented Ir catalysts. Lastly, the current challenges in fundamental studies and future directions in this field are presented.									49	1	0	0	2	0	48			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000632873000001

Herein, oxygen vacancies enriched Co3O4 nanoflowers with single layer porous structures are made to study their catalytic activity toward water splitting. The as-synthesized defects enriched Co3O4 presents flowers-like nanostructures and possesses high specific surface area (84 m(2) g(-1)) with uniform pore size (4 nm). On behalf of the unique morphology and electronic structure, the Co3O4 nanoflowers display enhanced HER and OER performances compared with commercial Co3O4 nanoparticles (similar to 50 nm). In addition, it still presents good catalytic without remarkably decay in potential over 9 days. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, a series of oxygen micro-alloyed high-entropy alloys (O-HEAs) is developed via a metallurgy approach. A (CrFeCoNi)(97)O-3 bulk O-HEA shows exceptional electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), reaching an overpotential as low as 196 mV and a Tafel slope of 29 mV dec(-1), and with stability longer than 120 h in 1 m KOH solution at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). It is shown that the enhanced OER performance can be attributed to the formation of island-like Cr2O3 microdomains, the leaching of Cr3+ ions, and structural amorphization at the interfaces of the domains. These findings offer a technological-orientated strategy to integrated electrodes.									30	0	0	0	0	0	30			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000671747800001	34250646

The OER heavily impacts the overall energy efficiency of these devices because the sluggish OER kinetics result in a huge overpotential, thus, a large amount of efficient catalysts are needed. The benchmark iridium and ruthenium (Ir/Ru)-based materials (mostly used in acid media) are, however, significantly limited by their scarcity. Non-precious metal-based catalysts (NPMCs) have emerged as the most promising alternatives; however, they tend to degrade quickly under the harsh operating conditions of typical OER devices. Another challenge is the unsatisfying performance of OER catalysts when integrated in real-world devices. Herein, the OER active sites for three mainstream types of NPMCs including non-precious transition metal oxides/(oxy)hydroxides, metal-free carbon materials, and hybrid non-precious metal and carbon composites are reviewed. In addition, possible degradation mechanisms for active sites and mitigation strategies are discussed in detail. This review also provides insights into the gaps between R&D of NPMCs for the OER and their applications in practical devices.									20	0	0	0	0	0	19			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000768412800001

In this work, a S and N co-doped graphene supported cobalt-nickel sulfide composite catalyst (rGO@SN-CoNi2S4) was synthesized simply via a one-step hydrothermal method. The as-synthesized CoNi2S4 particles grew in a mosaic manner inside GO lamellae and were encapsulated with graphene. As a bifunctional catalyst, the rGO@SN-CoNi2S4 exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance under alkaline conditions, which only required the overpotential of 142.6 mV (vs. RHE) and 310 mV (vs. RHE) to deliver a current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2) for HER and OER, respectively. The good hydrophilicity of the rGO@SN, the pure phase of bimetallic structure, and the chemical coupling/interaction between the CoNi2S4 and the rGO@SN are attributable to be the possible reasons responsible for the higher HER and OER catalytic activities. Additionally, the rGO@SN-CoNi2S4 also shows a great potential for serving as an excellent cathode and anode electrolyzer during the water splitting process.

For improved device performance and service life, nanostructured electrocatalysts on electrode have been extensively developed based on the principle of structure-activity-stability correlation. However, overall device efficiency is seriously hindered by sluggish oxygen electrocatalysis, including oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. As a result, tremendous efforts have been made to construct the most active surfaces with robust durability. For knowledge-based approaches toward systematic development of highly functional nanostructures, fundamental principles within oxygen electrocatalysis should be uncovered including reaction intermediate, active site structures, and atomic dissolution from surface. However, conventional ex situ characterizations only provide a static picture of electrode surfaces without electrocatalysis. On the other hand, in situ/operando analyses allow us to directly monitor dynamics on electrode under operating conditions. In this review, we will introduce a set of in situ/operando analytical tools and summarize their contribution to fundamental researches on oxygen electrocatalysis. Taking both precious and non-precious electrocatalyst materials as examples, the most impending issues in oxygen electrocatalysis are covered with in situ/operando studies to highlight the power of in situ/operando techniques and encourage further efforts on advanced analytic techniques.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000617155600001

The times to oxygen evolution for the four molten electrolytes hardly varied with change in temperature, but they decreased rapidly with increased current density. As the current density and temperature were varied, the product of current density and time remained constant for a particular electrolyte, which implies that the same electrochemical reaction is occurring. The overall reaction taking place is almost certainly the discharge of nonbridging oxygen ions from the melt to evolve oxygen gas. A delay before gas evolution was caused by the formation of films on the electrode.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0013-4651			WOS:A1993MQ35000022

As the performance of SACs depends on the interaction between the adsorbate atom and supporting substrate, developing more efficient SACs with suitable substrates is of significance. In this work, inspired by the successful fabrications of borophene in experiments, we systematically study the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities of a series of 3d transition metal-based SACs supported by various borophene monolayers (BMs=alpha_sheet, alpha(1)_sheet, and beta(1)_sheet borophene), TM/BMs, using density functional theory calculations and kinetic simulations. All of the TM/BMs systems exhibit superior HER performance compared to Pt with close to zero thermoneutral Gibbs free energy (Delta G(H*)) of H adsorption. Furthermore, three Ni-deposited systems, namely, Ni/alpha_BM, Ni/alpha(1)_BM and Ni/beta(1)_BM, were identified to be superior OER catalysts with remarkably reduced overpotentials. Based on these results, Ni/BMs can be expected to serve as stunning bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting. This work provides a guideline for developing efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000590060300001	33063390

Herein, a new class of heterogeneous OER electrocatalyst (metallic Co nanoparticles anchored on yttrium ruthenate pyrochlore oxide) is provided for securing fast OER kinetics. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (in situ XAS) reveals that fast OER kinetics can be achieved by the harmonious catalytic synergy of a pyrochlore oxide support to Co nanoparticles. By the facile oxidation of yttrium (A-site) and ruthenium (B-site) cations, the pyrochlore oxide support helps to expel the electrons generated from the catalytic behavior of Co to the inner layers of the support, facilitating the electrostatic adsorption of OH- ions and reducing the barrier energy for the formation of CoOOH intermediates. This work affords the rational design of transition metal nanoparticles anchored on pyrochlore oxide heterogeneous catalysts and the fundamental insight of catalytic origin associated with self-reconstruction of OER electrocatalysts.									68	3	0	0	4	0	69			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000484239200017	31192497

While templating approach is useful for the preparation of porous materials in general, it is not effective for the synthesis of oxide-based electrocatalysts owing to the chemical instability of disordered porous materials thus created. Now the synthesis of phase-pure porous yttrium ruthenate pyrochlore oxide using an unconventional porogen of perchloric acid is presented. The lattice oxygen defects are formed by the mixed-valence state of Ru4+/5+ through the partial substitution of Ru4+ with Y3+ cations, leading to the formation of mixed B-site Y-2[Ru1.6Y0.4]O7-delta. This porous Y-2[Ru1.6Y0.4]O7-delta electrocatalyst exhibits a turnover frequency (TOF) of 560 s(-1) (at 1.5 V versus RHE) for the oxygen evolution reaction, which is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the RuO2 reference catalyst (5.41 s(-1)).									71	2	0	0	2	0	71			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000446826200028	30160366

Herein, uniform Co-2(OH)(3)Cl microspheres are developed and present an activation-enhanced OER performance caused by the etching of lattice Cl- after 500 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles. Furthermore, the OER activity of Co-2(OH)(3)Cl can be further enhanced after small amounts of Fe modification (Fe2+ as precursor). Fe doping into Co-2(OH)(3)Cl lattices can make the etching of surface lattice Cl- easier and generate more surface vacancies to absorb oxygen species. Meanwhile, small amounts of Fe modification can result in a moderate surface oxygen adsorption affinity, facilitating the activation of intermediate oxygen species. Consequently, the 10% Fe-Co-2(OH)(3)Cl exhibits a superior OER activity with a lower overpotential of 273 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) (after 500 CV cycles) along with an excellent stability as compared with commercial RuO2.

The electro-catalytical oxygen evolution characteristics of the Co3O4 nanodisks were analyzed from the water-splitting process. The Co3O4 nanodisks exhibited high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with a low Tafel slope of 115.3 mV dec(-1). The onset potential was measured to be 300 mV, while the overpotential to generate 10 mA cm(-2) current density was determined to be 345 mV. Double-layer capacitance calculated from cyclic voltammograms recorded in the range 1.00-1.12 V-RHE was estimated to be 4.1 mF cm(-2) and was twice the value of the electrochemically active surface area. The excellent OER features of the Co3O4 nanodisks were attributed to the highly perforated nanodisks morphology which provided a large specific surface area for the electro-catalytic decomposition of water to release O-2 gas.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1947-2935	1947-2943		WOS:000610417300019

In this paper, 3D hierarchical porous spinel CoFe2O4 hollow nanospheres were first prepared by a facile hydrothermal method. The hollow CoFe2O4 nanospheres have unique bimodal porous structure which consists of micropores and mesopores. The catalytic activity of the CoFe2O4 hollow nanospheres for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has been studied and compared with the acetylene black, the solid CoFe2O4 nanospheres and the commercial Pt/C by using rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technique. The spinel CoFe2O4 hollow nanospheres exhibit superior catalytic activity for the ORR compared to the acetylene black and the solid CoFe2O4 nanospheres. Besides, the spinel CoFe2O4 hollow nanospheres also afford high catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Furthermore, the hollow CoFe2O4 nanospheres show the smallest overpotential between ORR and OER. The chronoamperometric studies show that the CoFe2O4 hollow nanospheres exhibit excellent stability for both the ORR and OER.

In this study, we systematically investigated the OER/ORR electrocatalytic activity of TMN4@G system by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Globally, IrN4@G is a very promising bifunctional catalyst for both OER and ORR with the extremely low overpotentials of 0.30 and 0.26 V, respectively. Such outstanding electrocatalytic performance is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of Ir and N. More importantly, by constructing 2D activity volcano plots, we obtained the limiting overpotentials of TMN4@G system with the values of 0.26 V for OER and 0.24 V for ORR. These findings open up new opportunities for further exploring graphene-based materials for highly efficient OER/ORR electrocatalysts.

We present here the experimental realization of Ti foil supported PtM (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Pd) alloy electrodes by a cycle voltammetry method for seawater splitting. The preliminary results demonstrate that the resultant Ti supported PtM alloy electrodes are robust in realizing high-efficiency hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), arising from enhanced current density, reduced potential, and good durability. By tuning M species, the Ti supported PtPd alloy electrode displays a maximal efficiency, yielding an onset potential of -52 mV and 690 mV (vs RHE) in HER and OER, respectively. The current densities of Ti supported PtPd electrode are as high as 270 mA cm(-2) at 1.32 V (vs RHE) and 590 mA cm(-2) at 3.99 V (vs RHE). Moreover, the long-term stability has also been increased by alloying Pt with M. Although the work presented here is far from optimized, the concept of alloying transition metals with Pt can guide us to design highly efficient alloy electrodes for hydrogen and oxygen evolutions from seawater splitting.

An assembly strategy involves covalently grafting Co corrole 1 onto Fe3O4 nanoarrays grown on Ti mesh. The resulted electrode shows significantly improved activity and durability for OER and ORR in neutral media as compared to Fe3O4 alone and with directly adsorbed 1. It also displays higher atom efficiency (at least two magnitudes larger turnover frequency) than reported electrodes. Using this electrode in a neutral Zn-air battery, a small charge-discharge voltage gap of 1.19 V, large peak power density of 90.4 mW cm(-2), and high rechargeable stability for >100 h are achieved, opening a promising avenue of molecular electrocatalysis in a metal-air battery.

The in situ technique employed for the charge measurement involves galvanostatic charging (OPD O) adsorption), followed by simple discharging (OPD O desorption) experiments. It is observed that surface area estimated by this new technique for the oxidized surfaces of the metals studied here are consistent with those from a.c. impedance spectroscopy.

Herein, we report a facile in situ self-assembly strategy for the synthesis of catalysts (CoMoO4/Co3O4/NF, CoWO4/Co3O4/NF and Co3V2O8/Co3O4/NF) with hierarchical 1D nanostructure. This 1D well-aligned structure and phase interpenetration of mixed Co species provide a rapid channel for charge transfer and mass exchange. Meanwhile, the internal Co3O4 nanowires serve as a framework to host abundant CoMxOy (M = Mo, W, V) materials and this structure is beneficial to the exposure of OER active phases. As a result, these electmcatalysts exhibit excellent OER activities with low overpotentials. Besides, after 1000 voltammetry cycles, only slight increase in the overpotential verifies the excellent stability of these catalysts during the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction process. Based on postmortem characterizations, a dissolution-redeposition process is proposed to explain the formation of Co(oxy)hydroxides on the surface of the catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000722298200003

The optical spectra were continuously acquired during treatment at different pressures (20-140 Pa). The time evolution of different excited radicals (O, H, CO, OH, and CH) allowed for the estimation of the chemical reactions. The oxidation of the material started as soon as the plasma was ignited and slowly intensified until the evaporation of the material was indicated by the appearance of the CH band. As the CH band appeared, a rapid increase in CO and OH was observed, together with a drop in O and a maximum in H. A well-defined minimum in the time needed for the appearance of the CH band was found versus the pressure. The results were explained by heating the polymer due to exothermic physical and chemical reactions and cooling by the surrounding gas.									30	1	0	0	6	0	31			0093-3813	1939-9375		WOS:000290540000007

Herein, a remarkably low overpotential of approximate to 150 mV at 10 mA cm(disk)(-2) in alkaline solutions using one of the non-Fermi liquids, Hg2Ru2O7, is reported. Hg2Ru2O7 displays a rapid increase in current density and excellent durability as an OER catalyst. This outstanding catalytic performance is realized through the coexistence of localized d-bands with the metallic state that is unique to non-Fermi liquids. The findings indicate that non-Fermi liquids could greatly improve the design of highly active OER catalysts.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			2198-3844			WOS:000413166700008	29051858

Herein, we reported considerable improvement in OER performance for ferromagnetic materials (nickel foam) with/after magnetization, the detailed influence on OER for the intensity of magnetic field, the direction of magnetic field, and electrolyte concentration were systematically studied. Besides, the mechanisms for the positive influence and the change of inner structure were also well investigated. Magnetization can dramatically trigger oxygen evolution reaction performance enhancement through the generation of nickel oxide while the intensity and the direction of magnetic field took negligible effect. Magnetization in perpendicular direction contributed to greater improvement when the intensity of magnetic field was large because of the magnetic anisotropy. Moreover, the decrease of overpotential and the increase of CDL can reach around 200 mV and almost double, respectively, with the assist of external magnetization.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000751725300002

We present here a universal approach to construct the free energy landscape of an electrocatalyzed reaction over a single-crystalline model electrode without relying on full kinetics from first principles, a highly computer-resource-demanding approach. The free energies of the transition states are determined by a dedicated evaluation scheme of experimental Tafel plots, whereas ab initio thermodynamics calculations provide the free energies of the reaction intermediates. We exemplified this approach with the chlorine and oxygen evolution reactions over a well-defined RuO2(110) model electrode, both reactions constitute large-scale industrial processes.									23	0	0	0	1	0	23			2196-0216			WOS:000419105200023

Stable electrocatalysts with good electrolytic activity are crucial for long-term water splitting. In this work, we show that MoO2 nanosheets can be grown directly on nickel foam substrate with oxygen vacancies decorated on the surface, acting as an excellent electrocatalyst for practical water splitting. In comparison to the pristine sample, the optimized MoO2, treated by 2% N2H4 solution for 20 min, exhibits a relatively low onset potential of -60 mV vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for HER and a cell voltage of about 1.6 V vs. RHE to achieve a current density of 85 mA cm(-2 )for OER, which are attributed to the enhanced conductivity and improved surface active sites facilitated by oxygen vacancies. With the accelerated hydrogen generation process and activated water oxidation reaction, MoO2 is demonstrated to be a suitable and stable bifunctional electrode for full water splitting, and the post-treatment process for oxygen vacancies also provides an effective strategy for improving electrocatalysis.

While there has been certain progress in the understanding of these electrolyte effects, lack of experimental data for various important systems frequently complicates the rational design of new active materials. Modern proton-exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers utilize Pt-and Ir-based electrocatalysts, which are among the very few materials that are both active and stable under the extreme conditions of water splitting. We use model Pt(111) and Ir-oxide films grown on Ir(111) electrodes and explore the effect of alkali metal cations and sulfate-anions on the hydrogen evolution and the oxygen evolution reactions in acidic media. We demonstrate that sulfate anions decrease the activity of Ir-oxide towards the oxygen evolution reaction while Rb+ drastically promotes hydrogen evolution reaction at the Pt(111) electrodes as compared to the reference HClO4 electrolytes. Issues related to the activity benchmarking for these catalysts are discussed.									25	0	0	0	2	0	25			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000351677600007	25412811

In the past decade, various electrocatalysts have been demonstrated to be electrocatalytically active toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Despite the significant progress, catalyst discovery is still dominated by "trial-and-error" practice due to the lack of understanding of the origin of electrocatalytic activity, active site structures and key factors determining the operando electrocatalytic performance. Therefore, this critical review focuses on summarizing effective catalyst activation strategies to enable efficient catalyst discovery, on the basis of understanding real active sites for the HER and OER. Meanwhile, theory prediction and operando characterization techniques have also been introduced to identify the origin of electrocatalytic activity and active site structures. Moreover, catalyst atomic structure reconstruction/rearrangement under working conditions and the accompanying catalyst activation strategies have been discussed to address the negative impacts of reaction media. Finally, a brief perspective on the challenges and future directions for predicting, characterizing and understanding operando active sites to discover efficient activation strategies will also be presented.									42	1	0	0	5	0	41			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000539350100003

Recently, great achievements on SACs have been made for thermocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and photocatalysis which play an important role in obtaining value-added products. However, it remains a great challenge to fabricate SACs with high metal loading and investigate their reaction mechanisms. Therefore, it is necessary to highlight the recent development of SACs in these fields to guide future research. In this review, we overviewed the thermocatalysis applications of SACs in CO oxidation, preferential oxidation of CO, water-gas shift reaction, methane conversion, methanol steam reforming, aqueous-phase reforming of methanol, hydrogenation of alkynes and dienes, hydrogenation of CO, and hydrogenation of substituted nitroarenes.

Their outer NOC shells have direct contributions to ORR, OER and HER activity that is dominated by N and O dopants that closely correlate with active adjacent C atoms. Meanwhile, the inner cores (CoNi alloys with slight oxidation) can provide indirect and important contributions. Relying on enhanced collective contributions of outer NOC shells and inner cores that are tuned by Co/Ni molar ratios, CoNi(1 : 1)-TB-800N(2) with a Co/Ni molar ratio of 1 : 1 affords optimized multifunctional activity. Furthermore, it also brings about optimal Zn-air battery performance: similar to 98.6% and similar to 74.8% of theoretical specific capacity and energy density, respectively, and more than 100 h of stable charge-discharge operation at high current densities.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000601282900021

This work reports the in situ development of sawtooth-like Co(TCNQ)(2) (TCNQ=tetracyanoquinodimethane) metal-organic framework array on Co foil (Co(TCNQ)(2)/Co) by means of a solution immersion method at room temperature. As an oxygen-evolving catalyst, the resulting Co(TCNQ)(2)/Co demonstrates superior OER activity with overpotential of 310 mV to drive a geometrical catalytic current density of 15 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. Notably, it also shows good long-term electrochemical durability with its activity being retained for at least 20 h and achieves a high turnover frequency of 0.66 molO(2)s(-1) at overpotential of 380 mV.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000424792600007	29314340

However, the multiple valence of transition metal always troubles the realization of its active site as it influences the band structure and conductivity simultaneously, hampering a further effective electrocatalyst design. Here in this report we have found that the hydrogen evolution reaction activity of La0.67Sr0.33MnO3-sigma is similar to 50% improved by the oxygen non-stoichiometry via introducing oxygen vacancy compared to La0.67Sr0.33MnO3. Although La0.67Sr0.33MnO3, exhibits a resistance satisfaction, the increase of active valence state Mn3+ is responsible for the overall higher catalysis activity. Our study clearly shows a trade-off strategy for an improvement of hydrogen evolution reaction based on transition metal oxide. (C) 2020 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Hence, in this respect, the CeO2 coral reef made up of nanosheets is studied focusing on the oxygen vacancy that affects the water oxidation reaction. First, CeO2 was prepared in an oyster shell/crucible with the presence/absence of urea by a simple calcination technique to tune the oxygen vacancy. More oxygen vacancy was detected in CeO2 prepared from urea and oyster shell, which is evidenced from Raman and PL analyses. Further, the oyster shell-treated sample was found to be of nanosheet type with numerous pores as observed via TEM analysis. The theoretical approach was adopted to expose the role of oxygen vacancies and the fate of scavenging agents in the water oxidation mechanism. It was observed that an oxygen vacancy plays a vital role in minimizing the activation energy hump and opposes the reverse reaction. The apparent conversion efficiency of 7.1% is calculated for the oxygen evolution reaction. Oxygen vacancy, quantum confinement effect, and charge separation efficiency are mainly responsible for the better photocatalyzed water oxidation reaction and hydroxyl radical production. This investigation will help in providing valuable information toward designing cost-effective oxygen vacancy-oriented nanosheet systems and the importance of vacancy in the water-splitting reaction.									16	0	0	0	2	0	16			2470-1343			WOS:000530659700020	32391466

According to polarization measurements, the activity of anodes at overpotentials below 100 mV is independent of coating mass. However, impedance measurements above 100 mV reveal changes in the activity of anodes in chlorine evolution reaction for different coating masses. The diffusion limitations related to the evolved chlorine are registered in low-frequency domain at 1.10 V (SCE), diminishing with the increase in potential to the 1.15 V (SCE). The observed impedance behavior is discussed with respect to the activity model for activated titanium anodes in chlorine evolution reaction involving formation of gas channels within porous coating structure. Gas channels enhance the mass transfer rate similarly to the forced convection, which also increases the activity of anode. This is more pronounced for the anode of greater coating mass due to its more compact surface structure. The more compact structure appears to be beneficial for gas channels formation.					8th International Frumkin Symposium on Kinetics of Electrode Processes8th International Frumkin Symposium on Kinetics of Electrode Processes	OCT 18-22, 2005OCT 18-22, 2005	Russian Federat, Minist Educ & Sci; Russian Acad Sci, Chem & Mat Sci Div; Frumkin Inst Phys Chem & Electrochem; Moscow Stat UnivRussian Federat, Minist Educ & Sci; Russian Acad Sci, Chem & Mat Sci Div; Frumkin Inst Phys Chem & Electrochem; Moscow Stat Univ	Moscow, RUSSIAMoscow, RUSSIA	15	2	0	0	1	0	17			1023-1935			WOS:000241566300010

The influence of variation in composition on the electrocatalytic activity of Ni-Co oxides (Ni:Co = 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is explored in high-pH media. The lattice structure, size, morphology, and surface composition of the synthesized nanocatalysts have been carefully verified by using X-ray diffraction and various microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. Among the synthesized catalysts, the Ni-Co oxide with Ni:Co = 1:3 exhibits the best electrochemical performance with onset potentials of 0.86 and 1.51 V for ORR and OER, respectively. Furthermore, it demonstrates a small potential difference (0.82 V) between the potential corresponding to 10 mA cm(-2) current density for OER and the half-wave potential for ORR. The catalyst exhibits admirable catalytic capability, almost comparable to that of the benchmark Pt/C catalyst and rivalling that of the IrO2/C catalyst for OER This work shed light on the development of a highly active non-precious metal-based energy conversion catalyst and the effect of variation of compositional ratios on the electro-catalytic performance, which will further help rationally design efficient electrocatalysts for sustainable energy applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000813012800001

Herein, a new Ni/MoxC (MoC, Mo2C) nanoparticle-supported N-doped graphene/carbon nanotube hybrid (NC) catalyst is developed via a facile, one-step integrated strategy, which can catalyze both the HER and OER in an efficient and robust manner. The catalyst affords low overpotentials of 162 and 328 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) for HER and OER, respectively, in alkaline medium, which either compares favorably or exceeds most of the Mo-based catalysts documented in the literature. It is believed that there is an electronic synergistic effect among MoxC, Ni, and NC, wherein a tandem electron transfer process (Ni -> MoxC -> NC) may be responsible for promoting the HER as well as OER activity. This work opens a new avenue toward the development of multicomponent, highly efficient but inexpensive electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									129	4	0	0	6	0	129			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000447954600023	30244572

Typical reactions, which are important to catalyze in this respect, include CO2 reduction, the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions as well as the oxygen reduction reaction. The most efficient catalysts known up-to-date for these processes usually contain expensive and scarce elements, substantially impeding implementation of such electrocatalysts at a larger scale. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their derivatives containing affordable components and building blocks, as an emerging class of porous functional materials, have been recently attracting a great attention thanks to their tunable structure and composition together with high surface area, just to name a few. Up to now, several MOFs and MOF-derivatives have been reported as electrode materials for the energy-related electrocatalytic application. In this review article, we summarize and analyze current approaches to design such materials.

In this work, a nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube encapsulated with metallic cobalt nanoparticles (Co@NC) was synthesized through a facile method and subsequent pyrolysis treatment. The field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Raman spectra investigations demonstrate that the presence of Co induces the formation of carbon nanotube during the pyrolysis process and increase degree of graphitization of carbon nanotubes. The electrode activity is assessed by comparing OER with ORR indicators (Delta E). The Delta E value of Co@NC is 0.91 V, which is lower than the commercialized Pt/C (1.1 V) and nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) (1.17 V).

A multifunctional electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, and oxygen reduction reactions (HER/OER/ORR) involved in the water-splitting process was fabricated using a simple and eco-friendly strategy. The present study involves the simple synthesis of nanostructured nickel selenide (NiSe) via a hydrothermal method. The different phases of nickel selenide and their dependency on the precursor concentration were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The morphologies of coral-like structured pure and Mo-doped NiSe (Ni1-xMoxSe) samples were investigated systematically using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The as-prepared Ni0.5Mo0.5Se material showed an enhanced electrochemical activity of 1.57 V @ 10 mA/cm(2) for OER and 0.19 V @ 10 mA/cm(2) to HER, and follows the Volmer-Heyrovsky for HER mechanism. In addition, the electrocatalyst exhibits a large electrochemical surface area and high stability. Therefore, the hydrothermally synthesized Ni1-xMoxSe has been proven to be a perfect platinum-free trifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting process.

High-throughput discovery strategies typically employ a fast, reliable initial screening technique that is able to identify active catalyst composition regions. Traditional electrochemical characterization via current-voltage measurements is inherently throughput-limited, as such measurements are most readily performed by serial screening. Parallel screening methods can yield much higher throughput and generally require the use of an indirect measurement of catalytic activity. In a water-splitting reaction, the change of local pH or the presence of oxygen and hydrogen in the solution can be utilized for parallel screening of active electrocatalysts. Previously reported techniques for measuring these signals typically function in a narrow pH range and are not suitable for both strong acidic and basic environments. A simple approach to screen the electrocatalytic activities by imaging the oxygen and hydrogen bubbles produced by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is reported here. A custom built electrochemical cell was employed to record the bubble evolution during the screening, where the testing materials were subject to desired electrochemical potentials. The transient of the bubble intensity obtained from the screening was quantitatively analyzed to yield a bubble figure of merit (FOM) that represents the reaction rate. Active catalysts in a pseudoternary material library, (Ni-Fe-Co)O-x, which contains 231 unique compositions, were identified in less than one minute using the bubble screening method.

However, the real active sites in metal phosphides remain a debate. Herein, the hierarchical flower-like NiCoP microsphere is designed with the outstanding performance toward both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (overpotentials of 238 and 47 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively). The symmetrical overall water splitting devices based on NiCoP only require an ultralow voltage of 1.52 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2), which is rarely reported. In-situ Raman and ex-situ TEM/XPS reveal that the surface reconstruction of designed NiCoP pre-catalysts transforms into metallic Ni(Co) for HER and Ni(Co)OOH for OER, respectively. The degradation process of HER during resting is revealed, suggesting the formation of high valence state Ni(Co)(OH)(2) and blocking the active sites. We believe that the comprehensive understanding of the surface reconstruction of electrode is crucial in understanding the fundamental mechanism. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, cost-efficient electrocatalysts with good water oxidation performance and stability are highly desired in widespread implementation of the hydrogen production from water splitting. This paper proposes a facile corrosion-reconstruction strategy to transform Fe surface into a Fe-Co hydroxide layer to improve the oxygen evolution activity. The as-prepared catalyst was measured to have an over-potentential as low as 320 mV at 100 mA.cm(-2), and its stability even exceeded 600 h. Surface and Raman spectroscopy analyses indicated that the catalyst experienced chemical changes from hydroxides to oxyhydroxides and Co2+ to Co3+ during oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The corrosion-reconstruction is not only an economical method to synthesize a highly efficient, stable and durable Fe-based catalysts, it also converses the detrimental corrosion into a beneficial catalyst fabrication process.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000856614800001

Herein, a molybdenum oxide-FeCoCu alloy hybrid (MoOx-FeCoCu) catalyst was designed by polyoxometallate (POM) molecular cluster mediated solvothermal alcoholysis and ammonolysis of metal salts followed by pyrolytic reduction treatment. The HER efficiency is substantially enhanced by the ternary alloy component, which is more close to the benchmark Pt/C catalyst, and the HER catalytic stability is also superior to Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, the MoOx-FeCoCu demonstrates high catalytic efficiency and rather good durability for OER. Benefitted by the bifunctional catalytic behaviors for HER and OER, the symmetric water electrolyzer based on the MoOx-FeCoCu electrode requires a low driving voltage of 1.69 V to deliver a response current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is comparable to that based on the benchmark Pt/C HER cathode and RuO2 OER anode. The current work offers a feasible way to design efficient bifunctional catalyst for water electrolysis via POM mediated co-assembly and calcination treatment. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Key to the improvement of catalytic performance lies the development of efficient catalytic electrodes. Besides the exploration of highly active catalysts, the fast removal of the gas products on the electrode surface should be realized because the adhered gas bubbles would block the following catalytic reactions and decrease the efficiency. In this paper, we introduce an ideal structure, a "superaerophobic" surface, to diminish the negative effects caused by the adhered gas bubbles. Several recent works focusing on addressing this issue are presented with the target reactions of hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution. It is demonstrated that micro/nano-engineering of the catalyst directly on the current collector is a promising approach to minimize the negative effective induced by the gas bubble adhesion. In the last section, we also discuss the promise of this methodology for other energy related systems.									113	14	0	0	3	0	114			2051-6347	2051-6355		WOS:000353586300003

However, its microscopic catalytic mechanism is not clear. In this paper, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of three typical bifunctional anti-perovskite catalysts Ni3ZnC, Co3ZnC and Ni3FeN were calculated for the first time. Comprehensive analysis reveals that HER catalytic performance ranking: Ni3ZnC (100) > Ni3FeN (111) > Co3ZnC (100). Combined with the OER catalytic activity, we concluded that Ni3ZnC (100) may have the best bifunctional performance. We also calculated the transition-metal doping effect and concluded that the doping of Fe for Co3ZnC and Cu for Ni3FeN may further enhance the bifunctional catalytic activity. The effect of experimentally common carbon vacancies was calculated to be detrimental to the HER performance. Our work gave an atomic perspective of HER and OER catalytic mechanisms of anti-perovskites, which is helpful for the further development of water splitting electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000817819100005

Here, we show that a previously overlooked discharge current in the low applied potential region also leads to in situ electrochemical activation of a nitrogen-doped nickel oxyhydroxide surface. We exploit the fact that doping of heteroatoms weakens the surface structure, and hence, a weak discharge current originating from the capacitive nature of nickel oxyhydroxide has a strong structure-reforming ability to promote the formation of nitrogen and oxygen vacancies. The current density at 1.4 V (vs. Hg/HgO) can dramatically increase by as much as 31.3 % after discharge in the low applied potential region. This work provides insight into in situ enhancement of the OER and suggests that the low applied potential region must be a primary consideration in evaluating the origin of the activity of electrocatalysts.									7	1	0	0	1	0	8			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000681753800001	34254417

Here, a secondary single-atom regulation strategy is developed to tailor the coordination environment and thus modify the catalytic behaviors of single atom Ni catalysts. Through introducing atomically dispersed Fe moieties, the coordination environment of single Ni atom is well regulated with a higher Ni-N/O coordination number due to the long-range electronic penetration interaction, which triggers more optimized adsorption strength between active sites and reaction intermediates. As a result, the obtained Fe, Ni dual atom catalyst (FeNi-SAs@NC) requires only 298 mV overpotential to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis outperforming the benchmarking IrO2 (313 mV), Fe-SAs@NC (335 mV) and Ni-SAs@NC (356 mV) electrocatalysts. Moreover, FeNi-SAs@NC performs superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity to the single-atom counterparts and Pt/C benchmark. The practical application of the FeNi-SAs@NC is further validated by a higher ZAB performance (260 mW cm(-2) vs 71 mW cm(-2) for Pt/C-IrO2), improved long-term durability (100 h at 20 mA cm(-2)) and encouraging performance in all-solid-sate ZABs (70 mW cm(-2)).									32	3	0	0	1	0	32			2405-8297			WOS:000621366200005

Here, how the spatial distribution of the heteroatom modulates photocatalytic reduction (hydrogen evolution) and oxidation (oxygen evolution) reaction preferences is investigated by moving boron from the core to the shell of an anatase TiO2 microsphere along [001] via thermal diffusion control. The preference towards photocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen producing reactions from splitting water can be switched by creating a shell with an interstitial Bs+ (s = 3) gradient in the TiO2 microsphere. This switching stems from the downward shift of electronic band edges of the shell by a band bending effect that originates from the extra electrons coming from the interstitial Bs+. These results create new opportunities for designing and constructing efficient photocatalysts by spatial heteroatom engineering.									117	10	0	0	8	0	119			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000307006200013		
J	Ma, Xiu-Xiu; He, Xing-Quan								Cobalt oxide anchored on nitrogen and sulfur dual-doped graphene foam as an effective oxygen electrode catalyst in alkaline media								APPLIED MATERIALS TODAY				4				1	8		10.1016/j.apmt.2016.04.002				SEP 2016	2016	Developing highly active bifunctional catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the oxygen electrocatalysis based energy conversion or storage remains challenges. Herein, an efficient catalyst of cobalt oxide (Co3O4) nanocrystals grown on nitrogen and sulfur co-doped graphene foam (NSGF) is prepared via a hydrothermal method. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements demonstrate Co3O4 is of regular single crystal morphology in the Co3O4/NSGF composite with 1:1 mass ratio of cobalt to graphene foam. For ORR, the hybrid favors a direct 4e- pathway, similar to that of Pt/C, but outperforms Pt/C with a long-term durability. Besides, it achieves a small overpotential of 0.48 V vs. SCE at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and there is only 0.018 V vs. SCE overpotential increasing after 200 cycles for OER testing. The good electrochemical activities of our fabricated bifunctional catalyst are attributed to electrochemical contributions of the loaded Co3O4 nanocrystals, the integral structure of three-dimensional graphene foam, the heteroatoms doping effects and the synergistic effects between Co3O4 and NSGF.

Highly active, cost-effective, and robust photoelectrodes are undoubtedly crucial for the PEC technology. To achieve this goal, transition-metal-based electrocatalysts have been widely used as cocatalysts to improve the performance of PEC cells for water splitting. Herein, this Review summarizes the recent progresses of the design, synthesis, and application of transition-metal-based electrocatalysts as cocatalysts for PEC water splitting. Mo, Ni, Co-based electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and Co, Ni, Fe-based electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are emphasized as cocatalysts for efficient PEC HER and OER, respectively. Particularly, some most efficient and robust photoelectrode systems with record photocurrent density or durability for the half reactions of HER and OER are highlighted and discussed. In addition, the self-biased PEC devices with high solar-to-hydrogen efficiency based on earth-abundant materials are also addressed. Finally, this Review is concluded with a summary and remarks on some challenges and opportunities for the further development of transition-metal-based electrocatalysts as cocatalysts for PEC water splitting.									151	11	0	0	8	2	156			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000436168700002	29575653

This opens new chances and opportunities to the field of electrolysis and water splitting, where perovskite oxides show promising catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). While representing ideal model systems for improving our scientific understanding of atomistic processes and scaling relations during OER, epitaxial heterostructures furthermore give access to atomic band engineering strategies and allow the generation of hybrid materials, which may combine beneficial properties of neighboring materials on the nanoscale. These strategies render novel opportunities to enhance chemical stability and to tune overpotentials of OER-active perovskite materials, not accessible in the bulk. Epitaxial catalysts can therefore play an important role in achieving new breakthroughs and guide lines in the field.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2515-7655			WOS:000571496800001

Theoretical work attributes their activity to oxyl or mu(1)-O species. Verifying this intermediate experimentally has, however, been challenging. In the present study, these challenges were overcome by combining theory with new experimental strategies. Ab initio molecular dynamics of the solid-liquid interface were used to predict spectroscopic features, whereas sample architecture, developed for surface-sensitive X-ray spectroscopy of electrocatalysts in confined liquid, was used to search for these species under realistic conditions. Through this approach, we have identified mu(1)-O species during oxygen evolution. Potentiodynamic X-ray absorption additionally shows that these mu(1)-O species are created by electrochemical oxidation currents in a deprotonation reaction.									27	0	0	0	2	0	27			1932-7447			WOS:000464768600074

Hierarchical porous activated carbon (HPAC) shows potential applications for the OER. HPAC derived from fallen leaves (Fraxinus chinensis) is prepared using a facile method, in which KOH and/or K2CO3 are used as activators. Characterization reveals that HPAC in the system of KOH/K2CO3 has a high surface area and possesses abundant hierarchical pores, which are favorable for mass transfer and charge transfer in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Acid washed HPAC displays relatively low activity and electrochemical tests demonstrate that ash composition may contribute to the OER. HPAC is a potential carbon-based catalyst that has prominent OER activity and durability.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17				2046-2069		WOS:000387621700082

Herein, an ORR/OER bifunctional pre catalyst consists of Co/VN heterojunction supported by N-doped carbon (NC) with three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) architecture was fabricated. The VN was introduced as sacrificial promoter to facilitate the oxidization and self-reconstruction of Co into Co3O4 and CoOOH during OER process, which acts as the real active OER component. On the other hand, the Co-decorated N-doped carbon is the active species for ORR reaction. Meanwhile, the 3DOM structure design also provides a large specific surface area and exposes rich active sites. Benefiting from those advantages, the Co/VN@NC exhibits good activity and stability towards ORR and OER reactions comparable with commercial catalysts. Moreover, density functional theory calculations confirmed that Co3O4 and CoOOH exhibit higher adsorption energy for OH- and present an exothermic reaction in the OER process, which is beneficial to OER reaction. The ZABs using Co/VN@NC as bifunctional catalyst exhibits a high specific capacity of 775.68 mAh g(-1) under 10 mA cm(-2) and ultralong charge-discharge cycle life about 200 h at 20 mA cm(-2). This work provides a new strategy of using sacrificial heterojunction for the development of efficient and durable bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000772965000005

Herein, the active site of nickel oxide nanosheets by manganese modulation is investigated in an electrocatalytic oxygen evolution system. The electronic structure could be realized by Mn modulation. The intrinsic catalytic activity of Ni3+ (t(2g)(6)e(g)(1)) and Jahn-Teller active Mn3+ (t(2g)(3)e(g)(1)) species act synergistically to promote the elctrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction. X-ray absorption near-edge structure analysis indicates that the Ni3+ and Mn3+ in Ni0.75Mn0.25 nanosheets should result from nickel vacancies and oxygen vacancies, respectively. The resulting Ni0.75Mn0.25 nanosheets show much higher oxygen evolution activity than those of NiO and Mn2O3. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the Ni and Mn act synergistically to promote formation of the O-O bond. Our work provides a comprehensive understanding of the active site of porous nickel oxide nanosheets by manganese modulation and rational design of electrocatalysts with precisely engineered structures and electrical properties.									103	7	0	0	3	0	103			2380-8195			WOS:000445052900020

The overall oxygen electrode activity was calculated to be as low as 0.77V.

However, developing a competent and robust bifunctional oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER) catalyst and studying the underlying active-site mechanisms with the aim of optimizing the electrochemical process remains challenging. In this work, defective/graphitic synergy in heteroatom-interlinked-triggered asphaltene (D/G-HASP) is explored via Raman spectroscopy, density functional theory (DFT), and other characterization approaches, in which reactions involving the oxygen-containing intermediates on the carbon substrate can be accelerated by the electron deficit triggered by heteroatoms, thus enhancing the oxygen reaction performance. As estimated, D/G-HASP reveals a superior half-wave potential (E-1/2 = 840 mV) and the lowest overpotential (eta(10) = 310 mV) towards the ORR and OER compared to its other counterparts. Remarkably, zinc-air batteries primed with such an air-electrode show outstanding reversibility and stability. This effort hence delivers insightful understanding of the synergistic reaction principles of heteroatom-interlinked-triggering nanomaterials when used in zinc-air batteries.									38	0	0	0	4	0	38			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000686891600001

Operando spectroscopy captures metastable active surfaces and computational spectroscopy uses this information to aid in building models for first principles reaction simulations. Herein, we review recent efforts and outline future opportunities to study the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by combining operando spectroscopies and first principles modeling. We begin by showcasing how explicit simulation of operando-collected spectra has helped validate an OER mechanism over Ir-based catalysts involving electron-deficient oxygen, or OI-. We continue by reviewing efforts on 3d transition metal (TM) oxyhydroxides, where operando studies again suggest OI- is critical. While for these materials, changes in O(I- )coverage have been argued to cause qualitative mechanistic differences, comparative operando and computational spectroscopic studies are still lacking. We close by outlining how such comparative studies would aid in testing mechanistic claims on 3d TM oxyhydroxides.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2451-9103			WOS:000836472200005

The key challenge is to achieve such activation without damaging the frameworks. Here it is demonstrated that atmospheric-pressure low-temperature plasma generated in air improve catalytic properties of an Fe/Co bimetallic cyanide framework through the specific soft incorporation of reactive oxygen species without affecting the framework structure. The bonding and oxidative states of the high-density catalytic metal sites in the framework are modified while the nanoporous nature of the framework is retained, which leads to superior catalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction at high current densities close to the operation conditions of commercial alkaline electrolyzers.									109	2	0	0	5	0	109			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000436103300027

Thus, it is important to synthesize an active OER electrocatalysts with abundant active sites, favorable conductivity and good durability. Herein, a facile reduction method using NaBH4 as readily available reductant has been developed to fabricate the reduced CoFe2O4 nanosheets (NS). The obtained reduced CoFe2O4 NS are rich in oxygen deficient sites, leading to more active sites as well as the enhanced conductivity than the pristine CoFe2O4 hollow nanosphere, which reaches the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at the overpotential of 320 mV in 1 M KOH. Meanwhile, CoFe2O4 samples with three different morphology nanostructures including hollow nanospheres, bulk and nanoparticles have been provided to study the effect of different morphology on NaBH4 reduction efficiency. As expected, after NaBH4 reduction, CoFe2O4 hollow nanosphere with relatively higher surface area exhibits most obvious improvement for OER activity and also its corresponding reduced CoFe2O4 NS showed best OER performance than the reduced CoFe2O4 bulk as well as the reduced CoFe2O4 nanoparticles, implying the hollow nanospheres feature more accessible surface area than bulk and nanoparticles samples, thus greatly facilitate efficiency of NaBH4 reduction treatment.

J	Gong Zhang; Jing-hong Li								Tailoring oxygen vacancy on Co3O4 nanosheets with high surface area for oxygen evolution reactiondagger								Chinese Journal of Chemical Physics				31	4			517	22		10.1063/1674-0068/31/cjcp1805127				Aug. 2018	2018	Electrochemical water splitting requires efficient water oxidation catalysts to accelerate the sluggish kinetics of water oxidation reaction. Here, we designed an efficient Co3O4 electrocatalyst using a pyrolysis strategy for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Morphological characterization confirmed the ultra-thin structure of nanosheet. Further, the existence of oxygen vacancies was obviously evidenced by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electron spin resonance spectroscopy. The increased surface area of Co3O4 ensures more exposed sites, whereas generated oxygen vacancies on Co3O4 surface create more active defects. The two scenarios were beneficial for accelerating the OER across the interface between the anode and electrolyte. As expected, the optimized Co3O4 nanosheets can catalyze the OER efficiently with a low overpotential of 310 mV at current density of 10 mA/cm2 and remarkable long-term stability in 1.0 mol/L KOH.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1674-0068			INSPEC:18177555		
J	Kumar, Manish; Piccinin, Simone; Srinivasan, Varadharajan								Direct and indirect role of Fe doping in NiOOH monolayer for water oxidation catalysis								CHEMPHYSCHEM				23	14					e202200085	10.1002/cphc.202200085		MAY 2022		JUL 19 2022	2022	Water oxidation activity of pristine NiOOH is greatly enhanced by doping it with Fe. However, the precise role of Fe is still being debated. Using a first-principles DFT+U approach, we investigate the direct and indirect roles of Fe in enhancing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of NiOOH monolayers. Considering two Mars-Van-Krevelen mechanisms of OER based on the source of O-O bond formation, we show that a mechanism involving the coupling of lattice oxygen is generally more favorable than water nucleophilic attack on lattice oxygen. On doping with Fe, the overpotential of NiOOH is reduced by 0.33 V, in excellent agreement with experimental findings. Introducing Fe at active sites results in different potential determining steps (PDS) in the two mechanisms. The Ni sites in pristine and Fe-doped NiOOH have the same PDS regardless of the mechanism. The Fe sites not only have the lowest overpotential but also decrease the overpotential for Ni sites.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000802870100001	35491429

The resulting Pt-modified nickel foams (Pt/Ni foams) are characterized using complementary electrochemical and materials analysis techniques. These include electron microscopy to examine the morphology of the deposited material, cyclic voltammetry to evaluate the electrochemical surface area of the deposited Pt, and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry to determine the mass of deposited Pt on the Ni foam substrate. The effect of potential cycling in alkaline media on the electrochemical behavior of the material and the stability of Pt deposit is studied. In the second part of this paper, the Pt/Ni foams are applied as electrode materials for hydrogen evolution, hydrogen reduction, oxygen reduction, and oxygen evolution reactions in an aqueous alkaline electrolyte. The electrocatalytic activity of the electrodes toward these processes is evaluated using linear sweep voltammetry curves and Tafel plots. The results of these studies demonstrate that nickel foams are acceptable support materials for nanoscopic Pt electrocatalysts and that the resulting Pt/Ni foams are excellent electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction. An unmodified Ni foam is shown to be a highly active electrode for the oxygen evolution reaction.									63	2	0	0	4	0	65			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000340446300032	25028769

Various strategies focused on oxygen vacancy engineering are proved to be efficient for further improving the electrocatalytic performance of Co3O4. Herein, an optimal Co3O4 with rich oxygen vacancies have been synthesized via a two-step process combining solution reduction and Ni2+ impregnation. The as-prepared electrocatalyst exhibits an enhanced oxygen evolution performance with the overpotential of 330 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline condition, which is 84 mV lower than that of pristine one. With the increasing of oxygen vacancies, the charge transfer efficiency and surface active area are relatively enhanced reflected by the Tafel slope and double-layer capacitance measurement. These results indicate that combination of solution reduction and heteroatom doping can be a valid way for efficient metal oxides-based electrocatalyst development by constructing higher concentration of oxygen vacancy.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000727004900001	34808610

Tafel slopes vary from a low value of 42 mV/decade up to 222 mV/decade at room temperature. The high exchange current densities and high Tafel slopes compared with those obtained from the RuO2 DSA electrode at the crystalline single phase metal oxide electrodes suggest that they are better electrocatalysts at low overpotentials. A favorable change in the Tafel slope for the oxygen evolution reaction occurs as the ruthenium content increases. Substitution of Ti for Ru in the perovskite solid solutions enhanced their chemical stability by losing marginal electrochemical activity.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			0253-2964			WOS:A1997YB01800013

The Co1-xS/CFP electrode not only enhances the oxygen evolution reaction performance, eta = 0.328 V (10 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel slope at about 48.5 mV dec(-1), but also has excellent durability.

Optimizing the valence state on the spinet surface has always been the focus of research because it is key for realizing efficient oxygen evolution reaction. In this paper, we introduced metal Ru into spinet oxide NiCo2O4 to adjust the valence state of the cations on the spinet surface, achieving a suitable ion ratio of Co2+ /Co3+. The catalytic performance is the best when the doping concentration of Ru is 5.7% (NiCo1.7Ru0.3O4). In 1.0 M KOH, NiCo1.7Ru0.3O4 required only 280 mV overpotential to drive the current of 10 mA.cm(-2). The incorporation of Ru induces more Co2+ on the octahedral site and changes the valence state of Co, optimizing the adsorption of the oxygen intermediate. In addition, the coordinated charge transfer between Ru, Co, and Ni will also accelerate the reaction. These results confirm that the Ru doping process can not only change the electrochemical performance of spinet oxides but also provide new insights into the design of OER (Oxygen evolution reaction) catalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000618298700002

Both cubic, metallic perovskites have similar Co-IV intermediate spin states and onset potentials, but a substantially smaller lattice parameter and shorter surface oxygen separation make CaCoO3 a more stable catalyst with increased OER activity. The onset potentials are similar, occurring where H+ is removed from surface -OH-, but two competing surface reactions determine the catalytic activity. In one, the surface -O- is attacked by electrolyte OH- to form the surface -OOH-; in the other, two -O- form a surface peroxide ion and an oxygen vacancy with electrolyte OH- attacking the oxygen vacancy. The second pathway can be faster if the surface oxygen separation is smaller.									96	5	0	0	6	0	96			2375-2548			WOS:000481798400008	31448324

This paper reports that sulfur incorporation into nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH-S) can fulfill the abovementioned requirements for seawater oxidation. Sulfidation was performed on NiFe-LDH nanosheets homogeneously grown on a porous carbon scaffold via a facile chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process.

Their high aspect ratio contributes to the formation of a corn-shaped layer structure of the poorly crystalline lithium peroxide (Li2O2) nanoparticles produced by oxygen reduction in poly-ether based electrolyte solutions. The nanowire morphology seems to provide the necessary large contact area and facile electron supply for a very effective oxygen reduction reaction. The unique morphology and structure of the Li2O2 deposits and the catalytic nature of the silver nano-wires promote decomposition of Li2O2 at low potentials (below 3.4 V) upon the oxygen evolution. This situation avoids decomposition of the solution species and oxidation of the electrodes during the anodic (charge) reactions, leading to high electrical efficiently of lithium-oxygen batteries.

Despite much scientific effort, the mechanism of the oxygen reduction in aprotic solvents in the presence of Li+ ions is still not fully understood. In this work, rotating ring disk electrode and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry experiments have been employed to investigate the influence of the oxygen partial pressure on the oxygen reduction and evolution reaction at gold, glassy carbon, and platinum electrodes. A further aim was to elucidate the different pathways leading to peroxide formation and to analyze their importance for the overall reaction. As expected, the electrochemical reaction order for the superoxide formation is unity. Despite that, the reaction order for the reaction path leading to peroxide is below unity, indicating the participation of an adsorption step. This is further indicated by the finding that the amount of peroxide deposited on the surface changes only very slightly upon increasing the oxygen concentration. While the oxygen reduction at glassy carbon and platinum takes place via the parallel formation of superoxide and peroxide, there is a distinct transition between superoxide and peroxide formation at the gold electrode. This transition occurs close to a potential where the rate of superoxide formation is mainly limited by diffusion. By investigating the rotation dependence of the collection efficiency, it can be shown that the peroxide formation at gold indeed proceeds via a direct reduction step without the formation of.a soluble intermediate. This finding adds to the current mechanistic picture which only differentiates between the electrochemical and the chemical formation of lithium peroxide. For platinum and glassy carbon, this direct reduction without the formation of soluble intermediates cannot be noted. Based on these observations, a reaction scheme is presented including rate constants for the different reaction pathways.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			1932-7447			WOS:000399629000012

The advanced electrocatalysts can significantly reduce the reaction energy barrier to realize high-efficiency energy conversion. In this regard, noble-metal catalysts display excellent catalytic performance for the water splitting reaction, but the high cost hinders its large-scale application. As a low-cost candidate for noble-metal catalysts, tungsten oxide is endowed with the variable crystalline phase and adjustable composition, which provide more opportunities to achieve satisfactory catalytic activity by engineering crystal structure and modulating surface electronic states. To promote the reaction activity and stability, some effective strategies have been developed to optimize the surface crystal and electronic structure of tungsten oxide electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. In this review, we especially highlight the latest advances and progress in the exploration of tungsten oxide electrocatalysts for HER and OER, and systematically classify these strategies into several design principles involving adjustable surface morphology, engineering defects, and synergistic catalysis, providing a deep understanding of the relationship between the catalytic activity and crystal structure in the tungsten oxide. Some perspectives are also proposed to guide a rational design of tungsten oxide electrocatalyst for water splitting.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2196-0216			WOS:000711034700001

Furthermore, Pt or Ir-related materials have been extensively utilized as electrocatalysts for the OER, ORR, and MOR. To reduce the utilization of precious metals, innovative catalyst structures should be proposed. Herein, we report a bi-metallic phosphide (Ni2P and PdP2) structure surrounded by graphitic carbon (Ni-Pd-P/C) with an enhanced electrochemical activity as compared to conventional electrocatalysts. Despite the low Pd content of 3 at%, Ni-Pd-P/C exhibits a low overpotential of 330 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in the OER, high specific activity (2.82 mA cm(-2) at 0.8 V) for the ORR, and a high current density of 1.101 A mg(-1) for the MOR. The superior electrochemical performance of Ni-Pd-P/C may be attributed to the synergistic effect of the bi-metallic phosphide structure and core-shell structure formed by graphitic carbon.

Polyhydroxy Fullerenes Enhance Antibacterial and Electrocatalytic Activity of Silver Nanoparticles								NANOMATERIALS				12	19					3321	10.3390/nano12193321				OCT 2022	2022	Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are known and widely used for their antibacterial properties. However, the ever-increasing resistance of microorganisms compels the design of novel nanomaterials which are able to surpass their capabilities. Herein, we synthesized silver nanoparticles using, for the first time, polyhydroxy fullerene (PHF) as a reducing and capping agent, through a one-pot synthesis method. The resulting nanoparticles (PHF-AgNPs) were compared to AgNPs that were synthesized using sodium citrate (citrate-AgNPs). They were characterized using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), dynamic light scattering, and UV-visible spectroscopy. Our results showed that PHF-AgNPs have a smaller size and a narrower size distribution than citrate-AgNPs, which suggests that PHF may be a better capping agent than citrate. Antibacterial assays using E. coli showed enhanced antimicrobial activity for PHF-AgNPs compared to citrate-AgNPs. The electrocatalytic activity of nanoparticles towards oxygen evolution and reduction reaction (OER and ORR, respectively) was tested through cyclic voltammetry. Both nanoparticles are found to promote OER and ORR, but PHF-AgNPs showed a significant increase in activity with respect to citrate-AgNPs. Thus, our results demonstrate that the properties of forming nanoparticles can be tuned by choosing the appropriate reducing/capping agent. Specifically, this suggests that PHF-AgNPs can find potential applications for both catalytic and biomedical applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2079-4991		WOS:000866943900001	36234449

The surface of catalysts always plays an important role in catalytic reactions. Herein, we report the improvement of catalytic performance of a perovskite SrCo0.8Fe0.1Nb0.1O3-8 (SCFN) by simple surface treatment with dilute nitric acid. It was found that the acid treatment could partially dissolve the A-site cation of Sr, increase the oxygen vacancy concentration and change the oxidation state of the B-site transition metal. Moreover, the modification method also increased the hydroxide adsorption capacity and con-centrations of active oxide species. The OER activity and stability of HNO3 treated sample of SCFN-60 were remarkably improved, and the overpotential was significantly reduced to 360 mV (0.1 M KOH). This work pro-vides a simple strategy for increasing the OER activity of perovskite oxides in an alkaline solution at room temperature.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000868950300003

We probed the chemical stability of NiyP in 1 M KOH at 80 degrees C and examined how exposure up to 168 h affects its structure and catalytic performance. We observed selective P-leaching and formation of NiyP/NiOx core-shell heterostructures, where shell thickness increases with ageing time, which is detrimental for the activity. By tuning the particle size, we demonstrate that prevention of complete catalyst oxidation is essential to preserve the outstanding electrochemical performance of NiyP in alkaline media.									14	1	0	0	0	0	15			2574-0962			WOS:000526598300031

In this study, we synthesize a hybrid electrocatalyst constructed by cobalt phosphide nanosheets in-situ grown on few-layered nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets (CoP@NG) via a facile hydrothermal reaction and subsequent phosphorization process. Due to its unique nanoarchitecture, as a bifunctional electrocatalyst, the CoP@NG electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. In acidic (or alkaline) electrolyte, it delivers very low onset potential of -87 (or -114) mV (vs RHE) and very low Tafel slope of 63.8 (or 59.6) mV dec(-1); it also exhibits excellent performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a very low onset potential of 1.48 V (vs RHE), a small Tafel slope of 63.8 mV dec(-1) and overpotential of 354 mV (vs RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2); moreover, it shows long-term stability for HER (in both acidic and alkaline medium) and OER. The highly conductive, flexible few-layered N-doped graphene nanosheets can not only facilitate the electron transfer and mechanical and chemical stability, but also prevent the aggregation of CoP nanosheets and cause many more reactive sites. This work provides new insights into the structural design and synthesis of low-cost transition-metal phosphides as non-precious electrocatalysts towards water splitting. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, in situ uniform Ni-doped tungsten carbide (Ni/WCX) nanoparticles (similar to 3 nm) on carbon nanofibers (Ni/WCX-CNFs) that were to function as efficient OER catalysts were developed. Both the composition and electronic state of tungsten carbide (WCX: W-WC-W2C) could be regulated through varied Ni coupling. Owing to the synergistic effect between Ni and WCX, the reaction kinetics were facilitated, resulting in improved OER activity with low overpotentials of eta(10) = 350 mV (modified glassy carbon electrode) and eta(10) = 335 mV (self-supporting electrode).

While lithium and sodium have been extensively used to study the oxygen reduction reaction in aprotic solvents, calcium did not receive attention for use in a metal-O-2 battery. This paper aims at examining the oxygen reduction and evolution reaction in Ca2+-containing dimethyl sulfoxide at different electrode materials via the use of differential electrochemical mass spectrometry and rotating ring disc electrodes. The measurements reveal that superoxide is the main product of the oxygen reduction at various electrode materials. However, at gold electrodes the transfer of two electrons per oxygen molecule is observed. The superoxide is soluble and can be reoxidized almost completely from the solution to evolve oxygen, leading to roughly 90% true Coulombic efficiency. Furthermore, the oxygen evolution from species deposited during the oxygen reduction has been observed resulting in an overall reversibility of 95%. Our results combined with recent advances in the deposition of calcium emphasize the relevance of calcium for use in a future Ca-O-2 battery.									37	1	0	0	1	0	38			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000384959100008

Measuring the pH dependence of the OER activity can provide insights on the reaction path that are otherwise difficult to access experimentally, in particular on the coupling of protons and electrons during the reaction. We argue that the use of a pH-dependent reference electrode, such as the reversible hydrogen electrode, is more suitable for these studies as it assures that the overpotential is fixed while varying the pH. We provide criteria for pH dependence when this reference is used and validate the existing results with our measurements on RuO2 powders. A statistical analysis of the existing results allows us to sketch trends in the reaction order on pH with respect to the number of d electrons, oxidation states, and crystal families, providing the groundwork for future OER mechanistic studies on oxides.

Herein, we fabricated an iridium manganese catalyst with only 5 % iridium. The influence of the manganese dioxide phase states (alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-MnO2) on the OER performance of IrO2/MnO2 catalysts was investigated. alpha-MnO2, as the substrate, can generate smaller iridium particles and more high-valence-state iridium to promote OER performance. Therefore, the 5 % IrO2/alpha-MnO2 electrocatalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic OER performance with a high mass activity of 216.67 A/g(Ir) and 655.33 A/g(Ir) at 1.53 V in acidic and alkaline media, respectively, significantly outperforming commercial IrO2.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2196-0216			WOS:000612775300014

Although efficient catalysis for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has been achieved with doped graphene, its performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is rather poor. In this study we report that nitrogen and sulfur co-doping leads to high catalytic activity of nanoporous graphene in HER at low operating potential, comparable to the best Pt-free HER catalyst, 2D MoS2. The interplay between the chemical dopants and geometric lattice defects of the nanoporous graphene plays the fundamental role in the superior HER catalysis.									652	32	0	0	31	0	658			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000349391000019	25470132

For the ORR, the 0.25ML-Co/Pt(111) substrate showed the greatest activity enhancement: 1.7 times of that of clean Pt(111). The ORR activity enhancements were sensitive for the submonolayer-thick Co: the 0.25ML-Co/Pt(111) showed highest activity (1.7-fold vs. clean Pt(111)) and the activity steeply decreased above the Co thickness of 0.5 ML. For the OER, the activity increased with an increasing Co thickness and the 2ML-Co/Pt(111) substrate was the most active. This study suggests that the tuning of the near-surface nanostructures (e.g., Pt-Co composition ratio and chemical state of the Co-(hydro)oxide) is important for achieving high ORR and OER activity in Pt-3d-transition-metal alloy electrocatalysts under alkaline conditions.					18th Symposium on Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells and Electrolyzers (PEFC and E) held during the AiMES Meeting / ECS and SMEQ Joint International Meeting18th Symposium on Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells and Electrolyzers (PEFC and E) held during the AiMES Meeting / ECS and SMEQ Joint International Meeting	SEP 30-OCT 04, 2018SEP 30-OCT 04, 2018	Electrochem Soc, Phys & Analyt Electrochemistry Div; SMEQ; AiMES; Army Res Off; Off Naval Res; Electrochem Soc, Ind Electrochemistry & Electrochem Engn Div; Electrochem Soc, Energy Technol Div; Electrochem Soc, Battery DivElectrochem Soc, Phys & Analyt Electrochemistry Div; SMEQ; AiMES; Army Res Off; Off Naval Res; Electrochem Soc, Ind Electrochemistry & Electrochem Engn Div; Electrochem Soc, Energy Technol Div; Electrochem Soc, Battery Div	Cancun, MEXICOCancun, MEXICO	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1938-5862	1938-6737	978-1-60768-860-0	WOS:000542035400056

O-surf participation occurs via the nonelectrochemical pathway in which adsorbed atomic oxygen (O*) diffuses from the transition-metal site to the oxygen site, and then O-surf shifts out of the surface plane to react with O* to form O-surf-O* and a surface oxygen vacancy. The different thermodynamic driving forces of O-surf participation on LaMO3-delta (M = Ni, Co, and Cu) are explained by the changes in the oxidation state of the transition-metal site throughout the reaction. We show that O-surf participation on LaNiO3 cannot be hindered by O-surf protonation in the OER potential range. By including the coverage effect and utilizing the implicit solvent model, we finally show that lattice oxygen mechanism is more feasible than the conventional mechanism for OER on LaNiO3.									46	2	0	0	2	0	46			1948-7185			WOS:000429626900001	29510623

One of the solutions to enhance the utilization of this precious metal is to use a support to distribute well dispersed Ir nanoparticles. In addition, adequately chosen support can also impact the activity and stability of the catalyst. However, not many materials can sustain the oxidative and acidic conditions of OER in PEMWE. Hereby, we critically and extensively review the different materials proposed as possible supports for OER in acidic media and the effect they have on iridium performances.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000853827100001

Compared with porphyrin-based frameworks, metal-corrole-based frameworks have been rarely developed, although monomeric metal corroles are usually more efficient than porphyrin counterparts for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We herein report on metal-corrole-based porous organic polymers (POPs) as ORR and OER electrocatalysts. M-POPs (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Cu) were synthesized by coupling metal 10-phenyl-5,15-(4-iodophenyl)corrole with tetrakis(4-ethynylphenyl)methane. Compared with metal corrole monomers, M-POPs displayed significantly enhanced catalytic activity and stability. Co-POP outperformed other M-POPs by achieving four-electron ORR with a half-wave potential of 0.87 V vs. RHE and reaching 10 mA cm(-2) OER current density at 340 mV overpotential. This work is unparalleled to develop and explore metal-corrole-based POPs as electrocatalysts.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000783562800001	35355376

The coating comprises at least a catalytic porous outer layer (13) containing regions of porous nickel oxide dispersed within a solid nickel oxide binder. The catalyst is obtained by thermal treatment of a precursor solution comprising preformed nickel vanadium oxide particles dispersed in the precursor solution containing a nickel salt and subsequent leaching of vanadium oxides from the thermally treated layer. The metal substrate is nickel-based, titanium-based or iron-based substrates. USE - The electrode is useful: for gas evolution in electrolytic processes; and as an anode in an electrochemical cell, e.g. as oxygen-evolving anode for alkaline water electrolysis. ADVANTAGE - The coating exhibits a high porosity while simultaneously maintaining a high mechanical stability. It allows a bigger quantity of electrolyte to be in contact with the catalyst and its active sites, boosting the electrochemical performances, for instance for the production of gaseous oxygen. By employing a coating which comprises porous nickel oxide regions dispersed within a homogeneous nickel oxide binder, it has been possible to create a stable highly porous coating which is particularly suitable for oxygen evolution reactions.

In this study, we show that past reports of traditional cathode electrocatalysis in nonaqueous Li-O-2 batteries were indeed true, but that gas evolution related to electrolyte solvent decomposition was the dominant process being catalyzed. In dimethoxyethane, where Li2O2 formation is the dominant product of the electrochemistry, no catalytic activity (compared to pure carbon) is observed using the same (Au, Pt, MnO2) nanoparticles. Nevertheless, the onset potential of oxygen evolution is only slightly higher than the open circuit potential of the cell, indicating conventional oxygen evolution electrocatalysis may be unnecessary.									542	29	0	0	33	0	558			0002-7863			WOS:000297381200010	21995529

In contrast to the prevailing carbon allotropes, GDY possesses Dirac cone structures, which endow it with unique chemical and physical properties, including an adjustable inherent bandgap, high-speed charge carrier transfer efficiency, and excellent conductivity. Additionally, GDY also displays great potential in photocatalysis, rechargeable batteries, solar cells, detectors, and especially electrocatalysis. In this work, various GDY-supported electrocatalysts are described and the reasons why GDY can act as a novel support are analyzed from the perspective of molecular structure, electronic properties, mechanical properties, and stability. The various electrochemical applications of GDY-supported electrocatalysts in energy conversion such as hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, overall water splitting, and nitrogen reduction reaction are reviewed. The challenges facing GDY and GDY-based materials in future research are also outlined. This review aims at providing an in-depth understanding of GDY and promoting the development and application of this novel carbon material.									75	4	0	0	10	0	75			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000530329400007

Herein, we resolve such challenges by constructing the cubic NiCo-PBA bricks assembled 2D nanowalls on Ni foam (NF) through a Ni(OH)(2) nanosheet confined template technique. A great amount of sites are generated along the borders of brick subunits, and the 2D feature supplies downscaled charge diffusion path and high accessible surface area. Therefore, NiCo-PBA/NF exhibits impressive water electrolysis activities, with low overpotentials of 200 and 62 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, respectively. Moreover, the NiCo-PBA/NF coupled two-electrode system achieves a low cell potential of 1.49 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting, which is even better than the noble metal based IrO2-Pt/C system. This contribution sheds light on boosting the catalytic activity of PBAs and metal-organic frameworks toward water splitting, sensors, and other energy-related applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Compared with Co3O4 and NiO nanoframes, NiCo2O4 nanoframes as electrocatalysts demonstrate much higher catalytic activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The superior electrocatalytic performance of NiCo2O4 nanoframes might be attributed to the large surface area and synergistic effect of Ni and Co.									36	3	0	0	3	0	38				2052-1537		WOS:000434243700011

Therefore, this study fabricates Co3O4-RuO2 hollow spheres using a facile and eco-friendly solvothermal and low temperature oxidation procedure followed by ice water treatment (IW-Co3O4-RuO2-HS). The specific hollow nanostructure could provide sufficient active sites and channels in the electrocatalytic procedure. Then, the IW-Co3O4-RuO2-HS presents small overpotentials toward HER (40 mV@ 10 mA cm(-2)) and OER (250 mV@ 10 mA cm(-2)), and high half-wave potential for ORR (E-1/2@ 0.79 V). Remarkably, the IW-Co3O4-RuO2-HS also presents superior catalytic performances toward water-splitting and flexible rechargeable Zn-air batteries. Furthermore, the water electrolysis can be driven by sustainable energy, including solar, wind, thermal energy, and the assembled flexible rechargeable Zn-air battery.

Attributing to the regulation of reaction solution's pH value and the existence of template, the phenomenon of phase transformation occurs, and high-order mesoporous structure is formed. Because of the variation of phase and morphology, only 448 mV can deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope (61 mV dec(-1)) for mesoporous cobalt tungsten oxide hydroxide, while the cobalt tungstate nanoparticles cannot satisfy the basic demand of electrocatalysts. Herein, rational phase transformation and morphology design can significantly affect the property of oxygen evolution, which can provide vast opportunities to turn into candidates for the novel oxygen evolution catalyst.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000520188700001	31887727

Here, it is reported that a laser-synthesized catalyst, porous Co0.75Ni0.25(OH)(2) nanosheets, is highly active for catalyzing overall water splitting. The porous nanosheets exhibit low overpotentials for hydrogen evolution reaction (95 mV@10 mA cm(-2)) and oxygen evolution reaction (235 mV@10 mA cm(-2)). As both anode and cathode catalysts, the porous nanosheets achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an external voltage of 1.56 V, which is much lower than that of commercial Ir/C-Pt/C couple (1.62 V). Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that numerous Co3+ ions are generated on the pore wall of nanosheets, and the unique atomic structure around Co3+ ions leads to appropriate electronic structure and adsorption energy of intermediates, thus accelerating hydrogen and oxygen evolution.									53	7	0	0	2	0	55			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000459488300019	30714319

Activated lattice oxygen can participate in the OER as a reactant and enables O*-O* coupling for direct O-2 formation. However, such reaction kinetics inevitably include the generation of oxygen vacancies, which leads to structural degradation, and eventually shortens the lifetime of catalysts. Here, we demonstrate that Se incorporation significantly enhances OER performance and the stability of NiFe (oxy)hydroxide (NiFe) which follows the LOM pathway. In Se introduced NiFe (NiFeSe), Se forms not only metal-Se bonding but also Se-oxygen bonding by replacing oxygen sites and metal sites, respectively. As a result, transition metals show reduced valence states while oxygen shows less reduced valence states (O -/O-2(2-)) which is a clear evidence of lattice oxygen activation. By virtue of its electronic structure modulation, NiFeSe shows enhanced OER activity and long-term stability with robust active lattice oxygen compared to NiFe.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1225-0562	2287-7258		WOS:000860721500002

Doping nonmetal atoms next to the active single-metal atom can be an effective way to further improve the overall catalytic activities, Herein, we report a nonmetal B-doping strategy for enhancing the catalytic activity of the graphene-based single-metal-atom Mn-pyridine-N-4-graphene catalysts [named MnN4Bn-G (n = 0-8)] toward ORR and OER The underlying chemical mechanism for this design is that the B dopant can lower the charge density corresponding to the d-orbital of the Mn atom, thereby weakening the adsorption strength of oxygen intermediates (O/OH/OOH) on the active Mn site, leading to higher ORR electrocatalytic activity. Not only can this doping strategy enhance ORR activity, but it can also retain high OER activity. Our results show that the MnN4B5-G catalyst entails both relatively high onset potential for ORR (u(onset) = 0.78 V) and relatively low overpotential for OER (eta(over) = 0.43 V), rendering it being a compelling oxygen redox bifunctional electrocatalyst. The newly designed single-metal-atom Mn-pyridine-N-4-graphene catalysts offer alternative NPG metals and bifunctional catalysts for renewable energy applications.									28	0	0	0	1	0	28			2168-0485			WOS:000498289300055

The nanocomposite films were characterized by electrochemistry, transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. They showed an efficient electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction. Data from Tafel plots have demonstrated that the catalytic activity of the iridium oxide nanoparticles is maintained following their inclusion in the polymer matrix. Bulk electrolysis of water at carbon foam modified electrodes have shown that the iridium oxide-polymer composite presents a higher catalytic activity and a better operational stability than regular oxide films.									36	3	0	0	3	0	37			1944-8244			WOS:000340446300124	25045786

The activity-durability coincidence of OER electrocatalysts was theoretically understood by preferential depolarization in galvanostatic situations. At constant-current conditions for a system involving multiple reactions that are independent and competitive, the overpotential is determined most dominantly by the most facile reaction so that the most facile reaction is responsible for a dominant portion of the overall current. Therefore, higher OER activity improves durability by mitigating the current responsible for COR. The activity-durability coincidence was then proved experimentally by comparing between two catalysts of the same chemical identity (MnCo2O4) in different dimensions (5 and 100 nm in size). Carbon corrosion responsible for inferior durability was suppressed in the smaller-dimension catalyst (MnCo2O4 in 5 nm) having more numbers of active sites per a fixed mass.									34	1	0	0	0	0	34			2168-0485			WOS:000441475500007

Thus, the development of efficient, abundant, and economical catalysts, as well as electrode design, is very demanding today. In this review, we have discussed the principles of electrocatalytic water oxidation reaction (WOR), the electrocatalyst and electrode design strategies for the most efficient results, and recent advancement in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst design. Finally, we have discussed the use of OER in the Oxygen Maker (OM) design with the example of OM REDOX by Solaire Initiative Private Ltd. The review clearly summarizes the future directions and applications for sustainable energy utilization with the help of water splitting and the way forward to develop better cell designs with electrodes and catalysts for practical applications. We hope this review will offer a basic understanding of the OER process and WOR in general along with the standard parameters to evaluate the performance and encourage more WOR-based profound innovations to make their way from the lab to the market following the example of OM REDOX.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2296-2646			WOS:000801742200001	35646820

Part III - Iron.								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE				3	12			1463	1503						DEC 2008	2008	The kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at passive oxide covered polycrystalline Fe electrodes in aqueous alkaline solution were examined using both dc steady state polarisation and ac impedance techniques. It proved difficult to obtain reproducible polarisation data for bright anodes, and so an electrochemical pre-treatment routine was devised. Upon ageing of a given electrode specimen, and with application of the pre-treatment regime before each experiment, it was possible to determine reproducible values of the Tafel slope and the reaction order with respect to OH-ion activity. The link between OER polarisation behaviour and the changing nature of the passive oxide film, with repeated electrode pre-treatment and experimental utilisation, was characterised by cyclic voltammetry. As was previously found for oxidised Co electrodes, it is necessary to admit a dual energy barrier model in order to rationalise some of the experimental Tafel slope values. By considering the kinetic data presented here, in tandem with complimentary results obtained for extensively aged and also for multicycled iron electrodes, a preferred reaction pathway emerges. The electrode active surface area for the OER has been been estimated using the same current transient decay technique that we have applied to Ni and Co anodes. On this basis, the "real" surface area normalised activity series for the OER amongst the passive oxides of these first row transition metals is outlined.									64	0	0	0	5	0	64			1452-3981			WOS:000265311800007

The catalytic performance in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was investigated. XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS were used to characterize the microstructure, physical and chemical properties of the catalyst. The results show that the used method can etch Zn atoms, create oxygen vacancies and dope sulfur. The oxygen vacancies and doped sulfur play a positive role in enhancing the OER performance. In addition, amorphous CoSOH also exhibited better OER activity. The synergy between CoSOH and Co(OH)_2 finally induces the best catalytic properties (overpotential eta=310 mV, Tafel slope b= 90 mV/dec) and long-term electrochemical stability, that is CoSOH/Co(OH)_2 possess superior electrocatalytic oxygen evolution performance.			以硝酸钴与硝酸锌为原料,加入尿素和氟化钠在反应釜120 ℃下均匀生长在碳纸上得到Zn-Co(OH)_2复合前驱体,通过在室温下用5 mol/L NaOH和1 mol/L Na_2S溶液将前驱体刻蚀并部分硫化合成了CoSOH/Co(OH)_2复合材料,考察其在电解水析氧反应(OER)中的催化性能。利用XRD、SEM、TEM、XPS对催化剂的微观结构及物理化学性质进行了表征。结果表明,该方法可以刻蚀Zn原子,留下氧空位并引入掺杂S元素,氧空位和S掺杂对OER反应起到积极促进作用。同时,非晶的CoSOH也有较好的OER活性。CoSOH与Co(OH)_2的协同作用使得材料表现出最优催化效果(过电位eta = 310 mV,塔菲尔斜率b = 90 mV/dec)及长时间的电化学稳定性,具有较高的电催化产氧性能。						0	1	0	0	0	0	1			0253-2409			CSCD:7086486

Herein, we shed light on the behavior of Li2O2 oxidation by exploiting various in situ imaging, gas analysis, and electrochemical methods. At the low potentials 3.2-3.7 V (vs Li/Li+), OER is exclusive to the thinner parts of the Li2O2 deposits, which leads to O-2 gas evolution, followed by the concomitant release of superoxide species. At higher potentials, OER initiates at the sidewalls of the thicker Li2O2. The succeeding lateral decomposition of Li2O2 indicates the preferential Li+ and charge transport occurring at the sidewalls of Li2O2. To ameliorate the OER rate, we also investigate an alternative approach of rerouting charge carriers by using soluble redox mediators. Our in situ probes provide insights into the favorable charge-transport routes that can aid in promoting Li2O2 decomposition.									46	3	0	0	1	0	48			0002-7863			WOS:000433404000002	29739188

Perovskite oxides are emerging as a novel research frontier to simultaneously catalyze oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, however, their activity and durability are still far from desirable. Herein, we propose a rational design of Ni3S2 decorated double perovskite PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+delta as an integrated electrocatalyst. A Ni3S2 layer with 10 nm thickness is uniformly anchored on electrospun PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+delta nanofibers via the atomic layer deposition technology and the following sulfudation process. Notably, the lithium-oxygen batteries employing the as-prepared catalyst shows the excellent performance with a narrow overpotential (0.68 V at 1000 mAh g(-1)), a high capacity (12874 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1)) as well as the improved cycle stability (over 120 cycles) and rate capacity. The outstanding performance arises from the synergistic coupling of Ni3S2 and PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+delta as well as the hierarchical porous structure with sufficient catalytic active sites. This work provides an innovative method to combine the metal chalcogenides and perovskite oxides, and the results suggest that the integrated Ni3S2/PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+delta has a great potential as bifunctional electrocatalyst for the reversible lithium-oxygen batteries.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000486355400020

Despite tremendous efforts, there is still need for further development of bifunctional catalysts to achieve low-cost catalysts with stable satisfactory long-term performance, enhanced kinetics of the ORR and OER and high round-trip electrolytic-galvanic mode voltage efficiency. Herein, we demonstrate a simple one-pot procedure for synthesis of a bifunctional catalyst comprised of a composite of cobalt/cobalt oxide and N-doped graphene (denoted as Co/Co3O4-N-graphene), which exhibits very good performance in the electrocatalysis of both ORR and OER in alkaline solution. The prepared composite was characterized by TEM, SEM, Raman, XRD and XPS, to give insight of its structureperformance correlation. The results reveal that the structure of N-doped graphene is preserved and that both metallic Co and its oxide form of Co3O4 co-existed in the prepared composite, with metallic Co being predominant crystalline component. Generally, a high ratio of Co in the prepared composite led to improvement of the onset potential for the OER.									41	4	0	0	2	0	42			1040-0397	1521-4109		WOS:000387886500023

Currently, noble Pt metal and noble-metal oxides (IrO2 and RuO2) are recognized as state-of-the-art electrocatalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. Searching for earth-abundant electrocatalysts for the HER and OER with remarkable performance and high stability to replace precious metals plays a significant role in the commercial application of electrochemical water splitting. In this review, recent advancements in nanostructured transition metal electrocatalysts are assessed through the selected examples of nitrides, carbides, phosphides, sulfides, borides, layered double hydroxides, and oxides. Recent breakthroughs in nanostructured transition metal electrocatalysts are discussed in terms of their mechanisms, controllable production, structural design, and innovative strategies for boosting their performance. For instance, most nanostructured transition metal electrocatalysts for overall water splitting (OWS) only function well in neutral and alkaline solutions. Finally, current research challenges and future perspectives for increasing the performance of nanostructured transition metals for OWS are proposed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2520-8489	2520-8136		WOS:000869846700001

Pourbaix diagrams reveal stable surface structures, as a function of pH and the potential. The present OFT study indicates that the Pourbaix diagram in the CER potential region above 1.36V and pH values around zero is dominated by a stable surface structure in which all coordinatively undercoordinated Ru sites (Ru-cus) are capped by on-top oxygen (O-ot). This oxygen saturated RuO2(110) surface is considered to serve as the catalytically active phase in the CER, quite in contrast to the heterogeneously catalyzed HCl oxidation (Deacon process), for which the active RuO2(110) surface is mainly covered by on-top chlorine. The active sites in the CER are suggested to be RucusOot surface complexes, while in the Deacon process both undercoordinated surface Ru and oxygen sites must be available for the activation of HCl molecules.

A promising, yet challenging, application involves the use of colloidal NCs as light absorbers and electrocatalysts for water splitting. In this review we discuss how the tunability of these materials is ideal to understand the complex phenomena behind storing energy in chemical bonds and to optimize performance through structural and compositional modification. First, we describe the colloidal synthesis method as a means to achieve a high degree of control over single material NCs and NC heterostructures, including examples of the role of the ligands in modulating size and shape. Next, we focus on the use of NCs as light absorbers and catalysts to drive both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), together with some of the challenges related to the use of colloidal NCs as model systems and/or technological solution in water splitting. We conclude with a broader prospective on the use of colloidal chemistry for new material discovery.									18	0	0	0	3	0	18			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000394097700001

Up till now, Pt-based catalysts still exhibit the best hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance and Ir/Ru-based oxides are identified as the benchmark for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the high cost and rarity of these materials extremely hinder their large-scale applications. This paper describes the construction of the ultrathin defect-enriched 3D Se-(NiCo)S-x/(OH)(x) nanosheets for overall water splitting through a facile Se-induced hydrothermal treatment. Via Se-induced fabrication, highly efficient Se-(NiCo)S-x/(OH)(x) nanosheets are successfully fabricated through morphology optimization, defect engineering, and electronic structure tailoring. The as-prepared hybrids exhibit relatively low overpotentials of 155 and 103 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER, respectively. Moreover, an overall water-splitting device delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for approximate to 66 h without obvious degradation.									248	17	0	0	9	0	248			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000428348000008	29363189

The key challenge in electrochemical water splitting process is to develop low-cost electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on the cathode and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the anode. OER is the most important half-reaction involved in water splitting, which has been extensively studied since the last century and a large amount of electrocatalysts including noble and non-noble metal-based materials have been developed. Among them, transition metal borides and borates (TMBs)-based compounds with various structures have attracted increasing attention owing to their excellent OER performance. In recent years, many efforts have been devoted to exploring the OER mechanism of TMBs and to improving the OER activity and stability of TMBs. In this review, recent research progress made in TMBs as efficient electrocatalysts for OER is summarized. The chemical properties, synthetic methodologies, catalytic performance evaluation, and improvement strategy of TMBs as OER electrocatalysts are discussed. The electrochemistry fundamentals of OER are first introduced in brief, followed by a summary of the preparation and performance of TMBs-based OER electrocatalysts. Finally, current challenges and future directions for TMBs-based OER electrocatalysts are discussed.									19	3	0	0	0	0	19			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000546588000001	32320104

This study reports the electrodeposition and characterization of a transition-metal (Mo, Fe)-codoped nickel phosphide (Ni3P:FeMo) bifunctional catalyst for enhanced overall water splitting in an alkaline medium. The Ni3P:FeMo catalyst exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic performance for both the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction with low overpotentials of -103 and 290 mV, respectively, at a high current density of 100 mA/cm(2) along with fast electrocatalytic kinetics. A full water-splitting electrolyzer consisting of a bifunctional Ni3P:FeMo catalyst required a low cell voltage of 1.48 V to attain a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) with excellent stability for more than 50 h. Density functional theory calculations provided insights into the microscopic mechanism of the effective modulation of the p- and d-band centers of the P and Ni active sites by the Mo and Fe codoping of Ni3P, thereby enhancing the bifunctional catalytic activity of Ni3P.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2574-0962			WOS:000756324400082

Herein, we systemically investigate the electrocatalytic properties of transition metal atom-doped graphene-like GaN(g-GaN) monolayers by means of density functional theory. Our results reveal that Fe/g-GaN, Ni/g-GaN, and Au/g-GaN can be high-activity bifunctional electrocatalysts. Specifically, the Ni/g-GaN over-potential for the OER/ORR is estimated as 0.26/0.38 V, suggesting its extremely high catalytic performance. As an efficient descriptor for the adsorption strength of reactions on substrates, the TM atom d-band centers are found to linearly correlate with Gibbs free energies of HO* and HOO* species. This work provides an effective guidance to design high-activity SACs for the OER and ORR.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2574-0970		WOS:000677582900063

Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are good candidates to prepare SACs owing to the atomically dispersed metal nodes in MOFs and abundant N and C species to stabilize the single atoms. In addition, the distance of adjacent metal atoms can be turned by adjusting the size of ligands and adding volatile metal centers to promote the formation of isolated metal atoms. Moreover, the diverse metal centers in MOFs can promote the preparation of dual-atom catalysts (DACs) to improve the metal loading and optimize the electronic structures of the catalysts. The applications of MOFs derived SACs and DACs for electrocatalysis, including oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction and nitrogen reduction reaction are systematically summarized in this Review. The corresponding synthesis strategies, atomic structures and electrocatalytic performances of the catalysts are discussed to provide a deep understanding of MOFs-based atomic electrocatalysts. The catalytic mechanisms of the catalysts are presented, and the crucial challenges and perspectives are proposed to promote further design and applications of atomic electrocatalysts.									35	2	0	0	1	0	36			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000584794200001	33089643

Its improved ORR and HER activities in 0.1 M KOH were confirmed using a thin-film rotating ring-disk electrode (TF-RRDE) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The exchange current density and Tafel slope obtained from EIS data for HER are 1.6 x 10 (2) mAcm (2). and similar to 43 mV dec (1) respectively, suggesting Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism for HER. In addition to its good durability for both cathodic processes, catalyst shows a 4-electron transfer process for ORR, excellent tolerance towards methanol oxidation, and low H2O2 formation (similar to 3.0%). At half-wave potential of 0.8 V, no significant degradation was observed after 10,000 (0.65 - 1.0V) potential cycles in oxygen saturated medium.

An improved bi-functional electrocatalytic activity over the traditional electrocatalysts is exhibited by the Co3Fe7/nitrogen-doped graphene nanoribbon (NGNR) composite. For instance, this composite Co3Fe7/NGNRs depicted a lower overpotential of 350 mV than NGNRs (380 mV) and IrO2 (450 mV) to sustain 10 mA cm(-2) for an oxygen evolution reaction in 1.0 M KOH. Furthermore, during an oxygen reduction reaction, the catalyst exhibited a four-electron pathway and it is interesting to note that its electrocatalytic behavior is on a par with commercial Pt/C. The enhancement in the electrochemical performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect that stems from the electrocatalytically active nitrogen atoms and metal alloy nanoparticles distributed uniformly over the graphene matrix. This unique composition of electrocatalyst is extremely beneficial for practical applications in fuel cells and metal-air batteries due to its high stability and sustained electrochemical activity.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000440952500001	30004389

However, according to the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), the OER activity is theoretically limited with high overpotential by the scaling relationship in binding energies of the reaction intermediates. We propose an attractive strategy to promote OER activity by direct O-O coupling at the interfacial active sites for Ag (x) nanoparticles decorated on La1-xNiO3 perovskite electrocatalysts (Ag/LNO-x). The overpotential of the Ag/LNO-0.05 was 315 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(geo)(-2), which was much lower than that of other Ag/LNO-x (x = 0, 0.3, and 0.5) and commercial iridium oxide (IrO2, 398 mV) electrocatalysts. The theoretical calculation revealed that the improved OER electrocatalytic activity of Ag/LNO-x originated from a change in the reaction mechanism at the interfacial active sites. At the interface, oxygen evolution via the dual-site mechanism with direct O-O coupling becomes more favorable than that via the conventional AEM. Finally, due to the formation of the interfacial active sites, the synthesized Ag/LNO-0.05 electrocatalyst showed significantly enhanced OER activity, which was 20 times higher mass activity before and 74 times after an accelerated durability test than that of the IrO2 electrocatalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000859221000001

Herein, Fe-Co bimetallic MOFs with different compositions are prepared through a sodium hydroxide assisted approach. By means of a successive carbonization and phosphating reaction, a series of MOF-derived multicomponent products are synthesized. The resultant P-doped products present enhance electrocatalytic performance for OER in alkaline electrolyte in comparison with a commercial RuO2 catalyst, which paves the way for their practical applications for water splitting.

Herein, we report AgFeO2 nanoparticles can act as an efficient electrocatalyst for both OER and HER. A carbon paste electrode was modified with AgFeO2 and the fabricated electrode (AgFeO2-CPE) exhibited extremely low onset overpotentials of 28 and 317 mV for the HER and OER, respectively. AgFeO2-CPE as a durable cathode and anode showed good stability and superior activity in 1.0 M KOH solution and delivered 10 mA cm(-2) at the overpotentials of 37 and 400 mV, respectively.

A thin uniform graphene layer was deposited onto the ITO surface through electrophoretic deposition (EPD), followed by subsequent deposition of a thin layer of Co3O4 nanoparticles onto the graphene surface by chemical bath deposition (CBD) to yield a transparent Co3O4/GR bi-layer.

The results indicate that the predominant cathodic reaction changes from an oxygen reduction reaction to the hydrogen evolution reaction as the dissolved oxygen (DO) content decreases. In the simulated deep sea environment, the SCC susceptibility of X70 steel decreased first, reached its lowest point at 15 MPa and then increased as the simulated sea hydrostatic pressure (HP) further increased. This is consistent with the regularity for the change of the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction current density i(H) at E-corr, which indicates that the HP may influence the SCC susceptibility of X70 steel by changing the permeated hydrogen concentration.									65	7	0	0	2	1	69			0921-5093	1873-4936		WOS:000394190400018

Several review articles have summarized the recent progress on TMDs but no critical and systematic summary exists about the nanoscale fabrication of MoS2 with different dimensional morphologies. In this review article, first we will summarize the recent progress on the morphological tuning and structural evolution of MoS2 from zero-dimension (0D) to 3D. Then the different engineering methods and the effect of synthesis conditions on structure and morphology of MoS2 will be discussed. Moreover, the corresponding change in the electronic and physicochemical properties of MoS2 induced by structure tuning will also be presented. Further, the applications of MoS2 in various electrochemical systems e.g. hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and supercapacitors as well as photocatalytic hydrogen evolution will be highlighted. The review article will also critically focus on challenges faced by researchers to tune the MoS2 nanostructures and the resulting electrochemical mechanism to enhance their performances. At the end, concluding remarks and future prospects for the development of better MoS2 based nanostructured materials for the aforementioned applications will be presented.									67	6	0	0	2	0	70			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000387858400001	27761550

Herein, we propose a carbon dots-oriented strategy for fabricating nitrogen-doped carbon dots/fungus- like CoP microsphere composite on Ni foam (CoP-NCDs/NF). Owing to its unique structure and the strong interactions between carbon dots and CoP, the newly developed CoP-NCDs/NF electrode exhibits significantly enhanced HER and OER bifunctional catalytic activities, with over-potentials as low as 103 and 226 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Accordingly, the CoP-NCDs/NF displays excellent overall water splitting performance with a low cell voltage of 1.55 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and great stability in a two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer. This study provides an alternative pathway on rationally designing and fabricating carbon dots-based materials for high performance water electrolysis and other energy conversion fields.

However, they are not fully understood yet. Here we report a systematic study of the morphological transition of Li2O2 from a single crystalline structure to a toroid like particle during the discharge-charge cycle, with the help of a theoretical model to explain the evolution of the Li2O2 at different stages of this process. The model suggests that the transition starts in the first monolayer of Li2O2, and is subsequently followed by a transition from particle growth to film growth if the applied current exceeds the exchange current for the oxygen reduction reaction in a Li-O-2 cell. Furthermore, a sustainable mass transport of the diffusive active species (e.g., O-2 and Li+) and evolution of the underlying interfaces are critical to dictate desirable oxygen reduction (discharge) and evolution (charge) reactions in the porous carbon electrode of a Li-O-2 cell.									8	1	0	0	1	0	8			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000417196000023

Electrochemical energy conversion presents a promising bridge to mitigate energy shortage issues and minimize the ecological implications by synergy with the ever-increasing sustainable energies (e.g., wind and solar). It thus calls for exploring high-activity, low-cost, and long-durability electrocatalysts to facilitate the electrochemical reactions involved in electrochemical energy conversion systems. This review focuses on summarizing the recent progress in the development of bifunctional electrocatalysts for several important electrochemical redox reactions which are critical to implement conversion between electrical energy and chemical energy, especially for bifunctional electrocatalysts applied in a single electrochemical conversion system, including water electrolyzers with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), zinc-air batteries with the OER and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and fuel cells with small molecule (e.g., glucose, urea, and hydrazine hydrate) oxidation reactions (MOR) and the ORR. Special emphasis has been placed on investigating the progress of electrocatalyst synthesis and strategies for improving the electrocatalytic performance and the associated devices' performance in terms of activity, stability, power density etc. We also put forward the major challenges and prospects in the development of bifunctional electrocatalysts for potential applications in a variety of energy devices.									165	6	0	0	5	0	165			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000464414200002

Recently, Au supports have been shown to enhance the activity of many 3d transition metal-oxide thin films for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. Herein, we translate the beneficial impact of Au supports to high surface area, device-ready core-shell nanoparticles consisting of a Au-core and a metal-oxide shell (Au@MxOy where M = Ni, Co, Fe, and CoFe). Through a systematic evaluation, we establish trends in performance and illustrate the universal activity enhancement when employing the Au-core in the 3d transition metal-oxide nanoparticles. The highest activity particles, Au@CoFeOx, demonstrate an over potential of 328 +/- 3 mV over a 2 h stability test at 10 rnA cm(-2), illustrating that strategically coupling Au support and mixed metal-oxide effects in a core shell nanoparticle morphology is a promising avenue to achieve device-ready, high-performance OER catalysts.									104	3	0	0	2	0	105			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000413057500024	28945433

Herein, we conduct a thorough and meticulous study on the NiSe oxygen evolution nanoelectrocatalyst-a representative metal selenide that was recently reported to be effective for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Our results unambiguously show that NiSe undergoes deselenization under electrocatalytic conditions, finally in situ transforming into a NiSe/NiOx core/shell nanostructure; the latter core/shell nanomaterial gives a superior activity towards OER. The NiSe/NiOx nanomaterial affords a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential as low as similar to 243 mV, outperforming most of the previously reported nickel (hydro) oxide OER electrocatalysts. These results further imply that the electrocatalytic activity of the so-called NiSe catalysts should originate from the in situ formed amorphous NiOx shell in nature, with the NiSe core having some auxiliary effects on the catalytic activity. Additionally, the NiSe/NiOx nanomaterial is also found to show a higher electrocatalytic activity than NiSe itself for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in basic media.									64	3	0	0	2	0	64			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000389224400008

Herein, crystal CoxB catalysts (x = 1-3) of the OER are fabricated by a ball-milling method. Among these CoxB catalysts, Co2B exhibits the best OER activity, with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 287 mV in 1 M KOH solution. Such OER activity of Co2B is favorably comparable to that of the commercial IrO2 and most recently reported OER catalysts. Furthermore, the Co2B catalyst exhibits excellent stability with a stable current density of 50 mA cm(-2) over 12 h of continuous electrolysis operation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry demonstrate that the B in CoxB makes oxidation easier, leading to their enhanced OER activities in comparison to metal Co. In addition, the Co2B electrocatalyst also exhibits high activity in the hydrogen evolution reaction; thus, the catalyst can be used as a bifunctional catalyst for full water splitting.									51	3	0	0	2	0	52			2168-0485			WOS:000414825900082

Transition metal carbides have been investigated as remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts but undesired oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts and need further study. Here, a cobaltinolybdenum-based bimetallic carbide coated by N-doped porous carbon and anchored on N-doped reduced graphene oxide film (Co6Mo6C2/NCRGO) is synthesized by directly carbonizing the Co-doped polyoxometalate/conductive polyiner/grapheoe oxide (Co-PCG) precursors. The precise control of the Co/Mo Molar ratio in. the Co-PCG precursor is of critical importance to synthesize pure phase bimetallic carbide of Co6Mo6C2. As the highly active and robust OER electrocatalyst, the Co6Mo6C2/NCRGO composite exhibits excellent activity in alkaline solution, affording a low overpotential of 260 mV versus RHE at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 50 mV dec(-1), as well as long-term stability. The superior OER performances are strongly associated with the active Co6Mo6C2 particles, polypyrrole (Pky)-derived N-doped porous carbon, and the conductive RGO films. Remarkably, it is the first evidence that the bimetallic carbides were used as the OER catalysts with such high OER activity.									99	6	0	0	2	0	100			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000402498600026	28475302

However, the difficulties encountered in the conversion of intermediates (M-OH, M-O, and M-OOH) lead to low efficiency. Decorations of transition metal catalysts with foreign elements are regarded effective solutions, among which decoration with Ce-based materials (CeBM) is the most prominent. This review investigates the current status and future prospects of CeBM-decorated transition metal electrocatalysts. By presenting a thorough account of the latest development, we aim to set a common ground for the research community for a deeper understanding of the roles of CeBM that originate from its unique electronic structure and abundant oxygen vacancies. Moreover, we wish to provide our own perspectives as to how to further the design of Ce-based OER electrocatalysts and where such catalysts may be applied in fields beyond electrocatalysis.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2096-5745		WOS:000794257100003

Proceedings								453	66		10.1007/978-94-024-1298-7_45				2018	2018	This study is concerned with the preparation and characterization of electrocatalysts containing Magneli phases as a support material, and different metallic systems (Co, Pt, and CoPt, Co:Pt = 1:1 wt.), as catalytic phase. The main idea was to reduce the amount of Pt with the addition of Co as a non-noble metal. The studied electrocatalysts were tested for water electrolysis in aqueous electrolytes, i.e. for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and for oxygen evolution reactions (OER). They were also tested in PEM fuel cells for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The order of activity for HER and OER was the following: CoPt > Pt > Co, and for ORR: CoPt ap Pt > Co. Co has been shown as promoter for reducing Pt particles (the most active monometallic phase), so the reduction of the Pt quantity in the metallic phase was compensated by smaller particles. Also, the interaction between the metallic phases increases the intrinsic catalytic activity for all reactions (HER, OER and ORR).

The crystallographic behavior, electronic effects, and microstructure of the catalysts were investigated by XRD, XPS, SEM, and TEM analysis. The influence of OMNs and the effect of Ir content in Pt-Ru-Ir catalyst on both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were investigated. The synergistic and electronic effects play an important role in electrocatalytic performance through the electronic coupling between Pt, Ru and Ir followed by the alloy formation with different lattice strain percentages. Amongst, the OMNs Pt70Ru25Ir5 catalyst exhibits the highest mass activity of 0.21 mA mu g(-1) and specific activity of 0.33 mA cm(-2) for ORR, which are nearly 5-fold greater than those for benchmark Pt/C catalyst. Furthermore, the Pt70Ru25Ir5 demonstrated enhanced OER activity with an overpotential of 470 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), an onset potential of 1.70 V, and a Tafel slope of 118 mV dec(-1), outperforming commercial IrO2. In addition, the durability of the Pt70Ru25Ir5 catalyst for ORR and OER are found to be extended in comparison with that of other catalysts reported in this work after 6000 cycles. These results demonstrate that the ordered OMNs Pt-Ru-Ir with low Ir content (similar to 5 wt.%) could be a promising oxygen bifunctional catalyst for electrochemical energy conversion and storage applications.

A versatile screening protocol would simplify the identification of novel and better catalysts by using high throughput experimentation. Herein, such a screening approach for the identification of molecular catalysts for chemical oxidation of water is reported, which is based on oxygen-sensitive fluorescence quenching using an OxoDish. More than 200 reactions were performed revealing several catalysts, for example, a dinuclear Fe complex that produced oxygen under the used reaction conditions. Clark electrode measurements confirmed a similar rate in oxygen evolution, making the developed parallel screening approach a robust and versatile tool to screen for molecular water oxidation catalysts using chemical oxidants under acidic and neutral conditions.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000362729300008	26338012

Accordingly, to effectively suppress the free metal ions on the surface of MOFs and increase Fe-N4 active sites, Vitamin C (L (+)-ascorbic acid), with an ability to coordinate transition metals, is complexed with ferrous ions. Meanwhile, the acidity of Vitamin C can moderately erode the surface of MOFs materials, further accelerating the generation of holes and defects in the carbonized products. Compared with the control samples without introduction of Vitamin C, the iron-based (VC-MOF-Fe) catalyst, with obviously increased Fe-N4 active sites, exhibit significantly enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. When used in rechargeable zinc-air batteries, the peak power density of VC-MOF-Fe (113 mW cm-2) is also better than that of 20% commercial Pt/C + RuO2. Interestingly, the function of Vitamin C also applies to the cobalt-based catalyst (VC-MOF-Co), evidencing the universality of this strategy.									29	1	0	0	1	0	29			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000634241700001

Herein, we fulfill the significant electrochemical water splitting enhancement in both electrocatalytic activity and durability by constructing self-supported nickel-cobalt nanowire catalysts with abundant oxygen vacancies. Specifically, the rich oxygen vacancies can largely promote the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of optimal Ni1Co1O2 NWs with a relatively low overpotential of 248 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). More significantly, after the phosphorization of Ni1Co1O2 NWs, the resultant Ni1Co1P NWs can also display excellent electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performances with an overpotential of only 101 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, benefiting from the unique 1D nanowire structure, the synergistic effect, and the optimal Gibbs free energy for hydrogen evolution evolved from the phosphorization, the Ni1Co1O2 NWs//Ni1Co1P NWs couple is thus highly active and stable for overall water electrolysis with a low voltage of 1.58 V at 10 mA cm(-2), showing extraordinary promise for practical overall water splitting electrolysis.									38	2	0	0	1	0	38			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000448421100039	30276398

The Pd-Mn3O4 supported on 3D HPG demonstrates as an excellent catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium. The Pd-Mn3O4(wt 2:1)/HPG catalyst shows a low onset potential of 0.497 V and achieves a high current density of 5.3 mA cm(-2) at 0.7 V (vs. SCE). The outstanding electrocatalytic activity is attributed to a synergistic effect between Pd and Mn3O4, and the 3D HPG enhances conductivity for charge transport and gives more active sites for the OER reaction.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000445155700018

Owing to the low H adsorption free energy, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is regarded as a promising candidate for HER, but it shows low activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, graphene-supported cobalt-doped ultrathin molybdenum disulfide (Co-MoS2/rGO) was synthesized via a one-pot hydrothermal method. The obtained hybrids modified electrode exhibits a high HER catalytic activity with a low overpotential of 147 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 49.5 mV dec(-1), as well as good electrochemical stability in acidic electrolyte. Meanwhile, the catalyst shows remarkable OER activity with a low overpotential of 347 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The superior activity is ascribed not only to the high conductivity originated from the reduced graphene, but also to the synergistic effect between MoS2 and cobalt.

Herein, a series of graphene/NiFe (oxy) hydroxides were fabricated to investigate the role of the Fe/Ni ratio in regard to the resultant physical structures, decoration styles, and combined catalytic activities. With the Fe content increasing, a phase evolution from Fe doped Ni(OH)(2)/NiO(OH) to Ni doped FeO(OH) was demonstrated. The moderate guest-metal substitution into the host-oxyhydroxide framework (Fe into Ni or Ni into Fe) substantially enhanced the oxygen evolution activity with a decrease in both the Tafel slope and overpotential. In addition, the NiO(OH) and FeO(OH) frameworks exhibited distinct properties and performances for the oxygen evolution reaction due to the different metal-oxygen bond lengths and adsorption energies of the intermediates.									53	13	0	0	1	0	53			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000371077600004

Then, Fe3C/carbon nitride (Fe3C@CNx) core-shell structure composites are readily available through pyrolyzing Fe-TCNQ at reasonable temperature, during which hierarchical porous structures with multimodal porosity formed. Nitrogen doped porosity carbon layers can facilitate mass access to active sites and accelerate reaction. Consequently, the optimized catalyst exhibits superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalytic activity and better catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium than that of Pt/C, which can be attributed to the synergistic effect of strong coupling between Fe3C and nitrogen doped carbon shells, active sites Fe-N-X, optimal level of nitrogen doping, and appropriate multimodal porosity.

Herein, we report a Co-doped nanorod-like RuO2 electrocatalyst with an abundance of oxygen vacancies achieved through the facile, one-step annealing of a Ru-exchanged ZIF-67 derivative.

Herein, we report a noble metal-free advanced catalyst, i.e. the chemically reduced mixed transition metal oxide CuO-Co3O4 composite, with outstanding oxygen evolution reaction activity in alkaline media. Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) was used as a reducing agent for the mixed transition metal oxide CuO-Co3O4. The chemically reduced composite carried mixed valence states of Cu and Co, which played a dynamic role in driving an excellent oxygen evolution reaction process. The X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS) study confirmed high density of active sites in the treated sample with a large number of oxygen vacancies. The developed electrocatalyst showed the lowest overpotential of 144.5 mV vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) to achieve the current density of 40 mA cm(-2) and remained stable for 40 hours throughout the chronoamperometry test at the constant potential of 1.39 V vs. RHE. Moreover, the chemically reduced composite was highly durable. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) confirmed the low charge transfer resistance of 13.53 ohms for the chemically reduced composite, which was 50 and 26 times smaller than that of Co3O4 and untreated CuO-Co3O4, respectively. The electrochemically active surface area for the chemically reduced composite was found to be greater than that for pristine CuO, Co3O4 and untreated pristine CuO-Co3O4. These findings reveal the possibility of a new gateway for the capitalization of a chemically reduced sample into diverse energy storage and conversion systems such as lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000496465000004

For this study a laboratory constructed model cell was employed. Firstly, controlled potential electrolysis of 0.1 mol/L NaCl was performed and chlorine was observed to evolve at potential + 1. 2 V. The pH values of the solution decreased during electrolysis over the potential range of + 1.0 V- + 2.0 V, suggesting that oxygen evolution may involve in the reactions. Electrolysis with a de-oxygenated NaCl solution at a fixed potential of + 2.0 V confirmed that O-2 is one of the products generated at the anode. Further electrolysis of NaCl solution was conducted under steady state conditions. A potential-current density plot was constructed over the potential range of + 1. 00 V- + 1. 28 V. The slope of the plot at Tafel section was found to be 41 mV/decade. These results indicate that chlorine evolution at the anode is achieved via an intermediate layer formed by electrosorption of oxygen and chlorine on the electrode surface.					12th Joint Conference of the Chinese-Society-of-Chemical-Sciences-and-Technologies/Chinese United Kingdom Section of the Society-of-Chemical-Industry12th Joint Conference of the Chinese-Society-of-Chemical-Sciences-and-Technologies/Chinese United Kingdom Section of the Society-of-Chemical-Industry	SEP 24, 2005SEP 24, 2005	Chinese Soc Chem Sci & Technol; Soc Chem Ind, Chinese UK SectChinese Soc Chem Sci & Technol; Soc Chem Ind, Chinese UK Sect	Univ Nottingham, Nottingham, ENGLANDUniv Nottingham, Nottingham, ENGLAND	2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1002-0071	1745-5391		WOS:000238034800012

Lately, modification of transition metal-based electrocatalysts with foreign elements is growing rapidly, and rare earth (RE) elements are of particular interest among various elements because of their special structural features. Here, in this review, we perform a comprehensive survey on the recent progress in RE element -incorporated electrocatalysts for various electrochemical reactions, including hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, oxygen reduction, and methanol oxidation reactions. As benefited from the RE incorporation, the structural and catalytic property changes of host electrocatalysts are summarized for different reactions, in which it is evident that there are many positive promotions induced from RE elements for the enhanced electrocatalysis. Several important insights are also discussed to further our knowledge of integrating RE elements to improve associated electrocatalytic properties of the catalysts investigated. The final section describes the challenges for the design, structural optimization, mechanistic investigation, and technological applications for the RE element-incorporated electrocatalysts and concludes with an outlook on the future development of these catalysts for energy conversion and storage.

Herein, the fabrication of copper phosphide (Cu3P) microsheets through the phosphidation of CuCl microsheets deposited onto nickel foam, and the effective catalytic activity of the Cu3P microsheets in the HER and OER is demonstrated. Due to their hierarchical structure, the Cu3P microsheets are superhydrophilic and superaerophobic. A well-defined superhydrophilic surface enhances the electrolyte-electrode contact, and a superaerophobic surface facilitates bubbles extraction and efficiently minimizes the dead area of the electrode induced by bubble coverage. These two features are beneficial for the high activity and stability of the electrocatalysts during the OER and HER. The superhydrophilic and superaerophobic Cu3P microsheets prepared at 450 degrees C afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 290 mV for the OER and 130 mV for the HER.

This study reports a facile and practical method to fabricate a non-noble metal catalyst by directly growing a Co-Fe Prussian blue analogue on a 3D porous conductive substrate, which is further phosphorized into a bifunctional Fe-doped CoP (Fe-CoP) electrocatalyst. The Fe-CoP/NF (nickel foam) catalyst shows efficient electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction, requiring low over-potentials of 190, 295, and 428 mV to achieve 10, 500, and 1000 mA cm(-2) current densities in 1.0 m KOH solution. In addition, the Fe-CoP/NF can also function as a highly active electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction with a low overpotential of 78 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) current density in alkaline solution. Thus, the Fe-CoP/NF electrode with meso/macropores can act as both an anode and a cathode to fabricate an electrolyzer for overall water splitting, only requiring a cell voltage of 1.49 V to afford a 10 mA cm(-2) current density with remarkable stability. This performance appears to be among the best reported values and is much better than that of the IrO2-Pt/C-based electrolyzer.									247	15	0	0	9	0	250				2198-3844		WOS:000447632000023	30356966	
J	Lv, Xingshuai; Wei, Wei; Wang, Hao; Huang, Baibiao; Dai, Ying								Multifunctional electrocatalyst PtM with low Pt loading and high activity towards hydrogen and oxygen electrode reactions: A computational study								APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL				255						117743	10.1016/j.apcatb.2019.05.045				OCT 15 2019	2019	Multifunctional electrocatalysts (MFECs) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are highly desirable for the development of electrochemical systems including water electrolysis, fuel cells and metal-air batteries, which have been rarely reported to date. Despite the high activity of Platinum (Pt), the limited reserves and high price severely limit its wide application. Therefore, it is urgent to explore catalysts requiring minimal amounts of Pt but still active to function. In accordance to the typical experimental electrocatalytic conditions for Pt monolayer (PtM), in this work we first identify the atomic configuration of PtM and evaluate the electronic and electrocatalytic properties towards HER, OER and ORR. Density functional theory (DFT) investigations suggest that PtM exhibits a buckled structure (b-PtM) and holds great promise for low-Pt-loading and, interestingly, all-in-one electrocatalyst, which could be highly active towards HER, OER and ORR. Our results show that the excellent electrocatalytic activity mainly originates from the amounts of highly active catalytic sites and low theoretical HER/OER/ORR overpotentials, even lower than those of currently commercialized Pt. Remarkably, the significantly reduced reaction barriers on b-PtM elucidate the fast reaction kinetics reported in experiments. Therefore, this work may stimulate the development of PtM electrocatalyst for other key energy conversion processes including oxygen evolution reaction and further breakthroughs of low-Pt-loading electrocatalysts.									47	3	0	0	2	0	47			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000474501500014		
J	Bader, KP; Schmid, GH								Cooperative binding of oxygen to the water-splitting enzyme in the filamentous cyanobacterium Oscillatoria chalybea								BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-BIOENERGETICS				1456	2-3			108	120		10.1016/S0005-2728(99)00108-5				JAN 10 2000	2000	In the filamentous cyanobacterium Oscillatoria ia chalybea ben photolysis of water does not take place in the complete absence of oxygen. A catalytic oxygen partial pressure of 15x10(-6) Torr has to be present for effective water splitting to occur. By means of mass spectrometry we measured the photosynthetic oxygen evolution in the presence of (H2O)-O-18 in dependence on the oxygen partial pressure of the atmosphere and analysed the liberations of O-16(2), (OO)-O-16-O-18 and O-18(2) simultaneously The observed dependences of the light-induced oxygen evolution on bound oxygen yield sigmoidal curves, Hill coefficient values of 3.0, 3.1 and 3.2, respectively, suggest that the binding is cooperative and that four molecules of oxygen have to be: bound per chain to the oxygen evolving complex. Oxygen seems to prime the water-splitting reaction by redox steering of the S-state system, putting it in the dark into the condition from which water splitting can start. It appears that in O. chalybea an interaction of oxygen with S-0 and S-1 leads to S-2 and S-3, thus yielding the typical oxygen evolution pattern in which even after extensive dark adaptation substantial amounts of Y-1 and Y-2 are found. The interacting oxygen is apparently reduced to hydrogen peroxide. Mass spectrometry permits to distinguish this highly specific oxygen requirement from the interaction of bulk atmospheric oxygen with the oxygen evolving complex of the cyanobacterium. This interaction leads to the formation H2O2 which is decomposed under O-2 evolution in the light. The dependence on oxygen-partial pressure and temperature is analysed. Structural peculiarities of the cyanobacterial reaction centre of photosystem II referring to the extrinsic peptides might play a role. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Here we report a high-performance OER electrocatalyst of nickel-tungsten-phosphorus (NiWP) film prepared by template method. This free-standing ternary electrocatalyst exhibits a remarkable electrocatalytic activity of OER in alkaline medium due to the synergetic effect among these elements and the good electrical conductivity. The reported NiWP composite catalyst has an overpotential of as low as 0.4 V (vs. RHE) at 30 mA cm(-2), better than that of the commercial RuO2 catalyst. Moreover, a small charge transfer resistance of 4.06 Omega and a Tafel slope of 68 mV dec(-1) demonstrate the outstanding catalytic activity.

Herein, we designed and developed a new class of layered cation ordered single perovskite oxides (Pr0.9Ca0.1Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta) with an optimum ratio of the Co4+/Co3+ oxidation state and oxygen vacancy for oxygen electrode reactions. Catalytic activities are investigated as a function of electronic structure and surface composition. A moderate amount of Ca and Fe dopants keeps the B-site Co cations at a higher oxidation state (Co4+) and generates a vast amount of an oxygen defect rich structure. The improved performance in the ORR and OER is explained by the increase in the sites of Co4+ cations, a state responsible for enhanced catalytic activity. A hypothesis for how doped Ca fraction affects the adsorbed oxygen species and contributes to catalytic activity is discussed. This work sheds light on the influence of crystal structure on the catalytic property and reports that ORR and OER activities are affected not only by oxygen vacancy concentration but also by the oxidation state of the transition metal in the perovskite oxide.									9	0	0	0	1	0	8			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000633049000001	34075924

Here, a self-templating strategy is reported to synthesize Ni-Fe mixed diselenide cubic nanocages for the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The diselenide nanocages are derived from corresponding Prussian-blue analog nanocages, which are first obtained by treating the nanocube precursor with a site-selective ammonia etchant. The resulting Ni-Fe mixed diselenide nanocages perform as a superior OER electrocatalyst, which affords a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small overpotential of 240 mV; a high current density, mass activity, and turnover frequency of 100 mA cm(-2), 1000 A g(-1), and 0.58 s(-1), respectively, at the overpotential of 270 mV; a Tafel slope as small as 24 mV dec(-1); and excellent stability in alkaline medium.									342	18	0	0	21	0	345			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000414349800025	28922495

However, such methodology is, in essence, not reasonable for studying the intrinsic chemistry difference of electrocatalysts. To have a rational understanding of eta@ 10 mA cm(geo)(-2), here, its historical origin and its limitations on reflecting the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity are discussed. The eta@ 10 mA cm(geo)(-2) is a valid practical parameter to assess water-splitting devices, but it cannot determine whether a particular electrocatalyst is intrinsically active or not.									142	9	0	0	8	0	144			2366-9608			WOS:000450221100010

When depositing an active material, at first a sublayer of a noble metal is created at the surface of titanium. The task of the sublayer is usually reduced to the creation of a conducting sublayer that would hinder the passivation of titanium. Such a sublayer can be created from both iridium dioxide and platinum oxides that are produced by thermolysis of proper salts. The kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction in a 0.5 M solution of sodium sulfate on these oxides is substantially different. Specifically, the oxygen evolution process at IrO2 is characterized by a substantially lower overvoltage and more pronounced reversibility. Selective evolution of oxygen out of 0.5 M solutions of sodium chloride may be reached both on the basis of an anode with a sublayer of iridium dioxide and with a sublayer of platinum oxides. The surface of the obtained electrodes is enriched by molybdenum compounds.									5	1	0	0	0	0	6			1023-1935	1608-3342		WOS:000232592900004

Herein, ultrathin Ni(0)-embedded Ni(OH)(2) heterostructured nanosheets, referred to as Ni/Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets, with superior water splitting activity are synthesized by a partial reduction strategy. This synthetic strategy confers the heterostructured Ni/Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets with abundant Ni(0)-Ni(II) active interfaces for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and Ni(II) defects as transitional active sites for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The obtained Ni/Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets exhibit noble metal-like electrocatalytic activities toward overall water splitting in alkaline condition, to offer 10 mA cm(-2) in HER and OER, the required overpotentials are only 77 and 270 mV, respectively. Based on such an outstanding activity, a water splitting electrolysis cell using the Ni/Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets as the cathode and anode electrocatalysts has been successfully built. When the output voltage of the electrolytic cell is 1.59 V, a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) can be obtained. Moreover, the durability of Ni/Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets in the alkaline electrolyte is much better than that of noble metals. No obvious performance decay is observed after 20 h of catalysis. This facile strategy paves the way for designing highly active non-precious-metal catalyst to generate both hydrogen and oxygen by electrolyzing water at room temperature.									137	4	0	0	9	0	136			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000508050100001	31957117

The Proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis system is a promising technique for the generation of hydrogen due to its high electrolytic efficiency, safety and reliability, compactness, and quick response to renewable energy sources. However, the instability of catalysts for electrochemical water splitting under operating conditions limits their practical applications. Until now, only precious metal-based materials have met the requirements for rigorous long-term stability and high catalytic activity under acid conditions. In this review, the recent progress made in this regard is presented and analyzed to clarify the role of precious metals in the promotion of the electrolytic decomposition of water. Reducing precious metal loading, enhancing catalytic activity, and improving catalytic lifetime are crucial directions for developing a new generation of PEM water electrolysis catalysts. A summary of the synthesis of high-performance catalysts based on precious metals and an analysis of the factors affecting catalytic performance were derived from a recent investigation. Finally, we present the remaining challenges and future perspectives as guidelines for practical use.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2079-4991		WOS:000839965300001	35957050

Although transition metal-based sulfide catalysts have been widely studied as effective catalysts for the HER and OER in alkaline media, their electrocatalytic performances are much lower than those of noble metal catalysts, and their synthesis process is too cumbersome. Here, we report the synthesis of amorphous transition metal-based sulfides (NiSx, CuSx and FeSx) through facile one-step sulfuration of metal foam, exhibiting excellent bifunctional performance and durability towards alkaline hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions. Inspiringly, NiSx/NF only requires a low overpotential of 53 and 225 mV for the HER and OER to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and has high durability for the HER and OER for up to 100 hours at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution. The superior catalytic activity is attributed to more exposed active sites, accelerated HER and OER kinetics and its unique amorphous structure. This important discovery opens a new possibility for the simple synthesis and demonstration of earth-abundant transition metal sulfide electrocatalysts for sustainable energy production.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000834893100001

Herein, we report the successful growth of hierarchical NiCo2O4-carbon dots (CDs) nanoneedle arrays supported on nickel foam through a simple and environmentally benign hydrothermal self-assembly technique. The designed material acts as a binder free electrode and shows bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as well as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium. An electrocatalyst sample with an optimal loading of CDs (25 mg) requires a low overpotential of 146 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm(2)for the HER in an alkaline medium, whereas it requires an overpotential of 390 mV to achieve a current density of 50 mA/cm(2)for the OER in the same alkaline medium. The excellent electrocatalytic activities of the sample with loading of CD can be ascribed due to the presence of large number of exposed active sites offered by CD/NiCo(2)O(4)and the enhanced electron transfer processes occurring as a result of hierarchical structure composed of three-dimensional nickel foam and the NiCo2O4-CDs nanoneedle arrays. Thus, the synthesis method introduced in this present work is a facile and cost-effective approach for the construction of bifunctional electrocatalysts with high reactivity and excellent durability.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1040-0397	1521-4109		WOS:000546340200001

Herein, we report the hydrothermal synthesis of copper sulfide-nickel sulfide (Cu2S-Ni3S2) arrays supported by three-dimensional conducting nickel foam as a substrate (Cu2S-Ni3S2/NF). Cu2S-Ni3S2/NF demonstrates prominent electrocatalytic activity and persistent stability (>25 h) in alkaline solution (1 M KOH), requiring the overpotential of -149 mV and 329 mV to drive the catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER and OER, respectively. Furthermore, overall-water splitting in symmetrical configurations required the cell-voltage of 1.77 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2), complimented with an ultra-long term stability for 100 h. Therefore Cu2S-Ni3S2/NF could be a promising and effective electrocatalyst for water-splitting reactions.									24	0	0	0	1	0	24			2365-6549			WOS:000516865300014

Both the HCF and SCF samples demonstrate bifunctional catalytic activities towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) while the former has higher current density and lower overpotential compared to the latter towards both OER and HER owing to its uniform shape and smaller size making it a better catalyst.

Herein, an ethanol-water mediated co-precipitation approach is applied to fabricate Co-Mn-Ni (CMN) ternary spinel oxides with uniform 1D structure. Their catalytic activities toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are investigated by the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) techniques. The ternary spinet oxide with the Co/Mn/Ni atomic ratio of 2:3:1 (CMN-231) exhibits the best bi-functional activities among the as-prepared ternary, binary and unitary spinel oxides (Delta E is as low as 0.88 V), which can be attributed to its reasonable element composition, mesoporous nanorod structure, strong oxygen-adsorption ability and good charger-transfer capability. In addition, the CMN-231 catalyst demonstrates a strong stability during long-term operation. This well-designed catalyst is applied in a homemade zinc-air battery, and exhibits good charge-discharge performances (voltage gap is 0.9 V at 50 mA cm(-2)) and remarkable cycling stability.									34	2	0	0	4	0	34			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000482496300027

In this work, we report a facile heterostructure of nickel foam supporting hollow Co9S8 nanoarrays wrapped by NiFe-layered double-hydroxide (Co9S8@NiFe-LDH/NF) as the electrocatalyst for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to improve the water-splitting efficiency. By the structural design, the strong electronic interaction among each component could offer more actives sites, higher charge transfer capability and better durability. As a result, excellent electrocatalytic activity for HER and OER are obtained. In 1 M KOH solution, the Co9S8@NiFe-LDH/NF exhibits low overpotentials of 287 mV for OER and 280 mV for HER to achieve catalytic current density of 50 mA cm(-2).

Recent research show that doping CoS2 with heteroatoms is an effective method to obtain high performance catalysts. However, the effects of doping concentration and their catalytic mechanism are still not clear, which is important for designing catalysts with high efficiency. Here, based on the first principle calculation, the HER and OER performance of Cobalt-Selenium-Sulfide with different composing proportion are analyzed. Results show that CoSe1.5S0.5 exhibits the lowest HER/OER overpotentials, which is key for the high HER/OER performance. Both HER and OER catalytic performances can be modulated due to the change of the d band center of Co and hybridized orbitals caused by different doping concentration. Our finding is highly beneficial for efficient overall water splitting.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000711074100003

However, it is a big challenge to stabilize Vo to reserve the excellent activity under the highly oxidizing conditions of the OER process. Herein, we propose a strategy of lower valence-state doping to stabilize the Vo by inducing formation Vo. First-principle calculations indicated that the formation energies of Vo on CoOOH is decreased apparently after lower valence-state Zn doping. The increased holes sates in the t(2g) orbital can facilitate bonding with oxygen intermediates to activate the inert catalytic activity of CoOOH. Importantly, short hydrogen bonds (O center dot center dot center dot center dot H-O-ad) are formed by distorting the CoO6 octahedron after Zn-doping, thereby, the formative unique dual-center catalytic pathway can facilitating proton transfer to promote the sluggish OER. Our experimental results confirmed that Zn doped CoOOH contain more Vo, causing excellent durability and fast kinetic process for oxygen evolution including an incremental turnover frequency and a lower Tafel slope. Thus, the lower valence-state doping is promising strategy for fast-stabilized electro-catalytic water oxidation.									77	3	0	0	7	0	76			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000448994600018

Spin dependent potentials via exchange interactions, spin-orbit coupling or through magneto-electric effects catalyse the oxygen electrochemistry. The best catalysts show metal sites with localized spins and electron delocalization; a correlation exists between the rate constant for charge transfer reactions and spin-dependent electron mobility. Since during the OER and ORR the number of unpaired electrons is not conserved, magnetic potentials in optimum catalysts act as selective gates to enhance the transport of local spin currents. Overall magnetic potentials can reduce the bonding properties of the, donor or acceptor, orbitals in the catalyst, and electrons more easily transfer over the conduction band. The influence of spin dependent forces is generally applicable to oxygen catalysis, and supplements the physical interactions relevant for inorganic or organic, electro or photo, artificial or natural processes.									60	1	0	0	6	0	59			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000407763700014	28745744

Herein, a 3D bifunctional electrode of FeNi phosphide nanosheets with a thin amorphous layer on Nickel foam (FeNi-P/NF) is designed via phosphorizing NiFe-layered double hydroxide-coated nickel foam (FeNi LDH/NF) in red phosphorus vapor at 500 degrees C.

Multishell hollow structures containing multi-component metal ions provide better interface contact to improve the number of active sites of the catalyst itself. Herein, we successfully synthesized NiFe2O4 triple-shell hollow structures by one-step incorporating hydrothermal synthesis method. Hollow multi-shell microspherical NiFeOP nanoheterostructure composed of NiFe2O4, Ni2P and FeP2 is further fabricated by in-situ phase transition from the NiFe2O4 matrix induced by phosphating. The as-designed NiFeOP nanoheterostructure can be used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solution with overpotentials of 153 and 217 mV, respectively, to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Such superior electrocatalytic activities can be attributed to the abundant nano interfaces generated in the heterostructure and the rich nanopores on the shell structure, ensuring the large electrochemical surface area, highly-exposed active sites and fast charge transfer for electrocatalysis. In the oxygen evolution reaction, the NiOOH active intermediate was successfully detected. For hydrogen evolution reaction, DFT calculation shows that phosphating can adjust the hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy of atoms in the material, and greatly improve the hydrogen evolution performance. Finally, a two-electrode electrolyzer using NiFeOP as both cathode and anode is assembled for overall water splitting, which only requires a potential of 1.57 V to drive current of 10 mA cm(-2). The strategy of fabricate electrocatalyst with rich nanoheterostructure provides a good template for future catalyst design and electrocatalytic performance improvements.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000620263900006

Water oxidation is the distinctive photochemical reaction that permitted the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis and the eventual rise of eukaryotes. At what point during the history of life an ancestral photosystem evolved the capacity to oxidize water still remains unknown. Here, we study the evolution of the core reaction center proteins of Photosystem II using sequence and structural comparisons in combination with Bayesian relaxed molecular clocks. Our results indicate that a homodimeric photosystem with sufficient oxidizing power to split water had already appeared in the early Archean about a billion years before the most recent common ancestor of all described Cyanobacteria capable of oxygenic photosynthesis, and well before the diversification of some of the known groups of anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria. Based on a structural and functional rationale, we hypothesize that this early Archean photosystem was capable of water oxidation to oxygen and had already evolved protection mechanisms against the formation of reactive oxygen species. This would place primordial forms of oxygenic photosynthesis at a very early stage in the evolutionary history of life.									55	0	0	0	41	0	56			1472-4677	1472-4669		WOS:000458929400002	30411862

As an electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (OER), NiCo/AC exhibits superior catalytic activity with an onset potential of 0.85 V (vs. RHE), a half-wave potential of 0.74 V (vs. RHE) and a large limiting current density of 4.65 mA cm(-2) at 0.2 V (vs. RHE). Moreover, NiCo/AC also demonstrates the electrocatalytic oxidation activities toward water and benzyl alcohol, moreover, the benzyl alcohol oxidation reaction is more thermodynamically and kinetically favourable with 254 mV smaller overpotential than water oxidation at 10 mA cm(-2). Owing to these advantages, NiCo/AC as air cathode material is assembled into a home-made rechargeable zinc-air battery, resulting an almost 200 mV lower charging voltage at the current density of 50 mA cm(-2) in the presence of 0.1 M benzyl alcohol compared to the battery without benzyl alcohol, consequently obtaining 10.5% energy saving at the charging current density of 50 mA cm(-2) with high durability.

To date, Fe7S8 has been rarely reported to realize electrochemical overall water splitting because of its intrinsic poor conductivity. In this paper, Fe7S8/FeS2 heterostructured nanosheets with interface structures and defect sites are prepared via a facile hydrothermal method. Fe7S8/FeS2/C electrocatalysts are constructed through the addition of carbon powder to weaken the electron transfer barrier. As expected, Fe7S8/FeS2/C requires the overpotential of 262 mV and 198 mV to reach 10 mA/cm(2) toward oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, respectively. Moreover, Fe7S8/FeS2/C attains a voltage of 1.67 V at 10 mA/cm(2) and maintains long-term stability for 24 h toward overall water splitting in a two-electrode system. The excellent activity can be related to interface structures and surface defect sites, which boost the charge transfer rate owing to the rich active sites. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

A bottleneck in the process is the catalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction, involving the transfer of four electrons. The challenge is that the binding energies of all reaction intermediates cannot be optimized individually. However, experimental investigations have shown that drastic improvements can be realized for manganese and cobalt-based oxides if gold is added to the surface or used as substrate. We pro-pose an explanation for these enhancements based on a hydrogen acceptor concept. This concept comprises a stabilization of an *-OOH intermediate, which effectively lowers the potential needed for breaking bonds to the surface. On this basis, we investigate the interactions between the oxides and gold by using DFT calculations. The results suggest that the oxygen evolution reaction overpotential decreases by 100-300 mV for manganese oxides and 100 mV for cobalt oxides.									100	1	0	0	0	1	100			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000347536400023

The evolutions of oxygen volume fraction and temperature distributions in the furnace were obtained. Furthermore, the influences of air supply volume and the thermal boundary temperature on carbon monoxide productions and maximum temperature changes were investigated. It was found that the released gaseous products and oxygen consumptions of the coal-oxygen reaction increased slowly before 60 degrees C, and rapidly after exceeding 100 degrees C. The low oxygen volume fraction region was generated away from the air inlet and moved towards the air inlet. The movement of high-temperature spots in the furnace could be divided into heat storage stage, thermal stability stage and rapid oxygen consumption stage. With the acceleration of coal-oxygen reaction, the region of high-temperature spot first moved away from the air inlet, and then migrated towards the air inlet. In addition, the higher volume of air supply and thermal boundary temperature could promote coal-oxygen reactions and cause thermal runaway when the critical values were reached. This study is helpful for the prevention of the coal spontaneous combustion.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000604274600006

Zr doped ceria (ZDC) has been tested as active oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in air electrodes for Li-O-2 batteries. A ZDC-based air electrode exhibits a higher discharge capacity than that of a bare carbon-based air electrode. ZDC loaded in carbon air electrodes delivers a discharge capacity of 8435 mA h g(-1). The higher discharge voltages of Li-O-2 cells with ZDC, instead of bare carbon, could have originated from the higher oxygen reduction activity of ZDC. These oxides show a lower potential for Li2O2 oxidation than pure carbon. A significant increase in the kinetics for Li2O2 oxidation indicates the influence of the ZDC catalyst on the oxygen evolution reaction, The ORR and OER properties of the catalyst are explained in terms of the high fraction of active defect sites on its surface.									30	1	0	0	2	0	30			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000340347700050

Morphology, crystal structure, and composition of the obtained bimetallic nanostructures were systemically examined by various spectroscopic and microscopic techniques including scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The electrocatalytic performance of the synthesized materials was investigated for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). AgCu and AgNi bimetallic surfaces showed superior activity and stability compared to pristine Ag, Ni, or Cu. These observed enhancements on the bimetallic nanostructures are attributed to the synergistic effect between the elements present. AgNi nanoplate-decorated CFs exhibited the highest activity toward OER, which is attributed to the key role of Ag in stabilizing and increasing the number of beta- NiOOH surface sites, which are the most relevant OER-active Ni species.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2574-0970		WOS:000831216200001

Developing cost-effective, active and stable semiconducting photoelectrodes is extremely important for achieving PEC water splitting with high solar-to-hydrogen efficiency. Perovskite oxides as a large family of semiconducting metal oxides are extensively investigated as electrodes in PEC water splitting owing to their abundance, high (photo)electrochemical stability, compositional and structural flexibility allowing the achievement of high electrocatalytic activity, superior sunlight absorption capability and precise control and tuning of band gaps and band edges. In this review, the research progress in the design, development, and application of perovskite oxides in PEC water splitting is summarized, with a special emphasis placed on understanding the relationship between the composition/structure and (photo)electrochemical activity.									156	12	0	0	12	0	157			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000480139200001	30790407

Herein, we demonstrate a simple procedure for synthesis of a hybrid of MnO and metallic Co supported on N-doped graphene that exhibits activity and stability as a bifunctional ORR/OER catalyst, with a round trip ORR/OER overvoltage of 0.85 V, which remained constant for at least 70 h when cycling alternately, between oxygen evolution at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2 )and oxygen reduction at -1 mA cm(-2). Insights into the key properties of the catalyst that influence its performance are proposed based on structural characterization by TEM, SEM, Raman spectroscopy, XRD and XPS. Besides MnO and metallic Co as the predominant crystalline species in the Co-Mn hybrid oxide, XPS revealed Mn3O4 and CoO rich surfaces, ascribed to oxidation of MnO and metallic Co due to atmospheric exposure. The synergetic interaction between the Co-Mn hybrid oxides and N-doped graphene, as well as Co-Mn interaction, favor improved ORR, OER and bifunctional ORR/OER performance of the catalyst.

Herein, we develop an efficient method to boost the electrocatalytic performance of Pt mesoporous nanoparticles (Pt MNs) for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by a facile Ni, P co-incorporation strategy. The co-incorporation of Ni and P atoms in a Pt crystal structure can effectively modify its electronic structure, which contributes to the superior catalytic ability toward HER We also demonstrate that the as-fabricated PtNiP MNs could occur surface partial oxidation under oxidizing potentials to in situ form OER electroactive oxides/hydroxides species. The unique mesoporous structure and metal-nonmetal ternary alloyed composition make the PtNiP MNs a promising HER-OER bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting in alkaline media.									21	4	0	0	0	0	21			2168-0485			WOS:000469304900070

PANI molecules were in situ loaded on Fe3O4 nanoparticles through an efficient and simple process under mild conditions. The electronic structure of Fe3O4 was modulated by creating a strong interaction with PANI molecules, leading to enhanced activity and stability of the catalyst to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) geometrical current density at overpotential of 265 mV in 1 M aqueous KOH solution.

Since diatomite with porous structure can adsorb metal ions in aqueous solution, herein, we prepare the nanocomposite CoPt-x/Diatomite-C for both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, and diatomite is found significantly promotes the electrocatalytic activity and durability. With the presence of diatomite, CoPt-1/Diatomite-C shows a lower Tafel slope (63 mV dec(-1) at high potential range), larger diffusion-limited current density (4.94 mA cm(-2)) and superior durability for ORR. Particularly, the specific and mass activities of CoPt-1/Diatomite-C for ORR are 0.74 mA cm(-2) and 286 mA mg(-1), respectively, which are 2.5 and 3.0 times higher than that of CoPt-1/C without diatomite; For OER, the overpotential of CoPt-9/Diatomite-C decreases nearly 30 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), while the Tafel slope also reduces 16 mV dec(-1) versus CoPt-9/C catalyst. Moreover, a rechargeable Zn-air battery with these composites as air-cathode is self-assembled, and diatomite boosts the battery performance with desirable properties. CoPt-9/Diatomite-C displays the optimal performance, with a power density of 140 mW cm(-2), a specific capacity of 616 mA h g(-1) at 10 mA cm(-2) and an exceedingly robust cycling life.

Recently, Co-based oxides have been intensively investigated as some of the most efficient and cost-effective OER catalysts. In particular, compositional tuning of Co-based oxides via doping or substitution is shown to significantly affect their catalytic activity. Nevertheless, the origin of this enhanced catalytic activity and the reaction mechanism occurring at catalytic active sites remain controversial. Theoretical investigations are performed on the electrocatalytic properties of pristine and transition metal (Fe, Ni, and Mn)-substituted Co oxides using first-principle calculations. A comprehensive evaluation of the doping effects is conducted by considering various oxygen local environments in the crystal structure, which helps elucidate the mechanism behind the doping-induced enhancement of Co-based catalysts. It is demonstrated that the local distortion induced by dopant cations remarkably facilitates the catalysis at a specific site by modulating the hydrogen bonding. In particular, the presence of Jahn-Teller-active Fe(IV) is shown to result in a substantial reduction in the overpotential at the initially inactive catalysis site without compromising the activity of the pristine active sites, supporting previous experimental observations of exceptional OER performance for Fe-containing Co oxides.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11				2198-3844		WOS:000453685900021	30581721

Nickel and iron have emerged as promising electrocatalysts for the hydrogen production. Here we report on the synthesis of bimetallic quantum dot (QD) based electrocatalysts comprised of nickel and iron with a tunable composition via an environment-friendly method and their effects on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The Ni:Fe ratio was optimized and tuned for enhanced electrochemical catalytic activity of the formed QDs. The optimal compositions of NiFe QD based electrocatalysts were found to be 54.9% Ni and 25.3% Ni towards the OER and HER, respectively. The first principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to elucidate the synergistic effect of the NiFe QDs, revealing that the electronic properties such as the band gap energy and density of states (DOS) could be optimized by tuning the composition of the formed NiFe QDs. The approach described in the present study could be easily adapted to synthesize various QDs as advanced electrocatalysts for the efficient hydrogen production to address the pressing energy and environmental challenges.

Zero-field Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) are able to clearly identify Fe4+ in mixed-metal Co-Fe oxides. The highest Fe4+ population is obtained in the 40-60% Fe alloying range, and XAS identifies the ion residing in an octahedral oxide ligand field. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, as reflected in Tafel analysis of CoFeOx films in 1M KOH, tracks the absolute concentration of Fe4+. The results reported herein suggest an important role for the formation of the Fe4+ redox state in activating cobaltate OER catalysts at high iron loadings.

Exploring cost-effetive electrocatalysts with high efficiency is one of the most critical but challenging problems to overcome the slow reaction rate and high overpotential in OER. Layered double hydroxide (LDH) has excellent OER performance. However, their poor electrical conductivity and easy agglomeration limit their use. Currently, further phosphorizaton or incorporating with conductive substrates is an effective method to improve the OER performance. In this study, a hybrid product denoted as CoFe-P/Ti3C2Tx were successfully prepared by facile reflux hydrothermal and phosphorization. The optimized CoFe-P/Ti3C2Tx possesses a low overpotential of 270 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope (57.7 mV dec(-1)).

However, the large overpotential of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) seriously impedes their development and application. Therefore, it is crucial to find a catalyst with low cost and high stability for OER. Herein, we report a simple method to fabricate a series of porous catalysts encapsulated with Co3O4 nanoparticles by carbonizing and then oxidizing MOF precursors, which can regulate and produce a large number of oxygen vacancies. The overpotentials of Z67-Co3O4/C-4 and Z9-Co3O4/C-4 are only 353 and 349 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 60 and 67 mV dec(-1), respectively. These excellent properties can be attributed to the graphite carbon and unique hollow structure, as well as more water molecules adsorbed by oxygen vacancies, which effectively improve the conductivity and electron transfer and further promote OER activity. Thus, this preparation strategy can be applied to various MOF catalysts to regulate oxygen vacancies and thereby expanding their application in a wider range of fields.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2199-692X			WOS:000493015700001

To enhance the efficiency of the URFC, a bifunctional oxygen catalyst for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) needs to be developed. In this study, Ti4O7 supported Pt-based catalysts were prepared for a bifunctional oxygen catalyst (BOC) in URFC. Ti4O7 support was prepared using a low-temperature process with TiO2 and cobalt chloride hexahydrate at 950 degrees C under an H-2 atmosphere. The metal catalysts (60 wt%) were deposited on a Ti4O7 support using a borohydride reduction method. The catalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Compared to Pt/C and Pt/Ti4O7, PdriTi(4)O(2) exhibited enhanced activity and stability in ORR and OER. The improved electrocatalytic performance of Rlr alloy supported by Ti4O7 might be attributed to the PtIr alloy phase, the highly stable Ti4O7 support in an acid medium, and the interaction between catalyst and support.

In an effort to minimize noble metal contents, we herein fabricated electrospun Sb-doped SnO2 (ATO)/RO composite nanofibers as new anode materials by controlling precursor ratios. These composite nanofiber anodes have one-dimensional nanostructure assembled with highly uniform ATO and RO nanoparticles and their oxygen evolution potential was successfully tailored by compositional change. The ATO/RO nanofiber anodes, even with a small amount of RO of 3% exhibited superior electrocatalytic performance in oxidative organic degradation; complete degradation of bisphenol A as a model substrate was achieved during 20 min-electrolysis on ATO/RO anodes at a low current density of 3 mA.cm(-2). This strategy provides the optimization of oxygen evolution reaction and current efficiency, resulting in excellent capability for electrochemical water treatment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Although MABs possess drastically higher theoretical energy densities than traditional aqueous or lithium-ion batteries, the development and commercialization of MABs have been challenged considerably due to the lack of efficient and robust air-electrode electrocatalysts which are used for both oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER). To improve the bifunctional activity and stability of these electrocatalysts, doped-carbon composite catalysts have been explored as one type of modified electrode and have demonstrated great potential toward MAB applications due to the synergistic interactions between the dopant(s), carbon, and other noncarbon component(s). This article reviews the progresses and advancements in the development of various doped-carbon composite bifunctional catalysts for MAB cathodes with an emphasis on material selection, structural characterization and electrochemical properties, as well as their applications in MABs.

In this work, the unique chelation mode of benzene-1,4-dithiocarboxamide (BDCA) is first used to synthesize a novel palladium-BDCA coordination polymer (PdBDCA) as a precursor of palladium sulfide nanoparticles-decorated nitrogen and sulfur doped carbon (Pd4S-SNC). The newly synthesized PdBDCA and Pd4S-SNC nanoparticles are characterized using chemical, electrochemical, and surface analysis methods. Notably, the nanoparticles obtained at 700 degrees C exhibit the remarkable catalytic property for the hydrogen evolution reaction in 0.5 m H2SO4, showing the overpotential of 32 mV (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and Tafel slope of 52 mV dec(-1), which are comparable to that of Pt/C. The catalyst also shows a high oxygen reduction activity, offering the half-wave and onset potentials of 0.92 and 0.77 V (vs RHE) in 0.5 m H2SO4, with improved methanol tolerance and long-term stability compared with Pt/C.

It is worth noting that Co3+ plays a vital role in the process of oxygen evolution catalysis, because Co3+ ions are considered to be active sites. The development of catalysts with high Co3+ content has important application prospects for improving water oxidation efficiency. This paper uses a simple ligandassisted synthesis method to promote the transformation of two-dimensional layered double hydroxides (LDHs) into two-dimensional metal organic frameworks (MOFs).

Here, we highlight the surface functionalized perovskite, oxygen vacancies-rich Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta (GDC) decorated Pr0.5Ba0.5CoO3-delta (PBC), as a novel bifunctional electrode for Zn-air batteries. Surface decoration by GDC can not only introduce the abundant electrochemically active oxygen vacancies for ORR and OER, but also improve the structure stability of perovskite against practical operation. Density functional theory calculations further reveal that O-2 and H2O molecules readily adsorb on GDC surface rather than PBC surface. The resulting 20 wt.% GDC decorated PBC catalyst delivers a significantly higher bifunctionality than the pristine PBC. As a proof-of-concept, an assembled Zn air battery using 20 wt.% GDC decorated PBC electrode demonstrates a considerable peak power density and a long cycling life. This study offers a facile and effective approach to design air electrode of rechargeable Zn-air batteries.									63	2	0	0	0	0	62			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000517665200037

Out of all the doped models, S doped graphene shows maximum efficiency that was further enhanced by adjusting the concentration of codopants B and N around the active dopant site.

Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses confirmed that Co3O4 nanocrystals were homogeneously distributed on both sides of graphene nanosheets. The obtained composite shows enhanced catalytic activities in both alkaline and neutral electrolytes. The onset potential towards the oxygen evolution reaction is 0.406 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in 1 M KOH solution, and 0.858 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in neutral phosphate buffer solution (PBS), respectively. The current density of 10 mA/cm(2) has been achieved at the overpotential of 313 mV in 1 M KOH and 498 mV in PBS. The graphene-Co3O4 composite also exhibited an excellent stability in both alkaline and neutral electrolytes. In particular, no obvious current density decay was observed after 10 hours testing in alkaline solution and the morphology of the material was well maintained, which could be ascribed to the synergistic effect of combining Co3O4 and graphene.									235	11	0	0	13	0	239			2045-2322			WOS:000347795500001	25559459

Hence, the rational design of highly efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution is the key to unlocking its wider use. Herein, cobalt-iron selenide nanoframes are reported for the efficient water oxidation, which need only 270 mV overpotential to give a 10 mA cm(-2) current density and outperforms most cobalt-based catalysts, and even the benchmarked commercial ruthenium oxides (RuO2). More profoundly, iron doping regulates the local spin state of cobalt species, which further accelerates charge transfer and formation of oxygenated intermediates, and consequently contributes to the enhanced oxygen evolution. This work demonstrates a highly efficient oxygen evolution electrocatalyst and may pioneer a promising approach which involves tuning the local electronic structure to achieve the improved electrocatalysis activities in energy conversion technologies.									73	3	0	0	7	0	74			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000611850000015

First-row transition metal complexes (e.g., Cu, Fe, Co and Ni) have great potential to electrochemically catalyze water oxidation for oxygen evolution because of their abundance and cheapness. In this review, these metal complexes as water oxidation electrocatalysts were summarized. Their catalytic properties including overpotential, stability, and turnover rate were discussed.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1452-3981			WOS:000436257800044

While nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) has been long recognized as a promising non-precious electrocatalyst for OER, its intrinsic activity needs further improvement. Herein, we design a highly-efficient oxygen evolution electrode based on defective NiFe LDH nanoarray. By combing the merits of the modulated electronic structure, more exposed active sites, and the conductive electrode, the defective NiFe LDH electrocatalysts show a low onset potential of 1.40 V (vs. RHE). An overpotential of only 200 mV is required for 10 mA cm(-2), which is 48 mV lower than that of pristine NiFe-LDH. Density functional theory plus U (DFT+U) calculations are further employed for the origin of this OER activity enhancement. We find the introduction of oxygen vacancies leads to a lower valance state of Fe and the narrowed bandgap, which means the electrons tend to be easily excited into the conduction band, resulting in the lowered reaction overpotential and enhanced OER performance.									52	10	0	0	1	0	53			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000439326400004

The results show that the anodic layer on Pb-Ag-Nd alloy formed through pulse current polarization is more intact and presents fewer micro-holes than that formed through constant current polarization. This could be attributed to the low current density period, which works as a 'recovery period'. During this period, the oxygen evolution reaction is less intense, which benefits the recovery of porous anodic layer. Pb-Ag-Nd anode also shows a lower anodic potential during pulse current polarization, which is in accordance with its smaller charge transfer resistance and smaller Tafel slope coefficient at high over-potential region. The lower anodic potential could be ascribed to the higher concentration of PbO2 in the anodic layer, which promotes the formation of more reactive sites for the oxygen evolution reaction.									4	2	0	0	1	0	5			1003-6326	2210-3384		WOS:000356221500041

Then, the catalytic performance of the powder as a bifunctional catalyst towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was evaluated. The effect of this processing method on the as-prepared powders was studied through nitrogen adsorption (BET), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). The remarkable electrocatalytic activities were observed in all the synthesized La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-d compared with Ketjen black. Combined with the structure and electrochemical properties, a systematical study on the catalytic activity of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-d towards both OER and ORR was carried out. Besides, the battery capacity of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-d was investigated in a lithium-air battery as an air cathodic catalyst.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1452-3981			WOS:000396470000019

Transition metal oxides (TMOs), as a more economical option, have emerged as an alternative to potentially replace conventional precious metal catalysts. However, many experimental studies have suggested that although a few of the TMOs supported by conductive substrates are stable under electrocatalytic conditions, their performances are far from the industrial level, especially in the acidic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). At present, their ORR and also oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances are still not well understood. In this study, we analyze the effects of the support on ORR/OER adsorbate binding to TMO catalysts. We show that for wide bandgap TMOs (e.g., ZrO2 and HfO2), the use of a metal support leads to a marked enhancement of the adsorbate binding strengths due to a significant induced electron charge gain in the adsorbates, and a considerable up-shift in the ORR/OER adsorbate binding scaling relation. Meanwhile, these support-induced effects are significant even with relatively thick TMO layers on a thin metal substrate, requiring a large thickness cutoff to eliminate the influence. In contrast, the metal-like TMOs (e.g., PdO2 and SnO2) are less affected by the metal support. This study suggests that the thickness of the TMO layer can be used to tune the adsorption properties of electronegative adsorbates and thus provides an interesting new design option for oxygen electrocatalysis.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000592983900012	33174543

In particular, single atoms anchored at cationic vacancies can enhance the stability of the catalysts and improve reaction kinetics. In this work, Pt single atoms are loaded at layered alpha-Ni2/3Fe1/3(OH)(2) by oxidizing Fe2+ with H2PtCl6, and specifically, Pt atoms are anchored at in situ generated iron cationic vacancies during the process, resulting in stabilized Pt single atoms in the surface of alpha-Ni2/3Fe1/3(OH)(2) with the maximum loading of approximate to 6.15 wt%. The Pt single atoms not only act as active sites for hydrogen evolution reaction but also regulate the electronic structure of NiFe hydroxides and activate Ni atoms adjacent to Pt for oxygen evolution reaction. Therefore, the water-splitting electrolyzer assembled with such a bifunctional catalyst shows a smaller overpotential than that with RuO2 and 20 wt% Pt/C catalysts as the anode and cathode, respectively, and efficient solar-to-hydrogen conversion. The results demonstrate the practical application of single-atom Pt catalysts with low cost, large loading, and facile preparation route.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000795785800001

Herein, we report a highly efficient and stable ternary Nickel Iron oxide (NiFe2O4) electrocatalyst for bifunctional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline medium. The as-synthesized NiFe2O4 has been confirmed by techniques like FESEM, HR-TEM, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectra analysis. NiFe2O4 demonstrate nanoparticle morphology with an average size of similar to 10 nm. The synthesized NiFe2O4 electrocatalyst exhibit superior electrocatalytic efficiency for OER, and achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 290 mV, with smaller Tafel slope of 42 mV/dec. A stable performance of OER is obtained at 10 mA cm(-2) for more than 8 h. The electrocatalytic activity of NiFe2O4 is comparable with benchmark electrocatalyst IrO2/C. Similarly, NiFe2O4 also shows superior HER activity in 1 M KOH. The enhanced bi-functional activity of NiFe2O4 is thought to be the synergy between the multicomponent structure of NiFe2O4, high surface area, and stability leading to high electrical conductivity.									31	0	0	0	0	0	31			2365-6549			WOS:000476767700002

The Co/Ni@GC/NCNTs/CNFs electrode has a half-wave oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) potential of 0.80 V, a superior standing stability with 84.8% current retention after 175 000 s. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) reach a lower overpotential of 0.395 V and 0.15 V, respectively. Moreover, the resultant sample is an air cathode catalyst in a microbial fuel cell and indicates an utmost power density of 2100 +/- 45 mW cm-2, which is much better than that of the Pt/C electrode (1334 +/- 61 mW m-2). The density functional theory calculation demonstrates that the designed Co/Ni@GC/NCNTs/CNFs catalyst can remarkably promote OER, ORR, and HER performance.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1359-8368	1879-1069		WOS:000735256900003

As a vital part of the cathode electrode, the bi-functional catalysts promoting the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) during discharge and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during recharge, usually have a strong impact on the energy/power density, cycle life and charging efficiency of ZABs. With their cost-effective and unique physiochemical properties, the rationally designed carbon-based oxygen electrocatalysts show conspicuous advantages to the overall performance. This review focuses on the discussion of the up-to-date advances in the design of various carbon-based oxygen electrocatalysts with controlled chemical compositions, tailored shapes, and designed structures for aqueous/solid-state electrolyte-based ZABs. Finally, we describe an overview of the latest achievements and challenges, as well as propose some perspectives on future development trend of bi-functional oxygen electrocatalysts for advanced ZABs.									27	0	0	0	0	0	27			2451-9103			WOS:000424677900008

Metal oxides have been considered as good candidates for electrocatalytic OER because they can be easily synthesized and are relatively stable during the OER process. However, inevitable structural variations still occur to them due to the complex reaction steps and harsh working conditions of OER, thus impending the further insight into the catalytic mechanism and rational design of highly efficient electrocatalysts. The aim of this review is to disclose the current research progress toward the structural variations of metal oxide-based OER electrocatalysts. The origin of structural variations of metal oxides is discussed. Based on some typical oxides performing OER activity, the external and internal factors that influence the structural stability are summarized and then some general approaches to regulate the structural variation process are provided. Some operando methods are also concluded to monitor the structural variation processes and to identify the final active structure. Additionally, the unresolved problems and challenges are presented in an attempt to get further insight into the mechanism of structural variations and establish a rational structure-catalysis relationship.									17	1	0	0	1	0	17			2366-9608			WOS:000711736900001	34928041

Here, we develop a facile bottom-up method for the direct growth of ultrathin CoFe layered double hydroxide nanosheets on oxidized carbon nanotube surface in formamide aqueous solution. The preparation strategy results in the ultrathin nature of hydrotalcite-like layers with less than 5 nm thickness. The resultant composite offers a larger electrochemically active surface area and faster mass transfer rate owing to the more exposed active sites. This electrocatalyst exhibits superior oxygen evolution reaction performance to the bulk form with lower onset potential, smaller Tafel slope, and robust durability in 0.1 M KOH solution. The better water oxidation activity can be attributable to the strong synergistic effects of CoFe layered double hydroxide nanosheets and oxidized carbon nanotubes because of their ultrathin assembling and more available catalytic centers.

Electrochemical properties of the CF-NiCo2O4 film were evaluated by quasi-steady state polarization curve, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Results show that the enhanced electrocatalytic activity of the CF-NiCo2O4 film toward OER is a synergistic effect of improved intrinsic catalytic activity and increased surface area.

Low Cu(II) concentrations (Cu(II) per PSII reaction centre unit less than or equal to 230) that caused around 50% inhibition of variable chlorophyll A fluorescence and oxygen evolution activity did not affect the polypeptide composition of PSII, However, the extrinsic proteins of 33, 24 and 17 kDa of the oxygen-evolving complex of PSII were removed when samples were treated with 300 muM CuCl2 (Cu(II) per PSII reaction centre unit = 1400), The LHCII antenna complex and D1 protein of the reaction centre of PSII mere not affected even at these Cu(LI) concentrations. The results indicated that the initial inhibition of the PSII electron transport and oxygen-evolving activity induced by the presence of toxic Cu(II) concentrations occurred before the damage of the oxygen-evolving complex. Indeed, more than 50% inhibition could be achieved in conditions where its protein composition and integrity was apparently preserved.									46	2	0	0	41	2	50			0031-9317			WOS:000166038800019

However, the generation of these alternative fuels, through electrochemical means, is a relatively inefficient process due to gas passivation of the electrode surfaces. Uniform microstructured nickel surfaces were prepared by photolithographic techniques as a systematic approach to correlating surface morphologies to their performance in the electrochemically driven oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. Hexagonal arrays of microstructured Ni cylinders were prepared with features of proportional dimensions to the oxygen bubbles generated during the OER process. Recessed and pillared features were investigated relative to planar Ni electrodes for their influence on OER performance and, potentially, bubble release. The arrays of cylindrical recesses were found to exhibit an enhanced OER efficiency relative to planar nickel electrodes. These microstructured electrodes had twice the current density of the planar electrodes at an overpotential of 100 mV.

Herein, a novel trifunctional Br/Co/N Co-doped and defect-enriched porous carbon framework (BrHT@CoNC) is designed, which shows excellent electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as well as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Introduction of extensive defects by heteroatom-doping is simply achieved by pyrolysis of the surfactant, dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (DODAB) modified ZIF-67. The BrHT@CoNC composite shows great potential as an economical catalyst/electrode for both rechargeable Zn-air batteries and overall water splitting devices. This work opens a new avenue toward the exploration of cost effective heteroatom doped catalysts for efficient integration of three or more functions into one freestanding electrode.									28	2	0	0	0	0	28			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000538143000022

Besides standard graphite also a novel silicon-based negative electrode was examined and it was shown that the evolution of hydrogen and ethylene is considerably reduced on this material compared to graphite. Oxygen evolution was proven to happen on the oxidative reaction of a Li2O2 electrode, besides a certain oxidation of the electrolyte. The 4.5 V plateau upon the oxidation of Li[Ni0.2Li0.2Mn0.6]O-2 was likewise proven to be linked to oxygen evolution. Also in this case electrolyte oxidation was shown to be a side reaction. Layered positive electrode materials Li(Ni,Co,Al)O-2 and Li(Ni,Mn,Co)O-2 were also examined. The influence of different parameters on the CO2 evolution in lithium-ion batteries was shown up. The amount Of CO2 formation is increased by high temperatures and cell voltages, while the addition of vinylene carbonate (VC) decreases it. Li(Ni,Mn,Co)O-2 shows much less CO2 evolution than Li(Ni,Co,Al)O-2.

However, the high surface energy of a single atom causes agglomeration during preparation and catalytic measurement, resulting in damage to the catalytic sites. The strong interaction between substrate and monoatoms is the key factor to prevent the aggregation of individual metal atoms, and the geometry and electronic structure of the catalysts can be adjusted to optimize the catalytic activity. Due to the hierarchically pores, high specific surface area, and defect effect, nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NPC) has been widely studied as an ideal nonprecious metal single-atom support, which synergistically enhance the electrocatalytic performance toward oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, and nitrogen reduction reaction with non-noble metal single atoms. This review summarizes the controllable synthesis, characterization, theoretical calculation, and application of M (M = Co, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mo, etc.) single atoms on nitrogen-doped porous carbon. Finally, the future development and challenges of nitrogen-doped porous carbon supported nonprecious metal single-atom electrocatalysts for practical commercialization are concluded.									149	11	0	0	9	0	150			2366-9608			WOS:000485927700001

Pristine WO3 favours the hydrogen evolution reaction in most of its stable phase structures while the incorporation of rare earth elements with higher ionic radii favours both HER and OER kinetics due to the distortions that are created in the parent lattice structure creating many oxygen vacancies. Sm in different molar weight percentages (x = 1, 2, 4 and 5) was incorporated into the WO3 structure by a facile hydrothermal route. The Sm doped WO3 electrocatalysts showed affinity towards catalyzing both HER and OER. Sm 4% and Sm 5% doped samples outperformed in the HER and OER showcasing an exceptional Tafel slope value of 69 and 98 mV dec(-1) respectively in an acidic environment. Considering the practical accountability for overall water splitting, the respective electrocatalysts were deposited on carbon cloth (CC) which exhibited a superior Tafel slope of 54 and 90 mV dec(-1) for initiating the HER and OER respectively. The Sm doped WO3 electrocatalysts deposited on CC exhibited a high endurance for 12 h with incomparable stability in acidic media. The sophisticated conducting surface of CC along with the interfacial sites and defects consisting of oxygen vacancies proves that rare earth Sm-doped WO3 is an excellent candidate for overall water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000712005400001

We present a facile strategy to design the three-dimensional (3D) urchin-like sphere arrays Co3O4 as an effective bifunctional catalyst for electrochemical water splitting. The 3D urchin-like Co3O4 was directly grown on Ni foam by a hydrothermal reaction and annealing treatment at a low temperature. This process offers several advantages including facile synthesis, binder-free, and low cost. The 3D urchin-like Co3O4 as a catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction exhibits a low onset potential (-130 mV vs. RHE) and good cycling stability in an alkaline electrolyte. When urchin-like Co3O4 is used as a catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction, the onset potential is at 1.46 V (vs. RHE) with a low overpotential of only 230 mV. The good catalytic activity can be attributed to the unique urchin-like nanostructure, abundant mesopores, and low charge-transfer resistance (compared with Co3O4 NPs). In addition, H-2 and O-2 generation was performed using Co3O4 as both cathode and anode catalysts with a potential of 1.64 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we developed a melt polymerization strategy to synthesize iron-polyphthalocyanine (FePPc) metallic-organic frameworks (MOFs) over the carbon black matrix (FePPc@CB). Through non-covalent pi-pi interactions, FePPc molecules can anchor on carbon matrix, thus facilitating the electron transfer process and stabilizing the systems. Owing to abundant free electrons and atomically MN4 catalytic sites in the macrocycle structure, FePPc@CB exhibits excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic activity. The FePPc@CB also delivers excellent performances for liquid and flexible all-solid-state batteries compared to that of commercial Pt/C, making it a promising ORR/OER electrocatalyst.									63	9	0	0	0	0	63			1001-0521	1867-7185		WOS:000537401700003

The critical FeOOH, whose formation is controlled by the surface oxidation state and oxygen vacancy, dominates to improve the OER activity. The co-existence of ?-FeOOH, ?-VOOH, metallic Fe after activation enhances the OER activity. Oxygen vacancy and crystal water have also been shown to enhance the charge transfer. The optimized electrocatalyst gives OER current densities of 10 and 1000 mA cm-2 at excellent overpotentials of 195 and 293 mV, respectively. The electrocatalyst also shows excellent bifunctional performance for full-cell water splitting in alkaline electrolyte, giving a large current density of 1000 mA cm-2 at 2 V and is stable for 85 h. This work provides a new avenue to design an efficient and stable electrocatalyst material with large current density.									33	0	0	0	3	0	33			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000647683300006

Unfortunately, their energy efficiency is seriously plagued by sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) that alternately occurs on air electrodes. Herein, we demonstrate Co-based metal-organic framework (Co(bpdc)(H2O)(4) (bpdc=biphenyl -4, 4 '-dicarboxylic acid), Co-MOF) arrays as novel bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts. The Co-MOF is in situ constructed on a three-dimensional graphite foam (GF) through a hydrothermal reaction. In a 1 m KOH aqueous solution, the resultant Co-MOF/GF exhibits an OER overpotential of only approximate to 220 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which is much lower than those for Ir/C and previously reported noble metal-free electrocatalysts. In conjunction with its ORR half-wave potential of 0.7 V (vs. RHE), the Co-MOF/GF manifests a greatly decreased potential gap of approximate to 0.75 V in comparison with Pt/C-Ir/C couple and previously reported bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts. Furthermore, an assembled rechargeable zinc-air battery using Co-MOF electrocatalyst in an air electrode delivers a maximum power density of 86.2 mW cm(-2) and superior charge-discharge performance. Microscopic, spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses prove that the initial Co-MOF is transformed into Co-oxyhydroxides during the OER and ORR process, which essentially serve as bifunctional active centers.									43	5	0	0	3	0	43			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000452614800023	30192997

The thus synthesized bimetallic PdFe-NPs are supported on FeOx@C layers, which are essential for developing well-defined and distributed small NPs, 2.3 nm with 35% metal loading. They are used as bifunctional nanocatalysts for the electrocatalytic water splitting process. They display superior mass activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), both in alkaline and acid media, compared with those obtained for benchmarking platinum HER catalyst, and ruthenium, and iridium oxide OER catalysts. PdFe-NPs also exhibit outstanding stability against sintering that can be explained by the protecting role of graphitic carbon layers provided by the organic linker of the MOF. Additionally, the superior electrocatalytic performance of the bimetallic PdFe-NPs compared with those of monometallic Pd/C NPs and FeOx points to a synergetic effect induced by Fe-Pd interactions that facilitates the water splitting reaction. This is supported by additional characterization of the PdFe-NPs prior and post electrolysis by TEM, XRD, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman revealing that dispersed PdFe NPs on FeOx@C promote interactions between Pd and Fe, most likely to be Pd-O-Fe active centers.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2366-7486			WOS:000797470600001

In this work, the employment of a one-pot pyrolysis reaction to achieve molecular confinement, has led to the preparation of ruthenium (Ru)-based nanoclusters in a carbon matrix. A unique feature of the synthetic approach employed is that solvent and substrates were calcined together. As solvent evaporates, during calcination, the substrates form a dense solid which has the effect of limiting the aggregation of Ru centers during the carbonization process. The catalyst prepared in this simple manner showed an impressively high activity with respect to the hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER). The Ru nanoclusters (Ru NCs), as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts, require ultralow overpotentials of 5 mV and 5.1 mV at -10 mA center dot cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. Furthermore, the catalyst prepared by the one-pot method has higher crystallinity, a higher Ru content and an ultrafine cluster size, which contributes to its exceptional electrochemical performance. Meanwhile, the RuOX nanoclusters (RuOX NCs), obtained by oxidizing the aforementioned Ru NCs, exhibited good oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with an overpotential of 266 mV at 10 mA center dot cm(-2). When applied to overall water splitting, Ru/RuOX nanoclusters as the cathode and anode catalysts can reach 10 mA center dot cm(-2) at cell voltages of only 1.49 V in 1 M KOH.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000669299700002

However, TM-based materials generally suffer from unsatisfactory electrocatalytic activity because of their relatively low conductivity and unregulated electronic structure. Therefore, the electronic structure engineering of electrocatalysts is an efficient strategic approach to enhance catalytic performances and stabilities. In this review, recent experimental and theoretical advances in the intrinsic electronic structure regulation of TM-based nanomaterials are summarized in terms of preparation methods and underlying natures to boost hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. A systematic discussion is conducted on engineering strategies for TM-based nanomaterials to regulate their electronic structures, optimize their adsorption ability of reaction intermediates, and reduce reaction barrier. The existing challenges and perspectives of TM-based electrocatalysts are highlighted to provide new insights into technological advancement for hydrogen production.									22	1	0	0	0	0	22				2639-4979		WOS:000661316200007

Herein, a novel (CoNiMnZnFe)(3)O-3.2 high-entropy oxide (M3O3.2 HEO) has been synthesized by the entropy engineering approach to exhibit a low overpotential of 336 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 47.5 mV dec(-1) in OER process. After the 20 h chronoamperometry test in 1 M KOH alkaline solution, the HEO electrode retains 86.9% of its catalytic activity. The high activity and catalytic stability in OER process can be attributed to the synergetic effect of entropy stabilization and core-shell structure, which is characterized by abundant nanosheets appear on the edge of M3O3.2 HEO core, formed with the aid of in-situ electrochemical activation.

To enhance the catalysis reaction performance, here we reported Co3O4 nanocrystals anchored on phosphorus doped carbon nitride (P-CN) sheets via Co-N bonds for highly efficient OER By simply sintering the mixture of Co3O4 nanocrystals with P-CN sheets in the tube furnace, the Co-N bonds were well-formed as indicated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, forming efficient charge transfer channels to conquer the barriers between glassy carbon electrode surface and Co3O4 active sites. The Co3O4 nanocrystals distributed on the P-CN substrates homogeneously and exposed most of the potential active sites of Co3O4 during electrochemical processes.

Herein, we successfully design and fabricate a class of 3D-1D heterostructure of 3D CoZn oxyphosphide nanosheet assemblies anchored on 1D carbon nanotubes through a facile one-pot method. Interestingly, owing to the doping of phosphorus atoms, modified electronic structures, as well as high surface areas, the well-designed 3D-1D CoZnP/CNTs nanohybrids exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performances toward oxygen evolution reaction, which needs an overpotential of only 281 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and exhibits no evidences for activity degradation for 24 h, holding great potentials for acting as highly efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction. This work may offer new options for constructing promising nanocatalysts with well-defined heterostructure for water splitting and beyond.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			2196-0216			WOS:000444225300008

However, oxygen evolution is 4 electron transfer process that suffers from sluggish reaction kinetics and indolent thermodynamics which mandates the use of a suitable noble metal catalyst. Considering the availability and cost of these precious metal catalysts, development of catalyst based on more abundant metal such as Fe is of vital interest for practical implication of these technologies. In this regards, over past few years several Fe based heterogeneous electrocatalysts are investigated for their electrocatalytic activity. Significant advances in improving the catalytic activity as well as exploring the catalytic mechanism are achieved in this area. Herein, we present an in-depth review on the recent progress in this field. Specific attention is given to design, synthesis, catalytic performance and strategies for improving their performance. A brief overview of existing challenges and future directions in the field of OER catalyst is also summarized.									51	0	1	0	1	0	51			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000438001800013

J	Zheng, Hongli; Zhang, Qingrong; Hong, Zhensheng; Lin, Yanyu; Dai, Hong								A bifunctional catalyst based ECL immunosensor for a cardiac biomarker regulated by oxygen evolution reaction								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				215				326	333		10.1016/j.electacta.2016.08.120				OCT 2016	2016	Prostaglandin E1, a cardiac biomarker, is a pivotal member of the prostaglandin family which exerts diverse and powerful effects on cell function in many organ systems. In this study, a new approach for the ultrasensitive determination of prostaglandin E1 was proposed by using the ECL of peroxydisulfate with oxygen as coreactant. Compared to most peroxydisulfate ECL sensor, this proposed ECL strategy propounded employing oxygen evolution reaction to enhance the concentration of oxygen, which was unprecedented in ECL sensing platform. Herein, ultrathin NiCo2O4 nanosheets with large surface area and mesoporous structure were prepared by a facile method, and adamantane as enhancer was decorated on the surface of amino-modified NiCo2O4 to generate a bifunctional catalyst of NiCo2O4@AD(Prostaglandin E), which possessed excellent catalytic performance toward the oxygen evolution reaction. Accordingly, the sensitivity of ECL immunosensor was enhanced with the increasing concentration of oxygen by the bifunctional catalyst of NiCo2O4@AD. And the ECL response of the peroxydisulfate would decrease owing to the interaction between antibody and antigen on the modified electrode. Consequently, on the basis of the ECL intensity change of peroxydisulfate, the proposed immunosensor has realized ultrasensitive PGE1 assay with a wide linear detection range of 0.1 fg/ml to1 ng/ml and a detection limit of 0.1 fg/ml. The proposed ECL immunosensor was performed to analyze prostaglandin E1 in human serum, and satisfactory recoveries were obtained, indicating its potential applications in clinical diagnostics.

Herein, a heterostructure of cobalt-iron oxide/black phosphorus nanosheets is in-situ synthesized via a facile and novel three-electrode electrolysis method. Bulky black phosphorus is exfoliated into its nanosheets at the cathode while the CoFe oxide is derived directly from the metal wire anode during the electrolysis process. This heterostructure exhibits excellent electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, and the overpotential at 10 mA center dot cm(-2) is 51 mV lower than that of the commercial RuO2 catalyst. Its superior OER performance stems from the favorable adsorption behavior and an enlarged electrochemical active surface area of the catalyst. To reveal the origin of excellent OER performance from the point of adsorption strength of OH*, methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) test is applied under the identified OER operating conditions. Further introduction of light illumination enhances the OER activity of this heterostructure. The overpotential drops down to 280 mV, benefiting from pronounced photochemical response of black phosphorus nanosheets and iron oxide inside the heterostructure. This work develops a new electrochemical method to construct high performance and light-sensitive heterostructures from black phosphorus nanosheets for the OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000827917700002

In this work, it is demonstrated that through introducing exogenous Fe3+ (Feexo3+${\rm{Fe}}_{{\rm{exo}}}<^>{3 + }$) into the liquid electrolyte, not only is the reconstructed surface stabilized and optimized, but the lattice oxygen diffusion is also accelerated. As a result, compared to that in Fe-free 0.1 m KOH, PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+delta in 0.1 m KOH + 0.1 mm Fe3+ demonstrates a tenfold increment in activity, an extremely low Tafel slope of approximate to 50 mV dec(-1), and outstanding stability at 10.0 mA cm(-2) for 10 h. The superior activity and stability are further demonstrated in Zn-air batteries by presenting high open-circuit voltage, narrow potential gap, high power output, and long-term cycle stability (500 cycles). Based on experimental and theoretical calculations, it is discovered that the dynamical interaction between the Co hydr(oxy)oxide from surface reconstruction and intentional Fe3+ from the electrolyte plays an important role in the enhanced activity and durability, while the generation of a perovskite-hydr(oxy)oxide heterostructure improves the lattice oxygen diffusion to facilitate lattice oxygen participation and enhances the stability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000868042000001	36228095

Herein, to obtain a highly effective Co-N/C non-precious metal bifunctional catalyst, 3,5-diamino-1,2,4-triazole (Hdatrz) was used for the first time as a Nitrogen precursor. Different Co-Hdatrz complex weight percentages and thermal treatment temperatures had resulted in varying catalyst performance. Among the resulting catalysts, due to the highest active N content, the smallest charge transfer resistance and the synergy of CoO with carbon black, the Co-N-30%/C-600 catalyst (the Co-Hdatrz complex weight percentage was 30% and the thermal treatment temperature was 600 degrees C) demonstrated the highest catalytic activity towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium, which was superior to Pt/C. Additionally, the Co-N-30%/C-600 catalyst also showed excellent methanol tolerance and ORR and OER stabilities compared to Pt/C. Thus, the Co-N-30%/C-600 catalyst may serve as a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst in fuel cells, metal-air batteries and water splitting cells. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

As a stable, low cost, and high active OER catalyst, La2/3Sr1/3CoO3 (LSCO) has drawn substantial attention recently. Here we report a modulated OER performance of LSCO by different stoichiometry offsets, an overall ~& nbsp;2074.63% tunability can be seen. Meanwhile, the overpotential of LSCO exhibits a volcano trend as a function of oxygen concentration. These phenomena can be understood on the competition of double-and super-exchanges in Co3+/Co4+ with the help of the overlap of O 2p and Co 3d orbits. Our investigation provides an effective platform for obtaining a narrow window of improved electrochemical activity in correlated transition metal oxides.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000788753300002

In this paper, highly porous Co-doped NiO nanorods were successfully synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method. The porous rod-like nanostructures were preserved with the added cobalt dopant ranging from 1 to 5 at% but were broken into aggregated nanoparticles at higher concentrations of additional cobalt. The catalytic activity of Co-doped NiO nanostructures for OER in an alkaline medium was assayed. The 5%Co-NiO sample showed a drastically enhanced activity. This result could originate from the combination of advantageous characteristics of highly porous NiO nanorods such as large surface area and high porosity as well as the important role of Co dopant that could provide more catalytic active sites, leading to an enhanced catalytic activity of the nanocatalyst.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2054-5703			WOS:000697644700001	34567585

However, its high cost, unavailability, corrosion and related toxicity limited its application. The search for alternative with high stability, durability, and efficiency led scientists towards carbon nanoparticles supported catalysts which has high surface area, good electrical conductivity, tunable morphology, low cost, ease of synthesis and stability. Carbon nanoparticles are classified into two groups based on morphology, one and zero dimensional particles. Carbon nanoparticles at zero dimension, denoted as carbon dots, are less used carbon support compared to other forms. However, recently carbon dots with improved electronic properties have become popular as catalyst as well as catalyst support. This review focused on the recent advances in electrocatalytic activities of carbon dots. The mechanisms of common electrocatalytic reactions and the role of the catalysts are also discussed. The review also proposed future developments and other research directions to overcome current limitations.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2093-8551			WOS:000564463500002

We synthesized CoO nanooctahedra with diameters of similar to 48 nm and a narrow size distribution. Full control over nanoparticle size and morphology could be obtained by controlling the reaction time, surfactant ratio, and reactant concentrations. We show that the particle size does not increase monotonically with time or surfactant concentration but passes through minima or maxima. We unravel the critical role of the surfactants in nucleation and growth and rationalize the observed experimental trends in accordance with simulation experiments. The as-synthesized CoO nanooctahedra exhibit superior electrocatalytic activity with long-term stability during oxygen evolution.

The changes that occur at the Ni active sites during the electrocatalyic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were elucidated by a combination of operando Ni L-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and Ni 2p3d resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS). These data are compared to reference measurements on NiO, beta-Ni(OH)(2), beta-NiOOH, and gamma-NiOOH. Through this comparative analysis, we are able to show that under alkaline conditions (0.1 M KOH), the oxides of the Ni3MnO4 catalyst are converted to hydroxides. At the onset of catalysis (1.47 V), the beta-Ni(OH)(2)-like phase is oxidized and converted to a dominantly gamma-NiOOH phase. The present study thus challenges the notion that the beta-NiOOH phase is the active phase in OER and provides further evidence that the gamma-NiOOH phase is catalytically active. The ability to use Ni L-edge XAS and 2p3d RIXS to provide a rational basis for structure-activity correlations is highlighted.									31	0	0	0	3	0	31			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000492802100023	31523947

The catalyst films were prepared by chemical solution deposition (CSD) and are binder-free. Stepwise aging experiments illustrate a systematical approach to different degrees of degradation of the perovskites after defined testing cycles of cyclic voltammetry in application-near conditions. XPS and EDX characterization at each aging step enables a monitoring of the change in chemical composition during degradation. XPS analysis points to a change in the defect chemistry of PBCO during degradation. The influence of all monitored parameters on the overall electrode service lifetime is shown in a novel end of service life test (ESLT) at thin film perovskite electrodes of 100 nm thickness.

Compared with IrO2, these oxides contain less iridium and show higher catalytic activity. Especially, Sr3Ir2O7 (n = 2) displays enhanced activity of the optimum that is programmed by the dimensionality of the bulk crystal structure. As n decreased, a distinct d-band center downshift leads to weakened adsorption of oxygen intermediates, which accelerates the kinetics. Calculations also reveal an elevated conductivity in overall values from n = 1, 2 to infinity. Both the increased conductivity and optimized binding energy contribute the exceptional OER activity of Sr3Ir2O7. This work suggests a significant advance in understanding the relationship between intrinsic activity and the bulk crystal structure of R-P oxides.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000683027600001

Herein, single-phase (alpha-, beta-, and delta-) and mixed-phase (alpha/beta-, alpha/delta-, and beta/delta-) FeOOH nanostructures have been successfully synthesized through a controlled solvothermal route. Combined analyses of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and partial density of state calculation suggest that rich oxygen vacancies confined in the mixed-phase FeOOH samples (with optimized electronic structure) can effectively improve the OER activity. Notably, the mixed phase of, beta/delta-FeOOH displays an enhanced OER activity and stability in the alkaline media, with a very low overpotential of similar to 180 mV vs a reversible hydrogen electrode at 10 mA cm(-2). Understanding of the phase-induced activity may also pave a pathway for the design and synthesis of highly efficient electrocatalysts.									129	6	0	0	8	0	130			2155-5435			WOS:000502169900013

Understanding these reconstructions in reactions is essential to illustrate the correlations between the structure and reactivity of catalyst, as well as the rational design of efficient catalyst. Here, single metal phophide materials are adopted as model electrocatalysts to show the structure evolution in the process of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). After both OER and HER operation, the core-shell structured metal-hydroxideioxyhydroxide@metal-phosphide catalysts are generated, resulting in the high but decreased activity. To overcome the activity deterioration of metal phosphide induced by morphology reconstruction, binary heterostructure metal phosphides catalysts are designed and show the better OER and HER activity and stability compared to those of single phosphides. The work illustrates the structure-performance relationship of catalyst surface dynamics on catalytic performance, which will provide the guidance for designing high performance electrocatalysts, photocatalysts, and thermal catalysts.

By performing systematic density functional theory calculations of fourteen different atomic structures of iron/nitrogen/carbon compounds, multiple reaction active sites are found and compared, and manifold reaction pathways and relevant reaction mechanisms are defined. This study indicates that among various iron/nitrogen/carbon compounds, square planar Fe-N-G heterocatalysts are the most promising electrocatalysts for the OER and the ORR that favor dissociative reaction pathways. In addition, the crucial role of high mobility pi electrons in ortho-C atoms near embedded metal atoms is revealed via the molecular orbital theory. This study presents a new perspective with which to understand the catalytic mechanism of single-metal-atom embedded in graphene-based materials, which has become the most competitive catalyst with traditional electrocatalysts for renewable energy industries.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000523185200016

Cost-effectiveness, abundance, and efficiency are the major challenges of the electrocatalysts. Herein, this paper reports the use of low-cost 304-type stainless steel mesh as suitable electrocatalysts for splitting of water. The commercial and self-support stainless steel mesh is subjected to exfoliation and heteroatom doping processes. The modified stainless steel electrocatalyst displays higher oxygen evolution reaction property than the commercial IrO2, and comparable hydrogen evolution reaction property with that of Pt. More importantly, an all-stainless-steel-based alkaline electrolyzer (denoted as NESSP//NESS) is designed for the first time, which possesses outstanding stability along with lower overall voltage than the conventional Pt//IrO2 electrolyzer at increasing current densities. The remarkable electrocatalytic properties of the stainless steel electrode can be attributed to the unique exfoliated-surface morphology, heteroatom doping, and synergistic effect from the uniform distribution of the interconnected elemental compositions. This work creates prospects to the utilization of low-cost, highly active, and ultradurable electrocatalysts for electrochemical energy conversion.									144	11	0	0	7	0	150			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000409448300025	28681991

Accordingly, over the past years, much effort has been made to develop various electrocatalysts with superior performance and reduced cost. Among them, ruthenium (Ru)-based materials for OER and HER are very promising because of their prominent catalytic activity, pH-universal application, the cheapest price among the precious metal family, and so on. Herein, recent advances in this hot research field are comprehensively reviewed. A general description about water splitting is presented to understand the reaction mechanism and proposed scaling relations toward activities, and key stability issues for Ru-based materials are further given. Subsequently, various Ru-involving electrocatalysts are introduced and classified into different groups for improving or optimizing electrocatalytic properties, with a special focus on several significant bifunctional electrocatalysts along with a simulated water electrolyzer. Finally, a perspective on the existing challenges and future progress of Ru-based catalysts toward OER and HER is provided. The main aim here is to shed some light on the design and construction of emerging catalysts for energy storage and conversion technologies.									272	11	0	0	13	1	272			2155-5435			WOS:000494549700027

Oxide nanosheets show higher activity during photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from CH3OH/water after doping with single-atom reaction sites in the lattice. However, water splitting into H-2 and O-2 from pure water has not yet been achieved on such materials because backward reactions, such as oxygen reduction, are also accelerated at these same reaction sites. In the present study, calcium niobate nanosheets incorporating Rh single-atom reaction sites covered with ultrathin NiOx atomic layers are fabricated. The nanosheets having a Ni/Rh atomic ratio of 7/1 are found to promote evolution of H-2 and O-2 from water. In this system, the ultrathin NiOx atomic layers prevent oxygen penetration but allow H+ to access the Rh reaction sites, thus promoting photocatalytic water splitting for H-2 and O2 production. This is the first demonstration of perfect water splitting using a nanosheet photocatalyst with single-atom reaction sites.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000575823600022

Scale up of lab-scale active catalysts presents challenges to this end. Here, we take advantage of the spontaneous corrosion electrochemistry to make nonprecious multimetallic hydroxides for efficient oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolytes. Ternary FeNiCr and FeCoCr hydroxides are developed by oxygen- and sulfate-mediated corrosion engineering of macroporous Fe foam substrates. Cr doping is successfully achieved for regulating and accelerating the in situ phase transformation of Ni active sites into oxyhydroxide active phase to afford high intrinsic electrocatalytic activity and surface-intermediate interactions. Low overpotentials of 323 and 329 mV are achieved for delivering a large current density of 500 mA cm(-2) using FeNiCr and FeCoCr electrocatalysts, respectively. Long-term stability at large current densities, reproducible performance, and facile scale up obtained suggests a great potential of designing highly efficient multi-metal electrocatalysts for water electrolysis technologies by corrosion engineering.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-0485			WOS:000818795400001

However, the activity of these materials toward overall water splitting is still unsatisfactory because a larger voltage is needed to drive the reactions. This study shows that more-efficient bifunctional catalysts based on NiCo2O4 materials can be obtained by adopting an integrated composite electrode with robust hollow structures. This novel electrode is constructed by the growth of hollow Ni@NiCo2O4 nanorod arrays on three-dimensional (3D) Ni foam. The interlayer of Ni hollow nanorods is conformally covered by NiCo2O4 nanosheets, providing large surface area and fast electron transport. Benefiting from these integrated characteristics, the hollow Ni@NiCo2O4 electrode as an oxygen evolution electrocatalyst can deliver a low overpotential of 270mV at 10mAcm(-2) and present excellent electrochemical durability. Meanwhile, the HER performance also impressive, with an overpotential of about 87mV at 10mAcm(-2). As a result, the hollow Ni@NiCo2O4 electrode as a bifunctional catalyst can achieve a current density of 10mAcm(-2) with a voltage of only 1.58V, showing promise for high performance yet cheap electrocatalysts for the overall water splitting reactions.									29	1	0	0	2	0	29			2199-692X			WOS:000419237800018

This is because the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a vital reaction for the operation, is substantially sluggish even with precious metals-based catalysts. Here, we show for the first time that a hexagonal perovskite, BaNiO3, can be a highly functional catalyst for OER in alkaline media. We demonstrate that the BaNiO3 performs OER activity at least an order of magnitude higher than an IrO2 catalyst. Using integrated density functional theory calculations and experimental validations, we unveil that the underlying mechanism originates from structural transformation from BaNiO3 to BaNi0.83O2.5 (Ba6Ni5O15) over the OER cycling process.									171	7	0	0	12	0	174			0002-7863			WOS:000372477700040	26910187

Herein, cobalt-based catalysts are developed by taking the advantage of the strong electronegativity of halogen elements, whose activity and stability are also guaranteed. A "theory-calculation-experiment" research system is proposed to sort out the relationship between the electronegativity of heteroatoms and the electronic structure of layered Co-O/F, Co-O/ Cl, and Co-O/Br, for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Experiments corresponding to calculations also verify that the stronger the electronegativity of the halide ions in the cobalt oxide catalyst, the more obvious the improvement of OER performance. By understanding the electronegative screening of halogen modification, a new perspective on designing principles for water-splitting devices based on bandgap-engineered metal oxides is proposed.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10				2688-4062		WOS:000696236200009

Herein we report the tuning of the local atomic structure of nickel-iron layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDHs) by partially substituting Ni2+ with Fe2+ to introduce Fe-O-Fe moieties. These Fe2+-containing NiFe-LDHs exhibit enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with an ultralow overpotential of 195 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is among the best OER catalytic performance to date. In-situ X-ray absorption, Raman, and electrochemical analysis jointly reveal that the Fe-O-Fe motifs could stabilize high-valent metal sites at low overpotentials, thereby enhancing the OER activity. These results reveal the importance of tuning the local atomic structure for designing high efficiency electrocatalysts.									212	17	0	0	20	0	214			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000438712600029	29889350

Herein, we present an iron (Fe)/calcium (Ca)-based bimetallic oxide, CaFe2O4, which exhibits outstanding OER activity in alkaline media. The OER specific activity of CaFe2O4 is superior to those of previously reported Fe-based bimetallic oxides composed of alkaline-earth or rare-earth metals. Remarkably, it even surpasses that of the benchmark IrO2. Furthermore, the OER performance of CaFe2O4 is stable during repeated potential cycles without any significant current loss. Density functional theory calculations imply that the outstanding OER activity of CaFe2O4 is facilitated by an unconventional mechanism via direct formation of O-O bonds between two oxygen intermediates, which are adsorbed on a multi-iron site on the catalyst surface.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			2574-0962			WOS:000644737800010

However, developing efficient and stable catalysts for the oxygen evolution catalysis remains a great challenge. Here, we successfully activate an inefficient oxygen evolution catalyst using a simple single atom tailoring strategy. The Rh element with its unfilled 4d(8) electron configuration was selected to atomically implant into a Cu oxide matrix, which has a filled 3d(10) electron configuration. The hetero-Rh single atom (SA) migration was achieved by dispersing Cu2O nanocubes in a RhCl3 aqueous solution, enabling an ion exchange process. The activated catalyst (Cu2O-RhSA) exhibited significantly enhanced catalytic activity toward oxygen evolution in alkaline media, surpassing the performance of pristine Cu2O nanocubes and commercial IrO2. A theoretical study further confirmed that the migrated hetero-Rh SAs can tailor the interaction between the Cu and O sites, modulating the electron density distribution on the surface of Cu2O, leading to a more favorable oxygen evolution process.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000679406500081	34184891

Nickel-based selenides have good conductivity and easy to regulate, which make them to be a promising OER electrocatalysts. Hence, many researchers engineering the structure of Nickel-based selenides to further improve the OER performance. In this paper, NixFe(1-x)Se(2)porous-nano-microspheres with different ratio were synthesized. Results confirm that Fe not only affects the number of active sites in NiSe2, but also affects the intrinsic activity by forming lattice defects. Besides, introduction of Fe can change the redox ability of Ni cation and Se anion, thus, reducing the average valence state of Ni cation in NiOOH. As a result, the current density of OER is improved remarkably. When the current density reaches 10 mA cm(-2), the overpotential is only 285 mV.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000578777100001	32918363

Recent studies report that Fe substitution for Ni can significantly enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of LaNiO3. However, the role of Fe in increasing the activity remains ambiguous, with potential origins that are both structural and electronic in nature. On the basis of a series of epitaxial LaNi1-xFexO3 thin films synthesized by molecular beam epitaxy, we report that Fe substitution tunes the Ni oxidation state in LaNi1-xFexO3 and a volcano-like OER trend is observed, with x = 0.375 being the most active. Spectroscopy and ab initio modeling reveal that high-valent Fe3+delta cationic species strongly increase the transition-metal (TM) 3d bandwidth via Ni-O-Fe bridges and enhance TM 3d-O 2p hybridization, boosting the OER activity. These studies deepen our understanding of structural and electronic contributions that give rise to enhanced OER activity in perovskite oxides.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000709549100055	34546060

In this work, we demonstrate the preparation of CoO@FeOOH core-shell nanowire (NWs) grown on three-dimensional (3D) carbon cloth (CC@CoO@FeOOH-NWAs) by hydrothermal method followed by electrodeposition process as well as its highly efficient activity for water oxidation. In this hybrid structure, CoO@FeOOH-NWs with an average diameter of 100 nm is vertically grown on the surface of carbon fibers of the carbon cloth. The combination of CoO@FeOOH catalyst with good electron transfer substrate exhibits exceptionally good electrocatalytic activity and long-term durability towards oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline solution. It needs an overpotential as low as 255 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), with a Tafel slope of 82 mV dec(-1) and also exhibits a good stability in 20 h. In addition, the nanowire array structure is well retained after the durability test with high current density of 50 mA cm(-2). Our strategy provides a guide to rational design of micro-structures of the materials to achieve their high performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, by using nickel-cobalt LDH grown on the conductive nickel foam (NF) skeleton (NiCo LDH/NF), a three-dimensional structure featured with multilayer petals is constructed. Benefiting from the simple and feasible fixed-point laser irradiation, NiCo LDH/NF shows boosted oxygen vacancies, resulting in efficient catalytic activities, with an oxygen evolution reaction overpotential of only 253.31 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a half-wave potential of 0.79 V vs RHE for oxygen reduction reaction. Attractively, rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZABs) using the laser-irradiated NiCo LDH/Ni foam (L-NiCo LDH/NF) as the catalytic electrode display a high peak power value of 126.29 mW cm(-2), surpassing that of commercially grouped Pt/C-IrO2 (88.43 mW cm(-2)). Moreover, the as-obtained L-NiCo LDH/NF also delivers enhanced catalytic activity in hydrogen evolution. Accordingly, the developed ZABs can drive the overall water splitting reaction using L-NiCo LDH/ NF as the electrodes. Meanwhile, the key role of oxygen vacancy in the catalyst was verified by using the calculation based on density functional theory. Therefore, the simple method of laser irradiation is confirmed as a feasible way to boost oxygen vacancies in materials with enabled multifunctional electrocatalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000863537600001

The catalysts stability in an acidic medium is not significantly affected by cerium addition. Moreover, the oxygen mobility in the ceria crystallographic structure may contribute to an enhanced electrocatalytic activity per active site.

Herein, Fe doped Ni3S2/MnS heterostructured nanosheets were grown on Ni foam (Fe-Ni3S2/MnS@NF) via a simple one-step solvothermal reaction. As-synthesized Fe-Ni3S2/MnS@NF exhibits excellent OER electrocatalytic activity in 1 M KOH, with an extremely low overpotential of 259 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) as well as a small Tafel slope (39 mV dec(-1)), much better than Ni3S2-, Fe-doped Ni3S2-, and Ni3S2/MnS-nanosheets grown on NF. Results clearly reveal that the better electrocatalytic performance of Fe-Ni3S2/MnS@NF than its rivals is mainly due to the synergistic effect of Fe-doping and Ni3S2/MnS heterojunctions. In details, heterojunction combination with Fe-doping not only improves the conductivity of catalysts but also modulates the electronic configuration of active sites and optimizes the adsorption capacity of oxygen-containing intermediates, thus achieving rapid reaction kinetics and high electrocatalytic performance.

Comparing the untreated composite (NC-0) with NC-3, the ORR current density is increased from 2.1 mA / cm(2) to 4.2 mA / cm(2) and OER current density is reduced from 13.3 mA / cm(2) to 8.0 mA / cm(2).

In this work, iron (Fe)-doped nickel phosphide (Ni2P) nanosheet arrays supported on nickel foam (Ni1.85Fe0.15P NSAs/NF) are fabricated through a facile hydrothermal method, followed by phosphorization. The electrochemical analysis demonstrates that the Ni1.85Fe0.15P NSAs/NF electrode possesses high electrocatalytic activity for water splitting. In 1.0 M KOH, the Ni1.85Fe0.15P NSAs/NF electrode only needs overpotentials of 106 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 270 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) to drive the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. Furthermore, the assembled two-electrode (Ni1.85Fe0.15P NSAs/NF||Ni1.85Fe0.15P NSAs/NF) alkaline water electrolyzer can produce a current density of 10 mA cm" at 1.61 V. Remarkably, it can maintain stable electrolysis over 20 h. Thus, this work undoubtedly offers a promising electrocatalyst for water splitting.									176	13	0	0	5	0	178			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000407540400037	28714664

Here, we show that the oxygen-oxygen bond in the OOH* intermediate is, however, not well described with the previously used class of exchange-correlation functionals. By quantifying and correcting the systematic error, an improved description of gaseous peroxide species versus experimental data and a reduction in calculational uncertainty is obtained. For adsorbates, we find that the systematic error largely cancels the vdW interaction missing in the original determination of the scaling relation. An improved scaling relation, which is fully independent of the applied exchange-correlation functional, is obtained and found to differ by 0.1 eV from the original. This largely confirms that, although obtained with a method suffering from systematic errors, the previously obtained scaling relation is applicable for predictions of catalytic activity.									92	1	0	0	3	0	93			1932-7447			WOS:000387198400045

The development of MABs has, however, been considerably hampered by its relatively low rate capability and its lack of efficient and stable air catalysts in which the former stems mainly from the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the latter stems from the corrosion/oxidation of carbon materials in the presence of oxygen and high electrode potentials. In this review, various carbon-composited bifunctional electrocatalysts are reviewed to summarize progresses in the enhancement of ORR/OER and durability induced by the synergistic effects between carbon and other component(s). Catalyst mechanisms of the reaction processes and associated performance enhancements as well as technical challenges hindering commercialization are also analyzed. To facilitate further research and development, several research directions for overcoming these challenges are also proposed.									142	15	0	0	8	1	147			2520-8489	2520-8136		WOS:000562856400001

Here, the authors report a facile approach to independently regulate the electronic structure of Fe in Ni0.75Fe0.25Se2 by P doping. The resulting electrode exhibits superior catalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) showing a low overpotential (238 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), 185 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and an impressive durability in an alkaline medium. Additionally, the mass activity of 328.19 A g(-1) and turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.18 s(-1) at an overpotential of 500 mV are obtained for PNi0.75Fe0.25Se2 which is much higher than that of Ni0.75Fe0.25Se2 and RuO2.

J	Zhou, Xin; Dong, Hao; Ren, Ai-Min								Exploring the mechanism of water-splitting reaction in NiOx/beta-Ga2O3 photocatalysts by first-principles calculations								PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS				18	16			11111	11119		10.1039/c5cp07260c				APR 28 2016	2016	Experiments found that loading suitable cocatalysts, usually in the form of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles, on the semiconductor surface can remarkably increase the photocatalytic activity of water-splitting reaction. To get insight into the mechanism of experimental observations, we took a NiOx/beta-Ga2O3 photocatalytic system as a model and performed detailed density functional theory calculations. Electrochemical computational methods are used to investigate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Our results show that in the Ni4O2/beta-Ga2O3 system, the reaction sites of HER are on cluster oxygen atoms and Ni atoms in the Ni-2 cluster. Loading the Ni4O2 cluster on the beta-Ga2O3 surface importantly reduces the reaction free energy of HER. On the clean beta-Ga2O3 surface, water dissociation is energetically unfavorable. After attaching the Ni4O2 cluster to the surface, water decomposition becomes thermodynamically favorable. The favorable reaction sites of OER focus on the Ni4O2 cluster. The rate-determining step of OER can be changed by adsorbing the Ni4O2 cluster. Notable reduction of overpotential (0.87 V) for OER on Ni4O2/Ga2O3 is found compared with that on the clean Ga2O3 surface, which reasonably explains the experimental observation on significant enhancement of activity for generating oxygen after loading NiOx cocatalysts.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000374786300050	27051886

However, for enhancing catalytic activity, suitably engineering the LCAs in catalysts through rational design remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrated self-supporting NiO/Co3O4 hybrids for advanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Contributed to an abundance of heterointerfaces and increased oxygen vacancies at the interfaces, the numerous LCAs were generated in NiO/Co3O4. Consequently, the NiO/Co3O4 heterostructures exhibited an overpotential of only 262 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 58 mV dec(-1). By employing density functional theory calculations, it was determined that the d electrons were effectively regulated. Moreover, the d-band centers of Co near the interface in NiO/Co3O4 were far from the Fermi level, thereby confirming the reduction of the unfavorable strong adsorption to oxo intermediates during the OER process. This study provides an effective approach for the rational construction of hybrid interfaces.									111	2	0	0	8	0	112			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900005

Here, we prepare two series of Ru based codoped catalysts NixCoyRu1-x-yO2 with outstanding OER activity compared with RuO2, one of the state-of-the-art OER catalysts. The molar ratio of case dopants, nickel and cobalt, is regulated from 1:1 to 1:1.5 for the host structure RuO2 as the main variable. The synthesized codoped RuO2 with Co/Ni of 1.5 reflected a Tafel slope of only 32 mV dec(-1), which is appreciably lower than the 64 mV dec(-1) for pure RuO2. The performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicated that the key factor of OER activity for codoped catalysts with different dopant ratio is the oxygen vacancy.									31	1	0	0	0	0	31			2574-0962			WOS:000473116600020

As the electrocatalysts, graphene is more remarkable in electrochemical reactions. Additionally, heteroatoms doping with metal-free materials can obtain unique structure and demonstrate excellent electrocatalytic performance. In this work, we proposed a facile method to prepare bifunctional electrocatalyst which was constructed by nitrogen, sulfur doped graphene (NSG), which demonstrate superior properties with high activity and excellent durability compared with Pt/C and IrO2 for oxygen reduction (OR) and oxygen evolution (OE) reactions. Accordingly, these phenomena are closely related to the synergistic effect of doping with nitrogen and sulfur by rationally regulating the polarity of carbon in graphene. The current work expands the method towards carbon materials with heteroatom dopants for commercialization in energy-related reactions.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2073-4344			WOS:000448543300071

Herein, we report that an octahedral metal organic cage (MOC) with stress was directionally transformed into two-dimensional nanoarrays maintaining the structure of precursor and new soluble low-nuclear complexes during the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The in-situ gener-ated miscible electrocatalyst exhibits an overpotential as low as 197 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), with a high elec-trochemical stability up to 5 h. Notably, the miscible catalyst can be used as bifunctional electrocatalyst for OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and exhibits an ultra-low overpotential of 293 mV, even achieve overall water splitting under the voltage provided by a 1.5 V AA battery. As revealed by density functional theory simulations, the position of SO42- in MOC heterogeneous catalyst is regulated by the soluble low-nuclear complexes to reduce the activation energy of the reaction, leading to an optimization of the OER activity for the reaction system.

This calls for an understanding of the nature of the active OER sites and reaction intermediates, which are still being debated. In this work, we apply synchrotron radiation-based near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron and absorption spectroscopies under operando conditions in order to unveil the nature of the reaction intermediates and shed light on the OER mechanism on electrocatalysts most widely used in PEM electrolyzers-electrochemical and thermal iridium oxides. Analysis of the O K-edge and Ir 4f spectra backed by density functional calculations reveals a universal oxygen anion red-ox mechanism regardless of the nature (electrochemical or thermal) of the iridium oxide. The formation of molecular oxygen is considered to occur through a chemical step from the electrophilic O1- species, which itself is formed in an electrochemical step.									89	3	0	0	3	0	90			1948-7185			WOS:000435026100069	29775319

Furthermore, the review describes the activity of different LDH derived materials along with brief explanation of reaction mechanisms and important parameters relating to electrocat-alytic water splitting. Moreover, a comprehensive literature overview highlighting recent achievements on LDH and derived electrocatalysts towards HER, OER and OWS performance is also discussed in details.

However, the rational design of high-performance and stable catalysts to drive this reaction remains a formidable challenge. Here, a facile ink-assisted strategy to construct a series of stable and advanced composite electrocatalysts with single Fe sites for permitting seriously improved performance characteristics is reported. As revealed by a suit of characterization techniques and theoretical methods, the improved electrocatalytic performance and stability can be attributed to the unique coordination states of Fe in the form of distorted Fe-O-4-C and the interfacial effect in the composite system that optimize and stabilize single Fe sites in changing to better configurations for intermediates adsorption. The findings provide a novel strategy to in-depth understanding of practical guidelines for the electrocatalyst design for energy conversion devices.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000594279500001	33258294

Here, we report an Ir-Ni binary oxide electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) fabricated by acid leaching of Ni from Ni-rich composite oxides prepared using pyrolysis method. This Ni-leached binary oxide possesses Ir-enriched surface, porous morphology, and rutile phase structure of IrO2 with contracted lattice. In contrast, Ir-Ni binary oxide with the same composition prepared using simple pyrolysis method exhibits a rod-like aggregated morphology with Ni-enriched surface. Catalytic activity for OER of the Ni-leached binary oxide is higher than that of the pyrolyzed Ir-Ni oxide and pure IrO2. More importantly, the Ni-leached binary oxide exhibits much superior durability during continuous oxygen evolution process under a constant potential of 1.6 V compared with the pyrolyzed binary oxide and pure IrO2. Attributed to the Ir-rich surface and the anchor effect of inner Ni atoms to outer Ir atoms, the Ni-leached binary oxide shows a possibility of reducing the demand of the expensive and scarce Ir in OER electrocatalyst for acidic water splitting.

However, the OER performance of CoSe2 is obviously limited by unexposed active sites. Herein, a FeSe2/CoSe2 heterostructure electrocatalyst is designed to increase the active sites of CoSe2 and shows an excellent electrocatalytic OER performance with an overpotential of 344 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 42 mV dec(-1), and an excellent stability of 60 h. The superior OER performance is ascribed to the electronic structure modulation of CoSe2 and the larger electrochemical surface area, which effectively increases the active sites for OER. This work provides a feasible way to prepare heterojunction electrocatalysts and enriches the OER electrocatalytic applications of transition metal-based selenides.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000716670200001

A unique heterostructure, a distorted inverse spinel Ni-Co-O layer on MoS2 plate, was developed in this paper. The formation of Mo-O-Co covalent bonds at the interface allows for the inherent electron transfer from MoS2 to the adjacent surface spinel and forces the nucleation and creation of disordered inverse spinel. Such a crystal-distorted structure enables the substantially improved activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by more than 40 times and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by 2.5 times compared to the regular spinel nickel cobaltite. Through a comprehensive kinetics study, the results reveal that this inverse spinel layer promotes the water dissociation process and the intrinsic HER activity by decreasing the apparent activation energy barrier E-a, increasing the exchange current density j(0), and improving the charge-transfer rate. Meanwhile, the oxygen vacancy-mediated Ni3+ active center and the facilitated charge transfer are responsible for OER activity improvement. Such a unique heterostructure demonstrates robust stability for HER, OER, and overall water splitting in alkaline electrolytes. Our work provides a novel concept to design effective metal oxide-based HER and OER catalysts in alkaline electrolyte.									30	1	0	0	6	0	30			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000487859200053

Electrodes of the material were formed on pretreated Ni-support by oxide slurry painting technique and studied their electrochemical behavior with regards to oxygen evolution reaction ( OER) in aqueous KOH solution. The electrochemical characterization was done in three electrode single compartment glass cell using Gamry ( Reference 600) Electrochemical Work Station. Techniques used for electrochemical studies were cyclic voltammetry and Tafel polarization. The data showed that the substitution of Sr ( 0.2 -0.8 mol) increased the electrocatalytic activity of the oxide. The value was found to be highest with 0.8 mol Sr. The Tafel slopes and reaction order with respect to OH-concentration for oxygen evolution reaction were found to be 65-77 mVdecade(-1) and unity, respectively. The cyclic voltammogram recorded between 0.0 -0.7 V in 1M KOH at 25 degrees C exhibited a pair of redox peaks prior to oxygen evolution reaction. The thermodynamic parameters for oxygen evolution reaction such as, standard electrochemical enthalpy of activation (Delta H-el(0#)), standard enthalpy of activation (Delta H-0#), and standard entropy of activation (Delta S-0#) have also been calculated by recording the Tafel polarization curve in 1 M KOH at different temperatures. Oxide samples were characterized physicochemically by scanning electron microscope ( SEM) powder X-ray diffraction ( XRD) techniques.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1452-3981			WOS:000384909300045

Recently, increasing evidence obtained by operando characterization techniques reveal that the structural evolution of catalysts caused by the interplay with electric fields, electrolytes and reactants/intermediates brings about the formation of real active sites. Hence, it is time to summarize structural evolution related research advances and envisage future developments. In this Minireview, we first introduce the fundamental concepts associated with structural evolution (e.g., catalysts, active sites/centers and stability/lifetime) and their relevance. Then, the multiple triggers of structural evolution and advanced operando characterizations are discussed. Significantly, a brief overview of structural evolution and its reversibility in heterogeneous electrocatalysis is provided, especially for the representative electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) processes. Lastly, key challenges and opportunities in this exciting field are highlighted.									61	0	0	0	1	0	61			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000744973000001	34490688

Introduction of F in perovskite lattice initiated the transition of Co(III) and Fe(III) species to lower oxidation states and triggered the surface O anion to be activated to highly oxidative O2-/O-, which is deemed to be efficient active sites for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis. As a consequence, the F substituted BSCF (F-BSCF) catalyst exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity with overpotential of only 280 mV to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) OER, which is among the results for state-of-the-art metal oxide based catalysts. Strikingly, an stable chronoamperometric response prolonged for 100 h and an impressive cycling stability demonstrate its prominent durability, much superior to the commercial IrO2 catalyst. These findings highlight the promising potential of F substitution as an efficient strategy for active site engineering in traditional precious metal-free OER electrocatalysts.									56	2	0	0	2	0	55			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000483451200057

In this paper, core-shell structural carbon materials composed of nitrogen-doped carbon-shell-encapsulated iron-cobalt mixed metal carbides were obtained through pyrolysis of metal organic framework precursors. Metallic (Co, Fe) carbide nanoclusters embedded in nitrogen-doped hollow carbon spheres were obtained after most of the mixed metal cores were removed by heated acid etching. The composites of carbon materials exhibited significant electrocatalytic activities toward the hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions. Hollow carbon spheres were obtained under optimized conditions for the hydrogen evolution reaction with overpotentials of 180 mV at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 90 mV.dec(-1 )in acidic media. The hollow carbon spheres also exhibited favorable activities toward oxygen reduction with a rather high half-wave potential of 0.82 V (vs RHE), high methanol tolerance, and robust stability. These excellent performances demonstrated their potential for applications in fuel cells, some metal-air batteries, and water splitting devices.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2168-0485			WOS:000467351200078

However, the oxygen vacancies can be easily renovated by the adsorbed water and oxygen, then deactivating the catalysts. Herein, we synthesized a nanoflower BiOBr, which could produce continuously sufficient OVs induced by light during the photocatalytic water splitting, and investigated the effect of OVs concentration on the performance of photocatalytic O-2 evolution. The results showed that the sustainable light-induced OVs could improve the transfer efficiency of photoinduced carriers and the light absorption capacity, which then cause a significant increase in reaction rates. The optimal oxygen evolution rate could reach 166 mu mol.g(-1).h(-1). This work provides a new way of constructing sustainable oxygen vacancies on the surface of catalysts toward photocatalytic water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0167-577X	1873-4979		WOS:000832888000003

XPS analysis shows the CuCo2O4@CQDs possesses the Co(II)-rich surface associated with the oxygen vacancies, which can effectively boost the Faradaic reactions and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. For example, the as-synthesized 3D porous CuCo2O4@CQDs electrode exhibits high activity toward overall electrochemical water splitting, for example, an overpotential of 290 mV for OER and 331 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media have been achieved at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) (CuCo2O4@CQDs//CNTs) delivers a high energy density of 45.9 Wh kg(-1) at 763.4 W kg(-1), as well as good cycling ability. The synergy of Co(II)-rich surface, oxygen vacancies, and well-defined 3D hollow structures facilitates the subsequent surface electrochemical reactions.

The optimized catalyst exhibits high performances for both ORR and OER processes in alkali media, with oxygen electrode activities which outperform benchmark platinum-based catalysts.

Herein, we propose a promising stable CeNiFeOx electrocatalyst for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER&HER) by a facile one-pot combustion synthesis. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results indicate that both nickel and iron ions are successfully incorporated into ceria lattices to form a pure fluorite phase of CeNiFeOx nanopowders, indicating a new achievement of as high as 20% of Ni/Fe solubility in the ceria lattice for the first time. The electrochemical measurements indicate that CeNiFeOx exhibits the high OER activity of NiFeOx electrocatalyst and the enhanced sta-bility of oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. The Ce0.8Ni0.15Fe0.05Ox with a single phase of cubic fluorite structure among all shows the most efficient activity with the overpotential of 325 mV for OER and 337 mV for HER at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH than the pure CeOx, NiFeOx and other CeNiFeOx nanoelectrocatalysts. After 1000 cycles, the Ce0.8Ni0.15Fe0.05Ox nano electrocatalyst exhibits the remarkably improved stability for OER compared to NiFeOx electrocatalyst. These findings demonstrate a facile approach to develop high-active and durable electrocatalysts under alkaline conditions for overall water splitting. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

However, the structure of active centers in bimetallic/multimetallic catalysts is under long-time debate in the catalysis community. Here, an efficient bimetallic Ni-Fe selenide-derived OER electrocatalyst is reported and the structure-activity correlation during the OER evolution studied. By combining experiments and theoretical calculations, a conceptual advance is provided, in that the local coordination structure distortion and disordering of active sites inherited from the pre-catalyst and post-formed by a further reconstruction are responsible for boosting the OER performance. The active center is identified on Ni sites showing moderate bindings with oxygenous intermediates rather than Fe sites with strong and poisonous adsorptions. These findings provide crucial understanding in manipulating the local coordination and electronic structures toward rational design and fabrication of efficient OER electrocatalysts.									51	0	0	0	6	0	50			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000686917000001	34418171

Despite these advantages, a fundamental understanding of how critical structural parameters of perovskite electrocatalysts influence their activity and stability is lacking. Here, we investigate the impact of structural defects on OER performance for representative LaNiO3 perovskite electrocatalysts. Hydrogen reduction of 700 degrees C calcined LaNiO3 induces a high density of surface oxygen vacancies, and confers significantly enhanced OER activity and stability compared to unreduced LaNiO3; the former exhibit a low onset overpotential of 380 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 70.8 mV dec(-1). Oxygen vacancy formation is accompanied by mixed Ni2+/Ni3+ valence states, which quantum-chemical DFT calculations reveal modify the perovskite electronic structure. Further, it reveals that the formation of oxygen vacancies is thermodynamically more favourable on the surface than in the bulk; it increases the electronic conductivity of reduced LaNiO3 in accordance with the enhanced OER activity that is observed.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000701239300001	34486173

In this work, NiFe-layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDHs) are grown on the bimetallic (Ni and Co) embedded carbon nanotubes to get efficient catalysts for excellent OER performance, in which 267 mV is required to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution without iR-compensation. The formation of carbon nanotubes significantly enhances the conductivity and alleviates the agglomeration of NiFe-LDHs, meanwhile, the bimetallic carbon substrate/nanotube is employed as a bridge to drive electrons transfer to NiFe-LDHs. The redistribution of electrons makes NiFe-LDHs in an electron-rich situation. The regulation of the electronic situation adjusts the bonding strength between the active sites and oxygen intermediates to promote the deprotonation process.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000850364700008

Using a novel interplay of cyclic voltammetry (CV) for electrochemistry integrated with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on an atomically defined cobalt oxide/Au(111) system, we reveal here that the supporting gold substrate uniquely favors a flexible cobalt-oxyhydroxide/Au interface in the electrochemically active potential window and thus suppresses the formation of less active bulk cobalt oxide morphologies. The findings substantiate why optimum catalytic synergy is obtained for oxide coverages on gold close to or below one monolayer, and provide the first morphological description of the active phase during electrocatalysis.									62	2	0	0	5	0	63			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000443675700005	29981264

Herein, a novel bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst is reported with the preparation of a zeolite imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) derived trimetallic composites decorated nitrogen-doped carbon, which consist of NiFe alloy and Co nanoparticles. The ZIF-derived porous N-doped carbon shell can speed up the mass transfer efficiency. Whereas the electronic effect between the formed NiFe alloy and Co nanoparticles, as well as the N-doped carbon framework can enrich the active centers and enhance the electrical conductivity. As a result, the NiFe-Co@NC-450 catalyst shows superior performance manifested as a small potential gap (Delta E = 0.857 V) between the overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) (E (j=10)) for OER (460 mV) and half-wave potential (E (1/2)) for ORR (0.833 V). The liquid ZABs exhibit a high specific capacity reaching 798 mAh/g(Zn) and a stable cycling performance at 10 mA cm(-2) for more than 200 h. Meanwhile, the NiFe-Co@NC-450 based flexible ZABs also presents robust flexibility and stability. This study has certain implications for the development of economical, powerful and stable bifunctional catalysts for ZABs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000825861300001	35738190

Carbon dots bridge NiO and Mn2O3 as highly efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for rechargeable zinc-air batteries								Applied Surface Science				596				153642	153642		10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.153642				2022	2022	The development of high-efficiency, low-cost and durable bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts is of great significance for the large-scale application of rechargeable zinc-air batteries. Herein, the carbon dots bridging nickel oxide and manganese trioxide through the oxygen-containing group of carbon dots (NiO-Mn2O3-CDs) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is proposed. The optimal NiO-Mn2O3-CDs yields remarkable electrocatalytic activity with low overpotential (298 mV) to derive the 10 mA.cm-2 for OER and a high half wave potential (0.84 V vs. RHE) for ORR. The outstanding performances are attributed to the CDs covalently bridging Ni and Mn atoms, which reprogram the electronic structure of active sites and enhance charge transfer. Consequently, the rechargeable zinc-air battery test with NiO-Mn2O3-CDs as the air cathode deliver the excellent performances, including a high open voltage (1.51 V), a maximum power density (287 mW.cm-2 @ 0.35 A.cm-2) and robust cycling life, outperforming the commercial Pt/C + IrO2. This work presents an efficient strategy to construct the highly active and stability bifunctional air cathodes for electrochemical energy devices.

As an alternative to scarce and expensive platinum-group-metal (PGM) electrocatalysts, metal nitrogen carbons (MNCs) are emerging as a promising candidate for both aforementioned electrocatalysis where iron and nickel are the metal of choice for ORR and HER, respectively. Therefore, FeNCs and NiNCs were fabricated utilizing inedible pistachio shells as a low-cost biosource of carbon. The steps involved in the fabrication of electrocatalyst were correlated with electrochemical performance in alkaline media. Encouraging onset potential of similar to 0.88 V vs RHE with a possibility of a 2 +2 reaction pathway was observed in pyrolyzed and ball-milled FeNC. However, HF etching for template removal slightly affected the kinetics and eventually resulted in a relatively higher yield of peroxide. In parallel, the pyrolyzed NiNC demonstrated a lower HER overpotential of similar to 0.4 V vs RHE at -10 mA cm(-2). Nevertheless, acid washing adversely affected the HER performance and consequently, very high overpotential was witnessed.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2194-1459	2194-1467		WOS:000824307800001

The acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the main roadblocks that hinder the practical application of PEM water electrolyzers. Highly active, cost-effective, and durable electrocatalysts are indispensable for lowering the high kinetic barrier of OER to achieve boosted reaction kinetics. To date, a wide spectrum of advanced electrocatalysts has been designed and synthesized for enhanced acidic OER performance, though Ir and Ru based nanostructures still represent the state-of-the-art catalysts. In this Progress Report, recent research progress in advanced electrocatalysts for improved acidic OER performance is summarized. First, fundamental understanding about acidic OER including reaction mechanisms and atomic understanding to acidic OER for rational design of efficient electrocatalysts are discussed. Thereafter, an overview of the progress in the design and synthesis of advanced acidic OER electrocatalysts is provided in terms of catalyst category, i.e., metallic nanostructures (Ir and Ru based), precious metal oxides, nonprecious metal oxides, and carbon based nanomaterials. Finally, perspectives to the future development of acidic OER are provided from the aspects of reaction mechanism investigation and more efficient electrocatalyst design.									70	2	0	0	2	0	72			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000630973500001	33749035

OER catalysts of this metaphosphate are prepared by combustion (Cb) and solid-state (SS) methods. The combustion-assisted method offers a facile synthesis and one-step carbon composite formation. Unusually high catalytic activity was observed in NCoM-Cb-Ar and could be due to chemical coupling effects between NaCo(PO3)(3) and partially graphitized carbon. This novel electrocatalyst exhibits very small overpotential of 340mV with high mass activity of 532Ag(-1). Good charge transfer abilities and chemical coupling between NaCo(PO3)(3) and amorphous carbon gives the OER activity in NCoM-Cb-Ar.									50	0	0	0	0	0	50			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000476608700005	30916371

Due to the porous hollow structure and composition, the Fe-NiCo2O4 presented vastly superior electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), compared with NiCo2O4 and the majority of other OER catalysts. With an aim of stimulating a current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2), the Fe-NiCo2O4 catalyst needs an overpotential of 210 mV, which is on a par with the general properties of commercial IrO2. In addition, the Fe-NiCo2O4 catalyst performed stably in long-term testing. The excellent activity and long-term stability showed that such catalysts have great promise for widespread application in the field of water splitting.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2095-025X	2095-0268		WOS:000728433400001

Part 1-Nickel								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE				3	12			1386	1424						DEC 2008	2008	Various aspects of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at passive oxide covered polycrystalline Ni electrodes in aqueous alkaline solution were investigated using electrochemical techniques. Steady state polarisation and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to measure kinetically significant parameters including the Tafel slope and the reaction order with respect to OH-activity. While reproducible values of the Tafel slope were readily observed, the recorded current density at a given applied potential displayed considerable variability over the course of a number of polarisation experiments, rendering difficult the extraction of the experimental reaction order parameter. This problem was resolved by applying relatively mild electrochemical pre-treatment routines to the working electrode. Cyclic voltammetry was used to probe the important issue of the interplay between the nickel oxy-hydroxide surface electrochemistry and the activity of the electrode for the OER. A current transient decay method was employed to estimate the electrode roughness factor. Amongst the mechanistic pathways proposed for the OER in the literature, only two are consistent with the experimental results reported here. The relative merits of these two pathways are discussed and the most likely is identified. The well known Krasil'shchikov mechanism is not suggested.									276	3	0	0	17	0	277			1452-3981			WOS:000265311800005

However, the exact relation between p-d hybridization and electrocatalytic activity is yet to be elucidated due to the lack of selective controllability over hybridization. Here, the electronic structure and electrocatalytic behavior of epitaxial CaRuO3 thin films are studied, to clarify the correlation between hybridization and the oxygen evolution reaction. A decreased hybridization strength between Ru 4d and O 2p states leads to a significant enhancement in the oxygen evolution reaction. A strong hybridization within the CaRuO3 thin film is found to hinder the formation of chemical bonds between the transition metal and adsorbate molecules, thereby decreasing the electrocatalytic efficiency. Our study provides a rigorous correlation between the electrocatalytic activity and electronic structure, taking advantage of the selective hybridization strength control offered by the CaRuO3 system.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2398-4902			WOS:000487670300031

A current density of 10 mA/cm(2) was reached at an overpotential of 364 mV in al. kaline media.

The results show that there existed corrosion and carbon loss on the carbon-polythene current collector in the positive electrode because of oxygen evolution, which made the composite electronic resistivity increase. The graphite felt of the positive electrode obviously suffered from pitting corrosion. It was found that reaction activity of atom oxygen evolved with graphite felt was as high as oxygen's in the air at around 500degC by comparison of the graphite corrosion, which happened under acid treatment and heat-treatment. The hydrogen evolution reaction likely happened on the negative electrode during the battery operation and more number of functional groups -CH2- remaining in the graphite felt of the negative electrode were observed.									0	2	0		0	0	2			1002-087X			INSPEC:10649706

Herein, we report an NH3-activated N-doped hierarchical carbon (NHC) catalyst synthesized via a scalable route, and demonstrate its device integration. The NHC catalyst exhibited good performance for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as demonstrated by means of electrochemical studies and evaluation when integrated into the oxygen electrode of a regenerative fuel cell. The activities observed for both the ORR and the OER were comparable to those achieved by state-of-the-art Pt and Ir catalysts in alkaline environments. We have further identified the critical role of carbon defects as active sites for electrochemical activity through density functional theory calculations and high-resolution TEM visualization. This work highlights the potential of NHC to replace commercial precious metals in regenerative fuel cells and possibly metal-air batteries for cost-effective storage of intermittent renewable energy.									55	3	0	0	3	0	57			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000398382300005

Herein, we report a series of bifunctional Co3V2O8-T (T = temperature/degrees C) electrocatalysts by using Co-carbon electrospun nanofiber as a template, followed by a one-step calcination process. As expected, the developed Co3V2O8-400 nanofiber electrocatalyst shows a very small Tafel slope of 43 and 63 mV dec(-1) for the ORR and OER in the alkaline solution, respectively. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the metallic conductivity and interface V-Co interaction of Co3V2O8-400 nanofiber boost ORR and OER electrocatalytic reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0167-577X	1873-4979		WOS:000836779500007

Graphene-like germanium carbide (g-GeC) is a new candidate in the field of electrocatalysis due to its stable structure, high specific surface, and adjustable electronic properties. In this work, we systematically studied the electrocatalytic activities to-wards ORR, OER, and HER of the 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metal atom doped g-GeC (M-GeC). According to the scaling relations between binding energies of *OOH and *O as the function of *OH binding strength, conclusion can be made that M-GeC with strong binding strength of *OH tend to show strong binding strength of *O and *OOH. For ORR, the calculated overpotentials show that the catalytic activity of g-GeC is effectively improved after the introduction of Ag and Au, and the eta(ORR) values of Ag-GeC and Au-GeC are 0.44 and 0.46 V, respectively. For OER, Pd-GeC and Ni-GeC are determined as highly active catalysts with low eta(OER) values of 0.41 and 0.55 V, respectively. For HER, the Delta G(*H) value of Mn-GeC is calculated as-0.04 eV, which is very close to the optimal value of 0 eV.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000707064700003

Firstly, precursor ZIFs are rationally designed with a blend of volatile zinc to induce porosity and stable cobalt to induce graphitic domains. Secondly, the self-modulated cobalt-nitrogen-carbon system (SCNCS) is shown to be an effective ORR catalyst after graphitization at mild temperatures. Finally, the best OER catalyst is developed by enhancing graphitization of the SCNCS. For the first time, solely by switching the graphitization conditions of SCNCS, excellent ORR or OER performance is realized. This approach not only opens up a simple protocol for simultaneous optimization of nitrogen doping and graphitization at controlled cobalt concentrations, but also provide a facile method of developing such active catalysts without the use of extensive synthesis procedures.									234	5	0	0	10	0	236			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000375699500009

In this paper, high-performance bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts of well-designed Ni, Cu, Co-based mixed sulfides, which combine two highly active thiospinels of NiCu2S4 and CuCo2S4, have been prepared successfully through solvothermal reaction, calcination, and the following sulfiirization. The products of Ni, Cu, Co-based mixed sulfides present unique hollow structures with mesopores, in which several nano particles-assembled hollow nanospheres of 30-50 nm in thickness are nested one by one, forming multishell morphologies. Benefiting from the synergistic effect from combined NiCu2S4 and CuCo2S4 and the well-designed hollow structures with large electroactive surfaces/interfaces and efficient mass transportation, the obtained Ni, Cu, Co-based mixed sulfides exhibit remarkable electrocatalytic activities and excellent long-term durability toward not only oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) but also oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Regarding the overall oxygen-based electrocatalytic performance, the mixed sulfides present an extremely low potential difference (0.73 V) between the ORR and OER in KOH electrolyte, delivering significant superiority to their oxide counterparts and the commercial catalyst of Pt/C, as well as most of the oxygen bicatalysts reported recently. Therefore, the obtained Ni, Cu, Co-based mixed sulfides hold great promise as low-cost bifunctional catalysts with high efficiency for oxygen-based advanced energy storage systems.									22	1	0	0	2	0	23				2574-0970		WOS:000483440400027

Among them, proton exchange membrane (PEM)-based devices exhibit a series of advantages, such as excellent proton conductivity, high durability, and good mechanical strength, and have attracted global interest as a green energy device for transport and stationary sectors. Nevertheless, with a view to rapid commercialization, it is urgent to develop highly active and acid-stable OER catalysts for PEM-based devices. In this Review, based on the recent advances in theoretical calculation and in situ/operando characterization, the OER mechanism in acidic conditions is first discussed in detail. Subsequently, recent advances in the development of several types of acid-stable OER catalysts, including noble metals, non-noble metals, and even metal-free OER materials, are systematically summarized.

The optimized porous electrode shows the overpotential of 1.537 V (eta = 307 mV) vs. RHE for the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M NaOH solution. Comparatively, the porous Ni-Co alloy electrode exhibits a better performance than the other morphologies obtained in this study. Owing to its highly active surface area with porous structures, it promotes the molecular oxygen evolution reaction.									30	0	0	0	1	0	30			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000398999000019	28261728

To achieve the massive application of hydrogen energy and mass-scale hydrogen production from water splitting drives the pursuit of competent precious-metal-free electrocatalysts in acidic media, where the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is more facilitated. However, the development of high-efficient and acid-stable OER electrocatalysts, which are robust to function stably at high oxidation potentials in the acidic electrolyte, remains a great challenge. This article contributes a focused, perceptive review of the up-to-date approaches toward this emerging research field. The OER reaction mechanism and fundamental requirements for oxygen evolution electrocatalysts in acid are introduced. Then the progress and new discoveries of precious-metal-free active materials and design concepts with regard to the improvement of the intrinsic OER activity are discussed. Finally, the existing scientific challenges and the outlooks for future research directions to the fabrication of emerging, earth-abundant OER electrocatalysts in acid are pointed out.

The sides of these nanorods were terminated with low-index surfaces such as (003), while the tips were terminated largely with high-index surfaces such as (104), as revealed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Electron energy loss spectroscopy demonstrated that low-spin Co3+ prevailed on the sides, while the tips exhibited predominantly high- or intermediate-spin Co3+. We correlated the electronic and atomic structure to higher specific ORR and OER activities at the tips as compared to the sides, which was accompanied by more facile redox of Co2+/3+ and higher charge transferred per unit area. These findings highlight the critical role of surface terminations and electronic structures of transition-metal oxides on the ORR and OER activity.									50	1	0	0	3	0	50			1948-7185			WOS:000353250500010	26263135

Perovskite oxides represent one category of efficient catalysts for the OER, among which Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) has been extensively studied. In this work, we discussed the effect of synthesis approaches on the OER performance of BSCF. Three routes, including solution combustion, sol-gel process and solid-state reaction, were applied to synthesize the bulk-sized BSCF perovskites, denoted as BSCF-SC, BSCF-SG and BSCF-SS, respectively. Electrochemical measurements revealed varied OER performance, with BSCF-SS showing the highest intrinsic activity much better than that of BSCF-SC and BSCF-SG. The activity difference may originate from the variation in the surface oxidation states of the B-site cobalt cations. Moreover, all the BSCF perovskites exhibited comparably good stability in catalyzing the OER. In light of the simplicity, the viability for scale-up and the high activity of BSCF-SS, solid-state reaction may be a suitable way for fabricating highly-active BSCF electrocatalyst. This study could provide new insight into enhanced oxygen evolution on perovskite oxides by selecting an optimized synthesis approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction was performed for the first time using pyridine-functionalized NHC gold(I) binuclear metallacycles (8 and 9) possessing aptly designed ligand field. Complexes were prepared by the transmetallation of corresponding silver(I) NHC complexes, which were prepared by in situ deprotonation of pyridine and aryl substituted 1,2,4-triazolium hexafluorophosphate salts (6 and 7) with Ag2O under dark. Both triazolium salts and binuclear gold(I) metallacycles were thoroughly characterised by NMR and ATR-IR spectral and elemental analyses. A bromide salt 4 and a binuclear gold complex 9 were elucidated for structure by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Complex 9 possesses distorted linear coordination geometry around the gold atoms by the coordination of carbene carbon and pyridine nitrogen atoms bearing close Au-Au interaction (3.251 angstrom). The binuclear gold complexes 8 and 9 (along with 10 wt% conductive mesoporous carbon) were investigated as molecular electrocatalysts in oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which evidenced an oxygen evolution overpotential of 2.422 and 2.370 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), respectively, to attain a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2). The Tafel slope values of 40.9 and 30.4 mV dec(-1) for 8 and 9, respectively, indicate the reaction mechanism involved and the suitability of these complexes as apt electrocatalysts for OER. The stability of the prepared molecular electrocatalysts was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry techniques.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0268-2605	1099-0739		WOS:000835436600001

Optimizing their morphologies is an efficient strategy to enhance the electroactivity and durability of various electrocatalysts for practical application. Herein, porous cobalt carbonate hydroxide nanospheres (CoCO3 PNSs) are successfully synthesized by using calcium carbonate (CaCO3) nanospheres as a reaction precursor and self-template via a facile precipitation transformation method. Mainly, the solubility constant [K-sp (CoCO3) = 1.4 x 10(-13)] of CoCO3 is much lower than that [K-sp (CaCO3) = 2.8 x 10(-91) of CaCO3, resulting in the successful transformation of CaCO3 nanospheres to CoCO3 PNSs. Physical characterizations reveal that CoCO3 PNSs consist of many tiny subnanorods (length of 50 nm, diameter of 5 nm), which have a high surface area and abundant channels between subnanorods.

Currently, the role of the metal centre and local coordination environment on the ORR/OER activity of metal SACs remains unclear. Herein, we employed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to systematically study oxygen electrocatalysis on 60 different 3d transition metal SACs (scandium to zinc, supported on heteroatom-doped graphene supports), encompassing three symmetric nitrogen coordination configurations (i.e., M-Nn-C, n = 4, 3, 2) and three asymmetric coordination configurations (i.e., M-N3X-C, X = P, S, B). The calculations reveal the central metal and the coordinating atoms strongly influence oxygen electrocatalysis over 3d transition metal SACs, predominantly by tuning the adsorption free energy of adsorbed hydroxyl (Delta G*OH, a key descriptor of both ORR and OER activity). Dual limiting potential volcano curves were constructed for ORR and OER, with Ni-N2-C identified as the optimal synthetic target for bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysis, closely followed by Fe-N4-C, Co-N4-C, Co-N2-C, and Ni-N3P-C.									21	1	0	0	3	0	21			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000718304900003

While regulating the electronic occupation at metal active site via surface reconstruction in perovskite oxides have been reported to improve the OER activity, but which is facing a challenging task into accelerating the sluggish reaction kinetics. In this work, we take a double perovskite oxide interface as a model to enhance OER performance through a neighboring atomic orbital hybridization, in which the electronic occupation statue at interfacial metal active sites can be reconfigured by a stronger electron-electron exchange interaction. As a result, our proposed neighboring exchange interaction strategy at double perovskite oxide interface demonstrates a high activity of 100 mA cm-2 with an overpotential of ~0.33 V. Our findings can be used to broaden the critical applications in green energy and environment.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000791148700003

Benefiting from the excellent HER performance and outstanding OER activity, the Co-P/Co-N-C/NPC delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting at a cell voltage of 1.59 V, which is comparable with the IrO2-Pt/C couple electrode.									34	3	0	0	1	0	34			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000459321700009	30614224

Here, three dimensional nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) nanosheet arrays are in-situ fabricated on self-supporting nitrogen doped graphited foam (NGF) via a one-step hydrothermal process under an optimized amount of urea. The as prepared NiFe LDH/NGF electrode exhibits a remarkable activity toward OER with a low onset overpotential of 233 mV and a Tafel slope of 59.4 mV dec(-1) as well as a long-term durability.

Here, the MO-Co@ N-doped carbon (NC, M = Zn or Co) is developed as a highly active ORR/OER bifunctional catalyst via pyrolysis of a bimetal metal-organic framework containing Zn and Co, i.e., precursor (CoZn). The vital roles of inactive Zn in developing highly active bifunctional oxygen catalysts are unraveled. When the precursors include Zn, the surface contents of pyridinic N for ORR and the surface contents of Co-N-x and Co3+/Co2+ ratios for OER are enhanced, while the high specific surface areas, high porosity, and high electrochemical active surface areas are also achieved. Furthermore, the synergistic effects between Zn-based and Co-based species can promote the well growth of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) at high pyrolysis temperatures (>= 700 degrees C), which is favorable for charge transfer. The optimized CoZn-NC-700 shows the highly bifunctional ORR/OER activity and the excellent durability during the ORR/OER processes, even better than 20 wt% Pt/C (for ORR) and IrO2 (for OER). CoZn-NC-700 also exhibits the prominent Zn-air battery performance and even outperforms the mixture of 20 wt% Pt/C and IrO2.									285	19	0	0	7	0	288			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000412324200003

The formation of MoOx,-NiO was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). XPS also revealed that the Mo-Ni material contained oxygen vacancies, while transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated that MoOx,-NiO material had sub < 20 nm particle sizes. EDX mapping analysis performed at different electrochemical cycles revealed that the composition (4:1 Mo to Ni) was kept. The Mo-Ni material presented a similar current density than Pt/C during the ORR, displaying a half-wave overpotential of 110 mV. For OER, the Mo-Ni material required 60 mV more energy than a commercial IrO2/C to achieve 10 mA cm(-2), and 170 mV less energy than Pt/C. Additionally, the Mo-Ni material displayed superior durability for both reactions, keeping 92% of its initial current during the ORR after 8 h of operation, and 100% during the OER, being more stable than commercial Pt/C and IrO2/C.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000514827600138

Herein, a triphase electrode was fabricated to address this limitation by immobilizing MoS2 nanosheets on a porous gas diffusion layer (GDL). This electrode shows a superior HER and OER ratio, high current density and stable working state in electrocatalytic water splitting. Moreover, by lowering the pressure behind the GDL, we further improved the water-splitting rate (the current density was three times higher than that of a bare MoS2 diphase electrode at -0.37 V for HER and 1.62 V for OER) and stability by eliminating the appearance of bubbles, even under a current density as high as 100 mA cm(-2). Our work manifests the significance of constructing a triphase system for water splitting, and the system is also available for other gas evolution reactions.									11	2	0	0	1	0	11			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000442614000015	30069564

Electrode catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) play a critical role in the operation of rechargeable zinc-air batteries. Herein, we report a simple and scalable strategy to fabricate porous carbon polyhedra using Zn-doped Co-based zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZnCo-ZIFs) as precursors. Strikingly, Zn doping leads to smaller Co nanoparticles and higher nitrogen content, which in turn enhances the ORR and OER activities of the obtained porous carbon polyhedra. The synergistic effect of the N-doped carbon and cobalt nanoparticles in the composite, the improved conductivity resulting from the high graphitization of carbon, and the large surface area of the porous polyhedral structure resulted in porous carbon polyhedra with excellent ORR and OER electrocatalytic activity in alkaline media. More importantly, air cathodes based on the optimal porous carbon polyhedra further exhibited superior performance to Pt/C catalysts in primary and rechargeable zinc-air batteries.									75	9	0	0	1	0	78			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000419002100011

Commonly, noble metals, which are expensive and less stable, have been used as catalysts for OER due to their high catalytic activity. To replace the noble metal catalyst, 3d transition metal-based materials, which are relatively inexpensive and have adequate catalytic activity, have been widely studied as promising candidates for OER catalysts. However, their moderate OER performance presents an obstacle for practical application. The introduction of oxygen vacancies is an effective way to tune the various properties of catalysts, which, in turn, can enhance the catalytic activity. Here, we manufacture cobalt-based catalysts with high ratios of oxygen vacancy from metalorganic framework (MOF) materials. Depending on the amount of treated-hexamethylenetetramine (HMT), the cobalt-based catalysts exhibit various morphologies, compositions, and ratios of oxygen vacancy. The optimal cobalt-based catalyst (300-h/Co/CC) shows significantly enhanced OER performance with a low overpotential of 280 mV at current density of 10 mA cm-2. This work presents a new approach to synthesize catalysts with high ratios of oxygen vacancy from MOF.									18	1	0	0	0	0	18			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000656780700005

The porous nano-octahedron has a unique heterostructure composed of Mo2N/ MoC/W2N/WC. The representative MoWN/MoWC@N-C-800 showed trifunctional electrocatalytic activity in oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction/hydrogen evolution reaction (ORR/OER/HER) in an alkaline medium (0.1 M KOH). The total oxygen electrode activity index Delta E = 0.795 V (vs. RHE) was found in OER/ORR, and the material also exhibits excellent HER performance. The minimum potential of -0.17 V (vs. RHE) was provided at a current density of -10 mA cm(-2). MoWN/MoWC@N-C-800 showed excellent cycle stability and durability in ORR/OER/HER with the same electrolyte (0.1 M KOH). More importantly, MoWN/MoWC@N-C-800 could be used to construct high-performance zinc-air batteries and sued for driving electrocatalytic water splitting in a self-powered manner.

Highly efficient trifunctional nonprecious electrocatalysts are a critical precious metal replacement for the economically viable electrocatalysis of oxygen reduction and water splitting, both of which are a triphase electrode process. Electrocatalysts with a refined porous structure and active composition beneficial for three-phase reactions are broadly pursued. Herein, a highly promising trifunctional spherical Murray assembly of Co-N-C nanoparticles was derived from low-cost Prussian blue analogues for the oxygen reduction reaction and water splitting. The Murray-type architecture with a tunable porous hierarchy for efficient mass transfer and the combination of a Co-N-C active composition are key for the improved electrocatalytic performance. Acid-leaching produced an optimized Murray-type durable and methanol-tolerant Co-N-C electrocatalyst that achieved an onset potential of 0.94 V [vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)] and a half wave potential of 0.84 V (vs RHE) as well as a large diffusion-limited current density of 5.7 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen reduction reaction, which is comparable to Pt/C. In addition, it displayed low onset overpotentials of similar to 150 and similar to 350 mV corresponding to the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively, highlighting its great potential to be used in overall water splitting with a total splitting voltage of 1.73 V. This work highlights the importance of Murray-type electrocatalysts for multiphase energy-related reactions.									37	2	0	0	1	0	38			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000461538000031	30726678	
J	Kim, Kwanwoo; Kim, Jooheon								Unique designed structure of bimetallic cobalt and nickel oxide nanocages with nitrogen doping as bifunctional catalysts								IONICS				27	2			845	852		10.1007/s11581-020-03829-6		NOV 2020		FEB 2021	2021	Efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are essential to improve the sluggish reaction kinetics during cathodic electrochemical processes. In this study, we successfully developed an open-structure cobalt and nickel bimetallic nanocage (CNBN) by aggregating reduced hydrogen gas. The hollow structures have a catalytic advantage because the inner and outer sites are simultaneously active during the ORR and OER reactions. Moreover, this work demonstrates that the synergy effect exceeds that of simply adding nitrogen (N) such as "ensemble effect." Our nanocages improve the ORR and OER reactions by allowing electron transfer between active metal atoms and doped N atoms. We studied the electrocatalytic activity of CNBN for ORR and OER in alkaline and found CNBN's catalytic effectiveness to be comparable to Pt/C and Ir/C catalysts. This approach can be applied to cathodic catalysts for use in metal-air battery storage devices.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000588927500002

Hydrogen produced via water electrolysis powered by renewable energy systems at a large scale is an essential measure to reduce greenhouse gas and particulate emissions. Electrolysers use a substantial amount of water (mainly freshwater) to produce hydrogen and oxygen at the cathode, and anode, respectively. However, seawater is preferred because it is the most abundant water resource. Although many R&D efforts on seawater electrolysis have been carried out since the 1970s, the barriers are the undesired chlorine gas evolution reaction at the anode, and corrosion induced by chloride ions. Unlike the available data for electrocatalyst materials based upon platinum group metals in pure solutions, limited data is available for electrocatalysts in seawater. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new electrocatalysts for seawater electrolysis.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2451-9103			WOS:000779149300001

BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS				502	2			183	186		10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.05.045				JUL 12 2018	2018	The first life forms evolved in a highly reducing environment. This reduced state is still carried by cells today, which makes the concept of "reductive stress" somewhat redundant. When oxygen became abundant on the Earth, due to the evolution of photosynthesis, life forms had to adapt or become extinct. Living organisms did adapt, proliferated and an explosion of new life forms resulted, using reactive oxygen species (ROS) to drive their evolution. Adaptation to oxygen and its reduction intermediates necessitated the simultaneous evolution of select antioxidant defences, carefully regulated to allow ROS to perform their major roles. Clearly this "oxidative stress" did not cause a major problem to the evolution of complex life forms. Why not? Iron and oxygen share a close relationship in aerobic evolution. Iron is used in proteins to transport oxygen, promote electron transfers, and catalyse chemical reactions. In all of these functions, iron is carefully sequestered within proteins and restricted from reacting with ROS, this sequestration being one of our major antioxidant defences. Iron was abundant to life forms before the appearance of oxygen. However, oxygen caused its oxidative precipitation from solution and thereby decreased its bioavailability and thus the risk of iron-dependent oxidative damage. Microorganisms had to adapt and develop strategies involving siderophores to acquire iron from the environment and eventually their host. This battle for iron between bacteria and animal hosts continues today, and is a much greater daily threat to our survival than "oxidative stress" and "redox stress". (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Here we show that H2O2 can be generated rapidly via a reaction between pyrite and H2O in the absence of dissolved oxygen. The reaction proceeds in the dark, and H2O2 levels increase upon illumination with visible light. Since pyrite was stable in most photic environments prior to the rise of O-2 levels, this finding represents an important mechanism for the formation of H2O2 on early Earth.									109	3	0	0	55	0	114			1531-1074	1557-8070		WOS:000209363100003	12448991

Electrocatalysts are vital to these devices that perform water electrolysis, CO2 electrochemical reduction, and fuel cell reactions, but they are often based on expensive and scarce platinum group metals (PGMs). In this Perspective, we summarize the potential applications of low-cost transition metal carbides (TMCs) to optimize hydrogen evolution/oxidation reactions, oxygen evolution/reduction reactions, CO2 electrochemical reduction, and alcohol oxidation reactions. The most recent advances in understanding the activity and stability of TMC electrocatalysts for each reaction are highlighted. Promising research directions are provided for both fundamental studies on model surfaces and the development of industrially relevant high-surface-area electrocatalysts. The potential applications of TMCs are presented within the context of the global energy trends that are currently driving the growth of energy storage and conversion devices.									74	6	0	0	5	0	75			2542-4351			WOS:000425180300011

Herein, iron-nickel/carbon nanotube composites are synthesized as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting. The catalyst is homogeneously distributed, while the formation of iron-nickel alloy is confirmed. Because of the synergism of iron and copper and the contribution of carbon nanotubes, the Fe-Ni/CNT electrocatalyst shows excellent oxygen evolution reaction performance with the overpotential of 221 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and maintains stable at 0.48 V for 150 h. It expedites overall water splitting at 10 mA cm(-2) with 1.50 V and show excellent stability at 20 mA cm(-2) for 65 h, providing great potential for large-scale applications.

Currently, both half-reactions in water splitting depend heavily on noble metal catalysts. This review discusses the proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis (WE) and the progress in replacing the noble-metal catalysts with earth-abundant ones. The efforts within this field for the discovery of efficient and stable earth-abundant catalysts (EACs) have increased exponentially the last few years. The development of EACs for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media is particularly important, as the only stable and efficient catalysts until now are noble-metal oxides, such as IrOx and RuOx. On the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) side, there is significant progress on EACs under acidic conditions, but there are very few reports of these EACs employed in full PEM WE cells. These two main issues are reviewed, and we conclude with prospects for innovation in EACs for the OER in acidic environments, as well as with a critical assessment of the few full PEM WE cells assembled with EACs.									27	1	0	0	0	0	27				2073-4344		WOS:000454711500089

Decoupled Water Splitting: From Basic Science to Application [arXiv]								arXiv								73 pp.	73 pp.						27 July 2020	2020	In this review, we discuss disruptive decoupled water splitting schemes, in which the concurrent production of hydrogen and oxygen in close proximity to each other in conventional electrolysis is replaced by time- or space-separated hydrogen and oxygen production steps. We present the main decoupling strategies, including electrolytic and electrochemical chemical water splitting cycles, and the redox materials that facilitate them by mediating the ion exchange between the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions.

The intrinsic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of as-prepared perovskite oxides in aqueous electrolyte are examined on a rotating disk electrode (RDE) set up. Li air primary batteries on the basis of Mg-doped perovskite oxides LaNi1-xMgxO3 (x = 0, 0.08, 0.15) and nonaqueous electrolyte are also fabricated and tested. In terms of the ORR current densities and OER current densities, the performance is enhanced in the order of LaNiO3, LaNi0.92Mg0.08O3 and LaNi0.85Mg0.15O3. Most notably, partially substituting nickel with magnesium suppresses formation of Ni2+ and ensures high concentration of both OER and ORR reaction energy favorable Ni3+ (eg = 1) on the surface of perovskite catalysts. Nonaqueous Li air primary battery using LaNi0.92Mg0.08O3 and LaNi0.85Mg0.15O3 as the cathode catalysts exhibit improved performances compared with LaNiO3 catalyst, which are consistent with the ORR current densities.

Here we develop an energy-efficient, cost-effective, scaled-up corrosion engineering method for transforming inexpensive iron substrates (e.g., iron plate and iron foam) into highly active and ultrastable electrodes for oxygen evolution reaction. This synthetic method is achieved via a desired corrosion reaction of iron substrates with oxygen in aqueous solutions containing divalent cations (e.g., nickel) at ambient temperature. This process results in the growth on iron substrates of thin film nanosheet arrays that consist of iron-containing layered double hydroxides, instead of rust. This inexpensive and simple manufacturing technique affords iron-substrate-derived electrodes possessing excellent catalytic activities and activity retention for over 6000 hours at 1000 mA cm(-2) current densities.									297	21	0	0	17	0	300			2041-1723			WOS:000437252300009	29973591

It is found that gold nanoparticles with 15.3 nm average grain diameter are loaded on graphitic carbon nitride sheets forming a desirable plasmonic-metal/semiconductor structure. Under visible light illumination, the gold-graphitic carbon nitride catalyst exhibits a superior oxygen evolution reaction performance in alkaline electrolyte including a lower overpotential of 400mV (10 mAcm(-2) catalytic current density) and a smaller Tafel slope of 53 mV dec(-1). And furthermore, the catalyst shows good stability. The improved oxygen evolution reaction property can be attributed to the synergistic effect between graphitic carbon nitride sheet and the gold nanoparticles under simulated sunlight illumination, including the photoelectric effect of graphitic carbon nitride sheet, the diffusion current drifting effect caused by the built-in electric field residing in the Schottky barrier zone (between the graphitic carbon nitride sheet and the gold nanoparticles), and most important, the surface plasmon resonance induced hot-electrons injection effect from plasmonic gold nanoparticles.

The light intensity (I(r)) at which oxygen uptake began to increase with increasing light intensity depended on the growth irradiance of the culture. In each case, I(r) coincided with the minimum light intensity for saturation Of carbon assimilation (I(k)). At irradiances >I(r), net oxygen evolution rates paralleled carbon assimilation rates. Oxygen uptake at high light intensities was inhibited by DCMU, indicating that oxygen uptake was due to Mehler reaction activity. The onset of Mehler activity at I(k) supports the idea that oxygen becomes an alternative sink for electrons from photosystem I when NADPH turnover is limited by the capacity of the dark reactions to utilize reductant.									66	0	0	0	54	0	66			0022-3646	1529-8817		WOS:A1992HZ75500006

Herein, a three-dimensional (3D)-networked heterogeneous electrocatalyst in the form of vertically aligned NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoflakes coupled with Fe-doped NiSx nanoparticles is supported on biomass-derived carbon microtubes (CMT). The optimal hybrid electrode exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity with low overpotentials of 210 and 157 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1 M KOH, respectively. It is revealed that the remarkable features of the catalyst lie in the unique 3D open configuration, the high conductivity of CMT support and the strong interfacial coupling effects between NiFe LDH and (NiFe)S-x, giving rise to enhanced active sites, accelerating electron/ion transport, and further promoting reaction kinetics of OER/HER. Furthermore, an alkaline water electrolyzer is constructed with the NiFe LDH/(NiFe)S-x/CMT composite as catalyst for both anode and cathode. This electrolyzer displays excellent electrolysis performance (affording 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.53 V) and long-term durability over 100 h. This work demonstrates a strategy in preparing bifunctional and cost-efficient electrocatalysts with potential application in the future. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Transitional metal sulfides (TMSs) have gained great research interest owing to their high intrinsic catalytic activity, adjustable electronic structures, and various crystal structures and phases. Meanwhile, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are ideal precursors for the preparation of TMSs due to the diverse metal nodes, organic ligands, topologies, and morphologies of MOFs. In addition, MOFs could act as hosts for the incorporation of guest molecules, which could further expand the metal types of TMSs. In this review, the recent progress of MOF-derived TMS electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs), oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) are summarized. After a brief introduction to the reaction mechanisms, the preparation strategies, structures, catalytic performances, and catalytic mechanisms of the TMSs are discussed to give readers a comprehensive understanding of this prosperous field. The strategies such as nanostructure engineering, interface engineering and heteroatom doping used to improve the performance of the electrocatalysts are discussed in each section. In addition, bifunctional catalytic performances of the catalysts for overall water splitting and rechargeable Zn-air batteries are illustrated. Furthermore, challenges and opportunities for the future development of this field are proposed.

Reversible air electrodes were prepared with an anion-exchange membrane (AEM) as a polymer electrolyte membrane and platinum-based catalysts. The AEM at the interface between the alkaline electrolyte and the air electrode layer plays major roles in AEM-type air electrodes as follows: it blocks (a) the permeation of cations in the alkaline electrolyte into the air electrode layer to prevent carbonate precipitation, (b) penetration of the alkaline solution itself, and (c) neutralization of the alkaline electrolyte by carbon dioxide, all of which prevent performance degradation of oxygen reactions. Catalysts for decreasing the overvoltage of oxygen reactions were also investigated with the AEM-type air electrode, and the overall efficiency was improved due to a remarkable decrease in the potential for the oxygen evolution reaction with Pt-Ir catalysts.

However, we have devised a universal computational screening strategy that can accelerate the prediction of the theoretical overpotential (eta(DFT)) for the Oxygen Evolution/Reduction Reaction (OER/ORR) by using only the adsorption free energy of O*. Our accelerated screening strategy can effectively reduce the computing time by skipping the costly calculations of adsorption free energies of OH* and OOH*. Besides, the efficiency of the accelerated screening strategy was verified using 1008 combinations of single-atom-anchored transition metal dichalcogenides. The given candidate materials are rapidly screened using our strategy and finally 32 promising catalysts are found which have a lower eta(DFT) than state-of-the-art commercial IrO2 for the OER and Pt for the ORR. Our screening strategy that uses a sequential process can narrow down the candidate space, and enables practical high-throughput computational screening of oxygen-involved reactions even for a large number of candidates.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000618794400029

Previous accomplishments have shown that LiCoPO4 is a promising catalyst for OER activity; however, its activity and stability at high potential still need improvement to meet the requirements of practical applications, and further studies are needed for its catalytic mechanism. Here, we report a series of Fe-doped LiCoPO4 materials that exhibit excellent OER catalytic behaviors at high potential and elucidate their catalytic mechanism. Fe-doping enhances the OER activity through synergistic coupling effects, which is strongly influenced by the divalent Co2+ and Fe2+ cations rather than the trivalent Co3+ and Fe3+ cations. The possible rate-determining step is proposed to be the formation of *OOH derived from *O based on the H/D kinetic isotopic effect experiment.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2574-0962			WOS:000526598300098

Herein, we report the improved reaction kinetics of cobalt oxide for the OER via the addition of high valence vanadium and thereafter doping with sulphur (S-Co3V2O8). The addition of vanadium increases the oxygen vacancy while the doping of sulphur increases the electronic conductivity of the electrocatalyst. The synergic effect of the oxygen vacancy and electronic conductivity increases the activity of S-Co3V2O8. Furthermore, S-Co3V2O8 showed the least Tafel slope, which showed the activity enhancement towards the oxygen evolution reaction. Moreover, the underlying reaction mechanism is explored by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, which reveals that the ratio of polarisation resistance to double-layer capacitance is minimum for S-Co3V2O8, indicating the highest activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000847700000001	36043387

The production of hydrogen by water electrolysis is an essential prerequisite of the hydrogen economy with zero carbon emission. Among various water electrolysis technologies, alkaline water splitting has been commercialized for more than 100 years, representing the most mature and economic technology. Here, the historic development of water electrolysis is overviewed, and several critical electrochemical parameters are discussed. After that, advanced nonprecious metal electrocatalysts that emerged recently for negotiating the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are discussed, including transition metal oxides, (oxy)hydroxides, chalcogenides, phosphides, and nitrides for the OER, as well as transition metal alloys, chalcogenides, phosphides, and carbides for the HER. In this section, particular attention is paid to the catalyst synthesis, activity and stability challenges, performance improvement, and industry-relevant developments.

However, their properties as oxygen evolution reaction catalysts have not been fully explored. In this study, we systematically investigate a family of transition metal dichalcogenides (MX, M = Co, Ni, Fe; X = S, Se, Te) as candidates for water oxidation. It reveals that the transition metal dichalcogenides are easily oxidized in strong alkaline media via an in situ electrochemical oxidation process, producing nanoporous transition metal oxides toward much enhanced water oxidation activity due to their increased surface area and more exposed electroactive sites. The optimal cobalt nickel iron oxides that derived from their sulfides and selenides demonstrate a low overpotential of 232 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 35 mV per decade, and negligible degradation of electrochemical activity over 200 h of electrolysis. This study represents the discovery of nanoporous transition metal oxides deriving from their chalcogenides as outstanding electrocatalysts for water oxidation.									149	11	0	0	9	0	151			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000389963200040	27960466

It is a great challenge to attain a high catalytic efficiency with a single electrocatalyst towards these reactions simultaneously. Herein, a porous carbon was prepared by pyrolysis of chitin with the assistance of CoCl2 and ZnCl2 and a subsequent sulfurization process, which resulted in uniform loading of Co, N and S elements. The porous and modified carbon exhibited high catalytic performance towards ORR, OER and HER. Furthermore, the catalyst was used as air electrode to construct Zn-air batteries, which showed a power of 142 mW cm(-2) and discharging and charging voltages of 1.3 V and 1.74 V at 1 mA cm(-2) after 100 cycles, respectively. When used as both the anode and cathode for water splitting, the voltage to achieve a 10 mA cm(-2) electrolysis current was 1.58 V which was stable over 75 h of operation. The performance enhancement is attributed to the etching effect which generates defects in both carbonaceous matrix and the Co9S8 crystallites during the sulfurization, as well as the doping of S and N elements which creates multiple active sites.

Here, surface engineering of metal foams is achieved by immersing a commercially available metal foam in an aqueous Fe(3+)solution at room temperature. This approach provides a facile and scalable one-step strategy to make effective oxygen evolution electrodes, which does not involve any noble metals and does not demand any thermal or electrical energy-intensive steps. The obtained electrodes show low overpotentials of 239-262 mV at 10.0 mA cm(-2)in 1 M KOH for the OER. The spontaneous reaction between Fe(3+)and metallic cobalt or nickel, along with the spontaneous hydrolytic reaction of the metal ions in the presence of air, induces the formation of edge-rich bimetal hydroxide species on the metal foam surface. Importantly, the as-obtained electrodes also demonstrate excellent stability for more than 70 h. Scaled-up preparation of the foam electrodes is shown with the size of an A4 sheet of paper. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the oxygen vacancies induce the structural distortion of M-OH and electronic structure modulation of M-OOH, thus breaking the scaling relation between Delta G(OH)and Delta G(OOH)and improving the catalytic activity. The approach demonstrated here is one of the easy-operation routes for highly active electrocatalytic electrodes towards the OER.									17	1	0	0	0	0	18			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000544719500038

CURRENT OPINION IN ELECTROCHEMISTRY				34						100991	10.1016/j.coelec.2022.100991				AUG 2022	2022	The extensive investigation of 3d transition metal chalcogenide (sulphides, selenides, tellurides) precatalysts has shown that they transform into (oxyhydr)oxides during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and likely during industrial hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) conditions, as predicted by their Pourbaix diagrams. The phases formed from chalcogenide precatalysts are often more active, due to anion leaching induced effects. But are chalcogenides suitable to be used sacrificially, are they abundant, cheap, and non-toxic enough? Is their unique chemical nature really required? This review answers these questions by discussing the role of chalcogenides in the reconstruction/transfor mation process. Furthermore, it examines the role of remaining traces of chalcogenates (sulphate, selenate) that were recently shown to improve the OER activity and can break the *OH/*OOH scaling relations.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2451-9103			WOS:000799957200006

Nevertheless, their cathodic reactions involving oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution are highly sluggish in kinetics, requiring high-performance noble-metal-free bifunctional electrocatalysts that exceed the current noble-metal-based benchmarks. Herein, a noble-metal-free bifunctional electrocatalyst is fabricated, which demonstrates ultrahigh bifunctional activity and renders excellent performance in rechargeable zinc-air batteries. Concretely, atomic Co-N-C and NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are respectively selected as oxygen reduction and evolution active sites and are further rationally integrated to afford the resultant CoNC@LDH composite electrocatalyst. The CoNC@LDH electrocatalyst exhibits remarkable bifunctional activity delivering an indicator Delta E of 0.63 V, far exceeding the noble-metal-based Pt/C+Ir/C benchmark (Delta E = 0.77 V) and most reported electrocatalysts. Correspondingly, ultralong lifespan (over 3600 cycles at 10 mA cm(-2)) and excellent rate performances (cycling current density at 100 mA cm(-2)) are achieved in rechargeable zinc-air batteries. This work highlights the current advances of bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis and endows high-rate and long-cycling rechargeable zinc-air batteries for efficient sustainable energy storage.									81	7	0	0	1	0	81			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000624640500001	33656780

Hence, there is critical challenge to develop stable, non-platinum based catalysts with multifunctionality and better durability that can efficiently replace platinum. While a sufficient number of bifunctional catalysts are now known in the literature, development of trifunctional catalyst is rarely reported. Herein, we report the development of nitrogen-doped graphitized carbon-encapsulated Ni nanoparticles-based catalyst (Ni-NC700) from an easy derivable Ni(II)-dimeric complex. Microstructural studies reveal that the catalyst annealed at 700 degrees C has 4-5 layers of graphene sheets forming a shell surrounding the Ni nanoparticles. This catalyst exhibits outstanding trifunctional catalytic performance with onset potential of 0.86, 1.52, and-0.02 V (vs RHE) for oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and hydrogen evolution reaction, respectively. The long-term accelerated durability test and methanol tolerance test confirm better stability and durability of this catalyst than those of the benchmark Pt/C. The development of N-doped graphitized carbon shell-encapsulated Ni nanoparticles from a small binuclear Ni(II) complex will open a new horizon for the synthesis of efficient electrocatalysts with trifunctionality.									36	1	0	0	1	0	37			2168-0485			WOS:000456631800040

Direct electrolysis of seawater would not be in competition with growing demands for pure water. Using green electricity generated from renewable sources (e.g., solar, tidal, and wind energies), the direct electrolytic splitting of seawater into hydrogen and oxygen is a potentially attractive technology under the framework of carbon-neutral energy production. High selectivity and efficiency, as well as stable electrocatalysts, are prerequisites to facilitate the practical applications of seawater splitting. Even though the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is thermodynamically favorable, the most desirable reaction process, the four-electron reaction, exhibits a high energy barrier. Furthermore, due to the presence of a high concentration of chloride ions (Cl-) in seawater, chlorine evolution reactions involving two electrons are more competitive. Therefore, intensive research efforts have been devoted to optimizing the design and construction of highly efficient and anticorrosive OER electrocatalysts.

However, the preparation of efficient, stable, and inexpensive hydrogen production technology from electrolyzed water is a major problem in hydrogen energy production. The key technology for hydrogen production from water electrolysis is to prepare highly efficient catalytic, stable and durable electrodes, which are used to reduce the overpotential of the hydrogen evolution reaction and the oxygen evolution reaction of electrolyzed water. The main strategies for preparing catalytic electrodes include: (i) choosing cheap, large specific surface area and stable base materials, (ii) modulating the intrinsic activity of the catalytic material through elemental doping and lattice changes, and (iii) adjusting the morphology and structure to increase the catalytic activity. Based on these findings, herein, we review the recent work in the field of hydrogen production by water electrolysis, introduce the preparation of catalytic electrodes based on nickel foam, carbon cloth and new flexible materials, and summarize the catalytic performance of metal oxides, phosphides, sulfides and nitrides in the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions. Secondly, parameters such as the overpotential, Tafel slope, active site, turnover frequency, and stability are used as indicators to measure the performance of catalytic electrode materials. Finally, taking the material cost of the catalytic electrode as a reference, the successful preparations are comprehensively compared. The overall aim is to shed some light on the exploration of high-efficiency and economical electrodes in energy chemistry and also demonstrate that there is still room for discovering new combinations of electrodes including base materials, composition lattice changes and morphologies.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000661883900001	34132310

Herein, we report for the first time that conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) incorporating salen can be used as OER electrocatalysts with outstanding performances. The best OER electrocatalyst (salen-CMP-Fe-3) exhibits a low Tafel slope of 63 mV dec(-1) and an overpotential of 238 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). DFT and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo calculations confirmed that the significantly improved electrocatalytic properties can be attributed to the intrinsic catalytic activity of the salen moiety and the enrichment effect of the pore structures. This work demonstrates that salen-based conjugated polymers are a type of metal-coordinated porous polymer that show excellent catalyst performance.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000533615800001	32281693

Here, perovskite La0.4Sr0.6Ni0.5Fe0.5O3 nanoparticles were rationally designed and synthesized by the sol-gel method with an average size around 25 nm, and it has a remarkable intrinsically activity and stability in 1 M KOH solution. Compared with other perovskite (LaNiO3, LaFeO3 , and LaNi0.5Fe0.5O3) catalysts, La0.4Sr0.6Ni0.5Fe0.5O3 exhibits superior OER performance, smaller tafel slope and lower overpotential. The high electrochemical performance of La0.4Sr0.6Ni0.5Fe0.5O3 is attributed to its optimized e g filling (similar to 1.2), as well as the excellent conductivity.

The OER activities on three O covered surfaces were compared with clean surface. The three different O covered surfaces included (i)1/4 monolayer O covered, (ii) 1/2 monolayer O covered, (iii) 3/4 monolayer O covered surface. The computed overpotential (eta) on the four cases followed the order: 1/4 monolayer < clean < 1/2 monolayer < 3/4 monolayer. And the overpotential of the active site has the following order 1/4 monolayer Fe < 1/4 monolayer Ni. By calculating the partial density of states and Bader charge on the O covered surface, it was found that 1/4 monolayer O covered surface combined with the formation OH easily. Based on the above analysis, the 1/4 monolayer O covered Ni3Fe-layered double hydroxides surface exhibited better OER catalytic performance than that of the clean surface in the OER cycle.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2468-8231			WOS:000541664600013

In particular, the electrocatalytic performance can be largely improved by designing positive nanoscale-heterojunction with well-tuned interfaces. Herein, a novel top-down strategy is reported to construct the oxide/sulfide heterostructures (N-NiMoO4/NiS2 nanowires/nanosheets) as a multisite HER/OER catalyst. Starting with the NiMoO4 nanowires, nitridation in a controlled manner enables activation of Ni sites in NiMoO4 and then yields oxide/sulfide heterojunction by directly vulcanizing the highly composition-segregated N-NiMoO4 nanowires. The abundant epitaxial heterogeneous interfaces at atomic-level facilitate the electron transfer from N-NiMoO4 to NiS2, which further cooperate synergistically toward both the hydrogen and oxygen generation in alkali solution. Furthermore, with N-NiMoO4/NiS2 grown carbon fiber cloth as the engineering electrode, the assembled N-NiMoO4/NiS2-N-NiMoO4/NiS2 system can deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with the cell voltage of 1.60 V in the water-splitting reaction. This current density is 3.39 times higher than that of the Pt-Ir set (2.95 mA cm(-2)). The excellent catalytic performance offered of N-NiMoO4/NiS2 nanowires/nanosheets presents a great example to demonstrate the significance of interface engineering in the field of electrocatalysis.									293	10	0	0	12	0	293			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000454703900026

However, these electrocatalytic materials need conductive carrier to realize efficient charge transfer and further improve the OER activity. In this work, ZIF-67 derived hollow NiCo phosphate nanocages supported by waste paper-based carbon aerogel (NCP@WPCA) was prepared as high-efficiency and stable electrocatalyst. Benefited from the enhanced electrochemical active surface area and fast gas emission, the NCP@WPCA catalyst exhibits superior OER activity with low overpotential of 351 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2), along with good stability in alkaline solution.

A thorough characterization, including synchrotron-based near edge X-ray absorption fine structure, reveals that strong interactions between both components promote the formation of high-energy interfacial Mn-O-Co species and high oxidation state CoO, from which electrons are drawn by MnIII-O present in hi-Mn3O4. The CoO/hi-Mn3O4 demonstrates an excellent catalytic performance over the conventional metal oxide-based electrocatalysts, which is reflected by 1.2 times higher oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity than that of Ru/C and a comparable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity to that of Pt/C as well as a better stability than that of Ru/C (95% vs. 81% retained OER activity) and Pt/C (92% vs. 78% retained ORR activity after 10 h running) in alkaline electrolyte.									269	20	0	0	9	0	273			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000404739200042	28338264

Herein, we report an advanced bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst consisting of porous metallic nickel-iron nitride (Ni3FeN) supporting ordered Fe3Pt intermetallic nanoalloy. In this hybrid catalyst, the bimetallic nitride Ni3FeN mainly contributes to the high activity for the OER while the ordered Fe3Pt nanoalloy contributes to the excellent activity for the ORR. Robust Ni3FeN-supported Fe3Pt catalysts show superior catalytic performance to the state-of-the-art ORR catalyst (Pt/C) and OER catalyst (Ir/C). The Fe3Pt/Ni3FeN bifunctional catalyst enables Zn-air batteries to achieve a long-term cycling performance of over 480 h at 10 mA cm(-2) with high efficiency. The extraordinarily high performance of the Fe3Pt/Ni3FeN bifunctional catalyst makes it a very promising air cathode in alkaline electrolyte.									133	10	0	0	5	0	136			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000406798700047	28666066

In the present study, we developed a new method for producing the structural components of advanced non-precious metal electrocatalysts NiS/CeS nanocomposite supported on stainless steel strip (SSS) represented as NiS/CeS/SSS that are both innovative and practical. To accomplish a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the NiS/CeS/SSS requires OER overpotential of 289 mV, which is smaller than the pure NiS/SSS (319 mV) and CeS/SSS (309 mV), and with enhanced stability of 40 h tested in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. The higher efficiency of OER is due to the strong electrical contacts between NiS/SSS and CeS/SSS, the availability of active centers, and also the lower charge transfer resistance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000812497200001

In the model, contaminant accretion is dependent on the adsorption of species, depletion reactions due to gas-surface collisions, desorption, and surface reactions between AO and silicone producing SiOx (where x is near 2). A detailed description of the procedure used to calculate the constituents of the contaminant layer is presented, including the equations that govern the evolution of fractional coverage by specie type. As an illustrative example of film growth, calculation results using a prototype code that calculates the evolution of surface coverage by specie type is presented and discussed.

Perovskite oxides have recently attracted increasing interest and hold great promise as efficient ORR and OER catalysts to replace noble-metal-based catalysts, owing to their high intrinsic catalytic activity, abundant variety, low cost, and rich resources. The introduction of perovskitecarbon interfaces by forming perovskite/carbon composites may bring a synergistic effect between the two phases, thus benefiting the oxygen electrocatalysis. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in perovskite/carbon composites for oxygen electrocatalysis in alkaline media, aiming to provide insights into the key parameters that influence the ORR/OER performance of the composites, including the physical/chemical properties and morphologies of the perovskites, the multiple roles of carbon, the synthetic method and the synergistic effect. A special emphasis is placed on the origin of the synergistic effect associated with the interfacial interaction between the perovskite and the carbon phases for enhanced ORR/OER performance.

Theoreticians trace this to the occurrence of a linear scaling relationship between the OH and OOH adsorbates within the electrocatalytic OER cycle, which thermodynamically restrains this four-electron process. While commonly the breaking of this particular scaling relation is pursued as a promising strategy to enhance catalytic turnover, the present progress report summarizes recent trends in the screening of electrode materials for the OER aside this notion. This contains an extension of thermodynamic-based screening methods by including the kinetics, applied overpotential, and the electrochemical-step symmetry index into the analysis, enabling material screening within a unifying methodology, or material screening by molecular orbital principles and band theories. The combination of activity-based screening methods with a proper assessment of catalyst stability may aid the further search of electrode materials for the OER in the future.									32	2	0	0	1	0	32			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000550394700001

In this study, a new strategy has been developed for the synthesis of 2D nanostructures of CoFe2O4 and NiFe2O4 following a wet-chemical route followed by calcination. Following this method nanoplates of CoFe2O4 and nano-sheets of NiFe2O4 have been successfully synthesized. These interconnected 2D structures are very efficient for oxygen evolution reaction and it is observed that CoFe2O4 nanoplates and NiFe2O4 nanosheets are catalytically more active compared to nanocubes and nanobipyramids of CoFe2O4 and NiFe2O4. CoFe2O4 nanoplates require only 1.64 V vs. RHE for generating current density of 10 mA/cm(2) whereas nanocubes of CoFe2O4 require 1.68 V vs. RHE. Similarly, NiFe2O4 nanosheets require 1.69 V to generate current density 10 mA/cm(2) and NiFe2O4 nanobipyramids require 1.77 V vs. RHE to engender 10 mA/cm(2) current density. 2D sheet or Plate-like structure with more exposed surface atoms faces more electrolyte to adsorb and react which results in higher electrocatalytic activity.

Herein, the synthesis of mesoporous carbon nanocubes as a new cathode nanoarchitecture for Li-O-2 batteries is reported. The oxygen electrodes made of mesoporous carbon nanocubes contain numerously hierarchical mesopores and macropores, which can facilitate oxygen diffusion and electrolyte impregnation throughout the electrode, and provide sufficient spaces to accommodate insoluble discharge products. When they are applied as cathode catalysts, the Li-O-2 cells deliver discharge capacities of 26 100 mA h g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1), which is much higher than that of commercial carbon black catalysts.

Herein, an in situ oxygen evolution reaction (OER) surface evolution strategy is applied for changing the surface structure of MnCo2O4 oxide with tetrahedral and octahedral cations vacancies to realize reaction pathway switching from 2e(-) ORR and 4e(-) ORR. Interestingly, the as-synthesized MnCo2O4-pristine (MnCo2O4-P) with the highest surficial Mn/Co octahedron occupation favors two electrons reaction routes exhibiting high H2O2 selectivity (approximate to 80% and reaches nearly 100% at 0.75 V vs RHE); after surface atoms reconstruction, MnCo2O4-activation (MnCo2O4-A) with the largest Mn/Co tetrahedron occupation present excellent ORR performance through the four-electron pathway with an ultrahigh onset potential and half-wave potential of 0.78 and 0.92 V, ideal mass activity (MA), and turnover frequencies (TOF) values. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the concurrent modulations of both Co and Mn by the surface reconstructions, which improve the electroactivity of MnCo2O4-A toward the 4e(-) pathway. This work provides a new perspective to building correlation of OER activation-ORR property, bringing detailed understating for reaction route transformation, and thus guiding the development of certain electrocatalysts with specific purposes.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000806732900001	35561062

In this study, ultrafine Fe-modulated Ni nanoparticles embedded in a porous Ni-doped carbon matrix were produced by the pyrolysis of zirconium metal-organic-frameworks, in which 2,2'-bipyridine-5,5'-dicarboxylate operating as a ligand can coordinate with Ni2+ and Fe3+. This strategy allows formation of Fe-modulated Ni nanoparticles with a uniform dimension of about 2 nm which can be ascribed to the spatial blocking effect of ZrO2. This unique catalyst displays an efficient oxygen evolution reaction electro-catalytic activity with a low overpotential of 372 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 84.4 mV.dec(-1) in alkaline media. More importantly, it shows superior durability and structural stability after 43 h in a chronoamperometry test. Meanwhile, it shows excellent cycling stability during 4000 cyclic voltammetry cycles.

In this study, hierarchically porous Co3O4 architectures with honeycomb-like structures are synthesized by employing cobalt-based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67-Co) as metal source and sacrificial template. After a simple one-step calcination process, the ZIF-67-Co precursor can be chemically transformed into the Co3O4 architectures with abundant porosity and oxygen vacancy. These easily obtained and earth-abundant Co3O4 architectures present high performance toward the electrochemical water splitting for evolving molecular oxygen, affording a small OER onset potential, large anodic current and long-term durability in 0.1 M KOH solution, which are comparable to the electroactive noble- and transition-metal oxygen evolution catalysts previously reported. These merits suggest that the ZIF-derived Co3O4 architectures are promising electrocatalysts for OER from water splitting. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The electrocatalytic performance of the Co3O4 NS/NF for OER was systematically evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, linear polarization, and Tafel curve measurements.

The compatible electrocatalytic activity for OER of the Co3O4 NS/NF is attributed to the unique nanosheet structure and the interconnected nanoarrays configuration of Co3O4 that provides plentiful catalytic active sites, in addition to the inherent catalytic activity of Co3O4.

Herein, a self-template route is employed to fabricate a unique hybrid composite constructed by encapsulating cobalt nitride (Co5.47N) nanoparticles within three-dimensional (3D) N-doped porous carbon (Co5.47N NP@N-PC) polyhedra, which can be served as a highly active bifunctional electrocatalyst. To afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the as-fabricated Co5.47N NP@N-PC only requires overpotentials as low as 149 and 248 mV for HER and OER, respectively. Moreover, an electrolyzer with Co5.47N NP@N-PC electrodes as both the cathode and anode catalyst in alkaline solutions can drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of only 1.62 V, superior to that of the Pt/IrO2 couple. The excellent electrocatalytic activity of Co5.47N NP@N-PC can be mainly ascribed to the high inherent conductivity and rich nitrogen vacancies of the Co5.47N lattice, the electronic modulation of the N-doped carbon toward Co5.47N, and the hierarchically porous structure design.									166	8	0	0	10	0	166			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000426618000039	29417808

However, the sluggish reaction kinetics and harsh conditions of the oxygen reduction reaction affect the durability and cost of PEMFCs. Most previous reports on Pt-based electrocatalyst designs have focused more on improving their activity; however, with the commercialization of PEMFCs, durability has received increasing attention. In-depth insight into the structural evolution of Pt-based electrocatalysts throughout their lifecycle can contribute to further optimization of their activity and durability. The development of in situ electron microscopy and other in situ techniques has promoted the elucidation of the evolution mechanism.

In recent years, the Fe-based materials used in OER have attracted researchers' great attention around the globe, and Fe has been identified as the OER active sites. In this study, we firstly synthesized the coral-like FeSe/FeSe2 heterostructure catalyst via a one-pot solvothermal method. We demonstrated that different components of FeSe/FeSe2 heterostructure can facilitate the electron transfer process of the system, where a high Fe charge state promotes OER performance, rendering the coral-like FeSe/FeSe2 heterostructure to be more promising Fe-based electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline. As expected, the as-prepared FeSe/FeSe2 heterostructure with highly charged iron and negatively charged selenium species exhibited better OER performance and needed only an overpotential of 309 mV to achieve an anodic current density of 10 mA cm(-2).

Ni is considered as a potential candidate for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media in lieu of noble metals, however, the utility of Ni has been limited by the required and relatively high overpotentials. In this study, we fabricated a nanoporous Ni structure by selective and partial dissolution of Cd from a NiCd composite (without using hazardous acids or bases). The formation of nanoporous Ni greatly enhanced OER performance because of the increased number of catalytic sites. Furthermore, there was a promotional electronic effect on the electrocatalyst induced by Cd atoms under the Ni surface tuning the catalytic reactivity could be tuned. Additionally, Fe deposition on the porous Ni-Cd structure significantly raised the OER activity via a reduction in the overpotential from a value of eta = 382 mV (before Fe deposition) to eta = 290 mV (after Fe deposition) to achieve 10 mA cm(-2).									81	3	0	0	1	0	81			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000424719300001

In this study a Fe-Co based catalyst is electrodeposited in 30 seconds under vigorous hydrogen evolution conditions to produce a high surface area material that is active for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This catalyst can achieve high current densities of 600 mAcm(-2) at an applied potential of 1.6 V (vs RHE) in 1 M NaOH with a Tafel slope value of 48 mV dec(-1) for the OER. In addition, the HER can be facilitated at current densities as high as 400 mA cm(-2) due to the large surface area of the material. The materials were found to be predominantly amorphous but did contain crystalline regions of CoFe2O4 which became more evident after the OER indicating interesting compositional and structural changes that occur to the catalyst after an electrocatalytic reaction. This rapid method of creating a bimetallic oxide electrode for both the HER and OER could possibly be adopted to other bimetallic oxide systems suitable for electrochemical water splitting.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000476456200001	31250515

Herein, we report the design of a hierarchical micro/nanostructured catalyst. Based on polystyrene colloidal template electrodeposition, an ordered microcup array surrounded by nanoflakes was fabricated. The effect of the deposition time on the formation of the catalyst and the corresponding OER performance of the catalyst were investigated using scanning electron microscopy, in situ X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy, and electrochemical analysis. The in situ XAFS measurements indicate that the structure of the hierarchical structured catalyst is similar to that of gamma-FeOOH. The electrochemical analysis indicates that the hierarchical catalyst has a large surface area and a low charge transfer resistance, which lead to its excellent catalytic performance for the OER. Our study provides new insights in designing high-performance OER catalysts. Moreover, the synthesized hierarchical micro/nanostructured catalyst could be used as a platform for further studies on low-cost iron-based electrocatalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0910-6340	1348-2246		WOS:000817311800005	31685719

But there are still few candidate materials. Here we show a bifunctional electrocatalyst, comprising graphdiyne-exfoliated and -sandwiched iron/cobalt layered double-hydroxide nanosheet arrays grown on nickel foam, for the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions. Theoretical and experimental data revealed that the charge transport kinetics of the structure were superior to iron/cobalt layered doublehydroxide, a prerequisite for improved electrocatalytic performance. The incorporation with graphdiyne increased the number of catalytically active sites and prevented corrosion, leading to greatly enhanced electrocatalytic activity and stability for oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, as well as overall water splitting. Our results suggest that the use of graphdiyne might open up new pathways for the design and fabrication of earth-abundant, efficient, functional, and smart electrode materials with practical applications.									202	16	0	0	18	0	205			2041-1723			WOS:000453244200001	30552325

Physicochemical properties were determined along with the electrocatalytic activities toward oxygen evolution/reduction reactions (OER/ORR). Combining Cu, Ni, and Co allowed creating active and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts. CuNiCo oxide (Cu/Ni approximate to 1 : 4) exhibited the highest current density of 411 mA cm(-2) at 1.7 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and required the lowest overpotential of 312 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 m KOH after 200 cyclic voltammograms. OER measurements were also conducted in the purified 1 m KOH, where CuNiCo oxide (Cu/Ni approximate to 1 : 4) also outperformed NiCo oxide and showed excellent chemical and catalytic stability. For ORR, Cu/Ni incorporation provided higher current density, better kinetics, and facilitated the 4e(-) pathway of the oxygen reduction reaction. The tests in Li-O-2 cells highlighted that CuNiCo oxide can effectively promote ORR and OER at a lower overpotential.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000744679900001	34905292

In this review, the prospect of epitaxial perovskite oxides for the OER at room temperature in alkaline media is reviewed with respect to fundamental insight into systematic trends of the activity. First, we thoroughly define the perovskite structure and its parameter space. Then, the synthesis methods used to make electrocatalytic epitaxial perovskite oxide are surveyed, and we classify the different kinds of electrodes that can be assembled for electrocatalytic investigations. We discuss the semiconductor physics of epitaxial perovskite electrodes and their consequences for the interpretation of catalytic results. Prototypical mechanisms of the OER are introduced and comparatively discussed. OER investigations on epitaxial perovskite oxides are comprehensively surveyed and selected trends are graphically highlighted.

The latter reaction can be accelerated by electrocatalysts, which reduce its overpotential to improve energy conversion efficiency. Herein, Fe-doped Co layered double hydroxides on 3D Ni foam (CoxFey-LDH/NF) with different Co/Fe molar ratios were hydrothermally synthesized in a single step and evaluated as OER catalysts. Structural and electrochemical characterizations provided insights into the origin of the synergistic effect of Fe and Co on OER performance enhancement and indicated that catalyst composition, crystal/electronic structure, and surface morphology are strongly related to Fe content. The best-performing catalyst, Co3Fe1-LDH/NF, exhibited a nanoneedle morphology, an overpotential of 201 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 47.9 mV dec(-1), and satisfactory long-term electrochemical stability in 1.0 M KOH. Thus, this work emphasizes the significance of effective structure design via precise control of catalyst morphology for the development of non-precious metal electrocatalysts.[GRAPHICS].									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1011-372X	1572-879X		WOS:000549804500001

However, how to realize the atomic doping of larger-radii Nb is challenging. Herein, an elaborate molten salt method is applied to rapidly incorporate Nb into NiFe-layered double hydroxides (Nb-NiFe-LDH). The fabricated Nb-NiFe-LDH is featured with nano pompons composed of cross-linked hollow nanotubes, which ensures maximum exposure of active sites. Meanwhile, the generated lattice defects can adjust electron density and absorption property of intermediates on the surface, facilitating oxygen evolution. As validation, the obtained Nb-NiFe-LDH exhibits motivated OER activity with overpotential of 242 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) and small Tafel slope of 31.3 mV dec(-1) as well as long-term stability of 73 h. DFT reveals that such superior OER performance benefits from the fine-tuned surface adsorption ability for reaction intermediates and electron transfer capability as well as optimized oxidation cycle of active metals by synergistic Nb and defects. This work is expected to provide deep insights into the advanced catalysts development via high-valence metal doping achieved by molten salt method.									31	1	0	0	1	0	32			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000728677000008

The surface charges were evaluated by Zeta potential (zeta) for the intrinsic BSCF5582 (Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta), ball-milled (BM-BSCF5582), and heat-treated in an oxygen atmosphere after ball-milling (48h-O-2-BM-BSCF5582), the mean zeta of which represents -11.1, 21.2, and -6.1 mV, respectively, which reflects well on different surface chemistries. When the bonding structures at the different stratified layers and the overall crystalline morphologies were analyzed via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and high resolution transmission electron microscopy, respectively, the crystalline- and bonding-structure at the 50 nm depth of BSCF5582 is nearly identical to that of BM-BSCF5582 at the surface. As ball-milling proceeds, not only are particles comminuted but also the amorphous surface is broken open, leading to the revelation of inner and naive cubic crystalline phase surfaces and affecting the catalytic activities of oxygen evolution reactions and oxygen reduction reactions positively and negatively, respectively, at significant scales.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			1944-8244			WOS:000443654600027	30080394

In this work, an ultrasmall Ru/Cu-doped RuO2 complex embedded in an amorphous carbon skeleton is synthesized, through thermolysis of Ru-modified Cu-1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (BTC), as a highly efficient bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting electrocatalysis. The ultrasmall Ru nanoparticles in the complex expose more activity sites for hydrogen evolution and outperform the commercial Pt/C. Meanwhile, the ultrasmall RuO2 nanoparticles exhibit superior oxygen evolution performance over commercial RuO2, and the doping of Cu into the ultrasmall RuO2 nanoparticles further enhances the oxygen evolution performance of the catalyst. The outstanding OER and decent HER catalytic activity endow the complex with impressive overall water splitting performance superior to that of the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts, which just require 1.47 and 1.67 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2). The density functional theory calculations reveal that a Cu dopant could effectively tailor the d-band center, thereby tuning electronic structure of Ru activity sites on the RuO2 (110) plane and ultimately improving the OER performance of RuO2.									108	3	0	0	3	0	108			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000446998200016	30350553

Herein, multidirectional charge transfer concept has been adopted within heterostructured catalysts to develop an efficient and robust bifunctional water electrolysis catalyst, which comprises perovskite oxides (La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta, LSC) and potassium ion-bonded MoSe2 (K-MoSe2). The complementary charge transfer from LSC and K to MoSe2 endows MoSe2 with the electron-rich surface and increased electrical conductivity, which improves the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics. Excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics of LSC/K-MoSe2 is also achieved, surpassing that of the noble metal (IrO2), attributed to the enhanced adsorption capability of surface-based oxygen intermediates of the heterostructure. Consequently, the water electrolysis efficiency of LSC/K-MoSe2 exceeds the performance of the state-of-the-art Pt/C||IrO2 couple. Furthermore, LSC/K-MoSe2 exhibits remarkable chronopotentiometric stability over 2,500h under a high current density of 100mAcm(-2). While water electrolysis offers a renewable means to obtain H-2, it is necessary to understand the roles adopted by catalytic components. Here, authors explore a heterostructured MoSe2/perovskite oxide catalyst that shows multidirectional charge transfer to boost electrocatalytic water splitting.									27	0	0	0	2	1	27			2041-1723			WOS:000680897400001	34326340

In conventional carbon-supported catalysts, carbon plays an important role not only in increasing electric conductivity but also in catalyzing the first 2-electron reaction of the ORR. The ATO-mixed catalyst itself requires a perovskite-type oxide (ABO(3)) catalyst that is active in the first step of the ORR, such as La0.6Ca0.4MnO3 (LCMO), because of the poor ORR activity of ATO. On the other hand, OER performance strongly depends on the composition of the perovskite oxide and La0.6Ca0.4CoO3 (LCCO) shows high OER activity. Here, La0.6Ca0.4Co0.7Mn0.3O3 (LCCMO), in which Co and Mn are mixed at the B site of the perovskite-type oxide, mixed with ATO is proposed as a carbon-free bifunctional catalyst that shows activity for both the ORR and OER. The activity and durability of gas-diffusion air electrodes with the bifunctional catalysts are evaluated in zinc-air batteries, and the results suggest that the catalyst with ATO achieved similar charge-discharge performance and a longer lifetime compared to the conventional catalyst with carbon.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000518874300032

However, effective, simple, and green preparation of low-cost OER electrocatalysts remains a problem. Herein, a novel in situ electro-oxidation reconstitution strategy is first adopted to derive metal-oxyhydroxides with rich oxygen-defects (M-OOHv) on the surface of Fe2Co-MOF with nickel foam (NF) as the substrate, named Fe2Co-MOF@M-OOHv-ER/NF, which exhibits an extremely low overpotential of 224 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH for the OER, with a small Tafel slope of 44.87 mV dec(-1) and a high electrochemically active surface area of 50.5 cm(2). The in situ Raman reveals the transition of the MOF phase to the M-OOHv phase, which is the real active site for the OER. Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, photoluminescence, and density functional theory calculations prove that the bimetal synergistic effect and the oxygen defects in the M-OOHv, regulating the electron density of states, are the real reasons for the higher catalytic activity for the OER. In short, the newly prepared Fe2Co-MOF@M-OOHv-ER/NF not only can be prepared by an efficient, simple, and green strategy, but also has excellent oxygen evolution performance.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000645628300001

Now, it is shown that incorporating Mn into Co3O4 substantially extends the catalyst lifetime in acidic electrolyte while maintaining the activity.Active and stable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction are required to produce hydrogen from water using renewable electricity. Here we report that incorporating Mn into the spinel lattice of Co3O4 can extend the catalyst lifetime in acid by two orders of magnitude while maintaining the activity. The activation barrier of the obtained spinel Co2MnO4 is comparable to that of state-of-the-art iridium oxides, most probably due to the ideal binding energies of the oxygen evolution reaction intermediates, as shown using density functional theory calculations. The calculations also show that the thermodynamic landscape of Co2MnO4 suppresses dissolution, which results in a lifetime of over 2 months (1,500 hours) at 200 mA cm(geo)(-2) at pH 1. As the lifetimes of other 3d metal oxygen evolution catalysts are in the order of days and weeks, despite current densities being lower by an order of magnitude, our results are an important step towards the realization of noble-metal-free water electrolysers.									17	1	0	0	2	0	18			2520-1158			WOS:000754915700001

Identifying the Zn-Co binary as a robust bifunctional electrocatalyst in oxygen reduction and evolution reactions via shifting the apexes of the volcano plot								JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY				55				162	168		10.1016/j.jechem.2020.07.010				APR 2021	2021	The performance of an electrocatalyst is closely correlated with the binding strength of key oxygen-containing intermediates, i.e., *OOH, *O and *OH, in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Facile strategies to achieve favorable binding strength of these oxygen-containing species are urgently demanded, yet it still remains great challenges. Herein, the Zn-Co bimetallic isolation, which serves as an ideal model, is studied systematically by the density functional theory (DFT). Reaction activity volcano plots are built from 48 models, among them the ZnCoN6-gra(I) configuration is confirmed to be the most stable, featured of the strongest interaction with the oxygen-containing species. Optimal Delta G(o)* (free energy change of an atomic oxygen containing intermediate) is facilitated, which effectively drifts the volcano peaks of ORR and OER closer to each other, enabling promising bifunctional catalyst. Moreover, the small overpotential in the simulation of protonation and oxidation by hydroxy groups rationalizes the durability of the catalyst in both acid and alkaline media.

In this study, three dimensional freestanding porous Cu foam in situ armored CoNi alloy nanosheet arrays with tunable compositions is synthesized via a facile and cost-efficient electrodeposition strategy. With the optimal nanosheet composition (Co81Ni19), highly exposed active surface, improved electrical conductivity, the as-fabricated composite exhibits intriguing properties for efficient overall water splitting in alkaline media. Such freestanding Co81Ni19 alloy nanosheet arrays demonstrate superior electrocatalytic performances with the overpotentials of only 132 and 240 mV for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution to reach a catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. Meanwhile, the Co81Ni19 exhibits high electrochemical stability with almost no detectable activity decay after 36,000 s of continuous operation. Remarkably, this study paves the way to design high-performance and easy-accessible transition metal alloy-based bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting.

Herein, a new V2O3/FeOOH@NF electrocatalyst was fabricated via a one-step hydrothermal strategy for the first time. Benefiting from the absence of binder or conductive agents during electrode fabrication, the increased number of active sites due to redistribution of electrons near the hetero-interfaces, as well as the cooperative effect between V2O3 and FeOOH, the optimized V2O3/FeOOH@NF-1 catalyst demonstrated excellent OER electrocatalytic properties. A low overpotential of 249 mV was achieved at 10 mA cm(-2) and the Tafel slope was as low as 43.1 mV dec(-1) in an alkaline solution. Meanwhile, the V2O3/FeOOH@NF-1 electrocatalyst presented outstanding long-term stability for OER maintained for 24 h at a current density of 25 mA cm(-2) without significant attenuation. This work provided a novel and feasible strategy for the preparation of other multi-component composite electrocatalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1566-7367	1873-3905		WOS:000821316400014

In particular, carbon-supported SACs (CS-SACs) are of great interest because of their maximal atom utilization (similar to 100%), unique physicochemical structure, and beneficial synergistic effects between active catalytic sites and carbon substrates. In this review, we offer a critical overview of the unique advantages of CS-SACs related to their material designs, catalytic activities, and potential application areas. The state-of-the-art design and synthesis of CS-SACs are described under the framework of bottom-up and top-down approaches. We also comprehensively summarize recent advances in developing CS-SACs for important electrochemical reactions, i.e., oxygen reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, CO2 reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, serving as bi-/multi-functional electrocatalysts, and usages in super. capacitors and batteries. Lastly, the critical challenges and future opportunities in this emerging field are highlighted.									106	5	0	0	3	0	104			2590-2393	2590-2385		WOS:000588450600013

Alkali metal cobalt phosphates show great potential as OER electrocatalysts. Herein, an original electrode design strategy is reported to realize an efficient OER electrocatalyst through engineering the coordination geometry of Co(ii) in KCoPO4 center dot H2O by a facile dehydration process. Experimental result indicated that the dehydration treatment is accompanied by a structural transformation from orthorhombic KCoPO4 center dot H2O to hexagonal KCoPO4, involving a concomitant coordination geometry evolution of Co(ii) from octahedral to tetrahedral configuration. More significantly, the local structural evolution leads to an advantageous electronic effect, i.e. increased Co-O covalency, resulting in an enhanced intrinsic OER activity. To be specific, the as-produced KCoPO4 can deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 319 mV with a small Tafel slope of 61.8 mV dec(-1) in alkaline electrolyte. Thus, this present research provides a new way of developing alkali metal transition-metal phosphates for efficient and stable electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2046-2069		WOS:000528740900060	35497144

Herein, LaNiO3 modified with Ag nanoparticles (Ag/LaNiO3) was prepared by the co-synthesis method and evaluated as the bifunctional oxygen catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Compared with LaNiO3, Ag/LaNiO3 demonstrated the enhanced catalytic activity towards ORR/OER as well as higher limited current density and lower onset potential. Moreover, the potential gap between ORR potential (at -3 mA.cm(-2)) and OER potential (at 5 mA.cm(-2)) was 1.16 V. The maximum power density of the primary zinc-air battery with Ag/LaNiO3 catalyst achieved 60 mW.cm(-2). Furthermore, rechargeable zinc-air batteries operated reversible charge-discharge cycles for 150 cycles without noticeable performance deterioration, which showed its excellent bifunctional activity and cycling stability as oxygen electrocatalyst for rechargeable zinc-air batteries.

Herein, we are reporting the use of a copper iron sulfide (CuFeS2) nanostructure (prepared via the hydrothermal method) as a cost-effective and high-performance bifunctional catalyst for the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER). The physicochemical characterizations such as X-ray diffraction, laser Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic, and electron microscopic studies indicated the formation of platelike CuFeS2 nanostructures. Linear sweep voltammetric analysis of the CuFeS2 electrocatalyst demonstrated its superior electrocatalytic activities for effectively driving hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions with a lower overpotentials (eta(10)) of 136 and 320 mV in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. Additionally, multipotential and durability studies of CuFeS2 electrocatalyst displayed better electrochemical properties for HER and OER reactions. Finally, a lab-scale CuFeS2 water electrolyzer was fabricated that demonstrated better performance metrics with a very low voltage of 1.66 V for water splitting reactions. As proof of the concept, a self-powered water electrolyzer system comprising a thermoelectric device (to convert waste thermal energy into electricity) that can drive the CuFeS2 water electrolyzer efficiently was demonstrated, highlighting its promise as a candidate for low-cost clean energy production.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2574-0962			WOS:000678382900067

However, the poor kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) greatly limits its practical applications. Herein, we report self-enhancing photo-catalytic behavior of a CIPS photocathode due to chemically driven oxygen incorporation by photoassisted acid oxidation. The optimal oxygen-doped CIPS demonstrates a >1 order of magnitude enhancement in the photocurrent density compared to that of pristine CIPS. Through comprehensive spectroscopic and microscopic investigations combined with theoretical calculations, we disclose that oxygen doping will lower the Fermi level position and decrease the HER barrier, which further accelerates charge separation and improves the HER activity. This work may deliver a universal and facile strategy for improving the PEC performance of other van der Waals metal thiophosphates.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000848095900001	36000928

The current study provided an interesting example to achieve such a goal by establishing hierarchical architecture of Fe2Ni3 nanoalloys/N-incorporated flower-like carbon matrix (Fe2Ni3-NFCM). The resulting material is free of noble metals and can simultaneously promote the three reactions with excellent activity and robust durability. Significantly, the outstanding parameters eta(10) = 280 mV (oxygen evolution), eta(10) = 144 mV (hydrogen evolution), and E-1/2 = 0.84 V vs RHE (oxygen reduction) can be accomplished over Fe2Ni3-NFCM. Moreover, a voltage as low as 1.50 V (10 mA cm(-2)) and a 76-h durability for water-splitting has been achieved. The assembled Zn-air battery employing the current material as the electrodes can provide the power density being similar to 122 mW cm(-2) plus robust cyclic durability.

The stability of the electrode deteriorates abruptly below a critical pH that is lowered by bonding to a PEM and by the presence of oxygen. Measurement of the pH of zero particle charge - the point of zero zeta potential (pzzp) - of the oxide powder gave a critical pH near 8.5; as an electrode performing the ORR, corrosion occurs for pH 6.3 without PEM bonding and for pH with PEM bonding. The Tafel slope for the ORR is 60 mV/decade after the valence state of the surface nickel has been converted from the Ni-4+/3+ couple active in the OER to the Ni-3+/2+ region. Cyclic voltammetry was used to monitor the shift with pH of the Ni-4+/3+ and Ni-3+/2+ active in the ORR well as the change in activity of the pH of the Ni-4+/3+ and Ni-3+/2+ redox potentials as well as the change in activity of the ORR. These studies as well the variation with pH of the polarization curve for the ORR show a decrease in activity with decreasing pH. The MOR takes place on the oxide at high pH, but the overvoltage is large. The reaction pathways occurring in the ORR, the OER, and the Cl-2 evolution reaction are argued to reflect a strong hybridization of the O-2p and Ni-3d wave function in the sigma* conduction band of LaNiO3-delta.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0256-1654			WOS:A1993RA87600004

Multinuclear transition-metal clusters with high structural stability are promising OER catalysts but their catalytic role is poorly understood. Here we report the crystallographic observation of OER activity over robust {Ni-12}-clusters immobilised in a porous metal-organic framework, NKU-100, by single-crystal X-ray diffraction as a function of external applied potential. We observed the aggregation of confined oxygen species around the {Ni-12}-cluster as a function of applied potential during the electrocatalytic process. The refined occupancy of these oxygen species shows a strong correlation with the variation of current density. This study demonstrates that the enrichment of oxygen species in the secondary co-ordination sphere of multinuclear transition-metal clusters can promote the OER activity.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1674-7291	1869-1870		WOS:000788489200001

Co3O3.87 square(0.13) and Co3O3.87F0.13 showed enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with overpotentials of 440 mV and 430 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), Tafel slopes of 56 mV dec(-1) and 56 mV dec(-1), turnover frequency (TOF eta= 400 mV) of 0.023 s(-1) and 0.042 s(-1) respectively, as compared to Co3O4 (520 mV, 64 mV dec(-1), 0.0005 s(-1)) in the alkaline medium. Physicochemical characterizations showed that oxygen vacancies and the substituted fluorine modified the electronic structure, leading to the enhanced activity for OER process, consistent with the theoretical calculation. This approach provides ideas for rational design of new defective fluorinated oxide, with the feasible extension of such an approach to a wide variety of transition metal oxides.									56	1	0	0	1	0	56			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000591343900002

Consequently, selectivity is a persistent challenge for the design and operation of CRR electrocatalysts. A detailed understanding of key elementary steps and surface-bound species involved in the C-1-C-3 pathways is important for directing the reaction to a target product. However, there has been limited success in fully explaining the selectivity of CO2 reduction, such as the competing production of oxygen-free hydrocarbons and oxygen-containing alcohols. Recently, oxygen-bound intermediates have been identified as essential species to help explain the full reaction roadmap for CO2 reduction. This Review explores the important role of oxygen-bound intermediates in affecting CRR selectivity to the many reduction products, ranging from two electron products to higher reduced products. These oxygen-bound intermediates have a big influence on addressing mechanistic aspects of competing reaction pathways, based on extensive analysis of adsorption behaviour, reaction thermodynamics and reaction kinetics. Considering available theoretical calculations, electrochemical measurements and operando spectroscopy observations, we highlight the preferred reaction pathways to certain products when regulated by oxygen-bound species. The geometries of these oxygen-bound intermediates and their binding on a catalyst surface dictate the breakage or preservation of C-O bonds, which has a significant effect on directing selectivity toward a final product. Based on this mechanistic evaluation, we summarize practical techniques for probing the evolution of intermediates and propose possible strategies for promoting the selectivity of electrocatalysts.									26	0	0	0	1	0	25			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000661200700001

Recently, the application of SSM as an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst has been more promising, while its hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic activity is very low, which definitely affects its overall water splitting activity. Herein, a simple chemical bath deposition (CBD) method followed by phosphorization is employed to significantly boost the overall water splitting performance of SSM. The CBD method could allow the voids between the SSM fibers to be filled with Ni and P. Electrocatalytic studies show that the CBD-treated and phosphorized stainless steel (denoted SSM-Ni-P) exhibits an HER overpotential of 149 mV, while the phosphorization-free CBD-treated SSM (denoted as SSM-Ni) delivers an OER overpotential of 223 mV, both at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). An asymmetric alkaline electrolyzer assembled based on the SSM-Ni-P cathode (HER) and SSM-Ni anode (OER) achieved an onset and 10 mA cm(-2) current densities at an overall potential of 1.62 V, granting more prospects for the application of inexpensive and highly active electrocatalysts for electrocatalytic water splitting reactions.									40	1	0	0	3	0	41			2470-1343			WOS:000489241700043	31592481

This work adopts a one-pot solid-phase synthesis method to successfully prepare hierarchically structured electrocatalysts in which the heterostructure Co||Cu is encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon materials (Co||Cu/NC). The as-prepared Co||Cu/NC exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance than Pt/C for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and a promising electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction. What is more, Co||Cu/NC successfully demonstrated capacity in zinc-air batteries by demonstrating good power density, specific capacity, and convincing stability. Efficient electrocatalytic activity is attributed to the heterostructure, which causes charge redistribution, accelerates molecular adsorption, and promotes reaction process. Then, the N-doped carbon makes high conductivity and stability possible.

Both RuO2(110) and IrO2(110) have been shown to be highly active OER catalysts, however DFT predictions have been unable to explain the high activity of RuO2. We propose that this discrepancy is due to RuO2 utilizing a different reaction pathway, as compared to the conventional IrO2 pathway. This hypothesis is supported by comparisons between experimental data, DFT data and the proposed reaction model.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000688139300001	34473158

The structure of the as-prepared MOF(Fe/Co) was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N-2 adsorption-desorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and thermogravimetry/differential thermogravimetry (TG/DTG). The bifunctional catalytic activities of MOF(Fe/Co) toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline electrolyte were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The results demonstrate that the as-prepared MOF(Fe/Co) has a good crystalline structure with abundant micropores, a high specific surface area and a high thermal stability. The MOF(Fe/Co) exhibits excellent bifunctional catalytic activities for OER and ORR. The high specific surface area and abundant micropores are beneficial for oxygen diffusion and catalytic sites utilization in the catalyst, which is favorable for the OER and ORR. The RDE results for MOF(Fe/Co)-catalyzed ORR indicate that the two-electron pathway was preferred at relatively positive potentials, whereas the four-electron pathway gradually dominated at more negative potentials.

To date, boron sheets are the lightest 2D material and, therefore, exploring the catalytic activity of such a monolayer system would be quite intuitive both from fundamental and application perspectives. We have functionalized the boron sheet (BS) with different elemental dopants like carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous, sulphur, and lithium and determined the adsorption energy for each case while hydrogen and oxygen are on top of the doping site of the boron sheet. The free energy calculated from the individual adsorption energy for each functionalized BS subsequently guides us to predict which case of functionalization serves better for the HER or the OER.

The as-prepared materials were finally applied to water splitting to investigate their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. A series of electrochemical tests such as linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) show that Co/C (700 degrees C) exhibits lowest overpotential (420 mV) and charge transfer resistance (R-ct = 5.25 Omega), smallest Tafel slope (119 mV dec(-1)) as compared to other relevant materials. After the cyclic life test of 10,000 s, the current density of Co/C (700 degrees C) remained at 94.88%. In addition, the comparison of the OER performance between Co/C (700 degrees C) with other reported cobalt-based materials illustrates that Co/C (700 degrees C) has lower overpotential, and its Tafel slope is also comparable with these reported cobalt-based materials. Therefore, Co/C (700 degrees C) has broad application prospect in oxygen-evolution reaction.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000722532700002

It is found that forming amorphous CoSx on the Co3O4 surface through surface anion exchange can effectively generate more Co2+ ions and oxygen vacancies in the lattice structure, not only inducing the production of more CoOOH but also facilitating water adsorption during the water oxidation process.									48	0	0	0	1	0	47			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000451738200011		
J	Risch, Marcel; Morales, Dulce M; Villalobos, Javier; Antipin, Denis								What X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy Can Tell Us About the Active State of Earth-Abundant Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction.								Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English)											10.1002/anie.202211949				2022-Sep-21	2022	Implementation of chemical energy storage for a sustainable energy supply requires the rational improvement of electrocatalyst materials, for which their nature under reaction conditions needs to be revealed. For a better understanding of earth-abundant metal oxides as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the combination of electrochemical (EC) methods and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is very insightful, yet still holds untapped potential. Herein, we concisely introduce EC and XAS, providing the necessary framework to discuss changes that electrocatalytic materials undergo during preparation and storage, during immersion in an electrolyte, as well as during application of potentials, showing Mn oxides as examples. We conclude with a summary of how EC and XAS are currently combined to elucidate active states, as well as an outlook on opportunities to understand the mechanisms of electrocatalysis using combined operando EC-XAS experiments.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1521-3773		MEDLINE:36129132	36129132

However, it is difficult to synthesize Ag-based MENPs with transition metals such as Ni and Fe because of the strong phase segregation between Ag and the other metals. Here, we show that nonmetal element P can help the amalgamation of Ag with other metals. Ag-Ni-Fe-P MENPs are successfully synthesized by a solution-phase chemistry, and they demonstrate excellent bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activities (the potential gap of the potential at 10 mA.cm(-2) for OER and half-wave potential for ORR is 630 mV). More important, the synergistic effect from the MENPs endows them with even higher ORR or OER activity than the Ag or NiFeP nanoparticles. A rechargeable Zn-air battery is fabricated by using the Ag-Ni-Fe-P MENPs as the air electrode. The battery has an energy efficiency of similar to 60% at 10 mA cm(-2). Its performance is almost unchanged during a working period of 250 h, surpassing the Pt/C+IrO2-based battery. These results suggest that the rationally designed MENPs can integrate multiple catalytic functions together and achieve a synergistic effect, which can be used as high-performance multifunctional catalysts.									18	1	0	0	1	0	18			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000645436800101	33821618

The electrolysis of water is regarded as the most effective way to generate hydrogen. Owing to the sluggish kinetics and large overpotential of the anode oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the efficiency of the cathode hydrogen evolution reaction is greatly limited. Therefore, it is highly desirable to explore efficient, stable and low cost electrocatalysts to reduce the overpotential of OER and improve the efficiency of hydrogen evolution. Based on the natural characteristics of non-noble metal catalysts and their excellent OER activities in high hydroxyl ion (OH-) concentrations, the OER mechanism in alkaline conditions and the methods for OER performance evaluation are firstly introduced in this review. Then the recent research progresses in non-noble metal nanomaterial electrocatalysts for OER are mainly illustrated. Finally, some perspectives are highlighted with the in-depth insights of catalytic mechanism, the designs of bifunctional and novel non-noble metal catalysts.			氢气具有环境友好、含量丰富、高能量密度等特点,是一种可以替代化石能源的绿色环保可再生能源.电解水是制备氢气最有效途径之一.但在电解水过程中,动力学过程非常缓慢,过电位较大的阳极析氧半反应严重限制了阴极析氢反应效率.因此,研究高效、稳定和低成本的催化剂来降低析氧反应的过电位,从而提高析氢反应效率受到了广泛关注.基于非贵金属催化剂本身特性及其在高浓度OH-条件下具有较高OER催化活性等原因,本文首先简要介绍碱性条件下析氧反应机理及其性能的评价方法,然后重点讨论非贵金属电催化析氧催化剂的最新研究进展.最后对如何深入研究催化机理、设计高效、双功能及新型非贵金属电催化析氧催化剂进行了展望.						2	5	0	0	0	0	6			1006-3471			CSCD:6368177

However, the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limits the energy efficiency. It is urgent to develop high efficiency and cost-effective OER catalysts with ample active sites and excellent durability. Herein, we adopted a facile sol-gel method to synthesize a ternary amorphous iron-cobalt-yttrium oxide. The introduction of yttrium to the iron-cobalt composite oxide can improve the dispersion of iron and cobalt to provide more active sites for OER. In addition, the addition of yttrium significantly improves the charge transfer ability of iron-cobalt-yttrium oxide and enhances the OER performance with a low overpotential of 241, 263, and 214 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) on a glassy carbon electrode, Pt electrode, and Ni foam, respectively.									16	1	0	0	2	0	16			2574-0962			WOS:000504953500063

In particular, for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in electrolysis, it is necessary to develop nonprecious, efficient, and durable catalysts. A robust nonprecious copper-iron (CuFe) bimetallic composite is reported that can be used as a highly efficient bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting in an alkaline medium. The catalyst exhibits outstanding OER and HER activity, and very low OER and HER overpotentials (218 and 158 mV, respectively) are necessary to attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). When used in a two-electrode water electrolyzer system for overall water splitting, it not only achieves high durability (even at a very high current density of 100 mA cm(-2)) but also reduces the potential required to split water into oxygen and hydrogen at 10 mA cm(-2) to 1.64 V for 100 h of continuous operation.									46	0	0	0	3	0	46			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000498244100001	31762207

The electrochemical measurements show that the OER activity both on IrOx and NiCo2O3 increases in the sequence of Li+ < Na+ < Cs+ < K+ mainly due to the various interaction strength of specifically adsorbed OHad intermediates and non-specifically adsorbed AM(ad)(+) in the EDL. In particular, K+ breaks the limitation of the adsorbate's linear scaling relation and enables a lattice-oxygen-mediated mechanism, resulting in activity enhancement. Further, based on our investigation, new strategies are proposed to synthesize Ir-Co oxide with modifications of various AM elements, such as Li, Na and K. The K-assisted Ir0.6Co0.4 amorphous oxide exhibits outstanding OER performance, i.e. 290 mV overpotential (without ohmic correction) at 10 mA cm(-2), and 36.9 mV dec(-1) kinetic Tafel slope. The oxide modification with potassium plays a crucial role for its superior performance, which highlights the importance of the interfacial engineering to facilitate the electron transfer reactions.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000632993000003

Herein, we develop a new, efficient, economical and durable Ta2O5 OER catalyst by controlling oxygen environment to induce the active OER catalytic surface. Stable surface structures of Ta2O5 and their onset overpotentials towards OER are calculated via systematic DFT simulations. Oxygen site on the stable (200) surface of Ta2O5 is explicitly identified as the most active OER site, possessing a small calculated onset overpotential of 0.25 V. In addition, using the simulated oxygen rich condition, we successfully grow a (200)-surface-exposed Ta2O5 nanolayer on a carbon cloth by oxygen-controlled pulsed laser deposition. In accordance to the simulation, the designated (200) surface exhibits high OER activity with an onset overpotential of 0.29 V and overpotential of 0.385 V at 10 mA/cm(2). The oxygen-controlled surface modulation to activate catalytic activity provides a novel strategy for effective development of metal-oxide catalysts for clean energy technologies.

Carbon is able to provide electronic conductivity and co-catalyze reactions, however, is typically oxidized under high-potential conditions above 1.1 V vs RHE. Herein, we demonstrate highly durable platelet-type carbon nanofibers (pCNFs) for OER/ORR in alkaline media. The pCNFs have graphene layers arranged perpendicularly to the fiber axis of the nanofibers. Such a specific configuration of the graphene layers in combination with a high degree of graphitization was found to be highly efficient in providing long-term durability combined with a state-of-the-art brownmillerite-type Ca2FeCoO5 catalyst. The improved oxidation resistance of the pCNF carbon is associated with the high degree of graphitization and the extremely slow oxidation rate of carbon edge planes at the sidewalls of the nanofibers.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			0926-860X	1873-3875		WOS:000530205100011

Herein, we develop a novel hybrid hydrogel method for the preparation of Co9S8-doped alveolate carbon aerogels. The hydrogel formation depends on a simple sol-gel polymerization of chitosan, sodium tripolyphosphate and polyhexamethyleneguanidine phosphate. The repeating units of polymer contain a binding site (-NH2) for Co2+ ions, after pyrolysis which ensures a uniform anchor of Co9S8 particles within the carbon aerogels. The newly developed catalyst exhibits excellent bifunctional activity and robust stability for both the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, resulting from the significant synergy between Co9S8 and 3D porous N, P-codoped carbon aerogels. Moreover, we also demonstrate that Co9S8 material is more active to OER than to ORR through the density functional theory (DFT) theoretical computation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This study reports a porous carbon nanomaterial loaded with cobalt nanoparticles (Co@NC-x/y) derived from pyrolysis of a Co/Zn bimetallic zeolitic imidazolite framework, which exhibits incredibly high activity as bifunctional oxygen catalysts. For instance, the optimal catalyst of Co@NC-3/1 has the interconnected framework structure between porous carbon and embedded carbon nanotubes, which shows the superb ORR activity with onset potential of approximate to 1.15 V and half-wave potential of approximate to 0.93 V. Moreover, it presents high OER activity that can be further enhanced to over commercial RuO2 by P-doped with overpotentials of 1.57 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode at 10 mA cm(-2) and long-term stability for 2000 circles and a Tafel slope of 85 mV dec(-1). Significantly, the nanomaterial demonstrates better catalytic performance and durability than Pt/C for ORR and commercial RuO2 and IrO2 for OER. These findings suggest the importance of a synergistic effect of graphitic carbon, nanotubes, exposed Co-N-x active sites, and interconnected framework structure of various carbons for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts.									173	11	0	0	9	0	173			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000429318400009

In this study, NiFe(OH)x electrode was electrodeposited on Ni mesh under large current density (500 mA cm(-2)) in short time (6 s), which is flower-like nanosheets. The as-prepared electrode is sub-sequently employed as the anode for the OER reaction, exhibiting overpotentials of 204 and 256 mV at the current density of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. In the overall water splitting cell with a NiFe(OH)x anode, a NiFeSn cathode and 6 M KOH electrolyte, the cell voltage is 1.96 V initially and increases 60 mV at a current density of 500 mA cm(-2) in 100 h, and it is 2.34 V and increases 110 mV at 1000 mA cm(-2) in 45 h.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1387-7003	1879-0259		WOS:000788067200003

These oxides were prepared by ammonium hydroxide sol-gel auto-combustion method and reproduced in the form of film on nickel support by an oxide-slurry painting technique. Oxides, so synthesized, were characterized physicochemically by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), infrared (IR) spectroscopy. Cyclic voltammetry and Tafel polarization techniques were used for electrochemical characterization. The study showed that substitution of cobalt in the base oxide greatly influences the electrocatalytic properties. Among synthesized oxides, the Co1.5Fe1.5O4 electrode was found to be the most active electrode for oxygen evolution reaction. The Tafel slope values of the oxide electrodes were ranged between 44 - 56 mVdecade(-1). The order for the OER with respect to OH- concentration was found to be similar to 2 with each oxide electrocatalyst. The catalytic activities of the electrodes are correlated with their surface roughness. The thermodynamic parameters for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) such as, standard electrochemical enthalpy of activation (Delta H-0# el), standard enthalpy of activation (Delta H-0#) and standard entropy of activation (Delta S-0#) have also been calculated.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1452-3981			WOS:000319861000026

The presence of Co hydroxide increases the reversibility of the Ni(II)/Ni(III) electrochemical reaction and hinders aging effects involving unstable Ni hydroxide species. The simultaneous presence of Co and Zn ions in the metal hydroxide layer has a beneficial influence for the long-term stability and efficiency of the active material. The incorporation of Cd hydroxide increases the polarization of the oxygen evolution reaction. Results are interpreted in terms of either the existence of intermediate oxidation level of the foreign cations which can be produced at potentials lower than the equilibrium potential of the Ni hydroxide electrode or the influence of the foreign metal hydroxide on the oxygen evolution reaction.									49	1	0	0	1	1	49			0013-4651			WOS:A1992JR76400005

The use of EMD, which has long been proven in the primary battery industry, would be advantageous in terms of manufacturing, supply, and quality control. The process involves a simple wet treatment of EMD in the presence of N2H4 and Co2+. EMD is intrinsically active for the ORR, more than chemically-synthesized MnO2 , but inactive for the inverse reaction, the OER. Here, the extremely high mass activity of a small amount of Co that was introduced into the framework of gamma-MnO2 boosted its OER activity, while did not offset the ORR activity. As a result, the overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) in the OER was measured to be 440 mV, while that at(-1) mA cm(-2) in the ORR was 447 mV. Their sum (eta(OER)+eta(ORR)) of 887 mV was much smaller than that (1040 mV) of pristine EMD and differed from that of Pt/C by only 26 mV. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, a kind of nanohybrid of graphene supported atomic Co and nanocrystalline Co3O4 was synthesized through electrochemical synthesis of atomic cobalt onto graphene using 1-Butyl-3-methylimidzolium tetrachlorocobalt [(BMIm)(2)CoCl4] as an electrolyte. By virtue of the synergistic effect of single-cobalt atoms and Co3O4 nanoparticles, the nanohybrid presents enhanced electrocatalytic performance toward the oxygen evolution reaction. The low onset potential is 0.49 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) and the overpotential of the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is 0.30 V in aqueous solution, which is comparable to commercial RuO2. Moreover, the nanohybrid exhibits remarkably long stability for over 45 hat a fixed potential of 0.6 V. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Because of their stability and abundance, Mn-based materials have been studied as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is a more sluggish reaction in the water splitting system. To increase the OER activity of Mn, it is imperative to facilitate the structural change of Mn oxide to the active phase with Mn3+ species, known as the active site. Here, we present the relationship between the electronic conductivity in the catalyst layer and the formation of the Mn active phase, delta-MnO2, from wrinkled Mn(OH)2. Mn(OH)2 has poor conductivity, and it disrupts the oxidation reaction toward MnOOH or delta-MnO2. Adjacent conductive carbon to Mn(OH)2 enabled Mn(OH)2 to be oxidized to delta-MnO2. Furthermore, after repetitive cyclic voltammetry activation, the more conductive environment resulted in a higher density of delta-MnO2 through the irreversible phase transition, and thus it contributes to the improvement of the OER activity.

Utilizing density functional theory (DFT), we show fluorine (F) substitution in Ni2P (Ni2P: x wt. % F) causes unique electronic structure modification leading to enhanced alkaline mediated OER performance. Consequently, Ni2P:5 F exhibits improved charge transfer resistance (10.65 omega cm(2)), lower over-potential (230 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2)), and Tafel slope (28.06 mV dec(-1)) while also offering excellent durability for OER.

The electrodeposited chromium acts as a sacrificial template to introduce holes in the LDH to increase the electrochemically active surface area, and the remaining chromium synergistically modulates the electronic structure of the composite. The obtained electrode shows extraordinary performance for oxygen evolution reaction and excellent electrochemical stability. The onset potential of the as-prepared electrode in 1 M KOH is only 1.43 V vs RHE, and the overpotential to achieve a high current density of 100 mA.m(-2) is only 255 mV, outperforming benchmark nonprecious NiFe hydroxide composite electrode in alkaline media.									73	3	0	0	2	0	74			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000417005900018	29111654

However, a large energy density can be obtained only with a slow discharge-charge rate, and quickly decreases upon cycling. These drawbacks can be attributed to the large overpotential and sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. To overcome the current problems, recent research has focused on developing catalysts made of inexpensive metal oxides and carbonaceous materials in addition to precious metals, but the role of non-precious metal catalysts in the battery performance is still largely unexplored. Here we present kinetic studies and comparative evaluation of enhanced oxygen reduction and evolution reactions with carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays containing in situ decorated alpha-Fe2O3 nanoparticles as both a binder-free catalyst and a cathode for nonaqueous Li-O-2 batteries. Our Fe2O3-decorated CNTs greatly helped to form Li2O involving the four-electron reduction pathway in addition to Li2O2 commonly formed via the one/two-electron reduction pathway, and thereby delivered a very large capacity of 26.5 A h g(-1) at the 1st discharge and a relatively long cycling performance (48 cycles with a capacity limit of 1.5 A h g(-1)). Unique and branch-like nanocrystalline Li2O and Li2O2 after discharge would have lowered the overpotential for the oxygen evolution reaction. Our detailed compositional and morphological studies will be of great help to further improve the cycling performance as well as develop better non-precious metal catalysts and electrodes for Li-O-2 batteries.									30	2	0	0	2	0	29			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000356865300020

Herein, for the first time, we report the phenomenon of crystal splintering induced by interstitial atomic doping for drastically enhancing the activities of both oxygen evolution (OER) and oxygen reduction (ORR) reactions for beta-MnO2. Ru-doped beta-MnO2 exhibits an ultralow OER and ORR voltage gap of only 0.63 V, which is the best ever observed for beta-MnO(2 )and surpasses many state-of-the-art bifunctional oxygen catalysts reported to date. Through advanced microscopic and spectroscopic characterizations, in conjunction with theoretical understandings, the drastically improved OER activity is attributed to the highly under-coordinated Ru-O sites exposed on the surface upon crystal splintering, while the enhanced ORR property originates from the strained M-O configuration with enriched Mn3+ content and oxygen vacancies.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000661521800026

Bifunctional gas-diffusion oxygen electrodes were prepared by direct deposition of catalyst films on gas-diffusion membranes consisting of hydrophobized carbon blacks. The method used allows the deposition of nanostructured films consisting of intertwined nanowires with high surface area. Thus, obtained electrodes with different atomic ratio R ((Co+Ni)/Te) of the catalyst, fresh and thermally treated at 100 A degrees C temperatures were electrochemically tested by means of cyclic voltammetry and steady-state voltammetry. It has been shown that the partial replacement of Co with about 30 at.% Ni leads to the increase in the film catalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000275749200023
