Starting with an investigation of the interaction between the hydroxyl groups and graphene, we determine the equilibrium binding geometry, binding energy, and the diffusion path with a minimum energy barrier and show that those equilibrium properties are strongly affected by external agents. While co-adsorbed H and O form bound OH, co-adsorbed H and OH in close proximity form H2O with almost no energy barrier. When negatively charged or subjected to a perpendicular electric field, the energy barrier between two OH co-adsorbed in close proximity is weakened or totally suppressed, forming an oxygen atom strongly bound at the bridge site, together with a water molecule. The water molecule by itself is very weakly bound to graphene and is prone to desorb from the surface, leading to the reduction of graphene oxide. It is therefore demonstrated that the reduction of graphene oxide is promoted to a large extent by negative charging or an applied perpendicular electric field, through the formation of weakly bound water molecules from hydroxyl groups.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0953-8984	1361-648X		WOS:000325896900004	24100143

By reacting cobalt clusters with N-2 in the presence of plasma radiation, a large number of odd-nitrogen clusters were observed, typically Co3N2m-1+ (m=1-5) and Co4N2m-1+ (m=1-6) series, showing N equivalent to N bond cleavage in the mild plasma atmosphere. Interestingly, the Co3N7+, Co4N9+, and Co5N9+ clusters exhibit prominent mass abundances. First-principles calculation results elucidate the stability of the diverse cobalt nitride clusters and find unique stability of Co4N9+ with a swallow-kite structure of which four coordinated N-2 molecules causes a significantly enlarged HOMO-LUMO gap, while the single N atom doping gives rise to superatomic states of 1S(2)1P(3)||1D(0). We reveal an efficient dinitrogen activation strategy by reacting multiple N-2 molecules with cobalt clusters under a plasma atmosphere.									2	0	0	0	0	0	1			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000818445200001	35689533

In practice, more economic benefits can be produced based on PEC technique, such as H2O oxidative H2O2 synthesis, organic selective oxidation, organic pollutants degradation and CO2 reduction. Although there are plenty of excellent reviews focusing on the PEC water splitting system, the production of various high-value-added chemicals in PEC systems has not been discussed synthetically. This Account will focus on the production process of various high-value-added chemicals through PEC technology. The photoelectrode design, reaction environment and working mechanisms of PEC systems are also discussed in detail. We believe that this comprehensive Account of the expanded application of photoelectrocatalysis can add an inestimable impetus to the follow-up development of this technology.

BiVO4, known for its superior theoretical current density of 7.5 mA/cm(2), suffers from poor photoelectrochemical performance due to the sluggish water oxidation kinetics, recombination of photogenerated carriers, and results in reduced photoelectrochemical water oxidation. BiVO4/Co(OH)F photoanode exhibits an enhanced photocurrent and a cathodic shift of 160 mV in onset potential as compared to the pristine BiVO4 photoanode. Cyclic voltametric studies reveal that cobalt exists in the mixed valence state. The presence of fluorine by virtue of its high electronegativity induces facile positive charge on the metal center, i.e., on cobalt, thereby Co2+ ions as an active site accept holes more efficiently from the semiconductor and oxidized to Co3+ or/and Co4+. Subsequently, these active species, Co3+ or/and Co4+, deliver the positive charge to produce O-2 and recover to the initial state to regenerate redox couple. A mechanistic study reveals that Co(OH)F nanorods as an efficient hole extractor by virtue of its redox ability, suppresses the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole at the electrolyte/semiconductor interface and accelerates the water-oxidation kinetics. Co(OH)F modification of the BiVO4 surface is able to utilize a higher number of holes, which have reached the semiconductor/electrolyte interface for water oxidation that resulted in a photocurrent of 3.4 mA/cm(2). Investigations on the hole transfer efficiency reveals a faster oxidation kinetics, resulting in improved charge injection in the presence of Co(OH)F. Electrochemical impedance measurements shows a low interfacial charge transfer resistance leading to better photoelectrochemical performance. A Faradaic yield of similar to 95% suggests that the generated charge carriers (anodic photocurrent) in the BiVO4/Co(OH)F photoanode is predominantly due to water oxidation.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2168-0485			WOS:000640356500022

Here we systematically study the structural, electronic and optical properties of an experimentally unexplored 2D Silicon Diphosphide (SiP2) based on density functional theory (DFT). We found that the single-layer SiP2 is highly feasible to obtain experimentally by mechanical cleavage and it is dynamically stable by analyzing its vibrational normal mode. Two dimensional SiP2 possesses a direct band gap of 2.25 eV, which is much smaller than those of more widely studied photocatalysts including titania (3.2 eV) and graphitic carbon nitride (2.7 eV), thus displaying excellent ability for sunlight harvesting. Most interestingly, the positions of the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) in 2D SiP2 fit perfectly the water oxidation and reduction potentials, making it a potential new 2D material that is suitable as a nanoscale photocatalyst for photo-electrochemical water splitting.									33	2	0	0	0	0	34			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000429530400017	29560982

In recent years, there has been a focus on discovering the fundamental mechanisms which govern the synthesis of the diverse geometries of these 2D metal nanocrystals (e.g., shapes, thickness, and lateral sizes). This has resulted in being able to better control the properties of these 2D structures for specific applications. In this review, a brief historical survey of the intrinsic anisotropic properties and quantum size effects of 2D noble metal nanocrystals is given and then a summary of synthetic approaches to control their shapes and sizes is presented.

B	Holguin, M.								Enabling Long Duration Spaceflight via an Integrated Vehicle Fluid System								AIAA SPACE 2016								5 pp.	5 pp.						2016	2016	This paper offers a summary of capabilities for the Integrated Vehicle Fluids (IVF) system that United Launch Alliance (ULA) is developing in order to reduce cost, reduce upper stage mass and reduce the number of independent upper stage systems. In addition, IVF increases the upper stage capability to enable long duration spaceflight. IVF is a single system that replaces three independent upper stage subsystems, the helium pressurization system, the reaction control system and the electrical power storage subsystem. IVF is critical to this long duration capability and is essential for the Advanced Cryogenic Upper Stage (ACES) that will replace Centaur and increase performance for the Vulcan booster. This capability is revolutionary and is a departure from the incremental evolution of the existing Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle cryogenic upper stages. This paper will explore the basic concept of operations and results of development and proof of concept testing recently accomplished. The results show that there is a high technical readiness and a valid risk reduction approach to using the otherwise unusable gases from the liquid oxygen and hydrogen tanks to fuel an internal combustion engine that powers the pressurization, attitude control and electrical needs of the upper stage. It will also explore the possibility of in-space refueling from lunar or other resources already in space.

Accordingly, we developed a TiO2-based SnO2-Sbipolytetrafluroethylene resin (FR)-PbO2 electrode that was based on TiO2 nano tubes. We tested the performance of the electrode on an antibiotic, ofloxacin, and identified the major pathway of ofloxacin oxidation. We found growing TiO2 nanotubes on Ti material increased current efficiency, and the electrical efficiency per order (EE/O, kWhim(3)) for oxidation was decreased by 16.2%. Our electrode requires a large overpotential before electrons flow, which minimizes oxygen evolution, reduces hydrogen peroxide and ozone generation, and favors hydroxyl radicals (HO center dot) production. We found the electron efficiency (EE) during oxidation was as high as 88.45%. In other words, 88.45% of the electrons that flow out of the electrode cause oxidation. The effects of current density, initial concentration, pH value and electrolyte concentration were investigated. A differential column batch reactor (DCBR) was used to simulate the performance of continuous plug flow reactor and we found that the destruction of ofloxacin followed pseudo-first order model. We also. evaluated the impact of mass transfer on electrochemical performance. The effects of fluid velocity and electrode spacing on-oxidation rate were evaluated by determining the mass transfer coefficient and the effectiveness factor Omega (between 0 and 1). Our experiments and calculations indicated that the mass transfer reduced oxidation rate by more than 55% (Omega <0.45) for an electrode spacing of 1 cm at a fluid velocity of 0.033 mks. Unlike studies carried out using completely mixed batch reactor, the DCBR can simulate the flow conditions in pilot or full scale reactors; consequently, observed pseudo-first order rate constants in the DCBR can be used for preliminary design.

The Rh2O3 was prepared by the Pechini method. The microstructural characterization of the rhodium oxide was performed using Scanning Electron Microscopy and the structure was determined by X-ray diffraction. The Rh2O3 oxidizes at potentials higher than 0.8 V. A mass loss of 60 ng was observed during the anodic sweep. The same amount is gained during the cathodic sweep indicating that the process is reversible. From the mass versus charge plots a slope of 8.5 g mol(-1) is calculated. Considering a process that involves a two-electron transfer, the oxidation of Rh2O3 to RhO2 with the loss of a water molecule (18 g mol-1) is proposed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

However, it remains a substantial challenge due to the complex structure of catalysts as well as the complicated processes in the generation, transfer and consumption of photoexcited charge carriers. Herein, using TiO2-Pd catalysts in photocatalytic N-2 fixation as a case, a novel protocol to quantitatively determine the atom-specific activity of the edge and surface atoms in metal co-catalysts has been developed in the present work. One key to this strategy is synthesizing well-defined metal nanocrystals with tunable size and a specific exposed facet; another is to guarantee the approximate number of Pd atoms exposed for surface reaction and contact with the TiO2 support via precise control of the loading amount of Pd of different sizes. Correspondingly, the effects of charge separation and transfer can be excluded, and the number of edge atoms is the only controllable variable contributing to the size-dependent photocatalysis. Based on accurate calculation of the number of surface and edge atoms in the Pd nanocrystals, quantitative correlation shows that the NH3 formation turnover frequencies (TOFs) of the edge and surface atoms are 18.9 and 0.0436 h(-1) on nanocubes, and 41.04 and 0.914 h(-1) on nanotetrahedrons, respectively. The superior activity of edge atoms is in agreement with DFT calculations, in which electrons are enriched on the edge of Pd nanocrystals and the d center of the Pd atoms at the edge shifts up to the Fermi energy level, leading to stronger interactions between N-2 and Pd atoms at the edge as well as a lower barrier to N-2 hydrogenation. This work is the first to quantitatively discriminate the catalytic role of metal atoms at the edge and on the surface, and unambiguously prove that the Pd atoms at the edge play a dominant role in photocatalytic N-2 fixation.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000720389000001

Nevertheless, being plagued by severe capacity fading and voltage decay, the commercialization of LMR-NCM appears to be a distant goal. The anionic activity of oxygen and associated phase transformations are the reasons behind the unstable electrochemical performance. The tendency of LMR-NCM to react with CO2 and moisture further makes it prone to interfacial instability and degradation. Here, we report a neoteric method to mitigate the stability issues and improve the electrochemical performance of LMR-NCM by changing the electronic configuration of constituting O and transition metals via diethylzinc-assisted atomic surface reduction (Zn-ASR) using an extremely facile protocol. With the proposed Zn-ASR, a 2-3 nm thin layer of a reduced surface enriched with complex ZnOx or ZnO(x)Ry was obtained on the LMR-NCM particles. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggested the transfer of ethyl groups of diethylzinc to O atoms on the LMR-NCM surface, which ultimately led to the reduction of near-surface Mn and Ni atoms and impeded irreversible anionic activity. The presence of ZnOx/ZnO(x)Ry also resulted in superior charge transfer and resistance against HF. As a result, in contrast to LMR-NCM, the Zn-ASR-treated sample exhibited substantially improved rate capabilities, facilitated charge transfer, enhanced capacity retention, reduced parasitic reactions, and long-term stability as reflected from in-depth electrochemical analysis, in operando gaseous evolution studies, and post-mortem microscopic analysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000700877100060	34515465

The improvements of electrochemical performance in metal-ion batteries and supercapacitors are reviewed regarding the enhancement in active sites, mechanical strength, and defect distribution of amorphous structures. Furthermore, the high electrochemical activities boosted by AMOs in various fundamental reactions are elaborated on and they are related to the electrocatalytic behaviors in water splitting, metal-air batteries, and fuel cells.

Active-site-enriched selenium-doped graphene (SeG) was crafted by ball-milling followed by high-temperature annealing to yield abundant edge sites and fully activated basal planes. The density of defects within SeG can be tuned by adjusting the annealing temperature. The sample synthesized at an annealing temperature of 900 degrees C exhibited a superior response to the I-3(-) reduction with a high conversion efficiency of 8.42%, outperforming the Pt reference (7.88%). Improved stability is also observed. DFT calculations showed the high catalytic activity of SeG over pure graphene is a result of the reduced ionization energy owing to incorporation of Se species, facilitating electron transfer at the electrode-electrolyte interface.									113	5	0	0	4	0	116			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000430165700042	29488308

It forms an interface between the nanostructured catalyst layer and the macrostructured electrode body. In the case of PEM water electrolysis such a layer has only been applied to the cathode to date. On the other hand, it is typically absent on the anode side of the cell. In the present study, such a layer was integrated into the anode of a PEM water electrolyser. It was based on antimony-doped tin oxide placed on titanium felt forming the electrode backing. Using an in-house synthesised IrO2, gas diffusion anodes were manufactured with and without the microporous layer and their performance compared in a laboratory PEM water electrolyser. Current-voltage curves and electrochemical impedance spectra were recorded. The results revealed that the microporous layer is only advantageous in a range of low current densities, while at higher current densities the ohmic resistance of the microporous layer significantly reduces the efficiency of electrolysis.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000410472800004		
J	Omura, Tsuneo								Structural diversity of cytochrome P450 enzyme system								JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY				147	3			297	306		10.1093/jb/mvq001				MAR 2010	2010	Cytochrome P450 enzyme system consists of P450 and its NAD(P)H-linked reductase or reducing system, and catalyses monooxygenation reactions. The most prevalent type in eukaryotic organisms is 'microsomes type', which consists of membrane-bound P450 and NADPH-P450 reductase. The second type is 'mitochondria type', in which P450 is bound to the inner membrane while the reducing system consisting of an NADPH-linked flavoprotein and a ferredoxin-type iron-sulphur protein is soluble in the matrix space. The third type is 'bacteria type', in which both P450 and the reducing system are soluble in the cytoplasm. In addition to these three types, several forms of P450-reductase fusion proteins have been found in prokaryotic organisms. On the other hand, some P450s catalyse the re-arrangement of the oxygen atoms in the substrate molecules that does not require the supply of reducing equivalents for the reaction. A peculiar P450, P450nor, receives electrons directly from NADH for the reduction of nitric oxide.									71	2	0	0	61	0	76			0021-924X			WOS:000274777300001	20068028

The presence of methanesulfonate ions in the electrodeposition solution causes only a quantitative difference in the PbO(2) electrodeposition process without apparently changing the reaction mechanism. In methanesulfonic media PbO(2) electrodeposition rate is higher than in nitrate solutions. Current efficiency of PbO(2) formation depends on electrode potential (or deposition current density), electrolyte composition (concentration of Pb(2+) and methanesulfonate ions), hydrodynamic conditions, pH and temperature of the solution. It is important to note that thick PbO(2) coatings (up to 2 mm) with good mechanical properties and adhesion to the substrate can be deposited in a wide range of current density (2-100 mA cm(-2)).

J	IVLEV, AA				Alexander, Ivlev/AAG-3645-2019				ON THE FLOWS OF LIGHT AND HEAVY CARBON DURING PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND PHOTORESPIRATION COUPLING								RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY				40	6			752	758						NOV-DEC 1993	1993	A hypothesis was put forward concerning an observed discrepancy between carbon isotope ratios in the biomass of plants or photosynthesizing microorganisms and CO2 released by them. It results from a superposition of two oppositely directed kinetic isotopic effects: (1) the effect of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylation during CO2 fixation enriching the reduced carbon with a light isotope and the ambient CO2 with a heavy one, and (2) the effect of glycine decarboxylation in the glycolate pathway of the photorespiratore chain causing an accumulation of the heavy isotope in reduced carbon and the evolution of CO2 with a lighter isotope composition relative to the plant biomass. The first effect occurred during the carboxylase phase of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylogenase action, while the second one appeared at its oxygenase phase. Discrimination of carbon isotopes in both reactions occurs under conditions of substrate pool exhaustion, i.e., the cytoplasmic CO2 pool in the reaction of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylation and the pool of reduced carbon supplying the glycine decarboxylation through the photorespiratory chain. Pool exhaustion multiplies single-step kinetic coefficients because of the Raleigh effect, thus determining both the extent of biomass enrichment with C-12 or C-13 and the direction of enrichment relative to the isotopic ratio in the ambient CO2. The biomass becomes enriched with the light isotope if isotope discrimination in the carboxylase phase of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase action during CO2 fixation is predominant; the biomass accumulates the heavy isotope, however, if the isotopes are discriminated during photorespiration at the oxygenase phase of this enzyme's functioning. The hypothesis explains the light isotope discrimination, which occurs during the photosynthetic assimilation of CO2 enriched with C-13 (C-14); it is this light isotope discrimination that results in heavy isotope accumulation in the biomass and light isotope accumulation in ambient CO2. Within the bounds of the hypothesis, consideration is given to isotope effects appearing under such environmental factors as salinity, water deficiency, oxygen content, and nitrogen availability.									11	0	0	0	8	0	11			1021-4437	1608-3407		WOS:A1993PA76700007		
J	Meng, Lin; Huang, Fei; Gao, Wenyuan; Wang, Daoheng; Zhu, Jianxi; Xing, Changming; Tan, Wei; Tang, Xu								Multi-stage hydrothermal processes at the Laozuoshan gold deposit in NE China: Insights from textures and compositions of sulfide assemblages								ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS				117						103275	10.1016/j.oregeorev.2019.103275				FEB 2020	2020	The Laozuoshan gold deposit is a large gold deposit which experienced the early hydrothermal mineralization and the late hydrothermal mineralization in Jiamusi Massif, Northeast China. The Jiamusi Massif hosts numerous gold deposits that are commonly considered as products of the metamorphic hydrothermal process during two oceanic subductions episodes. In this study, we report detailed textures observations, identify the sulfides phases by the laser Raman spectroscopy, and obtain in situ composition data with electron probe micro analysis to further understand the formation and metasomatism of multi-stage sulfides deposition in the Laozuoshan gold deposit. The paragenetic relationship between pyrite and marcasite at the nanoscale was also clarified by focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. According to the observed textural relationships among ore and gangue minerals, the early hydrothermal mineralization period can be divided into three stages (Stage I to Stage III), and the late hydrothermal mineralization period into four stages (Stage IV to Stage VII). The sulfides are mainly pyrrhotite (Po-1) in Stage I, with minor chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite, and pyrite. The Ag-rich (averaging 15.44 wt%) electrum (Au-1) is hosted in arsenopyrite, which is also rich in cobalt (averaging 2.69 wt%). Pyrite (Py-2) is the main sulfide in Stage II, with minor chalcedony and calcite. The mineral stability relationships in both Stage I and Stage II confirm that there was an increase in sulfur and oxygen fugacities and a decrease in temperature. The sulfides are mainly arsenopyrite (Apy-2) in Stage III, with minor native golds and tellurbismuth. The native golds (Au-2) average 8.02 wt% silver. Arsenopyrite geothermometers indicate precipitation temperatures between 420 and 390 degrees C for Stage III. The sulfur and oxygen fugacities of the ore-related fluids were below the pyrite-pyrrhotite buffer during Stage III, revealing a reduced fluids system. In the late hydrothermal mineralization period, multiple magmatic activities caused multi-stage hydrothermal fluids events. In Stage VI, the pyrrhotite replaced by marcasite and pyrite through the dissolution-reprecipitation mechanism, indicating the increase in pH and oxygen fugacity of the fluids, and alteration from weakly acidic and weakly reduced conditions to neutral and weakly oxidizing conditions. The mineralogical and compositional evolution of the sulfides in the Laozuoshan gold deposit constrain the physicochemical conditions of multi-stage ore-forming fluids, which is of considerable significance in understanding the metamorphic-hydrothermal superimposed gold-bearing fluids evolved in the Jiamusi Massif.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0169-1368	1872-7360		WOS:000515206900037

The deposit is hosted in highly strained graphitic schist belonging to a Paleoproterozoic (similar to 2,160 Ma) metavolcano-sedimentary sequence. The ore-zones are up to 11 m thick, parallel to the regional NW-SE schistosity, and characterized by quartz-carbonate-sulfide veinlets and minor disseminations. Textural and structural data indicate that mineralization was syn- to late-tectonic and post-metamorphic. Fluid inclusion studies identified early CO2 (CH4-N-2) and CO2 (CH4-N-2)-H2O-NaCl inclusions that show highly variable phase ratios, CO2 homogenization, and total homogenization temperatures both to liquid and vapor, interpreted as the product of fluid immiscibility under fluctuating pressure conditions, more or less associated with postentrapment modifications. The ore-bearing fluid typically has 18-33 mol% of CO2, up to 4mol% of N-2, and less than 2 mol% of CH4 and displays moderate to high densities with salinity around 4.5 wt% NaCl equiv. Mineralization occurred around 310 to 335 degrees C and 1.3 to 3.0 kbar, based on fluid inclusion homogenization temperatures and oxygen isotope thermometry with estimated oxygen fugacity indicating relatively reduced conditions. Stable isotope data on quartz, carbonate, and fluid inclusions suggest that veins formed from fluids with delta(18)(H2O) and delta D-H2O (310-330 degrees C) values of +6.2 to +8.4 parts per thousand and -19 to -80 parts per thousand, respectively, which might be metamorphic and/or magmatic and/or mantle-derived. The carbon isotope composition (delta C-13) varies from -14.2 to -15.7 parts per thousand in carbonates; it is -17.6 parts per thousand in fluid inclusion CO2 and -23.6 parts per thousand in graphite from the host rock. The delta S-34 values of pyrite are -2.6 to -7.9 parts per thousand. The strongly to moderately negative carbon isotope composition of the carbonates and inclusion fluid CO2 reflects variable contribution of organic carbon to an originally heavier fluid (magmatic, metamorphic, or mantle-derived) at the site of deposition and sulfur isotopes indicate some oxidation of the originally reduced fluid. The deposition of gold is interpreted to have occurred mainly in response to phase separation and fluid-rock interactions such as CO2 removal and desulfidation reactions that provoked variations in the fluid pH and redox conditions.									29	2	1	0	0	0	32			0026-4598	1432-1866		WOS:000238356800004

In this work, we developed a controllable and scalable self-templated approach to fabricate hierarchical Co-base spinet hollow microspheres for visible light-driven CO2 reduction with a Ru-based sensitizer. The hollow microspheres are assembled by ultrathin nanosheets using Ni-Co-hydroxides as the morphology-conserved precursor. A series of characterization techniques were conducted to investigate structural features of the prepared Co-base spinel hollow spheres. Owing to the integration of the specific microstructure, functional Ni/Co species and oxygen vacancies, Co-base spinet hollow spheres possess enhanced CO2 adsorption ability, more active sites, and efficient transfer and separation of photoexcited electrons. The high CO-evolving rate (27.7 mu mol h(-1)) and selectivity (84.4%) manifest desirable performance of Co-base spine] hollow spheres for CO2 photocatalytic reduction. The findings suggest that such spinel-structured bimetallic oxides hierarchical hollow spheres, facilely synthesized via the proposed self-templated method, are efficient for photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

J	Huang, Xiao-Wen; Beaudoin, Georges; Yang, Yiping								A HR-TEM study on two generations of magnetite from the Alemao IOCG deposit, Caraj?as, Brazil: Implication for Fe-Cu mineralization								ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS				146						104934	10.1016/j.oregeorev.2022.104934				JUL 2022	2022	Multiple generations of magnetite are common in many magmatic-hydrothermal Fe deposits, which can be formed by different mechanisms. This study investigates magnetite from the Alemao IOCG deposit (Brazil) characterized by inclusion-rich cores (Mag-1) and inclusion-poor rims (Mag-2), using electron probe microanalyzer and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), to understand its formation mechanism and implications for Fe and Cu mineralization. Electron probe microanalysis shows that Mag-1 has Si and Mg contents of 0.28-1.15 wt% and 0.11-0.49 wt%, respectively, higher than Mag-2. Mineral nanoinclusions of minnesotaite, chlorite, quartz, and minor Ti-rich magnetite in the Mag-1 account for the relatively high Si and Mg in the Mag-1, as measured by electron probe microanalysis. The crystal orientation of nanoinclusions relative to the host Mag1 indicates formation by growth entrapment, where they crystallized from boundary layer supersaturated fluids under non-equilibrium conditions. Identification of a reaction front, spatial coupling of parent and product phases at micro- and nano-meter scales support the formation of Alemao Mag2 by coupled dissolution and reprecipitation (CDR). Variations in fluid composition rather than fluctuations in conditions such as temperature and oxygen fugacity are the factors inducing CDR. A conceptual model is proposed for the formation of Alemao magnetite where Fe-rich fluids formed inclusion-rich primary magnetite and CDR reactions modified the texture and chemical composition of primary magnetite to form a core rich, and a rim poor, in nanoinclusions. During CDR, impurities of Si, Ca, Al, Mn, and Mg and nanoinclusions are removed from the primary magnetite and formed product magnetite with higher Fe. The progressive enrichment of Cu from Mag-1 to Mag-2 during CDR indicates that a Cu-rich fluid related to the Cu-Au mineralization is responsible the formation of Cu-rich Mag-2 and chalcopyrite. Therefore, micron- to nano-scale characterization of magnetite with multiple generations can provide important constraints on fluid evolution in ore system.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-1368	1872-7360		WOS:000806786000001

This work aims to fill the gap in the literature regarding the transformation processes that affect carbon steel powder production. This information can be crucial for specific powder metallurgy systems. The results obtained using the Rietveld refinement method showed a decrease in the crystallite size, an increase in the microstrain, and no changes in the lattice parameter with the milling process. The electrochemical results revealed a strong influence of anodic electroactivity with milling time in NaCl solution, in contrast with NaOH, where the influence of the milling process was not significant. These results clearly show the significant role of chloride ions in preventing the formation of a passive film in milling with NaCl solution and in contrast to the formation of a passive film that notoriously inhibits both the anodic and cathodic reactions in milling with NaOH solution. The novelty of this work lies in the experimental demonstration of milling's influence on the surface properties of carbon steel powders that directly affect their electrochemical response.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2075-4701		WOS:000787480800001

Herein, we report a colloidal synthesis of well dispersed ultrasmall Ir NPs with narrow size distribution, of superior catalytic activity and stability toward HER and OER in acidic media. When further used as both an anode and a cathode for acidic overall water splitting, the as-synthesized monodisperse Ir NPs yield a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.58 V with long-term stability.									32	0	0	0	2	0	32			2052-1553			WOS:000432586100016

The TiO2 nanotubular arrays were formed via a two-stage anodising then nanosized Au particles were sputter deposited onto the surface. The following aspects were studied: (a) the shape evolution of Au particles on the nanotubular array (via surface microstructural imaging), (b) the effect of different degrees of Au loading on the nanotubular array (via voltammetric analysis) and (c) the electrochemical response of an Au-TiO2 nanotubular array compared to a plain, 2-D Au foil. The Au particles could be deposited as a thin 3-D coated layer or as nodular nanostructures on the array. The highly nanoporous structure of the Au-TiO2 electrode led to a large enhancement in the limiting current (enhancement factor up to 6.6) and charge density (enhancement factor up to 8.9) for peroxide reduction compared to a plain Au foil due to the architecture of the ordered, high surface area of the nanotubular array.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000329325100016

TiOx-Au NCs have a range of morphologies from star-like to urchin-like shape depending on the concentration of TiCl3 in the reaction mixture. The urchin-shaped TiOx-Au NCs exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity toward dye degradation due to strong light absorption, plasmon-induced excitation, high conductivity of the gold, and reduced hole-electron pair recombination. TiOx-Au NCs have the advantage of a wide range of light absorption and surface plasmon absorption-mediated excitation due to their abundant gold spikes, which enabled the degradation of dyes over 97% in 60 min, using a xenon lamp as a light source. In addition, TiOx-Au NCs are highly efficient for the photoinactivation of Escherichia coli and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Candida albicans through the photodynamic generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and damage to the bacterial membrane. The catechin derivatives on the NCs effectively promoted curing MRSA infected wounds in rats through inducing collagen synthesis, migration of keratinocytes, and neovascularization.

The mica adsorbates were prepared by three different methods; Adsorbate A was prepared by adsorption of 1 followed by Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) on mica, and Adsorbates B and C were prepared by the opposite adsorption order and co-adsorption of 1 and Ru(bpy)(3)(2+), respectively. The UV-visible diffuse reflectance (DR) spectroscopic data and emission decay measurements of the photoexcited Ru(bpy)(3)(2+), suggested the different arrangements of 1 and Ru(bpy)(3)(2+), among the three adsorbates in a mica interlayer. For Adsorbate A, Ru(bpy)(3)(2+), could be adsorbed near the mica surface, being shallowly intercalated relative to 1. For Adsorbate B, 1 is adsorbed near the mica surface, Ru(bpy)(3)(2+), being deeply intercalated relative to 1. For Adsorbate C, either 1 or Ru(bpy)(3)(2+), could be randomly intercalated relative to the other adsorbates. In photochemical water oxidation experiments, a significant amount of O2 was evolved when visible light was used to irradiate an aqueous suspension of Adsorbate A containing a S2O82- electron acceptor in a liquid phase, whereas O-2 was not evolved under the same conditions when using Adsorbates B and C. 1 is considered to work for photochemical water oxidation in Adsorbate A due to an efficient electron transport from deeply intercalated 1 to S2O82- ions in a liquid phase via Ru(bpy)(3)(2+), photoexcitation near the mica adsorbate surface.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000320268900017

In this work, NiO/NiCr2O4 nanocomposites with different CrNi ratios (denoted as NiO/NiCr2O4-m, m = 1, 2, 3) were synthesized by a facile one-pot hydrothermal mothed without any template followed by a thermal treatment in N-2 at 600 degrees C. The NiO/NiCr2O4-2 catalyst exhibited a large electrochemical surface area, which provided numerous accessible active sites and electronic transmission channels for the UOR. At a low catalyst loading of 50 mu g cm(-2), NiO/NiCr2O4-2 electrode delivered a current density of 994 mA cm(-2) mg(-1) (49.7 mA cm(-2)) in an electrolyte of 1.0 M KOH with 0.33 M urea at the potential of +0.5 V vs Ag/AgCl. The catalyst showed excellent redox characteristics and better stability compared to catalysts with other ratios of NiO/NiCr2O4, pure NiO and NiCr2O4 prepared similarly. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of NiO and NiCr2O4, multicomponent catalysts, particularly NiO/NiCr2O4-2, have demonstrated excellent electrocatalytic activities and are considered as promising candidates for direct urea fuel cells.

Zona Basal is a shear zone-related gold and base metals-rich mineral occurrence recently discovered in the northwestern portion of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero mining district in southeast Brazil. Mineralogical and geochemical characterization has revealed a two-stage mineralizing system. An Au-W-As stage is marked by a late- to post-tectonic arsenopyrite-pyrrhotite-pyrite assemblage (crystallized from ca. 491 to 404 degrees C), associated with native gold and scheelite, which was formed during the transition from the peak of greenschist facies metamorphism to retrograde metamorphism. A following, clearly post-tectonic stage comprises a pyrrhotite-pyrite-sphalerite-chalcopyrite-galena-ullmannite +/- meneghinite +/- fahlore +/- miargyrite +/- pyrargyrite assemblage crystallized from ca. 400 to < 170 degrees C, corresponding to the Ag and base metals stage. Fahlores from the Zona Basal mineral occurrence have been found to be sufficiently enriched in Ag, due to the Ag-Cu cation-exchange reaction 13PbS (galena) + 10AgSbS(2) (in galena) = 3Ag(3)SbS(3) (pyrargyrite) + Ag(Cu)(-1) (exchange in fahlore) + CuPb13Sb7S24 (meneghinite), to jump across the (Cu, Ag)(10)(Fe,Zn)(2)Sb4S13 miscibility gap. Two mechanisms may explain the abrupt chemical change between the two mineralization stages: (1) participation of magmatic-hydrothermal fluids of relatively low temperature (acting mostly as a chemical source for fluids) associated with a syn- to late tectonic granite intrusion; or (2) local re-concentration of base metals by unmixing of an early metamorphic orogenic fluid due to fluid immiscibility after the transition from ductile to brittle conditions, generating coexisting fluids with different salinities (i.e., extremely low and moderate salinity). The findings in this paper illustrate the importance of considering retrograde or cooling reactions and mineral re-equilibrium while addressing complex ore-formation.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0010-7999	1432-0967		WOS:000781936300001

However, the fabrication of these carbon catalysts normally requires an energy-intensive synthesis process. Traditionally, 2D graphene and 1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are the most widely used carbon supports, but graphene tends to aggregate and CNTs suffer from low density of active sites on the surface. In this work, we developed a 3D hybrid carbon nanosheet/nanotube catalyst with nickel (Ni) and nitrogen (N) co-doped active sites for the CO2RR by a one-step chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. Both single atomic sites and nanoparticles of Ni were observed on the hybrids, but the Ni nanoparticles were encapsulated by graphitic carbon layers during the CVD process, and as a result, the competing hydrogen evolution reaction was suppressed and high CO selectivity was achieved. The as-prepared catalyst with 20 min CVD delivered a stable CO Faradaic efficiency of 91% with a partial current density of 28.9 mA/cm(2) at -0.74 V in an H-cell setup. The same catalyst achieved a commercially viable current density of 600 mA/cm(2) in a flow cell with CO selectivity above 85%, at an applied voltage of -2.0 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode without iR compensation. To the best of our knowledge, these results are among the best performances in the literature in terms of both current density and CO selectivity for the CO2RR by carbon-based catalysts. Furthermore, catalysts developed in this work are synthesized at a moderate temperature without any acid/oxidant pretreatment or post-washing. The energy-efficient and environmentally benign synthesis and the significantly high performance of catalysts are essential to future large-scale CO2RR applications.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000687845800026

This interface is composed of metallic protrusions localized in a chromium-rich oxide layer through a discontinuous silica film. In this paper we propose a mechanism based on preferential diffusion paths for the oxygen through the oxide that are governed by the distribution of the hydrostatic pressure in this layer. We point out that the mechanical contrast between the oxide and the metal subjected to creep can be critical for the hydrostatic pressure gradient magnitude inside the oxide layer. This observation is likely to promote the formation of protrusions for specific conditions of temperature and time of exposure to oxidation.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0030-770X			WOS:000314065500007

J	LAVRUCHINA, AK								ON PROCESSES OF GENESIS OF PROTOPLANETARY NEBULA FROM THE GAS-DUST INTERSTELLAR CLOUDS - PROCESSES IN INTERSTELLAR GAS								GEOKHIMIYA					11			1523	1534						NOV 1990	1990	To estimate qualitatively the chemical state of two main elements in the protosolar nebular and variations of molecular composition of gas in the process of collapse and changing of P - T-conditions the data on characteristics of gas-dust clouds in galaxy have been summarized. It has been shown that for dark clouds the predominance of nonequilibrium processes of organic materials formation as well as important role of kinetic factors and contribution of energy of cosmic rays and UV-irradiation in these processes are appropriate. In the expanding shells of cold stars equilibrium chemical processes are predominant. It has ben found that in some dark moleculad clouds C/O ratio is different from the cosmic one. Mechanisms of interstellar molecules formation have been considered. In the regions with high temperature and/or small density the selective vaporization of major components of the dust particles mantle (H2O, CH4, NH3) and photolysis reactions under the effect of UV-irradiation are essential. Large role of reactions in gas under the effect of shock waves, in particular in hydrocarbons formations, is emphasized. Data on chemistry of dark molecular clouds permit to suppose that in protosolar nebular only hydrogen and nitrogen were in the gas phase being in the molecular form while the major part of oxygen, carbon and sulfur were incorporated in the dust particles. Molecules highly enriched in deuterium in dark molecular clouds were precursors complex organic materials of chondrites and other bodies of the solar system. Some processes of the changing in composition of protosolar nebular in the period of its collapse and accretion of the shell on proto-sun and protoplanetary disk have been considered on the qualitative level. A conclusion has been made that on all stages of evolution of protosolar nebular the molecular composition of gas phase with high percentage of organic molecules was preserved. Molecular composition of this phase was changed due to P-T-conditions as well as shock ware influence, UV-irradiation, solar wind and cosmic rays.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0016-7525			WOS:A1990EN02000001

A detailed quantitative inspection of the effect of anodizing conditions on the structural features of anodic oxide layers was performed. A special emphasis was put on the correlation of the sample morphology with the current vs. time curves, especially in terms of differences between the surface morphology and the inner oxide structure. When the potential of 3 V was applied during anodization, micron-sized particles of SnC2O4 were obtained on the surface of metallic tin, independently of the electrolyte concentration. On the contrary, the anodic oxidation of Sn foil at potentials between 4 and 8 V resulted in the formation of nanoporous tin oxides with two distinguishable layers: a less regular outer layer with smaller nanopores formed at the beginning of anodization, and an inner layer with well-defined and larger nanochannels. A dense, compact barrier layer was also observed at the bottom side of oxide. The morphology of an outer layer was found to be strongly dependent on anodizing conditions. For instance, a significant increase in the average pore diameter in the outer layer with increasing potential and concentration of the electrolyte, being a result of more effective field-assisted etching of anodic oxide and more vigorous oxygen evolution under the severe anodizing conditions, was observed. Contrary to this, no significant effect of anodizing conditions on the structure of the inner oxide layer was found. A strong linear relationship between the average steady-state current density and anodizing potential was observed for the potentials in the range of 5-8V, what suggests that the reaction is limited by the mass transfer in the electrolyte. Finally, when potentials of 9 and 10V were applied, an initial formation of the dense, passive outer layer, its further breakdown, and formation of the well-defined, nanoporous inner oxide layer was observed.

Continuum partial differential equations (PDEs) of atomic transport, phase transformations and mechanics often rely on first and second derivatives of a free energy function. The stability, accuracy and robustness of numerical methods to solve these PDEs are sensitive to the particular functional representations of the free energy. In this communication we investigate the influence of different representations of thermodynamic data on phase field computations of diffusion and two-phase reactions in the solid state. First-principles statistical mechanics methods were used to generate realistic free energy data for HCP titanium with interstitially dissolved oxygen. While Redlich-Kister polynomials have formed the mainstay of thermodynamic descriptions of multi-component solids, they require high order terms to fit oscillations in chemical potentials around phase transitions. Here, we demonstrate that high fidelity fits to rapidly fluctuating free energy functions are obtained with spline functions. Spline functions that are many degrees lower than Redlich-Kister polynomials provide equal or superior fits to chemical potential data and, when used in phase field computations, result in solution times approaching an order of magnitude speed up relative to the use of Redlich-Kister polynomials.

In mammals, distinct isozymes function in the cytosol and mitochondria. Through an intricate mechanism, these enzymes transfer reducing equivalents from NADPH to bound FAD and subsequently to an active-site disulfide. In mammalian TrxRs, the dithiol then reduces a mobile C-terminal selenocysteine-containing tetrapeptide of the opposing subunit of the dimer. Once activated, the C-terminal redox center reduces a disulfide bond within thioredoxin. In this report, we present the structural data on a mitochondrial TrxR, TrxR2 (also known as TR3 and TxnRd2). Mouse TrxR2, in which the essential selenocysteine residue had been replaced with cysteine, was isolated as a FAD-containing holoenzyme and crystallized (2.6 angstrom; R = 22.2%; R-free = 27.6%). The addition of NADPH to the TrxR2 crystals resulted in a color change, indicating reduction of the active-site disulfide and formation of a species presumed to be the flavin-thiolate charge transfer complex. Examination of the NADP(H)-bound model (3.0 angstrom; R = 24.1%; R-free = 31.2%) indicates that an active-site tyrosine residue must rotate from its initial position to stack against the nicotinamide ring of NADPH, which is juxtaposed to the isoalloxazine ring of FAD to facilitate hydride transfer. Detailed analysis of the structural data in conjunction with a model of the unusual C-terminal sele-nenylsulfide suggests molecular details of the reaction mechanism and highlights evolutionary adaptations among reductases.									99	2	0	0	89	0	101			0027-8424			WOS:000232811800016	16217027

The level of RNA of four human ERV groups (HERVs) (HERVE, I/T, H, and W), and three housekeeping genes, of different cell lines including A549, COS-1, Namalwa, RD-L and Vero-E6, as well as human neuroblastoma cell lines SH-SY5Y, SK-N-DZ, and SK-N-AS were studied using reverse transcription and real-time quantitative PCR (QPCR). During the course of recovery from hypoxia a pronounced and selective activation of RNA expression of HERVW-like sequences, but not of HERVE, I/T, H, and three housekeeping genes, was found in the neuroblastoma cell lines, most pronounced in SK-N-DZ. In the SK-N-DZ cell line, we also tested the expression of HERVs after chemical treatments. HERVW-like sequences were selectively upregulated by 5-azacytidine, a demethylating agent. Some HERVW loci seem especially responsive to hypoxia and demethylation. HERV expression in neuroblastoma cells is selectively and profoundly influenced by some physiological and chemical stimuli.									8	0	0	0	7	0	8			0903-4641	1600-0463		WOS:000370081300013	26818268

Comparative study of metabolism of the purple photosynthetic bacteria grown in the light and in the dark under anaerobic and aerobic conditions								MICROBIOLOGY				82	5			547	553		10.1134/S0026261713050056				SEP 2013	2013	For three species of anoxygenic phototrophic alphaproteobacteria differing in their reaction to oxygen and light, physiological characteristics (capacity for acetate assimilation, activity of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes, respiration, and the properties of the oxidase systems) were studied. Nonsulfur purple bacteria Rhodobacter sphaeroides, Rhodobaca bogoriensis, and aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria Roseinatronobacter thiooxidans were the subjects of investigation. All of these organisms were able to grow under aerobic conditions in the dark using the respiratory system with cytochrome aa (3) as the terminal oxidase. They differed, however, in their capacity for growth in the light, bacteriochlorophyll synthesis, and regulation of activity of the TCA cycle enzymes. Oxygen suppressed bacteriochlorophyll synthesis by Rha. sphaeroides and Rbc. bogoriensis both in the dark and in the light. Bacteriochlorophyll synthesis in Rna. thiooxidans occurred only in the dark and was suppressed by light. The results on acetate assimilation by the studied strains reflected the degree of their adaptation to aerobic growth in the dark. Acetate assimilation by light-grown Rha. sphaeroides was significantly higher than by the dark-grown ones. Unlike Rha. sphaeroides, acetate assimilation by Rbc. bogoriensis in the light under anaerobic and aerobic conditions was much less dependent on the growth conditions. Aerobic acetate assimilation by all studied bacteria was promoted by light. In Rha. sphaeroides, activity of the TCA cycle enzymes increased significantly in the cells grown aerobically in the dark. In Rbc. bogoriensis, activity of most of the TCA cycle enzymes under aerobic conditions either decreased or remained unchanged.

To this end, metal oxides (MOs) have been investigated as photoelectrodes (photoanode and photocathode) due to their tunable optoelectronic properties and abundance, but achieving an efficient overall performance based on single MOs is very challenging due to their narrow visible light absorption, unfavorable band position, low charge mobilities, and limited stability. Heterostructuring MOs with other materials has therefore been proposed in the literature. In this review, we specifically highlight photoelectrodes based on the heterostructure of MOs and an emerging group of 2D materials consisting of mono elemental (Xenes), carbides/nitrides/carbonitrides (MXenes), boron carbon nitride (BCNs), transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and bismuth oxyhalides (BiOX). The benefits of the formation of MOs/2D materials heterostructures are outlined, and the state-of-the-art of MOs/2D materials heterostructures as photoelectrodes with various architectures are extensively discussed. Finally, a critical outlook on fundamental challenges and potential future directions in the development of MOs/2D materials heterostructures is presented.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000778870900001

Through extensive research, it has been recognized that the local coordination environment of single atoms has an important influence on their electronic structures and catalytic behaviors. In this review, we summarize a series of representative systems of single-atom catalysts, discussing their preparation, characterization, and structure-property relationship, with an emphasis on the correlation between the coordination spheres of isolated reactive centers and their intrinsic catalytic activities. We also share our perspectives on the current challenges and future research promises in the development of single-atom catalysis. With this article, we aim to highlight the possibility of finely tuning the catalytic performances by engineering the coordination spheres of single-atom sites and provide new insights into the further development for this emerging research field.									46	3	0	0	1	0	45			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000662772600001	34138406

Here, ultrathin Ni and nitrogen-codoped carbon nanosheets (Ni-N-CNSs) were proposed by a facile in-situ pyrolytic strategy. The ultrathin porous structure of Ni-N-CNSs affords large surface area, rich mesoporous volume and vast uniformly dispersed Ni atoms. The optimized catalyst exhibits a high CO Faradaic efficiency of nearly 100%, partial current density of 121.4 mA mg(-1), CO production rate of 37.7 mu mol mg(-1) min(-1), and super durability. In addition, the first principles calculations and the Mulliken charge analyses reveal the Ni sites show high bonding force towards the CO2 molecules, which gives rise to the high activity and selectivity of Ni-N-CNSs in CO2RR.

The linear scaling relationship between the adsorption energies of -N2H and -NH2 on a single active site is a well-established bottleneck. By investigating a series of densely monodispersed Mo-N-C sites embedded in graphene using first-principles calculations, we found that previously underappreciated neighboring effects between adjacent active sites may help break the limit: they not only improve the energetics of potential determining steps of NRR but also promote an alternative associative mechanism based on a cooperative bridge-on adsorption of N-2 by two Mo-N-C sites of similar to 6 angstrom apart. Further, a barrier of 0.71 eV for N-N bond dissociation is achieved by proper ratio of coordinated C/N atoms of Mo. Our work suggests the cooperation of two adjacent active sites may offer an alternative strategy of nitrogen fixation.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			1948-7185			WOS:000537432500031	32354216

In this study, porous MoS2/nitrogendoped carbon (MoS2/CNX) as Pt supports/co-catalyst for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) is successfully prepared by using waste bagasse as carbon source. Various material characterization techniques and electrochemical tests are performed to investigate the relationship between structural characteristics and MOR activity. The highly porous structure of CNX can provide abundant binding sites for growing well-dispersed MoS2 with coral-reef structure, which should facilitate the exposure of MoS2 edge to improve co-catalytic activity of MoS2/CNX. Pt/MoS2/CNX displays a higher mass activity (1030.2 mA mg(pt)(-1)) than those of Pt/MoS2/C (710.1 mA mg(pt)(-1)) and commercial Pt/C (405.4 mA mg(pt)(-1)), owing to that MoS2/CNX can afford abundant attachment sites to anchor Pt to enlarge the available electrochemically active area (111.2m(2)g(pt)(-1)) for MOR. With the introduction of porous CNX, more active sites on MoS2 edges are exposed out to dissociate water molecule for eliminating adsorbed CO-species on the active sites of Pt, which is conductive to enhance the durability and CO tolerance of Pt/MoS2/CNX. Furthermore, MoS2/CNX with high specific surface area (451.38 m(2) g(-1)) can offer sufficient oxygen-containing functional groups to facilitate the oxidation of intermediates (CO-species) on the active Pt sites, which can also promote the accessibility of methanol to the electroactive surface. These results provide a promising strategy for the design of highly active Pt support/co-catalyst to minimize Pt usage. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Synthesis and characterisation of La1-xMnO3+or-delta nanopowders prepared by acrylamide polymerisation								Solid State Communications				121	2-3			133	7						2001	2001	La1-xMnO3+or-delta (x=-0.02 to 0.35) nanocrystalline powders were prepared by a new sol-gel method. Acrylamide gelification is used to form an organic 3D tangled network where a solution of the respective cations is soaked. This method was adapted to cover a broad range of high impact electro-ceramic oxides, of which a particular example is the CMR nanopowders reported in this work. The acrylamide sol-gel process is a fast, cheaper and easy to scale-up method for obtaining fine powders of complex oxides. This synthesis method allows performing 100 g of highly pure nanopowders in one run with simple laboratory scale. The sponge like powder obtained consists of thin sheets composed of nanocrystallites whose size varies from 66 nm to 30 nm, depending on composition. The oxygen content of the manganite powder is shown to decrease with vacancy-doping on the lanthanum site. Such a evolution can be explained for La/Mn<0.9 by considering a demixtion of the powder into La0.9MnO3 and Mn3O4 phases, while for La/Mn>0.9, the high oxygen excess leads to the consideration of vacancies on both lanthanum and manganese sites. Both hypotheses are supported by magnetic measurements, which show a constant Curie temperature of 295 K for La/Mn<0.9, while for La/Mn>0.9, the occurrence of vacancies on manganese sites progressively impedes the ferromagnetic interactions, leading to a cluster-glass behaviour in the case of the highly manganese-deficient La0.94Mn0.92O3 compound.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0038-1098			INSPEC:7182751

Herein, it is demonstrated that high-density nitrogen vacancies formed on cubic copper nitrite (Cu3Nx) feature as efficient electrocatalytic centers for CO-CO coupling to form the key OCCO* intermediate toward C-2 products. Cu3Nx with different nitrogen densities are fabricated by an electrochemical lithium tuning strategy, and density functional theory calculations indicate that the adsorption energies of CO* and the energy barriers of forming key C-2 intermediates are strongly correlated with nitrogen vacancy density. The Cu3Nx catalyst with abundant nitrogen vacancies presents one of the highest Faradaic efficiencies toward C-2 products of 81.7 +/- 2.3% at -1.15 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (without ohmic correction), corresponding to the partial current density for C-2 production as -307 +/- 9 mA cm(-2). An outstanding electrochemical stability is also demonstrated at high current densities, substantially exceeding CuOx catalysts with oxygen vacancies. The work suggests an attractive approach to create stable anion vacancies as catalytic centers toward multicarbon products in electrochemical CO2 reduction.									14	1	0	0	1	0	14			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000686619700001	34415633

Herein, the activity of a CdTe photoanode having an internal p-n junction during PEC water oxidation was enhanced by applying a CdCl2 annealing treatment together with surface modifications. The resulting CdTe photoanode generated photocurrents of 1.8 and 5.4 mA cm(-2) at 0.6 and 1.2 V-RHE, respectively, with a photoanodic current onset potential of 0.22 V-RHE under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G). The CdCl2 annealing increased the grain sizes and lowered the density of grain boundaries, allowing more efficient charge separation. Consequently, a two-electrode tandem PEC cell comprising a CdTe-based photoanode and photocathode split water without any external bias at a solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 0.51 % at the beginning of the reaction.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000537452800001	32394584

One interesting approach is the use of sunlight to perform water splitting for hydrogen production. For such systems, developing an efficient and stable water-oxidizing catalyst is an essential task. Using K2FeO4, we report a simple method to deposit iron oxide on metallic nickel for water oxidation. The Fe/Ni-based electrode, at pH = 13, shows a current density of 1.9 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 250.0 mV, making it a promising anode for use in water-splitting systems. At a higher overpotential (700.0 mV), a current density of 23.5 mA cm(-2) was observed.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2398-4902			WOS:000422773700025

The carbon employed was derived from pyrolysis of phenol-formaldehyde resins. It was found that greater surface area and pore volume are created for the carbon gasified in O-2 than that in N2O. At high extents of burn-off the carbon gasified in N2O shows a larger mesopore volume than that in O-2. The reactivity per unit surface area of the carbon in N2O decreases with the extent of burn-off, while that in O-2 remains relatively constant at various extents of burn-off. Surfaces in carbon micropores do not appear to be fully utilized in the N2O-carbon reaction. It is confirmed that standard N-2 or CO2 surface area is not a proper characterization of the reactive surface area of carbon gasified in N2O.

Oxygen isotopic ratios of the silicate grain are O-17/O-16 = (4.91 +/- 0.36) x 10(-3) (12 times the solar value) and O-18/O-16(1.36 +/- 0.19) x 10(-3) (0.4 times the solar value). This signature points to condensation in the ejecta of a similar to 2 M-circle dot close-to-solar metallicity red giant branch (RGB) or asymptotic giant branch(AGB), star. Alternatively, the grain could have formed in the ejecta of a nova, in which O-17 is highly overabundant. TEM analysis of the grain revealed a high pressure perovskite-like crystal structure not predicted by equilibrium condensation in low-pressure stellar environments. A possible formation scenario is transformation of a silicate precursor triggered by a shock wave, either in the interstellar medium (ISM) or originating from the grain's parent star. Shock waves must thus be considered as a potential mechanism to recrystallize silicates, or even convert them into high-pressure structures. Alternatively, nonequilibrium condensation or crystallization by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-like process, also invoked for the formation of nanodiamonds, is a distinct possibility, although more speculative.									44	0	0	0	1	0	44			0004-637X			WOS:000249058800013

For alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode, photocurrent was significantly enhanced by dozens of folds compared to that in Na2SO4 solution under similar conditions. Based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, energy alignment measurements, photovoltage decay and Mott-Schottky plot, mechanism for charge transfer and function of CDs was well characterized. As semiconductors, CDs can combine with alpha-Fe2O3 into heterojunction for charge separation. As electrolyte, it can induce downward shift in conduction band of alpha-Fe2O3, allowing for stronger driving force for charge migration. Since CDs solution possesses a negative Zeta potential, it is proposed that during PEC proceeding, static interaction between CDs and positively charged photoanodic substrate can induce a dynamic balance of CDs absorbing or desorbing on/off alpha-Fe2O3 surface, which accounts for fast charge transfer, boosted photocurrent and high stability in PEC water splitting.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000706861200002

In photocatalysis, a large band gap with suitable edge-position is necessary to warrant enough driving force for reaction, whereas a much smaller band gap is needed for visible-light response and high solar energy conversion efficiency. This paradox hinders the development of photocatalysts. Via state-of-the-art first-principles calculations, we find that the transition dipole moments (TDMs) are changed significantly in O-doped partly polymerized g-C3N4, i.e., OH-terminated polymeric heptazine imide (PHI-OH), and concomitantly, an enhancement of visible-light absorption is achieved; meanwhile a large enough band gap can provide a powerful driving force in the photocatalytic watersplitting reaction. Furthermore, by using TDM analysis of the PHI-OH/BC3N heterostructure, direct light excited transition between two building layers can be confirmed, suggesting it as a candidate catalyst for hydrogen evolution. From TDM analysis of the PHI-OH/BCN heterostructure, we also verify a Z-scheme process, which involves simultaneous photoexcitations with strong reducibility and oxidizability. Thus, TDM could be a good referential descriptor for revealing photocatalytic mechanisms in semiconductor photocatalysts and interlayer photoexcitation behavior in layered heterostructures. Hopefully, more strategies via modification of TDMs would be proposed to enhance the visible-light response of a semiconductor without sacrificing its photocatalytic driving force.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000535921700047	32167519

The existence of metal impurities as a residue of a metallic growth catalyst may also lower the performance of SWCNT-based devices. Here, it is shown that by using silicon oxide (SiOx) nanoparticles as a catalyst, metal-free semiconducting and metallic SWCNTs can be selectively synthesized by the chemical vapor deposition of ethanol. It is found that control over the nanoparticle size and the content of oxygen in the SiOx catalyst plays a key role in the selective growth of SWCNTs. Furthermore, by using the as-grown semiconducting and metallic SWCNTs as the channel material and source/drain electrodes, respectively, all-SWCNT thin-film transistors are fabricated to demonstrate the remarkable potential of these SWCNTs for electronic devices.									23	1	0	0	0	0	23			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000407995100002	28635068

The muti-wall carbon nanotabes synthesized in the oxygen added reaction gas by plasma enhanced CVD were shaped in straight structure with connected nano-pores and open caps by plasma etching effect The hydrogen desorption property of the straight shaped carbon nanotubes was compared with the curly shaped ones without plasma etching effect Using thermal desorption technique, hydrogen evolution was detected over the seaming temperature from 283K to 473K at various seaming rate. The straight shaped multi-wall carbon nanotube desorbed hydrogen up to 2.21wt% at around 300similar to320K On contrary, the curly shaped muti-wall carbon nanotube with blocked nano-pores and closed caps showed two hydrogen desorption peaks, major peak at around 295Ksimilar to330K and a second peak at 417K Hydrogen as high as 0.64wt% was desorbed in the wide range from 295 to 330K and 0.03wt% was evolved at around 417K In order to evaluate the hydrogen interaction with carbon nanotube, hydrogen desorption activation energies of carbon nanotubes with different structures were calculated by means of Kissinger's method. The low temperature hydrogen desorption of straight shaped multi-wall carbon nanotube and the curly shaped multi-wall carbon nanotube showed the activation energies of-16.52 kJ/mol and -18.49 kJ/mol, respectively. These values imply that the hydrogen reaction with carbon nanotube can be physical adsorption. There was no decay in low temperature hydrogen desorption amount during absorption/desorption cycling, which means physi-sorbed hydrogen on carbon nanotube could be reversible. The high temperature hydrogen desorption observed only in curly shaped carbon nanotube with defective structure was as high activation energy as-124.4 kJ/mol, and could not be observed in next desorption procedure. Therefore, it is considered that high temperature desorption is probably linked to the chemical adsorption in in-eversible storage site.					4th Pacific Rim International Conference on Advanced Materials and Processing (PRICM4)4th Pacific Rim International Conference on Advanced Materials and Processing (PRICM4)	DEC 11-15, 2001DEC 11-15, 2001	Japan Inst Met; Chinese Soc Met; Korean Inst Met & Mat; Minerals, Met & Mat Soc; Iketani Sci & Technol Fdn; USN, Off Naval Res Int Field Off; Asian Off Aerosp Res & Dev; USA Res Off Far EJapan Inst Met; Chinese Soc Met; Korean Inst Met & Mat; Minerals, Met & Mat Soc; Iketani Sci & Technol Fdn; USN, Off Naval Res Int Field Off; Asian Off Aerosp Res & Dev; USA Res Off Far E	HONOLULU, HIHONOLULU, HI	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					4-88903-404-8	WOS:000178391600127

A.; Abdel-Azeim, Safwat; Jahangir, Tahir Naveed; Alhooshani, Khalid								Phosphate ions interfacial drift layer to improve the performance of CoFe-Prussian blue hematite photoanode toward water splitting								APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL				304						121014	10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.121014				MAY 2022	2022	Charge recombination at the surface of hematite photoanode is among the main issues that diminish its photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting efficiency. Herein, we address this issue by anchoring phosphate ions (Pi) layer between hematite's surface and CoFe-Prussian blue analogue (CoFe-PBA) water oxidation catalyst (WOC). The PEC results revealed that the Pi interfacial layer is crucial for boosting the PEC activity of CoFe-PBA/hematite photoanode. It improves the activity by 2.9-fold at 1.23 V-RHE. The analysis of time and frequency-resolved results revealed that the synergy between the Pi layer and CoFe-PBA catalyst prolongs the photogenerated holes lifetime, reduces their charge transfer resistance, and suppresses the surface recombination. The DFT simulations suggested that the Pi interfacial layer drifts the electrostatic potential of the hematite's surface toward more negative potential and thus facilities the diffusion of the photogenerated holes toward the hematite/CoFe-PBA/electrolyte interfaces making them dynamically apposite to oxidize water on CoFe-PBA WOC.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000787895200006

Herein, we report a simple and efficient method to synthesize the N-doped carbon-shielding CoFe-rich CoFe2O4 catalyst which exhibits superior ORR catalytic activity under alkaline conditions due to the improved conductivity and high electrochemically active surface area. The NC@CoFe-CoFe2O4 catalyst shows a positive onset potential (1.0 V), half-wave potential (0.89 V) and maximum limiting current density (-5.0 mA cm(-2) ), which are similar to commercial Pt/C, while significantly higher than those of all other controls and most of the previously reported catalysts. The Koutecky-Levich equation and rotating ring-disk electrode test prove a direct four-electron reduction process. Moreover, the NC@CoFe-CoFe2O4 catalyst also demonstrates superior methanol tolerance and long-term stability compared to Pt/C. The proposed catalytic mechanism analysis illustrates that the excellent ORR electrocatalytic activities and durability are the combined effect of highly conductive CoFe alloy, abundant Co-N/Fe-N sites along with the hydrophilic nature of CoFe2O4 clusters.

Herein, Ni3Pt alloy is deposited on 3D nickel foam by a pulsed laser deposition method, working as a stable binder-free air electrode for rechargeable zinc-air batteries. The polycrystalline Ni3Pt alloy possesses high oxygen-conversion catalytic activity, which is highly desirable for the charge and discharge process in zinc-air battery. Meanwhile, this sample technique constructs an integrated and stable electrode structure, which not only has a 3D architecture of high conductivity and porosity but also produces a uniform Ni3Pt strongly adhering to the substrate, favoring rapid gas and electrolyte diffusion throughout the whole energy conversion process. Employed as an air electrode in zinc-air batteries, it exhibits a small charge and discharge gap of below 0.62 V at 10 mA cm(-2), with long cycle life of 478 cycles under 10 min per cycle. Furthermore, benefitting from the structural advantages, a flexible device exhibits similar electrochemical performance even under the bending state. The high performance resulting from this type of integrated electrode in this work paves the way of a promising technique to fabricate air electrodes for zinc-air batteries.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9				2056-6646		WOS:000486093400004	31565398

Among the studied tantalum clusters, Ta10- exhibits prominent mass abundance indicative of its unique inertness. DFT calculation results revealed a D4d bipyramidal prolate structure of the most stable Ta10- , which was verified by photoelectron spectroscopy experiments. The calculations also unveiled that Ta10- has the largest HOMO-LUMO gap and second-order difference of binding energy among the studied clusters. This is associated with its well-organized superatomic orbitals, which consist of both 6s and 5d orbitals of tantalum atoms, allowing for splitting of superatomic 1D and 2P orbitals and an enlarged gap between the singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) and unoccupied beta counterpart, which brings forth stabilization energy pertaining to Jahn-Teller distortion. Also, the SOMO exhibits a united d-d pi orbital pattern that embraces the central Ta8- moiety.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1948-7185			WOS:000875849000001	36220259

Battery-supercapacitor hybrid devices (BSHDs), combining the high-energy-density feature of batteries and the high-power-density properties of supercapacitors, have attracted mass attention in terms of energy storage. However, the electrochemical performances of cathode materials for BSHDs are severely limited by poor electrical conductivity and ion transport kinetics. As the rich redox reactions induced by transition metal compounds are able to offer high specific capacity, they are an ideal choice of cathode materials. Therefore, this paper reviews the currently advanced progress of transition metal compound-based cathodes with high-rate performance in BSHDs. We discuss some efficient strategies of enhancing the rate performance of transition metal compounds, including developing intrinsic electrode materials with high conductivity and fast ion transport; modifying materials, such as inserting defects and doping; building composite structures and 3D nano-array structures; interfacial engineering and catalytic effects. Finally, some suggestions are proposed for the potential development of cathodes for BSHDs, which may provide a reference for significant progress in the future.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2516-0230			WOS:000687641100001	36132631

The metals used in this work included zirconium (Zr), Zr-8 wt.% stainless steel, and stainless steel containing 15 wt.% Zr. The ceramic substrates include yttria, Zr carbide, and hafnium (Hf) carbide. The metal-ceramic samples were placed on top of a tungsten (W) dish. These experiments were conducted with the temperature increasing at a controlled rate until reaching set points above 2000 degreesC; the systems were held at the peak temperature for about five min and then cooled. The atmosphere in the furnace was argon (Ar). An outside video recording system was used to monitor the changes on heating up and cooling down. All samples underwent a post-test metallurgical examination. Pure Zr was found to react with yttria, resulting in oxygen (0) evolution at the liquid metal-ceramic interface. In addition, dissolved 0 was observed in the as-cooled Zr metal. Yttrium (Y) was also present in the Zr metal, but it had segregated to the grain boundaries on cooling. Despite the normal expectations for reactive wetting, no transition interface was developed, but the Zr metal was tightly bound to yttria ceramic. Similar reactions occurred between the yttria and the Zr-stainless steel alloys. Two other ceramic samples were Zr carbide and Hf carbide; both carbide substrates were wetted readily by the molten Zr, which flowed easily to the sides of the substrates. The molten Zr caused a very limited dissolution of the Zr carbide, and it reacted more strongly with the Hf carbide. These reactive wetting results are relevant to the design of interfaces and the development of reactive filter metals for the fabrication of high temperature components through metal-ceramic joining. Parameters that have a marked impact on this interface reaction include the thermodynamic stability of the substrate, the properties of the modified interface, the temperature-dependent solubility limits of the liquids and solid phases, and the high-temperature stoichiometry of the ceramic.									11	3	0	0	0	0	14			1059-9495			WOS:000177827200008

To understand the mechanism behind such an interesting bifunctional catalyst, in the present study, we perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the dual catalytic cycle of H-2 and H2O oxidations by the iridium aqua complex. In the H-2 oxidation, we found that the H-H bond is easily cleaved in a heterolytic fashion, and the resultant iridium hydride complex is significantly stabilized by the presence of H2O molecules, due to dihydrogen bond. The rate-determining step of this reaction is found to be the H2O -> H-2 ligand substitution with an activation energy of 10.7 kcal/mol. In the H2O oxidation, an iridium oxo complex originating from an oxidation of the iridium aqua complex forms a hydroperoxide complex, where an O-O bond is formed with an activation energy of 21.0 kcal/mol. Such a relatively low activation barrier is possible only when at least two H2O molecules are present in the reaction, allowing the water nucleophilic attack (WNA) mechanism to take place. The present study suggests and discusses in detail six reaction steps required for the dual catalytic cycle to complete.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000470332200018	31094515

However, one major problem in metal catalysts, especially nonprecious-metal catalysts, is their poor stability in real catalytic processes. Recently, a novel and promising strategy to construct 2D materials encapsulating nonprecious-metal catalysts has exhibited inimitable advantages toward catalysis, especially under harsh conditions (e.g., strong acidity or alkalinity, high temperature, and high overpotential). The concept, which originates from unique electron penetration through the 2D crystal layer from the encapsulated metals to promote a catalytic reaction on the outermost surface of the 2D crystal, has been widely applied in a variety of reactions under harsh conditions. It has been vividly described as "chainmail for catalyst." Herein, recent progress concerning this chainmail catalyst is reviewed, particularly focusing on the structural design and control with the associated electronic properties of such heterostructure catalysts, and also on their extensive applications in fuel cells, water splitting, CO2 conversion, solar cells, metal-air batteries, and heterogeneous catalysis. In addition, the current challenges that are faced in fundamental research and industrial application, and future opportunities for these fantastic catalytic materials are discussed.									255	14	0	0	8	0	258			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000415142100001	28940838

In this work, layered double hydroxide (LDH)-based photocatalysts were investigated because of their flexible structural compositions. Deformation potential theory and Marcus theory were employed to calculate the carrier mobilities of electrons and holes in the orthogonal x, y and z directions of LDHs, respectively, revealing that the carrier mobilities of electrons and holes in the z direction (i.e., along the (110) facet) of LDHs are close to 0 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), while those in the x and y directions (i.e., along the (003) facet) range from 0.01 to 1196.70 cm(2) V-1 s(-1). Therefore, carriers can only move along the (003) facet in the x and y directions. Moreover, the polarities of LDHs in the x and y directions can be finely modified by changing the metal species in the LDH matrix so as to suppress the carrier recombination. Thus, two approaches for suppressing the carrier recombination in LDH-based photocatalysts are proposed: (1) decreasing the number of layers in the z direction of LDHs, and (2) adjusting the metal species in the LDH matrix to modify the polarities, which may be appropriate for other supramolecular photocatalysts with host-guest structures.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000689712100001

However, these state-of-the-art technologies require the use of expensive noble metal-based electrocatalysts, which significantly undermine the feasibility of their commercial success. The introduction of less expensive elements into the noble metal-based electrocatalysts, namely, doping, has become common in nanocatalysis research because of the lower catalyst preparation costs. Interestingly, recent studies have revealed additional roles of dopants in noble metal catalysts; doping can enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity by modulating the band structure, optimizing the surface energy of the catalysts, controlling the binding strength of adsorbates, and thus affecting the reaction kinetics. Dopants can also intervene in the nanocrystal growth mechanism, leading to shape- and phase-controlled nanocrystals. This review discusses the great versatility of dopants in nanoparticle-based catalysis in all aspects, from nanocrystal growth to nanocatalyst performance. The future challenges and outlook for dopants in nanocrystals and their applications are further discussed.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000642452300001

Three zeolites with different hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance were used, in order to determine the possible effect of this parameter. On glassy carbon (GC) modified with 80-20 % graphite-zeolite mixtures the voltammetric peak charge of 2-CP oxidation was higher than that on GC modified with graphite alone, clearly showing a catalytic effect of the zeolites. ZSM-5 was the more active zeolite, probably due to its hydrophobic character, which should favor its interaction with the also hydrophobic 2-CP. In agreement with this, the charge-transfer resistance of GC modified with a graphite-ZSM-5 mixture was about half that of GC modified with graphite alone, and its double-layer capacity about 50 % higher, indicating a modification of the interface which favours the reaction. On the contrary, for 2,4,6-TCP both the oxidation peak charge, and the charge-transfer resistance, for GC electrodes modified with graphite-zeolite mixtures was about the same as that of GC modified with graphite alone. This lack of catalytic action could be due to the fact that the oxidation of 2,4,6-TCP requires the release of at least one chlorine atom, this release being so difficult that it cannot be promoted by any of the zeolites studied. However, in prolonged galvanostatic electrolysis practically all the current went to the oxidation of 2,4,6-TCP, while in the case of 2-CP only a small fraction was oxidized. Probably with 2-CP at long times surface poisoning blocked the reaction, as reflected by the fact that the electrolysis potential rose to a value 0.2 V higher than that reached by TCP, and so high that most of the current went to oxygen evolution. The zeolites ZA and ZY decreased the mineralization of 2,4,6-TCP, since they promoted a one-electron oxidation reaction, so that its concentration at 80 min was about 80 % of that observed with graphite alone. The oxidation of 2-CP was not significantly affected by any zeolite as compared with that on graphite.					21st meeting of the Iberoamerican-Electrochemical-Society21st meeting of the Iberoamerican-Electrochemical-Society	APR 06-11, 2014APR 06-11, 2014		La Serena, CHILELa Serena, CHILE	15	0	0	0	2	1	15			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000344778900007

It is postulated that metal and oxide are active sites for the adsorption of hydrogen/proton and hydroxide ions, respectively. Of particular interest are the so-called buried interfaces. To investigate processes governing activity and stability at such interfaces, we prepare model Pd and Pt electrocatalysts which are fully covered by thin CeOx films. We investigate how oxide thickness influences HOR activity and dissolution stability of the electrocatalysts. It is found that materials behave very differently and that only Pd exhibits an enhanced HOR activity, while both oxide-protected metals are more stable toward dissolution. A 10-fold decrease in dissolution and 15-fold increase in HOR exchange current density are demonstrated for the optimized Pd/CeOx composites in comparison to pure Pd. We assess the mechanism of the electrocatalytic improvement as well as the role of the protective oxide films in such systems through advanced electrochemical and physical analysis. It is highlighted that a uniform, semipermeable oxide layer with a maximized electrocatalyst-oxide interface is crucial to form HOR catalysts with improved activity and stability.									25	1	0	0	2	0	24			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000575419000014

Light-minus-dark difference optical and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies were applied to monitor electron transfer from bound divalent metal ions to the photo-oxidized bacteriochlorophyll dimer in the presence of five different anions. At pH 7, bicarbonate was found to be the most effective for both manganese and iron binding, with dissociation constants around 1 mu M in three of the mutants. The pH dependence of the dissociation constants for manganese revealed that only bicarbonate and acetate were able to facilitate the binding and oxidation of the metal ion between pH 6 and 8 where the tight binding in their absence could not otherwise be established. The data are consistent with two molecules of bicarbonate or one molecule of acetate binding to the metal binding site. For ferrous ion, the binding and oxidation was facilitated not only by bicarbonate and acetate, but also by citrate. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra suggest differences in the arrangement of the iron ligands in the presence of the various anions.									11	0	0	0	7	0	11			0006-3495	1542-0086		WOS:000266377100031	19383473

The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a major event causally linked to the development of cardiovascular complications throughout the evolution of DM. Recently, monoamine oxidases (MAOs) at the outer mitochondrial membrane, with 2 isoforms, MAO-A and MAO-B, have emerged as novel sources of constant hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production in the cardiovascular system via the oxidative deamination of biogenic amines and neurotransmitters. Whether MAOs are mediators of endothelial dysfunction in DM is unknown, and so we studied this in a streptozotocin-induced rat model of diabetes. MAO expression (mRNA and protein) was increased in both arterial samples and hearts isolated from the diabetic animals. Also, H2O2 production (ferrous oxidation - xylenol orange assay) in aortic samples was significantly increased, together with an impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation (organ-bath studies). MAO inhibitors (clorgyline and selegiline) attenuated ROS production by 50% and partially normalized the endothelium-dependent relaxation in diseased vessels. In conclusion, MAOs, in particular the MAO-B isoform, are induced in aortas and hearts in the streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat model and contribute, via the generation of H2O2, to the endothelial dysfunction associated with experimental diabetes.									43	0	1	0	32	0	43			0008-4212	1205-7541		WOS:000357272900008	25996256

We carried out an RNAi screen in Drosophila S2 cells to better understand the regulatory mechanisms governing Nrf2 target gene expression. This paper describes the identification and characterization of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) kinase Cdk12 as a factor that is required for Nrf2 target gene expression in cell culture and in vivo. Cdk12 is, however, not essential for bulk mRNA transcription and cells lacking CDK12 function are viable and able to proliferate. Consistent with previous findings on the DNA damage and heat shock responses, it emerges that Cdk12 may be specifically required for stress activated gene expression. Transcriptome analysis revealed that antioxidant gene expression is compromised in flies with reduced Cdk12 function, which makes them oxidative stress sensitive. In addition to supporting Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) induced gene activation, Cdk12 suppresses genes that support metabolic functions in stressed conditions. We suggest that Cdk12 acts as a gene-selective Pol II kinase that engages a global shift in gene expression to switch cells from a metabolically active state to "stress-defence mode" when challenged by external stress.									21	4	0	0	21	0	26			2045-2322			WOS:000370784600001	26911346

A three-domain model is developed for six surfaces [rutile (110), (100), and (001), and anatase (101), (100), and (001)] which describes waters as "hard" (irreversibly bound to the surface), "soft" (with reduced mobility but orientation freedom near the surface), or "bulk." The model explains previous experimental data and provides a detailed picture of water diffusion near TiO2 surfaces. Water reactivity is analyzed with a graph-theoretic approach that reveals a number of reaction pathways on TiO2 which occur at full hydration, in addition to direct water splitting. Hydronium (H3O+) is identified to be a key intermediate state, which facilitates water dissociation by proton hopping between intact and dissociated waters near the surfaces. These discoveries significantly improve the understanding of nanoscale water dynamics and reactivity at TiO2 interfaces under ambient conditions.

Inspired by the high catalytic activity of low-dimensional single-atom catalysts for CO2RR and the enhanced stability of 1T'-MoS2 when embedded transition metals, herein, the catalytic mechanisms of transition metal-modified 1T'-MoS2 monolayers (denoted as TM@1T'-MoS2, where TM is 3d-5d transition metals except Y, Tc, Cd, Hg and La-Lu) in reducing CO2 to CH4 have been systematically investigated via the first-principles calculations. The results show that compared to pristine 1T'-MoS2, embedding transition metals can enrich the varieties of the CO2RR products. Among the considered catalysts, we find that Ru@1T'-MoS2 and Pt@1T'-MoS2 can catalyze CO2 reduction to CH4 and CH3OH with acceptable limiting potentials of-0.56 and-0.73 V, respectively. Besides, Re@1T'-MoS2 and Zn@1T'-MoS2 are considered to be the promising catalysts for HCOOH generation with the ultralow limiting potentials of -0.13 and -0.22 V, respectively. This work will provide useful insights to guide the design of TMD-based catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000793722500003

Here, genome-derived models of Escherichia coli (E. coli) metabolism were used for FBA and C-13-MFA analyses of aerobic and anaerobic growths of wild-type E. coli (K-12 MG1655) cells. Validated MFA flux maps reveal that the fraction of maintenance ATP consumption in total ATP production is about 14% higher under anaerobic (51.1%) than aerobic conditions (37.2%). FBA revealed that an increased ATP utilization is consumed by ATP synthase to secrete protons from fermentation. The TCA cycle is shown to be in complete in aerobically growing cells and submaximal grow this due to limited oxidative phosphorylation. An FBA was successful in predicting product secretion rates in aerobic culture if both glucose and oxygen up take measurement were constrained, but the most-frequently predicted values of internal fluxes yielded from sampling the feasible space differ substantially from MFA-derived fluxes.

Atomically dispersed metal-nitrogen-doped carbon (M-N-C) materials are superior catalysts for electrocatalytic CO2RR because of the 100% atomic utilization, unsaturated coordination configuration, relatively uniform active sites, and well-defined and adjustable structure of active centers. However, the electrochemical CO2RR is a great challenge due to the process involving proton-coupled multi-electron transfer with a high energy barrier, which leads to unsatisfactory selectivity to the targeted product, especially for C2 products (e.g., C2H4 and C2H5OH). Here, the authors systematically summarize effective means, including reasonable selection of isolated metal sites, regulation of the coordination environment of isolated metal atoms, and fabrication of dimetallic single-atom sites for attaining optimal geometric and electronic structures of M-N-C materials and further correlate these structures with catalytic selectivity to various C1 (e.g., CO and CH4) and C2 products in the CO2RR. Moreover, constructive strategies to further optimize M-N-C materials for electrocatalytic CO2RR are provided. Finally, the challenges and future research directions of the application of M-N-C materials for electrocatalytic CO2RR are proposed.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000753265900001

Carbon dioxide (CO2) was employed as a reaction medium in the pyrolysis to induce desired effects associated with CO2; (1) the enhanced thermal cracking of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) evolved from the thermal degradation of biomass, and (2) the direct reaction between CO2 and VOCs, which resulted in the enhanced generation of syngas H-2 and CO). This study placed main emphases on three parts: (1) the role of impregnated Co in pyrolysis of lignin in the presence of CO2, (2) the characterization of Co/lignin biochar, and (3) evaluation of catalytic capability of Co-lignin biochar in BrO3 reduction. The findings from the pyrolysis experiments strongly evidenced that the desired CO2 effects were strengthened due to catalytic effect of impregnated Co in lignin. For example, the enhanced generation of syngas from pyrolysis of Coimpregnated lignin in CO2 was more significant than the case without Co impregnation. Moreover, pyrolysis of Coimpregnated lignin in CO2 led to production of biochar of which surface area (599 m(2) g(-1)) is nearly 100 times greater than the biochar produced in N-2 (6.6 m(2) g(-1)). Co/lignin biochar produced in CO2 also showed a great performance in catalyzing BrO3 reduction as compared to the biochar produced in N-2.									41	1	0	0	20	0	42			1944-8244			WOS:000399965700026	28362484

The massif consists of a thick (>4 km) sequence, composed from the base upward of tectonized harzburgite with minor dunite, a transitional zone of dunite, and a magmatic sequence of wehrlite, pyroxenite, troctolite and gabbro. Only sparse, refractory chromitites occur within the basal clinopyroxene-bearing harzburgites, whereas the upper and middle parts of the peridotite sequence contain abundant metallurgical chromitites. The transition zone dunites contain a few thin layers of metallurgical chromitite and sparse bodies are also present in the cumulate section. The Bulqiza Ophiolite shows major changes in thickness, like the 41-50 wt.% MgO composition similar with forearc peridotite as a result of its complex evolution in a suprasubduction zone (SSZ) environment. The peridotites show abundant evidence of mantle melt extraction at various scales as the orthopyroxene composition change from core to rim, and mineral compositions suggest formation in a forearc, as Fo values of olivine are in 91.1-93.0 harzburgite and 91.5-91.9 in dunite and 94.6-95.9 in massive chromitite. The composition of the melts passing through the peridotites changed gradually from tholeiite to boninite due to melt-rock reaction, leading to more High Cr# chromitites in the upper part of the body. Most of the massive and disseminated chromitites have high Cr# numbers (70-80), although there are systematic changes in olivine and magnesiochromite compositions from harzburgites, to dunite envelopes to massive chromitites, reflecting melt-rock reaction. Compositional zoning of orthopyroxene porphyroblasts in the harzburgite, incongruent melting of orthopyroxene and the presence of small, interstitial grains of spinel, olivine and pyroxene likewise attest to modification by migrating melts. All of the available evidence suggests that the Bulqiza Ophiolite formed in a suprasubduction zone mantle wedge. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

These ore bodies, which consist of gold-bearing hydrothermal veins and mineralized siltstone with disseminated sulfides, formed in three stages: quartz-sulfides-native gold (I), arsenopyrite-calcite-native gold (II), and quartz-calcite (III) stages. The microthermometric and laser Raman spectroscopic analysis of the fluid inclusions in stage I-quartz demonstrate that the ore-forming fluid was moderate temperature (353-392 degrees C), low-salinity (2.9-5.3 wt% NaCl equiv.), and H2O-CH4-dominant. The thermodynamic modeling of the Au-Cu-As-Fe-S system performed using the SUPCRT92 software package with the updated database of slop16.dat indicates that a decrease in H2S activity (a(H2S)) and oxygen fugacity (fO(2)) were responsible for reducing the solubilities of As and Au, which might be responsible for the coexistence of arsenopyrite and native gold. The decreases in a(H2S) and fO(2) caused by phase separation and fluid-rock reactions induced the precipitation of native gold in the quartz-sulfides-native gold stage. Graphite-bearing siltstone, which may lower the fO(2) of ore-forming fluids, is thus an important indicator of prospective gold deposits.									5	2	0	0	0	0	6			0375-6742	1879-1689		WOS:000458515700005

The pre-ceramic samples were obtained by crosslinking a commercially available polysilazane with divinylbenzene in a highly diluted solution. Wet gels were supercritically dried using CO2 to get the pre-ceramic aerogel. The weight change during pyrolysis in flowing argon was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (in-situ measurements) and by measuring the weight change on samples pyrolyzed in a tubular furnace after cooling down to room temperature (ex-situ measurements). The structural transformation was followed by infrared spectroscopy while the microstructural changes were studied by nitrogen adsorption analysis. Results point out that samples pyrolyzed at intermediate temperature, i.e., around 600-800 degrees C, react with the laboratory atmosphere forming Si-O bonds and Si OH moieties. This out-of-furnace oxidation leads to an uncontrolled increase of the oxygen content of the pyrolyzed ceramics and eventually reduces the microporosity of the samples and its stability.

However, devising ZnS photocatalysts with a high overall quantum efficiency has been a challenge due to the rapid recombination rates of charge carriers. Various strategies, including the control of size and morphology of ZnS nanoparticles, have been proposed to overcome these drawbacks. In this work, ZnS samples with different morphologies were prepared from zinc and sulphur powders via a facile hydrothermal method by varying the amount of sodium borohydride used as a reducing agent. The structural properties of the ZnS nanoparticles were analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. All-electron hybrid density functional theory calculations were employed to elucidate the effect of sulphur and zinc vacancies occurring in the bulk as well as (220) surface on the overall electronic properties and absorption of ZnS. Considerable differences in the defect level positions were observed between the bulk and surface of ZnS while the adsorption of NaBH4 was found to be highly favourable but without any significant effect on the band gap of ZnS. The photocatalytic activity of ZnS was evaluated for the degradation of rhodamine B dye under UV irradiation and hydrogen generation from water. The ZnS nanoparticles photo-catalytically degraded Rhodamine B dye effectively, with the sample containing 0.01 mol NaBH4 being the most efficient. The samples also showed activity for hydrogen evolution, but with less H-2 produced compared to when untreated samples of ZnS were used. These findings suggest that ZnS nanoparticles are effective photocatalysts for the degradation of rhodamine B dyes as well as the hydrogen evolution, but rapid recombination of charge carriers remains a factor that needs future optimization.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2296-2646			WOS:000796249000001	35494625

To interpret this carbon deficit problem, the carbonaceous component in grains must have been converted into the gas phase in the inner regions of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) prior to planetary formation. We examine the effect of carbon grain destruction on the chemical structure of disks by calculating the molecular abundances and distributions using a comprehensive chemical reaction network. When carbon grains are destroyed and the elemental abundance of the gas becomes carbon-rich, the abundances of carbon-bearing molecules, such as HCN and carbon-chain molecules, increase dramatically near the midplane, while oxygen-bearing molecules, such as H2O and CO2, are depleted. We compare the results of these model calculations with the solid carbon-to-silicon fraction in the solar system. Although we find a carbon depletion gradient, there are some quantitative discrepancies: the model shows a higher value at the position of the asteroid belt and a lower value at the location of Earth. In addition, using the obtained molecular abundance distributions, coupled with line radiative transfer calculations, we make predictions for ALMA to potentially observe the effect of carbon grain destruction in nearby PPDs. The results indicate that HCN, (HCN)-C-13, and c-C3H2 may be good tracers.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000456063900010

However, the severe photo-generated carriers recombi-nation and deficient active sites, as the two major obstacles, blocks the PEC water splitting reduction. Herein, we fabricated CdS photoanodes and employ the piezoelectric polarization as built-in electric field for facilitating the photo-generated carriers. Furthermore, S-vacancies are introduced into CdS photoanodes to supply abundant active sites and reduce the band gap of CdS. More importantly, the collaborative mechanism of S-vacancies and piezoelectric polarization for boosting PEC performance of CdS photoanodes is reveled in our study: S-vacancies sites are easier to become the stress point for stimulating the piezoelectric polarization under external force; the number of active sites further increase and S-vacancies produced electrons participate in water splitting reaction during piezoelectric polarization. The mechanism can tackle above-mentioned key challenges and our work provides a promising strategy for designing high efficiency photoelectrodes in PEC water splitting.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000795928000004

In this study, a selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase 3 cDNAs (designated as SpGPx3) was obtained from the mud crab Scylla paramamosain. The open reading frame (ORF) of SpGPx3 was 639 bp, which encoded a putative protein of 212 amino acids. SpGPx3 protein contained a characteristic GPx signature motif, and an active site motif. Mud crabs were exposed to 20 mg L-1 nitrite for 72 h. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that the SpGPx3 mRNA was distributed abundantly in mud crab. The transcript levels of antioxidant enzyme genes (SpGPx3, SpSOD and SpCAT) were obviously induced after acute nitrite exposure. After knockdown of the SpGPx3 level, the mortality of mud crabs and malondialdehyde (MDA) content significantly increased under nitrite stress. These results suggested that SpGPx3 played an important role in protecting organisms against oxidative stress.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			1532-0456	1878-1659		WOS:000515442900002	31760077

Elaborate TEM studies demonstrate that by varying the pyrolysis time. temperature and duration, the crystallinity of the transient fluorite phase can be greatly influenced. Pyrolysis at 350degreesC leads to the formation of a well crystallized fluorite phase with a cubic structure (Fd3m space group) and a = 10.5-10.6 Angstrom. Rapid crystallization of the transient fluorite phase is attributed to the low oxygen partial pressure conditions, prevailing during burnoff of acetate groups originating from the lead starting compound. A possible connection between the fluorite formation kinetics and orientation selection in the layers is discussed.

Based on this consideration, multiplex compounds of Ni, Cu, Co-based mixed-metal oxyphosphide nanowires arrays supported on nickel foams have been designed and fabricated successfully via an improved surfactant-assisted route, in which a facile hydrothermal reaction produced homogenously mixed Ni, Cu, Co-precursors and the following controllable oxidation and phosphidation were used to produce the oxyphosphide products. Different from traditional binary transition metal oxides or phosphides, three different kinds of metal cations and binary anions of O and P were introduced here and resulted in an enhanced synergistic effect to promote more efficient electrochemical reaction activity with Li+. Benefiting from the rational design of multiplex composition and the excellent 3D integrated structures assembled with 1D mesoporous nanowires, the obtained Ni, Cu, Co-based oxyphosphides exhibited remarkable lithium storage performance with high reversible capacities of 1354.6 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at the current density of 500 mA g(-1) and excellent rate capability.

Much work has been done to construct nanostructured or doped carbon as a porous or polar host for promising sulfur cathodes, although restricting the polysulfide shuttle effect by improving the redox reaction kinetics is more attractive. Herein, we present a well-designed strategy by introducing graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) into a three-dimensional hierarchical porous graphene assembly to achieve a synergistic combination of confinement and catalyzation of polysulfides. The porous g-C3N4 nanosheets in situ formed inside the graphene network afford a highly accessible surface to catalyze the transformation of polysulfides, and the hierarchical porous graphene-assembled carbon can function as a conductive network and provide appropriate space for g-C3N4 catalysis in the sulfur cathode. Thus, this hybrid can effectively improve sulfur utilization and block the dissolution of polysulfides, achieving excellent cycling performance for sulfur cathodes in lithium-sulfur batteries.									76	6	0	0	3	0	78			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000433048600048

The initial and oxidized resinite samples were analyzed for variations in molecular structure by the use of Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) photoacoustic spectroscopy and H-1 and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The changes in molecular structure determined were correlated with differences observed in optical reflectance and fluorescence properties.The resinite in its initial state was predominantly aliphatic in nature and could be characterized as a diterpenoid, with alkene and carboxylic functionalities exocyclic to the six-membered rings composing the diterpenoid skeleton. Oxidation between 50-degrees-C and 100-degrees-C resulted in only minor structural changes. During oxidation between 100-degrees-C and 250-degrees-C there were very significant changes, involving the diminution in the number of aliphatic C-H structures, the complete loss of the exocyclic alkene function, the appearance of aromatic structures and the conversion of carboxylic acids to acid anhydrides. Above 250-degrees-C, aliphatic groups continued to decline in number, aromatic character continued to increase and spectroscopic features, attributable to acid anhydrides, achieved maximum intensity.The optical reflectance of resinite increased with increasing oxidation temperature and the trends in reflectance and fluorescence properties (colour, wavelength of maximum intensity and red/green quotient) could be ascribed, as reported in earlier studies, to: (1) chemisorption, which occurs between 25-degrees and 100-degrees-C, and decomposition of chemisorbed components at 100-150-degrees-C; (2) oxycoal formation (150-300-degrees-C), in which oxygen complexes and oxidation rims develop; and (3) combustion (> 350-degrees-C). The variations in mass, infrared peak ratio (C-H/C=O), fraction of aromatic carbon (f(a)) and fraction of hydrogen attached to aromatic carbon (H(ar)), with the variation in the temperature of oxidation mirrored the changes observed by optical microscopy.The results show that the physical changes observed by optical microscopy have a direct correlation with the molecular structural changes determined by FT-IR and NMR spectroscopy. Additionally, it has been observed that resinites underwent thermal aromatization, a phenomenon not well studied for these materials. The changes observed in oxidation structures can be related to reactions involving thermal dehydrogenation of the diterpenoid ring structures and those involving oxygen addition. Oxygen inclusion occurs at all temperatures above 100-degrees-C, whereas thermal aromatization occurs mainly above 250-degrees-C.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0166-5162			WOS:A1993KY64200002

In this TiO2/CdS/Co-Pi photoanode, the Co-Pi WOC acts as hole transfer relay to accelerate the surface water oxidation reaction, CdS serves as light absorber for wider solar spectra harvesting, and TiO2 matrix provides direct pathway for electron transport. This triple TiO2/CdS/Co-Pi hybrid photoanode exhibits much enhanced photocurrent density and negatively shifts in onset potential, resulting in 1.5 and 3.4 times improved photoconversion efficiency compared to the TiO2/CdS and TiO2 photoanode, respectively. More importantly, the TiO2/CdS/Co-Pi shows significantly improved photo-electrochemical stability compared to the TiO2/CdS electrode, with approximate to 72% of the initial photocurrent retained after 2 h irradiation. The reason for the promoted performance is discussed in detail based on electrochemical measurements. This work provides a new paradigm for designing 1D nanoframework/light absorber/WOC photoanode to simultaneously enhance light absorption, charge separation, and transport and surface water oxidation reaction for efficient and stable solar fuel production.									218	16	0	0	10	0	219			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000362517300017

Tubular C3N4 with carbon vacancy was fabricated by facile pyrolysis of the hydrolyzed melamine-urea mixture under N-2 gas. With the particular structural merits for tubular nanostructure and the introduction of suitable carbon vacancy density, richly available surface defect sites, and accelerated separation and transfer of photo-generated charge carriers, the as-prepared carbon vacancy modified C3N4 nanotubes exhibited an excellent photocatalytic NO oxidation performance. Based on ESR measurement and DFT calculation, the electronic structure of carbon vacancy was revealed. The surface carbon vacancy in C3N4 nanotubes can greatly facilitate the adsorption of NO and O-2, therefore, leading to its superior photocatalytic selectivity in conversion of NO to NO3-. The present work provides new insights into the understanding of defective semiconductor photocatalysis.									117	10	0	0	23	0	118			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000501613700025

The effects of the solvent type, oxygen level, and reaction temperature on the monomer conversion and polymer average molecular weights were investigated. Three solvents, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; polar, aprotic), cyclohexanone (polar, aprotic), and xylene (nonpolar) were used. The spontaneous thermal polymerization of MA and nBA in DMSO resulted in a lower conversion and higher average molecular weights in comparison to polymerization in cyclohexanone and xylene under the same conditions. The highest final conversion of both monomers was obtained in cyclohexanone. The high polymerization rate in cyclohexanone was most likely due to an additional initiation mechanism where cyclohexanone complexed with the monomer to generate free radicals. Bubbling air through the mixture led to a higher monomer conversion during the early stage of the polymerization and a lower polymer average molecular weight in xylene and cyclohexanone; this indicated the existence of a distinct behavior between the air- and nitrogen-purged systems. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis of the polymer samples taken from nitrogen-bubbled batches did not reveal fragments from initiating impurities. On the basis of the identified families of peaks, monomer self-initiation is suggested as the principal mode of initiation in the spontaneous thermal polymerization of MA and nBA at temperatures above 100 degrees C.

Achieving this goal, developing a photocatalyst to simultaneously manifest high efficiency, selectivity, and durability is urgent need. Herein, one of all-inorganic cesium lead halide perovskite (viz. Cs4PbBr6) with hole-in-microdisk structure hybridized with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is reported as an effective photocatalyst for reducing of CO2. Our results show that Cs4PbBr6/rGO exhibited high efficiency, selectivity, and durability of CO2 reduction capacity to CO, catalyzing at a rate of 11.4 mu mol g(-1)h(-1) with a maintaining stability of 60 h. Residual oxygen impurities as defects in the rGO sheets are demonstrated for facilitating CO2 activation and reduction capacity to CO. This finding provides a facile pathway for designing high performance perovskite photocatalyst with high selectivity and durability with the aid of defects engineering.									43	4	0	0	5	0	43			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000596610800005

While bulk SnO2 was obtained by relatively slow pyrolysis in conventional horizontal tube furnace. The effect of process parameters on the microstructure and morphology of SNPCs/SUFs mats was discussed. I-V characteristics of the SNPCs/SUFs mats revealed a nonlinear curve, indicating the formation of Schottky-type junctions. The composite fibers mats also exhibited broad and strong emission bands between 400 and 650 nm. This may be attributed to the existence of a large amount of oxygen vacancies and defects in SNPCs caused by the fast pyrolysis process. Such composite fibers mats may have great potentials in high-temperature gas sensors, light-emitting diodes and lithium-ion storages, etc. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

I. Hydrodynamics								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				637	2			922	936		10.1086/498426				FEB 1 2006	2006	We introduce a low Mach number equation set for the large- scale numerical simulation of carbon- oxygen white dwarfs experiencing a thermonuclear deflagration. Since most of the interesting physics in a Type Ia supernova transpires at Mach numbers from 0.01 to 0.1, such an approach enables both a considerable increase in accuracy and a savings in computer time compared with frequently used compressible codes. Our equation set is derived from the fully compressible equations using low Mach number asymptotics, but without any restriction on the size of perturbations in density or temperature. Comparisons with simulations that use the fully compressible equations validate the lowMach number model in regimes where both are applicable. Comparisons to simulations based on the more traditional anelastic approximation also demonstrate the agreement of these models in the regime for which the anelastic approximation is valid. For low Mach number flows with potentially finite amplitude variations in density and temperature, the low Mach number model overcomes the limitations of each of the more traditional models and can serve as the basis for an accurate and efficient simulation tool.									106	1	0	0	0	0	107			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000235131600035

Toward these targets the interstellar abundances of Ar I, and sometimes N I, are significantly below their cosmic abundances relative to H I. In the diffuse interstellar medium, these elements are not likely to be depleted onto dust grains. Generally, we expect that Ar should be more strongly ionized than H (and also O and N, whose ionizations are coupled to that of H via charge-exchange reactions) because the cross section for the photoionization of Ar I is very high. Our finding that Ar I/H I is low may help to explain the surprisingly high ionization of He in the LISM found by other investigators. Our result favors the interpretation that the ionization of the local medium is maintained by a strong extreme-ultraviolet flux from nearby stars and hot gases, rather than an incomplete recovery from a past, more highly ionized condition.									94	0	0	0	0	0	94			0004-637X			WOS:000088706100019

Efforts to optimize these systems have been slowed by an inadequate understanding of the semiconductor-electrocatalyst (semlcat) interface. The semlcat interface is important because it separates and collects photoexcited charge carriers from the semiconductor. The photovoltage generated by the interface drives "uphill" photochemical reactions, such as water splitting to form hydrogen fuel. Here we describe efforts to understand the microscopic processes and materials parameters governing interfacial. electron transfer between light-absorbing semi conductors, electrocatalysts, and solution.We highlight the properties of transition-metal oxyhydroxide electrocatalysts, such as Ni(Fe)OOH, because they are the fastest oxygen-evolution catalysts known in alkaline media and are (typically) permeable to electrolyte. We describe the physics that govern the charge-transfer kinetics for different interface types, and show how numerical simulations can explain the response of composite systems. Emphasis is placed on "limiting" behavior. Electrocatalysts that are permeable to electrolyte form "adaptive" junctions where the interface energetics change during operation as charge accumulates in the catalyst, but is screened locally by electrolyte ions. Electrocatalysts that are dense, and thus impermeable to electrolyte, form buried junctions where the interface physics are unchanged during operation.Experiments to directly measure the interface behavior and test the theory/simulations are challenging because conventional photoelectrochemical techniques do not measure the electrocatalyst potential during operation. We developed dual-working electrode (DWE) photoelectrochemistry to address this limitation. A second electrode is attached to the catalyst layer to sense or control current/voltage independent from that of the semiconductor back ohmic contact. Consistent with simulations, electrolyte-permeable, redox-active catalysts such as Ni(Fe)OOH form "adaptive" junctions where the effective barrier height for electron exchange depends on the potential of the catalyst. This is in contrast to semlcat interfaces with dense electrolyte impermeable catalysts, such as nanocrystalline IrOx, that behave like solid-state buried (Schottky-like) junctions.These results elucidate a design principle for catalyzed photoelectrodes. The buried heterojunctions formed by dense catalysts are often limited by Fermi-level pinning and low photovoltages. Catalysts deposited by "soft" methods, such as electrodeposition, form adaptive junctions that tend to provide larger photovoltages and efficiencies. We also preview efforts to improve theory/simulations to account for the presence of surface states and discuss the prospect of carrier-selective catalyst contacts.									222	5	0	0	19	1	222			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000374706800016	27035051

However, the exact role(s) of cyt b559 in the cyclic electron transfer pathway(s) in PSII remains unclear. To study the exact role(s) of cyt b559, we have constructed a series of site-directed mutants, each carrying a single amino acid substitution of one of the heme axial-ligands, in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. In these mutants, His-22 of the alpha or the beta subunit of cyt b559 was replaced with either Met, Gin, Tyr, Lys, Arg, Cys or Gln. On the basis of oxygen-evolution and chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements, we found that, among all mutants that were constructed, only the H22K alpha mutant grew photoautotrophically, and accumulated stable PSII reaction centers (similar to 81% compared to wild-type cells). In addition, we isolated one pseudorevertant of the H22Y beta mutant that regained the ability to grow photoautotrophically and to assemble stable PSII reaction centers (similar to 79% compared to wild-type cells). On the basis of 77 K fluorescence emission measurements, we found that energy transfer from the phycobilisomes to PSII reaction centers was uncoupled in those cyt b559 mutants that assembled little or no stable PSII. Furthermore, on the basis of immunoblot analyses, we found that in thylakoid membranes of cyt b559 mutants that assembled little or no PSII, the amounts of the D1, D2, cyt B559 alpha and beta polypeptides were very low or undetectable but their CP47 and PsaC polypeptides were accumulated to the wild-type level. We also found that the amounts of cyt b559 polypeptide were significantly increased (larger than two folds) in thylakoid membranes of cyt b559 H22Y beta PS+ mutant cells. We suspected that the increase in the amounts of cyt b559 H22Y beta PS+ mutant polypeptides in thylakoid membranes might facilitate the assembly of functional PSII in cyt b559 H22Y beta PS+ mutant cells. Moreover, we found that isolated His-tagged PSII particles from H22K alpha mutant cells gave rise to redox-induced optical absorption difference spectra of cyt b559. Therefore, our results concluded that significant fractions of H22K alpha mutant PSII particles retained the heme of cyt b559. Finally, this work is the first report of cyt b559 mutants having substitutions of an axial heme-ligands that retain the ability to grow photoautotrophically and to assemble stable PSII reaction centers.

While the shape control of Au nanoparticles (NPs) is crucial for moderate bandgap semiconductors, because plasmonic resonance by interband excitations overlaps above the absorption edge of semiconductors, its critical role in water splitting is still not fully understood. Here, first, the plasmonic effects of shape-controlled Au NPs on bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) are studied, and a largely enhanced photoactivity of BiVO4 is reported by introducing the octahedral Au NPs. The octahedral Au NP/BiVO4 achieves 2.4 mA cm(-2) at the 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, which is the threefold enhancement compared to BiVO4. It is the highest value among the previously reported plasmonic Au NPs/BiVO4. Improved photoactivity is attributed to the localized surface plasmon resonance; direct electron transfer (DET), plasmonic resonant energy transfer (PRET). The PRET can be stressed over DET when considering the moderate bandgap semiconductor. Enhanced water oxidation induced by the shape-controlled Au NPs is applicable to moderate semiconductors, and shows a systematic study to explore new efficient plasmonic solar water splitting cells.									39	3	0	0	2	0	40			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000412167100011	28834195

In this work, hollow copper-doped graphitic carbon nitride (gC3N4) microspheres with outstanding photocatalytic H2O2 production ability are prepared. The characterization results demonstrate that Cu+ is not present as the oxide but instead inserts at the interstitial position through coordinative Cu(I)-N bonds. These Cu(I)-N active sites can act as chemical adsorption sites to activate molecular O-2. Moreover, as an "electron transfer bridge", Cu(I)-N active sites promote electron transfer from the catalyst to the adsorbed O-2 molecules. The as-prepared copper-doped g-C3N4 displays much higher H2O2 equilibrium concentration and formation rate than neat g-C3N4 prepared by calcination does, as well as excellent structural stability. Density functional theory simulations show that Cu(I)-N active sites can adsorb the O-2 molecules with high adsorption energy and elongate the O = O bond. Charge density difference results confirm the electron transfer from the Cu+ doping sites to the O-2 molecules. The Mulliken charge is -0.51 when the O-2 adsorbed on Cu+ doping sites. This electron-rich environment is beneficial to the H+ attack to form H2O2.									102	13	0	0	11	0	107			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000418533400040

The evolution of GO to RGO has been characterized by X-ray diffraction, UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that the atomic ratio of carbon to oxygen in the RGO can be tuned from 1.67 to 13.7 through controlling the reduction time. Moreover, the conductivity of the RGO is measured to be 26.9 +/- 2.2 kS/m, much larger than those previously obtained by chemical reduction through other reducing agents. More importantly, the resistance of the RGO film with 20 nm thickness can be as low as 2 k Omega/square, while a high transparency over 70% within a broad spectral range from 0.45 mu m to 1.50 mu m can be retained. The proposed method is low-cost, eco-friendly and highly-efficient, the as-prepared thinner RGO films are useful in a variety of potential application fields such as optoelectronics, photovoltaics and electrochemistry by serving as an ultralight, flexible and transparent electrode material.									10	4	0	0	0	0	11			1674-0068	1003-7713		WOS:000309370700019

Hematite in the Marble Bar Chert from a NASA-funded drill hole (ABDP1) in the Pilbara craton, Australia, has been cited as evidence for an oxygenated ocean 3.46b.y.ago. However, isotopic data from the same drill hole have been used to argue for an anoxic ocean. It is generally agreed that the hematite is primary, representing either a direct hydrothermal precipitate or a dehydration product of iron oxyhydroxides that formed during anoxygenic photosynthesis. Here we present new petrographic evidence from the Marble Bar Chert (in drill hole ABDP1) that shows that hematite in jasper bands formed via mineral replacement reactions. The hematite mostly occurs as sub-micron-sized inclusions within chert (so-called "dusty" hematite) that are typically arranged into polygonal clusters surrounded by a rim of clear quartz, resembling shrinkage structures. The lateral transition from laminated chert enclosing minute inclusions of greenalite, siderite, and magnetite to chert dominated by dusty hematite provides evidence for in situ replacement of iron-bearing minerals. The presence of hematite-rich bands containing octahedral crystals with residual cores of magnetite indicates that some of the hematite was derived from the replacement of magnetite. This interpretation is supported by the widespread occurrence of magnetite in jasper displaying progressive stages of replacement, from unaltered octahedral inclusions in quartz to hematite pseudomorphs along quartz grain boundaries. The occurrence of dusty hematite in fractures, sedimentary laminae, and the outer margins of polygonal clusters containing greenalite is consistent with fluid-mediated oxidation of iron-rich precursor minerals. The presence of syn-sedimentary chert breccias comprising rotated fragments of laminated chert indicates that the precursor sediment was silicified shortly after deposition. The abundance of "dusty" greenalite inclusions, which are texturally the earliest components of the laminated chert, suggests that the precursor sediment contained an iron-rich clay mineral. Our results show that hematite has replaced ferrous-rich minerals after deposition and provide a mechanism to explain the origin of hematite in the Marble Bar Chert, which is consistent with the origin of hematite in adjacent basalts. A secondary origin for hematite invalidates arguments for an oxygen-bearing ocean similar to 3.46 b.y.ago and provides a viable explanation for the formation of Archean jasper bands. Our findings show that misinterpretations about the origin of hematite in early Precambrian cherts could lead to false conclusions about the chemistry of the ancient ocean and atmosphere.									21	2	0	0	4	0	23			0016-7606	1943-2674		WOS:000343758700007

The synthesized SnO2-CTAB, SnO2-SDBS and SnO2-SDS microparticles were successfully doped into beta-PbO2 film of PbO(2 )electrode through composite electrodeposition technology to obtain PbO2/SnO2 -CTAB, PbO2/SnO2-SDBS and PbO2/SnO2-SDS electrodes. Physical characterizations, electrochemical measurements and electrocatalytic oxidation of mnitrophenol (m-NP) were conducted to explore the electrocatalytic activity of prepared electrodes. The results showed that doping SnO2 was favorable to improve electro-catalytic activity of PbO2 electrode, which was attributed to that the SnO2 particles in B-PbO2 films improved the active sites on the surface, oxygen evolution potential and center dot OH radicals generation rate of the electrodes. The experimental results also revealed that the PbO2/SnO2-CTAB was most efficient in three PbO2/SnO2 electrodes due to the higher zeta potential, smaller particle size and higher specific surface area of SnO2-CTAB than those of SnO2-SDBS and SnO2-SDS. Besides, the accelerated lifetime test shows that the PbO2/SnO2 -CTAB electrode possessed longer service lifetime than PbO2/SnO2-SDBS, PbO2/SnO2-SDS and pristine PbO2 electrodes. Overall, the PbO2/SnO2-CTAB electrode is promising for environmental remediation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									32	0	0	0	9	0	32			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000511293800023		
J	Sherameti, I; Oelmuller, R								Newly synthesized PsbO is reversibly attached to the thylakoid membrane and released from the membrane under light stress								JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY				157	6			699	706		10.1016/S0176-1617(00)80014-0				DEC 2000	2000	The 33 kDa protein (PsbO) is an important component of the photosystem II reaction center and located at the lumenal side of the thylakoid membrane. in vivo labelling assays of tobacco seedlings and subsequent immunoprecipitation of PsbO revealed that newly synthesized PsbO is present in the lumen as soluble and membrane-associated forms. The latter form appears to be associated with photosystem II. Since membrane association also occurs in darkness and in the presence of chloramphenicol, no newly-formed photosystem II particles are required. Comparable features with regard to the membrane association and membrane release of PsbO were obtained with an in vitro reconstitution system. In contrast to the D1 protein, the overall amount of PsbO does not change significantly under light stress; however, the polypeptide appears to be released from the membranes and accumulates in the thylakoid lumen. Re-association with the membrane does not occur under light-stress conditions. The conclusion is that membrane association of PsbO is sensitive to high light intensitites.									0	0	0	0	1	0	1			0176-1617			WOS:000166148000014

In this study, the corrosion behaviors of Al-Y-coated specimens in a Li molten salt kept under an oxidizing atmosphere at 650 degrees C for 72 and 168 h were investigated. The weight loss fraction of the coated specimen to bare specimen was approximately 60% for 3% Li2O and 54% for 8% Li2O at 72 h, and approximately 38% for 3% Li2O and 30% for 8% Li2O at 168 h. Corrosion was induced in the LiCl-Li2O molten salt by the basic oxide ion O2- via the basic flux mechanism, and the corrosion product was found to be dependent on the activity of the O2- ion. The increase in weight loss may have been caused by the increase in the O2- concentration due to the increase in the Li2O concentration rather than being because of the increased reaction time. The Al-Y coating was found to be beneficial for hot corrosion resistance, which can be useful for handling high-temperature lithium molten salt under an oxidizing atmosphere.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2079-6412		WOS:000633575200001

The effect of annealing atmosphere on the electrochemical performance of 2D MOFs and their catalytic center structure have been investigated. The Co-MOF/H(2)synthesized by annealing of 2D MOF under a H(2)atmosphere has shown a significantly enhanced catalytic activity compared with those annealed under an Ar atmosphere (Co-MOF/Ar). The Co-MOF/H(2)has 2-3 graphitic layers of graphitic carbon coating and presents a large amount of high valent Co2+. H(2)annealing leads to a fast reduction of Co-MOF to Co/CoO(x)nanoparticles and catalyzes the growth of CNTs with MOF feed as carbon source. The Co-MOF/H(2)shows a high electrocatalytic activity which requires an overpotential of 312 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). A Co-MOF/H-2-based water electrolyzer requires a potential of 1.619 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)for overall water splitting in 1.0 M KOH. After 25 h of continuous operation for water electrolysis, the Co-MOF/H-2-based cell has shown a negligible increase in the overpotential, indicating its superior durability compared to the 2D Co-MOF.									16	1	0	0	1	0	17			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000547297700038	32270172

However, existing versions of a-C:H:Si:O deposited by traditional methods such as plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) undergo substantial degradation and oxidation at temperatures above 250 degrees C. This, together with the difficulty of PECVD in depositing conformal coatings on complex geometries such as high-aspect-ratio features, has limited the applicability of a-C:H:Si:O. Here, the unique capabilities of plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition (PIIID) to grow silicon oxide-rich diamond-like carbon materials that are ultrasmooth, continuous, and conformal on high-aspect-ratio topographies are explored. The high concentration of silicon and oxygen in PIIID-grown films (23 +/- 5 at.% and 11 +/- 4 at.%, respectively) is unrivalled for this class of materials, and drastically increases the resistance to oxidation at high temperatures, compared with PECVD-grown films. The results open the path for using a-C:H:Si:O in applications involving exposure of materials to extreme environments.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2196-7350			WOS:000456673900015

We show that TiO2 coatings (4 to 143 nanometers thick) grown by atomic layer deposition prevent corrosion, have electronic defects that promote hole conduction, and are sufficiently transparent to reach the light-limited performance of protected semiconductors. In conjunction with a thin layer or islands of Ni oxide electrocatalysts, Si photoanodes exhibited continuous oxidation of 1.0 molar aqueous KOH to O-2 for more than 100 hours at photocurrent densities of >30 milliamperes per square centimeter and similar to 100% Faradaic efficiency.

Heynh. cv. Landsberg erecta was grown under light regimes of differing spectral qualities, which results in differences in the stoichiometries of the two photosynthetic reaction centres. The acclimative value of these changes was investigated by assessing photosynthetic function in these plants when exposed to two spectrally distinct actinic lights. Plants grown in an environment enriched in far-red light were better able to make efficient use of non-saturating levels of actinic light enriched in long-wavelength red light. Simultaneous measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence and absorption changes at 820 nm indicated that differences between plants grown under alternative light regimes can be ascribed to imbalances in excitation of photosystems I and II (PSI, PSII). Measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence emission and excitation spectra at 77 K provided strong evidence that there was little or no difference in the composition or function of PSI or PSII between the two sets of plants, implying that changes in photosynthetic stoichiometry are primarily responsible for the observed differences in photosynthetic function.									45	2	0	0	42	0	48			0032-0935	1432-2048		WOS:A1995TC56000014	8547817

Effects of catalyst material and atomic layer deposited TiO2 oxide thickness on the water oxidation performance of metal-insulator-silicon anodes								ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE				6	8			2487	2496		10.1039/c3ee41178h				AUG 2013	2013	We report on the effects on water oxidation performance of varying (1) the nanoscale TiO2 thickness and (2) the catalyst material in catalyst/TiO2/SiO2/Si anodes. Uniform films of atomic layer deposited TiO2 are prepared in the thickness range similar to 1-12 nm on degenerately-doped p(+)-Si, yielding water oxidation overpotentials at 1 mA cm(-2) of 300 mV to 600 mV in aqueous solution (pH 0 to 14). Electron/hole transport through Schottky tunnel junction structures of varying TiO2 thickness was studied using the reversible redox couple ferri/ferrocyanide. The dependence of the water oxidation overpotential on ALD-TiO2 thickness, with all other anode design features unchanged, exhibits a linear trend corresponding to similar to 21 mV of added overpotential at 1 mA cm(-2) per nanometer of TiO2 for TiO2 thicknesses greater than similar to 2 nm. For thinner TiO2 layers, an approximately thickness-independent overpotential is observed. The linear behavior for anodes with thicker TiO2 layers is consistent with the predicted effect of bulk TiO2-limited electronic conduction on the voltage required to sustain the current density across the TiO2/SiO2 insulator stack. Eight different oxygen evolution catalysts of thickness 1-3 nm are studied. For the anodes investigated, 3 nm of Ir or Ru gave the best water oxidation performance, but both thinner layers and other catalysts can be quite effective, suggesting the potential for reduced materials cost. Lastly, a flat band voltage analysis of solid state thin film capacitors was done for five different gate metals on n-Si to probe junction energetics directly relevant to a photoanode. The results are consistent with a Schottky junction in which the Fermi level at the semiconductor surface is unpinned.									146	2	0	0	14	0	147			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000321983800022

In our theoretical studies, the bandgap of the Zn2TiO4 nanowires was much smaller than that of the bulk material. New intermediate states appeared in the mid-bandgap as a result of Zn and Ti atoms on the surface of ZnO-terminated and ZnTiO-terminated nanowires. These deep-level states could become recombination centers for photogenerated electron-hole pairs, indicating that these two types of nanowires would no longer meet the requirements for photocatalytic water splitting. In contrast, the electronic states arising from oxygen elements on the surface of the TiO-terminated nanowires resulted in an upward movement of the edge of the valence band, whereas the surface electronic states made no difference to the edge of the conduction band. Moreover, the optical property calculations showed that the optical absorption edge of the nanowire would be red-shifted. These calculations revealed that inverse-spinel Zn2TiO4 nanowires were appropriate for visible-light photocatalytic water splitting reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2158-3226		WOS:000744937300010

Electrodes were characterized and tested by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), electrochemical techniques, and accelerated life tests. The surface morphology, phase composition, electrochemical performance, and service life of the electrodes were studied and analysed. With phenol as the target pollutant, the effects of different substrates on the electrocatalytic degradation performance of the electrodes were investigated. The porous Ti/SnO2-Sb-La electrode prepared by the porous titanium substrate has finer surface grains and a larger specific surface area. The phenomena of "cracking" and "agglomeration" are obviously improved. At the same time, the oxygen evolution potential increased to 2.09 V, and the membrane impedance decreased to 5.722 Q. The degradation experiment of simulated phenol wastewater reveals that the porous Ti/SnO2-Sb-La electrode has the highest phenol degradation rate of 90.8% and a removal rate of COD of 79.9% within 120 min. Additionally, the porous Ti/SnO2-Sb-La electrode has the longest accelerated service lifetime of 105 min, which is 5 times that of the planar Ti/SnO2-Sb-La electrode. It can be seen from the experimental results that the electrode prepared by using the novel porous titanium as the matrix has obvious electrochemical performance, service life and current utilization efficiency advantages in the degradation process. At the same time, it is further proved that the electrode substrate has a significant effect on the electrode performance in the electrochemical treatment of phenolcontaining water.

Firstly, these experiments on leaves of tabaco, Agopodium podagraria and spinach show that transenvelope fluxes of protons and not the uptake of CO2 mediate the changes in cytosolic pH. Comparing the light-induced depolarisations of plasmalemma potential with chlorophyll luminescence or fluorescence in Chara excluded alternative explanations like signal flow via putative thylakoid-chlorolemma connections and alkalinization by PGA-fluxes. Secondly, the occurrence of the pH changes during CO2 modulation demonstrates the imbalance of ATP and NADPH/H+ generation by the linear electron flow. Searching for mechanisms furnishing additional ATP was done by measuring heat evolution and O2-uptake by means of photoacoustic pulse experiments. They show that the Mehler reaction is active under steady-state conditions. It is stimulated when the transthylakoid pH-gradient increases. Further, the time course of heat evolution gave additional evidence that the time-constant tau4 is related to transthylakoid proton fluxes and alkalinization in the cytosol.									39	0	2	0	36	0	41			0032-0781			WOS:A1993LQ18100005

However, the reported catalysts always show either a low Faradaic efficiency of the C2+ product or poor long-term stability. Herein, we report a facile and scalable anodic corrosion method to synthesize oxygen-rich ultrathin CuO nanoplate arrays, which form Cu/Cu2O heterogeneous interfaces through self-evolution during electrocatalysis. The catalyst exhibits a high C2H4 Faradaic efficiency of 84.5%, stable electrolysis for similar to 55 h in a flow cell using a neutral KCI electrolyte, and a full-cell ethylene energy efficiency of 27.6% at 200 mA cm(-2) in a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer. Mechanism analyses reveal that the stable nanostructures, stable Cu/Cu2O interfaces, and enhanced adsorption of the *OCCOH intermediate preserve selective and prolonged C2H4 production. The robust and scalable produced catalyst coupled with mild electrolytic conditions facilitates the practical application of electrochemical CO2 reduction.									17	0	0	0	0	0	16				2041-1723		WOS:000779311200034	35387994

There is a need to breed new grape cultivars with heat tolerance and to design effective physiological defenses against heat stress. The investigation of heat injury to plants or tissues under high temperature is an important step in achieving these goals. At present, evaluation methods for heat injury include the gas exchange parameters of photosynthesis, membrane thermostability, chlorophyll content etc.; however, these methods have obvious disadvantages, such as insensitivity, inconvenience and delayed information. An effective and convenient method for investigating the heat injury of grapevine must be developed.Results: In this study, an investigation protocol for a critical temperature (47 degrees C) and heat treatment time (40 min) was developed in detached grape leaves. Based on the results, we found that the OJIP test was superior to measuring electrolyte leakage or photosynthetic O-2 evolution for investigating the heat injury of three cultivars of grapevine. Heat tolerance of 47 grape species and cultivars was evaluated through investigating heat injury using the OJIP test. Moreover, the electron transport chain (donor side, acceptor side and reaction center) of PSII in photosynthesis was further investigated.Conclusions: The OJIP test was a rapid, sensitive and convenient method for investigating heat injury in grapevine. An analysis of PSII function using this method indicated that the acceptor side was less sensitive to heat than was the donor side or the reaction center in grape leaves. Among the 47 taxa evaluated (cultivars, hybrids, and wild species), heat tolerance varied largely in each genotype group: most wild species and hybrids between V. labrusca and V. vinifera had relatively strong heat tolerance, but most cultivars from V. vinifera had relatively weak heat tolerance.									35	3	0	0	32	1	37			1471-2229			WOS:000339076600001	24898786

In contrast to most previous calculations, the parameters of the turbulence model are determined by physical considerations and from results of laboratory combustion experiments, with the exception of a closure relation that remains largely undetermined but seems to be of great importance.As a first test case the subgrid model is coupled to a code solving the Euler equation directly by means of the piecewise parabolic method (PPM), and the propagation of a nuclear burning front in a Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf is simulated in two dimensions. We find that energy from the well-resolved Rayleigh-Taylor scale is indeed going into turbulent motions, thereby accelerating the flame speed significantly beyond its laminar value. However, with a conservative choice of the parameters of the subgrid model, the turbulent velocity never exceeds a few percent of the sound speed. Consequently, the model has very little in common with observed Type Ia supernovae. Possible ways out of this dilemma are briefly discussed.									133	3	0	0	0	0	134			0004-637X			WOS:A1995RY93200025

Alkaline electrolysers using Earth-abundant catalysts remain the most economically viable route to electrolytic hydrogen, but improved efficiency is desirable. Recently, electron spin polarization was described as a potential way to improve water-splitting catalysis. Here, we report the significant enhancement of alkaline water electrolysis when a moderate magnetic field (<= 450 mT) is applied to the anode. Current density increments above 100% (over 100 mA cm(-2)) were found for highly magnetic electrocatalysts, such as the mixed oxide NiZnFe4Ox. Magnetic enhancement works even for decorated Ni-foam electrodes with very high current densities, improving their intrinsic activity by about 40% to reach over 1 A cm(-2) at low overpotentials. Thanks to its simplicity, our discovery opens opportunities for implementing magnetic enhancement in water splitting.									225	6	0	0	12	0	227			2058-7546			WOS:000471295000019

In this work the performance of a PEMWE using RuIrCoOx, as anodic electrocatalyst had been examined. The oxide powder was synthesized using a chemical reduction method, followed by thermal oxidation. The electrochemical properties of the electrocatalysts were examined by cyclical and lineal voltammetry in 0.5 M H2SO4. It was found that RuIrCoOx oxide electrodes present a stable performance for OER. The PEMWE was designed and in-home built. Chrono-potentiometric experiments were recorded in the current range of 0.25 mA cm(-2) to 75 mA cm(-2) at 300 s. The current pulses length is chosen to be sufficiently long so that the voltage remains constant. Their intrinsic electrocatalytic activity in combination with their large surface area and stability are quite promising for the development of economically feasible electrocatalysts for (PEMWE).

The structural evolution as a function of heat treatment temperature of these powders was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and micro-Raman (MR) spectroscopy. The optical properties were verified by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) measurements. XRD patterns and MR spectra revealed that the BiT powders heat treated at 700 degrees C for 2 h under oxygen flow crystallize in an orthorhombic structure without deleterious phases. UV-vis spectra indicated the presence of intermediary energy levels within the band gap of the powders heat treated at low temperatures. The maximum PL emissions of these materials were verified at around 598 nm, when excited by 488 nm wavelengths. Also, it was observed the presence of two broad PL bands, which were attributed to the intermediary energy levels arising from alpha-Bi2O3 and BiT phases. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A reliable criterion to estimate the capability of coating to form alpha-alumina is of great importance to accurately evaluate coating lifetime. However, some coatings retain the ability to form a continuous alpha-alumina scale when the concentration of Al in coatings decreases to a critical level, therefore, the empirical Al-concentration based criterion is inadequate to properly predict the formation of a continuous alpha-alumina. Thus, a new life criterion, namely the critical Al-activity criterion, is proposed.In this work, the critical Al-activity to form a continuous a-alumina was validated by Al-activity calculation using Thermo-Calc software based on survey of research results of critical Al-concentration to form alpha-alumina on binary Ni-Al and ternary Ni-Cr-Al systems. Long-term oxidation tests were performed to support the criterion: three different MCrAlY coatings coated on IN-792 superalloy substrates were oxidized at 1000 degrees C for various periods of time up to 10,000 h. The microstructural evolution of MCrAlY coatings was investigated using Scanning Electron Microscope. The near-surface Al concentration and interdiffusion behaviour between substrate and coating were measured using Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy. The new critical Al-activity criterion has been successfully adopted in alpha-alumina formation prediction, showing a good agreement with experiment results. Therefore, it can be concluded that the extrapolation of new criterion from binary and ternary systems to multi-alloyed MCrAlY system is reasonable. Furthermore, the partial pressure of oxygen (P-O2) in atmosphere has been taken into consideration by combination with Al-activity to calculate the critical chemical reaction constant (K) of formation of a-alumina. The potential applicability of the methodology to predict MCrAlY life is also discussed.					44th International Conference on Metallurgical Coatings and Thin Films (ICMCTF)44th International Conference on Metallurgical Coatings and Thin Films (ICMCTF)	APR 24-28, 2017APR 24-28, 2017	Amer Vacuum Soc, Sci & Technol Mat, Interfaces, & Proc, Adv Surface Engn DivAmer Vacuum Soc, Sci & Technol Mat, Interfaces, & Proc, Adv Surface Engn Div	San Diego, CASan Diego, CA	18	1	0	0	1	0	19			0257-8972			WOS:000418968100003

Among them, cadmium sulfide (CdS) has a relatively narrow band gap (2.4 eV) and a high conduction band position. It can be considered to be a good visible light photocatalyst in response to visible light. However, its application is limited because the existence of rapid photo-electron-hole recombination and photo-corrosion. In this work, a series of hollow CdS tubes have been successfully prepared with the novel morphology via simple one-step solvo-thermal method. The as-prepared catalysts displayed great photocatalytic activity for photocatalytic split water product H-2 under light (lambda >= 350 nm). Due to the presence of the solvent carbon layer, the photo-corrosion of CdS was prevented, so it had good cycle performance. Meanwhile, the appropriate mole of cadmium sulfur dosage was explored and found that 3 mmol was the most suitable. The CdS-3 sample performed the optimal hydrogen (H-2) evolution rate (312.6 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) within 4 h. In addition, based on various characterization results of the photocatalyst, the novel structure and probable catalytic mechanism were further explored.									16	2	0	0	1	0	16			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000486177700089

This phenomenon is of vital importance for the process control and mechanical property of the metallic materials, such as Iron-Nickel binary alloy. The present work performed a fundamental study of the composition evolution and coalescence behavior of the Ti-oxide particles in the liquid Iron-Nickel binary alloy. The effect of the titanium addition amount on the composition of the inclusion particles is investigated through the Ti deoxidation experiments. The particle features are characterized by using a potentiostatic electrolytic extraction method. It shows that when the amount of the Ti addition arrives at a certain degree, the state of the oxide particles changes from the liquid to the solid. Meanwhile, the formation of the cluster can occur. The coalescence efficiency and attraction forces of the particles are calculated theoretically. It is found that the coalescence degree of the solid TiOx (x=1.5-1.67) particle is close to that of the Al2O3 particle. The initial sintering behavior of the particles after coalescence-collision is analyzed by measuring the sintered neck radius. The apparent self-diffusion of the TiOx (x=1.5-1.67) particle is approximately 1.7 times larger than that of the Al2O3 particle.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000461787500049

The SGA is one of the most important groundwater reservoirs in northeastern Sao Paulo State (Brazil), responsible for water supply to cities and agriculture. In order to evaluate the geochemical and isotopic evolution of SGA, as well as to determine the mean residence time, a groundwater sampling campaign was carried out over the SGA in Sao Paulo State (Brazil) from January to April 2013. Two main hydrochemical facies were recognized: Ca-Mg-HCO3 related to water-rock interaction reactions in basaltic outcrop, such as mineral dissolution due to atmospheric CO2 uptake, and alkaline Na-HCO3 groundwater, evolved from mixing with groundwater from the underlying Guarani Aquifer System. Stable isotope (delta O-18 and delta H-2) ratios range from -8.87 to -5.32 parts per thousand VSMOW and -61.31 to -31.64 parts per thousand VSMOW, respectively, closely following the GMWL. Spatial and temporal variations in isotope ratios are associated with the South Atlantic convergence zone activities and the type of rain responsible for recharge. Values for delta C-13 vary from -21.53 to -7.11 parts per thousand VPDB, while C-14 activities vary from 1.2 pcm to more than 100 pcm, presenting a trend to enrichment and decrease in C-14 activities westward, concordant with the regional groundwater flow direction. Most recent groundwaters have delta C-13 ratio contents mostly consistent with C3 plants.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1866-6280	1866-6299		WOS:000394965100012

Our nonadiabatic quantum dynamics simulations based on real-time time-dependent density functional theory reveal explicitly the transport channel of photogenerated charge carriers at the g-C3N4/water interface, which shows a strong correlation to bond re-forming. A three-step photoreaction mechanism is proposed, whereas the key roles of hole- driven hydrogen transfer and interfacial water configurations were identified. Immediately following photocatalytic water splitting, atomic pathways for the two dissociated hydrogen atoms approaching each other and forming the H-2 gas molecule are demonstrated, while the remanent OH radicals may form intermediate products (e.g., H2O2). These results provide critical new insights for the characterization and further development of efficient water-splitting photocatalysts from a dynamic perspective.									9	1	0	0	1	0	9			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000685244900012	34279962

In this paper, polyaniline (PANI) microtubes are firstly prepared by removing the polystylene (PS) core from PANI coated electrospun PS. The catalyst of PtNi/PANI@rGO is built by two steps: graphene oxide (GO) is mixed with PANI microtubes to obtain PANI@GO and then PANI@GO is used as a support material to load PtNi nanoparticles by reductive reaction while GO is reduced into rGO. The morphology, electronic structure and chemical structure of the catalysts are characterized by SEM, TEM, XPS and Raman spectroscopy, respectively. The electrochemical analysis of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometric measurement are performed to analyze the electrocatalytic performance. The electrochemical results indicate that as-synthesized PtNi/PANI@rGO has the high activity toward methanol oxidation, and its mass activity is 1.7, 1.3 and 4.1 times higher than that of PtNi/PANI, PtNi/rGO and commercial Pt/C catalysts, respectively. The PANI microtubes not only improve the electron transfer kinetic but also help avoid the accumulation of graphene layers. The doping of Ni into Pt changes the surface electronic structure to elevate the catalytic activity and helps effectively improve the resistance to CO poisoning.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000664797600001

Paragenetic stages of mineralization and alteration are as follows: greisen I, albitization, K feldspathization, and greisen II. A late-stage of quartz-fluorite vug filling is present locally. K-Ar age dating of muscovite from the greisen I stage mineralization indicates a crystallization age of 158 to 179 +/- 6 Ma, in close agreement with previously determined ages of 151 to 179 Ma (Chon et al., 1993). Two samples of muscovite from the pegmatites give ages of 696 +/- 15 and 778 +/- 14 Ma. Greisen-related tin mineralization occurred during the Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous and is much younger than either the pegmatite (Late Proterozoic) or the granite gneiss (Early Proterozoic based on Rb/Sr studies of Hong, 1985, and Lee, 1988),Temperatures of greisen I stage mineralization, determined from fluid inclusion homogenization studies, arsenopyrite composition, and quartz-muscovite delta(18)O values, range from 450 degrees to 600 degrees C. The coexistence of sulfide and oxide minerals suggest that during ore deposition f(S2) increased and f(O2) was constant or decreased slightly. Fluid inclusion analyses indicate that the ore fluid was of low to moderate salinity (2.89-8.55 wt % NaCl equiv), with variable CO2 content. Oxygen and hydrogen isotope values of quartz and muscovite decrease along a distance of 1,500 m from the northeast (Uljin mine) to the southwest (Dongseog mine) and suggest that fluid delta(18)O and delta D values decreased from similar to 11 to 9 permil, and -55 to -61 per mil, respectively. A similar decrease in fluid delta(18)O and delta D values is recorded temporally with the paragenetic stage at the Uljin mine. Sulfur isotope values of arsenopyrite and molybdenite range from -1.2 to 1.2 per mil.A genetic model of fluid derivation from an underlying Mesozoic granitic pluton, accompanied with the involvement of meteoric water in later stages, is proposed. Isotopic data are consistent with temporal and spatial variations in fluid delta D and delta(18)O values caused either by tapping of a magmatic fluid during various stages of chemical and isotopic evolution, or by reaction and isotopic exchange,ae with high O-18 sedimentary rocks along a fluid Bow path. Variations in delta(18)O values of carbonate country rocks from 19.3 to 12.3 per mil are suggestive of selective fluid transport through particularly permeable units in the limestone. Low delta(18)O values of vug-filling quartz suggest the involvement of low-temperature meteoric water in the latest hydrothermal stages of mineralization.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0361-0128			WOS:A1996VW81800008

Montmorillonite has a high adsorption capacity and layered structure, which has positive effects on increasing the specific surface area of g-C3N4 and avoid its polymerization agglomeration. In this paper, montmorillonite was used as carrier for g-C3N4 to obtain a new photocatalytic composite g-C3N4/Mt. Then the morphological and (micro)structural properties were characterized. The well-characterized materials were evaluated for the photocatalytic activity in degradation of methylene blue and Bisphenol A. The effects of the mass fraction of g-C3N4, light irradiation time, and pollutant concentration on the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4/Mt composites were studied. Under the optimal experimental plan, the rate of photocatalytic degradation can reach to 99.3% within 120 min. Through the MS spectrum, it can be found that methylene blue molecule were catalysed and degraded into many harmless substances with low-molecular weight. Finally, based on the obtained reaction products, the mechanism by which the pollutants are removed was proposed. This study provides a new strategy to improve the photocatalysis ability of g-C3N4, which is of great significance for a sustainable pollution treatment.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0959-3330	1479-487X		WOS:000592625800001	33086988

The obtained Si3N4 fibers were characterized by tensile strength, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and elemental analysis after being annealed (air pressure: 1 Pa-0.1 MPa, temperature: 1000-1600 degrees C, dwell time: 0-4 h). When air pressure was lower than 100 Pa or higher than 1000 Pa the strength of fibers dropped sharply. Due to the moderate partial pressure of oxygen in 100-1000 Pa, both active oxidation and passive oxidation were restrained resulting in the best mechanical property of fibers in 100-1000 Pa. Besides air pressure, annealing time also affected the thermal behavior of fibers. Firstly Si3N4 fibers were passive oxidized to form SiO2 layer on the surface, and then Si3N4 decomposed into free Si and SiO2 released gaseous SiO. Finally crystallization inside of fibers and formation of nanowires on the outer surface played the leading role in the progress of degradation.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000654847300002

Herein, noble-metal-free MoS2 was adopted as a co-catalyst to construct a ternary Bi2S3/MoS2/P-25 heterojunction for boosting electrons transfer and further evaluating for H-2 production from water under solar irradiation. Due to the synergistic effects of the co-catalyst and heterojunction in the Bi2S3/MoS2/P-25 system, the optimal MoS2/P-25/Bi2S3 sample provides the excellent photocatalytic activity of H-2 evolution rate (13.0 mmol g(-1) h(-1)), which can be ascribed to the positive synergetic effects of improved charge transfer and efficient separation of the light-induced charge carriers of MoS2/P-25/Bi2S3 arose from the dual-channel charges transfer path. By taking full advantage of ternary heterojunction and co-catalyst for promoting H-2 production, this work guarantees insights into the low-cost, large-scale production of commercial TiO2-based ternary composite materials applied in solar photocatalytic hydrogen production.									11	2	0	0	0	0	12			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000623913000001

As-prepared BiVO4 thin films were found to have pure monoclinic scheelite structure with a compact, irregular microstructured morphology and strong absorption in the visible light region with estimated bandgap of 2.4 eV. When applied as an electrode material for water splitting in borate electrolyte solution, a significantly enhanced stability, coupled with a 15-fold increase in photocurrent density (ca. 1.04 mA cm(-2)) are observed compared to those of conventional hydrothermal synthesized films. The BiVO4 prepared with mixed solvent gave a substantial enhancement of the incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) and absorbed photon to current efficiency (APCE) during light driven oxygen evolution									18	2	0	0	1	0	19			0927-0248	1879-3398		WOS:000401208200027

Metal sulfides can capture visible light efficiently; however, their utilization in water splitting has long been plagued by the poor resilience against hole oxidation. Herein, we report that the ZnIn2S4 monolayers with dual defects (Ag dopants and nanoholes) accessed via cation exchange display stoichiometric H2 and O-2 evolution in pure water under visible light irradiation. In-depth characterization and modeling disclose that the dual-defect structure endows the ZnIn2S4 monolayers with optimized light absorption and carrier dynamics. More significantly, the dual defects cooperatively function as active sites for water oxidation (Ag dopants) and reduction (nanoholes), thus leading to steady performance in photocatalytic overall water splitting without the assistance of cocatalysts. This work demonstrates a feasible way for fulfilling "all-in-one" photocatalyst design and manifests its great potential in addressing the stability issues associated with sulfide-based photocatalysts.									31	2	0	0	1	0	31			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000679930400042	34279970

During the past few years, BP-based photocatalyst, including BP nanosheets and BP quantum dots, have attracted considerable attention for photocatalytic H-2 evolution, and some significant achievement has been made. In this review, a brief overview of the general background of BP and its related photocatalytic materials was introduced in the introduction section, followed by the basic properties and main synthesis approach of BP materials. And then, the recent development of BP-based photocatalysts for photocatalytic H-2 production was summarized, and the influence factors on the photocatalytic performance and methods to enhance the activities of BP-based photocatalysts are discussed in detail. Finally, this review ends with some challenges and perspectives in this emerging area of research. The aim of this Review on BP photocatalysts and their application in solar H-2 generation was to evaluate the current status of this research and provide promising design principles for the future development of BP-based photocatalysts.									48	4	0	0	3	0	49			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000551889900022

Crystal Structure, Electrical Properties, and Microstructural Analysis								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				164	2			F99	F106		10.1149/2.0581702jes				2017	2017	This study is to complement an early article (Dogdibegovic et al., J. Electrochem. Soc., 163(13), F1344 (2016)) on the electrochemical activity and performance stability of (Pr1-xNdx)(2)NiO4+delta (PNNO) electrodes. Here, we report the crystal structure, electrical properties, and microstructures of PNNO series as the cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells. Rietveld refinements on powders (x = 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1) show that the unit cell volume decreases with an increase in x, primarily due to a decrease in the c lattice parameter. Larger cell volume (similar to 1.50%) and higher total electrical conduction (40%) in Pr2NiO4+delta are in favor with its mixed conducting properties during operation, but Pr2NiO4+delta cathode exhibits a severe phase evolution. Substitution of Pr with Nd shows the suppression of phase evolution in both thermally annealed powders and electrodes. An increase in Nd content leads to a full preservation of the parent phase in both (Pr0.25Nd0.75)(2)NiO4+delta and Nd2NiO4 after 2,500 hour annealing at elevated temperatures. Reaction with GDC buffer layer was also suppressed with the presence of Nd, which was shown by a reduction of Pr and Ni elemental diffusion into GDC bulk. STEM analysis confirms multiple phases present in an operated Pr2NiO4+delta electrode, while suppressed phase transition was observed in electrodes with high Nd content.

Specifically, we have generated (a) La2NiMnO6, LaMnO3, and LaNiO3 nanocubes with average sizes of similar to 200 nm, in addition to a series of La2NiMnO6 (b) nanocubes possessing average sizes of similar to 70 and 400 nm and (c) anisotropic nanorods characterized by average diameters of 40-50 nm. All of these samples, when used as supports for Pt nanoparticles, exhibited activities which were at least twice that measured for Pt/C. We have investigated and correlated the effect of varying perovskite (i) composition, (ii) size, and (iii) morphology upon the measured MOR activity. (i) The Ni-containing perovskites yielded generally higher performance metrics than LaMnO3 alone, suggesting that the presence of Ni is favorable for MOR, a finding supported by a shift in the Pt d-band in XPS. (ii) MOR activity is enhanced as the perovskite size increases in magnitude, suggesting that a growth in the perovskite particle size enables favorable, synergistic metal-support interactions. (iii) A comparison of the nanorods and nanocubes of a similar diameter implied that the one-dimensional morphology achieved a greater activity, a finding which can be attributed not only to the anisotropic structure but also to a desirable surface structure. Overall, these data yield key insights into the tuning of metal-support interactions via rational control over the composition, size, and morphology of the underlying catalyst support.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000729576000001

While the feasibility of which as potential inert anode for electrochemical transformation of CO2 was assessed in the melt by electrochemical method. The result shows that besides Cu2O and CuO, SnO2 is detected in the oxide scales of the bronze QSn7-0.2 electrodes oxidized via potentiostatic polarization by 0.2 V and simple immersion by open circuit potential. The oxide scales with SnO2 can significantly prevent the bronze QSn7-0.2 anodes from corrosion and act also as electro-catalyzer for the oxygen evolution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1005-4537			INSPEC:18055921

The samples were characterized and the results revealed that the higher the reaction temperature, the shorter the crystallization time and the bigger the particle size of zeolite NaA will be. Zeolite NaA kept its crystal structure before and after cobalt exchange. However, the introduction of cobalt ions into zeolite would result in a decrease in the intensity of all crystallographic reflexes. Furthermore, Co2+-NaA (25A degrees C zeolite sample) was shown to exhibit better catalytic activity of styrene epoxidation as compared with that of Co2+-NaA (40, 60, and 95A degrees zeolite sample) catalysts, which may be ascribed to its short diffusion path and enhanced physical transport of reactant and product.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0965-5441	1555-6239		WOS:000425317400016

These anomalous relationships, referred to as sulfur mass-independent fractionation (S-MIF), provide strong evidence for an early anoxic atmosphere. Correlated variations among three isotope ratios (delta S-33, delta S-34, and delta S-36) can be observed in rocks throughout the Archean and are a key clue toward identifying the source reaction of S-MIF. Studies to investigate the origin of Archean SMIF so far have primarily focused on the photochemistry of sulfur dioxide (SO2). Photolysis of SO2 at wavelengths <220 nm and photoexcitation at 240-340 nm both yield large-magnitude S-MIF. Proposed mechanisms of S-MIF include isotopologue-dependent self-shielding, cross-sectional amplitudes, and vibronic coupling during intersystem crossing. This review discusses the emerging picture of the physical origins of S-MIF and their implications for the chemistry of the early Earth's atmosphere.									62	2	1	0	12	0	64			0084-6597	1545-4495	978-0-8243-2045-4	WOS:000411802000013

The osumilite (Os) occurs in association with cordierite (Cd), orthopyroxene (Opx), sillimanite (Sil), sapphirine (Sa), spinel (Sp), K-feldspar (Kf), plagioclase (Pl), phlogopite (Ph), hematite (Hm), magnetite (Mt), corundum (Co), and quartz (Q) in zones adjacent to the gabbronorite intrusion. The osumilite-in isograd is delineated at a distance of 1-3 km from the intrusive contact. The osumilite is characterized by enhanced Mg/(Mg + Fe) ratios (0.89-0.92) and relatively high K2O contents (4.13-4.78 wt. %). The compositional variation of the osumilite is best understood by the substitutions (Mg + Fe+ Mn) + Si = 2Al and (K + Na) + (Mg + Fe + Mn) = Al + vacancy. Symplectitic intergrowth of Opx-Cd-Kf-Q, which partly or completely replaced osumilite, is ubiquitously present. The stable osumilite-bearing assemblages (all with Hm, Mt, and Pl) deduced from petrographic features and from the phase relations in the KMAS system are Os-Sa-Cd, Os-Cd-Sil-Q, Os-Cd-Kf-Q, Os-Cd-Opx-Q, and Os-Opx-Kf-Q. The sapphirine-bearing assemblages are restricted to silica-deficient (quartz-absent) zones of the gneiss, which include Sa-Os-Cd, Sa-Sil-Cd, Sa-Opx-Sp, Sa-Sp-Cd, and Sa-Sp-Co. Orthopyroxene coronas mantling phlogopite reflect the breakdown reaction Ph + Q = Opx + Kf + vapor under extremely low water activity in the vapor.Petrogenetic grids in MAS, KMAS, and KMAS-H2O-CO2 appropriate to the mineral assemblages in the metasedimentary gneisses suggest that the changes of the mineral assemblages in the area studied reflect dehydration reactions Ph + Sil + Q = Cd + Kf + V and Ph + Q = Opx + Kf + V, and osumilite- and sapphirine-forming reactions Opx + Cd + Kf + Q = Os, Cd + Kf + Q = Os + Sil, Opx + Sil + Kf = Os + Sa, and Opx + Sil = Sa + Cd. Relatively high Mg/(Mg + Fe2+) (0.64-0.88) in the whole-rock composition and high oxygen fugacity (near hematite-magnetite buffer), together with exceptionally high temperature (almost-equal-to 1000-degrees-C) and extremely low water activity ( < 0.2) at peak metamorphic conditions might stabilize the osumilite- and sapphirine-bearing assemblages at middle or lower crustal levels. Relatively low water activity is probably caused by the relatively dry precursor, which had been metamorphosed at upper amphibolite facies metamorphic conditions before gabbronorite emplacement.									35	3	0	0	0	0	35			0022-3530			WOS:A1991FB87300002

The suitability of the oxide layers obtained for electrocatalytic oxidation of propyl alcohol was assessed using a potentiodynamic method in the temperature range 293-333 K. Using the calculated value of the activation energy, it was possible to determine the influence of the presence of crystalline Ni5P2 in the Ni-P alloy on the electro-oxidation of propanol. It was found that the nickel phosphides in the crystalline state of Ni-P alloys are responsible for the occurrence of a layer of nickel oxides which are more active than those found on nickel surfaces. It may be concluded that the joint presence of nickel oxides in various degrees of oxidation plus the crystalline nickel phosphides, induces the electrocatalytic effect of alcohol oxidation in the alkaline environment.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0040-6090			WOS:A1991GL26500008

At <=+0.35 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), the electrochemical Ni deposition was detected by the Ni L-2,L-3-edge FY-XAS in the presence of EG whereas almost no such event was observed in the absence of EG. A drastic decrease of FY-XAS intensities in the O K-edge region was also observed in the presence of EG at >+0.35 V vs. RHE, suggesting that the nano-/micro-structured Ni deposition initiated by the removal of water molecules occurs on the Pt electrode. The complex formation of Ni2+ with EG and the adsorption of EG on the Ni surface could play an important role in the Ni deposition. This study demonstrates that the in situ FY-XAS is a powerful and surface-sensitive technique to understand (electro)chemical reactions including polyol synthesis and electrocatalysis at solid-liquid interfaces.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2046-2069		WOS:000778326700001	35424983

Herein, a unique ultra-thin nanosheet bimetal electrocatalyst NiFe-MOF/IF was synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal method, and characterized by SEM, XRD, TEM, and XPS. NiFe-MOF/IF shows superior OER electrocatalytic activity in 1 M KOH electrolyte solution, and an ultralow overpotential of only 230 and 262 mV was required to achieve a current density of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, with a relatively small Tafel slope of 30.46 mV dec(-1) for the OER. No obvious degradation of the current density at 10 mA cm(-2) was observed over about 16 h, which indicates the excellent stability of the catalyst. Favourable activity and benign durability of NiFe-MOF/IF can be attributed to the three-dimensional high porosity conductive substrates, in situ growth of MOF nanosheets, bimetallic synergy, and unique layering. This research provides a promising strategy for the application of MOF materials in the field of electrocatalysis.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000637156700027	33729242

In these oxidations, cobalt-oxo species with formal oxidation states greater than 3 are commonly invoked as reactive intermediates. However, there is a dearth of mechanistic information regarding how these high-valent cobalt catalysts operate. This Perspective describes how the study of molecular cobalt oxo clusters, with an emphasis on [Co4O4] oxo cubane complexes, has helped to shed light on the operative mechanisms of cobalt-catalyzed oxidation reactions. Implications for high-valent Co-IV-oxo and Co-V-oxo intermediates and remaining mechanistic questions concerning how these intermediates mediate O-O bond formation are also discussed. Furthermore, structural modifications of these oxo cubane clusters (i.e., incorporation of heteroatoms and modulation of ligands) have provided insight into multimetallic cooperativity, but the influence of such metal-metal interactions on oxidation activity remains to be explored. A more detailed understanding of these structure-activity relationships may enable fine-tuning of reactivity and stability of synthetic multimetallic catalysts for energy storage and challenging organic transformations.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000751111600001	35060704

In alkaline electrolyte with urea, Fe2GeO4, which was used as the anode in the electrolysis cell, exhibited a lower potential (1.53 V (vs. RHE)) and a smaller Tafel slope (76 mV dec(-1)) Co2GeO4 (1.65 V (vs. RHE), 79 mV dec(-1)), indicating that Fe2GeO4 reduced the overall input potential to produce H-2. The superior performance of Fe2GeO4 in the urea-added water electrolysis was attributed to the higher oxidation state of its metal cations, larger electrochemical active surface area, and lower charge transfer resistance than those of Co2GeO4. Hence, Fe2GeO4 showed 5.49 times higher H-2 peak intensity than Co2GeO4, indicating higher efficiency of H-2 production.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2051-8153	2051-8161		WOS:000703641200001

Microemulsion-based electrodeposition is a novel, fast, and one-step procedure to obtain mesoporous catalysts with extraordinarily effective areas, which can be used in heterogeneous catalysis for degradation of pollutants and clean energy production. The fabrication process involves conducting microemulsions containing ionic species (dissolved in aqueous solutions) as precursors of the metallic catalysts. The presence of nanometric droplets of organic or ionic-liquid components in the microemulsion defines the mesoporosity of the catalysts during a one-step electrodeposition process. This method also allows the fabrication of metal catalysts as supported mesoporous films or mesoporous nanowires with very high effective areas. Additionally, reactants have excellent accessibility to the overall surface of the catalysts. The different catalysts fabricated with the help of this technology have been tested for competitive degradation of organic pollutants and anodes' materials for fuel cell devices.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8				2073-4344		WOS:000448331700055		
J	Krasnopolsky, Vladimir A.				Krasnopolsky, Vladimir/L-5085-2013				A photochemical model of Pluto's atmosphere and ionosphere								ICARUS				335						113374	10.1016/j.icarus.2019.07.008				JAN 1 2020	2020	The model for Titan by Krasnopolsky (2014, Icarus 236, 83-91) has been adjusted to Pluto's conditions during the New Horizons flyby. The model includes 419 reactions of 83 neutrals and 33 positive ions plus 10 reactions of CO+ and HCO+ that were missing for Titan because of the low CO abundance. The model has 289 altitude steps up to the exobase at 1600 km with thermal escape for neutrals and diffusion velocities for ions as the upper boundary conditions. The model involves condensation on the haze and the surface with sticking coefficient gamma = 0.002 for hydrocarbons, H2O, and CO2, gamma = 0.01 for nitriles except HC3N with gamma = 0.1. The photochemistry is driven by the solar EUV and UV radiation, the interplanetary Lyman-alpha emission, and the galactic cosmic rays. The adopted eddy diffusion K = 3 x 10(4) cm(2) s(-1) facilitates transport of C2H4 and C2H6, their condensation on the surface, and does not require the revision of the laboratory data on saturated vapor densities of C2H4 and C2H6 by orders of magnitude to fit the New Horizons observations. The CH4 homopause is at 110 km for this K, and the CH4 vertical profile is mostly controlled by molecular diffusion and agrees with the NH observations. Productions and losses of major hydrocarbons, nitriles, oxygen species, and hydrogen are briefly discussed. The daytime ionosphere is predicted with a maximum electron density of 800 cm(-3) at 750 km. The most abundant ions are HCNH+ and C9H11+ above and below 600 km, respectively. Chemical effects of the ion reactions on some neutral species are significant. The predicted ion densities are measurable by an analog of the Cassini ion-neutral mass spectrometer. Evolution of the atmosphere includes thermal escape of H-2 + H, CH4 + CH3, and N-2 + N (92, 203, and 1 g cm(-2) Byr(-1), respectively), condensation of hydrocarbons and nitriles (306 and 101 g cm(-2) Byr(-1), respectively), and polymerization (30 g cm(-2) Byr(-1)). (Annually mean values are halves of those.) The composition and photochemistry of Pluto during the New Horizons flyby are very different from those of Triton during the Voyager 2 flyby and controlled by the methane mole fraction near the surface. Seasonal variations of the atmospheric methane should cover both states of the atmospheres on both Pluto and Triton.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0019-1035	1090-2643		WOS:000504802400007

Pyridinic N doping rich configurations have been proven beneficial for the electrochemical process. The onset voltage of water splitting on the NFPGNS is lower than 1.60 V, only slightly higher than that found for Pt/C electrocatalysts. Particularly, an onset potential of 1.45 V vs. RHE on the NFPGNS for the OER is lower than some metal based electrocatalysts, involving Pt/C. DFT calculations reveal the origin of the electrocatalytic activity on the NFPGNS for the HER and OER; heteroatom-doped graphene materials modify the electron acceptor-donor properties of carbon via a synergistic coupling effect between heteroatoms. This leads to favorable electronic structures tuning the C sites around the heteroatoms, introducing a stronger adsorption strength and consequently, a lower value for the Gibbs free energy.									75	6	0	0	5	0	79			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000400553700014

His focus has been on excitation energy transfer; primary photochemistry, and the role of bicarbonate in electron and proton transfer. His major tools have been kinetics and spectroscopy (absorption and fluorescence), and he has provided an understanding of both thermoluminescence and delayed light emission in plants and algae. He pioneered the use of lifetime of fluorescence measurements to study the phenomenon of photoprotection in plants and algae. He, however, is both a generalist and a specialist all at the same time. He communicates very effectively his passion for photosynthesis to the novice as well as professionals. He has been a prolific author, outstanding lecturer and an editor par excellence. He is the founder not only of the Historical Corner of Photosynthesis Research, but of the highly valued Series Advances in Photosynthesis and Respiration Including Bioenergy and Related Processes. He reaches out to young people by distributing Z-scheme posters, presenting Awards of books, and through tri-annual articles on "Photosynthesis Web Resources". At home, at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, he has established student Awards for Excellence in Biological Sciences. On behalf of all his former graduate students and associates, I wish him a Happy 80th birthday. I have included here several tributes to Govindjee by his well-wishers. These write-ups express the high regard the photosynthesis community holds for "Gov" and illuminate the different facets of his life and associations.									10	0	0	0	7	0	10			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000325848800002	24113923

The novelty of this study has been the observation of enhanced grain growth in the region closer to the anode, even under FAST/SPS conditions with electrical fields less than 5 V/cm. The grain growth kinetics, including determination of activation energy and grain-boundary mobility, were analyzed along the cross section of the samples for different temperatures and dwell periods. With an increase in distance from the anode, reduction in the activation energy for grain growth and grain-boundary mobility was observed. These observations attributed to the attraction of oxygen ions to the anode region under an electrical field with an increase in defects along the grain boundaries. Thereby an increase in the grain-boundary mobility and larger grains in that region were observed. A homogenous microstructure was observed in a case where the current did not flow through the sample. Furthermore, a numerical strategy has also been developed to simulate this behavior in addition to heat generation, heat transfer, and densification using Finite Element Methods (FEM) simulations. The simulation results provided an insight into the presence of a potential difference across the cross section of the samples. The simulation results were also in good agreement with the experimental observations.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000608699300001

Environments of diphenyl ether and o-dichlorobenzene solvents were simulated implicitly by means of the SMD solvation model. The employed temperatures 505 K in diphenyl ether and 413 K in o-dichlorobenzene were more than two times larger than the cross-over temperature, implying shallow tunneling. The evaluated kinetic and energetic parameters using the CBS-QB3 method were in excellent agreement with the experimentally supplied data. The rate constant in diphenyl ether can be expressed by original and modified Arrhenius equations kCBS-QB3/Eckart(404-606K) = 6.46 x 10(12) exp(-19944.6/T) and kCBS-QB3/Eckart(404-606K) = 1.26 x 10(10)T(0.865) exp(-19516.8/T), respectively. Topological evolution along the reaction has been studied at the B3LYP/CBSB7 level in an o-dichlorobenzene environment using the quantum chemical topology tools. The electron density in C-O and C-S bonds was strongly polarized toward the oxygen and sulfur atoms, respectively, in such a manner that carbonyl and thiocarbonyl bonds cannot be described by Lewis's bonding model. Topological and chemical events along the reaction may be described as: (i) formation of a new monosynaptic basin V(C-1) associated with the pseudoradical center on the ipso-carbon atom by means of Fold (F-dagger) type catastrophe, and (ii) transformation of disynaptic basin V(C-1,O) into the monosynaptic basin V-3(O) associated with the heterolytic rupture of the C-1-O bond by means of elliptic umbilic (E) catastrophe, and merging of V-3(S) and V(C-1) monosynaptic basins into the new disynaptic basin of V(C-1,S) associated with the formation of the C-1-S bond via usual sharing of the non-bonding electron densities (C-1-to-S coupling of pseudoradical centers) by means of a Cusp (C) type catastrophe. The detailed picture of chemical events along the NKR reveals that the electron density flow does not take place in a cyclic and one-way curve, suggesting a non-concerted mechanism.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000689017300001

MIL-125-NH2 as many other MOFs has a microporous structure with pore diameters less than 2 nm. Compared with common MOFs, hierarchical mesoporous materials exhibit very large specific surface areas that facilitate diffusion of active species, accelerate subsequent surface reactions, and increase the bubble release rate by providing larger free spaces. Thus, the development of a facile method to create hierarchical porous MOFs with larger pore sizes remains a chemical challenge. Furthermore, MOF-type semiconducting materials usually have low activities in oxygen evolution reaction, and the presence of a suitable cocatalyst is needed to reduce the large O-2 overpotential. This study attempted to generate a hierarchical MIL-125-NH 2 MOF material with embedded RuO2 nanopartides as a highly efficient cocatalyst in a simple one-step process for use in efficient solar water oxidation. Different amounts of RuCl3 center dot H2O precursor salt were used simultaneously for creating hierarchical porosity in MIL-125-NH2 and for producing the assumed RuO2 cocatalyst. For comparison, a hydrochloric acid treatment was applied to generate hierarchical porosity in the MOF in the absence of ruthenium. The samples were characterized using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller adsorption, powder X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. HRTEM gave evidence that in the ruthenium oxide-containing MIL-125-NH2 samples, tetragonal RuO2 nanoparticles are present. The materials were applied as photoelectrodes, and photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation performance under visible light illumination was studied. The PEC water oxidation performance of the MIL-125-NH2 layer could be strikingly improved with a photocurrent density of about 10 times more than that of the pure MOF at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode in artificial seawater, as a result of the hierarchical MOF structure and the presence of RuO2 as a cocatalyst. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations were performed to shed light on the electronic properties and the role of the RuO2 in the assumed hole transport.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			2168-0485			WOS:000602569600003

In this paper, we report a facile alteration of the surface chemistry of nanodiamond, a biocompatible nanocarbon, for application to environmental catalysis. The modulation is able to improve the redox capability of potassium ferricyanide (III) and to enhance the performance of the nanodiamond for activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to produce sulfate and hydroxyl radicals for catalytic oxidation.

As one of many advantages, they exhibit the potential to replace noble-metal catalysts with multinary combinations of transition metals because they offer formation of new unique and tailorable active sites of multiple elements located next to each other. This Perspective reports on the current state and on challenges of the (combinatorial) synthesis of multinary nanoparticles and advanced electron microscopy characterization techniques for revealing structure-activity correlations on an atomic scale. We discuss what distinguishes this material class from common catalysts to highlight their potential to act as electrocatalysts and rationalize their nontypical electrochemical behavior. We provide an overview about challenges in synthesis, characterization, and electrochemical evaluation and propose guidelines for future design of CSS catalysts to achieve further progress in this research field, which is still in its infancy.									78	3	0	0	2	0	79			2380-8195			WOS:000468015600029		
J	He, Lei; Ji, Yuxian; Cheng, Jin; Wang, Chunrong; Jiang, Longxin; Chen, Xiaoya; Li, Haiyan; Ke, Shu; Wang, Jianbing								Effect of pH and Cl- concentration on the electrochemical oxidation of pyridine in low-salinity reverse osmosis concentrate: Kinetics, mechanism, and toxicity assessment								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				449						137669	10.1016/j.cej.2022.137669				DEC 1 2022	2022	To reduce the pressure of salt separation crystallization and contaminants removal, we systematically investigated the electrochemical oxidation of pyridine (Pyr) in low-salinity reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC) using a Ti/RuO2-IrO2 anode with a high-performance chlorine evolution reaction. We mainly focused on the pH- and Cl- concentration-dependent reaction kinetics, degradation mechanisms, and toxicity assessment. Specifically, the Pyr degradation followed a pseudo-first-order kinetic model. A pH-dependent reaction kinetics study showed that reactive chlorine species (RCS) and & BULL;OH were the dominant species that reacted with Pyr. Furthermore, the degradation efficiency of Pyr reached its maximum value at pH 2, owing to the formation of more RCS. Additionally, Pyr degradation depends on the contribution of RCS in the presence of Cl-. Under low and high Cl- concentrations, the secondary effects were free available chlorine (FAC) and & BULL;OH, respectively. The concentration of trichloromethane (TCM) increased to 9.96 mu M first and then decreased to 5.42 mu M within 90 min. The variation trend in its concentration is consistent with that of the RCS contribution under different pH and Cl- concentration. The active sites of Pyr were calculated using frontier electron density (FED) and Laplacian bond order (LBO) calculations. The degradation performance and mechanisms of Pyr, wherein ring cleavage on the 6 N atom of Pyr was the main mechanism by electrochemical treatment, were explored through theoretical calculations and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The generation of transformation products (TPs) increased the toxicity of the Pyr water after electrochemical treatment. The overall findings provide new insights into the treatment of ROC, offering significant reference information for improving water utilization and near-zero liquid discharge (near-ZLD) of real wastewater.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000823033400001

A high N-doping level, 8-11 at. %, was achieved at a moderate temperature. The sample of NG-700, obtained at a calcination temperature of 700 degrees C, showed the highest efficiency in degradation of phenol solutions by metal-free catalytic activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS). The catalytic activity of the N-doped rGO (NG-700) was about 80 times higher than that of undoped rGO in phenol degradation. Moreover, the activity of NG-700 was 18.5 times higher than that of the most popular metal-based catalyst of nanocrystalline Co3O4 in PMS activation. Theoretical calculations using spin-unrestricted density functional theory (DFT) were carried out to probe the active sites for PMS activation on N-doped graphene. In addition, experimental detection of generated radicals using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and competitive radical reactions was performed to reveal the PMS activation processes and pathways of phenol degradation on nanocarbons. It was observed that both center dot OH and SO4 center dot- existed in the oxidation processes and played critical roles for phenol oxidation.									494	24	0	0	210	0	509			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000350193000036	25632991

Moreover, Ni2P, Fe2P, CoP, NiMoP and CoMoP were tested in DRM for the first time. A comparison of various phosphide catalysts identified Mo-based phosphides (MoP, NiMoP and CoMoP) as having much higher DRM activity than phosphides of W, Ni, Fe and Co. It was worth mentioning that CoMoP can show a similar catalytic activity and stability to the Pt/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst. The XRD, Raman and SEM results indicated that the resistance to coking, bulk oxidation and sintering of Mo-based phosphides was higher than that of phosphides of metals (W, Ni, Co and Fe). Furthermore, CoMoP exhibited the highest resistance to coking, oxidation and sintering among these phosphide catalysts. It was proposed that both the quantity and location of active sites for CH4 and CO2 dissociation over phosphides were crucial to maintain the oxidation-reduction cycle in DRM.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2058-9883			WOS:000526701700009

Results revealed that when a two-phase flow of circulating water at the anode is either slug or annular, then mass transport of the water for the anode reaction is degraded, and that the concentration overvoltage increases at higher current density compared to that when the flow is bubbly. In a serpentine-dual flow field, when both phases of the two-phase flow are assumed laminar, then the increase in pressure drop caused by the increase in gas production can be explained relatively well using the Lockhart-Martinelli method with the Chisholm parameter. The optimal flow rate of circulating water was also discussed based on mass balance analysis. (C) 2010 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

NaCl at both doses caused significant loss in growth, le content, K+/Na+ ratio, total chlorophyll and photosynthetic oxygen evolution. Further, N supplementation influences growth of test seedlings, that attained maximum growth in HN followed by MN, LN and deprived N conditions. N at HN level significantly declined Na+ accumulation in the cell and enhanced level of K+. NaCl treatment enhanced level of oxidative stress biomarkers: superoxide radical (O-2(center dot)-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), MDA equivalents contents and electrolyte leakage in leaf as well as root despite enhanced activity of SOD, POD, CAT and GST, and enzymes participating in the ascorbate-glutathione cycle (AsA-GSH cycle) viz. APX, DHAR and GR. At the same time, higher contents of total AsA (MA + DHA) and total GSH (GSH + GSSG), and maintained ratios of AsA/DHA and GSH/GSSG in HN fed seedlings were observed. Overall, the results suggest that HN supplementation was able in alleviating NaCl induced toxicity in test seedlings which was mainly due to the up-regulation of the MA-GSH cycle, K+ and K+/Na+ ratio, which resulted into better growth performance of HN fed seedlings under NaCl stress while reverse was noticed for LN and deprive N conditions.									18	1	0	0	12	0	19			0981-9428	1873-2690		WOS:000475997300047	31252252

Here, we report a fully integrated photochemical molecular dyad composed of a ruthenium-complex photosensitizer covalently linked to a Dawson polyoxometalate that acts as an electron-storage site and hydrogen-evolving catalyst. Visible-light irradiation of the system in solution leads to charge separation and electron storage on the polyoxometalate, effectively resulting in a liquid fuel. In contrast to related, earlier dyads, this system enables the harvesting, storage and delayed release of solar energy. On-demand hydrogen release is possible by adding a proton donor to the dyad solution. The system is a minimal molecular model for artificial photosynthesis and enables the spatial and temporal separation of light absorption, fuel storage and hydrogen release.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1755-4330	1755-4349		WOS:000749154100003	35087218

However, the feasibility of using the crystal for hydrogen production through photocatalytic water splitting has not been explored. Here, we systematically investigated the structural, electronic, optical, and transport properties of XGaS2 (X = Ag or Cu) with orthorhombic structure by using the first principles calculations. The band alignments indicate that all calculated absolute potentials of the valence and conduction band edges met the requirement of photocatalytic water splitting reaction. The presence of 2.64 and 2.56 eV direct band energy gaps and obvious optical absorption within the visible light range imply that XGaS2 can correspond to solar light. Moreover, the large electron mobility and the obvious differences between electron mobility and hole mobility were identified in XGaS2 structures, which is beneficial to the photocatalytic performance of the water splitting reaction. The present findings can provide a helpful reference for developing novel photocatalytic materials with XGaS2 for hydrogen generation from water splitting under irradiation of visible light.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0020-7608	1097-461X		WOS:000508737200001

The amount of divalent Ni2+ substituted by trivalent Al3+ within the lattice of alpha-Ni(OH)(2) was controlled by the concentration of Al(NO3)(3)center dot 9H(2)O solution. X-ray diffraction studies reveal pure phase Ni-Al LDH, isostructural and isomorphic to alpha-Ni(OH)(2) with higher interlayer distance. The electrochemical properties of the cathode materials containing 0, 8.6, 13.8, 17.8, 21.3 and 23.4 Al% were evaluated by the means of charge-discharge and cyclic voltammetry measurements. The overall comparison indicates that Ni-Al LDH/C composites have higher electrochemical performance than pure alpha-Ni(OH)(2)/C composite. The cathode with 17.8 Al% exhibits the best performance at 1 C compared to other Al3+ contents: a much lower voltage plateau, well separated from the oxygen evolution at the end of the charging as well as a single flat and high discharge plateau with a discharge capacity of 376.9 mAh g(comp)(-1). Short term durability test for 80 cycles showed that the electrode containing 13.8 Al% has the highest discharge rate at 2 C. The range of Al substitution 13.8-17.8 Al% provides a good electrochemical response. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									41	5	0	0	1	0	43			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000280974800025

ICE-L by the molecular biological methods. The transcriptional expression patterns of ICE-LGPx under different salinity and temperature stresses were determined by the real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the activities of ICE-LGPx were assayed under salinity stress as well. The full-length cDNA sequence of ICE-LGPx mRNA was 1956bp including an ORF of 765bp. Molecular structure analysis revealed that ICE-LGPx was a selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (Se-GPx) containing a form-2 SECIS (SelenoCysteine Insertion Sequence) element. Phylogenetic analysis showed that ICE-LGPx displayed parallel evolution with those of Volvox carteri, Chlorella variabilis, Micromonas sp. RCC299 and Micromonas pusilla. The expression analysis results indicated that transcription of ICE-LGPx was induced by the changes of the salinity and temperature. The change tendency of enzyme activities was similar to that of ICE-LGPx mRNA level. Time- and dose-dependent effects were observed in the salinity treatments and time-dependent effects were found in the temperature treatments as well. These results suggested that ICE-LGPx might play an important role in the acclimatization of Chlamydomonas sp. ICE-L to salt and low temperature stresses. Furthermore, the results of this investigation may help to clarify the acclimatization and stress response mechanisms of Antarctic ice alga.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1322-0829	1440-1835		WOS:000437840100003

For potential values in the double layer region, the impedance behavior observed at low frequency was attributed to the double layer capacitance of the oxide/electrolyte interface, while at high frequency it was attributed to a mass transport limited process occurring in difficult-to-access oxide regions. The main source of ohmic resistance of the system is the solution resistance and low proton transport, necessary for the Ir(III)/Ir(IV) redox transitions to occur in more difficult to reach oxide regions. The electrocatalytic properties as a function of composition, studied using the OER in 1.0 mol dm(-3) HClO4 as a model reaction, revealed ternary mixture have slightly superior real catalytic properties when compared to the binary mixtures. The behavior of the charging processes as a function of composition was analyzed based on the double layer parameters. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

CHILLING SUSCEPTIBILITY OF CUCUMIS-SATIVUS SPECIES								PHYTOCHEMISTRY				33	1			61	67		10.1016/0031-9422(93)85397-A				MAY 1993	1993	Susceptibility to chilling of leaves of Cucumis sativus was studied using two relatively tolerant (CT) species: Borszczagowski and line 303 and two sensitive (CS) species: Skierniewicki and Skierniewicki x Borszczagowski. The response to chilling was followed during chilling at 4.5-degrees for three days by measurement of the rate of inactivation of O2 evolution, deacylation of monogalactosyldiglyceryde (MGDG) and digalactosyldiglyceride (DGDG) and accumulation of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) in thylakoids. The most characteristic feature of CS species was rapid accumulation of NEFA after the first day of chilling followed by a 75% decrease of O2 evolution activity after the second day of chilling in comparison to CT species. The original level of NEFA in thylakoids is a characteristic feature of each species and it does not affect O2 evolution. Both parameters were higher in control samples and after chilling stress in CT in comparison with those determined in CS species. However, net accumulation of NEFA after chilling, in relation to the original level, was faster and greater by a factor of 2.45 in CS plants in comparison with 1.90 estimated for CT ones. Thus, a fast deacylation of membrane lipids, mainly MGDG, at the beginning of chilling seems to be the characteristic and prime feature of chilling sensitive plants. Total NEFA content and inactivation of O2 evolution upon chilling are rather secondary events. During chilling the content of MGDG decreased by ca 40% whereas that of DGDG dropped only by ca 5-10% of the control. Partially hydrolysed MGDG seems to be the main source of free 18:3. The data suggest that when acting in situ endogenous lipid acyl hydrolase (EC 3.1.1.26)-galactolipase (LAH) in cucumber thylakoids results in release of only 1 mol of fatty acids per mol galactolipid degraded.									8	2	0	0	8	0	10			0031-9422			WOS:A1993LB56100012

The structure of apo OSBS was solved by multiple isomorphous replacement in space group P2(1)2(1)2(1); the structure of the complex with Mg2+. OSB was solved by molecular replacement in space group P2(1)2(1)2. The two domain fold found for OSBS is similar to those found for other members of the enolase superfamily: a mixed alpha/beta capping domain formed from segments at the N- and C-termini of the polypeptide and a larger (alpha/beta)(7)beta barrel domain. Two regions of disorder were found in the structure of apo OSBS: (i) the loop between the first two beta-strands in the alpha/beta domain; and (ii) the first sheet-helix pair in the barrel domain. These regions are ordered in the product complex with Mg2+. OSB. As expected, the Mg2+. OSB pair is bound at the C-terminal end of the barrel domain. The electron density for the phenyl succinate component of the product is well-defined; however, the 1-carboxylate appears to adopt multiple conformations. The metal is octahedrally coordinated by Asp(161), Glu(190), and Asp(213), two water molecules, and one oxygen of the benzoate carboxylate group of OSB. The loop between the first two beta-strands in the alpha/beta motif interacts with the aromatic ring of OSB, Lys(133) and Lys(235) are positioned to function as acid/base catalysts in the dehydration reaction. Few hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interactions are involved in the binding of OSB to the active site; instead, most of the interactions between OSB and the protein an either indirect via water molecules or via hydrophobic interactions. As a result, evolution of both the shape and the volume of the active site should be subject to few structural constraints. This would provide a structural strategy for the evolution of new catalytic activities in homologues of OSBS and a likely explanation for how the OSBS from Amycolaptosis also can catalyze the racemization of N-acylamino acids [Palmer, D.

Photoelectrocatalysts have been widely used for this application, and several metal oxides can be applied as catalysts. Among them, we highlight zinc oxide nanorods (ZnONRs) and titanate nanotubes (TiNTs); however, their individual nanostructures exhibit disadvantages. For example, ZnONRs show rapid recombination of the photogenerated charges, and TiNTs give rise to randomly oriented films; these disadvantages limit their application as photoanodes. In this study, for the first time, we present a new class of multihierarchical electrodes based on TiNT-decorated ZnONR films that exhibited superior results to the individual species. The TiNTs are homogenously dispersed over the surface of the rods without forming agglomerates, giving rise to a heterojunction that exhibits lower recombination rates. It was found that the results are better when the contents of TiNTs in the electrode are higher; thus, glycine was successfully used as a bridge to link both of the structures, increasing the amount of TiNTs decorating the rods. As a result, the photocurrent generated with these multihierarchical electrodes is higher than that obtained with pure ZnONR electrodes (0.9 mA cm(-2) and 0.45 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE, respectively), and the electrode potentials for O-2 evolution are lower than those observed for pure TiNT electrodes (0 V and 0.8 V vs. E-RHE, respectively). The IPCE values are also higher for the multihierarchical electrodes.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000367625000028

Among the most potent are the reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates. Coelomocytes from invertebrates subserve many of the same functions. In order to determine whether invertebrate phagocytes employ reactive nitrogen intermediates, we investigated the effect of various nonspecific stimulators and invertebrate interleukin (IL)-1 alpha- and beta-like molecules on nitric oxide (NO) production. Elevated NO release by stimulated coelomocytes was seen after 24 h. Incubation of stimulated coelomocytes in the presence of arginine analogs inhibited NO release. When invertebrate IL-l-like molecules were added to the coelomocytes, they stimulated the release of NO. Western blot analysis using a polyclonal rabbit antiserum to murine NO synthase detected a band at approximate to 125 kDa. These data indicate that coelomocytes are capable of producing and releasing NO and that NO is a chemical mediator that has been conserved as a host defense weapon of phagocytes through evolutionary time.

Exploration of their contribution to life-extending or -compromising effects is mandatory. Among reactive oxygen species (ROS), hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) is the most damaging species. Due to its short half-life, the assay has to contain a specific generation system. Plants synthesize flavonoids, phenolic compounds recognized as counter-agents to coronary heart disease. Their antioxidant activities are affected by their hydroxylation patterns. Moreover, in the plant, they mainly occur as glycosides. We chose three derivatives, quercetin, luteolin, and rutin, in attempts to explore their redox chemistry in contrasting hydrogen peroxide environments. Initial addition of hydrogen peroxide in high concentration or gradual development constituted a main factor affecting their redox chemical properties, especially in case of quercetin. Our study exemplifies that a combination of a chemical assay (deoxyribose degradation) with an electrochemical method (square-wave voltammetry) provides insightful data. The ambiguity of the tested flavonoids to act either as anti- or pro-oxidant may complicate categorization, but probably contributed to their evolution as components of a successful metabolic system that benefits both producer and consumer.									18	0	0	0	8	0	18				1422-0067		WOS:000320772500063	23736691

The CBM is essential for rational design of an electron-selective contact of the negative electrode in perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, the CBM position controls the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells, anodes of Li-ion batteries and various reductive photoelectrochemical reactions, such as reductions of H+ and CO2. This review is selective rather than comprehensive, and points also at open points and contradictions in the field.					10th European Meeting on Solar Chemistry and Photocatalysis - Environmental Applications (SPEA)10th European Meeting on Solar Chemistry and Photocatalysis - Environmental Applications (SPEA)	JUN 04-08, 2018JUN 04-08, 2018	Univ AlmeriaUniv Almeria	Almeria, SPAINAlmeria, SPAIN	20	0	0	0	0	0	20			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000461462200009

We report here that soybean (Glycine max) root nodules contain at least 14 forms of GST, with GST9 being most prevalent, as measured by both real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and identification of peptides in glutathione-affinity purified extracts. GST8 was prevalent in stems and uninfected roots, whereas GST2/10 prevailed in leaves. Purified, recombinant GSTs were shown to have wide-ranging kinetic properties, suggesting that the suite of GSTs could provide physiological flexibility to deal with numerous stresses. Levels of GST9 increased with aging, suggesting a role related to senescence. RNA interference studies of nodules on composite plants showed that a down-regulation of GST9 led to a decrease in nitrogenase (acetylene reduction) activity and an increase in oxidatively damaged proteins. These findings indicate that GSTs are abundant in nodules and likely function to provide antioxidant defenses that are critical to support nitrogen fixation.									87	2	2	0	84	1	94			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000265661700042	19279195

Two turnovers of the oxygen evolving center (OEC) beyond the modified S-2' state are required for the appearance of these signals. The formation of the signals correlated with that of an asymmetric (singlet-like) EPR signal observed at g approximate to 2. Spectral simulation indicated that both signals arose from a transition between \2(+/-)> levels with intradoublet splitting of Delta = 0.276 cm(-1) in an S = 2 spin system. Furthermore, the two signals in parallel and perpendicular modes were formed at the same time, indicating that the same metal center was responsible. The molecular z-axis of the S = 2 spin system for the signals was almost parallel to the plane of thylakoid membranes. These results indicate that. the Mn cluster in the photosynthetic oxygen evolving center is the source of the new EPR species which may be a Mn(IV)-Mn(IV) or Mn(III)-Mn(III) dimer or a Mn(III) monomer. Redox events of the Mn cluster in the Ca2+-depleted PS II are discussed based on these observations.									13	0	0	0	11	0	13			0006-2960			WOS:000072523600010	9485430

However, its efficiency remains far from real application owing to the poor light harvesting and ultrafast charge recombination of photocatalysts. To address these issues, herein, we employed a novel but simple chemical bath deposition (CBD) method to construct CdS/SrTiO3 nanodots-on- nanocubes at room temperature (ca. 25 degrees C). The as-synthesized nanohybrids not only expand light absorption from ultraviolet (UV) to visible light but also significantly retard charge recombination owing to the well-defined heterostructure formation. As a result, the CdS/SrTiO3 exhibits high photocatalytic performance with H-2 evolution rate of 1322 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), which is 2.8 and 12.2 times higher than that of pristine CdS and SrTiO3, respectively. This work provides a universal approach for the heterostructure construction, and inspired by this, higher efficient photocatalysts for H-2 evolution may be developed in the near future.

Herein, we synthesized blue-colored oxygen-vacant Bi2WO6-x inside butterfly wing architectures (BW-Bi2WO6-x) via modified functionalization and solvothermal techniques. Given that the (WO4)(2-) layer in Bi2WO6 structurally resembles the structure of WO3, the introduction of oxygen vacancies (OVs) boosts the solar light absorption in comparison to the short visible light absorption range (<450 nm) in pristine Bi2WO6 (P-Bi2WO6). Hence, the fabricated BW-Bi2WO6-x sample exhibited broadened photo-absorption over the visible to NIR wavelength range, improved semiconductor attachment on the wing architecture and heightened surface area with numerous active sites for the adsorption of POP molecules. The performance of the BW-Bi2WO6-x photocatalyst was monitored for the elimination of methylene blue (MB), rhodamine B (RhB) and 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) under UV light exposure, yielding 91%, 92% and 94% degradation, respectively, in 60 min. Similarly, the degradation efficiencies of 94%, 98% and 98% for the photodegradation of MB, RhB and 4-CP under visible light for 60 min, respectively, were observed. Under NIR light, 80%, 79% and 85% degradation efficiencies were observed for MB, RhB and 4-CP, respectively, after 60 min. Therefore, the proposed BW-Bi2WO6-x sample can provide insights and inspire the development of photo-responsive materials for applications in energy, defense and water treatment.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000802022800001	35615970

The nanocomposite was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which showed that nanospindle-like Sn-doped hematite and CaMn2O4 nanowire contact intimately in the nanocomposite, resulting in efficient charge transfer and separation. Photoelectrochemical results reveal that the nanocomposite possesses higher donor density, enhanced conductivity and lower overpotential for dioxygen evolution. In addition, the nanocomposite demonstrates high photocatalytic activity for water oxidation to produce oxygen in a photoelectrochemical cell. The amount of O-2 evolved from the optimized photoanode of the photoelectrochemical cell was 1.98 mu mol in 2 h of simulated sunlight irradiation. This work demonstrates a facile synthesis of a novel nanocomposite as anode material for photocatalytic water oxidation to produce O-2. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Among the studies on DCF toxicity, several ones have reported its harmful effects on plants and algae. To gain a better understanding of the mechanisms of DCF toxicity towards green algae, we used a synchronous Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cc-1690 culture and compared DCF (135 mg/L) effects with effects caused by atrazine (ATR; 77.6 mu g/L), an herbicide with a well-known mechanism of toxic action. To achieve our goal, cell number and size, photosynthetic oxygen consumption/evolution, chlorophyll a fluorescence in vivo, H2O2 production by the cells, antioxidative enzymes encoding genes expression were analyzed during light phase of the cell cycle.We have found, that DCF and ATR affect C. reinhardtii through different mechanisms. ATR inhibited the photosynthetic electron transport chain and induced oxidative stress in chloroplast. Such chlomplastic energetics disruption indirectly influenced respiration, the intensification of which could partially mitigate low efficiency of photosynthetic energy production. As a result, ATR inhibited the growth of single cell leading to limitation in C. reinhardtii population development. In contrast to ATR-treated algae, in DCF-treated cells the fraction of active PSII reaction centers was diminished without drastic changes in electron transport or oxidative stress symptoms in chloroplast. However, significant increase in transcript level of gene encoding for mitochondria-located catalase indicates respiratory processes as a source of H2O2 overproduced in the DCF-treated cells. Because the single cell growth was not strongly affected by DCF, its adverse effect on progeny cell number seemed to be related rather to arresting of cell divisions. Concluding, although the DCF phytotoxic action appeared to be different from the action of the typical herbicide ATR, it can act as algal growth-inhibiting factor in the environment.									5	0	0	0	5	0	6			0166-445X	1879-1514		WOS:000600837200011	33307391

Therein, photothermal synergy induced photothermalcatalysis (PTC) sometimes tells different stories from PC. In this work, we revisit ST-01 TiO2 photocatalyst as photothermalcatalyst under blue light at 333 K and further investigate the role of surface grafted cocatalyst (CrxO, CoxO, CuxO, Pt) in catalytic removal of gaseous acetaldehyde pollutant. By comparison on the amount of cocatalyst, for PC, more CrxO cocatalyst (3 wt%) is favored for higher removal efficiency of acetaldehyde. For PTC, less CrxO cocatalyst (0.3 wt%) is favored. By further comparison on the type of cocatalyst, for PC, hole cocatalyst (CrxO and CoxO) gives inferior performance to that of electron cocatalyst (CuxO and Pt). For PTC, hole cocatalyst gives superior performance to that of electron cocatalyst. The difference between PC and PTC lies in synergistic effect between defect-related blue-light absorption, cocatalyst induced interfacial charge transfer and matched surface red-ox reaction rate. This work may provide new insight into the design and development of photothermalcatalyst for VOC removal.									11	1	0	0	2	0	11			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000475744800034

By sol-gel and thermal deposition methods, SnO2-Sb2O5 are embedded into TiO2 nanotubes (TiO2-NTs). Through EFSEM and XRD analysis. it is known that SnO2-Sb2O5 and Ti substrate consist of an integrative electrode by the formation of TiO2-NTs. Meanwhile, in contrast with the typical SnO2-based (Ti/SnO2-Sb2O5) electrode, TiO2-NTs/SnO2-Sb2O5 electrode can increase the load capacity of Sb-doped SnO2 and electrode's surface wettability. Compared with the poor service life of Ti/SnO2-Sb2O5 electrode, this novel embedded electrode enhances the service life sharply. Besides, according to the electrochemical experiments, TiO2-NTs/SnO2-Sb2O5 electrode is superior to Ti/SnO2-Sb2O5 electrode for electrochemical performance. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Undoped, singly-doped, and co-doped powders were synthesized in an X-ray amorphous state, heat treated in air, and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at different crystallization stages. In particular, in situ TEM analyses were carried out during heating in an oxygen atmosphere, in order to follow the evolution of structure and morphology and to understand the role of the dopants. The key structural effect of dopants was the inhibition of grain coarsening during heat treatment. Functional tests were carried out with micro-single chamber SOFCs, fed with a CH4/O-2 mixture, the anodes of which were prepared with the CeO2-Ni powders synthesized in this study. A correlation was established between the electrocatalytic performance and the morphology of the anodic material, pinpointing that the finer and more homogeneous nanocrystalline structure of the doped powders results in better-defined and more active catalytic sites, thus improving the performance of the cell.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000449819800011

The composite with suitable absorption edge and increased exposed surface sites are favourable for furnishing sufficient visible light-induced electrons to realize excellent and stable photoreduction of atmospheric N-2 into NH3. The decoration of Mn3O4 on C3N4/MoS2 can not only consume part of hole for OER, but also inhabits the HER property of the composite and utilizes more electrons for N-2 reduction. The NH3 generation rate is as high as 185 mu mol h(-1) g(-1). The results presented herein provide new insights into rational design and engineering for the creation of highly active catalysts with visible light sensitive activity toward efficient, stable, and sustainable visible light N-2 fixation in mild conditions.									21	0	0	0	3	0	21			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000591345400003

The reaction was carried out under an Ar atmosphere in the temperature range of 200-280 degrees C for 2 h. The final product was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), (high-resolution) transmission electron microscopy (TEM/HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), HAADF-STEM-EDS mapping and nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms. It was found that pure Cu2O was always obtained in the temperature range of 200-280 degrees C and well retained the outline of the precursor. Nevertheless, electrochemical experiments showed that porous Cu2O nanorods prepared at 200 degrees C (labeled as Cu2O-200) exhibited much stronger HER catalytic activity than those obtained at higher temperatures, which were labeled as Cu2O-220, Cu2O-240, Cu2O-260 and Cu2O-280, respectively. In an alkaline solution of 1.0 M KOH, Cu2O-200 presented a low over-potential of similar to 184 mV, a small Tafel slope of 106 mV dec(-1), and a high durability over 20 h at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The above good performances were attributed to the high surface area and high-speed electronic transmission networks of Cu2O-200, which provided fast transportation and short diffusion path for the electrolyte and evolved H-2 bubbles.									13	2	0	0	0	0	13			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000457270000005	30534772

Here we report a remarkable enhancement of electro-catalytic activity of cobalt-free (La0.6Sr0.4)(0.98)FeO3-delta (LSF) electrodes by applying a nanoengineered hybrid catalyst coating composed of nanoparticles of Ce0.85Gd0.15O2-delta (CGO) and Pr(6)O(11)via co-infiltration. Different from the conventional infiltration with a precursor of metal nitrate, here a mixture solution of colloidal CGO nanocrystals and Pr(NO3)(3) is used for infiltration to enable the desired nanoengineered architecture. The resulting hybrid-catalyst-coated LSF electrode exhibits a very low polarization resistance of 0.017 omega cm(2) at 750 degrees C, about one order of magnitude lower than that of bare LSF (0.197 omega cm(2)). Furthermore, the Ni/yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) fuel-electrode-supported cell with this hybrid-catalyst-coated LSF electrode displays excellent performance in both fuel-cell and electrolysis operations, while it also offers good durability tracked over 1000 h of fuel-cell operation. The unique catalytic activity of the hybrid-catalyst-coated LSF electrode is attributed to the combined effects of accelerating oxygen surface exchange kinetics by Pr6O11 and enhancing the available surface area by the nanoporous architecture of the catalyst coating. Moreover, combined with the modification of the Ni/YSZ electrode, stable electrolysis operation at 650 degrees C under -0.5 A cm(-2) with a voltage close to 1.3 V is achieved on a cell prepared without cobalt. This work not only opens the opportunity for applying cobalt-free oxygen electrodes in SOCs but also proposes a co-infiltration strategy to develop a highly active and robust catalyst coating by combined tuning of composition and morphology, which may also be applicable to other devices such as metal-air batteries and membrane reactors.									9	1	0	0	1	0	9			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000536095500022

A particular attention was paid to the comparison of the surface and the bulk chemical compositions of the films determined by different analysis techniques: X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS), wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (WDS) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). XPS and EDS show an underestimation in carbon concentration compared to RBS and WDS which provide similar values. This underestimation is more important in case of XPS and it is mainly attributed to the presence of oxygen contamination on the surface of the films strongly bonded to titanium. In case of EDS, the underestimation is related to the poor sensitivity of the used probe in regard to light elements such as carbon. Moreover, the structure of the coatings has been extensively probed by transmission electron microscopy, which has shown that the size of the TiC nanopartides shrinks when increasing the carbon content within the films. We further demonstrate that this structural evolution has a direct impact on the hardness of the coatings which gets reduced when the grain size decreases. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Hydrogen and oxygen were produced from pure water over BaZr1-xSnxO3 photocatalysts without the assistance of any cocatalysts under ultraviolet light irradiation, and the highest gases evolution rate (138 mu mol h(-1) for H-2 and 37 mu mol h(-1) for O-2) was observed over 0.2 g BaZr0.7Sn0.3O3 photocatalyst. Density functional theory calculations of BaZr1-xSnxO3 (x = 0, 0.25, and 0.5) indicate that, as Sn concentration increases, the contribution of Sn 5s orbitals to the bottom of the conduction band gradually becomes dominant and the band gap type of BaZr1-xSnxO3 was switched from indirect to direct. The participation of the Sn 5s orbitals in the electronic structure of BaZrO3 not only reduces the energy band gap but also affects the charge carrier excitation process, thus resulting in the different H-2 production rate.									50	3	0	0	6	0	50			0959-9428			WOS:000280656200025		
B	Yin, Z.; Eckert, Z.; Adamovich, I.V.; Lempert, W.R.								Time-Resolved Measurements of Temperature and Species Concentrations Distributions in Ar-Based Mixtures Excited by a Nanosecond Pulse Discharge								52nd AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting								25 pp.	25 pp.						2013	2013	Temperature and absolute concentrations of OH and H are measured by UV Rayleigh scattering, Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF), and Two-Photon Absorption LIF (TALIF), respectively, in Ar-based mixtures (Ar:H2=100:2 and Ar:O2:H2=80:20:2) at P=40 torr and T0=300 K. Each mixture is excited by a 50-pulse burst of a repetitive nanosecond pulse filament discharge, operated at 100 kHz pulse repetition rate and 5 Hz burst repetition rate. One-dimensional radial distributions of temperature and species concentrations across the filament during and after the discharge burst are obtained from Rayleigh scattering and fluorescent images of the laser beam, taken by an intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD) camera. Both temperature and species concentration profiles are found to expand with time in both mixtures, with peak values of Tpeakap1200 K and [H]peakap4.0.1015 cm-3 in the Ar:H2=100:2 mixture, and Tpeakap1200 K, [H]peakap6.0.1015 cm-3, and [OH]peakap1.0.1015 cm-3 in the Ar:O2:H2=80:20:2 mixture. H atom radial profile develops a local minimum on the discharge centerline in both mixtures, but is much more pronounced in the Ar:H2=100:2 mixture. In the Ar:O2:H2=80:20:2 mixture, secondary maxima in OH distributions are detected near the periphery of the filament after a few tens of discharge pulses. Experimental results from the Ar:O2:H2=80:20:2 mixture are compared with predictions of a plasma-assisted combustion chemistry model. The model reproduces trends in time evolution of radial distributions of temperature, as well as OH and H concentrations. Based on rate of species production analysis, the secondary peaks in OH radial distributions are caused by radial diffusion of H atoms from the central region of the discharge filament, with subsequent formation of HO2 and OH via reactions H+O2+MrarrHO2+M and H+HO2rarrOH+OH in the low-temperature peripheral regions. The results demonstrate significant potential of the present approach for quantitative, time- and spatially-resolved studies of coupled radical reaction kinetics and diffusion over a wide range of temperatures, pressures, and mixture compositions.					52nd AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting52nd AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting	13-17 Jan. 201413-17 Jan. 2014		National Harbor, MD, USANational Harbor, MD, USA	0	0	0		0	0	0					978-1-62410-256-1	INSPEC:14129257

Compared to the well-studied noble metal catalysts, heterogeneous catalysts based on low-cost transition metals are rarely reported. In this study, we developed an efficient and controllable route to synthesize a new kind of heterogeneous catalyst of iron phosphide nanoparticles encapsulated in a doped carbon matrix for the chemoselective hydrogenation of aromatic nitroarenes to anilines. Making use of the chemical reaction between Fe atoms in a MIL-88B-NH2 core and phosphorus atoms in a poly(cyclotriphosphazene-co-4,4-sulfonyldiphenol) (PZS) shell, iron phosphide nanoparticles encapsulated in a doped carbon matrix were successfully prepared through direct calcinations of a Fe-MOF@PZS core@shell precursor at 900 degrees C for 2 h under an Ar atmosphere. Due to the relative high surface area and porous structure as well as small nanoparticles, the prepared catalyst showed high catalytic activity, excellent selectivity and recyclability for the hydrogenation of aromatic nitroarenes to anilines.									19	1	0	0	3	0	20			2052-1553			WOS:000432586100012

Herein, a facile structure and doping engineering strategy is proposed to obtain the atomic-thin mesoporous graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets with a large specific surface area of 212.5 m(2) g(-1), an ultra-large pore volume of 1.55 cm(3) g(-1), high C and O contents of similar to 51.4 and 4.8% via an acid-assisted exfoliation route without any hard templates. The theoretical calculation reveals that the introduction of additional C/O atoms into g-C3N4 matrix would boost the charge transfer rate and charge separation efficiency due to the enhanced electronic polarization effect (Bader Charge) and shortened bond lengths. Additionally, the electronic conductivity is demonstrated to be enhanced due to the formation of delocalized pi-bonding both experimentally and theoretically. The synergic contribution of textural and electronic features renders an excellent photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance with 50-60 times larger photocurrent in comparison with the pristine g-C3N4 and high hydrogen evolution rates of 830.1 and 115.5 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) under the solar- and visible-light irradiation, respectively. This in-situ exfoliation approach demonstrates a facile yet efficient method to synthesize highly porous carbon nitride materials with optimal structure and composition for efficient water splitting.									73	5	0	0	8	0	75			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000463032200066		
J	HARRISON, WJ; SUMMA, LL								PALEOHYDROLOGY OF THE GULF OF MEXICO BASIN								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE				291	2			109	176		10.2475/ajs.291.2.109				FEB 1991	1991	We have used two dimensional numerical modeling of groundwater movement to examine the controls on geopressure evolution and the interactions between the compactional and meteoric hydrologic regimes in the Gulf of Mexico basin. Our analysis examines the paleohydrologic history of the Gulf from Jurassic to present time and demonstrates that geopressures in the Gulf basin can be accounted for largely by compaction disequilibrium. The requirements for compactional geopressures to be developed are: (1) low permeability sediments, (2) thick shale sequences, (3) sedimentation rates of > 1 mm/yr for pressures approaching lithostatic gradients and > 0.1 mm/yr for moderate overpressure developments. Aquathermal pressuring contributes less than 1 percent to the total pore pressures in these geologic settings. The role of dehydration water released during the conversion of the clay mineral smectite to the clay mineral illite is not crucial to geopressure development in the Gulf basin.We have defined three stages in the paleohydrologic evolution of the Gulf basin. In the first stage from Jurassic to early Tertiary times, the basin was characterized by circulating waters of meteoric origin, driven into the basin by topographic elevation episodically enhanced by eustatic falls in sealevel. Abnormal pressures were restricted to the very deepest parts of the basin beyond the shelf margin. In the second stage, during much of the Tertiary, geopressures developed beneath the major sedimentary depocenters related to the positions of the ancestral Mississippi and Rio Grande river systems. The circulation of meteoric water became restricted by the opposing compactional hydraulic heads. The third stage in the development of Gulf basin hydrology began in late Miocene times and continues to the present day. Rapid increases in sedimentation rates in the area around the Mississippi delta have resulted in the widespread distribution of geopressured sediments that have pressure gradients approaching lithostatic. These pressures have been superimposed on sediments that were normally pressured for most of their burial history. Differences in the positions of the depocenters along the Gulf coast cause the duration of these three paleohydrologic stages to vary. For example, abnormal pressures developed as early as Eocene times in south Texas and are currently declining in response to reduced recent sediment accumulation rates.Eustatic rises and falls in sealevel have been important in shifting the interface between the meteoric regime and the compactional regime during Mesozoic and early Tertiary times before the onset of strong opposing geopressures. In Plio-Pleistocene times, relatively short lowstand durations may have prevented extensive diagenetic reactions in response to moving the freshwater interface but may have been long enough to allow bacterial degradation of hydrocarbons in reservoirs now buried to depths within the compactional regime. Our paleohydrologic analysis is supported by numerous observations of diagenetic reactions and geochemical measurements. Late sediment geopressuring is supported in particular by stable oxygen isotopic compositions of authigenic quartz. These data can be interpreted to show evidence for a progressive decrease in the amount of meteoric groundwater invading the basin from Mesozoic to present times.									179	14	0	0	5	0	190			0002-9599			WOS:A1991EV48600001

Nevertheless, realizing a higher efficiency is impeded by its band gap which can only harvest UV light. In order to extend the spectral response towards visible light, STO is (co)doped with lanthanum (La) and rhodium (Rh). However, notwithstanding the amount of visible light absorbed, the H-2 evolution rates are remarkably governed by the valence state of Rh, La doping level and ruthenium (Ru) cocatalyst loading. Hence, it is essential to unravel the underlying effect of doping on the photophysical processes to gain insight into material design. To this end, charge carrier dynamics was probed over a wide time (sub-picosecond to microsecond) and spectral (visible to IR) region using transient absorption spectroscopy. Depending on the dopant composition, an interplay between the electron trapping and the kinetics of the electron transfer to the Ru cocatalyst was rationalized. For Rh4+:STO, free electrons probed at 3435 nm decayed virtually completely by 20 ps resulting in a kinetic competition between the electron trapping and the electron transfer to Ru cocatalyst. In the case of Rh3+:STO, free electrons decayed by a factor of three by 100 ps, thus demonstrating the effect of Rh valence state on the electron lifetime. The time constant and quantum yield of electron transfer from Rh3+:STO to the Ru cocatalyst were found to be 1.6 ps and 14.7%, respectively. In addition to a longer electron lifetime, enhanced electron transfer to the Ru cocatalyst makes Rh3+:STO one of the promising photocatalysts for H-2 generation. Engineering the energetic position of the dopant within the band gap to avoid undesirable carrier trapping is crucial to enhance the efficiency of photocatalytic reactions.									37	3	0	0	2	0	37			2398-4902			WOS:000453816900011

Ferroelectrics provide access to light energy conversion that delivers above-bandgap voltages arising from spatial inversion symmetry breaking, whereas their wide bandgap leads to poor absorption of visible light. Bandgap narrowing offers a potential solution, but this material modification suppresses spontaneous polarization and, hence, sacrifices photovoltages. Here, we report successive-redox mediated ferrophotovoltaics that exhibit a robust visible-light response. Our single-crystal experiments and ab initio calculations, along with photo-luminescence analysis, demonstrate that divalent Fe2+ and trivalent Fe3+ coexisted in a prototypical ferroelectric barium titanate BaTiO3 introduce donor and acceptor levels, respectively, and that two sequential Fe3+/Fe2+ redox reactions enhance the photogenerated power not only under visible light but also at photon energies greater than the bandgap. Our approach opens a promising route to the visible-light activation of photovoltaics and, potentially, of photocatalysts. Photovoltaic response from normal ferroelectric materials generates large voltages but low current due to poor absorption of visible light. Noguchi et al. dope ferrous and ferric ion couple into barium titanate crystals to enhance the photogeneration at photon energies both below and above bandgap.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			2041-1723			WOS:000558871700005	32075971

Here we developed a Ni SAC on microwave exfoliated graphene oxide (Ni-N-MEGO) to achieve single atom loading of similar to 6.9 wt%, significantly higher than previously reported SACs. The atomically dispersed Ni atoms, stabilized by coordination with nitrogen, were found to be predominantly anchored along the edges of nanopores (< 6 nm) using a combination of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM). The Ni-N-MEGO exhibits an onset over potential of 0.18 V, and a current density of 53.6 mA mg(-1) at overpotential of 0.59 V for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), representing one of the best non-precious metal SACs reported so far in the literature. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the electrochemical CO2-to-CO conversion occurs more readily on the edge-anchored unsaturated nitrogen coordinated Ni single atoms that lead to enhanced activity toward CO2RR.									181	17	0	0	7	0	185			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000453616800031

Herein, rather than conventional covalent doping, we used the concept of interfacial charge transfer doping of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to noncovalently adsorb certain polyelectrolytes (i.e. poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride), PDDA, acceptor) onto pure CNTs (donor) to act as a buffer layer for richening reactants (OH-) via electrostatic interaction and to induce notable interfacial charge redistribution via directional intermolecular charge-transfer, which not only improves the reaction kinetics but also creates a high density of catalytic carbon sites, eventually transforming the inactive CNTs into efficient metal-free water oxidation catalysts. As expected, the resulting PDDA-adsorbed CNT catalysts yielded a remarkably lower overpotential of 370 mV at 10.0 mA cm(-2) with a smaller Tafel slope of 76 mV dec(-1) with respect to pure CNTs (4520 mV, 166 mV dec(-1)), even on a par with the benchmark RuO2 (360 mV, 137 mV dec(-1)) in 0.1 M KOH.									67	3	0	0	5	0	67			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000498608300001

Size of the Au NPs was well-distributed around 7 nm, and the TiO2 NTAs were found vertically aligned. Due to LSPR effect and Schottky contact, the as-prepared Au NPs@TiO2 NTAs heterostructured films exhibited improved H-2 generation abilities as well as photocatalytic degradation abilities. H-2 evolution rate of the obtained samples (effective area: 5.25 cm(2)) reached 74.56 mu mol/h, which was 38 times higher than that of the raw TiO2 NTAs. And the Au NPs@TiO2 NTAs samples also showed an obvious advantage over the raw TiO2 NTAs, in methyl orange degradation under UV illumination. Repetition experiments were further carried out to ensure the dip-loading method was a reliable fabrication process, and the amount of Au particles attached on TiO2 tube walls could be manipulated by changing the dip-loading cycle times.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000478649200016

Here we performed a detailed characterization of UV-A-induced damage in photosystem II membrane particles using EPR spectroscopy and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements. UV-A irradiation results in the rapid inhibition of oxygen evolution accompanied by the loss of the multiline EPR signal from the S-2. state of the water-oxidizing complex. Gradual decrease of EPR signals arising from the Q(A)(-)Fe(2+) acceptor complex, Tyr-Ddegrees, and the ferricyanide-induced oxidation of the non-heme Fe2+ to Fe3+ is also observed, but at a significantly slower rate than the inhibition of oxygen evolution and of the multiline signal. The amplitude of Signal IIfast, arising from Tyr-Zdegrees in the absence of fast electron donation from the Mn cluster, was gradually increased during the course of UV-A treatment. However, the amount of functional Tyr-Z decreased to a similar extent as Tyr-D as shown by the loss of amplitude of Signal IIfast that could be measured in the UV-A-treated particles after Tris washing. UV-A irradiation also affects the relaxation of flash-induced variable chlorophyll fluorescence. The amplitudes of the fast (600 mus) and slow (2 s) decaying components, assigned to reoxidation Of Q(A)(-) by Q(B) and by recombination Of (Q(A)Q(B))(-) with donor side components, respectively, decrease in favor of the 15-20 ms component, which reflects PQ binding to the Q(B) site. In the presence of DCMU, the fluorescence relaxation is dominated by a I s component due to recombination Of Q(A)(-) with the S-2 state. After UV-A radiation, this is partially replaced by a much faster component (30-70 ms) arising from recombination Of Q(A)(-) with a stabilized intermediate PSII donor, most likely Tyr-Zdegrees. It is concluded that the primary damage site of UV-A irradiation is the catalytic manganese cluster of the water-oxidizing complex, where electron transfer to Tyr-Zdegrees and P-680(+) becomes inhibited. Modification and/or inactivation of the redox-active tyrosines and the Q(A)Fe(2+) acceptor complex are subsequent events. This damaging mechanism is very similar to that induced by the shorter wavelength UV-B (280-320) radiation, but different from that induced by the longer wavelength photosynthetically active light (400-700 nm).									76	4	0	0	67	0	80			0006-2960			WOS:000177337600003	12162734

However, electrocatalytic NRR process under ambient conditions often suffers from low Faradaic efficiency and high overpotential. Developing newly regulative methods for highly efficient NRR electrocatalysts is of great significance for NH3 synthesis. Here, we propose an interfacial engineering strategy for designing a class of strongly coupled hybrid materials as highly active electrocatalysts for catalytic N-2 fixation. X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) spectra confirm the successful construction of strong bridging bonds (Co-N/S-C) at the interface between CoSx nanoparticles and NS-G (nitrogen- and sulfur-doped reduced graphene). These bridging bonds can accelerate the reaction kinetics by acting as an electron transport channel, enabling electrocatalytic NRR at a low overpotential. As expected, CoS2/NS-G hybrids show superior NRR activity with a high NH3 Faradaic efficiency of 25.9% at -0.05 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Moreover, this strategy is general and can be extended to a series of other strongly coupled metal sulfide hybrids. This work provides an approach to design advanced materials for ammonia production.									166	18	0	0	10	0	170			0027-8424			WOS:000463069900026	30872473

Herein, single-atomic Pd sites supported by ordered porous N,Sdoped carbon are synthesized, exhibiting remarkable alkaline HOR performance. This catalyst exhibits an ultrahigh anodic current density and mass-specific kinetic current of 2.01 mA cm(-2) and 27,719 A g(Pd) (-1) (at an overpotential of 50 mV), respectively, not only outperforming the Pt/C counterpart but also making it among the best reported HOR catalysts. Furthermore, this catalyst exhibits a negligible activity decay during long-term electrolysis and a good CO tolerance capability. Experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that the synergistic effect from single Pd sites and heteroatom doping (N and S) weakens the binding energy of Had intermediates, thereby accounting for its superior HOR activity. This study provides a guideline for developing single-atomic site catalysts for highly efficient, stable alkaline HOR.									20	0	0	0	2	0	20			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000820189200001

From the Cu K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) results presented hen, it becomes clear that the fluorination process leads to hole doping of the CuO2 layer as well as to structural modification from the square planar CuO4 cluster of Sr2CuO3 to the octahedral CuO4F2 one of Sr2CuO2F2+x. In addition, the comparative extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analyses for Sr2CuO2F2+x and the reference La2CuO4 reveal that the apical copper-ligand bond has a larger bond distance and a greater structural disorder in the former than in the latter, Based on these findings, it can be concluded that fluorine is preferentially incorporated into the apical site of CuO4F2 octahedra in Sr2CuO2F2+x. We suggest that this work can provide an excellent basis for the application of XAS to investigate the electronic and crystal structures of copper oxyhalides.

Yet, the current processes are not without problems such as inevitable side reactions and the high cost of production. This work reports the photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of chloride ions to free chlorine as it has been investigated by using titanium dioxide (TiO2) and several metal-doped titanium dioxide (M-TiO2) material electrodes. An average concentration of 800 mg L-1 of free chlorine was obtained in an open-air reactor using a TiO2 thin-film electrode biased at +1.0 V (SCE) and illuminated by UV light. The M-doped electrodes have performed poorly compared with the pure TiO2 counterpart. Test solutions containing 0.05 mol L-1 NaCl pH 2.0-4.0 were found to be the best conditions for fast production of free chlorine. A complete investigation of all parameters that influence the global process of chlorine production by the photoelectrocatalytic method such as applied potential, concentration of NaCl, pH solution, and time is presented in detail. In addition, photocurrent vs potential curves and the reaction order are also discussed.									62	2	0	0	20	1	66			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000221815200044	15224756

Here, we perform CO2 reduction experiments on Gold at neutral to acidic pH values to elucidate the long-standing controversy surrounding the rate-limiting step. We find the CO production rate to be invariant with pH on a Standard Hydrogen Electrode scale and conclude that it is limited by the CO2 adsorption step. We present a new multi-scale modeling scheme that integrates ab initio reaction kinetics with mass transport simulations, explicitly considering the charged electric double layer. The model reproduces the experimental CO polarization curve and reveals the rate-limiting step to be *COOH to *CO at low overpotentials, CO2 adsorption at intermediate ones, and CO2 mass transport at high overpotentials. Finally, we show the Tafel slope to arise from the electrostatic interaction between the dipole of *CO2 and the interfacial field. This work highlights the importance of surface charging for electrochemical kinetics and mass transport.									107	6	0	0	12	0	107			2041-1723			WOS:000511958300001	31911585

The MBR was operated in three experimental stages with different concentrations of volatile suspended solids (VSS) and temperature, and under both aeration conditions. alpha-Glucosidases, proteases, esterases and phosphatases were tested as markers of organic matter removal in the sludge, and the diversity of the bacterial community was analysed by fingerprinting (temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis of partially-amplified 16S-rRNA genes). Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that temperature and VSS concentration were the only factors that significantly influenced the levels of enzyme activities and the values of both the Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H') and the functional organisation index (Fo), while the bacterial community structure experienced significant changes depending on the aeration source supplied in each experimental stage.

TiO2 was deposited on the Si n(++)p(++)nn(++) photoelectrode to widen the spectral selectivity from UV to visible light. The alternative Pt-free counter photoelectrodes were manufactured with a slightly different structure, where Au or Ag clusters were deposited on the n(++) layer of the Si n(++)pp(++) junction. The photocurrent of the Si n(++)p(++)nn(++) photoelectrode and the TiO2/Si HPE was measured using the Pt electrode or the Pt-free counter photoelectrodes. The analysis was carried out in the dark and under low-intensity UV light irradiation. The TiO2/Si HPE with the Pt-free counter photoelectrode (Ag clusters/Si n(++)p(++)nn(++) junction) showed an increase of up to 74.2% in photocurrent compared with the Pt counter electrode. A deep-insight analysis for the new and simple design of the promising TiO2/Si HPE and the Pt-free counter photoelectrodes for hydrogen evolution from water was carried out.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2162-8769	2162-8777		WOS:000712053000001

A hybrid composite of p-type p-ZnIn2S4/rGO/n-g-C3N4, and GO was formed at 80 degrees C by a simple hydrothermal method. When installed in a dark self-biased fuel cell with cathodic Pt nanocatalysts, the anodic p-ZnIn2S4/rGO/n-g-C3N4 (83%) achieved higher triclosan (TCS) pollutant removal rate than anodic ZnIn2S4/g-C3N4 (52.3%), ZnIn2S4 (35%), and g-C3N4 (18%) after 30 min. Moreover, the p-ZnIn2S4/rGO/n-g-C3N4 not only extended the photo-response range but also accelerated the electron transfer and electron-hole separation in the absence of light or any external energy input. By comparing the different conditions in the fuel cell system, the dark condition was still comparable to the visible light and ultraviolet irradiation during the final monitoring time. scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscope (TEM) were applied to characterize the morphology, composition, and structure of ZnIn2S4/g-C3N4, ZnIn2S4, and g-C3N4. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species were formed via aeration and activation of molecular oxygen through interfacial electron transfer, and active species were detected via electron spin resonance spectrometer (ESR). Finally, TCS degradation mechanisms in the self-biased fuel cell were proposed.									14	2	0	0	0	0	14			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000528340500126		
J	Ugwuanyi, JO; Harvey, LM; McNeil, B								Effect of digestion temperature and pH on treatment efficiency and evolution of volatile fatty acids during thermophilic aerobic digestion of model high strength agricultural waste								BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY				96	6			707	719		10.1016/j.biortech.2004.06.027				APR 2005	2005	Thermophilic aerobic digestion (TAD) of a model agricultural waste, potato peel slurry, a( soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD) load equivalent to approximately 8.0 gl(-1), was carried out under batch conditions at 0.5 vvm aeration rate. Digestions were carried out at temperatures of 45, 50, 55, 60 and 65 degreesC (or left unregulated) without pH control to study the effect of digestion iemperatures on TAD. The effects of digestion pH on the process were studied at pH 6.0. 7.0. 8.0. 9.0 and 9-5 (and in unregulated control) all at 55 degreesC. Except for digestion at 65 degreesC, which was inoculated extraneously using culture of Bacillus strearothermophilus all reactions were carried out using the populations indigenous to the waste. During digestion at different temperatures. the removal of soluble COD increased with temperature to reach a peak at 60 degreesC before declining slightly. removal of soluble solid (SS) followed similar pattern and reached peak at 65 degreesC being the highest temperature studied. while the degradation of TSS and TS (TSS divided by TS) decreased with an increase in temperature. Digestion at pH 7.0 was more efficient than at other pH values. Acetate was the predominant volatile fatty acid (VFA) in all the reactions and accounted for up to 90% of the total. Digestion at 60 degreesC led to the greatest accumulation of acetate, and this coincided with the period of highest oxygen uptake, and rapid consumption of soluble carbohy Iso-valerate was also produced at all pH values. Digestion at 55 degreesC and also at pH 7.0 led to rapid and efficient processesuith least accumulation of VFA and should be of interest in full-scale processes whenever it is practicable to regulate the digestion pH and temperature. The result of digestion at unregulated pH indicates that gradual adaptation may be used to achieve efficient treatment at elevated pH values. This would be of interest in full-scale processes where it is not practicable to tightly regulate digestion pH, and where the waste is produced at a pH value much higher than neutral.

Herein, we report that surface modification of WO3 with a disordered layer enables the photochemical hydrogen production from water. A simple room temperature solution process with lithium-ethylenediamine (Li-EDA) alters the surface of WO3 with localized defects that form a thin disordered layer. Both structural and optical characterization reveal that such a disordered layer induces an upshift in the Fermi level and the elevation of the conduction band of WO3 above the hydrogen reduction potential. Using an alkaline sacrificial agent, Li-EDA treated WO3 shows a co-catalyst-free photochemical hydrogen evolution rate of 94.2 mol g(-1) h(-1) under simulated sunlight. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of using WO3 as a direct photocatalyst for hydrogen generation from water via simple surface defect engineering.									35	4	0	0	3	0	35			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000454251000014

The morphology of W18O49 nanocrystals was significantly changed from urchin sphere to nanowire bundles with the increase of C3N4 quantity. The W18O49-g-C3N4 composites enhance the ability of harvesting visible light, and promote the charge transfer across the composite interface. All the as-prepared composites show higher photocatalytic activity of hydrogen production than that of pure W18O49 and g-C3N4. And the WCN50 composite with 50 mg of g-C3N4 displays the optimal photocatalytic activity with the highest hydrogen production rate of 1.700 mmol g(-1) h(-1) under visible light-irradiation. The improved photocatalytic activity is due to the stronger light harvesting ability, the Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism to promote the interface charge transfer, and the prolonged lifetime of photogenerated electrons. Our work will provide a valuable reference for the design of highly efficient Zscheme photocatalysts for efficiently converting solar energy into chemical fuels. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				713	1			374	382		10.1088/0004-637X/713/1/374				APR 10 2010	2010	We demonstrate that the amount of extra mixing required to fit the observed low C/N and C-12/C-13 ratios in first giant branch (FGB) stars is also sufficient to explain the carbon and nitrogen abundances of Galactic asymptotic/second giant branch (AGB) stars. We simulate the effect of extra mixing on the FGB by setting the composition of the envelope to that observed in low-mass (M <= 2 M-circle dot) FGB stars, and then evolve the models to the tip of the AGB. The inclusion of FGB extra mixing compositional changes has a strong effect on the C and N abundance in our AGB models, leading to compositions consistent with those measured in Galactic carbon-rich stars. The composition of the models is also consistent with C and N abundances measured in mainstream silicon carbide grains. While our models cover the range of C abundances measured in carbon stars in the LMC cluster NGC 1846, we cannot simultaneously match the composition of the O- and C-rich stars at the same time. A second important result is that our models only match the oxygen isotopic composition of K and some M, MS giants, and are not able to match the oxygen composition of carbon-rich AGB stars. By increasing the abundance of O-16 in the intershell (based on observational evidence) it is possible to reproduce the observed trend of increasing O-16/O-18 and O-16/O-17 ratios with evolutionary phase. We also find that some Li production takes place during the AGB and that Li-rich carbon stars (log epsilon(Li) greater than or similar to 1) can be produced. These models show a correlation between increasing Li abundances and C. The models cannot explain the composition of the most Li-enriched carbon stars, nor can we produce a Li-rich carbon star if we assume extra mixing occurs during the FGB owing to He-3 destruction. We tentatively conclude that (1) if extra mixing occurs during the AGB it likely only occurs efficiently in low metallicity objects, or when the stars are heavily obscured making spectroscopic observations difficult and (2) the intershell compositions of AGB stars need further investigation.									70	0	0	0	0	1	70			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000275918500031

The gas's modest aqueous solubility (<2 mM at 1 atm) presents a technical challenge to this approach, because it limits the rate of formation and extent of accumulation of intermediates. This challenge can be overcome by use of the heme enzyme chlorite dismutase (Cld) for the rapid, in situ generation of O-2 at concentrations far exceeding 2 mM. This method was used to define the O-2 concentration dependence of the reaction of the class Ic ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) from Chlamydia trachomatis, in which the enzyme's Mn-IV/Fe-III cofactor forms from a Mn-II/Fe-II complex and O-2 via a Mn-IV/Fe-IV intermediate, at effective O-2 concentrations as high as similar to 10 mM. With a more soluble receptor, myoglobin, an O-2 adduct accumulated to a concentration of >6 mM in <15 ms. Finally, the C-H-bond-cleaving Fe-IV-oxo complex, J, in taurine:a-ketoglutarate dioxygenase and superoxo-Fe-2(III/III) complex, G, in myo-inositol oxygenase, and the tyrosyl-radical-generating Fe-2(III/IV) intermediate, X, in Escherichia coli RNR, were all accumulated to yields more than twice those previously attained. This means of in situ O-2 evolution permits a >5 mM "pulse" of O-2 to be generated in <1 ms at the easily accessible Cld concentration of 50 mu M. It should therefore significantly extend the range of kinetic and spectroscopic experiments that can routinely be undertaken in the study of these enzymes and could also facilitate resolution of mechanistic pathways in cases of either sluggish or thermodynamically unfavorable O-2 addition steps.									28	0	0	0	22	0	29			0006-2960			WOS:000300757100007	22304240

Rietveld refinement of x-ray diffraction data was done to obtain the subtle structural information. A tetragonal structure of P4mm type was revealed for Bi0.8Ba0.2FeO3 (x= 0) ceramic. Evolution of rhombohedral (R3c) phase was observed with Mo6+ doping and a complete transformation to R3c phase from P4mm was found for 15 wt% Mo6+ doping. This type of transformation causes distortion in the structure and results in changing bond angle. Magnetization was found to be improved with increasing the percentage of Mo6+ up to 10 wt%. Canting of spin due to the change in Fe-O-Fe bond angle is believed to be the main reason behind this improvement. One secondary phase BaMoO4 was found and becomes prominent with Mo6+ doping. Possible formation of this impurity and its correlation with properties are explained. Microstructural analysis was done to observe the Ba2+ and Mo6+ co-doping effect on grain size and distribution. A correlation of grain size with electric and magnetic properties is drawn and elucidated. Dielectric constant shows an increasing trend with Mo6+ doping. Reduction in oxygen vacancy, due to charge compensation upon high charged Mo6+ addition, believed to be the staple reason behind the dielectric constant increment. Lastly, optical band gap energy found to be decreased with the addition of Mo6+ and possible reasons behind this are evaluated. Overall, co-doping of Ba2+ and Mo6+ found to have a positive influence over materials electrical, optical as well as magnetic property.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14				2053-1591		WOS:000520117100001

Here, we report on the synthesis of a highly effective and stable oxygen- and nitrogen-linked heptazine-based carbon nitride organic polymer (OCN) photocatalyst that is metal-free and porous, with low crystallinity and nitrogen vacancies, which is prepared through a single-step approach. For the photocatalytic degradation of several typical PPCPs, the OCN exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance compared to C3N4. The enhanced mechanisms were investigated novelty, and the conduction band, crystallinity and recombination rate of photogenerated carriers were reduced due to the introduction of oxygen atoms and nitrogen vacancies, whereas the fabrication of porous structures provided additional adsorption sites. The mechanism of hydroxyl radical generation in the OCN system was first proposed under this system. The O linkages can form hydrogen bonds with H2O2 to promote the catalytic generation of hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH). The presence of OH, center dot O-2(-) and O-1(2) (detected by ESR) indicated that the OCN polymer could be employed to degrade organic pollutants.									45	0	0	0	24	0	45			2051-8153	2051-8161		WOS:000448409200010

The presence of the La3+ doping process modifies the size and morphology of the In2O3 nanostructures and also stabilizes the rhombohedral (rh) In2O3 phase with respect to the most stable cubic (bcc) polymorph. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and Rietveld refinements, Raman, UV-vis, and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopies, transmission electron (TEM) and field-emission scanning electron (FE-SEM) microscopies, as well as PL emissions have been performed. To complement and rationalize the experimental results, first-principle calculations, based on density functional theory, are carried out to obtain the formation energies of the In2O3 and bcc- and rh-In2O3-doped phases, their geometry and electronic properties. Theoretical results are able to explain the relative stabilization of the rh-phase with respect to the bcc-phase based on the analysis geometry changes and the electronic redistribution induced by the La3+ doping process. In addition, Wulff construction is employed to match the theoretical and experimental morphologies of the cubic phase. The synthesized samples were applied for the O-2 evolution reaction (OER). The La3+-doped In2O3 film presents superior electrocatalytic activity, with an onset potential lower than the undoped In2O3 film that can be associated with the increase in electron density caused by the La3+ doping process. This study provides a versatile strategy for obtaining In2O3 and La3+-doped In2O3 nanostructures for practical applications.									13	0	0	0	0	1	13			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000484066500050	31415162

These temporal and spatial variations have caused a range of ore deposit mineral assemblages. Consequently, understanding their conditions of formation is still in its infancy. This research reports rare earth elements (REE) and trace elements of fluorite associated with hexavalent uranium mineralizations and tests of genetic models for the deposits. These data contribute to a better understanding of the variables controlling fluorite formation and uranium ore composition through understanding the evolution of these ore-forming hydrothermal systems. Fluorite in Gabal Gattar granite occurs as disseminations and/or thin veinlets and encrustations filling some uranium mineralized fissures and fractures along the northern margin of host granite mass. In the U-poor samples, fluorite forms well-developed large crystals that are commonly zoned. The zones are represented by alternating colorless and violet zones, and the outer zones are frequently dark violet. In the U-rich samples, fluorite is usually anhedral, unzoned, and has a dark violet color. The results of analysis of REE and trace element contents of fluorites using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry indicate that total REE in the anhedral unzoned fluorite are elevated compared to the well developed zoned fluorite, and also total REE in dark violet zones of zoned fluorite are elevated with respect to the colorless zones. The fluorites and host granite are generally characterized by strongly negative Eu anomalies and slightly negative or chondritic Ce anomalies. Accordingly, REE patterns of the fluorite and host granite are roughly alike, indicating that the source of REE and trace elements of hydrothermal fluids is the host granite leached by fluids. Y/Y*, Ce/Ce,* and Eu/Eu* patterns show that fluorite clearly records the compositional evolution of the hydrothermal solutions that have transferred trace and REE from host granite during the fluid-wall rocks interactions. The high uranium contents of fluorite in Gabal Gattar granite suggest that parent fluids bearing fluorine have interacted with host granite to leach uranium from the accessory minerals of granite and tetravalent uranium minerals in reduced or weakly oxidized zones.									8	4	0	0	0	0	12			1866-7511	1866-7538		WOS:000338217500005

Compared to the traditional modified manners for carbonmetal composites, introducing bonds would render the great evolution of their electrochemical properties, mainly resulting from the increased active sites, quick electrons transfer and so on. In this review, the recent process of bonds was detailed summarized in relative areas. Meanwhile, the bonds could be divided into M - C and M-X-C (M presents metal elements; C is about carbon materials; X = O, S, N etc.), and their relative physical-chemical traits with validation means have been concluded. Moreover, despite the merits above, for battery systems, the bonds were deemed as the roles of enhancing structural stability and interfacial ions-storage capability. Alternatively, for PC and PEC systems, chemical bonds could speed up the interfacial charge transfer and hinder the recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes, whilst for EC system, they would serve as highly active electrocatalytic center, providing more stable interfacial structure. Finally, the review was anticipated to offer systematic and in-depth comprehension for interfacial bonds, whilst guiding the further exploring of the interface about advanced composites.									27	2	0	0	0	0	27			2405-8297			WOS:000586658000020

Unraveling the Roles of the Acid Medium, Experimental Probes, and Terminal Oxidant, (NH4)(2)[Ce(NO3)(6)], in the Study of a Homogeneous Water Oxidation Catalyst								INORGANIC CHEMISTRY				50	8			3662	3672		10.1021/ic2000188				APR 18 2011	2011	The oxidation of water catalyzed by [Ru(tpy)(bpy)(OH2)](ClO4)(2) (1; tpy = 2,2';6 '',2 ''-terpyridine; bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine) is evaluated in different acidic media at variable oxidant concentrations. The observed rate of dioxygen evolution catalyzed by 1 is found to be highly dependent on pH and the identity of the acid; e.g., d[O-2]/dt is progressively faster in H2SO4, CF3SO3H (HOTf), HClO4, and HNO3, respectively. This trend does not track with thermodynamic driving force of the electron-transfer reactions between the terminal oxidant, (NH4)(2)[Ce(NO3)(6)] (CAN), and Ru catalyst in each of the acids. The particularly high reactivity in HNO3 is attributed to the NO3- anion: (i) enabling relatively fast electron-transfer steps; (ii) participating in a base-assisted concerted atom-proton transfer process that circumvents the formation of high energy intermediates during the O-O bond formation process; and (iii) accelerating the liberation of dioxygen from the catalyst. Consequently, the position of the rate-determining step within the catalytic cycle can be affected by the acid medium. These factors collectively contribute to the position of the rate-determining step within the catalytic cycle being affected by the acid medium. This offering also outlines how other experimental issues (e.g., spontaneous decay of the Ce(IV) species in acidic media; CAN/catalyst molar ratio; types of catalytic probes) can affect the Ce(IV)-driven oxidation of water catalyzed by homogeneous molecular complexes.									97	2	0	0	8	0	97			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000290457700058	21413748

Here, the authors critically review and discuss recent developments on low- and non-platinum-based cathode catalysts and catalyst layers.Proton exchange membrane fuel cells have been recently developed at an increasing pace as clean energy conversion devices for stationary and transport sector applications. High platinum cathode loadings contribute significantly to costs. This is why improved catalyst and support materials as well as catalyst layer design are critically needed. Recent advances in nanotechnologies and material sciences have led to the discoveries of several highly promising families of materials. These include platinum-based alloys with shape-selected nanostructures, platinum-group-metal-free catalysts such as metal-nitrogen-doped carbon materials and modification of the carbon support to control surface properties and ionomer/catalyst interactions. Furthermore, the development of advanced characterization techniques allows a deeper understanding of the catalyst evolution under different conditions. This review focuses on all these recent developments and it closes with a discussion of future research directions in the field.									16	1	0	0	1	0	16				2041-1723		WOS:000707028100024	34645781

Herein, we report a facile and general strategy for the synthesis of TMP/g-C3N4 hybrid photocatalysts with high H-2 production performance under visible light irradiation. Among the as-prepared TMP/g-C3N4 hybrids, the CoP/g-C3N4 sample with an optimum mass content of 2.5 wt% delivers the highest photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate of 956.8 mol g(-1) h(-1). DFT calculations and experimental results reveal that the superior catalytic activity could be predominantly attributed to the larger number of active sites and the enhanced photo-excited charge transfer dynamics benefitting from the synergistic effect of the ultrasmall particle size and the intimate contact interface between g-C3N4 and CoP. We anticipate that the protocol would provide a promising strategy for designing TMP co-catalyst based hybrid nanostructures aiming to optimize photocatalytic hydrogen generation efficiency.									43	1	0	0	8	0	43			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463814800033

The model accounts for relaxation of residual stresses in a crystalline oxide overgrowth by plastic deformation (i.e., through the introduction of misfit dislocations at the metal/oxide interface). As an example, the microstructural evolution of the initial oxide film grown on the {111}, {110}, and {100} crystallographic surfaces of a bare Cr substrate has been modeled as a function of the growth temperature and the oxide-film thickness (< 5 nm). The initial oxide-film growth on the bare Cr{100} and Cr{111} substrates is predicted to proceed by the initial formation and growth of an amorphous oxide film up to a critical thickness of about 0.5 and 0.9 nm, respectively. On the other hand, the onset of oxidation on a bare Cr{110} substrate should proceed by the direct overgrowth of a semicoherent, strained crystalline oxide film. These model predictions provide understanding for experimental observations reported in the literature.									38	0	0	0	1	0	38			1098-0121			WOS:000241723400023

Herein, ZnIn2S4 hierarchical architectures assembled as ultrathin nanosheets were synthesized by a facile one-pot polyol approach. Subsequently, the two-dimensional-network-like MoSe2 was successfully hybridized with ZnIn2S4 by taking advantage of their analogous intrinsic layered morphologies. The noble-metal-free ZnIn2S4/MoSe2 heterostructures show enhanced photocatalytic H-2 evolution compared to pure ZnIn2S4. It is noteworthy that the optimum nanocomposite of ZnIn2S4/2% MoSe2 photocatalyst displays a high H-2 generation rate of 2228 mu molg(-1)h(-1) and an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 21.39% at 420 nm. This study presents an unprecedented ZnIn2S4/MoSe2 metal-sulfide-metal-selenide hybrid system for H-2 evolution. Importantly, the present efficient hybridization strategy reveals the potential of hierarchical nanoarchitectures for a multitude of energy storage and solar energy conversion applications.									105	6	0	0	8	0	106			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000416158500040	28834335

Here, nanostructured amorphous MoS2 with highly efficient electrocatalyfic performance was designed and prepared for hydrogen production using glancing angle deposition (GLAD) magnetron sputtering (MS). A special tree-like MoS2 was obtained under a glancing angle of 5 degrees as demonstrated by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. This tree-like nanostructure MoS 2 exhibited excellent HER activity with a low over potential of 280 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 63 mV dec(-1). Further, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) investigations revealed the different chemical states of sulfur element. The enhancement of HER performance is attributed to the unsaturated sulfur edges and the increased surface contact area. The results obtained from this study are expected to facilitate the large scale fabrication of sulfide catalysts for HER.									7	1	0	0	0	0	8			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000525421400002

Nickel sulfide, particularly known for its ability to electrochemically reduce protons to hydrogen gas nearly as efficiently as expensive noble metals, can be challenging to produce with certain surface site compositions or morphologies, e.g., conformal thin films. To this end, we employed atomic layer deposition (ALD), a preeminent method to fabricate uniform and conformal films, to construct thin films of nickel sulfide (NiSx) using bis(N,N'-di-tert-butylacetamidinato)nickel(II) (Ni(amd)(2)) vapor and hydrogen sulfide gas. Effects of experimental conditions such as pulse and purge times and temperature on the growth of NiSx were investigated. These revealed a wide temperature range, 125-225 degrees C, over which self-limiting NiSx growth can be observed. In situ quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) studies revealed conventional linear growth behavior for NiSx films, with a growth rate of 9.3 ng/cm(2) per cycle being obtained. The ALD-synthesized films were characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) methods. To assess the electrocatalyitic activity of NiSx for evolution of molecular hydrogen, films were grown on conductive-glass supports. Overpotentials at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) were recorded in both acidic and pH 7 phosphate buffer aqueous reaction media and found to be 440 and 576 mV, respectively, with very low NiSx loading. These results hint at the promise of ALD-grown NiSx materials as water-compatible electrocatalysts.									34	1	0	0	0	0	35			0743-7463			WOS:000388914400002	27933878

Herein a series of silsesquioxane (POSS) stabilized platinum-palladium (PtPd) alloy nanoparticles (NPs) with morphology evolution were facilely synthesized with the co-chemical reduction using formaldehyde as the reductant. By varying the ratio of Pt to Pd, the PtPd alloy NPs evolved from truncated octahedrons to octahedrons, and triangular nanoplates. The mechanism of morphology evolution is that Pt and Pd could self-assemble on POSS to form PtxPd1-x intermediates with different Pt/Pd ratios. In addition, formaldehyde could selectively bind to the {1 1 1} facets of Pd to control the growth rates of different facets and help PtxPd1-x intermediates with different Pt/Pd ratio grow into different morphology of PtxPd1-x alloys. The morphology tuning endowed the PtPd alloy NPs superior performance for formic acid electrooxidation. Compared with Pt, Pd NPs, and commercial Pt/C catalyst, the PtPd alloy NPs displayed larger electrochemically active surface area, enhanced electrocatalytic activity and durability toward oxidation of formic acid, and increased CO tolerance. This work suggested that modification of catalytic activity through morphology tuning with composition adjustment might provide some new pathways for the design of promising catalysts with advanced performance.

Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting presents that the isolated Fe is coordinated with 4.4 N atoms on average, corresponding to the coexistence of Fe-N-4 (60%) and Fe-N-5 (40%). The SA-Fe-NC electrochemical catalyst presents high ORR activity (E-onset/E-1/2 = 1.04/0.88 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and J(L) = 5.62 mA cm(-2)), superhigh durability (no obvious loss after 30 000 cycles), and absolute tolerance to methanol in alkaline media. The SA-Fe-NC-based primary Zn-air battery (ZAB) shows a high specific capacity of 806 mAh g(Zn)(-1), a high energy density of 1048 Wh kg(Zn)(-1), and a high power density of 164 mW cm(-2) due to the high electrocatalytic activity of SA-Fe-NC. The ZAB shows a superlong lifetime of 320 h at 10 mA cm(-2) resulting from the superhigh stability of the SA-Fe-NC catalyst.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000679392400007		
J	Liu, Zichen; Zhang, Gong; Zhang, Kai; Lan, Huachun; Liu, Huijuan; Qu, Jiuhui								Low electronegativity Mn bulk doping intensifies charge storage of Ni2P redox shuttle for membrane-free water electrolysis								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				8	7			4073	4082		10.1039/c9ta10213b				FEB 21 2020	2020	A high efficiency electrochemical energy storage and high areal capacitance solid-state mediator can act as an energy vector to solve the key problem in mixtures of H-2 and O-2 in electrically driven water splitting architectures. It is believed that introducing foreign metal atoms into a monometallic compound could promote the energy storage capacity of the mediator. Herein, based on the theoretical prediction that partial substitution of low electronegativity Mn in the Ni2P structure could enhance the local charge density around Ni and lower the rate-determining Gibbs free energy difference (Delta G(OOH)-Delta G(O)) compared to Fe substitution or the pure compound, a supercapacitor-type transition metal phosphide (TMP) mediator Ni-Mn-P with an areal capacitance of 12.25 F cm(-1) is fabricated. Benefitting from the enhanced energy storage activity and high exposure of active sites, the charge storage in the H-2 generation step in a 1 cm(2) Ni-Mn-P mediator electrode when coupled with Ni2P/NF bifunctional electrodes maintains >500 s O-2 evolution (10 mA), similar to 4 times longer than that of an unsubstituted Ni-P mediator. In addition, the superior stability for >20 000 s cycle operation at 20 mA further demonstrates its operational flexibility and potential for practical application.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000521346600054

However, it is still difficult to build cost-efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution systems based on 2D materials. Herein, an in situ growth method is employed to build 2D/2D heterojunctions, with which 2D Ni-based metal-organic layers (Ni-MOLs) are closely grown on 2D porous CdS (P-CdS) nanosheets, affording traditional P-CdS/Ni-MOL heterojunction materials. Impressively, the optimized P-CdS/Ni-MOL catalyst exhibits superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance, with an H-2 yield of 29.81 mmol g(-1) h(-1). This value is 7 and 2981 times higher than that of P-CdS and Ni-MOLs, respectively, and comparable to those of reported state of the art catalysts. Photocatalytic mechanism studies reveal that the enhanced photocatalytic performance can be attributed to the 2D/2D intimate interface between P-CdS and Ni-MOLs, which facilitates the fast charge carriers' separation and transfer. This work provides a strategy to develop 2D MOL-based photocatalysts for sustainable energy conversion.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000789577200001	35451165

In this work, a series of Co-C3N4 photocatalysts with different Co contents atomically dispersed on g-C3N4 have been prepared via one-step thermal treatment of cobalt-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and urea in the air. Thanks to the highly dispersed and rich exposed Co sites, as well as good charge separation efficiency and abundant mesopores, the optimal 25-Co-C3N4, in the absence of noble metal catalysts/sensitizers, exhibits excellent performance for photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO under visible light irradiation, with a high CO evolution rate of 394.4 mu mol.g(-1).h(-1), over 80 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4 (4.9 mu mol.g(-1).h(-1)). In addition, by this facile synthesis strategy, the atomically dispersed Fe and Mn anchoring on g-C3N4 (Fe-C3N4 and Mn-C3N4) have been also obtained, indicating the reliability and universality of this strategy in synthesizing photocatalysts with highly dispersed metal centers. This work paves a new way to develop cost-effective photocatalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reduction.									23	0	0	0	1	0	22			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000650105800003

Ag incorporation in TiO2 ranged 1, 3, 5 and 7% at. XRD, SEM and TEM analyses of samples confirmed the dominant evolution of tenorite CuO and anatase TiO2. Average crystallite size was 36, 22 and 33-42 nm for pristine CuO, pristine TiO2 and core/shell samples, respectively. EDX and XPS analyses indicated composition and oxidation states of elements and the existence of Ag in metallic state. Exhibiting absorption in the visible range, diffuse reflectance UV-Visible absorption spectra of core/shell samples resembled closely to that of pristine CuO. Compared to pristine samples, core/shell samples yielded significant gain in hydrogen generation. Sample with 1% Ag-incorporated TiO2 shell recorded most efficient hydrogen generation with yield as high as 180 and 13 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) in laboratory and field conditions, respectively. Plausible reasons for the observed gain in performance are given. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									21	2	0	0	1	0	22			0960-1481	1879-0682		WOS:000460847800104

However, it is still necessary to improve the lower conductivity and limited active sites of LDHs to enhance their catalytic performance. Targeted generation of vacancies on the catalyst's surface by the incorporation of metal nanoparticles has been explored as a promising strategy to synthesize highly efficient electrocatalysts. Herein, we designed and prepared novel three-dimensional (3D) hetero-electrocatalysts of NiCo-layered double hydroxide nanosheets incorporated with silver nanoclusters on a Ni foam (labeled as Ag@NiCo-LDH/NF) by a one-pot hydrothermal method. We also conducted experimental and theoretical investigations to demonstrate the high electrocatalytic performance of the Ag@NiCo-LDH/NF hetero-electrocatalysts for OERs and the underlying mechanism. The resulting hetero-electrocatalysts show a low overpotential of 262 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and even exhibit low overpotentials of 300 mV at a high current density of 50 mA cm(-2) and 324 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), and a small Tafel slope of 41 mV dec(-1) as well as excellent durability for 80 h for OERs in 1.0 M KOH. The excellent performance is attributed to the synergistic effects between Ag nanoclusters and LDHs. The population engineering effect of silver not only helps to modulate the intrinsic properties of active sites but also induces the generation of abundant oxygen vacancies on the surface; finally, it facilitates the rate-determining step of OERs (Delta G(3) (O* -> OOH*) = 1.31 eV) to gain high performance. The one-pot silver incorporating strategy and the resulting high performance pave new ways for the further development of highly efficient electrocatalysts for OERs.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000661977400001	34132731

Cation 1(+) is composed of the [Mn4O4](7+) core surrounded by six bidentate phosphinate ligands. The proton-coupled electron transfer (pcet) reactions of phenothiazine (pzH), the cation radical (pzH(.-))(ClO4-), and the neutral pz(.) radical with 1(+) are reported and compared to Mn4O4(O2PPh2)(6) (1). Compound 1(+)(ClO4-) reacts with excess pzH via four sequential reduction steps that transfer a total of five electrons and four protons to 1(+). This reaction forms the doubly dehydrated manganese cluster Mn4O2(O2PPh2)(6) (2) and two water molecules derived from the corner oxygen atoms. The first pcet step forms the novel complex Mn4O3(OH)(O2PPh2)(6) (1H) and 1 equiv of the pz(+) cation by net hydride transfer from pzH. Spectroscopic characterization of isolated 1 H is reported. Reduction of 1 by pzH or a series of para-substituted phenols also produces 1H via net H atom transfer. A lower limit to the homolytic bond dissociation energy (BDE) (1H --> 1 + H) was estimated to be >94 kcal/mol using solution phase BDEs for pzH and para-substituted phenols. The heterolytic BIDE was estimated for the hydride transfer reaction 1H --> 1(+) + H- (BDE similar to 127 kcal/mol). These comparisons reveal the O-H bond in 1H to be among the strongest of any Mn-hydroxo complex measured thus far. In three successive H atom transfer steps, 1H abstracts three hydrogen atoms from three pzH molecules to form complex 2. Complex 2 is shown to be identical to the "pinned butterfly" cluster produced by the reaction of 1 with pzH (Ruettinger, W. F; Dismukes, G. C. Inorg. Chem. 2000, 39, 1021-1027). The Mn oxidation states in 2 are formally Mn-4(2II,2III), and no further reduction occurs in excess pzH. By contrast, outer-sphere electron-only reductants such as cobaltacene reduce both 1(+) and 1 to the all Mn(II) oxidation level and cause cluster fragmentation. The reaction of pzH(.+) with 1(+) produces 1H and the pz(+) cation by net hydrogen atom transfer, and terminates at 1 equiv of pzH(.+) with no further reaction at excess. By contrast, pz(.) does not react with 1(+) at all, indicating that reduction of 1(+) by electron transfer to form pz+ does not occur without a proton (pcet to 1(+) is thermodynamically required). Experimental free energy changes are shown to account for these pcet reactions and the absence of electron transfer for any of the phenothiazine series. Hydrogen atom abstraction from substrates by 1 versus hydride abstraction by 1(+) illustrates the transition to two-electron one-proton pcet chemistry in the [Mn4O4](7+) core that is understood on the basis of free energy consideration. This transition provides a concrete example of the predicted lowest-energy pathway for the oxidation of two water molecules to H2O2 as an intermediate within the photosynthetic water-oxidizing enzyme (vs sequential one-electron/proton steps).The implications for the mechanism of photosynthetic water splitting are discussed.									45	1	1	0	7	0	46			0020-1669			WOS:000182650400010	12716176

However, they still suffer from many challenges such as unsatisfactory practical specific capacity, cycle stability, and relatively high overpotential. The electrochemical performance of Li-O-2 batteries is closely related to the reversibility of the discharge (oxygen reduction reaction, ORR) and charge (oxygen evolution reaction, OER) processes. During the discharge process, non-conductive Li2O2 product is formed and gradually covers on the surface of the positive electrode material, leading to the deactivation of battery. The charging process is accompanied by the electrochemical decomposition of Li2O2 products. Therefore, how to achieve the highly reversible formation and decomposition of the Li2O2 product is the key to improve the electrochemical performance of Li-O-2 batteries. To date, two strategies have been developed: (i) sp(2) carbon materials with large specific surface area, suitable pore structure and high conductivity are used as cathode materials to disperse/accommodate the Li2O2 product and promote the electron transfer, (ii) the soluble redox mediators with ORR/OER bifunctionally catalytic activities are adopted as the electrolyte additive to promote the formation and decomposition of the Li2O2 product and lower the overpotentials. Recently, we reported a novel 3D hierarchical carbon nanocages (hCNC) featuring on the ultrahigh specific surface area, multiscale pore structure (micro-meso-macropore coexistence), high conductivity, and abundant defects, which demonstrated the excellent electrochemical performances in energy conversion and storage. Herein, taking advantages of hCNC, the high performances of Li-O-2 batteries were fabricated, showing high full discharge specific capacity (14080 mAh.g(-1)) and good cyclability. After adding acetylacetone ferrous (Fe(acac)(2)) as the redox mediator to electrolyte, the electrochemical performances are further promoted. Namely, the discharge capacity reaches to 23560 mAh.g(-1) at the current density of 0.1 A.g(-1) (7.82 times of XC-72), and the cycle numbers are up to 138 cycles at the current density of 0.5 A.g(-1) and the discharge/charge depth of 800 mAh.pg(-1) (far higher than 68 cycles of hCNC without Fe(acac)(2) and 13 cycles of XC-72). Especially, at the high current den- sity of 5.0 A.g(-1) , the cycle numbers still reach to 63 cycles, far higher than 21 cycles of hCNC without Fe(acac)(2). Such excellent electrochemical performances can be ascribed to: the unique structure of hCNC facilitating electron transfer, reversible conversion of 2Li(+) +O-2 +2e(-)reversible arrow Li2O2 (s), and dispersion/accommodation of the insulating Li2O2 product; the soluble redox mediator of Fe(acac)(2) effectively catalyzing the discharge products of Li2O2 to form uniformly dispersed small-sized particles and decompose completely during the charge process. This provides a promising strategy for improving the performance of Li-O-2 batteries via designing novel carbon-based positive electrode materials and adding efficient soluble redox mediators.									2	1	0	0	0	0	2			0567-7351			WOS:000558811500013

Herein, a dual protection strategy has been developed to give high-content SACs by nanocasting SiO2 into porphyrinic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The pyrolysis of SiO2@MOF composite affords single-atom Fe implanted N-doped porous carbon (Fe-SA-N-C) with high Fe loading (3.46wt%). The spatial isolation of Fe atoms centered in porphyrin linkers of MOF sets the first protective barrier to inhibit the Fe agglomeration during pyrolysis. The SiO2 in MOF provides additional protection by creating thermally stable FeN4/SiO2 interfaces. Thanks to the high-density Fe-SA sites, Fe-SA-N-C demonstrates excellent oxygen reduction performance in both alkaline and acidic medias. Meanwhile, Fe-SA-N-C also exhibits encouraging performance in proton exchange membrane fuel cell, demonstrating great potential for practical application. More far-reaching, this work grants a general synthetic methodology toward high-content SACs (such as Fe-SA, Co-SA, Ni-SA). Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with high metal loading are highly desired to improve catalytic performance. Here, the authors report a dual protection strategy by nanocasting SiO2 into metal-organic frameworks to prepare high-loading SACs with excellent catalytic performance toward oxygen reduction.									196	12	0	0	16	0	197			2041-1723			WOS:000540523000001	32504040

In this system, it is crucial to develop suitable catalysts capable of receiving dye-injected charges and having high activity to a given reaction. Aiming to photocatalytic H-2 and O-2 production, we present a metal-organic framework derived route to prepare bimetallic Fe-Ni-P nanotubes using Fe-Ni-MIL-88 nanorods as templates. When integrated with different dyes, these Fe-Ni-P nanotubes can serve as efficient catalysts for photocatalytic H-2 and O-2 production, respectively. Additionally, catalytic activities of such dye-sensitized systems can be conveniently regulated by tailoring the metal compositions in Fe-Ni-P nanotubes. The photocatalytic H-2 production of Fe-1-Ni-2-P can reach 5420 mu mol g nat(-1) h(-1) under eosin-Y sensitization, which is 24 times and 6.7 times higher than Fe 2 P and Ni 2 P, respectively. The photocatalytic O-2 production of Fe-1-Ni-2-P can reach 900.3 mu mol g nat(-1) h(-1) under [Ru(bpy)(3)]Cl-2 sensitization, about 4.6 times and 2.9 times higher than Fe2P and Ni2P. The roles of different components in the system have been explored and corresponding working mechanism is proposed. This work demonstrates a new type of dye-sensitized systems consisting of bimetallic phosphides and provides a facile route to regulate their photocatalytic performance.									44	7	0	0	4	0	45			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000504405000094

Here, well-aligned hierarchical Cu7S4/TiO2/CoCr-layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanorod arrays are reported, aiming at accelerating charge separation and transfer kinetics. The modifications of Cu7S4 and CoCr-LDH based on TiO2 have endowed the photoanode a surprising enhancement in both ultraviolet light absorption and charge separation efficiency due to highly matched band alignment. The formation of heterojunction is an effective strategy to prevent photocorrosion of Cu7S4 by attaching protective layers on Cu7S4. Moreover, other than the hierarchical morphology with enlarged active surface areas would provide sufficient active sites for the water oxidation processes and pore channels for the gas escaping, owing to the special band alignment of three components, multiple reaction interfaces are produced and involved in the water splitting process, since the photoinduced holes for water oxidation are simultaneously distributed in CoCr-LDH and Cu7S4. As expected, this synergistic effect in this ternary Cu7S4/TiO2/CoCr-LDH heterogeneous photoanode gives rise to a largely enhanced photoconversion efficiency (0.58% at 0.6 V) and photocurrent density (2.04 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V).									13	1	0	0	2	0	13			2196-7350			WOS:000456673900006

The hydrophobic membrane protein easily escapes staining procedures such as Coomassie R-250 or silver staining, but it is clearly detected by immunodecoration with peptide-directed IgG. This additional subunit was found to be present in PSII reaction centers previously known to contain only the D1/D2/cytb(559) proteins and the psbI gene product. Furthermore, cross-linking experiments using 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl-)3-ethylcarbodiimide showed that the nearest neighbors were the D1 and D2 proteins and the cytb(559). The 6.1-kDa protein was purified by immune affinity chromatography. N-terminal sequence analysis of the isolated protein confirmed the identity of the 6.1-kDa protein and enabled finding of strong similarities with a randomly obtained cDNA from Arabidopsis thaliana. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in combination with thylakoid membrane preparations of different orientation, the N terminus off the protein, predicted to span the membrane once, is suggested to be exposed at the lumen side of the membrane. Consequently the 6.1-kDa protein seems to be the only subunit in the PSII reaction center that is nuclear encoded and has its N terminus on the lumen side of the membrane. These findings open for new interesting suggestions concerning the properties of photosystem II reaction center with respect to the photosynthetic activity, regulation and assembly in higher plants.									47	1	0	0	40	0	49			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:A1995RK68900082	7615565

However, the performance, durability, and efficiency limitations of PEMFCs have hindered their widespread adoption. Improving their performance and durability can be achieved by fundamentally understanding and tuning their catalyst layer structures and compositions. Transmission electron microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy have proven to be among the best characterization tools available to analyze the microstructural features of the catalyst layers of PEMFC devices. The ability to directly observe changes in catalyst materials during operation with high spatial and temporal resolutions by the means of In-situ techniques can accelerate material development in the PEMFC field. In this article, structure, properties, and performance of PEMFC materials are reviewed, and their known degradation mechanisms are introduced. Available In-situ TEM techniques are presented to guide the selection of suitable methods and approaches for studying the PEMFC systems.

Herein, we reported a facile strategy to synthesize the Ru single atoms (Ru SAs) through the dynamic transformation from clusters to single atoms by combining the electrospun technology and NH3-assisted graphitization process. The small Ru nanoclusters (NCs) supported on carbon nanofibers (CNFs) were in situ converted into Ru SAs in N-doped CNFs under the NH3 treatment. Through controlling the NH3 treatment time and graphitization temperatures, the Ru nanocrystals exhibit a dynamic transformation from nanoclusters to single atoms. The results indicate that the Ru NCs with larger amounts of Ru SAs exhibit superior HER activity in alkaline media with low overpotential of 34 mV at 20 mA cm(-2), which is even significantly better than commercial PVC catalysts. The mass activity of Ru SAs/NCNFs is about 390 A g(Ru)(-1) at an overpotential of 100 mV, which is similar to 3.5 times higher than that of commercial PVC (110 A g(Pt)(-1)). This strategy will provide a new way for the large-scale production of MSAs transformed from different metal nanoparticles or nanoclusters.									35	0	0	0	3	0	35			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000525862500024		
J	Song, Yu; Jiang, Bo; Mathews, Jonathan P.; Yan, Gaoyuan; Li, Fengli					Song, Yu/0000-0001-6602-3895			Structural transformations and hydrocarbon generation of low-rank coal (vitrinite) during slow heating pyrolysis								FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY				167				535	544		10.1016/j.fuproc.2017.08.003				DEC 1 2017	2017	To explore the liquefaction behaviors of low-rank coal vitrinite, the transformations accompanying vitrinite pyrolysis were examined at 10 degrees C per hour between 350 and 520 degrees C. Structural characterization was every 10 degrees C for FTIR and every 20-30 degrees C for C-13 NMR and chemical analysis. The gaseous yield of C-1-C-5 was evaluated by gas chromatography (GC). From the transformations, identified by these various techniques, the structural evolution at this heating rate generally occurred in three distinct stages: 350-390, 410-470, and > 490 degrees C. There was a linear increase of (1)f(a) (FTIR-determined aromaticity) between 410 and 470 degrees C. The hydroxyl content decreased while the aro-OH signal increased at temperatures < 440 degrees C. There was a slow increase of (1)f(a) during the 490-520 degrees C. The ratio of aromatic bridge carbon to aromatic peripheral Carbon (x(Bp)) is an indicator for the size of the basic structural size (BSU). The X-Bp of vitrinite (0.21) was similar to naphthalene (x(Bp) = 0.20) and smaller than the value for anthracene (X-Bp = 0.28). At 440 and 510 degrees C, the X-Bp is 0.28 and 0.32 respectively, corresponding to anthracene or phenanthrene (x(Bp) = 0.31), but < pyrene (x(Bp) = 0.37). The increasing xBp demonstrates the aromatization as the slow pyrolysis process continues. There was a significant reduction in the oxygen content between 350 and 390 degrees C, then the content slowly increases between 390 and 430 degrees C (due to preferential loss of hydrocarbons), and finally with a slow reduction > 430 degrees C. When > 470 degrees C, FTIR data indicated that much of the oxygen was in ether form. The highest contribution of OH (FTIR), the highest Cr-CB hydrocarbon generation rates, and a transition in the aliphatic carbon occurs at 380, 470, and 510 degrees C. The temperature programmed pyrolysis work here is of interest in coal utilization processes where there is a slow heating rate.									31	2	0	0	0	0	33			0378-3820	1873-7188		WOS:000413126400055		
J	Waloszek, A; Wieckowski, S								Dioxygen uptake by isolated thylakoids from lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.): simultaneous measurements of dioxygen uptake, pH change of the medium and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				83	3			287	296		10.1007/s11120-004-5829-2				MAR 2005	2005	The setup has been elaborated for the simultaneous measurements of dioxygen uptake, pH changes, and chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters of an isolated thylakoid suspension. Using this equipment we have found at least three kinetically distinguishable components in the response of dioxygen uptake and pH increase to light intensity in the range of 01600 mu E m-2 s-1 . The pH changes were not observed in the presence of uncouplers (2 mu M valinomycin plus 2 mu M nigericin) while O-2 uptake increased by about 10% and F-v/F-m ratio appeared to be unaffected by this treatment. Treatment with DNP-INT, an inhibitor of plastoquinol oxidation, led to a significant reduction of pH increase and O-2 consumption whereas F-v/F-m was impaired only to 71% of the control. Incubation with catalase (580 U/ml) caused a total inhibition of oxygen uptake, while the pH increased and the F-v/F-m ratio decreased to about 60% and 85% of the control, respectively. The addition of catalase after the irradiation period led to an evolution of the same amount of dioxygen as was consumed during the light period. These results show that hydrogen peroxide was formed in the investigated system and accumulated during illumination. On the basis of the obtained data, three sites of dioxygen reduction within isolated thylakoid membranes and the dependence of dioxygen uptake on the photosystem activities were discussed.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000228517600003	16143918

The lattice of 2D materials and the interface between 2D covers and other substrates provide intriguing confinement environments for active sites, which has stimulated a rising area of "confinement catalysis with 2D materials." Fundamental understanding of confinement catalysis with 2D materials will favor the rational design of high-performance 2D nanocatalysts. Confinement catalysis with 2D materials has found extensive applications in energy-related reaction processes, especially in the conversion of small energy-related molecules such as O-2, CH4, CO, CO2, H2O, and CH3OH. Two representative strategies, i.e., 2D lattice-confined single atoms and 2D cover-confined metals, have been applied to construct 2D confinement catalytic systems with superior catalytic activity and stability. Herein, the recent advances in the design, applications, and structure-performance analysis of two 2D confinement catalytic systems are summarized. The different routes for tuning the electronic states of 2D confinement catalysts are highlighted and perspectives on confinement catalysis with 2D materials toward energy conversion and utilization in the future are provided.									143	7	0	0	4	0	143			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000480175300001	31390100

For atom adsorption on the FeO/Pt(111) coincidence lattice, two types of adsorption were found, in agreement with previous studies. One is that the Au atom binds with one Fe cation lifted from underneath to the top of the oxygen layer (flipped adsorption), and the other is that the Au atom adsorbs directly on the oxygen layer (direct adsorption). Flipped adsorption was found to be energetically most favored in all domains of the Moire superstructure, while direct adsorption was either metastable or unstable. The charge of the Au adatom is negative for the flipped adsorption and positive for the direct adsorption. For the Au2 and Au4 clusters, the global most stable adsorption configurations on the FeO/Pt(111) were explored, and the results indicated that one-dimensional (dimer) or two-dimensional (Au-4) upright configurations of direct adsorption were energetically preferred over the flat or three-dimensional ones throughout the Moire superstructure. Moreover, it was found that the configurations of Au-2 dimers and Au-4 clusters on FeO/Pt(111) is tightly related to the interfacial interaction including two effects: the direction-dependent reactivity of a planar Au cluster and the interfacial electrostatic interaction between the Au clusters and the FeO/Pt(111) support. The role of relativistic effects in the configuration of Au clusters and the interaction with FeO/Pt(111) were illustrated. The evolution of small Au cluster configuration on FeO/Pt(111) was discussed.									20	3	0	0	0	0	21			1098-0121			WOS:000299000700008

Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) controls the expression of several genes' encoding involved in physiological responses towards reduced oxygen availability, in particular by increasing serum erythropoietin (EPO). It may be involved in the individual variability for erythropoietic markers and/or sea-level performance of athletes using altitude during their training. Therefore, we investigated whether, before training, evolutions of hif-1 alpha and ahif (HIF-1 alpha natural antisense) transcript amounts and HIF-1 alpha protein quantities in leukocytes measured during an acute hypoxia nonnobaric test Q h at 3000 m at rest) could allow to predict poor and good responders for hematological markers after a "living high-training low" protocol. Methods: Eighteen elite swimmers were divided into two groups that followed a 13-d training program: "living low-training low" (1200 m) (LL) or "living high (2500-3000 m)-training low (1200 m)" (LH). Results: During the initial hypoxia test, a strong interindividual variability in the amounts of HIF-1 alpha mRNA, aHIF transcript, and HIF-1 alpha protein was observed in athlete leukocytes (after vs before): -82%/+396%, -100%/+229%, and -100%/+633%, respectively. After the test, serum erythropoietin concentration was increased (11.2 +/- 0.8 vs 9.8 +/- 0.8 IU-L-1; +18%, P = 0.01). After the training protocol, total red cell volume (+7.6%, P = 0.04) and circulating hemoglobin amount (48.8 +/- 2.8 vs 45.5 +/- 3.0 mmol; i.e., +7.9%, P = 0.02) were significantly augmented in LH. Conclusion: We conclude that hif-1 alpha gene expression quantification in leukocytes after a 3-h hypoxia test performed before training does not predict poor and good responder athletes to "living high-training low" model.									22	1	0	0	14	0	23			0195-9131	1530-0315		WOS:000239697200007	16888453

It crystallizes in a monoclinic structure (SG C2/m) where the MnO6 octahedra elongation is ascribed to the Yahn-Teller (Y-T) effect of Mn3+ ions. From chemical analysis, the oxide is more accurately formulated as CuMnO2.01. Above 250 degrees C, it undergoes a reversible transition to spinel Cu (x) Mn3-x O-4 and beyond 940 degrees C it converts back to Cu1.1Mn0.9O2. Extrapolation of high-temperature magnetic data indicates T-intercept theta(p) of -450 K and an effective moment of 5.22 mu(B), consistent with strong antiferromagnetism in the basal plans and high spin (HS) configuration Mn3+. This value is slightly larger than that of the spin only moment, a behavior ascribed to Cu2+ originating from oxygen insertion. As prepared, CuMnO2 displays p-type conductivity with an activation energy of 0.16 eV. Most holes generated upon band gap excitation are trapped on Cu+ ions and the conduction occurs by small polarons hopping between neighboring sites. The linear increase of thermopower for Cu1.05Mn0.95O2 with temperature indicates a hole mobility mu(300 K) (3.5 x 10(-6) cm(2) V-1 s(-1)) thermally activated. CuMnO2 is made p- and n-type and the difference in the carriers mobilities is attributed to different oxygen polyhedra. The title oxide, characterized photo electrochemically, exhibits a pH-insensitive flat band potential (+0.13 V-SCE). The valence band, located at 5.3 eV below vacuum, is made up of Cu 3d orbital. As application, the powder showed a good performance for the H-2-photo evolution.									28	1	0	0	0	0	29			0022-2461			WOS:000247934600079

This burgeoning issue has led to explosive research efforts worldwide to find alternative, metal-free and noble metal-free catalysts that are composed of inexpensive and earth-abundant elements. Hence, the recent discoveries that doping carbon nanomaterials with heteroatoms (such as N, S, B, etc.) can give sustainable materials with good electrocatalytic activity for reactions carried out in fuel cells and electrolyzers have been not only quite exciting but also very promising to address these challenging issues. Interestingly, even though they contain no metals or involve only the inexpensive, more earth-abundant ones, the catalytic activity of some of these materials fares well with those of the commercially used noble metal-based electrocatalysts, such as Pt/C. However, research efforts to improve the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability of some of these materials for various reactions are still necessary and thus continuing. While some of these efforts have focused on finding synthetic methods that can tune the structures and compositions of already known materials and thereby improve their catalytic properties (activity, selectivity, stability, etc.), others have focused on developing entirely new materials that can exhibit better or superior catalytic properties. In these efforts, additional considerations are also being paid to find facile synthetic routes or renewable and inexpensive precursors that can lead to such types of catalysts in order to make the entire process highly sustainable and widely applicable.In this Account, notable heteroatom-doped carbon catalysts that have been developed for reactions in fuel cells and water electrolyzers, the various synthetic procedures employed to make them, and the challenges involved in their synthesis as well as their characterizations are discussed. The methods used to systematically vary the structures and compositions of the precursors of these materials, as well as the materials themselves, and the different experimental, imaging, and spectroscopic methods used to investigate the properties and structure-property relationships of the materials for various energy related reactions are also included. The discussions focus mainly around the recent notable results reported on these materials by the authors and other research groups worldwide, albeit not exhaustively. Finally, the authors perspective about the challenges remaining in the field that need to be addressed, the many existing unanswered questions that beg for more research, and the future prospects for research related to the above topics are also mentioned.									154	9	0	0	11	0	154			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000384038600029	27599362

The physical and chemical processes of particle gasification and their interaction with the reactive gas flow are modeled within a multi-fluid framework derived from kinetic theory of granular flows. The transport equations of continuous solid phases and species mass fraction of CO, CO2, CH4, H-2, H2O, O-2, N-2, tar, char, and ash are coupled with chemical kinetic models, which describe moisture vaporization, particle devolatilization, homogeneous volatile reaction, heterogeneous char oxidation and char gasification. Continuously variable particle density due to volatilization of lighter components and chemical reactions is implemented to account for the evolution of reacting particles' physical properties. A time-splitting method is employed for decoupling the chemical source from convection. A time-step adaption and restart procedure is implemented to provide the solution stability for strong chemical reaction and to achieve numerical solution efficiency for energy reactor simulations in the time-splitting approach. The chemical source terms based on chemical kinetics are implemented with first-order accuracy in the finite-volume framework The CFD model is used to simulate wood gasification using air as a fluidization agent in a lab-scale FBG. The simulation results provide detailed information on the dynamic particle processes, char elutriation, and gas composition at the reactor outlet. Operating conditions of different air/biomass mass flow ratio, reactor temperature, and biomass moisture content are simulated and analyzed as to their influence on gas composition and product yields at the gasifier outlet (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The photocatalytic activities of indirect all-solid-state Z-scheme g-C3N4-RGO-TiO2 nanoheterojunctions were evaluated by the degradation of methylene blue (MB). The results showed that the introduction of RGO as an interfacial mediator into direct Z-scheme g-C3N4-TiO2 nanocomposites can remarkably enhance their photocatalytic activities. The as-obtained indirect all-solid-state Z-scheme g-C3N4-RGO-TiO2 nanoheterojunctions, with the optimal loading amount of 10 wt% RGO, exhibited the highest rate towards the photocatalytic degradation of MB under simulated solar light irradiation. The degradation kinetics of MB can be described by the apparent first-order kinetics model. The highest degradation rate constant of 0.0137 min(-1) is about 4.7 and 3.2 times greater than those of the pure g-C3N4 (0.0029 min-1) and direct Z-scheme g-C3N4-TiO2 (0.0043 min(-1)), respectively. An indirect all-solid-state Z-scheme charge-separation mechanism was proposed based on the photoluminescence spectra and the trapping experiment procedure of the photo-generated active species. It was believed that the indirect all-solid-state Z-scheme charge separation mechanism in g-C3N4-RGO-TiO2 nanoheterojunctions could lead to the promoted charge separation and transfer, improved oxygen-reduction capacity of electrons in g-C3N4 and the formation of hydroxyl radicals driven by the holes in TiO2, respectively, thus achieving the highly enhanced photocatalytic degradation performance. This work might provide new insights and understanding on the graphene as electron mediators to design highly efficient all-solid-state Z-scheme nanoheterojunctions with enhanced visible-light driven photoactivity for various photocatalytic applications.

XRD analysis of the Bi1-xGdxVO4 system showed the existence of two structures. For 0.3 <= x <= 1.0, the structure was of zircon-tetragonal type while the structure was scheelite-monoclinic when x=0. For 0.1<x<0.3, tetragonal and monoclinic structures were observed. Bi1-xGdxVO4 can split water into hydrogen when loaded with 0.3% (w) Pt. Furthermore, while Bi0.5Gd0.5VO4 was found to act as a photocatalyst for overall water splitting under UV light when loaded with RuO2, Pt/Cr2O3 and Rh/Cr2O3 we found that the photocatalyst loaded with Rh/Cr2O3 had the best photocatalytic property. The amounts of hydrogen and oxygen produced were about 48.22 and 24.13 mu mol . h(-1) under UV light irradiation, respectively. The photocatalytic activity for water splitting under visible light was also examined. This study indicated that the formation of a solid solution was a feasible method to adjust the conduction band and valence band to obtain a visible-light-driven photocatalyst.									2	4	0	0	1	0	5			1000-6818			WOS:000268651600037

Thus, in this study, a novel core-shell CdIn2S4/Ta3N5 (CIS/TN) nanocomposite photocatalyst was designed and successfully fabricated via the facile in-situ hydrothermal process, where the CdIn2S4 nano-octahedra densely anchored on the surface of Ta3N5 nanoparticles to form the core-shell heterostructure. The as-prepared CIS/TN heterostructures all showed high dual-functional photocatalytic performances for H-2 generation and Methyl Orange (MO) decomposition. Compared with pristine CdIn2S4, the photocatalytic activities of CIS/TN heterostructures were obviously enhanced and the sample CIS/TN-3 with the 3 wt% of Ta3N5 possessed the highest H-2 production of 122.6 mu mol.h(-1).g(-1), which was about 2.43 times as high as that of CdIn2S4 nano-octahedra. Also, it presented the optimal MO photodegradation efficiency (92.2%) and its rate constant was 2.79 times higher than that of pure CdIn2S4. The wonderful dual-functional photocatalytic performance could be attributed to the broad spectral adsorption region and efficient transfer of photoinduced charge carriers between the intimate heterogeneous interface, which would lead to the higher quantum yield and efficiency. The detailed charge transfer path and possible reaction mechanism were also proposed based on the results of trapping experiments and ESR analysis. Our research may provide a direct guidance for developing other highly-efficient Ta3N5-based core/shell heterostructure for energy conversion and environmental governance.									18	1	0	0	1	0	19			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000471996400124		
J	Wheeler, MD; Todd, MW; Anderson, DT; Lester, MI								Stimulated Raman excitation of the ortho-H-2-OH entrance channel complex								JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS				110	14			6732	6742		10.1063/1.478578				APR 8 1999	1999	The fundamental H-2 vibration of the ortho-H-2-OH complex in its ground electronic state has been observed at 4151.49+/-0.03 cm(-1) via stimulated Raman excitation. The stimulated Raman transition has been identified with an ultraviolet probe laser using two different detection schemes. The transition was detected as a depletion in the H-2-OH laser-induced fluorescence signal in the OH A (2)Sigma(+) - X (II)-I-2 (1,0) spectral region and through the appearance of OH A (2)Sigma(+) - X (II)-I-2 (0,1) laser-induced fluorescence following vibrational predissociation of the complex. Vibrational predissociation is found to proceed via a near-resonant pathway that transfers one quantum of vibrational excitation from H-2 to OH. The remaining similar to 529 cm(-1) of available energy is distributed over excited rotational states of OH (v = 1) and the lowest rotational level of ortho-H-2 (v = 1), with the balance flowing into translational recoil. The lifetime of vibrationally activated ortho-H-2-OH (nu(H2) = 1) is determined to be less than 7 ns, the temporal resolution of the lasers, by monitoring the time evolution of the OH products.

To this end, our work has made three main contributions. At first, we have demonstrated that exfoliation via ionic liquid assisted grinding combined with gradient centrifugation is an efficient method to exfoliate bulk WS2 to nanosheets with a thickness of a few atomic layers and lateral size dimensions in the range of 100 nm to 2 nm. These WS2 nanosheets decorated with scattered nanodots exhibited highly enhanced catalytic performance for HER with an onset potential of -130 mV vs. RHE, an overpotential of 337 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 80 mV dec(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4. Secondly, we found a strong aging effect on the electrocatalytic performance of WS2 stored in high boiling point organic solvents such as dimethylformamide (DMF). Importantly, the HER ability could be recovered by removing the organic (DMF) residues, which obstructed the electron transport, with acetone. Thirdly, we established that the HER performance of WS2 nanosheets/nanodots could be significantly enhanced by activating the electrode surface at a positive voltage for a very short time (60 s), decreasing the kinetic overpotential by more than 80 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The performance enhancement was found to arise primarily from the ability of a formed proton-intercalated amorphous tungsten trioxide (a-WO3) to provide additional active sites and favourably modify the immediate chemical environment of the WS2 catalyst, rendering it more favorable for local proton delivery and/or transport to the active edge site of WS2. Our results provide new insights into the effects of organic solvents and electrochemical activation on the catalytic performance of twodimensional WS2 for HER.									29	1	0	0	2	0	29			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000411613400017	28869262

Herein, we report a conformal BiVO4-layer/WO3-nanoplate-array heterojunction photoanode modified with cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) as oxygen evolution cocatalyst (OEC) for significant enhancement in PEC performances. The BiVO4/WO3 nanocomposite is fabricated by coating a thin conformal BiVO4 layer on the surface of presynthesized WO3 nanoplate arrays (NPAs) via stepwise spin-coating, and the decoration of Co-Pi OEC is realized by photoassisted electrodeposition method. The optimized Co-Pip BiVO4/WO3 heterojunction photoanode shows a maximum photo current of 1.8 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs RHE in a phosphate buffer electrolyte under an AM1.5G solar simulator, which is 5 and 12 times higher than those of bare WO3 and BiVO4 photoanode, respectively. Measurements of UV-vis absorption spectra, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and photoluminescence (PL) spectra reveal that the enhanced PEC performances can be attributed to the increased charge carrier separation/transport benefited from the type II nature of BiVO4/WO3 heterojunction and the promoted water oxidation kinetics and photostability owing to the decoration of Co-Pi cocatalyst.									61	0	0	0	3	0	61			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000459221900008	30004671

The structural evolution of B-doped CFs on different B concentrations and heat-treatment temperatures was studied using scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. It was found that introducing B changed the morphology of the CFs. At high temperatures, the strong erosion of B vapor, not only changed the primary structure of CFs, but also produced more flaws. Structural analysis indicates that B is mostly substitutionally bonded within the graphene sheet regardless of the experimental conditions. As increasing from 2200 to 2600 degrees C in the graphite crucible containing 10% B4C, the concentration of substitutional B increased progressively from 0.81 to 2.57 at.%. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that B-doping greatly improved oxidation resistance of the CFs with the oxidation onset temperature increasing from 640 degrees C (0 at.% B doped, 2.1% weight loss) to about 800 degrees C (3.65 at.% B doped, 0.3% weight loss). The correlation between structural evolution and oxidation resistance of B-doped CFs provides a new route for fabricating the CFs with oxidation resistance up to 800 degrees C. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, the evolution, kinetics, and energetics of this degradation are quantified. Specifically, the deterioration of graphene on SiO2 is studied in grain interiors and at grain boundaries in ambient air, dry air and nitrogen between 473 and 673 K, using spatially and temporally resolved in situ Raman spectroscopy in addition to electron microscopy and charge transport measurements. The grain interiors of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown graphene monolayers oxidize with an activation energy of 0.63 +/- 0.05 eV in ambient air (15 000 ppm H2O). This energy increases to 1.85 +/- 0.17 eV in dry air, whereas degradation is immeasurable in nitrogen and for multilayers even in ambient air. Gasification at grain boundaries in a CVD monolayer proceeds at a rate of (1.08 +/- 0.02) x 10(-1) nm s(-1) at 673 K with an activation energy EA = 1.14 +/- 0.10 eV in ambient air. The more facile degradation of the monolayer grain interiors in ambient air indicates the role of the substrate in decreasing the stability against oxidation. The electrical transport mobility decays with an activation rate similar to that of grain interiors. These results can be used to quantitatively predict graphene oxidation and gasification on SiO2 in different environments and temperatures.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000351934700023	25771959

The photocatalysts show different catalytic performance in degradation of Rhodamine (RhB) and methyl orange (MO). The doping treatment endows photocatalysts improved activity for decomposing RhB molecules. Subsequently heterojunction formation by incorporation of Ag-related species facilitates the degradation of the MO molecules, but it seems like at the expense of the activity of RhB molecules decomposition. By combining studying the evolutions of micro-structure, electronic structure, and spatial charge separation of each sample, we found that the photoluminescence reflected spatial charge separation effect cannot be used to fully explain aforementioned trends of the photocatalytic activity. In this background, we systematically studied the roles of each individual active species that influenced photocatalytic performances for each sample, and a reasonable degradation mechanism on the basis of roles of different active species is proposed to interpret the above photocatalytic phenomena in detail. Furthermore, we believe that this work not only presents a facile route to modify catalyst for enhancing photocatalytic performance, but the more important is that, it reveals the enhancement mechanism from the viewpoints by combining both effective charge separation and proportion evolution of active species.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000620364300004

For large-scale H-2 production, properties such as low overpotential, stability, sustainability and resistivity are the major things to address in the designing of an electrocatalyst. In this line, we have constructed a shape-selective ultra-low Rhodium (Rh) nanoparticles (NPs) as an active electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the high cost and scarcity of Rh are barriers to its utilization in large scale electrocatalytic water splitting. The idea of using biomolecule DNA to reduce the Rh metal percentage and also erradicate the use of external binder is an alternate strategy in the field of electrocatalysis. Also, the method of DNA metallization (Rh/DNA) is quite simple to prepare within a short time span of just 15 min in aqueous medium. The resulting DNA mediated Rh nano-huddles (Rh/DNA-1) shows excellent activity in the HER of 0.5 M H2SO4 with a mass loading of 0.007 mg cm(-2), which is comparatively 30 times less loading than the commercial loading of 0.205 mg cm(-2). Because of this low loading, the observed mass activities were really huge and Rh/DNA-1 showed 1257 A g(-1) at an overpotential of 100 mV. Rh/DNA-1 required an overpotential of 105 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and 194 mV for 50 mA cm(-2), respectively. Also, it showed excellent stability over 36 000 s at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in chronoamperometry studies with no loss in activity. Moreover, the catalyst shows a very low charge transfer resistance (R-ct) of 1.8 omega and follows facile kinetics with a lower Tafel value of 68 mV dec(-1) for Rh/DNA-1. Further, the TOF was calculated at 300 mV and Rh/DNA-1 showed 0.00064 s(-1). For comparison, Rh NPs without DNA were studied for the HER and required 97 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with 0.205 mg cm(-2) loading, showing the essentiality of DNA in the electrocatalytic HER study. Therefore, DNA-based electrocatalysts may help to develop cost effective and efficient electrocatalysts in the near future.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000618050600018

The influence of gadolinium ions on structural behavior of the phosphate tellurate glass has been investigated using infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The addition of gadolinium ions into the host glass matrix leads to an increase of the glass network polymerization due to the replacement of P-O-P bonds by the more. resistant P-O-Te bonds having as result the improvement of the chemical durability of the glass. The structural evolution of the studied glasses with the gradual increase of the gadolinium oxide content up to 20 mol % could be explained by considering that the excess of oxygen may be accommodated by the conversion of some orthophosphate structural units into metaphosphate or/and pyrophosphate units. X-ray diffraction and IR spectra revealed that heat treatment of the samples also causes an increase of the glass network polymerization for heat treatment times, t, up to 36 h, while for 36 h > t >= 48 h showed a drastic structural modification which lead to the apparition of the Te4P2O13 crystalline phase. DFT calculations show that tellurium atoms occupy two different sites in the proposed model. In the first case the tellurium atom is coordinated with four oxygen atoms giving a trigonal bipyramide arrangement, while in the second case the tellurium atom is coordinated with three O atoms. The calculated IR absorption spectrum of the proposed model for phosphotellurite glasses is in good agreement with the experimental absorption data.									48	0	0	0	0	0	48			1089-5639			WOS:000260533000026	18847248

Due to the unique layered quasi-two-dimensional superlattice structure, and the specific functions of structural motifs, delafossite compounds have become a popular candidate family for photoelectric conversion applications. In this article, 3R-delafossite CuFeO2 microcrystals with complete stoichiometry, high crystallinity and purity, uniform composition, cubic size of similar to 1.47 mu m, single crystal phase were obtain by the optimized hydrothermal process. Combined with optical measurement and density functional theory calculation, the electron transition mechanism of CuFeO2 was analyzed in depth and systematically. CuFeO2 has obvious multi-band spectral absorption characteristics, which are helpful to clarify the controversy about band gap values of CuFeO2. CuFeO2 microcrystals exhibit potential hydrogen production from photocatalytic water-splitting to and photocatalytic degradation of pollutants. Tetracycline hydrochloride degradation testing was adopted to further verify the potential of CuFeO2 microcrystals for wastewater purification. CuFeO2 microcrystals not only exhibit excellent photocatalytic degradation performance, but also present Fenton reaction activity in dark conditions after adding H2O2. It is particularly important that the removal rate of tetracycline hydrochloride was significantly enhanced by the coupling of photocatalytic reaction and Fenton reaction, suggesting that CuFeO2 emerges excellent Photo-Fenton reaction activity. Finally, this article not only provides the fundamental physical chemical properties of CuFeO2 for solar energy conversion, but also points out the development direction of further improving the efficiency.

The optimal 3D hierarchical Zn0.2Cd0.8S microspheres (ZCS-30) is obtained when adding 30 mL into the synthetic system, which can function as a highly active photocatalyst for H-2 evolution under visible-light irradiation with the wavelength of 420 nm, delivering an activity approximately 2.5 and 7.5 times higher than that of Zn0.2Cd0.8S nanoparticles and CdS counterparts, respectively, and giving an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 7.4%. Furthermore, the ZCS-30 photocatalyst shows the good stability after the catalytic H-2 evolution for 15 h (5 cycles). In addition, the ZCS-30 photocatalyst exhibits the excellent degradation of Rhodamine B (Rh B) almost up to 80% under the visible light irradiation over a period of 150 min. The results demonstrate that ZCS-30 can serve as a promising visible-light-driven bifunctional photocatalyst for water splitting and dye degradation. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

However, photoinduced activation of inert dinitrogen is an important factor hindering the development of this technology. Herein, in-situ Fe3+ doped flower-like BiOCl with highly active sites exposure was prepared by a solvent thermal method, which has excellent performance of N-2 photofixation. Compared with virgin BiOCl with no nitrogen fixation activity, Fe-BiOCl reached 30 mu mol.L-1.h(-1) ammonia evolution rate under simulated sunlight without any sacrificial reagent. Characterization results demonstrated that the enhancement of N-2 photofixation capacity was mainly attributed to the in-situ doped Fe3+ in BiOCl, the doped Fe3+ not only acts as a reaction center for N-2 activation also as an "electron transfer bridge" trapping and migrating electrons from BiOCl to N-2 molecules. Furthermore, the transformation of crystal facets from virgin BiOCl (001) to Fe-BiOCl (110) and (102) is more conducive for the exposure and accessibility of iron reactive sites. This work developed a potential strategy by in-situ introducing Fe3+ active sites in BiOCl semiconductor substrate, which establishes a good basis for the application of semiconductor catalysts in nitrogen fixation.

Typhimurium) is a major intestinal pathogen of both humans and animals. Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1)-encoded virulence genes are required for S. Typhimurium invasion. While oxygen (O-2) limitation is an important signal for SPI-1 induction under host conditions, how the signal is received and integrated to the central SPI-1 regulatory system in S. Typhimurium is not clear. Here, we report a signal transduction pathway that activates SPI-1 expression in response to low O-2. A novel regulator encoded within SPI-14 (STM14_1008), named LoiA (low oxygen induced factor A), directly binds to the promoter and activates transcription of hilD, leading to the activation of hilA (the master activator of SPI-1). Deletion of loiA significantly decreased the transcription of hilA, hilD and other representative SPI-1 genes (sipB, spaO, invH, prgH and invF) under low O-2 conditions. The response of LoiA to the low O-2 signal is mediated by the ArcB/ArcA two-component system. Deletion of either arcA or arcB significantly decreased transcription of loiA under low O-2 conditions. We also confirmed that SPI-14 contributes to S. Typhimurium virulence by affecting invasion, and that loiA is the virulence determinant of SPI-14. Mice infection assays showed that S. Typhimurium virulence was severely attenuated by deletion of either the entire SPI-14 region or the single loiA gene after oral infection, while the virulence was not affected by either deletion after intraperitoneal infection. The signal transduction pathway described represents an important mechanism for S. Typhimurium to sense and respond to low O-2 conditions of the host intestinal tract for invasion. SPI-14encoded loiA is an essential element of this pathway that integrates the low O-2 signal into the SPI-1 regulatory system. Acquisition of SPI-14 is therefore crucial for the evolution of S. Typhimurium as an intestinal pathogen.									38	1	1	0	35	0	40			1553-7366	1553-7374		WOS:000404511700028	28575106

Crystallographic control on the stoichiometry of dissolution reaction								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				126				574	594		10.1016/j.gca.2013.10.047				FEB 1 2014	2014	The incongruent dissolution of feldspar is associated with the formation and evolution of Si-rich amorphous interfacial structures during its chemical weathering. The stoichiometry of dissolution is compositionally dependent, and this dependence reflects the nature of dissolution reaction as a combination of surface renewal and heterogeneous chemical reaction. We hypothesize that during continuous surface renewal, reactive sites on a feldspar's surface will inherit characteristics from the bulk structure of the primary mineral. Hence, the dissolution rate of feldspar depends not only on water chemistry but also on its crystallographic properties. We propose a new formalism to quantify the dependence of the dissolution rates of feldspars on their crystallographic properties. A correlation between the degree of Al/Si ordering and the stoichiometry of feldspar dissolution is predicted based on this formalism. This correlation is verified by a combination of water chemistry analysis, synchrotron X-ray diffraction with structure refinement (HR-XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). We find that the rates of dissolution and the degree to which dissolution is incongruent depend on the frequency of SiOSi and SiOAl linkages (chemistry) and the crystallographic characteristics of these linkages (bond lengths, bond angles, and ordering) in the dissolving mineral. The knowledge of Al/Si ordering provides a means to quantify the relative abundances of Si atoms with different reactivities. Using a C (1) over bar -based structure model, we show that the distribution of Al within the Al-rich (T1) type of tetrahedral sites has only a minor effect on dissolution stoichiometry, whereas the distribution of Al between the T1-type and the Si-rich (T2)-type of sites affects dissolution incongruence predominantly. A greater extent of disorder results in higher dissolution incongruence. As an implication, our results suggest that the formation of interfacial structures during silicate dissolution should at least be partially affected by reactivity differences among the framework atoms of a silicate.

In this study, the electron accepting capacities (EAC5) of the barley grass biochars produced at the various temperatures from 350 degrees C to 800 degrees C were investigated. The EAC values were in the range of 0.27-0.72 mmol e(-) (g biochar)(-1) and showed increase as the pyrolysis temperature increased from 350 degrees C to 450 degrees C, slight decrease with temperature increasing from 450 degrees C to 500 degrees C, and then increase again from 650 degrees C to 800 degrees C. The O-containing groups were the EAC moieties identified by temperature programmed desorption coupled with mass spectroscopy (TPD-MS) and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and carbonyl and quinone were the main EAC moieties, accounting for 75.4%-95.7% as the pyrolysis temperature increased from 350 degrees C to 800 degrees C. Overall, carbonyl and quinone determined the EACs properties of biochar which were affected by the pyrolysis temperature.

Loadings of WO3-x and MoS2 as well as the synthesis time of the microwave- assisted hydrothermal process were optimized, and the physicochemical and optical properties of the as-prepared photocatalysts were characterized by various techniques. Results showed that the material with 30 wt% of WO3-x, 0.1 wt% of MoS2 and a preparation time of 120 minutes exhibited the most desirable morphology and structure for hydrogen production. The maximum hydrogen production of 2852.5 mu mol g-1 h-1 was achieved, which was 5.5 times that of pure CdS (519.1 mu mol g-1 h-1) and 1.5 times that of CdS/30 wt% WO3-x (1879.0 mu mol g-1 h-1), and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) reached 10.0% at 420 nm. The improvement of photocatalytic performance could be attributed to the Z-scheme formed between CdS and WO3-x and MoS2 as an electron trap. It is worth mentioning that the size of the composite had a negative correlation with the H2 production rate.									34	3	0	0	2	0	34			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000470756000030	31139773	
J	Das, Sweta; Sahoo, Pramoda Kumar				Dasari, Bhoomaiah/I-6562-2017				Ceruloplasmin, a moonlighting protein in fish								FISH & SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY				82				460	468		10.1016/j.fsi.2018.08.043				NOV 2018	2018	Ceruloplasmin is an ancient multicopper oxidase evolved to insure a safe handling of oxygen in some metabolic pathways of vertebrates. The current knowledge of its structure provides a glimpse of its plasticity, revealing a multitude of binding sites that point to an elaborate mechanism of multifunctional activity. Ceruloplasmin is highly conserved throughout the vertebrate evolution. Cupredoxin, a multi-cupper blue protein is believed to be the evolutionary precursor of ceruloplasmin with three trinuclear and three mononuclear copper binding sites. There are 20 copper-binding residues in ceruloplasmin gene out of which 16 residues are conserved in fish. This ceruloplasmin gene is being characterized in zebrafish (Danio rerio), rohu (Labeo rohita), Indian medaka (Oryzias melastigama), catfish (Ictalurus ptmctatus), icefish (Chionodraco rastrospinosus), goldfish (Carassius auratus) and yellow perch (Percaflaviscens). The complete coding sequence of fish ceruloplasmin gene is around 3.2 kb which codes for 1000 to 1100 amino acid residues. The size of ceruloplasmin gene sequence in fish ranges around 13 kb containing 20 exons and 19 introns. Liver is the major site of synthesis in fish. Increased expression of this gene during bacterial infection in channel catfish and rohu suggested its potential involvement in bacterial disease response in fish. It has been found to serve as an indirect marker for selection against Aeromonas hydrophila resistance in rohu carp. Ceruloplasmin expression is also evident during parasitic infection in few fish species. The role of this gene is well studied during inflammatory response to hormonal, drug and heavy metal mediated toxicity in fish. Overall, ceruloplasmin represents an example of a 'moonlighting' protein that overcomes the one gene-one structure-one function concept to follow the changes of the organism in its physiological and pathological conditions.									15	0	0	0	12	0	16			1050-4648	1095-9947		WOS:000447571600052	30144565	
J	Havaux, M								Probing electron transport through and around photosystem II in vivo by the combined use of photoacoustic spectroscopy and chlorophyll fluorometry								ISRAEL JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY				38	3			247	256						1998	1998	Photoacoustic spectroscopy and chlorophyll fluorometry were used in combination to monitor in vivo several aspects of the photosystem II (PSII) function (O-2 evolution, electron transport, and energy storage) in leaves of various plant genotypes. Exposure of barley leaves to 45 degrees C in low light induced a rapid and complete disruption of the O-2-evolving complex of PSII, as shown by the suppression of the photobaric component of the photoacoustic signal. The photoacoustically measured loss of O-2 evolution during heat stress (i) was confirmed by polarographic measurements of O-2 exchange by the leaf samples, (ii) was shown to be independent of the activity of the carbonic anhydrase, and (iii) was not correlated with a concomitant suppression of the photochemical energy storage and the electron transport activity of PSII. The maintenance of a significant PSII photochemical activity in the absence of O-2 evolution is indicative of cyclic electron transport around PSII which bypasses the O-2-evolving complex. The modulation-frequency dependence of the energy stored during cyclic PSII activity, its inhibition by the herbicide diuron, and its insensitivity to the plastoquinol antagonist DBMIB (2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone) indicated that Q(B), the secondary electron acceptor of PSII, is involved in the electron cycle and that the rate-limiting step of the cycle is a reaction with a half-time of ca. 1.5 ms. In the absence of heat stress, overreduction of the plastoquinone pool by strong illumination or by leaf infiltration with DBMIB was not sufficient to induce appreciable cyclic electron transport around PSII. The electron cycle was insensitive to preferential excitation of carotenoids with a blue-green light and was not significantly affected by the operation of the xanthophyll cycle. Interruption of the electron cycle by diuron during prolonged heat treatment in moderate light was accompanied by a marked peroxidation of the chloroplast thylakoid membranes, as revealed by the appearance of chlorophyll thermoluminescence bands in the temperature range 70-120 degrees C, demonstrating the photoprotective function of electron cycling around PSII.									15	1	0	0	14	0	16			0021-2148			WOS:000081567200013

However, high recombination rate of charge carriers is still one of the biggest factors to restrict the photoactivity of CoP/g-C3N4. In this paper, Boron doped g-C3N4 nanodots (BCNDs) were introduced to CoP/gC(3)N(4) nanosheets (CoP/CNNS) and a novel CoP/BCNDs/CNNS ternary photocatalyst was constructed. Experimental characterization and testing results indicate that BCNDs/CNNS heterojunction was formed in CoP/BCNDs/CNNS ternary photocatalyst. Comparing with CoP/g-C3N4, CoP/BCNDs/CNNS facilitates electron-hole separation, and the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate can reach 1332.81 mu molg(-1).h(-1), which is approximately 9.7 times as high as CoP/CNNS. It owns an apparent quantum efficiency of 10.78% at 420 nm. This work would provide a novel strategy to construct high activity g-C3N4 based catalyst without noble metals.									28	4	0	0	5	0	29			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000488957400085

By changing the neutrino luminosity and its decay time to obtain parametric explosions in one- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D, respectively) models with or without a 13 isotope alpha network, we study how the inclusion of nuclear burning could affect the postbounce dynamics for 4 progenitor models; 3 for 15.0 M-circle dot stars and 1 for an 11.2 M-circle dot star. We find that the energy supply due to the nuclear burning of infalling material behind the shock can energize the shock expansion, especially for models that produce only marginal explosions in the absence of nuclear burning. These models are energized by nuclear energy deposition when the shock front passes through the silicon-rich layer and/or later as it touches the oxygen-rich layer. Depending on the neutrino luminosity and its decay time, the diagnostic energy of the explosion increases up to a few times 10(50) erg for models with nuclear burning compared to the corresponding models without. We point out that these features are most remarkable for the Limongi-Chieffi progenitor in both 1D and 2D because the progenitor model possesses a massive oxygen layer, with an inner-edge radius that is smallest among the employed progenitors, which means that the shock can touch the rich fuel on a shorter timescale after bounce. The energy difference is generally smaller (similar to 0.1-0.2 x 10(51) erg) in 2D than in 1D (at most similar to 0.6 x 10(51) erg). This is because neutrino-driven convection and the shock instability in 2D models enhance the neutrino heating efficiency, which makes the contribution of nuclear burning relatively smaller compared to 1D models. Considering uncertainties in progenitor models, our results indicate that nuclear burning should remain one of the important ingredients to foster the onset of neutrino-driven explosions.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000334584700033

In our experiments, the parallel to04>(-) state is populated by direct absorption of radiation from a pulsed dye laser tuned to similar to719 nm. Evolution of the population in the (parallel to04>(+/-)) levels is observed using the combination of a frequency-quadrupled Nd:YAG laser, which selectively photolyses H2O(parallel to04>(+/-)), and a frequency-doubled dye laser, which observes the OH(v=0) produced by photodissociation via laser-induced fluorescence. The delay between the pulse from the pump laser and those from the photolysis and probe lasers was systematically varied to generate kinetic decays. The rate coefficients for relaxation of H2O(parallel to04>(+/-)) obtained from these experiments, in units of cm3 molecule-1 s-1, are: k(H2O)=(4.1+/-1.2)x10(-10), k(Ar)=(4.9+/-1.1)x10(-12), k(H-2)=(6.8+/-1.1)x10(-12), k(N-2)=(7.7+/-1.5)x10(-12), k(O-2)=(6.7+/-1.4)x10(-12). The implications of these results for our previous reports of rate constants for the removal of H2O molecules in selected vibrational states by collisions with H atoms (P. W.

The extent to which the recrystallization of carbonates affects the chemistry of sedimentary archives depends on the reaction rate, extent of isotopic disequilibrium, and duration of reaction. The reaction rate, which is obviously critical, can be constrained by the elemental and isotopic compositions of pore fluids. Such constraints are affected by assumptions regarding the temperature in the sedimentary column relative to the temperature of formation, the burial rate, pore fluid advection, the composition of the sediments (carbonate-rich versus siliciclastic), and the porosity of the sediment column. In this study, we use a steady-state analytical solution to the diagenetic equations to constrain depth-dependent reaction rates (and extents of recrystallization) based on the Ca isotopic compositions of pore fluids in sedimentary columns at multiple ocean drilling sites (Sites 807, 984, 1170, and 1171), which encompass a diverse range of sedimentary compositions and conditions. We find that carbonates in siliciclastic sediments are generally less altered by diagenesis than their carbonate-rich counterparts. The discrepancy in recrystallization rates between siliciclastic and carbonate-rich sedimentary sections is, however, significantly smaller than previously estimated, suggesting that siliciclastic archives are not immune to diagenetic effects. While we find that diagenesis can decouple contemporaneous proxies of sea surface temperature (Mg/Ca and delta O-18), our calculations also reveal that delta O-18-based temperature estimates are more robust in siliciclastic sections relative to carbonate-rich sections. Sensitivity tests of the calculated extent of recrystallization suggest that uncertainties in porosity and burial rate are generally the greatest sources of error to proxy reconstruction from diagenetically altered sediments. The conclusions drawn using the analytical solution are benchmarked against a depth-dependent, forward numerical model using the CrunchFlow software (Steefel et al., 2015); ultimately, this comparison demonstrates that the assumptions necessary in deriving the analytical solutions have a relatively minor impact on the resulting conclusions.

Structural and chemical composition studies depict the evolution of Cu-Cu2O-CuO nanoparticles at various process stages. The loading of Cu and Cu oxide nanoparticles on TiO2 catalyst has enhanced the photocatalytic H-2 production. Comparatively, H-2 treatment produces well-dispersed Cu nanoparticles with thin oxide shells that show the highest H-2 production amongst the samples. The relatively higher photocatalytic performance is deemed to result from reduced structural defects, higher surface area and dispersivity as well as favorable charge transfer, which inhibits recombination. The Cu nanoparticles are shown to be a promising alternative to noble metal-loaded TiO2 catalyst systems due to their low cost and high performance in photocatalytic applications.									128	7	0	0	10	0	129			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000313426200041	23228941

By adjusting the amount of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) (0, 0.15, 0.30, 0.60, and 1.20wt%) with the PbTiO3, we constructed various photocatalysts for this investigation. The crystal structure and morphology of the various composites were studied by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Photoelectron spectroscopic study revealed that the band structure of the newly formed composites and efficient charge separation can be obtained by the interfaces of various rGO content. In addition, the photocatalytic performance of the synthesized composites was explored by H-2 evolution and rhodamine blue (RhB) degradation. The obtained results indicated that the addition of the appropriate amount of rGO could improve the activity of pure PbTiO3, significantly.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1687-4110	1687-4129		WOS:000505956600001

The PMOs containing Ru complexes (Ru-PMOs) are synthesized from highly purified Ru complex precursors with three attached alkylsilatrane groups in the presence of a nonionic surfactant (triblock copolymer) using polyacrylic acid as a promoter. The Ru-PMOs show strong absorption in the visible light region up to 600 nm due to a metal-ligand charge transfer band, and redox behaviour at approximate to 0.8 V versus Ag/AgNO3 due to one-electron oxidation, that are very similar to those of homogeneous Ru(dmb)(3)(PF6)(2) (dmb = 4,4'-dimethyl-2,2'-bipyridine) solution, despite the fact that the Ru complexes are embedded in the pore walls at high density. Ru-PMOs loaded with platinum metal or iridium oxide provide efficient photocatalysis for hydrogen evolution or water oxidation, respectively, under irradiation with visible light up to 600 nm in the presence of sacrificial agents. These results indicate that Ru-PMO is a versatile solid photosensitizer for the construction of various heterogeneous photocatalytic systems simply by placing catalytic materials in the stable mesochannels.									34	0	0	0	4	0	34			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000380890200008

(2) In the low light (LL) adapted samples there was a delay in photosynthesis,and PSⅡ was immediately inhibited if the samples were put in light conditions.However,medium light (ML) conditions showed photochemical reactions and heat dissipation to be in balance.In high light (HL) conditions electric transport rate (ETR) was near saturation,and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) was higher than LL and ML conditions.It was also observed that under HL conditions ETR_ (max) in tip and middle of the juveniles was higher than that in the base (P<0.05) . (3) For LL and ML adapted samples,NPQ recovery was fast,whereas in HL it was slow.Under all light levels (LL,ML,HL) in the samples tip,NPQ recovered rapidly and completely to 0.This indicates highly efficient restoration in the tip,but not in the middle and base where photodamage may be occurring. (4) Under ambient light levels pigment content was higher in the tip than that in the middle and base,and Chlorophyll a contents were higher than carotenoid in the tip,which was contrary in the middle and base. (5) The specific growth rate values relative to position on the algae were as follows:tip>middle>base (P<0.05) ,indicating fast organic matter accumulation in the tip.It was observed that in increased temperature conditions,small gaps which formed in the narrow leaf tip developed into vesicles.This suggests that temperature is the main inducing factor for the formation of vesicles.The results of this study suggest that photosynthetic rate,growth rate,and recovery capability in the tip of juvenile S.thunbergii may be higher than those in the middle and base.			为比较研究鼠尾藻直立枝的顶端、中部和基部光合器官对光能的光合响应机理以及3个部位生长速率与光合作用的联系,用液相氧电极和叶绿素荧光仪分别测定3个部位的净光合放氧速率、暗呼吸速率、快速光曲线、荧光暗弛豫参数;通过培养,比较了3个部位的比生长速率,观察了气囊的产生过程。结果显示,(1)顶端净光合放氧速率和暗呼吸速率显著高于中部与基部(P<0.05)。(2)低光(LL)适应后,叶片重新启动光合作用需要一定的时间,立即照光将会产生光抑制。中光(ML)适应下,叶片光化学反应与热耗散处于平衡态。高光(HL)适应下,叶片实际电子传递速率ETR接近最大值ETR_(max),非光化学淬灭(NPQ)显著升高,顶端与中部ETR_(max)显著高于基部(P<0.05)。(3)LL、ML适应后,叶片暗弛豫较快,HL适应后,暗弛豫较慢。顶端NPQ恢复较快并能完全恢复至0,说明顶端光修复能力较强;而于中、基部较慢且不能恢复至0,表明存在光损伤。(4)顶端色素含量高于中、基部;顶端叶绿素a含量高于类胡萝卜素,而中、基部类胡萝卜素含量高于叶绿素a。(5)3个部位比生长速率为顶端>中部>基部(P<0.05),说明顶端生长最旺盛,有机物质积累较快。狭形叶前端可以裂开形成囊腔,并最终形成气囊,推测温度是主要诱导因素。研究表明,顶端光合作用速率、生长速率和光损伤后的修复能力均高于中、基部。						0	1	0	0	0	0	1			1000-0615			CSCD:5249845

Namely, different spallation schemes predict sharply different trends for the growth of LiBeB abundances with respect to oxygen. "Primary" mechanisms predict BeB proportional to O and are well motivated by the data if O/Fe is constant at low metallicity. In contrast, "secondary" mechanisms predict BeB proportional to O-2 and are consistent with the data if O/Fe increases toward low metallicity as some recent data suggest. Clearly, any primary mechanism, if operative, will dominate early in the history of the Galaxy. In this paper, we fit the BeB data to a two-component scheme which includes both primary and secondary trends. In this way, the data can be used to probe the period in which primary mechanisms are effective. We analyze the data using consistent stellar atmospheric parameters based on Balmer line data and the continuum infrared flux. Results depend sensitively on Population II O abundances (and O/Fe trends), which have recently seen renewed interest. We explore the implications of these results phenomenologically, using a systematic and consistent compilation and fitting of BeBOFe data. Two-component Be-O fits indicate that primary and secondary components contribute equally at [O/H](eq) = -1.8 for Balmer line data; and [O/H](eq) = -1.4 to -1.8 for IRFM. We apply these constraints to recent models for LiBeB origin. The Balmer line data do not show any evidence for primary production. On the other hand, the IRFM data do indicate a preference for a two-component model, such as a combination of standard GCR and metal-enriched particles accelerated in superbubbles. These conclusions rely on a detailed understanding of the abundance data including systematic effects which may alter the derived O-Fe and BeB-Fe relations.									42	0	0	0	0	0	42			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000089650800027

Porous carbon paper was simultaneously impregnated with the catalysts during synthesis and used as air electrodes for Zn-air batteries. ZnMnOx/N-CNT catalysts had the best ORR performance in half-cell LSV experiments with a more positive onset potential than that of Pt-Ru/C (-0.067 V and -0.078 V vs Hg/HgO, respectively). ZCFO/N-CNT catalysts had the best activity towards OER among the Zn-based oxide catalysts in half-cell linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) testing with an onset potential of 0.62 V vs Hg/HgO. Round-trip efficiencies from battery rate tests at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) were 55.3 %, 57.5 %, 58.7 %, and 58.3 % for ZnCoOx/N-CNT, ZnMnOx/N-CNT, ZMCO/N-CNT, and ZCFO/N-CNT, respectively. Bifunctional cycling of the catalysts was done in a homemade Zn-air battery at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for 200 cycles. The final round trip efficiencies for ZnCoOx/N-CNT, ZnMnOx/N-CNT, ZMCO/N-CNT, and ZCFO/N-CNT were 55.8 %, 56.6 %, 54.2 %, and 55.0 %, respectively. All catalysts except ZCFO/N-CNT compared favorably with Pt-Ru/C in terms of round-trip efficiency after cycling (55.3 %). Incorporation of Zn into the metal oxide particles showed improved catalytic activity for ZnCoOx/N-CNT and ZnMnOx/N-CNT compared with MnOx/N-CNT and CoOx/N-CNT catalysts prepared via the same technique.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2196-0216			WOS:000536495700011

Archaea have adapted to some of the most extreme environments known to support life, including highly oxidizing conditions. However, in comparison to bacteria and eukaryotes, relatively little is known about the biology and biochemistry of archaea in response to changing conditions and repair of oxidative damage. In this study transcriptome, proteome, and chemical reactivity analyses of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induced oxidative stress in Sulfolobus solfataricus (P2) were conducted. Microarray analysis of mRNA expression showed that 102 transcripts were regulated by at least 1.5 fold, 30 minutes after exposure to 30 mu M H2O2. Parallel proteomic analyses using two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), monitored more than 800 proteins 30 and 105 minutes after exposure and found that 18 had significant changes in abundance. A recently characterized ferritin-like antioxidant protein, DPSL, was the most highly regulated species of mRNA and protein, in addition to being post-translationally modified. As expected, a number of antioxidant related mRNAs and proteins were differentially regulated. Three of these, DPSL, superoxide dismutase, and peroxiredoxin were shown to interact and likely form a novel supramolecular complex for mitigating oxidative damage. A scheme for the ability of this complex to perform multi-step reactions is presented. Despite the central role played by DPSL, cells maintained a lower level of protection after disruption of the dpsl gene, indicating a level of redundancy in the oxidative stress pathways of S. solfataricus. This work provides the first "omics'' scale assessment of the oxidative stress response for an archeal organism and together with a network analysis using data from previous studies on bacteria and eukaryotes reveals evolutionarily conserved pathways where complex and overlapping defense mechanisms protect against oxygen toxicity.									60	0	0	0	52	0	60			1932-6203			WOS:000269970000002	19759909

Citric acid was employed as a structure-mediated agent to guide the oriented growth of LaPO4 along [101] facet at room temperature, showing the urchin-like 3D structure. Furthermore, Pd and Ag3PO4 were coated in turn resulting in the Ag3PO4/Pd/LaPO4 nanocomposite, in which Pd and Ag3PO4 could act as the functions of electron receptor and electron donor in the photocatalysis, respectively. It was discovered that the as-developed nanocomposite could present the robust photocatalysis and stable morphology after consecutive uses. Based on the band structure analysis, a Z-scheme system of Ag3PO4/Pd/LaPO4 was thereby proposed for the sunlight photocatalysis, as testified by DMPO spin trapping ESR spectra. Also, the photoluminescence and electrochemical impedance of nanocomposites were conducted, indicating that the improved carriers properties should be responsible mainly for the dramatically enhanced photocatalytic activities. Moreover, the outstanding photocatalytic performances of Ag3PO4/Pd/LaPO4 were demonstrated in H-2 evolution (1084.3 mu mol.g(-1).h(-1)) under sunlight. Importantly, such a citric acid-controlled self-assembly route may pave the way toward the fabrication of multi-component photocatalyst tailored for the wide photocatalytic applications.									12	1	0	0	0	0	11			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000487849800025

However, catalysts that work well at high current densities with ultrafast intrinsic activities is still the central challenge for hydrogen evolution. An ideal case is to use single atoms on monolayer two-dimensional (2D) materials, which simplifies the system and in turn benefits the mechanism study, but is a grand challenge to synthesize. Here, we report a universal cold hydrogen plasma reduction method for synthesizing different single atoms sitting on 2D monolayers. In the case of molybdenum disulfide, we design and identify a type of active site, i.e., unsaturated Mo single atoms on cogenetic monolayer molybdenum disulfide. The catalyst shows exceptional intrinsic activity with a Tafel slope of 36.4 mV dec(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and superior performance at a high current density of 400 mA cm(-2) with an overpotential of similar to 260 mV, based on single flake microcell measurements. Theoretical studies indicate that coordinately unsaturated Mo single atoms sitting on molybdenum disulfide increase the bond strength between adsorbed hydrogen atoms and the substrates through hybridization, leading to fast hydrogen adsorption/desorption kinetics and superior hydrogen evolution activity. This work shines fresh light on preparing highly efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting and other electrochemical processes, as well as provides a general method to synthesize single atoms on two-dimensional monolayers.									80	6	0	0	7	0	80			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000510531500067	31834778

Specifically, they could not only enlarge the work function of co-catalyst component to provide a greater driving force for accelerating carriers' intercomponent separation, but also act as the electronic tunnels and thus switch contact mode from Schottky contact to analogous ohmic contact to eliminate the interfacial electrons transfer resistance originated from the Schottky barrier in semiconductor/conductor interface. Besides, they could also regulate the electronic configuration of co-catalyst to lower the H-2 evolution overpotential of the photocatalyst system. The synergy of Zn0.5Cd0.5S, Mo2C and interfacial Au endows (Mo2C/Au)@Zn0.5Cd0.5S a soaring photocatalytic H-2 evolution performance. The corresponding rate of H-2 production reaches up to 21.819 mmol h(-1) g(-1) under visible light irradiation, which is about 28.9 times higher than that of Zn0.5Cd0.5S, even 2.7 times as high as that of Mo2C@Zn0.5Cd0.5S. The designed model structure takes full advantage of the synergy between components and interfaces via modulating interfacial structure at the atomic scale, which provides a new idea for systematically optimizing semiconductors, co-catalysts and interfaces toward efficient solar to energy conversion.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000612470000040

We present a liquid water fed polymer electrolyte water electrolyzer cell operated at a cell temperature of 100 degrees C in comparison to a cell operated at state-of-the-art operation temperature of 60 degrees C over a 300 h constant current period. The hydrogen conversion efficiency increases by up to 5% at elevated temperature and makes green hydrogen cheaper. However, temperature is a stress factor that accelerates degradation causes in the cell. The PEWE cell operated at a cell temperature of 100 degrees C shows a 5 times increased cell voltage loss rate compared to the PEWE cell at 60 degrees C. The initial performance gain was found to be consumed after a projected operation time of 3,500 h. Elevated temperature operation is only viable if a voltage loss rate of less than 5.8 mu V h(-1) can be attained. The major degradation phenomena that impact performance loss at 100 degrees C are ohmic (49%) and anode kinetic losses (45%). Damage to components was identified by post-test electron-microscopic analysis of the catalyst coated membrane and measurement of cation content in the drag water. The chemical decomposition of the ionomer increases by a factor of 10 at 100 degrees C vs 60 degrees C. Failure by short circuit formation was estimated to be a failure mode after a projected lifetime 3,700 h. At elevated temperature and differential pressure operation hydrogen gas cross-over is limiting since a content of 4% hydrogen in oxygen represents the lower explosion limit.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000640598500001

However, its activity is moderate because of the sluggish electron transfer and insufficient light absorption. Here, a series of hydroxyl carbon quantum dots modified with fiber-like carbon nitride composites (OH-CQDs/CNF) were synthesized by a solvothermal approach to enhance the photocatalytic activity. Compared to g-C3N4, the prepared OH-CQDs/CNF exhibited significantly improved visible light absorption (UV-VIS), low recombination electron-hole pairs (PL), and dramatically enhanced conductivity (EIS). Therefore, the optimized OH-CQDs/CNF-4 composite (derived from 4 mL OH-CQDs) displayed excellent photodegradation activity, and its rate constant for tetracycline degradation was 11.3 times higher than that in the presence of g-C3N4, even higher than some noble metal or metal oxides modified g-C3N4. In addition, OH-CQDs/ CNF-4 rendered around 4 times H-2 evolution rate than CNF, mainly because the OH-CQDs were highly dispersed on the CNF surface and formed an intact interface through hydrogen bond interactions. Quenching experiments and ESR results indicated that center dot O-2(-) and h(+) were the main free radicals generated during TC degradation. This study provides guidance for the design of hydrogen bonding-based metal-free photocatalysts for wastewater purification and hydrogen evolution.									13	2	0	0	3	0	13			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000486177700006

As the good candidate to generate hydrogen under visible light irradiation, the rapid charge recombination and easy photocorrosion of pure CdS nanomaterials limited its hydrogen generation activity and photocatalytic stability. Here we constructed a novel ternary Z-scheme CdS-Ag-TiO2 composite based on CdS nanowires by a three-step process to solve this problem. Compared with CdS-TiO2 and CdS, the Z-scheme CdS-Ag-TiO2 composites could obviously extend the light-absorption region, accelerate the transfer rate of charge-separation, and possess stronger redox capability. The prepared Z-scheme CdS-Ag-TiO2 composites show high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 1.91 mmol h(-1) g(-1), which is 1.50 and 2.45 times that of CdS-TiO2 heterojunction and pure CdS nanowires. The Z-scheme photocatalytic system exhibits the synergetic effects due to more efficient charge transfer and surface plasmon resonance absorption. Ag nanoparticles used as electron mediator could decrease the recombination of the photocarriers, alter the path of charge transfer and suppress the photocorrosion. This work opens up a new way for the novel Z-scheme photocatalytic systems that suppress the photocorrosion of CdS, and has a promising application in the photocatalytic water splitting.

The crystal columns consist of many small grains. Oxygen penetrates deep into the film through large voids between the columns perpendicular to the substrate. Films grown with low hydrogen dilution (Poly2) showed device quality (purely intrinsic nature, only (220) oriented growth) but with an incubation phase during which amorphous initial growth takes place. The presence of only 2000 cm(-1) IR vibration and a high temperature hydrogen evolution (similar to 600 OC) proves the compact structure which inhibits oxygen incorporation ([O]=5x10(18) cm(-3) from SIMS) into the film. A new approach was used to integrate these two growth regimes to make profiled poly-Si layers in which a Polyl layer of fixed thickness acts as a seed layer, on top of which the Poly2 is deposited. The top layer selectively grows along the (220) direction even though the grains in the seed layer are randomly oriented, The top layer is compact with V shaped columns consisting of twinned grains with a height approaching the layer thickness. A sharp reduction in void content is observed at the transition from seed layer to top layer. The profiled films show complete absence of amorphous incubation phase.Cells incorporating the profiled poly-Si:H films were made on stainless steel substrates in the configuration SS/n-mu c-Si:H(PECVD)/i-poly-Si:H(HWCVD)/p-mu c-Si:H(PECVD)/ITO. An efficiency of 4.41% and a FF of 0.607 have been achieved. A current density of 19.95 mA/cm(2) is generated with an only similar to 1.22 mu m thick i-layer which was deposited at a rate of more than 5 Angstrom/s.									31	0	0	0	0	0	31			1012-0394			WOS:000081387400069

Our study demonstrates the key role of water molecules as shuttles to deliver protons to the cobalt active centers of these catalysts. However, the transfer of protons to the cobalt centersrfl also competes with the diffusion of the proton away from the complex via the hydrogen bond network of water. Protons were found to react with the oxygen of the side group of Co(dmgH)(2), while a similar reaction was not observed for Co(dmgBF(2))(2). This explains the experimentally observed relative-instability of CO(dmgH)(2) in the acidic medium, The rate-limiting step of the hydrogen-procluchig process was found to be the first proton transfer to the cobalt center for both cobaloxime complexes. Structural and electron population analysis was carried out to provide insight into the origin of the difference of the proton transfer free-energy barriers of these two cobalt complexs. Our study has contributed to the key microscopic understanding of the hydrogen-producing process by this class of catalysts.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000401402800018	28429940	
J	Seidel, G. E., Jr.				Seidel, George/AAE-2371-2019				Maintaining integrity of germline DNA: individuals age, species do not								REPRODUCTION FERTILITY AND DEVELOPMENT				27	6	SI		865	871		10.1071/RD14514				2015	2015	All life forms are under constant assault, resulting in an accumulation of damage within each individual, in both somatic and germline cells. The obvious causes are: (1) mutations from radiation, chemical reactions like peroxidation and errors in replicating genetic material; (2) injury due to environmental insults, such as chemical alteration of proteins by reactive oxygen species; (3) epigenetic errors, such as failure of appropriate maintenance methylation of cytosines of DNA; and (4) numerous other problems, including retroviral invasions, inflammation and unhealthy microbiomes. Collectively, these phenomena constitute aging and/or certain disease states. Nature has developed numerous mechanisms to counteract these problems, such as proofreading enzymes, ubiquitous antioxidants and apoptotic death of unfit cells. However, none of these is completely effective. Although individuals accumulate damage, species usually do not become increasingly damaged; however, this could be one of the mechanisms for eventual extinction or evolution to a different species, the apparent fate of essentially all species. Nevertheless, germline DNA appears to remain sufficiently pristine to maintain fairly stable phenotypes over many generations. How do species avoid accumulating damage when composed of individuals that do? One broad answer seems to be reproductive redundancy followed by elimination of defects through the death of gametes, embryos, fetuses, neonates and postpubertal individuals, with the culling pressure increasing as potential parents age. Another major force appears to be evolutionary pressure; individuals that best fit the environment out-reproduce those that fit less well. What is impressive is that older and older parents continue to have offspring that are nearly as pristine as those of younger parents, even though their germline cells have continued to age. Although the offspring of old parents are not as fit, on average, as those of young parents, differences are small and, in some species, compensated for by superior parenting with accumulated experience. To conclude, it appears that species do not age, even though they are composed of individuals whose somatic and germline cells have aged.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			1031-3613	1448-5990		WOS:000357876800001	25786538

The structures of the nanocale oxide particles, which were extracted from the mechanical alloying (MA)/ODS steels by chemical extraction and comprised of yttrium titanium and oxygen, have been studied by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis to explore the formation mechanism of nanoparticles during the consolidation processes of ODS steels. The observations of structure of nanoscale oxide particles in both ODS steels after mechanical milling indicate that integrated and ordered Y2O3 crystals get fractured by severe plastic deformation and nanocrystals and amorphous phase of Y2O3 mixed with titanium (Ti) are formed during mechanical milling. HRTEM observations of partially amorphous oxide nanoparticles and nanoscale oxide particles with a structure characterized by crystalline domain where some amorphous domains with banded shape (1 similar to 1.5 nm) are distributed inside after HIP process gain an insight into the formation mechanism of nanoscale oxide particles in the process of heating. The formation mechanism involves reaction between Y2O3 fragments and titanium (Ti) and crystallization of [YMO](amorphous).									4	2	0	0	0	0	5			1947-2935			WOS:000310119500012

In-situ co-doping strategy of pyrrolic N/Zn was proposed to enhance surface charge separation and cycling stability of MIL-125(Ti) for degradation of vaporous acetaldehyde under highly humid conditions. Characterizations results show that pyrrolic N/Zn co-doped MIL-125(Ti) exhibited an integrated crystal structure and high surface area (1415 m(2)/g). The constructed Ti/Zn-N/O clusters narrowed band gap (from 3.40 to 1.85 eV) of MIL-125(Ti) and boosted electron conductivity. Also, it was proved to enhance surface alkalinity and hydrophobicity of MIL-125(Ti), which would strengthen MOFs selective adsorption towards CH3CHO and accelerated the transfer of degradation product CO2 from catalytic active sites in MIL-125(Ti) under high humidity. As a result, synergistic effect of N/Zn co-doping exhibited an enhanced the ability of activating oxygen and H2O molecules into superoxide radical (O-center dot(2)-) and hydroxy radical ((OH)-O-center dot), showing 10 times faster reaction kinetics for CH3CHO degradation under humid air compared to MIL-125(Ti). Moreover, co-dopant of N/Zn into MIL-125(Ti) has significantly promoted the recycling stability of MIL-125(Ti) under high humidity. According to the work, co-dopant elemental strategy to modify MOF surface can provide the synergistic effect for efficient degradation of aldehyde VOCs under humid conditions.									42	2	0	0	12	0	42			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000545646800079

Keevil, Charles/0000-0003-1917-7706			Mechanism of copper surface toxicity in Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella involves immediate membrane depolarization followed by slower rate of DNA destruction which differs from that observed for Gram-positive bacteria								ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY				14	7			1730	1743		10.1111/j.1462-2920.2011.02677.x				JUL 2012	2012	We have reported previously that copper I and II ionic species, and superoxide but not Fenton reaction generated hydroxyl radicals, are important in the killing mechanism of pathogenic enterococci on copper surfaces. In this new work we determined if the mechanism was the same in non-pathogenic ancestral (K12) and laboratory (DH5a) strains, and a pathogenic strain (O157), of Escherichia coli. The pathogenic strain exhibited prolonged survival on stainless steel surfaces compared with the other E. coli strains but all died within 10 min on copper surfaces using a dry inoculum protocol (with approximately 107 cfu cm-2) to mimic dry touch contamination. We observed immediate cytoplasmic membrane depolarization, not seen with enterococci or methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and loss of outer membrane integrity, inhibition of respiration and in situ generation of reactive oxygen species on copper and copper alloy surfaces that did not occur on stainless steel. Chelation of copper (I) and (II) ionic species still had the most significant impact on bacterial survival but protection by d-mannitol suggests hydroxyl radicals are involved in the killing mechanism. We also observed a much slower rate of DNA destruction on copper surfaces compared with previous results for enterococci. This may be due to protection of the nucleic acid by the periplasm and the extensive cell aggregation that we observed on copper surfaces. Similar results were obtained for Salmonella species but partial quenching by d-mannitol suggests radicals other than hydroxyl may be involved. The results indicate that copper biocidal surfaces are effective for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria but bacterial morphology affects the mechanism of toxicity. These surfaces could not only help to prevent infection spread but also prevent horizontal gene transmission which is responsible for the evolution of virulent toxin producing and antibiotic resistant bacteria.									156	7	0	0	85	1	161			1462-2912	1462-2920		WOS:000305904500012	22176893

Herein, a tandem 0D/2D/2D NbS(2)quantum dot/Nb(2)O(5)nanosheet/g-C(3)N(4)flake (NSNOCN) system is designed. Owing to the unique spatial-arrangement and elaborate morphology of 0D NbS2, 2D Nb2O5, and 2D g-C(3)N(4)in the newly designed NSNOCN, plenty of spatial charge-transfer cascades from g-C(3)N(4)to NbS(2)via Nb(2)O(5)are formed to accelerate separation and transfer of charges significantly, thus contributing to a high photocatalytic H(2)generation rate of 13.99 mmol h(-1)g(-1)(an apparent quantum efficiency of 10.8% at 420 nm), up to 107.6 and 43.7 times by contrast with that of g-C(3)N(4)and Nb2O5, respectively. This work can provide a new platform in the design of artificial photocatalytic systems with high charge-transfer efficiency.									28	5	0	0	0	0	27			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000572068200001	32969149

It is increasingly evident that the rational design of photocatalysts for efficient water splitting must employ hybrid systems, where the different components perform light harvesting, charge separation and catalysis in tandem. In this topical review, we report on the recent development of a new class of hybrid photocatalysts that employs MxV(2)O(5) (M = p-block cation) nanowires in order to engineer efficient charge transfer from the photoactive chalcogenide quantum dots (QDs) to the water-splitting and hydrogen evolving catalysts. Herein, we summarize the oxygen-mediated lone pair mechanism used to modulate the energy level and orbital character of mid-gap states in the MxV(2)O(5) nanowires. The electronic structure of MxV(2)O(5) is discussed in terms of density functional theory and hard x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES) measurements. The principles of HAXPES are explained within the context of its unique sensitivity to metal 5(6)s orbitals and ability to non-destructively study buried interface alignments of quantum dot decorated nanowires i.e., MxV(2)O(5)/CdX (X = S, Se, Te). We illustrate with examples how the MxV(2)O(5)/CdX band alignments can be rationally engineered for ultra-fast charge-transfer of photogenerated holes from the quantum dot to the nanowires; thereby suppressing anodic photo-corrosion in the CdX QDs and enabling efficacious hydrogen evolution.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			2516-1075			WOS:000605751400002

The Sn and N co-doped TiO2 (SNT-x) photocatalysts were successfully prepared by the facile sol-gel method and the post-nitridation route in the temperature range of 400-550 degrees C. All the as-prepared samples were characterized in detail by X-ray diffraction, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron and electron spin resonance spectroscopy and photoelectrochemical measurements. The characterization results reveal that the co-incorporation of Sn and N atoms remarkably modifies the electronic structure of TiO2, which gives rise to a prominent separation of photogenerated charge carriers and more efficient interfacial charge-transfer reactions in a photocatalytic process. The enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the intensified active oxygen species including hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) and superoxide anion radicals (O-2(center dot-)) for degradation of organic pollutants. And the result of photocatalytic hydrogen production further confirms the existence of the synergistic effect in the SNT-x samples, because they exhibit higher photocatalytic activity than the sum of N/TiO2 and Sn/TiO2. This work provides a paradigm to consolidate the understanding of the synergistic effect of metal and non-metal co-doped TiO2 in domains of photocatalysis and photoelectrochemistry.									58	6	0	0	7	0	61			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000373570200039	26996319

Groundwater displays a marked increase in total dissolved solids (TDS; 200 to 1600 mg/l) through the sulphide zone (84-89 m in depth). Groundwater ranges from low TDS CaHCO3-type water at shallow depth to higher TDS CaSO4-type water within the massive sulphides. The massive sulphides are coincident with a large SP anomaly mV) compared to the host rocks with an associated Positive temperature anomaly of 0.05 degrees C. With increasing depth through the massive sulphide zone, base metal (Cu, Zn, Mo, Pb, Cd) and Fe concentrations increase (e.g. Fe increases from 40 to 2300 mg/l). Stable isotopic compositions in groundwater also vary with depth in the sulphide zone with delta O-18(VSMOW) increasing from - 12.32 to - 12.00 parts per thousand and delta C-13(VPDB) from - 13.55 to - 10.31 parts per thousand. The stable isotopes, TDS and straddle-packer recovery time data indicate that groundwater flow is greatest in the upper parts of the massive sulphides.The large SP anomaly is interpreted to result from decoupled sulphide oxidation occurring between oxygenated waters impacted by the borehole and non-pyritic sulphide phases within the sulphide mass. Electrons pass from sulphide phases (e.g. pyrrhotite) through intervening pyrite to dissolved oxygen in the borehole, which renders a cathodic character to the wall of the borehole and an anodic character to the interior of -:he sulphide. The higher hydraulic conductivity of the upper massive sulphide has allowed penetration of dissolved oxygen, which produces a similarly decoupled oxidation reaction between the upper and lower sulphides, at least proximal to the borehole. The increasingly anodic nature of the sulphide mass with increasing depth is demonstrated by the chemical evolution of groundwater with depth, Increasing SO42, H+, Fe2+ and Zn2+ concentrations arc evidence of the oxidation reactions occurring in deeper sulphides, whereas the higher pH in the upper massive sulphide is evidence of O-2 reduction. Increased (51 with depth probably results from enhanced carbonate mineral dissolution as acid is produced. The unusual positive temperature anomaly associated with the borehole may be partly a result of exothermic oxidation of the sulphide but is more likely due to the higher thermal conductivity of massive sulphide relative to country rock. The sulphide appears to be acting as a conduit for heat from deeper areas, which suggests that a large sulphide mass extends beneath the intersected section.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1467-7873	2041-4943		WOS:000263218100004

Here we present observations of the oxygen-17 excess of PM2.5 sulfate (Delta O-17(SO42-)) collected in Beijing haze from October 2014 to January 2015 to constrain possible sulfate formation pathways. Through-out the sampling campaign, the 12-hourly averaged PM2.5 concentrations ranged from 16 to 323 mu g m(-3) with a mean of (141 +/- 88 (1 sigma)) mu g m(-3), with SO42- representing 8-25% of PM2.5 mass. The observed Delta O-17(SO42-) varied from 0.1 to 1.6% with a mean of (0.9 +/- 0.3) %. Delta O-17(SO42-) increased with PM2.5 levels in October 2014 while the opposite trend was observed from November 2014 to January 2015. Our estimate suggested that in-cloud reactions dominated sulfate production on polluted days (PDs, PM2.5 >= 75 mu g m(-3)) of Case II in October 2014 due to the relatively high cloud liquid water content, with a fractional contribution of up to 68 %. During PDs of Cases I and III-V, heterogeneous sulfate production (Phet) was estimated to contribute 41-54% to total sulfate formation with a mean of (48 +/- 5) %. For the specific mechanisms of heterogeneous oxidation of SO2, chemical reaction kinetics calculations suggested S(IV) (= SO2 center dot H2O + HSO3- + SO32-) oxidation by H2O2 in aerosol water accounted for 5-13% of P-het. The relative importance of heterogeneous sulfate production by other mechanisms was constrained by our observed Delta O-17(SO42-). Heterogeneous sulfate production via S(IV) oxidation by O-3 was estimated to contribute 21-22% of P-het on average. Heterogeneous sulfate production pathways that result in zero-Delta O-17(SO42-), such as S(IV) oxidation by NO2 in aerosol water andor by O-2 via a radical chain mechanism, contributed the remaining 66-73% of P-het. The assumption about the thermodynamic state of aerosols (stable or metastable) was found to significantly influence the calculated aerosol pH (7.6 +/- 0.1 or 4.7 +/- 1.1, respectively), and thus influence the relative importance of heterogeneous sulfate production via S(IV) oxidation by NO2 and by O-2. Our local atmospheric conditions-based calculations suggest sulfate formation via NO2 oxidation can be the dominant pathway in aerosols at high-pH conditions calculated assuming stable state while S(IV) oxidation by O-2 can be the dominant pathway providing that highly acidic aerosols (pH <= 3) exist. Our local atmospheric-conditions-based calculations illustrate the utility of Delta O-17(SO42-) for quantifying sulfate formation pathways, but this estimate may be further improved with future regional modeling work.									55	3	0	0	17	0	57			1680-7316	1680-7324		WOS:000430738100003

The oxide growth and the evolution of the oxide structure as a function of time and temperature were studied with suitable time resolution. Oxide layer thicknesses of approximately 10 mu m were formed during the experiments. The incident X-rays penetrated the whole oxide thickness. The samples were examined after the experiments by field emission gun scanning electron microscopy, electron backscatter diffraction and electron-probe microanalysis. The results showed that the oxide contains a mixture of monoclinic and tetragonal zirconia evolving during heating, oxidation and cooling. The average volume fraction of tetragonal zirconia decreases during oxidation. This fraction is larger at 900 degrees C than at 700 and 800 degrees C. For oxide layers thinner than approximately 5 mu m, this fraction is larger at 800 degrees C than at 700 degrees C, but it is rather equivalent for both temperatures when the oxide thickness ranges between 5 and 8 mu m. Some of the tetragonal zirconia crystals transforms into the monoclinic phase during cooling after oxidation. This fraction of transformed tetragonal zirconia is larger after oxidation at 900 degrees C than after oxidation at 700 and 800 degrees C. It is suggested that these evolutions of the oxide crystallographic structure are related to micro-stresses and to temperature dependences of the critical size of zirconia crystals below which tetragonal zirconia is stabilized.									7	1	0	0	0	0	8			1044-5803	1873-4189		WOS:000503314000031

A series of carbon supported Pt-Ni alloy electrocatalysts were synthesized under different applied electrode potentials. Among all as-obtained samples, the Pt-Ni/C electrocatalyst deposited at -1.73 V exhibits the optimal specific activity up to 1.850 mA cm(-2) at 0.9 V vs. RHE, which is 6.85 times higher than that of the commercial Pt/C. Comprehensive physiochemical characterizations and computational evaluations via density functional theory were conducted to unveil the nucleation and growth mechanism of PtNi alloy formation. Compared to the aqueous solution, DMF solvent molecule must not be neglected in avoiding particle agglomeration and synthesis of monodispersed nanoparticles. During the alloy co-deposition process, Ni sites produced through the reduction of Ni(II) precursor not only facilitates Pt-Ni alloy crystal nucleation but also in favor of further Pt reduction on the Ni-inserted Pt surface. As for the deposition potential, it adjusts the final particle size. This work provides a hopeful extended Pt-based catalyst layer production strategy for proton exchange membrane fuel cells and a new idea for the nucleation and growth mechanism exploration for electrodeposited Pt alloy.

Synthesized materials were characterized using spectroscopic, optical and microscopic techniques and confirm transforming TO from orthorhombic to hexagonal phase (d) upon anchoring with NRGO. TO@NRGO, TO and NRGO have been evaluated for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, degradation of Methylene blue (MB) and Rhodamine B (RhB). The enhanced photocatalytic activity was observed in TO@NRGO nanocomposite compared to TO and NRGO due to decreased bandgap (2.5 eV) and increased surface area (312 m(2) g(-1)). TO@NRGO evolved 19,500 mmol g(-1) of hydrogen for 3 h. TO@NRGO showed better degradation efficiency of 94 and 88% at a time of 100 min for MB and RhB, respectively. The parameters involved in photocatalytic dye degradation, like the effect of pH, catalyst dosage, and initial concentration of dyes, have been carefully optimized to achieve maximum performance of the catalyst. The stability and reusability of TO@NRGO are good and managed to degrade dyes effectively even after the 5th run. Thus, TO@NRGO could serve as a choice of material in resolving the issues related to energy and the environment. (c) 2021 The Society of Powder Technology Japan.

ROS are highly reactive molecules that can either endanger cell homeostasis or mediate cell signaling in several physiological pathways, including the immune response. Thioredoxin (Trx) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) are the essential components of the thioredoxin system, one of the main intracellular redox systems and are therefore important regulators of ROS accumulation. Through the regulation of the intracellular redox milieu, the thioredoxin system plays a key role within the immune system, linking immunology and free radical science. In this study we have firstly identified TrxRs in fish and used this new sequence information to reevaluate the evolution of the thioredoxin system within the vertebrate lineage. We next measured the expression of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) Trx and TrxR transcripts during infection in vivo and in vitro after stimulation of a macrophage cell line and primary macrophage cultures with pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Our results showed that both Trx and TrxR were induced during infection at the transcriptional level, confirming their likely involvement in the innate immune response of fish. Since TrxRs are selenium-containing proteins (selenoproteins), we also measured the modulation of their expression upon organic and inorganic selenium exposure in vitro. TrxR was found to be responsive to selenium exposure in vitro, suggesting that it may represent a key mediator in the selenium modulation of innate immunity.

Cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s) are valuable biocatalysts due to their ability to hydroxylate unactivated carbon atoms using molecular oxygen. P450s catalyze reactions using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAD(P)H) cofactor and electron transfer proteins. Alternatively, P450s can utilize hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as an oxidant, but this pathway is inefficient. P450s that show higher efficiency with peroxides are sought after in industrial applications. P450s from thermophilic organisms have more potential applications as they are stable toward high temperature, high and low pH, and organic solvents. CYP119 is an acidothermophilic P450 from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius. In our previous study, a novel T213R/T214I (double mutant [DM]) variant of CYP119 was obtained by screening a mutant library for higher peroxidation activity utilizing H2O2. Here, we characterized the substrate scope; stability toward peroxides; and temperature and organic solvent tolerance of DM CYP119 to identify its potential as an industrial biocatalyst. DM CYP119 displayed higher stability than wild-type (WT) CYP119 toward organic peroxides. It shows higher peroxidation activity for non-natural substrates and higher affinity for progesterone and other bioactive potential substrates compared to WT CYP119. DM CYP119 emerges as a new biocatalyst with a wide range of potential applications in the pharmaceutical and chemical industry.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0885-4513	1470-8744		WOS:000692846900001	34431570

Herein, the 2D/2D Co-3(PO4)(2)/g-C3N4 heterojunctions were successfully synthesized for overall water splitting from pure water by a simple direct precipitation route under the effect of coulomb electrostatic interaction. The introduction of Co-3(PO4)(2) nanosheets broadens the light absorption range of Co-3(PO4)(2)/g-C3N4 heterojunction, and in addition, the unusual 2D/2D heterostructure can provide more contact areas to promote the interfacial charge transfer between g-C3N4 nanosheets and Co-3(PO4)(2) nanosheets, which considerably enhances the photogenerated charge separation. Among the Co-3(PO4)(2)/g-C3N4 heterojunctions, 35% Co-3(PO4)(2)/gC(3)N(4) exhibits the optimal H-2 and O-2 evolution rates which are 375.6 and 177.4 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), respectively. Moreover, the apparent quantum efficiency of the 35% Co-3(PO4)(2)/g-C3N4 reaches up to 1.32% at 420 nm. Furthermore, the 2D/2D Co-3(PO4)(2)/g-C3N4 composite possesses the prominent stability and recyclability, testifying a potential application for the conversion of the sustainable energy.									135	8	0	0	21	0	135			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000503381200102

A factorial design methodology was implemented to evaluate the statistically important operating parameters, amongst initial COD load (1000-5000 mg/L), treatment time (1-4 h), current intensity (10-20 A), initial pH (4-6) and the use of 500 mg/L H2O2 as an additional oxidant, on treatment efficiency; the latter was assessed in terms of COD, phenols, aromatics and color removal. Of the five parameters tested, the first two had a considerable effect on COD removal. Hence, analysis was repeated at more intense conditions, i.e. initial COD values up to 10,000 mg/L and reaction times up to 7 h and a simple model was developed and validated to predict COD evolution profiles. The model suggests that the rate of COD degradation is zero order regarding its concentration and agrees well with an electrochemical model for the anodic oxidation of organics over BDD developed elsewhere. The treatability of the undiluted effluent (40,000 mg/L COD) was tested at 20 A for 15 h yielding 19% COD and 36% phenols' removal respectively with a specific energy consumption of 96 kW h/kg COD removed. Aerobic biodegradability and ecotoxicity assays were also performed to assess the respective effects of electrochemical treatment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Phase transformation is responsible for anisotropic volume change and pulverization in conjunction with an expansion of the pores and fissures, occurred dominantly at the outermost cathode particles where lithium ions are repeatedly diffused from parent structure to anode and vice versa. The gallium ion sources, in addition, penetrate into the vacuum and etch the particle in the vicinity of pores and fissures during the cross-sectioning process using focused ion beam. Herein, we propose a noble specimen preparation for high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) by employing epoxy to infiltrate into micropores. The epoxy can retain the agglomerate of cathode particles and avoid ion-beam-induced damage and contamination as well as suppress the side reactions with moisture and oxygen even after exposure to the air for a few months. The well-designed specimen preparation enables in-depth TEM investigation on the microstructure and phase transformation occurred severely at the outerrnost regions of porous cathode particles.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1044-5803	1873-4189		WOS:000483411900019

This work focuses on the formation of the heavy tars during pyrolysis of bio-oil at various temperatures and heating rates in a fixed-bed reactor. In order to investigate the detailed composition of the heavy tar, the bio-oil and tars were characterized with a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FT-ICR MS). Our results indicate that low temperature promotes the formation of heavy tars via the polymerization of bio-oil components, especially at slow heating rates, therein the condensed aromatics are formed via the polymerization of small aromatics with one or two rings. High temperature promotes the breakage of the oxygen-containing functional groups, meanwhile the highly condensed aromatics with more than 4 rings are formed at 800 degrees C via the strong secondary reactions (e.g. recombination), especially at fast heating rates.									27	4	0	0	3	0	30			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000454904100012

The aging mechanism and thermal properties of the phenolic resin during thermooxidative aging were described by thermogravimetry (TG)Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, attenuated total reflectance (ATR)FTIR spectroscopy, and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis. The results show that the C?N bond decomposed into ammonia and the dehydration condensation between the residual hydroxyl groups occurred during the thermooxidative aging. Because of the presence of oxygen, the m(e)thylene bridges were oxidized into carbonyl groups. After aging for 30 days, the mass loss ratio reached 4.50%. The results of weight change at high temperatures coincided with the results of TGFTIR spectroscopy and ATRFTIR spectroscopy. The glass-transition temperature (Tg) increased from 240 to 312 degrees C after thermooxidative aging for 30 days, which revealed the postcuring of phenolic resins. In addition, an empirical equation between the weight change ratio and Tg was obtained. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Cummins, Peter L.								The Coevolution of RuBisCO, Photorespiration, and Carbon Concentrating Mechanisms in Higher Plants								FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE				12						662425	10.3389/fpls.2021.662425				SEP 1 2021	2021	Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) is the carbon-fixing enzyme present in most photosynthetic organisms, converting CO2 into organic matter. Globally, photosynthetic efficiency in terrestrial plants has become increasingly challenged in recent decades due to a rapid increase in atmospheric CO2 and associated changes toward warmer and dryer environments. Well adapted for these new climatic conditions, the C-4 photosynthetic pathway utilizes carbon concentrating mechanisms to increase CO2 concentrations surrounding RuBisCO, suppressing photorespiration from the oxygenase catalyzed reaction with O-2. The energy efficiency of C-3 photosynthesis, from which the C-4 pathway evolved, is thought to rely critically on an uninterrupted supply of chloroplast CO2. Part of the homeostatic mechanism that maintains this constancy of supply involves the CO2 produced as a byproduct of photorespiration in a negative feedback loop. Analyzing the database of RuBisCO kinetic parameters, we suggest that in genera (Flaveria and Panicum) for which both C-3 and C-4 examples are available, the C-4 pathway evolved only from C-3 ancestors possessing much lower than the average carboxylase specificity relative to that of the oxygenase reaction (S-C/O=S-C/S-O), and hence, the higher CO2 levels required for development of the photorespiratory CO2 pump (C-2 photosynthesis) essential in the initial stages of C-4 evolution, while in the later stage (final optimization phase in the Flaveria model) increased CO2 turnover may have occurred, which would have been supported by the higher CO2 levels. Otherwise, C-4 RuBisCO kinetic traits remain little changed from the ancestral C-3 species. At the opposite end of the spectrum, C-3 plants (from Limonium) with higher than average S-C/O, which may be associated with the ability of increased CO2, relative to O-2, affinity to offset reduced photorespiration and chloroplast CO2 levels, can tolerate high stress environments. It is suggested that, instead of inherently constrained by its kinetic mechanism, RuBisCO possesses the extensive kinetic plasticity necessary for adaptation to changes in photorespiration that occur in the homeostatic regulation of CO2 supply under a broad range of abiotic environmental conditions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1664-462X			WOS:000697102000001	34539685

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and x-ray diffraction measurements were used for their structural characterization. These experiments have suggested that cointercalation of fluorine and VOF3 in the carbon occurs involving local structural modifications and that excess oxygen was present in the graphite layers. The study of electrochemical insertion of lithium was carried out at 25 degrees C in a LiClO4-propylene carbonate electrolyte by chronopotentiometry and ac impedance measurements. The interfacial charge-transfer process, associated to the half-reaction occurring during the intercalation, was found to be independent of the intercalation ratio of lithium cations, y. The chemical diffusion coefficient, (D) over tilde(Li), and the conductivity, sigma(Li), obtained were deduced from impedance data by considering the geometric surface area. Both are roughly constant for all the y-range: (D) over tilde(Li) = 3.8 x 10(-10) cm(2) s(-1) and sigma(Li) = 9.3 x cm 10(-7) Omega(-1) cm(-1) for C-17.7(VOF3)F; (D) over tilde D-Li = 4.5 x 10(-10) cm(2) s(-1) and sigma(Li) = 2.7 x 10(-7) Omega(-1) cm(-1) for C-20.4(VOF3)F.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0013-4651			WOS:A1996UY44500013

However, the poor thermostability of the current commercial GOD is a key limiting factor preventing its widespread application. In the present study, amino acids closely related to the thermostability of glucose oxidase from Penicillium notatum were predicted with a computer-aided molecular simulation analysis, and mutant libraries were established following a saturation mutagenesis strategy. Two mutants with significantly improved thermostabilities, S100A and D408W, were subsequently obtained. Their protein denaturing temperatures were enhanced by about 4.4 degrees C and 1.2 degrees C, respectively, compared with the wild-type enzyme. Treated at 55 degrees C for 3 h, the residual activities of the mutants were greater than 72%, while that of the wild-type enzyme was only 20%. The half-lives of S100A and D408W were 5.13- and 4.41-fold greater, respectively, than that of the wild-type enzyme at the same temperature. This work provides novel and efficient approaches for enhancing the thermostability of GOD by reducing the protein free unfolding energy or increasing the interaction of amino acids with the coenzyme.									19	4	0	0	12	0	21			1422-0067			WOS:000427527400109	29385094

In this study, a two-step nucleation method was used to investigate the behavior during the early stages of CaO inclusion crystallization. The first principles method was applied to calculate the structures and properties of CaO crystals and CaO clusters. Then, the nucleation mechanism of CaO in the Fe-O-Ca melt has been discussed. The numerical results show that CaO clusters with cubic structures and appropriate variations are the lowest energy structures and are more stable than other isomers. The stability of the cubic (CaO)(n) clusters increases with the increase in size and gradually approaches that of the CaO crystal. CaO clusters can form spontaneously in the Fe-O-Ca melt, while the transformation reaction of the CaO clusters in the Fe-O-Ca melt deeply depends on the supersaturation ratio of [Ca] and [O]. CaO clusters may remain as suspended CaO inclusions in the iron melt for a long time, and these suspensions of CaO clusters are the source of excess oxygen in the iron melt.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000473056500041	31211308	
J	Jiang, HX; Morgan, JA								Optimization of an in vivo plant P450 monooxygenase system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae								BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOENGINEERING				85	2			130	137		10.1002/bit.10867				JAN 20 2004	2004	Cytochrome P450s are heme-thiolate oxygenases involved in a wide number of reactions such as epoxidation, hydroxylation, and demethylation. Heterologously expressed eukaryotic P450s are potentially useful biocatalysts for stereospecific oxygenation reactions under mild conditions. Numerous factors, such as intracellular pH, cytochrome P450, cytochrome P450 reductase, NADPH, and oxygen concentration all influence the in vivo activity. To systematically examine these factors, we selected ferulate 5-hydroxylase (F5H), a plant P450, with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae WAT11 strain as an expression host. Two media compositions and two cultivation pro-cedures were investigated to optimize the in vivo activity of F5H. We modified a previously published selective growth medium (Pompon et al. [1996] Methods Enzymol 272: 51-64) that increased the specific growth rate and cell yield of the host strain. A cultivation procedure with separate growth and induction stages that each contained selective media resulted in a 45% increase of whole cell F5H specific activity. In a medium designed for simultaneous growth and induction, we observed a 2.6-fold higher specific F5H activity, but substantially lower cell yield. Surprisingly, in this medium the higher specific F5H activity did not correlate with a higher P450 concentration. The effects of addition of the first committed heme precursor, 6-aminolevulinic acid, and Fe(III) at the beginning of induction period were also studied for our two-stage procedure. A small, but significant (P < 0.05) increase in whole cell F5H activity was observed following ALA addition.

The hindrance is generally identified by the observation of a maximum of the S-factor vs energy. Whether there is an S-factor maximum at very low energies for systems with a positive fusion Q value is an experimentally challenging question.Purpose: Our aim has been to search for evidence of fusion hindrance in C-12 + (24)g which is a medium-light m system with positive Q value for fusion, besides the heavier cases where hindrance is recognized to be a general phenomenon. C-12 + (24)mg is very close to the O-16 + O-16 and C-12 + C-12 systems that are important for the late evolution of heavy stars.Methods: The experiment has been performed in inverse kinematics using the Mg-24 beam from the XTU Tandem accelerator of LNL in the energy range 26-52 MeV with an intensity of 4-8 pnA. The targets were C-12 evaporations 50 mu g/cm(2) thick, isotopically enriched to 99.9%. The fusion-evaporation residues were detected at small angles by a E-Delta E-ToF detector telescope following an electrostatic beam deflector.Results: Previous measurements of fusion cross section for C-1(2) + (24)g were limited to above-barrier energies. m In the present experiment the excitation function has been extended down to similar or equal to 15 mu b and it appears that the S factor develops a clear maximum vs energy, indicating the presence of hindrance. This is the first convincing evidence of an S factor maximum in a medium-light system with a positive fusion Q value. These results have been fitted following a recently suggested method and a detailed analysis within the coupled-channels model that has been performed using a Woods-Saxon potential and including the ground state rotational band of 24 Mg. The coupled-channels calculations give a good account of the data near and above the barrier but overpredict the cross sections at very low energies.Conclusions: The hindrance phenomenon is clearly observed in C-12 + Mg-24, and its energy threshold is in reasonable agreement with the systematics observed for several medium-light systems. The fusion cross sections at the hindrance threshold show that the highest value (sigma(s) = 1.6 mb) is indeed found for this system. Therefore it may even be possible to extend the measurements further down in energy to better establish the position of the S-factor maximum.									4	0	1	0	0	0	5			2469-9985	2469-9993		WOS:000526036200002

By optimizing the electrodeposition cycle times and electrolyte concentration, bimetallic Ag-Cu/TiO2 R/T-0.5 with moderate densities and sizes of Ag and Cu nanoparticles was fabricated and shows great photocatalytic potential, in which, Ag mainly facilitates the generation of hot electrons by absorbing visible light and Cu plays an important role in accelerating the separation and transportation of hot electrons. The hydrogen production rate was tested as 425 mu L h(-1) cm(-2), which is about 1.34-fold enhanced H2 production over TiO2 R/T. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations were made for analyzing the interface electrostatic properties between plasmonic nanoparticles of Ag or Cu and the semiconductor TiO2. It is calculated that bimetallic Ag-Cu/TiO2/H2O system has larger interfacial Helmholtz potential than monometallic Ag/TiO2/H2O, Cu/TiO2/H2O and pure TiO2/H2O systems, accelerating the four-electron reaction occurring at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. This research put forward a feasible and simple pulse electrodeposition method to fabricate bimetallic photoanodes for enhanced hydrogen evolution and an important analysis method of semiconductor/ metal/electrolyte interface characteristics.

The transformation process of each phase of the alloy is unique, where these phases differ in their structure, chemical composition, and nature of the reaction with oxygen. When the alloy is oxidised, the chemical composition of the phases changes continuously according to complex laws, depending on the environment, temperature, and duration of exposure. An intensive exchange of chemical elements occurs between different phases. After long-term, high-temperature operation of the alloy, the process of oxidation of the phases probably attains a steady limiting state.									3	0	4	0	0	0	6			1044-5803	1873-4189		WOS:000462420900019		
J	Zhang, Li-hong; Chen, San-feng								Pseudacidovorax intermedius NH-1, a novel marine nitrogen-fixing bacterium isolated from the South China Sea								WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY				28	9			2839	2847		10.1007/s11274-012-1093-3				SEP 2012	2012	We have taxonomically and phylogenetically characterized a novel nitrogen-fixing bacterial strain, NH-1, which was recently isolated from surface sediments of the South China Sea. The presence of the nifH gene was determined by PCR amplification. The strain NH-1 was found to belong to the genus Pseudacidovorax based on phenotypic characterization, 16S rDNA sequencing, G+C content and DNA-DNA hybridization. Isolate NH-1 was identified as Pseudacidovorax intermedius. In addition, we investigated the links between environmental factors and the nitrogenase activity of NH-1. We found that the nitrogen fixation capacity of NH-1 varied strongly when cells were grown with different ammonium ion and oxygen concentrations, amino acids and carbohydrates. This is the first report of the isolation of Pseudacidovorax from the ocean and the first study to explore the effects of different culture conditions on the nitrogenase activities of the isolate. This study provides evidence that marine nitrogen-fixing microorganisms are far more diverse than currently recognized.									5	3	0	0	4	0	8			0959-3993	1573-0972		WOS:000307305500007	22806723

However, labile olefins remain unexplored due to their incompatibility with harsh reaction conditions. Here, unprecedented light-induced oxidant and metal-free tandem radical cyclization-trifluoromethylation and dehydrogenative oxygenation of 1,6-enynes have been achieved using a photoredox catalyst, CF3SO2Na, and phenanthrene-9,10-dione (PQ), Langlois' reagent (CF3SO2Na) and water as the oxygen source. This benign protocol allows for access to various CF3-containing C-3-aryloyl/acylated benzofurans, benzothiophenes, and indoles. Moreover, the oxidized undesired products, which are inherently formed by the cleavage of the vinylic carbon and heteroatom bond, have been circumvented under oxidant free conditions. The mechanistic investigations by UV-visible and ESR spectroscopy, electrochemical studies, isotope labelling and density functional theory (DFT) suggest that light induced PQ produced a CF3 radical from CF3SO2Na. The generated CF3 radical adds to the alkene, followed by cyclization, to provide a vinylic radical that transfers an electron to PQ and generates a vinylic cation. Alternatively, electron transfer may occur from the CF3-added alkene moiety, forming a carbocation, which would undergo cationic cyclization to generate a vinylic carbocation. The subsequent addition of water to the vinylic cation, followed by the elimination of hydrogen gas, led to the formation of trifluoromethylated C-3-aryloyliacylated heterocycles.									95	9	0	0	18	0	98			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000408168600090	28989690

Their broad substrate spectrum accompanied by the only need for molecular oxygen as cosubstrate and production of hydrogen peroxide as sole by-product makes these enzymes very promising biocatalysts. AAOs were used in the synthesis of flavors, fragrances, and other high-value-added compounds and building blocks as well as in dye decolorization and pulp biobleaching. Furthermore, AAOs offer a huge potential as efficient suppliers of hydrogen peroxide for peroxidase- and peroxygenase-catalyzed reactions. A prerequisite for application as biocatalysts at larger scale is the production of AAOs in sufficient amounts. Heterologous expression of these predominantly fungal enzymes is, however, quite challenging. This review summarizes different approaches aiming at enhancing heterologous expression of AAOs and gives an update on substrates accepted by these promising enzymes as well as potential fields of their application.									9	0	0	0	7	0	9			0175-7598	1432-0614		WOS:000651026100002	33997930

The results of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), fast Fourie transition (111), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed that the proportion of the (111) facets on the Pd surface was higher at lower temperatures. Hydrogen oxygen pulse titration (H-2-O-2) and H-2-temperature programmed desorption (H-2-TPD) showed that the hydrogen adsorption volume of Pd/C catalysts was correlated linearly with the Pd(111) facet proportions. All Pd/C catalysts had an average particle size of 4.3 nm with narrow particle size distribution, which could eliminated the effect of particle size. The similar pore parameters and Pd loading of all catalysts allowed the reasonable comparison for Pd(111) facet proportions influenced the hydrogenation performance in three typical reactions. Moreover, linear correlations were found between the H-2 consumption rate with Pd (111) facet proportions in each of styrene, cyclohexene, and p-nitrotoluene hydrogenation. The good catalytic performance of high Pd(111) facet proportion catalyst for hydrogenations could be attributed to the H-2 molecule prior to absorbed the Pd(111) facet promoting the formation of dissociated hydrogen atoms. These results above indicated that Pd-based catalysts with high (111) facet proportion facilitated hydrogenation performance.									1	1	0	0	0	0	1			1001-4861			WOS:000662175300022

They are concerned with the reaction of rivers to climatic changes in the Pleistocene. Based on the field investigations, granularity, magnetic susceptibility, palynological records and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating, the age of the third terrace was revealed. It shows that the Yellow River incised during the transition from interglacial to glacial. Evidences show that the paleoclimate and environment in Xunhua basin during the Late Pleistocene can be roughly divided into six stages: (1) 120-114 ka, the climate was warm and moist; (2) 114-105 ka, the climate turned cool and dry; (3) 105-98 ka, the climate was relatively warm and humid; (4) 98-85 ka, the climate turned cool and temperature; (5) 85-75 ka, the climate was warm and humid; (6) 75-63 ka, the climate was cold and dry, which can be compared with high-resolution ice core and marine oxygen isotope climate series.									0	2	0	0	0	0	2			1000-2383			INSPEC:12264813

Although the dealloyed nanoporous materials are compositionally dominated by the more-noble elements, they inevitably contain residual less-noble elements that cannot be completely removed through the percolation dealloying process. How to employ the less noble elements to rationally guide the structural evolution and optimize the catalytic performances of the dealloyed noble metal nanocatalysts still remains largely unexplored. Here, we have discovered that incorporation of Ag into Au-Cu binary alloy nanoparticles substantially enhances the Cu leaching kinetics while effectively suppressing the ligament coarsening during the nanoporosityevolving percolation dealloying of the alloy nanoparticles. The controlled coleaching of Ag and Cu from Au Ag Cu ternary alloy nanoparticles provides a unique way to optimize both the surface area to-mass ratios and specific activities of the dealloyed nanosponge particles for the electrocatalytic oxidation of alcohols. The residual Ag in the fully dealloyed nanosponge particles plays crucial roles in stabilizing the surface active sites and maintaining the nanoporous architectures during the electrocatalytic reactions, thereby greatly enhancing the durability of the electrocatalysts. The insights gained from this work shed light on the underlying roles of residual less-noble elements that are crucial to the rational optimization of electrocatalysis on noble-metal nanostructures.									40	2	0	0	0	0	40			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000387625000078	27690465

However, the weak chemical bonds and the poor charge behavior(e.g. notoriously low carrier mobility, short life of charge carriers) intrinsic in them, always incur quite limited efficiency and stability. Therefore, the assembly of them into specific nanostructures or nanocomposites is usually proposed to enhance their optoelectronic properties, as well as the photocatalytic efficiency and reliability. Zero over line dimensional (0D) nanoparticles are low in size and hence high in specific surface area(SSA) ; one over line dimensional (1D) nanostructures are usually arranged in an orderly long range thus leading to low surface defect density and higher carrier mobility; two over line dimensional (2D) structures are particularly capable of enhancing the photogenerated charge utilization because of their large reaction sites and shortened charge transport length; The heterogeneous interfaces in the nanocomposites can effectively facilitate the special charge separation. All these emphasize their importance in photocatalytic activity and stability. So far, organic nanostructures are increasingly used in the photocatalytic decomposition of pollutants, CO2 reduction, water splitting into oxygen and hydrogen, etc. In this review, the varied organic nanostructures, properties, mechanistic pathways, and the different photocatalytic applications are summarized, and moreover, the challenges and future outlook are also given.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1005-281X			WOS:000750006000001

High charging overpotential of conventional aprotic Li-O(2)batteries still restricts their practical application. Herein, we propose a photo-involved rechargeable Li-O(2)battery to not only realize direct solar-to-electric energy conversion/storage but also address the overpotential issue. In this photo-involved battery system, the g-C3N4-decorated WO(3)nanowire array (WO3@g-C(3)N(4)NWA) heterojunction semiconductor is used as both the photoelectrode and oxygen electrode. Upon charging under visible-light irradiation, the photoexcited holes and electrons arein situgenerated on the WO3@g-C(3)N(4)NWA heterojunction cathode. The fabrication of the heterojunction can distinctly reduce the recombination rate between electrons and holes, while photon-generated carriers are effectively and quickly separated and then migrate under a large current density. The discharge product (Li2O2) can be oxidized to O(2)and Li(+)with a reduced charging voltage (3.69 V) by the abundant photoexcited holes, leading to high energy efficiency, good cycling stability and excellent rate capability. This newly photo-involved reaction scheme could open new avenues toward the design of advanced solar-to-electric energy conversion and storage systems.									13	2	0	0	2	0	13			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000572677500019	32970089

Herein, we developed a facile method to fabricate Zn-vacancy mediated direct Z-scheme CdS/ZnS composites derived from CdS/MOF-5 via using Na2S and Na2SO3 aqueous solution as sacrificial agent in the process of photocatalytic reaction. XPS and PL results demonstrated that the metal-organic frameworks (MOF-5) transformed ZnS possesses abundant zinc vacancies, which help to form ohmic contact and broaden light absorption. Upward PL certifies the two-photons absorption behavior of the zinc vacancies ZnS under visible-light irradiation. Benefited from the ohmic contact which is inducted by zinc vacancy defects, the photo-induced electron of ZnS on the zinc vacancy defect level recombine with the holes of CdS in VB though the ohmic contact. As a result, the electrons and holes of CdS in the VB and CB can be efficiently separation and the photocorrosion is effectively suppressed, leading to drastically enhanced photocatalytic H-2 evolution performance. The maximum photocatalytic H-2 production rate of 11.62 mmol h(-1) g(-1) is obtained with an apparent quantum efficiency of 11.09% at 470 nm over CdS/MOF-5(25) heterojunction without any noble-metal as cocatalyst in Na2S and Na2SO3 aqueous solution, which is about 89.38 and 31.4 times greater than that of the bare MOF-5 and CdS, respectively. Moreover, S 2p XPS spectra of recyclability testing CdS/MOF-5(25) sample and the time-resolved fluorescence (TRPL) decay further prove the Z-scheme charge transfer and separation mechanism. This work represents a simple strategy to fabricate visible-light responded Zn-vacancy ZnS derived from MOF-5 and highlights the critical role of defects for developing Z-scheme photocatalyst in solar energy conversion.									123	4	0	0	10	0	126			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000444859700012

One of the challenges plaguing this field is an economical and scalable approach to fabricate high-quality protective coatings on the CAM particles. A new wet-coating strategy based on preformed nanoparticles is presented herein. Nonagglomerated nanoparticles of the coating material (<= 5 nm, exemplified for ZrO2) are prepared by solvothermal synthesis, and after surface functionalization, applied to a layered Ni-rich oxide CAM, LiNi0.85Co0.10Mn0.05O2 (NCM85), producing a uniform surface layer with a unique structure. Remarkably, when used in pelletized SSBs with argyrodite Li6PS5Cl as SE, the coated NCM85 is found to exhibit superior lithium-storage properties (q(dis) approximate to 204 mAh g(NCM85)(-1) at 0.1 C rate and 45 degrees C) and good rate capability. The key to the observed improvement lies in the homogeneity of coating, suppressing interfacial side reactions while simultaneously limiting gas evolution during operation. Moreover, this strategy is proven to have a similar effect in liquid electrolyte-based Li-ion batteries and can potentially be used for the application of other, even more favorable, nanoparticle coatings.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000760267700001

In this work, heterostructures of CoNi2S4/Ni3S2 on nickel foam (CoNi2S4/Ni3S2@NF) are synthesized by a facile one-step hydrothermal method as promising bifunctional electrocatalysts. To achieve an electrocatalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution, the CoNi2S4/Ni3S2@NF electrode requires overpotential as low as 171 mV and 243 mV for HER and OER, respectively. Furthermore, the overall water splitting device with CoNi2S4/Ni3S2@NF electrode as both cathode and anode requires 1.65 V to offer current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the strong coupling interactions between CoNi2S4 and Ni3S2 synergistically optimized the electronic structure, thus enhancing the electrochemical water splitting performances. Surfaces oxidation of CoNi2S4/Ni3S2@NF electrode is considered to hinder the electrochemical activities for OER. The present work not only provides a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting but also expands the applications of CoNi2S4 based materials. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Thin films prepared without calcium are essentially crystalline gamma-Fe2O3, but those prepared with calcium are amorphous, and with optimal calcium content, the resultant film consists of a short-range order gamma-Fe2O3 domain embedded in an amorphous Ca2Fe2O5 matrix. CaFeOx prepared with optimal calcium content decomposes upon exposure to phosphate, resulting in the leaching of surface calcium and formation of redox-active iron phosphate, which prevents the loss of active iron species from etching by protons released from the water oxidation process. The amorphous nature and in situ formation of iron phosphate render CaFeOx with high activity and stability under high turnover conditions, reaching 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential (eta) of similar to 650 mV with a small increase in eta (similar to 30 mV) over 2 h electrolysis in phosphate buffer (1.0 M, pH 7). When being integrated onto a BiVO4 photoanode, CaFeOx greatly improves the kinetics of the OER and interfacial hole transfer at BiVO4, resulting in remarkable enhancement in its photocurrent response and photostability.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2398-4902			WOS:000424001700027

To improve the performance of anodes, the influence factors (sintering temperature, heat treatment time and dip-coating times) were systematically explored. The results show that the optimum sterilizing effect of AEOW is obtained in the case of sintering at 450 degrees C for 1 h with as many dip-coatings as possible. The sintering temperature is a critical factor. A lower temperature leads to better reaction selectivity, whereas a higher temperature results in a longer lifetime. A short heat treatment time leads to inadequate coating oxidation, a long heat treatment time prolongs the lifetime but results in high SEC. Increasing the number of dip-coatings could enhance the coating-substrate adhesion, thus extending the anode lifetime. The electrode prepared by optimization could replace the platinized Ti anode to produce AEOW. AEOW could be used as an effective disinfectant for eliminating Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The sterilization ability is based on the combined effect of active chlorine concentration (ACC), low pH and high oxidation reduction potential (ORP). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, some supports are susceptible to being dissolved in acidic solution or are unstable in ambient air. The development of high-performance catalysts has been facing the major hurdles of the sluggish activity in alkaline solution and requesting high energy to stabilize the nanoparticles on their supports, challenging the pH-universality and the applicability of the supported metallic nanoparticles. Here, a one-step strategy is proposed to modulate the growth of Pt quantum dots (QDs) on HF-free MXene under atomic-level by a low-temperature metal-support interaction reaction. By controllable tailoring in the morphology and strain induced by terminations, Pt (111) QDs with a sub-nanoscale size of 1.15 nm are grown as 0D/1D heterostructure to overcome the restrictions of employing reduction gas and high annealing temperature. The catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 33.3 mV for acidic solution, while 65.1 mV for alkaline solution at a specific current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This study not only paves a scalable pathway to developing cost-efficient catalysts in moderate conditions, but also demonstrates an effective surface modulation strategy for 0D/1D heterostructures.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8				2198-3844		WOS:000703739400001	34612021

Therefore, knowing their structures with atomic resolution and sufficient time resolution is crucial in correlating structures with molecular properties. Using x-ray transient absorption (XTA) spectroscopy, transient metal oxidation states, coordination geometry, and atomic rearrangements during photochemical processes can be probed. Such an approach complements with ultrafast optical laser spectroscopy in obtaining kinetics and coherence information among different excited states as well as intra- and intermolecular energy/charge transfer processes associated with solar energy conversion. Excited state structures of transition metal complexes, such as metalloporphyrins in solution, created by photoexcitation have been studied by XTA combined with optical transient absorption spectroscopy. Direct evidences of photoinduced redox reactions and coordination geometry changes as well as electronic configurations of the metals can be observed. These experimental studies are combined with quantum mechanical calculations to rationalize the evolution of the ultrafast excited state pathways with electronic configuration changes that may be responsible for the reactivity of the molecules in solar hydrogen generation. Preliminary timeresolved X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) studies on Pt coated TiO2 nanoparticles during photocatalysis show a significant potential impact of XTA in understanding solar hydrogen production.

J	Cai, Qijun; Liu, Zhifeng; Ma, Chonghao; Tong, Zhengfu; Han, Changcun								Network-like CuInS2 photocathode and modified with noble metal co-catalyst for photoelectrochemical water splitting								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS				29	24			20629	20638		10.1007/s10854-018-0201-z				DEC 2018	2018	It is of great significance to explore new preparation methods and control the morphology and proportion of metal ions for the photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting of ternary sulfide photoelectrode. In this paper, the network-like CuInS2 film photocathodes were firstly prepared by hydrothermal growth method. The effects of different [Cu2+]/[In3+] molar ratios and concentrations of growth solution on CuInS2 films were investigated in detail. The mechanism of the synthetic reaction was studied. The best PEC photocurrent density of the CuInS2 film photoelectrode is -0.81mA/cm(2) at -0.6V versus RHE when the [Cu2+]/[In3+] molar ratio is 0.4, the growth solution concentration is 8mmol/L CuCl(2)2H(2)O, 20mmol/L InCl(3)4H(2)O and 60mmol/L C2H5NS. For the purpose of further improving photoelectrochemical properties of CuInS2 thin films, the Pt co-catalyst was loaded. The synthesized CuInS2-Pt thin film yielded a photocurrent density for -1.92mA/cm(2) at -0.6V versus RHE due to the fast photogenerated electrons capture ability of Pt co-catalyst. The method of constructing photoelectrode film and the co-catalyst mechanism contributes to a sensational way for PEC water splitting of sulfide.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000449273300013

The responsible mechanisms are: 1) increased intracellular iron catalyzes the Fenton reaction to generate hydroxyl radicals, leading to mutagenic oxidative DNA lesions; 2) iron is necessary for cellular proliferation as cofactors of many enzymes. Thus, iron-excess milieu promotes selecting cellular evolution to ferroptosis-resistance, a major basis for carcinogenesis. Ferritin is a 24-subunit nanocage protein required for iron storage under the regulation of the iron-regulatory protein (IRP)/iron-responsive element (IRE) system. Ferritin is a serum marker, representing total body iron storage. However, how ferritin is secreted extracellularly has been unelucidated. We recently discovered that an exosomal marker CD63 is regulated by the IRP/IRE system and that iron-loaded ferritin is secreted as extracellular vesicles under the guidance of nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4). On the other hand, we found that macrophages under asbestos-induced ferroptosis emit ferroptosis-dependent extracellular vesicles (FedEVs), which are received by nearby mesothelial cells, resulting in significant mutagenic DNA damage. Therefore, cells, including macrophages, can share excess iron with other cells, via iron-loaded ferritin packaged in extracellular vesicles as safe non-catalytic iron. However, similar process, such as one involving FedEVs, may cause accumulation of excess iron in other specific cells, which may eventually promote carcinogenesis.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			2288-3649	2288-3657		WOS:000742152500005	35047450

ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 were synthesized by a single step at room temperature, and the detailed characterization through XRD and FE-SEM study revealed similar surface morphology of the two isostructural ZIFs. Again, the chemical and thermal stability studies exhibited the better stability of ZIF-8 over ZIF-67. The through characterizations also revealed the better surface area and porosity and adsorption of 4-nitrophenol over ZIF-8 compare to ZIF-67. Interesting, in spite of inferior physical properties, ZIF-67 revealed better electrocatalytic properties between the isostructural ZIFs. ZIF-67 showed unprecedentedly fast reduction of 4nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol, whereas the reduction of 4-nitrophenol over ZIF-8 took almost 180 min, in-spite of better adsorption. The detailed mechanistic studies revealed that the electrocatalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol over ZIF-8 electrode underwent through an orthodox 6e(-) system pathway to produce 4-aminophenol through hydroxyl amine and nitroso containing intermediates. Whereas, ZIF-67 produced hydrogen through water splitting that directly reduced 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol with complete product selectivity.									23	1	0	0	4	0	23			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000503910000013

Herein, we synthesize two crystalline 2D-CTFs with different pore sizes, namely BPY-CTF with single-sized pores and DCP-CTF with heteropores. Via the confinement effect of porous structure, metal ions (copper, cobalt, nickel, palladium, and platinum) and their corresponding nanoscale metal clusters are inserted into bulk CTFs as catalytically active sites to improve the catalytic activity for water-splitting. The as-synthesized CTFs, CTF-M2+, and CTF@MC were evaluated as HER catalysts in acidic solution. The symbiotic DCP-CTF-Pt2+ demonstrated a remarkable electrocatalytic performance, with an overpotential of 46 mV and a Tafel slope of 30.2 mV dec(-1), comparable to those of commercial 20% Pt/C. Furthermore, we employed the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) with the projector augmented wave method to conduct first principle calculations to reveal the electrocatalytic activity, which indicated that the excellent catalytic activity of DCP-CTF-Pt2+ arises from the synergetic effect of intrinsic porosity and adjacent double N anchor sites, which coordinate metal ions, sharply increasing the catalytic kinetics and stability of HER.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000639271200001

However, the details of this synergistic effect still lacks deep study. Herein, we fabricated an Ni2P/Ni5P4 electrocatalyst with a Janus nanostructure embedded in N-doped carbon through a controllable phosphidation approach. The as-obtained hybrid catalyst realized an overpotential of 104 mV and Tafel slope of 38.5 mV dec(-1), which were smaller than that of the single Ni2P and Ni5P4, at a current density of -10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. To reveal the reasons for the promotion of electrocatalytic properties, the synergistic effect was analyzed with the difference charge density (DCD), density of state (DOS), Delta G(H*), and strength of the internal electric field (IEF) on the interface between Ni5P4 and Ni2P. The results indicated that the composite structures could optimize the Delta G(H*) due to the change in the DOS instead of DCD. Further calculations indicated that the composite structure could modify the effective electric field, which is often overlooked and may be the reason for the change in the DOS. This study provides new insight for designing multi-component catalysts and deeply illuminating a part of the synergistic effect for high-efficiently electrocatalytic activities.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000518579100008

Here, we comprehensively reviewed all water electrolysis research areas through computational analysis, using a citation network to objectively detect emerging technologies and provide interdisciplinary data for forecasting trends. The results show that all research areas increase their publication counts per year, and the following two areas are particularly increasing in terms of number of publications: "microbial electrolysis" and "catalysts in an alkaline water electrolyzer (AWE) and in a polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolyzer (PEME).". Other research areas, such as AWE and PEME systems, solid oxide electrolysis, and the whole renewable energy system, have recently received several review papers, although papers that focus on specific technologies and are cited frequently have not been published within the citation network. This indicates that these areas receive attention, but there are no novel technologies that are the center of the citation network. Emerging technologies detected within these research areas are presented in this review. Furthermore, a comparison with fuel cell research is conducted because water electrolysis is the reverse reaction to fuel cells, and similar technologies are employed in both areas. Technologies that are not transferred between fuel cells and water electrolysis are introduced, and future water electrolysis trends are discussed.									13	0	1	0	1	0	13				2071-1050		WOS:000425943100201		
J	Holbrook, GP; Keys, AJ								Evidence for recycling of inorganic phosphate by wheat chloroplasts during photosynthesis at air levels of CO2 and O-2								JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY				160	11			1351	1360		10.1078/0176-1617-01117				NOV 2003	2003	Phosphate recycling under photorespiratory conditions was investigated using intact wheat chloroplasts from Triticum aestivum (cv. Maris dove). A decline in the optimal Pi level needed to support steady-state photosynthesis was observed (a) as the bicarbonate supply became limiting, or (b) as oxygen concentrations were increased. Further, at subsaturating CO2 and elevated O-2 (52%), photosynthetic induction periods were shortest in the absence of exogenous Pi, and severely extended by its addition. Thus, photosynthesis under low CO2 levels which favor ribulose 1,5 bisphosphate (RuBP) oxygenase activity and glycolate synthesis by chloroplasts decreases their dependency on exogenous Pi from the initial illumination of chloroplasts through to the attainment of steady state rates of O-2 evolution. Uptake of phosphate (Pi) was directly measured at ambient O-2 concentrations and showed the stoichiometry of O-2 evolved to Pi consumed at 10 mmol/L bicarbonate (saturating) had a mean value of 3.0, and was increased to 5.4 at 2.5 mmol/L bicarbonate and to >8.0 at 1.0 mmol/L bicarbonate. This observation is consistent with enhanced stromal recycling of Pi released during hydrolysis of phosphoglycolate produced in greater quantities as the ratio of RuBP carboxylase relative to oxygenase activities (vc/vo) declines. The theoretical relationship between vc/vo and O-2/Pi stoichiometries was derived and compared favorably to experimental data obtained.									0	0	0	0	1	1	1			0176-1617			WOS:000186971000009	14658388

Herein, a novel foamed zinc oxide-silica spheres and Ag-AgBr nanocomposite (Ag-AgBr/FZSS) was engineered and passes through a complete characterization profiling. The AgeAgBr/FZSS possesses the distinctive porous surface with open cavities. The hierarchical morphology provides many active sites and mesoporous conducting channels for visible light absorption and charge carriers transportation. The Ag-AgBr/FZSS act as outperformed photo-/electrocatalyst for OER (overpotential 348 mV @ 10 mAcm(-2)) and HER (potential -217 mV @ 100 mAcm(-2)). While under illumination conditions it reduced to 337 mV and -195 mV with high quantum conversion efficiency (37.5%). The lustrous durability further justified as a highly efficient photo-/electrocatalyst for renewable energy conversions. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, the interfacial engineering strategy can effectively tune their physical and chemical properties to improve performance. Herein, we produced N-doped molybdenum carbide nanosheets on carbonized melamine (N-doped Mo2C@CN) and 3D hollow Mo2C-Mo2N nanostructures (3D H-Mo2C-Mo2N) with tuneable interfacial properties via high-temperature treatment. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that Mo2C and Mo2N nanocrystals in 3D hollow nanostructures are chemically bonded with each other and produce stable heterostructures. The 3D H-Mo2C-Mo2N nanostructures demonstrate lower onset potential and overpotential at a current density of 10 mV cm(-2) than the N-doped Mo2C@CN nanostructure due to its higher active sites and improved interfacial charge transfer. The current work presents a strategy to tune metal carbide/nitride nanostructures and interfacial properties for the production of high-performance energy materials.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000713052700090	34641668

The kinetics of the polymerizations shows first order with respect to monomer conversions. Linear evolution of the M-n of the produced polymers with the monomer conversion is observed. Meanwhile, the as-prepared polymers are of relatively narrow polydispersity (PDI=M-w/M-n). For instance, the polymerization of p-MS shows living polymerization features using PC1 within a range of solvents. Especially, the M-n of PpMS increased from about 2100 to 12,700 g/mol with the monomer conversion from 8% to 52% in tetrahydrofuran. The controlled polymerization of St is also observed under optimal reaction conditions. However, the M-n discrepancy between the experimental readings and theoretical calculations is greater at the monomer conversions greater than 40% and the PDI increased gradually over the monomer conversion. This is probably because that CTA is strongly sensitive to the light irradiation with wave range around its characteristic absorption wavelength, leading to significant decomposition of CTA moieties during the RAFT polymerization.

Hall, David/L-1681-2013	Hall, David/0000-0001-9632-0399			An Oxalate Method for Measuring the Surface Area of Nickel Electrodes								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				161	12			H787	H795		10.1149/2.0711412jes				2014	2014	This work establishes a new method to measure the electrochemically active surface area (A(ECSA)) of nickel electrodes, in situ. The addition of 0.08 mol L-1 of an oxalate salt to an alkaline electrolyte solution shifts the half-wave potential of the Ni(II)/Ni(III) redox pair by about -80 mV. Further, these peaks are very narrow. The sharpest peak in this work has a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of just 11 mV. This unusual sharpness is attributed to the layered structure of nickel hydroxides and the adsorption of oxalate from the solution on the (001) surface. This is supported by attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) peaks measured at 1265 cm(-1), 1655 cm(-1), and 1713 cm(-1), which correspond to mononuclear bidentate oxalate bonded to nickel. At sufficiently fast potential scan rates (>= 150 mV s(-1)), the adsorbed oxalate limits growth of the surface hydroxide to a single layer. During the reverse scan, the surface NiOOH/Ni(OH)(2) reduction peak is well-separated from other electrochemical processes and may be used to accurately and precisely measure the AECSA. The error of this method is estimated at < 10%. (C) 2014 NRC Canada. Published by ECS.

The reported two- or three-dimensional fluid models are shown to be an effective method for this study. However, owing to the complex chemistry in APPJ-water interaction, little of them could provide a quantitative estimation of reactive species, which are difficult to be measured but of much interest in the applications. In this paper, a one-dimensional fluid model is developed to simulate the interaction between a helium APPJ and deionized water, which incorporates a relatively comprehensive chemistry both in gas and liquid phases but with a moderate computational load. The composition and distribution of reactive species are quantified during a plasma treatment time of 6 min, which is typical in practice. By considering the sidewise loss inside the quartz tube, the air mixing outside the quartz tube, the conductivity of deionized water, and the chlorine evolution reaction, the simulation results agree well with the experiments. It is found that the plasma could be divided into three regions with much different physicochemical properties, mainly due to the sidewise loss, the air mixing and the water evaporation. In plasma-activated water, H2O2aq and HNO2aq/NO2aq (-) are the dominant reactive species, and OHaq is the key intermediate species for the transformation among other reactive species. Finally, the chemical pathways for the production of aqueous reactive species are elucidated.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000776452000001

The as-prepared N-doped ZnS catalysts exhibited outstanding photocatalytic activities toward the removal of organic pollutants under natural sunlight and H-2 generation by water splitting. As expected, the rationally designed N-doped ZnS catalysts displayed significantly enhanced photocatalytic H-2 production performances, particularly N-ZS3, with the highest H-2 evolution rate of 243.61 mmol g(-1) h(-1). In addition, in the presence of N-ZS3, ca. 99% metronidazole removal was achieved within 150 min under natural sunlight irradiation. Furthermore, the prepared catalysts exhibited high photocatalytic performance towards the removal of various other organic pollutants, including methyl orange, methylene blue, rhodamine B, ciprofloxacin, and sulfanilamide. The high photocatalytic performances of the prepared catalysts were attributed to N doping, which increased the visible light absorption capacity and electron transfer efficiency of ZnS. Finally, reaction mechanisms for photocatalytic oxidation and H-2 generation were proposed. It is anticipated that the design and fabrication of the N-doped ZnS photocatalyst will provide beneficial insights for organic pollutant removal and H-2 production applications.

As-synthesized PSM perovskites were first annealed up to 1000 degrees C in air and the calcined powder obtained was further analyzed using multiple characterization techniques. A high-temperature experimental set-up consisting of a Setaram SETSYS Evolution thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) was developed and utilized for the examination of the SCS derived PSM perovskites towards thermochemical CO2 splitting reactions. The obtained results indicate that the lower Pr and higher Sr atomic concentrations are beneficial to achieve the maximum amounts of O-2 released (n(O2)) and CO produced O in each thermochemical cycle. Based on the average n(O2) and, the Pr0.18Sr0.80Mn0.99O2.951 (PSM2) and Pr0.39Sr0.63Mn0.98O2.979 (PSM4) were identified as the best choices for the solar thermochemical conversion of CO2. When compared with the CeO2 material (which is considered as a yardstick), the average n(O2) and by all the PSM perovskites was considerably higher for each cycle.					3rd International Conference on Alternative Fuels, Energy and Environment - Future and Challenges (ICAFEE)3rd International Conference on Alternative Fuels, Energy and Environment - Future and Challenges (ICAFEE)	OCT 28-31, 2018OCT 28-31, 2018		Nanjing, PEOPLES R CHINANanjing, PEOPLES R CHINA	20	0	0	0	0	0	20			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000476980200132

The surface chemistry and morphology prior to dipping have been analyzed in detail, along with their evolution during annealing, and the coating quality and chemistry were characterized and interpreted in relation to the surface condition prior to dipping. It was found that Mn segregates to the surface and gives rise to significant selective oxidation for all the experimental atmospheres, with a transition from external to internal oxidation occurring when the oxidation potential of the atmosphere increased. However, in spite of the presence of Mn oxides at the steel surface prior to dipping, samples annealed under all atmospheres exhibited good coating adherence and a well developed inhibition layer. This is attributed to the aluminothermic reduction of the Mn oxides by the Al present in the Zn bath followed by reactive wetting between the substrate and the Zn bath. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Post-processing nucleosynthesis results are presented for stellar models with initial masses between 1M(circle dot) and 7.5M(circle dot) for Z = 0.007, and 1M(circle dot) and 8M(circle dot) for Z = 0.014 (solar) and Z = 0.03. We include stellar surface abundances as a function of thermal pulse on the AGB for elements from C to Bi and for a selection of isotopic ratios for elements up to Fe and Ni (e.g., C-12/C-13), which can be obtained from observations of molecules in stars and from the laboratory analysis of meteoritic stardust grains. Ratios of elemental abundances of He/H, C/O, and N/O are also included, which are useful for direct comparison to observations of AGB stars and their progeny, including planetary nebulae. The integrated elemental stellar yields are presented for each model in the grid for hydrogen, helium, and all stable elements from C to Bi. Yields of Li are also included for intermediate-mass models with hot bottom burning. We present the first slow neutron-capture (s-process) yields for super solar kmetallicity AGB stars with Z = 0.03, and the first complete s-process yields for models more massive than 6M(circle dot) at all three metallicities.									141	0	0	0	0	0	141			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000381930000026

Recently, using 10,10'-dibromo-9,9'-bianthracene (DBBA) as a molecular precursor to grow armchair nanoribbons on Au(111) and Cu(111), we have shown that substrate activity considerably affects the dynamics of ribbon formation, nonetheless without significant modifications in the growth mechanism. In this paper we compare the on-surface reaction pathways for DBBA molecules on Cu(111) and Cu(110). Evolution of both systems has been studied via a combination of core-level X-ray spectroscopies, scanning tunneling microscopy, and theoretical calculations. Experimental and theoretical results reveal a significant increase in reactivity for the open and anisotropic Cu(110) surface in comparison with the close-packed Cu(111). This increased reactivity results in a predominance of the molecular substrate interaction over the intermolecular one, which has a critical impact on the transformations of DBBA on Cu(110). Unlike DBBA on Cu(111), the Ullmann coupling cannot be realized for DBBA/Cu(110) and the growth of nanoribbons via this mechanism is blocked. Instead, annealing of DBBA on Cu(110) at 250 degrees C results in the formation of a new structure: quasi-zero-dimensional flat nanographenes. Each nanographene unit has dehydrogenated zigzag edges bonded to the underlying Cu rows and oriented with the hydrogen-terminated armchair edge parallel to the [1-10] direction. Strong bonding of nanographene to the substrate manifests itself in a high adsorption energy of -12.7 eV and significant charge transfer of 3.46e from the copper surface. Nanographene units coordinated with bromine adatoms are able to arrange in highly regular arrays potentially suitable for nanotemplating.									104	3	0	0	8	0	105			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000361935800037	26301684

In this study, we synthesized nitrogendoped porous carbon substrates by using a SiO2-protected calcination strategy with ZIF-8 as a precursor. The experimental results revealed the prepared porous nitrogen-doped carbon (PNC) to have high dispersion, large specific surface area, and rich pore structure, allowing high exposure of active sites. The carbon support showed optimum characteristics to deposit precious metals with small particle sizes. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that the N groups on the PNC substrates served as coordination sites for Ru, allowing the formation of ultrafine nanoclusters. The Ru clusters showed good metal dispersion, exposing more active sites and improving the utilization of the precious metal. At a current density of 10 mA/cm2, Ru/PNC showed a minimum overpotential of 40 mV. This work provided a simple and effective method for the preparation of excellent carbon substrates and the synthesis of metal clusters with small particle sizes.

Such a CoP-MoO2/MF heterostructure exhibits superior HER performance with low overpotentials of 42 mV (alkaline) and 65 mV (acid) to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), robust stability, large exchange current density and high turnover frequency. The experimental characterization and DFT calculations reveal that the presence of MoO2 leads to an inherent ability to adsorb water and cleave H-O bonds, favoring hydrogen transfer to accelerate the Volmer step. Heterointerfacial charge redistribution provides optimal hydrogen adsorption ability on adjacent P sites to boost the Heyrovsky step and, as a result, the hydrogen adsorption free energy (Delta G(H*)) can be reduced from 0.08 eV on CoP (011) and -0.78 eV on MoO2 (011) to 0.02 eV on the heterointerface of CoP-MoO2, which significantly improves the HER activity and accelerates the catalytic kinetics. This work highlights the roles of the heterointerface in electrocatalysis and provides an avenue to design electrocatalysts.									45	2	0	0	1	0	46			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000526953200028

In this study, nanowall-like N-Ni5P4/Ni2P/NF (N-NiP/NF) was synthesized by a simple two-step method involving hydrothermal treatment and phosphorylation. The catalyst has good catalytic activity for the OER, and only 160 mV is required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, which is even better than RuO2, with good corrosion resistance. In addition, N-Co2P/Ni2P/NF (N-CoP/NF) was synthesized by the same method with good electrocatalytic properties and good conductivity towards the HER. N-NiP/NF was used as the anode and N-CoP/NF was used as the cathode to form the N-NiP//N-CoP double electrode system, which showed excellent electrolytic performance for water splitting, requiring only 1.48 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2). This is mainly due to the strong electronegativity of N that makes the N doping induce the electron transfer process, which results in a high catalytic activity of the adjacent transition metal atoms and thus promotes the electrolysis of water, as well as the unique vertical nanowall-like structure, which gives the material a large surface area and accessibility to active sites, facilitating the adsorption of water molecules and catalytic reactions. In addition, the unique structure favors the diffusion of water molecules and the release of gaseous products, ensuring close contact between the catalyst and the electroactive material. This simple non-metallic N doping strategy provides a new way to produce efficient non-precious metal catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000814709300001	35735099

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) can function as ideal molecular platforms for the design of highly reactive transition metal phosphides (TMPs), a kind of candidates for high-efficiently electrocatalytic water splitting. The intrinsic activity of the electrocatalysts can be greatly improved via modulating the electronic structure of the catalytic center through the MOF precursors/templates. Moreover, the carbon layer converted in-situ by the organic ligands can not only protect the TMPs from being degraded in the harsh electrochemical environments, but also avoid agglomeration of the catalysts, thereby promoting their activities and stabilities. Furthermore, heteroatom-containing ligands can incorporate N, S or P, etc. atoms into the carbon matrixes after conversion, regulating the coordination microenvironments of the active centers as well as their electronic structures. In this review, we first summarized the latest developments in MOF-derived TMPs by the unique advantages in metal, organic ligand, and morphology regulations for electrocatalytic water splitting. Secondly, we concluded the critical scientific issues currently facing for designing state-of-the-art TMP-based electrocatalysts. Finally, we presented an outlook on this research area, encompassing electrocatalyst construction, catalytic mechanism research, etc. (c) 2021 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

In this study, we report a novel MoO2/MoS2/TiO2 sandwich heterostructure that was prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) for highly efficient photocatalytic H-2 generation. The sandwich structure, consisting of a MoS2 nanoflake layer and a MoO2 nanoplate layer with large specific surface area, was grown on TiO2 nanotube array electrodes. The MoO2 acts as a fast hole transport layer that promotes efficient charge separation. Since the MoO2/MoS2/TiO2 heterostructure has a nearly fullsolar-spectrum absorption range, its photocatalytic activity for water splitting is enhanced, resulting in a H-2 production rate of 110 mu mol h(-1) cm(-2). This work provides a bottom-up strategy for preparing highly efficient sandwich-type photocatalysts. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, a hydrophilic conjugated polyelectrolyte (PFNBTBr) is obtained by quaternarization of a conjugated polymer (PFNBT) and further combined with g-C3N4 nanosheets to form PFNBTBr Pdots/g-C3N4 nanosheets heterojunction (PFNBTBr Pdots/CNNS). The PFNBTBr Pdots/CNNS can enhance the electron transfer as the suitable energy level difference and enhanced charge transfer effect of Br- ions, thus reducing charge-hole pairs recombination. Simultaneously, the hydrophilicity of PFNBTBr Pdots/CNNS can promote the surface wetting, facilitating the reaction between excitons and reactants. The PFNBTBr Pdots/CNNS exhibits a stable hydrogen revolution rate of 1200.9 mu mol.h(-1).g(-1) over 6 runs with an AQY of 7.71 % at 420 nm without co-catalysts, which is 1.55 times higher than that of Pt/CNNS-1%.

MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY				488	1			482	494		10.1093/mnras/stz1411				SEP 2019	2019	We present a new abundance analysis of HD 55496, previously known as a metal-poor barium star. We found that HD 55496 has a metallicity [ Fe/H] = -1.55 and is s-process enriched. We find that HD 55496 presents four chemical peculiarities: ( i) a Na-O abundance anticorrelation; ( ii) it is aluminium rich; ( iii) it is carbon poor for an s-process enriched star, and ( iv) the heavy second s-process peak elements, such as Ba, La, Ce, and Nd, present smaller abundances than the light s-process elements, such as Sr, Y, and Zr, which is not usually observed among the chemically peculiar binary stars at this metallicity. The heavy-element abundance pattern suggests that the main source of the neutrons is the Ne-22(alpha,n)Mg-25 reaction. Taking all these abundance evidences together into consideration strongly suggests that HD 55496 is a 'second-generation of globular cluster stars' formed from gas already strongly enriched in s-process elements and now is a field halo object. Our dynamical analysis, however, indicates that the past encounter probabilities with the known globular clusters are very low (<= 6 per cent). This evidence, together with the retrograde motion, points to a halo intruder possibly originated from the tidal disruption of a dwarf galaxy.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000482319700039

The adsorption of iodide on Cu(1 1 1) at negative electrode potentials close to the onset of the hydrogen evolution reaction leads to the formation of a (root3 xroot3)R30degrees-I structure. However, at more positive electrode potentials a transition to a uniaxially incommensurate (UIC) iodide adlayer takes place caused by a unidirectional compression of the (root3 xroot3)R30degrees-I phase. This compressed adlayer shows an additional one-dimensional long-range height modulation superimposed on the atomic corrugation. The process of compression can be described rather by the insertion of super-heavy domain-walls (shdw) into the (root3 xroot3)R30degrees-I phase than by a uniform and continuous compression of the adsorbate adlayer. Within the UIC phase regular (root3 xroot3)R30degrees-I regions are separated by broad and 'fuzzy' shdw instead of sharp dislocation lines as expected for ideal shdw. This observation points to a partial relaxation of these walls. Within these domain-walls the smallest nearest neighbor distance (NND) of 3.7 Angstrom is significantly smaller than the van-der-Waals diameter of the uncharged iodine particle (3.9 Angstrom) while the NND within adjacent commensurate (root3 xroot3)R30degrees-regions exceeds the 'Pauling' diameter of the single charged iodide (I-) by 1.85%. Both the NND at domain-walls and the wave-length of the striped superstructure change with the applied potential. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The effects of the reaction temperature, the ratio of the Ta precursor to the reactive template (mpg-C3N4), and the selection of the carrier gas (Ar, N-2 and NH3) on the resultant crystal phases and structures were investigated. The produced samples were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), CHN elemental analyses, thermogravimetric analyses (TGA), nitrogen sorption, a temperature-programmed reaction with mass spectroscopy (MS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results indicate that the different tantalum phases with cubic structure, TaN, Ta2CN, and TaC, can be formed under a flow of nitrogen when formed at different temperatures. The Ta3N5 phase with a Ta5+ oxidation state was solely obtained at 1023 K under a flow of ammonia, which gasified the C3N4 template and was confirmed by detecting the decomposed gaseous products via MS. Significantly, the formation of TaC, Ta2CN, and TaN can be controlled by altering the weight ratio of the C3N4 template relative to the Ta precursor at 1573 K under a flow of nitrogen. The high C3N4/Ta precursor ratio generally resulted in high carbide content rather than a nitride one, consistent with the role of mpg-C3N4 as a carbon source. Electrochemical measurements revealed that the synthesized nanomaterials were consistently able to produce hydrogen under acidic conditions (pH 1). The obtained Tafel slope indicates that the rate-determining step is the Volmer discharge step, which is consistent with adsorbed hydrogen being weakly bound to the surface during electrocatalysis.									56	1	0	0	2	0	56			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000325414000031

The underlying turbulent flow is modeled using the two-equation k-epsilon model with modified constants. In the MMC approach, large-scale turbulent fluctuations are emulated by introducing suitable reference variables. A single reference variable is used here to describe the evolution of mixture fraction via a mapping function. The modified Curl's model has been adapted to model the micro-mixing term. A detailed chemical kinetic mechanism involving 9 species and 21 reversible reactions is used for H-2/O-2 combustion. The computed results from the present simulations are found to be in excellent agreement with the available experimental data. Numerical results are found to be sensitive to change in the minor dissipation timescale, which certainly controls the conditional fluctuations around the conditional mean. Also, the predicted flame lift-off heights obtained using the minor mixing time constant C-min = 0.25 are found to be in close proximity with the experimentally observed values for the entire range of coflow temperatures.

The TiO2 films were prepared by reactive DC magnetron sputtering and were subsequently exposed to 50 ppm SO2 gas mixed in synthetic air and irradiated with UV light at substrate temperatures between 298 and 673 K. Simultaneous UV irradiation and SO2 exposure between 373 and 523 K resulted in significant sulfur (S) deposits on crystalline TiO2 films as determined by XPS, whereas amorphous films contained negligible amounts of S. At substrate temperatures above 523 K, the S deposits readily desorbed from TiO2. The oxidation state of sulfur successively changed from S4+ for SO2 adsorbed on crystalline TiO2 films at room temperature without irradiation to S6+ for films exposed to SO2 at elevated temperatures with simultaneous irradiation. In situ FTIR was used to monitor the temporal evolution of the photoinduced surface reaction products formed on the TiO2 surfaces. It is shown that band gap excitation of TiO2 results in photoinduced oxidation of SO2, which at elevated temperatures become coordinated to the TiO2 lattice through interactions with O vacancies and form sulfite and sulfate surface species. These species makes the surface acidic, which is manifested in nondetectable,adherence of stearic acid to the modified surface. The modified films show good chemical stability as evidenced by, sonication and repeated recycling of the films. The results suggest a new method to functionalize wide band gap oxide surfaces by means of photoinduced reactions in reactive gases at elevated substrate temperatures. In the case of anatase TiO2 in reactive SO2 gas, we here show that such functionalization yields surfaces with excellent oleophobic properties, as probed by adhesion of stearic acid.									33	0	0	0	6	0	33			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000300644500026	22204641

Iron oxygenases activate the O-O bond of dioxygen to perform oxidation of alkane and alkenes moieties with outstanding levels of regio-, chemo-and stereoselectivity. Along a bioinspired approach, iron coordination complexes which mimic structural and reactivity aspects of the active sites of nonheme iron oxygenases have been explored as oxidation catalysts. This review describes the evolution of this research field, from the early attempts to reproduce the basic reactivity of nonheme iron oxygenases to the development of effective iron oxidation catalysts. The work covers exclusively nonheme iron complexes which rely on H2O2 or O-2 as terminal oxidants. First, it delineates the key steps and the essential catalyst design principles required to activate the peroxide bond at nonheme iron centers without (or at least minimizing) the release of free-diffusing radicals. It follows with a critical description of the mechanistic pathways which govern the reaction between iron complexes and H2O2 to generate the oxidizing species. Eventually, the work presents a state-of-the-art report on the use of these catalysts in aliphatic C-H oxidation, olefin epoxidation and alkene syn-dihydroxylation, under substrate-limiting conditions. A special focus is given on the main strategies elaborated to tune catalyst activity and selectivity by modification of its structure. The work is concluded by a concise discussion on the essential progresses of these oxidation catalysts together with the challenges that remain still to be tackled.									112	1	0	0	14	0	112			0949-8257	1432-1327		WOS:000396872600016	28124122

The rational design of photocatalysts considering both aspects has established significant importance due to the fascinating advantages of superior charge carrier transport/transfer and photocatalytic performances. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), a captivating metal-free and visible light-active photocatalyst, has drawn interdisciplinary attention in the field of solar energy conversion and pollutant degradation because of its appropriate electronic band structure, excellent physicochemical stability, facile synthesis, and unique layered structure. The g-C3N4-based low-dimensional heterostructures demonstrate various mechanisms for photogenerated charge carrier transfer including type I heterojunction, type II heterojunction, p-n heterojunction, Z-scheme heterojunction, Schottky junction, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect. Herein, the state-of-the-art g-C3N4-based low-dimensional heterostructure photocatalysts are analyzed to provide an insightful outlook with respect to doping and defect engineering, band structures tuning, and charged carrier dynamics to realize enhanced visible light absorption, improved photoinduced charge carrier transport/transfer, and spatially separated electron-hole pairs for improved photocatalytic performances. Furthermore, the potential application of g-C3N4-based low-dimensional heterostructures for water splitting, CO2 reduction, and pollutant degradation is also presented. Finally, conclusion and invigorating perspective about challenges and opportunities for advanced design of g-C3N4-based low-dimensional heterostructures are briefed.									49	1	0	0	4	0	49			2367-198X			WOS:000500052600001		
J	Costentin, Cyrille; Porter, Thomas R.; Saveant, Jean-Michel								Conduction and Reactivity in Heterogeneous-Molecular Catalysis: New Insights in Water Oxidation Catalysis by Phosphate Cobalt Oxide Films								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY				138	17			5615	5622		10.1021/jacs.6b00737				MAY 4 2016	2016	Cyclic voltammetry of phosphate cobalt oxide (CoPi) films catalyzing O-2-evolution from water oxidation as a function of scan rate, phosphate concentration and film thickness allowed for new insights into the coupling between charge transport and catalysis. At pH = 7 and low buffer concentrations, the film is insulating below 0.8 (V vs SHE) but becomes conductive above 0.9 (V vs SHE). Between 1.0 to 1.3 (V vs SHE), the mesoporous structure of the film gives rise to a large thickness-dependent capacitance. At higher buffer concentrations, two reversible proton-coupled redox couples appear over the capacitive response with 0.94 and 1.19 (V vs SHE) pH = 7 standard potentials. The latter is, at most, very weakly catalytic and not responsible for the large catalytic current observed at higher potentials. CV-response analysis showed that the amount of redox-active cobalt-species in the film is small, less than 10% of total. The catalytic process involves a further proton-coupled-electron-transfer and is so fast that it is controlled by diffusion of phosphate, the catalyst cofactor. CV-analysis with newly derived relationships led to a combination of the catalyst standard potential with the catalytic rate constant and a lower-limit estimation of these parameters. The large currents resulting from the fast catalytic reaction result in significant potential losses related to charge transport through the film. CoPi films appear to combine molecular catalysis with semiconductor-type charge transport. This mode of heterogeneous molecular catalysis is likely to occur in many other catalytic films.									89	2	0	0	10	0	89			0002-7863			WOS:000375521100027	26981886

The development of a cheap, albeit active, catalyst to splitwater at a substantial overpotential with long durability is a perdurablechallenge. Moreover, understanding the nature of surface-active species underelectrochemical conditions remains fundamentally important. A facile hydro-thermal approach is herein adapted to prepare covellite (hexagonal) phase CuSnanoplates. In the covellite CuS lattice, copper is present in a mixed-valent state,supported by two different binding energy values (932.10 eV for CuIand 933.65eV for CuII) found in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, and adoptedtwo different geometries, that is, trigonal planar preferably for CuIandtetrahedral preferably for CuII. The as-synthesized covellite CuS behaves as anefficient electro(pre)catalyst for alkaline water oxidation while deposited on aglassy carbon and nickel foam (NF) electrodes. Under cyclic voltammetrycycles, covellite CuS electrochemically and irreversibly oxidized to CuO, indicated by a redox feature at 1.2 V (vs the reversiblehydrogen electrode) and anex situRaman study. Electrochemically activated covellite CuS to the CuO phase (termed as CuSEA)behaves as a pure copper-based catalyst showing an overpotential (eta) of only 349 (+/- 5) mV at a current density of 20 mA cm-2, andthe TOF value obtained at eta 349(at 349 mV) is 1.1x10-3s-1. A lowRctof 5.90 Omega and a moderate Tafel slope of 82 mV dec-1confirm the fair activity of the CuSEAcatalyst compared to the CuS precatalyst, reference CuO, and other reported copper catalysts.Notably, the CuSEA/NF anode can deliver a constant current of ca. 15 mA cm-2over a period of 10 h and even a high currentdensity of 100 mA cm-2for 1 h. Post-oxygen evolution reaction (OER)-chronoamperometric characterization of the anode viaseveral spectroscopic and microscopic toolsfirmly establishes the formation of crystalline CuO as the active material along withsome amorphous Cu(OH)2via bulk reconstruction of the covellite CuS under electrochemical conditions. Given the promisingOER activity, the CuSEA/NF anode can be fabricated as a water electrolyzer, Pt(-)//(+)CuSEA/NF, that delivers ajof 10 mA cm-2at a cell potential of 1.58 V. The same electrolyzer can further be used for electrochemical transformation of organic feedstocks likeethanol, furfural, and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural to their respective acids. The present study showcases that a highly active CuO/Cu(OH)2heterostructure can be constructedin situon NF from the covellite CuS nanoplate, which is not only a superior purecopper-based electrocatalyst active for OER and overall water splitting but also for the electro-oxidation of industrial feedstocks.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000779822100019	35293211

The synthesis involves the use of silver nitrate, gelatin, dextrose and water as the silver precursor, stabilizing agent, reducing agent and solvent respectively. By varying the reaction time, the temporal evolution of the growth, optical, antimicrobial and sensing properties of the as-synthesised Ag-NPs were investigated. The nanoparticles were characterized using UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). The absorption maxima of the assynthesized materials at different reaction time showed characteristic silver surface plasmon resonance (S PR) peak. The as-synthesised Ag-NPs show better antibacterial efficacy than the antibiotics; ciproflaxin and imipenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) of 6 mu g/mL, and better efficacy than imipenem against Escherichia coli with MIC of 10 mu g/mL. The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the as-synthesised Ag-NPs is 12.5 mu g/mL. The sensitivity of the dextrose reduced gelatin-capped Ag-NPs towards hydrogen peroxide indicated that the sensor has a very good sensitivity and a linear response over wide concentration range of 10(-1)-10(-6) M H2O2.

In addition to their basic carbon skeleton, they differ from one another in their functional groups. Functional groups attached to the carbon skeleton are the basis of the terpenoids' diverse properties. Further modifications of terpene olefins include the introduction of acyl-, aryl-, or sugar moieties and usually start with oxidations catalyzed by cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s, CYPs). P450s are ubiquitously distributed throughout nature, involved in essential biological pathways such as terpenoid biosynthesis as well as the tailoring of terpenoids and other natural products. Their ability to introduce oxygen into nonactivated C-H bonds is unique and makes P450s very attractive for applications in biotechnology. Especially in the field of terpene oxidation, biotransformation methods emerge as an attractive alternative to classical chemical synthesis. For this reason, microbial P450s depict a highly interesting target for protein engineering approaches in order to increase selectivity and activity, respectively. Microbial P450s have been described to convert industrial and pharmaceutically interesting terpenoids such as ionones, limone, valencene, resin acids, and triterpenes (including steroids) as well as vitamin D-3. Highly selective and active mutants have been evolved by applying classical site-directed mutagenesis as well as directed evolution of proteins. As P450s usually depend on electron transfer proteins, mutagenesis has also been applied to improve the interactions between P450s and their respective redox partners. This chapter provides an overview of terpenoid hydroxylation reactions catalyzed by bacterial P450s and highlights the achievements made by protein engineering to establish productive hydroxylation processes.									45	1	1	0	31	0	46			0724-6145	1616-8542	978-3-319-20107-8; 978-3-319-20106-1	WOS:000365223100009	25682070

Turnover depends primarily upon the rate of cytochrome a(3) reduction. When prokaryotic cytochrome c-552 oxidase (ba(3)) of Thermus thermophilus turns over, three different metal centres (cytochromes b, a(3) and CuA) share the steady state electrons; it is the fourth, CuB, that apparently remains almost fully oxidized until anaerobiosis. Cytochrome a(3) stays partially reduced during turnover and a possible P/F state may also be populated. Cyanide traps the aerobic ba(3) CuB centre in the a(3)(2-)CNCuB(2+) state; the corresponding eukaryotic cyanide trapped state is a(3)(3+)CNCuB(+). Both states become the fully reduced a(3)(2-)CNCuB(-) upon anaerobiosis.The different reactivities of the aa(3) and ba(3) binuclear centres may be correlated with the very different proximal histidine epsilonN-Fe distances in the two enzymes (3.3 Angstrom for ba(3) compared to 1.9 Angstrom for aa(3)) which may in turn relate to the functioning of thermophilic Thermus cytochrome ba(3) in vivo at a very elevated temperature. But the differences may also just exemplify how evolution can find surprisingly different solutions to the common problem of electron transfer to oxygen. Some of these alternatives were potentially enshrined in a model of the oxidase reaction already adopted by Gerry Babcock in the early 1990s. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Glycolaldehyde prepared in situ by heating ethylene glycol solvent at 160 degrees C for 2 h, was utilized as the reducing agent. The relative ratio of the two surfactants was manipulated to achieve different Cu2O morphologies, e.g. nanocrystalline Cu2O flowers, hollow spheres consisting of holes and ring type structure. The FT-IR spectroscopy confirmed that the SDS and Tween 80 moieties were indeed present on the surface as capping agents in order to stabilize the surface nanocrystallites by the co-ordinative interactions between the oxygen atoms of Tween 80 and SDS and the Cu atoms at the surface of the synthesized Cu2O particles. These oxygen atoms eventually encourage the oxidation of the surface Cu atoms to form a thin CuO layer, presence of which on the surface was corroborated by the XPS measurements. Sputtering of the samples was also carried out to remove the surface CuO thin layer and expose the inner Cu2O. These nanomaterials were then investigated for their potential applications in photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B dye. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM.

In the wild type tobacco these three reactions are driven by three populations of photosynthetic units different with respect to the antenna size. The antenna size of O-2-evolving units is twice as large compared to the N-2-evolving one, but both of these have the same spectral characteristics in the far red region. In contrast to the wild type, the antenna sizes of O-2- and N-2-evolving units in the chlorophyll b-deficient tobacco mutant Su/su var. Aurea are the same as the sizes of the N-2-evolving units in the wild type chloroplasts. Taking into account the data of Thielen and Van Gorkom [Biochim. Biophys. Acta (1981) 635:111] on a strong difference in the relative amounts of PSIIalpha and PSIIbeta in the mutant compared with the wild type (the ratio about 1:3 and 3:1, respectively) it is concluded that mainly the stroma-exposed PSIIbeta units are competent to N-2-evolution.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0032-0781			WOS:A1994PA38000019

Herein, in this study, we rationally designed and prepared a novel flowerlike multifunctional cascade nanoreactor, BSA-GOx@MnO2@FePt (BGMFP), by integrating glucose oxidase (GOx), manganese dioxide (MnO2) and FePt for synergetic cancer treatment with satisfying therapeutic efficiency. In an acidic environment, intratumoral H2O2 could be decomposed to O-2 to accelerate the consumption of glucose catalyzed by GOx to induce cancer starvation. Moreover, the accumulation of gluconic acid and H2O2 generated along with the consumption of glucose would in turn promote the catalytic efficiency of MnO2 and boost O-2 evolution, which could enhance the efficiency of starvation therapy. Moreover, FePt as an excellent Fenton agent could simultaneously convert H2O2 to the toxic hydroxyl radical (OH), subsequently resulting in amplified intracellular oxidative stress and cell apoptosis. Therefore, BGMFP could catalyze a cascade of intracellular biochemical reactions and optimize the unique properties of MnO2, GOx and FePt via mutual promotion of each other to realize O-2 supply, chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and starvation therapy. The anticancer results in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that BGMFP possessed remarkable tumor inhibition capacity through enhancing the starvation therapy and CDT. It is appreciated that BGMFP could be a promising platform for synergetic cancer treatment.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			2050-750X	2050-7518		WOS:000698372000001	34553729

The GRAINOBLE model								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				538						A42	10.1051/0004-6361/201117802				FEB 2012	2012	Context. Mantles of iced water mixed with carbon monoxyde, formaldehyde, and methanol are formed during the so-called prestellar core phase. In addition, radicals are also thought to be formed on the grain surfaces, and to react to form complex organic molecules later on, during the so-called warm-up phase of the protostellar evolution.Aims. We aim to study the formation of the grain mantles during the prestellar core phase and the abundance of formaldehyde, methanol, and radicals trapped in them.Methods. We have developed a macrosopic statistic multilayer model that follows the formation of grain mantles with time and that includes two effects that may increase the number of radicals trapped in the mantles: i) during the mantle formation, only the surface layer is chemically active and not the entire bulk; and ii) the porous structure of grains allows the trapping reactive particles. The model considers a network of H, O, and CO forming neutral species such as water, CO, formaldehyde, and methanol, plus several radicals. We ran a large grid of models to study the impact of the mantle multilayer nature and grain porous structure. In addition, we explored how the uncertainty of other key parameters influences the mantle composition.Results. Our model predicts relatively high abundances of radicals, especially of HCO and CH3O (10(-9)-10(-7)). In addition, the multilayer approach enables us to follow the chemical differentiation within the grain mantle, showing that the mantles are far from being uniform. For example, methanol is mostly present in the outer layers of the mantles, whereas CO and other reactive species are trapped in the inner layers. The overall mantle composition depends on the density and age of the prestellar core as well as on some microscopic parameters, such as the diffusion energy and the hydrogenation reactions activation energy. Comparison with observations allows us to constrain the value of the last two parameters (0.5-0.65 and 1500 K, respectively) and provide some indications on the physical conditions during the formation of the ices.									103	2	0	0	1	0	103			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000300614100042

However, splitting water into hydrogen with high performance by a single semiconductor is challenging because of the poor charge separation efficiency. Herein, a novel ternary Cu@TiO2-Cu2O hybrid photocatalyst with multiple charge transfer channels has been designed for efficient solar-to-hydrogen evolution. Indeed, the ternary Cu@TiO2-Cu2O hybrid by coupling Cu@TiO2 with Cu2O nanoparticles shows highly-efficient photocatalytic hydrogen generation with rate of 12000.6 lmol.g(-1).h(-1), which is 4.4, 2.1, and 1.9 times higher than the pure TiO2 (2728.8 lmol.g(-1).h(-1)), binary Cu@TiO2 (5595.5 lmol.g(-1).h(-1)), and TiO2-Cu2O (6076.8 lmol.g(-1).h(-1)) composite, respectively. In such a Cu@TiO2-Cu2O hybrid, the formed internal electric field in the TiO2-Cu2O p-n junction allows the electrons in Cu2O to migrate to TiO2, while the electrons in the CB of TiO2 could flow into Cu via the Schottky junction at the Cu@TiO2 interface. In this regard, a multiple charge transfer is achieved between the Cu@TiO2 and Cu2O, which facilitates promoted charge separation and results in the construction of electron-accumulated center (Cu) and hole-enriched surface (Cu2O). This p-n/Schottky junctions with steered charge transfer assists the hydrogen production upon the Cu@TiO2-Cu2O ternary photocatalyst. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

J	Gotz, T; Sandmann, G; Romer, S								Expression of a bacterial carotene hydroxylase gene (crtZ) enhances UV tolerance in tobacco								PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY				50	1			129	142		10.1023/A:1016072218801				SEP 2002	2002	Carotenoids are essential components of the photosynthetic apparatus involved in plant photoprotection. To investigate the protective role of zeaxanthin under high light and UV stress we have increased the capacity for its biosynthesis in tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Samsun) by transformation with a heterologous carotenoid gene encoding beta-carotene hydroxylase (crtZ) from Erwinia uredovora under constitutive promoter control. This enzyme is responsible for the conversion of beta-carotene into zeaxanthin. Although the total pigment content of the transgenics was similar to control plants, the transformants synthesized zeaxanthin more rapidly and in larger quantities than controls upon transfer to high-intensity white light. Low-light-adapted tobacco plants were shown to be susceptible to UV exposure and therefore chosen for comparative analysis of wild-type and transgenics. Overall effects of UV irradiation were studied by measuring bioproductivity and pigment content. The UV exposed transformed plants maintained a higher biomass and a greater amount of photosynthetic pigments than controls. For revelation of direct effects, photosynthesis, pigment composition and chlorophyll fluorescence were examined immediately after UV treatment. Low-light-adapted plants of the crtZ transgenics showed less reduction in photosynthetic oxygen evolution and had higher chlorophyll fluorescence levels in comparison to control plants. After 1 h of high-light pre-illumination and subsequent UV exposure a greater amount of xanthophyll cycle pigments was retained in the transformants. In addition, the transgenic plants suffered less lipid peroxidation than the wild-type after treatment with the singlet-oxygen generator rose bengal. Our results indicate that an enhancement of zeaxanthin formation in the presence of a functional xanthophyll cycle contributes to UV stress protection and prevention of UV damage.									65	13	0	0	65	1	81			0167-4412	1573-5028		WOS:000176415000010	12139004	
J	Lindell, David; Ekman, Thomas; Pettersson, Rachel								Fast and Efficient Annealing of Stainless Steel Strip Using Oxyfuel Burners								STEEL RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL				86	5			557	566		10.1002/srin.201400168				MAY 2015	2015	Pilot plant and annealing experiments have been conducted to study the effect of the higher water content in oxyfuel annealing on oxidation and pickling of cold rolled stainless steel. The experiments were conducted on the austenitic grade AISI 304 in a propane-fired furnace using air and pure oxygen as oxidizers. The experiments were conducted at 1050-1200 degrees C for typically less than 60 s, in order to simulate industrial annealing of thin strip. Supplementary laboratory annealing trials were made to study the evolution of the microstructure during fast heating rates and short hold times. Increasing the water content from 15 to 50 mol% did not alter the oxidation kinetics or the chemistry of the oxide. Since the oxidation is not altered significantly, the pickling performance of the material remains unchanged. The presence of spalled areas increased the pickling efficiency significantly but this was only seen for material annealed at higher temperature compared to industrial practice. Oxyfuel combustion allows higher heat input and therefore faster heating. The 304 grade recrystallizes readily even at moderate cold rolling reductions so the total annealing time can be reduced substantially if the heating rate can be increased. The present work suggests that this can be done without any downstream effects.									3	1	0	0	0	0	4			1611-3683	1869-344X		WOS:000354202500012

Three distinct regimes of behavior are observed; at low x, 24% < x < 29% range, the modifier largely polymerizes the backbone, T-g(x) increase, features that we identify with the stressed-rigid elastic phase. At high x, 32% < x < 48% range, the modifier depolymerizes the network by creating non-bridging oxygen (NBO) atoms; in this regime T-g(x) decreases, and networks are viewed to be in the flexible elastic phase. In the narrow intermediate x regime, 29% < x < 32% range, T-g(x) shows a broad global maximum almost independent of x, and Raman mode scattering strengths and mode frequencies become relatively x-independent, V-m(x) show a global minimum, features that we associate with the isostatically rigid elastic phase, also called the intermediate phase. In this phase, medium range structures adapt as revealed by the count of Lagrangian bonding constraints and Raman mode scattering strengths.

Electrooxidation technology is a promising process for sulfide removal in aqueous media due to its high efficiency, cost effectiveness and easy operation. This study employed atomic nickel dispersed on nitrogen-doped graphene catalyst (A-Ni-NG) with stainless steel (SS) substrate for efficient sulfide removal. The results showed that the highest sulfide removal efficiency of 85.02 +/- 1.25% was achieved on SS/A-Ni-NG anode at 1.98 V (vs. RHE) in 48 h, which was 11.17% and 24.18% higher than that of bare SS and FTO/A-Ni-NG, respectively. SS/A-Ni-NG catalyst achieved a first-order rate constant of 0.036 +/- 0.001 h-1, improved by 24% compared with bare SS. The main products of sulfide oxidation were thiosulfate and elemental sulfur with Faradic efficiency of 32.37 +/- 3.20% and 18.99 +/- 0.05%, respectively. Electrochemical analysis showed the sulfide oxidation anodic peak potential on SS/A-Ni-NG anode was 280 mV (vs. RHE), lower than most of the reported graphite or Ni anodes. SS/A-Ni-NG improved the interface electric conductivity and the charge transfer rate, and directly catalyzed sulfide oxidation at applied voltage below oxygen evolution reaction (OER) onset potential. A-Ni-NG also indirectly removed sulfide by boosting OER at higher voltage. The superior sulfide oxidation catalytic activity of SS/A-Ni-NG anode was mainly attributed to the atomic dispersed Ni(I) generating NiOOH that boosted OER process and to the dopant N that induced activation region. A-Ni-NG coated on SS substrate is demonstrated to be a promising material for electrochemical sulfide removal.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000729139100005

However, available data solely focus on colonic inflammation while the primary disease location in Crohn's disease patients is the terminal ileum. Therefore, we explored the effects of environmental hypoxia and immune cell-specific deletion of oxygen sensor prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) 1 in a Crohn's like ileitis mouse model. Five-week-old TNF (increment ARE/+) mice and wildtype (WT) littermates were housed in normoxia (21% O-2) or hypoxia (8% O-2) for 10 weeks. Although environmental hypoxia increased both systemic as ileal markers of hypoxia, the body weight evolution in both WT and TNF (increment ARE/+) mice was not affected. Interestingly, hypoxia did increase circulatory monocytes, ileal mononuclear phagocytes and proinflammatory cytokine expression in WT mice. However, no histological or inflammatory gene expression differences in the ileum could be identified between TNF (increment ARE/+) mice housed in hypoxia versus normoxia nor between TNF (increment ARE/+) and WT mice with additional loss of immune cell-specific Phd1 expression. This is the first study showing that long-term environmental hypoxia or haematopoietic Phd1-deletion does not impact experimental ileitis. Therefore, it strongly questions whether targeting hypoxia-induced signalling via currently available PHD inhibitors would exert an immune suppressive effect in IBD patients with ileal inflammation. Environmental hypoxia and hypoxia-induced signalling in the gut influence inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis, however data is limited to colitis. Hence, we investigated the effect of environmental hypoxia and immune cell-specific deletion of oxygen sensor prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) 1 in a Crohn's like ileitis mouse model. Therefore, 5-week-old C57/BL6 TNF (increment ARE/+) mice and wildtype (WT) littermates were housed in normoxia (21% O-2) or hypoxia (8% O-2) for 10 weeks. Systemic inflammation was assessed by haematology. Distal ileal hypoxia was evaluated by pimonidazole staining. The ileitis degree was scored on histology, characterized via qPCR and validated in haematopoietic Phd1-deficient TNF (increment ARE/+) mice. Our results demonstrated that hypoxia did not impact body weight evolution in WT and TNF (increment ARE/+) mice. Hypoxia increased red blood cell count, haemoglobin, haematocrit and increased pimonidazole intensity in the ileum. Interestingly, hypoxia evoked an increase in circulatory monocytes, ileal mononuclear phagocytes and proinflammatory cytokine expression in WT mice. Despite these alterations, no histological or ileal gene expression differences could be identified between TNF (increment ARE/+) mice housed in hypoxia versus normoxia nor between haematopoietic Phd1-deficient TNF (increment ARE/+) and their WT counterparts. Therefore, we demonstrated for the first time that long-term environmental hypoxia or haematopoietic Phd1-deletion does not impact experimental ileitis development.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2079-7737		WOS:000699322700001	34571764

It could also be used as a passivation layer, especially on the back side of the cell.This work deals with the passivation effect obtained on silicon surface by SiON layer deposited by Low Frequency Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition (LF-PECVD). SiON layers of different compositions have been deposited by varying the gas flow mixture (NH3, SiH4 and N2O) in the reactor. Infrared and X-ray photon-electron spectroscopy were made to determine the chemical structure of SiON layer. Minority carrier lifetimes were measured by the photoconductance decay method (PCD) before and after a rapid thermal anneal. Effective lifetime, measured on 5 Omega cm FZ-silicon wafers, can reach up to several hundreds microseconds, depending on the stoichiometry of the SiON layer. Low oxygen content samples (close to SiN layer) exhibit a good surface passivation of 250 mu s but after annealing, this value is critically reduced to 6 mu s. The opposite situation is observed for oxygen-rich layers: the effective lifetime increases from 10 mu s to 150 mu s. These behaviours could be partly explained by the composition of SiON, the evolution of the main peaks values of the FTIR spectra and the disappearance of Si-H bonds with anneal.

Azotobacter vinelandii, an obligate aerobe, fixes nitrogen via the oxygen-sensitive Mo nitrogenase but is also able to fix nitrogen through the activities of genetically distinct alternative forms of nitrogenase designated the Vnf and Anf systems when Mo is limiting. The Vnf system appears to replace Mo with V, and the Anf system is thought to contain Fe as the only transition metal within the respective active site metallocofactors. Prior genetic analyses suggest that a number of nif-encoded components are involved in the Vnf and Anf systems. Genome-wide transcription profiling of A. vinelandii cultured under nitrogen-fixing conditions under various metal amendments (e.g., Mo or V) revealed the discrete complement of genes associated with each nitrogenase system and the extent of cross talk between the systems. In addition, changes in transcript levels of genes not directly involved in N-2 fixation provided insight into the integration of central metabolic processes and the oxygen-sensitive process of N-2 fixation in this obligate aerobe. The results underscored significant differences between Mo-dependentand Mo-independent diazotrophic growth that highlight the significant advantages of diazotrophic growth in the presence of Mo.									72	1	0	0	67	1	76			0021-9193	1098-5530		WOS:000293788300018	21724999

Among air-breathing vertebrates, modifications of hemoglobin (Hb) play a pivotal role in mediating an adaptive response to high-altitude hypoxia. However, the relative contributions in water-breathing organisms are still unclear. Here, we tested the Hb concentration of fish at different altitudes. All species showed speciesspecific Hb concentration, which has a non-positive correlation with altitude. Moreover, we investigated the expression of Hb genes by the RNA-seq and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and Hb composition by twodimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). The results showed that the multiple Hb genes and isoforms are co-expressed in schizothoracinae fishes endemic to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). Phylogenetic analyses of Hb genes indicated that the evolutionary relationships are not easily reconciled with the organismal phylogeny. Furthermore, evidence of positive selection was found in the Hb genes of schizothoracinae fishes through the selection pressure analysis. We demonstrated that positively selected sites likely facilitated the functional divergence of Hb isoforms. Taken together, this study indicated that the long-term maintenance of high Hb concentration may be a disadvantage for physiologically acclimating to high altitude hypoxia. Meanwhile, the genetically based modification of Hb-O2 affinity in schizothoracinae fishes might facilitate the evolutionary adaptation to Tibetan aqueous environments.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0141-8130	1879-0003		WOS:000679988500006	34214574

Meanwhile, the nanostructure of CeO2-NiCoPx is well preserved after a long-term electrocatalytic process (100 h) at a large current density of 100 mA cm(-2) (j(100)). When the CeO2-NiCoPx/NCF simultaneously acts as the HER and OER electrodes, the potential of 1.49 V is obtained for transferring j(10) with an excellent durability. Theoretical simulations and in operando Raman spectroscopy reveal that the Co and Ni atoms for CeO2-NiCoPx/NCF catalyst are likely to act as the pivotal reaction centers for HER and OER processes, respectively.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000841427900003

Here, we propose that core residues in the large enzyme family, the haloalkanoic acid dehalogenase enzyme superfamily (HADSF) form a "mold" in which the trigonal bipyramidal transition states formed during phosphoryl transfer are stabilized by electrostatic forces. The vanadate complex of the hexose phosphate phosphatase BT4131 from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482 (HPP) determined at 1.00 angstrom resolution via X-ray crystallography assumes a trigonal bipyramidal coordination geometry with the nucleophilic Asp-8 and one oxygen ligand at the apical position. Remarkably, the tungstate in the complex determined to 1.03 angstrom resolution assumes the same coordination geometry. The contribution of the general acid/base residue Asp-10 in the stabilization of the trigonal bipyramidal species via hydrogen-bond formation with the apical oxygen atom is evidenced by the 1.52 angstrom structure of the D10A mutant bound to vanadate. This structure shows a collapse of the trigonal bipyramidal geometry with displacement of the water molecule formerly occupying the apical position. Furthermore, the 1.07 angstrom resolution structure of the D10A mutant complexed with tungstate shows the tungstate to be in a typical "phosphate-like" tetrahedral configuration. The analysis of 12 liganded HADSF structures deposited in the protein data bank (PDB) identified stringently conserved elements that stabilize the trigonal bipyramidal transition states by engaging in favorable electrostatic interactions with the axial and equatorial atoms of the transferring phosphoryl group.									54	0	0	0	45	0	54			0027-8424			WOS:000255237200009	18398008

Developing efficient water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) has recently been of paramount interest. Ruthenium-based WOCs have gained much attention due to their enriched redox property, robust nature, and superior catalytic performances compared to other transition metal-based molecular catalysts. The performance of a catalyst is highly dependent on the design of the ligand framework. In nature, the secondary coordination sphere around the active site of a metalloenzyme plays a vital role in catalysis. This principle has been employed in the recent development of efficient catalysts. With the aid of secondary interactions, some landmark Ru-based WOCs, producing remarkable turnover frequencies (TOFs) in the order of 10(4) s(-1), have been developed. In this account, we have discussed the underlying chemistry related to the effect of secondary interactions (such as hydrogen-bonding, pi-pi stacking, electrostatic interaction, hydrophobic-hydrophilic environment, etc.) on the kinetics of the water oxidation reaction catalysed by molecular Ru-complexes. The use of secondary interactions (such as pi-pi and C-HMIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS pi) in anchoring the molecular catalyst onto the solid conducting surface has also been discussed.

Electrolysis experiments at a fixed applied potential of 1.1 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) established that the NiOx-en films sustain a stable current of 1.8 mA cm(-2) for extended periods, compared with 1.2 mA cm(-2) for films derived from [Ni(OH2)(6)](NO3)(2) and [Ni(NH3)(6)]Cl-2 when tested in a 0.60 M NaBi buffer. XAS studies indicate that the gamma-NiOOH phase is formed in each case whereas SEM studies revealed significant differences in film morphology. The NiOx-en films were found to be more homogenous and to have a higher electroactive surface area, as determined from capacitance measurements. The results highlight the influence that the choice of molecular precursor can have on the activity and robustness of electrodeposited NiOx water oxidation catalysts.									205	9	1	0	13	0	207			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000313892400020

In this report, we provide distinctive insights into the biological-biochemical function of KatB at the molecular level. Anabaena overexpressing the wild-type KatB protein (KatBWT) detoxified H2O2 efficiently, showing reduced burden of reactive oxygen species compared with the strain overproducing KatBF2V (wherein F-2 is replaced by V). Correspondingly, the KatBWT protein also displayed several folds more activity than KatBF2V. Interestingly, the KatB variants with large hydrophobic amino acids (F/W/Y) were more compact, showed enhanced activity, and were resistant to thermal/chemical denaturation than variants with smaller residues (G/A/V) at the second position. X-ray crystallography-based analysis showed that F-2 was required for appropriate interactions between two subunits. These contacts provided stability to the hexamer, making it more compact. F-2, through its interaction with F-66 and W-43, formed the proper hydrophobic pocket that held the active site together. Consequently, only residues that supported activity (i.e., F/Y/W) were selected at the second position in Mn-catalases during evolution. This study (a) demonstrates that modification of nonactive site residues can alter the response of catalases to environmental stress and (b) has expanded the scope of amino acids that can be targeted for rational protein engineering in plants.									9	0	0	0	9	0	9			0140-7791	1365-3040		WOS:000477913300015	30993731

Herein, one-dimensional polycrystalline nanoneedles composed of CoO-Co9S8 nano heterostructures, in situ grown on carbon fiber paper are prepared for efficient overall water electrolysis. Due to strong electronic coupling, charge densities of Co2+/Co3+ in Co9S8 and Co2+ in CoO are favorably modified at the interface of CoO and Co9S8, resulting in optimized reaction intermediates absorption and greatly enhanced bifunctional HER/OER activities. CoO-Co9S8/CFP delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline electrolyte at overpotentials of 184 mV and 270 mV for HER and OER, respectively. When used as electrocatalyst for overall water splitting, it needs a low cell potential of 1.66 V to realize water electrolysis at 10 mA cm(-2). This work provides a new strategy to tune the electronic structures of transitional metal active sites via constructing nano heterostructures for efficient water electrolysis.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2196-0216			WOS:000756807700012

However, the effect of MoS2 on the oxygen adsorption has been investigated only a few times thus far. In this work, we first studied the adsorbability of O-2 by MoS2 through the analysis of Li2O2 growth on the surface of flower-like MoS2 microspheres with different concentrations of sulfur vacancies, which can be applied as the highly active electrocatalysts for Li-O-2 batteries. The enhancement of battery performance for the Def-MoS2@CTs (CTs = carbon textile substrates) with a larger concentration of sulfur vacancies (S/Mo = 1.61) can be achieved. The experimental and theoretical results confirm that the sulfur vacancies play a crucial role in the adsorption process and thus affect the morphology and nucleation of Li2O2. In addition, a fundamental catalytic mechanism for this adsorption process is also proposed. These results provide a new insight into the development of a highly active electrocatalyst by introducing a large concentration of defects for Li-O-2 batteries.									29	3	0	0	4	0	29			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000458085900050	30633516

High catalytic rates were especially observed for birnessites which contain calcium as part of their structures. With the aim to systematically improve the catalytic performance of such oxide materials, we used a flexible synthetic route to prepare three series of calcium birnessites, where we varied the calcium concentrations, the ripening times of the original precipitates and the temperature of the heat treatment following the initial synthetic steps (tempering) during the preparation process. The products were carefully analysed by a number of analytical techniques and then probed for WOC activity using the Ce4+-system. We find that our set of twenty closely related manganese oxides shows large, but somewhat systematic alterations in catalytic rates, indicating the importance of synthesis parameters for maximum catalytic performance. The catalyst of the series for which the highest water-oxidation rate was found is a birnessite of medium calcium content (Ca : Mn ratio 0.2 : 1) that had been subjected to a tempering temperature of 400 degrees C. On the basis of the detailed analysis of the results, a WOC reaction scheme for birnessites is proposed to explain the observed trends in reactivity.									98	2	0	0	14	0	99			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000332389700024	24225769

In this process, synthetic lead wastewater with low concentration of 4, 8, 12 and 16 mg/L was treated, more than 67% lead was recovered from wastewater and a PbO2/Ti electrode was fabricated in a simple reaction tank. The test results of characterizations confirmed that PbO2 nano-eletrocatalyst was successfully deposited on a Ti substrate. Electrochemical activity tests indicated that PbO2/Ti electrode had advantages of high oxygen evolution potential (1.90 V) and low electron transfer resistance. Furthermore, the results of electrocatalytic degradation experiments demonstrated that prepared PbO2/Ti electrode had the superb decolorization and mineralization ability on Basic Red. After 120 min of electrolysis, the Basic Red removal efficiency and TOC removal efficiency could reach to 89.38% and 68.82%, respectively, which was 5.2 and 7.1 times higher than the Ti substrate alone. Besides, the calculated mineralization current efficiency for PbO2/Ti electrode increased from 5.18% to 36.74% after PbO2 depositing, and thus an economical benefit was obtained by more than 5 times energy saving. The influences of the applied current density, initial dye concentration, electrolyte concentration and solution pH on the oxidation efficiency were also investigated and optimized. The prepared PbO2/Ti electrode also showed a great stability with high dye removal efficiency (above 85%) after 10 times repeated experiments. These results suggest that it is a promising technological process to remove and recover lead from low-concentration wastewater efficiently and reuse them as electrocatalyst for other organic wastewater treatments.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1533-4880	1533-4899		WOS:000528206000099	32331193

TiO2 nanowires (TNWs) as one dimensional nanostructures offer several merits including large area to volume ratio and improved electron transport properties. In this study CoFe-CO3 layered double hydroxide (LDH) was used as a photosensitizer to decorate the surface of TNWs with different weight ratios (LDH: TNWs = 0: 1, 0.25: 1, 0.5: 1, 1: 1 and LDH). TEM images indicated that the layered structure of LDH was not formed for all samples except for the 1:1. This is attributed to the partial incorporation of Co and Fe ions into the titanate structure thereby deteriorating the Co: Fe minimum ratio for layered structure formation. Adding LDH extended the absorption range of TNWs to the entire visible range and decreased the band gap to 2.57 eV. Co-Fe LDH shifted the onset potentials for both the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions by 220 and 330 mV respectively. At 1 V Vs Ag/AgCl, the anodic current increased by 9.4, 23.45 and 34.32 folds for the 0.25: 1, 0.5: 1 and 1: 1 photoanodes respectively. At -1 V Vs Ag/AgCl, the cathodic current reached 0.25, 0.68, and 0.81 mA/cm(2) for 0.25: 1, 0.5: 1 and 1: 1 samples respectively. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The structure of Li0.78V0.75O2 was identified by Rietveld refinement of the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data. XRD identified that the new Li-V-O compound had a cubic rocksalt structure, in which Li and V were evenly distributed on the octahedral sites in a cubic closely packed lattice of oxygen ions. Li0.78V0.75O2 showed structural evolution from cubic symmetry to thermodynamically stable rhombohedral symmetry LixVyO2 above 800 degrees C. Furthermore, the electrochemical performance of the as-prepared Li0.78V0.75O2 as an anode for Li-ion batteries was studied for the first time. Galvanostatic battery testing showed that the Li0.78V0.75O2 electrode exhibited a large reversible capacity, high rate performance and excellent cycling stability. A reversible capacity of 575 mA h g(-1) was maintained even after 500 cycles at a current density of 500 mA g(-1). Ex situ XRD and XPS studies on the lithiation mechanism of Li0.78V0.75O2 consistently suggested that two single-phase insertion-type lithiation processes proceed during the early stages of lithiation. Hence, a single-phase conversion reaction is followed, along with structural integration. The improved electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the unusual conversion-type lithiation process, which is not consistent with the intercalation process of LixVyO2 reported previously. More importantly, the lithiation and delithiation behavior suggests that the oxidation of V(II) to V(IV) upon cycling produces more suitable sites for Li+ insertion, which contributes to the enhanced specific capacity.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000396146900046		
J	Heckathorn, SA; Coleman, JS; Hallberg, RL								Recovery of net CO2 assimilation after heat stress is correlated with recovery of oxygen-evolving-complex proteins in Zea mays L.								PHOTOSYNTHETICA				34	1			13	20		10.1023/A:1006899314677				1997	1997	Photosystem 2 (PS2) in general, and the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) in particular, is one of the most thermolabile components of photosynthesis, We examined the effects of heat stress on net photosynthetic rate (P-N) and content of several stromal and thylakoid-membrane proteins (including OEC proteins) in maize (Zea mays L.) in order to determine if decreases in P-N during, and especially after, heat stress were correlated with decreases in the content of OEC proteins, The P-N decreased with heat stress in maize, and post-heat stress recovery of P-N required 4 d following the second of two heat-shocks. The decrease in P-N was not the result of stomatal closure. Cellular levels of the 33, 23, and 16 kDa OEC proteins decreased with heat stress, and the decreases were greatest and most closely correlated with decreases in P-N for OEC16. Following the second heat stress, full recovery of OEC levels (especially OEC 16 and 33) coincided with full recovery of P-N, more so than with other photosynthetic proteins examined. For example, decreases in levels of the 32-kDa Q(B)-binding protein of the PS2 reaction center (D1), ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase large subunit, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase were generally smaller than for the OEC proteins and full recovery of these proteins occurred at least 2 d prior to full recovery of photosynthesis, These results are consistent with previous fluorescence and in vitro studies by others in suggesting that heat-related effects on PS2 and the OEC are an important limitation to P-N during heat stress. Additionally, these results suggest that heat-related decreases in the content of OEC proteins may limit post-heat stress recovery of carbon fixation.									21	1	0	0	19	0	21			0300-3604			WOS:A1997YE41400002		
J	COTKIN, SJ; MEDARIS, LG								EVALUATION OF THE CRYSTALLIZATION CONDITIONS FOR THE CALCALKALINE RUSSIAN PEAK INTRUSIVE COMPLEX, KLAMATH MOUNTAINS, NORTHERN CALIFORNIA								JOURNAL OF PETROLOGY				34	3			543	571		10.1093/petrology/34.3.543				JUN 1993	1993	The mid-Jurassic calcalkaline Russian Peak intrusive complex, located in the Klamath Mountains of northern California, consists of an elliptical peridotite-to-quartz diorite suite intruded by two plutons of granodiorite. Several techniques were used to decipher the crystallization conditions for ultramafic rocks, quartz diorite, and granodiorite, including comparison of parageneses with crystallization experiments, application of geothermometers and barometers, and evaluation of phase equilibria. Contact metamorphic assemblages, hornblende barometry, and amphibole substitution schemes indicate that pressures of intrusion were - 3 kbar. Plagioclase and pyroxene thermometry indicate intrusion temperatures of approximately 1000-degrees-C for quartz diorite and less-than-or-equal-to 900-degrees-C for granodiorite. Phase equilibrium analysis for the reaction phlogopite + quartz = K-feldspar + enstatite + H2O, coupled with an estimate of the water-saturated quartz diorite solidus, suggests that the solidus of two-pyroxene quartz diorite was at approximately 780-degrees-C with a mole fraction of water of approximately 0.55. The composition of granodiorite is very similar to that used in several crystallization experiments and indicates a solidus of 700 +/- 25-degrees-C. Estimates of oxygen fugacity, obtained from equilibrium relations of olivine, orthopyroxene, and spinel in ultramafic rocks, magnetite and ilmenite in quartz diorite, and magnetite, K-feldspar, and biotite in quartz diorite and granodiorite are 2.1 2.5 and 1.0-1.3 log units above the quartz-fayalite-magnetite (QFM) buffer for granodiorite and quartz diorite at their respective solidus temperatures; and 1.0-4.0 log units above QFM for ultramafic rocks and quartz diorite at subsolidus temperatures. Thus, the quartz diorite magma was hotter, drier, and slightly reduced relative to the grandiorite magma, differences that set important constraints on the genesis of the Russian Peak magmas. These results also indicate that quartz diorite was undersaturated with respect to H2O as it reached its solidus, a condition that is consistent with the absence of deuteric alteration in this unit. In contrast, granodiorite shows extensive deuteric alteration and features pegmatites, quartz pods, and radial dikes as might be expected for H2O-saturated conditions.Although calcalkaline plutonic complexes present serious difficulties in estimating the intensive parameters of crystallization,judicious application of appropriate methods may result in the successful evaluation of the conditions of crystallization of such complexes.									17	1	0	0	0	0	18			0022-3530			WOS:A1993LK08700005

The as-prepared samples were studied by a variety of characterization techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) combined with energy dispersive X-ray diffraction (EDX), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The UV-vis spectroscopy was used to analyze the evolution of Rhodamine B discoloration in presence of the synthesized phosphate photocatalysts. The XRD, SEM-EDX, TEM, DRS and XPS analyses confirmed the formation of heterojunction structure between both materials, during the process of co-precipitation and ulterior heat treatment. The photocatalytic tests showed that photocatalytic ability of the 70% Bi-Zn-3(PO4)(2) composites was higher than that of pure Zn-3(PO4)(2) and BiPO4 after 1 h of UV-illumination. The obviously enhanced photocatalytic activity of the 70% Bi-Zn-3(PO4)(2) sample could be mainly attributed to the formation of the heterojunction, accelerating the separation of photogenerated charge carriers. A plausible mechanism of the photocatalytic degradation of RhB on Zn-3(PO4)(2)/BiPO4 composites is proposed. The reduction in the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) revealed the mineralization of dye along with color removal. Thus, it can be suggested that the 70% Bi-Zn-3(PO4)(2) can serve as a promising photocatalyst in the degradation of organic contaminants under UV light.									68	1	0	0	18	0	68				2213-3437		WOS:000471644100101

Our focus is on the characterization of protein structure, dynamics and interactions, using sophisticated EPR spectroscopy methods. New developments in pulsed microwave and sweepable cryomagnet technology as well as ultrafast electronics for signal data handling and processing have pushed the limits of EPR spectroscopy to new horizons reaching millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths and 15 T Zeeman fields. Expanding traditional applications to paramagnetic systems, spin-labeling of biomolecules has become a mainstream multifrequency approach in EPR spectroscopy. In the high-frequency/high-field EPR region, sub-micromolar concentrations of nitroxide spin-labeled molecules are now sufficient to characterize reaction intermediates of complex biomolecular processes. This offers promising analytical applications in biochemistry and molecular biology where sample material is often difficult to prepare in sufficient concentration for NMR characterization. For multifrequency EPR experiments on frozen solutions typical sample volumes are of the order of 250 mu L (S-band), 150 mu L (X-band), 10 mu L (Q-band) and 1 mu L (W-band). These are orders of magnitude smaller than the sample volumes required for modern liquid-or solid-state NMR spectroscopy. An important additional advantage of EPR over NMR is the ability to detect and characterize even short-lived paramagnetic reaction intermediates (down to a lifetime of a few ns). Electron-nuclear and electron-electron double-resonance techniques such as electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR), ELDOR-detected NMR, PELDOR (DEER) further improve the spectroscopic selectivity for the various magnetic interactions and their evolution in the frequency and time domains. PELDOR techniques applied to frozen-solution samples of doubly spin-labeled proteins allow for molecular distance measurements ranging up to about 100 angstrom. For disordered frozen-solution samples high-field EPR spectroscopy allows greatly improved orientational selection of the molecules within the laboratory axes reference system by means of the anisotropic electron Zeeman interaction. Single-crystal resolution is approached at the canonical g-tensor orientations-even for molecules with very small g-anisotropies. Unique structural, functional, and dynamic information about molecular systems is thus revealed that can hardly be obtained by other analytical techniques. On the other hand, the limitation to systems with unpaired electrons means that EPR is less widely used than NMR. However, this limitation also means that EPR offers greater specificity, since ordinary chemical solvents and matrices do not give rise to EPR in contrast to NMR spectra. Thus, multifrequency EPR spectroscopy plays an important role in better understanding paramagnetic species such as organic and inorganic radicals, transition metal complexes as found in many catalysts or metalloenzymes, transient species such as light-generated spin-correlated radical pairs and triplets occurring in protein complexes of photosynthetic reaction centers, electron-transfer relays, etc.Special attention is drawn to high-field EPR experiments on photosynthetic reaction centers embedded in specific sugar matrices that enable organisms to survive extreme dryness and heat stress by adopting an anhydrobiotic state.

Here, we design and fabricate three-dimensional ordered macroporous ZnO/ZnFe2O4 inverse opals with binder-free heterojunction interfaces that improve the separation of photogenerated charge carriers. The well-defined ZnO/ZnFe2O4 inverse opal displays a high photoconversion efficiency of 0.81% at 0.38 V versus the RHE without any co-catalyst assistance, which is over 6 times higher than that of the pristine ZnO sample (0.13% at 0.65 V vs. the RHE). Furthermore, the photoanode is quite stable even after 10 h of continuous illumination with a slight photocurrent decay of 4.9% (88.0% loss for the pristine ZnO). The high performances of the ZnO/ZnFe2O4 inverse opals can be attributed to the improved interfacial charge carrier separation based on electrochemical analysis and first-principles calculations. This work may provide more insights into the design of highly efficient photoanodes for photoelectrochemical applications.									64	4	0	0	2	0	65			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000422949700053

The film microstructure, surfacemorphology, and electrical and optical properties were investigated in relation to the annealing temperature (300-600 degrees C), gas atmosphere (argon-hydrogen mixture, argon, nitrogen, vacuum, oxygen, and air) and film thickness (similar to 70-1200 nm). The annealing influenced the carrier concentration and mobility in the films, producing an enlarged effect at higher temperatures, whereas the crystalline quality and surface morphology of the films were nearly unaffected by annealing. The electrical properties of the films markedly degraded after annealing in oxygen and air, and improved when annealed in other gas environments. The largest improvement of the electrical properties was obtained by annealing of films in the argon-hydrogen mixture. The rapid evolution of film properties with thickness was observed in the range of small thicknesses (similar to 70-170 nm). The film properties were nearly unchanged for further increases in the film thickness up to similar to 800 nm, whereas thicker films exhibited degraded electrical properties due to their partial cracking. The effect of the annealing on film electrical properties increased with the decrease in the film thickness. The gas atmosphere (air or nitrogen) during the films cooling to RT after deposition also influenced the electrical properties of films. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The method involves the simulation of an oxidation process, by cyclic voltammetry, by employing potentials in the oxygen evolution reaction region. The method is applicable to organic species whose oxidation is not manifested by a defined oxidation peak at conductive oxide electrodes. The variation of q(fN) for electrodes of nominal composition Ti/RuXSn1-XO2 (x = 0.3, 0.2 and 0.1), Ti/Ir0.3Ti0.7O2 and Ti/Ru0.3Ti0.7O2 in the presence of various concentrations of formaldehyde was analyzed. It was observed that electrodes containing SnO2 are the most active for formaldehyde oxidation. Subsequently, in order to test the validity of the proposed model, galvanostatic electrolyses (40 mA cm(-2)) of two different formaldehyde concentrations (0.10 and 0.01 mol dm(-3)) were performed. The results are in agreement with the proposed model and indicate that this new method can be used to determine the relative activity of conductive oxide electrodes. In agreement with previous studies, it can be concluded that not only the nature of the electrode material, but also the organic species in solution and its concentration are important factors to be considered in the oxidation of organic compounds.					16th Brazillian Symposium of Electrochemistry and Electroanalytical Chemistry16th Brazillian Symposium of Electrochemistry and Electroanalytical Chemistry	APR 15-19, 2007APR 15-19, 2007		Aguas de Lindoia, BRAZILAguas de Lindoia, BRAZIL	6	0	0	0	4	0	6			0103-5053	1678-4790		WOS:000256957100009

Two-step preparation was chosen, where TiO2 nanotube layers, grown in a first instance by anodization of a Ti foil, were gradually loaded with controlled amounts of ZnO using the reactive RF magnetron sputtering. After crystallization annealing, the formerly amorphous TiO2 nanotubes were converted to predominantly anatase crystalline phase, as detected by XRD measurements. The as-prepared nanotubes exhibited a well-aligned columnar structure, 1.6 mu m long and 88 nm in diameter, and a small concentration of oxygen vacancies. Ti2+ and Ti3+ occur along with the Ti4+ state upon sputter-cleaning the layer surfaces from contaminants. The Ti2+ and Ti3+ signals diminish with gradual ZnO loading. As demonstrated by the VB-XPS data, the ZnO loading is accompanied by a slight narrowing of the band gap of the materials. A combined effect of material modification and surface roughness was taken into consideration to explain the evolution of surface super-hydrophilicity of the materials under UV irradiation. The loading process resulted in increasing surface wettability with approx. 33%, and in a drastic extension of activation decay, which clearly points out to the effect of ZnO-TiO2 heterojunctions.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2079-4991		WOS:000582861400001	32977596

The classical model has been the challenge in 1000 L tanks, using a high number of fishes, resulting in high economic cost. In this work, the purpose was to minimize the costs of such tests using in vitro cellular models. In primary cultures of head kidney leucocytes (HKL) immune response to Zymosan A, a type of beta-glucan, was evaluated. The quantification and detection of pro-inflammatory cytokines was done based on both enzymatic activity and ELISA. The activity of phagocyte oxidase and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was measured indirectly through NBT reduction by reactive oxygen species and Griess reaction to nitric oxide, respectively. For detecting pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1 beta, monospecific antibodies generated in our laboratory were used by indirect ELISA. The immune parameters were evaluated at different concentration of Zymosan A and the evolution of the immune response over time was established. The results suggest the better time for evaluating the immunostimulant capacity of glucans and the appropriate dose of it, which is required to demonstrate the activation of macrophages (ROS and iNOS) and the production of pro-inflammatory molecules, both as indicators of good immune response. Currently, work is being conducted improving these methods, creating an ELISA sandwich and generating antibodies against total proteins of HKL for pre-absorption of induced samples. In particular, the implementation of ELISA for the characterization of cytokine secretion profiles is a biotechnological contribution in aquaculture, which has not been implemented before this work.									8	0	0	0	8	0	8			0718-560X	0717-7178		WOS:000314514700004

In-situ FTIR analysis was conducted between 50 degrees C to 400 degrees C for both, Co3O4 and NiCoO2, catalysts to understand the reaction mechanism leading to gas phase product distribution. On cobalt surface the reaction pathway proceeds via the formation of surface ethoxy intermediate that subsequently transforms to aldehyde and acetate intermediates before decomposing to release CO2, H-2 and CH4 gases at high temperature. A similar pathway is followed on NiCoO2 surface, leading to aldehyde intermediate, which is relatively unstable and decomposes to release CO along with CH4 and H-2 at 400 degrees C. The NiCoO2 catalyst shows relatively low selectivity for CO2, possibly due to the unstable aldehyde species providing little acetate intermediate that decomposes to release gaseous CO2. The addition of Ni improves the activity for ethanol decomposition by achieving a complete ethanol conversion at 350 degrees C as compared to 420 degrees C for cobalt alone. The crystallinity, morphology and particle analysis of the spent catalyst after the reaction was studied using XRD, SEM, and TEM respectively. The XRD shows a phase change of porous NiCoO2 to NiCo alloy, whereas SEM indicates the presence of fibrous structure on the surface with 91.7% of carbon while keeping 1:1 ratio of Ni and Co after the reaction. The detailed analysis of carbon structure using HRTEM-STEM shows the simultaneous growth of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) that were favored by larger and smaller crystallites respectively. A detailed mechanism of carbon deposition is also proposed.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000472697500030

The epitaxial growth of thin films can be a valid route to tune the properties of the materials and thus obtain new degrees of freedom in materials design. High crystal quality SmxCe1-xO2-delta films are here reported at a high doping level up to x = 0.4, thanks to the good lattice matching with the (110) oriented NdGaO3 substrate. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy demonstrate the ordered structural quality and absence of Sm segregation at the macroscopic and atomic level, respectively. Therefore, in epitaxial thin films, the homogeneous doping can be obtained even with the high dopant content not always approachable in bulk form, getting even an improvement of the structural properties. In situ spectroscopic measurements by X-ray photoemission and X-ray absorption show the O 2p band shift toward the Fermi level, which can favor the oxygen exchange and vacancy formation on the surface when the Sm doping is increased to x = 0.4. X-ray absorption spectroscopy also confirms the absence of ordered oxygen vacancy clusters and further reveals that the 5d e(g) and t(2g) states are well separated by the crystal field in the undistorted local structure even in the case of a high doping level up to x = 0.4.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000584489800039	32985188	
J	Li Tong-Kai; Xu Zheng; Zhao Su-Ling; Xu Xu-Rong; Xue Jun-Ming								Structural and optoelectronic properties of p-type SiO:H films deposited in transition zone								ACTA PHYSICA SINICA				66	19					196801	10.7498/aps.66.196801				OCT 5 2017	2017	P-type hydrogenated silicon oxide (p-SiOx:H) films are prepared by radio frequency plasma enhanced chemical deposition with various CO2 flow rates. We use gas mixtures of carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrogen (H-2), silane (SiH4) and diborane (B2H6) as reaction source gases. For all experiments the substrate temperature, pressure and power density are fixed at 200 degrees C, 200 Pa and 200 mW/cm(2), respectively. The films are deposited on Corning Eagle 2000 glass substrates for optoelectronic measurements and on crystalline Si wafers for Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurement. The structural, optical and electronic properties of the films are systematically studied as a function of CO2 flow rate. The CO2 flow rate is varied from 0 to 1.2 cm(3).min(-1), with all other parameters kept constant. It is shown that with the CO2 flow rate increasing from 0 to 1.2 cm(3).min(-1), the Raman peak shifts from 520 cm(-1) to 480 cm(-1) and corresponding crystalline volume fraction decreases from 70% to 0. In addition, the FTIR spectrum shows that the oxygen content increases from 0 to 17% and the hydrogen bond configuration gradually shifts from mono-hydrogen (Si-H) to di-hydrogen (Si-H-2) and (Si-H-2)(n) complexes in the film. What is more, with the incorporation of oxygen, the optical band gap of each of all p-type SiO:H films increases from 1.8 eV to 2.13 eV, while the dark conductivity decreases from 3 S/cm (nc-Si:H phase) to 8.310 (6) S/cm (a-SiOx:H phase). Furthermore, the oxygen incorporation tends to disrupt the growth of silicon nanocrystals due to the created dangling bonds that arises from an increased structural disorder. This leads to microstructural evolution of SiO:H film from a single nanocrystalline phase into first a mixed amorphous-nanocrystalline and subsequently into an amorphous phase. At a certain threshold of CO2 flow rate, a transition from nanocrystalline to amorphous growth takes place. The transition from nanocrystalline to amorphous silicon is confirmed by Raman and FTIR spectra. In the transition region or crystalline volume fraction of about 45%, Raman spectrum also reveals that the a mixture of nanocrystalline silicon and amorphous silicon oxide (a-SiOx:H) phase exists in the film. This means that nanocrystalline silicon oxide (nc-SiO:H) is a two-phase structural material consisting of a dispersion of silicon nanocrystals (nc-Si) embedded in the amorphous SiOx network. As is well known, the oxygen-rich amorphous phase can help enhance the optical band gap, while the nc-Si phase contributes to high conductivity. Finally, it is the SiO:H film deposited at phase transition that can realize a relatively high dark conductivity (about S/cm) with a wide optical band gap of 2.01 eV in the film. By using the transition p-layer as the window layer in conjunction with a suitable buffer thickness, we obtain a thin film solar cell with an open-circuit voltage of 890 mV, a short-circuit current density of 12.77 mA.cm(-2), fill factor of 0.73, and efficiency of 8.27% without using any back reflector.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1000-3290			WOS:000419013400026

Exposure of cells to a PPFD of 1500 mumol m-2 s-1 induced 75 % photoinhibition of oxygen evolution of PS II within 2 h. In spite of severe photoinhibition, only a slight net decrease was observed at the steady-state level of the Dl protein as determined by quantitative immunoblotting analysis. However, in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors degradation of the D1 protein occurred rapidly and photoinhibition of PS II was accelerated. Pulse and chase experiments under strong illumination revealed that the D1 protein turned over rapidly with a half-life of about 30 min. The presence or absence of psbA mRNA carrying polyribosomes on the thylakoid membranes did not significantly affect the rate of D1 protein degradation. Our results indicate that no direct synchronization exists between degradation and synthesis of the Dl protein and it is probable that reassembly and activation of PS II after insertion of a new copy of the D1 protein to the PS II complex are the rate-limiting factors of the repair of photodamaged PS II in cyanobacteria. Northern blot analysis of psbA mRNA in the presence and absence of protein synthesis inhibitors demonstrated that protein factors are needed to regulate the expression of the psbA genes in Synechocystis 6803.									35	0	0	0	33	0	35			0176-1617	1618-1328		WOS:A1993MR24100006

Here we present high pressure (P)-temperature (T) experiments that offer new constraints upon the partitioning of carbon between metallic and silicate melt in a shallow magma ocean. Experiments were performed at 1-5 GPa, 1600-2100 degrees C on mixtures of synthetic or natural silicates (tholeiitic basalt/alkali basalt/komatiite/fertile peridotite) and Fe-Ni-C +/- Co +/- S contained in graphite or MgO capsules. All the experiments produced immiscible Fe-rich metallic and silicate melts at oxygen fugacity (fO(2)) between similar to IW-1.5 and IW-1.9. Carbon and hydrogen concentrations of basaltic glasses and non-glassy quenched silicate melts were determined using secondary ionization mass spectrometry (SIMS) and speciation of dissolved C-O-H volatiles in silicate glasses was studied using Raman spectroscopy. Carbon contents of metallic melts were determined using both electron microprobe and SIMS. Our experiments indicate that at core-forming, reduced conditions, carbon in deep mafic-ultramafic magmas may dissolve primarily as various hydrogenated species but the total carbon storage capacity, although is significantly higher than solubility of CO2 under similar conditions, remains low (<500 ppm). The total carbon content in our reduced melts at graphite saturation increases with increasing melt depolymerization (NBO/T), consistent with recent spectroscopic studies, and modestly with increasing hydration. Carbon behaves as a metal-loving element during core-mantle separation and our experimental D-C(metal/silicate) varies between similar to 4750 and >= 150 and increases with increasing pressure and decreases with increasing temperature and melt NBO/T.Our data suggest that if only a trace amount of carbon (similar to 730 ppm C) was available during early Earth differentiation, most of it was partitioned to the core (with 0.20-0.25 wt.% C) and no more than similar to 10-30% of the present-day mantle carbon budget (50-200 ppm CO2) could be derived from a magma ocean residual to core formation. With equilibrium core formation removing most of the carbon initially retained in the terrestrial magma ocean, explanation of the modern bulk silicate Earth carbon inventory requires a later replenishment mechanism. Partial entrapment of metal melt in solid silicate matrix, carbon ingassing by magma ocean-atmosphere interaction, and carbon outgassing from the core aided by reaction of core metal and deeply subducted water are some of the viable mechanisms.

When exposed to supersaturating light irradiance in water, the two species developed non-photochemical quenching of fluorescence (NPQ) which was correlated with an increase in the de-epoxidation ratio (DR) of the xanthophyll cycle carotenoids (violaxanthin, antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin) and was followed by a slower decrease in oxygen evolution. NPQ reached values of up to 9 in P. canaliculata but only 4.5 in L. saccharina, at DRs of 0.65 and 0.5, respectively. In air, the xanthophyll cycle was also operative but the efficiency of de-epoxidation decreased linearly with the degree of hydration of the thallus. Photoprotection capacities in air also appeared higher in P. canaliculata than in L. saccharina, probably due to the higher molar content of the xanthophyll cycle pool size relative to chlorophyll a (Chl a) in the former (nearly double of that L, saccharina at 19 carotenoid molecules per 100 Chl a), which may be associated with a higher DR at the same level of desiccation. The concomitant higher accumulation of zeaxanthin in P, canaliculata might divert a higher percentage of the incident energy from the reaction centres, as demonstrated by the levels of NPQ, with steady-state fluorescence reduced to below the initial F-0 level. Such differences, together with the unequal resistance to desiccation of the operation of the xanthophyll cycle, should be considered as possible factors responsible for the distribution for these two species on the shore.									61	1	0	0	58	0	64			0967-0262	1469-4433		WOS:000079735800005

Transformation from harzburgite protolith to final listvenite (quartz + magnesite/+/- dolomite + relict Cr-spinel) reflects successive fluid-driven reactions, the products of which are preserved in outcrop. Transformation of harzburgite to listvenite starts with lizardite serpentinization, followed by contemporaneous carbonation and antigorite serpentinization, antigorite-talc-magnesite alteration, finally producing listvenite where alteration is most pervasive. The spectrum of listvenitic assemblages includes silica-carbonate, carbonate and silica listvenites with the latter (also known as birbirite) being the youngest, based on crosscutting relationships. The petrological observations and mineral assemblages suggest hydrothermal fluids responsible for the lizardite serpentinization had low aCO(2), oxygen and sulfur fugacities, distinct from those causing antigorite serpentinization and carbonation/listvenitization, which had higher aCO(2), aSiO(2), and oxygen and sulfur fugacities. The carbonate and silica listvenite end-members indicate variations in aSiO(2) and aCO(2) of the percolating hydrothermal fluids, most likely driven by local variations in pH and temperature.Beyond the addition of H2O, serpentinization did not significantly redistribute major elements. Progressive infiltration of CO2-rich fluids and consequent carbonation segregated Mg into carbonate and Si into silica listvenites. Trace element mobility resulted in different enrichments of fluid-mobile, high field strength, and light rare earth elements in listvenites, indicating a "listvenite mobility sequence".The delta C-13, delta O-18 and Sr-87/Sr-88 values of magnesite and dolomite in carbonated lithologies and veins point to sedimentary carbonate as the main C source. Fluid-mobile element (e.g., As and Sb) patterns in carbonated lithologies are consistent with contribution of subducted sediments in a forearc setting, suggesting sediment-derived fluids. Such fluids were produced by expulsion of pore fluids and release of structurally bound fluid from carbonate-bearing sediments in the Sistan Suture Zone (SsSZ) accretionary complex at shallow parts of mantle wedge. The CO2 -bearing fluids migrated up along the slab-mantle interface and circulated through the suture zone faults to be sequestered in mantle peridotites with marked element mobility signatures.

The X-ray diffraction patterns show the presence of a spinel-type structure with a low crystallinity. The electrochemical behaviour was investigated in 1 M KOH, using open-circuit-potential measurements and cyclic voltammetry. The studies allowed to observe the redox reactions occurring at the Fe (x) Co3-x O-4 (x = 1 and 2) oxide surface, namely Fe3O4/Fe(OH)(2) or Fe3O4/Fe2O3, Co3O4/CoOOH, Co(OH)(2)/CoOOH and CoO2/CoOOH by comparing the experimental data with those obtained for the Co3O4 and Fe3O4 films as well as with those referred to in the literature. The results show that iron ions play the major role in the solid-state surface redox transitions in the negative potential range, whereas the cobalt ions are the key species in the positive potential range. However, the contribution of each component, although small, has to be considered in both potential regions.									25	0	0	0	1	0	25			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000271734100020

In the northern part of the NCC, the earliest phase of alkaline magmatism occurred in discrete pulses in the Early and Middle Devonian; whereas the next episode of alkaline magmatism took place in the early Mesozoic. The Gucheng pluton is exposed in the northern part of the NCC and forms a composite intrusion, consisting of K-feldspar-bearing clinopyroxenite, clinopyroxene-bearing syenite and alkali-feldspar syenite. Mineral phases in these lithologies include clinopyroxene (Wo43-48En19-35Fs18-38), sanidine (An0Ab3-11Or89-97), and subordinate titanite, andradite and Na-feldspar. These rocks show homogeneous Sr but variable Nd isotopic compositions, and have relatively high zircon in-situ oxygen isotopes (delta18O=5.2-6.7). The Gucheng plutonic rocks formed through fractional crystallization and accumulation from ultrapotassic magmas, which were originated from partial melting of metasomatic vein systems in the subcontinental lithospheric mantle of the NCC. These vein networks developed as a result of the reactions of fluids derived from subducted pelitic sediments on the downgoing Palaeo-Asian ocean floor with the enriched, subcontinental lithospheric mantle peridotites. SHRIMP U-Pb zircon dating has revealed a crystallization age of 415 Ma for the timing of the emplacement of the Gucheng pluton that marks the early stages of alkaline magmatism associated with the Andean-type continental margin evolution along the northern edge of the NCC facing the Palaeo-Asian Ocean. copy 2020 Geological Society of China.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1755-6724			INSPEC:21496155

WC was synthesized by carbothermal hydrogen reduction (CHR) method under various reaction temperatures for holding different post-treatment time in 20% (v/v) CH4/H-2. The phase transformation mechanism of gaining WC was investigated, by combining CHR with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and temperature programmed reduction mass spectroscopy (TPR-MS). The results show that pure phase of WC has been obtained by CHR after isothermal heat treatment for 24 hours at 750 degrees C and 12 hours at 950 degrees C, respectively. These results indicated that two key parameters of higher temperature and longer isothermal heat treatment time are necessary for synthesizing pure phase of WC powder. In order to find out the phase transformation mechanism of tungsten trioxide (WO3) to WC, the reduction and carburization process among the temperature range from 600 degrees C to 1000 degrees C for holding 3 hours at the final temperature were studied. It was shown that at 600 degrees C, WO3 was reduced to WO2, and from 600 degrees C to 750 degrees C, WO2 was reduced to metallic tungsten (W). Moreover, at the temperature range from 750 degrees C to 900 degrees C, the mixture phases of tungsten carbide (WC), metallic tungsten (W), or/and tungsten sub Carbide (W2C) were formed without any oxides species, which indicated that tungsten carbides (WC and W2C) phases appeared because the oxides phase was thoroughly reduced. However, the occurrence of carburization process was still limited due to the presence of oxygen in the solid. Because of the formed CO and CO2 there was not enough activated methane reacting with metallic tungsten, so the phase of WC and W2C were both formed simultaneously, but the reaction of forming WC was the main reaction in the whole carburization process. Moreover, the TPR-MS and XRD results indicated that, WC was formed at lower temperature (750 degrees C) by the reduced metallic W, which was produced form W2C in the gas mixture for holding a long time, while at a higher temperature (950 degrees C), WC was formed form W2C with the mixture gas directly.									3	2	0	0	1	0	5			1533-4880	1533-4899		WOS:000484777500069	31383128

The High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) results revealed that CeO2 particles with an average size of about 5 nm dispersed on the fine Ag-Au grains in the nanoporous structure. The electrochemical measurements showed that the nanoporous Ag-Au/CeO2 composites as anode electrocatalyst observably enhanced the oxidation of sodium borohydride and decreased the reaction resistance. The promoted catalytic activity of the composites originated from the strong interaction between the uniform Ag-Au solid solution and CeO2 particles. The content and state of Au had a significant influence on the catalytic performance and thermal stability of the nanoporous composites. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical Society.

Detailed phase evolution studies using XRD and SEM/EDS demonstrated that firing at temperatures as high as 1200 degrees C is required to eliminate undesirable secondary phases. Under such conditions, nickel tends to segregate as a metallic phase and is unlikely to incorporate into the perovskite lattice. Ceramic samples sintered at 1500 degrees C exhibited temperature-activated electrical conductivity that showed a weak p(O-2) dependence and increased with vanadium content, reaching a maximum of ~17 S/cm at 1000 degrees C. STVN ceramics showed moderate thermal expansion coefficients (12.5-14.3 ppm/K at 25-1100 degrees C) compatible with that of yttria-stabilized zirconia (8YSZ). Porous STVN electrodes on 8YSZ solid electrolytes were fabricated at 1100 degrees C and studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy at 700-900 degrees C in an atmosphere of diluted humidified H-2 under zero DC conditions. As-prepared STVN electrodes demonstrated comparatively poor electrochemical performance, which was attributed to insufficient intrinsic electrocatalytic activity and agglomeration of metallic nickel during the high-temperature synthetic procedure. Incorporation of an oxygen-ion-conducting Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta phase (20-30 wt.%) and nano-sized Ni as electrocatalyst (>= 1 wt.%) into the porous electrode structure via infiltration resulted in a substantial improvement in electrochemical activity and reduction of electrode polarization resistance by 6-8 times at 900 degrees C and >= one order of magnitude at 800 degrees C.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1996-1944		WOS:000752815000001	35009422

In this work, ultrafine NiS2/MoS2 Janus subunits organized on yolk-shell nanospheres (NSs) are synthesized by a novel and facile approach. The greatly reduced particle size of both two-dimensional MoS2 and one-dimensional NiS2 on the ultrafine NiS2/MoS2 Janus subunits endows the yolk-shell NSs with numerous intimate interfaces of bimetal sulfide hybrids greatly promoting the intimate electronic interaction and dissociation of water molecules. Benefiting from the ultrafine NiS2/MoS2 Janus subunits, abundant edge sites and the high density of interfaces, the as-prepared NiS2/MoS2 yolk-shell NSs exhibit high electrocatalytic activity with a low eta(10) value of 135 and 293 mV for the HER and OER, respectively. In addition, a low cell voltage (1.58 V) is achieved by using NiS2/MoS2 yolk-shell NSs as both anode and cathode. This study has significant indications in exploring the ultrafine nanoparticles for the water splitting reaction, fuel cells and organic synthesis.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000517839900036	31939458

The calculation results show that that fluorine passivation and heteroatom doping play different roles in modifying the electronic structures of F_GDYNRs. The former helps lower the position of the valence band of the graphdiyne nanoribbons (GDYNRs) while the latter significantly opens the band gap of GDYNRs. The doped F_GDYNRs have direct band gaps of 1.8-2.9 eV, and their valence and conduction bands perfectly straddle both the oxidation and reduction potential of water. This work demonstrates that F_GDYNRs, via doping with BN pairs, possess high catalytic activity for water splitting, which will shed light on the design of metal-free low-dimensional photocatalysts.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000597256600031	33210673

Cyanobacteria have developed a photoprotective mechanism that decreases the energy arriving at the reaction centers by increasing thermal energy dissipation at the level of the phycobilisome, the extramembranal light-harvesting antenna. This mechanism is triggered by the photoactive orange carotenoid protein (OCP). In this study, we characterized OCP and the related photoprotective mechanism in non-stressed and light-stressed cells of three different strains of Planktothrix that can form impressive blooms. In addition to changing lake ecosystemic functions and biodiversity, Planktothrix blooms can have adverse effects on human and animal health as they produce toxins (e.g., microcystins). Three Planktothrix strains were selected: two green strains, PCC 10110 (microcystin producer) and PCC 7805 (non-microcystin producer), and one red strain, PCC 7821. The green strains colonize shallow lakes with higher light intensities while red strains proliferate in deep lakes. Our study allowed us to conclude that there is a correlation between the ecological niche in which these strains proliferate and the rates of induction and recovery of OCP-related photoprotection. However, differences in the resistance to prolonged high-light stress were correlated to a better replacement of damaged D1 protein and not to differences in OCP photoprotection. Finally, microcystins do not seem to be involved in photoprotection as was previously suggested.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0005-2728	1879-2650		WOS:000523617600007	31228405

The structure, surface morphology, microstructure evolution and chemistry of the reaction products have been investigated. In the investigated temperature range, the Cr2AlC films form a dense continuous oxide scale consisting of alpha-Al2O3 on Cr carbides. The oxidation rates determined by thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) were parabolic, indicating that diffusion through the scale is the rate limiting mechanism. The activation energy for oxidation was determined to be 348 kJ mol(-1) and the parabolic rate constant at 1230 degrees C was 7.1 x 10(-10) kg(2) m(-4) s(-1). Hence, the oxidation behavior is comparable to NiAl in the temperature range and time intervals investigated. With increasing oxidation time voids form at the interface between oxide and Cr carbides and the amount of Cr7C3 increases at the expense of Cr3C2. Based on our thermodynamic calculations the oxygen partial pressure below the oxide scale increases as Al is depleted and Cr carbides oxidize, resulting in CO gas- and Cr2O3-formation. The formation of gas may together with the depletion of Al and Cr lead to the significant void formation observed in the Cr carbide interlayer. Observation of both Cr carbide precipitates and the formation of (Al,Cr)(2)O-3 solid solution support this notion. For comparison bulk Cr2AlC was oxidized. It is argued that the absence of pores in oxidized bulk Cr2AlC is due to the considerably larger amount of Al available. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, single atom and sub-nano catalysts (SACs and SNCs) have been emerging as excellent candidates due to their enriched active sites, extraordinary structural design, and unique electronic behavior. Therefore, the formation of well dispersed SACs and SNCs effectively stabilized on reasonable supports has been demonstrated as an advanced strategy to greatly improve the efficiency of catalytic processes. In addition, it also offered a wonderful opportunity to observe, study, and explain the mechanism of catalytic reactions at atomic scale. In this work, we comprehensively reviewed recent advances in state-of-the-art researches on the structures, properties, and applications of SACs and SNCs. The relationships between unique morphology/structures and intrinsic physicochemical properties of the catalysts were evaluated to further understand underlying reasons behind their advanced performance. Continuously, various potential electrochemical applications of SACs and SNCs were also emphasized in detail. Furthermore, some existing challenges in fundamental studies and practical applications, as well as forthcoming prospects for the development of SACs and SNCs were briefly discussed as well.									16	1	0	0	1	0	16			0079-6425	1873-2208		WOS:000582871300006		
J	HENKEL, C; MAUERSBERGER, R								C AND O NUCLEOSYNTHESIS IN STARBURSTS - THE CONNECTION BETWEEN DISTANT MERGERS, THE GALAXY, AND THE SOLAR-SYSTEM								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				274	3			730	742						JUL 1993	1993	Observations of various isotopic species of interstellar CO, CN, CS, HCN, HNC, and HCO+ indicate that C-12/C-13 approximately 40-50, O-16/O-18 approximately 150-200, and O-18/O-17 greater-than-or-equal-to 8 in the active nuclear regions of nearby galaxies. In contrast to the strong spatial variations of most kinematical, physical, and chemical properties, the isotope ratios are more smoothly distributed, thus allowing detailed studies of global anomalies. Modelling the 'chemical' evolution during a starburst, the oxygen isotope ratios can be understood in terms of an 'overabundance' of O-18. This is explained if high mass stars (> 8 M.) convert large amounts (> 5%) of N-14 into O-18 and if the burst initial mass function (IMF) is biased in favor of massive stars. Relative to O-18, only small amounts of O-17 are produced in massive stars. Large O-18/O-17 and small O-16/O-18 ratios should be a common signature of the advanced stages of nuclear starbursts. The ejection of large amounts of O-18 by high mass stars also explains the peculiar solar O-18/O-17 ratio, if the solar system was formed in an OB association. C-12/C-13 ratios are less affected by nuclear starbursts. Therefore, infall of disk gas is likely the main cause for a C-12/C-13 enhancement. The large I((CO)-C-12)/I((CO)-C-13) line intensity ratios (> 20) observed in gas-rich mergers are explained (1) by the presence of a molecular 'halo' with low (CO)-C-13 intensities, (2) by pre-burst gas masses which are negligible relative to the infalling mass or (3) by infalling gas containing relatively unprocessed material not only from the inner but also from the outer parts of the disks. While the core-halo scenario does not require particularly large C-12/C-13 ratios, the other effects require C-12/C-13 > 40 in mergers.The Galactic center C-12/C-13, O-16/O-17, O-18/O-17, and N-14/N-15 ratios all support a quiescent state in the recent past. Predictions are made on the spatial distribution of the carbon and oxygen isotope ratios within the burst phase and on the ratios to be expected in ultraluminous mergers and in 'normal' spirals. For the Galactic disk, the existence of small interstellar clouds with enhanced O-18/O-17 ratios is postulated. In starbursts, silicon and sulfur isotope ratios are expected to be approximately solar. A qualitative explanation for the Galactic disk, center, and solar system N-14/N-15 ratios is given, implying that the corresponding ratio in nuclear starbursts may be low (less-than-or-equal-to 200).									116	1	0	0	1	0	116			0004-6361			WOS:A1993LP33400008

Inclusion of up to 20 at.% nitrogen can be reached through this clean technique with absence of oxygen species in the final product, while maintaining a largely sp(2)-carbon network. The nitrogen inclusion was observed by scanning X-ray photoelectron microscopy (SPEM) with energy resolution of 0.2 eV and spatial resolution of 10 nm. SPEM can be used to follow the evolution of nitrogen species: pyridinic, graphitic, and pyrrolic, at different doping stages and annealing temperatures. Variations in the ratio between sp2 nitrogen species was observed for increasing treatment time; annealing results in quenching of the sp(3) component, suggesting the graphitic nitrogen as the most therml stable species. The occurrence of graphitic species together with the absence of pyrrolic is indicative of N-incorporation.into a hexagonal graphene-based lattice.

J	Mozaffari, Samaneh; Nateghi, Mohammad Reza								Recent Advances in Solar Rechargeable Seawater Batteries Based on Semiconductor Photoelectrodes								TOPICS IN CURRENT CHEMISTRY				380	5					28	10.1007/s41061-022-00380-y				OCT 2022	2022	With the ever-increasing demand for energy in the world, the tendency to use renewable energies has been growing rapidly. Sunlight, as an inexhaustible energy source, and the oceans, as one of the most valuable treasures on Earth, are available for free. Simultaneous exploitation of these two sources of energy and matter (sunlight and oceans) in one configuration can provide a sustainable solution for future energy supply. Among the various types of such energy storage and conversion systems, solar rechargeable seawater batteries (SRSBs) can meet this need by storing the chemical energy of seawater by receiving solar energy. SRSBs consist of two compartments: a closed compartment including a sodium metal anode in an organic liquid electrolyte, and an open compartment containing a semiconductor photoelectrode immersed in seawater, which are separated from each other by a ceramic solid electrolyte membrane. In this complex system, the photoelectrode is irradiated by sunlight, whereby electrons are excited and reach the Na metal anode after passing though the external circuit. The ceramic solid electrolyte harvests only sodium ions from seawater and transfers them to the anodic part, where the transferred ions are reduced to sodium metal atoms. At the same time, an oxygen evolution reaction takes place at the cathodic part. In this way, the battery is charged. The use of a photoelectrode in the charging process significantly increases the voltage efficiency of SRSBs to more than 90%, whereas a cell with only the seawater compartment (without a photoelectrode) will not deliver satisfactory performance. Therefore, to achieve very high efficiencies, designing an accurate system with the best components is absolutely necessary. This review focuses on the working principle of SRSBs, at the same time explaining the effect of key components on the performance and stability of SRSBs. The role of the semiconductor photoelectrode in improving the voltage efficiency of SRSBs is also described in detail, and finally strategies proposed to overcome obstacles to the commercialization of SRSBs are introduced.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2365-0869	2364-8961		WOS:000805773900001	35662375	
J	RAUSCHER, H; MENZEL, D					Menzel, Dietrich/0000-0002-7188-8532			MODIFICATION OF THE DISSOCIATION PATHWAY OF TOLUENE ON RU(001) BY COADSORBED CO OR OXYGEN								SURFACE SCIENCE				342	1-3			155	167		10.1016/0039-6028(95)00768-7				NOV 20 1995	1995	The influence of CO on the adsorption and decomposition of toluene has been studied in the coadsorption system prepared by saturating the well-defined (root 3 x root 3)R30 degrees CO/Ru(001)-layer with toluene at 200 K, which then contains about 4.5 CO molecules to 1 toluene molecule. The initial decomposition steps of toluene are drastically modified by the high density of coadsorbed CO in this layer. Utilizing HREELS, TPD, Delta Phi, and LEED, and employing partially deuterated toluene, the first dissociation step of toluene and the formation of a C7H7-benzyl species can be identified around 320 K, 100 K lower than in the pure toluene/Ru(001) system, which is attributed to a destabilizing influence of CO on toluene. This eta(7)(pi+sigma) bonded (C7H7) benzyl species is the major decomposition product between 280 and 350 K. In contrast to the behavior in the pure toluene layer, two of the methyl hydrogen atoms desorb at a clearly lower temperature than the ring hydrogens, and the abstraction of the first methyl-H which leads to the benzyl species is clearly separated from the others, so that this species can be studied spectroscopically. The thermal desorption data suggest a C7H6 species as a further intermediate, for which no direct proof can be derived from HREELS, however. Two different CO species with nu(C-O) approximate to 1985 cm(-1) and 1675-1750 cm(-1), respectively, are observed in the coadsorbate layer; the one with the lower C-O stretch frequency transforms into the other one by 320 K, simultaneously with the transition toluene-->benzyl. Some data on the thermal evolution of adsorbed toluene coadsorbed with oxygen are also reported which show similar, although not quite as distinct features, albeit at lower coadsorbate coverage ratio. This supports the assumption that the change of reactivity is due to an electronic effect of the electronegative coadsorbates on adsorbed toluene which may contain inductive and field-induced contributions.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0039-6028			WOS:A1995TH88600024

A major cause of this photoinhibition is the light-induced irreversible photodamage to the photosystem II (PSII) complex responsible for photosynthetic oxygen evolution. A repair cycle operates to selectively replace a damaged D1 subunit within PSII with a newly synthesized copy followed by the light-driven reactivation of the complex. Net loss of PSII activity occurs (photoinhibition) when the rate of damage exceeds the rate of repair. The identities of the chaperones and proteases involved in the replacement of D1 in vivo remain uncertain. Here, we show that one of the four members of the FtsH family of proteases (cyanobase designation slr0228) found in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp PCC 6803 is important for the repair of PSII and is vital for preventing chronic photoinhibition. Therefore, the ftsH gene family is not functionally redundant with respect to the repair of PSII in this organism. Our data also indicate that FtsH binds directly to PSII, is involved in the early steps of D1 degradation, and is not restricted to the removal of D1 fragments. These results, together with the recent analysis of ftsH mutants of Arabidopsis, highlight the critical role played by FtsH proteases in the removal of damaged D1 from the membrane and the maintenance of PSII activity in vivo.									180	12	0	0	174	0	190			1040-4651	1532-298X		WOS:000185357900016	12953117

The model is time-dependent, two-dimensional, nonlinear, and nonhydrostatic; it includes diabatic processes produced by photochemistry and the effects of the gravity wave on atmospheric chemical species. The model simulates the changes to the distributions of oxygen and hydrogen compounds instantaneously in the presence of the wave and also determines the residual effect on composition after the wave packet has passed through the region. The results indicate that a gravity wave propagating through the mesopause region influences the mean distributions of chemical species even if the wave does not break. The relative perturbations are larger during night than during daytime. The chemical density perturbations persist for several hours after the dynamical wave has propagated out of the region.									33	13	0	0	0	0	44			2169-897X	2169-8996		WOS:000181935900001

By experimentally determining the melting temperature of FeO to 100 GPa and of a model core composition at 83 GPa, we find that the solid-melt equilibria can be described by complete solid solution across the Fe-FeO system at pressures above 70 GPa. Our results indicate that oxygen is a viable and likely candidate for the major light alloying element of the Earth's liquid outer core. The data suggest that the temperature at the core-mantle boundary is close to 4800 (+/- 500) K and that heat lost out of the core accounts for more than 20% of the heat flux observed at the surface.									76	0	0	0	0	0	76			2169-9313	2169-9356		WOS:A1991GH50800010

The stability of the electrodeposited ruthenium layer and the pseudocapacity of surface electrochemical reactions were measured as a function of potential window and number of cycles. Six different stages of oxide formation and reduction in cyclic voltammogram and cyclic voltmassogram of the first potentiodynamic cycle have been found and discussed. Mass losses or gains were detected depending on whether water from the layer or water from the bulk solution was consumed. Complex voltammetric and mass change behaviour was found when the potential was continuously cycled. Several types of non-stoichiometric surface reactions which include various ruthenium oxyhydroxide species and water are presented. The stability of the electrodeposited layer depends on whether ruthenium is reduced to the metallic state or only the Ru(III)/Ru(IV) transition is involved in the electrochemical process. In the Ru/RuO2 transition 26 ng of electrodeposited ruthenium was dissolved per one cycle. The stability was significantly enhanced when the potential range between 0 and 1.0 V was used. In that case only 18 ng of deposited ruthenium was dissolved after 5400 cycles at 0.5 Hz. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S.A.

Here we develop a pH-gradient-enabled microscale bipolar interface (PMBI) that facilitates sharply different local pH environments at the anode and cathode of a DBFC. Using a recessed planar electrode in conjunction with transmission electron microscopy, we show that the PMBI maintained a sharp local pH gradient (0.82 pH units nm(-1) on average) at the electrocatalytic reaction site. The PMBI configuration enabled enhanced performance in a DBFC compared with either all-anion-or all-cation-exchange configurations (330 mA cm(-2) at 1.5 V and a peak power density of 630 mW cm(-2) at 1.0 V, respectively). The high power densities obtained at voltages well above 1.0 V-achieved by virtue of the effective separation of anolyte and catholyte locally at the electrocatalytically active sites by the PMBI-provide a pathway to reduce fuel cell stack size for autonomous propulsion applications.									44	1	0	0	1	0	44			2058-7546			WOS:000464231500012

Several chemical networks have been developed to study warm (exo)planetary atmospheres. The kinetics of the reactions related to the methanol chemistry included in these schemes have been questioned.Aims. The goal of this paper is to update the methanol chemistry for such chemical networks based on recent publications in the combustion literature. We also aim to study the consequences of this update on the atmospheric compositions of (exo)planetary atmospheres and brown dwarfs.Methods. We performed an extensive review of combustion experimental studies and revisited the sub-mechanism describing methanol combustion in a scheme published in 2012. The updated scheme involves 108 species linked by a total of 1906 reactions. We then applied our 1D kinetic model with this new scheme to the case studies HD 209458b, HD 189733b, GJ 436b, GJ 1214b, ULAS J1335+11, Uranus, and Neptune; we compared these results with those obtained with the former scheme.Results. The update of the scheme has a negligible impact on the atmospheres of hot Jupiters. However, the atmospheric composition of warm Neptunes and brown dwarfs is modified sufficiently to impact observational spectra in the wavelength range in which James Webb Space Telescope will operate. Concerning Uranus and Neptune, the update of the chemical scheme modifies the abundance of CO and thus impacts the deep oxygen abundance required to reproduce the observational data. For future 3D kinetics models, we also derived a reduced scheme containing 44 species and 582 reactions.Conclusions. Chemical schemes should be regularly updated to maintain a high level of reliability on the results of kinetic models and be able to improve our knowledge of planetary formation.									18	1	0	0	0	0	18			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000514923300001

Herein Fe oxide on the surface of fluorine-doped tin oxide electrode was synthesized by a very simple, new and low-cost method, using the reduction of K2FeO4 in water. The electrode was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectrometry, X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Such fluorine-doped tin oxide electrode could be used as stable water-oxidizing anodes at pH = 13 to yield current densities of 1 mAcm(-2) at an overpotential of 550 mV.

The composition of the nanostructure and crystallinity of the IrOx film is tunable by a simple annealing treatment of a compact complex layer, which is responsible for their significantly different electrocatalytic performances for water oxidation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations showed uniformly dispersed small IrOx nanoparticles of dimensions ca. 2-5 nm for the film annealed at 300 degrees C, and the nanoparticles gradually agglomerated to form relatively large particles at higher temperatures (400 and 500 degrees C). The IrOx films prepared at different annealing temperatures are characterized by Raman spectroscopic data to reveal intermediate IrOx(OH)(y) nanoparticles with two oxygen binding motifs: terminal hydroxo and bridging oxo at 300 and 350 degrees C annealing, via amorphous IrOx at 400 degrees C, transforming ultimately to crystalline IrO2 nanoparticles at 500 degrees C. Cyclic voltammetry suggests that the intrinsic activity of catalytic Ir sites in intermediate IrOx(OH)(y) nanoparticles formed at 300 degrees C annealing is higher in comparison with amorphous and crystalline IrOx nanoparticles. Electrochemical impedance data showed that the charge transfer resistance (R-ct = 232 Omega) for the IrOx(OH)(y) film annealed at 300 degrees C is lower relative to that of films annealed at higher temperatures. This is ascribable to the facilitated electron transfer in grain boundaries between smaller IrOx particles to lead the efficient electron transport in the film. The high intrinsic activity of catalytic Ir sites and efficient electron transport are responsible for the high electrocatalytic performance observed for the intermediate IrOx(OH)(y) film annealed at 300 degrees C; it provides the lowest overpotential (eta) of 0.24 V and Tafel slope of 42 mV dec(-1) for water oxidation at neutral pH, which are comparable with values for amorphous IrOx center dot nH(2)O nanoparticle films (40-50 mV dec(-1)) reported as some of the most efficient electrocatalysts so far.									71	3	0	0	2	0	71			2155-5435			WOS:000377326700068

Films were deposited on Si (100) substrates using a plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE-ALD) reactor featuring a capacitively-coupled hollow-cathode plasma source. Trimethylindium (TMI) and variants of nitrogen plasma (N-2-only, Ar/N-2, and Ar/N-2/H-2) were used as the metal precursor and nitrogen co-reactant, respectively.In situellipsometry was employed to observe individual ligand exchange and plasma-assisted ligand removal events in real-time during the growth process. Only the samples grown under hydrogen-free nitrogen plasmas (Ar/N(2)or N-2-only) resulted in nearly stoichiometric single-phase crystalline hexagonal InN (h-InN) films at substrate temperatures higher than 200 degrees C under 100 W rf-plasma power. Varying the plasma gas composition by adding H(2)led to rather drastic microstructural changes resulting in a cubic phase oxide (c-In2O3) film. Combining thein situmeasured growth evolution withex situmaterials characterization, we propose a simplified model describing the possible surface reactions/groups during a unit PE-ALD cycle, which depicts the highly efficient oxygen incorporation in the presence of hydrogen radicals. Further structural, chemical, and optical characterization have been carried out on the optimal InN films grown with Ar/N(2)plasma to extract film properties. Samples grown at lower substrate temperature (160 degrees C) and reduced/elevated rf-plasma power levels (50/150 W) displayed similar amorphous character, which is attributed to either insufficient surface energy or plasma-induced crystal damage. InN samples grown at 240 degrees C under 100 W rf-plasma showed clear polycrystalline h-InN layers with similar to 20 nm average-sized single crystal domains exhibiting hexagonal symmetry.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				2046-2069		WOS:000553911800015	35516968

The results reveal that CoOOH improved the degradation of FA by DBD plasma through an apparent catalytic effect. 98.2% of FA was degraded in 10 min by DBD + CoOOH (0.5 g/L dosage) system at 11.2 kV applied voltage, which was 23.8% higher than that in a sole DBD system; the corresponding energy yield (G(50)) was increased by 186% and the synergistic intensity for FA degradation reached up to 2.76. The evolution of reactive species reveals that the synergistic effect of DBD plasma and CoOOH catalyst can be attributed to the catalytic conversion of O-3 and H2O2 into center dot OH on the active sites of CoOOH surface. The results of Lewis acid sites, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy suggest that the abundant oxygen vacancies and Lewis acid sites, which are offered by the lattice -OH groups in CoOOH, serve as the catalytic active sites of CoOOH. According to the detected byproducts by liquid chromatograph/mass spectrometer, a possible FA degradation pathway was also tentatively proposed.									23	0	0	0	9	0	23			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000471670400032

This study highlights the evolution in the morphology and crystallinity of electrospun TiO2 nanofibers using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) support in relation to applied calcination temperature, and their influence towards the photocatalytic dye degradation performance of the material. Results showed distinct differences in the thermal decomposition patterns of (PVP) on the fiber surface and the inner core, where it is dependent on the presence of oxygen. These differences drastically affect the morphology of the obtained fibers especially its surface area and porosity. Crystallinity of the embedded TiO2 particles increases with higher calcination temperature which contributes to higher photocatalytic performance. Highly mesoporous nanofibers with crystalline anatase TiO2 particles, together with fiber diameter of 118.3 +/- 6.30 nm and surface area of 72.3219 m(2) g(-1) are obtained at 500 degrees C. The combination of these properties produced the best photocatalytic dye degradation rate constant of 0.080 29 min(-1) and 0.0543 min(-1) for methylene blue and methyl orange respectively. The performance can be attributed to a combination of high particle crystallinity and fiber porosity and surface area.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2053-1591			WOS:000451086600001

Its efficiency for overall water splitting is superior to those of most newly reported transition metal-based bifunctional catalysts, with small cell voltage of 1.60 V needed to gain 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, this electrode also performs well toward the UOR, requiring very small potentials of 0.284 and 0.372 V (vs. SCE) to achieve 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH with 0.33 M urea. After replacing the anodic OER with the UOR that has a much lower thermodynamic voltage, this urea-mediated water-electrolysis device could sustain an overall current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low voltage of only 1.46 V (140 mV less than that for its urea-free counterpart) for over 20 h. Also, battery-and solar energy-assisted overall water and urea electrolysis devices were built to explore the viability of future less-energy-intensive and large-scale hydrogen generation.									134	3	0	0	4	0	134			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000428847300013

Furthermore, unlike plants, the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 contains genes coding for two different forms of the D1 protein, D1:1 and D1:2. Cells containing only DI:1 have a lower quantum yield of oxygen evolution and generally higher non-photochemical quenching than do cells containing only D1:2. D1:I is the predominant form in acclimated cells, but is transiently replaced by D1:2 after a shift to excess excitation, primarily as a result of changes in transcription. The exchange is triggered not by changes in light per se, but by treatments which cause fractional PS II reaction centre closure, including excess light, low temperature and partial inhibition of electron transport by DCMU. In contrast, DBMIB or heat shock treatments do not cause PS II closure and do not drive the exchange, even though overall electron transport is inhibited. After a temperature drop, high levels of nascent D1:2 accumulate in a novel form, D1:2*, approximately 3 kDa larger than the normal D1:2 polypeptide. D1:2* is not phosphorylated, does not appear to contribute to PS II function, and is probably an inactive precursor whose processing is retarded by chilling. As the cells acclimate to the lower temperature D1:2* is cleared in parallel with full recovery of PS II activity. Interestingly, D1:2* does not accumulate upon chilling in a mutant expressing only D1:2; apparently processing in this strain continues without an acclimation lag.

This study focused on the hydrogeochemical evolution, reservoir temperature, and recharge origin of geothermal waters using hydrogeochemical and deuterium-oxygen (D-O) isotopic studies. The low-temperature geothermal waters were characterized by HCO3-Na type, while shallow cold spring was of the hydrochemical type of HCO3-Ca. The hydrogeochemical characteristics of low-temperature geothermal waters were mainly determined by the dissolution of silicate minerals based on the geological condition and correlations of major and minor ions. The reservoir temperatures of low-temperature geothermal waters ranged from 111 degrees C to 126 degrees C estimated by silica geothermometry and the silicon-enthalpy graphic method. Low-temperature geothermal waters circulated at the largest depth of 1794-2077 m where deep high-temperature geothermal waters were involved. The data points of delta D and delta O-18 of the hot spring water samples in the study area show a linear right-up trend, indicating the delta O-18 reaction between the water and rock and a possible mixture of magmatic water from below. The low-temperature thermal waters were recharged by meteoric water at the elevation of 2362-3653 m calculated by delta D values. Upwelling by heating energy, low-temperature geothermal waters were exposed as geothermal springs in the fault and fracture intersection and mixed by up to 72% shallow cold waters at surface. Based on acquired data, a conceptual model of the low-temperature geothermal waters in the Mangbang-Longling area was proposed for future exploitation.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2090-9063	2090-9071		WOS:000684841600003

Current understanding states that the partition between surface adsorbed and dissolved lithium superoxide governs whether Li2O2 grows as a conformal surface film or larger particles, leading to low or high capacities, respectively. However, better understanding governing factors for Li2O2 packing density and capacity requires structural sensitive in situ metrologies. Here, we establish in situ small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) as a suitable method to record the Li2O2 phase evolution with atomic to submicrometer resolution during cycling a custom-built in situ Li-O-2 cell. Combined with sophisticated data analysis, SAXS allows retrieving rich quantitative structural information from complex multiphase systems. Surprisingly, we find that features are absent that would point at a Li2O2 surface film formed via two consecutive electron transfers, even in poorly solvating electrolytes thought to be prototypical for surface growth. All scattering data can be modeled by stacks of thin Li2O2 platelets potentially forming large toroidal particles. Li2O2 solution growth is further justified by rotating ring-disk electrode measurements and electron microscopy. Higher discharge overpotentials lead to smaller Li2O2 particles, but there is no transition to an electronically passivating, conformal Li2O2 coating. Hence, mass transport of reactive species rather than electronic transport through a Li2O2 film limits the discharge capacity. Provided that species mobilities and carbon surface areas are high, this allows for high discharge capacities even in weakly solvating electrolytes. The currently accepted Li-O-2 reaction mechanism ought to be reconsidered.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0027-8424			WOS:000637398300050	33785597	
J	Lu, Yonghong; Cao, Yejie; Zhao, Xing								Optimal rare-earth disilicates as top coat in multilayer environmental barrier coatings								JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS				769				1026	1033		10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.08.084				NOV 15 2018	2018	In last decade, rare-earth disilicates have been considered as candidate materials for top coat in multilayer environmental barrier coatings (EBCs). However, optimal coating material has not yet been found. Previous studies revealed that parabolic rate constant of thermally grown silica scale (silica-TGO) beneath EBCs played a key role in the durability of SiC matrix ceramic composites coated with EBCs. To determine optimal coating material, in this study, Lu2Si2O7 and Sc2Si2O7 coatings were first corroded under quasi-static water-vapor corrosion conditions. The evolution of silica-TGO beneath coatings was then examined in detail. Accordingly, parabolic rate constants of silica-TGO growth were calculated. Compared with parabolic rate constants of silica-TGO growth beneath barium-strontium aluminosilicate (BSAS), Yb2Si2O7, and Y2Si2O7-BSAS coatings in previous studies, Y2Si2O7-BSAS coating shows the lowest parabolic rate constant and growth rate of silica-TGO. Crystal structure of rare-earth disilicates was also studied. Results showed that bond lengths of Y-O and Si-O in Y2Si2O7 were short, indicating that it possessed low ionic oxygen permeability. This resulted in its low parabolic rate constant of silica-TGO growth. Therefore, Y2Si2O7 is the optimal material as top coat in multilayer EBCs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Films grown with a low current density not exceeding 20 mu A cm(-2) are uniform and well adhered. An optimal thickness of 1.34 mu m has been determined. At high current density, oxygen evolution occurs simultaneously and provokes crashing of films. From photoelectrochemical measurements, the band gap was found to be 1.85 eV and the transition is indirectly allowed. The Mott-Schottky plot exhibits a linear behavior, characteristic of n-type conductivity, from which a flat band potential of -1.20 V(SCE) and a donor density of 5.63 x 10(16)cm(-3) were determined. The conduction band, located at 3.28 eV, is made up of mainly Ag-5s wave function. Ag(2)S is long lived and under illumination, it is stabilized by holes consumption reactions involving S(n)(2-)/S(2-) redox couple. A conversion efficiency of 1.1% and a fill factor of 0.27 have been obtained. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, measured over a wide frequency range (10(-2)-10(5) Hz), reveals contribution of the bulk effect. The experimental data are modeled by shifting the centre of the semi circle down the real axis and interpreted in terms of constant phase element due mainly to the porosity and inhomogeneity of the film.

It contains a total resource of 278 Mt of ore at 0.98% Cu and 0.75 g/t Au. Prominent Hill is one of several IOCG deposits and numerous prospects in the Olympic IOCG province that are temporally associated with the 1603-1575 Ma Gawler Range Volcanics, a large igneous province including co-magmatic granitoid intrusions of the Hiltaba Suite. Globally, IOCG deposits share many similar features in terms of their geological environment and mineral association. However, it is not yet clear whether sulfur and copper originate from the same source rocks and which hydrothermal redox processes created the characteristic iron oxide enrichment. Highly variable sulfur isotope compositions of sulfides and sulfates in IOCG deposits have previously been interpreted in terms of diverse sulfur sources that may include contributions from magmatic, sedimentary, seawater or evaporitic sulfur. In order to test these alternatives, we performed a detailed sulfur isotope study of Cu-(Fe) sulfides from Prominent Hill and IOCG prospects nearby. The Prominent Hill deposit shows a wide range in delta S-34(v-CDT) between -33.5%a and -29.9%. for Cu-(Fe) sulfides, and a narrower range of 43%. to 15.8%o for barite. Iron sulfides (pyrite, pyrrhotite) show a narrow range in sulfur isotope composition, whereas Cu-bearing sulfides show a much wider range, and more negative delta S-34(v-CDT) values on average. We propose a two-stage sulfide mineralization model for the IOCG system in the Prominent Hill area, in which all hydrothermal sulfur is ultimately derived from a magmatic source that had a composition of 4.4 +/- 2%.. The diversity in sulfur isotope composition can be produced by different fluid evolution pathways along reducing or oxidizing trajectories. A reduced sulfur evolution pathway is responsible for stage I mineralization, when intrusion-derived magmatic-hydrothermal fluids produced early pyrite and minor chalcopyrite at Prominent Hill, and iron copper sulfides in regional magnetite skarns and in some pervasively altered volcanic rocks of the Gawler Range Volcanics. Shallow-venting magmatic-hydrothermal fluids and subaerial volcanic gases that became completely oxidized by reaction with atmospheric oxygen produced sulfate and sulfuric acid with a sulfur isotope composition equal to their magmatic source. This highly oxidized ore fluid probably consisted dominantly of water from the hydrosphere, but contained magmatic solute components, notably sulfate, acidity and Cu. Sulfate reduction produced hydrothermal Cu sulfides with a wide range in sulfur isotope compositions from very negative to moderately positive values. Partial reaction of the Cu-rich stage II fluid with earlier stage I sulfides resulted in mixing of sulfur derived from sulfate reduction and from sulfides deposited during stage I. Modeling of the sulfur isotope fractionation processes in response to reducing and oxidizing pathways demonstrates that the entire spectrum of sulfur isotope data from stage I and stage II mineralization can be explained with a single, ultimately magmatic sulfur source. Such a magmatic sulfur source is also adequate to explain the complete spectrum of sulfur isotope data of other IOCG prospects and deposits in the Olympic province, including Olympic Dam.The results of our study challenge the conventional model that suggests the requirement of multiple and compositionally diverse sulfur sources in hematite-breccia hosted IOCG style mineralization.

LaCoO3 was obtained by calcining a precursor, 0.97/2La(2)(C2O4)(3)-CoC2O4 center dot 5.3H(2)O, at 1123 K in air. The precursor and its calcined products were characterized by thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. A high-crystallized LaCoO3 with a rhombohedral structure was obtained when the precursor was calcined at 1123 K in air for 2 h. The thermal transformation of the precursor from ambient temperature to 1150 K in air presented six steps. The values of the activation energies associated with the thermal transformation of 0.97/2La(2)(C2O4)(3)-CoC2O4 center dot 5.3H(2)O were determined based on the Starink equation.

J	AGUE, JJ								MASS-TRANSFER DURING BARROVIAN METAMORPHISM OF PELITES, SOUTH-CENTRAL CONNECTICUT .2. CHANNELIZED FLUID-FLOW AND THE GROWTH OF STAUROLITE AND KYANITE								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE				294	9			1061	1134		10.2475/ajs.294.9.1061				NOV 1994	1994	Petrologic study of quartz veins and their wallrocks from the Wepawaug Schist, Connecticut, constrains the role of fracture how in the chemical and mineralogical evolution of amphibolite facies (staurolite and kyanite zone) pelites during Barrovian metamorphism. Quartz veins may contain accessory calcite and pyrite in the chlorite and biotite zones and plagioclase, micas, kyanite, staurolite, apatite, and sulfides at higher metamorphic grades. Crack-seal textures are widespread. Measured vein densities increase from about 2 to 4 percent in the lowest grade rocks to about 20 to 30 percent in the kyanite zone. In the amphibolite facies, veins are commonly surrounded by a highly aluminous selvage rich in staurolite +/- kyanite and micas and poor in quartz and plagioclase. Staurolite and kyanite are typically absent from the less aluminous wallrocks located beyond the selvage margins. The selvage width increases as a function of vein width at a ratio of similar to 1.3. Most vein development occurred after garnet crystallization had begun but pre- to syn-staurolite +/- kyanite growth.Four critical lines of evidence suggest that the quartz veins were major conduits for the regional scale movement of metamorphic fluids. (1) Mass balance analysis of two selvages and their protoliths indicates that major and trace elements were mobilized during selvage development by reactions that destroyed quartz, plagioclase, and micas and produced staurolite and kyanite. The reactions suggest significant hydrogen metasomatism. (2) Estimated f(HCl)/f(H2O) is highest in the selvages directly adjacent to veins, which suggests that the most altered rocks were infiltrated by fluids with elevated f(HCl)/f(H2O) and that the avenues for infiltration were quartz veins. (3) The amount of silica loss from local pelitic wallrocks can only account for about 70 percent of the total volume of quartz in the average amphibolite facies vein. The other 30 percent is inferred to have been externally-derived through widespread fluid infiltration down regional T and P gradients. (4) Because previously published stable isotopic studies have shown that quartz in amphibolite facies veins may be significantly out of oxygen isotopic equilibrium with walIrock quartz, the fluid that precipitated quartz was probably in part externally-derived.Selvage formation resulted in significant decreases in Na/Al and, in some cases, K/Al which stabilized aluminous index minerals. The staurolite and kyanite isograds in Barrovian terranes therefore may reflect P, T, fluid composition, protolith lithology, and metasomatic shifts in bulk chemistry caused by fluid infiltration. Widespread syn-amphibolite facies quartz vein development and associated staurolite and kyanite growth may mark regions of major fluid outflow and advective heat transport in orogenic belts.									117	2	1	0	3	2	120			0002-9599			WOS:A1994PQ19100001

Among them, the superoxide radical is of special interest as the origin of several damaging species such as H2O2, hydroxyl radical, or peroxynitrite (ONOO-). Spin trapping coupled with ESR is a method of choice to-characterize these species in chemical and biological systems and the metabolic stability of the spin adducts derived from reaction of superoxide and hydroxyl radicals with nitrones is the main limit to the in vivo application of the method. Recently, new cyclic nitrones bearing a triphenylphosphonium or permethylated beta-cyclodextrin moiety have been synthesized and their spin adducts demonstrated increased stability in buffer. In this article, we studied the stability of the superoxide adducts of four new cyclic nitrones in the presence of liver subcellular fractions and biologically relevant reductants using an original setup combining a stopped-flow device and an ESR spectrometer. The kinetics of disappearance of the spin adducts were analyzed using an appropriate simulation program. Our results highlight the interest of the new spin trapping agents CD-DEPMPO and CD-DIPPMPO for specific detection of superoxide with high stability of the superoxide adducts in the presence of liver microsomes.

The device structure is fabricated onto stainless-steel foil, which is coated on the back surface with a thin film of nickel-molybdenum hydrogen catalyst, also developed at UH. The Fe2O3 films for this photoelectrode were initially based on a pyrolytically deposited material developed at Duquesne University which has demonstrated rectifying behavior in alkaline electrolyte with a broad absorption spectra in the 300-500 nm range, and photo-generated currents exceeding 8 mA/cm(2) for 1 sun illumination. An investigation into the use of reactively sputtered films, which can be synthesized at lower temperatures than the spray-pyrolytic material, has also been initiated. The a-Si:Ge tandem "nipnip" structure for the initial photoelectrode design is based on the bottom and middle layers of the high-efficiency triple junction photovoltaic devices developed by the University of Toledo. These monolithically stacked solid-state structures, which absorb strongly in the 500-700 and 600-900 nm ranges provide the supplementary voltage bias needed to sustain the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively, occurring simultaneously at the catalyzed back surface and the Fe2O3 front surface, respectively. Performance and stability results from initial tests of fabricated prototype photoelectrodes in potassium hydroxide under simulated AM1.5 illumination are presented. Also, efforts to optimize the device design using bandgap and thickness tailoring for improved optics and current matching are described. (C) 2003 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

One-dimensional (1D) TiO2 nanostructure arrays are extensively studied morphologies for a wide range of catalytic processes, including photocatalysis (PC) and PEC reactions for water splitting. In this study, a well-aligned spaced TiO2 nanorod (TNR) arrays were uniformly grown on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate, and thermal exfoliation of the TNRs, which appeared as small islands, was investigated. The calcination time, which ranged from 1 to 5 h at 400 degrees C, had a significant impact on the agglomerated TNRs islands, which tended to be uniformly exfoliated as spaced nanorods and eventually improved the PEC performance. The regularly arranged spaced nanorods allow for the efficient transfer of internal charge carriers within the TNRs. Furthermore, the heterojunction formation with NiCo2S4 via the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method, substantially improve PEC performance, owing to reduced charge carrier recombination at the interface of the heterojunction. The Mott-Schottky analysis strongly supports the improved charge carrier density at the heterojunction interface. The improved life time of the charge carriers was investigated by comparing the time-resolved photoluminescence spectra for the TiO2/NiCo2S4 heterojunction with pristine TNRs, which was eventually confirmed by incident photon-to-current efficiency analysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000720801600004

The BIFs belong to the 2.7 Ga old Grao Para Group and show a rather simple mineralogy (hematite and quartz or cryptocrystalline silica). Their REE + Y patterns suggest deposition under marine sub-oxic conditions. Fe isotopes show highly positive values (delta Fe-57(IRMM-14) = 2.06 +/- 0.34% in average) which can be explained by the partial oxidation of Fe2+ (aq) in the surface ocean, subsequent to the upwelling of deep anoxic seawater. The resulting iron oxy-hydroxides likely formed in the shallow photic zone as a seasonal process and acquired highly positive iron isotope signature values consistent with a Rayleigh distillation model. The pyrite-bearing sandstones belong to the Aguas Claras Formation of (Palaeoproterozoic) younger age and were cored at the base of the giant Azul manganese deposit. Diagenetic pyrite is characterized by positive delta Fe-57(IRMM-14) = 1.02 +/- 0.2%. and delta S-34(VCTD) (11.97 +/- 0.12%) average values, that are different from values of modern marine biogenic pyrite. Results likely indicate that dissolved sulfate was the limiting factor controlling biogenic pyrite formation at that time. Near-zero Delta S-33 values (0.013 +/- 0.003%) indicate minimal mass-independent sulfur isotope fractionation (MIF-S), consistent with the 2.1 Ga age previously obtained from the Aguas Claras pyrites. This result suggests deposition at a time when the oxygen partial pressure in the atmosphere was already high enough (10(-5) to 10(-2) PAL- or Present Atmospheric Level-) to hinder MIF-S by photochemical reactions. Incidentally, this also confirms that the giant Mn deposit of Carajas is in the same age range (2.1 +/- 0.2 Ga) as other Mn ores in Gabon and South Africa, pointing to the importance of Mn precipitation in Paleoproterozoic times.

Both heme and non-heme centers that contain iron-thiolate bonds are found in nature. Investigating the ability of iron-thiolate model complexes to activate O-2 is expected to improve the understanding of the key factors that direct reactivity to either iron or sulfur. We report here the structural and redox properties of a thiolate-based dinuclear Fe complex, [Fe-2(II)(LS)(2)] (LS2- = 2,2'-(2,2'-bipyridine-6,6'-iyl)bis(1,1-diphenylethanethiolate)), and its reactivity with dioxygen, in comparison with its previously reported protonated counterpart, [Fe-2(II)(LS)(LSH)](+). When reaction with O-2 occurs in the absence of protons or in the presence of 1 equiv of proton (i.e., from [Fe-2(II)(LS)(LSH)](+)), unsupported mu-oxo or mu-hydroxo Fe-III dinuclear complexes ([Fe-2(III)(LS)(2)O] and [Fe-2(III)(LS)(2)(OH)](+), respectively) are generated. [Fe-2(III)(LS)(2)O], reported previously but isolated here for the first time from O-2 activation, is characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction and Mossbauer, resonance Raman, and NMR spectroscopies. The addition of protons leads to the release of water and the generation of a mixture of two Fe-based "oxygen-free" species. Density functional theory calculations provide insight into the formation of the mu-oxo or mu-hydroxo Fe-III dimers, suggesting that a dinuclear mu-peroxo Fe-III intermediate is key to reactivity, and the structure of which changes as a function of protonation state. Compared to previously reported Mn-thiolate analogues, the evolution of the peroxo intermediates to the final products is different and involves a comproportionation vs a dismutation process for the Mn and Fe derivate, respectively.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000518088800071	32057236

The rhythmic production of oxygen and its effect on core metabolism are thought to have exerted selective pressure for the temporal segregation of numerous metabolic pathways. Until recently, the only evidence for such coupling came from studies showing circadian cycles in the abundance of various redox metabolites, with many arguing that these oscillations are simply an output from the transcription-translation feedback loop. The recent discovery that the peroxiredoxin (PRX) proteins exhibit circadian cycles in their oxidation status, even in the absence of transcription, demonstrated the existence of autonomous oscillations in the redox status of the cell. The PRXs are a family of cellular thiol peroxidases, whose abundance and high reaction rate make them the major cellular sink for cellular peroxides. Interestingly, as part of the normal catalytic cycle, PRXs become inactivated by their own substrate via overoxidation of the catalytic residue, with the inactivated form of the enzyme displaying circadian accumulation. Here, we describe the biochemical properties of the PRX system, with particular emphasis on the features important for the experimental analysis of these enzymes. We will also present a detailed protocol for measuring PRX overoxidation across circadian time in adherent cell cultures, red blood cells, and fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), providing practical suggestions for ensuring consistency and reproducibility of the results.									4	0	0	0	5	0	5			0076-6879		978-0-12-803380-7	WOS:000405615400010	25707278

Children with this disease are more susceptible to respiratory infections due to the limitation in mucociliary transport and anatomical disruption of the bronchial tree. SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19, a respiratory illness related to exacerbations of chronic pulmonary pathologies in children, such as CF and asthma. There are not enough case reports on pediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and CF, for which we share our experience. Case report: A 22-month-old male patient diagnosed with CF presented in the hospital with cough, fever, and increased respiratory work. The patient received supplemental oxygen and antibiotic and antiviral therapy. Positive results for type B influenza and RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) for SARS-CoV-2 were obtained. Due to the persistence of respiratory difficulty, high-flow therapy was initiated, with a good response. After an episode of hypoxemia, bradycardia, and increased respiratory work secondary to accumulated secretions, orotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation were performed. The patient evolved with clinical and gasometric improvement. After 10 days of in-hospital antibiotic management with adequate clinical evolution, the patient was discharged to complete oral treatment and home isolation. Conclusions: We present a case of chronic respiratory disease and SARS-CoV-2 infection with severity criteria in a pediatric patient. The evolution was favorable with timely support management and antibiotic therapy in a third-level hospital.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0539-6115	1665-1146		WOS:000659977500005	33661877

A 9-12 nm disordered Cu2-delta O is formed onthe NW surface by exposing CuO NWs to CO at 1 Tort, 300 degrees C for 30 min. After 60 min, this layer decreases to 2-3 nm and is eliminated after 180 min. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy using a scanning tunneling electron microscope and across a single NW reveals, the disordered layer to be O-rich with respect to Cu2O with a, maximum. at. % Cu:O = 1.8. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows adsorbed CO on the surface as evidence of the reduction reaction. Micro-Raman spectroscopy tracks the transformation in NWs as a function of reduction time. A CO enabled, surface reduction reaction coupled to diffusion-limited transport of "nonlattice" O to the surface is proposed as a mechanism for Cu2-delta O formation. The initial buildup of out-diffusing O to the surface appears to aid the formation of the disordered surface layer. The transformation follows Ostwald-Lussac's law which predicts formation of unstable phases over stable phases, when phase transformation rates are limited by kinetic or diffusional processes. The study provides a generalized approach for facile growth of few nanometer transient layers on multivalent, metal. oxide NW surfaces.									30	0	0	0	1	0	30			0743-7463			WOS:000375809100011	27093222

The biosorption and bioreduction processes were analysed by the chemical mapping of cells biosorbed at different concentrations of Cr(VI). STXM spectromicroscopy images were recorded at O K-edge and Cr L-edge. A thorough analysis of the X-ray absorption features corresponding to different oxidation states of Cr in the biosorbed cell indicated the coexistence of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) at higher concentrations. This signifies the presence of partially reduced Cr(VI) in addition to biosorbed Cr(VI). In addition, the Cr(III) signal is intense compared with Cr(VI) at different regions of the cell indicating excess of reduced Cr. Speciation of adsorbed Cr was analysed for the spectral features of biosorbed cell and comparison with Cr standards. Analysis of absorption onset, L3/L2 ratio and absorption fine structure concludes that adsorbed Cr is predominantly present as Cr(III) hydroxide or oxyhydroxide. The evolution of absorption features in the duration of biosorption process was also studied. These time lapse studies depict the gradual decrement in Cr(VI) signal as biosorption proceeds. A strong evidence of interaction of Cr with the cell material was also observed. The obtained results provide insights into the biosorption process and chemical speciation of Cr on the cells.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2412-382X		WOS:000738184600001		
J	Wang, Yan-Min; Wang, Chao; Guo, Hui-Yan; Wang, Yu-Cheng								BplMYB46 from Betula platyphylla Can Form Homodimers and Heterodimers and Is Involved in Salt and Osmotic Stresses								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES				20	5					1171	10.3390/ijms20051171				MAR 1 2019	2019	MYB proteins play important roles in the regulation of plant growth, development, and stress responses. Overexpression of BplMYB46 from Betula platyphylla improved plant salt and osmotic tolerances. In the present study, the interaction of eight avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (MYB) transcription factors with BplMYB46 was investigated using the yeast two-hybrid system, which showed that BplMYB46 could form homodimers and heterodimers with BplMYB6, BplMYB8, BplMYB11, BplMYB12, and BplMYB13. Relative beta-glucuronidase activity and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that the interaction between BplMYB46 and the five MYBs increased the binding of BplMYB46 to the MYBCORE motif. A subcellular localization study showed that these MYBs were all located in the nucleus. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR results indicated that the expressions of BplMYB46 and the five MYB genes could be induced by salt and osmotic stress, and the BplMYB46 and BplMYB13 exhibited the most similar expression patterns. BplMYB46 and BplMYB13 co-overexpression in tobacco using transient transformation technology improved tobacco's tolerance to salt and osmotic stresses compared with overexpressing BplMYB13 or BplMYB46 alone. Taken together, these results demonstrated that BplMYB46 could interact with five other MYBs to form heterodimers that activate the transcription of target genes via an enhanced binding ability to the MYBCORE motif to mediate reactive oxygen species scavenging in response to salt and osmotic stresses.									7	3	0	0	6	0	10			1422-0067			WOS:000462542300170	30866467

Strong nebular emission lines with an expansion velocity of v similar to 7300 km s(-1) were detected. The peaked but relatively broad [O i] lambda lambda 6300, 6363 suggests the existence of similar to 2 M-circle dot of materials in which similar to 1.3 M-circle dot is oxygen. The core might be produced by a mildly asymmetric explosion. The spectra are unique among SNe Ic in (1) the absence of [Ca II] lambda lambda 7291, 7324 emission and (2) a strong emission feature at similar to 7400 angstrom, which requires similar to 0.05 M-circle dot of newly synthesized Ni-58. Such a large amount of stable neutron-rich Ni strongly indicates the formation of a neutron star. The progenitor and the explosion energy are constrained to 18 M-circle dot less than or similar to M-ms less than or similar to 22 M-circle dot and E similar to (1-3) x 10(51) ergs, respectively.									60	0	0	0	0	0	60			0004-637X			WOS:000244929400002		
J	Funke, M.; Fellrath, J-M.								Hypersensitivity pneumonitis secondary to lovebirds: a new cause of bird fancier's disease								EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL				32	2			517	521		10.1183/09031936.00108507				AUG 2008	2008	Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is an immunologically mediated lung disease due to the repetitive inhalation of antigens. Most new cases arise from residential exposures, notably to birds, and are thus more difficult to recognise.The present authors report a 59-yr-old male who complained of dyspnoea and cough while being treated with amiodarone. Pulmonary function tests revealed restriction and obstruction with low diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide and partial pressure of oxygen. A high-resolution computed tomography chest scan and bronchoalveolar lavage showed diffuse bilateral ground-glass attenuation and lymphocytic alveollitis, respectively.Initial diagnosis was amiodarone pulmonary toxicity, but because of a rapidly favourable evolution, this diagnosis was questioned. A careful environmental history revealed a close contact with lovebirds shortly before the onset of symptoms. Precipitins were strongly positive against lovebird droppings, but were negative against other avian antigens. The patient was diagnosed with hypersensitivity pneumonitis to lovebirds. Avoidance of lovebirds and steroid treatment led to rapid improvement.The present observation identifies a new causative agent for hypersensitivity pneumonitis and highlights the importance of a thorough environmental history and of searching for precipitins against antigens directly extracted from the patient's environment. These two procedures should allow a more precise classification of some cases of pneumonitis, and thus might avoid progression of active undiagnosed hypersensitivity pneumonitis to irreversible fibrosis or emphysema.									16	0	0	0	4	1	17			0903-1936	1399-3003		WOS:000258417000036	18669792

Its 3D structure is held together by pi-pi stacking interactions between the labile pyridine ligands of the nanosheets. In aqueous solution, the axial pyridine ligands are exchanged by water molecules, producing a delamination of the material, where the individual double nanosheets preserve their structure. The original 3D layered structure can be restored by a solvothermal process with pyridine, so that the material shows a "memory effect" during the delamination-pillarization process. Electrochemical activation of a 2D-Co-MOF@Nafion-modified graphite electrode in aqueous solution improves the ionic migration and electron transfer across the film and promotes the formation of the electrocatalytically active cobalt species for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The so-activated 2D-Co-MOF@Nafion composite exhibits an outstanding electrocatalytic performance for the OER at neutral pH, with a TOF value (0.034 s(-1) at an overpotential of 400 mV) and robustness superior to those reported for similar electrocatalysts under similar conditions. The particular topology of the delaminated nanosheets, with quite distant cobalt centers, precludes the direct coupling between the electrocatalytically active centers of the same sheet. On the other hand, the increase in ionic migration across the film during the electrochemical activation stage rules out the intersheet coupling between active cobalt centers, as this scenario would impair electrolyte permeation. Altogether, the most plausible mechanism for the O-O bond formation is the water nucleophilic attack to single Co(IV)-oxo or Co(III)-oxyl centers. Its high electrochemical efficiency suggests that the presence of nitrogen-containing aromatic equatorial ligands facilitates the water nucleophilic attack, as in the case of the highly efficient cobalt porphyrins.									25	0	0	0	1	0	24			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000588273900027	33125226

Here, we report the design of a unique structural configuration of yolk-shell-like FePt-FeOx nanoparticles (NPs), that exhibits notably enhanced activity and stability towards CO oxidation at relatively low temperatures (< 100 degrees C) compared with Pt NPs. The optimized FePt-FeOx catalysts were produced by partially reducing core-shell FePt-FeOx NPs under H-2 at 200 degrees C. The structural configuration was interrogated by advanced electron microscopy, which clearly reveals the evolution of the morphology, elemental segregation, and phase transition of FePt-FeOx NPs after the post-synthesis treatment. The generation of voids, partial crystallization of the FeOx shell and increased electron density on Pt were identified as key contributors to the enhanced activity and stability towards CO oxidation in FePt-FeOx NPs. This unique structural configuration allows for CO and O-2 diffusion through the FeOx shell with an increased exposure for CO and O-2 adsorption onto the core as well as an enhanced activation of O-2 compared with the core-shell FePt-FeOx without voids, which collectively boost the catalytic performance.									17	3	0	0	1	0	18			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000454636200040

The vanadium complex precursors were prepared from an ion exchange reaction of V(V) diperoxo gels and tetraalkylammonium bromide in the water-toluene mixture using H2O2 solution and commercial bulk V2O5 powders as starting vanadium gel source. The obtained VO2 NC products were characterized by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), Fourier transform infrared absorption spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric differential thermal analysis (TGA-DTA), and nitrogen adsorption/desorption (BET). The size and shape of NCs can be controlled by different synthesis parameters such as water content, steric ligands of complexes, alkyl chain lengths of capping aliphatic amines, as well as nature of solvent. Monodisperse vanadium oxide NCs with various sizes and shapes, nanospheres, nanocubes, nanorices, and nanorods, can be easily achieved. The possible mechanisms for the formation of vanadium complex precursors and vanadium oxide NCs as well as the shape evolution of NCs were also discussed. The as-made vanadium oxide products exhibited the monoclinic rutile VO2 structure, which was however converted to the orthorhombic V2O4,6 Structure after calcination in air. The XPS results also revealed only one V4+ state for the as-made sample; however, the coexistence of V5+ and V4+ states and two components of oxygen associated with O=V and O-V for the calcined samples on the vanadium oxide NC surface were observed. The surface chemical composition of both as-made and calcined samples were found to be VO2 and V2O5-x (x = 0.4), respectively. Our approach may provide a novel route for the extended synthesis to other inorganic NCs.									69	3	0	0	4	0	71			0743-7463			WOS:000265528600069	19301841

Photocatalysts based on two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as MoS2 nanomaterials have gained tremendous popularity. This is due to their narrow band gap and high visible light absorption. Herein, a MoS2 photocatalyst with highly expanded interlayer spaces of 1.51 nm was synthesized in the presence of Pluronic F-127 as a template by a facile one-pot hydrothermal method. This expanded MoS2 (MF-1) managed to photodegrade 98% (2.62 x 10(-2) min(-1)) of methylene blue (MB) dye under irradiation of 1 W visible light-emitting diode (LED) white light. The dominant performance of MF-1 is attributed to the highly expanded interlayer spacing, which exposed more active edge sites. Moreover, the formation of surface defects such as surface cracks and sulfur vacancies (Sv) facilitates the adsorption capacity and in situ generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The dominant ROS responsible for the photodegradation of MB is superoxide radical (O-2(-)). The photocatalyst shows good recyclability without deterioration even after five consecutive cycles.									12	0	0	0	2	0	12			2516-0230			WOS:000620729100020	36133295

In this research, a combination of three-dimensional (3D)-electrochemical treatment followed by biological treatment was done for chromium removal in simulated wastewater. Surface-modified Strychnos potatorum (SMSp) seeds and surface-modified tamarind pod (SMTp) shell were used as particle electrodes, and the experiments were conducted for different pH, voltage, and particle electrode followed by biological treatment. In biological treatment, Enterobacter cloacae strain was isolated from a common effluent treatment plant (CETP) and it was utilized. The molecular characterization of E. cloacae (live biomass) was done using 16s rRNA sequencing. In 3D-electrochemical treatment with SMSp, efficiency was found to be the best when compared with SMTp under optimum condition (6 V, 3 pH, 15 g of SMSp) at a working period of 60 min, and the removal of hexavalent chromium from aqueous solution using SMSp was successfully applied to semi-empirical kinetic model, which is based on Fermi's equation. This semi-empirical kinetic model effectively depicts the hexavalent chromium concentration evolution in 3D-electrochemical treatment. The combined treatment reduced the amount of chemical oxygen demand as well as the hexavalent chromium-ion concentration in aqueous solution.									8	0	0	0	3	1	9			1944-7442	1944-7450		WOS:000506698800001

The reaction mechanism for the oxidation of H2O to O-2 catalyzed by single-Ru-substituted polyoxometalates, [RuIII(H2O)XW11O39](n-) (X = Si-IV, Ge-IV), was investigated by means of density functional calculations. The electronic structure of the pre-activation intermediates indicates that the aqua ligand is prone to accommodate the proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) process to achieve the active group [Ru-V=O-a], and the high valent oxoruthenium (V) species are responsible for the O-O forming event. Three possible proton acceptors were designed for the rate-determining step (O-b, O-a, and H2O), the calculated results support that the bridge O-b atom of the polytungstate ligand will act as the most favorable proton acceptor in the O-O bond formation, with an energy barrier of 28.43 kcal mol(-1). A detailed information of the peroxidic intermediates in the oxidation process was also characterized, both the peroxo-species [Ru-IV(OO)SiW11O39](6-) and [Ru-V(OO)SiW11O39](5-) show the six-coordinate isomer with an open terminal geometry is more favorable than the close seven-coordinate ones. In addition, the replacement of the heteroatom in XO4n- can effectively tune the catalytic activity of polyoxometalates, in the order of Ge-IV > Si-IV.									25	1	0	0	1	0	25			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000321212800033	23765391

Among the many obstacles facing a Z-scheme photocatalytic system, the analysis methods of interfacial Z-scheme charge transfer still remain a significant challenge. Hence, in this study, CdS/Ti-Fe2O3 heterojunction photoanodes are elaborately designed to explore the charge-transfer behavior in PEC water splitting. In this study, photophysical measurements, including the Kelvin probe measurement, surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPV), and transient photovoltage spectroscopy (TPV), are used to monitor the migration behavior of photogenerated charges at the interface electric field of CdS/Ti-Fe2O3 Z-scheme heterojunction photoanodes. The Kelvin probe and SPV measurements demonstrate that CdS/Ti-Fe2O3 interfacial driving force favors the rapid transfer of photoexcited electrons to CdS. The double-beam strategy based on TPV indicates that more electrons of Ti-Fe2O3 are combined with the holes of CdS owing to the intensive interface electric field. The results of these measurements successfully prove the Z-scheme migration mechanism of CdS/Ti-Fe2O3 photoanodes. Benefiting from the desirable charge transfer at the interface electric field, CdS/Ti-Fe2O3 photoanodes exhibit superior photocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction performance compared with that of pure Ti-Fe2O3. The photocurrent density of the 25CdS/Ti-Fe2O3 photoanode reaches 1.94 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode without excess cocatalyst, and it is two times higher than that of pure Ti-Fe2O3 photoanode. Therefore, an outstanding strategy is provided in this study to prove the Z-scheme charge-transfer mechanism of photocatalytic systems in PEC water splitting.

However, the simultaneous manipulation of photocharges in the two locations is challenging. Herein, the synchronous promotion of bulk and surface separation of photoinduced charges for prominent CO2 photoreduction by coupling macroscopic spontaneous polarization and surface oxygen vacancies (OVs) of BiOIO3 single crystals is reported. The oriented growth of BiOIO3 single-crystal nanostrips along the [001] direction, ensuing substantial well-aligned IO3 polar units, renders a large enhancement for the macroscopic polarization electric field, which is capable of driving the rapid separation and migration of charges from bulk to surface. Meanwhile the introduction of surface OVs establishes a local electric field for charge migration to catalytic sites on the surface of BiOIO3 nanostrips. Highly polarized BiOIO3 nanostrips with ample OVs demonstrate outstanding CO2 reduction activity for CO production with a rate of 17.33 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) (approximately ten times enhancement) without any sacrificial agents or cocatalysts, being one of the best CO2 reduction photocatalysts in the gas-solid system reported so far. This work provides an integrated solution to governing charge movement behavior on the basis of collaborative polarization from bulk and surface.									310	19	0	0	33	0	311			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000511230200001	32026522

In meteorites, a fraction of C-rich presolar grains (e.g., silicon carbide (SiC) grains of Type-X and lowdensity graphites) are identified as relics of these events, according to the anomalous isotopic abundances. Several features of these abundances remain unexplained and challenge the understanding of core-collapse supernovae explosions and nucleosynthesis. We show, for the first time, that most of the measured C-rich grain abundances can be accounted for in the C-rich material from explosive He burning in core-collapse supernovae with high shock velocities and consequent high temperatures. The inefficiency of the C-12(alpha,gamma)O-16 reaction relative to the rest of the alpha-capture chain at T > 3.5 x 10(8) K causes the deepest He-shell material to be carbon-rich and silicon-rich, and depleted in oxygen. The isotopic ratio predictions in part of this material, defined here as the C/Si zone, are in agreement with the grain data. The high-temperature explosive conditions that our models reach at the bottom of the He shell can also be representative of the nucleosynthesis in hypernovae or in the high-temperature tail of a distribution of conditions in asymmetric supernovae. Finally, our predictions are consistent with the observation of large Ca-44/Ca-40 observed in the grains. This is due to the production of Ti-44 together with Ca-40 in the C/Si zone and/or to the strong depletion of Ca-40 by neutron captures.									39	0	0	0	1	0	39			2041-8205	2041-8213		WOS:000317411100002

In mylonites, texturally homogeneous polycrystalline quartz ribbons have a constant isotopic composition (delta(18)O=12.9+/-0.0 parts per thousand, n=3), whereas monocrystalline quartz ribbons, which display heterogeneous intercrystalline strain and only minor recrystallization, have variable delta(18)O values (11.6+/-0.5 parts per thousand, n=5). Alkali feldspars in samples that contain fluid inclusion-decorated microcracks, reflecting heterogeneous deformation, show a range in isotopic composition (8.8 to 10.23 mean=9.4+/-0.7 parts per thousand, n=3). In contrast, recrystallized myrmekite rims surrounding alkali feldspar augen in Brevard zone mylonites are isotopically heavier by about 1% (9.2+/-0.1 parts per thousand, n=5) compared to the cores 8.3+/-0.3 parts per thousand, n=4), reflecting isotopic homogenization during neocrystallization. Deformation mechanisms that result in heterogeneous strain on the grain scale (either crystal plastic or brittle) are associated with only partial isotopic homogenization, whereas deformation mechanisms that result in homogeneous strain (e.g., recrystallization, neocrystallization) are associated with isotopic homogenization on the grain scale. Agreement between measured quartz-feldspar isotopic temperatures and calculated temperatures using a finite difference model indicates diffusional exchange occurred between phases during closed system cooling, and that the measured temperatures in the mylonites are maximum temperatures for the deformation. The approximate agreement between measured temperatures in some mylonites and the calculated Dodson quartz closure temperatures indicates that isotopic exchange below T-c quartz was not substantial. The necessary conditions under which isotopic temperatures in mylonites correspond to the deformation temperature are outlined. On the basis of this study and reconsideration of older data, the onset of total dynamic recrystallization in quartz is estimated to be about 350 degrees C in natural shear zones. Together with reaction weakening of feldspar observed in the mylonites, the temperature interval 350-400 degrees C is likely to be important for weakening of both quartz and feldspar in the continental crust.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			0022-1376			WOS:A1997WP00500004

The majority of trace fossils belong to the Nereites ichnofacies, representing low energy, oxygen-poor, and relatively quiet bottom water environments. However, the shallow water trace fossil Planolites also appears in the strata, possibly reflecting variations in the bottom water oxygen contents of the turbidite succession. Redox proxies Th/U, V/Sc, and V/(V + Ni) reveal variable redox conditions; most of the samples are in the range from suboxic to anoxic depositional conditions. Ni and Cu show a positive correlation with TOC, but U and V have no correlation with TOC, also suggesting the redox conditions were mainly suboxic. The P/Al and Cu/Al ratios of all samples are higher than those of Post-Archean Australian Shales (PAAS), and about two-thirds of the samples' Ba/Al and Ni/Al ratios are close to or higher than PAAS, suggesting the Early Carboniferous Junggar Basin had relatively high palaeo-productivity levels. delta C-13(org) values average - 23.75 parts per thousand, reflecting a mixture of terrestrial organic and marine organic matter. The indexes of Ba/Al, Cu/Al, Ni/Al, and delta C-13(org) show good positive correlations with TOC, indicating the palaeo-productivity played an important role for the organic matter accumulation. On the other hand, the TOC correlates inversely with redox proxies (Th/U, V/Sc, and V/(V + Ni)), suggesting the preservation conditions (anoxia) are not the control factor of organic matters accumulation. Using these multiple approaches, our results indicate that productivity was the primary factor controlling organic matter accumulation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0072-1050	1099-1034		WOS:000508025400003

Mass gain of oxidized samples and phase of oxides were measured. Morphologies and compositions of the oxide scales as well as the cross-section layers were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) combined with energy dispersive spectrum (EDS). Metallurgical structure of oxidized samples in the cross section was observed by optical microscopy (OM). The results showed that mass gain of the samples oxidized at solid temperatures was relatively small, while it increased sharply at semi-solid temperatures. These oxide scales were mainly composed of TiO2 and Cr2O3 at solid temperatures. Oxide scales were composed of NiO, TiO2 and Cr2O3 in the initial stage of oxidation when oxidation occurred at semi-solid temperatures. Then with the increasing of oxidation time, the spinel oxides of NiCr2O4, NiWO4 and NiMoO4 were formed. Cross-sectional analysis revealed that Al2O3 was observed beneath the surface oxides. Besides, severe oxidation at semi-solid temperatures led to the occurrence of oxide exfoliation, cracks and pores. At solid oxidation temperatures, the oxidation mechanism was the outward diffusion of metal cations and the slight inward diffusion of oxygen atoms along grain boundaries. At semi-solid oxidation temperatures, the formation of cracks and pores promoted the interdiffusion of metal cations and oxygen atoms. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Indeed, solar energy possesses the appealing features of being abundant, inexhaustible and widely geographically distributed, yet intermittent. Thus, a common approach consists in the development of specific devices (e.g. photo-electrochemical cells, PECs) allowing for its storage in the form of chemical energy.In order to produce viable PEC systems, the main focus should be the optimization of the light absorbing component(s), which generally comprise the exploitation of semiconductors (SCs). These materials must be efficient, durable, cheap and energetically suitable to perform the reaction(s) leading to the desired solar fuel(s). Hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) possesses these features, being composed by earth abundant elements, as well as being capable of harvesting a sizable portion of the solar spectrum. Its valence band maximum, more positive than the redox potential of water oxidation, makes it an interesting candidate for the photoinduced oxygen production via water splitting.In this short review, we will mainly discuss the capitalization on hematite properties for such process, while implementing suitable optimization techniques in its synthesis (namely nanostructuring, doping and surface functionalization). Examples of case studies also from our laboratory will be discussed, in which various hematite-based interfaces are probed using advanced characterization techniques (e.g. electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and transient photocurrent analysis). These studies aimed at gaining insights into the key processes involved in the photocurrent generation, thus contributing to the rational design of future more efficient photoactive interfaces. This is a challenging goal since at present all the reported hematite-based photo-anodes display performances that are far below the maximum thermodynamically attainable photocurrent (i.e. 12.6 mA/cm(2)).Finally, we will report on recent examples of hematite-based PEC systems yielding value-added organic compounds as the photoinduced oxidation products. This latter strategy, even if currently at its infancy, is believed to be a groundbreaking approach towards the production of organics exploiting sunlight energy in a sustainable electrochemical process.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-1693	1873-3255		WOS:000852992000004

The microstructure in each layer could be divided into three zones according to the morphology. The homogeneity deteriorated with the rising of the input. The tensile strength dropped 29.7% when the porosity increased from 0.53% to 1.88%. Controlling the oxygen under 0.5% and optimising the heat input, the as-built tensile strength reached 360?MPa. The fracture elongation was enhanced from 3.9% to 12.7% when the heat input was increased from 480 to 1200?W. The decrease of the secondary dendrite arm spacing and the change of fracture mechanism is the main reason leading to the strengthening of the mechanical properties.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0267-0836	1743-2847		WOS:000489361500001

It has a granoblastic, coarse-grained, olivine groundmass (CGL: coarse-grained lithology) with relatively large pyroxene-plagioclase poikilitic patches (PP) and small fine-grained domains of an opaque-rich lithology (ORL). Both PP and ORL are inhomogeneously distributed and display reaction boundaries with the groundmass. Major silicates, olivine (Fa20-28) and orthopyroxene (Fs20-28Wo0.5-2.5), display systematic differences in composition between CGL and ORL as well as a complicated pattern of variations within CGL. Accessory plagioclase has low K content and displays regular igneous zoning with core compositions An40-45 and rims An32-37. The bulk chemical composition of Divnoe is similar to that of olivine-rich primitive achondrites, except for a depletion of incompatible elements and minor enrichment of refractory siderophiles. Oxygen isotope compositions for whole-rock and separated minerals from Divnoe fall in a narrow range, with mean deltaO-18 = +4.91, deltaO-17 = +2.24, and DELTAO-17 = -0.26 +/- 0.11. The isotopic composition is not within the range of any previously recognized group but is very close to that of the brachinites. To understand the origin of Divnoe lithologies, partial melting and crystallization were modelled using starting compositions equal to that of Divnoe and some chondritic meteorites. It was found that the Divnoe composition could be derived from a chondritic source region by approximately 20 wt% partial melting at T almost-equal-to 1300-degrees-C and log(fO2) = IW-1.8, followed by approximately 60 wt% crystallization of the partial melt formed, and removal of the still-liquid portion of the partial melt. Removal of the last partial melt resulted in depletion of the Divnoe plagioclase in Na and K. In this scenario, CGL represents the residue of partial melting, and PP is a portion of the partial melt that crystallized in situ. The ORL was formed during the final stages of partial melting by reaction between gaseous sulfur and residual olivine in the source region.A prominent feature of Divnoe is fine mum-scale chemical variations within olivine grains, related to lamellar structures the olivines display. The origin of these structures is not known.									37	0	0	0	1	0	37			0026-1114			WOS:A1994ND20200007

We investigated physiological changes in the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas caused by exposure to pollutants (cadmium, tributyltin) and acute water temperature change. We analysed mRNA expression of Mn-SOD in gills using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR), and measured the glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels in haemolymph based on time-and dose-related effects of pollutants and acute water temperature treatments. We cloned a cgMn-SOD full-length cDNA that included an open reading frame of 675 nucleotides that was predicted to encode proteins of 225 amino acids. BLAST analysis of other species indicated that residues essential to the enzymatic functions of Mn-SOD proteins are highly conserved. Levels of Mn-SOD mRNA expression, GOT and GPT were gradually increased and then decreased during the experimental periods. On the other hand, H2O2 levels increased continuously during the exposure periods. These results suggest that Mn-SOD plays an important role in the physiological changes related to metabolism and cell protection that occur in C. gigas when exposed to oxidative stress by pollutants and fluctuations in water temperature.									35	7	0	0	33	0	41			1745-1000	1745-1019		WOS:000269785900004

J	Teagle, DAH; Jeffrey, CA; Halliday, AN								Tracing the chemical evolution of fluids during hydrothermal recharge: Constraints from anhydrite recovered in ODP Hole 504B								EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS				155	3-4			167	182		10.1016/S0012-821X(97)00209-4				FEB 28 1998	1998	A unique record of the chemical evolution of seawater during hydrothermal recharge into oceanic crust is preserved by anhydrite from the volcanic sequences and sheeted dike complex in ODP Hole 504B. Chemical and isotopic analyses (87Sr/86Sr, delta 18O, delta 34S) of anhydrite constrain the changing composition of fluids due to reaction with basalt. There is a general trend of decreasing Sr-87/Sr-86 of anhydrite, corresponding to the minor incorporation of basaltic strontium with Sr-87/Sr-S6 ratios decrease rapidly with depth in the dikes to values identical to host basalt depth in the volcanic rocks. (0.7029), Sr/Ca ratios (< 0.1 mmol/mol) suggest that recharge fluids have very low Sr concentrations and fluids evolve by first precipitating Sr-bearing phases before extensive exchange of Sr with the host basalt. There is a background trend of decreasing sulfate delta(18)O with depth from + 12-13 parts per thousand in the lower volcanics to + 7 parts per thousand in the lower sheeted dikes recording an increase in recharge fluid temperature from approximate to 150 degrees to approximate to 250 degrees C, and confirming the presence of sulfate in hydrothermal fluids at elevated temperatures. From the amount of anhydrite recovered from Hole 504B and the amount of seawater sulfur that has been reduced to sulfide, a minimum seawater recharge flux can be calculated. This value is approximate to 4-25 times lower than estimates of high-temperature fluid fluxes based on either thermal constraints or global chemical budgets and suggests that there is significant deficit of seawater-derived sulfur in the oceanic crust. Only a minor proportion of the seawater that percolates into the crust near the axis is heated to high temperatures and exits as black smoker-type fluids. A significant proportion of the axial heat loss must be advected at 200-250 degrees C by sulfate-bearing hydrothermal solutions that egress diffusely from the crust. These fluids penetrate into the dikes and exchange both heat and chemical tracers without the extensive clogging of porosity by anhydrite precipitation, which would halt hydrothermal circulation for any reasonable fluid flux. The heating of the major proportion of hydrothermal fluids to only moderate temperatures (approximate to 250 degrees C) reconciles estimates of hydrothermal fluxes derived from thermal models and global geochemical budgets. The flux of hydrothermal sulfate would be of a magnitude similar to the riverine input, and oxygen-isotopic exchange at 200-250 degrees C between dissolved sulfate and recharge fluids during hydrothermal circulation provides a mechanism to continuously buffer seawater sulfate oxygen to the light isotopic composition observed.

This historical essay traces BC's influence through the accumulated work of DL to DL's many collaborators. The overall temporal organization of mass-energy, information, and signaling networks in yeast in self-synchronized continuous cultures represents, until now, the most characterized example of in vivo elucidation of time structure. Continuous online monitoring of dissolved gases by direct measurement (membrane-inlet mass spectrometry, together with NAD(P)H and flavin fluorescence) gives strain-specific dynamic information from timescales of minutes to hours as does two-photon imaging. The predominantly oscillatory behavior of network components becomes evident, with spontaneously synchronized cellular respiration cycles between discrete periods of increased oxygen consumption (oxidative phase) and decreased oxygen consumption (reductive phase). This temperature-compensated ultradian clock provides coordination, linking temporally partitioned functions by direct feedback loops between the energetic and redox state of the cell and its growing ultrastructure. Multioscillatory outputs in dissolved gases with 13 h, 40 min, and 4 min periods gave statistical self-similarity in power spectral and relative dispersional analyses: i.e., complex nonlinear (chaotic) behavior and a functional scale-free (fractal) network operating simultaneously over several timescales.

Attention has been paid to what occurs during the decomposition of propionate and how the process is affected by the furnace atmosphere (oxidizing or inert). In an oxidizing atmosphere, the decomposition of cerium propionate is triggered by the oxidation of Ce3+ to Ce4+. This reaction entails the loss of large unoxidized propionate fragments of the propionate ligands. As decomposition proceeds, the carbonaceous residue makes the oxygen transport inside the material more difficult and decomposition becomes diffusion limited. At this point, extensive oxidation of the residue begins until it is completely removed. Crystallization of CeO2 occurs simultaneously with decomposition. In these conditions, crystalline nanoparticles (diameter of 3-5 nm) can be obtained at a temperature as low as 300 A degrees C. In an inert atmosphere, decomposition occurs in three steps. During the first step, one of the three propionate ligands is lost, with little oxidation of Ce3+, and is substituted by a hydroxyl group. The second step entails the loss of the remaining ligands with a substantial oxidation of Ce3+ to Ce4+. After this step, the intermediate product is, proposed as, a mixture of amorphous Ce(OH)(3) and Ce(OH)(4). Finally, the third step leads to conversion of the Ce hydroxide into crystalline CeO2. In an inert atmosphere, the process is less reproducible than in air and a carbonaceous residue remains in the product.									21	0	0	0	0	0	22			1388-0764	1572-896X		WOS:000293773700047

The sodium release and the shrinking of the char pellet are simulated by accounting for the reactions occurring both in the solid and gas phases. The combustion of a single char pellet is considered first, and the results are compared against measurements. The simulation of the pellet mass, pellet temperature and sodium release agreed well with in-house optical measurements. The validated lattice Boltzmann approach is then extended to investigate the combustion of porous char and sodium release inside the porous medium. The pore-structure evolution and the flow path variation are simulated as combustion proceeds. The simulations reproduce the expected different behaviors between the combustion products (CO and CO2) and the released volatile, here the sodium vapor. The combustion products are mostly generated at the flame front and then transported by the flow and molecular diffusion inside the complex porous char structure. However, the volatile sodium vapor forms in the entire porous char and tends to accumulate in regions where the flow motion stays weak, as in internal flow microchannels, or blocked, as in closed pores. These results confirm the potential of the LBM formalism to tackle char-pellet combustion accounting for the topology of the porous medium. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

The tribological behavior of AZ31 alloy with GNS was systematically investigated by using dry sliding tests, a 3D surface profile-meter and a scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive spectrometer. The experimental results indicate that the Mg alloy with GNS exhibits better wear resistance comparing to the as-received sample, which is associated to the alteration of wear mechanism at different sliding speeds. The Mg alloy with GNS presents the wear mechanism of the abrasive wear at 0.05 m/s and the oxidative wear at 0.5 m/s, respectively. Moreover, the GNS can effectively promote the reaction between the oxygen and worn surface, which leads to a compact oxidation layer at 0.5 m/s. The effect of oxidation layer on the wear resistance of the Mg alloy was also discussed. Copyright (C) 2016, The editorial office of Journal of Materials Science & Technology.

The cloning of OEE1 precursor cDNA fragment was carried out by means of reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using degenerated primers, Both 3'- and 5'-regions were isolated by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method. The deduced amino acid sequence consisted of 322 amino acids and was 87% identical to that of Nictiana tabacum. In B.gymnorrhiza, the predicted amino acid sequence of the mature protein starts at the residue number 85 of the open reading frame. The first 84-amino acid residues correspond to a typical transit sequence for the signal directing OEE1 to its appropriate compartment of chloroplast. The expression of OEE1,was analyzed together with other OEE subunits and DI protein of photosystem II. The transcript levels of all the three OEEs were enhanced by NaCI treatment, but the significant increase of D1 protein was not observed.									123	17	0	0	117	0	145			0032-0781			WOS:000165474200014	11092914

The iron isotope signature of sedimentary pyrite is widely used to trace the microbial and redox states of the ocean, yet the iron isotope fractionation accompanying pyrite formation in nature is difficult to constrain due to the complexity of the pyrite formation process, difficulties in translating the iron isotope systematics of experimental studies to natural settings, and insufficient iron isotope datasets for natural euxinic (i.e. anoxic and sulfidic) marine basins where pyrite formation occurs. Herein we demonstrate, that a large, permil-level shift in the isotope composition of dissolved iron occurs in the Black Sea euxinic water column during syngenetic pyrite formation. Specifically, iron removal to syngenetic pyrite gives rise to an iron isotope fractionation factor between Fe(II) and FeS2 of 2.75 permil (parts per thousand), the largest yet reported for reactions under natural conditions that do not involve iron redox chemistry. These iron isotope systematics offer the potential to generate permil-level shifts in the sedimentary pyrite iron isotope record due to partial drawdown of the oceanic iron inventory. The implication is that the iron stable isotope signatures of sedimentary pyrites may record fundamental regime shifts between pyrite formation under sulfur-limited conditions and pyrite formation under iron-limited conditions. To this end, the iron isotope signatures of sedimentary pyrite may best represent the extent of euxinia in the past global ocean, rather than its oxygenation state. On this basis, the reinterpreted sedimentary pyrite Fe isotope record suggests a fundamental shift towards more sulfidic oceanic conditions coincident with the 'Great Oxidation Event' around 2.3 billion years ago. Importantly, this does not require the chemical state of the ocean to shift from mainly de-oxygenated to predominantly oxygenated in parallel with the permanent rise in atmospheric oxygen, contrary to other interpretations based on iron isotope systematics.

Nevertheless, the superior features of mono-faceted electrodes for anode properties in metal-ion batteries remain unexplored. Herein, facet-stacked WO3-x nanorods (NRs) are hybridized in situ in N-doped carbon nanosheets (CNSs) (WO3-x NRs/N-CNSs) via a facile self-polymerization and post-calcination approach. The N-CNSs create continuous conductive networks for rapid and stable ion/electron transport, and the WO3-x NRs with mono facets (010) can provide open and short-range ordered ion-diffusion pathways, which contain abundant dangling bonds and unsaturated active sites derived from the oxygen vacancies of nonstoichiometric WO3-x, thereby delivering superior reaction efficiency and robust structural stability for ultra-fast/stable sodium-ion storage. These findings are illustrated in detail using characterization techniques and density functional theory calculations. After 50 000 cycles, the WO3-x NRs/N-CNSs show a gratifying reversible capacity of 184.6 mA h g(-1), with an average charge time of 34.8 s and a high capacity retention of similar to 120% at 30.0 A g(-1). In particular, the WO3-x NRs/N-CNSs//Na3V2(PO4)(3) full-cells also display a high capacity of 112.5 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles at 5.0 A g(-1). Therefore, combined with the in situ carbon compositing strategy, facet-stacked WO3-x NRs can provide a valuable basis for developing high-rate and ultra-long-life metal-ion batteries.									9	1	0	0	1	0	9			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000593047100018

In tomato, unlike biosynthesis pathway, the regulatory network of ascorbate remains largely unclear. Here, we reported the isolation and characterization of SlNL33, the gene that encodes an NL type NBS-LRR resistance protein by candidate gene-based association study. Knockdown of SlNL3 by RNA interference in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv. Ailsa Craig) increased AsA level in both fruit (similar to 1.3 fold) and leaf (more than twofold). qRT-PCR analysis revealed that elevated expression of several structural genes involved in ascorbate biosynthesis including GMP4, GME1, GGP1, GalDH, GLDH, MIOX, MDHAR, and DHAR, may contribute to the ascorbate accumulation in SlNL33 RNAi lines compared with wild-type. Furthermore, the SlNL33-RNAi transgenic lines showed enhanced tolerance to oxidative stress by methyl viologen and gray mold infection by Botrytis cinerea respectively, as compared to control plants. Taken together, the present findings revealed that SlNL33 was the first identified NBS-LRR gene that plays a negative role in the AsA accumulation as well as biotic and abiotic stress tolerance in tomato.									10	1	0	0	6	0	10			0167-6903	1573-5087		WOS:000480563600005

Temperature stress is known to increase the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that subsequently cause oxidative stress. Fish is known to evolve a system of antioxidant enzymes to reduce ROS toxicology. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) family consists of key enzymes that protect fish from oxidative stress. In this study, full-length GPx1 cDNA (GenBank accession no. KY984468) of Tor tambroides was cloned and characterized by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The 899-base-pair (bp) GPx1 cDNA includes a 576-bp open reading frame encoding for 191 amino acids, plus 28 bp of 5'-untranslated region (UTR) and 295 bp of 3'-UTR. Homology analysis revealed that GPx1 of T tambroides (Tor-GPx1) shared high similarity with GPx1 sequences of other fish species. The phylogenetic construction based on the amino acid sequence showed that Tor-GPx1 formed a clade with GPx1 sequences of various fish species. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to assess the levels of GPx1 gene expression in the liver and muscle of T tambroides under thermal stress. The results indicated that GPx1 gene expression was down-regulated under decreased temperature. However, there was no significant difference between GPx1 gene expression in fish exposed to high temperature and control. Our study provides the first data regarding GPx gene expression in T tambroides under thermal stress.									7	0	0	0	4	0	7			1176-9343			WOS:000472818400001	31236006

The characterization proved the incorporation of BiVO4 and Cu2O not only increased the light harvesting efficiency of photoelectrodes but also improved their quantum yield, eventually exhibiting high photoelectrochemical performances. Significantly enhanced removal of tetracycline hydrochloride and electricity generation was obtained in the BiVO4/TiO2 NT-Cu2O/TiO2 NT PFC system. The rate constant of this dual photoelectrode PFC was 1.42 and 3.66 times as much as that of BiVO4/TiO2 NT-Pt PFC and Pt-Cu2O/TiO2 NT PFC, respectively, and the maximum power density was 1.68 and 103.8 folds as great as that of BiVO4/TiO2 NT-Pt PFC and Pt-Cu2O/TiO2 NT PFC. The enhancement was attributed to the large interior bias originated from the Fermi level difference between two electrodes, driving the photoelectrons of BiVO4/TiO2 NT to combine with the holes of Cu2O/TiO2 NT across external circuit and thus generating electricity. Meanwhile, organics were degraded by the anode holes, cathode electrons, and reactive oxygen species generated via chain reactions. The mechanism analysis confirmed the important roles of cathode electrons and anode holes, either acting as the oxidizing agent or the origination of hydroxyl radicals. Furthermore, the BiVO4/TiO2 NT-Cu2O/TiO2 NT PFC displayed good stability and reusability. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This vector has a multiple cloning site downstream of a promoter and Shine-Dalgarno sequences derived from Lactococcus. The protein-coding region of sodA from E. coli was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, using a thermocycler and Taq DNA polymerase before cloning into pMG36e. When introduced into E. coli, the recombinant plasmid expressed the predicted fusion protein, both in the presence and absence of oxygen. The expression of the fusion protein in E. coli was verified by SOD assays, activity gels and Western blots. The recombinant plasmid was also introduced into Lactococcus lactis, which contains a resident SOD, and into Lactobacillus gasseri, which is devoid of SOD. Transformed lactococci expressed an active SodA fusion protein plus an active hybrid protein composed of subunits of the Lactococcus and the recombinant E. coli enzymes.

Then the hollow spherical NiCo2S4 was coated by the sheet-shaped 2D MoS2. Through the band gap adjustment, a type-II heterostructure is constructed to move the photogenerated electrons to the outer layer, and part of photogenerated holes migrate to the inner layer, which successfully reduces the degradation rate of the dye sensitizer for slowing down the decay of H-2 evolution rate in the dye sensitization system. In addition, Ni2P was used to enrich photogenerated electrons on the outer layer of MoS2 thereby achieving more efficient hydrogen production. The photocatalytic materials were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, UV-vis DRS and N-2 Isothermal adsorption experiments.

For this, the cobalt hydroxycarbonate 1-D structured array film was used as a sacrificial precursor template for the ion exchange reaction in aqueous K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] solution. By controlling the reaction, 1-D structured array film, or particulate structured film of the cobalt hexacyanoferrate crystals could be obtained, which thus offered possibilities on morphology-dependent property engineering. The films before and after the ion exchange reaction were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffractometry, energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Further, electrochemical study of the films was performed using voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The study reveals the morphology-dependent electrocatalytic property of the cobalt hexacyanoferrate crystal film on water-oxidation. The 1-D structured array film of the cobalt hexacyanoferrate crystals has demonstrated superior electrocatalytic performance on water-oxidation from alkaline and neutral electrolytes, which is competitive to the catalytic performance demonstrated by many outstanding water-oxidation catalysts.									46	1	0	0	2	0	46			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000378716900010

Glycinebetaine also protected the D1/D2/Cytb559 complexes against strong light-induced damage to the photochemical reactions and the irreversible bleaching of beta-carotene and chlorophyll. The presence of glycinebetaine also enhanced thermotolerance of the D1/D2/Cytb559 complexes isolated in the presence of 1.0 mol/L betaine with an increase in the temperature for 50 % inactivation from 29degreesC to 35degreesC.

We present time dependent chemical models for a dense and warm O-rich gas exposed to a strong, far ultraviolet (FUV) field aimed at exploring the formation of simple organic molecules in the inner regions of protoplanetary disks around T Tauri stars.Methods. An up-to-date chemical network is used to compute the evolution of molecular abundances. Reactions of H-2 with small organic radicals such as C-2 and C2H, which are not included in current astrochemical databases, overcome their moderate activation energies at warm temperatures and become very important for the gas phase synthesis of C-bearing molecules.Results. The photodissociation of CO and release of C triggers the formation of simple organic species such as C2H2, HCN, and CH4. In timescales between 1 and 10(4) years, depending on the density and FUV field, a steady state is reached in the model in which molecules are continuously photodissociated, but also formed, mainly through gas phase chemical reactions involving H-2.Conclusions. The application of the model to the upper layers of inner protoplanetary disks predicts large gas phase abundances of C2H2 and HCN. The implied vertical column densities are as large as several 10(16) cm(-2) in the very inner disk (< 1 AU), in good agreement with the recent infrared observations of warm C2H2 and HCN in the inner regions of IRS 46 and GV Tau disks. We also compare our results with previous chemical models studying the photoprocessing in the outer disk regions, and find that the gas phase chemical composition in the upper layers of the inner terrestrial zone (a few AU) is predicted to be substantially different from that in the upper layers of the outer disk (> 50 AU).									73	0	0	0	0	0	73			1432-0746			WOS:000255953100020

Herein, we study the morphological influence of TiO2 nanostructures on photocatalytic degradation of different organic dyes methyl blue, methyl violet and methyl orange present in industrial wastewater. Nanorod, nanohelics and nanozigzag TiO2 nanofilms were fabricated by using galancing angle deposition technique (GLAD). TiO2 nanofilms were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and raman analysis. BET surface area analysis were carried out by using nitrogen adsorption desorption curves. The results show that TiO2 morphology had great influence on photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes due to difference in specific surface area and pore volume of nanostructures. The photocatalytic degradation experiments were carried out for three hours under UV-vis light irradiation. Catalysis recycling and organic dyes concentration influence were also studied. In case of high concentration of organic dyes, negligible degradation rate is observed. TiO2 nanozigzag films show better degradation performance than nanohelics and nanorod due to presence of large surface area for reaction, higher porosity with dispersion of active sites at different length scales of pores and presence of oxygen vacancies.

Herein, a heterostructured Ir@Pd electrocatalyst with ultrasmall Ir nanoclusters (NCs) epitaxially confined on Pd nanosheets (NSs) for catalyzing the sluggish alkaline HOR is reported. Apparent charge redistribution occurs across the heterointerface, and both experimental and theoretical results suggest that the electrons transfer from Pd to Ir, which consequently greatly weakens the hydrogen binding on Pd. More interestingly, the interfacial epitaxy results in the formation of Ir/IrO2 Janus nanostructures, where the partially oxidized Ir species away from the interface further optimize the hydroxyl adsorption behavior. The unique Ir@Pd heterostructure eventually shows an optimal balance between hydrogen and hydroxyl adsorption, and hence exhibits impressive HOR activity with an exchange current density of up to 7.18 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 m KOH solution. In addition, the Ir@Pd electrocatalyst exhibits negligible activity degradation owing to the confinement effect of the unique epitaxial interface.									20	1	0	0	0	0	20			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000697377200001	34545978

Alloy characterization included X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption (XAS), hydrogen absorption in a Sieverts apparatus, and electrochemical cycling of alloy electrodes. The atomic volume of H was determined for two of the alloys. Electrochemical kinetic measurements were melds using steady-stare galvanostatic measurements, galvanodynamic sweep, and electrochemical impedance techniques. XAS was used to examine the degree of corrosion of the alloys with cycling. Alloying with Y decreased the corrosion rate. The results are consistent with corrosion inhibition by a Y-containing passive film. The increase in the exchange current density of the hydrogen oxidation reaction with increasing depth of discharge was much greater on the Y-containing alloys. This may be due to the dehydriding of the catalytic species on the surface of the metal hydride particles. (C) 1999 The Electrochemical Society. S0013-4651(99)01-045-9.

J	Spiteller, G								Enzymic lipid peroxidation - A consequence of cell injury?								FREE RADICAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE				21	7			1003	1009		10.1016/S0891-5849(96)00268-7				1996	1996	It is postulated that cell injury activates ''dormant'' enzymes to produce lipid hydroperoxides. In a first step, membrane lipids are cleaved by esterases. The unsaturated fatty acids thus produced are converted in a second step by lipoxygenases to lipid hydroperoxides (LOOHs). In a third, nonenzymic step, these LOOHs, together with dienoic hydroxy fatty acids produced by enzymic reduction of LOOHs, react with a second oxygen molecule to generate dihydroperoxy-fatty acids and hydroxy-hydroperoxy-fatty acids, which are degraded to alpha-hydroxyaldehydic compounds. This last reaction requires production of LO'-radicals by iron ions that also are generated as a result of cell damage. In addition, alpha-hydroxyaldehydes are produced by hydrolysis of plasmalogen epoxides, which are generated by oxidation of plasmalogens with LOO' or by action of epoxidases. We hypothize that alpha-hydroxyaldehydes act as second messengers. The release of lipoxygenase and the consequent lipid hydroperoxidation is postulated to occur in massive cell damage (e.g., myocardial infarction), in chronic diseases such as rheumatism, diabetes and atherosclerosis, in aging, and in control. of cell proliferation.

Physical properties of the electrocatalysts are examined using X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and density functional theory. This study reveals that the Pd/SnO2/MOFDC possesses superior alkaline HOR activities (in terms of kinetic current, heterogeneous rate constant, diffusivity, exchange current density, and the mass activity) compared to those of the Pd/MOFDC and that are comparable to commercial Pt/C. The improved alkaline HOR activity on Pd/SnO2/MOFDC is attributed to the facile interfacial electrochemical processes arising from the multifunctional properties of SnO(2)with the thin Sn film: i) weakening of Pd-H-ads, confirmed by DFT simulation, and ii) oxophilic (thin Sn film) and spill-over (SnO2) effects that quickly transfer OH(-)ions to the desorbed H(ads)for facile reaction in the Volmer rate-determining step (RDS). Tafel slope (b(a)=52-102 mV dec(-1)) and activation energy (E-A) values suggest the predominance of the Heyrovsky-Volmer process. In addition to the improved HOR activity of Pd/SnO2/MOFDC, it also exhibits better stability than Pd/MOFDC. The good performance of Pd/SnO2/MOFDC toward the alkaline HOR promises potential development of low-cost anode materials for alkaline membrane fuel cells.									12	0	0	0	0	0	11			2196-0216			WOS:000573517700001

The correlation between metal oxidation state and its catalytic consequences for ultrafine Pt was studied for photocatalytic overall water splitting using a Pt/SrTiO3 (photo)catalyst. A distinctive change in catalytic behavior and oxidation state was observed below 100 Pt-atom clusters at similar to 2 nm. Combining density functional theory (DFT) and experimental characterizations including X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), the smaller Pt clusters obtained by the surface organometallic route (under 100 Pt atoms) were predominantly oxidized and selectively performed photocatalytic water splitting selectively without activation of the water-forming back-reaction from H-2 and O-2. When the Pt clusters obtained by classical impregnation were larger than 2 nm, they remained metallic (Pt-0) and were active for both water splitting and the competing thermal water formation back reaction. In addition, Pt-0 clusters are poisoned in the presence of CO, whereas highly dispersed ultra-fine oxidized Pt clusters are insensitive to CO. This paper presents evidence of ultrafine PtOx, (below approximately 2 nm clusters) that are insensitive to coordination of various gas identities (H-2, O-2, CO), resulting in efficient and selective photocatalytic overall water splitting.

Measurements were performed during the dark-light transition of both aerobic and anaerobic cells, under illumination with saturating or low light intensity. Two different patterns of behavior were observed: (a) In anaerobic cells, during the lag preceding O-2 evolution, ATP was synthesized without changes in the NADP/NADPH ratio, consistently with the operation of cyclic electron flow. (b) In aerobiosis, illumination increased the ATP/ADP ratio independently of the intensity used, whereas the amount of NADPH was decreased at limiting photon flux and regained the dark-adapted level under saturating photon flux. Moreover, under these conditions, the addition of low concentrations of uncouplers stimulated photosynthetic O-2 evolution. These observations suggest that the photosynthetic generation of reducing equivalents rather than the rate of ATP formation limits the photosynthetic assimilation of CO2 in C. reinhardtii cells. This situation is peculiar to C. reinhardtii, because neither NADPH nor ATP limited this process in plant leaves, as shown by their increase upon illumination in barley (Hordeum vulgare) leaves, independent of light intensity. Experiments are presented and were designed to evaluate the contribution of different physiological processes that might increase the photosynthetic ATP/NADPH ratio-the Mehler reaction, respiratory ATP supply following the transfer of reducing equivalents via the malate/oxaloacetate shuttle, and cyclic electron flow around PSI-to this metabolic situation.									46	1	0	0	48	0	50			0032-0889			WOS:000185076800037	12857827

However, the preparation of such materials is a significant challenge because of the difficulty related to producing chemically stable layered oxynitrides. In this study, oxynitride 2D crystals having triple perovskite units (A site: Ca, B site: Ta) were successfully prepared via the perfect delamination of the chemically stable Ruddlesden-Popper phase layered oxynitrides, Na2Ca2Ta3O9N. The layered compound was found to be stable during proton exchange in 6 M HNO3 and a subsequent delamination process, and the resulting oxynitride 2D crystals (herein [Ca2Ta3O9.5N0.5](-)(1.5) were observed to have a yellow coloration along with a band gap of 2.58 eV. The [Ca2Ta3O9.5N0.5](-)(1.5) 2D crystals modified with RhCrOx and CoOx cocatalysts restacked with alkali ions exhibited photocatalytic activity for H-2 and O-2 evolution from pure water under UV light and visible light illumination. A transparent, free-standing oxynitride 2D-crystal film having a thickness of around 1 mu m was prepared from the 2D-crystal suspension. This film was perfectly oriented in the [001] direction, which resulted in flexibility, mechanical strength, and airtightness due to face-to-face lamination of the 2D crystals. The proton conductivity of the oxynitride 2D-crystal film was around 10(-3)-10(-4) S/cm at 25-50 degrees C (RH: 90-100%). The cell exhibited a power density of 9 mW/cm(2) at 25 mA/cm(2). This type of free-standing, flexible oxynitride film is expected to provide a new possibility and to enable the use of oxynitride materials in various applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000685206200025

The cDNA insert had a length of 1983 bases with a polyadenylate tail of 19 bases. Translation of the cDNA sequence revealed an open reading frame encoding a 601-aa protein with a predicted M(r) of 68,960. Search of the GenBank data base with the deduced translation product revealed 42% identity and 65% similarity With 5-epi-aristolochene synthase from tobacco and 31% identity and 53% similarity with limonene synthase from spearmint. Each of the three proteins catalyzes an intramolecular cyclization of a prenyl diphosphate substrate to a specific cyclic terpenoid hydrocarbon product. The proposed reaction mechanisms for the three catalytic processes share common chemical features, even though the products being formed are members of three different classes of terpenoid compounds. Analysis of the alignment of the three proteins suggests that both primary and secondary structural elements are conserved. These similarities suggest that the genes that encode terpenoid cyclization enzymes of this type in angiosperms have undergone divergent evolution from an ancestral progenitor gene. In support of this proposition, the locations of five of the six introns in the casbene synthase gene align very closely with those of the five introns in the 5-epi-aristolochene synthase gene.									114	9	0	0	91	0	134			0027-8424			WOS:A1994PE38800039	8078910

Hydrogen-burning is the root cause of the star-to-star abundance variations of light nuclei in Galactic globular clusters (GC). In the present work we constrain the physical conditions that gave rise to the observed abundance patterns of Li, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, as well as Mg isotopes in the typical case of NGC 6752.Methods. We perform nucleosynthesis calculations at constant temperature, adopting realistic initial abundances for the proto- cluster gas. We use a detailed nuclear reaction network and state-of-the-art nuclear reaction rates.Results. Although simplistic, our analysis provides original results and new constraints on the self-enrichment scenario for GCs. Our parametric calculations allow us to determine a narrow range of temperature where the observed extreme abundances of all light elements and isotopes in NGC 6752 are nicely reproduced simultaneously. This agreement is obtained after mixing of the H-processed material with similar to 30% of unprocessed gas. We show that the observed C-N, O-Na, Mg-Al, Li-Na and F-Na anticorrelations as well as the behaviour of the Mg isotopes can be recovered by assuming mixing with various dilution factors. Li production by the stars that build up the other abundance anomalies is not mandatory in the case of NGC 6752.Conclusions. Observations of O, Na, Mg and Al constrain the temperature range for H-burning; such temperatures are encountered in the two main candidate "polluters" proposed for GCs, namely massive AGBs and the most massive main-sequence stars. Furthermore, observations require dilution of H-burning processed material with pristine one. They provide no clue, however, as to the nature of the unprocessed material required for mixing. The complementary observations of the fragile Li and F clearly point to ISM origin for the mixed material.									119	0	0	0	0	0	119			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000247977400020

We note that the direct impact of C- and O-enriched hypernova ejecta on the ambient hydrogen and helium leads to spallation reactions that can produce large amounts of the light nuclides lithium, beryllium, and boron (LiBeB). Using analytic velocity spectra of the hypernova ejecta, we calculate the LiBeB yields of different exploding C-O cores associated with observed hypernovae. The deduced yields are much higher than those produced by similar (direct) means in normal Type II supernovae (SNe) and are higher than the commonly used ones arising from shock wave acceleration induced by Type II supernova explosions. To avoid overproduction of these elements in our Galaxy, hypernovae should be rare events, with less than or similar to3 x 10(-2) hypernovae per supernova, assuming a constant HN/SN ratio over time; this result also implies that the HN production of Be is only a fraction of other sources, e. g., superbubbles. Our limit to the HN/SN ratio is in good agreement with that of long-duration GRBs if we assume that the gamma-ray emission is focussed in a solid angle Omega so that [(Omega/4pi)(-1)) less than or similar to3 x 10(4). This encouraging result supports the possible HN-GRB association. Thus, Galactic LiBeB abundance measurements offer a promising way to probe the HN rate history and the possible HN-GRB correlation. On the other hand, if hypernovae are associated with massive pregalactic stars (Population III), they would produce an LiBeB pre-enrichment in protogalactic gas, which could show up as a plateau in the lowest metallicities of the Be-Fe relation in halo stars.									27	0	0	0	0	0	27			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000179681500027		
J	Schirmer, Tilman								C-di-GMP Synthesis: Structural Aspects of Evolution, Catalysis and Regulation								JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY				428	19	SI		3683	3701		10.1016/j.jmb.2016.07.023				SEP 25 2016	2016	Cellular levels of the second messenger cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) are determined by the antagonistic activities of diguanylate cyclases and specific phosphodiesterases. In a given bacterial organism, there are often multiple variants of the two enzymes, which are tightly regulated by a variety of external and internal cues due to the presence of specialized sensory or regulatory domains. Dependent on the second messenger level, specific c-di-GMP receptors then control fundamental cellular processes, such as bacterial life style, biofilm formation, and cell cycle control.Here, I review the large body of data on structure function relationships in diguanylate cyclases. Although the catalytic GGDEF domain is related to the respective domain of adenylate cyclases, the catalyzed intermolecular condensation reaction of two GTP molecules requires the formation of a competent GGDEF dimer with the two substrate molecules juxtaposed. This prerequisite appears to constitute the basis for GGDEF regulation with signal-induced changes within the homotypic dimer of the input domain (PAS, GAF, RAMP, etc.), which are structurally coupled with the arrangement of the GGDEF domains via a rigid coiled-coil linker. Alternatively, phosphorylation of a Rec input domain can drive GGDEF dinnerization.Both mechanisms allow modular combination of input and output function that appears advantageous for evolution and rationalizes the striking similarities in domain architecture found in diguanylate cyclases and histidine kinases.

In this work, a series of surfactant-free noble metal doped Ru/CNT (M-Ru/CNT, M = Pt, Rh, Pd, Ir, CNT stands for carbon nanotube) are prepared by microwave reduction method in 1 minute with approximate to 3-3.5 nm in size for the first time. In 0.5 m H2SO4, the overpotential of Pt-Ru/CNT (Pt: 4.94 at %) is only 12 mV. What's more, it also has much larger electrochemical surface area and intrinsic activity than Pt/C. Pt-Ru/CNT still has an ultra-small overpotential under high current density (113 mV at 500 mA cm(-2), 155 mV at 1000 mA cm(-2)). At the same time, it possesses excellent stability regardless of high current or low current after the durability test of 100 h. Theoretical calculation also deeply reveals that Ru is the main adsorption site of H+. The comparison of the electronic structure of a series of noble metals adjusted by Ru shows that Pt has the most excellent Gibbs free energy of the adsorbed hydrogen and promotes the desorption of the product.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000720735100001	34802189

This study reveals some interesting effects of mycotoxin cytochalasin A (CA) on photosystem II (PSII). Our results suggested that CA causes leaf lesions on Ageratina adenophora due to its multiple effects on PSII. At a half-inhibitory concentration of 58.5 mu M (I-50, 58.5 mu M), the rate of O-2 evolution of PSII was significantly inhibited by CA. This indicates that CA possesses excellent phytotoxicity and exhibits potential herbicidal activity. Based on the increase in the J-step of the chlorophyll fluorescence rise OJIP curve and the analysis of some JIP-test parameters, similar to the classical herbicide diuron, CA interrupted PSII electron transfer beyond Q(A) at the acceptor side, leading to damage to the PSII antenna structure and inactivation of reaction centers. Molecular docking model of CA and D1 protein of A. adenophora further suggests that CA directly targets the Q(B) site of D1 protein. The potential hydrogen bonds are formed between CA and residues D1-His215, D1-Ala263 and D1-Ser264, respectively. The binding of CA to residue D1-Ala263 is novel. Thus, CA is a new natural PSII inhibitor. These results clarify the mode of action of CA in photosynthesis, providing valuable information and potential implications for the design of novel bioherbicides.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2223-7747		WOS:000873667400001	36297819

At the same time, the performance of GO/WO3 photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to produce renewable hydrocarbon fuel was studied. The results showed that the introduction of GO promoted the absorption of visible light, enhanced the adsorption performance of CO2 in the catalyst surface, improved the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron hole pairs and made the protons produced by water decomposition more involved in the reduction reaction of CO2, thus greatly enhancing the efficiency of CO produced by Photocatalytic reduction of CO2. The yields of CO and H-2 were 151.8 mu molg-1 cat. h-1 and 46.3 mu molg(-1) cat. h-1, which were about three times and two times of pure WO3 under the same conditions.The performance of GO/WO3 photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to produce CO was studied. The introduction of GO promoted the absorption of visible light, enhanced the adsorption performance of CO2 in the catalyst surface, improved the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, and made the protons produced by water decomposition more involved in the reduction reaction of CO2, thus greatly enhanced the efficiency of CO and H-2 produced by photocatalytic reduction of CO2.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1793-2920	1793-7094		WOS:000645078600004

Herein, the BiOBr/CoOx/g-C3N4 Z-scheme photocatalyst was constructed by integrating two-dimensional (2D) BiOBr and g-C3N4 components with introducing CoOx as both redox mediator and cocatalyst. The spectroscopic and photoelectrochemical analyses verified the higher efficiency of charge transfer and separation in the BiOBr/CoOx/g-C3N4 heterostructures. For photo catalytic degradation of phenol in water, the BiOBr/CoOx/g-C3N4 photocatalyst exhibited an apparent rate constant of 0.0579 min(-1), which is 7.3, 4.3 and 3.0 times those from g-C3N4, BiOBr, and BiOBr/g-C3N4 samples, respectively. As identified by the control experiments and the in-situ electron spin resonance measurements, the photogenerated holes (h(+)), hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) and superoxide radical (center dot O-2(-)) contributed together to the photocatalytic phenol degradation. The enhanced photocatalysis of BiOBr/CoOx/g-C3N4 heterostructures was attributed to its multiple virtues of broad photoabsorption region as well as favorable spatial separation and sufficient redox potentials of electrons and holes. The CoOx species could serve as a charge mediator to accelerate the interfacial charge transfer and a cocatalyst to promote the hole driven oxidation reaction. This study develops a low-cost and high-efficiency photocatalyst for the removal of organic pollutants from aquatic environment as well as highlights an effective approach for the construction of all-solid-state Z-scheme photocatalyst.

Groundwater monitoring data from the construction stage of the facility beginning in 2010 to the operation stage in 2017 revealed seawater intrusion (SWI) into the inland area with significant spatiotemporal variation and subsequent changes in hydrochemical reactions. Groundwater was divided into three groups based on the temporal changes in the seawater mixing ratio. Group 1 showed an increasing trend with some delayed responses to SWI and an ion-exchange dominant process. Group 2 represented dynamic changes of hydrochemical reactions in time toward to a new equilibrium condition along SWI and refreshing. In this group, simultaneous increases in SO4 and Ca, depletion of delta(SSO4)-S-34, and a slight decline in the SI of gypsum suggest that precipitation and re-dissolution of gypsum occurred during the transition of SWI. These changes are probably attributable to the balance change between seawater and fresh groundwater inflows, and subsequently to preferential flow paths developed in the fractured aquifer. Group 3 groundwater demonstrated a rapid and direct connection with seawater since the beginning of construction of the LILRW facility. In summary, SWI process and subsequent hydrogeochemical reactions in the coastal groundwater varies significantly in time and in space, thus continuous monitoring of groundwater chemistry is warranted for safety management of the underground LILRW facility.									6	0	0	0	3	0	6			0022-1694	1879-2707		WOS:000527390200083

In the simplest incarnation of electro-organic synthesis, an organic substrate undergoes direct electron transfer with the electrode in a type of heterogeneous catalysis process. However, such direct electrochemical processes may suffer from slow kinetics, poor product selectivities and/or lack of control over the extent of electron transfer to the substrate, all of which can lead to sub-optimal reaction outcomes. A distinct, but extremely important, sub-section of electro-organic synthesis (so-called "in-direct electrolysis") circumvents these limitations through the use of soluble redox mediator molecules, which act as electron shuttles between the heterogeneous electrode and the organic substrate in bulk solution. The advantages of indirect electrolysis for a number of organic transformations is now becoming increasingly clear, typically using either very simple metal salts or small organic molecules as the mediators. However, one particular class of mediators, the polyoxometalates (well-defined, soluble metal oxide clusters), offers an especially wide diversity of structures and properties that could revolutionise indirect electrolysis for electro-organic synthesis. In this review, we provide a collation of reports that describe use of electro-generated polyoxometalate redox mediators for organic transformations, with a particular focus on the most recent and most exciting results.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000729855600005

The CN-NSs, which have a unique two-dimensional structure, were favorable for supporting TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs). The uniform dispersion of TiO2 NPs on the surface of the CN-NSs creates sufficient interfacial contact at their nanojunctions, as was confirmed by electron microscopy analyses. In comparison with other reported metal oxide/CN composites, the strong interactions of the ultrathin CN-NSs layers with the TiO2 nanoparticles restrain their re-stacking, which results in a large specific surface area of 234.0 m(2).g(-1). The results indicate that the optimized TiO2/CN-NSs hybrid exhibits remarkably enhanced photocatalytic efficiency for dye degradation (with k of 0.167 min(-1) under full spectrum) and H-2 production (with apparent quantum yield = 38.4% for lambda = 400 +/- 15 nm monochromatic light). This can be ascribed to the improved surface area and quantum efficiency of the hybrid, with a controlled ratio that reaches the appropriate balance between producing sufficient nanojunctions and absorbing enough photons. Furthermore, based on the identification of the main active species for photodegradation, and the confirmation of active sites for H2 evolution, the charge transfer pathway across the TiO2/CN-NSs interface under simulated solar light is proposed.									59	8	0	0	6	0	60			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000404396600001

Sudicky, E.A., this volume. Multicomponent simulation of wastewater-derived nitrogen and carbon in shallow unconfined aquifers: I. Model formulation and performance. J. Contam. Hydrol.] is applied to a well-studied wastewater plume in a sandy aquifer near Cambridge. Ontario. Domestic wastewater is released into the unsaturated zone via a drain field at a depth of about 0.8 m. The physical transport parameters for the model are obtained by simulating a non-reactive solute, while kinetic input data for the nitrogen and carbon reaction network are obtained from the literature. The model shows that the wastewater-loading rate has little influence on the moisture content in the unsaturated zone, thus oxygen diffusion in the air phase is an important transport mechanism. The model results are in general agreement with the field-determined moisture and oxygen profiles near the drain field. The simulation results show that oxidation of ammonium and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) goes to completion in the 1.5-m distance between the drain field and the water table, and that calcite dissolution limits the pH reduction to about 0.2 units. The model-predicted nitrate concentrations in the core of the plume are in the range of 20-25 mg N/l and are in good agreement with the field data. Overall. the results for the major reactive species from the model simulation agree well with the geochemical data obtained below the drain field and it is concluded that the major physical and biochemical processes have been correctly captured in the current model formulation.

Within the syncline, the Plio-Quaternary aquifer is the main source of drinking water for cattle and for agricultural irrigation water. This work aims to investigate the origin of groundwater mineralization and to identify the primary hydrogeochemical processes controlling groundwater evolution in the Remila aquifer.A total of 86 water samples from boreholes were analyzed for major, minor and stable isotopes (180, 2H) over three seasons: first during low water levels in 2013, second during high water levels in 2014 and third for stable isotopes during low water levels in 2015. The analysis showed that the aquifer is controlled by five principal geochemical processes: (I) the dissolution of evaporite rocks, (II) cation exchange and reverse exchange reactions, (III) congruent dissolution of carbonates (calcite, dolomite) coupled with the dissolution of gypsum and calcite precipitation, (IV) sulfate reduction under anaerobic conditions, and (V) saltwater intrusion in the northeastern Sabkha plains. The 180 and deuterium concentrations in groundwater are very low, indicating that the aquifer is recharged by evaporated rainfall originating from the north slope of the Aures Mountains which confirms that the aquifer is recharged in the southern part of the plain.

J	Ma, Lan; Shao, Xiujuan; Wang, Yaping; Yang, Yingzhong; Bai, Zhenzhong; Zhao, Yanxia; Jin, Guoen; Ga, Qin; Yang, Quanyu; Ge, Ri-Li								Molecular cloning, characterization and expression of myoglobin in Tibetan antelope (Pantholops hodgsonii), a species with hypoxic tolerance								GENE				533	2			532	537		10.1016/j.gene.2013.09.030				JAN 10 2014	2014	The Tibetan antelope (Pantholops hodgsonii) is a hypoxia-tolerant species that lives at an altitude of 4000-5000 m above sea level on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. Myoglobin is an oxygen-binding cytoplasmic hemoprotein that is abundantly expressed in oxidative skeletal and cardiac myocytes. Numerous studies have implicated that hypoxia regulates myoglobin expression to allow adaptation to conditions of hypoxic stress. Few studies have yet looked at the effect of myoglobin on the adaptation to severe environmental stress on TA. To investigate how the Tibetan antelope (TA) has adapted to a high altitude environment at the molecular level, we cloned and analyzed the myoglobin gene from TA, compared the expression of myoglobin mRNA and protein in cardiac and skeletal muscle between TA and low altitude sheep. The results indicated that the full-length myoglobin cDNA is composed of 1154 bp with a 111 bp 5' untranslated region (UTR), a 578 bp 3' UTR and a 465 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polypeptide of 154 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular weight of 17.05 kD. The TA myoglobin cDNA sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence were highly homologous with that of other species. When comparing the myoglobin sequence from TA with the Ovis aries myoglobin sequence, variations were observed at codons 21 (GGT -> GAT) and 78 (GAA -> AAG), and these variations lead to changes in the corresponding amino acids, i.e., Gly -> Asp and Glu -> Lys, respectively. But these amino acid substitutions are unlikely to effect the ability of binding oxygen because their location is less important, which is revealed by the secondary structure and 3D structure of TA myoglobin elaborated by homology modeling. However, the results of myoglobin expression in cardiac and skeletal muscles showed that they were both significantly higher than that in plain sheep not only in mRNA but also protein level. We speculated that the higher expression of myoglobin in TA cardiac and skeletal muscles improves their ability to obtain and store oxygen under hypoxic conditions. This study indicated that TA didn't improve the ability of carrying oxygen by changing the molecular structure of myoglobin, but through increasing the expression of myoglobin in cardiac and skeletal muscles.

Experimental in situ investigations into this reaction, however, are limited. Hereby, we present a suite of operando/in situ spectroscopic experiments for structurally well-defined atomically dispersed Rh on phosphotungstic acid during CO oxidation. The identification of several key intermediates and the steady-state catalyst structure indicate that the reactions follow an unconventional Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and that the activation of O-2 is rate-limiting. In situ XPS confirms the contribution of the heteropoly acid support while in situ DRIFT spectroscopy consolidates the oxidation state and CO adsorption of Rh. As such, direct observation of three key components, i.e., metal center, support and substrate, is achieved, providing a clearer picture on CO oxidation on atomically dispersed Rh sites. The obtained information are used to engineer structurally similar catalysts that exhibit T-20 values up to 130 degrees C below the previously reported Rh-1/NPTA.									109	7	0	0	4	1	109			2041-1723			WOS:000461995800001	30902990

The CO2RR catalytic performance was studied using well-defined ab initio calculations. Our results show that the CO2 molecule can be more readily activated on TM @Ti2CO2 than the TM@Ti2CS2 surface. Bader charge analysis reveals that the Ti2CO2 substrate is involved in the adsorption reaction, and enough electrons are injected into the 2 pi *u orbital of CO2, leading to a V-shaped CO2 molecular configuration and partial negative charge distribution. The V-shaped CO2 further reduces the difficulty of the first hydrogenation reaction step. The calculated Delta G of the first hydrogenation reaction on TM@Ti2CO2 was significantly lower than that of the TM@Ti2CS2 counterpart. However, the subsequent CO2 reduction pathways show that the UL of the potential determining step on TM@Ti2CS2 is smaller than that of TM@Ti2CO2. Combining the advantages of both TM@Ti2CS2 and TM@Ti2CO2, we designed a mixed functional group surface with -O and -S to anchor TM atoms. The results show that Cr atoms anchored on the surface of mixed functional groups exhibit high catalytic activity for the selective production of CH4.

The morphological, structural, and optical properties of thin films were characterized and measured using several techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), photoluminescence (PL), and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis). The thickness, structure, and morphology of CuO thin films can be controlled by varying the precursor concentration (C-p) and reaction temperature (T-r), which are also discussed. Moreover, the electrical properties of CuO thin films were also measured in the three-electrode system. The photocurrent density of photocathodes, when synthesized by a 0.5 M solution at 150 degrees C for 12 h, was 0.5 mA/cm(2) at -0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which is 1.8 times higher than that of photocathodes synthesized in a 0.1 M solution at 100 degrees C with the same reaction time. In addition, increasing the reaction temperature and precursor concentration aided in the enhancement of the IPCE and APCE values, which peaked at a wavelength range of 330-400 nm.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2075-4701		WOS:000774146200001		
J	Li, Yanrui; Kong, Tingting; Shen, Shaohua								Artificial Photosynthesis with Polymeric Carbon Nitride: When Meeting Metal Nanoparticles, Single Atoms, and Molecular Complexes								SMALL				15	32	SI				1900772	10.1002/smll.201900772				AUG 2019	2019	Artificial photosynthesis for solar water splitting and CO2 reduction to produce hydrogen and hydrocarbon fuels has been considered as one of the most promising ways to solve increasingly serious energy and environmental problems. As a well-documented metal-free semiconductor, polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) has been widely used and intensively investigated for photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction, owing to its physicochemical stability, visible-light response, and facile synthesis. However, PCN as a photocatalyst still suffers from the fast recombination of electron-hole pairs and poor water redox reaction kinetics, greatly restricting its activity for artificial photosynthesis. Among the various modification approaches developed so far, decorating PCN with metals in different existences of nanoparticles, single atoms and molecular complexes, has been evidently very effective to overcome these limitations to improve photocatalytic performances. In this Review article, a systematic introduction to the state-of-the-art metal/PCN photocatalyst systems is given, with metals in versatility of nanoparticles, single atoms, and molecular complexes. Then, the recent processes of the metal/PCN photocatalyst systems in the applications of artificial photosynthesis, e. g., water splitting and CO2 reduction, are reviewed. Finally, the remaining challenges and opportunities for the development of high efficiency metal/PCN photocatalyst systems are presented and prospected.					1st International Conference of Novel Function Materials (ICNFM)1st International Conference of Novel Function Materials (ICNFM)	SEP 16-18, 2018SEP 16-18, 2018	Univ Sci & Technol LiaoNingUniv Sci & Technol LiaoNing	Anshan, PEOPLES R CHINAAnshan, PEOPLES R CHINA	65	6	0	0	5	0	65			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000480331100008	30977981

Recently, considerable efforts have been devoted to the controllable synthesis, structural modification and practical applications of GDY. For instance, GDY with different morphologies and spatial structures (nanotubes, nanowires, nanowalls, nanoribbons, few-layer nanosheets, etc.) has been successfully synthesized, the functionalization strategies (heteroatom doping/codoping, organic functional group grafting, etc.) for GDY are also greatly enriched, and electrocatalysts based on GDY have also been developed vigorously. Despite a series of achievements, there are still several urgent challenges in the development of GDY, including the precise synthesis, advanced structure characterization and investigation of the structure-performance correlation of GDY-based materials. Herein, we systematically summarize the research progress in the synthesis and modification of GDY in recent years and pay special attention to updating the discoveries of GDY-based materials in the field of electrocatalysis.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2052-1537		WOS:000704932200001

However, AOR seriously suffers from the slow kinetics, and low durability due to its multi-electron transfer process and the poison of the reaction intermediates (N-ads and NOads) to precious metal catalysts. Herein, hyperbranched concave octahedral nanodendrites of PtIrCu (HCOND) with high-index facets of (553}, (331} and (2 21} were developed for the first time using a solvothermal method. The HCOND possesses PtIrrich edges and exhibit highly efficient AOR activity and stability in alkaline media, wherein their onset potential is 0.35 V vs.RHE, which is 60 mV and 160 mV lower than that of the PtIrCu nanoparticles (NPs) (0.41 V) and commercial Pt/C (0.51 V), respectively, and its high mass activity of 40.6 A g(PtIr)(-1) at the 0.5 V vs.RHE is 10.3 times, 2.34 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C (3.9 A gPt -1) and PtIrCu NPs (17.3 A g(PtIr)(-1) ), respectively. In addition, its peak current density (122.9 A g(PtIr)(-1) ) is only reduced by 17.7% after 2000-cycles accelerated durability test. Meanwhile, the performance of PtIrCu HCOND is also better than that of other previously reported morphologies of Pt based catalysts (eg. nanoparticles, nanocubes, nanofilm, nanoflowers). The improvement is critically ascribed to unique advantages of the specific HCOND structure including PtIr rich surface, high-index faceted nanodendrites, strong lattice strain and electronic effects. These characteristics endow the HCOND with great promise to reduce Pt and Ir loading dramatically in the practical application of direct ammonia fuel cells. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

At 45-90% blocking of surface Pt atoms by inorganic sulfur, sulfur appears to adsorb as oligomerized sulfur (S-n). Current-potential RDE data for the HOR at Na2S-exposed Pt/VC films were fitted to a recently developed dual-pathway kinetics model. At a submonolayer Sn coverage of surface Pt atoms, the exchange current densities for the potential-independent Tafel-Volmer pathway, or two-site HOR pathway, decrease by about 10-50-fold compared to electrochemically cleaned Pt/VC films. Exchange current densities for the single-site, potential-dependent Heyrovsky-Volmer pathway decrease by comparable factors at the same levels of sulfur exposure. The potential-range constant gamma increases in the presence of adsorbed S-n. The exposure of Pt/VC to aqueous solutions of MPA, an organosulfur species, results in similarly diminished HOR exchange current densities at Pt/VC, as observed for Na2S exposure, but yields higher values of gamma. The model is sufficiently sensitive to delineate the effects of different catalyst poisons on HOR kinetics at carbon-supported nanoscopic Pt. (C) 2009 The Electrochemical Society.

In this study, one protocol is first demonstrated to drive the shell amorphization of nanoporous Ag-Bi (a-NPSB) catalyst with the spatially interconnected ligament during the initial stage of CO2ER This newborn a-NPSB bestows the outstanding catalysis, evidenced by a Faradaic efficiency of 88.4% for formate production at -1.15 V vs RHE, specific current density of 21.2 mA cm(-2), and mass specific current density of 321 mA mg(-1). The unique catalysis is considered as the collective contribution of the conductive ligament internally and amorphous Bi2O3 shell with about 3.2 nm thickness externally. Simultaneous obtaining of the conductivity of inner metals and catalytic activity of the amorphous shell will pave a new avenue for designing a robust electrode during electrochemical reaction.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000551488400024	32432454

Thermal treatments during synthesis of hematite are found to affect the performance of hematite electrodes considerably. Herein, we present hematite thin films fabricated via one-step oxidation of Fe by rapid thermal processing (RTP). In particular, we investigate the effect of oxidation temperature on the PEC properties of hematite. Films prepared at 750 degrees C show the highest activity towards water oxidation. These films show the largest average grain size and the highest charge carrier density, as determined from electron microscopy and impedance spectroscopy analysis. We believe that the fast processing enabled by RTP makes this technique a preferred method for investigation of novel materials and architectures, potentially also on nanostructured electrodes, where retaining high surface area is crucial to maximize performance.									34	1	0	0	3	1	34			2045-2322			WOS:000391916900001	28091573

IrOx NPs were electrodeposited on the graphite surface, and their electrocatalytic activity for water oxidation was correlated with the surface concentrations of different redox states of IrOx as a function of the deposition time and potential. Under optimal conditions, the overpotential of the reaction was reduced to 0.21 V and the electrocatalytic current density was 43 mAcm(-2) at 1 V versus Ag/AgCl (3M KCl) and pH 7. These results beneficially compete with previously reported electrocatalytic oxidations of water by IrOx NPs electrodeposited onto glassy carbon and indium tin oxide electrodes and provide the basis for the further development of efficient IrOx NP-based electrocatalysts immobilized on high-surface-area carbon electrode materials.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000341565600028	25044749

However, oxidized RM molecules migrate to the lithium anode and react with lithium, which results in the accumulation of surface corrosion products that weaken the redox activity of the RM. This paper presents a new combination of phenothiazine (PTZ) as an RM and an ammonium-based ionic liquid (IL) source as a protective agent to prevent the side reactions with lithium and to enhance the electrochemical performance of LABs. IL-functionalized PTZ (IL-PTZ) was successfully synthesized through N-alkylation, quaternization, and anion-exchange reactions. IL-PTZ improved the chemical stability of the RM molecules on the lithium surface as well as the electrochemical performance. A microstructural analysis revealed that the IL group in the IL-PTZ molecules facilitated smooth lithium stripping/plating by blocking the side reactions between the RM and lithium. Compared with the LAB with the PTZ electrolyte, that with the IL-PTZ electrolyte exhibited a significantly higher discharge capacity (2500 mA h/g vs 1500 mA h/g) and a cycle life that was 2 times longer. The IL-PTZ molecule was demonstrated to exhibit great potential as a novel soluble catalyst for application in high-performance LABs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000743232500001	35005895

Ti0.9Ce0.05V0.05O2-delta-350 degrees C showed the best SCR activity and N-2 selectivity in a broad temperature window of 150-400 degrees C. in which more than 83% NOx was reduced with the superior N-2 selectivity above 95%. The influence of the ignition temperature for CS on the physical and morphological properties, the crystalline phase, the microstructure, the redox behavior, the oxidation state, the reactants adsorption capability, and the evolution of the surface nitrate and acid sites after the adsorption of NOx and NH3 was extensively investigated in detail using comprehensive characterization techniques including N-2 physisorption, XRD, SEM, TEM, FTIR. EPR, and XPS. The increase of the ignition temperature, the decrease of the specific surface area, the total desorption pore volume, the surface fractal dimension, and the concentration of the chemisorbed oxygen, and the increase of the average pore diameter and the particle size, which may be the main reasons for the decline of the NOx removal efficiency and the N-2 selectivity. In addition, the NOx/NH3-TPD results suggest that the Ti0.9Ce0.05V0.05O2-delta catalysts prepared at lower ignition temperatures could provide more chemisorption NOx and NH3 species, and simultaneously enhance the activation of both species that result in the improvement of the SCR activity. Furthermore, the in situ DRIFTS results indicate that the active monodentate nitrate and bridging nitrate species come from the NOx adsorption and that the ionic NH4+ bound to the BrOnsted acid sites are active species and essential for the SCR process. The increase of the ignition temperature decreases the key surface nitrate species and acid sites, and thus the relevant NH3-SCR activity and selectivity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Morphology characterization and X-ray diffraction analysis reveal that ZnTe presents irregular granular shape and cubic crystal structure. Moreover, Mott-Schottky measurement shows that the conduction band potential of ZnTe is-0.84 V (vs NHE). With Eosin Y (EY) sensitization, ZnTe exhibits superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity (223.5 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)). Meanwhile, WC-ZnTe heterojunction is constructed by depositing ZnTe nanoparticles on bulk WC and obtains the optimal H-2 generation rate (559.1 mmol g(-1 )h(-1)) under EY sensitization. Electrochemical and photoluminescence results further prove that WC as electron bridge could reduce the interfacial resistance and suppress e(-)-h(+) pairs recombination. This study explores the potential application of ZnTe as a newly active photocatalyst in photocatalytic water splitting, and emphasizes the synergistic effect of dye sensitization and bridge engineering.

Significant sequence similarity is observed with enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (ENR), the other reductase of FAS, and the short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase (SDR) family.Results: The first crystal structure of BKR has been determined at 2.3 Angstrom resolution in a binary complex with an NADP(+) cofactor, The structure reveals a homotetramer in which each subunit has a classical dinucleotide-binding fold, A triad of Ser154, Tyr167 and Lys171 residues is found at the active site, characteristic of the SDR family, Overall BKR has a very similar structure to ENR with good superimposition of catalytically important groups. Modelling of the substrate into the active site of BKR indicates the need for conformational changes in the enzyme.Conclusions: A catalytic mechanism can be proposed involving the conserved triad, Helix alpha 6 must shift its position to permit substrate binding to BKR and might act as a flexible lid on the active site. The similarities in fold, mechanism and substrate binding between BKR, which catalyzes a carbon-oxygen double-bond reduction, and ENR, the carbon-carbon double-bond oxidoreductase in FAS, suggest a close evolutionary link during the development of the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway.									87	8	0	0	82	0	102			0969-2126	1878-4186		WOS:000086607700003	10801480

Several strategies have been proposed to solve them, being photocatalysis a very promising one because of its ease of application and low cost. In the search for active photocatalysts, those based on graphite-like carbon nitride (g-C3N4) are becoming good alternatives for various reactions. In this work, the properties of g-C3N4/MoS2/MnOOH composite material and its photocatalytic behavior for the production of hydrogen (H-2) under UV radiation were investigated. RESULTS The composite material was synthesized by applying a combination of thermal condensation and hydrothermal methods. According to the results of X-ray diffraction (XRD), ultraviolet diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-DRS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), good dispersion of the phases and the formation of a heterojunction were observed. The band gap value of the composite material, calculated by the Kubelka-Munk equation using the values obtained from UV-DRS analysis, was lower than those of the individual components, while it also had a much longer electron-hole recombination time, according to photoluminescence analysis. As a consequence of a synergistic effect, the activity of the proposed composite photocatalyst was superior in the reaction of water splitting, with a kinetic constant of 466 mu mol h(-1) and a production rate of 1750 mu mol H-2 gcat-1 h(-1) (50 and 21% higher than those obtained with MoS2 and g-C3N4, respectively). CONCLUSION Because of its high activity and stability, g-C3N4/MoS2/MnOOH composite photocatalyst is an excellent alternative for H-2 production by the water splitting reaction.

J	Chao, Yuguang; Zheng, Jianfeng; Zhang, Haixia; Ma, Yuanyuan; Li, Feng; Tan, Yisheng; Zhu, Zhenping								Constructing Film Photocatalyst with Abundant Interfaces between CdS and Ni3S2 Nanosheets for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production								ENERGY TECHNOLOGY				6	11			2132	2138		10.1002/ente.201800180				NOV 2018	2018	Large scale and sustainable solar hydrogen evolution through photocatalytic water splitting requires highly active and stable earth-abundant co-catalysts to reduce water to H-2. There are still a series of key challenges existed for the practical application, although many efforts have been made, such as low efficiency, difficult recovery of powder catalyst and so on. In this work, we constructed a film-like photocatalyst CdS-Ni3S2/NF with abundant interfaces or junctions for the first time by integrating the CdS and Ni3S2 nanosheets supported on nickel foam (NF). The resultant photocatalyst exhibits a photocatalytic H-2 production rate of 100.50 mmol g(CdS)(-1) h(-1), which is about 6.8 times that for CdS-2wt%Pt/NF (14.86 mmol g(-1) h(-1)). And the rate of H-2 evolution can be expressed as 589.86 mu mol cm(-2) day(-1), which means 132 L H-2 could be generated by using 1 m(2) CdS-Ni3S2/NF photocatalyst under visible light irradiation in 12 h. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was attributed to the rich interfaces or junctions between CdS and Ni3S2 nanosheets, and excellent kinetic of Ni3S2 nanosheets for reducing water to H-2. This work provides a new avenue for developing high performance photocatalyst system for practically renewable H-2 energy generation and environmental remediation.									20	1	0	0	2	0	20			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000451004100005

However, the instability of CuO in amine aqueous solution limits the applications of CuO-based photocatalysts in the photocatalytic H-2 evolution. In this work, a novel dodecahedral nitrogen (N)-doped carbon (C) coated CuO-In2O3 p-n heterojunction (DNCPH) is designed and synthesized by directly pyrolyzing benzimidazole-modified dodecahedral Cu/In-based metal-organic frameworks, showing long-term stability in triethanolamine (TEOA) aqueous solution and excellent photocatalytic H-2 production efficiency. The improved stability of DNCPH in TEOA solution is ascribed to the alleviation of electron deficiency in CuO by forming the p-n heterojunction and the protection with coated N-doped C layer. Based on detailed theoretical calculations and experimental studies, it is found that the improved separation efficiency of photogenerated electron/hole pairs and the mediated adsorption behavior (| increment G(H)(*)|-> 0) by coupling N-doped C layer with CuO-In2O3 p-n heterojunction lead to the excellent photocatalytic H-2 production efficiency of DNCPH. This work provides a feasible strategy for effectively applying CuO-based photocatalysts in photocatalytic H-2 production.									96	8	0	0	10	0	98			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000501831900001

Therefore, four methods of AgTaO(3)perovskite synthesis, such as hydrothermal, solvothermal, sol-gel and solid state reactions, were proposed in this study to identify the one with the highest hydrogen generation efficiency by the water splitting reaction. The comprehensive results clearly show that the solid state reaction (SSR) led to the obtainment of a sample with an almost seven times higher photocatalytic activity than the other methods. Furthermore, four ionic liquids, all possessing nitrogen in the form of organic cations (two imidazoliums with different anions, ammonium and tetrazolium), were used for the first time to prepare composites consisting of AgTaO(3)modified with IL and Pt, simultaneously. The effect of the ionic liquids (ILs) and Pt nanoparticles' presence on the structure, morphology, optical properties, elemental composition and the effectiveness of the hydrogen generation was investigated and discussed. The morphology investigation revealed that the AgTaO(3)photocatalysts with the application of [OMIM]-cation based ILs created smaller granules (<500 nm), whereas [TBA] [Cl] and [TPTZ] [Cl] ILs caused the formation of larger particles (up to 2 mu m). We found that various ILs used for the synthesis did not improve the photocatalytic activity of the obtained samples in comparison with pristine AgTaO3. It was detected that the compound with the highest ability for hydrogen generation under UV-Vis irradiation was the AgTaO3_0.2% Pt (248.5 mu mol center dot g(-1)), having an almost 13 times higher efficiency in comparison with the non-modified pristine sample. It is evidenced that the enhanced photocatalytic activity of modified composites originated mainly from the presence of the platinum particles. The mechanism of photocatalytic H(2)production under UV-Vis light irradiation in the presence of an AgTaO3_IL_Pt composite in the water splitting reaction was also proposed.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1996-1944		WOS:000580273800001	32932666	
J	PARK, YI; CHOW, WS; ANDERSON, JM				Chow, Wah Soon/D-2010-2009	Park, Youn-Il/0000-0003-2912-2821			LIGHT INACTIVATION OF FUNCTIONAL PHOTOSYSTEM-II IN LEAVES OF PEAS GROWN IN MODERATE LIGHT DEPENDS ON PHOTON EXPOSURE								PLANTA				196	3			401	411						JUN 1995	1995	To determine the dependence of in vivo photosystem (PS) II function on photon exposure and to assign the relative importance of some photoprotective strategies of PSII against excess light, the maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) and the content of functional PSII complexes (measured by repetitive flash yield of oxygen evolution) were determined in leaves of pea (Pisum sativum L.) grown in moderate light. The modulation of PSII functionality in vivo was induced by varying either the duration (from 0 to 3 h) of light treatment (fixed at 1200 or 1800 mu mol photons . m(-2) . s(-1)) or irradiance (from 0 to 3000 mu mol photons . m(-2) . s(-1)) at a fixed duration (1 h) after infiltration of leaves with water (control), lincomycin (an inhibitor of chloroplast-encoded protein synthesis), nigericin (an uncoupler), or dithiothreitol (an inhibitor of the xanthophyll cycle) through the cut petioles of leaves of 22 to 24-day-old plants. We observed a reciprocity of irradiance and duration of illumination for PSII function, demonstrating that inactivation of functional PSII depends on the total number of photons absorbed, not on the rate of photon absorption. The Fv/Fm ratios from photoinhibitory light-treated leaves, with or without inhibitors, declined pseudo-linearly with photon exposure. The number of functional PSII complexes declined multiphasically with increasing photon exposure, in the following decreasing order of inhibitor effect: lincomycin > nigericin > DTT, indicating the central role of D1 protein turnover. While functional PSII and Fv/Fm ratio showed a linear relationship under high photon exposure conditions, in inhibitor-treated leaves the Fv/Fm ratio failed to reveal the loss of up to 25% of the total functional PSII under low photon exposure. The loss of this 25% of less-stable functional PSII was accompanied by a decrease of excitation-energy trapping capacity at the reaction centre of PSII (revealed by the fluorescence parameter, 1/Fo-1/Fm, where Fo and Fm stand for chlorophyll fluorescence when PSII reaction centres are open and closed, respectively), but not by a loss of excitation energy at the antenna (revealed by the fluorescence parameter, 1/Fm). We conclude that (i) PSII is an intrinsic photon counter under photoinhibitory conditions, (ii) PSII functionality is mainly regulated by D1 protein turnover, and to a lesser extent, by events mediated via the transthylakoid pH gradient, and (iii) peas exhibit PSII heterogeneity in terms of functional stability during photon exposure.-									136	9	1	0	122	0	145			0032-0935			WOS:A1995RJ24800001

These microzones are small-scale anoxic pores, embedded within oxygen-rich porous media and can act as anaerobic reaction sites producing reduction compounds such as nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas. Microbes are a key control on nutrient transformation in hyporheic sediment, but their associated biomass growth is also capable of altering hydraulic flux, leading to potential bioclogging. Here, we developed one of the first computational modeling approaches that combined hydraulics and microbial conditions to explore the continuous evolution of microzones in stream sediments. The model assessed stream and sediment conditions with different hydraulic flux (0.1-1.0 m/day Darcy flux), nutrient concentrations (O-2 = 8 mg/L, OrgC = 20 mg/L, NO3- = 1.5-3 mg/L, and NH3 = 0.5-1 mg/L), and biomass scenarios (with and without). The model domain is a pore network model with random sized pore-throat radii creating heterogeneous and anisotropic flow that is representative of a natural streambed composed of medium sand with a hydraulic conductivity of 0.8 m/day. Results from 30 day simulations indicate that hyporheic microzone formation will occur and microzone distributions are not simply controlled by residence time alone, rather by the complex interactions of hydraulic flux, nutrient concentrations, and biomass, with bioclogging having strong feedbacks on both hydraulics and nutrients. Under all conditions with biomass growth, anoxic microzones were unstable, perishing a few days after formation, because bioclogging primarily occurs near the influent (downwelling) area of the hyporheic zone. In turn, this bioclogging shifts transport conditions from advection-dominated to diffusion-dominated transport, removing all oxic regions in the hyporheic zone. Overall, results from the modeling show that anoxic microzones are likely to form under many hyporheic zone conditions, and be dynamic through space and time as they are dependent on both hydraulic flux and nutrient transport.Plain Language Summary Recent experimental studies detected a paradox occurring in stream ecosystems: that there are small zones within saturated stream sediments whose properties and functions vastly differ from the majority of the surrounding stream sediment. These "microzones" are likely ubiquitous in stream sediments but very difficult to locate and sample due to their small size. Microzones are exciting because they might be a key to understanding a range of other confounding findings in stream research, such as why streams can remove more pollutants or produce more greenhouse gases than previously expected. Microzones often occur in locations where there is little to no oxygen, which can lead to varying outcomes for solutes, nutrients, and organisms. Despite their small size, we can start to get clues into microzone formation and function through modeling studies. Here we assess microzones by modeling complex, interacting physical and biological processes to see what conditions promote, suppress, or sustain microzones. We found microbial biology, often overlooked in stream sediment studies, plays a highly important role in microzone processes, especially by creating biomass that clogs sediments and prevents microzones from forming or functioning in the stream ecosystem.									9	0	0	0	5	0	9			0043-1397	1944-7973		WOS:000538000800011

Unfortunately, there is a lack of evidence about the optimal management of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and even less is available in patients on maintenance hemodialysis therapy than in the general population. In this retrospective, observational, single -center study, we analyzed the clinical course and outcomes of all maintenance hemodialysis patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from March 12th to April 10th, 2020 as con firmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Baseline features, clinical course, laboratory data, and different therapies were compared between survivors and nonsurvivors to identify risk factors associated with mortality. Among the 36 patients, 11 (30.5%) died, and 7 were able to be discharged within the observation period. Clinical and radiological evolution during the first week of admission were predictive of mortality. Among the 36 patients, 18 had worsening of their clinical status, as de fined by severe hypoxia with oxygen therapy requirements greater than 4 L/min and radiological worsening. Signi ficantly, 11 of those 18 patients (61.1%) died. None of the classical cardiovascular risk factors in the general population were associated with higher mortality. Compared to survivors, nonsurvivors had signi ficantly longer dialysis vintage, increased lactate dehydrogenase (490 U/l ? 120 U/l vs. 281 U/l ? 151 U/l, P = 0.008) and C -reactive protein levels (18.3 mg/dl ? 13.7 mg/dl vs. 8.1 mg/dl ? 8.1 mg/dl, P = 0.021), and a lower lymphocyte count (0.38 3 10 3 / m l ? 0.14 3 10 3 / m l vs. 0.76 3 10 3 / m l ? 0.48 3 10 3 / m l, P = 0.04) 1 week after clinical onset. Thus, the mortality among hospitalized hemodialysis patients diagnosed with COVID-19 is high. Certain laboratory tests can be used to predict a worsening clinical course.

It is located close to the famous Dongping Te-Au deposit; however, few researches have performed on the Archean metamorphic rock hosted Te-Au deposits, which precludes the studies on enrichment processes and mechanisms of Te-Au deposits in the Zhangjiakou district. In this contribution, four mineralization stages have been recognized in the Dabaiyang deposit: (1) K-feldspar-quartz veins; (2) quartz-pyrite veins; (3) polymetallic sulfide-quartz veins; and (4) calcite and quartz veins. Metallic minerals in this deposit include pyrite, chalcopyrite, galena, sphalerite, bornite, altaite, hessite, petzite, tetradymite, tellurobismuthite, native gold and electrum, and most of them were precipitated in stage III. Petrography, fluid inclusion microthermometry, and laser Raman spectroscopy revealed that the ore-forming fluid was a medium temperature H2O-NaCl hydrothermal system. Fluid temperatures evolved from 264-337 degrees C to 233-323 degrees C to 209-268 degrees C to 130-245.C, and salinities varied from 1.2 to 10.3 wt% to 1.2-8.8 wt% to 4.3-10.5 wt% to 3.8-8.3 wt% NaCl equivalent. Ore-forming fluids yield H and O isotope compositions of 2.4% to 4.9% and 101.2% to 75.5%, respectively, and 3He/4He and 40Ar/36Ar ratios of 1.31-1.58 and 3489.0-21824.1, respectively. The hydrothermal fluids were derived initially from magmatic water (stage I), but more mixture of magmatic and meteoric water or heated meteoric water was added to the system (stages II and III), and significant water-rock exchange with the Sanggan metamorphic rock happened during evolution. Calculated physicochemical conditions of ore mineral formation shows that pH decreased, logfO(2) and logfS(2) did not change significantly from the early to the late stage; logfTe(2) and log alpha Au+(aq)/alpha Ag+( aq) values of stage III are 10.7 to 9.8 and 6.8, respectively. Ore-forming fluid did not suffer boiling during evolution, but mixing with lowtemperature meteoric water and water-rock reaction were the dominant mechanisms that led to the precipitation of sulfides, tellurides and Au-Ag minerals in the deposit. The Dabaiyang Te-Au deposit is an epithermal gold deposit and its various hydrothermal fluid sources compared with intrusion hosted Te-Au deposits led to their differences in Te and Au contents, hydrothermal systems and mineral deposition mechanisms.									6	2	0	0	0	0	6			0169-1368	1872-7360		WOS:000612803600002		
J	Chen Bu-ming; Guo Zhong-cheng; Yang Xian-wan; Zhang Jie-lei; Long Jin-ming								Progress on electrodeposition of doped-PbO2 surface								Chinese Journal of Nonferrous Metals				18	9			1711	20						Sept. 2008	2008	A great interest was attracted in the improvement of lead dioxide as anode material owing to its high electriconductivity, high oxygen overpotential and chemiinertness. During electrodepositing pure lead dioxide, the electrocatalytic activity of PbO2 electrodes, as well as their stability, can often be considerably enhanced by the incorporation of some foreign ions or fine particles added to the electrodeposition solution. The application fields of PbO2 were elucidated, and the preparation methods and influencing factors of the undoped-PbO2,ion-doped PbO2 and matrix composites in the absence or presence of cations, anions and suspended particles, including Bi3+, F-, Fe3+, Co2+, Ce3+, Ru3+, As3+, Co3O4, RuO2, PbO2, Al2O3, TiO2 and so on, were reported and discussed. To overcome the intrinsic shortcomings of the catalytic activity and brittleness of PbO2 coatings, this review was also extended to the advantages and disadvantages by doping ion and particles. It is shown that the electrocatalytic activity of PbO2 coatings can be greatly enhanced by incorporation of some ions, such as Bi3+, Ce3+, Ru3+, Ag+, Co2+, F-, Fe3+, F-+Fe3+ and F-+Co2+, while In3+, PO43- and As3+ decrease the rate of deposition of lead dioxide. Several models propose that the incorporation of the foreign species in PbO2 occur at defect sites: the Pb(IV) is substituted with the altervalent metallic cations followed by oxidation of the incorporated the altervalent metallic cations to highvalent, for example like Bi3+, Ce3+, Ru3+, Ag+, Co2+ and As3+, and F- replaces OH groups while Fe3+ can replace Pb2+ or Pb4+ at low and high temperature, respectively. There is a synergic effect of the F and Fe or Co dopants. The electrocatalytic function of the composite oxide layers is probably related to the catalytic particles and the application range of the materials, for example, the PbO2+RuO2 layers exhibit fairly high electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction in H2SO4 solution, and the PbO2+Co3O4 layers exhibit the best electrocatalytic activity in NaOH solution. However, the possible effect of surface roughness of the PbO2-matrix composites cannot be entirely neglected. The brittleness of PbO2 coatings is greatly improved with doping PTFE or TiO2 particles. In addition, the developing tendency of the doped coating of lead dioxide was prospected.									3	10	0	0	0	0	11			1004-0609			INSPEC:10554248

Autotrophic photosynthesis by PSI-deficient mutants was stable both under anaerobic conditions and in air (21 percent O-2) at an actinic intensity of 200 microeinsteins per square meter per second. This PSII photosynthesis, which was sufficient to support cell development and mobility, may also occur in wild-type green algae and higher plants. The mutants can survive under 2000 microeinsteins per square meter per second with air, although they have less resistance to photoinhibition.									26	2	0	0	15	0	29			0036-8075			WOS:A1996UY20200042	8662525

Herein, the electrochemical overall water splitting is reported by using the hydrothermally synthesized binder free cobalt iron phosphate thin films on low cost stainless steel substrates as a conducting backbone for the first time. The effect of composition ratio variation of cobalt and iron was studied on the structural, compositional, morphological, and surface electronic properties by conducting various characterizations which results in amorphous hydrous cobalt iron phosphate having mesoporosity. The as synthesized cobalt iron phosphate having composition ratio (50:50 of Co:Fe) exhibits excellent electrochemical OER and HER catalytic water splitting performance. Best performing electrode exhibits smallest overpotentials of 251.9 mV and 55.5 mV for OER and HER respectively at 10 mA/cm(2) current density. To split water molecule into the H-2 and O-2 by overall water splitting in same alkaline medium, the potential of 1.75 V was required after long duration (100 h) catalysis.

Here, we present experimental results for a tonalitic system at a pressure of 200 MPa and under water-saturated conditions. Melting experiments were performed at temperatures between 700 and 1000 degrees C in externally heated HCM pressure vessels, with oxygen fugacity controlled close to the Ni-NiO buffer equilibrium (NNO) employing an argon-methane mixture as pressure medium and Co-Pd redox sensors to verify fO(2) conditions. Natural rock powder of a medium-K tonalite from the Adamello Batholith in Northern Italy served as experimental starting material. Based on compositional data of stable phases in the run products and images of entire run charges, mass balance calculations as well as image processing were performed to investigate the evolution of the crystal/melt ratio with respect to temperature. Furthermore, compositional trends of minerals as well as the liquid line of descent of residual melts were obtained. Orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene and plagioclase were identified as near-liquidus phases (below 990 degrees C). At 900 degrees C, amphibole joins the solid-phase assemblage at the expense of clinopyroxene, indicating the existence of a peritectic relationship. After an initial near-linear decrease with temperature, residual melt fractions exhibit a plateau of 45-55 vol. % between 750 and 850 degrees C, followed by a rapid decrease coinciding with quartz saturation at 725 degrees C. Compositions of residual liquids evolve along a typical calc-alkaline differentiation trend with decreasing temperature (increasing SiO2 and decreasing TiO2, Al2O3, CaO, MgO and FeO contents) and become peraluminous below 900 degrees C. Intermediate to acidic rocks from the Adamello follow the experimental liquid line of descent indicating that the observed compositional spread of the natural intermediate composition rock record can be explained by low-pressure magma differentiation and liquid extraction. Experimentally determined zircon saturation levels are at low temperatures distinctly lower compared to existing and often used Zr-saturation models, but fully consistent with observed and modelled Zr-evolution trends from the natural rock record of the Southern Adamello Batholith inferring that zircon saturation in these intermediate to felsic plutonic rocks occurred at 800-830 degrees C corresponding to a melt fraction of about 50 vol. %.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			0010-7999	1432-0967		WOS:000489742300001		
J	Wen, Shengwu; Huang, Guozhi; Wu, Shikai; Li, Jinyu; Qu, Ailan								Determinant factors of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity for Schiff-base conjugated polymers								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				374				1055	1063		10.1016/j.cej.2019.06.003				OCT 15 2019	2019	Conjugated polymers are promising catalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) from water. Here, a series of imine-linked conjugated polymers were synthesized via Schiff-base condensation using an easy and low-temperature protocol with cheap raw materials and green solvent. Several readily available diaminobenzene with different amino substitution positions on the phenyl ring were used to react with terephthalaldehyde, leading to formation of polymers varying from one dimensional (1D) nanorods to two dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) networks. The obtained polymer with 1D crystalline structure was found to show the highest hydrogen production rate at similar to 24.3 mu mol/h under visible light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm) without adding any additional metal co-catalysts. Detailed analysis of the structure, morphology and photoelectron-chemical properties of these as-synthesized polymers leads to the conclusion that 1D nanorods and high LUMO (the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) play more important roles than large conjugation and surface area in improving the PHE capacity of polymer. This study illustrated a protocol for the production of metal-free photocatalyst synthesized using cheap and green solvent at low-temperature.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000477652900097

Sb2Se3 semiconductors satisfy most of the demands expected for an ideal highly efficient photocathode, including favorable cost and optoelectronic properties. Herein, we have demonstrated outstanding photoelectrodes using a noble-metal-free catalyst, namely, a MoSx-decorated low-cost Sb2Se3/In2S3 heterojunction, as the photocathode. This enabled a maximum photocurrent density of up to -27 mA cm(-2) (0 V vs. RHE, 100 mW cm(-2), AM 1.5G filter) with a remarkable half solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency (STH) of 2.6%, obtained via decreasing charge recombination and accelerating charge transfer through morphological optimization of the In2S3 layer.									11	2	0	0	1	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000590158400021

Herein, we investigate the potential usage of a single-atom catalyst, in which isolated cobalt atoms are supported on porous graphitic carbon nitride (Co/g-C3N4), for CO oxidation. Based on the adsorption/co-adsorption energies of O-2, CO, 2O(2), CO + O-2 and 2CO, the screening criteria and the reaction mechanisms of CO oxidation, including the Eley-Rideal, New Eley-Rideal, Langmuir-Hinshelwood, and termolecular Eley-Rideal mechanisms, are established and compared. In particular, the energy barriers of the rate-limiting steps for the CO oxidation process by all possible reaction pathways are in a range from 0.21 to 0.59 eV, suggesting that the Co/g-C3N4 catalyst can boost CO oxidation at low temperature. Moreover, the preparation of the SAC (Co/g-C3N4) by using CoCl2 as an appropriate metal precursor and the stability (up to 600 K) are evaluated by ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The high stability and excellent activity of the Co/g-C3N4 SAC for CO oxidation offer a high possibility of clean energy production.									33	0	0	0	2	0	33			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000504106900032	31825440	
J	Prasad, SM; Zeeshan, M								Effect of UV-B and monocrotophos, singly and in combination, on photosynthetic activity and growth of non-heterocystous cyanobacterium Plectonema boryanum								ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY				52	2			175	184		10.1016/j.envexpbot.2004.01.013				OCT 2004	2004	The impact of artificial ultraviolet-B (UV-B 280-315 nm) irradiation and monocrotophos (an organophosphorus insecticide), singly and in combination, on survival, growth and photosynthetic activities and energy transfer within the pigments has been studied in a non-heterocystous cyanobacterium Plectonema boryanum. Survival and growth of the cyanobacterium decreased with selected dose of UV-B (30 min and 90 min) and monocrotophos (5 mug ml(-1)). The various doses of UV-B (30, 60, 90 and 120 min exposures) damaged the photosynthetic pigments, phycocyanin, carotenoids and chlorophyll a (Chl a); phycocyanin, however, appeared to be the main target of UV-B. This was further proved by the prominent decrease in phycocyanin absorption peak in intact cells. C-14-fixation was found to be more sensitive to UV-B and monocrotophos, singly and in combination than photosynthetic oxygen evolution. Photosynthetic electron transport activity decreased in response to UV-B and monocrotophos individually as well as in their combined dose (UV-B + monocrotophos). This inhibition was due to a greater susceptibility of PSII than PSI. UV-B and monocrotophos either alone or in combination induced inhibition of PSII activity and its partial restoration by artificial electron donors (DPC, NH2OH and MnCl2) suggests that these stresses blocked the electron flow at water oxidation side. However. less restoration in combination of these stresses and 90 min UV-B exposure alone indicated that the PSII reaction centre was also affected. Suppression in emission peak (lambda650 nm) of phycocyanin revealed that both the stresses, either singly or in combination, altered the energy transfer efficiency of phycocyanin to PSII. The present findings suggest that the doses of UV-B radiation and monocrotophos singly and in combination, have adversely affected the photosynthetic activity of P. boryanum, leadin- to the significant decrease in survival and growth. The interactive effect of both the stresses was, however, less than additive. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									26	3	0	0	23	0	32			0098-8472	1873-7307		WOS:000224143800009

The alpha-Fe2O3 nanoparticles are added to increase the absorption of laser light, however, they also play a significant role in transition kinetics of alumina. It is shown that calcination in air leads to implementation of Fe3+ ions in corundum structure, while calcination in reducing atmosphere leads to creation of metallic iron. Moreover, it is demonstrated that for alumina granules consisting of a mixture of micron-size alpha-alumina, submicron alpha-alumina and nano-size gamma - /delta-alumina, it is possible to obtain a system composed of two corundum-type structures with different Fe doping levels and the ratio of these two phases can be controlled by calcination temperature.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000482244200039

In this work, a facile preparation strategy was proposed to fabricate ultrafine CoPx nanoparticles on the surface of CdS. The effective H-2 production over ultrafine CoPx nanoparticles has been realized. In addition, we found Ca2+ as an alkaline earth metal ion can promote the interaction between CdS and CoPx. Both experimental results and density function theory indicate that the Ca2+ dopant can act as surface trapping sites on CdS and lead to efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. The integration of CoPx and Ca2+ dopant can synergistically enhance both photogenerated electron-hole separation as well as interfacial charge transfer, which enables a remarkable improvement on the H-2 generation performance of CdS. The photocatalytic H-2 generation rate of Ca modified CoPx@CdS can reach up to 2441.5 mu mol h(-1) under optimal conditions with the apparent quantum efficiency as high as 35.4% at 420 nm. This finding motivates the development of simplified fabrication procedures for constructing and modifying cobalt active sites with efficient photocatalytic H-2 generation performance.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000720452000003

It has been proved that the catalytic properties of these materials are strongly influenced by several factors at different levels, including the electrode morphology, reaction channels, three-phase interface, and surface active sites. Recent developments of mesoscience allow one to study the relationship between the apparent catalytic performance of electrocatalytic materials with these factors from different levels. In this review, following a brief introduction of new mesoscience, we summarize the effect of mesoscience on electrocatalytic material design, including modulating the geometric and electronic structures of materials focusing on morphology (particulate, fiber, film, array, monolith, and superlattice), pore structure (microporous, mesoporous, and hierarchical), size (single atoms, nanoclusters, and nanoparticles), multiple components (alloys, heterostructures, and multiple ligands), and crystal structures (crystalline, amorphous, and multiple crystal phases). By evaluating the electrocatalytic performance of catalytic materials tuned at the mesoscale, we paint a picture of how these factors at different levels affect the final system performance and then provide a new direction to better understand and design catalytic materials from the viewpoint of mesoscience.

The threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is a euryhaline species with populations in both marine and freshwater environments, where the physiological and genomic basis for salinity tolerance adaptation is not fully understood. Therefore, our main objective in this study was to investigate gene expression of three targeted osmoregulatory genes (Na+/K+-ATPase (ATPA13), cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) and a voltage gated potassium channel gene (KCNH4) and one stress related heat shock protein gene (HSP70)) in gill tissue from marine and freshwater populations when exposed to non-native salinity for periods ranging from five minutes to three weeks. Overall, the targeted genes showed highly plastic expression profiles, in addition the expression of ATP1A3 was slightly higher in saltwater adapted fish and KCNH4 and HSP70 had slightly higher expression in freshwater. As no pronounced changes were observed in the expression profiles of the targeted genes, this indicates that the osmoregulatory apparatuses of both the marine and landlocked freshwater stickleback population have not been environmentally canalized, but are able to respond plastically to abrupt salinity challenges.									27	0	0	0	22	0	27			1932-6203			WOS:000345745400014	25265477

J	Stevens, GB; Lukins, PB					Stevens, Gregory/0000-0002-7258-4645			Effects of Ca2+ and EGTA on P680(center dot+) reduction kinetics and O-2 evolution of Photosystem II								BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-BIOENERGETICS				1605	1-3			21	34		10.1016/S0005-2728(03)00061-6				AUG 18 2003	2003	We report for the first time significant changes in the P680(.+) reduction kinetics of Photosystem II (PS II) in which the 17 and 23 kDa extrinsic polypeptides are intact, in the presence of Ca2+ or ethylene glycol bis (beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) which were added to vary the Ca2+ concentration from 5 muM to 30 mM. The decrease in the extent of normal P680(.+) reduction decay with lifetimes of 40-370 ns and a corresponding increase in the extent of kinetics with lifetimes of 20-220 mus was interpreted as being due to electron transfer from Y-Z to P680(.+) being replaced by slow forward conduction and by processes including P680(.+)/Q(A)(-) recombination: The question of whether changes in P680(.+) reduction kinetics were caused by loss of Ca2+ from PS II or by direct interaction of EGTA with PS II was addressed by lowering the free-Ca2+ concentration of suspensions of PS II core complexes by serial dilution in the absence of EGTA. Despite a significant decrease in the rate of O-2 evolution after this treatment, only small changes in the P680(.+) reduction kinetics were observed. Loss of Ca2+ did not affect P680(.+) reduction associated with electron transfer from Y-Z. Since much larger changes in the P680(.+) reduction kinetics of intact PS II occurred at comparable free-Ca2+ concentrations in the presence of EGTA, we conclude that EGTA influenced the P680(.+) reduction kinetics by directly interacting with PS II rather than by lowering the free Ca2+ concentration of the surrounding media. Notwithstanding these effects, we show that useful information about Ca2+ binding to PS II can be obtained when direct interaction of EGTA is taken into account. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we report a noble metal free system using CdS nanorods as a photocatalyst and a cobalt lactate complex as a cocatalyst. Under visible light irradiation, a H-2 evolution rate of 15.59 mmol h(-1) g(-1) is obtained when the CdS and cobalt lactate complex are used for photocatalytic water splitting; this rate is 3 times that obtained with a Pt/CdS photocatalyst. Moreover, the stability of CdS is also obviously improved using a cobalt lactate complex as a cocatalyst. The origin of the improved photoactivity is investigated by a variety of controlled experiments. The results show that the cobalt lactate complex as a hole acceptor inhibits the recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes.									24	1	0	0	2	0	24			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000428087400012

CARBON BURNING AND GALACTIC ENRICHMENT								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				371	2			665	672		10.1086/169932				APR 20 1991	1991	In Paper I we calculated the s-processing that takes place in a typical massive star of 25 M. during He burning. Here we follow the subsequent shell carbon-burning phase. The reactivation of the Ne-22(alpha, n)Mg-25 neutron source makes a small s-process occur, with a neutron exposure of tau = 0.06 mbarn-1 and a neutron density starting from a high initial value of approximately 10(11) cm-3. The s-abundances are consequently greatly modified with respect to He exhaustion, and this may affect most of the CO core, especially if C burning takes place as a convective nuclear stage. In evaluating the s-processed material ejected by a 25 M. supernova, we must also consider that the outer region of the CO core has a variable chemical composition due to the shrinkage of the convective core at the end of He-burning. Furthermore, in the inner core the s-abundances are destroyed by photodissociations that occur from O-burning onward.We then calculate the yields of s-isotopes from a stellar generation of massive stars, relying upon the presupernova models by Nomoto and Hashimoto. The normalization is obtained by asking for the solar oxygen to be reproduced. Stars more massive than 50 M. are supposed to participate in the chemical enrichment of the Galaxy only through stellar wind, i.e., they are not allowed to explode as supernovae; their cores will presumably collapse into black holes. The massive stars' contributions to the solar s-abundances are then added to the contributions from low-mass stars on the asymptotic giant branch.We find that the s-process in massive stars can completely account for the weak component observed in the solar system, and can put important constraints on the scenario for the chemical evolution of the Galaxy.									124	1	0	0	0	0	124			0004-637X			WOS:A1991FF98300024

The convection is too heterogeneous and dynamic to be well approximated by one-dimensional diffusion-like algorithms that have previously been used for this epoch. Qualitatively new phenomena are seen.The simulations are two-dimensional, with good resolution in radius and angle, and used a large (90 degrees) slice centered at the equator. The microphysics and the initial model were carefully treated. Many of the qualitative features of previous multidimensional simulations of convection are seen, including large kinetic and acoustic energy fluxes, which are not accounted for by mixing length theory. Small but significant amounts of C-12 are mixed nonuniformly into the oxygen-burning convection zone, resulting in hot spots of nuclear energy production that are more than an order of magnitude more energetic than the oxygen flame itself, Density perturbations (up to 8%) occur at the "edges" of the convective zone and are the result of gravity waves generated by interaction of penetrating flows into the stable region. Perturbations of temperature and Y-e(or neutron excess eta) at the base of the convective zone are of sufficient magnitude to create angular inhomogeneities in explosive nucleosynthesis products and need to be included in quantitative estimates of yields. Combined with the plumelike velocity structure arising from convection, the perturbations will contribute to the mixing of Ni-56 throughout supernovae envelopes. Runs of different resolution and angular extent were performed to test the robustness of these simulations.									111	0	0	0	0	0	111			0004-637X			WOS:000072782900029

They act via nuclear estrogen receptors (ER alpha and ER beta) and/or G - protein coupled receptor - GPR30.We found expression of ER alpha, ER beta and GPR30 in carp lymphoid tissues and head kidney monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes. Interestingly, ER beta is also expressed in some head kidney lymphocytes but not in naive PBLs. Immune stimulation altered the cell type specific profile of expression of these receptors, which depends on both activation and maturation stage.This implies direct leukocyte responsiveness to estrogen stimulation and therefore in vitro effects of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in monocytesimacrophages were determined. Short-time incubation with E2 increased ROS production in PMA-stimulated cells. Results comply with mediation by GPR30, partially functioning via phosphoinositide 3-kinase activation.These results furthermore demonstrate that neuroendocrine-immune communication via estrogen receptors is evolutionary conserved.

In the present study, we compared oxidative stress potential, by measuring the superoxide anion production in three penaeid shrimps: two wild Atlantic species, the pink shrimp Farfantepenaeus paulensis and the white shrimp Litopenaeus schmitti and one cultivated Pacific species, the white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, through the nitro-blue-tetrazolium-reduction assay. We also proposed an optimized experimental protocol for this assay, that produces rapid and consistent results with low levels of basal superoxide anion (O-2-) production by unstimulated haemocytes and high levels of this oxygen radical after cell stimulation. Among the different cell elicitors used (zymosan, laminarin, lipopolysaccharide and phorbol myristate acetate), laminarin (beta-1,3-glucans - 2 mg mL-1) was the most potent cell activator for the haemocytes of all three penaeids and we recommend this immunostimulant to routinely evaluate shrimp respiratory burst. In general terms, the most elevated levels of O-2- production, after cell stimulation with microbial components, were detected in L. schmitti. Interestingly, the stimulation profile of the haemocytes of L. vannamei was more similar to F. paulensis, than to L. schmitti, which is more phylogenetically related.									19	0	0	0	14	3	19			1355-557X	1365-2109		WOS:000278643100015

Dispersion-strengthening, an effective means to further improve the high-temperature performance of metals, fails to implement in TiAl intermetallics due to difficulties in interface optimization. Here, we successively fabricate a TiAl naocomposite with fully lamellar microstructures and homogeneously dispersed Ti2AlC nanoprecipitates via spark plasma sintering. The composite consisted of semicoherent interfaces among gamma-TiAl/Ti2AlC precipitates/alpha(2)-Ti3Al, in addition to continuous polysynthetic nanotwins. Strong pinning effects as well as strain-induced nanoscale TiCr2 precipitation uplift the operation temperature of TiAl nanocomposites by more than 50 degrees C. Furthermore, we experimentally proved that semicoherent interfaces among in situ Ti2AlC precipitates and its surrounding matrix serve as oxygen diffusion barrier during isothermal oxidization and significantly drop down the mass gain of TiAl nanocomposites during operation, making the present nanocomposite a highly potential candidate for use as light-weight structural materials in automotive and aerospace industries.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000757877900001	35129324	
J	Yang Hongzhi; Zou Jianpeng; Shi Qian; Lin Songsheng; Dai Mingjiang; Wang Di				DAI, M/GPS-8291-2022				Recent Advances for Interface Diffusion Behavior in MCrAlY Coatings at Elevated Temperature Oxidation								RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING				49	7			2240	2249						JUL 2020	2020	MCrAlY coatings are playing an important role in protecting the Ni-based superalloy substrate from oxidation and corrosion at high temperature, which can form dense and continuous oxide scales on the surface to retard the diffusion of cations and oxygen. The oxide scale is mainly composed of by alpha-Al2O3 of high thermal and chemical stabilities as well as the low diffusivity of oxygen and metal ions in its hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure. The concentration of aluminum in the coating near coating/oxide scales interface decreases with the depletion of Al for the growth of alumina layer, which further suppresses the consecutive Al2O3 -scale growth, causing the formation of mixed oxide compounds and cracks as well as voids. Also, accompanied with the interface diffusion behavior, the microstructure of the oxide scales evolves due to the changes of the chemical composition, which makes a significant influence on the oxidation resistance property of the coating. At elevated temperature, the coating/Ni-based superalloy interface diffusion process will make deleterious effects because of its thermally activated nature and the difference in chemical composition. The inward diffusion of Al from the Al-rich coating and the outward diffusion of Ni from the Ni-rich superalloy, accompanied with the phase transformation from gamma-Ni phase to gamma'-Ni3Al phase, will result in an interdiffusion zone (IDZ). Furthermore, the phase transformation will result in a secondary reaction zone (SRZ), which mainly consists of refractory element-rich topologically close-packed (TCP) phases, such as sigma, mu and Laves phases. These TCP phases with dendritic nature of solidification in the matrix may reduce the high-temperature fatigue life of the Ni-based superalloy. The interface diffusion process of MCrAlY coatings is addressed in this paper, together with a summary of current understanding of the effects accompanied with the interface diffusion. This work can help to understand the microstructure change and element diffusion behavior of the MCrAlY coatings in the oxidation process, which has guiding significance for improving the oxidation resistance and understanding the failure mechanism of the coatings.									4	3	0	0	0	0	5			1002-185X			WOS:000559890100008

The reactor was successfully established by seeding conventional activated sludge at ambient temperature without additional biomass inoculation. An average total nitrogen (TN) removal rate of 1.1kg.(m(3) d)(-1) was achieved after 180 days' operation. The bacterial morphology, community structure and spatial distribution of nitrogen removal microorganisms were analyzed by using some molecular biotechniques. Denaturant gel gradient electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles showed a distinct community shift of nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) during the start-up period, which was not the same as that of aerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AerAOB) or anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AnAOB). Phylogenetic results indicated the predominance of Nitrosomonas, 'Candidatus Brocadia fulgida' and Nitrobacter for nitrogen removal in the system, all of which coexisted without a distinguishable niche on the biofilm.									9	2	1	0	8	0	12			0273-1223			WOS:000315194500023	23202570

The oxidation product is the tyrosyl radical formed by hydrogen abstraction from the phenolic group; interestingly, on freshly irradiated crystals, two tyrosyl radicals were identified, characterized by slightly different magnetic parameters. In particular, one of the two radicals, with a g(xx) value of 2.00621, has its phenoxyl oxygen strongly hydrogen-bonded to one or more donors; to our knowledge, this is the lower g(xx) value reported for tyrosyl radicals. These two oxidation radicals are found to evolve very slowly to a third, single more stable radical conformation. To interpret the experimental data, a possible molecular scenario is presented, where the process of radical formation can be seen as a hydrogen atom transfer or a proton-coupled electron transfer. These processes seem to be controlled by the specific network of hydrogen-bond interactions present in the crystal. The results are discussed in relation to their relevance for the interpretation of EPR spectra of tyrosyl radicals in biological systems.									12	0	0	0	4	0	12			1520-6106	1520-5207		WOS:000254209300029	18318523

Herein, a series of Ti-substituted perovskite SrCo1-xTixO3-delta (x = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20) are synthesized by solid-state reaction method for anion-intercalated supercapacitor electrode materials. The structural evolution, morphology and the electrochemical performance with the variation of Ti content are characterized in detail. The parent material SrCoO3-delta contains two phase: a hexagonal structure with space group R3:H (87.09 wt%) and a simple cubic structure with space group Pm((3) over bar)m (12.91 wt%). While a stable cubic structure with Pm((3) over bar)m space group is obtained after Ti substitution and the electrochemical performance is also significantly optimized. A highest specific capacitance (Cs) of 625.0 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) is achieved in SrCo0.9Ti0.1O3-delta sample. The superior electrochemical performance of SrCo0.9Ti0.1O3-delta is attributed to the stable cubic structure with higher conductivity and large amount of oxygen vacancy which directly contributes to the anion-intercalated energy storage. In addition, the asymmetric supercapacitor combined with activated carbon electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 114.4 F g(-1) (50.8 mAh g(-1)) and 98.3 F g(-1) (42.7 mAh g-1) at 5 mV s(-1) and 1 A g(-1), respectively. The device presents an energy density of 69.9 Wh kg(-1) at power density of 1600 W kg(-1) with a working voltage of 1.6 V.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2352-152X		WOS:000807731100003

E./F-3723-2019				Comparison of electrochemical active surface area methods for various nickel nanostructures								JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				870						114246	10.1016/j.jelechem.2020.114246				AUG 1 2020	2020	Electrochemical processes, such as energy conversion and storage, water electrolysis and other electrocatalytic processes call for expensive noble metal catalysts to provide efficient performance of their systems. The use of those expensive catalysts does not allow for feasible industrial scale operation of such processes. Researchers have therefore moved their focus to non-noble metals such as nickel (Ni), which are inexpensive yet still have high catalytic performance. When evaluating electrochemical performance, it is imperative to quantify the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of the materials, however for Ni-based materials, this has proven to be quite challenging. In this study, four ECSA methods are compared for four Ni-based nanestructured catalysts as well as polycrystalline Ni, to determine whether one method is more representative than the other, or whether the appropriate method depends on the type of Ni being used. The tested methods were carried out in an alkaline environment and were based on (i) the double layer capacitance obtained through non-faradaic charging by cyclic voltammetry as well as the charge associated to (ii) the alpha-Ni(OH)(2) oxidation peak, (iii) the beta-NiOOH reduction peak and finally (iv) the beta-NiOOH reduction peak in the presence of oxalic acid. The methods were applied to Ni wire, various shaped Ni nanoparticles (NPs) such as triangle, urchin and spherical, as well as Ni foams. Electrochemical results of this study, along with scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) and X ray diffraction (XRD) analyses are reported and a detailed discussion on the applicability of the methods is provided.									43	2	0	0	0	0	44			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000541934000017

In this study, metallic Sn nanoparticle, a new hydrogen-generation cocatalyst, was effectively integrated with the conventional TiO2 photocatalyst to greatly boost the hydrogen-production reaction via a direct photoinduced method. Herein, the direct photoinduced synthesis of Sn nanoparticle-deposited TiO2 photocatalysts and their enhanced H-2-generation activity can be easily and simultaneously realized in an ethylene glycol-ethanol system. The Sn nano particles were very small (ca. 2 nm) and uniformly deposited onto the TiO2 surface to synthesize highly efficient Sn/TiO2 photo catalysts via the, formation of Sn(II)-EG complex molecules and their following in situ photoreduction method. Photocatalytic results indicated that metallic Sn cocatalyst could dramatically promote the H-2-generation activity of TiO2 photocatalyst, and the resultant Sn/TiO2(3 wt %) presented the highest H-2-production rate with a value of 553.1 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), which is 43.9 times as that of pure TiO2 (12.6 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)). Thus, an electron-cocatalyst-mediated mechanism is raised to explain the promoted H-2 generation efficiency of TiO2 photocatalyst, namely, the metallic Sn cocatalyst can act as the electron receiver to quickly capture photoexcited electrons and serve as the interfacial hydrogen-generation site to enhance the hydrogen-generation rate. Considering the facile synthetic route, earth abundance, and high activity, the metallic Sn cocatalyst would have enormous prospect for the development of efficient photocatalysts applied in different fields.									64	10	0	0	4	0	65			2168-0485			WOS:000470331800040

In consequents, there is an urgent need to increase the storage of energy to guarantee the continuity of energy supply. Rechargeable zinc-air battery is a promising technology due to the high theoretical energy density and the abundant and environmentally benign materials that are used. In the state of the art, the information about secondary zinc anode for rechargeable zinc-air batteries is scarce. The main development of the technology has been lately concentrated on the bifunctional air electrodes while the used zinc anode is mainly based on a planar zinc electrode providing low specific energy densities for the full system. This overview compiles the available information in the literature regarding the development and manufacturing of zinc anodes for electrical rechargeable batteries applications, where secondary porous zinc electrodes are generally desired. In this context, the zinc-based anode electrode composition (namely, active material, binder, conductive material, current collector, and additives), pretreatments, and processing techniques are described and their impact on the zinc anode performance analyzed.									76	6	0	0	1	0	81			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000425185500003

This is despite the fact that trace elements are generally less vulnerable to diffusive resetting, and are sensitive to a broader spectrum of geochemical interactions involving the entire mineral assemblage, including the growth and/or dissolution of accessory minerals. We outline a technique for the routine acquisition of high-resolution 2D trace element maps by LA-ICP-MS, and introduce an extension of the software package XMapTools for rapid processing of LA-ICP-MS data to visualise and interpret compositional zoning patterns. These methods form the basis for investigating the mechanisms controlling geochemical mobility in garnet, which are argued to be largely dependent on the interplay between element fractionation, mineral reactions and partitioning, and the length scales of intergranular transport. Samples from the Peaked Hill shear zone, Reynolds Range, central Australia, exhibit contrasting trace element distributions that can be linked to a detailed sequence of growth and dissolution events. Trace element mapping is thus employed to place garnet evolution in a specific paragenetic context and derive absolute age information by integration with existing U-Pb monazite and Sm-Nd garnet geochronology. Ultimately, the remarkable preservation of original growth zoning and its subtle modification by subsequent re-equilibration is used to 'see through' multiple superimposed events, thereby revealing a previously obscure petrological and temporal record of metamorphism, metasomatism, and deformation.									52	1	0	0	1	0	53			0010-7999	1432-0967		WOS:000397978000003

In contrast with traditional Ti/SnO2-Sb electrode prepared by electrodeposition, Ti/ATONPs electrode possessed smaller grains and crystallite size, remarkable porous structure with 39.9 m(2) g(-1) surface area and 3.0 nm average pore size as seen by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET). Electrochemical measurements including linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and chronocoulometry (CC) were employed to investigate the electrochemical activity, compared with Ti/SnO2-Sb, Ti/ATONPs owned a higher oxygen evolution potential (2.18 V versus 2.08 V), a lower charge transfer resistance (0.47 Omega versus 13.24 Omega), a larger electrochemically effective surface area (38.97 cm(2) cm(-2) versus 3.03 cm(2) cm(-2)) and the voltammetric charge analysis indicated that Ti/ATONPs could create more reaction active sites to enhance the electrocatalytic efficiency. To further explore the electrocatalytic oxidation performance, AR 73 was used as target pollutant to monitor the concentration changes with time through UV/vis spectroscopy, the removal of AR 73 degradation and corresponding kinetic constant of Ti/ATONPs electrode was 83.9%, 0.62 h(-1) while that of Ti/SnO2-Sb was 65.8%, 0.40 h(-1) respectively. These results show that Ti/ATONPs electrode prepared by screen printing method may become a promising electrode in treating wastewater. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS				26	3			161	172		10.1002/1520-6769(200005/06)26:3<161::AID-NRC4>3.0.CO;2-N				MAY-JUN 2000	2000	Experimental stroke can be induced by permanent or temporal reduction of oxygen supply in focal brain regions of a variety of animal species in order to produce a reliable functional deficit with or without the formation of reproducible infarcts. The resulting lesion depends on the size of the occluded vessels and the territory that they supply. This can include a complete hemisphere, a major perfusion territory, specific functional regions or unpredictable lacunar fields. The outcome depends on the residual flow to the affected area and the timely restoration of blood supply. Areas of low flow, either in the occluded region or in the apposing penumbra, deserve attention for therapeutic rescue. This is also true for areas remote from the compromised structure. Since the progression of injury and the response of the different brain constituents are multifactorial and behave in a rather unpredictable and variable way, treatment is a complex matter. The evolution of acute or delayed neuronal injury and secondary phenomena such as edema formation, inflammatory reaction and retrograde degeneration may require well-timed approaches based on various mechanisms of action. In this paper current experimental models are reviewed and pharmacotherapeutic measures will be discussed in relation to the pathogenesis of stroke.									6	0	0	0	5	0	6			0893-6609			WOS:000087803200004		
J	Tian, Zhen; Zhao, Zhenxin; Chen, Yanjun; Li, Dan; Wang, Yanzhong; Wang, Xiaomin; Guo, Li								Modified morphology and restrained overpotential of manganese dioxide by iron doping for boosting aqueous zinc storage								JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS				925						166682	10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.166682				DEC 5 2022	2022	Aqueous zinc-ion hybrid capacitors (ZIHCs) based on a multivalent ion-storage mechanism are attracting increasing attention owing to their inherent safety and low-cost. However, their unsatisfactory energy density and durability have so far limited their practical application. Herein, iron-doped alpha-manganese dioxide was grown on carbon cloth (FMO/CC) via a facile method to obtaied an aqueous ZIHC cathode. The important role of the iron dopant in modulating the microstructure and assistingg ion diffusion as well as suppressing the overpotential for the hydrogen evolution reaction at the FMO/CC cathode was demonstrated by experimental results and theoretical calculations. Moreover, characterization by ex situ XPS revealed that the Mn4+/Mn3+ and Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couples were involved in the Zn2+ storage mechanism. As a result, the FMO/CC cathode displayed electrochemical performance with a capacity of 288 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1), an increased operating voltage range of 1.4 V, and cycling stability with only 15 % capacity loss over 10,000 cycles at 10 A g(-1). Moreover, the obtained ZIHC based on an FMO/CC cathode and an activated carbon anode exhibited an energy density of 47 Wh kg(-1) and a power density of 995 W kg(-1), as well as 72 % capacity retention after 5000 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performances of the FMO/CC cathode demonstrate great potential applications in Zn2+ energy storage devices. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

However, the conductivity of LDH is not particularly ideal. The reasonable design of new electrode materials with core-shell structure is an effective strategy to improve the electrochemical performance. Herein, we prepared NiCo2S4@NiV-LDH/NF composite material with a core-shell nanostructure through a simple hydrothermal method. In addition, NiCo2S4@NiV-LDH/NF-1, NiCo2S4@NiV-LDH/NF-2, NiCo2S4@NiV-LDH/NF-3 were synthesized by adjusting the sulfur concentration. Benefited from the synergistic reaction of each component, the optimized NiCo2S4@NiV-LDH/NF-2 com-posite material has excellent electrochemical performance. The specific capacity is 1778.8 C g(-1) (3557.6 F g(-1)) at 1 A g(-1). In addition, a typical hybrid supercapacitor device was assembled with NiCo2S4@ NiV-LDH/NF-2 composite material as the positive electrode and biochar (BC) as the negative electrode. Notably, under the condition of a power density of 749.98 W kg(-1), the energy density of the NiCo2S4@NiV-LDH/NF-2//BC device is 120.81 Wh kg(-1). In addition, NiCo2S4@NiV-LDH/GCE also showed excellent performance in the detection of tryptophan due to its superior catalytic performance. The low detection limit of NiCo2S4@NiV-LDH/GCE sensor is 0.46 mu M, the wide linear range is 0.5-153 mu M, and the highest sensitivity. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The deployment of this technology industrially and at scale requires photoelectrodes that are highly active, cost-effective, and stable. To create these new photoelectrodes, transition metal-based electrocatalysts have been proposed as potential cocatalysts for improving the performance of water splitting catalysts. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are a class of clays with brucite like layers and intercalated anions. Transition metal-based LDHs are increasingly popular in the field of photo(electro)chemical water splitting due to their unique physicochemical properties. This article aims to review recent advances in transition metal-based LDHs for photo(electro)chemical water splitting. This article provides a brief overview of the research in a format approachable for the general scientific audience. Specifically, this review examines the following areas: (i) routes for synthesis of transition metal-based LDHs, (ii) recent developments in transition metal-based LDHs for photo(electro)chemical water splitting, and (iii) an overview of the structure-property relationships therein.									44	1	0	0	4	0	44			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000680880700001	34477633

Herein, taking advantage of bimetallic MOFs and transition bimetal hydroxide, we have successfully used nanoflower-like Ni1-xCox(OH)(2) as both the precursor and template to in situ construct three dimensional (3D) NiCo-MOF@Ni1-xCox(OH)(2) (denoted as MOF@TMH) hierarchical heterostructures. Benefiting from the optimized composition with hierarchical heterostructures assembled by ultrathin nanosheets, MOF@TMH-2 possesses rich effective active sites and high electrochemical reactivity, delivering superior pseudocapacitor performance with a specific capacitance of 1855.3 F g(-1) at 2 A g(-1) and good rate performance. Besides, MOF@TMH-2 also exhibits excellent OER activity with small overpotentials of 193 mV and 310 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000624242900038	33576358

Herein, we report control synthesis of Ni/Ni3C nanoparticles (NPs) induced engineering of the nitrogen-enriched carbon-nanotubes (NCNT) of three different sizes/morphologies by the pyrolysis of melamine with Ni(NO3)center dot 6H(2)O at various stoichiometric ratios (0.5-wt%, 2-wt% and 4-wt% of Ni). The catalytic potential and structural integrity of the in situ self-assembled hybrid material was explored and found very effective to catalyse both OER and HER in a broad pH range (0-14). Promisingly, the nanostructuring of the Ni/Ni3C NPs and subsequently the diameter of the NCNT hold the catalytic potential, where 0.5-Ni/Ni3C@NCNT (average size approximate to 15-20 nm) showed remarkable activity for OER (eta(10-base/acid/neutral) = 280/400/600 mV, Tafel slope(base) = 42 mV/dec) and HER (eta(10-acid/base/neutral) = 210/290/370 mV, Tafel slope(acid) = 40 mV/dec) It is anticipated, that favourable electronic modulation of Ni/Ni3C, structural strain of NCNT, and possible concerted synergistic effect of the hybrid/doped nanocarbons with metal-carbide hold a great potential in this regard, and such modular strategies tailoring the structural-performance relationship may provide the guidance towards the designing of commercially viable electrocatalysts in this regard.

In the regime of surface catalyst, the catalytic activities and functionalities of Cu should be highly dependent on its surface type. Traditional methods to determine the surface index are mainly high-vacuum based surface science techniques and are typically of low throughput and in small scale. A method to fast detect the surface index of Cu in large scale is still lacking. Here, the authors report an effective optical contrast method to identify the Cu surface index in large area. This method is based on the Cu2O-thickness dependent color of Cu surface after a mild oxidation in hot air. It is revealed that different Cu surfaces (Cu(111), Cu(100), and Cu(110) as examples) have various oxidation barriers and would exhibit distinct color evolution with heating time. It is also showed that graphene grown on Cu surfaces with varied orientations has totally different growth behaviors. The results would greatly facilitate the high-throughput determination of Cu surface index and accelerate the large-scale facet-dependent catalytic research of Cu, such as in single-crystal graphene growth.									13	2	0	0	1	0	13			2196-7350			WOS:000445175500007

In this work, the N,P,S-codoped hierarchically porous carbon spheres (N,P,S-HCS) have been rationally designed and originally fabricated using the silica colloids as hard templates, polyaniline as carbon and nitrogen sources, phytic acid as phosphorus sources, and ammonium persulfate as sulfur sources. Both high volumetric and gravimetric capacitance can be achieved. The as-prepared N,P,S-HCS shows the highest specific capacitance of 274 F g(-1) and 219 F cm(-3) at a current density of 0.5 A g(-1), which reveals a superior performance. Moreover, the cycling ability of the N,P,S-HCS can be maintained over 95% to the initial capacitance at a high current density of 10 A g(-1) for 10 000 charge-discharge cycles. This is mainly contributed to the uniform doping of N, P, and S as well as the hierarchically porous structure of the N,P,S-HCS. Finally, we assemble it into the all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitors with high energy and power densities of 3.4 W h L-1 with 804 W L-1, respectively. The N,P,S-codoped hierarchically porous carbon spheres with high density show both good volumetric and gravimetric capacitance, which make it a promising material for supercapacitors in practical applications. The present investigations may develop a new direction for the design of carbon materials for a good balance of both high gravimetric and volumetric capacitance.									96	5	0	0	5	0	97			2168-0485			WOS:000429285800091		
J	Drogowska, M; Menard, H; Brossard, L								Electrooxidation of stainless steel AISI 304 in carbonate aqueous solution at pH8								JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY				26	2			217	225		10.1007/BF00364073				FEB 1996	1996	The electrochemical behaviour of stainless steel AISI 304 (SS304) has been investigated in deaerated 0.1-1M NaHCO3 solutions at pH 8 using a rotating disc electrode. The polarization curves are characterized by a broad range of passivity at low potentials (-0.8 to 0.3 V), a depassivation region at 0.4 V vs SCE and, at high potentials (0.5 to 0.85 V), a passive region before oxygen evolution. In the low potential range, the SS304 electrode behaves like a Cr-rich metallic phase, and the dissolution of Fe2+ ions into the solution is hindered by the formation of a Cr2O3 layer. As the potential reaches 0.4 V, the oxidation-dissolution of Cr(III) oxide/hydroxide to CrO42- ions occurs, with the participation of bicarbonate/carbonate as a catalyst in the dissolution reaction. Since the chromium oxide/hydroxide dissolution and subsequent surface enrichment ofiron oxides occur, the applied potential, exposure time and oxidation charge have a considerable effect on the passive him properties. At high potentials, the presence of a passive him of iron oxides/hydroxides or oxyhydroxides plays a key role in the SS304 passivity with the presence of Fe(VI) species incorporated or adsorbed into the passive films. Colouration of the SS304 surface is observed in the second passive region. A him of a uniform gold colour formed on SS304, mild steel 1024 and iron in carbonate and.borate solutions at pH 8. The colour of the electrode surfaces remain unchanged in air and in solutions at positive potential but it disappears at open-circuit potential or is easily reduced in the first negative-going potential scan.									26	1	0	0	4	1	26			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:A1996TY03700013

The phase structure, functional group information, and charge state characterization confirm that the CuAl2O4 oxides contain no impurities, while CuCr2O4 and CuFe2O4 contain CuO impurities. The CuAl2O4 oxides exhibit a small particle size of 25 nm, high optical band gap (Eg) value, high adsorption capacity for the adsorption of Congo red dye, and high photocatalytic activity for the photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH), which are much better than those of the CuCr2O4 and CuFe2O4 oxides. The high adsorption capacity for the CuAl2O4 oxides can be ascribed to the larger zero charge point (pHPZC) values, unique crystal structure, pore filling, electrostatic interaction, and hydrogen bond force. Photocatalytic degradation of antibiotics by CuB2O4 (B = Al, Cr, and Fe) shows high selectivity and B ion and crystal structure dependencies. The CuAl2O4 oxides exhibit high photocatalytic activity for the photocatalytic degradation of TCH and oxycline hydrochloride (OCH) and poor photocatalytic activity for the photocatalytic degradation of metformin hydrochloride (MFH) and naproxen sodium (NPS). Cyclic stability tests and XRD results further confirm that CuAl2O4 oxide is recyclable and stable. The high photocatalytic activity of CuAl2O4 oxides was explained in terms of the synergetic effects of the optical absorption coefficient, specific surface area, crystal structure, adsorbed oxygen concentration, chemical structure of the antibiotic, and conduction band and valence band potentials. The trapping experiments confirmed that TCH photodegradation in this reaction system occurs via photogenerated holes (hVB+) and superoxide radicals (center dot O-2(-)).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2574-0970		WOS:000835481900001

In this work, we applied a matrix isolation technique to study the radiation-driven evolution of this system at molecular level in order to get new mechanistic insight. The 1:1 C2H2 center dot center dot center dot H2O complexes were prepared in various solid noble-gasmatrices (Ar, Kr, Xe) and these icy matrices were subjected to X-ray irradiation at 5 K. Decomposition of initial complex and formation of products were monitored by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. It was found that complexation with H2O resulted in significant enhancement of the radiolytic decay of C2H2 molecules and provided new channels for its radiation-induced transformations. Ketene (both isolated H2CCO and in the form of H2CCO-H-2 pair), ketenyl radical (HCCO), carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH4) were observed as main products of the C2H2 center dot center dot center dot H2O radiolysis. In addition, vinyl alcohol (CH2CHOH) was detected in an Ar matrix. The mechanistic interpretation (reaction routes leading to formation of these products) is discussed on the basis of consideration of kinetic dependences and matrix effects. Conversion of C2H2 center dot center dot center dot H2O to CH4 is a prominent example of water-mediated cleavage of the C C triple bond, which may occur under prolonged irradiation in rigid media. Possible astrochemical implications of the obtained results are highlighted.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000512310600040

The dual-template method uses multi-walled carbon nanotube (CNT) as a hard template to control the morphology and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a soft template to form the mesoporous structure. The resulting m-TiO2-NTs are characterized by Xray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), nitrogen adsorption-desorption and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Rhodamine B (RhB) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) are used as model pollutants to evaluate the photocatalytic properties of the new materials. The m-TiO2-NTs possess a multiple channel tubular structure and have higher specific surface area than TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2-NPs). These features result in significantly superior photo catalytic activity for photodegradation. Specifically, the reaction rate constant for the photodegradation of RhB is 9.8 times greater with m-TiO2-NTs than it is with TiO2-NPs. In the case of DBP, the rate constant is 7.7 times higher. Photocatalytic removal ratios of gaseous acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) and the generation of COx (CO + CO2) were detected to evaluate the decomposition ability of the materials, m-TiO2-NTs showed the best CH3CHO removal efficiency and the highest CO2 selectivity. The active species of photocatalytic process are found to be (OH)-O-center dot. In addition, the m-TiO2-NTs exhibit excellent thermal and photocatalytic stability even after six recycles. This work demonstrates a novel way to fabricate mesoporous TiO2 nanotubes that have multiple channel tubular structure and to apply them in environmental photocatalysis.									76	9	0	0	13	0	79			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000465051700030

Although the structures and functions of these photosynthetic complexes have been explored, the molecular mechanisms underlying their assembly remain elusive. In this review, we summarize current knowledge of the regulatory components involved in the assembly of thylakoid membrane protein complexes in photosynthetic organisms. Many of the known regulatory factors are conserved between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, whereas others appear to be newly evolved or to have expanded predominantly in eukaryotes. Their specific features and fundamental differences in cyanobacteria, green algae and land plants are discussed.									33	3	0	0	29	0	36			0962-8436	1471-2970		WOS:000311288800007	23148269

The size of marine reservoir of redox-sensitive elements (particularly molybdenum and chromium) is principally controlled by the extent of anoxicity in marine conditions following the onset of oxidative weathering post Great Oxygenation Event (similar to 2.5-2.3 Ga). Hence, it is considered that coupled analysis involving redox-sensitive element/s and primary organic productivity (total organic carbon) may provide a clue for redox behaviour of ancient deep ocean. Here, we use the redox behaviour of Mo and total organic carbon values of Vindhyan shales to show that the Vindhyan hydrosphere although initiated as a stratified sea with anoxic and sulphidic deep water as exemplified by the geochemical character of the Arangi Shale, the extent and veracity of anoxicity and euxinicity was never pervasive. It further suggests that the Vindhyan hydrosphere developed euxinic deep water only during deposition of Arangi, Rampur and Bijaygarh black shale and was anoxic but certainly not euxinic during Koldaha and Rewa sedimentation. The low concentration of Mo and Cr, in general, in argillaceous intervals suggests that the Vindhyan Sea behaved as a moderate Mo and depleted Cr reservoir. The consistent low concentration of Cr within the Vindhyan shales also suggests restriction in the availability of Cr in the water column in the absence of any significant detrital supply of Cr at very low atmospheric oxygen level (<0.1% PAL; present atmospheric level).									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0011-3891			WOS:000446651900030

High-valent Nd3+ ions enter the perovskite A-site to occupy Bi vacancies resulting from the volatilization of Bi, inhibiting the formation of oxygen vacancies and contributing to an enhanced breakdown electric field (Eb). Low-valent Ga3+ ions enter the B-site to substitute for Ti4+ ions, resulting in the formation of random electric fields (REFs) at the B-site due to co-occupying hetero-valence ions of Ga3+/Ti4+, which significantly reduces ferroelectric hysteresis. Therefore, a synergic effect of A-and B-sites co-doping was realized in NBST-xNG ceramics. Benefitting from this synergic effect, an enhanced recoverable energy storage density (Wrec) of 2.88 J/cm3 and an efficiency (eta) of 83% are simultaneously obtained in NBST-0.04NG ceramics under a moderate electric field (E) of 200 kV/cm. Compared with most NBT-based ceramics, the values of (eta vs Wrec/E2) for NBST-0.04NG ceramics show an obvious advantage, indicating excellent potential for application as an energy storage material. Moreover, Wrec and eta of NBST-0.04NG ceramics exhibit excellent temperature sta-bility from 30 degrees C to 200 degrees C due to the enhanced correlation strength of polar nanoregions (PNRs) and local structural stability. This work provides a potential strategy to improve the energy storage performance of NBT-based ceramics via the synergic effect of A-and B-site co-doping.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000863336100002

Herein, for the first time, cobalt hydroxy selenide (Co(OH)Se) containing OH- and Se2- ions is prepared via a simple and facile liquid-phase selenization process using NaHSe solution, and its structural and chemical properties are studied by scanning transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. The electrochemical mechanisms of Co(OH)Se with potassium ions are investigated systematically through various ex situ and in situ techniques. The conversion reaction between Co(OH)Se and potassium ions can be proposed as the following equation; Co(OH)Se + 3 K+ + 3 e(-) -> Co + KOH + K2Se <-> 1/2 Co(OH)(2) + 1/2 CoSe2 + 3 K+ + 3 e(-). As an anode material for potassium-ion batteries, Co(OH)Se exhibited excellent cycling stability (414.7 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1) after 60 cycles) and rate capability (194.7 mA h g(-1) at 5.0 A g(-1)). Moreover, carbon-material composited Co(OH)Se@C delivered specific discharge capacity of 353.9 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1) after 150 cycles. This study is a novel approach to the anion regulation strategy, which can be utilized for the synthesis of energy storage materials, electrocatalysts, etc.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000832668100001

Here, we designed a combined process of hydrothermal and swelling pretreatment. Combined with the C-13 NMR, thermogravimetric and FT-IR analysis, the effect of combined process on pyrolysis products evolution were investigated. The results showed that the combined process was an effective means to improve quality of lignite and increase the yield of pyrolysis tar. The content of moisture decreased from 27.73% of raw coal to 3.7% when hydrothermal treated temperature was at 310 degrees C. The oxygen-containing functional groups were effectively removed during the hydrothermal process. Compared with the raw coal and coal sample directly swollen from raw coal, the yield of pyrolysis tar for the coal samples of the combined process at 250 degrees C reached 10.89%, increased by 47.56% and 34.28%, and the pyrolysis water yield for the coal samples of the combined process at 310 degrees C decreased to 6.20%, falling by 21.12% and 14.11%. The kinetic analysis of raw coal, hydrothermal treated coal and the swelling treated coal was calculated, and found that the activity energy increased after hydrothermal treatment, and decreased the pyrolysis reactivity. However, the activity energy significantly decreased after swelling process, and improve the pyrolysis reactivity.									13	1	0	0	0	0	14			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000559059700006

However, the crystal-phase engineering of metal nanomaterials still remains a big challenge. Recent research has revealed that the crystal phase of metal nanomaterials can significantly alter their properties, arising from the distinct atomic arrangement and modified electronic structure. Until now, it has been relatively uncommon to synthesize metal nanomaterials with novel crystal phases in spite of the fact that these nanostructures would be promising for various applications. Here, the research progress regarding the fine control of noble metal (Au, Ag, Ru, Rh, Pd) and non-noble metal (Fe, Co, Ni) nanomaterials with novel crystal phases is reviewed. First, synthesis strategies and their phase transformations are summarized, while highlighting the peculiar characteristics of each element. The phase-dependent properties are then discussed by providing representative examples. Finally, the challenges and perspectives in this emerging field are proposed.									106	8	0	0	6	0	107			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000435929000002	29658155

The MoO2-Co2Mo3O8@C nanorods present favorable electrocatalytic advantages toward OER in alkaline solution, requiring an overpotential of only 320 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). In addition, the catalyst also shows a small Tafel slope of 88 mV dec(-1) and relatively good durability. The attractive OER performance can be attributed to the highly active Co2Mo3O8 and MoO2 species and the unique structure of the catalyst. This strategy can be extended to design and synthesize other novel and highly efficient molybdenum based ternary metal oxides as OER catalysts.									51	2	0	0	3	0	51			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000428085300008	29479583

In this communication, we demonstrate that nickel borate nano-array supported on carbon cloth (Ni-Bi/CC) behaves as an efficient catalyst electrode for H2O2 electro-reduction in neutral media. As a non-enzymatic electrochemical H2O2 sensor, such Ni-Bi/CC shows superior sensing performances with a fast response time (less than 3 s), a low detection limit (0.85 nm, S/N = 3), and a high sensitivity (18320 mu A mM cm(-2)). Importantly, it also demonstrates favourable reproducibility and long-term stability.									49	0	0	0	10	0	49			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000417968100009	28967985

The resulting film is robust and exhibits high catalytic activity for electrochemical water oxidation. Water oxidation is initiated with an overpotential of 375 mV (1 mA/cm(2)) and a steady current density of 8.5 mA/cm(2) is maintained for at least 10 h at 1.3 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode. Kinetic analysis reveals that there is a 2e(-)/3H(+) pre-equilibrium process before the chemical rate-determining step. The low-cost preparation, robustness, and longevity make this catalyst competitive for applications in solar energy conversion and storage.

We addressed this issue by correlating photoelectrochemical performance with physical properties. We devised a novel anodic electrodeposition procedure with iodide added to the aqueous plating bath, which allowed us to prepare BiVO4 photoanodes with virtually identical thicknesses but different morphologies, and we could control surface Bi content. Morphologies were quantified from SEM images as distributions of crystallite areas and aspect-ratio-normalised diameters, and their statistical moments were derived. We could obtain clear photocurrent generation trends only from bivariate data analysis. Our experimental evidence suggests that a combination of low Bi/V ratio, small aspect-ratio-normalised diameters, and crystallites sizes that were small enough to provide efficient charge separation yet sufficiently large to prevent mass transport limitations led to highest photoelectrochemical performance.									33	0	0	0	1	0	33			2051-6347	2051-6355		WOS:000353586300008

However, this material still suffers from structural degradation during cycling and especially the severe interfacial reactions at elevated temper-atures that exacerbate irreversible capacity loss. Here, a simple strategy was used to construct a dual -function Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5P3O12 (LAGP) protective layer on the surface of the high-nickel single-crystal (SC) cathode material, leading to SC@LAGP material. The strong Al-O bonding effectively inhibits the release of lattice oxygen (O) at elevated temperatures, which is supported by the positive formation energy of O vacancy from first-principal calculations. Besides, theoretical calculations demonstrate that the appropri-ate amount of Al doping accelerates the electron and Li+ transport, and thus reduces the kinetic barriers. In addition, the LAGP protective layer alleviates the stress accumulation during cycling and effectively reduces the erosion of materials from the electrolyte decomposition at elevated temperatures. The obtained SC@LAGP cathode material demonstrates much enhanced cycling stability even at high voltage (4.6 V) and elevated temperature (55 degrees C), with a high capacity retention of 91.3% after 100 cycles. This work reports a simple dual-function coating strategy that simultaneously stabilizes the structure and interface of the single-crystal cathode material, which can be applied to design other cathode materials.

The performance and sensitivity of the electrode were evaluated by varying five input parameters (specific surface area, electrode thickness, electrode conductivity, pore velocity, and applied potential). Sensitivity analysis was carried out via Latin hypercube sampling, Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficients, and Sobol's analysis for five performance metrics (outlet concentration, energy per log removal of the contaminant, pumping energy, removal rate, and fractional utilization of the electrode). High sensitivity to input parameters related to the electrode thickness and surface area was observed. Higher fluxes improve mass transfer in the electrode, but lower fluxes lead to better conversion and lower energy consumption due to longer residence times. Analysis of reactors in a series model suggests that increasing the length or the specific surface area of porous electrodes and operating under conditions that minimize the number of reactors may be the most energy-efficient and cost-effective approach. This modeling approach can be used to understand how operating parameters, material properties, and energy consumption of porous electrodes can inform design decisions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2690-0645		WOS:000786332800015

Depending on the employed regimes of MP, 4 types of charge were obtained, the bulk density of which varied from 0.33 to 1.1 g/cm(3). For all types of charge, the synthesis of the alpha-Al2O3 phase was observed as a result of the exothermic reaction of the interaction of air oxygen with the surface of aluminum particles during the MP. It is also possible to form boehmite and gibbsite when the activated surface of Al particles interacts with atmospheric water vapor. By energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX), x-ray amorphous carbon was detected in the composition of the charge, the appearance of which is associated with the impact- shearing effect of grinding bodies leading to the nucleation of x-ray amorphous carbon inclusions due to the thermal destruction of stearin. The maximum bending strength of the sintered cermet was 550 MPa. This cermet is characterized by a discrete fracture: the formation of dimples as a result of the shear of layered packets under the action of tangential stresses. The revealed mechanisms of fracture of cermet provide information to determine the optimal regimes of MP of powder compositions for obtaining various constructional elements from them.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1083-4877	1573-9139		WOS:000723492900001

NiO films were fabricated on Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) supports by cycling the potential between two different sets of limits. The electrodeposition technique which involved using the shorter potential limits was denoted as deposition process 1 and the technique using the wider potential limits was called deposition process 2. Subsequently, the films fabricated by the two deposition process were evaluated as electrochromic materials. The results show that the Colouration Efficiency (CE) values achieved for the deposition process 1 and 2 were 49 cm(2) C-1 and 10 cm(2) C-1, respectively. The switching times of the film made by the first deposition process were also calculated, as this film showed improved electrochromic capabilities. The coloration and bleaching switching times for this NiO film are 5.7 and 7.4 seconds, respectively. The improved electrochromic results for the film fabricated by deposition process 1 may be due to the smaller potential deposition window as it produced a thinner film with no traces of sulphate ions on the film's surface compared to the other NiO film produced by the second electrodeposition technique. The films are characterized by SEM-EDX, Raman spectroscopy and XPS. The regeneration of the bleach state was shown to be hindered. This may be due to conductive pathways involved in the reduction of the coloured state being blocked. Raman spectroscopy was used to determine the presence of both the Ni(OH)(2) and NiOOH after the reduction event.									43	0	0	0	2	0	44			1452-3981			WOS:000384906500019

Such cycles utilize solar-thermal energy to reduce the metal oxide, which is then re-oxidized by H2O or CO2, producing H-2 or CO, respectively. Mixing ferrites with zirconia or yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) greatly improves their cyclabilities. In order to understand this system, we have studied the behavior of iron oxide/8YSZ (8 mol-% Y2O3 in ZrO2) using in situ X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analyses at temperatures up to 1500 degrees C and under controlled atmosphere. The solubility of iron oxide in 8YSZ measured by XRD at room temperature was 9.4 mol-% Fe. The solubility increased to at least 10.4 mol-% Fe when heated between 800 and 1000 degrees C under inert atmosphere. Furthermore iron was found to migrate in and out of the 8YSZ phase as the temperature and oxidation state of the iron changed. In samples containing >9.4 mol-% Fe, stepwise heating to 1400 degrees C under helium caused reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 to FeO. Exposure of the FeO-containing material to CO2 at 1100 degrees C re-oxidized FeO to Fe3O4 with evolution of CO. Thermogravimetric analysis during thermo-chemical cycling of materials with a range of iron contents showed that samples with mostly dissolved iron utilized a greater proportion of the iron atoms present than did samples possessing a greater fraction of un-dissolved iron oxides.

J	SHOUN, H; TANIMOTO, T								DENITRIFICATION BY THE FUNGUS FUSARIUM-OXYSPORUM AND INVOLVEMENT OF CYTOCHROME-P-450 IN THE RESPIRATORY NITRITE REDUCTION								JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY				266	17			11078	11082						JUN 15 1991	1991	From conditions for production in Fusarium oxysporum of the unique nitrate/nitrite-inducible cytochrome P-450, tentatively called P-450dNIR, it was expected that the fungus is capable of metabolizing nitrate dissimilatively. Here we report that F. oxysporum exhibits a distinct denitrifying ability which results in the anaerobic evolution of nitrous oxide (N2O) from nitrate or nitrite. Comparison of the cell growth during denitrification indicated that the dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to nitrite is an energetically favorable process in F. oxysporum; however, further reduction of nitrite to N2O might be energy-exhausting and may function as a detoxification mechanism. A potent nitrite reductase activity to form N2O could be reconstituted by combination of the cell-free extract prepared from the denitrifying cells and an NADH-phenadinemethosulfate-dependent reducing system. The activity was strongly inhibited by carbon monoxide, cyanide, oxygen (O2), and the antibody against P-450dNIR. The results, along with those concerning inducing conditions of P-450dNIR, were highly indicative that the cytochrome is involved in the denitrifying nitrite reduction. This work has thus presented not only the first demonstration that a eukaryote exhibits a marked denitrifying ability, but also the first instance of a cytochrome P-450 that is involved in a reducing reaction with a distinct physiological significance against a hydrophilic, inorganic substrate.									216	8	1	0	173	0	228			0021-9258			WOS:A1991FQ77400059	2040619

The fundamental physicochemical properties of 3R-delafossite CuGaO2 were systematically studied by density functional theory calculations and experimental characterization. Through a series of characterization, analysis, (photo)electrochemical and photocatalytic activity testing, the as-prepared CuGaO2 samples exhibit the potential for hydrogen production and high photocatalytic degradation for tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH). Furthermore, CuGaO2 photoelectrode exhibits long-term stability and large photocurrent density. These observations suggest that 3R-delafossite CuGaO2 is a potential promising photocatalyst driven by visible-light. Finally, possible breakthrough directions of 3R-delafossite CuGaO2 photocatalyst are discussed.									12	2	0	0	0	0	13			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000520073600001

We consider simultaneous measurements of OH, HO2, and O-3 at the altitudes of the mesosphere as a specific example and their daytime photochemical equilibrium as an evaluating relationship. A simplified algebraic equation relating local concentrations of these components in the 50-100 km altitude range has been derived. The parameters of the equation are temperature, neutral density, local zenith angle, and the rates of eight reactions. We have performed a one-year simulation of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere using a 3-D chemical-transport model. The simulation shows that the discrepancy between the calculated evolution of the components and the equilibrium value given by the equation does not exceed 3-4 % in the full range of altitudes independent of season or latitude. We have developed a statistical Bayesian evaluation technique for simultaneous measurements of OH, HO2, and O-3 based on the equilibrium equation taking into account the measurement error. The first results of the application of the technique to MLS/Aura data (Microwave Limb Sounder) are presented in this Technical Note. It has been found that the satellite data of the HO2 distribution regularly demonstrate lower altitudes of this component's mesospheric maximum. This has also been confirmed by model HO2 distributions and comparison with offline retrieval of HO2 from the daily zonal means MLS radiance.									8	0	2	0	0	0	10			1680-7316	1680-7324		WOS:000433486500002

In this work, a three-dimensional (3D) electrocatalytic system with synthesized AuPd/Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) as particle electrodes (PEs) was established for the degradation of typical 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium ([BMIM]) based ILs. The assynthesized AuPd/Fe3O4 possessed preferable electrochemical properties for in situ supplement of H2O2 and renewable Fe species. This 3D electrocatalytic system exhibited excellent performance with 100% removal rate of BMIM in 90 min under 120 mA, pH 3, and 1 g/L dosage of AuPd/Fe3O4 NPs. Kinetics study revealed that the degradation rule of BMIM well followed the anodic Fenton treatment (AFT) model, in which the variation of the degradation rate was positively correlated with that of dissolved Fe2+, while significantly differed from the evolution of H2O2. Particularly, the appearance of the H2O2 inflection point suggested the optimal effectiveness of AuPd/Fe3O4-based 3D electrocatalysis. During this electrocatalytic process, the active HO center dot was produced over the AuPd/Fe3O4 PEs, thereby initiated the highly efficient degradation of BMIM into 1-butyl-3-methyl-2,4,5-trioxoimidazolidine, 1-butyl-3-methylurea and N-butyl-formamide as main intermediates. The electrocatalytic stability of the AuPd/Fe3O4 PEs over seven times further indicated the potential applicability for organic wastewater treatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The primary objective of the research was to control the electro-stationary speciation of hydrous metal oxides between hydroxyl radical (>MOx(OH)) and higher valence-state oxides (>MOx+1). An underlying layer of the mixed-metal oxide, Ir0.7Ta0.3Oy, was synthesized to serve as a primary ohmic contact and electron shuttle. Binary thin films of BixTi1-xOz were prepared from the thermal decomposition of an aqueous solution mixture of Ti/Bi complexes. With these core components, the measured current efficiency for RCS generation (eta(RCS)) was enhanced where the values observed for x = 0.1 or 0.3 were twice of the eta(RCS) of the Ir0.7Ta0.3Oy anode. At the same time, the rates of RCS generation were enhanced by factors of 20 - 30%. Partial substitution of Ti with Bi results in a positive shift in surface charge allowing for stronger interaction with anions as confirmed by FTIR-ATR analysis. A kinetic model to describe the formate ion degradation showed that an increasing fraction of Bi in the composite promotes a redox transition of >MOx(OH) to >MOx+1. In accelerated life tests under conditions corresponding to a service life of 2 years under an operational current density of 300 A m-2, dissociation of Ti component from Ir0.7Ta0.3Oy/TiO2 was found to be minimal, while BixTi(1-x)O(z) in the surface layers undergoes oxidation and a subsequent dissolution.									42	2	0	0	15	0	43			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000351971600041

Bench scale experiments were carried out using titanium oxide as photocatalyst. We studied the adsorption of HAs on TiO2 surface and we describe the kinetics of their photocatalytic degradation. The adsorption study of HA at three pH solution (1.9/7 5/11) by FT-IR DRIFT technique indicated that at acidic pH, HA are adsorbed on TiO2 mainly by carboxylate groups. We determined the isotherms of HA and it was shown that Langmuir model cannot be applied in this case. However, if the asymptotic values of the isotherms were assumed for these analytical methods the close values were obtained. The kinetics of degradation was followed with TOC and pH. There are no important pH evolutions. It was obtained 88% of TOC removal after 6 h of irradiation with optimum TiO2 loading 1 0 g/l. We observed the presence of two domains of HA degradation kinetics. In the first step, slight TOC decreased possibly due to the photodepolymerization of adsorbed HA on TiO2. In the second one, the photodegradation followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. Organic intermediates were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (PDA-detector) analysis as well as biological oxygen demand (BOD5). It was shown that photocatalysis process improved the biodegradability of HA nevertheless mineralization process mainly occurred and there was no large amount of easy biodegradable species present in the reaction solution.

O-2 evolution from one flash could be measured with 1% accuracy on the background of 10-50 mu mol O-2 mol(-1). Before the measurements leaves were pre-adapted either at 30-60 or 1700 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1) to induce different non-photochemical excitation quenching (q(N)). Short (1 min) exposures at the high light that created only energy-dependent, q(E) type quenching, caused no changes in the O-2 yield from saturating flashes or pulses that could be related to the q(E) quenching, but the yield from low intensity flashes and pulses decreased considerably. Long 30-60-min exposures at the high light induced a reversible inhibitory, q(I) type quenching that decreased the O-2 yield from both, saturating and limiting flashes and pulses (but more from the limiting ones), which reversed within 15 min under the low light. The results are in agreement with the notion that q(E) is caused by a quenching process in the PSII antenna and no changes occur in the PSII centres, but the reversible (15-30 min) q(I) quenching is accompanied by inactivation of a part of PSII centres.

Microwave-prepared Ti/RuO2-IrO(2 )anodes: Influence of IrO2 content on atrazine removal								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				426						140782	10.1016/j.electacta.2022.140782				SEP 10 2022	2022	Electrochemical oxidation is a promising technology for treating wastewater, although the search for new efficient and economically viable electrode materials is still necessary. Within this context, mixed metal oxide anodes appear as excellent alternatives, but their formulation is still an important point to study, looking for obtaining low-cost materials with high electrocatalytic efficiencies. In the search for these highly-efficient an-odes, here, we prepared three different coatings (RuO2)(0.7)(IrO2)(0.3), (RuO2)(0.8)(IrO2)(0.2), and (RuO2)0.9(IrO2)0.1 using microwave hybrid heating. All the prepared anodes exhibit excellent physical and electrochemical properties. However, as the proportion of IrO2 increases in the anode, the voltammetric charge and the contribution of the internal active sites increase, as well as the capacity for the electrochemical generation of hypochlorite ions. The electrochemical treatment of atrazine was performed using the synthesized electrodes and applying different current densities (20, 40, 60 mA cm(-2)). Faster and more efficient electrochemical oxidation occurs by applying 20 mA cm(-2, )regardless of the anode used, and the (RuO2)(0.7)(IrO2)(0.3) anode reaches the best performance. Finally, an important figure of merit was analyzed, the electrical energy by one order of magnitude (E-EO) used to remove atrazine. The anode (RuO2)(0.7)(IrO2)(0.3) reduced the EEO down to two folds for the optimal current density (20 mA cm(-2)) compared with the other anodes studied, highlighting its good features for treating effluents contaminated with pesticides.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000863271100008

However, its photocatalysis is significantly limited for the inherent characteristics of wide band gap. In this work, NaNbO3 and Ag dots-modified NaNbO3 micron-sized powders are prepared and applied in piezo-photocatalysis to explore the coupling effects. The results show that the piezocatalysis degradation efficiency of RhB solution (the initial concentration C0 = 5 mg/L) reaches 92.3% within 30 min, and the rate constant k is 0.0889 min-1. The efficiency of piezo-photocatalysis degradation reaches 92.7% in 25 min, and the rate constant k is 0.11 min-1 for NaNbO3. The rate constant k of Ag dots-modified NaNbO3 for piezo-photocatalytic degradation of RhB (C0 = 5 mg/L) is increased to 0.16314 min-1. The optical and electrochemical activities of NaNbO3-0.75hAg are studied to reveal the role of Ag nanoparticles. The band gap of NaNbO3 is 3.59 eV, which is decreased to 3.36 eV after the modification with Ag dots. The lower band gap means that e- in the valence band is more easily excited to shift the conduction band, which is beneficial to the photocatalytic reaction process. In addition, NaNbO3-0.75hAg has a higher photogenerated carrier density, a faster electron-hole pair separation and transfer rate, which are beneficial to the catalytic oxidation process. The work provides a useful means to decease the band gap of NaNbO3 and achieve outstanding piezo-photocatalysis for degradation of hazardous organic dyes in contaminated water.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000818779500001

In this work, four coal samples, demineralized coal (Dem-coal), coal loaded Ca (Ca + Dem-coal), coal containing Si and Al ((Si, Al)-coal), and coal loaded Ca, Si, and Al (Ca+(Si, Al)-coal), were prepared to analyze the impact of interactions on gasification reactivity. The gasification activity of coal samples with CO2 agent at 900 degrees C was evaluated via thermal gravimetric analyzer (TGA). An in-situ heating stage microscope was applied to record the change of morphology of coal particles in the whole process. Besides, Factsage thermodynamic calculations were combined with in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) results to investigate the evolution of minerals including Ca, Si, and Al. The results indicate that Ca presenting in the form of CaO exhibits excellent catalytic performance. Si and Al existing in the form of SiO2 crystals and amorphous structure respectively, hinder the process severely. Noticeably, the interactions of Si, Al, and Ca has a catalytic effect on coal gasification, though the gasification reactivity of Ca+(Si, Al)-coal is a bit lower than that of Ca + Dem-coal. In-situ XRD results confirmed the formation of CaSiO3, Ca2SiO4, and Ca2Al2SiO7, suggesting that these Ca complexes are catalytically active, but the catalytic performance of them is inferior to that of CaO. The evidence proved powerfully that it is not the reactions among Ca, Si, and Al which caused the deactivation of Ca catalyst.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000675760600004

The reversal-tolerant anode (RTA), a material-based solution, that inclusion of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst into the anode is usually employed to cope with the voltage reversal issue. In this work, we investigate the impact of anode catalyst layer thickness on the voltage reversal performance of the membrane-electrode assemblies (MEAs) with conventional anodes (Pt/C catalyst) and RTAs doped with IrO2 catalyst, a representative OER catalyst. We find that regardless of how thick the anode catalyst layer is, the conventional MEAs exhibit almost similar voltage reversal behaviors and times, only about 1 min to reach the shutdown voltage (-2.5 V). As for the RTA MEAs, a surprising thickness effect that the thinner RTA with the same IrO2 loading shows superior voltage reversal tolerance. Notably, an ultra-thin RTA (similar to 2 mu m) exhibits the reversal tolerance time of 310 min, which is five times higher reversal tolerance time than most of the reported RTAs. We conclude that this thickness effect mainly results from the ionomer distribution on the OER catalyst. Besides, we observe that the RTA with a higher ionomer content shows the better reversal tolerance performance. Our work highlights the importance of the OER Triple-Phase-Boundary (TPB) and the need for improved electrode designs for robust RTAs. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

This Review examines the strengths and limitations of different traditional and emerging approaches to demonstrate their inherent connection and highlight the evolving paradigms of materials design.Breakthroughs in molecular and materials discovery require meaningful outliers to be identified in existing trends. As knowledge accumulates, the inherent bias of human intuition makes it harder to elucidate increasingly opaque chemical and physical principles. Moreover, given the limited manual and intellectual throughput of investigators, these principles cannot be efficiently applied to design new materials across a vast chemical space. Many data-driven approaches, following advances in high-throughput capabilities and machine learning, have tackled these limitations. In this Review, we compare traditional, human-centred methods with state-of-the-art, data-driven approaches to molecular and materials discovery. We first introduce the limitations of human-centred Edisonian, model-system and descriptor-based approaches. We then discuss how data-driven approaches can address these limitations by promoting throughput, reducing cognitive overload and biases, and establishing atomistic understanding that is transferable across a broad chemical space. We examine how high-throughput capabilities can be combined with active learning and inverse design to efficiently optimize materials out of millions or an intractable number of candidates. Lastly, we pinpoint challenges to accelerate future workflows and ultimately enable self-driving platforms, which automate and streamline the optimization of molecules and materials in iterative cycles.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2058-8437			WOS:000843977800001		
J	Liu, Xinghao; Yang, Zhaoguang; Yang, Ying; Li, Haipu								Construction of carbon quantum dots sensitized porous carbon nitride/ titanium dioxide nanosheets for enhancing visible light photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline								JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING				10	4					108083	10.1016/j.jece.2022.108083				AUG 2022	2022	Porous carbon nitride/titanium dioxide nanosheets (pCN/TNs) were synthesized by annealing the mixtures of urea, oxalic acid, and prepared titanium dioxide nanosheets, and it was then modified by carbon quantum dots (CQDs) to produce CQD-pCN/TNs. The novel CQD-pCN/TNs composites possessed excellent photocatalytic performance for the degradation of tetracycline (TC) with 86.2% under 120 min visible light irradiation, which was improved by 54%, 32.2%, and 20.7% compared to the systems with CNs, TNs, or pCN/TNs, respectively. The study on the catalytic mechanism revealed that the enhanced photocatalytic activity was attributed to the expanded absorption wavelength range by CQDs and the inhibited electron-hole recombination by heterojunction structure. The redshift effect could be compensated by increasing the absorption of visible light for the constructed 1% CQD-pCN/TNs. However, excessive redshift of absorption wavelength band could reduce the photocatalytic activity. The center dot O2- , h+, center dot OH, and 1O2 could be generated, and the former two played major roles, while the latter two played supporting roles in the degradation of TC. Furthermore, the CQDs could promote the production of more reactive species. TC molecule was broken down into small molecules via ring-opening reactions or/and the cleavage of the main carbon bond. The antibacterial activities of treaded solutions and ecotoxicities were detected and predicted by bacteriostatic test and ECOSAR model. This work offered a new sight for the design of excellent photo-catalysts for organic pollutants degradation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2213-2929	2213-3437		WOS:000861613500003

In this work, a robust Au thin-film resistance temperature detector (RTD) was fabricated based on the micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) to achieve temperature monitoring inside PEMFC. Low-temperature heat treatment was carried out to promote the performance of RTD, and was confirmed to help achieve good linearity and small thermal hysteresis. Combined with X-ray diffusion (XRD) Rietveld refinement and morphology analysis, particularly the lattice strain and dislocation calculation, low-temperature heat treatment is supposed to help eliminate lattice defects and residual strains in the film. Subsequently, this prepared RTD was applied to measure cathode catalyst layer (CCL) temperature inside PEMFC under different relative humidity (RH) and current loads. The results show that current loads are positively related to temperature variation. The higher the current, the more Joule and irreversible heat are generated. The RH of anode and cathode has a more complex impact on temperature evolution, depending on the water concentration in the electrode sites, which is not only affected by RH, but also by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Too high water contents in the electrode area would bring about flooding, while too low would result in membrane drying, so both of them cause different levels of ohmic and mass transport loss, hence inducing temperature variations. This work is supposed to benefit the research of RTD enhancement and thermal state inside PEMFC. (C) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2590-1168			WOS:000836548000001

Some of the possibilities are currently are at theoretical phases, while some of them are well-explored experimentally. Nanoribbon-like structures of the 2D materials are ancillary entrants for 2D nanosheets with tunable and enhanced properties. Protuberant properties like abundant and highly exposed active sites on the edges facilitated electron transfer, and superior charge mobility, etc. make them poles apart from their bulk counterparts. Nowadays, these nanoribbon-like structures are contributing to countless applications such as solar cells, photodetectors, sensing, field emission, energy storage, and catalysis. Accordingly, we have put an overview of recent advancements in the properties, preparations, and applications of nanoribbon-like structures based on 2D materials. The contemporary review thoroughly recapitulates the numerous properties of nanoribbon-like materials including crystal structure, bandgap, optical, electrical, magnetic, and catalytic properties. Moreover, the review also addresses the tuning approaches used to optimize the properties of nanoribbon materials. The most recent synthesis approaches used for the preparation of nanoribbon-like structures are also highlighted along with their exceptional implementation in various intriguing applications. Furthermore, this comprehensive review put the finishing touches on a discussion of the present-day outlook and some of the crucial scientific challenges which have to be addressed to improve the performances of nanoribbons of 2D materials-based devices.

They contain layered arrangements of ordered Fe vacancies, which are at the origin of the various magnetic signals registered from certain natural rocks and can act as efficient electrocatalysts in oxygen evolution reactions in ultrathin form. Despite extensive studies over the past century, the local structural details of pyrrhotite superstructures formed by different arrangements of Fe vacancies remain unclear, in particular at the atomic scale. Here, atomic-resolution high-angle annular dark-field imaging and nanobeam electron diffraction in the scanning transmission electron microscope are used to study natural pyrrhotite samples that contain commensurate 4C and incommensurate 4.91 +/- 0.02C constituents. Local measurements of both the intensities and the picometer-scale shifts of individual Fe atomic columns are shown to be consistent with a model for the structure of 4C pyrrhotite, which was derived using X-ray diffraction by Tokonami et al. (1972). In 4.91 +/- 0.02C pyrrhotite, 5C-like unequally sized nano-regions are found to join at anti-phase-like boundaries, leading to the incommensurability observed in the present pyrrhotite sample. This conclusion is supported by computer simulations. The local magnetic properties of each phase are inferred from the measurements. A discussion of perspectives for the quantitative counting of Fe vacancies at the atomic scale is presented.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0003-004X	1945-3027		WOS:000604401600009

Under anthropogenic impact on the subsoil, conditions are created for the active development and opening of cracks as a result of deformation of the rock mass, under the influence of its open and underground part-time work. as a result, the emergence of conditions for the active penetration of atmospheric oxygen from the mine ventilation system and the surface atmosphere along the cracks formed as a result of deformation to sulfur-containing minerals of ores and rocks, prone to oxidation and spontaneous combustion. The mechanism of spontaneous combustion of pyritic rocks in the rock mass during the development of deposits is analyzed. It is proved that in the combined development of pyrite ore deposits, exogenous physicochemical processes must be considered in conjunction with geomechanical processes due to the development of mining operations beyond the open pit contour, aerogasdynamic determined by the method, scheme and ventilation system of an underground mine, as well as thermo-physical processes occurring as a result of exothermic oxidation of sulfides. An analysis of the influence of deformation processes on the oxidation and spontaneous combustion of pyrite ores and rocks showed that the most dangerous situations are ore ignition in the massif, intensively disturbed by fracture systems, and the incubation period before intense combustion depends on a large number of factors and can extend far into the massif , as the cracks open, increasing the temperature and, as a result, the porosity in the mass of burning rocks as a result of the evolution of gaseous products of the oxidation reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2218-5194			WOS:000546577500031		
J	Fayol, Noemie; Jebrak, Michel					Fayol, Noemie/0000-0002-8129-1596			Archean Sanukitoid Gold Porphyry Deposits: A New Understanding and Genetic Model from the Lac Bachelor Gold Deposit, Abitibi, Canada								ECONOMIC GEOLOGY				112	8			1913	1936		10.5382/econgeo.2017.4534				DEC 2017	2017	In the Abitibi subprovince of the Superior craton, Canada, recognition of intrusion-related gold deposits is improving, but their formation remains poorly understood. The recently reopened Lac Bachelor deposit in the northeastern part of the Abitibi subprovince is located on the edges of a syenitic complex, and this deposit is an example of a highly fractionated, Fe-Mg-poor, quartz-syenite to alkali-granite centered deposit. Gold is associated with pyrite in localized alkaline, fluorine, and hematite-rich metasomatized zones in magnetite-rich host rock. Minor mineralization is present in a quartz vein stockwork on the edges of the syenitic complex.A genetic model is proposed, wherein alkaline-oxidized magma, which favors sulfur and gold solubility and transport, migrates through the crust via major and subsidiary faults. The presence of miaroles, transolvus, and low-temperature crystallization conditions confirms the shallow emplacement of the magma. The high fluorine content of the magma, which lowers both viscosity and solidus temperature, favored the shallow emplacement of the magma and permitted the development of a long-lived magmatic-hydrothermal system. Oxygen and hydrogen isotopes, miaroles filling, and mineralized zone paragenesis confirm that oxidized hydrothermal fluids were exsolved from the magma. The planar geometry of the metasomatized ore zones indicates that hydrothermal fluid circulation and metasomatism reactions occurred preferentially in high permeability pathways, such as preexisting faults in the host rock. The redox contrast between the oxidized magmatic-hydrothermal fluid and the intermediate volcanic host rock caused sulfide precipitation and gold deposition. This genetic model is applied to the Abitibi subprovince and other Archean cratons.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			0361-0128	1554-0774		WOS:000426875900004		
J	Dunser, Martin W; Hasibeder, Walter R								Sympathetic overstimulation during critical illness: adverse effects of adrenergic stress.								Journal of intensive care medicine				24	5			293	316		10.1177/0885066609340519				2009 Sep-Oct	2009	The term ''adrenergic'' originates from ''adrenaline'' and describes hormones or drugs whose effects are similar to those of epinephrine. Adrenergic stress is mediated by stimulation of adrenergic receptors and activation of post-receptor pathways. Critical illness is a potent stimulus of the sympathetic nervous system. It is undisputable that the adrenergic-driven ''fight-flight response'' is a physiologically meaningful reaction allowing humans to survive during evolution. However, in critical illness an overshooting stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system may well exceed in time and scope its beneficial effects. Comparable to the overwhelming immune response during sepsis, adrenergic stress in critical illness may get out of control and cause adverse effects. Several organ systems may be affected. The heart seems to be most susceptible to sympathetic overstimulation. Detrimental effects include impaired diastolic function, tachycardia and tachyarrhythmia, myocardial ischemia, stunning, apoptosis and necrosis. Adverse catecholamine effects have been observed in other organs such as the lungs (pulmonary edema, elevated pulmonary arterial pressures), the coagulation (hypercoagulability, thrombus formation), gastrointestinal (hypoperfusion, inhibition of peristalsis), endocrinologic (decreased prolactin, thyroid and growth hormone secretion) and immune systems (immunomodulation, stimulation of bacterial growth), and metabolism (increase in cell energy expenditure, hyperglycemia, catabolism, lipolysis, hyperlactatemia, electrolyte changes), bone marrow (anemia), and skeletal muscles (apoptosis). Potential therapeutic options to reduce excessive adrenergic stress comprise temperature and heart rate control, adequate use of sedative/analgesic drugs, and aiming for reasonable cardiovascular targets, adequate fluid therapy, use of levosimendan, hydrocortisone or supplementary arginine vasopressin.									279	8	2	0	89	2	289				1525-1489		MEDLINE:19703817	19703817

The as-prepared NiP0.62S0.38 only needs overpotentials of 52 and 240 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (j(10)) in alkaline media for HER and OER, respectively. The DFT calculation results reveal that the electronegative phosphosulfide species shift Delta G(H)* to the thermo-neutral position and achieve a balance of hydrogen adsorption and detachment on nickel sites. The excellent OER activity of NiP0.62S0.38 is attributed to the formation of NiP0.62S0.38/NiOOH heterojunctions during water oxidation. Two identical NiP0.62S0.38 electrodes as anode and cathode are utilized to construct an alkaline electrolyzer, which delivers a j(10) at a small potential of 1.52 V, and can stably sustain the j(10) for 200 h, rivalling the integrated state-of-the-art Pt/C and IrO2.									61	2	0	0	2	0	61			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000405689000043

So far, semiconductor-based photoanodes are considered as promising candidates for conventional light harvesters due to their chemical robustness, earth abundance and adequate band gap. However, single semiconductor usually suffers from short diffusion length, fast recombi-nation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, difficulty to accelerate the interfacial charge transfer, poor elec-trical conductivity and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction kinetics, which limit their efficacy in PEC devices. Transition metal carbides, nitrides and carbonitrides (MXenes) is a new class of two-dimensional materials that has brought new opportunities to design synergistic systems for energy storage and conversion because of their interesting characteristics including rich interlayers groups, functional terminal groups and tunable optical and electronic properties. Therefore, decoration of semiconductors by MXene nanolayers or hybridization of MXene with semiconductor materials may facilitate to overcome the common obstacles including carriers' separation efficiency, and poor electrochemical properties. MXene/semiconductor hybrid materials can boost the photo -generated carriers' separation and transport and importantly revealed a significant performance as photoanodes. In fact, the new concept based on exploitation of MXene properties is crucial to generate enough space for ac-commodating charges (depletion zone, Schottky barriers) and enhance the electrical conductivity. Herein, an overview on MXene/semiconductor photoanodes current challenges and promising technologies for effective water oxidation is provided.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000861864100001		
J	Chen, Tao; Xiao, C. Y.; Li, Aigen; Zhou, C. T.								Where have all the interstellar silicon carbides gone?								MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY				509	4			5231	5236		10.1093/mnras/stab3175				FEB 2022	2022	The detection of the 11.3 mu m emission feature characteristic of the Si-C stretch in carbon-rich evolved stars reveals that silicon carbide (SiC) dust grains are condensed in the outflows of carbon stars. SiC dust could be a significant constituent of interstellar dust since it is generally believed that carbon stars inject a considerable amount of dust into the interstellar medium (ISM). The presence of SiC dust in the ISM is also supported by the identification of pre-solar SiC grains of stellar origin in primitive meteorites. However, the 11.3 mu m absorption feature of SiC has never been seen in the ISM, and oxidative destruction of SiC is often invoked. In this work, we quantitatively explore the destruction of interstellar SiC dust through oxidation based on molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations. We find that the reaction of an oxygen atom with SiC molecules and clusters is exothermic and could cause CO-loss. Nevertheless, even if this is extrapolable to bulk SiC dust, the destruction rate of SiC dust through oxidation could still be considerably smaller than the (currently believed) injection rate from carbon stars. Therefore, the lack of the 11.3 mu m absorption feature of SiC dust in the ISM remains a mystery. A possible solution may lie in the currently believed stellar injection rate of SiC (which may have been overestimated) and/or the size of SiC dust (which may actually be considerably smaller than submicron in size).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000780137000039

In this study, hydrothermal dewatering (HTD) method was used to upgrade a lignite from Inner Mongolia in China at 230-330 degrees C. The combustion behaviors of raw lignite and HTD samples were investigated by thermogravimetry with differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC). By changes of mass and heat flow, the lignite combustion process was described from three stages: water evaporation, coal devolatilization and char combustion. Compared with raw lignite, the combustion reactivity of HTD samples upgraded at 230-300 degrees C was improved, while that of sample upgraded at 330 degrees C decreased. The temperatures at maximum combustion rate of 230-300 degrees C samples (below 397.6 degrees C) were lower and that of 330 degrees C samples (448.9 degrees C) was higher than that of raw lignite (399.8 degrees C). The released heat at char combustion stage increased for HTD samples. Then the physico-chemical structures of lignite before and after HTD process were analyzed to investigate the effect of HTD on coal combustion characteristics. Results showed that HTD process could affect the heat at water evaporation and initial devolatilization stages during coal combustion through removing oxygen functional groups in lignite. The enhancement in aromaticity of lignite after HTD increased activation energy of intrinsic reaction, whereas the large pore volume and high surface area of 230-300 degrees C samples decreased diffusion activation energy at char combustion stage. The effect of pore structure predominated on combustion reactivity compared with aromaticity for HTD samples.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000588132400162

However, scaling up of this process requires overcoming the inherent constraints of the low energy efficiency partly associated with the pH-neutral electrolyte with low conductivity. Most of the research in the field is concentrated on the bacterial cultivation, whereas the analysis and evaluation of the electrode material performance have received little attention in the literature so far. Therefore, in the present work, in situ electrolysis of a pH-neutral medium for HOB cultivation was performed with different combinations of electrode materials. Besides conventional electrode types, electrodes with coatings made of earth-abundant cobalt and a nickel-iron alloy, known for their catalytic activity for the kinetically sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), were prepared and tested as potential substitutes for catalysts made of precious metals. The cultivation of HOB with in situ water electrolysis has been successfully tested in a small scale electrobioreactor in order to support the experimental results. A simplified water electrolysis model was developed and applied to evaluate the current-voltage characteristics of an bioelectrochemical system prototype. Application of the developed model allows quantitative evaluation and comparison of reversible, ohmic, and activation overvoltages of different electrode sets. The modeling results were found to agree well with the experimental data. The developed model and the data gathered can be applied to further investigation, simulation, and optimization of HBI systems.									12	0	0	0	4	0	12				2405-8440		WOS:000473561400123	31193244

The photoactive sulfides rationally integrateviastrong electrostatic interactions between ZnIn(2)S(4)and SnS with two-dimensional ultrathin subunits,i.e.nanopetals. The morphological study of nano-heterostructures revealed that the hierarchical marigold flower-like structure is self-assembledviathe nanopetals of ZnIn2S4 with few layers of SnS nanopetals. Surprisingly, it also showed that the SnS nanopetals with a thickness of similar to 25 nm couplein situwith the nanopetals of ZnIn(2)S(4)with a thickness of similar to 25 nm to form a marigold flower-like assembly with intimate contact. Considering the unique band gap (2.0-2.4 eV) of this SnS@ZnIn2S4, photocatalytic hydrogen generation from water and H2S was performed under sunlight. SnS@ZnIn(2)S(4)exhibits enhanced hydrogen evolution,i.e.650 mu mol h(-1)g(-1) from water and 6429 mu mol h(-1)g(-1)from H2S, which is much higher compared to that of pure Zn In2S4 and SnS. More significantly, the enhancement in hydrogen generation is 1.6-2 times more for H2S splitting and 6 times more for water splitting. SnS@ZnIn2S4 forms type I band alignment, which accelerates charge separation during the surface reaction. Additionally, this has been provoked by the nanostructuring of the materials. Due to the nano-heterostructure with hierarchical morphology, the surface defects increased which ultimately suppresses the recombination of the electron-hole pair. The above-mentioned facts demonstrate a significant improvement in the interface electron transfer kinetics due to such a unique 2D nano-heterostructure semiconductor which is responsible for a higher photocatalytic activity.									11	1	0	0	2	0	11			2516-0230			WOS:000543283200038	36133357

Herein, we developed polyaniline (PANI)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) (PANI/rGO) as an efficient and low-cost electrocatalyst support material to improve the efficiency of nickel phosphide (NiP) for alkaline urea oxidation via a combination of facile solvothermal method and simple ultrasonic/heat mediated dispersion process. The synthesized electrode material was characterized using HRSEM, XRD, ART-FTIR, UV-VIS spectroscopy, and TGA. The physical characterization revealed the multifaceted phases and microspherical NiP with a particle size of 2.44 mu m and dispersed NiP on the surface of support materials. Furthermore, the electrochemical activities of synthesized electrode materials towards alkaline urea oxidation were tested using cyclic voltammetry (CV). The electrochemical study depicts the higher performance of NiP@PANI/rGO in terms of low onset potential (0.292 V), anodic peak potential of 0.427 V to drive a high current density of 15.76 mAcm(-2), high electrochemically active surface area (18.29 cm(2)mg(-1)), and high stability towards alkaline urea electro-oxidation compared with pristine NiP and NiP@rGO. These significant efficiency improvements of NiP can be ascribed by the synergetic effect between PANI and rGO and higher immobilization of NiP particles on as-synthesized PANI/rGO support material due to strong interaction between Ni2+ and -N.H.-fragments of PANI. Therefore, the higher electrochemical performance of a novel electrode material NiP@PANI/rGO would be a promising candidate for alkaline urea electro-oxidation in direct urea fuel cell applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000754978200001

X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy with an integrated system for electron microprobe analysis (SEM, EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Infrared (IR) and Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy were applied for the powders characterization. The presence of a hysteresis loop in the nitrogen ad(de)sorption isotherms for the synthesized samples proved their mesoporous structure. XRD analysis revealed the anatase and rutile phase in TiO2SG with a size of 10 and 7 nm, respectively, and only anatase phase (15-16 nm) for all TiO2/C-SG samples modified by a sol-gel method was observed. Carbon additives to TiO2 did not lead to significant shifts in the peaks of bond energies of Ti 2p, O 1s and C 1s levels. The powders TiO2/C-SG had additional bands in IR-spectra which are characteristic bonds of carbon with oxygen unlike the TiO2/C-MC samples. It was found that modification of titanium dioxide with carbon by a sol-gel method leads to the band gap narrowing. Photocatalytic activity of the synthesized samples was investigated in H-2 photoproduction and Rifampicinum (RF) photodestruction. The TiO2/C-SG samples showed higher photocatalytic activity in both reactions compared to TiO2/C-MC. The correlation between the RF photocatalytic degradation degree and RF adsorption was demonstrated. The reusability of the powders in RF photodegradation was checked.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0922-6168	1568-5675		WOS:000712743400002

The metal centres, carbon matrixes, and coordination characteristics collectively determine the electronic features of carbon-based SACs, and their behaviours in catalysing peroxide activation and efficiencies in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). However, there is lack of a comprehensive and critical review reporting the successful marriage of carbon-based SACs in AOP-based remediation technologies. It is particularly necessary to systematically compare and reveal the catalytic sites and the associated mechanisms of carbon-based SACs in diverse AOP systems. In this review, we highlight the synthetic strategies, characterisation, and computation of carbon-based SACs, and for the first time, showcase their innovative applications in AOP technologies. We unveil the origins of versatile catalytic oxidation pathways in different AOP systems and the mechanisms of micropollutant degradation over carbon-based SACs, distinguished from the upsized counterparts (metals/oxides and carbon substrates). We also provide directions to the rational design of on-demand SACs for green chemistry and environmental sustainability. Also, we suggest a designated and integrated experimental/theoretical protocol for revealing the structure-catalysis relations of SACs in AOP applications, and propose the prospects for future opportunities and challenges.									199	9	0	0	70	0	201			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000637398600001	33904567

Hereinto, highly stable semiconducting nickel oxide (NiO) nanoparticles were synthesized by a facile, biomi-metic and cost effective one pot synthesis route. Nickel (II) acetate tetrahydrate was used as a precursor and medicinal plant Olea ferruginea Royle as a reducing agent. The biosynthesized NiO NPs were scrutinized by UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy UV Vis.), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GC-MS), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The average particle size of the NiO NPs was 13 +/- 1 nm which was calculated by Scherrer equation, with uniform cubic shape. NiO supported on Ni-foam was investigated as an electro-catalyst for water splitting application. The results revealed an over potential of 0.41 V and Tafel slope of 97 mVdec(-1) at 10 mA/cm 2 which is comparable to benchmark catalysts. These results suggests that the organic framework derived NiO could be a competitor to the chemically syn-thesized electrode material that comprises of costly reagents and require advanced synthesis approaches. Thus, in present study we believe that bio-assisted NiO is an efficient electrode material for water splitting studies and could be a sustainable step towards the replacement of noble metal-based electro-catalysts for energy conversion.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2213-1388	2213-1396		WOS:000551067200002

Cu first deposited on TNAs electrode by a galvanostatic pulse method and CuO was prepared by in-situ oxidation copper in alkaline solution through cyclic voltammetry (CV). The effect of the cycle number of cyclic voltammograms and different substrate on the sensing performance were investigated. It was found that the optimal cycle number of CV is 100. The optimal CuO/Cu/TNAs electrode presents high sensitivity (814 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2)) and wide linear range, with formaldehyde concentration from 65.0 mu M to 7.80 mM, a detection limit of 25.0 mu M (S/N = 3) and good repeatability, allowing prompt quantitative analysis of formaldehyde in alkaline solutions. Furthermore, compared to the glass carbon electrode (GCE) modified by a layer of CuO nanopaticles growing on the surface of Cu for the oxidation of formaldehyde, the CuO/Cu/TNAs electrode presents higher anodic oxidation current density and excellent cycling stability, showing that the CuO/Cu/TNAs electrode is more electro-active for oxidation of formaldehyde than the CuO/Cu/GCE. The prominent and stable electrocatalytic activity toward formaldehyde result from the synergistic effect between CuO/Cu and TNAs. In addition, the surface CuO nanoparticles on the CuO/Cu/TNAs electrode are more likely to form the highly active CuOOH species during oxidation process, which is the key to enhance the catalytic efficiency of CuO/Cu/TNAs electrodes.

In this study, graphene membranes were used as the working electrode, and cobalt nanoparticles (Co-NPs) were grown directly on top of the graphene through electrochemical deposition for interfacial variation. The electronic structure and the chemical bonding states of the Co-NPs and the graphene materials were examined by using the high spatial resolution and element-specific properties of scanning transmission X-ray microscopy. X-ray absorption spectra of C, O, and Co revealed that the Co-NP size increased in accordance with the oxidation state (Co0/2+/3+), depending on the configuration of carbon bonding (C-C/C-OH/HO-C=O/O-C(O)-O/C=O-like state). We conducted a spectral comparison of the dipped graphene and the electrodeposited Co-graphene sample, which revealed an increase in C-OH formation before Co-NPs growth. In addition to electron transfer and electrochemical reduction, the oxidation evolution from C-OH to HO-C=O (or a defect) and the O-C(O)-O (or C=O) state paralleled the increase in Co-NPs size. We curve-fitted the results to demonstrate the reduction in chemical structure from mixing Co2+/3+ to Co3+/2+/0, and to explain the interfacial modulation and the unique metal Co-0 layer on the surface of the Co-NPs. Our results provide information for the design of a reliable graphene window and offer an example for the interpretation of experimental X-ray (electron) microscopy.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0577-9073			WOS:000779181300003

Since specific oxyfunctionalizations are among the most-desired reactions in synthetic chemistry, UPOs are of high industrial interest. To broaden the number of available enzymes, computational and experimental methods were combined in this study. After a comparative alignment and homology modelling, the enzymes were expressed directly in P. pastoris. Out of ten initially selected sequences, three enzymes (one from Aspergillus niger and two from Candolleomyces aberdarensis) were actively expressed. Cultivation of respective expression clones in a bioreactor led to production titers of up to 300 mg L-1. Enzymes were purified to near homogeneity and characterized regarding their specific activities and pH-optima for typical UPO substrates. This work demonstrated that directed evolution is not necessarily required to produce UPOs in P. pastoris at respective titers. The heterologous producibility of these three UPOs will expand the toolbox of available enzymes and help to advance their synthetic application.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3				2076-3921		WOS:000770866700001	35204106

A combination of catalysts with photoelectrodes is generally required for the development of active photoanodes in PEC devices. In this work, we present two BiVO4 photoanodes modified with cobalt salophen (Co(salophen)) complexes for PEC water oxidation. The resulting photoanodes show significantly enhanced PEC performance. Under simulated sunlight illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm(-2)), high photocurrents of 3.89 mA cm(-2) and 4.27 mA cm(-2) were obtained for Co1/BiVO4 and Co2/BiVO4, respectively at 1.23 V (vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) in a neutral solution, an almost three-fold enhancement over that of the unmodified BiVO4. Intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) analysis shows that the Co(salophen) complexes not only accelerate the water oxidation reaction but also reduce the surface recombination. The half-cell solar energy conversion efficiencies for Co1/BiVO4 and Co2/BiVO4 were 1.09% and 1.18% at 0.7 V, respectively. Due to their hydrophobic nature, the Co(salophen) complexes can bind strongly to the surface of BiVO4. When the Co2 complex featuring four hydrophobic tert-butyl groups in a salophen ligand was anchored to BiVO4, an extremely stable photocurrent of more than 3.5 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE is sustained for at least 3 h without decay. Such a stable and robust photoanode based on a molecular WOC surpasses those attained by most of the state-of-the-art heterogeneous catalysts.									35	1	0	0	1	0	35			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000439389100018

In the current study, electrochemical properties of a water-soluble rhenium(I) tricarbonyl complex with hydroxymethyl groups [(Re(CH2OH)-OH2](+)) and its electrocatalysis for CO2 reduction were investigated in aqueous solutions. In comparison with general rhenium(I) carbonyl complexes, [Re(CH2OH)-OH2](+) shows high solubility in water even in the presence of both CO2 and OH-. In an aqueous solution, [Re(CH2OH)-OH2](+) exhibited a catalytic current due to CO2 reduction in a cyclic voltammogram at a positive potential of about 400 mV more than that in a DMF solution. It is suggested that two molecules of a one electron-reduced Re complex participated in reducing one molecule of CO2 in the aqueous solution. Electrolysis using [Re(CH2OH)-OH2](+) at -1.1 V vs NHE in a CO2-saturated aqueous solution afforded CO and HCOOH with 95 and 4% selectivity, respectively, at pH 6.9; thermodynamically favorable H-2 evolution via water reduction was almost completely suppressed. Even at pH 4.2, the selectivity of CO2 reduction was still high (CO 84%; HCOOH 3%). A full cell consisting of a cathode unit with [Re(CH2OH)-OH2]* for CO2 reduction and an IrO2/FTO anode for water oxidation electrocatalytically produced both CO and O-2 as the main products with high efficiency and selectivity.									46	1	0	0	1	1	46			2155-5435			WOS:000419751100038

At the heart of these engineering aspects lie the mass transport of reactants, intermediates and products throughout the device. This review comprehensively covers these aspects and ties together all of the processes required for the efficient production of pure streams of solar-hydrogen. In order to do so, the article describes the fundamental physical processes that occur at different locations of a generalized device topology and presents the state-of-the-art advances in materials and engineering approaches to mitigate mass-transport challenges. Processes that take place in the light absorber and electrocatalyst components are only briefly described, while the main focus is given to mass transport processes in the boundary-layer and bulk liquid or solid electrolytes. Lastly, a perspective on how engineering approaches can enable more efficient solar-fuel generators is presented.									60	1	0	0	3	0	60			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000375699500002

Here, an approach is explored that uses crystalline Co3O4 as an oxygen evolving catalyst and a nanometer-thin dense phase silica layer as the separation barrier. For controlled charge transport across the barrier, hole conducting molecular wires are embedded in the silica. Spherical Co3O4(4 nm)-SiO2(2 nm) core-shell nanoparticles with p-oligo(phenylenevinylene) wire molecules (three aryl units, PV3) cast into the silica were developed to establish proof of concept for charge transport across the embedded wire molecules. FT-Raman, FT-infrared, and UV-Visible spectroscopy confirmed the integrity of the organic wires upon casting in silica. Transient optical absorption spectroscopy of a visible light sensitizer (ester derivatized [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) complex) indicates efficient charge injection into Co3O4-SiO2 particles with embedded wire molecules in aqueous solution. An upper limit of a few microseconds is inferred for the residence time of the hole on the embedded PV3 molecule before transfer to Co3O4 takes place. The result was corroborated by light on/off experiments using rapid scan FT-IR monitoring. These observations indicate that hole conducting organic wire molecules cast into a dense phase, nanometer thin silica layer offer fast, controlled charge transfer through a product-s'epurating oxide barrier.									50	2	0	0	5	0	50			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000320485700008

Interaction between electric conductive materials and sodium diborate glass under electric field								Journal of the Society of Materials Science, Japan				29	322			749	53						July 1980	1980	The electrochemical behaviors of other electric conductive materials such as Co, graphite, W and Cr were investigated by the linear potential sweep method and potential step chronoamperometry. Current-potential curves were obtained at various potential sweep rates (5~0.5 V/sec) and various potential spans between 0 and 5 V for anodic polarization and between 0 and -4 V for cathodic polarization. All the measurements were carried out under N2 atmosphere at 900degC. By anodic potential sweep of a Co electrode, the current-potential curve having a large current peak at ca. 1 V was obtained. Such a passivation phenomenon may be explained with the oxide film formation on the electrode surface by the reaction, Co+O2-=CoO+2e. By applying higher potential than 3 V, a plateau accompanied by small vibrating waves resulting from the oxygen gas evolution was observed on the current-potential curve.									2	0	0		0	0	2			0514-5163			INSPEC:1608151

Most of the preparations for black-TiO2 involve either high temperature calcination, plasma, lengthy chemical reactions or dealing with dangerous or toxic chemicals. We found, by accident, that Mo-Ti oxo-clusters are efficient catalysts for the hydrogenation of a TiO2 electrode to black-TiO2 at room temperature. A series of Mo-Ti oxo-clusters, [Ti4Mo4O10(OR)(14)(X-BA)(2)] (BA = benzoate, X = H (1), F (2), Cl (3), and Br (4)), were prepared and were characterized by crystallography. They have a Mo4Ti4 structure with Mo(v)-Mo(v) metal-metal interactions. The activated hydrogen (H*) generated by electrochemically catalytic water splitting turns the TiO2 electrode to black-TiO(2)at room temperature, due to the reduction of Ti(iv) to H+Ti(iii). The potentials applied for water reduction must generally be higher than the overpotential at the TiO2 electrode (-1.0 Vvs.RHE). In this work, the onset potential of hydrogen evolution significantly decreased to -0.1 Vvs. RHE. Using this blackened 1-TiO2 electrode, the effective electrochemical catalytic degradation of a dye was examined in comparison with the degradation using the white TiO2 electrode. This work provides a method for the facile preparation of a black-TiO2 film, and is a step forward in black-TiO2 research.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000555330900021	32691817

The gravityassisted drainage principle is applied for the stack to design the wettability of gas diffusion layers (GDLs) and the anode channel geometry, which can help the liquid water that diffuses to the anode to drain out of the anode porous electrode and move down the anode channel outlets. As a result, the stack can stably operate in a long purge interval of 268 s and in a short purge time of 2 s. In addition, using this design, only four small-power fans are employed to pump air to the cathode to provide oxygen for the electrochemical reaction and cool the stack. With a constant load current of 30, 45, or 60 A, the stack output voltage is experimentally tested at various cathode air flow rates (CAFRs). The local temperatures (60 measurement points) inside the stack and the pressure differences across anode channels are also monitored to understand heat dissipation and the back diffusion of liquid water. In a wide range of operating conditions, the designed stack possesses superior and stable voltage output characteristics with relatively uniform temperature distributions. The measured maximum output power is 3.83 kW, and the parasitic powers of fans are only 80 similar to 112 W. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Large discrepancies in material properties as well as in electrocatalytic activity and stability become obvious when materials are tested under the conditions of their intended use as opposed to the usual laboratory conditions.

Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) measurements, UV-Vis spectroscopy, elemental mapping, energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were utilized to determine the successful intercalation of CoTcPP into ZrP. While the CoTcPP molecule is not amendable to be used as a heterogeneous catalyst in basic environment due to the carboxylic groups, the intercalated species (CoTcPP/ZrP) is effective towards water oxidation from KOH aqueous solution when utilized as a heterogeneous electrocatalyst and shows remarkable catalytic durability. Electrochemical results show that CoTcPP/ZrP requires an overpotential of 0.467 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) while the pristine alpha-ZrP shows negligible electrocatalytic OER behavior.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2398-4902			WOS:000611818900011

X-ray diffraction measurements revealed the tetragonal perovskite structure with the P4mm space group for all the samples. The SEM images showed a decrease in the average grain size from 1.23 to 0.11 mu m as cobalt dopant amount increases. The magnetic hysteresis loops sufficiently indicated the antiferromagnetic character for all the synthesized samples. At room temperature, the dielectric constant exhibited a decrease with the increasing Co amount. However, both the dielectric constant and dielectric loss increased with temperature without the appearance of any phase transition from room temperature to 380 ?. The sigma(ac) plots versus frequency showed an increase, according to the Jonscher power law. Complex impedance results demonstrated the semiconducting nature for all the ceramics through the presence of the negative temperature coefficient of resistivity. For all samples, the transport properties of charge carriers were found to be thermally activated. Thermal evolution of the sigma(dc) for all the compounds was described by the Arrhenius law. The transport mechanism was found governed by the electrons resulting from the ionization of the oxygen vacancies. The optical results of all compounds showed strong absorption in the whole visible range. The optical band gap energy was found in the semiconducting range 2.98-1.12 eV. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, an ultrathin catalyst layer was constructed based on Pt-decorated nanoporous gold (NPG-Pt) with sub-Debye-length thickness for proton transfer. In the absence of ionomer incorporation in the CLs, these integrated carbon-free electrodes can deliver maximum mass-specific power density of 198.21 and 25.91 kW.g(Pt)(-1) when serving individually as the anode and cathode, at a Pt loading of 5.6 and 22.0 mu g.cm(-2), respectively, comparable to the best reported nano-catalysts for PEMFCs. In-depth quantitative experimental measurements and finite-element analyses indicate that improved proton conduction plays a critical role in activation, ohmic and mass transfer polarizations.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000603538400010

The generation of radicals is modelled from H2O oxidation using the more stable and labile crystal face and structure of each material, and the relationship between its adsorption and reactivity towards organic compounds is analyzed. The method of linear Gibbs energy relationship (LGER) is likewise used to compute the reversible potential to oxidize H2O to HO center dot. The adsorption energies, calculated for 25, 50 and 100% surface coverages of HO center dot, decrease in the following order: IrO2> RuO2> SnO2 TiO2> PbO2> BDD; while the reaction energies involved in the degradation of a model organic species (catechol) by this radical present an opposite trend: IrO2 < RuO2 < Sn02r=:TiO2< PbO2 < BDD, similar to the experimental electroactivity reported to oxidize organics on these materials. This theoretical finding quantitatively indicates that the reactive trend depending on potential for these catalysts is a tradeoff between the adsorption energies for H2O and HO center dot, whereby an ideal material to perform organic degradation will not only weakly adsorb HO center dot species, but will also present an even Weaker H2O adsorptitin. Accordingly, the theoretical results described in this study can enable the design of new electrocatalysts through the search of low cost, non-toxic and durable materials with modulated adsorptive properties via computational methods.

The catalytic oxidation of hydrogen on the candidate catalysts was further examined during cyclic voltammetric scans of the substrate with a tip close to the substrate. The quantitative rate of hydrogen oxidation on the candidate substrates was determined for different substrate potentials from SECM approach curves by fitting to a theoretical model. SECM screening results revealed that Pt4Pd6, Pt9Ru1 and Pt3Ir7 were the optimum composition of the catalysts from the Pt-Pd, Pt-Ru and Pt-ir bimetallic systems for hydrogen sensors. The catalytic activity of the candidate catalysts in HOR was highly dependent on the substrate potential. The kinetic parameters for HOR were obtained on Pt4Pd6 (Tafel slope = 124 mV, k degrees = 0.19 cm/s, alpha = 0.52), Pt9Ru1 (Tafel slope = 140 mV, k degrees = 0.08 cm/s, alpha = 0.58) and Pt3Ir7 (Tafel slope= 114 mV, k degrees = 0.11 cm/s, alpha = 0.48) and compared with Pt (Tafel slope= 118 mV, k degrees = 0.17 cm/s, alpha = 0.5). Among the bimetallic catalysts studied. Pt4Pd6 exhibited the highest activity toward HOR with a high standard rate constant value in a wide range of applied potentials.

After 3.5 years of ageing an intensive resonant absorption was detected in the form of a single line. The latter effect has not been observed earlier for solid iron(III) hydroxo derivatives which have commonly been expected to give either quadrupole or hyperfine magnetic splitting. The precipitate aged for 15 months was found to give an essentially lower Mossbauer effect. After complete hydrolysis in water both products gave comparably intensive quadrupole-split doublets with distinctly different parameters owing to differences in the structures of the initial phases. The absence of quadrupole splitting for the 3.5-year-aged product is interpreted in terms of the formation of the cubic symmetry of the ferric ion coordination polyhedron in sodium hydroxoferrate(III), slowly forming in the course of long-term storage in highly alkaline medium, while at earlier stages of ageing, the precipitate consists of a labile, possibly intermediate, phase (eg ultrafine alpha-FeOOH particles) characterized by a low recoilless absorption probability. The results obtained are considered in relation with the processes occurring in alkaline storage batteries and electrolysers.Some effects leading to Mossbauer linewidth broadening, which may in principle take place in strongly alkaline electrolytes containing ferric derivatives with a symmetric hydroxo coordination, are also discussed.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0013-4686			WOS:A1995QZ39500012

The photocatalytic properties of calcium titanate are affected by substitution with transition metals. In this study, the simultaneous inclusion of Mg and La in CaTiO3 was investigated using density functional theory and the generalized gradient approximation functional of Perdew-Burke-Erzenhoff. Including elements had important effects on the structural, photocatalytic, optical, and electronic properties of semiconductor materials. Mg and La were introduced at the calcium sites at a ratio of 2:1. The effects of including Mg and La on the band structure, structural parameters, and optical properties, such as the absorption, static dielectric constant, and reflectivity, were elucidated in detail and clear correlations were also established between them. Co-doping had significant effects on the structural and electronic parameters. The band gap increased due to occupation of states in the conduction band. The static dielectric function decreased from 6 to 3.2, and the static refractive index with doping was 1.8. The reflectivity decreased from less than 20% in case of pure CaTiO3 to less than 10% with codoping. Clear correlations were established between the electronic properties, such as the band gap and lattice parameter, and the optical properties in order to understand the results obtained. Water splitting was investigated for the pure and doped CaTiO3 in the ultraviolet and visible ranges. Pure and (Mg, La)-CaTiO3 exhibited oxygen evolution reaction activity. The materials are clearly lead-free and suitable for green energy applications because of their photocatalytic activities, and they also have an ideal band gap range for solar cell applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-3697	1879-2553		WOS:000861660300006

Herein, a fast micro-nano liquid layer induced construction (MLC) strategy is proposed, ensuring a tenfold increase in electrode size with almost negligible heat consumption. As a conceptual application model, cation coupled FeOOH nanosheets of thousands of square centimetres are synthesized within 20 minutes at room temperature for water splitting. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that the modulation of binary cations (Ni and Zr) leads to charge accumulation around Fe sites. This results in a more balanced proton adsorption for the HER, as well as a lowered energy barrier for the OER. The proposed strategy paves the way for the scaled-up synthesis of nanostructured electrocatalysts, and also provides a platform for exploring more functional nanostructured compounds.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000721870700001

Morphology-dependent CeO2 nanocrystallines with special crystal planes and increased amounts of specific surface areas, structural defects, and active sites have recently demonstrated excellent performance in catalysis. In this article, a biomass-assisted synthesis of CeO2 (BC) photocatalyst is successfully synthesized via a simple yet effective hydrothermal-calcining method by using commercial Ce(NO3)(3) as a precursor and leaves of Alternanthera philoxeroides (LAP) as a crystal growth modifier. The amount of LAP introduced into the precursor has a significant effect on regulating the growth of the formed CeO2 from nanocubes to nanorods for the resulting BCs. Owing to the emergence of the just right microenvironment for regulating the growth of the CeO2 nanocrystalline, the optimal sample of BC-15 with a morphology of nanorods is found to be the most efficient one as a photocatalyst for CO2 reduction under visible light. As the major product, the CO yield (126.8 mu mol g(-1) at a reaction time of 6 h) of BC-15 is similar to 7.4-fold of the reference CeO2 nanocubes synthesized without LAP in the precursor. In addition, the underlying evolution process of the nanorods and detailed mechanism insight into the boosted CO2 photoreduction performance are investigated by means of a series of experimental characterizations and results. The present work provides a meaningful protocol to utilize the crystal phase engineering strategy to design morphology dependence of photocatalysts and assisted synthesis with renewable biomass materials for solar-to-fuel conversion.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2574-0970		WOS:000644473900098

The electrocatalytic activity of Mo2C/N-rGO nanocomposite towards HER, the performance of simultaneous bioelectricity and hydrogen production as well as landfill leachate treatment of this coupled system were investigated under continuous parallel flow mode. Results demonstrated that four air-cathode MFCs in series stacking harvested the highest power density of 536 mW m(-2) when fed with glucose and ammonium mixture, and meanwhile approximately 59 mu L g(Mo2C/N-rGO)(-1) h(-1) of hydrogen production rate was achieved with continuous bioelectricity supply to the AEC unit. As the substrate was shifted to actual landfill leachate (dilution ratio of 1: 4), only ca. 143 mW m(-2) of maximal output power was obtained from the series stacked MFCs, but it still accomplished 71% NH4+-N removal efficiency and about 42 mu L g(Mo2C/N-rGO)(-1) h(-1) of hydrogen production rate. This MFCs-AEC coupled bio-electrochemical system highlighted its potential for hydrogen production from real landfill leachate along with simultaneous chemical oxygen demand and ammonia-nitrogen removal without the need for external electricity supply, thus achieving the resource and energy re-utilization of ammonia-rich wastewater.

In response, we propose using oxidatively-inert ligands to harness the metal oxides themselves. This approach is demonstrated by covalently attaching entirely inorganic oxo-donor ligands (polyoxometalates) to 3-nm hematite cores, giving soluble anionic structures, highly resistant to aggregation, yet thermodynamically stable to oxidation and hydrolysis. Using orthoperiodate (at pH 8), and no added photosensitizers, the hematite-core complex catalyzes visible-light driven water oxidation for seven days (7600 turnovers) with no decrease in activity, far exceeding the documented lifetimes of molecular catalysts under turnover conditions in water. As such, a fundamental limitation of molecular complexes is entirely bypassed by using coordination chemistry to harness a transition-metal oxide as the reactive center of an inherently stable, homogeneous water-oxidation catalyst.									41	1	0	0	4	0	41			2041-1723			WOS:000450584900009	30459390

To further understand this concept, a unique cobalt-substituted crystalline zinc oxide (Co:ZnO) precatalyst has been synthesized by low-temperature solvolysis of molecular heterobimetallic Co4-xZnxO4 (x=1-3) precursors in benzylamine. Its electrophoretic deposition onto fluorinated tin oxide electrodes leads after oxidative conditioning to an amorphous self-supported water-oxidation electrocatalyst, which was observed by HR-TEM on FIB lamellas of the EPD layers. The Co-rich hydroxide-oxidic electrocatalyst performs at very low overpotentials (512mV at pH7; 330mV at pH12), while chronoamperometry shows a stable catalytic current over several hours.									61	2	0	0	5	0	61			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000335476400034	24777630

Fortunately, throughout evolution cells have developed repair mechanisms, such as the 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylases (OGG), which recognize and excise 8-oxoG from DNA thereby preventing the accumulation of deleterious mutations. OGG are divided into three subfamilies, OGG1, OGG2 and AGOG, which are all involved in the base excision repair (BER) pathway. The published structures of OGG1 and AGOG, as well as the recent availability of OGG2 structures in both apo- and liganded forms, provide an excellent opportunity to compare the structural and functional properties of the three OGG subfamilies. Among the observed differences, the three-dimensional fold varies considerably between OGG1 and OGG2 members, as the latter lack the A-domain involved in 8-oxoG binding. In addition, all three OGG subfamilies bind 8-oxoG in a different manner even though the crucial interaction between the enzyme and the protonated N7 of 8-oxoG is conserved. Finally, the three OGG subfamilies differ with respect to DNA binding properties, helix-hairpin-helix motifs, and specificity for the opposite base.									29	1	1	0	24	0	32			1422-0067			WOS:000306188700012	22837659

The lead electrode cycling was carried out within (-1200 to -800 mV) and (+800 to +1600 mV) potential ranges. The ammonium dichromate concentration in the electrolyte was changed from 3.5 ppm to 3000 ppm. The values of the kinetic parameters, determined from the polarization curves, point out the intensification of the anodic and cathodic processes, on addition. Taking, into account the shape of the potentiograms, the values of the kinetic parameters from these potentiograms, and the coulometric rations R-1, R-2, R-3 and R-4, a succession of reactions was proposed. Lead and lead-alloys anodes have been show that with increasing anodic polarization, first an insulating layer of PbSO4, then a conductive layer of PbO2, are successively formed on the electrode. In the PbO2 potential domain, different crystalline phases (alpha and beta) can be formed, the (x phase of PbO2 being in fact a non-stoichiometric alpha-PbO2 layer, with (1.4 < n < 2). The impedance data were consistent with the Pavlov's model of Pb/PbOn/PbSO4 electrode, and the anode behaviour appeared to be essentially determinated by the electrolysis time. It has been shown that the layer growth is first controlled by the solid state diffusion Of SO42- ions, and then by a chemical step associated with a change in charge carriers taking place at the PbCn/PbSO4 interface.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0035-3930			WOS:000244132900030

Increasing pressure to 2.5 bar at 120 degrees C enhances the water electrolysis current, so the anode electrodeposited with 0.1 mg cm(-2) IrO2 gives a current density of 1.79 A cm(-2) at 1.6 V, which is comparable to the conventional powder-type IrO2 electrode with 2.0 mg cm(-2) at a temperature of 120 degrees C and pressure of 2.5 bar. The major factors for cell performances are rationalized in terms of over potentials, water flow rates and thickness of diffusion layers, based on polarization behavior and ac-impedance response.

This energy-intensive process is detrimental to the environment due to the dependence on fossil fuels and the emission of significant greenhouse gases (such as CO2). Ammonia production via the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (ENRR) has been recognized as a green sustainable alternative to the Haber-Bosch process in recent years. Current ENRR research mainly focuses on the catalyst for ammonia selective production and the enhancement of faradaic efficiency at high current density; however, these have not been explored well due to the unavailability of highly efficient and cheap catalysts. Herein, this review provides information on the ENRR process along with (i) theoretical background, (ii) experimental methodology of the electrocatalytic process and (iii) computational screening of promising catalysts. The impact of active sites and defects on the activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalysts is deeply understood. Furthermore, we demonstrate the mechanistic understanding of the ENRR process on the surface of catalysts, with the aim of boosting the improvement of the ENRR activities. The ammonia detection methods are also summarized along with thorough discussion of control experiments. Finally, this review highlights prevailing problems in existing ENRR methods of ammonia production along with technical advancements proposed to address these issues and concludes with comments on opportunities and future directions of the ENRR process.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000670553600001	34235522

We herein report a systematic study regarding the stability of catalysts anchored on an indium tin oxide (ITO) support via different acid functional groups at the ligand backbone: viz., a single carboxylate anchor, two carboxylate anchors, and a phosphonate anchor. The integrity of the hybrid electrodes ITO vertical bar mesoITO vertical bar catalyst was evaluated under acidic aqueous conditions as a function of the applied electric potential below and above the onset of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) experiments allowed us to distinguish between the water oxidation and the desorption processes. X-ray photoemission (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) after electrochemical treatment showed high chemical stability of the catalyst core structure but pronounced dependence of the hybrid stability on the oxidation state of the ruthenium center. A combination of these different spectroscopic techniques shed light on the mechanisms underlying catalyst desorption. Specifically, catalysts equipped with carboxylate anchors are found to continuously desorb already at low applied potentials below the OER onset, while for the more rugged phosphonate-based hybrid oxidative P-C(aryl) bond cleavage is proposed to occur, but only after reaching the high-valent (RuRuIV)-Ru-V state. These findings reveal specific challenges for anchoring strategies in molecular water oxidation catalysis.									13	2	0	0	1	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000410005700077

Such technologies have the potential to reduce anthropogenic CO2 emissions by adding value to a waste stream, whilst also reducing our consumption of fossil fuels. Current thermal catalytic technologies available for CO and CO2 hydrogenation are demanding in terms of energy input. Various alternative technologies are now being developed for COx hydrogenation, with solar-driven processes over twodimensional (2D) and 2D-related composite materials being particularly attractive due to the abundance of solar energy on Earth and also the high selectivity of defect-engineered 2D materials towards specific valuable products under very mild reaction conditions. This review showcases recent advances in the solar-driven COx reduction to hydrocarbons over 2D-based materials. Optimization of 2D catalyst performance demands interdisciplinary research that embraces catalyst electronic structure manipulation and morphology control, surface/interface engineering, reactor engineering and density functional theory modelling studies. Through improved understanding of the structure-performance relationships in 2D-related catalysts which is achievable through the application of modern in situ characterization techniques, practical photo/photothermal/photoelectrochemical technologies for CO and CO2 reduction to high-valuable products such as olefins could be realized in the not-too-distant future.									246	25	0	0	25	0	247			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000464383500012	30357195

Mutants defective in each of these enzymes in Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 were constructed and characterized. Activities of the corresponding enzymes in the selected mutants were virtually undetectable, and their ability to synthesize glycogen was entirely abolished. The maximal activities of photosynthetic O-2 evolution and the rates of respiration in the dark were significantly decreased in the mutants compared to those in wild-type cells. Addition of 0.2 M NaCl or 3 mM H2O2 to liquid cultures markedly inhibited the growth of the AGPase and GS mutants, while the same treatment had only marginal effects on the wild type. These results suggest a significant role for storage polysaccharides in tolerance to salt or oxidative stress.									79	5	0	0	74	0	89			0099-2240	1098-5336		WOS:000277388200010	20363800

These tradeoffs were evaluated quantitatively using an advanced photoelectrochemical device model comprised of an analytical device physics model for the semiconducting light absorbers in combination with a multi-physics device model that solved for the governing conservation equations in the various other parts of the system. The model was used to evaluate the variation in system efficiency due to hourly and seasonal variations in solar irradiation as well as due to variation in the isothermal system temperature. The system performance characteristics were also evaluated as a function of the band gaps of the dual-absorber tandem component and its properties, as well as the device dimensions and the electrolyte conductivity. The modeling indicated that the system efficiency varied significantly during the day and over a year, exhibiting local minima at midday and a global minimum at midyear when the solar irradiation is most intense. These variations can be reduced by a favorable choice of the system dimensions, by a reduction in the electrolyte ohmic resistances, and/or by utilization of very active electrocatalysts for the fuel-producing reactions. An increase in the system temperature decreased the annual average efficiency and led to less rapid ramp-up and ramp-down phases of the system, but reduced midday and midyear instantaneous efficiency variations. Careful choice of the system dimensions resulted in minimal change in the system efficiency in response to degradation in the quality of the light absorbing materials. The daily and annually averaged mass of hydrogen production for the optimized integrated system compared favorably to the daily and annually averaged mass of hydrogen that was produced by an optimized stand-alone tandem photovoltaic array connected electrically to a stand-alone electrolyzer system. The model can be used to predict the performance of the system, to optimize the design of solar-driven water splitting devices, and to guide the development of components of the devices as well as of the system as a whole.									133	2	0	0	7	0	134			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000327250300021

Before mixture, the storage catalysts (BaO/CeO2) were treated at 800degC for 5 h in a steam and CO2-containing air. The storage catalysts were characterized in detail by X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption-desorption, energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Results show highest Ba dispersion on CeO2 for 3BC sample. 5BC sample forms large BaCO3 particle leading to lower Ba dispersion than 3BC sample. NOx storage capacity was investigated in steady-state and transient NO/O2 adsorption reactions in the temperature range from 100degC to 300degC. As BaO loading increases, the PA-BC catalysts exhibit nonlinear enhancement for NOx storage capacity (NSC) compared with PA-Ce sample. And PA-3BC sample possesses superior NOx storage capacity. The evolution and stability of NOx adsorbed species at 100degC were explored by in situ DRITFS. DRIFTS results show that PA-3BC and PA-5BC samples present obviously different NOx adsorbed species from PA-Ce sample. Besides, nitrate formation is more facilitated for PA-3BC sample compared with the PA-5BC sample. These results can be contributed to high Ba dispersion on CeO2, which is advantageous to Ba-Ce contact and NOx trapping. And the Ba sites in intimate contact with CeO2 can effectively utilize the Ba sites and oxygen from CeO2 to form nitrates at low temperature, which possess higher stability than Ce nitrates.

The performance of transition metal (oxy) nitrides in solar water splitting is strongly influenced by the crystal structure-related dynamics of photogenerated charge carriers. Here, we have systematically assessed the influence of A-site cation exchange on the visible-light-induced photocatalytic H-2 and O-2 evolution activities, photoanodic response, and dynamics of photogenerated charge carriers of perovskite-type LnTaON(2) (Ln = La and Pr). The structural refinement results reveal the orthorhombic Imma and Pnma structures for LaTaON2 and PrTaON2, respectively; the latter has a more distorted crystal structure from the ideal cubic perovskite due to the smaller size of Pr3+ cations. Compared with LaTaON2, PrTaON2 exhibits lower photocatalytic H-2 and O-2 gas evolution activities and photoanodic response owing to an excessive amount of intrinsic defects associated with anionic vacancies and reduced tantalum species stemming from a long high-temperature nitridation process under reductive NH3 atmosphere. Transient absorption signals evidence the faster decay of photogenerated electrons (holes) in Pt (CoOx)-loaded LaTaON2 than that in Pt (CoOx)-loaded PrTaON2, consistent with the photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical performance of the two photocatalysts. This study suggests that in addition to selecting a suitable A-site cation, it is prerequisite to synthesize LnTaON(2) (Ln = La and Pr) crystals with a low defect density to improve their photo-conversion efficiency for solar water splitting.									32	0	0	0	0	0	32			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000408257700032	28799586

Since the bond between the fiber and matrix is relatively poor, anodic oxidation was conducted by applying various voltages to enhance the interfacial interactions. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to investigate the chemical reaction process during the electrochemical fiber modification. Scanning electron microscopy showed the removal of contaminations and impurities from the fiber surfaces by anodization. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) analysis was performed to compare the heat resistance properties of the CF reinforced composites and single-fiber tension tests were carried out to evaluate the influence of the electrochemical treatment on the fiber's properties. Single fiber pullout tests and energy dispersive X-ray mapping indicated a remarkable improvement of compatibility between the modified fibers and the matrix, since chemical bonds are formed between oxygen-related functional groups from the anodized fiber surfaces and the alkaliactivated matrix. With the addition of 1 wt.% rCFs compressive and flexural strengths have been enhanced by up to 25% and 19%, respectively, compared to the plain composites. The results reveal that electrochemical surface treatment of rCFs is beneficial for enhancing the flexural behavior of rCF-reinforced composite owing to enhanced interfacial bonding. However, this method also provokes a slight increase of porosity compared with untreated fiber-reinforced samples, as proved by mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP). This study provides a promising utilization of rCF in the production of waste-based fiber-reinforced alkali-activated composites, promoting the management of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic waste.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0959-6526	1879-1786		WOS:000835981000006

Numerical simulations with a detailed H-2/air reaction and theoretical shock polar analyses are combined to study the influence mechanism of a complex wave system structure on the characteristics of the oblique detonation. The effects of expansion waves on the oblique detonation waves (ODWs) and their flow field characteristics for different equivalent ratios and geometric sizes are analyzed in single-wedge and double-wedge structures with the same inflow parameters. The results show that the length of the induced ODW is shorter in the double-wedge structure than in the single-wedge structure. For the single wedge structure, the strength of the expansion wave increases, the wall temperature drops, and the characteristic length of the induction zone decreases with increasing deflection angle of the second wedge. If the strength of the expansion wave is sufficiently large, the ODW is initiated. For the double-wedge structure, the ODWs interact and form a complex wave system structure, consisting of a Mach stem, two reflected detonation waves and slip lines. The length and the temperature before and after the Mach stem decrease with an increase in the strength of the expansion waves. The effects of the expansion waves on the flow field of the ODW are relatively small at a large equivalent ratio and significantly larger at a small equivalent ratio.

Antarctic ureilite Asuka (A) 09368 and H chondrites A 09004 and A 09502 exhibit well preserved thick fusion crusts, characterized by extensive olivine crystallization. As olivine is one of the major components of most meteorites and its petrologic behavior is well constrained, it can be roughly considered as representative for the bulk meteorite. Thus, in this work, the evolution of olivine in fusion crusts of the above-listed selected samples is investigated. The different shape and chemistry of olivine crystallized in the fusion crust, both as overgrown rim on relic olivine clasts and as new crystals, suggest a general temperature and cooling rate gradient. The occurrence of reverse and oscillatory zoning in individual olivine grains within the fusion crust suggests complex redox reactions. Overall, the investigated fusion crusts exhibit a general oxidation of the relatively reduced initial material. However, evidence of local reduction is preserved. Reduction is likely triggered by the presence of carbon in the ureilite or by overheating during the atmospheric entry. Constraining these processes provides a potential analog for interpreting features observed in cosmic spherules and micrometeorites and for calibrating experiments and numerical models on the formation of fusion crusts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1086-9379	1945-5100		WOS:000478847500010	31423075

The thermal stability, crystallinity, and purity of the materials depended on the Cu/Al atomic ratio. The FT-IR and TG detected carbonate (mainly) and nitrate as counteranions which interact in the interlayer region. We found loosely bound carbonate and nitrate anions and one strongly bound type of carbonate. We used dynamic XRD experiments to study the evolution of phases during calcination. All the samples after calcination showed well-dispersed CuO and/or CuAl2O4 phases. We also tested their catalytic behaviour for the oxidation of 5 g/l phenol aqueous solutions using a triphasic tubular reactor working in a trickle-bed regime and air with an oxygen partial pressure of 0.9 MPa at a temperature reaction of 413 K. Phenol conversion decreased continuously over time for the samples calcined at lower temperatures (673 K). This is because of continuous loss of the CuO phase by elution and the formation of a new phase like copper oxalate on the surface of the copper catalysts which also elutes with time XRD shows that samples calcined at higher temperatures (1073 K) and after HCl treatment (0.1 M) to avoid the CuO phase, have a pure copper aluminate phase. This CuAl2O4 phase reaches steady activity plateaus in the 55-65% range of phenol conversion. The triphasic tubular reactor using trickle-bed regime largely avoids polymer formation as a catalyst-deactivation process.

The ascorbate system involves a (MnMnIV)-Mn-III-ascorbate complex (e = 1.4 X 10(2) M(-1) at 23 degrees C) and exhibits k(limiting) = 8.8 X 10(2) s(-1) in H2O and 2.2 X 10(2) s(-1) in D2O for the initial redox act which, in this case, is rate-determining. Complex decay profiles generated by the reactions of hydroquinone and HSO3- are in accord with multistep processes in which the intermediate Mn states and the radicals derived from the reductant (semiquinone and SO3.(-)) participate. The resulting patterns are autocatalytic in nature, with the active catalytic species appearing to be the (Mn-III)2 intermediate. Solvent kinetic isotope effects, (k(H2O)/ k(D2O)) observed when solvent H2O is replaced by D2O, lie near 4.0 for the ascorbate reduction and for the initial step in the hydroquinone reduction but approach unity for the bisulfite reduction, pointing to coupled electron and proton transfers by the organic reductants but not by HSO3-. Plots of k(obsd) VS mole fraction D2O are very nearly linear for the reduction by ascorbate, indicating that, in this case,just one proton is transferred in the rate-determining step.									58	0	0	0	2	0	58			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:A1994MQ80900014

Catalysts with a core-shell structure for water dissociation have been extensively investigated. However, most of them are nanoparticles and thus their catalytic properties are inevitably limited by the use of binders in practice. Herein, this work reports a physical-metallurgy-based structural design strategy to develop a self-supported and unique nanoporous structure with core-shell-like ligaments, i.e., a Cu core surrounded by a NiO shell, formed on a metallic glass (MG) substrate. These newly developed noble metal-free catalysts exhibit outstanding HER performance; the overpotential reaches 67 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), accompanied by a low Tafel slope of 40 mV dec(-1) and good durability. More importantly, the current strategy could be readily applied to fabricate other nanoporous metals, which opens a new space for designing advanced catalysts as cost-effective electrode materials.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000715504900001	34749392

However, in contrast with its excellent HER performance, its poor OER performance often limits practical application as a high-performance overall water splitting catalyst. In this study, Prussian blue analogue (PBA) is grown in-situ on molybdenum-based nanosheet spheres by a simple and ingenious method and then subjected to phosphorization. The resulting composite catalyst exhibits highly efficient overall water splitting performance, overpotentials at current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2) for the HER and OER are -61 mV and 268 mV, respectively. Moreover, an alkaline electrolyzer makes up by the catalyst both as positive and negative can reach a cell voltage 1.494 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for the overall water splitting. This method has provided a new strategy to effective combine PBA and molybdenum-based catalyst. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The generation of O-2(center dot-) anion radicals was monitored by the reaction with Nitro Blue Tetrazolium chloride (NBT), while the formation of center dot OH was controlled by transformation of terephthalic acid into fluorescent 2-hydroxyterephtalic acid. The band diagram of BiVO4 was constructed on the base of the E-fb determined from the measurements of open circuit potential (OCP) and photocurrent onset potential, and the mechanism of photodegradation of caffeine (CAF) on BiVO4 was proposed. It was shown that the photodegradation rate constant of CAF may be increased from 2.1.10(-3) to 4.610(-3) min(-1) by modification of BiVO4 surface with cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) co-catalyst. The presence of Co-Pi resulted in the increase of the electron life-time and suppression of the electron-hole recombination in BiVO4. The 26-fold increase of the degradation rate constant, to the value 5.5.10(-2) min(-1), was achieved by application of an external potential of 0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl to the BiVO4 electrode and the mechanism of photoelectrocatalytic process was proposed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000868476600004

In this study, graphitic carbon nitride (gC3N4) with C vacancies enabling more C-NHx exposure (HTCN) was synthesized and used to study the effect of organic pollutant adsorption on photocatalytic properties. The exposure of C-NHx distinctly separates the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of HTCN and avoids the competitive adsorption between O2 and organic pollutants on the HTCN surface, facilitating the generation of O2 center dot- and direct pollutant oxidation by h+. More importantly, the pollutants exactly adsorbed on the HOMO distribution area of HTCN derived from C vacancies further regulate the energy band structure by spontaneous electron transfer, which promotes more electrons to be captured by O2 for O2 center dot- generation and high-performance degradation of pollutants.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2690-0645		WOS:000824227400001

However, the mechanism by which the rejuvenator restores the performance of aged asphalt in the RAP binder remains an open question: research approaches are inadequate, and the details of asphalt aging are not clear. Here, we first revealed the aging mechanism of asphalt and obtained realistic structures of aged asphalt molecules by means of first-principles molecular simulations that modeled the chemical reaction between asphalt and oxygen. Subsequently, through classical modeling approaches that examine the solubility behaviors of asphalt molecules in n-heptane with and without a rejuvenator, we demonstrated the serious agglomeration of aged molecules, the transformation of aged resins into asphaltenes, and the restorative effect of the rejuvenator. To explore the driving force behind these findings, we performed density functional theory calculations and wavefunction analyses to determine the strength and nature of intermolecular interactions between asphalt molecules. The results indicated that the electrostatic interaction between aged asphalt molecules increases significantly upon generation of polar groups, and the rejuvenator decreases the electrostatic interaction mainly by eliminating hydrogen bonds, thus reducing molecular agglomeration, but has little effect on the dispersion force. Besides, Hansen solubility parameters were calculated to illustrate the agglomeration in aged asphalt and the restorative effect of the rejuvenator in terms of the "likedissolves-like" rule. This study bridges the gap between electronic-scale modeling and complex engineering practice related to the aging and rejuvenation of asphalt.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0959-6526	1879-1786		WOS:000730189500001

Herein, P- and N-codoped molybdenum disulfide (PNMoS2) nanosheets were fabricated via the original process of ball milling, followed by annealing, which subsequently served as the template to grow the two-dimensional (2D) cobalt borate (Co-Bi) ultrathin nanosheets for the generation of PNMoS2@Co-Bi dual sheets. With the introduction of 2 wt % PNMoS2@Co-Bi dual nanosheets into epoxy resin (EP), defined as EP/PNMoS2@Co-Bi, an obvious reduced peak heat release rate of 28.0% and a total heat release of 27.9%, respectively, were obtained. It is noted that the total smoke release, which is vital for evacuation and life safety, has been reduced by 41.8%. In addition, EP/PNMoS2@Co-Bi achieved a significantly improved LOI, UL-94, and thermal performance, along with the high char yield (22.9 wt %) and remarkably decreased mass loss rate. Interestingly, the loading of 2 wt % PNMoS2 has the lowest friction coefficient value (decrease by 18.7%) and volume wear rate (46.1% reduction than pure EP), which is attributed to the PNMoS2 nanosheets that can generate the uniform lubricating transfer layer. The outstanding properties of EP nanocomposites are attributed to the coupled effects between PNMoS2 and Co-Bi ultrathin sheets with an enhanced interface interaction in the EP matrix. This study manifests the extensive application of well-designed PNMoS2@Co-Bi nanohybrids in the fire safety and wear resistance of polymers.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2574-0970		WOS:000711030600052

The morphology, composition and catalytic properties of the as-prepared NCSAMF were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and electrochemical measurements. Nanoconical structures were generated under a voltage of 20 V for 15 min in the optimized electrolyte, and all the oxygen atoms in the nanoconical structure layer were removed under deoxidation at 650 degrees C for 3 h in a H-2 atmosphere while retaining the nanoconical structure and activity. Compared with the Mo foils treated under different conditions, the NCSAMFs exhibit superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity with a low onset overpotential of 123 mV and a Tafel slope of 96 mV dec(-1), indicating that the NCSAMFs possess high activity and outstanding long-term stability in acidic media. Therefore, the NCSAMFs prepared in this paper are promising transition metal HER electrocatalysts and serve as active matrix materials for Mo-based materials. In addition, the surface energies of the NCSAMF and the Mo foils without nanotreatment were calculated at the atomic and mesoscopic scales, respectively, to provide more insights into the origin of the studied process, and the calculation results demonstrate that the high activity of NCSAMFs is mainly derived from the increase in Mo crystal surface area with high surface energy caused by the nanotreatment and the corresponding increase in the amount of active sites.

However, this redox couple can irreversibly poison the electrode, potentially leading to unreliable results. There are alternatives such as the hexachloroiridate(IV)/hexachloroiridate(III), but relatively little is known about their stability. Therefore, we have investigated the stability of the hexachloroiridate redox couple and compared this to the stability of the hexacyanoferrate couple. Voltammetry confirms that the hexachloroiridate couple is reversible, with a clear limiting current density plateau for the reduction on both platinum and nickel. Diffusion coefficients for hexachloroiridate(IV) and hexachloroiridate(III) were determined to be respectively 8.38*10(-10) m(2)/s and 6.10*10(-10) m(2)/s. Chronoamperometric limiting current density experiments of 16 hat pH 4 show that the electrode is not poisoned. However, as evidenced by inline UV-VIS measurements the bulk concentration of hexachloroiridate(IV) decreases, which is probably due to a spontaneous reduction or hydroxylation reaction. UVVIS measurements of iridate solutions show that in more acidic solutions (pH 2-3) the degradation occurs more slowly, whereas at pH > 6 rapid hydroxylation of the complex occurs, making the couple unsuitable for mass transfer experiments at high pH. Experiments with hexayanoferrate show that that couple is more stable in solution, but that irreversible electrode poisoning cannot be avoided. Therefore, the hexachloroiridate couple seems especially suitable for testing electrode materials that are difficult to clean, such as three dimensional structures.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000593970300020

Two adjacent SORLIP1 elements (double SORLIP1, dSL) were found to be essential for HL induction of a GUS reporter gene. The dSL element was also found to be essential for HL induction conferred by the ELIP2 promoter. SORLIP1 elements were enriched in ELIP promoters throughout the plant kingdom, and showed a clade-specific pattern of gain or loss that suggested functionality. In addition, two G-box elements were found to redundantly contribute to HL induction conferred by the ELIP1 promoter.									9	0	0	0	8	0	10			0167-4412	1573-5028		WOS:000330980600002	24072326

Heterointerfaces affect the surface characteristics, electronic structure, and physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial. Herein, we report an FeP-CoP heterostructure prepared by simple physical mixing of FeP and CoP nanostructures showing a remarkable performance towards water oxidation in comparison to their individual monometallic phosphides. FeP mixed with 20 wt% CoP shows a low overpotential (eta(10)) of 220 mV as compared to FeP (eta(10), 325 mV). Furthermore, a high current density of 1.37 A cm(-2) and mass activity of 18 987 A g(M)(-1) were also achieved at 500 mV overpotential in 1.0 M KOH. The physical mixture shows immense stability for 200 h to achieve a high current density of 200 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile the potentiostatic performance of FeP at 200 mA cm(-2) decreases to an extent of 50% in 40 h. A full cell arrangement employing this catalyst as the anode material requires 1.56 V to attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Various characterization techniques, control experiments and theoretical studies indicate that the formation of heterointerfaces between the nano-domains of FeP and CoP results in charge transfer between Fe and Co metal sites. In addition, an oxygenated surface at the metal phosphide interface favours the sorption kinetics of intermediates involved in the reaction leading to low energy barriers in the potential determining and other steps, thus showing improved performance towards water oxidation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000871607300001

Although much progress has been achieved, the development of better CDI technologies, especially through the design and synthesis of various porous carbonaceous materials with enhanced CDI performance, continues to attract increasing interest within the scientific fraternity. Considering that previous traditional porous carbons might suffer from deficient salt adsorption capacity, the nitrogenization of porous carbons, which brings new opportunities for CDI applications, has emerged as an effective strategy to modify the surface characteristics of porous carbons and ultimately improve their CDI performance. This review summarizes the recent significant breakthroughs on the construction of NCs, including in situ doping and post-treatment strategies, and their practices in the field of CDI to impart a comprehensive understanding of the strategic evolution of the synthetic approaches to nitrogen-doped carbons (NCs) with remarkable CDI characteristics. We present an exhaustive analysis of newly synthesized NCs and the impact of their compositional and structural features on their CDI performance; further, we highlight a special emphasis on the possible role of nitrogen dopants in the CDI process. In addition to elucidating the state-of-the-art CDI applications, we address the remaining challenges, and finally, the possible direction for the use of NCs for CDI is described to provide some useful clues for future developments in this promising field.									33	0	0	0	3	0	33			2589-7780			WOS:000646909100004		
J	Raven, Madeleine J.; Dickson, Tony								Methanogenesis during Shu'aiba diagenesis: examples from Al Shaheen Field, Block 5, offshore Qatar								GEOARABIA				12	1			37	58						2007	2007	Evidence has been found for the involvement of bacterial methanogenic processes in the diagenesis of late Early Aptian Shu'aiba Formation sedimentary rocks from Block 5, offshore Qatar. This is in the form of delta C-13 values significantly higher than the presumed late Early Aptian marine signal. High delta C-13 values were recorded in early-formed inclusion-rich calcite that represents neomorphosed aragonite/marine cement (+6.6 parts per thousand) and the latest precipitated blocky non-ferroan calcite cement (+8.9 parts per thousand). Oxygen-isotope data suggest that the later methanogenic episode occurred during burial. In bulk rock samples from another well, delta C-13 values of +6.5 to +11.5 parts per thousand were determined from a 10 ft thick zone located 4 ft below the top of the Shu'aiba. In other wells for which data were available the equivalent interval of the Shu'aiba was characterised by expected marine delta C-13 values. Finally, delta C-13 values up to +9.1 parts per thousand were recorded in a localised area of dolomite replacement immediately beneath the Top Shu'aiba surface, which can be dated to after the onset of Nahr Umr Formation deposition. These are the first reported examples of methanogenic reactions affecting the Shu'aiba Formation and provide new insight into the diagenesis of this formation, which is often assumed to be dominated by meteoric processes. The evidence presented for the resetting of the carbon-isotope composition of the bulk rock has implications for the application of carbon-isotope stratigraphy to the Shu'aiba Formation.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1025-6059			WOS:000243762300002

In this work, four CCM processes, doctor blade, decal, electrostatic spraying, and modified pneumatic spraying methods, were employed for fabricating dehumidifier assemblies with low-load (0.6 mg/cm(2)) IrO2 catalyst layers (CLs). The physical and electrochemical properties of the as-prepared CLs were characterized, and the mass transfer resistance and dehumidification rate of the MEA were tested during actual operations. The optimal hot-pressing parameters were also determined. Results showed that the modified pneumatic spraying method can significantly improve the pore distribution and CL flatness by promoting the evaporation of solvent from catalyst slurry. The charge-transfer and ohmic resistances of MEA was 25.3 and 27.8 m omega/cm(2), respectively, which are the best values for those prepared using the four methods. The dehumidification rate was also the highest (0.105 g/h), 20-40% higher than that of other methods. Although the overall mass transfer resistance of assembly prepared by the electrostatic spraying was low, the CL structure was obviously loose and unable to bind to the membrane surface tightly, leading to high electrochemical resistance (6.6-fold that of pneumatic spray method). Besides, catalyst particles tend to agglomerate using the doctor blade method. The pore size of the CL prepared using the decal method was found to be too small (<300 nm), hindering reactant transfer and resulting in a low overall mass transfer coefficient. This study provides a practical direction for the preparation of economical and high-performance dehumidifiers or electrolyzers.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1543-5075	1543-5083		WOS:000860056100001

It is initiated by photosystem II (PSII), an enzyme that extracts electrons from H2O and feeds them into an electron-transport chain to result in chemical synthesis using the input of solar energy. PSII can be immobilized onto electrodes for photoelectrochemical studies, in which electrons photogenerated from PSII are harnessed for enzyme characterization, and to drive fuel-forming reactions by electrochemically coupling the PSII to a suitable (bio)catalyst. Research in PSII photoelectrochemistry has recently made substantial strides in electrode design and unravelling charge-transfer pathways at the bio-material interface. In turn, these efforts have opened up possibilities in the field of bio-photoelectrochemistry, expanding the range of biocatalysts that can be systematically interrogated, including biofilms of whole photosynthetic cells. Furthermore, these studies have accelerated the development of semi-artificial photosynthesis to afford autonomous, solar-driven, fuel-forming biohybrid devices. This Review summarizes the latest advancements in PSII photoelectrochemistry with respect to electrode design and understanding of the bio-material interface, on both the protein and cellular level.

In this study, an inexpensive 3D electrode of Ni3S2@Ni foam was obtained through a hydrothermal condition using sodium sulfide as corrodent and Ni foam as both substrate and Ni source. The formation mechanism of this Ni3S2 layer was studied through a process analysis based on physical chemistry with assistant of the results from characterizations. The obtained Ni3S2@Ni foam was used as electrode to test its hydrazine electro-oxidation properties in terms of DHFCs and electrochemical sensor. It is found Ni3S2@Ni foam possesses the ability to electro-oxidize hydrazine and Ni3S2 layer leads to increased activity including lower onset potential and higher current. In the aspect of hydrazine electrochemical sensor, the fabricated Ni3S2 layer leads to increased sensitivity and dynamic response property. The results indicate that as-prepared Ni3S2@Ni foam possesses a potential for practical application in hydrazine electro-oxidation, and Ni3S2 is a very promising substitute material for noble metals in hydrazine electro-oxidation. At the same time, with the characterization of the as-prepared Ni3S2@Ni foam electrode on structure, morphology and surface chemical states, the mechanism of the corrosion method as well as enhanced properties were investigated.

In this study we have investigated the kinetic parameters for depositing Fe and Pd and their influence on the Fe-Pd alloy's composition, while performing the deposition on a flat Au electrode and into an Au-sputtered porous alumina template. The electrodeposition of Fe and Pd was found to be irreversible and diffusion-controlled. Diffusion coefficients and charge-transfer coefficients were determined by cyclic voltammetry. The exchange current densities for both metallic ions in the porous alumina template and on the flat electrode were determined via a Butler-Volmer analysis. The diffusion coefficient was found to be lower for both metallic ions, by 2-3 times, when the template was used as a working electrode. Due to the hydrogen evolution overlapping with the reduction of the Fe2+, the kinetics of the Fe and of the Pd deposition was calculated using the Butler-Volmer model. We found that the exchange current densities, i.e., the rate of the deposition reaction, are comparable for Fe2+ and Pd2+ on both working electrodes. This indicates that the kinetics of the electrodeposition process is not influenced by the electrode geometry. Because of similar diffusion-coefficient ratios and similar kinetics on both the investigated working electrodes, using the same deposition conditions (i.e., solution and applied potential) results in Fe-Pd-based thin films and nanowires having similar compositions.

The Sun is a source of silent and precious energy that is distributed fairly all over the Earth daily. However, its tremendous potential as a clean, safe, and economical energy source cannot be exploited unless the energy is accumulated or converted into more useful forms. The conversion of solar energy into hydrogen via the water-splitting process, assisted by photo-semiconductor catalysts, is one of the most promising technologies for the future because large quantities of hydrogen can potentially be generated in a clean and sustainable manner. This Minireview provides an overview of the principles, approaches, and research progress on solar hydrogen production via the water-splitting reaction on photo-semiconductor catalysts. It presents a survey of the advances made over the last decades in the development of catalysts for photochemical water splitting under visible-light irradiation. The Minireview also analyzes the energy requirements and main factors that determine the activity of photocatalysts in the conversion of water into hydrogen and oxygen using sunlight. Remarkable progress has been made since the pioneering work by Fujishima and Honda in 1972, but he development of photocatalysts with improved efficiencies for hydrogen production from water using solar energy still faces major challenges. Research strategies and approaches adopted in the search for active and efficient photocatalysts, for example through new materials and synthesis methods, are presented and analyzed.									429	20	0	0	19	0	434			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000267729400002	19536754	
J	Hendry, G; Wydrzynski, T								O-18 isotope exchange measurements reveal that calcium is involved in the binding of one substrate-water molecule to the oxygen-evolving complex in photosystem II								BIOCHEMISTRY				42	20			6209	6217		10.1021/bi034279i				MAY 27 2003	2003	Direct evidence is presented to show that calcium is inherently involved in the binding of one of the two substrate-water molecules to the oxygen-evolving complex in photosystem II. Previous rapid (millisecond range) O-18 isotope exchange measurements between added (H2O)-O-18 and the photogenerated O-2 have shown that the two substrate-water molecules bind to separate sites throughout the S-state cycle, as revealed by their kinetically distinct rates of O-18 exchange [Hillier, W., and Wydrzynski, T. (2000) Biochemistry; 39, 4399-4405]. Upon extraction of the functionally bound calcium using a either a low-pH/citrate treatment or a NaCl/A23187/EGTA treatment and subsequent reconstitution of activity with strontium, we show for the first time a specific increase in the slow rate of O-18 exchange by a factor of 3-4. This increase in the slow rate of exchange is consistently observed across the S-1, S-2, and S-3 states. In contrast, the fast phase of O-18 exchange in the S-3 state appears to be affected little upon strontium reconstitution, while the fast phases of exchange in the S-1 and S-2 states remain largely unresolvable, at the detectable limits of the current techniques. The results are discussed in terms of a possible substrate bridging structure between the functional calcium and a catalytic manganese ion that gives rise to the slowly exchanging component.									108	2	0	0	53	0	108			0006-2960			WOS:000183024200027	12755624

The structure measurements indicate that all of the Gd(0.90)A(0.10)MnO(3 )(A = Ca, Sr, Ba) samples show a single phase structure, and the introduction of A(2+) ion induces structure distortion. A(2+) ions substitution increases the Mn4+ ion concentration in GMOs, but has no significant effect on the oxygen vacancy concentration. All samples with irregular grain shapes have dense microstructures, and A(2+) ion substitution inhibits grain growth. Positron annihilation experimental results indicate that A(2+) ion substitution can increase the vacancy size and concentration, while the vacancy concentration increases first and then decreases with increasing A(2+) ion radius. The evolution of the temperature- and magnetic field-dependent magnetization curves shows that A(2+) ion substitution could obviously affect the magnetic state of GMOs, and improve the magnetic transition temperature and magnetization of Gd(0.90)A(0.10)MnO(3). The dielectric measurements reveal that the A(2+) ion substituted samples exhibit giant dielectric constant characteristics over a broad frequency range. It is found that the enhanced magnetization of Gd(0.90)A(0.10)MnO(3) has a close relationship with the vacancy concentration, and the giant dielectric constant behaviors in Gd(0.90)A(0.10)MnO(3) ceramics can be associated with the mixed-valent structure of Mn3+/Mn4+.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000869661800001

Herein, alpha-Fe2O3 was prepared by a hydrothermal process and the precursor concentration, calcination temperature and hydrothermal time were optimized. The Co-Pi groups were deposited on the surface by two-step dipping process. The preparation conditions and loading capacity of CoPi were optimized. SEM showed that the morphology of alpha-Fe2O3 was short nanorods. XPS indicated that CoPi was successfully deposited on the surface of Fe2O3. TEM and XRD showed that CoPi was amorphous. The photocurrent density of Fe2O3/CoPi increased to 1.95 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE, which was 1.91 times that of bare Fe2O3. After CoPi modification, the initial potential shifted negatively by 70 mV. It could be inferred that CoPi acted as an effective water oxidation co-catalyst to reduce the activation energy of the oxygen evolution reaction. The chopping I-t curve showed that the transient anodic spike of Fe2O3 decreased after CoPi deposition. This indicated that CoPi acted as a hole extractor and redox mediator to reduce the charge accumulation on the Fe2O3 surface. Through calculation, the ABPE of Fe2O3/Co-Pi was 2.1 times that of Fe2O3. The charge injection efficiency of Fe2O3/Co-Pi at 1.23 V-RHE was 1.6 times that of Fe2O3. This study presented a richer understanding on the functions and promotional effects of the preparation conditions and CoPi groups for Fe2O3 photoanodes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000727439900001

However, integrating foreign species into anion vacancy defect electrocatalysts, and investigating their interfacial electron structure and synergistic catalytic effect are still somewhat controversial. Herein, Fe2O3/ NiSe2 and Fe2O3/Ni3S2 heterostructures catalysts with abundant anion defects (Se, S) were constructed through an efficient spatial combination of primary hydroxide nanosheets. The Fe2O3/NiSe2 and Fe2O3/Ni3S2 catalysts exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic activities, as shown by the overpotentials of 200 mV at 100 mA cm-2 for OER, and 60 mV at 10 mA cm-2 for HER, respectively. The Fe2O3/NiSe2 (anode)?Fe2O3/Ni3S2 (cathode) device accelerated water splitting at 1.54 V with 10 mA cm-2, surpassing the integrated couple of Pt and Ir-based oxide (1.57 V). The chemical valence state, combined with DFT calculations, revealed that interface engineering and anion defects could modulate the electronic structures of the Fe2O3 modified NiSe2 and Ni3S2 catalysts, reduce the energy barrier of intermediate, and therefore dramatically improve their catalytic performances. This work not only presents a universal strategy for the construction of active and durable electrocatalyst with abundant anion defects, but also provides a new way for the rational design of novel nanostructure for electrocatalytic applications.									13	1	0	0	0	0	14			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000661105400036

In this respect, the triple-layered perovskite RbSr2Nb3O10 shows promising photocatalytic properties and have the potential to be used in photocatalytic water splitting and degradation of pollutants. Herein, we have investigated the mechanical stability, electronic and optical properties, and redox potential of RbSr2Nb3O10 by using a first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The investigated elastic properties reveal that the perovskite RbSr2Nb3O10 is mechanically stable and elastically anisotropic. The studied electronic band structure confirms that the material RbSr2Nb3O10 is a semiconductor with indirect bandgap energy having the band gap value of 2.37 eV. The calculated low values of electron and hole effective masses suggest that the considered material have better electrical conductivity compared to other conventional semiconductors. The narrow bandgap and the small carrier effective mass of hole support the strong oxidation ability, which is favourable for the migration of charge carriers to the surface to facilitate the photocatalytic reaction. The suitable band edge potential indicates that electron-hole pairs are created upon photon absorption suggesting the material has the ability to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. The optical property investigation indicates the directional variation of the bandgap and other properties. Furthermore, the significant optical anisotropy along different polarization directions ascribed the lowering of crystal symmetry. Therefore, it is expected that our findings can be useful to develop high-performance photocatalytic device for water splitting and decompose of environmental pollutants. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Innovative researches on new versatile electrode materials are the foundation for the development of neoteric high-performance electrochemical energy-storage devices. Electrode materials with nanoscale size as well as unique morphologies often provide higher theoretical specific capacities than bulk materials. To date, salt powder assisted synthetic methods have been continuously investigated. This review reinforces our understanding of solid salt assisted synthetic methods to make them more sufficient and systematic, which promotes their widespread development and application, especially in the synthesis of nanostructured materials for electrochemical energy storage devices. This work reviews recent scientific advances involving solid salts as functional assistant for the preparations of nanostructured materials with high porosity, as well as their applications in electrochemical energy storage devices. Furthermore, this review highlights that the optimization of the precursors as well as careful choice of salt is needed to fabricate such nanomaterials successfully. Finally, we present a vision for the future development of optimal electrochemical energy storage devices with excellent performances derived from their unique nanostructures with the assistance of solid salts which possess infinite possibilities.									11	1	0	0	0	0	12			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000569319600006

The overall water splitting includes two half-reactions, i.e., water reduction and water oxidation, in which the latter is a speed-limiting step because of its multiproton-coupled four-electron process. It is highly desirable to improve the efficiency of the prevailing photoelectrochemical (PEC) anodes. We constructed an integrated BiVO4 photoanode modified with a hybrid structure of COAL-layered double hydroxides (LDHs) and graphene (G), i.e., G@LDI-I@BiVO4. This triadic photoanode exhibited a remarkably enhanced performance toward PEC water oxidation, compared to LDH@BiVO4 and pristine BiVO4. The photocurrent density of G@LDH@BiVO4 achieved 2.13 mA.cm(-2) (at 1.23 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE), 4 times higher than that of pristine BiVO4. The oxidation efficiency is as high as 80% even at a low bias (<0.8 V vs RHE). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of COLDH@BiVO4 reaches 52% at 400 nm, 2.5 times higher than that of BiVO4. The photoconversion efficiency peaked at 0.55% at a bias of 0.72 V, a 25-fold increase over that of BiVO4. The findings indicated that the improvenient of charge separation efficiency is mainly ascribed to graphene. The enhanced Charge transfer efficiency is a consequence of the synergy of graphene and an LDH, where the LDH is capable of expediting water oxidation kinetics and graphene promotes phdtogenerated charge transfer.									59	1	0	0	9	0	60			0888-5885			WOS:000412043400018

The HTlcs phase Co-Al precursors were prepared by coprecipitation method and Pd active species were introduced by different approaches, i.e., impregnation (IMP), wet ion exchange (WIE) or directly at coprecipitation stage (COP). It is found that all hydrotalcitederived Pd/CO3AlO catalysts are much more active than the Pd/CO3AlO catalyst prepared via traditional thermal combustion method (TCB) in toluene elimination. The activities of all synthesized catalysts obey the following sequence: Pd/CO3AlO (COP) > Pd/CO3AlO (WIE) >= Pd/CO3AlO (IMP) > Pd/CO3AlO (TCB). Excellent catalytic activities of the novel hydrotalicite-derived Pd/CO3AlO catalysts could be contributed to their high surface area, small mean crystallized size of support and highly dispersed PdO particles. Besides, they are well positively associated with catalyst reducibilities and the amounts of oxygen vacancies. According to the XPS. TEM and TPR results, it was found that the strong synergistic effect between Co3O4 and PdO, but not the amount of the surface palladium species which are generally believed to be the active sites, is the main factors determining the catalytic activity in this work. The stability tests indicate that all Pd/CO3AlO catalysts have no obvious deactivation, and some catalysts even show improved activities during the reaction process due to the emergence of metal Pd.

Understanding why it is so requires to open the question in a cosmological perspective After the Big Bang, and for at least 300 000 years, the Universe was nearly uniform, and had a very simple chemical composition formed during the hot phase of the Big Bang: only hydrogen helium and traces of other light elements, deuterium, He-3, and Li-7. This composition is known as "primordial". At a later time, about one or two billion years after the Big Bang, condensations developped at all scales, the smallest ones being stars. The most massive stars, reaching very high temperatures at their center, transformed their initial composition by thermonuclear reactions, producing all common elements observed in the solar system, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, etc. These elements were dispersed into the interstellar medium by mass-ejection at the final stage of evolution of these massive stars, and recycled by subsequent generations of stars. The first stars mast have been formed with the primordial composition. whereas Inter generations had an increasing proportion of elements produced by stellar nucleosynthesis. Intensive searches of stars with no, or very little elements produced by stellar nucleosynthesis have been performed during the last 20 years. Actually more than 100 stars were discovered with a very low proportion of such elements, one thousandth of the proportion in the (in which they amount to about 1.7% by mass), or less. But no star was found with less than 1/10,000 of the solar proportion. So no "primordial" star has been observed vet. The reason why is still an open question.

A differential how reactor was employed to perform kinetic tests. The progress of the catalytic combustion process was followed measuring the concentrations of carbon oxides in the product stream at the reactor outlet with an-line NDIR analyzers. Experimental results conform to those obtained while operating at relatively low values of R-m for what concerns the influence of oxygen partial pressure and temperature. Furthermore, burn-off temperatures in the presence of the catalyst were lowered by ca. 300 K, and, correspondingly, the apparent activation energy for the catalytic oxidation was found to be less than half with respect to the uncatalyzed combustion.A strong influence of R-m on the evolution with time of the combustion process was experienced. Specifically, time profiles of reactivity obtained when R-m was higher than 0.1 show a maximum whose amplitude increases as R-m increases. This behavior was related to the segregation of a more-or-less large fraction of the total carbon. Following such findings, a kinetic model for carbon catalytic oxidation was proposed. It is based on the assumption that different carbon portions enter the reaction zone at different times. Model parameters were estimated by a numerical code properly adapted. A good agreement between model predictions and experimental results was found for all R-m values.					26th International Symposium on Combustion26th International Symposium on Combustion	JUL 28-AUG 02, 1996JUL 28-AUG 02, 1996	Combust Inst; ALCOA Tech Ctr; Arthur D Little Inc; Chevron Res & Technol Co; Chevron Chem Co; CONSOL Inc; E I du Pont de Nemours & Co; Elect Power Res Inst; Engn Managements Consultants; EXXON Res & Engn Co; Factory Mutual Res Corp; Ford Motor Co; GE Corp Res & Dev Ctr; Owens, Brockway; Phillip Morris USA; Res Industries; Sawyer Associates; S Coast Air Quality Management Dist; SS Energy & Environm Int; United Technol Res Ctr; Ansaldo; Camera Commercio, Industria Artigianato; Consiglio Nazl Ricerche; ENEL CRT; ENI; Elsevier Sci Inc; FIAT CFR; Gordon & Breach Publicat Inc; Riello; Univ Federico II; Bric a Brac Napoi; Comune Napoli; ELASIS; Hewlett Packard Italian; Perkin Elmer Italia spa; Reg CampaniaCombust Inst; ALCOA Tech Ctr; Arthur D Little Inc; Chevron Res & Technol Co; Chevron Chem Co; CONSOL Inc; E I du Pont de Nemours & Co; Elect Power Res Inst; Engn Managements Consultants; EXXON Res & Engn Co; Factory Mutual Res Corp; Ford Motor Co; GE Corp Res & Dev Ctr; Owens, Brockway; Phillip Morris USA; Res Industries; Sawyer Associates; S Coast Air Quality Management Dist; SS Energy & Environm Int; United Technol Res Ctr; Ansaldo; Camera Commercio, Industria Artigianato; Consiglio Nazl Ricerche; ENEL CRT; ENI; Elsevier Sci Inc; FIAT CFR; Gordon & Breach Publicat Inc; Riello; Univ Federico II; Bric a Brac Napoi; Comune Napoli; ELASIS; Hewlett Packard Italian; Perkin Elmer Italia spa; Reg Campania	NAPLES, ITALYNAPLES, ITALY	3	0	0	0	0	0	3					*************	WOS:000083308500211

The resulting ZnO/ZnFe2O4 micro-hexahedra were systematically characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electronic microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM, and surface area analysis. Moreover, modulation in crystal size, composition, and textural properties of spongy ZnO/ZnFe2O4 micro-hexahedra was easily achieved by varying the Zn2+/Fe3+ feeding ratio and the annealing temperature. The antibacterial property of the products was analyzed by testing ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and inhibition zones. Results showed that oxidative stress was the governing mechanism for the antibacterial activity of ZnO/ZnFe2O4 hybrid materials. Moreover, we found that the higher reactive oxygen species yields and the resulting antibacterial activity were exhibited by the ZnO/ZnFe2O4 micro-hexahedra formed at lower sintering temperatures rather than the pure ZnO and Fe2O3. The enhanced antibacterial properties were likely caused by the spongy ZnO/ZnFe2O4 heterostructures, improving the probability of photoinduced charge separation and broadening the visible-light absorption.									65	4	0	0	17	0	67			2050-750X	2050-7518		WOS:000318360900010	32260952

ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				594						A78	10.1051/0004-6361/201628609				OCT 2016	2016	By revisiting the Suzaku and XMM-Newton data of the North Polar Spur, we discovered that the spectra are inconsistent with the traditional model consisting of pure thermal emission and neutral absorption. The most prominent discrepancies are the enhanced O VIII and Ne IX forbidden-to-resonance ratios, and a high O VIII Ly beta line relative to other Lyman series. A collisionally ionized absorption model can naturally explain both features, while a charge exchange component can only account for the former. By including the additional ionized absorption, the plasma in the North Polar Spur can be described by a single-phase collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE) component with a temperature of 0.25 keV, and nitrogen, oxygen, neon, magnesium, and iron abundances of 0.4-0.8 solar. The abundance pattern of the North Polar Spur is well in line with those of the Galactic halo stars. The high nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio reported in previous studies can be migrated to the large transmission of the O VIII Ly alpha line. The ionized absorber is characterized by a balance temperature of 0.17-0.20 keV and a column density of 3-5 x 10(19) cm(-2). Based on the derived abundances and absorption, we speculate that the North Polar Spur is a structure in the Galactic halo, so that the emission is mostly absorbed by the Galactic interstellar medium in the line of sight.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1432-0746			WOS:000385832200080

The membranes effectively catalyzed the reduction of toxic Cr-VI to benign Cr-III by employing formic acid ( FA) as the reducing agent. The effects of parameters, such as initial concentrations of Cr-VI (5-25 mg/L) and FA (0.117-0.702 M), solution pHs (2.12-5.43) and temperatures (15-55 degrees C), as well as HCOONa concentrations (0-0.20 M) on Cr-VI reduction were analyzed in view of scalable industrial applications. Owing to the synergistic effects amongst Ni-0, MoxC, doped nitrogen, and oxygen groups as catalytic active sites, and carbon shell protection of metal NPs from leaching out, MoxNiy@NC/PVDF catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and recyclable capability for Cr-VI reduction. The membrane's unique porous structure and large chemically active surface area not only minimize the NPs agglomeration, but also allow the facile transport of catalytic reactants to the active surface without suffering from high mass-transfer resistance. This study demonstrates MoxNiy@N-C/PVDF catalytic membranes with the morphological and structural features provide a green, economic, and fast method for the treatment of Cr-VI containing waters.									27	1	0	0	7	1	28			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000430695300054

Herein, flower-like CuCo2S4 microspheres were successfully synthesized and used as an effective water oxidation catalyst. CuCo2S4/NF (NF=nickel foam) affords electrocatalytic water oxidation activity, with a current density of 20mAcm(-2) at a low overpotential of 260mV. The overpotential value is lower than that of benchmark RuO2/NF (overpotential of 340mV at a current density of 20mAcm(-2)). The water oxidation activity increases linearly before nonlinearly improving with increasing pH; this indicates that the substrate changes from water to hydroxyl. The CuCo2S4/NF catalyst is demonstrated to be a real water oxidation catalyst based on diverse experiments.									26	1	0	0	0	0	26			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000424106500010	29314624

Proceedings								6 pp.	6 pp.		10.1109/ICSensT.2016.7796317				2016	2016	Poly (3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) films were prepared by electro-oxidation in an aqueous solution on Au microelectrode. Electrolyte solutions and polymerization parameters were optimized previously for further overoxidation. The effect of overoxidation time has been optimized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), which signifies that overoxidation film with 45s at 1.35V presents strong adsorption as well as good conductivity. The other one-step overoxidation film by direct CV ranging from -0.6V to 1.35V was polymerized for comparison. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were used for monitoring the functional groups evolution and morphological changes. Both of them presents increased abundant oxygen functional groups and roughness, yet exhibit dendritic morphology and piles of spherical protrusions respectively. Moreover, double-step overoxidized film show better electrochemical performance toward lead ion sensing. These characterizations may bring out the appearance of novel properties that may be beneficial for specific sensing applications.					2016 10th International Conference on Sensing Technology (ICST)2016 10th International Conference on Sensing Technology (ICST)	11-13 Nov. 201611-13 Nov. 2016		Nanjing, ChinaNanjing, China	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-5090-0795-0	INSPEC:16575311

Boron-bearing iron concentrate is the intermediate product of the ore dressing process of crude low grade ludwigite and extracting boron from it has great effect on the total boron yield. Pre-reduction of the boron-bearing iron concentrate is one of the important steps of the pyrometallurgical boron and iron separation process. The carbothermal reduction study of boron-bearing iron concentrate was carried out in the present work. The reduction rate was improved with the increasing of heating temperature and carbon content. The appropriate temperature and C/O (mole ratio of fixed carbon to reducible oxygen) were 1200 to 1300 degrees C and 0.8 to 1.2, respectively. In addition, the microstructure and phase evolution of the pellet during the reduction process were characterized by means of SEM and XRD. The apparent activation energy of the iron oxide reduction in the composite pellet was 114.32 kJ/mol based on the first-order reaction model. The iron and slag separate well when the reduced pellets were heated at 1550 degrees C. The B2O3 content of the slag and the boron element content of the pig iron were 10.8 wt% and 0.74 wt%, respectively. The main minerals in the slag were olivine, kotoite, periclase and spinel after slow cooling, and the efficiency of extraction of boron (EEB) of the slag was 68.4%. The boron-rich slag and boron-bearing pig iron can be used as the raw materials for boron extraction and steel making.									15	4	0	0	0	0	16			0915-1559	1347-5460		WOS:000353609000007

The contribution of sulfuric acid as a weathering agent is still poorly quantified; the identification of riverine sulfate sources is difficult. The use of delta S-34 and delta O-18 of dissolved sulfate allows us to demonstrate that most of the sulfate in surface waters of the Mackenzie River system, Canada, derives from pyrite oxidation (85% +/- 5%) and not from sedimentary sulfate. The calculated flux of pyrite-derived sulfate is 0.13 x 10(12) mol/yr, corresponding to 20%-27% of the estimated global budget. This result suggests that the modern global ocean delivery of sulfide-derived sulfate, and thus chemical weathering with sulfuric acid, may be significantly underestimated. A strong correlation between sulfide oxidation rates and mechanical erosion rates suggests that the exposure of fresh mineral surfaces is the rate-limiting factor of sulfide oxidation in the subbasins investigated. The chemical weathering budget of the Mackenzie River shows that more than half of the dissolved inorganic carbon discharged to the ocean is ancient sedimentary carbon from carbonate (62 %) and not atmospheric carbon (38 %). The subsequent carbonate precipitation in the ocean will thus release more CO2 in the atmosphere-ocean system than that consumed by continental weathering, typically on glacial-interglacial time scales.									201	17	0	0	45	0	213			0091-7613	1943-2682		WOS:000250543900011

During the past five years a quite good understanding has been reached concerning the methods and models to be used for these systems. For systems containing transition metals hybrid density functional methods have proven both accurate and computationally efficient. A background on these methods and the accuracy achieved in benchmark tests are given first in this review. The rest of the review describes examples of studies on different metalloenzymes. Most of these examples describe mechanisms where dioxygen is either formed, as in photosystem II, or cleaved as in many other enzymes like cytochrome c oxidase, ribonucleotide reductase, methane mono-oxygenase and tyrosinase. In the descriptions below high emphasis is put on the actual determination of the transition states, which are the key points determining the mechanisms.									177	0	0	0	51	0	178			0033-5835	1469-8994		WOS:000181539100003	12643044

Nickel-nitrogen-carbon (Ni-N-C) materials have shown promise in terms of activity and selectivity toward the electro-conversion of CO2 into CO, a feedstock widely used in the chemical sector. Ni-N-C catalysts, postulated to comprise catalytically active atomically dispersed Ni-N-x/C sites, are commonly prepared by pyrolyzing a mixture of transition metal-, nitrogen-, and carbon-containing precursors. Herein, we use a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8)-a subclass of metal organic frameworks.as a platform for synthesizing Ni-N-C electrocatalysts. We systematically investigate the role of the Ni concentration impregnated into the ZIF-8 precursor structure during synthesis in the overall structure and performance of the resulting Ni-N-C catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction. Our findings show that increased Ni contents in the catalyst precursor results in the formation of Ni-containing particles that increase the catalytic selectivity toward the competing hydrogen evolution reaction, whereas reduced Ni contents preferentially form atomically dispersed Ni-N-x/C active sites dispersed in heterogeneous carbon structures consisting of carbon nanotubes and carbonaceous particles. As an optimized concentration of Ni in the precursor mixture, we demonstrate a CO2 reduction selectivity toward CO of ca. 99% Faradaic efficiency at an applied potential of -0.68 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000742734000001

The bonding interface, electrochemical properties, and application properties in the zinc electrowinning process of the composite electrode materials were tested and analyzed. The results indicate that an improvement of the corrosion resistance of the electrode material, a more uniform distribution of the surface potential, and an enhancement of the electrochemistry have been achieved by changing the structure of the electrode. The cell voltage of the Al/Sn/Pb composite anode decreased by 0.169 V compared with that of the Pb alloy electrode in the zinc electrowinning engineering experiment. Its current efficiency is increased by 8.5%, its specific electric energy consumption is reduced by 11.4%, and its corrosion rate is reduced by 57.3%. The surface quality of the cathode-precipitated products is good, the impurity content is low, and the impurity Pb content is decreased by 35.59% compared to the Pb alloy electrode.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2162-8769	2162-8777		WOS:000665119900001

The objective of choosing three Co(II)-MOFs 1-3 composed of different ligands and having 1D, 2D and 3D structures, respectively, was to have deep insights into role of linked ligands and the structural morphology toward electrocatalytic performance. MOFs 1-3 have been examined as electrocatalysts for water oxidation and comparative assessments revealed their catalytic performance in the order 2 > 3 approximate to 1. MOF 2 shows the best electrocatalytic activity for OER, which could be due to the higher amount of cobalt present in MOF-2, faster electron transfer kinetics and higher effective electrode surface area. The onset potential of MOF 2 was comparable or less as compared to benchmark catalysts IrO2 and Pt/C. Overall studies strongly suggest that MOF 2 could be promising materials for replacement of commercial high-cost electrode material. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Three zones were created in this reactor: a flue gas zone, a reducing gas zone, and an air zone. It was expected that NOx reduction efficiency could be enhanced by independently controlled temperature and oxygen content. In this paper, heat transfer was investigated for the proposed iNA reactor to understand the temperature evolution. A heat transfer model was first developed for an air preheater for verification. Energy balance equations were proposed for both the gas and the matrix phase. The modelling results showed that the design can meet the targeted temperatures. The developed heat transfer model was further applied to simulate the temperature profiles in the iNA reactor with three zones. The influences of several design and operating parameters on the heat transfer performance were investigated: flow direction of reducing gas, inlet temperature of flue gas, rotating speed of the reactor, inlet temperature and flow rate of reducing gas, and different zone partitions. It was concluded that a slower rotating speed was preferred to maintain large temperature differences between different zones, which benefited the temperature-dependent NOx adsorption-reduction process. For the reducing gas, downward flow direction, higher temperature and flow rates were preferred.

Thin film of Bi (10 nm) was deposited on top of pre-deposited Ni (10 nm) film at 0.6 and 1.8 A/second deposition rates. The samples were then annealed at temperatures between 60 degrees C and 260 degrees C for 1 to 5 h under vacuum of similar to 1 x10(-6) mbar. Scanning electron microscopy was used to investigate surface morphology. Scanning electron microscopy images depicted islands at all temperatures including the asdeposited sample. High resolution transmission electron microscopy reveals highly crystalline film and nanowires with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy showing that the film and nanowires were formed by Bi and Ni elements with oxygen as impurity. Rutherford backscattering spectrometry revealed intermixing of layers at the interface. Furthermore, spontaneous formation of NiBi3 and NiBi stoichiometry was observed attributed to reaction-diffusion mechanism during deposition. X-ray diffraction revealed structural transformation of the films from amorphous (as-deposited) to polycrystalline hexagonal beta-NiBi crystal structure at 60 degrees C to 200 degrees C. X-ray diffraction pattern also revealed hexagonal crystal lattice with preferential growth orientation along the [1 0 1] plane with other supported planes [0 0 2], [1 0 2], [1 1 0] and [1 0 3]. The results pointed toward successful utilization of this approach to prepare templates for the synthesis of well controlled, vertically aligned and well distributed crystalline nanowires of Ni-Bi binary system more relevant to the industrial application.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0040-6090			WOS:000418305200046

The used axial ligands include 4-cyanopyridine (py-CN), pyridine (py), 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (py-NMe2), 4-methoxypyridine (py-OMe), 1-methylimidazole (im-Me), and thiophenolate (thi). Complexes 1-py and 1-py-OMe were structurally characterized. The Co ion in both structures has an almost identical distorted octahedral coordination environment with the four N atoms of tpfc defining the equatorial plane and the two molecules of pyridine (for 1-py) or 4-methoxypyridine (for 1-py-OMe) occupying the axial positions. Electrochemical studies of these Co corroles in acetonitrile showed that they all display two oxidation events and the oxidation waves shift to the cathodic direction with electron-donating axial ligands, a trend that is consistent with increased electron densities on Co ions. All these Co corroles were found to be active for electrocatalytic water oxidation: by using catalyst-coated fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) working electrodes, cyclic voltammograms displayed pronounced catalytic waves for water oxidation in 0.1 M pH 7.0 phosphate buffer solutions. The onset overpotentials are in the range of 510 to 580 mV, depending on the electron-donating ability of the trans axial ligands. These results demonstrate that the catalytic activities of Co corroles for water oxidation are considerably affected by the trans axial ligands on Co centers and provide valuable insights into the design of new catalysts for water oxidation.									57	4	0	0	4	0	57			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000399383100007	28184402

Various selenium species at substitutional sites for O or Ti, at interstitial sites, as well as at mixed substitutional/interstitial sites are studied. Among the explored structures, Ti(1-2x)O2Se2x (containing Se4+ species), TiO(2-x)Sex (containing Se2- species), and TiO(2-x)Se2x (containing Se-2(2-) species) reveal significant enhanced visible-light optical absorption spectra with new absorption features appearing at 500, 600, and 690 nm, respectively. Our calculated spectra are found to be in good agreement with those obtained in available experimental works. The band gap narrowing in these materials originates from incorporation of newly occupied electronic levels within 0.5-1.5 eV above the original valence band of TiO2, leading to new narrowed band gaps of 2.5, 2.0, and 1.8 eV respectively. Our calculations also reveal suitable band positions of Ti(1-2x)O2Se2x and TiO(2-x)Sex for overall water splitting, whereas TiO(2-x)Se2x shows an unsuitable valence band position for the oxygen evolution reaction. In contrast, the localized electronic character of the new occupied states on the Se 4p orbitals and only on the O 2p orbitals linked to the Se species makes the holes mobility limited in this material and the recombination rate of charge carriers greatly increased in the bulk.									27	0	0	0	2	0	27			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000328101200003

By virtue of their unique combination of structural features (including the tunability of both host layers and interlayer guest anion, exfoliation property, structure topological transformation, confinement effect), LDHs have many potential applications in heterogeneous catalysis-as catalysts themselves, catalyst supports, or catalyst precursors. In addition, the properties of LDH-based catalysts can be tailored for specific purposes by facile modulation of their surface/interface defect structure (e.g., oxygen vacancy defects or metal defects), controlling the concentration/strength of surface acid/base sites, tuning the geometric/electronic structure of active sites, or by taking advantage of the confinement effect intrinsic to 2D materials. In addition, by utilizing the topological structural transformation of LDH precursors, supported metal catalysts can be obtained (as single metals, bimetallic alloys or heterostructures, and intermetallic compounds) with tunable particle size/morphology and intriguing electronic properties. The main focus of this review is on recent advances in structure design, preparation, and catalytic applications of LDH-based heterogeneous catalysts. In addition, future challenges and development strategies are discussed from the viewpoints of modulation of intrinsic active sites and establishment of scalable fabrication processes.									222	15	0	0	16	0	224			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000450371400001

However, its biological role and molecular mechanisms of action in the development of gastric cancer (GC) remain unclear. In the present study, an integrated analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus database, and Kaplan-Meier plotter database was performed to predict the expression and prognostic value of KIF15 in GC patients. Detection of KIF15 expression in GC cells and tissues was performed by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In vitro cell proliferation, viability, colony formation ability and flow cytometry assays, and in vivo tumorigenicity assay, were performed to evaluate the effects of KIF15 knockdown on GC cell phenotype. It was demonstrated that the expression of KIF15 messenger RNA in GC tissues was significantly higher compared with that in adjacent tissues, and was closely associated with larger tumor size and poor patient prognosis. In addition, functional studies demonstrated that, due to the increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, the interference with the expression of KIF15 not only decreased cell proliferation but also increased cell apoptosis and induced cell cycle arrest. ROS-mediated activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase/c-Jun signaling reduced cell proliferation by regulating the GC cell cycle and increasing apoptosis. Taken together, the results of the present study indicate that KIF15 is an oncoprotein contributing to GC progression, and is expected to help identify novel biomarkers and treatment targets in GC.									6	0	0	0	5	0	6			0021-9541	1097-4652		WOS:000528849900001	32342525

The concentrations of CO2, CO, CH4, other hydrocarbons, NO, N2O, HCN, and NH3 were measured in the flue gas, shortly after the burning fuel particles. Most of the fuel nitrogen was released during devolatilization (66-75%). Relatively high conversions to NO were found. N2O was formed but also rapidly destroyed by the reaction: N2O + H --> N-2 + OH. HCN was also formed in quantities similar to NH3 even during wood combustion. The HCN/NH3 ratios seemed to depend on the fuel H/N ratios. The experimental results supported the hypothesis that the nitrogen of wood and other biofuels also exists in heterocyclic structures. With the proposed NO and N2O formation mechanism the effects of fuel nitrogen content, temperature and oxygen partial pressure can be explained. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A standard reactor is investigated, with ethanol/hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO) mixture as spray/precursor composition and oxygen as dispersion gas for the production of silica nanoparticles. Spray evaporation, ignition and stabilisation of the flame are achieved by a premixed methane/oxygen pilot flame. The gas, spray and nanoparticle phases are modelled with Eulerian, Lagrangian and Eulerian approaches, respectively. A modified tabulated chemistry model, adapted from the premixed flamelet generated manifold approach (PFGM) with artificial flame thickening (ATF) is proposed, tested and applied for the system. The control variables are the element mass fractions of hydrogen and carbon together with a joint progress variable. The population balance equation of the nanoparticles is modelled in terms of number, volume and surface area concentration, its subfilter distribution is modelled with a delta function. The combustion of HMDSO and formation of silica particle monomers is described by a twostep global mechanism. The nucleation source term is tabulated as a function of the control variables. The submodels for spray and combustion are validated separately to compensate for the shortage in detailed experimental data for nanoparticle spray flames. Subsequently, simulation results for the particles are presented and discussed, in particular the polydisperse particle size distributions resulting from turbulence.

This study systematically investigated the potential of Bi and Ce elements as substitutes to fabricate doped-SnO2 reactive electrochemical membrane (REM) for water purification. Compared with the control (SnO2-Sb-REM), SnO2-Bi-REM showed a higher direct electron transfer (DET) rate and center dot OH yield due to its larger electroactive surface area. The higher oxygen evolution potential of SnO2-Ce-REM enhanced selectivity for center dot OH generation. Although both SnO2-BiREM and SnO2-Ce-REM exhibited higher electrooxidation of tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH) and atrazine (ATZ) than SnO2-Sb-REM, only the service lifespan of SnO2-Bi-REM can meet the requirements of practical applications. Mechanistic studies of the degradation pathways indicated that the rapid degradation of TCH on SnO2-Bi-REM was mainly contributed by the DET process, while the transformation of intermediates involved the reactions with center dot OH. In comparison, aqueous center dot OH played an important role in the degradation of refractory ATZ. Moreover, a SnO2-Bi-REM system demonstrated ~99% removal of trace TCH and ATZ from wastewater effluent in single-pass operation at a low electrical efficiency per log order removal (EE/O, 0.71 kWh m-3). To this end, the SnO2-Bi-REM is demonstrated to be a promising electrode to replace SnO2-Sb-REM for efficient and sustainable water purification.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1383-5866	1873-3794		WOS:000814760800001

Experiments found that the modification of surfaces andthe construction of interfaces on BaNbO2N-based semiconductors are highlyrelated to the photocatalytic performance, but the mechanism is not fullyunderstood. We present here the influence of exposed terminations on theelectronic properties and photocatalytic features oftransandcisBaNbO2Nusing density functional theory calculations. For each surface, we consider twocomplementary terminations, separately. Analysis of surface energies suggeststhat (100) and (001) are the most preferentially exposed surfaces among thestudied low-index surfaces. Density of states illustrates that the contributions ofband edges of surfaces are similar to those of the corresponding bulk. Ourcalculations reveal that the surface rumpling is highly related to the level of workfunction. Work functions are distinct for various surface terminations, which suggests that the transferring direction of thephotogenerated carrier in BaNbO2N-based heterostructures could be controlled by obtaining the preferred surface termination.Dissociative water adsorption on all of the (100) and (001) terminations is thermodynamically favorable. The exposed O atoms arethe most favorable sites for HER, especially incis-(100)-Nb2O3N,trans-(100)-NbO2, andtrans-(001)-BaO. Our results show thatcis-(001)-BaO is the most suitable candidate for OER, followed bycis-(100)-Ba2ON. The computed overpotentials for most of thestudied terminations are comparable to and even lower than those of WO3and TiO2surfaces. Thesefindings provide importantinsights into the rational design of (100)- and (001)-oriented BaNbO2N samples for enhanced photocatalytic activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000797817500004

Prepared NiFeO, with ratios of Ni:Fe as [3:1], [1:1] and [1:3], samples are further analyzed by basic characterizations like X-ray diffraction, UV-Vis absorption photoluminescence and FT-IR spectra investigations. The bandgap of the NiFeO [3:1], NiFeO [1:1] and NiFeO [1:3] samples were calculated to be 2.96 eV, 2.74 eV and 2.22 eV correspondingly. The morphology exhibited by the NiFeO [3:1], NiFeO [1:1] samples is the combined nanoparticles and nanosheets with thick and thin layers. The reduced in size explored Fe ions incorporation and NiFeO [1:3] sample revealed small nanoparticles. The electrochemical activity was studied. CV, LSV, EIS and CA spectra were analyzed. The specific capacitance of NiFeO [3:1], NiFeO [1:1] and NiFeO [1:3] is 232, 264 and 290 F/g. The overpotential calculated is 240 mV, 200 mV and 174 mV @ 10 mA/ cm(2) for NiFeO [3:1], NiFeO [1:1] and NiFeO [1:3] with 232 mA/g, 320 mA/g and 352 mA/g current densities. Lower overpotential of NiFeO [1:3] helped to attain higher current density which gives the smaller resistance. This unique behavior is enhanced by addition of Fe ions in higher concentration.

In this work, the thermal stability of 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane (FDTS) monolayers is studied using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The FDTS monolayers are deposited on Si (100) substrates via vapor phase reactions. Significant fluorine desorption of the monolayers is observed for samples annealed at 250 and 300 degrees C in air. The fluorine coverage decreases as a function of annealing time at a given annealing temperature. The desorption is proposed to be dependent on the monolayer packing details and may be influenced by the intermolecular heat transfer. Removal of the CF3 groups is found to be faster than that of the CF2 group as evidenced by the CF2/CF3 peak area ratios that increase with the annealing time. Sessile drop water contact angle and fluorine coverage evolution results show that the estimated useful coating lifetime is 180min when the samples are annealed at 300 degrees C and similar to 560min when annealed at 250 degrees C. The peak position of the binding energy of the F 1s spectral line is related to the monolayer fluorine coverage and it may be a result of the interactions between the molecular chain and the negatively charged silicon substrate. Furthermore, nearly no chain desorption is detected for samples annealed in an inert environment, which may be attributed to the elimination of reactive oxygen and moisture molecules. The thermal degradation behaviors in ambient and inert atmosphere provide useful information for designing a nanoimprint process for the commercial manufacturing of polymeric microstructure and nanostructure.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2166-2746			WOS:000569104200011

CENTRALLY IGNITED MODELS								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				771	1					58	10.1088/0004-637X/771/1/58				JUL 1 2013	2013	A leading model for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) begins with a white dwarf near the Chandrasekhar mass that ignites a degenerate thermonuclear runaway close to its center and explodes. In a series of papers, we shall explore the consequences of ignition at several locations within such dwarfs. Here we assume central ignition, which has been explored before, but is worth revisiting, if only to validate those previous studies and to further elucidate the relevant physics for future work. A perturbed sphere of hot iron ash with a radius of similar to 100 km is initialized at the middle of the star. The subsequent explosion is followed in several simulations using a thickened flame model in which the flame speed is either fixed-within the range expected from turbulent combustion-or based on the local turbulent intensity. Global results, including the explosion energy and bulk nucleosynthesis (e.g., Ni-56 of 0.48-0.56 M-circle dot) turn out to be insensitive to this speed. In all completed runs, the energy released by the nuclear burning is adequate to unbind the star, but not enough to give the energy and brightness of typical SNe Ia. As found previously, the chemical stratification observed in typical events is not reproduced. These models produce a large amount of unburned carbon and oxygen in central low velocity regions, which is inconsistent with spectroscopic observations, and the intermediate mass elements and iron group elements are strongly mixed during the explosion.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000321274200058

Iron amendment and acidic oxygen-surface groups were found to promote the catalytic activity towards paraquat degradation The effects of three significant operational parameters (hydrogen peroxide concentration, catalyst dosage and temperature) on catalytic performance of the most promising catalyst (AC-Fe) were then investigated The best degradation yield (71.4% of COD abatement in a 20 mg L-1 solution) was obtained with 12 5 mmol L-1 H2O2, 1 g L-1 catalyst dosage and T = 70 degrees C, although ambient temperature could be preferred for application convenienceA nearly complete degradation of paraquat and its intermediates (similar to 92% of COD removal) was achieved after 12 h treatment, when proceeding at ambient temperature via regular sequential additions of the spent amount of H2O2 in the presence of optimal catalyst dosage A reasonably good stability of the catalyst was demonstrated during consecutive re-use of the same recovered sample, in long-term CWPO runs Only a slight decrease of catalytic performance (from 92% to 85% of COD removal) was observed after five consecutive cycles, probably due to high stability of the supported iron speciesTime evolutions of aromatic intermediates and short-chain carboxylic acids were recorded using HPLC analysis, and clearly indicated that CWPO is capable of effectively degrading the paraquat herbicide (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved									65	5	0	0	17	2	71			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000279124000028

In this paper, a nanoporous SPE-PtNi/C membrane electrode is prepared by ion beam sputtering, ultrasonic-assisted electrochemical dealloying, and hotpressing. Special attention is paid to the analysis of the electrochemical properties, phase structure, surface morphology, active constituent distribution, and catalytic efficiency for cyclohexene hydrogenation of the produced electrode in comparison with those of commercial Pt/C catalysts. The results show that the ultrasonic-assisted electrochemical etching temperature exerts the most significant effect on the catalytic activity of the catalyst under consideration. In particular, the treatment of PtNi/C in 0.7 mol/L HClO4 for 1.5 h at the optimized temperature of 50 degrees C enables one to increase the catalytic activity by 25.20% at decreasing the Pt-loading content by 88.85% compared with commercial Pt/C. Furthermore, the nanoporous structure of the PtNi/C surface allows the binding energy of Pt 4f7/2 to be reduced by 0.23 eV due to the Ni loss and the crystal plane shrinkage from NiPt, which enhances the compressive strain of the lattice structure of exposed Pt and increases the number of active sites. Finally, the use of a nanoporous SPE-PtNi/C membrane electrode could increase the yield of cyclohexene during the hydrogenation reaction by 179% at simultaneously improving the current efficiency by 69%.

This object is a red giant and has extremely low Fe abundance ([Fe/H] = -4.0) and very large enhancement of C, N, and O with excesses of Na, Mg, Al, and Si. This star is a new example of a small group of such CEMP stars identified by previous studies. We find a very similar abundance pattern for O-Zn in this class of objects that shows enhancement of elements up to Si and normal abundance of Ca and Fe-group elements. Whereas the C/N ratio is different among these stars, the (C + N)/O ratio is similar. This suggests that similar abundance ratios of C were also yielded, relative to O-Zn in progenitors, and was later affected by the CN-cycle. By contrast, the heavy neutron-capture elements Sr and Ba are deficient in J2217+2104, compared to the four objects in this class previously studied. This indicates that the neutron-capture process in the early Galaxy, presumably the r-process, has no direct connection to the phenomenon that has formed such CEMP stars. Comparisons of the abundance pattern that are well determined for such CEMP stars with those of supernova nucleosynthesis models constrain the progenitor mass to be about 25 M-circle dot, which is not particularly different from the typical mass of progenitors expected for extremely metal-poor stars in general.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			0004-6264	2053-051X		WOS:000456070400015

The surface morphologies of the pDAT@ERGO/GC modified electrode were analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). FESEM images indicated that the ERGO supported pDAT has an almost homogeneous morphology structure with a size of 70 to 80 nm. It is due to the water oxidation reaction occurred while pDAT@ERGO/GC fabrication peak at + 1.4V leads to O-2 evolution and oxygen functional group functionalization on ERGO, which confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In contrast, the bare GC modified with pDAT showed randomly arranged irregular bulky morphology structure compared to those of pDAT@ERGO/GC. Electrochemical reduction of graphene oxide was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy, XPS, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The pDAT@ERGO/GC modified electrode was used for the electrochemical determination of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP). The 4-NP oxidation peak was observed at +0.25V, and the differential pulse voltammetry demonstrated wide concentration range (5-1500 mu M), high sensitivity (0.7113 mu A mu M-1), and low limit of detection (37 nM). Moreover, the pDAT@ERGO/GC electrode was applied to real water sample analysis by standard addition method, where in good recoveries (97.8% to 102.4%) were obtained. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

BDD electrodes were deposited on niobium (Nb) substrates in hot filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD) method. The morphology, composition and electrochemical performance of BDD were characterized with scanning electron microscope (SEM), Raman spectroscope and electrochemical workstation. With reactive orange X-GN azo dye effluent as degradation object, effects of different process parameters such as current density (20, 50, 100, 150 mA/cm~2), electrolyte concentration (0.025, 0.05, 0.1 M) and initial solution pH (3.78, 6.47, 10.92) on degradation efficiency were evaluated, respectively, and characterized and tested with ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer. The degradation effect of X-GN was characterized by energy consumption and total organic carbon (TOC). The BDD electrode exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance. The potential window amounted to 3.33 V, oxygen evolution potential amounted to 2.45 V, well above the oxidation potential of most organic matters. The electrode surface reaction was controlled by diffusion step. Allowing for degradation effects of reactive orange X-GN azo dye effluent, the optimal process conditions for 100 mg/L X-GN were: current density of 100 mA/cm~2, electrolyte concentration of 0.05 mol/L, initial solution pH of 3.08. After 5 h treatment under these conditions, color removal rate amounts to 99%, energy consumption 65.4 kW·h/m~3 and TOC removal rate 56.95%. The reactive orange X-GN azo dye effluent can be effectively degraded by BDD anode.			目的研究硼掺杂金刚石(BDD)电极电化学氧化降解活性橙X-GN偶氮染料废水。方法采用热丝气相沉积法(HFCVD)制备铌基BDD电极,采用SEM观察BDD薄膜的表面形貌,用Raman检测BDD薄膜的成分,用电化学工作站测试BDD电极的电化学性能。选择活性橙X-GN染料废水作为降解对象,分别研究电流密度(20、50、100、150 mA/cm~2)、电解质浓度(0.025、0.05、0.1 mol/L)和溶液初始pH(3.78、 6.74、10.92)等不同工艺参数对降解效率的影响,并采用紫外可见光分光光度计进行测试表征,使用能耗和总有机碳量表征降解效果。结果BDD电极具有很好的电催化性能,其电势窗口为3.33 V,析氧电位达到2.45 V,远高于大多数有机物的氧化电位,电极表面反应受扩散步骤控制。结合活性橙X-GN染料溶液降解效果,得出100 mg/L活性橙X-GN溶液的最佳降解工艺参数为:电流密度100 mA/cm~2、电解质浓度0.05 mol/L、溶液初始pH值3.78。采用最佳工艺参数处理5 h后,色度移除率达到99%,能耗为65.4 kW·h/m~3, TOC去除率达到56.95%。结论BDD电极可以有效地降解活性橙X-GN染料废水。						0	5	0	0	0	0	5			1001-3660			CSCD:6043576

One of the major problems is that narrow bandgap semiconductors, such as tantalum nitride, though possessing desirable band alignment for water splitting, suffer from poor photostability for water oxidation. For the first time it is shown that the presence of a ferrihydrite layer permits sustainable water oxidation at the tantalum nitride photoanode for at least 6 h with a benchmark photocurrent over 5 mAcm(-2), whereas the bare photoanode rapidly degrades within minutes. The remarkably enhanced photostability stems from the ferrihydrite, which acts as a hole-storage layer. Furthermore, this work demonstrates that it can be a general strategy for protecting narrow bandgap semi-conductors against photocorrosion in solar water splitting.									289	23	0	0	12	0	295			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000338989500034	24890044	
J	Thomas, B C; Gao, L; Stomp, D; Li, X; Gegenheimer, P A								Spinach chloroplast RNase P: a putative protein enzyme.								Nucleic acids symposium series					33			95	8						1995	1995	Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is the enzyme responsible for endonucleolytically separating the 5'-leader sequence from precursor tRNA molecules. In bacteria, and in the nuclei and mitochondria of all eukaryotes studied so far, RNase P contains an RNA subunit which is necessary for activity in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, we showed earlier that partially-purified RNase P from spinach chloroplasts had physical properties inconsistent with the presence of any RNA. We now report that the properties of the chloroplast enzyme, after 500 to 1500-fold purification, are consistent with enzymatic activity residing in a approximately 70 kDa polypeptide. Gel filtration chromatography on Sephacryl S-200 and S-300 provides a mass for chloroplast RNase P of approximately 70 +/- 5 kDa. A single polypeptide of approximately 70-80 kDa can be crosslinked to iodoUMP-substituted pre-tRNA. The labeling intensity of this polypeptide corresponds closely to the peak of RNase P activity on Sephacryl S-200 chromatography. Unlike the bacterial ribozyme-type RNase P, chloroplast RNase P is not a metalloenzyme. We showed previously that phosphodiester bond cleavage by the E. coli RNA enzyme absolutely requires Mg2+ or Mn2+ coordinated to the pro-Rp oxygen of the scissile phosphodiester phosphate. In contrast, we now find that chloroplast RNase P has no such requirement, and can accurately and efficiently cleave pre-tRNA containing an Rp-thio-substitution at the scissile bond. These data are entirely consistent with the hypothesis that RNase P in plant chloroplasts is not a ribozyme, but a conventional protein enzyme.									17	0	0		16	0	17			0261-3166			MEDLINE:8643412	8643412

Using giant unilamellar vesicles and a chlorin photosensitizer, we asymmetrically oxidized the outer or inner monolayers of lipid membranes. We observed different shape transitions such as oblate to prolate and budding, which are typical of membrane curvature modifications. The asymmetry of the shape transitions is in accordance with a lowered effective spontaneous curvature of the leaflet being targeted. We interpret this effect as a decrease in the preferred area of the targeted leaflet compared to the other, due to the secondary products of oxidation (cleaved-lipids). Permeabilization of giant vesicles by light-induced oxidation is observed after a lag and is characterized in relation with the photosensitizer concentration. We interpret permeabilization as the opening of a pore above a critical membrane tension, resulting from the budding of vesicles. The evolution of photosensitized giant vesicle lysis tension was measured and yields an estimation of the effective spontaneous curvature at lysis. Additionally photo-oxidation was shown to be fusogenic.									66	0	0	0	43	0	66			0006-3495	1542-0086		WOS:000272274500007	19948119

The trend in their electrocatalytic activities ranks in this order: Ni Mo > Ni Zn > Ni Co > Ni W > Ni Fe > Ni Cr. The electrocatalytic activity of these coatings is very significant when compared with the data on conventional mild-steel cathodes currently used in industry.

At present, the mining pit is partly flooded and contains a highly acidic (pH 2.7) pit lake with approximately 6 Mm(3) of metal and sulphate-rich water. Recent detailed research performed in the area has proven that the reaction of the lake water with both the dumping mining wastes and the inflow of acid mine waters are strongly modifying the water quality of the pit lake. A major change was identified in the water quality that resulted from the dumping of 1.4 Mm 3 of pyritic wastes during 2005 and 2006. The oxidative dissolution of this mineral has resulted in: (1) a total consumption of dissolved oxygen, (2) a notable increase of electric conductivity (from 8.6 to 12 mS/cm) and (3) a strong acidification (pH from 4.2 to 2.7) and an important heating that was observed as a result of the exothermic character of pyrite oxidation. Despite the total lack of oxidizing agents-such as O-2 and Fe(III) (Fe[III], < 5% total Fe)-in the pit lake, pyrite is being oxidized with a continuous increase of the SO42- and Fe concentrations.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1061-4303			WOS:000322768700004	24003596

Furthermore, cyclic voltammetry has been applied to evaluate the relative tendency of 1 and 2 to be oxidized. The turnover frequency (TOF) increases as the ratio (R) between the concentration of the SO and that of the catalyst increases. O-2 production with CAN is observed in experiments with R = 20 for 1 and 3, whereas O-2 becomes detectable with 2 only when R = 40. Catalyst 2 has the highest tendency to be oxidized to Ir-IV and forms a blue intermediate I characterized by a UV/Vis band at 574 nm. The formation of I occurs with the same velocity as that of the production of O-2, which indicates that I is a species directly involved in the catalytic cycle. The disappearance of I, when O-2 evolution is finished, is a second-order process more than one order of magnitude slower than O-2 production and is strongly accelerated by the presence of benzyl alcohol. This suggests that I is a molecular species that slowly undergoes disproportion when catalysis is over. Experiments in which multiple aliquots of SO (CAN) were added (R = 20 and 40) indicate that catalysts 1-3 can reinitiate the catalytic cycle once they have been kept in a dormant state for 0-9 min; the TOFs of the second and third additions are approximately equal and higher than that of the first addition. By combining manometry and on-line mass spectrometry measurements, it was found that O-2 evolution is parallel to the production of a small amount of CO2 owing to catalyst degradation. The TOFs of the experiments performed with NaIO4 as the SO are about 2-3 times lower than those with CAN, but the same reactivity order is found 3 > 2 > 1. The activation parameters were evaluated with NaIO4 for all catalysts and with CAN for 2 at 10-45 degrees C. Delta G(#) is practically the same in all situations (25-26 kcalmol(-1)), whereas Delta H-# is appreciably lower for 2 (13.1 kcalmol(-1) with CAN and 13.3 kcalmol(-1) with NaIO4) than for 1 (16 kcalmol(-1)) and 3 (16.9 kcalmol(-1)). The lowest enthalpic cost with 2 is balanced by the highest entropic cost (-41 calmol(-1)K(-1)) that approaches that typical for an associative bimolecular process.									57	1	0	0	3	0	57			1434-1948	1099-0682		WOS:000336741600012

In particular, tungsten disulfide (WS2) is an efficient visible light absorber with relatively high carrier mobilities and catalytic activity towards hydrogen evolution. While explanation of the quantum confinement and excitonic effects governing TMD optoelectronic properties has progressed in recent years, less is known about the ultra-fast photoresponse and carrier dynamics following light excitation. This work utilizes transient absorption spectroscopy, with pump tunability and broadband visible probing, to monitor the carrier dynamics of both CVD-grown monolayer and solution exfoliated WS2. Picosecond-scale features include simultaneous bleaching of excitonic states and a red-shifted absorption spectrum attributed to bandgap renormalization, while free carriers, defect trapped carriers, and recombination signatures are apparent at increasing pico- to nanosecond lifetimes. Features associated with excitons, trions, and photo-excited carriers exhibit strong dependence on local environmental factors. Moisture, oxygen, chemical dopants, and dielectric environment strongly affect the strength and decay lifetimes of these photo-excited species. These results highlight the importance of understanding and controlling these local environmental factors to the rational design and implementation of 2D TMDs optoelectronic device platforms.

Intrinsically Activated SrTiO3: Photocatalytic H2 Evolution from Neutral Aqueous Methanol Solution in the Absence of Any Noble Metal Cocatalyst [arXiv]								arXiv								23 pp.	23 pp.						14 April 2020	2020	Noble metal cocatalysts are conventionally a crucial factor in oxide-semiconductor-based photocatalytic hydrogen generation. In the present work, we show that optimized high-temperature hydrogenation of commercially available strontium titanate (SrTiO3) powder can be used to engineer an intrinsic cocatalytic shell around nanoparticles that can create a photocatalyst that is highly effective without the use of any additional cocatalyst for hydrogen generation from neutral aqueous methanol solutions. This intrinsic activation effect can also be observed for SrTiO3[100] single crystal as well as Nb-doped SrTiO3 (100) single crystal. For all types of SrTiO3 samples (nanopowders and either of the single crystals), hydrogenation under optimum conditions leads to a surface-hydroxylated layer together with lattice defects visible by transmission electron microscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and photoluminescence (PL). Active samples provide states in a defective matrix -- this is in contrast to the inactive defects formed in other reductive atmospheres. In aqueous media, active SrTiO3 samples show a significant negative shift of the flatband potential (in photoelectrochemical as well as in capacitance data) and a lower charge-transfer resistance for photoexcited electrons. We therefore ascribe the remarkable cocatalyst-free activation of the material to a synergy between thermodynamics (altered interface energetics induced by hydroxylation) and kinetics (charge transfer mediation by suitable Ti3+ states).

In the present study we aimed to investigate whether ginsenoside Rb1, a major constituent of ginseng, protects endothelial cells from H2O2-induced endothelial senescence. While H2O2 induced premature senescent-like phenotype of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), as judged by increased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal) activity, enlarged, flattened cell morphology and sustained growth arrest, our results demonstrated that Rb1 protected endothelial cells from oxidative stress induced senescence. Mechanistically, we found that Rb1 could markedly increase intracellular superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD/SOD1) activity and decrease the malondialdehyde (MDA) level in H2O2-treated HUVECs, and suppress the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Consistent with these findings, Rb1 could effectively restore the protein expression of Cu/Zn SOD, which was down-regulated in H2O2 treated cells. Taken together, our data demonstrate that Rb1 exhibits antioxidant effects and antagonizes H2O2-induced cellular senescence.									27	5	0	0	25	0	33			0918-6158			WOS:000292342100021	21720015

However, identifying the photocatalytic mechanisms by modeling photoactive nanoparticles requires sophisticated computational techniques based on multiscale modeling. In this review, we will survey the strengths and drawbacks of currently available theoretical methods at different length and accuracy scales. Understanding the surface-active site through Density Functional Theory (DFT) using new, more accurate exchange-correlation functionals plays a key role for surface engineering. Larger scale dynamics of the catalyst/electrolyte interface can be treated with Molecular Dynamics albeit there is a need for more generalizations of force fields. Monte Carlo and Continuum Modeling techniques are so far not the prominent path for modeling water splitting but interest is growing due to the lower computational cost and the feasibility to compare the modeling outcome directly to experimental data. The future challenges in modeling complex nano-photocatalysts involve combining different methods in a hierarchical way so that resources are spent wisely at each length scale, as well as accounting for excited states chemistry that is important for photocatalysis, a path that will bring devices closer to the theoretical limit of photocatalytic efficiency.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000785865400001	35439803

Electrocatalytic research showed that the 1@NF electrode shows better OER performance than RuO2@NF, reaching a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) when the overpotential of OER is was 370 mV in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, with a Tafel slope of 15.6 mV dec(-1). Moreover, the overpotential of HER of 246 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), with a Tafel slope of 23.1 mV dec(-1), also suggested that the HER performance of 1@NF is better than that of Pt/C@NF. The durability test manifested that the electrocatalytic activity of 1@NF can be maintained at 92.8% after 12 h in 1.0 M KOH. Besides, luminescence sensing experiments reveal that 1 is an efficient chemosensor, which exhibits high sensitivity, high selectivity, and good recyclability towards the detection of Cr(VI) anions in water even in the presence of other interfering anions. The detection limits are as low as 3.42 x 10(-6) M for the CrO42- anion and 2.96 x 10(-7) M for the Cr2O72- anion. The electrocatalytic and luminescence sensing properties show that 1 is an excellent candidate for multifunctional materials in energy conversion and pollutant detection.									33	0	0	0	3	0	33				1466-8033		WOS:000686539800001

Here, we extend the classical "silver-mirror" reaction to unmodified filter paper achieving a controllable deposition of Ag NPs. The Ag NPs/filter paper thus obtained was employed as an enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate achieving detection limits down to picomolar (10(-12) M) and nanomolar (10(-9) M) concentrations for rhodamine 6G and rhodamine B, with an enhancement factor (EF) of 1.42 X 10(10) and 0.659 X 10(6), respectively. To check its usage for practical applications, the substrate was extended to detect trace amounts of illicit dyes used on common vegetables and contaminants in rain, pond, and tap water with excellent reproducibility. Moreover, the as-prepared Ag paper can be directly employed for 4-nitrophenol reduction, which can be completely reduced to 4-aminophenol (4-AP) in a single step within seconds. The substrate can be reused several times over without any noticeable change in its catalytic activity. Finally, we studied the chemical transformation of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol by studying the concomitant spectral response, thereby integrating catalysis and SERS on a single substrate. This method thus provides a facile avenue to low-cost paper-based functional substrates for multimodal applications.									35	1	0	0	12	0	35			2168-0485			WOS:000482173100048

The majority of the world Sc supply is sourced from industrial byproducts, where Sc needs to be separated from other components. Phosphate precipitation is an effective separation and purification method to harvest dissolved Sc ions from acidic leachate solutions; however the obtained Sc phosphate currently has no direct application. To this end, a solid-state conversion route of Sc phosphate to oxide was investigated by using five different sodium compounds, as sodium forms very stable phosphate compounds. The thermal conversion (up to 1000 degrees C) of Sc phosphate with high melting point sodium compounds (sodium sulfate, carbonate, and chloride) yielded a stable mixed sodium-scandium phosphate phase with a formula of Na3Sc2 (PO4)(3). The thermal conversion with lower melting point sodium compounds (sodium hydroxide and nitrate) resulted in the separation of Sc from phosphate moieties, forming respectively Sc oxides (NaScO2 or Sc2O3) and sodium phosphate. In situ high temperature X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetry (TGA) were employed to investigate the solid-state conversion process by sodium nitrate. Slower heating rate (120 degrees C/h) and the evolution of oxygen gas (as a result of sodium nitrate decomposition) favored the formation of Sc2O3 phase over NaScO2 phase, and the conversion reaction was completed at 670 degrees C. The conversion process was further explored as a purification step toward Sc-containing mixed phosphate precipitates, where the impurities (aluminum and iron phosphates) were converted into sodium aluminate and ferrite and could then be separated from Sc2O3 by their differences in acid/base solubility.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0888-5885			WOS:000481568600001

Herein, a newfangled concept of presenting an interfacial electric field and atomic disorder in Co0.85Se by interface engineering is demonstrated for realizing its high-rate and large-capacity lithium storage. Transmission electron microscopy confirms the formation of abundant atomic interfaces between Co0.85Se and N-doped carbon (NC), and meanwhile, X-ray absorption near-edge structure tests disclose the negative charge shifts from Co0.85Se to NC as well as the existence of disordered Co/Se atoms and/or dangling bonds in the interface region. On one hand, the lopsided charge distribution around the atomic interface can induce an interfacial electric field, which will afford a foreign Coulomb force to facilitate the Li+ transmission, thus greatly improving high-rate capability. On the other hand, the disordered Co/Se atoms and/or dangling bonds in the interface region could act as the extra active sites to hold the lithium for increasing the specific capacity. Benefiting from this multiscale coordination regulation, Co0.85Se/NC displays high discharge specific capacity (1139 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1)), large initial Coulombic efficiency (87.9%), and excellent rate performance. This work presents a new perspective for an in-depth understanding of the atomic interface-performance relationship of Co0.85Se/NC, and meanwhile, this concept can be used for guiding the design of other energy-related electrode materials.									23	1	0	0	0	0	23			2168-0485			WOS:000460600500010

Unfortunately, the intrinsically low conductivity and large structure change of metal oxide electrodes lead to their phase segregation and serious capacity decay, which severely restrict their practical application. In this work, we designed and fabricated a unique flower-like hybrid with Co3O4 nanoparticles decorated on nitrogen-doped carbon sheets (Co3O4/NC) through a combined carbonization and oxidation approach using novel cobalt-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as precursor. The in-situ synthesis of Co3O4/NC from MOFs improves the combination between Co3O4 nanoparticles and nitrogen-doped carbonaceous substrate, ensures high structure stability and facilitates the electron and ion transport upon cycling. The as-synthesized Co3O4/NC exhibits a remarkable lithium storage performance with high reversible capacity (1145.1 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g(-1)), superior rate capability (498.8 mAh g(-1) at 4 A g(-1)) and excellent long-term cycling stability (797.5 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) and 671.1 mAh g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) after 500 cycles), which outperforms those of most of Co3O4-based electrodes reported so far.									57	4	0	0	5	0	58			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000445413900017

The surface morphology and microstructure of the IrxRu1-xO2 coatings were characterized by XRD and SEM. The electrochemical characterization of the surface was carried out in a 0.5 mol L-1 H2SO4 solution. The IrxRu1-xO2 coating with x = 0.5 showed a minimal nanocrystalline particle size and a maximum surface charge (q*). The electrochemical behaviors of the IrxRu1-xO2 coatings for oxidation of N2O4 were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV), the open circuit potential (OCP) and Tafel plot in 1.7 mol L-1 N2O4/HNO3 solutions. The open-circuit potential (E-ocp) in N2O4/HNO3 solution was about 1.18 V and it was almost independent of the surface composition. Cyclic voltammetry showed a broad wave feature at 1.4-1.8 V in the anodic scan, which was attributed to the oxidation of NO2 derived from N2O4 to NO2+. The redox couple of NO2/NO2+ showed a quasi-reversible behavior and the process was under diffusion control. The electrocatalytic activities of various IrxRu1-xO2 coatings for oxidation of N2O4 were evaluated by potentiostatic polarization curves under the quasi-steady state conditions. The Ru0.5Ir0.5O2 coating showed the lowest Tafel slope, 35.7 mV, in the low current densities, indicating that this coating had the highest electrocatalytic activity. The experiments of electrochemical synthesis of N2O5 from N2O4 in nitric acid also indicated that the Ru0.5Ir0.5O2 coating had the best electrocatalytic performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Inspection of the steady-state potential, Est reveals that the metal surface is covered by an oxide film whose composition is likely to be ReO2. In all examined solutions except H3PO4, and CH3COOH, the pre-immersion surface oxide film dissolves, whereas in these latter two solutions it grows. The presence of the dissolved oxygen acts bifunctionally on the rhenium electrode. Its effect is more pronounced in the slightly corrosive solutions such as Na2SO4. The rate of oxide film growth has been measured in acetic acid solutions and found to increase directly with the acid concentration. The relative thickness of the formed oxide film at the steady-state condition (after about 90 minutes of immersion), viz. C-1 at ac frequency, f = 20 k Hz, increases with c.A comparison of the oxide formation rates coefficients derived from capacitance measurements with those derived from potential measurements reveals that the oxide structure change with the solution composition; probably the degree of hydration of the oxide decreases with an increase of acid concentration, c.Complex plane analysis of the impedance gives the dielectric loss angle of the oxide. It was found to be in the range 40 - 58 degrees for c in the range 1.0 - 50 mM. The formed modified rhenium oxide electrode indicates a good catalytic activity towards the oxidation of methanol in acidic solutions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0449-2285	2357-0245		WOS:000602566100004

The crystal structure, bandgap and photoluminescence properties of the Ca10-xSrx (PO4)(6)F-2:Eu2+(x = 4, 6, 8) phosphors were investigated in detail. With the increase of Sr concentration, the bandgap gets narrower and the volume of crystal becomes larger. The existence of oxygen-vacancy-related defect levels in the bandgap and the bandgap reduction caused by these levels were verified by DFT calculated and experiment results. The emission spectra of samples show blue shift from 459 nm to 447 nm. Simultaneously, all of the samples have broad absorption ranging from 240 nm to 450 nm and the crests of these spectra show little blue shift from 343 nm to 337 nm. The thermal stabilities of these samples show obvious improvement (55.01%-68.24% at 150 degrees C) with the increase of Sr concentration, which indicates that the solid solution design can serve as an effective way to improve the thermal stability of apatite phosphors. In addition, a white LED device has been manufactured by connecting a 380 nm UV chip with a blend of Ca4Sr6(PO4)(6)F-2:Eu2+, (Sr,Ba)SiO4:Eu2+ and CaAISiN(3):Eu2+. The LED device shows warm white light with low color temperature (3728 K) and high color rendering index (90.21). Our results provide a practical basis to engineer and develop Eu2+-doped novel phosphors.									24	2	0	0	0	0	24			0143-7208	1873-3743		WOS:000428008700011

During the isolation process the intrinsic islet vascular networks are destroyed, leading to impaired revascularization after transplant. As a result, in some cases a significant quantity of the beta cell mass transplanted dies acutely following the infusion into the portal vein, the most clinically used site of engraftment. Subsequently, despite the majority of patients achieving insulin independence after transplant, a proportion of them recommence small, supplemental exogenous insulin over time.

In the past 40 years, various inorganic and organic systems have been developed as photocatalysts for water splitting driven by visible light. These photocatalysts, however, still suffer from low quantum efficiency and/or poor stability. We report the design and fabrication of a metal-free carbon nanodot-carbon nitride (C3N4) nanocomposite and demonstrate its impressive performance for photocatalytic solar water splitting. We measured quantum efficiencies of 16% for wavelength lambda = 420 +/- 20 nanometers, 6.29% for lambda = 580 +/- 15 nanometers, and 4.42% for lambda = 600 +/- 10 nanometers, and determined an overall solar energy conversion efficiency of 2.0%. The catalyst comprises low-cost, Earth-abundant, environmentally friendly materials and shows excellent stability.									3279	181	0	0	345	3	3335			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000349958900032	25722405

The aim of this research is to assess the effectiveness of ozonation on oxidation of micropollutant such as p-Cresol. Ozonation performance was evaluated based on p-Cresol concentration reduction and chemical oxidation demand (COD) reduction. It was found ozonation at pH11 achieved the highest p-Cresol degradation, with 95.8% of p-Cresol reduced and 96.0% of COD reduced, for an initial 50 mgL(-1) of p-Cresol. The degradation of p-Cresol could be expressed by second-order of kinetic model. The second-order rate constant k increases as the initial pH increased, but decreases with the increasing of initial p-Cresol concentrations. Besides, the absorption spectra of p-Cresol over ozonation time were analyzed by spectrophotometry. The evolution o f absorption spectra of p-Cresol degradation suggests that the oxidation of p-Cresol follows three stages mechanisms with cycloaddition as the first step to produce aromatic intermediates followed by ring-opening reactions, degradation of the intermediates, and subsequently achieved mineralization.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0126-6039			WOS:000441774500002

Here, we control the substrate temperature variation within 3 degrees C during processing by modulating the plasma-discharge time. The evolution of the cross-sectional profile of line-and-space patterns was observed every 10 s. At 60 and 100 degrees C, sidewall etching was observed during overetching, but not at 20 degrees C. During the main etching, the sidewalls were protected by the adsorption of by-products at various temperatures. Moreover, we investigated the temperature dependence of protection layer formation by analyzing the surface components of the organic film. The CN layer formed by N radicals has a protective effect that depends on the components of the CN layer. It was found that the ratio of C-N sp(3) to C-N sp(2) in the sidewall was highest at 100 degrees C. By evaluating the radical contribution to CN layer formation, C-N sp3 bonds were observed to be formed by ions and radiation-assisted reaction.

Scanning Electron Microscopy analyses, coupled with X-ray Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy show that, under proper conditions, we can overcome the limits of other deposition techniques, achieving a uniform Pt coverage throughout the 3D structure of the Ni foam. We show that such a condition, not deeply investigated in previous literature, turns out to be crucial for the long term stability of the electrodes under constant current stress. The amount of Pt on the Ni foam has been experimentally evaluated, obtaining optimal results with 0.015 mg cm(-2) of noble metal in a 0.16 cm thick electrode. Such a low amount corresponds to a Ni foam cost increase of less than 0.1%. (C) 2018 The Authors.

The interest in this compound stems from its activity on several cisplarin and oxaliplatin-resistant cell lines. Oxidation of 1 with hydrogen peroxide affords cis,trans,cis-[PtCl2(OH)(2)(cis-1,4-DACH)] (2) which was treated with succinic anhydride in suitable solvents. To our surprise, in dimethylformamide (DMF) (50-70 degrees C or under light irradiation) or in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (under light irradiation) the formation of the succinato complex cis,trans,cis-[PtCl2{OC(O)CH2CH2C(O)-OH}(2)(cis-1,4-DACH)] (3) was accompanied by reduction to 1. It was found that solvolysis of 2 and formation of a mu-oxo dinuclear species (5) is the key step. The dinuclear species can then undergo reduction to a 1:1 mixture of 1 and 2 with concomitant elimination of oxygen (1/2 O-2 in the form of H2O2). The whole process is fostered by heat and/or light, which could favor solvolysis of 2 as well as decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen so preventing the reoxidation of 1 to 2. Because of its peculiar behavior, compound 5 could be exploited also for the development of a technology for water splitting.									24	0	0	0	5	0	24			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000315763300021	23414056

One of these species, superoxide, is produced in the apoplast by respiratory burst oxidase homologues (rbohs), a family of proteins that is conserved throughout the plant kingdom. Because of the availability of mutants, the focus of research into plant rbohs has been on Arabidopsis thaliana, mainly on AtrbohD and AtrbohF. This study investigates: (i) a different member of the Atrboh family, AtrbohB, and (ii) several rbohs from the close relative of A. thaliana, Lepidium sativum (ocress'). Five cress rbohs (Lesarbohs) were sequenced and it was found that their expression patterns were similar to their Arabidopsis orthologues throughout the life cycle. Cress plants in which LesarbohB expression was knocked down showed a strong seedling root phenotype that resembles phenotypes associated with defective auxin-related genes. These transgenic plants further displayed altered expression of auxin marker genes including those encoding the auxin responsive proteins 14 and 5 (IAA14 and IAA5), and LBD16 (LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES DOMAIN16), an auxin-responsive protein implicated in lateral root initiation. It is speculated that ROS produced by rbohs play a role in root development via auxin signalling.									25	1	0	0	24	0	26			0022-0957	1460-2431		WOS:000311645700003	23095998

One promising approach to produce hydrogen is photoelectrochemical water splitting, which uses solar energy combined with suitable semiconducting photoabsorber electrodes to generate hydrogen and oxygen from water. However, most water splitting applications reported to date suffer from degradation of the photoabsorber, resulting in a loss of activity after just a few seconds or minutes. Here, a new approach using conformal ultra-thin and oxidation-stable protective layers is presented on Mo:BiVO4 thin films combined with a thin Fe0.1Ni0.9O water oxidation co-catalyst, applied by electrochemical deposition, to achieve unprecedented photocurrent densities of up to 5.6 mA cm(-2) under simulated AM1.5G illumination and a neutral pH while providing more stable electrodes for water oxidation.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000684453100001

Herein, CdxZn1-xS (x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8) nanocrystal solid solutions (NCSSs), which integrated twinning crystal structures, rich sulfur vacancies and wurtzite-sphalerite phase-junctions all in one, were prepared via a facile hydrothermal method. With these features, the twinning Cd0.6Zn0.4S performed remarkable photocatalysis for H-2 evolution (42.66 mmol h(-1) g(-1)) in Na2S/Na2SO3 aqueous solution, the rate of which was 691 times higher than those of pristine twinning CdS nanocrystals. To the best of our knowledge, this was the highest performance of H-2 evolution among the hitherto reported one-fold sulfide photocatalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested the formation of twinning crystal structures improved the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Meanwhile, stability of the Cd0.6Zn0.4S photocatalyst was largely enhanced due to the fast hole consumption by Na2S/Na2SO3 through sulfur vacancies. This work explores the interplay and mechanism of special structures, sulfur vacancies and catalytic conditions of twinning CdZnS NCSSs, and provides guidance for the design of highly efficient and stable metal-sulfide-based photocatalysts.									70	8	0	0	6	0	70			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000521346600035

Electrochemical reduction of graphene oxide (GO) significantly improves its conductivity. However, the kinetics of this process depends on the solvent, supporting electrolyte, pH, and numerous other factors. Most studies report the macroscopic views and ex-situ properties of reduced GO. To expand the knowledge about GO reduction, in this study, we used cyclic voltammetry (CV), simultaneous 2 points and 4 points resistance measurement (s24), conductive atomic force microscopy (AFM), and theoretical calculations. Using CV, we demonstrated that the choice of supporting electrolyte (KCl or LiCl) influences the potential range in which electrochemical GO reduction occurs. The activation energy of this process was estimated to be below 30 kJ mol(-1) in both electrolytes, being significantly lower than that required for thermal reduction of GO. Simultaneous in situ s24 resistance measurements suggest that GO films reach a highly conductive state at deep negative potentials, with an abrupt, irreversible switch from non-conductive to the conductive state. However, conductive AFM presents a more exact picture of this process: the reduction of GO films starts locally while the formed conductive islands grow during the reduction. This mechanism was confirmed by theoretical calculations indicating that the reduction starts on isolated oxygen-functional groups over the GO basal plane, while clustered OH groups are more difficult to reduce. The presented results can help in tailoring reduced GO for a particular electrochemical application by precisely controlling the reduction degree and percentage of the conductive area of the reduced GO films.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000782653000005

Earth-abundant, low-cost, easily recyclable, and environmentally benign light absorbers are desired for renewable fuel generation technologies, such as solar photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Hematite is considered an ideal material for PEC oxygen evolution reaction, which is a critical component in the overall water splitting process for hydrogen fuel generation. However, intrinsic and operational limitations have prevented hematite-based PEC devices from reaching their highest theoretical solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 15%-17%. Literature clearly shows that no single approach can eliminate these limitations. An overall fundamental understanding of the effect of dopant addition as well as their physical locations and functions within the photoelectrode, in both as-synthesized form and under operating conditions, is of critical importance to unleash the tremendous potentials of hematite-based PEC systems. In this short perspective, the concept of effective doping (i.e., increase of charge carrier density) up to the limit of dopant segregation at the grain boundaries to lower the charge recombination is discussed. Based on relevant theoretical and experimental data from the literature on the effects of surface-to-bulk doping as well as dopant segregation at the grain boundaries on hematite photoelectrode performance, we discuss here the views on the necessity of understanding these processes and their individual and synergistic effects to unravel a simple yet powerful approach to design and develop highly efficient hematite photoanodes for clean hydrogen generation using water and sunlight.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0003-6951	1077-3118		WOS:000720010700006

Four critical membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) parameters (cathode exchange current density, cathode utilization, ohmic resistance, and cathode limiting current density) are selected and extracted from the modeling of twenty-two polarization curves measured from nineteen MEAs, which are fabricated and operated according to an experimental protocol that Samsung developed in the mid 2000s. MEA systems adopting three representative membranes (polybenzimidazole (PBI), poly(2,5-benzimidazole) (ABPBI), polybenzoxazine (PBOA)) are compared, and the effect of monomer ratio in two representative benzoxazine-benzimidazole copolymer membranes is analyzed. The evolution of the parameters during the break-in period of MEAs and the period of 2008 to 2018, when MEA performance was improved with the same specification of catalysts and membrane, is examined. Also, the impact of PA impregnation in the cathode is investigated when PA is addi-tionally impregnated in the cathode in addition to a PA-doped membrane. Optimum values of the four param-eters are combined to simulate the highest MEA performance, and the MEA performance is predicted in some cases where the parameters are varied. Overall, this approach expands the scope of previous literature on the modeling of high temperature PEMFCs, which have been mostly based on PBI membrane systems, by introducing new parameters such as the catalyst utilization and by applying the model to various membrane systems and phenomena.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0306-2619	1872-9118		WOS:000693351800005

The single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis indicates that Co-MOF 1 exhibits an uninodal net with a (6(5).8) topology, whereas Co-MOF 2 exhibits an uninodal 4-connected framework with a (4(4).6(2)) topology. The electrochemistry studies demonstrate that both of the two Co-MOFs can behave as the efficient electrocatalysts for water oxidation in a mild neutral system at the potential around 1.20 V vs. NHE with comparatively low overpotential (eta) for Co-MOF 1 and 2 of 337-541 mV vs. NHE. Moreover, the two Co-MOFs also show good photocatalytic degradation capabilities toward MB/MV dyes under UV irradiation, and the mechanism studies demonstrate that the main active species are center dot OH radicals. Therefore, these bi-functional Co-MOFs materials can be treated as convenient and efficient catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction and aromatic dyes degradation.									9	0	0	0	6	0	9			2468-8231			WOS:000637823700002

PHD homologues exist in other types of eukaryotes and prokaryotes where they act on non HIF substrates. To gain insight into the factors underlying different PHD substrates and properties, we carried out biochemical and biophysical studies on PHD homologues from the cellular slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum, and the protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, both lacking HIF. The respective prolyl-hydroxylases (DdPhyA and TgPhyA) catalyze prolyl-hydroxylation of S-phase kinase-associated protein 1 (Skp1), a reaction enabling adaptation to different dioxygen availability. Assays with full-length Skp1 substrates reveal substantial differences in the kinetic properties of DdPhyA and TgPhyA, both with respect to each other and compared with human PHD2; consistent with cellular studies, TgPhyA is more active at low dioxygen concentrations than DdPhyA. TgSkp1 is a DdPhyA substrate and DdSkp1 is a TgPhyA substrate. No cross-reactivity was detected between DdPhyA/TgPhyA substrates and human PHD2. The human Skp1 E147P variant is a DdPhyA and TgPhyA substrate, suggesting some retention of ancestral interactions. Crystallographic analysis of DdPhyA enables comparisons with homologues from humans, Trichoplax adhaerens, and prokaryotes, informing on differences in mobile elements involved in substrate binding and catalysis. In DdPhyA, two mobile loops that enclose substrates in the PHDs are conserved, but the C-terminal helix of the PHDs is strikingly absent. The combined results support the proposal that PHD homologues have evolved kinetic and structural features suited to their specific sensing roles.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1083-351X		MEDLINE:33453893	33453893

The activity results showed that the bimetallic Mn2O3-Co3O4/C catalyst exhibits much higher activity than the monometallic Mn2O3/C and Co3O4/C catalysts for the degradation of both RB and CR pollutants, due to the synergistic properties induced by the Mn-Co and/or Mn (Co)-support interactions. The degradation efficiency of RB and CR was considerably increased with an increase of reaction temperature from 25 to 45 degrees C. Importantly, the bimetallic Mn2O3-Co3O4/C catalyst could maintain its catalytic activity up to five successive cycles, revealing its catalytic durability for wastewater purification. The structure-activity correlations demonstrated a probable mechanism for the degradation of organic dye pollutants in wastewater, involving center dot OH radical as well as Mn2+/Mn3+ or Co2+/Co3+ redox couple of the Mn2O3-Co3O4/C catalyst.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0268-2605	1099-0739		WOS:000509829400001

However, large-scale application of this method is hampered by the efficiency and the expense of the solar water splitting systems. Searching for non-toxic, low-cost, efficient and stable photocatalysts is an important way for solar water splitting. Due to the simplicity of structure and the flexibility of composition, perovskite based photocatalysts have recently attracted widespread attention for application in solar water splitting. In this review, the recent developments of perovskite based photocatalysts for water splitting are summarized. An introduction including the structures and properties of perovskite materials, and the fundamentals of solar water splitting is first provided. Then, it specifically focuses on the strategies for designing and modulating perovskite materials to improve their photocatalytic performance for solar water splitting. The current challenges and perspectives of perovskite materials in solar water splitting are also reviewed. The aim of this review is to summarize recent findings and developments of perovskite based photocatalysts and provide some useful guidance for the future research on the design and development of highly efficient perovskite based photocatalysts and the relevant systems for water splitting.									29	7	0	0	1	0	28			1674-4926			WOS:000508194200001

When polymer electrolyte electrolyzers are operated at elevated pressures, to reduce external mechanical compression needs, the thermodynamically expected cell voltage increase with pressure is not generally observed. Consequently, beneficial processes have to compensate for the increased work performed. In this paper, the influence of the operating pressure up to 100 bar on the cell voltage behavior is investigated in detail. Data from galvanotstatic polarization curves up to 4 A/cm(2) combined with high frequency resistance measurements are analyzed using a zero-dimensional Tafel model. It shows that beneficial processes with increasing pressure are related to both the kinetic and mass transport overpotentials. At current densities above 1 A/cm(2) about two thirds of the overpotential gain can be related to reaction kinetics. Based on the Tafel model approach an increase of the apparent exchange current density by a factor of 4 to 7 is observed for the pressure increase from 10 to 100 bar. In contrast, the Tafel slope is independent of pressure and only the expected increase with temperature (73 to 81 mV/dec) for 30 to 70 degrees C is observed. Mass transport losses decrease with pressure. At 50 degrees C and 2 A/cm(2), increasing the pressure from 1 to 100 bar results in a decrease of the mass transport overpotential from 130 to 80 mV.

We engineered the system by using silver phosphate (Ag3PO4) as a photocatalytic active metal oxide semiconductor and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) as a hydrophobic conducting nanostructure to form the Pickering emulsions. The photocatalytic activity of the as-formed Ag3PO4/MWNT-stabilized Pickering emulsion-based system is studied toward dye decomposition and oxygen evolution. Results imply that the Pickering emulsion-based photocatalytic system exhibits a much higher efficiency, as compared with traditional solution-dispersed photocatalytic system. This high efficiency is elucidated in terms of the unique properties inherent in Pickering emulsions including (i) the self-assembled Ag3PO4/MWNT nanohybrid at water/oil interface, well ensuring a large surface area of the photocatalyst, (ii) the use of MWNTs to facilitate the formation of amphiphilic nanostructures self-assembled at water/oil interface, promoting the charge separation of the semiconductor through the pi-pi network of MWNTs by shuttling and storing photogenerated electrons from the visible light irradiated Ag3PO4, and (iii) the separation of the product (e.g., O-2 evolved from water oxidation) from the reactants during the photocatalytic process, well accelerating the photocatalytic reactions. In addition to the high efficiency, the fast and simple procedures employed for demulsifying (e.g., sonication or centrifugation) and re-emulsifying (e.g., shaking) essentially make our Pickering emulsion-based photocatalytic system technically simple and thus practically applicable. This study opens a new way to developing novel photocatalytic systems with high efficiency and good practical applicability based on Pickering emulsion science and technology.									84	8	0	0	11	0	87			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000322503600034		
J	Pratico, D				Pratico, Domenico/ABA-9590-2020				Oxidative imbalance and lipid peroxidation in Alzheimer's disease								DRUG DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH				56	3			446	451		10.1002/ddr.10097				JUL 2002	2002	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing serious public health problem worldwide. Clinically, AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a global cognitive decline. There is significant evidence that reactive oxygen species-mediated reactions, particularly of neuronal lipids, are extensive in those AD brain areas directly involved in the disease processes. Traditional views claim that oxidative-mediated tissue injury in the AD brain is the result of neurodegeneration. In recent years, numerous investigations have pointed to the functional importance of oxidative imbalance as a crucial event in mediating AD pathogenesis. The availability of specific and sensitive markers to monitor in vivo oxidative imbalance, in combination with studies performed in living patients with clinical diagnosis of AD, are helping to elucidate these issues. Here, I summarize some of the most recent research on the relevance that oxidative imbalance and lipid peroxidation have in AD. The evidence accumulated so far clearly indicates that oxidative imbalance is an early event during the evolution of this devastating disease. This new concept implies that this phenomenon may play a more important role in AD pathogenesis than previously anticipated.									10	0	0	0	9	0	10			0272-4391	1098-2299		WOS:000178445300018

From the temperature dependence of the paramagnetic susceptibility of the non-heme ferrous iron with S = 2, the zero-field interaction parameters D and E were determined to be 5.5 +/- 1.0 and 0.75 +/- 0.75 cm(-1) respectively. These values are almost the same as those observed in a purple photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides, suggesting that the structure of the acceptor side of plant photosystem II is also similar to that of the purple photosynthetic bacterium.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0031-9015			WOS:000169623600015		
J	Nishioka, M; Law, CK				Law, Chung/E-1206-2013				A numerical study of ignition in the supersonic hydrogen/air laminar mixing layer								COMBUSTION AND FLAME				108	1-2			199	219		10.1016/S0010-2180(96)00099-5				JAN 1997	1997	The ignition evolution in the supersonic nonpremixed hydrogen/air laminar mixing layer, consisting of a relatively hot, fast air stream next to a cold, slower hydrogen stream, was computationally simulated using detailed transport and chemical reaction mechanisms and compared with results from asymptotic analysis with reduced mechanisms. The study emphasizes identifying the controlling chemical mechanisms in effecting ignition, on the relative importance of external versus viscous heating as the dominant ignition source, on the roles of thermal versus kinetic-induced ignition in which heat release and hence nonlinear thermal feedback are not needed in initiating system runaway, and on the consequences of imposing the conventional constant property assumptions in analytical studies. Results show that the state of the hydrogen/oxygen second explosion limit has the dominant influence in the system response in that, for all practical purposes, ignition is not possible when the air-stream temperature is lower than the crossover temperature, even allowing for viscous heating. On the, other hand, when the air-stream temperature is higher than the crossover temperature, the predicted ignition distance indicates that ignition is feasible within practical supersonic combustion engines. Furthermore, for the latter situations, the ignition event is initiated by radical proliferation and hence runaway instead of thermal runaway. Finally, it is shown that, while the present computed results qualitatively agree well with those from the asymptotic analysis with reduced mechanisms, the analytically predicted ignition distances are much shorter than the computed values because the analysis has overemphasized the viscous effect through the constant Chapman-Rubesin parameter pp and unity Prandtl number assumptions.

J	Takakuwa, Y; Ishida, F; Kawawa, T								Phase transition from Langmuir-type adsorption to two-dimensional oxide island growth during oxidation on Si(001) surface								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				216	1-4			133	140		10.1016/S0169-4332(03)00501-4				JUN 30 2003	2003	The phase transition from Langmuir-type adsorption to two-dimensional (2D) oxide island growth during initial oxidation on the Si(001) surface was investigated by real-time Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) combined with reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED). Curve-fitting analysis of the oxygen uptake curve obtained by O-KLL Auger electron intensity revealed that the phase transition occurs steeply at similar to630 degreesC and no oxidation occurs after completion of 2D growth of oxide islands, whereas oxides grows gradually at the interface following Langmuir-type adsorption. It was observed that the very thin oxide layer grown at 616 degreesC is more easily decomposed than that grown at 653 degreesC in spite of almost the same thickness. Furthermore, the RHEED intensity ratio between half-order spots indicated that etching of the surface starts suddenly just at the phase transition temperature of similar to630 degreesC. The steepness of the phase transition, the sudden start of SiO desorption and the difference in the interfacial oxidation and decomposition between two oxidation schemes are comprehensively interpreted using a surface reaction model in which O-2 adsorption on the Si(001) 2 x 1 surface changes drastically from barrier-less adsorption into dimer backbonds for Langmuir-type adsorption to formation of desorption precursor SiO* in pairs with dimer vacancies for 2D oxide island growth, and coalescence of SiO* leads to nucleation and 2D growth of oxide islands.

It has, therefore, remained as a challenging issue in two-dimensional (2D) chemistry and physics communities. In this study, an "atomic monolayer of g-C3N4 with perfect two-dimensional limit" was successfully prepared by the chemically well-defined two-step routes. The atomically resolved monolayer of g-C3N4 was also confirmed by spectroscopic and microscopic analyses. In addition, the experimental Cs-HRTEM image was collected, for the first time, which was in excellent agreement with the theoretically simulated; the evidence of monolayer of g-C3N4 in the perfect 2D limit becomes now clear from the HRTEM image of orderly hexagonal symmetry with a cavity formed by encirclement of three adjacent heptazine units. Compared to bulk g-C3N4, the present g-C3N4 monolayer showed significantly higher photocatalytic generation of H2O2 and H-2, and electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction. In addition, its photocatalytic efficiency for H 2 0 2 production was found to be the best for any known g-C3N4 nanomaterials, underscoring the remarkable advantage of monolayer formation in optimizing the catalyst performance of g-C3N4.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000750828800001	35113289

In this work, we examine the core-collapse supernovae production of the 15 SLRs produced: Al-26, Cl-36, Ca-41, Mn-53, Fe-60, Nb-92, Tc-97, Tc-98, Pd-107, Sn-126, I-129, Cs-135, Sm-146, Hf-182, and Pb-205. We probe the impact of the uncertainties of the core-collapse explosion mechanism by examining a collection of 62 core-collapse models with initial masses of 15, 20, and 25 M-circle dot, explosion energies between 3.4 x 10(50) and 1.8 x 10(52) erg and compact remnant masses between 1.5 and 4.89 M-circle dot. We identify the impact of both explosion energy and remnant mass on the final yields of the SLRs. Isotopes produced within the innermost regions of the star, such as Nb-92 and Tc-97, are the most affected by the remnant mass, Nb-92 varying by five orders of magnitude. Isotopes synthesized primarily in explosive C-burning and explosive He-burning, such as Fe-60, are most affected by explosion energies. Fe-60 increases by two orders of magnitude from the lowest to the highest explosion energy in the 15 M-circle dot model. The final yield of each examined SLR is used to compare to literature models.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000770034000001

In this work, we report the synthesis, structural characterization and electrocatalytic water oxidation performances of mesoporous NiO/NiFe2O4 nanorods. It is found that different calcination temperature of NiFe-based coordination polymer leads to various structural composites and completely preserves the original nanorod-like morphology of coordination polymer precursor. The nanorods obtained at 350 degrees C identified as NiO/NiFe2O4 have the largest surface area of 191.5 m(2) g(-1) with an average pore size of 6.4 nm. When used as oxygen evolving catalyst in water splitting, NiO/NiFe2O4 nanorods are found to exhibit the highest electrocatalytic water oxidation activity in basic media compared to the composites obtained at other temperatures, even much better than those of individual NiO or NiFe2O4 as well as commercial RuO2 and IrO2. The current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is met at an overpotential of 302 mV with a Tafel slope of 42 mV dec(-1). The excellent electrocatalytic performance could be attributed to the synergetic benefits of biphasic NiO/NiFe2O4 mesoporous structure and large surface area, which offer pathways for easy accessibility of electrolytes and fast mass/charge transportation.

The structure evolution of as-deposited and annealed films had been characterized by the Raman spectroscopy, XPS and FTIR. A progressive increase of sp(2) carbon sites and a reduction of sp(3) with the increase of the annealing temperature were expected. However, the Si/O co-doping was found to be able to reduce the graphitization degree of the annealed films. After annealing at 400 degrees C, the decrease rate of sp(3) fraction of a-C:H film was 14.2%, while the a-C:H:Si:O (0.93 at.% Si) film was 8.16% and the a-C:H:Si:O (3.62 at.% Si) film was 6.8%. To understand the mechanism on the improved thermal stability by Si/ O co-doping, the structure and residual stress of the a-C:H and a-C:H:Si:O films were analyzed. The results revealed that silicon atoms were incorporated into the carbon network by substituting carbon atoms of the films, which had also been characterized contributed to produce the C-Si sp(3) bonds stabilized by the oxygen. Residual stress characterization also demonstrated that, the residual stress of the a-C:H:Si:O films was greatly reduced compared with that of the a-C:H films. Therefore, the fraction of the highly strained C-C sp(3) bonds, which were more likely to break at elevated temperature, was reduced in the a-C:H:Si:O films. This kind of structure evolution endowed the a-C:H:Si:O films higher hardness and adhesion at high temperature.									9	1	0	0	0	0	10			0925-9635	1879-0062		WOS:000570170000001

Herein, the design of a novel spatially separated Ni2P co-catalyst decorated SiO2/Ni2P/rGO/Cd0.5Zn0.5S yolk-shell structural photocatalytic nanoreactor is reported. In this system, the advantages of ultrathin mesoporous shell and yolk-shell structure not only facilitate the mass diffusion with short length, but also allow broad-spectrum light absorption and increase the density of catalytic active sites. Importantly, the photo-generated electrons can be directionally injected from the outermost Cd0.5Zn0.5S shell to the spatially separated Ni2P co-catalyst. The dynamic behaviors of photo-induced charge carriers can be rationally regulated by the suitable energy level alignment and the built-in electric fields derived from both sides of embedded rGO interlayer. The synergistic effects of the excellent light-harvesting ability, more exposed active sites and improved charge separation efficiency significantly boosted the photocatalytic performances of hydrogen evolution. As a result, the optimal SiO2/Ni2P/rGO/Cd0.5Zn0.5S composite exhibited the highest hydrogen generation of 11.65 mmoL.g(-1).h(-1), even after five cycles. This work proposes new insights into the design of the efficient hollow sphere structural heterojunctions for photocatalytic water splitting applications.									15	2	0	0	3	0	15			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000607584800006

However, the thickening passivation layer in Ti substrates in acidic electrolytes accelerates the deactivation of whole Ti-based anodes. In order to block the attack from the reactive oxygen species, a compact interlayer containing ternary metal oxides (SnO2, TiO2, and Nb2O5, STN) on Ti foil (denoted as Ti-STN) was prepared via a facile thermal-decomposition method. The SnO2, TiO2, and Nb2O5 components impose the mutual restriction of grain growth during the pyrolytic synthetic progress, which promotes the grain refinement of STN interlayers. Due to the compact and stable STN interlayers, the Ti-STN substrate and the Ti-STN-derived active anodes presented an enhanced corrosion resistance and prolonged service lives. Hence, we believe that the Ti-STN substrate and the grain-refinement method to resist electrochemical corrosion in this work offer new approaches for the development of industrial electrolysis and electrochemical energy conversion devices.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000797959300022	35389614

[Fe/O] and [Fe/Mg] ratios and the history of star formation in the solar neighborhood								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				358	2			671	681						JUN 2000	2000	The accurate O, Mg and Fe abundances derived in previous papers of this series from a homogeneous reanalysis of high quality data for a large sample of stars are combined with stellar kinematics in order to discuss the history of star formation in the solar neighborhood. We found that the Fe/O and Fe/Mg abundance ratios are roughly constant in the (inner) halo and the thick disk; this means that the timescale of halo collapse was shorter than or of the same order of typical lifetime of progenitors of type Ia SNe (similar to 1 Gyr), this conclusion being somewhat relaxed (referring to star formation in the individual fragments) in an accretion model for the Galaxy formation. Both Fe/O and Fe/Mg ratios raised by similar to 0.2 dex while the O/H and Mg/H ratios hold constant during the transition from the thick to thin disk phases, indicating a sudden decrease in star formation in the solar neighbourhood at that epo;ch. These results are discussed in the framework of current views of Galaxy formation; they fit in a scenario where both dissipational collapse and accretions were active on a quite similar timescale.									131	2	5	0	0	0	137			0004-6361			WOS:000088182700039

However, filamentous cable bacteria display a unique metabolism in which redox transformations in distant cells are coupled via long-distance electron transport rather than an exchange of chemicals. This challenges our understanding of organismal functioning, as the link among electron transfer, metabolism, energy conservation, and filament growth in cable bacteria remains enigmatic. Here, we show that cells within individual filaments of cable bacteria display a remarkable dichotomy in biosynthesis that coincides with redox zonation. Nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry combined with C-13 (bicarbonate and propionate) and N-15-ammonia isotope labeling reveals that cells performing sulfide oxidation in deeper anoxic horizons have a high assimilation rate, whereas cells performing oxygen reduction in the oxic zone show very little or no label uptake. Accordingly, oxygen reduction appears to merely function as a mechanism to quickly dispense of electrons with little to no energy conservation, while biosynthesis and growth are restricted to sulfide-respiring cells. Still, cells can immediately switch roles when redox conditions change, and show no differentiation, which suggests that the "community service" performed by the cells in the oxic zone is only temporary. Overall, our data reveal a division of labor and electrical cooperation among cells that has not been seen previously in multicellular organisms.									24	1	0	0	20	0	26			0027-8424			WOS:000519530400054	32094191

This review provides an overview of the current literature pertaining to the impacts of nZVI applications on microbial communities. Toxicity studies suggest that cell membrane disruption and oxidative stress through the generation of Fe2+ and reactive oxygen species by nZVI are the main mechanisms contributing to nZVI cytotoxicity. In addition, nZVI has been shown to substantially alter the taxonomic and functional composition of indigenous microbial communities. However, because the physicochemical conditions encountered in situ highly modulate nZVI toxicity, a better understanding of the environmental factors affecting nZVI toxicity and transport in the environment is of primary importance in evaluating the ecological consequences that could result from a more extensive use of nZVI.

The thus produced hydrogen can be used either directly as a fuel or as a reducing agent in chemical processes, such as in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Water splitting can be realized both at low temperatures (typically below 100 degrees C) and at high temperatures (steam water electrolysis at 500-1000 degrees C), while different ionic agents can be electrochemically transferred during the electrolysis process (OH-, H+, O2-). Singular requirements apply in each of the electrolysis technologies (alkaline, polymer electrolyte membrane and solid oxide electrolysis) for ensuring high electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability. The aim of the present article is to provide a brief overview on the effect of the nature and structure of the catalyst-electrode materials on the electrolyzer's performance. Past findings and recent progress in the development of efficient anode and cathode materials appropriate for large-scale water electrolysis are presented. The current trends, limitations and perspectives for future developments are summarized for the diverse electrolysis technologies of water splitting, while the case of CO2/H2O co-electrolysis (for synthesis gas production) is also discussed.

To date, reports on the use of DAAO to enhance glyphosate resistance in plants are lacking. In this paper, we report synthesis, and codon usage optimization for plant expression, of the DAAO gene by successive polymerase chain reaction from Bradyrhizobium japonicum. To confirm the glyphosate resistance of the DAAO gene, the recombinant plasmid pYPX251 (GenBank Accession No: AY178046) harboring the wild-type DAAO gene was transformed into DH5 alpha. The positive transformants grew well both on solid and in liquid M9 medium containing 200 mM glyphosate. The optimized DAAO gene was transformed into Arabidopsis and 9 days after application of 10 mM glyphosate, the 4-week-old wild-type plants all died; by contrast, transgenic plants could grow normally. The proline content and peroxidase activity showed that glyphosate could induce proline accumulation and produce reactive oxygen species.									13	1	0	0	14	0	14			0721-7714	1432-203X		WOS:000364530300003	26350405

Microbial symbiosis is known to have played an important role in eukaryote evolution, favouring host adaptation under changing environmental conditions. We selected mangrove brachyuran crabs as a model group to investigate the prokaryotes associated with the gill of crabs dwelling at different tidal levels (subtidal, intertidal and supratidal). In these animals, the gill undergoes a high selective pressure, finely regulating multiple physiological functions during both animal submersion under and emersion from the periodical tidal events. We hypothesize that similarly to other marine animals, the gills of tidal crabs are consistently colonized by prokaryotes that may quantitatively change along the environmental gradient driven by the tides. Using electron microscopy techniques, we found a thick layer of prokaryotes over the gill surfaces of all of 12 crab species from the mangrove forests of Saudi Arabia, Kenya and South Africa. We consistently observed two distinct morphotypes (rod- and spherical-shaped), positioned horizontally and/or perpendicularly to the gill surface. The presence of replicating cells indicated that the prokaryote layer is actively growing on the gill surface. Quantitative analysis of scanning electron microscopy images and the quantification of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene by qPCR revealed a higher specific abundance of prokaryote cells per gill surface area in the subtidal species than those living in the supratidal zone. Our results revealed a correlation between prokaryote colonization of the gill surfaces and the host lifestyle. This finding indicates a possible role of prokaryote partnership within the crab gills, with potential effects on animal adaptation to different levels of the intertidal gradient present in the mangrove ecosystem.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000795453600091	35421185

The novel porous TiO2 nanoflowers (NFs) photocatalysts with stable bronze (TiO2(B))/anatase heterophase junctions and large pore sizes are prepared via a hydrothermal/annealing method. The presence of porous nanoflower structure enhances the light absorption through reflection/refraction of light. The stable TiO2(B)/anatase heterophase junctions can efficiently promote the separation of photoinduced electrons and holes pairs and therefore suppress the charge recombination. The large pore sizes provide multi-level channels for the absorption and diffusion of reactants. With the increase of annealing temperatures from 350 to 550 degrees C, the H-2 evolution activity is promoted. However, overhigh annealing temperature (650 degrees C) cause the broken of nanoflower structure and TiO2(B)/anatase heterophase junctions, thus inducing even decrease of H-2 evolution activity. As a consequence, the obtained TiO2 NFs exhibit an enhanced photocatalytic H-2 evolution activity at the optimal annealing temperature (550 degrees C) with Pt as co-catalysts (5.013 mmol h(-1) g(-1)) exceeding that of TiO2 NFs without annealing (0 mmol h(-1) g(-1)) and pure anatase TiO2 NFs (TiO2 Ws-650 degrees C, 4.722 mmol h(-2) g(-1)), respectively. Interestingly, TiO2 NFs-550 degrees C still show a high hydrogen evolution rate of 4.317 mmol h(-1) g(-1) in the absence of co-catalysts. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

This unique 3D hierarchical structure and the strong interfacial coupling between the NiFe-LDH and Co@NC-CNTs facilitate the transport of oxygen species as well as electrons and achieve synergy between the integrated nano-scaled structures with different functional components. As expected, a large peak power density of 194 mW cm-2 and outstanding durability for 760 h are obtained in the as-assembled rechargeable Zn-air battery. The resultant water splitting device acquires a cell voltage of 1.66 V at 10 mA cm-2 and the as-assembled Zn-air battery has been successfully employed in a selfpower water splitting system, demonstrating a great potential prospect for practical renewable energy applications.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000810450700002

Oxygen pressure and substrate temperature were varied as the parameters of the reactive evaporation. The combined electron spectroscopic results indicate that for In deposition onto room-temperature substrate surfaces and P(O2) < 5 x 10(-5) mbar the interfacial layer contains metallic In and oxidized Si, but that for higher P(O2) the metallic In concentration at the interface is reduced. The oxidation of In appears to be enhanced away from the In-Si interface, and for P(O2) > 5 X 10(-5) mbar the oxide stoichiometry approaches that of In2O3. At elevated substrate temperature (250-degrees-C) the growth rate of In oxide layers is reduced as compared to room temperature, but the oxidation yield at the interface is enhanced. For P(O2) = 2 x 10(-4) mbar and 250-degrees-C substrate temperature the growth of a uniform near-stoichiometric In oxide layer is indicated.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0021-8979			WOS:A1994NX40000087

MECHANISMS OF PHOTOSENSITIZATION OF HUMAN LEUKEMIC-CELLS BY DIAMINOANTHRAQUINONES - SINGLET OXYGEN AND RADICAL REACTIONS								JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY B-BIOLOGY				15	4			317	335		10.1016/1011-1344(92)85138-K				SEP 15 1992	1992	The synthesis of several aminoanthraquinone derivatives (AAQs), designed to suppress the dark toxicity and to promote more efficient cancer cell photosensitization for potential use in photodynamic therapy (PDT), is described. The following AAQs were synthesized: 1-NH2-4,5-(MeO)2-AQ (1), 1,5-(NH2)2-4,8-(MeO)2-AQ (2), 1,8-(NH2)2-4,5-(MeO)2-AQ (3), and 1,5-(NHPhMe)2-4,8-(Meo)2-AQ (8). The agents exhibit strong absorption in the region 480-620 nm. Possible mechanisms of photosensitization were studied by measuring O-1(2) phosphorescence at 1270 nm, detecting superoxide radicals employing an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)-spin trapping technique, and measuring oxygen consumption during the photo-oxidation of a representative biological electron donor, NADH. Strong phosphorescence from O-1(2) was observed upon illumination of 2 and 3 in C6H6 (quantum yield of 0.25 and 0.5 respectively), and in EtOH (quantum yield of 0.23 and 0.34). The 1-amino-AQ (1) was the weakest O-1(2) sensitizer, with quantum yield of 0.13 in benzene. No phosphorescence was observed in EtOH. A superoxide radical was detected as a spin adduct of 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) in irradiated benzene solutions of 1, 2 or 3 and DMPO. AAQs 2 and 3 sensitized photo-oxidation of NADH in H2O/EtOH mixture with the intermediacy of singlet oxygen as judged by the effect of sodium azide on the photostimulated oxygen consumption. Evolution of O2 upon addition of catalase to the illuminated solution confirmed the ultimate formation of hydrogen peroxide. These findings suggested that the (di)amino-dimethoxyanthraquinones might exert photosensitization via both Type I and Type II mechanisms. The AAQs were tested for their ability to photosensitize K562 human chronic myeloid leukemic cells in culture. Viability was measured using the 3,4,5-diethylthiazol-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium blue assay, and DNA and possible membrane damage were assessed. The results from illuminating cells with light >475 nm show that for the 1,5-compounds, the presence of methoxy substituents at 4,8 positions reduces the dark toxicity from ID50 of 23 to 250 muM and for the 1,8-compounds correspondingly from ID50 of 53 to >300 muM. In the 1,5-series this decrease of the dark toxicity is accompanied by an increase in light-induced dose modification from 8.85 to 14.4.Differences exist in the mechanisms of cytotoxicity between the prototype phenolic AAQs and their methoxy counterparts. It appears that the cytotoxic action of the latter causes cell damage by the formation of a high proportion of alkali labile sites in addition to frank strand breaks. No evidence for membrane damage, as determined by transport of the model amino acid cycloleucine, could be observed even at supralethal doses.									28	0	0	0	12	0	28			1011-1344			WOS:A1992JR29900004	1331388

TMOs comprise many earth-abundant minerals and have been used for millenia as construction materials, pigments, lubricants, for heat management and many other applications. In TMOs, the transition metal s electrons are strongly pulled by oxygen, and consequently the structural, physical and chemical properties are mostly determined by the strongly correlated d electrons. TMOs are also highly tunable owing to the diversity of their chemical composition, crystal structure and relative ease in inducing oxygen defects. Two dimensional (2D) TMOs often show different physical and chemical properties in comparison to their bulk counterparts. These differences give rise to a variety of remarkable electronic properties such as high temperature superconductivity and multiferroicity and also unique optical, mechanical and thermal phenomena. Additionally, reducing the thickness of TMOs can alter their catalytic and chemical characteristics. Despite their unique properties, single- and few-layer TMOs have received relatively little attention compared to other recent families of atomically thin materials such as layered transition metal dichalcogenides. The overarching aim of this review is to bring the unique aspects of TMOs to the attention of the research community to establish a strong future for research on 2D and layered TMOs. In this review, a comprehensive overview regarding 2D and layered TMOs will be presented. The fundamentals and applications of planar TMOs are discussed. The manuscript will also present future prospects and pathways to new developments that are offered by such TMOs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we proposed an effective strategy of adopting quantum confinement effect and site-selective doping to realize simultaneous hydrogen and oxygen production from pure water over polymeric carbon nitride (CN) photocatalysts. Selectively doping P atoms in the corner-carbon sites provided efficient charge transfer channels between different structural units. Meanwhile, the site-selective P doping could generate mid-gap states below the conduction band of CN, which extended the utilization of visible light up to 600 nm, and served as trapping centres to inhibit the charge recombination. In addition, the quantum confinement effect could ensure the sufficient driving force for the rate-determining water oxidation. As a consequence, the hydrogen production rate from overall water splitting reached 619.5 mu mol.h(-1) g(-1) under simulated sunlight irradiation, with notable apparent quantum yields of 6.8% at 400 nm and 2.4% at 500 nm.									40	2	0	0	0	0	40			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000496897000004

Experiments were conducted in a smog chamber at 298 K and atmospheric pressure. Lactone's decay was followed by gas chromatography with a mass spectrometric detector (GC-MS), and the temporal evolution of the SOA was monitored using a fast mobility particle sizer (FMPS). The SOA yield increases slightly when the initial GVL concentration increases. On the other hand, SOA formation is minor for GBL, and it rises slightly at low concentrations. In the case of GVL, the organic aerosol formation can be tentatively expressed by a one-product gas/particle partitioning absorption model. The particle number concentration, mass and yield decrease in the presence of NO but increase at higher relative humidity (RH) and seed surface area within the studied range. Acetic acid and succinic anhydride for GVL, and succinic anhydride for GBL were experimentally identified as oxidation products both in gas and particle phase using thermal desorption followed by GC-MS. Moreover, the theoretical studies carried out to complement the experimental results indicate that H-abstraction at the carbon site adjacent to the heterocyclic oxygen is the predominant pathway, being even more favourable when H2O was added. Also, under atmospheric conditions, the opening of the ring of the corresponding oxy-radicals and their subsequent fragmentation could be the possible explanation for the formation of detected products and the higher yield of SOA in the presence of H2O and absence of NO. Considering these results, the formation of SOA from the use of both lactones as potential biofuels is few significative, although SOA generation may be enhancement by particle-phase heterogeneous reactions catalyzed by humidity and the acidity of seed aerosols present in real atmosphere.

Globular polypyrrole microstructures of size <5 mu m are grown on stainless steel (SS-304) substrate by electro-polymerisation of pyrrole on oxygen microbubble templates electrochemically generated and stabilised in the presence of surfactant/supporting electrolyte/dopant beta-naphthalene sulfonic acid (beta-NSA). Microstructures obtained with scan range of 0-1.6 V (against Ag/AgCl) are uniformly distributed over the surface with high coverage density of 5 x 10(5) to 8 x 10 cm(-2). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the formed microstructures are of beta-NSA doped PPy. Scanning electron microscopy showed the uniform spread and good coverage of microstructures over the substrate. Supercapacitor properties of PPy films are investigated by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic charge/discharge methods with 1.0 M KCl as electrolyte in a three-electrode electrochemical cell. Specific capacitance of 583 Fg(-1) is obtained, which is greater than the values (350-400 Fg(-1) highest) usually reported for this material.

New Chemoresistive Gas Sensors with Active Elements Prepared by Layer-by-Layer Chemical Assembly with the Participation of Reagent Solutions and Their Analytical Capabilities								JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				77	3			257	276		10.1134/S1061934822030108				MAR 2022	2022	A review of new results on the application of layer-by-layer (LbL) chemical assembly procedures to the production of thin-layer structures on the surfaces of various substrates in order to develop active elements (AEs) of chemoresistive gas sensors for the determination of inorganic and organic compounds in air and controlled gas atmospheres is presented. The LbL assembly procedures and their features, such as the possibility of synthesis under the conditions of soft chemistry, the precise setting of the thicknesses of applied layers, and the production of multilayers consisting of individual layers with predicted compositions, are considered. Charge transfer between analyte molecules in the layers and oxidation-reduction centers on the AE surface is briefly discussed, and conditions for the functioning of optimal AEs are formulated. The capabilities of the LbL assembly method to precisely control the thickness of each layer in a multilayer system on the electrode surface and thus directionally change the sensor response and select a layer responsible for the best practically important characteristics are emphasized. The role of catalysts in these processes is noted. The results of original publications on the application of LbL assembly procedures to the development of a wide range of AEs for sensors are presented, and the analytical characteristics of the sensors are compared. In conclusion, the prospects for using these procedures in the manufacture of new AEs with high sensitivity and selectivity and a short response time are considered.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1061-9348	1608-3199		WOS:000776732300001

Oxygen evolving at the Ti-and-P-doped hematite/TCO-based photoanode and hydrogen at the cupric oxide/GDL-based photocathode are separated by an anion exchange polymer electrolyte membrane placed between them. The effect of the aforementioned co-catalysts was studied in a complete PEC cell in the presence of the ionomer dispersion and the anionic membrane to evaluate their impact under practical conditions. Notably, different amounts of Ni or NiCu co-catalysts were used to improve the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics and the overall solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of the photoelectrochemical cells. At -0.6 V, in the bias-assisted region, the photocurrent density reaches about 2 mA cm(-2) for a cell with 12 mu g cm(-2) of Ni loading, followed by 1.75 mA cm(-2) for the cell configuration based on 8 mu g cm(-2) of NiCu. For the best-performing cell, enthalpy efficiency at -0.4 V reaches a first maximum value of 2.03%. In contrast, the throughput efficiency, which is a ratio between the power output and the total power input (solar + electric) provided by an external source, calculated at -1.225 V, reaches a maximum of 10.75%. This value is approximately three times higher than the best results obtained in our previous studies without the use of co-catalysts at the photocathode.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2073-4344		WOS:000725832900001

Nevertheless, intrinsic low conductivity, notorious shuttle effect, and sluggish redox kinetics of sulfur cathode greatly impede their commercialization. Herein, we design and demonstrate a powerful combined strategy to build a novel hybrid architecture for hosting sulfur, which are achieved by growing Ni2P nanodot-enriched 3D graphene-like carbon onto carbon fiber paper (NP-3DGC@CFP) via a facile one-step carbonization approach. In the integrated NP-3DGC@CFP/S electrode: micro-mesoporous 3DGC provides abundant space and complicated pore structures to accommodate sulfur and physically confine polysulfide species; polar Ni2P nanodots chemically immobilize the lithium polysulfides and accelerate electrochemical reaction kinetics; flexible CFP serves as mechanical scaffold to support the electrode and avoids binder-related limitations. As a result, self-supported NP-3DGC@CFP/S cathode demonstrates an excellent combination of capacity, rate, cycling endurance (1409.4 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, 538.2 mAh g(-1) at 5 C, 786.3 mAh g(-1) with 72.7% retention at 0.5 C for 300 cycles) and anti-self-discharge capability. Significantly, such cathode also shows satisfied cycling stability at a high sulfur loading of 6.5 mg cm(-2) or at a high rate of 2 C, demonstrating its bright perspective for practical application.

However, the chemical inertness of CO2 renders many electrochemical and photochemical conversion processes inefficient. We report a transition metal dichalcogenide nanoarchitecture for catalytic electrochemical CO2 conversion to carbon monoxide ( CO) in an ionic liquid. We found that tungsten diselenide nanoflakes show a current density of 18.95 milliamperes per square centimeter, CO faradaic efficiency of 24%, and CO formation turnover frequency of 0.28 per second at a low overpotential of 54 millivolts. We also applied this catalyst in a light-harvesting artificial leaf platform that concurrently oxidized water in the absence of any external potential.									586	42	0	0	42	0	595			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000380583600035	27471300

Here we report the use of "tender" X-ray ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) to characterize a thin film of Ni-Fe oxyhydroxide electro-deposited on Au as the working electrode at different applied potentials in 0.1 M KOH as the electrolyte. Our results show that the as-prepared 7 urn thick Ni-Fe (50% Fe) film contains Fe and Ni in both their metallic as well as oxidized states, and undergoes further oxidation when the sample is subjected to electrochemical oxidation reduction cycles. Metallic Fe is oxidized to Fe3+ and metallic Ni to Ni2+/3+. This work shows that it is possible to monitor the chemical nature of the Ni Fe catalyst as a function of potential when the corresponding current densities are small. This allows for operando measurements just above the onset of OER; however, current densities as they are desired in photoelectrochemical devices (similar to 1-10 mA cm(-2)) could not be achieved in this work, due to ohmic losses in the thin electrolyte film. We use a two-dimensional model to describe the spatial distribution of the electrochemical potential, current density, and pH as a function of the position above the electrolyte meniscus, to provide guidance toward enabling the acquisition of operando APXPS at high current density. The shifts in binding energy of water with applied potential predicted by the model are in good agreement with the experimental values.									247	9	0	0	22	0	251			1932-7447			WOS:000369772900024		
C	Schaupp, Christoph; Friedrich, Rainer						Wagner, S; Steinmetz, M; Bode, A; Brehm, M		Large-Eddy Simulation of Plane Jet Injection into Supersonic Turbulent Crossflow								HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING, GARCH/MUNICH 2007								349	363		10.1007/978-3-540-69182-2_28				2009	2009	Various aspects of airbreathing propulsion systems for use in future space transportation systems, based on scramjet concepts involving combustion of fuel in a supersonic air flow, have been under investigation in the past. In most combustion chamber designs, gaseous fuel is injected at an angle into the air flow, from ports in the duct wall or in some kind of strut or pylon extending into the duct. Although the mixing characteristics of the underlying, more general jet-in-crossflow configuration together with the penetration depth of the jets have great impact on proper combustion of the fuel and correct operation of such a propulsion device, most time-accurate numerical investigations on the transversely injected jet have been carried out for incompressible flow. Numerical work on the supersonic injection flow field is mostly limited to solution of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. There is thus a need for numerical investigation of the supersonic jet-in-crossflow situation using accurate numerical methods and resolving details of the temporal evolution of the flow. The aim of the present project is to perform large-eddy simulations of the injection of a plane jet into a supersonic flow, using discretization methods of high order of accuracy in both space and time. A mixture of H-2 and N-2 is injected transversely from a spanwise slot into an air flow in a channel, where reaction with oxygen and heat release take place. The computations are expected to provide detailed information on the physics of this flow, which includes regions of separation, shock-turbulence interaction and turbulence-combustion interaction. Preliminary results together with a description of the computational setup will be presented here.					3rd Joint HLRB and KONWIHR Status and Result Workshop3rd Joint HLRB and KONWIHR Status and Result Workshop	DEC 03-04, 2007DEC 03-04, 2007		Garching, GERMANYGarching, GERMANY	1	0	0	0	0	0	1					978-3-540-69181-5	WOS:000262405000028

Annealing of the electrodeposits was performed under nitrogen, at different temperatures ranging from 523 to 773 K. By using solid state characterization techniques (X-lay diffraction and scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy), the influence of the annealing temperature on the morphological and structural properties of the electrodeposits has been investigated. For all the studied temperatures, more than one phase was always obtained.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1432-8488			WOS:000086152700007

Quantum yields for Ad formation are reported as a function of [DMHD], [DCA], and methyl iodide concentration, [MeI]. Fluorescence quantum yields and lifetimes of DCA and (DCA/DMHD) singlet exciplex as a function of [Mel] are also reported. Transient absorption measurements reveal the time evolution of excited DCA singlet, (1)DCA*, and triplet, (3)DCA*, states and of the (DCA/DMHD) singlet exciplex, (1)(DCA . DMHD)*. They show that the dominant decay path from (1)(DCA . DMHD)* gives (3)DCA*. Quenching of (1)DCA* and exciplex fluorescence and transient absorption by Mel are observed. The dependence of Ad quantum yields on [DMHD] and the strict proportionality between product quantum yields and exciplex fluorescence quantum yields at different [MeI] establish a singlet mechanism for adduct formation. Assuming that Ad is a primary photoproduct, the results are consistent with Yang's proposal of stepwise collapse of polar exciplexes to seemingly forbidden cycloadducts. A singlet biradical could be the intermediate, but intersystem crossing of the singlet exciplex to a triplet biradical as the initial step cannot be ruled out. The loss of DCA is enhanced at very high [DMHD] but oxygen quenching experiments show that this enhancement does not involve formation of the triplet biradical by addition of (3)DCA* to DMHD.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			0002-7863			WOS:A1995RU81800003		
J	SHEU, BR; STRONGIN, DR								ADSORPTION AND THERMAL-DECOMPOSITION OF METHANOL ON THE (100) SURFACE OF NIAL - A COMPARISON TO NIAL(110)								JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				154	2			379	390		10.1006/jcat.1995.1180				JUL 1995	1995	The surface reactivity of the (100) plane of stoichiometric NiAl toward methanol has been investigated with temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS and UPS), and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). The atomic composition of the outermost surface of NiAl(100) is predominately Al, in contrast to the (110) plane of NiAl which is capped by an outermost layer that contains both Al and Ni. In an effort to understand the effects of the atomic composition of the surface on reactivity, results for CH3OH/NiAl(100) are compared to prior results for CH3OH/NiAl(110). Methanol chemisorption on both planes of NiAl, at 120 K, is primarily associative (some dissociation cannot be ruled out). Chemisorbed methanol transforms into surface methoxy in the temperature interval of 120 and 200 K on both NiAl(100) and NiAl(110). On the (110) surface, subsequent C-H and C-O bond breaking steps at higher temperatures lead to the evolution of gaseous H-2, CO, CH4, CH3 radicals, and small amounts of C2H4, in addition to the deposition of surface oxygen and carbon. The peak temperature of CH4 desorption from NiAl(110) is near 350 K and the maximum rate of CH3 radical desorption is located at 570 K. In contrast, methoxy decomposition on the NiAl(100) surface generates a much smaller amount of CH4 and the reaction channel leading to gaseous CO is completely suppressed. The presence of Ni atoms in the top layer of the (110) surface is suspected to be responsible for both CH4 and CO production on NiAl(110).

It exhibited larger specific surface area and produced higher photocatalytic hydrogen than other forms of Ta2O5 samples. In addition, although the specific surface area of the porous Ta2O5 hollow fiber was smaller than that of TiO2-P25, its hydrogen generation rate was 2.1 times higher, which might be ascribed to its higher conduction band minimum.

Both zigzag and armchair edge sites of benzene ring models were considered as the possible active sites. The results indicate that the adsorption of H2S molecule on activated carbon is highly thermally favorable. The adsorption energies of H2S on zigzag and armchair edges are -664.9 and -349.6 kJ/mol, respectively. Activated carbon plays double role, not only facilitates the dissociation of H2S molecule but also offers active sites for H2S adsorption. The dissociative adsorption and evolution of H2S lead to the formations of C-S, C-S-C and C-SH, which is in agreement with experimental data. The shape of the local active site has a strong effect on H2S adsorption. The atomic charge of zigzag edge sites is more negative than that of armchair edge sites. Thus, the zigzag edge sites provide stronger force to attract H2S than the armchair edge sites. Direct adsorption of H2S leads to the formations of C-S or C-SH on activated carbon surface, followed by their evolution into C-S-C. These sulfur species including C-S, C-S-C and C-SH are stable on activated carbon.									75	6	0	0	21	0	81			0378-3820	1873-7188		WOS:000425570400028

Transmission electron microscopy studies reveal the existence of varying morphologies of few layers of MoS2 as well as quantum dots due to the different absorbing effects of two mixed solvents on MoS2. The X-ray diffraction, electron paramagnetic resonance, and Raman studies indicate the presence of physical as well as chemical adsorption of oxygen atoms in MoS2. The photoluminescence spectra show the tuning of bandgap arising from the passivation of trapping centers leading to radiative recombination of excitons. The value of work function obtained from scanning Kelvin probe microscopy of MoS2 in mixed solvents of H2O2 and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone increases with an increase in the concentration of H2O2. A linear relationship could be established between H2O2 content in mixed solvent and measured values of work function. This work gives the alternative route towards the commercial use of defect engineered transition metal dichalcogenide materials in diverse fields.

Thermonuclear runaways on the surface of massive white dwarfs, consisting of oxygen and neon, are believed to reach peak temperatures of several hundred million kelvin. These temperatures are strongly correlated with the underlying white dwarf mass. The observational counterparts of such models are likely associated with outbursts that show strong spectral lines of neon in their shells (neon novae). The goals of this work are to investigate how useful elemental abundances are for constraining the peak temperatures achieved during these outbursts and determine how robust "nova thermometers" are with respect to uncertain nuclear physics input. We present updated observed abundances in neon novae and perform a series of hydrodynamic simulations for several white dwarf masses. We find that the most useful thermometers, N/O, N/Al, O/S, S/Al, O/Na, Na/Al, O/P, and P/Al, are those with the steepest monotonic dependence on peak temperature. The sensitivity of these thermometers to thermonuclear reaction rate variations is explored using post-processing nucleosynthesis simulations. The ratios N/O, N/Al, O/Na, and Na/Al are robust, meaning they are minimally affected by uncertain rates. However, their dependence on peak temperature is relatively weak.

The results show that the water chemical type are HCO_3-Ca(Ca-Mg)and HCO_3-SO_4- Ca-Mg. Glacier water mineralization degree is low,and the water chemistry type is simple. What's more,it has a rarely NO_3~- ion content. So,this area is the ideal area to study the strontium isotope of water rock interaction and hydrogen oxygen isotope characteristics of glacial melt water. The ~(18)O and 2H of glacier melt water in the study area have obvious height effect. The relationship of water points of delta~(18)O-delta~2H are on the top left of the precipitation line. It shows the characteristics of ~(18)O and 2H in the cold climate conditions. This study applied87 Sr /86 Sr ratio and the relativity of 1 /[Sr~(2+)] ratio, and the relativity of ~(87)Sr /~(86)Sr ratio and [Sr~(2+)]/[Na~+]ratio,found that Tashikuergan river drainage area upstream southwest kalaqi Kur river area is dominated by silicate rock distribution. It is characterized by high ~(87)Sr /~(86)Sr ratio and low [Sr~(2+)]/[Na~+]ratio. The southern part is dominated by carbonate rocks,characterized by low ~(87)Sr /86 Sr ratio and high [Sr~(2+)]/[Na~+] ratio. In the middle and lower reaches,the river is the mixed water,with low near the upstream water points among them ~(87)Sr /86 Sr ratio and high ratio of 1 /[Sr~(2+)] was characterized,and downstream at low ~(87)Sr /~(86)Sr ratio and small ratio of ~(87)Sr /~(86)Sr,characterized by these characteristics associated with the sources and flows through the lithology of the mixed water. This study also found that the deuterium excess parameter d is an important index to identify the recharge of the river water or groundwater. It can be used to study the evolution of the ancient climate in the region.			本文研究了帕米尔高原地区冰川融水的Sr同位素组成特征,并且结合水化学和氢氧同位素结果进行讨论.结果表明,该区以HCO_3-Ca(Ca-Mg)和HCO_3-SO_4-Ca-Mg水为主;冰川融水矿化度低,水化学类型简单,NO_3~-离子含量很少,是研究冰川融水氢氧同位素特征和用锶同位素研究水-岩作用的理想地区.研究区冰川融水的~(18)O和~2H具有明显的高度效应,delta~(18)O-delta~2H关系水点均位于世界降水线的左上方,显示了寒冷气候条件下,冰川融水~(18)O和~2H同位素特征;本研究应用~(87)Sr /~(86)Sr比值与1 /[Sr~(2+)]相关性以及~(87)Sr /~(86)Sr、 [Sr~(2+)]/[Na~+]比值的相关性发现,塔什库尔干河流域的上游西南部喀喇其库尔河一带是以硅酸盐岩为主的分布区,其特点是高~(87)Sr /~(86)Sr比值和低[Sr~(2+)]/[Na~+]比值,南部是以碳酸盐岩为主的分布区,其特征是低 ~(87)Sr /~(86)Sr比值和高[Sr~(2+)]/[Na~+]比值;到了中游和下游,河水都是混合水,其中靠近上游水点以低~(87)Sr /~(86)Sr比值和高的1 /[Sr~(2+)]比值为特征,而下游则以低~(87)Sr /~(86)Sr比值和小的1 /[Sr~(2+)]比值为特征,这些特点与混合水的来源和流经区的岩性有关;本研究还发现,氘过量参数d值是识别大气降水补给河水或地下水的重要指标,可用于研究该地区古气候的演变.						3	2	0	0	0	0	5			0254-6108			CSCD:5970535		
J	Sun, Lianlian; Zhou, Fangyuan; Shao, Yina; Lv, Zhimeng; Li, Chenghua								Sedoheptulose kinase bridges the pentose phosphate pathway and immune responses in pathogen-challenged sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus								DEVELOPMENTAL AND COMPARATIVE IMMUNOLOGY				109						103694	10.1016/j.dci.2020.103694				AUG 2020	2020	The sedoheptulose kinase carbohydrate kinase-like protein (CARKL) is critical for immune cell activation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and cell polarization by restricting flux through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). To date, little is known about CARKL in regulating immune responses in marine invertebrates. In this study, we first cloned and characterized the CARKL gene from Apostichopus japonicus (designated as AjCARKL). Time-course analysis revealed that Vibrio splendidus challenge in vivo and lipopolysaccharide stimulation in vitro significantly downregulated AjCARKL mRNA expression. Furthermore, AjCARKL overexpression in cultured coelomocytes not only significantly inhibited the mRNA expression level of the rate-limiting enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase of the PPP but sharply decreased coelomocyte proliferation, ROS production, and phagocytic rate. Additionally, AjCARKL overexpression in mouse peritoneal macro-phages (RAW264.7 cells) significantly attenuated the intracellular ROS production and sensitized the M2 phenotype macrophage polarization. These results revealed that AjCARKL serves as a rheostat for cellular metabolism and is required for proper immune response by negatively regulating PPP in pathogen-challenged A. japonicus.									2	1	0	0	1	0	3			0145-305X	1879-0089		WOS:000532168100010	32283109

However, besides cationic redox, oxygen anionic redox contributing to extra charge transfer often suffers from local structural transformation through O-O bond formation, leading to partial irreversibility during discharge. Four typical transition metal (TM) substitution models Li<INF>2</INF>Mn<INF>0.75</INF>TM<INF>0.25</INF>O<INF>3</INF> (TM = Nb, Mo, Ru and Rh) are selected to calculate reversible capacity and perform electronic structure analysis. Our calculations reveal that the inherent t<INF>2g</INF> orbital of TMs around the Fermi level plays a key role in stabilizing the anionic lattice and operating cationic redox, which further favors anionic redox reversibility. An electron occupancy number N<INF>t<INF>2g</INF></INF> = 4 of the t<INF>2g</INF> orbital in substitutional TM cations is identified as the optimal value to achieve a maximum reversible capacity from cationic and anionic redox. Experimentally, Li<INF>2</INF>Mn<INF>0.75</INF>Ru<INF>0.25</INF>O<INF>3</INF> exhibits improved reversible capacity by 18.1% at 0.1C compared to Li<INF>2</INF>MnO<INF>3</INF>, confirming the suppression effect of Ru on the oxidation of lattice oxygen. The present study provides a new insight into developing high-capacity layered electrodes with good reversibility.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000635215200001

While enormous endeavors have demonstrated novel single-vacancy dependent photocatalysis phenomena, the influence of co-existence of multiple vacancies on photocatalysis remains relatively unexplored. Herein, a series of AgGaS2 nanocrystals featuring double-vacancy (silver vacancies and sulfur vacancies) characteristics have been successfully synthesized, where vacancy concentration control can be realized via simply adjusting the molar ratio of Ag and Ga precursors. The photocatalytic results show that the variation in the concentrations of double vacancies within the nanocrystals exerts a remarkable influence on photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, with the best performance in terms of efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production (up to 5.93 mmol g(-1) h(-1)) coming from the sample with Ag-P/Ga-P = 0.507. We further demonstrate how the double vacancies synergistically contribute to photocatalytic activity by affecting the separation and transfer efficiency of photo-generated carriers.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000490981500027

The Rietveld refinement confirms the existence of a pure CaCu3Ti4O12 phase in all samples. Significantly enlarged grain sizes of CaCu3Ti4-xGexO12 ceramics are associated with the liquid phase sintering mechanism. Enhanced dielectric permittivity from 6.909x10(4) to 1.089x10(5) can be achieved by increasing Ge4+ dopant from x=0-0.10, whereas the loss tangent is remarkably reduced by a factor of approximate to 10. Non-Ohmic properties are enhanced by Ge4+ doping ions. Using impedance and admittance spectroscopies, the underlying mechanisms for the dielectric and nonlinear properties are well described. The improved nonlinear properties and reduced loss tangent are attributed to the enhanced resistance and conduction activation energy of the grain boundaries. The largely enhanced permittivity is closely associated with the enlarged grain sizes and the increase in the Cu+/Cu2+ and Ti3+/Ti4+ ratios, which are calculated from the X-ray absorption near-edge structure.									16	1	0	0	0	0	17			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000408731300017

Challenges remain to preserve the biological structure through the harsh and laborious post-synthetic treatments, and tailor the functionality as desired. Herein, Escherichia coli is directly coated with metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) through in situ assembly to fabricate N, P co-doped porous carbon capsules expressing self-phosphorized metal phosphides. While the MOF coating serves as an armoring layer for facilitating the morphology inheritance from the bio-templates and provides metal sources for generating extra porosity and electrochemically active sites, the P-rich phospholipids and N-rich proteins from the plasma membrane enable carbon matrix doping and further yield metal phosphides. These unique structural and compositional features endow the carbon capsules with great capabilities in suppressing polysulfide shuttling and catalyzing reversible oxygen conversion, ultimately leading to the superb performance of lithium-sulfur batteries and zinc-air batteries. Combining the bio-templating strategy with hierarchical MOF assembly, this work opens a new avenue for the fabrication of highly porous and functional carbon for advanced energy applications.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000530513400001	32374506

The poor stability is derived from carrier recombination-induced thermal oxidation. Amorphous materials are generally omitted from photocatalysts due to the tailing effect. Here, we report that efficient solar overall water splitting into H-2 and O-2 with an expected 2:1 stoichiometry is achieved by two-dimensional amorphous CoO nanoflakes without any cocatalysts or scavengers, and no deactivation is detected even after working for 120 h. We also establish that the mediation of mid-gap states resulting from the amorphization is responsible for the carrier separation and consequent high stability. Further, graphene oxide is grafted to construct a bionic Z-scheme structure, promoting the gases evolution rates by a factor of 13. Overall, these findings reveal the potential of CoO for practical applications in the future hydrogen economy, and shed new light on the design of novel amorphous photocatalysts.

Here, we studied the role of dual-metal atoms on graphite carbon nitride (M1M2@g-CN, M1M2 = CuCu, FeFe, RuRu, RuCu, RuFe, CuFe) for selective and efficient CO2 electrochemical reduction based on density functional theory. Our results show that CO2RR on RuRu@g-CN catalyst prefers the *COOH pathway, while for CuCu@g-CN, FeFe@g-CN, RuCu@g-CN, RuFe@g-CN, CuFe@g-CN catalysts, the *OCHO pathway is more suitable. Among all the DACs combinations, we found that RuCu@g-CN and RuFe@g-CN are the most promising electrocatalysts for CO2RR with a lower limiting potential, which is attributed to the synergistic effect of different O- and C-affinity of the heterocenters in DACs. The selectivity of RuCu@g-CN and RuFe@g-CN to the production of CH4 is better than that of H-2 evolution. In addition, we also found that the adsorption free energy of intermediate on heteroatomic DACs can be predicted by those on homoatomic DACs, which can be used to further predict the limiting potential.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000669097900001	34134090

This cytotoxic effect has been attributed mainly to Mg due to its tendency to undergo activation when coupled with Ti, forming a galvanic cell consisting of an anode (Mg) and a cathode (Ti). However, the role of the Ti cathode has been ignored in explaining the cytotoxic effect of Ti-Mg particles due to its high resistance to corrosion. In this work, the role of titanium (Ti) in the cytotoxic mechanism of galvanically coupled Ti-Mg particles was examined. A model galvanic cell (MGC) was prepared to simulate the Mg-Ti particles. The electrochemical reactivity of the Ti sample and the pH change in it due to galvanic coupling with Mg were investigated using scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). It was observed that the Ti surface changed from passive to electrochemically active when coupled with Mg. Furthermore, after only 15 min of galvanic coupling with Mg, the pH in the electrolyte volume adjacent to the Ti surface increased to an alkaline pH value. The effects of the galvanic coupling of Ti and Mg, as well as those of the alkaline pH environment, on the viability of Hs27 fibroblast cells were investigated. It was shown that the viability of Hs27 cells significantly diminished when Mg and Ti were galvanically coupled compared to when the two metals were electrically disconnected. Thus, although Ti usually exhibited high corrosion resistance when exposed to physiological environments, an electrochemically active surface was observed when galvanically coupled with Mg, and this surface may participate in electron transfer reactions with chemical species in the neighboring environment; this participation resulted in the increased pH values above its surface and enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species. These features contributed to the development of cytotoxic effects by galvanically coupled Ti-Mg particles.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000697282300119	34473486

Over 50 years ago, Otto Heinrich Warburg discovered a unique stimulatory role of CO2 in the Hill reaction (i.e., O-2 evolution accompanied by reduction of an artificial electron acceptor), which, obviously, does not include any carbon fixation pathway; Warburg used this discovery to support his idea that O-2 in photosynthesis originates in CO2. During the 1960s, a large number of researchers attempted to decipher this unique phenomenon, with limited success. In the 1970s, Alan Stemler, in Govindjee's lab, perfected methods to get highly reproducible results, and observed, among other things, that the turnover of Photosystem II (PSII) was stimulated by bicarbonate ions (hydrogen carbonate): the effect would, be on the donor or the acceptor, or both sides of PSII. In 1975, Thomas Wydrzynski, also in Govindjee's lab, discovered that there was a definite bicarbonate effect on the electron acceptor (the plastoquinone) side of PSII. The most recent 1.9 angstrom crystal structure of PSII, unequivocally shows HCO3- bound to the non-heme iron that sits in-between the bound primary quinone electron acceptor, Q(A), and the secondary quinone electron acceptor Q(B). In this review, we focus on the historical development of our understanding of this unique bicarbonate effect on the electron acceptor side of PSII, and its mechanism as obtained by biochemical, biophysical and molecular biological approaches in many laboratories around the World. We suggest an atomic level model in which HCO3-/CO32- plays a key role in the protonation of the reduced Q(B). In addition, we make comments on the role of bicarbonate on the donor side of PSII, as has been extensively studied in the labs of Alan Stemler (USA) and Vyacheslav Klimov (Russia). We end this review by discussing the uniqueness of bicarbonate's role in oxygenic photosynthesis and its role in the evolutionary development of O-2-evolving PSII.

Owing to the conventional electrochemical catalysts of the cathodes in seawater battery are expensive, it is to seek the new biological catalysts to improve the electrochemical performance of the cathode and reduce the cost of seawater battery. A novel marine bacterial strain (Strain SQ-32) phylogenetically related to the Erythrobacter citreus strain has been isolated from the sea-bed sludge in the Yellow Sea of China successfully. The electrochemical measurements, which include the cyclic voltammetry, potentiostatic polarization, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, have been conducted in synthetic seawater. The electrochemical testing results show that the Strain SQ-32 is a cold-tolerant bacterium, which may exhibit a catalytic activity for the ORR in synthetic seawater at a freezing temperature. The SEM photo demonstrates that the Strain SQ-32 displays a rod-shaped characteristic, which has a diameter of 0.4 mu m and a length of about 1-2.5 mu m. By the testing of Gram staining, the Strain SQ-32 has been identified as a Gram-negative bacterium. The chemical analytical result reveals that the bacterium cell of Strain SQ-32 contains 1.92 mg g(-1) (DCW) of coenzyme Q10, which is a possible impact factor on the electro-catalytic effect on the Strain SQ-32. The exploitation of Strain SQ-32 may boost the development of the biocathode of seawater battery at a low temperature.

Here, noble-metal-free graphene and NiS co-modified g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst was prepared using an one-step hydrothermal method. The ternary composite displayed enhanced photocatalytic water splitting activity. When the weight ratios of RGO and NiS were 0.25% and 3%, respectively, the highest H-2 evolution rate was achieved, which was 21.8-fold that of bulk g-C3N4. The introduction of NiS and RGO dual cocatalysts promoted the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and improved the light absorption of g-C3N4, thus enhancing the photocatalytic activity. This work provides significant guidance for the modification of photocatalytic materials with noble-metal-free cocatalysts to realize high-efficient photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen generation.					3rd International Symposium on Energy and Environmental Photocatalytic Materials (EEPM3)3rd International Symposium on Energy and Environmental Photocatalytic Materials (EEPM3)	MAY 15-19, 2018MAY 15-19, 2018		Jagiellonian Univ, Fac Chem, Krakow, POLANDJagiellonian Univ, Fac Chem, Krakow, POLAND	50	4	0	0	3	0	51			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000454617200076

PbO2 was effectively dispersed on the whole nanotubes surface, including both their walls and mouths (electrocatalyst of the type: Ti/TiO2-Nts::PbO2). Scanning electron microscopy and EDS microanalyses showed that PbO2 grows from the bottom to the surface of the nanotubes, firstly covering their walls. A simple growth mechanism previously proposed was confirmed by electrochemical methods. Cyclic voltammetry characterization of Ti/TiO2-Nts::PbO2 electrodes (2 cm(2) geometric area) allowed to obtain the double layer capacitances that were directly related to PbO2 electroactive area, indicating that it grows inversely with deposition time. Also, electrocatalytic features (high oxygen evolution overpotential, open-edge morphologies and larger network structures to PbO2 crystals formed) depend on the PbO2 dispersion as well as electrodeposition time. Their electrooxidation properties were tested for electrolysis of 15 ppm methyl red (MR) and 50 ppm p-nitrophenol (PNP) acidic aqueous solutions at a current density of 30 mA cm(-2). Results clearly showed the effect of PbO2 deposition time on the electrocatalytic area and on the electrooxidation of PNP and MR. That is, Ti/TiO2-Nts::PbO2 with the shortest electrodeposition time has the highest surface and active area, efficiently degrading MR (100% of discoloration and 90% of organic removal) and PNP (90% of concentration removal after 3.5 h) in solutions. HPLC analyses of the final samples showed that carboxylic acids are the main remnant of electrooxidation.									8	2	0	0	0	0	10			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000419414800033

Sulfur-deprived cells of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii have been shown to produce hydrogen with the highest efficiency among photobiological systems. We have investigated the photosynthetic reactions during sulfur deprivation and H-2 production in the wild-type and state transition mutant 6 (Stm6) mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The incubation period (130 h) was dissected into different phases, and changes in the amount and functional status of photosystem II (PSII) were investigated in vivo by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and variable fluorescence measurements. In the wild type it was found that the amount of PSII is decreased to 25% of the original level; the electron transport from PSII was completely blocked during the anaerobic phase preceding H2 formation. This block was released during the H-2 production phase, indicating that the hydrogenase withdraws electrons from the plastoquinone pool. This partly removes the block in PSII electron transport, thereby permitting electron flow from water oxidation to hydrogenase. In the Stm6 mutant, which has higher respiration and H-2 evolution than the wild type, PSII was analogously but much less affected. The addition of the PSII inhibitor 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea revealed that similar to 80% of the H-2 production was inhibited in both strains. We conclude that (i) at least in the earlier stages, most of the electrons delivered to the hydrogenase originate from water oxidation by PSII, (ii) a faster onset of anaerobiosis preserves PSII from irreversible photoinhibition, and (iii) mutants with enhanced respiratory activity should be considered for better photobiological H-2 production.									72	2	2	0	45	0	76			0027-8424			WOS:000318682300034	23589846

Iron oxides are earth-abundant and nontoxic, with narrow bandgaps and suitable valence band positions for the visible-light-driven water oxidation reaction; however, an energy limitation for hydrogen generation is encountered due to the improper conduction band level. Herein, we demonstrated that this limitation could be overcome by the incorporation of small amounts of GO in the metal-organic framework (MOF)-templated synthesis of iron oxide, affording a uniform and highly ordered ferrite octahedral nanostructure embedded on graphene nanosheets. Such structural superiorities would result in a highly synergistic effect between Fe2O3 and reduced graphene oxide (rGO), affording an elevated flat band potential and a promoted photogenerated charge carrier separation and transportation. As a consequence, the resulting maghemite-carbonaceous composite exhibited a high photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate of 318.0 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) in the absence of noble metal cocatalysts and external bias. This work provides for the first time an ideal pathway for the utilization of Fe2O3 as the dominant component of a nanocomposite in efficient photocatalytic H2 production, as well as the prospect of developing highly active photocatalysts for overall water splitting. In addition, different phases of iron oxide, including maghemite (gamma-Fe2O3), hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) and magnetite (Fe3O4), and their carbonaceous composites can be obtained through the cautiously selected thermolysis of Fe-MOF and MOF/GO composites. The maghemite phase could be maintained with high saturation magnetization values under a large temperature gradient, implying a great potential for applications in magnetism and biomedicine-related research fields.									35	6	0	0	4	0	37			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000425623600031

Experiments were conducted for 1,2-DME/O-2/N-2 mixtures with different equivalence ratios (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0) in a high-pressure (10 atm) jet-stirred reactor (JSR) facility over the temperature range of 450-1100 K. Species concentration evolutions with the temperature were monitored with on-line Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry and off-line gas chromatography (GC). The technique of photoionization molecularbeam mass spectrometry (PI-MBMS) was combined with another JSR setup operated at near-atmospheric pressure (700 Torr), for the purpose of probing reactive intermediates from 1,2-DME oxidation. A kinetic model was constructed based on the "reaction classes" strategy, which could satisfactorily predict speciation measurements in the current work. Pronounced low-temperature reactivity of 1,2-DME was observed under all investigated conditions, and crucial intermediates like ketohydroperoxides were detected with the PI-MBMS. Some specificities of 1,2-DME oxidation were elucidated through further model interpretations. The double ether groups imbedded in the fuel molecule make hydrogen abstractions easier and meanwhile hinder the chain-terminating concerted eliminations, so the low-temperature reactivity starts at relatively low temperatures (compared to n-hexane for example). Chain-branching reaction sequences following the second O-2 additions proceed in the oxidizing mixtures, leading to the remarkable low-temperature reactivity of 1,2-DME which can be utilized as a cetane-improver.

Here, the CdS nanorods are the main body, and the CdS-MoS2 dumbbell structure is synthesized by the solvothermal method to make the photogenerated electrons flow along the one-dimensional axis. The nanoconfinement effect of MOF-derived In2O3 hollow hexagonal prisms greatly expands the spectral absorption range of the composite photocatalysts. The CdS-In2O3 S-scheme heterojunction was constructed by a simple electrostatic-driven self-assembly method. In situ irradiation X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis shows that the internal electric field drives the photogenerated electrons in In2O3 to move to CdS, forming a S-scheme heterojunction of CdS-In2O3, which greatly promotes the separation of electron-hole pairs. In2O3 is combined with the sidewalls of the CdS-MoS2 dumbbell to weaken the surface oxidation kinetics, thereby inhibiting the surface photo-corrosion reaction. MoS2 promotes the CdS-In2O3 S-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst to show significant photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance. The hydrogen production rate under the irradiation of a 300 W simulated light source is 198.58 mmol h(-1) g(-1), and natural light can produce a large number of visible bubbles. The effective separation of reduction and oxidation functional sites in space, the directional transfer of photogenerated electrons-holes, and the construction of S-scheme heterojunctions are the main factors for the significant increase in the catalytic activity of semiconductor photocatalysts. This work provides an effective strategy for designing metal sulfide-based photocatalysts with high activity and high stability of water-splitting properties.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000784875600001

HU was apparently photooxidized by the water-oxidizing enzyme (WOE) since the photooxidation reaction was blocked by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). HU radicals photoproduced by the WOE inhibited the electron transfer between the redox-active tyrosine residue (Y-Z), which is involved in electron transfer from the WOE to the reaction center chlorophyll of PS II, and the secondary quinone electron acceptor. Treatment of PS II complex with Tris resulted in the appearance of a CCCP-insensitive photooxidation site for HU. Photoproduced HU radicals in oxygenic and Tris-treated PS II complex decayed with first-order kinetics, an indication that the radicals reacted primarily with surrounding molecules rather than decayed through spontaneous dismutation or recombination. HU inhibited the diphenylcarbazide-supported photoreduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP) in Tris-treated PS II complex preincubated only under illumination, but this inhibition was suppressed when ascorbate was added to scavenge HU radicals. If examined in darkness, HU radicals could not, however, inhibit subsequent photoreduction of DCIP. Therefore, the photoproduced HU radicals interact with a photogenerated site(s) in the PS II complex. The photoproduction of Y-Z(.), a radical of Y-Z, was suppressed to about 40% in Tris-treated PS II complex by the in situ-photogenerated HU radicals, and the yield of a cation radical of chlorophyll, close to the PS II reaction center, was increased, while the production of a radical of another redox-active tyrosine residue in PS II (Y-D(.)) was hardly affected. This indicated that the HU radicals modified YZ. rather than YD..									8	0	0	0	6	0	8			0006-2960			WOS:A1994PE32800033	8068687

We used 3-(3,4dichlorophenyl)- 1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU; a photosystem II inhibitor) to block O-2 evolution and ATP/NADPH generation by linear electron flow. Based on C-13-metabolic flux analysis (C-13-MFA) and RNA sequencing, we have found that Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 employs a unique photoheterotrophic metabolism. First, glucose catabolism forms a cyclic route that includes the oxidative pentose phosphate (OPP) pathway and the glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (PGI) reaction. Glucose-6-phosphate is extensively degraded by the OPP pathway for NADPH production and is replenished by the reversed PGI reaction. Second, the Calvin cycle is not fully functional, but RubisCO continues to fix CO2 and synthesize 3-phosphoglycerate. Third, the relative flux through the complete tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and succinate dehydrogenase is small under heterotrophic conditions, indicating that the newly discovered cyanobacterial TCA cycle (via the gamma-aminobutyric acid pathway or alpha-ketoglutarate decarboxylase/ succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase) plays a minimal role in energy metabolism. Fourth, NAD(P) H oxidation and the cyclic electron flow (CEF) around photosystem I are the two main ATP sources, and the CEF accounts for at least 40% of total ATP generation from photoheterotrophic metabolism (without considering maintenance loss). This study not only demonstrates a new topology for carbohydrate oxidation but also provides quantitative insights into metabolic bioenergetics in cyanobacteria.									38	2	0	0	31	0	39			0021-9193	1098-5530		WOS:000349399000014	25535269

At present, the main two-dimensional photocatalytic materials include metal oxides, metal composite oxides, metal hydroxides, metal sulfides, bismuth-based materials, and non-metallic photocatalytic materials. The absorption of photons in bulk materials or nanoparticles is often limited by the transmittance and reflection at the grain boundary, while the two-dimensional structure can provide a large specific surface area and abundant surface low-coordination atoms to obtain more UV visible light. In addition, the smaller atomic thickness of two-dimensional photocatalytic materials can shorten the carrier migration distance. Thus, in two-dimensional photocatalytic materials, the carriers generated in the interior migrate to the surface faster than that in the bulk materials, which can reduce the recombination of photogenerated carriers and facilitate the photocatalytic reaction. For the surface redox reaction, the two-dimensional structure can provide more abundant surface-active sites to accelerate the reaction process. Additionally, when the thickness is reduced to the atomic scale, the escape energy of atoms is relatively small, thereby increasing the surface defects, which is helpful for the adsorption and activation of target molecules. Thus, the synthesis methods and performance enhancement strategies of two-dimensional photocatalytic materials have been developed rapidly. The former strategies mainly focus on the adjustment of morphology and geometric structure characteristics, which cannot fully meet the design requirements of efficient and stable photocatalysts. The photocatalytic performance and stability can be improved by surface design to construct abundant active sites and adjust the electronic structure. Research on the reaction mechanism of photocatalysis can help us understand the demand for photocatalytic structure characteristics in different reactions, thereby guiding the design of photocatalysts. In this paper, the advances in surface design and electronic structure regulation strategies of two-dimensional photocatalytic materials are reviewed from three aspects: light absorption; charge separation; and active sites, including element doping, heterojunction design, defect construction, single atom modification, and plasmonic metal loading. The effects on the reaction mechanism for typical air pollutant purification by regulating the electronic structure of two-dimensional photocatalytic materials are summarized. Finally, the problems and challenges associated with the development of two-dimensional photocatalytic materials are analyzed and discussed.									7	2	0	0	2	0	8			1000-6818			WOS:000613263000009

PCC7942 (Anacystis nidulans R2), was mapped at 3.9 kb upstream of the nitrate reductase gene, narB. Three closely linked genes (designated nrtB, nrtC, and nrtD), which encode proteins of 279, 659, and 274 amino acids, respectively, were found between the nrtA and narB genes. NrtB is a hydrophobic protein having structural similarity to the integral membrane components of bacterial transport systems that are dependent on periplasmic substrate-binding proteins. The N-terminal portion of NrtC (amino acid residues 1-254) and NrtD are 58% identical to each other in their amino acid sequences. and resemble the ATP-binding components of binding protein-dependent transport systems. The C-terminal portion of NrtC is 30% identical to NrtA. Mutants constructed by interrupting each of nrtB and nrtC were unable to grow on nitrate, and the nrtD mutant required high concentration of nitrate for growth. The rate of nitrate-dependent O2 evolution (photosynthetic O2 evolution coupled to nitrate reduction) in wild-type cells measured in the presence Of L-methionine 1),L-sulfoximine and glycolaldehyde showed a dual-phase relationship with nitrate concentration. It followed saturation kinetics up to 10 mM nitrate (the concentration required for half-saturation = 1 muM), and the reaction rate then increased above the saturation level of the first phase as the nitrate concentration increased. The high-affinity phase of nitrate-dependent O2 evolution was absent in the nrtD mutant. The results suggest that there are two independent mechanisms of nitrate uptake and that the nrtB-nrtC-nrtD cluster encodes a high-affinity nitrate transport system.									135	2	0	0	125	0	143			0026-8925			WOS:A1993KK98500006	8437564

Vacancy engineering is a typical strategy for modulating the catalytic activity of electrocatalysts. However, creating vacancies directly into pure metallic Ru is difficult because of the extremely stringent conditions required and will result in instability because the integrity of the crystal structure is destroyed. In response, a compromise tactic by introducing vacancies in a Ru composite structure is proposed, and vacancy-rich carbon dots coupled with Ru (Ru@CDs) are elaborately constructed. Specifically, the vacancy-rich carbon dots (CDs) serve as an excellent platform for anchoring and trapping Ru nanoparticles, thus restraining their agglomeration and growth. As expected, Ru@CDs exhibited excellent catalytic performance with a low overpotential of 30 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 m KOH, a small Tafel slope of 22 mV decade(-1), and robust stability even after 10 000 cycles. The low overpotential is comparable to those of most previously reported Ru-based electrocatalysts. Additionally, spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the rich vacancies and the electron interactions between Ru and CDs synergistically lower the intermediate energy barrier and thereby maximize the activity of the Ru@CDs electrocatalyst.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000695025100001	34510740

Our previous study found that selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) synthesized with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a stabilizer had intrinsic oxidase-like activity, which could catalyze the oxidation of oxidase substrate 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine by oxygen. However, the catalytic activity of as-synthesized SeNPs was not very high, which greatly limits their applications. Herein, to improve the oxidase-like activity of SeNPs, SeNPs were synthesized using three types of stabilizers (BSA, chitosan (CS) and sodium alginate (SA)). The catalytic activity of CS-stabilized SeNPs (CS-SeNPs) with the most positive surface charge was 4-fold of BSA-stabilized SeNPs (BSA-SeNPs), but that of SA-stabilized SeNPs with negative surface charge was the weakest. Subsequent reactive oxygen capture experiments and electron spin resonance detection showed that superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical might be involved in the catalytic mechanism of CS-SeNPs. Finally, on the basis of the inhibition of Hg2+ on the oxidase-like activity of CS-SeNPs, a simple and economical colorimetric method for Hg2+ detection was achieved with a detection limit of 0.12 mu M. The results provide a new clue for improving oxidase-like activity of nanomaterials and broaden the potential application of SeNPs in chemical sensor.									17	1	0	0	7	0	18			1369-703X	1873-295X		WOS:000518145600016

The sites of inhibition in both Ca2+ and Cl--depleted PS-II were compared using EPR and flash absorption spectroscopies to follow the extent of the photooxidation of the redox-active tyrosine (TyrZ) and of the primary electron donor chlorophyll (P680) and their subsequent reduction in the dark. The inhibition occurred after formation of the S3 State in Ca2+-depleted PS-II. In Cl--depleted photosystem II, the inhibition occurred after formation of the S3 state in about half of the centers and probably after S2TyrZ+ formation in the remaining centers. After the S3 state was formed in Ca2+- and Cl--depleted photosystem II, electron transfer from TyrZ to P680 was inhibited. This inhibition is discussed in terms of electrostatic constraints resulting from S3 formation in the absence of Ca2+ and Cl-.									114	0	2	0	89	0	116			0006-2960			WOS:A1992HC21900036	1310424

Furthermore, thin layered molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) composited with nitrogen doped graphene (NG) was used for oxygen reduction. Successful synthesis of these nano materials was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray florescence (XRF), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), Raman spectroscopy, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. In the following, by using the cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique the electrochemical behaviors of the glassy carbon electrodes modified with the mentioned composites were investigated. The results of methanol oxidation and oxygen reduction showed sufficient electro-catalytic effects as well as significant diffusion currents in presence of the non-precious synthetic materials. Obtained exchange currents (i(0)) from Tafel plots showed increasment up to 6.02 x 10(-6) and 1.47 x 10(-5) A for anode and cathode respectively. Also, thermodynamic potential of the DMFC was estimated about 1.1 V in alkaline media that was very close to reported value for theoretical potential in DMFC.

These NSs were produced via a simple hydrothermal route and have desirable properties with a band gap of 2.24 eV, and are photo-catalytically active under visible light with an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 2.48%. Under visible light, CuCo2S4 NSs exhibit excellent weight-normalized photoactivity that generates approximate to 25900 mol h(-1) H-2 for 1 g of material with sulphide + sulphite as the sacrificial agent under 7.68 mW cm(-2) illumination, which is the best evolution reported for any chalcogenide semiconductor material without any co-catalyst to date with unprecedented long-term operational stability (up to 12 h study time). The rate and number of hydrogen gas molecules produced are 8.2855 x 10(15) s(-1) cm(-2) which remained constant for three catalytic cycles with a turnover frequency (TOF) value of 0.017 s(-1). The effect of Cu substitution on photoactivity was also investigated for comparative studies and it was found that CuCo2S4 NSs show superior activity to Cu0.5Co2.5S4 and Co3S4. These CuCo2S4 NSs absorb the entire visible range of the spectrum from 420 to 800 nm, and have a highly populated density of states at the Fermi level and a high donor concentration of 7.22 x 10(18) cm(-3) which have been evaluated by Mott-Schottky analysis and favourable adsorption of H+ on S-sites and conversion to H-2 corroborate their efficient photocatalytic activity.									63	0	0	0	3	0	63			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463814800038

To this respect, there is a need in the abandoned and efficient materials that can continuously split water molecules using solar energy. In this report, an ammonium thiomolybdate (ATM: (NH4)(2)Mo3S13) is evaluated as a p-type semiconductor film photocathode for hydrogen evolution reaction. The ATM thin films are prepared by spin-coating on fluorine-doped tin oxide substrates, and their structural, morphological, optical, photoelectrical, and photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties are studied. Transient surface photovoltage (TSPV) spectroscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry indicate the band gap E-g = 1.9 eV for the ATM thin films. Furthermore, the photovoltage of the ATM thin films measured by TSPV is correlated to the photocurrents measured by the PEC characterization that can be used to evaluate the material potential for hydrogen generation. The films exhibit a low photocurrent density of 46 mu A cm(-2) at 0 V-RHE. However, its combination with WSe2 thin-film photocathodes results in a significant increase in photocurrent density up to 4.6 mA cm(-2) at 0 V-RHE (100 times). The reason for such a strong charge carrier transfer effect for ATM/WSe2 heterojunction photocathodes is studied by TSPV spectroscopy that allows a comprehensive evaluation of potential photovoltaic materials toward PEC hydrogen production. Furthermore, the photovoltage generated by a WSe2 thin film is 30 times lower than that of its single crystal, which indicates that the quality of WSe2 thin films should be improved for faster PEC hydrogen evolution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000812813700001	35512324

The (Ir,Sn,Nb)O-2 thin film of different compositions coated on Ti foil has been studied as a promising oxygen reduction anode electrocatalyst for PEM based water electrolysis. It has been identified that (Ir,Sn,Nb)O-2 of composition up to x = 0.30 [(Ir0.40Sn0.30Nb0.30)O-2] shows similar electrochemical activity compared to pure IrO2 (x = 0) resulting in similar to 60 mol.% reduction in noble metal content. On the other hand, (Ir,Sn,Nb)O-2 of composition x = 0.20 [(Ir0.20Sn0.40Nb0.40)O-2] shows only 20% lower activity compared to pure IrO2 though the noble metal oxide, IrO2 loading is reduced by 80 mol.%. The accelerated life test of the anode electrocatalyst for 48 h followed by elemental analysis of the electrolyte shows that (Ir,Sn,Nb)O-2 improves the stability of the electrode in comparison to pure IrO2 electrocatalyst in oxygen reduction processes. The excellent electrochemical activity as well as long term structural stability of (Ir,Sn,Nb)O-2 during water electrolysis has been discussed using first-principles calculations of the total energies, electronic structures, and cohesive energies of the model systems.

Here, an atomic-scale defect engineering approach to form and control traps for platinum SA sites as co-catalyst for photocatalytic H-2 generation is described. Thin sputtered TiO2 layers are used as a model photocatalyst, and compared to the more frequently used (001) anatase sheets. To form stable SA platinum, the TiO2 layers are reduced in Ar/H-2 under different conditions (leading to different but defined Ti3+-O-v surface defects), followed by immersion in a dilute hexachloroplatinic acid solution. HAADF-STEM results show that only on the thin-film substrate can the density of SA sites be successfully controlled by the degree of reduction by annealing. An optimized SA-Pt decoration can enhance the normalized photocatalytic activity of a TiO2 sputtered sample by 150 times in comparison to a conventional platinum-nanoparticle-decorated TiO2 surface. HAADF-STEM, XPS, and EPR investigation jointly confirm the atomic nature of the decorated Pt on TiO2. Importantly, the density of the relevant surface exposed defect centers-thus the density of Pt-SA sites, which play the key role in photocatalytic activity-can be precisely optimized.									103	9	0	0	6	0	104			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000517668500001	32125728

Garnet-bearing gneiss is hosted as enclaves, pods within granite gneiss and charnockite. It is largely made up of garnet, orthopyroxene, cordierite, biotite, plagioclase, K-feldspar, sillimanite and quartz. The peak metamorphic stage is represented by the equilibrium mineral assemblage i.e. garnet, orthopyroxene, cordierite, biotite, plagioclase, sillimanite and quartz. Breakdown of the garnet as well as preservation of the orthopyroxene-cordierite symplectite, formation of cordierite with the consumption of the garnet + sillimanite + quartz represents the decompressional event. The thermobarometric calculations suggest a retrograde P-T path with a substantial decompression of c. 3.0 kbar. The water activity (X-H2O) conditions obtained with the winTWQ program for core and symplectite compositions from garnet-bearing gneiss are 0.07-0.14 and 0.11-0.16 respectively. The quantitative estimation of oxygen fugacity in garnet-bearing gneiss reveal log fO(2) values ranging from -11.38 to -14.05. This high oxidation state could be one of the reasons that account for the absence of graphite in these rocks.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1000-9515	1755-6724		WOS:000505305900020

However, the typical morphologies and structures of Ni-based cocatalysts (e.g., Ni) focus on the zero-dimensional (0D) nanoparticles. Herein, we demonstrate a two-dimensional (2D) nickel nanosheets cocatalyst decorated Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanocrystals that pays attention to visible-light-motivated photocatalytic H-2 generation. By rationally introducing Ni nanosheets to modify Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanoparticles, a series of unique 2D/0D Ni/Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanohybrids with different Ni contents were synthesized. The optimized Ni-5%/Zn0.5Cd0.5S composite possesses a high H-2 production rate of 5930 mu mol h(-1)g(-1) upon visible-light (lambda > 420 nm) illumination, which was about 33.7 and 15.4-fold more elevated than those of Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanocrystals, and Pt/Zn0.5Cd0.5S, respectively. Combining photoelectrochemical (PEC) and photoluminescence (PL) studies, the conspicuous enhancement in photocatalytic H-2 generation was stemmed from the Ni nanosheets cocatalyst act as an electron-transfer layer to extract photoexcited electrons from Zn0.5Cd0.5S and offer enormous reaction sites for H-2 production. This work verifies Ni nanosheets' capability for photocatalytic water splitting. The Ni/Zn0.5Cd0.5S composed of magnetic metal and ternary metal sulfide can be extended to other photocatalytic applications, such as dyes degradation and CO2 reduction. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

By analogy to higher plants, the phosphorylation site is likely to be at residue threonine-2 (Thr-2). We have investigated the role of D2 phosphorylation by constructing two mutants in which residue Thr-2 has been replaced by either alanine or serine. Both mutants grew photoautotrophically at wild-type rates, and noninvasive biophysical measurements, including the decay of chlorophyll fluorescence, the peak temperature of thermoluminescence bands, and rates of oxygen evolution, indicate little perturbation to electron transfer through the PSII complex. The susceptibility of mutant PSII to photoinactivation as measured by the light-induced loss of PSII activity in whole cells in the presence of the protein-synthesis inhibitors chloramphenicol or lincomycin was similar to that of wild type. These results indicate that phosphorylation at Thr-2 is not required for PSII function or for protection from photoinactivation. In control experiments the phosphorylation of D2 in wild-type C. reinhardtii was examined by P-32 labeling in vivo and in vitro. No evidence for the phosphorylation of D2 in the wild type could be obtained. [C-14]Acetate-labeling experiments in the presence of an inhibitor of cytoplasmic protein synthesis also failed to identify phosphorylated (D2.1) and nonphosphorylated (D2.2) forms of D2 upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Our results suggest that the existence of D2 phosphorylation in C.reinhardtii is still in question.									23	0	0	0	19	0	23			0032-0889			WOS:000074182400018	9625704

In contrast, the surrounding freshwater fauna is commonly represented by species with large-scale distribution and high phenotypic thermal plasticity. Here, we investigated the thermal plasticity of the energy metabolism in two closely-related endemic amphipod species from Lake Baikal (Eulimnogammarus verrucosus; stenothermal and Eulimnogammarus cyaneus; eurythermal) and the ubiquitous Holarctic amphipod Gammarus lacustris (eurythermal) by exposure to a summer warming scenario (6-23.6 degrees C; 0.8 degrees C d(-1)). In concert with routine metabolic rates, activities of key metabolic enzymes increased strongly with temperature up to 15 degrees C in E. verrucosus, whereupon they leveled off (except for lactate dehydrogenase). In contrast, exponential increases were seen in E. cyaneus and G. lacustris throughout the thermal trial (Q(10)-values: 1.6-3.7). Cytochrome-c-oxidase, lactate dehydrogenase, and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities were found to be higher in G. lacustris than in E. cyaneus, especially at the highest experimental temperature (23.6 degrees C). Decreasing gene expression levels revealed some thermal compensation in E. cyaneus but not in G. lacustris. In all species, shifts in enzyme activities favored glycolytic energy generation in the warmth. The congruent temperature-dependencies of enzyme activities and routine metabolism in E. verrucosus indicate a strong feedback-regulation of enzymatic activities by whole organism responses. The species-specific thermal reaction norms reflect the different ecological niches, including the spatial distribution, distinct thermal behavior such as temperature-dependent migration, movement activity, and mating season.									5	0	0	0	3	0	5			2045-2322			WOS:000626620700003	33633174

Among them, the strongest virulence and highest rate of clinical isolation serotype is S. suis serotype 2 (SS2). Moreover, SS2 is also an important zoonosis pathogen, which caused severe public health issues in China. It has been reported that SS2 has several virulence factors, including muramidase released protein, extracellular factors, capsule, fibronectin-binding protein, enolase, hemolysin, small RNA, biofilm, two-component regulatory systems, STK/STP, etc., whose functions involved in adhesion, anti-phagocytosis, inflammatory pathway activation, invasion, etc. Actually, SS2 has developed a variety of ways to escape from host immune system during evolution. In particularly, capsule could resist phagocytosis through inhibiting sphingosine dependent immune cell recognition, which plays an important role in escaping host inflammation response; moreover, superoxide dismutase encoding by sodA enables SS2 escaping reactive oxygen species (ROS) in host immune cells; besides, binding complement factor H with Fhb could suppress the activation of complement alternative pathway and bactericidal effect. And SS2 could also hinder the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to avoid trapping by swine neutrophils, while host immune globulin could be degraded by IgA1 hydrolase and IgM protease. In addition, SS2 could escape host immune defense with the help of multiple transcriptional factors and micro-RNA. So far, the pathogenesis of meningitis, arthritis caused by SS2 infection, is still unclear, and the virulence regulatory mechanism of phosphorylation, micro-RNA need to be further clarified. Importantly, the study of interaction mechanism of pathogen and host contribute to further demonstration the pathogenesis of SS2.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2095-3119			WOS:000418345800017

Using a read depth approach based on next-generation sequencing, we performed a genome-wide analysis of segmental duplications (SDs) and associated copy number variations (CNVs) in the water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis). By aligning short reads of Olimpia (the reference water buffalo) to the UMD3.1 cattle genome, we identified 1,038 segmental duplications comprising 44.6 Mb (equivalent to similar to 1.73% of the cattle genome) of the autosomal and X chromosomal sequence in the buffalo genome. We experimentally validated 70.3% (71/101) of these duplications using fluorescent in situ hybridization. We also detected a total of 1,344 CNV regions across 14 additional water buffaloes, amounting to 59.8 Mb of variable sequence or the equivalent of 2.2% of the cattle genome. The CNV regions overlap 1,245 genes that are significantly enriched for specific biological functions including immune response, oxygen transport, sensory system and signal transduction. Additionally, we performed array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) experiments using the 14 water buffaloes as test samples and Olimpia as the reference. Using a linear regression model, a high Pearson correlation (r = 0.781) was observed between the log(2) ratios between copy number estimates and the log(2) ratios of aCGH probes. We further designed Quantitative PCR assays to confirm CNV regions within or near annotated genes and found 74.2% agreement with our CNV predictions.

We have used chemical oxidants (ceric ammonium nitrate and NaIO4) to generate the WO intermediates [Ru-II(OH2)(Py(2)(Me)tacn)](2+), [Ru-III(OH2)(Py(2)(Me)tacn)](3+), [Ru-III(OH)(Py(2)(Me)tacn)](2+) and [Ru-IV(O)(Py(2)(Me)tacn)](2+), which have been characterised spectroscopically. Their relative redox and pH stability in water has been studied by using UV/Vis and NMR spectroscopies, HRMS and spectroelectrochemistry. [Ru-IV(O)(Py(2)(Me)tacn)](2+) has a long half-life (>48 h) in water. The catalytic cycle of WO has been elucidated by using kinetic, spectroscopic, O-18-labelling and theoretical studies, and the conclusion is that the rate-determining step is a single-site water nucleophilic attack on a metal-oxo species. Moreover, [Ru-IV(O)(Py(2)(Me)tacn)](2+) is proposed to be the resting state under catalytic conditions. By monitoring Ce-IV consumption, we found that the O-2 evolution rate is redox-controlled and independent of the initial concentration of Ce-IV. Based on these facts, we propose herein that [Ru-IV(O)(Py(2)(Me)tacn)](2+) is oxidised to [Ru-V(O)(Py(2)(Me)tacn)](2+) prior to attack by a water molecule to give [Ru-III(OOH)(Py(2)(Me)tacn)](2+). Finally, it is shown that the difference in WO reactivity between the homologous iron and ruthenium [M(OH2)(Py(2)(Me)tacn)](2+) (M=Ru, Fe) complexes is due to the difference in the redox stability of the key M-V(O) intermediate. These results contribute to a better understanding of the WO mechanism and the differences between iron and ruthenium complexes in WO reactions.									18	0	0	0	5	0	18			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000380271900034	27324949

Cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry and spectrophotometric analysis techniques have been employed. In accordance with thermodynamic data, it has been shown that amorphous layers of slightly soluble Ru(OH)(3) and RuO2 center dot nH(2)O form on the surface of an active Ru electrode at 0.2<E<0.8 V and 0.8<E<1.1 V respectively, as a result of ruthenium anodic oxidation. Cathodic reduction of these layers proceeds reversibly within the indicated ranges of potential. It has been demonstrated that in the acidic medium, passivation of ruthenium electrode takes place at 1.1<E<1.35 V due to further oxidation of the ruthenium phase and formation of a more compact layer of anhydrous RuO2. The latter can be reduced only at potentials more negative than 0.2 V. In the case of alkaline medium, no passivation of the Ru electrode is observed within this particular range of potentials. At E>1.35 V, transpassive anodic dissolution of ruthenium electrode takes place in both acid and alkaline electrolytes concomitantly with oxygen evolution. The RuO2 electrode demonstrates capacitor type voltammetric response at 0.4<E<1.4 V in both acid and alkaline medium. It has been proposed that such behaviour can be accounted for by a non-faradaic double layer process involving reversible adsorption/desorption of OH- ions on the surface of RuO2 electrode as described by the following equationRuO2+H2O <-> RuO2 center dot(OH-)(ad)+H+where Q(ad) is the charge related to this process.									33	0	0	0	1	0	33			0020-2967	1745-9192		WOS:000249228600007

Monoterpene synthases produce the turpentine fraction of oleoresin, which allows mobilization of the diterpene resin acid component (rosin) and is also toxic toward invading insects; this is particularly the case for alpha-pinene, a prominent bicyclic monoterpene of pine turpentine. The stereochemistry of alpha-pinene is a critical determinant of host defense capability and has implications for host selection, insect pheromone biosynthesis, and tritrophic-level interactions. Pines produce both enantionters of alpha-pinene, which appear to arise through antipodal reaction mechanisms by distinct enzymes. Using a cDNA library constructed with mRNA from flushing needles of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), we employed a homology-based cloning strategy to isolate, and confirm by functional expression, the genes encoding (+)-(3R:5R)-alpha-pinene synthase, (-)-(3S:5S)-alpha-pinene synthase, and several other terpene synthases. The pinene synthases, which produce mirror-image products, share only 66% amino acid identity (72% similarity) but are similar in general properties to other monoterpene synthases of gymnosperms. The stereochemical control of monoterpene cyclization reactions, the evolution of "antipodal" enzymes, and the implications of turpentine composition in ecological interactions are discussed.

Supercritical accretion is expected to occur in a supernova (SN) with fallback material accreting onto a nascent compact object. We find that appreciable amounts of p-nuclei are synthesized via the p-process in the disk when the accretion rate M > 1.6 x 10(6) L-Edd/c(2), where L-Edd is the Eddington luminosity. Abundance profiles of p-nuclei ejected from SSADs have similar features to those of oxygen/neon layers in Type II SNe when composition of the fallback gas is initially those of the oxygen/neon layers in the progenitor. The overall abundance profile is in agreement with that of the solar system. Some p-nuclei, such as Mo, Ru, Sn, and La, are underproduced in SSADs as in Type II SNe. If the fallback gas is mixed with a small fraction of proton, significant amounts of Mo-92 and La-138 are produced inside SSADs. Ru-96, Sn-113, and Sn-114 are also abundantly produced when the fallback gas contains abundant proton though the overall abundance profile of p-nuclei is rather different from that of the solar system.					7th International Symposium on Nuclei in the Cosmos (NIC7)7th International Symposium on Nuclei in the Cosmos (NIC7)	JUL 08-12, 2002JUL 08-12, 2002	Todai Int Symp, Univ Tokyo; Int Symp Minist Educ, Culture, Spoets, Sci & Technol; Commemorat Assoc Japan World Exposit 1970; Japan Soc Promot Sci; Inoue Fdn Sci; Kajima Fdn; Natl Astronom Observ JapanTodai Int Symp, Univ Tokyo; Int Symp Minist Educ, Culture, Spoets, Sci & Technol; Commemorat Assoc Japan World Exposit 1970; Japan Soc Promot Sci; Inoue Fdn Sci; Kajima Fdn; Natl Astronom Observ Japan	FUJI, JAPANFUJI, JAPAN	2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0375-9474			WOS:000182314300131

Severely ill patients requiring oxygen therapy >3 L/min or intensive care were excluded. Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 800 mg hydroxychloroquine on day 0 followed by 400 mg per day for 8 days or a placebo. The primary end point was a composite of death or start of invasive mechanical ventilation within 14 days following randomization. Secondary end points included mortality and clinical evolution at days 14 and 28, and viral shedding at days 5 and 10.Results: The trial was stopped after 250 patients were included because of a slowing down of the pandemic in France. The intention-to-treat population comprised 123 and 124 patients in the placebo and hydroxychloroquine groups, respectively. The median age was 77 years (interquartile range 58 -86 years) and 151/250 (60.4%) patients required oxygen therapy. The primary end point occurred in 9/124 (7.3%) patients in the hydroxychloroquine group and 8/123 (6.5%) patients in the placebo group relative risk 1.12; 95% CI 0.45-2.80). The rates of positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests at days 5 and 10 were 72.8% (75/103) and 57.1% (52/91) in the hydroxychloroquine group, versus 73.0% (73/100) and 56.6% (47/83) in the placebo group, respectively. No difference was observed between the two groups in any of the other secondary end points.Conclusion: In this underpowered trial involving mainly older patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, patients treated with hydroxychloroquine did not experience better clinical or virological outcomes than those receiving the placebo.

The system performance was evaluated using a multi-physics model that accounted for the properties of the tandem photoabsorbers, mass transport, and the electrocatalytic performance of the oxygen-evolution and hydrogen-evolution reactions (OER and HER, respectively). The solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiencies and the ohmic losses associated with proton transport in the solution electrolyte and through the membrane of the photoelectrolysis system were evaluated systematically as a function of the cell dimensions, the operating temperatures, the bandgap combinations of the tandem cell, and the performance of both the photoabsorbers and electrocatalysts. Relative to designs of optimized systems that would operate without a solar concentrator, the optimized 10x solar concentrator designs possessed larger ohmic losses and exhibited less uniformity in the distribution of the current density along the width of the photoelectrode. To minimize resistive losses while maximizing the solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency, rism, both of the designs, a two-dimensional "trough" design and a three-dimensional "bubble wrap" design, required that the electrode width or diameter, respectively, was no larger than a few millimeters. As the size of the electrodes increased beyond this limiting dimension, the ism became more sensitive to the performance of the photoabsorbers and catalysts. At a fixed electrode dimension, increases in the operating temperature reduced the efficiency of cells with smaller electrodes, due to degradation in the performance of the photoabsorber with increasing temperature. In contrast, cells with larger electrode dimensions showed increases in efficiency as the temperature increased, due to increases in the rates of electrocatalysis and due to enhanced mass transport. The simulations indicted that cells that contained 10% photoabsorber area, and minimal amounts of Nafion or other permselective membranes (i.e. areal coverages and volumetric fractions of only a few percent of the cell), with the remaining area comprised of a suitable, low-cost inert, non porous material (flexible polymers, inert inorganic materials, etc.) should be able to produce high values of eta(STH), with eta(STH) = 29.8% for an optimized design with a bandgap combination of 1.6 eV/0.9 eV in a tandem photoabsorber system at 350 K.

Distinctive concretions composed of heavy rinds of iron oxide that surround iron-poor, mud-rich cores are common along bases of fluvial cross-bed sets of the Cretaceous Dakota Formation, Nebraska, USA. Concretion rinds thicken inward and cores contain 46 to 89% void space. Millimetre-scale spherosiderites are abundant in palaeosols that developed in floodplain facies. Evolution of rinded concretions began when intraformational clasts were eroded from sideritic soils, transported, abraded and deposited in river channels. Alteration of siderite and formation of rinds occurred much later, perhaps in the Quaternary when sandstone pore waters became oxic. Dakota concretions are analogous to rattlestones in Pleistocene fluvial channels of The Netherlands, and their rinded structure is analogous to that of iron-rich concretions in the aeolian Navajo Sandstone of Utah. In all three deposits, rinded concretions formed when pre-existing, siderite-cemented concretions were oxidized within a sand matrix. Unlike fluvial examples, siderite in the Navajo Sandstone was autochthonous and of late diagenetic origin, having precipitated from carbon dioxide and methane-enriched waters moving through folded and jointed strata. Iron-rich rinds formed in all these strata because concretion interiors remained anaerobic, even as oxygen accumulated in the pore waters of their surrounding, permeable matrix. Iron oxide first precipitated at redox boundaries at concretion perimeters and formed an inward-thickening rind. Acid generated by the oxidation reaction drove siderite dissolution to completion, creating the iron-poor core. Iron-oxide rinds are indicators of the former presence of siderite, a mineral that forms only under reducing conditions, during either early or late diagenesis. Siderite is vulnerable to complete oxidation upon exposure, so the distinctive rinded concretions are valuable clues that aid in deciphering diagenetic histories and for recognizing methanic floodplain palaeoenvironments and wet palaeoclimate.									22	1	0	0	6	0	24			0037-0746	1365-3091		WOS:000308944600005

Recent progress in the controllable synthesis of 2D nanomaterials has exhibited enhanced catalytic performance compared to bulk materials. This has led to significant interest in the exploitation of 2D nanomaterials for catalysis. There have been a variety of excellent reviews on 2D nanomaterials for catalysis, but related issues of differences and similarities between photocatalysis and electrocatalysis in 2D nanomaterials are still vacant. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview on the differences and similarities of photocatalysis and electrocatalysis in the latest 2D nanomaterials. Strategies and traps for performance enhancement of 2D nanocatalysts are highlighted, which point out the differences and similarities of series issues for photocatalysis and electrocatalysis. In addition, 2D nanocatalysts and their catalytic applications are discussed. Finally, opportunities, challenges and development directions for 2D nanocatalysts are described. The intention of this review is to inspire and direct interest in this research realm for the creation of future 2D nanomaterials for photocatalysis and electrocatalysis.									27	4	0	0	1	0	26			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000673979200001	34264418

The two major types of reactions that are catalyzed by AOXs are the hydroxylation of heterocycles and the oxidation of aldehydes to their corresponding carboxylic acids. Different animal species have different complements of AOX genes. The two extremes are represented in humans and rodents; whereas the human genome contains a single active gene (AOX1), those of rodents, such as mice, are endowed with four genes (Aox1-4), clustering on the same chromosome, each encoding a functionally distinct AOX enzyme. It still remains enigmatic why some species have numerous AOX enzymes, whereas others harbor only one functional enzyme. At present, little is known about the physiological relevance of AOX enzymes in humans and their additional forms in other mammals. These enzymes are expressed in the liver and play an important role in the metabolisms of drugs and other xenobiotics. In this review, we discuss the expression, tissue-specific roles, and substrate specificities of the different mammalian AOX enzymes and highlight insights into their physiological roles.									22	0	0	0	17	0	23			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000530288000016

To address this issue, we have investigated the structural evolution of LaxCe1-xO2-delta, where x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5. Rietveld refinements of the X-ray diffraction patterns reveal that the crystal structure belongs to a disordered fluorite phase for all samples. We find a systematic increase in the lattice parameter along with a gradual decrease in oxygen site occupancy with the increase in La3+ doping concentration. In Raman spectra of doped compounds, other than well-known crystalline F-2g and defect related modes, we observe the presence of an additional Raman mode. The Raman line-shape analysis indicates the non-resonant Frohlich character of this mode. Temperature dependent Raman measurements demonstrate unique characteristics of this Raman peak. In addition, from the change in relative intensity ratio of the Raman modes related to different types of defect states, we show that vacancies cannot be considered as isolated defects beyond a critical doping level. We propose that the evolution of Raman intensities of defect related modes and Frohlich mode with the doping level can be used as a marker to determine the role of electron-phonon coupling and anion vacancies in the catalytic activity of doped ceria. Furthermore, by studying the photocatalytic measurements for La3+ doped ceria compounds, we demonstrate that the anion vacancies do not always play a direct role in controlling functional properties.

The development of g-CN based photoelectrodes is still in its initial stage. The key step is to fabricate high-quality g-CN films, but this is restricted by limited production methods. Furthermore, pristine g-CN photoelectrodes exhibit low photocurrent density which cannot meet the demands of commercial application. Multiple modification strategies have been reported, including doping, monomer modification, cocatalysts and composite photoelectrodes, but a single modification method is unlikely to substantially improve the photocurrent density of g-CN photoelectrodes. Therefore, a multiple combination strategy may be an efficient approach. Hundreds of studies concerned with g-CN based PEC devices are reported each year, but there is a lack of comprehensive reviews to well summarize the research. It is imperative to provide researchers with a thorough understanding of the most recent progress in this field. In this review, we present the basic knowledge on PEC cells, our new perspective on the structure of g-CN, the achievements and deficiencies in the development of g-CN based photoelectrodes and some of our suggestions and new ideas about g-CN based films for PEC devices in the future.									50	0	0	0	2	0	50			2398-4902			WOS:000528920000002

Identification of an atypical membrane protein involved in the formation of protein disulfide bonds in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms								JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY				283	23			15762	15770		10.1074/jbc.M800982200				JUN 6 2008	2008	The evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis in cyanobacteria nearly three billion years ago provided abundant reducing power and facilitated the elaboration of numerous oxygen-dependent reactions in our biosphere. Cyanobacteria contain an internal thylakoid membrane system, the site of photosynthesis, and a typical Gram-negative envelope membrane system. Like other organisms, the extracytoplasmic space in cyanobacteria houses numerous cysteine-containing proteins. However, the existence of a biochemical system for disulfide bond formation in cyanobacteria remains to be determined. Extracytoplasmic disulfide bond formation in non-photosynthetic organisms is catalyzed by coordinated interaction between two proteins, a disulfide carrier and a disulfide generator. Here we describe a novel gene, SyndsbAB, required for disulfide bond formation in the extracytoplasmic space of cyanobacteria. The SynDsbAB orthologs are present in most cyanobacteria and chloroplasts of higher plants with fully sequenced genomes. The SynDsbAB protein contains two distinct catalytic domains that display significant similarity to proteins involved in disulfide bond formation in Escherichia coli and eukaryotes. Importantly, SyndsbAB complements E. coli strains defective in disulfide bond formation. In addition, the activity of E. coli alkaline phosphatase localized to the periplasm of Synechocystis 6803 is dependent on the function of SynDsbAB. Deletion of SyndsbAB in Synechocystis 6803 causes significant growth impairment under photoautotrophic conditions and results in hyper-sensitivity to dithiothreitol, a reductant, whereas diamide, an oxidant had no effect on the growth of the mutant strains. We conclude that SynDsbAB is a critical protein for disulfide bond formation in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms and required for their optimal photoautotrophic growth.									57	0	1	0	52	1	58				1083-351X		WOS:000256332500033	18413314

It has been demonstrated that these ions can be exchanged with Sr2+ and Br-, respectively, and that these ion exchanges modify the kinetics of some electron transfer reactions at the Mn4Ca cluster level (Ishida et at, J. Biol. Chem. 283 (2008) 13330-13340). It has been proposed from thermoluminescence experiments that the kinetic effects arise, at least in part, from a decrease in the free energy level of the Mn4Ca cluster in the S-3 state though some changes on the acceptor side were also observed. Therefore, in the present work, by using thin-layer cell spectroelectrochemistry, the effects of the Ca2+/Sr2+ and Cl-/Br- exchanges on the redox potential of the primary quinone electron acceptor Q(A), E-m(Q(A)/Q(A)(-)), were investigated. Since the previous studies on the Ca2+/Sr2+ and Cl-/Br- exchanges were performed in PsbA3-containing PSII purified from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus, we first investigated the influences of the PsbA1/PsbA3 exchange on E-m(Q(A)/Q(A)(-)). Here we show that i) the E-m(Q(A)/Q(A)(-)) was up-shifted by ca. +38 mV in PsbA3-PSII when compared to PsbA1-PSII and ii) the Ca2+/Sr2+ exchange up-shifted the E-m(Q(A)/Q(A)(-)) by ca. +27 mV, whereas the Cl-/Br- exchange hardly influenced E-m(Q(A)/Q(A)(-)). On the basis of the results of E-m(Q(A)/Q(A)(-)) together with previous thermoluminescence measurements, the ion-exchange effects on the energetics in PSII are discussed. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we investigated the dynamic toxicities of naphthalene-derived secondary organic aerosol (NSOA) in a human bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B) and identified the chemical components responsible for toxicities. The chemical composition of NSOA was found to vary with six simulated atmospheric aging conditions (C-1-C-6), as characterized by high resolution mass spectrometry and ion mobility mass spectrometry. Global proteome profiling reveals dynamic evolution in toxicity: Stronger proteome-wide impacts were detected in fresh NSOA, but the effects declined along with atmospheric aging. While Nrf2-regulated proteins (e.g., NQO1) were significantly up-regulated, the majority (78 to 97%) of proteins from inflammation and other pathways were down-regulated by NSOA exposure (e.g., Rho GTPases). This pattern is distinct from the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated toxicity pathway, and an alternative cysteine reaction pathway was revealed by the decreased abundance of proteins (e.g., MT1X) prone to posttranslational thiol modification. This pathway was further validated by observing decreased Nrf2 response in reporter cells, after preincubating NSOA with cysteine. Ethynyl-naphthalene probe was employed to confirm the alkylation of cellular proteome thiols on the proteome-wide level by fresh NSOA via in-gel fluorescence imaging. Nontarget analysis identified several unsaturated carbonyls, including naphthoquinones and hydroxylated naphthoquinones, as the toxic components responsible for cysteine reactivity. Our study provides insights into the dynamic toxicities of NSOA during atmospheric aging and identifies short-lived unsaturated carbonyls as the predominant toxic components at the posttranslational level.									7	0	0	0	5	0	7			0027-8424	1091-6490		WOS:000642208600004	32989125

Their surfaces may impact the gas bubble nucleation rate, thus influencing the efficiency of gas evolution. However, the effects of the 1D nanostructured surfaces on the bubble nucleation have not been studied to date. Herein, these effects are theoretically analyzed, based on the changes of free energy for a bubble nucleus forming inside/outside a nanotube. The results show that compared to flat surfaces, the inner tube wall favors the bubble nucleation, while the outer wall has an opposite effect. These differences become increasingly significant with tube radius R-t reducing when R-t<10r(*) (r(*)-bubble equilibrium radius). The size effect is further verified experimentally for bubble nucleation on TiO2 nanotube arrays. The sensitivity of bubble nucleation to nanostructure dimensions should be considered in designing high-efficient photocatalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0003-6951	1077-3118		WOS:000484671000023

The La-rich compounds exhibit an inter-growing cubic and tetragonal structure whereas the Pr-rich show a tetragonal structure. Cathode polarization resistances, estimated from electrochemical impedance (EIS), take values around 0.15 and 0.04 cm(2) in air at 600 and 700 degrees C, respectively. The O-2-reduction mechanism and its kinetic coefficients, O-ion diffusion (D-chem) and O-surface exchange (k(chem)), were studied by applying the ALS model for macro homogenous porous electrodes to the EIS data, in combination with microstructural parameters obtained from three-dimensional tomography using focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (3D FIB-SEM). The diffusion coefficients for samples with mixing of phases take values of D-chem approximate to 10(-6) cm(2) s(-1), at 700 degrees C in air, whereas the pure tetragonal phases present lower values D-chem approximate to 10(-8) cm(2) s(-1). On the contrary the k(chem) for all samples takes values ranging between 0.4 and 1 x 10(-4) cm s(-1) at 700 degrees C in air. In addition, the origin of time evolution of polarization at 700 degrees C in air was evaluated by combining the EIS spectra as a function of time and the ex situ sample characterization of fresh and tested samples by 3D FIB-SEM tomography and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Little changes of microstructures were detected, whereas an increasing of the amount of a water-soluble Ba surface species in comparison with total cation surface segregation was observed for all samples after the ageing. This may constitute the main reason causing the polarization resistance degradation. However, the analysis of time evolution shows, that contrary to the situations reported for SrO segregation in Sr-based perovskites, the D-chem is the coefficient mainly affected for compositions with inter-grown phases. At the same time, both D-chem and k(chem) decreases with time when only the tetragonal phase is present.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000444698200045

LSQ14an and SN 2015bn both display late-time spectra similar to galaxy-subtracted spectra of SN 2007bi, and the class shows strong similarity with broad-lined SNe Ic such as SN 1998bw. Near-infrared observations of SN 2015bn show a strong Ca II triplet, O I 9263, O I 1.13 mu m, and Mg I 1.50 mu m, but no distinct He, Si, or S emission. The high Ca II NIR/[Ca II] 7291, 7323 ratio of similar to 2 indicates a high electron density of n(e) greater than or similar to 10(8) cm(-3). Spectral models of oxygen-zone emission are investigated to put constraints on the emitting region. Models require M(O-zone) greater than or similar to 10 M-circle dot to produce enough [O I] 6300, 6364 luminosity, irrespective of the powering situation and the density. The high oxygen-zone mass, supported by high estimated magnesium masses, points to explosions of massive CO cores, requiring M-ZAMS greater than or similar to 40M(circle dot). Collisions of pair-instability pulsations do not provide enough mass to account for the emission. [O II] and [O III] lines emerge naturally in many models, which strengthens the identification of broad [O II] 7320, 7330, [O III] 4363, and [O III] 4959, 5007 in some spectra. A small filling factor f less than or similar to 0.01 for the O/Mg zone is needed to produce enough luminosity in Mg I] 4571, Mg I 1.504 mu m, and O I recombination lines, which shows that the ejecta is clumped. We review the constraints from the nebular spectral modeling in the context of the various scenarios proposed for SLSNe.									57	0	0	0	1	0	57			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000393455400013

The redox-active herbicides feature an iron(III) ethylenediuninetetracetate [Fe-III-(EDTA)] electron-acceptor group linked to a Q(B)-site binding dimethylphenylurea moiety by a hydrocarbon spacer. Like the nitroxyl-based redox-active herbicides previously described (Bocarsly, J. R.; Brudvig, G. W. J. Am. Chem. Sec. 1992, 114, 9762-9767), metal-containing herbicides accept electrons from the donor side of PSII while bound to the Q(B) site and restrict the S-state cycling to two stable charge separations. The use of Fe-III-(EDTA) as an electron acceptor allows turnover at low temperatures. EPR studies of PSII upon continuous illumination at 225 K with 0.7 mM of redox-active herbicide, Fe-III-(EDTA) linked by an ethane spacer to a dimethylphenyl urea group (2), produced a stable two-step S-1 to S-3 advance of the O-2-evolving complex (OEC) and a stoichiometric reduction of the Fe-III-(EDTA) moiety of the herbicide, while a control sample with 0.02 InM DCMU [3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethyl-urea] and 0.7 mM of 4 exhibited only a one-step SI to St advance of the OEC without significant reduction of the Fe-III-(EDTA) moiety of the herbicide. Similar EPR results were obtained for 7, Fe-III-(EDTA) linked Ca the dimethylphenylurea group by a pentane spacer. O-2-evolution inhibition studies show that appending the Fe-III-(EDTA) moiety to the phenylurea herbicide causes a significant decrease in the binding affinity compared to that of DCMU. On the basis of O-2-evolution studies with various herbicide derivatives and different PSII sample types, the observed decrease in binding affinities is attributed to the degree of accessibility of the Q(B)-binding pocket to the herbicides and to electrostatic and hydrophilicity factors. The present study describes the use of novel metal-containing herbicides in studying long-range electron transfer in PSII and in trapping photogenerated two-electron oxidized intermediate states of the O-2-evolving complex.									6	0	0	0	3	0	6			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000087559700019

The basis of the interdependence is the complementation of photosynthetic CO2 assimilation and atmospheric nitrogen fixation. Green color of the colonies indicated that the algal cells had enough nitrogen to synthesize chlorophylls. The chlorophyll content was nearly 40 % of the control cells. The relatively high rate of photosynthetic oxygen evolution proved that nitrogen was effectively used for building up a well functioning photosynthetic apparatus. This was supported by the analysis of photosystems and ultrastructural investigations. In comparison with degreened algae cultured on nitrogen-free medium, the chloroplasts in the symbiont algal cells contained a well-developed, stacked thylakoid membrane system without extreme starch or lipid accumulation. The occurrence of the fungus in the association greatly increased the chlorophyll content. Far fewer types of amino acids were excreted by the tripartite cultures than by pure cultures. Cystathionine, which is a common intermediate in the sulfur-containing amino acid metabolism, was produced in high quantities by the tripartite symbiosis. This can mostly be attributed to the activity of the fungus.									13	1	0	0	13	0	14			0015-5632	1874-9356		WOS:000281277900022	20680580

Powder X-ray diffraction of the as-synthesized samples showed a pattern characteristic of hydrotalcite-like (HT-like) structure (JCPDS: 41-1428). Thermal analyses of these samples showed four stages of weight loss/heat change when recorded in nitrogen. Analysis of the evolved gases characterized the nature of these transformations. The thermoanalytical effects differed significantly especially for the high-temperature transformations, when the treatment was performed in oxygen. In situ powder X-ray diffraction of the samples was carried out to elucidate the phase evolution of these compounds. Surprisingly formation of CuO was noted at temperatures around 200degreesC well below the destruction of the layered network. The nature of the resulting phases varied with both the nature of the co-bivalent metal ion and the heating atmosphere. FT-IR spectroscopy confirmed the retention of carbonate ions at higher temperatures (above 700degreesC), although the concentration of carbonate anion (most likely unidentate) varied with the calcination temperature. The crystallinity of CuO increased significantly above 600degreesC, probably through dissociation of copper oxycarbonate. Significant differences in the thermal transformation temperatures (for the third and the fourth transformations) of these samples containing different co-bivalent metal ions were not observed. This suggests that an association of the co-bivalent metal ions and/or trivalent metal ion in this phase is unlikely. A plausible thermal evolution scheme of these hydrotalcites is proposed.

Consistent with this idea, neuroimaging studies have found that tool knowledge retrieval activates not only a region of the left premotor cortex involved in hand action, but also an adjacent region that is typically described as a language center. We examined whether this pattern of activation is best described as the result of a single process, related to both action and language, or the result of two independent processes. We identified two distinct neural components that jointly contribute to this response: a posterior region centered in the premotor cortex, which responds to motor knowledge retrieval, and an anterior region centered in the left frontal operculum, which responds to lexical competition. Crucial to the interpretation of the premotor response, individual variation in motor experience was highly correlated with the magnitude of the response in the premotor cortex, but not in the prefrontal cortex.									32	0	1	0	21	0	33			0898-929X	1530-8898		WOS:000235368300010	16494686

The surface properties of such nanoparticles are also of paramount importance in determining their photocatalytic activity. Addressing the combination of surface effects in catalysis on metals, with the electronic properties of hybrid nanoparticles, we examined the effect of coating CdS-Au hybrid nanoparticles with sulfide, an anion that is expected to bind strongly to both domains, on the photocatalytic functionality. Upon sulfide coating, one-electron processes - namely the oxidative production of hydroxyl radicals and the reductive production of superoxide - were increased, whereas the activity for two-electron reduction processes - H-2 and hydrogen peroxide generation - was hampered. These findings indicate a double-edged sword effect for sulfide coating that on one side relieves the hole extraction bottleneck from the semiconductor segment and, on the other hand, poisons the metal domain restricting its reductive capacity for the two-electron processes requiring a chemisorption step on the metal surface. The work further demonstrates the importance of surface properties for the photocatalytic action of such hybrid nanoparticle systems.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000737911800001	34958193

It was found that the selective dissolution of Al leads to the formation of a metallic Zn(0) surface layer. In the metallic form, this layer did not seem to affect the dissolution rate of Al. However, its oxidation led to a significant decrease in the Al dissolution rate, referred to as the negative correlation effect. These mechanisms were identified and characterized via linear sweep voltammetry and potentiostatic experiments.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0010-938X	1879-0496		WOS:000457950400001

The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscope and ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The role of Au in this system was discussed during the degradation of rhodamine B and tetracycline and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation. The influence of BiOCl dosage on the photocatalytic activity was also systematically investigated. The result found that the photocatalytic activity was improved using the as-fabricated CN/Au/BiOCl Z-scheme heterojunction than g-C3N4 or BiOCl. Besides, the fast separation rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and the improved light absorption in visible ranges of CN/Au/BiOCl samples might be related to the fact that the construction of Z-scheme could improve the optical and conductive properties and enhance the final photocatalytic property. From the free radicals trapping experiments, it was found that the photogenerated holes of BiOCl were the predominant active species in the photocatalytic process.									25	2	0	0	5	0	25			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000423711900031

Herein, based on boreholes and well logging data, we selected sandstone samples representing different epigenetic alteration environments as the research object and comprehensively utilized polarizing microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, electron probe analysis, elemental analysis, and other test methods to research sandstone genesis. The main altered minerals in the sandstone of this area include limonite, pyrite, achavalite, carbonate, sulfate, clay, and uranium minerals. The complex characteristics of alteration minerals indicate multi-stage fluid mixed mineralization in this area. According to the relationship between the major elements in different types of sand bodies, the components were classified into three groups. The first is the reduction media group, including CaO, MnO, total oxygen carbon (TOC), S, U, and burning loss. The second is the detrital particle group, including SiO2, K2O, and Na2O, and the third contains the clay and volcano component group, including Fe2O3, P2O5, TiO2, FeO, MgO, and Al2O3. Among these, the content of reduction media is positively correlated with uranium enrichment, whereas detrital particles and clay components reflect the influence of alteration on the sand body composition, which indirectly affects the uranium adsorption and precipitation. Through the normalization of rare earth element (REE) chondrites, we find that the distribution patterns of REEs in rocks with different geochemical environments show a fractionation of light and heavy rare earth elements (HREEs), a right-leaning enrichment of light rare earth elements (LREEs), and relatively flat HREE. Further, via the Post Archean Australian Shale (PAAS) normalization, we observe that the mudstone of the Zhiluo Formation exhibits a relatively flat curve, whereas the sandstones have strongly positive Eu anomalies. The difference in REE values for different types of sand bodies indicates that, although all types of rocks have a similar sedimentary environment, their original sediments underwent fluid alterations such as oxidation and reduction. Based on the uranium mineralization evolution history in the study area, the water-rock reaction process and mineral-alteration sequence were determined on the basis of alteration types and elemental concentrations. Our findings provide new insight into the petrological significance, mineralogy, and geochemical composition of uranium deposits in the Ordos Basin.									12	1	0	0	0	0	13			0169-1368	1872-7360		WOS:000484869200050

The m-type thioredoxin (TrxA) is the only Trx present in all oxygenic photosynthetic organisms. Extensive biochemical and proteomic analyses have identified many TrxA target proteins in different photosynthetic organisms. However, the precise function of this essential protein in vivo is still poorly known. In this study, we generated a conditional Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 mutant strain (STXA2) using an on-off promoter that is able to survive with only 2% of the TrxA level of the wild-type (WT) strain. STXA2 characterization revealed that TrxA depletion results in growth arrest and pronounced impairment of photosynthesis and the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle. Analysis of the in vivo redox state of the bifunctional enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase/sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase showed higher levels of oxidation that affected enzyme activity in STXA2. This result implies that TrxA-mediated redox regulation of the CBB cycle is conserved in both cyanobacteria and chloroplasts, although the targets have different evolutionary origins. The STXA2 strain also accumulated more reactive oxygen species and was more sensitive to oxidative stress than the WT. Analysis of the in vivo redox state of 2-Cys peroxiredoxin revealed full oxidation, corresponding with TrxA depletion. Overall, these results indicate that depletion of TrxA in STXA2 greatly alters the cellular redox state, interfering with essential processes such as photosynthetic machinery operativity, carbon assimilation, and oxidative stress response. The TrxA regulatory role appears to be conserved along the evolution of oxygenic photosynthetic organisms.A cyanobacterial mutant strain with very low TrxA (m-type thioredoxin) content is unable to maintain cellular redox state, affecting the function of essential processes.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000720751600030	34618018

This study was aimed at unveiling the cellular strategies enabling the marine gammaproteobacterium Vibrio harveyi to adapt and persist in natural aquatic systems. We found that, although V. harveyi incubation in seawater microcosm at 20 A degrees C for 2 weeks did not change cell viability and culturability, it led to a progressive reduction in the average cell size. Microarray analysis revealed that this morphological change was accompanied by a profound decrease in gene expression affecting the central carbon metabolism, major biosynthetic pathways, and energy production. In contrast, V. harveyi elevated expression of genes closely linked to the composition and function of cell envelope. In addition to triggering lipid degradation via the beta-oxidation pathway and apparently promoting the use of endogenous fatty acids as a major energy and carbon source, V. harveyi upregulated genes involved in ancillary mechanisms important for sustaining iron homeostasis, cell resistance to the toxic effect of reactive oxygen species, and recycling of amino acids. The above adaptation mechanisms and morphological changes appear to represent the major hallmarks of the initial V. harveyi response to starvation.									20	1	0	0	18	0	20			0095-3628	1432-184X		WOS:000361984700009	25903990

However, the chloroplasts in the PSI-H- and PSI-L-less plants contained fewer and more extended grana stacks. The plants lacking PSI-H or PSI-L were characterised with respect to their photosynthetic performance. Wild-type plants adjusted the non-photochemical fluorescence quenching to maintain constant levels of PSII quantum yield and reduction of the plastoquinone pool. In contrast, the plants deficient in state transitions had a more reduced plastoquinone pool and consequently, a less efficient PSII-photochemistry under growth-light conditions and in state 2. The maximal photosynthetic capacity and the quantum efficiency of oxygen evolution were diminished by 8-14% in the PSI-H-less plants. Under growth-light conditions, the stroma was similarly reduced in the PSI-H-less plants and the rate of cyclic electron transport was unchanged. Pigment analysis showed that the xanthophyll cycle was not upregulated in order to compensate for the lack of state transitions. In general, the plants lacking PSI-H and PSI-L showed a decreased ability to optimise photosynthesis according to the light conditions.									32	0	0	0	33	0	34			0032-0781			WOS:000180841900007	12552146

While cyt c-553, a soluble cyt that donates an electron to P700, was detected in the supernatant of osmotic disruption of lysozyme-treated cells, cyt c550 was detected only in the thylakoid membrane fraction, being tightly bound to thylakoids, and its removal required sonication in the presence of 1 M CaCl2. Upon further fractionation of the thylakoids into photosystem (PS) I and PSII by lauryl dimethylamine N-oxide solubilization, cyt c550 was exclusively concentrated in the crude PSII fraction together with cyt f, with no significant amount being detected in any of the soluble and PSI fractions. Upon further fractionation of the crude PSII by n-dodecyl beta-D-maltoside solubilization followed by column chromatography, cyt c550 was detected exclusively in the purified PSII core complex fraction but not in any other fractions. A 12-kDa protein, one of the extrinsic components of cyanobacterial PSII, exhibited completely the same behavior as that of cyt c550 during these fractionation procedures. These results, coupled with our previous results that cyt c550 binds stoichiometrically to the cyanobacterial PSII core complex and enhances O2 evolution (Shen, J.-R., and Inoue, Y. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 1825-1832), indicate that there is only one species of cyt c550 in cyanobacterial cells and that this cyt is exclusively associated with PSII as a functional component for O2 evolution.									31	0	0	0	28	0	33			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:A1993LY01900073	8397205	
J	VANRENSBURG, L; KRUGER, GHJ								DIFFERENTIAL INHIBITION OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS (INVIVO AND INVITRO), AND CHANGES IN CHLOROPHYLL A FLUORESCENCE INDUCTION KINETICS OF 4 TOBACCO CULTIVARS UNDER DROUGHT STRESS								JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY				141	3			357	365		10.1016/S0176-1617(11)81748-7				MAR 1993	1993	This study was conducted in an attempt to explain the observed difference in drought tolerance of four cultivars of Nicotiana tabacum L., by monitoring plant water status and several aspects of photosynthesis, including chlorophyll a fluorescence, under controlled environmental conditions. Drought stress of increasing intensity, ranging from light to severe, was induced over a twelve-day period by withholding water. Photosynthetic oxygen evolution was monitored in vivo at a CO2 concentration exceeding 5 % to exclude any stomatal limitation and was expressed as quantum efficiency (PHI). Partial photochemical reactions were determined polarographically with isolated thylakoids of the drought-stressed tissue. From the Kautsky curves the I/P-ratio and DELTAF-values were determined at various decreasing leaf water potentials (PSI(L)).All four cultivars exhibited a drought stress-induced decline in PHI, PSI-, PSII- and PSI + PSII-activity, but the extent and nature differed among the different cultivars. The PHI-values of the drought-tolerant cultivars were characterized by a fast initial decline that stabilized as the PSI(L) declined, whereas the PHI-values of drought-sensitive cultivars did not show a similar response, but declined at a slow continuous rate as the drought stress intensified. The PSII-activity and PSI- + PSII-activity were influenced in much the same way. PSII-activity was found to be more sensitive than PSI-activity and even more so in the case of the drought-sensitive than in the drought-tolerant cultivars. It was concluded that the observed stress-induced decline in PHI and PSI- + PSII-activity could largely be ascribed to an inhibition of PSII-activity. This conclusion is corroborated by both the fluorescence data regarding the I/P-ratio and DELTAF-values, of which the former was found to increase earlier and reach higher end-values in the drought-sensitive cultivars, and the latter, which indicated that the drought-tolerant cultivars were characterized by a higher photosynthetic efficiency at low PSI(L). A mechanism is proposed which might retard or reverse drought stress induced stromal acidification and might explain the apparently higher photosynthetic dehydration tolerance of the drought-tolerant cultivars. The possible involvement of ABA is discussed.									19	0	0	0	17	0	19			0176-1617			WOS:A1993KY07900018

Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms revealed that higher steam activation temperatures and/or times promoted the creation of new micropores and widened the existing micropores, consequently decreasing the surface area and total pore volume. Optimum conditions included an activation temperature of 850 degrees C, activation time of 120 min, and steam flush generated from deionized water of 0.2 cm(3) min(-1). Under these conditions, AC with a BET surface area of 1210 m(2) g(-1) and total pore volume of 0.542 cm(-3) g(-1) was obtained. Changes in surface chemistry were determined through Boehm titration, pH measurement, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Results revealed the presence of a large number of basic groups on the surface of the pyrolyzed char and AC. Steam activation did not affect the species of oxygen-containing groups but changed the contents of these species when compared with pyrolyzed char. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the surface morphology of the products. AC obtained under optimum conditions showed a monolayer adsorption capacity of 330 mg g(-1) for methylene blue (MB), which demonstrates its excellent potential for MB adsorption applications.

The repulsive interactions among H, C, and S dissolved in molten metallic iron are taken into account. It is shown that partition coefficient of H between molten metallic iron and silicate melt increases with pressure and temperature. Under the presence of Fe-rich metal, CO2 content in silicate melt is suggested to be very low because of low oxygen fugacity under such condition. Assuming a homogeneous accretion of planetesimals with the composition given by the two-component model slightly modified from Ringwood [1977] and Wanke [1981], it is shown that C is preferentially partitioned to molten metallic iron and quite less to silicate melt, whereas a substantial proportion of H is partitioned to silicate melt as H2O and also to molten metallic iron as interstitial atoms. For such concentrations of H, C, and S, the effect of thermodynamic interaction among them in molten metallic iron is not strong enough to cause the oversaturation of graphite. H and C partitioned to molten metallic iron may account for a significant portion of the density deficit in Earth's core. The estimated amount of H2O partitioned to silicate melt is possibly large enough to explain the sources for (1) H2O in the hydrosphere and mantle, (2) oxygen which partially oxidizes ferrous iron to ferric iron in the mantle, and (3) oxidant for metals which may fail to segregate to the core and act as the source of the highly siderophile elements in the mantle of the present Earth. The higher H/C and the lower C/(36) Ar ratios in the silicate Earth including the hydrosphere compared to various classes of meteorites are possibly explained if these elements are derived from the early mantle material after the H and C partitioning to molten metallic iron and core segregation. Accretion of the late veneer material such as the highly oxidized, CI chondrite-like material seems difficult to explain such elemental abundance pattern without invoking unknown large volatile reservoir in the mantle.									64	1	1	0	6	0	65			2169-9097	2169-9100		WOS:A1996UT70100008		
J	Kolb, U; Politano, M								The contribution of O-Ne-Mg novae to the Al-26 production in the Galaxy								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				319	3			909	922						MAR 1997	1997	Recent COMPTEL observations revealed inhomogeneities in the spatial distribution of the Galactic Al-26 1.809 MeV gamma-ray emission, which reduces the required amount of Al-26 in a homogeneous background from similar to 3 M. (the value assuming all of the radiation is from a homogeneous background) to similar to 1 M.. Using recent nova population models and simulations of classical nova outbursts we reinvestigate the question of whether nova outbursts on oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarfs (ONeMg WDs) contribute significantly to the production of Al-26 in the Galaxy. We find an upper limit of similar to 3 M. for the amount of Al-26 produced by ONeMg novae in the Galaxy, if we adopt a value of 30% for the fraction f(ONeMg) Of novae in our models that are ONeMg novae and choose optimal models and parameter values. Uncertainties in both observations and theory do not allow us to quote a lower limit with any confidence at this time. Choosing models and parameter values that are more consistent with independent observational quantities gives an Al-26 production of similar to 0.15 M., again for an assumed f(ONeMg) Of 30%. However, this value is dependent on our assumption of choosing the same amount of mixing between the underlying WD material and the accreted companion material for the entire population. If the mean amount of mixing in ONeMg novae is similar to a factor of 2 higher than the mean maximum amount of mixing for all novae, then we estimate that ONeMg novae can produce a sufficient amount of Al-26 (similar to 1 M.) to account for the entire diffuse background emission observed by COMPTEL. We explore to what extent ejecta abundances in well-studied novae support this possibility.									17	1	0	0	0	0	18			0004-6361			WOS:A1997WR87800025

Herein, a capacity boost effect of Li- and Na-ion batteries was presented and clarified by nitrogen-doped graphene sheets. The reversible capacities progressively increased from 637.4 to 1050.4 mAh g(-1) (164.8% increase) in Li-ion cell tests from 20 to 185 cycles, and from 187.3 to 247.5 mAh g(-1) (132.1% increase) in Na-ion cell tests from 50 to 500 cycles. The mechanism of the capacity boost is proposed as an electrochemical induced cascading evolution of graphitic N to pyridinic and/or pyrrolic N, during which only these graphitic N adjacent pyridinic or pyrrolic structures can be taken precedence. The original and new generated pyridinic and pyrrolic N have strengthened binding energies to Li/Na atoms, thus increased the Li/Na coverage and delivered a progressive capacity boost with cycles until the entire favorable graphitic N transform into pyridinic and pyrrolic N.									40	2	0	0	0	0	40			1944-8244			WOS:000385469000033	27632809

A search for evidence of the nu-process during Type II supernovae is presented. Absorption from interstellar F I is seen in spectra of HD 208440 and HD 209339A acquired with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer. In order to extract the column density for F I from the line at 954 Angstrom, absorption from H-2 has to be modeled and then removed. Our analysis indicates that for H-2 column densities less than about 3 x 10(20) cm(-2), the amount of F I can be determined from lambda954. For these two sight lines, there is no clear indication for enhanced F abundances resulting from the nu-process in a region shaped by past supernovae.									34	0	0	0	0	0	34			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000226589100018

We report here findings of an in situ/operando study of such details of a ternary nanoalloy under the propane oxidation condition using high-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction coupled to atomic pair distribution function (HE-XRD/PDF) analysis and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). The catalysts are derived by alloying Pt with different combinations of second (Pd) and third (Ni) transition metals, showing a strong dependence of the catalytic activity on the Ni content. The evolution of the phase structure of the nanoalloy is characterized by HE-XRD/PDF probing of the lattice strain, whereas the surface activity is monitored by DRIFTS detection of the surface intermediate formation during the oxidation of propane by oxygen. The results reveal the dominance of the surface intermediate species featuring a lower degree of oxygenation upon the first C-C bond cleavage on the lower-Ni-content nanoalloy and a higher degree of oxygenation upon the second C-C bond cleavage on the higher-Ni-content nanoalloy. The face-centered-cubic-type phase structures of the nanoalloys under the oxidation condition are shown to exhibit Ni-content-dependent changes of lattice strains, featuring the strongest strain with little variation for the higher-Ni-content nanoalloy, in contrast to the weaker strains with oscillatory variation for the lower-Ni-content nanoalloys. This process is also accompanied by oxygenation of the metal components in the nanoalloy, showing a higher degree of oxygenation for the higher-Ni-content nanoalloy. These subtle differences in phase structure and surface activity changes correlate with the Ni-composition-dependent catalytic activity of the nanoalloys, which sheds a fresh light on the correlation between the dynamic change of atomic strains and the surface reactivity and has significant implications for the design of oxidation catalysts with enhanced activities.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000787543300035	35195398

The simplest and representative cofactor, heme b, is bound within the heme pocket via noncovalent interaction in many hemoproteins, suggesting that the cofactor is removable from the protein, leaving a unique cavity. Since the cavity functions as a coordination sphere for heme, it is of particular interest to investigate replacement of native heme with an artificial metal complex, because the substituted metal complex will be stabilized in the heme pocket while providing alternative chemical properties. Thus, cofactor substitution has great potential for engineering of hemoproteins with alternative functions. For these studies, myoglobin has been a focus of our investigations, because it is a well-known oxygen storage hemoprotein. However, the heme pocket of myoglobin has been only arranged for stabilizing the heme-bound dioxygen, so the structure is not suitable for activation of small molecules such as H2O2 and O-2 as well as for binding an external substrate. Thus, the conversion of myoglobin to an enzyme-like biocatalyst has presented significant challenges. The results of our investigations have provided useful information for chemists and biologists. Our own efforts to develop functionalized myoglobin have focused on the incorporation of a chemically modified cofactor into apomyoglobin in order to (1) construct an artificial substrate-binding site near the heme pocket, (2) increase cofactor reactivity, or (3) promote a new reaction that has never before been catalyzed by a native heme enzyme. In pursuing these objectives, we first found that myoglobin reconstituted with heme having a chemically modified heme-propionate side chain at the exit of the heme pocket has peroxidase activity with respect to oxidation of phenol derivatives. Our recent investigations have succeeded in enhancing oxidation and oxygenation activities of myoglobin as well as promoting new reactions by reconstitution of myoglobin with new porphyrinoid metal complexes. Incorporation of suitable metal porphyrinoids into the heme pocket has produced artificial enzymes capable of efficiently generating reactive high valent metal-oxo and metallocarbene intermediates to achieve the catalytic hydroxylation of C(sp(3))-H bonds and cyclopropanation of olefin molecules, respectively. In other efforts, we have focused on nitrobindin, an NO-binding hemoprotein, because aponitrobindin includes a beta-barrel cavity, which provides a robust structure highly similar to that of the native holoprotein. It was expected that the aponitrobindin would be suitable for development as a protein scaffold for a metal complex. Recently, it was confirmed that several organometallic complexes can bind to this scaffold and function as catalysts promoting hydrogen evolution or C-C bond formation. The hydrophobic beta-barrel structure plays a significant role in substrate binding as well as controlling the stereoselectivity of the reactions. Furthermore, these catalytic activities and stereoselectivities are remarkably improved by mutation-dependent modifications of the cavity structure for the artificial cofactor. This Account demonstrates how apoproteins of hemoproteins can provide useful protein scaffolds for metal complexes. Further development of these concepts will provide a useful strategy for generation of robust and useful artificial metalloenzymes.									78	1	0	0	24	0	78			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000465189800011	30933477

Easily accessible alkylzinc alkoxides have been widely exploited as single-source precursors of ZnO-based nanomaterials but their multi-step decomposition pathways have not been understood in detail. Herein, the formation mechanism of ZnO nanocrystals via solid-state thermal decomposition of a model pre-organised alkylzinc alkoxide precursor, i.e. [tBuZn(mu(3)-OtBu)](4), is elucidated using in situ valence-to-core X-ray emission (v2c-XES) and high energy resolution off-resonant spectroscopy (HEROS) in conjunction with theoretical calculations. Combination of in situ spectroscopic measurements and theoretical simulations indicates that the precursor structural evolution is initiated by the homolytic cleavage of the R-Zn bond, which leads to the formation of a transient radical ([center dot Zn(mu(3)-OR)][RZn(mu(3)-OR)](3)) species, which is responsible for the initial decomposition process. The ensuing multistep transformations involve the formation of intermediate radical zinc oxo-alkoxide clusters with gapless electronic states. Hitherto, the formation of clusters of this type has not been considered either as intermediate structures en route to a semiconductor ZnO phase or as potential species accounting for various defect states of ZnO NCs, particularly the singly charged oxygen vacancy, V-o(+).									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			2051-6347	2051-6355		WOS:000444245600013

The Fe treatment of NiO thin films enabled Si-based photo anode assemblies to obtain a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) (requirement for >10% efficient devices) at 1.15 V versus RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) under red-light (38.6 mW/cm(2)) irradiation. Thus, the photoanodes were harvesting similar to 80 mV of free energy (voltage), which places them among the best-performing Si-based photoanodes in alkaline media. The stability was proven by chronoamperometry at 1.3 V versus RHE for 300 h. Furthermore, measurements with electrochemical quartz crystal microbalances coupled with ICP-MS showed minor corrosion under dark operation. Extrapolation of the corrosion rate showed stability for more than 2000 days of continuous operation. Therefore, protection by Fe-treated NiO films is a promising strategy to achieve highly efficient and stable photoanodes.									88	4	0	0	9	0	88			1948-7185			WOS:000343364900002	26278593	
J	Bostick, David L.; Brooks, Charles L., III								Statistical Determinants of Selective Ionic Complexation: Ions in Solvent, Transport Proteins, and Other "Hosts"								BIOPHYSICAL JOURNAL				96	11			4470	4492		10.1016/j.bpj.2009.03.001				JUN 3 2009	2009	To provide utility in understanding the molecular evolution of ion-selective biomembrane channels/transporters, globular proteins, and ionophoric compounds, as well as in guiding their modification and design, we present a statistical mechanical basis for deconstructing the impact of the coordination structure and chemistry of selective multidentate ionic complexes. The deconstruction augments familiar ideas in liquid structure theory to realize the ionic complex as an open ion-ligated system acting under the influence of an "external field" provided by the host (or surrounding medium). Using considerations derived from this basis, we show that selective complexation arises from exploitation of a particular ion's coordination preferences. These preferences derive from a balance of interactions much like that which dictates the Hofmeister effect. By analyzing the coordination-state space of small family IA and VIIA ions in simulated fluid media, we derive domains of coordinated states that confer selectivity for a given ion upon isolating and constraining particular attributes (order parameters) of a complex comprised of a given type of ligand. We demonstrate that such domains may be used to rationalize the ion-coordinated environments provided by selective ionophores and biological ion channels/transporters of known structure, and that they can serve as a means toward deriving rational design principles for ion-selective hosts.									22	0	0	0	12	0	22			0006-3495	1542-0086		WOS:000266650400013	19486671

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their composites as well as derivatives, with high porosity and tailorable chemical components, have drawn increasing interest in gas storage, energy conversion, and environment remediation in the past decades. This review highlights recent achievements on applications of MOF-based materials in the renewable energy and environmental science. Specifically, the developments and advantages of MOF-based materials are first presented and discussed. We then focus on the fabrication strategies of MOF-based materials and their applications in areas including gas adsorption, energy conversion, and storage. The well-established findings provide an indepth understanding for the construction and application of these advanced materials. This review concludes with some outlooks for the fields of energy conversion and environmental science by using MOF-based materials.									510	25	0	0	32	0	517			2542-4351			WOS:000425179500013		
J	Olson, John S.								Lessons Learned from 50 Years of Hemoglobin Research: Unstirred and Cell-Free Layers, Electrostatics, Baseball Gloves, and Molten Globules								ANTIOXIDANTS & REDOX SIGNALING				32	4			228	246		10.1089/ars.2019.7876		OCT 2019		FEB 1 2020	2020	Recent Advances: In this review, I have described four key conclusions from work done by my group and our close colleagues. (i) O-2 uptake by mammalian red cells is limited by diffusion through unstirred water layers adjacent to the cell surface and across cell-free layers adjacent to vessel walls. (ii) In most vertebrates, hemoglobins (Hbs) and myoglobins (Mbs), the distal histidine at the E7 helical position donates a strong hydrogen bond to bound O-2, which selectively enhances O-2 affinity, prevents carbon monoxide poisoning, and markedly slows autoxidation. (iii) O-2 binding to mammalian Hbs and Mbs occurs by migration of the ligand through a channel created by upward rotation of the His(E7) side chain, capture in the empty space of the distal pocket, and then coordination with the ferroprotoporphyrin IX (heme) iron atom. (iv) The assembly of Mbs and Hbs occurs by formation of molten globule intermediates, in which the N- and C-terminal helices have almost fully formed secondary structures, but the heme pockets are disordered and followed by high-affinity binding of heme. Critical Issues: These conclusions indicate that there are often compromises between O-2 transport function, holoprotein stability, and the efficiency of assembly. Future Directions: However, the biochemical mechanisms underlying these conclusions provide the framework for understanding globin evolution in greater detail and for engineering more efficient and stable globins.									12	0	0	0	8	0	12			1523-0864	1557-7716		WOS:000490954900001	31530172

By heat-treating the gel films, the membrane reactors, (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.95)MnO3\ScSZ\Pt and (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.95)MnO3/YSZ\SCSZ\Pt were fabricated. It was found that the prefiring temperature affected :the microstructure evolution of (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.95)MnO3 and (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.95)MnO3/YSZ thin films. Pre-firing at low temperature resulted in high porosity and large grain size of the thin films. NO decomposition characteristics of the obtained membrane reactors were investigated at 600 degreesC in reactant gas, 1000 ppm of NO and 2% of oxygen. By applying a direct current to the membrane reactors, NO can be decomposed at the (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.95)MnO3 and (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.95)MnO3/YSZ composite cathode. By incorporating YSZ into (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.95)MnO3, the required consuming power to decompose NO could be reduced. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	GASTONGUAY, L; VEILLEUX, G; COTE, R; SAINTJACQUES, RG; DODELET, JP								EVOLUTION OF THE PHOTOACTIVITY OF CHLOROALUMINUM PHTHALOCYANINE AND RELATED MATERIALS UPON HEAT-TREATMENT								CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS				5	3			381	390		10.1021/cm00027a024				MAR 1993	1993	Thin films and powders of chloroaluminum phthalocyanine (ClAlPc) have been heat treated at 300-degrees-C over various time periods (1-60 min). The same treatment has been applied to a highly photoactive ClAlPc, which is both structurally and chemically modified by anion uptake (Gastonguay, L.; et al. J. Electrochem. Soc. 1992,139, 337). The evolution of the photoactivity of the films (monitored photoelectrochemically) as well as their absorbance in the visible and near-infrared (NIR), their surface morphology, and their crystalline structure have been examined upon heating. Weight losses of the powders and their differential thermal calorimetry have also been measured. After heat treatments at 300-degrees-C for 60 min the following characteristics are obtained for all films: (i) a blue-shifted absorbance in the visible (the maximum of the Q band is at 630 nm); (ii) a low photoactivity of the resulting stable phase; (iii) the disappearance of the absorbance in the NIR for the structurally and chemically modified ClAlPc. This goes along with a drop of the photoactivity by at least one order of magnitude; (iv) a common film morphology (sharp-cornered parallelepipedic needles perpendicular to the substrate); (v) the same electron diffraction pattern for all films, characterized by four interplanar distances for d greater-than-or-equal-to 5 angstrom. The electron diffraction patterns may be interpreted either in terms of a slight modification of the triclinic lattice reported for ClAlPc single crystal or in terms of a cofacial stacking of the ClAlPc molecules. Heat treatments at 300-degrees-C of ClAlPc thin films also demonstrate that Pc layers sublimed at 2000 angstrom min-1 are amorphous or organized only at very short range, for more than 75% of the film. This characteristic is responsible for the easy diffusion of H+ in the disorganized phase, followed by its reaction with O2- and the uptake of anions which compensates for the loss of negative charges in highly photoactive structurally and chemically modified ClAlPc. The anions (Cl-, Br-, I3-, I-) taken up during the modification of ClAlPc are lost as hydrogen halides or I2 during the heat treatment. The maximum loss rate happens at temperatures between 130 and 150-degrees-C depending upon the anion involved.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0897-4756			WOS:A1993KT11800024		
J	Zhang Wenguang; Jiang Wenquan; Yu Limin; Fu Zhongzhen; Xia Wen; Guo Ronggui; Chen Feibiao; Li Tao								Ytterbium hydroxide and erbium hydroxide coating of spherical nickel hydroxide positive materials for Ni-MH batteries at high-temperature								JOURNAL OF RARE EARTHS				25		SI		400	405						DEC 2007	2007	For the purpose of the important high-temperature charge-discharge performances of spherical Ni(OH)(2) used as positive materials for Ni-MH batteries, Yb(OH)(3) and Er(OH)(3) were used for surface coating of spherical Ni(OH)(2) to improve its high-temperature properties. The coated spherical Ni (OH)(2) was prepared by chemically coprecipitation of Yb(OH)(3) and Er(OH)(3) on the surface of spherical Ni(OH)(2), respectively. The products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The X-ray analysis showed that the structure of the coated spherical Ni(OH)(2) was still beta-Ni(OH)(2). The SEM studies revealed that coating layer uniformly covered the surface of spherical Ni(OH)2. The electrochemical studies revealed that coating of Yb(OH)(3) and Er(OH)(3) exhibited superior performance such as high discharge capacity, excellent charge-discharge properties at high-discharge rate at 65 degrees C. The charge acceptance was above 85% at 1C rate at 65 degrees C. The discharge capacity approached to 230 mAh.g(-1) at 0.2C rate, which even reached 270 mAh.g(-1) at 1C rate for both Yb(OH)(3) and Er(OH)(3) coated spherical Ni(OH)(2), where the discharge capacity for uncoated one was only 250 mAh.g(-1). The cyclic voltammetry analysis of spherical Ni(OH)(2) showed that the oxidation potential, the oxygen evolution potential, and the difference between them increased after the coating both at 25 and 65 degrees C. It was shown that the Yb(OH)(3) and Er(OH)(3) coating is an effective way to improve the high-temperature performance of spherical Ni(OH)(2) for Ni-MH batteries. The studies showed that Yb(OH)(3) and Er(OH)(3) coated spherical Ni (OH)(2) would be a promising material of Ni-MH batteries for hybrid vehicle (HEVs), electric vehicles (EVs) and rapid charge devices due to excellent high rate charge-discharge performance.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1002-0721			WOS:000254839500091		
J	Gao, Yihao; Bai, Jie; Zhou, Tianning; Gong, Yaqiong					Gong, Yaqiong/0000-0002-4271-4525			Ir-Doped Co(OH)(2) nanosheets as an efficient electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction								DALTON TRANSACTIONS				51	22			8832	8839		10.1039/d2dt01366e		MAY 2022		JUN 7 2022	2022	In recent years, Co-based metal-organic frameworks (Co-MOFs) have received significant research interest because of their large specific surface area, high porosity, tunable structure and topological flexibility. However, their comparatively weak electrical conductivity and inferior stability drastically restrict the application of Co-MOFs in the synthesis of electrocatalysts. In this study, ZIF-67 was grown on nickel foam by a room temperature soaking method, and then Ir-Co(OH)(2)@ZIF-67/NF was assembled by a hydrothermal method. The prepared Ir-Co(OH)(2)@ZIF-67/NF nanosheets exhibit remarkable conductivity, larger electrochemical active surface area and wider electron transport channels. Only ultralow overpotentials of 198 mV, 263 mV, and 300 mV were needed for Ir-Co(OH)(2)@ZIF-67/NF to reach the current densities of 10 mA cm(-2), 50 mA cm(-2), 100 mA cm(-2), meanwhile, no obvious degradation of the current density at 10 mA cm(-2) was observed for about 16 h. This work may provide a promising strategy for developing high-performance MOF-derived materials as electrocatalysts for the OER under alkaline conditions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000800606800001	35621026	
J	Xie, Haochen; Basu, Saurabh; DeMeter, Edward C.								Coupling Monte Carlo Light Propagation Method and Curing Kinetic Equations to Model the Degree of Conversion Evolution of UV-Curable Composites								INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH				60	28			10431	10444		10.1021/acs.iecr.1c01585		JUL 2021		JUL 21 2021	2021	The degree of conversion (DoC) is significantly linked with many material properties of a UV-cured resin. Current curing kinetic models provide insight into how DoC evolves with depth for a pure resin cured by the collimated light beam. However, they do not accurately describe how DoC evolves within UV-curable composites or systems in which multidirectional ray propagation is in play. This paper describes a simulation framework for predicting the spatial and temporal evolution of DoC within a UV-curable composite. The framework uses the Monte Carlo method to predict light propagation and absorbed energy density at different reaction time steps. It also uses curing kinetic models and optical property models to predict DoC and optical properties within a volume. The framework was applied to simulate the photoinduced, free-radical polymerization of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate/phenylbis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl) phosphine oxide-based composites. It was used to study the influence of filler volume fraction and filler particle on the curing depth and curing width. The results show that larger filler volume fraction or smaller filler leads to smaller curing depth and width, which is in qualitative agreement with experimental results published in the research literature. The framework was also applied to simulate the formation of adhesive joints in a photoactivated adhesive workholding fixture application. The influence of a light source, a filler, and a workpiece surface on the final DoC distribution was investigated. The results show that (1) both the beam spread from a light-emitting diode (LED) light and the usage of a filler have large influences on the curing width of an adhesive joint. However, such influences will not be aggregated. (2) The light scattering by the fillers leads to a higher DoC in the secondary curing zone at shallow depth ranges, while the beam spread of the LED light beam results in a higher DoC in the secondary curing zone at deep depth ranges. (3) If the adhesive is not thick, then a highly reflective workpiece surface can promote the DoC at deep depth ranges. (4) Inside the primary curing zone, diffuse reflection caused by the workpiece surface greatly promotes the polymerization rate near the workpiece surface.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0888-5885			WOS:000677542700037

OEC33 was located at the thylakoid lumen of the etioplasts, without being tightly bound to the membranes. OEC33 and cyt b-559 were not crosslinked by 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimides and hexamethylene diisocyanate in the etioplasts, suggesting no complex formation between OEC33 and cyt b-559. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of chloroplasts in greening process employing Softes 12 (the mixture of sodium poly(oxyethylene) lauryl ether sulfate and lauryl dimethylamine oxide) and sodium dodecyl sulfate showed that PS II core complexes (D1,D2,cyt b-559,CP43,CP47) are formed by coordinated assembly of the constituent polypeptides and no intermediate complexes of PS II is formed in the developing chloroplasts. Measurement of photoreduction of 2,6-dichloroindophenol with the premature chloroplasts suggests that the preexisting OEC33 in the etioplasts binds efficiently to the newly assembled PS II cores. Fractionation assay of the thylakoids with digitonin implied that the stoichiometry of polypeptides in the PS II core complex is kept, at least in the appressed region, during the greening, but the PS II complexes without extrinsic proteins are present in the non-appressed region, especially at the early stage of chloroplast development. These results suggest that OEC33 binds preferentially to the PS II core complexes in the appressed thylakoids and stabilizes the juvenile PS II.									19	0	0	0	19	0	19			0006-3002			WOS:A1993MP93400021

Evolution of stoichiometrically dependent electron conductivity is obtained that is efficiently controlled by varying the ratio of the number of layers (MoOx to MoNx) in the nanolaminate structure. The carrier type, the free carrier concentration, and the mobility of the as-grown materials are studied by temperature-dependent Hall-effect measurement. The authors hypothesize that the addition of N-atom creates oxygen vacancies in the films that in turn act as a shallow donor level that results in improved conductivity in the ternary material. As-grown materials, both in the form of planar architecture and coaxially grown on multiwalled carbon nanotubes are investigated as a prospective anode material in the Li-ion battery. The comparison reveals a substantially improved performance of N-incorporated samples than that of the pristine materials. The highest discharge capacity of 1287 mA h g(-1) was achieved in the first cycle at a current rate of 0.1 A g(-1), and a stable capacity of 974 and 610 mA h g(-1) is achieved when discharged at 0.1 and 2 A g(-1), respectively, from the core-shell structures.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0734-2101	1520-8559		WOS:000517456900001

Copper has recently received much attention in this regard. Mechanistic parallels between Cu and single-site Ru/Ir/Mn water oxidation catalysts, including intermediacy of terminal Cu oxo/oxyl species, are prevalent in the literature; however, intermediacy of late transition metal oxo species would be remarkable given the high d-electron count would fill antibonding orbitals, making these species high in energy. This may suggest alternate pathways are at work in copper-based water oxidation. This report characterizes a dinuclear copper water oxidation catalyst, {[(L)Cu(II)]2-(mu-OH)(2)}(OTf)2 (L = Me2TMPA = bis((6-methyl-2-pyridyl)methyl)(2-pyridylmethyl)amine) in which water oxidation proceeds with high Faradaic efficiency (>90%) and moderate rates (33 s-1 at similar to 1 V overpotential, pH 12.5). A large kinetic isotope effect (kH/kD = 20) suggests proton coupled electron transfer in the initial oxidation as the rate-determining step. This species partially dissociates in aqueous solution at pH 12.5 to generate a mononuclear {[(L)Cu(II)(OH)]}+ adduct (Keq = 0.0041). Calculations that reproduce the experimental findings reveal that oxidation of either the mononuclear or dinuclear species results in a common dinuclear intermediate, {[LCu(III)](2)-(mu-O)2}2+, which avoids formation of terminal Cu(IV)-O/Cu(III)-O<bold> intermediates. Calculations further reveal that both intermolecular water nucleophilic attack and redox isomerization of {[LCu(III)]2-(</bold>mu-O)(2)}(2+) are energetically accessible pathways for O-O bond formation. The consequences of these findings are discussed in relation to differences in water oxidation pathways between Cu catalysts and catalysts based on Ru, Ir, and Mn.									81	2	0	0	8	0	81			0002-7863			WOS:000404809600034	28558469

The mass fraction of Mg in each sample is 80% to maintain high and consistent hydrogen storage capacity. An 18R-type long-period stacking ordered phase (LPSO) is observed within the Mg12Ce matrix in Mg-Ni-Ce alloys. A two-step activation process is observed in Ce containing alloys. Detailed microstructural characterization of activated samples during air exposure and in-depth analysis of absorption/desorption kinetics on air-exposed samples based on Johnson-MehlAvrami (JMA) model are performed to discuss the mechanism underlying improved anti-oxidation properties. CeH2.73 forms after activation and transforms to CeO2 during air exposure, which is earlier and faster than the MgO formation during initial air contact preventing forming a compact and uniform MgO layer on the surface. The formed CeH2.73/CeO2 particles with average particle size less than 60 nm act as catalysts accelerating the hydrogen dissociation and nucleation sites for the MgH2 formation during hydrogenation. After de -/hydrogenation cycles, CeO2 turns back to CeH2.73, which can react with oxygen again when the sample is exposed to air. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Homa, Joanna				Homa, Joanna/AAL-8327-2020				Earthworm coelomocyte extracellular traps: structural and functional similarities with neutrophil NETs								CELL AND TISSUE RESEARCH				371	3	SI		407	414		10.1007/s00441-018-2787-0				MAR 2018	2018	Invertebrate immunity is associated with natural mechanisms that include cellular and humoral elements, similar to those that play a role in vertebrate innate immune responses. Formation of extracellular traps (ETs) is a newly discovered mechanism to combat pathogens, operating not only in vertebrate leucocytes but also in invertebrate immune cells. The ET components include extracellular DNA (exDNA), antimicrobial proteins and histones. Formation of mammalian ETs depends on enzymes such as neutrophil elastase, myeloperoxidase, the citrullination of histones and protease activity. It was confirmed that coelomocytes-immunocompetent cells of the earthworm Eisenia andrei-are also able to release ETs in a protease-dependent manner, dependent or independent of the formation of reactive oxygen species and rearrangement of the cell cytoskeleton. Similar to vertebrate leukocytes (e.g., neutrophil), coelomocytes are responsible for many immune functions like phagocytosis, cytotoxicity and secretion of humoral factors. ETs formed by coelomocyte analogues to neutrophil ETs consist of exDNA, histone H3 and attached to these structures proteins, e.g., heat shock proteins HSP27. The latter fact confirms that mechanisms of ET release are conserved in evolution. The study on Annelida adds this animal group to the list of invertebrates capable of ET release, but most importantly provides insides into innate mechanisms of ET formation in lower animal taxa.									21	0	0	0	16	0	21			0302-766X	1432-0878		WOS:000425596800003	29404728

In this communication, we report the fabrication of a nanoporous crystalline CoB2O4 nanowire array on Ti mesh (CoB2O4/TM) from a Co(OH)F nanowire array on Ti mesh (Co(OH)F/TM) via an anion-exchange reaction. As a three dimensional (3D) catalyst electrode for water oxidation, CoB2O4/TM exhibits superior catalytic activity and needs an overpotential of only 446 mV to drive a geometrical catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M potassium borate (pH = 9.2). Notably, this catalyst also shows strong long-term electrochemical durability with high turnover frequency values of 0.19 and 0.81 mol O-2 per s at overpotentials of 400 and 500 mV, respectively.									18	1	0	0	0	0	18			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000409215300014	28829087

Photocatalytic activity under simulated solar irradiation of the aforementioned composites and their pure components is investigated for the degradation of amoxicillin (AMX) in the presence and absence of persulfate (PS). In both cases, TiO2@alpha-Fe2O3 sandwich-type achieve the highest degradation rates of AMX and a marked effect of PS addition on the AMX degradation rate is noted. The influence of pH and PS concentration on AMX degradation rate is established by means of experimental design and response surface modeling. The AMX degradation pathway is studied by means of reactive oxygen species scavenging and identification of intermediates by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Their evolution is directly correlated with an increased toxicity assessed by Daphnia magna and Vibrio fischeri assays. Furthermore, biodegradability changes are correlated with the mineralization profile of AMX solution. The influence of water matrix constituents (Cl-, CO32-, NO3-, PO43- and Suwannee river natural organic matter) on AMX degradation is established as well.									6	1	0	0	2	0	6			2366-7486			WOS:000672884700001		
J	Morse, S. A.								Experimental Equilibrium Tested by Plagioclase Loop Widths								JOURNAL OF PETROLOGY				54	9			1793	1813		10.1093/petrology/egt031				SEP 2013	2013	The plagioclase loop width is defined as An(S) - An(L) where S and L are solid and liquid, respectively, and An is the mole fraction (or per cent) An/(An + Ab). It is measured from the plagioclase composition and an estimate of the liquid composition based on standard assumptions rooted in the norm recalculation routine. A survey of a large, new database allows study of the 1 atm experimental literature involving 819 experiments. The approach to equilibrium is tested empirically by the loop width and its transform, the linear partitioning function K-D. This function is the exchange coefficient formed as the intercept at pure An(S) from the array over all X-S of the partition coefficient D when defined as (X-ab(S)/X-Ab(L))where X is the mole fraction. D and K-D are thus limited to lie between zero and 1 center dot 0. The results show a 1 atm loop width ranging from 0 center dot 2 to 68 mol % An with associated K-D = 0 center dot 03-0 center dot 98. These extrema represent loops both far too small and far too large to represent stable equilibrium between plagioclase and liquid. Some of the higher values lie near the persodic limit because the An component of the liquid is scarce, and the liquid composition is Ab-rich. The loops from Ne-normative liquids span the range from 40 to 90 mol % An in the crystal with loops 2-50 mol % wide. A baseline for loop width is derived from the precise synthetic study of the system Di-An-Ab at 1 atm and an array of high-pressure data that extrapolates to the same value of K-D = 0 center dot 26 at 1 atm. Many of the 1 atm experimental data fall far outside any reasonable uncertainty limits on the baseline. Causes of departure include crystal disequilibrium that can lead to errors in both directions, and compositional problems. Comparison of the values of K-D with liquid compositions in silica, oxygen fugacity, temperature, kinetics, and sodium reveals the common presence of sodium deficiency. A crystallinity study shows a definite decrease in sodium content with liquid evolution, whereas the sodium content should increase or at least remain nearly constant with evolution of the melt. A selection of self-consistent 1 atm data from a few laboratories shows a close correspondence to the standard distribution of loop widths and indeed most literature data lie within the limited range of K-D = 0 center dot 26-0 center dot 4. Experiments known to be hydrous show very low values of K-D and corresponding large loop widths, as previously understood from literature data. When data limited to near-baseline K-D values are plotted against temperature, they yield expected thermal slopes and concave-up curves of temperature plotted against plagioclase composition. Literature data show a positive correlation of K-D with dry pressure, and a separate database from 2 to 15 kbar shows that more than half the data comport with this pressure effect. A different group ranges down to K-D as low as 0 center dot 2, with increasing loop widths. Some of these are alkalic and hence rich in the Ab component of the liquid. Others were obtained in Fe containers that control the oxygen fugacity to low values and convert the fayalite component of the liquid to iron, oxygen, and silica. This reaction increases the activity of silica and in turn the activity of Ab in the melt, thus widening the loop. Thermodynamic studies concerned with plagioclase-melt equilibria will profit from an awareness of these effects.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0022-3530	1460-2415		WOS:000323619600003

Herein, we report a Fe(II) hydrolysis reaction assisted in-situ etching and growth method for the design of Fe2O3 nanoparticles-anchored ultrathin Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets composites on nickel foam (Fe2O3/Ni(OH)(2)/NF), followed by solvothermal sulfidation conversion into FeS/NiS/NF electrode. As-prepared FeS/NiS/NF electrode possesses low overpotentials of 203 mV and 144 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH for OER and HER, respectively. FeS/NiS/NF directly serves as both anode and cathode to assemble a two-electrode water electrolyzer, which only requires a voltage of 1.618 V to afford water-splitting current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. Additionally, this water splitting device can also be driven by using photovoltaic solar panels. This work provides a new strategy to tailor the components and structure of the catalyst and thus to improve electrocatalytic performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

On the second and later flashes, however, absorbance changes in Cl--depleted samples revealed only electron transfer from tyrosine to quinone which reversed slowly in the dark by charge recombination and did not produce the S-3-state. A rapid method was developed to remove Cl- after producing the S-3-state by two flashes. The lifetime of the S-3-state was found to be unaffected by Cl--depletion, in contrast to the 20-fold stabilization of the S-2 lifetime by Cl- removal, and the Cl--depleted S-3-state did not proceed to S-0 on flash illumination, However, when the same Cl--depletion procedure was applied after producing the S-0-state by three flashes, further advance to S-2 by two additional flashes was not impaired by the absence of Cl-. The requirement for Cl- only on the S-2-->S-3 and S-3-->S-0 transitions can be rationalized by the hypothesis that Cl- is required for electron transfer between manganese ions within the oxygen-evolving complex.									123	3	1	0	78	0	126			0006-2960			WOS:A1997WQ07600030	9132019

The alignment of PAN chains and GO in nanofibers was enhanced by hot stretching of the yarn in dry conditions. The microstructure of the composite nanofiber yarns was investigated through X-ray diffraction, polarized Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The results demonstrated that the hot stretching above T-g of PAN precursor lead to the increased orientation-induced crystallization and alignment of PAN chain and GO. The yarn with 0.1 wt% GO and stretched by 4 times its length obtained the highest strength and modules (310.88 +/- 24.68 MPa and 7.24 +/- 0.55 GPa), which were 600% and 500% higher than those of the as-electrospun pure PAN yarn. The most promising tensile properties found in hot stretched yarns with low GO content was because the strong interaction occurred between PAN molecules and oxygen-containing functional groups. Indirect evidence of GO aggregation was also presented, which adversely affected the mechanical properties at higher GO content. Composite nanofiber yarns were sewable and weavable, and could be used as a new generation of composite reinforcement after pyrolysis.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1042-7147	1099-1581		WOS:000523610500001

ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				471	2			L41	L45		10.1051/0004-6361:20077879				AUG 2007	2007	Context. The stellar production of the light element lithium is still a matter of debate.Aims. We report the detection of low-mass, Li-rich Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars located in the Galactic bulge.Methods. A homogeneous and well-selected sample of low mass, oxygen-rich AGB stars in the Galactic bulge has been searched for the absorption lines of Li. Using spectral synthesis techniques, we determine from high resolution UVES/VLT spectra the Li abundance in four out of 27 sample stars, and an upper limit for the remaining stars.Results. Two stars in our sample have a solar Li abundance or above; these stars seem to be a novelty, since they do not show any s-element enhancement. Two more stars have a Li abundance slightly below solar; these stars do show s-element enhancement in their spectra. Different scenarios which lead to an increased Li surface abundance in AGB stars are discussed.Conclusions. Of the different enrichment scenarios presented, Cool Bottom Processing ( CBP) is the most likely one for the Li-rich objects identified here. Self-enrichment by Hot Bottom Burning (HBB) seems very unlikely as all Li-rich stars are below the HBB mass limit. Also, the ingestion of a low mass companion into the stars' envelope is unlikely because the associated additional effects are lacking. Mass transfer from a former massive binary companion is a possible scenario, if the companion produced little s-process elements. A simple theoretical estimation for the Li abundance due to CBP is presented and compared to the observed values.									32	0	0	0	0	0	32			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000248545700006

In low and moderate light, the mutant grew slowly under photoautotrophic conditions, with a doubling time of similar to40 h, and had severely reduced photosynthetic oxygen evolution. When the mutant was maintained in low or moderate light in the presence of glucose, its growth rate was only somewhat lower than that of wild-type cells. However, the mutant was light sensitive and rapidly died in high light. Furthermore, levels of many transcripts encoding genes associated with photosynthesis were altered in the mutant relative to wild-type Synechoeystis sp. strain PCC6803 both in low light and following exposure to high light. There was constitutive expression of several high-light-inducible genes, including hli, psbAIII, and gpx2; there was little increased accumulation of sodB mRNA in high light; and the cells failed to accumulate cpcBA and psaAB mRNAs in low light in the presence of glucose, although a normal decline in the levels of these mRNAs was observed during exposure to high light. These results suggest that DspA is involved in controlling sets of photosynthetic and high-light-responsive genes, either directly or indirectly. These and other results, some of which are presented in a companion paper (C.-J. Tu, J. Shrager, R. Burnap, B. L. Postier, and A. R. Grossman, J. Bacteriol. 186:3889-3902, 2004), suggest that DspA acts as a global regulator that helps coordinate cellular metabolism with growth limitations imposed by environmental conditions.									58	0	1	0	55	0	61			0021-9193	1098-5530		WOS:000221869100025	15175302

Carbon-oxygen WDs accreting a helium shell have the potential to explode in the sub-Chandrasekhar mass regime. Previous studies have shown how the ignition of a helium shell can either directly ignite the WD at the core-shell interface or propagate a shock wave into the the core causing a central ignition. We examine the explosions of WDs from 0.6 to 1.2 M-circle dot with helium shells of 0.01, 0.05, and 0.08 M-circle dot. Distinct observational signatures of sub-Chandrasekhar mass WD explosions are predicted for two categories of shell size. Thicker-shell models show an early time flux excess, which is caused by the presence of radioactive material in the ashes of the helium shell, and red colors due to these ashes creating significant line blanketing in the UV through the blue portion of the spectrum. Thin shell models reproduce several typical Type Ia supernova signatures. We identify a relationship between Si II velocity and luminosity that, for the first time, identifies a subclass of observed supernovae that are consistent with these models. This subclass is further delineated by the absence of carbon in their atmospheres. We suggest that the proposed difference in the ratio of selective to total extinction between the high velocity and normal velocity Type Ia supernovae is not due to differences in the properties of the dust around these events, but is rather an artifact of applying a single extinction correction to two intrinsically different populations of supernovae.									85	0	0	0	0	0	85			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000460525200016

Zn-supplementation reduced the maximum cell density. A linear relationship was found between the evolution of gross photosynthesis and total chlorophyll content. The Zn treatment decreased the electron transport rate except in A. coffeaeformis and in E. paludosa at high irradiance. A linear relationship was found between the efficiency of light to evolve oxygen and the size of the light-harvesting antenna. The external carbonic anhydrase activity was stimulated in Zn-supplemented E. paludosa but was not correlated with an increase of photosynthesis. The total activity of the antioxidant enzymes did not display any clear increase except in ascorbate peroxidase activity in N. palea. The phytochelatin synthase gene was identified in the four diatoms, but its expression was only revealed in N. palea, without a clear difference between control and Zn-supplemented cells. Among the four species, A. paludosa was the most sensitive and A. coffeaeformis, the most tolerant. A. acutiuscula seemed to be under metal starvation, whereas, to survive, only N. palea developed several stress responses.									46	2	0	0	42	0	47			1537-744X			WOS:000306813300001	22645501

To increase lifetime, adsorbates on the surface of a plasmonic metal may create preferential states for electrons to be excited from. We demonstrate this effect with O adsorbates on a nanoporous gold electrode. Nanoporous gold is used to obtain a broadband optical response, to increase the obtained photocurrent, and to provide a SERS-active substrate. Only with adsorbates present, we observe significant photocurrents. Illumination also increases the adsorbate coverage above its dark potential-dependent equilibrium, as derived from a two-laser in situ SERS approach. Density functional theory calculations confirm the appearance of excitable states below the Fermi level. The photocurrent enhancement and broadband characteristics reveal the potential of the plasmonic approach to improve the efficiency of photoelectrochemical water splitting.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000623061800100	33496564

Integration of a suitable co-catalyst with an absorber material enables the realization of highly efficient photocleavage of water. Herein, nanostructured hematite film was coated with an ultrathin and conformal CoOx overlayer through atomic layer deposition (ALD). The best performing hybrid hematite with a 2-3 nm ALD CoOx overlayer yielded a remarkable turn on potential of 0.6 V-RHE for the water oxidation reaction. Moreover, material analyses revealed that the surface amorphous CoOx/Co(OH)(2) component exhibited good optical transparency and hydrophilic properties, which were beneficial for the formation of an ideal hematite/electrolyte interface. In addition to the presence of the CoOx overlayer, a negative shift of flat band potential (V-FB) as well as suppression of surface recombination helped to significantly promote the charge separation and collection properties, contributing to the overall solar conversion efficiency. As a result, the external quantum efficiency (IPCE) obtained on hematite increases by 66% at 1.23 V-RHE.									22	2	0	0	1	0	22			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000402488300083	28530305

Samples were commonly Pb-doped (part 0.4 of Bi substituted by Pb) during the first thermal cycle. Yet, the synthesizing efficiency of the (Bi,Pb)-2223 phase was found to be greatly re-enhanced during the second thermal cycle by a substantial addition of 10% excess of PbO in weight. PbO addition was shown to keep up a high reaction order value (n roughly equals 2.2) and thus to maintain the corresponding sought-after formation mechanism i.e., initial growth of particles nucleated at a constant rate, for sinter temperatures ranging from 820 to 845 degreesC and sintering time between 24 and 96 h. The substantial addition of PbO promotes likely the stability and the abundance of the transient liquid phase. Using the Avrami equation, an activation energy of 840 kJ/mol has been found for the corresponding formation mechanism over the sinter temperature range studied. The synthesized (Bi,Pb)-2223 matrix platelets were shown to involve nanosize (Bi,Pb)-2223 particles. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

SrTiO3 particles were obtained via a polymer precursor method, and heterojunctions in which CaO grew on SrTiO3 crystalline particles were prepared via a sol-gel route. Characterization was performed using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and ultraviolet/visible/near-infrared, Raman, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The photocatalytic activity of the heterostructures was verified by the discoloration of RhB using UV light. Defects caused by tensile strain in the interface region were verified when the calcium oxide grew on the strontium titanate, altering the defects of the material. In the heterojunctions, the defects of the monoionized and doubly ionized O (oxygen) vacancies had a greater contribution to the photocatalytic process than the defects at deep levels generated in the stress region and the direct transfer of charge between the conduction and valence bands.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000474322000093

While invertebrate genomes contain only one sestrin gene, mammalian and other vertebrate genomes comprise three highly homologous genes that encode Sestrin 1, 2 and 3 proteins (Sesn1, Sesn2 and Sesn3). Sestrins are activated in response to a variety of stimuli and trigger metabolic shifts promoting cell survival under stress conditions. Although cellular stress within an organism is often caused by external stimuli it can be induced by excess of cytokines, chemokines, reactive oxygen species which are produced during aberrant metabolic or immune processes and are involved in regulation of cell physiological states including cell death. Activation of sestrins facilitates cell adaptation to stress through stimulation of antioxidant response and autophagy through regulation of the signaling pathways mediated by AMPK and mTOR kinases. These activities are involved in protection of the organism during physical exercise and certain level of sestrins activity contributes to the development of age-related diseases. However, prolonged activation of sestrins under chronic stress may cause negative effects for the organism.									11	1	0	0	6	0	12			0026-8933	1608-3245		WOS:000454272100004

As a result, an RNA library that can bind to galactose with outstanding affinity has been obtained. Furthermore, the library was able to distinguish galactose from other monosaccharides, though they have closely similar structures. After another selection in order to obtain fast binders, a selected library tightly bound to galactose was obtained but it lost selectivity to galactose. This selectivity seemed to be derived from hydrogen bond geometry with the epimeric hydroxyl groups of monosaccharides. The results show an ability of RNAs to recognize any small molecule which consists of only carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.

THE TIME-EVOLUTION OF THE STOICHIOMETRY OF DISSOLUTION AS A FUNCTION OF PH AT 100-DEGREES-C, 200-DEGREES-C, AND 300-DEGREES-C								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				59	9			1669	1697		10.1016/0016-7037(95)00075-B				MAY 1995	1995	Albite feldspar was hydrolyzed over a wide-range of pH conditions at 100, 200, and 300 degrees C. The release rates of Na, Al, and Si were measured as a function of time from the initial, pre-steady-state phase to the attainment of steady-state, congruent dissolution conditions, Leached layers were developed during the initial stages of dissolution due to the preferential release of Na with respect to Al and Si at nearly all pH and temperature conditions. The preferential release of Na is due to the higher rate of ion exchange reactions vs. hydrolysis reactions associated with the release of Si and Al. The depths of Na preferential leaching show a pH dependence. Maximum depths on the order of 1500 and 1200 Angstrom were recorded at acid and basic pH conditions, respectively, whereas minimum depths were observed in the neutral pH range. Leached layers deficient in Al (with respect to Si) were recorded at acid and neutral pH conditions. At mildly basic pH conditions, Al and Si were congruently released, or alternatively, either Al or Si was preferentially released, At more extreme basic pH conditions, only Al was preferentially released, The depths of Al preferential leaching were not determinable under all conditions due to the precipitation of an Al surface phase; a maximum recorded depth of 250 Angstrom was determined at basic pH conditions. The preferential release behavior of Al and Si is ascribed to the pH dependency of the speciation of Al-OH and Si-OH groups at the surface and within the leached layers. However, at very basic pH conditions, where Al-O- and Si-O- groups are postulated to predominate, the preferential release of Al is probably due to the intrinsically greater reactivity of Al-bridging oxygen bonds.Calculations of diffusion coefficients for Na diffusion within the leached layers suggest that leached layers are structurally more open and porous than unaltered, crystalline albite. In addition, the calculated diffusion coefficients show a strong pH dependence. This result implies that leached layers formed at acid and basic pH conditions undergo a greater degree of structural modification since they are more open than those formed at neutral pH. The pH-dependent nature of the structural and transport properties of leached layers can be considered to be a contributing factor to the overall pH dependence of feldspar dissolution rates,The formation of leached layers is an important factor in providing hydrolyzing molecules (H+, H2O OH-) access to Na+ exchange sites and Si-O-Si and Al-O-Si hydrolysis sites deep within the structure, Evidence for this is shown by the positive relationship between the overall rates of dissolution and the depths of Na and Al leaching. The data from this study suggest that reactions at the surface and within leached layers control the overall dissolution behavior of feldspars and other similar, multi-oxide silicates. It is therefore proposed that a ''leached layer-surface reaction'' model more accurately describes the dissolution process at elevated temperatures than the traditionally accepted ''surface reaction'' model.									85	6	0	0	2	0	88			0016-7037	1872-9533		WOS:A1995RA71500002

However, it is technically unviable in the synthesis of alloyed transition metal compounds, which are emerging as important catalysts for water splitting, in a controllable manner using conventional wet chemical methods.

By tailoring the Co/Fe ratios and nanoporosity, the bimetallic phosphides exhibit versatile catalytic activities towards HER and OER in acidic and basic electrolytes. As both the cathode and the anode of an electrolyser, nanoporous (Co0.52Fe0.48)(2)P shows an outstanding performance in water electrolysis, comparable to the commercial electrolyser with paired Pt/C and IrO2 catalysts.									438	18	0	0	12	0	440			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000382749700007

The CoMnZn-containing hydroxides could play multifunctional roles as an efficient cocatalyst to lower the onset potential and enhance the photocurrent and as a protection layer for bismuth vandate. The hybrid photoanode shows a much improved PEC performance compared with bare bismuth vanadate, with a photocurrent density enhancement of 170% (from 0.61 mA cm(-2) to 1.06 mA cm(-2)) and a decrease of 280 mV in onset potential. Surface modification of photoanodes with trimetallic hydroxides not only provides more active sites but also greatly improves the migration of holes from bismuth vanadate to LDH. This facilitates the fast separation and transport of holes, thus retarded the recombination of photogenerated charges. In addition, the synergistic effect of transition metals in LDH plays an important role in the enhancement of PEC water oxidation of the hybrid photoanodes. New water oxidation catalyst introduced in this work hold a great promise to be extended to other photoanodes for advanced performance in the fields of energy conversion. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, S doped Ta2O5 decorated CdS nanosphere (S-Ta2O5/CdS) is synthesized through the interfacial diffusion reaction between sublimation of cadmium sulfide and crystallization shrinkage of tantalum oxide, which was regulated by high-temperature calcination. The successful S doping causes the changes of energy band structure of Ta2O5, which can be used as co-catalyst with suitable hydrogen potential to enhance the photocatalytic activity of CdS nanosphere. The obtained S-Ta2O5/CdS possesses the photocatalytic hydrogen generation rate of 54.51 mu mol center dot mg(-1)center dot h(-1) with improved photocatalytic stability under visible light irradiation, which is better than those of CdS (1.51 mu mol center dot mg(-1)center dot h(-1)) and Ta2O5 (0 mu mol center dot mg(-1)center dot h(-1)). The work offers a new perspective that STa2O5 as co-catalyst improves the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole for the visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000836160000002

The electrochemical synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and water is a green process with great application prospects; to this end, much effort has been made to improve the catalytic activity and selectivity. Here, a Co-based metal-organic framework (MOF), that is, zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67), supported on a Ti3C2 MXene (defined as ZIF-67@Ti3C2) was prepared via in situ growth. Due to the high porosity and large active surface area of the MOF and the superior conductivity of the Ti3C2 MXene, the composite could efficiently synthesize ammonia electrochemically. In particular, the prepared ZIF-67@Ti3C2 catalyst exhibited an excellent NH3 yield (6.52 mu mol h(-1) cm(-2)), significantly higher than those achieved by Ti3C2 and ZIF-67 (2.77 and 1.61 mu mol h(-1) cm(-2), respectively) alone, and good Faraday efficiency (20.2%) at -0.4 V (vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode). This study not only expands the application of the MXene family in the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction but also provides ideas for the development of high-performance electrocatalysts for NRR.									22	1	0	0	1	0	22			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000617768200009	33522552

In this Account, we first review how thermodynamic properties such as redox potentials (E degrees), acidity constants (pK(a)), and hydride donor abilities (Delta G(H)(-)) form the basis for a framework for the systematic design of molecular catalysts for reactions that are critical for a secure energy future. We illustrate this for hydrogen evolution and oxidation, oxygen reduction, and CO conversion, and we give references to other instances where it has been successfully applied. The framework is amenable to quantum-chemical calculations and conducive to predictions by computer. We review how density functional theory allows the determination and prediction of these thermodynamic properties within an accuracy relevant to experimentalists (similar to 0.06 eV for redox potentials, similar to 1 pK(a) unit for pK(a) values, and 1-2 kcal/mol for hydricities). Computation yielded correlations among thermodynamic properties as they reflect the electron population in the d shell of the metal center, thus substantiating empirical correlations used by experimentalists. These correlations point to the key role of redox potentials and other properties (pK(a) of the parent aminium for the proton-relay-based catalysts designed in our laboratory) that are easily accessible experimentally or computationally in reducing the parameter space for design. These properties suffice to fully determine free energies maps and profiles associated with catalytic cycles, i.e., the relative energies of intermediates. Their prediction puts us in a position to distinguish a priori between desirable and undesirable pathways and mechanisms. Efficient catalysts have flat free energy profiles that avoid high activation barriers due to low- and high-energy intermediates. The criterion of a flat energy profile can be mathematically resolved in a functional in the reduced parameter space that can be efficaciously calculated by means of the correlation expressions. Optimization of the functional permits the prediction by computer of design points for optimum catalysts. Specifically, the optimization yields the values of the thermodynamic properties for efficient (high rate and low overpotential) catalysts. We are on the verge of design of molecular electrocatalysts by computer. Future efforts must focus on identifying actual ligands that possess these properties. We believe that this can also be achieved through computation, using Taft-like relationships linking molecular composition and structure with electron-donating ability and steric effects. We note also that the approach adopted here of using free energy maps to decipher catalytic pathways and mechanisms does not account for kinetic barriers associated with elementary steps along the catalytic pathway, which may make thermodynamically accessible intermediates kinetically inaccessible. Such an extension of the approach will require further computations that, however, can take advantage of Polanyi-like linear free energy relationships linking activation barriers and reaction free energies.									60	1	0	0	3	0	60			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000349806300012	25574854

Feynerol, Vincent/0000-0003-0837-2565			Reactivity of suspended iron oxide particles in low temperature alkaline electrolysis								JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY				47	12			1339	1350		10.1007/s10800-017-1127-5				DEC 2017	2017	Electrolysis of iron ore is a promising CO2-free iron production route based on the electrolytic reduction of solid iron oxide particles suspended in 110 degrees C concentrated alkaline electrolyte. The reactivities of different iron compounds during their reduction into iron through this process have been compared using a model laboratory cell. Chronoamperometry experiments were performed on suspensions containing hematite (alpha-Fe2O3), magnetite (Fe3O4) or goethite (alpha-FeOOH) at a cell voltage of 1.66 V. Current density response, anode and cathode electrochemical potentials, faradaic efficiency and iron deposit morphology were compared. Hematite reduces to iron at 1100 A/m(2) with current yield near 85%. For goethite, the current density response was 33% lower and current efficiency dropped by 20% compared to hematite. Magnetite reactivity proved to be extremely low with eight-time lower current density and tenfold lower current efficiency than hematite. The weaker reactivity of goethite and magnetite particles could be ascribed to their more difficult adsorption on the cathode surface partly covered with metal iron, the far higher viscosity of goethite suspensions, although at the same solid concentrations as the other oxide particles and the occurrence of opposite electrode reactions with dissolved Fe(OH)(3)(-) and Fe(OH)(4)(-) ions.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000415218500006

However, the development of heterogeneous catalysts with both high catalytic performance and low cost for this hydrolytic reaction is still a great challenge. In this work, we have developed a novel catalyst for the hydrolysis of ammonia borane, viz. a Ti-supported nanostructured MnCo2O4 film composed of nanoplates with a thickness of 10-20 nm, which is then characterized using an X-ray powder diffractometer, field emission scanning electron microscope, elemental mapping and X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. In the hydrolysis of ammonia borane catalyzed by the as-prepared nanostructured MnCo2O4 film, the turnover frequency can reach 24.3 mol(hydrogen) min(-1) mol(cat)(-1), which is much higher than those of most noble-metal-free catalysts reported in the literature. More importantly, the film catalyst can retain 96% of its original activity after 7 cycles, demonstrating its high stability and good reusability. Considering its high activity, good reusability and low cost, the nanostructured MnCo2O4 film can be a promising catalyst towards the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane for hydrogen production.									18	2	0	0	0	0	18			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000407636600018

In this model system, an electron is transferred to ruthenium from tyrosine, which is concurrently deprotonated. This investigation is motivated by experimental measurements of the dependence of the rates on pH and temperature (Sjodin et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000, 122, 3932). The mechanism is proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) at pH < 10 when the tyrosine is initially protonated and is single electron transfer (ET) for pH > 10 when the tyrosine is initially deprotonated. The PCET rate increases monotonically with pH, whereas the single ET rate is independent of pH and is 2 orders of magnitude faster than the PCET rate. The calculations reproduce these experimentally observed trends. The pH dependence for the PCET reaction arises from the decrease in the reaction free energies with pH. The calculations indicate that the larger rate for single ET arises from a combination of factors, including the smaller solvent reorganization energy for ET and the averaging of the coupling for PCET over the reactant and product hydrogen vibrational wave functions (i.e., a vibrational overlap factor in the PCET rate expression). The temperature dependence of the rates, the solvent reorganization energies, and the deuterium kinetic isotope effects determined from the calculations are also consistent with the experimental results.									91	0	0	0	15	0	95			0002-7863			WOS:000184919600051	12926968

Research, development and demonstration of oxy-fuel combustion technologies has been advancing in recent years; however, there are still fundamental issues and technological challenges that must be addressed before this technology can reach its full potential, especially in the areas of combustion in oxygen-carbon dioxide environments and potentially at elevated pressures. This paper presents a technical review of oxy-coal combustion covering the most recent experimental and simulation studies, and numerical models for sub-processes are also used to examine the differences between combustion in an oxidizing stream diluted by nitrogen and carbon dioxide. The evolution of this technology from its original inception for high temperature processes to its current form for carbon capture is introduced, followed by a discussion of various oxy-fuel systems proposed for carbon capture. Of all these oxy-fuel systems, recent research has primarily focused on atmospheric air-like oxy-fuel combustion in a CO2-rich environment Distinct heat and mass transfer, as well as reaction kinetics, have been reported in this environment because of the difference between the physical and chemical properties of CO2 and N-2, which in turn changes the flame characteristics. By tracing the physical and chemical processes that coal particles experience during combustion, the characteristics of oxy-fuel combustion are reviewed in the context of heat and mass transfer, fuel delivery and injection, coal particle heating and moisture evaporation, devolatilization and ignition, char oxidation and gasification, as well as pollutants formation. Operation under elevated pressures has also been proposed for oxy-coal combustion systems in order to improve the overall energy efficiency. The potential impact of elevated pressures on oxy-fuel combustion is discussed when applicable. Narrower flammable regimes and lower laminar burning velocity under oxy-fuel combustion conditions may lead to new stability challenges in operating oxy-coal burners. Recent research on stabilization of oxy-fuel combustion is reviewed, and some guiding principles for retrofit are summarized. Distinct characteristics in oxy-coal combustion necessitate modifications of CFD sub-models because the approximations and assumptions for air-fuel combustion may no longer be valid. Advances in sub-models for turbulent flow, heat transfer and reactions in oxy-coal combustion simulations, and the results obtained using CFD are reviewed. Based on the review, research needs in this combustion technology are suggested. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									695	58	1	0	18	0	747			0360-1285	1873-216X		WOS:000300268100003

XRD patterns revealed the formation of ZnO/CuO NCs with a crystalline quality and intra-granular coupling, and HRTEM images showed the globular morphology indicating a porous nature. The lower PL intensity of ZnO/CuO NCs specified the slower recombination rate of electrons and holes for enhanced photocatalytic and antibacterial activity. The maximum photocatalytic degradation efficiency of methylene blue dye was 99% with ZnO/CuO NCs after 60 min under ultraviolet A (UV-A) light, which is much higher than the as-prepared (bare) NCs (75% for ZnO and 36% for CuO). For methylene orange (MO), the photocatalysis with ZnO/CuO NCs resulted in 83% removal efficiency in comparison to the bare ZnO and CuO (31% and 52%), respectively. The dye degradation with ZnO/CuO NCs followed pseudo-first-order kinetics and also exhibited excellent recycling stability even after five cycles. The antibacterial studies shows that gram-negative bacteria are efficiently killed by the NCs due to the surface interaction of the NCs and evolution of reactive oxygen species over the cell wall membranes. The photocatalytic active species correlated with the photodegradation mechanism of ZnO/CuO NCs and reactive oxygen species-based antibacterial activity. This study suggests that biogenic NCs can be used as a promising alternative photocatalyst for dye degradation in wastewater and also as a sustainable antibacterial agent.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000660823400007

These plastics are stored in a plant producing biogas (methane) in which agricultural sewage, a mixture of cattle and pig slurry, is degraded under anaerobic conditions by means of a mixed population of hydrolytic, acetogene and methanogene bacteria. The polymer specimens are mechanically pretreated by a grinding process and modified by various plasma treatments using oxygen and nitrogen as plasma gases and plasma polymerization of acrylic acid. After storing the pretreated specimens in the biogas plant for several weeks the samples were observed by scanning electron microscopy. A quantitative evaluation of the biomass coverings is enabled by the Bradford test. The detection of proteins as a result of this test showed a higher covering of biomass on the pretreated surfaces, either mechanically or plasma treated. But the most obvious increase in biomass covering was obtained on samples of polypropylene with a plasma-polymerized acrylic acid layer. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S.A.

The 3D GNCNTs hybrid aerogels, in which the NCNTs are dispersed homogeneously in the graphene sheets, are designed to efficiently support Pt nanoparticles. Comparing with 3D graphene (GA), the 3D GNCNTs supported Ptbased catalyst possesses improved electrocatalysis activity and stability toward methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). The mass activity of Pt/GNCNTs1/2 catalyst is 0.74 A mg(-1) Pt, which is 1.4 times that of the Pt/GA catalyst (0.54 A mg(-1) Pt). In addition, the retention rate after 1000 cycles for Pt/GNCNTs1/2 catalyst is as high as 82.4%, obviously superior to 68.5% of Pt/GA catalyst. The enhanced electrochemical performance is ascribed to the synergistic effect of GA and NCNTs. The introduction of NCNTs can uniformly disperse and strongly anchor Pt nanoparticles due to the increase in nitrogen active sites. Moreover, the NCNTs introduced into GA may prevent the restacking of graphene sheets, and provide a large accessible surface area for better dispersing Pt nanoparticles and transporting reactants and products.

The purpose of Mo-doping was to improve the electron transport properties, which in turn can increase the electron-hole separation yield. The poor electron-hole separation yield was known to be one of the main limiting factors for BiVO4-based photoanodes. The electrochemical route provided an effective way of doping BiVO4, and the optimally doped sample, BiV0.97Mo0.03O4, increased the electron-hole separation yield from 0.23 to 0.57 at 0.6 V vs. RHE, which is a record high separation yield achieved for BiVO4-based photoanodes. As a result, BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 generated impressive photocurrents, for example, 2 mA cm(-2) at a potential as low as 0.4 V vs. RHE for sulfite oxidation, which has fast oxidation kinetics and, therefore, the loss of holes by surface recombination is negligible. For photooxidation of water, BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 was paired with FeOOH as an oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) to improve the poor catalytic ability of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 for water oxidation. The resulting BiV0.97Mo0.03O4/FeOOH photoanodes generated a significantly improved photocurrent for water oxidation compared to previous reported results, but the photocurrent of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4/FeOOH for water oxidation could not reach the photocurrent of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 for sulfite oxidation. In order to examine the cause, the effects of Mo-doping on the interaction between BiVO4 and FeOOH and the effects of FeOOH on the electron-hole separation yield of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 were investigated in detail, which provided new insights into semiconductor-OEC interactions.									97	1	0	0	8	0	97			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000328643900047	24296682

Compared to the same material prepared by the solid-state reaction method, the rhombic nanotubes of SrNb2O6 exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity for the production of H-2 from pure water, which was mainly attributed to their higher surface area. Moreover, the increased optical absorption properties resulting from the variation of the crystal structure also contributed to their higher photocatalytic activity.									28	1	0	0	1	0	29			0959-9428			WOS:000277318100028

Extensive characterization showed that surface modification could bring about phase change and metal layer generation with a thickness of several nanometers. Excellent electron conductivity and the favorable morphology with coexisting Fe, Ni, and Cr species in NESS make an effective electron transfer between catalysts and PMS. The as-prepared NESS itself can induce the PMS activation, and oxygen vacancies can strengthen chemical bonding with PMS, providing active sites to activate PMS. As a result, NESS possessed a superior activity in PMS activation for mineralization of organic compounds. Electron paramagnetic resonance and quenching experiments demonstrated SO4 center dot-, HO center dot, O-2(center dot-) and O-1(2) were the dominant reactive species. Considering the procedure simplicity, NESS is an effective and low-cost catalyst for environmental applications.									14	1	0	0	9	0	15			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000564572800005

These excellent catalytic properties make FeSACs a promising candidate for construction of high-performance nanozymes, providing ample opportunities for developing biocatalytic medicine. It is of significant importance to systematically investigate the structure-controlled synthesis, property evaluation and mass-production of Fe-SACs with high loading. The emerging experimental and theoretical progress offers robust evidence to identify structure-activity relationship, thus shedding light on catalytic mechanisms toward specific catalytic reactions. In this review, we first summarize recent progress in synthesis methods and characterization of Fe-SACs, placing an emphasis on clarifying coordination environments of isolated Fe atoms anchored on supports. Then, we highlight the unique contribution of support materials on controlling active sites, optimizing catalytic activity, selectivity and chemical stability of Fe-SACs. To appreciate the latest innovation in nanotechnology, applications of Fe-SACs for biosensing and disease treatments are also discussed.

Herein, by means of density functional theory (DFT) computations, we systematically explored the potential of defective MoS2 monolayers with sulfur vacancies, including mono-sulfur (V-S), di-sulfur (V-S2 and V-2S), and tri-sulfur (V-3S), as COER electrocatalysts. Our results revealed that these defective MoS2-based candidates exhibit low formation energies and high stability, holding great promise for experimental synthesis and practical applications. In particular, according to the computed free energy changes, we found that the catalytic activity of these considered defective MoS2 monolayers for COER is highly dependent on the size of sulfur vacancies in MoS2 monolayers, among which V-3S exhibits the best COER catalytic performance, and CH4 is identified as the main product. Interestingly, the difference between the adsorption strength of *CH2 and *CH3 species can be used as a rational descriptor to evaluate the COER catalytic activity of these defective MoS2 monolayers. Thus, controlling the size of S-vacancies can make MoS2 monolayers a promising electrocatalyst for COER, which not only further widens the potential of MoS2 monolayers in electrocatalysis, but also opens a new door for CO reduction for renewable energy supply.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2398-4902			WOS:000691880600001

Here, molecular Ni4O4 cubane was prepared and combined with a BiVO4 nanoplate photoanode to generate a water oxidation cocatalyst. Intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy tests verify that the Ni4O4 cubane catalyst not only facilitates the kinetics of water oxidation, but also suppresses the recombination of carriers at the electrolyte/photoanode interface. As expected, the BiVO4 nanoplates modified with Ni4O4 cubane show superior activity (3.9 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE), with a more than twice increased activity compared to the BiVO4 nanoplates. Meanwhile, the onset potential also generates a 350 mV cathodic shift. In order to prevent desorption of the molecular catalyst due to the weak binding between the semiconductor and molecular catalyst, an Al2O3 adsorbed layer is constructed on the surface of the nanoplates. Consequently, Ni4O4/Al2O3/BiVO4 shows a significant improvement in PEC stability.									35	3	0	0	1	0	35			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000454251000020

However, the Pt particles on the Ti current collector cannot take part in the electrochemical reactions and thus lead to a lower utilization of the noble metal. In this work, the Pt-coated Ti current collector is directly used as the cathode in the PEM water electrolyser instead of the conventional Pt/C electrode. To improve the performance, Nafion ionomer is coated on the Pt/Ti electrode to enlarge the electrochemical surface area (ECSA); the ECSA of the Pt/Ti electrode is increased by six times, and the utilization of Pt can be elevated to 45%. The voltage of the electrolyser with the Pt/Ti electrode is only 31mV higher than the conventional Pt/C catalyst layer at 1 A cm(-2). After stability tests, an obvious membrane thinning is observed using Pt/C as the cathode while the membrane of the electrolyser with the ionomer-coated Pt/Ti cathode does not show a significant change in thickness. The F ion emission rate shows the membrane degradation rate is reduced by 15 times compared with the conventional Pt/C cathode.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000471344300014

It showed greatly enhanced photocatalytic activity compared with a monomorphological ZnO nanoplate structure in the degradation of methyl orange (MO). The higher content of surface oxygen defects, which can capture the photogenerated electrons and holes separately and make them available for decomposing organic contaminants, is considered to play an important role in the degradation of MO and makes a major contribution to the enhanced photocatalysis. Increasing the surface-to-volume (S/V) ratio without limit cannot benefit the photocatalytic activity significantly if there are not enough defects to separate additional photogenerated charges caused by a larger S/V ratio. A detailed photocatalytic mechanism related to surface defects of the hierarchical architecture was clearly demonstrated. The present study provides a new paradigm for further understanding the photocatalytic mechanism and suggests a new direction to design high-efficiency photocatalysts based on increasing the number of surface defects of nanostructures.									141	2	0	0	6	0	142			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000297585500020

In addition to water vapor and oxygen, the latest research points out that degradation is directly related to light absorption. Based on the selection rules of nonlinear optics, two-photon absorption is dipole forbidden in the exciton 1s states, but second-harmonic generation (SHG) is allowed with virtual transitions. According to this mechanism, we proved that SHG is an optical detection method with non-photooxidative damage and energy characteristics. With this detection method, we can explore the oxidation and degradation mechanisms of WS2 grown by NaCl-assisted chemical vapor deposition in its original state. The WS2 monolayers that use NaCl to assist in growth have undergone different degradation processes, starting to oxidize from random positions in the triangular flake. We use a photocatalytic reaction to explain the photo-induced degradation mechanism with sulfur vacancies. It was further found that WS2 grown with NaCl assistance is hydrolyzed in a dark and high-humidity environment, which does not occur in pure WS2. Finally, we demonstrated that changing the direction of the sapphire substrate relative to the gas flow direction to grow NaCl-assisted WS2 can greatly improve its stability in the ambient atmosphere, even when exposed to light. The optimal geometric structures and ground state energies are investigated by the density functional theory-based calculations. According to the orientation and symmetry of NaCl-assisted WS2, we can expect that it will have a better growth quality when the gas flow direction is perpendicular to the [1120] direction of the sapphire substrate. This contributes to the nucleation and subsequent growth of NaCl-assisted WS2. This research provides a more stable optical inspection method than other established methods and greatly improves the operational stability of NaCl-assisted WS2 under environmental conditions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000700921200001	34586136

Herein, utilizing nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) as spacers of nitrogen-doped graphene-like carbon nanosheets (NGs), a 3D nanoarchitecture (Co@NCNT-NG-900) is fabricated via a facile and eco-friendly approach. Physical characterizations manifest that the in situ-formed NCNTs make for improving graphitic degree, NGs contribute to increasing the specific surface area and the level of N-doping, meanwhile, the spacers effects of NCNTs promote the formation of opened macropores, what's more, Co@NCNT-NG-900 mainly consists of three-dimensional macropores and oversized mesoporous (3D macro-/oversized mesoporous), unlike conventional NPCs. Benefiting from improved charge transfer rate, enhanced N-doping level and dominant 3D macro-/oversized mesoporous, Co@NCNT-NG-900 is evaluated as an ideal Pt support for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in acid and alkaline medium. This work provides a facile synthetic method for NPCs and sheds directive light into the research of efficient catalysts for MOR. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The undoped TiO2, sub-stoichiometric TiO2 (TiO2-x) and codoped TiO2 (TiO2:WN) photoanodes were prepared by means of a radio frequency magnetron sputtering (RF-MS) deposition process. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) analysis shows that the N and W atoms were incorporated into the O and Ti lattice sites of TiO2 respectively (case of TiO2:WN film), while the XPS measurements of the TiO2-x films composition was determined to be TiO1.9. The UV-Vis transmittance spectra shows that in the case of the TiO2:WN films, the presence of nitrogen and tungsten improve the optical response of TiO2 under visible range compare to the presence of oxygen vacancies in to the TiO2-x films. The experimental results under solar light with an initial concentration of ATZ (100 mu g L-1) show that after 180min of treatment, the degradation of ATZ were 34.98%, 68.57% and 94.33% using TiO2, TiO2-x and TiO2:WN photoanodes, respectively. These results of ATZ degradation proved that TiO2:WN photoanode was more photoactive under solar light. The evolution by-products of ATZ under sunlight show that the principal mechanism of ATZ degradation was the oxidation of alkyl side chain and dealkylation.[GRAPHICS].					2nd Workshop on Electrochemical Engineering - New Bridges for a New Knowledge on Electrochemical Engineering / 10th World Congress of Chemical Engineering (WCCE)2nd Workshop on Electrochemical Engineering - New Bridges for a New Knowledge on Electrochemical Engineering / 10th World Congress of Chemical Engineering (WCCE)	OCT 01-05, 2017OCT 01-05, 2017		Barcelona, SPAINBarcelona, SPAIN	4	0	0	0	2	0	4			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000452362900006		
J	Wan, Yuchi; Xu, Jichu; Lv, Ruitao								Heterogeneous electrocatalysts design for nitrogen reduction reaction under ambient conditions								MATERIALS TODAY				27				69	90		10.1016/j.mattod.2019.03.002				JUL-AUG 2019	2019	Ammonia, as an important carbon-free energy carrier and also an important chemical for producing fertilisers, is mainly synthesized by a traditional Haber-Bosch process with high energy consumption and large amounts of greenhouse gas emissions. Recently, electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) has attracted worldwide research attentions as a promising route for achieving green and sustainable ammonia synthesis at ambient conditions. Although exciting advances have been made in the NRR field, the development of electrochemical nitrogen-to-ammonia conversion is still challenging because of the low ammonia yield and unsatisfactory Faradaic efficiency mainly deriving from the poor catalytic activity of catalysts. Herein, various catalyst design strategies for increasing the exposed active sites or altering the electronic structure aiming at improving the apparent activity or intrinsic activity are summarized in this review article. On the basis of effective design strategies, a range of recently reported NRR electrocatalysts, including noble metal-based materials, non-noble metal-based materials, single-metal-atom catalysts, and metal-free materials, are summarized, and the mechanisms of tuning the catalytic activity by applying the design strategies are emphasized based on the combination of theoretical calculations and experimental investigations. It is anticipated that the established correlation between physicochemical properties of catalysts and NRR performance can provide guidance for designing heterogeneous NRR electrocatalysts with high activity, good selectivity, and high stability.									162	13	0	0	11	0	166			1369-7021	1873-4103		WOS:000476972300016		
J	Andreeva, O. V.								Catagenesis of terrigenous rocks in the neoproterozoic intracratonic sedimentary basins and its effect on the formation of unconformity-type uranium mineralization								GEOLOGY OF ORE DEPOSITS				54	1			41	59		10.1134/S1075701512010035				FEB 2012	2012	Mineral transformation of host rocks and localization of orebodies at the unconformity-type uranium deposits are considered for the Karku deposit in the northern Ladoga region. It is shown that the great depth of uranium mineral formation and the peculiar composition of host rocks, along with temperature and chemistry of fluids, played a critical role in variation of lithostatic and fluid pressure, porosity, and permeability. The compaction of quartz sandstone and gravelstone, which are typical host rocks at unconformity-type deposits, the development of microstylolithic sutures, conformal structures, pressure solution and deposition of quartz in free pores gave rise to the closure or constraint of pore space and to increase in pore pressure of fluids in the deep part of the Riphean troughs with approaching lithostatic loading. A transitional zone between hydrostatic and lithostatic pressure controlled localization of orebodies and was decisive for uranium mineral formation. This zone coincided with the Riphean-Paleoproterozoic unconformity and sank somewhat into the crystalline basement. Below this transitional zone, the intergranular fluid was under a pressure that was close to the pressure on solid phases, i.e., P (tot) a parts per thousand P (fl). The reliability of this phenomenon is confirmed by cessation of pressure solution-redeposition of quartz and distinct deceleration of dehydration of hydrous minerals. As is shown for the Karku deposit, the highly hydrated clay minerals of the illite-smectite series are widespread in its subore portion and lacking at the supraore levels along with termination of quartz regeneration. It is suggested that a zone of superhigh fluid pressure in deep parts of sedimentary basins constrains localization of uranium orebodies by structural and stratigraphic unconformity between Riphean and Paleoproterozoic rocks. It is stated that altered wall rocks at the unconformity-type uranium deposits cannot be identified with products of hydrothermal phyllic and argillic alteration of host rocks at the medium- and low-temperature endogenic deposits. The main distinctions consist in lack of wall-rock metasomatic reaction zoning and acid-alkaline evolution of solutions. All transformations of host rocks should be classified as diverse manifestations of deep catagenesis of sedimentary sequences and buried regolith. The carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions of calcite from host rocks at the Karku deposit are far from those of magmatic and hydrothermal carbonates. They are characterized by a high delta O-18 = +17 to +25aEuro degrees and a high dispersion of delta C-13 = -1.5 to almost -15aEuro degrees. No granitoid magmatism is known in the regions, where the unconformity-type uranium deposits occur. Therefore, the rocks of the crystalline basement are the most probable source of uranium, which precipitated on the reductive barrier as a product of interaction with bitumen contained in the Riphean basal beds.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1075-7015	1555-6476		WOS:000300775300003

The electrochemical properties were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Comparative studies were performed with LaNiO3-pelleted electrodes. The roughness factors were determined by CV and found to be 5,208 +/- A 350 and 4,037 +/- A 250 for the pelleted and coated electrodes, respectively. EIS measurements confirm the results obtained by CV. Values lower than 0.3 were calculated for the morphology factors for both electrodes, indicating low electrochemical porosity. The experimental method used in this work to synthesise the oxide coupled with the use of Ni foam as support has proved to be very effective in producing oxide electrodes with surface areas higher than those referred to in relevant literature.									30	1	0	0	1	0	31			0021-891X			WOS:000302410900006

Surface pre-treatment of the fiber-based Ti-substrate with oxalic acid provides an alternative to plasma treatment for partially stripping TiO2 from the electrode surface and roughening the topography. Electrochemical catalyst deposition performed directly onto the pretreated Ti-substrates bypasses unnecessary preparation and processing of catalyst support structures. A single Pt constant potential deposition (CPD), directly followed by pulsed electrodeposition (PED), created nanosized noble agglomerates. Subsequently, Ir was deposited via PED onto the Pt sub-structure to obtain a successively deposited PtIr catalyst layer. For the co-deposition of PtIr, a binary PtIr-alloy electrolyte was used applying PED. Micrographically, areal micro- and nano-scaled Pt sub-structure were observed, supplemented by homogenously distributed, nanosized Ir agglomerates for the successive PtIr deposition. In contrast, the PtIr co-deposition led to spherical, nanosized PtIr agglomerates. The electrochemical ORR and OER activity showed increased hydrogen desorption peaks for the Pt-deposited substrate, as well as broadening and flattening of the hydrogen desorption peaks for PtIr deposited substrates. The anodic kinetic parameters for the prepared electrodes were found to be higher than those of a polished Ir-disc.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2079-4991		WOS:000781524400001	35407351

This study found that overloaded plasma-treatment energy induced an increase in the contact resistance (R-c) of patterned wafers. A possible explanation is that overloaded plasma power loosened the density of TiN films, resulting in more external oxygen diffusing into the film to form a high-resistance oxidation layer. An offline plasma-treatment index calculated by dividing the reciprocal of under-treated TiN sheet resistance by the thickness of a non-treated TiN film was developed to monitor inline R-c. The physical interpretation of the index is the received plasma energy per unit TiN thickness. The offline plasma-treatment index was linearly correlated to the R-c of patterned wafers when the MOCVD-TiN film was over-treated by plasma. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

MoO3 is known to be an efficient co-catalyst to improve the charge separation efficiency. To elucidate the mechanism underlying the enhanced photoactivity of melon calcined with MoO3, the electronic structure of the interface at which melon and MoO3 are in direct contact has been investigated by ultraviolet and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy. The samples were further characterized via photocatalytic activity measurements, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Excellent photodegradation ability of an organic compound was observed for the melon:MoO3 sample prepared via calcination at 400 degrees C for 3 h, which had a blue-black color. From the obtained results, the origin of the high photoactivity of melon:MoO3 composites is consistently explained by taking account of gradient of energy levels in the heterojunction and the states of the oxygen vacancies in MoO3.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000536933200027		
J	Liu, Shenghao; Ju, Jianfang; Xia, Guangmin								Identification of the flavonoid 3 '-hydroxylase and flavonoid 3 ',5 '-hydroxylase genes from Antarctic moss and their regulation during abiotic stress								GENE				543	1			145	152		10.1016/j.gene.2014.03.026				JUN 10 2014	2014	Flavonoids are ubiquitous plant secondary metabolites, and their hydroxylation pattern determines their color, stability, and antioxidant capacity. The hydroxylation pattern of the B-ring of flavonoids is determined by the activity of two members of cytochrome P450 protein (P450) family, the flavonoid 3 '-hydroxylase (F3 ' H) and flavonoid 3 ',5 '-hydroxylase (F3 ',5 ' H). However, they are still not well documented in lower plants such as bryophytes. We report the identification of gene encoding F3 ' H, F3',5 ' H from Antarctic moss Pohlia nutans and their transcriptional regulation under different stress conditions. Totally, sixteen cDNAs were isolated from P. nutans by RT-PCR and RACE techniques, all of which were predicted to code for F3 ' Hs or F3 ',5 ' Hs based on their annotations of Blast results. Amino acid alignment showed that they possessed the featured conserved domains of flavonoid hydroxylase, including proline-rich "hinge" region, EXXR motif, oxygen binding pocket motif, heme binding domain and substrate recognition sites. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that moss F3 ' Hs and F3 ',5 ' Hs were highly conserved and have independent evolution from the monocots, dicots and ferns. Meanwhile, real-time PCR analysis revealed that the expreSsion profiling of flavonoid hydroxylase genes was influenced by diverse abiotic stresses including cold, salinity, drought or UV-B radiation and plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) or jasmonic acid apo treatment. Since 3 ',4 ',5 '-hydroxylated flavonoid-derivatives may serve a multitude of functions, including antioxidant activity and UV filters, the evolution and expression profile of flavonoid hydroxylase probably reflect the adaptive value of Antarctic moss in the acclimation of polar environment.

J	O'Brien, PJ; Herschlag, D								Functional interrelationships in the alkaline phosphatase superfamily: phosphodiesterase activity of Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase								BIOCHEMISTRY				40	19			5691	5699		10.1021/bi0028892				MAY 15 2001	2001	Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase (AP) is a proficient phosphomonoesterase with two Zn2+ ions in its active site. Sequence homology suggests a distant evolutionary relationship between AP and alkaline phosphodiesterase/nucleotide pyrophosphatase, with conservation of the catalytic metal ions. Furthermore, many other phosphodiesterases, although not evolutionarily related, have a similar active site configuration of divalent metal ions in their active sites. These observations led us to test whether AP could also catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphate diesters. The results described herein demonstrate that AP does have phosphodiesterase activity: the phosphatase and phosphodiesterase activities copurify over several steps, inorganic phosphate, a strong competitive inhibitor of AP, inhibits the phosphodiesterase and phosphatase activities with the same inhibition constant: a point mutation that weakens phosphate binding to AP correspondingly weakens phosphate inhibition of the phosphodiesterase activity; and mutation of active site residues substantially reduces both the mono- and diesterase activities. AP accelerates the rate of phosphate diester hydrolysis by 10(11)-fold relative to the rate of the uncatalyzed reaction [(k(cat)/K-m)/k(w)], Although this rate enhancement is substantial, it is at least 10(6)-fold less than the rate enhancement for AP-catalyzed phosphate monoester hydrolysis. Mutational analysis suggests that common active site features contribute to hydrolysis of both phosphate monoesters and phosphate diesters, However, mutation of the active site arginine to serine, R166S, decreases the monoesterase activity but not the diesterase activity, suggesting that the interaction of this arginine with the nonbridging oxygen(s) of the phosphate monoester substrate provides a substantial amount of the preferential hydrolysis of phosphate monoesters, The observation of phosphodiesterase activity extends the previous observation that AP has a low level of sulfatase activity, further establishing the functional interrelationships among the sulfatases, phosphatases, and phosphodiesterases within the evolutionarily related AP superfamily. The catalytic promiscuity of AP could have facilitated divergent evolution via gene duplication by providing a selective advantage upon which natural selection could have acted.									149	0	1	0	110	0	158			0006-2960			WOS:000168635900013	11341834

Their properties have been determined by X-ray diffraction, ultraviolet-visible-light diffuse reflectance spectra, field emission scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption and X-ray photoelectron spectra. These results demonstrate that ethanol solvent has significant influence on the morphology, optical and electronic nature for such marigold-like ZnIn2S4 microspheres. The visible light photocatalytic activities of the ZnIn2S4 have been evaluated by selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde using molecular oxygen as oxidant. The results show that 100% conversion along with >99% selectivity are reached over ZnIn2S4 prepared in ethanol solvent under visible light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm) of 2 h, but only 58% conversion and 57% yield are reached over ZnIn2S4 prepared in aqueous solvent. A possible mechanism of the high photocatalytic activity for selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol over ZnIn2S4 is proposed and discussed. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In this work, oxygen doping was employed to enhance the photodegradation of organic pollutants in water on graphitic carbon nitride (GCNO) under visible light. For further absorption extension, four organic dyes (Eosin-Y, Perylene, Nile-red and Coumarin) were adopted to dye-sensitize the GCNO photocatalyst. It was found that O-doping can promote dye sensitization, which was dependent on the type of dyes and influenced the photodegradation efficiencies of methylene blue (MB) and phenol. Nile-red sensitized GCNO presented the best activity in MB degradation under lambda > 480 nm irradiations while Eosin-Y showed the best sensitization performance for phenol degradation under lambda > 420 nm light source. However, dye sensitization was not effective for enhanced pollutant degradation on GCN without O-doping. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS), photoluminescence (PL) spectra, and photocurrent analyses were applied to investigate the mechanism of carriers' transfer, which indicated that dye molecules could inject extra electrons into GCNO energy band and the energy dislocation could suppress electron/hole recombination, enhancing photocatalytic performances.

An amorphous, alumina-poor Ba-Al-Si-O (G1) phase was observed in contact with residual SiO2 particles after the 650 degrees C heat treatment, Although not a starting component of the precursor, elemental silicon was also detected after the 300-900 degrees C heat treatments. Silicon particles produced during the 300 degrees C heat treatment were surrounded by an amorphous Ba-Al-Si-O (G2) phase that contained more alumina than the G1 phase. Pine-grained barium orthosilicate (Ba2SiO4) and sanbornite (BaSi2O5) were observed after the 650 degrees C treatment, along with thin, plate-shaped grains of BaAl2Si2O8, The latter two phases were surrounded by an amorphous Ba-Al-Si-O (G3) phase that possessed less alumina than the G2 phase. Smaller platelets of BaAl2Si2O8 were also detected after the 300 degrees C treatment. After annealing at a peak temperature of 1650 degrees C, BaAl2Si2O8 was the only silicate compound detected by TEM, Novel reaction paths to BaAl2Si2O8, which are consistent with the present TEM observations and prior XRD and SEM/EDX analyses (Part I), are discussed.									21	1	1	0	0	0	23			0002-7820			WOS:000076895000030

Although its important oxygen transport functions has been extensively reported, studies on the immune function of hemoglobin in mollusc are few. Research on immune of hemoglobin of ark shell Scapharca broughtonii attracted more and more attention due to its ownership of erythrocyte comparing with many other shellfish. In this study, the hemoglobin cDNA of S. broughtonii was cloned by EST and RACE methods (named as SbHb). Sequence analysis revealed that the cDNA was 946 bp in length, including an open reading frame (ORF) of 459 bp which encoded a polypeptide of 152 amino acid residues, and a 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of 313 bp, a 3'-UTR of 174 bp. Sequence and homology analysis showed that the SbHb shared similarity with that of other related species. The mRNA expression profiles of SbHb in tested tissues analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that the mRNA of SbHb could be all detected in foot, gill, mantle, adductor muscle, haemocytes and hepatopancreas, and the highest level was found in the haemocytes, which is 163.2 times higher than that in adductor muscle. Vibrio anguillarurn stimulation and hypoxia treatment both had significant impact on the expression of SbHb, which showed the same trends as increasing first to the highest at 16 h after treatment and then followed by declining. Recombinant protein of SbHb (rSbHb) was successfully obtained by prokaryotic expression, and further function analysis indicated obviously that the rSbHb had very strong phenoloxidase-like activity (PO-like activity) and it could remarkably inhibit growth of gram-negative bacteria V. anguillarum. All the data suggested that the SbHb plays a significant role in the process of antibacterial and anoxia tolerance reaction in S. broughtonii, providing the evidence that SbHb is a key immune factor.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			1050-4648	1095-9947		WOS:000437385000008	29649584	
J	Petit, Anne-Noelle; Eullaffroy, Philippe; Debenest, Timothee; Gagne, Francois								Toxicity of PAMAM dendrimers to Chlamydomonas reinhardtii								AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY				100	2			187	193		10.1016/j.aquatox.2010.01.019				OCT 15 2010	2010	In recent decades, a new class of polymeric materials, PAMAM dendrimers, has attracted marked interest owing to their unique nanoscopic architecture and their hopeful perspectives in nanomedicine and therapeutics. However, the potential release of dendrimers into the aquatic environment raises the issue about their toxicity on aquatic organisms. Our investigation sought to estimate the toxicity of cationic PAMAM dendrimers on the green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Algal cultures were exposed to different concentrations (0.3-10 mg L-1) of low dendrimer generations (G2, G4 and G5) for 72 h. Potential adverse effects on Chlamydomonas were assessed using esterase activity (cell viability), photosynthetic O-2 evolution, pigments content and chlorophyll a fluorescence transient. According to the median inhibitory concentration (IC50) appraised from esterase activity, toxicity on cell viability decreased with dendrimer generation number (2,3 and 5 mg L-1 for G2, G4 and G5 dendrimers, respectively). Moreover, the three generations of dendrimers did not induce the same changes in the photosynthetic metabolism of the green alga. O-2 evolution was stimulated in cultures exposed to the lowest generations tested (i.e. G2 and G4) whereas no significant effects were observed with G5. In addition, total chlorophyll content was increased after G2 treatment at 2.5 mg L-1. Finally, G2 and G4 had positive effects on photosystem II (PSII): the amount of active PSII reaction centers, the primary charge separation and the electron transport between Q(A) and Q(B) were all increased inducing activation of the photosynthetic electron transport chain. These changes resulted in stimulation of full photosynthetic performance. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

In particular, photocorrosion can be significant and plays a central role during photoelectrochemical activity of transparent semiconducting oxides. Here, we utilize an electrochemical flow cell combined with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) to enable the in situ study of the time-resolved release of zinc into solution under simultaneous radiation of UV-light. With this system we study the dissolution of zinc oxide single crystals with (0001) and (10 (1) over bar0) orientations. At acidic and alkaline pH, we characterized potential dependent dissolution rates into both the oxygen and the hydrogen evolving conditions. A significant influence of the UV radiation and the pH of the electrolyte was observed. The observed dissolution behavior agrees well with the surface chemistry and stabilization mechanism of ZnO surfaces. In particular, polar ZnO(0001) shows ideal stability at low potentials and under hydrogen evolution conditions. Whereas ZnO(10 (1) over bar0) sustains higher dissolution rates, while it is inactive for water splitting. Our data demonstrates that surface design and fundamental understanding of surface chemistry provides an effective path to rendering electroactive surfaces stable under operating conditions.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000592923100038	33166115

The aerogels of reduced graphene oxide are mouldable and light weight, with a porosity up to 99.9%, consisting mainly of macropores. Graphene aerogel preparation by self-assembly in the liquid phase is a promising strategy due to its tunability and sustainability. For graphene aerogels prepared by a hydrothermal method, it is known that the pH value has an impact on their properties but it is unclear how pH affects the auto-assembly process leading to the final properties. We have monitored the time evolution of the chemical and morphological properties of aerogels as a function of the initial pH value. In the hydrothermal treatment process, the hydrogel is precipitated earlier and with lower oxygen content for basic pH values (similar to 13 wt% O) than for acidic pH values (similar to 20 wt% O). Moreover, similar to 7 wt% of nitrogen is incorporated on the graphene nanosheets at basic pH generated by NH3 addition. To our knowledge, there is no precedent showing that the pH value affects the microstructure of graphene nanosheets, which become more twisted and bent for the more intensive deoxygenation occurring at basic pH. The bent nanosheets attained at pH = 11 reduce the stacking by the basal planes and they connect via the borders, hence leading eventually to higher pore volumes. In contrast, the flatter graphene nanosheets attained under acidic pH entail more stacking and higher oxygen content after a long hydrothermal treatment. The gravimetric absorption capacity of non-polar solvents scales directly with the pore volume. The aerogels have proved to be highly selective, recyclable and robust for the absorption of nonpolar solvents in water. The control of the porous structure and surface chemistry by manipulation of pH and time will also pave the way for other applications such as supercapacitors or batteries.									44	7	0	0	7	0	47			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000425348100047	29410999

Our experimental evidence shows that the four phytotoxins have multiple targets in chloroplasts, which mainly lie in photosystem II (PSII), not photosystem I (PSI). They share an original action site by blocking electron transport beyond Q(A) (primary plastoquinone acceptor) at PSII acceptor side since a fast Increase of the J-step level is the greatest change in chlorophyll a fluorescence induction kinetics OJIP in C. reinhardtii cells treated with the phytotoxins. UA decreases photosynthetic activity by reducing O-2 evolution rate, interrupting PSII electron transport at both the donor and acceptor sides, inactivating the PSII reaction centers (RCs), reducing the content of chlorophylls and carotenoids, destroying the conformation of antenna pigment assemblies, and casuing the degradation of Dl/D2 proteins. SA damage to photosynthetic machinery is mainly attributed to inhibition of PSII electron transport beyond Q(A) at the acceptor side, inactivation of the PSII RCs, reduction of chlorophyll content, digestion of thylakoid ploypeptides and destabilization of thylakoid membranes. Both CA and BA affect the photosynthetic process by decreasing PSII electron transport efficiency at the acceptor side and the amount of active PSII RCs. Besides, the initial cause of BA-inhibiting photosynthesis is also assocaited with the O-2 evolution rate and the disconnection of some antenna molecules from PSII RCs.									23	1	0	0	17	0	24			0981-9428			WOS:000436223400001	29751250

Stabilizing and accelerating the formation of *OCHO intermediate is the key to achieve high-selectivity formate production. Herein, Bi nanoparticles embedded in pyrrolic-N-dominated doped carbon nanosheets (similar to 10 nm) (PNCB) delivered a maximum formate selectivity of 94.8% (-1.05 V) and a partial current density of - 22 mA cm(-2) in H-type electrolyzers. According to theoretical calculation results, the critical pyrrolic-N doping in carbon nanosheets promoted electron transfer from N to Bi atoms, which facilitates stabilizing *OCHO intermediate and boosting formate formation. The rechargeable Zn-CO2 batteries applying PNCB as anode catalysts displayed the maximum power density of 1.43 mW cm(-2) with CO emission below 11%. For coupled CO2 reduction (catalyzed by PNCB) and oxygen evolution (catalyzed by 10 wt% Ir/C), a large current density up to 180 mA cm(-2) in flow cells was also achieved. This work provides an effective strategy to regulate the support components and electron accumulation towards electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to formate as well as related clean energy devices.									18	1	0	0	0	0	18			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000731506800002

To investigate mechanisms underlying thylakoid protein targeting, we identified nuclear mutations in maize that cause targeting defects, We found two mutations, tha1 and hcf106, that disrupt the localization of different sets of proteins to the thylakoid lumen, The tha1 mutation interferes with the targeting of one chloroplast-encoded protein, cytochrome f, and three nuclear-encoded proteins, plastocyanin, the psaF gene product and the 33 kDa subunit of the oxygen-evolving complex. The hcf106 mutation interferes with the targeting of the 16 and 23 kDa subunits of the oxygen-evolving complex, The tha1 and hcf106 phenotypes provide the first in vivo evidence supporting the existence of two distinct thylakoid-targeting pathways. Their phenotypes also provide evidence that one chloroplast-encoded protein, cytochrome f, engages the 'tha1' pathway, indicating that nuclear- and chloroplast-encoded proteins can be targeted common machinery.									134	0	0	0	118	0	135			0261-4189			WOS:A1995RQ66900006	7664731

To elucidate the structural and chemical features of unsupported and carbon supported ruthenium nanoparticles prepared by thermolysis of Ru-3(CO)(12) in an organic solvent with and without the presence of dissolved selenium, different bulk and surface sensitive methods such as transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffractometry, thermogravimetry coupled with mass spectrometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis were performed. It was found that the as-grown catalytic particles prepared without Se and handled under ambient conditions are distinguished by a ruthenium core of 4 nm size, the surface of which is covered by an amorphous ruthenium oxide/hydroxide and metal organic residues from the process of synthesis. In the presence of Se, Ru-Se and Se-O bondings have additionally been found at the surface. After heat treatment at 900 C under vacuum, organic residues and ruthenium oxides could be removed. The particles have grown to a size of about 10 nm, the surfaces of which are covered by Ru-Se and Ru-SeO3 units. The as-grown and heat-treated catalysts were characterized electrochemically by cyclovoltammetry, rotating disk electrode with and without methanol in the electrolyte, and rotating ring disk electrode measurements to quantify H2O2 production. As expected from structural analysis, best results have been obtained with heat-treated, Se-modified ruthenium catalysts. It is proposed that in the heat-treated samples an interaction between Se2-, [Se-2](2-), and SeO32- decorating the surface of the ruthenium particles is responsible for the improved oxygen reduction process.									43	1	0	0	1	0	45			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000244993800070

Chemical and quantitative complementary information are thus obtained.Exposure of water-passivated plane aluminum samples to NO/N-2 mainly results in the formation of nitrites, as identified by PM-IRRAS. O-2 hardly reacts with adsorbed nitrites in the absence of NO in the gaseous atmosphere. In contrast, the introduction of O-2 to a NO/N-2 mixture leads to the rapid transformation of nitrites to nitrates, both water-solvated and oxide-coordinated species. The fact that the transformation of nitrites to nitrates occurs only in the presence of NO and O-2 may suggest that nitrites react with gas phase NO2 to form nitrates and NO. The evolution of the PM-IRRAS spectra of the Al surface with the composition of the gaseous phase is fully correlated to the mass uptake changes measured by QCM.From the PM-IRRAS and QCM measurements obtained during the same experiments, the ratio of the IR response coefficient of nitrates to that of nitrites (3) is reported for the first time.

Films were grown on LaAlO3 (001), SrTiO3 (001) and sapphire (R-plane) substrates. Pb(thd)(2) and Ti(O'Pr)(2)(thd)(2) (thd = 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionate) dissolved in toluene were used as precursors. Evolution of film composition, surface morphology and microstructure with deposition conditions were studied. Microstructure of the films was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in Bragg-Brentano and Schulz geometries and by Raman spectroscopy. Epitaxial films on perovskite substrates consisted of dominant c-axis and minor a-axis textured zones (c-domains and a-domains). The amount of a-domains in films depended mainly on deposition temperature. The twinning in a- and c-domains was observed and twinning (tilt) angles depended on deposition conditions and on substrate.

These activities are also inhibited upon partial depletion of bicarbonate in the medium and restored by the addition of 0.1-10 mM NaHCO3. At concentrations higher than 20 mu M formate induces the known bicarbonate effect on the acceptor side of PS 2 which dominates at millimolar concentrations of the agent. In Tris-treated (Mn-depleted) DT-20 the restoration of electron flow with 0.2 mu M MnCl2 (4 Mn atoms per one PS 2 reaction center) in the medium depleted of bicarbonate is efficient only after the addition of 5 mM NaHCO3. The restoration in the presence of NaHCO3 is accompanied by an increased functional binding of Mn2+ to PS 2 membranes which is confirmed by experiments on removal of added Mn2+ by either sedimentation or the addition of EDTA. Pre-illumination increases the Mn binding in the presence of bicarbonate. The data show that the bicarbonate effect on the donor side of PS 2 is related to a relatively low-affinity bound pool of bicarbonate. It is suggested that bicarbonate takes part in the formation of the Mn-cluster capable of water oxidation as an obligatory ligand or through modification of the binding site(s) of Mn.									35	2	1	0	29	0	36			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:A1995TQ94600027	24301586	
J	Boll, M; Fuchs, G								Benzoyl-coenzyme A reductase (dearomatizing), a key enzyme of anaerobic aromatic metabolism - ATP dependence of the reaction, purification and some properties of the enzyme from Thauera aromatica strain K172								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY				234	3			921	933		10.1111/j.1432-1033.1995.921_a.x				DEC 15 1995	1995	Anoxic metabolism of many aromatic compounds proceeds via the common intermediate benzoyl-CoA. Benzoyl-CoA is dearomatized by benzoyl-CoA reductase (dearomatizing) in a two-electron reduction step, possibly yielding cyclohex-1,5-diene-1-carboxyl-CoA. This process has to overcome a high activation energy and is considered a biological Birch reduction. The central, aromatic-ring-reducing enzyme was investigated for the first time in the denitrifying bacterium Thauera aromatica strain K172. A spectrophotometric assay was developed which was strictly dependent on MgATP, both with cell extract and with purified enzyme. The oxygen-sensitive new enzyme was purified 35-fold with 20% yield under anaerobic conditions in the presence of 0.25 mM dithionite. It had a native molecular mass of approximately 170 kDa and consisted of four subunits a,b,c,d of 48, 45, 38 and 32 kDa. The oligomer composition of the protein most likely is abcd. The ultraviolet/visible spectrum of the protein as isolated, but without dithionite, was characteristic for an iron-sulfur protein with an absorption maximum at 279 nm and a broad shoulder at 390 nm. The estimated molar absorption coefficient at 390 nm was 35 000 M(-1) cm(-1). Reduction of the enzyme by dithionite resulted in a decrease of absorbance at 390 MI, and the colour turned from greenish-brown to red-brown. The enzyme contained 10.8+/-1.5 mol Fe and 10.5 +/- 1.5 mol acid-labile sulfur/mol. Besides zinc (0.5 mol/mol protein) no other metals nor selenium could be detected in significant amounts. The enzyme preparation contained a flavin or flavin-like compound; the estimated content was 0.3 mol/mol enzyme. The enzyme reaction required MgATP and a strong reductant such as Ti(III). The reaction catalyzed is: benzoyl-CoA + 2 Ti(III) + n ATP --> nonaromatic acyl-CoA + 2 Ti(IV) + n ADP + n P-i. The estimated number n of ATP molecules hydrolyzed/two electrons transferred in benzoyl-CoA reduction is 2-4. In the absence of benzoyl-CoA the enzyme exhibited oxygen-sensitive ATPase activity. The enzyme was specific for Mg2+-ATP, other nucleoside triphosphates being inactive (<1%). Mg2+ could be substituted to some extent by Mn2+, Fe2+ and less efficiently by Co2+. Benzoate was not reduced, whereas some fluoro, hydroxy, amino and methyl ana logues of the activated benzoic acid were reduced, albeit at much lower rate; the products remain to be identified. The specific activity with reduced methyl viologen as the electron donor was 0.55 mu mol min(-1) mg(-1) corresponding to a catalytic number of 1.6 s(-1). The apparent K-m values under the assay conditions (0.5 mM for both reduced and oxidized methyl viologen) of benzoyl-CoA and ATP were 15 mu M and 0.6 mM, respectively. The enzyme was inactivated by ethylene, bipyridyl and, in higher concentrations, by acetylene. Benzoyl-CoA reductase also catalyzed the ATP-dependent two-electron reduction of hydroxylamine (K-m 0.15 mM) and azide. Some of the properties of the enzyme are reminiscent of those of nitrogenase which similarly overcomes the high activation energy for dinitrogen reduction by coupling electron transfer to the hydrolysis of ATP.									180	0	0	0	162	0	189			0014-2956			WOS:A1995TP56100029	8575453

Extended solubility is readily achieved in both techniques for the entire composition range investigated: melts with 0-30% ZrO2 and precursors with 0-50% ZrO2. However, solidification of under cooled droplets yields almost exclusively single phase powders with the structure of cubic yttria (D5(3)). In contrast, the pyrolysis route leads to a sequence of metastable microstructures beginning with a nanocrystalline disordered fluorite-based (C1) solid solution. Further heating leads to the evolution of much larger (micron size) flake crystals with a {001} texture, concurrent with partial ordering of the oxygen ions to the sites occupied in the D5(3) structure. The driving force for ordering and the rate of grain growth decrease with increasing ZrO2 addition. Abrupt heating to high temperatures or electron irradiation can induce ordering without substantial grain growth. There is no significant reduction in porosity during the recrystallization, which with the other observations suggests that grain growth is driven by the free energy available for the ordering transformation from fluorite to the yttria structure. This route offers opportunities for single crystal thin film development at relatively low processing temperatures.									29	0	0	0	0	0	29			0956-7151			WOS:A1994NM40100007		
J	Hosseinpour, Morteza; Soltani, M.; Nathwani, Jatin								Renewable energy integration with hot compressed water in heavy oil upgrading: A practice toward sustainability								JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION				334						130268	10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.130268				FEB 1 2022	2022	All economies need energy for growth, particularly emerging ones with continued demand for fossil fuels that move them to unconventional energy sources such as heavy oil. However, the presence of large quantities of heteroatoms-sulfur, nitrogen, oxygen, and metals - in heavy oil is a major contributor to environmental pollution during the combustion phase. This requires the crude and residue to be upgraded and fractionated within tight specifications. Hot compressed water (HCW), at or beyond the critical point (374 ?, 22.1 MPa), has emerged as a highly promising environmentally benign and efficient method for heavy oil upgrading to replace conventional toxic solvents. The synergistic effect of HCW with energy generated from renewable sources is a new avenue into a cleaner carbon energy system for fuel production with the benefits of reduced energy con-sumption and lower carbon dioxide emission. This paper provides a comprehensive review in multi-scale which underlines the recent evolution and the challenges in this field. In addition, the critical factors and emerging gaps influencing the heavy oil upgrading in HCW are appended. Eventually, a set of suggestions for integrating renewable energy technologies with heavy oil upgrading in HCW and future perspective has been reported.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0959-6526	1879-1786		WOS:000773066800004

Hollow fibre membrane technology has reached clinical stage and is currently the most widely used when gas exchange of native lungs fail completely. In translation research, three areas of enquiry have emerged, namely, bioengineered lungs, microfluidic technology and photocatalytic oxygenation of blood; these technologies are yet to reach clinical trials. The present photocatalytic oxygenation review has twofold purpose: the first, is to summarize the overall trajectory of lung assist device development, the second, is to describe the evolution of the concept of photocatalytic oxygenation as a potential method of increasing oxygen content of blood. The efforts so far have realized a proof of concept and a 6% increase in the oxygenation of blood with Titanium oxide and Indium tin oxide (TiO2+ ITO) thin film photocatalyst. Photo Hall effect technique is employed to quantify the photocatalytic efficacy. This article reviews fundamental concepts as well as the progress made thus far and presents the challenges that need to be surmounted to realize the full potential of the technology at the bedside.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2515-7639		WOS:000559773800001

Various combinations of the masses of the CO core and the overlying He layer are examined. Nuclear burning is directly computed with an alpha network from C-12 to Ni-56 as a part of the hydrodynamic calculation. The nucleosynthesis yield is similar to that needed for Type Ia supernovae to explain the variation in alpha elements relative to iron in Population II stars. Significant amounts of radioactive Ti-44 produced. The yields are similar to those predicted from one-dimensional computations, despite the very nonspherical hydrodynamic behavior. Light curves are simulated and compared to observations of Type Ia supernovae. The observed variation in peak absolute luminosity and in post-maximum decline rate is reproduced in a natural way. A rough comparison of predicted velocities with observations of Ca II H and K, Mg II lambda 4481 and Si II lambda 6355 in SN 1989B (in NGC 3627) is promising; implications for the use of Type Ia supernovae as distance indicators are discussed, and the key importance of spectral synthesis is stressed.									223	8	0	0	0	0	224			0004-637X			WOS:A1995RX15700005

XRD, SEM, TG-DSC and particularly XPS were employed for characterizations. Sb2O4 and FeSbO4 are the only new phases detected. The formation of FeSbO4 is a more exothermic but slower reaction than oxidation of Sb2O3. A mechanical grinding of Sb2O3 and Fe2O3 leads to a significant dispersion of Sb2O3 possibly because of its low hardness. Dispersion of reference Sb2O4 in this way is negligible. During the heating of a mixture of Sb2O3 and Fe2O3 with an atomic ratio of Sb/Fe = 0.5 at 200-1000 degrees C in ambient air, the thermal spreading of Sb1O3 onto Fe 03 increases with increasing temperature until Sb2O3 is oxidized into Sb2O4. The surface atomic ratio of Sb/Fe measured by XPS, R-Sb/Fe, reaches a maximum around 400 degrees C. The complete oxidation of Sb2O3 leads to a decrease in RSb/Fe because of poorer dispersibility of Sb2O4. The formation of FeSbO4 starting at ca. 800 degrees C causes a further decrease in R-sb/Fe, but the R-Sb/Fe is still 3.2 times the nominal bulk Sb/Fe ratio when the Sb2O4 is completely transformed into FeSbO4.									22	1	0	0	2	0	23			1520-6106			WOS:000233684500049	16853920

SPICA TO ANTARES								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				434	1			306	318		10.1086/174729				OCT 10 1994	1994	A 10 M(circle dot) model of Population I composition is evolved from the hydrogen-burning main sequence onto the early ''super''asymptotic giant branch (ESAGB), where hydrogen does not burn, the dominant source of surface luminosity is shell helium burning, and carbon burning in the helium-exhausted core converts all of the initial C-12 and Ne-22 and some of the O-16 in this core into isotopes of oxygen, neon, sodium, magnesium, and other heavy elements. The entire ESAGB phase lasts similar to 4.6 x 10(4) yr, and helium burning is the primary source of surface luminosity for all but similar to 3000 yr. The carbon-burning phase lasts similar to 2 x 10(4) yr. In comparison, the main-sequence phase lasts similar to 2 x 10(7) yr, and the core helium-burning phase lasts similar to 4 X 10(6) yr At the end of the core carbon-burning phase, dredge-up decreases the mass of the hydrogen-exhausted core from similar to 2.46M(circle dot) to similar to 1.315 M(circle dot). During the dredge-up episode, in addition to products of complete hydrogen burning, products of incomplete helium burning are mixed into the hydrogen-rich convective envelope. At the end of the second dredge-up phase, the model has an electron-degenerate carbon-exhausted core of mass similar to 1.285 M(circle dot). Between the carbon-exhausted core and the hydrogen-rich convective envelope are three layers which are each of mass similar to 0.01 M(circle dot) and which contain (1) C-12 and O-16 at comparable abundances by mass; (2) C-12 and He-4 at comparable abundances by mass; and (3) mostly He-4 with some C-12. The abundances by mass of the main constituents of the carbon-exhausted core vary significantly through the core. At the center, abundances by mass are X(O-16)similar to 0.80, X(Ne-20)similar to 0.11, X(Na-23)similar to 0.03, X(Mg-24)similar to 0.0075, and X(Mg-26)similar to 0.01, whereas, near the edge of the core, X(O-16)similar to 0.19, X(Ne-20)similar to 0.50, X(Na-23)similar to 0.04, and X(Mg-24)similar to 0.27. The abundance of Na-23 is large enough that, if the mass of the SAGB core can grow to similar to 1.37 M(circle dot), core collapse into a neutron star will be initiated by electron capture on Na-23 rather than on Mg-24.									92	1	0	0	1	0	93			0004-637X			WOS:A1994PK76400031

Herein, the controllable synthesis of ultrathin defect-rich layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoarrays assembled on metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived Co-NC microarrays for boosting overall water splitting is reported. The Co-NC microarrays can not only provide abundant nucleation sites to produce a large number of LDH nuclei for favoring the growth of ultrathin LDHs, but also help to inhibit their tendency to aggregate. Impressively, five types of ultrathin bimetallic LDH nanoarrays can be electrodeposited on the Co-NC microarrays, forming desirable nanoarray-on-macroarray architectures, which show high uniformity with thicknesses from 1.5 to 1.9 nm. As expected, the electrocatalytic performance is significantly enhanced by exploiting the respective advantages of Co-NC microarrays and ultrathin LDH nanoarrays as well as the potential synergies between them. Especially, the optimal Co-NC@Ni2Fe-LDH as both cathode and anode can afford the lowest cell voltage of 1.55 V at 10 mA cm(-2), making it one of the best earth-abundant bifunctional electrocatalysts for water electrolysis. This study provides new insights into the rational design of highly-active and low-cost electrocatalysts and facilitates their promising applications in the fields of energy storage and conversion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000815740000001	35754167

Yet the extent to which individuals vary over different timescales is poorly understood. Haptoglobin, an acute phase protein, is an interesting parameter for studying variability as it is easily quantified and concentrations vary widely due to the molecule's role in inflammation, infection and trauma. We quantified haptoglobin in pigeon plasma samples collected over fourteen months and calculated repeatability to evaluate if haptoglobin concentration is a distinctive trait of individuals. We also explored the capacity of baseline haptoglobin concentrations to predict an array of physiological changes associated with a subsequent experimentally-induced inflammatory response. Maximum repeatability, which occurred over a short mid-winter interval, equaled 0.57. Baseline haptoglobin concentrations predicted response haptoglobin concentrations better than any other endotoxin-induced change. Overall, we identified several strengths and limitations of baseline [Hp] quantification. Acknowledging these qualities should lead to more refined conclusions in studies of the ecology and evolution of immune function. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Initial amorphous LCMO thin films were obtained by metal-organic deposition at 500 degrees C. Crystallization and epitaxial growth of the films was achieved using a KrF pulsed laser irradiation while the film/substrate samples were kept at 500 degrees C. High resolution transmission electron microscopy observations on cross-sections demonstrate the formation mechanism of the epitaxial films. The crystallization process starts at the LCMO/STO interface and grows by increasing the number of laser shots. A fully crystallized film was obtained after 5min of irradiation. The film/substrate interface was found to be sharp and abrupt. The temperature dependence of the resistance R(T) shows various behaviors, starting from insulating to semiconducting and metal-insulator transition material during the formation of the manganite film. The oxygen content was also improved by increasing the irradiation time. Promising values of the temperature coefficient of resistance were obtained from these manganite films for prospect integration in silicon based microbolometric devices.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0947-8396	1432-0630		WOS:000248064100009

Included in this chapter are emerging topics pertaining to the application of sulfur-nutrient deprivation to attenuate O-2-evolution and to promote H-2-production, as well as the genetic; engineering of sulfate uptake through manipulation of a newly reported sulfate permease in the chloroplast of the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Application of the green algal hydrogenase assembly genes is examined in efforts to confer H-2-production capacity to other commercially significant unicellular green algae. Engineering a solution to the O-2 sensitivity of the green algal hydrogenase is discussed as an alternative approach to sulfur nutrient deprivation, along with starch accumulation in microalgae for enhanced H-2-production. Lastly, current efforts aiming to optimize light utilization in transgenic microalgae for enhanced H-2-production under mass culture conditions are presented. It is evident that application of genetic engineering technologies and the use of transgenic green algae will improve prospects for commercial exploitation of these photosynthetic micro-organisms in the generation of H-2, a clean and renewable fuel.									40	1	0	0	30	0	42			0065-2598	2214-8019	978-0-387-75531-1	WOS:000251745700010	18161495

However, most TMP nanostructures are prepared via rigorous synthetic methods and harmful precursors, restricting their applications. Meanwhile, the rational design of structural characteristics and surface modification of TMPs needs to be considered to improve their catalytic activity and durability in both alkaline and acidic media. Here we report a simultaneous MOF decomposition and phosphorization strategy in multicomponent NH3 plasma to prepare nickel phosphide encapsulated in N-doped carbon layers (Ni12P5@NC). The combination of the high chemical reactivity and low thermal effect of plasma enables low-temperature phosphorization with red phosphorus as the P source. Carambola-like Ni12P5@NC exhibits low overpotential (50 mV in alkali and 82 mV in acid, 20 mA cm(-2)) and superior operational stability, showing promising application toward water electrolysis.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000539350100031

Unpolished natural diamond seeds are used as substrates in the temperature (T-s) range 850-1200 degrees C. The gas mixture of methane (CH4), hydrogen (H,) and oxygen (0,) is used for the deposition of diamond. The deposition pressure is varied in the range 90 to 150 Torr. The films are characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Raman spectroscopy techniques. The growth morphology of the films is found to be a sensitive function of the deposition parameters. The crystalline nature of the films change from polycrystalline to single crystal as we increase T, and for a certain set of parameters the filamentary growth of the diamond crystals can be seen. The films are polycrystalline in the range Of substrate temperature 850-900 degrees C and oriented grains of diamond crystals arc evident as the T, increases. The single crystal diamond growth is observed to proceed via the step growth mechanism with the evidence of bunching of the steps. Our study explores evolution of the growth of single crystal diamond in a wide range of parameters. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Phase fields of selected members of the Ba(Zr0.7Ce0.2)(1-(x/0.9))PrxY0.1O3-delta series were studied as a function of composition and temperature by high-resolution neutron powder diffraction revealing symmetry changes in the sequence Pnma -> Imma -> R (3c) over bar -> Pm (3) over barm. Higher symmetry is favoured for low Pr contents and high temperatures, as consideration of tolerance factor suggests. A volume contraction, ascribed to dehydration, is observed by synchrotron X-ray diffraction on heating in air for lower x. Magnetic measurements and structural data support the presence of Pr in the IV valence state on the perovskite B site. Thermogravimetric analysis in CO2 to similar to 1253 K indicates better chemical stability for x <= 0.445, whereas decomposition occurred for higher x. Electrical conductivity increases by over two orders of magnitude in dry air at lower temperature from x = 0.225 to 0.675; total conductivity reaches a value of 0.4 S cm(-1) at 1173 K for x = 0.675. The series exhibits electron-hole transport with a positive pO(2) dependence which increases with temperature, consistent with participation of oxygen vacancies in charge compensation of the Y3+ acceptor dopant. The activation energy for thermally activated hole hopping in air in the range 523-773 K decreases from similar to 1 eV for BZCY72 to similar to 0.4 eV for x = 0.675. Conductivity is generally lower in humidified N-2 and air (pH(2)O approximate to 0.023 atm) than the corresponding dry atmospheres, consistent with consumption of holes by less mobile protonic species; however for x <= 0.225 the lower concentration of electron holes concomitant with higher oxygen-vacancy content in N-2 results in slightly higher conductivity in wet conditions due to hydration of vacancies.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000428670000012

It is interesting not only from a structural point of view but also from the perspective of its electronic, chemical, mechanical, and magnetic properties. We have developed an in situ homocoupling reaction of hexaethynylbenzene on Cu foil for the fabrication of large-area ordered films of graphdiyne. These films are uniform and composed of graphdiyne multilayers. The conductivity of graphdiyne films, calculated at 2.52 x 10(-4) S m(-1), is comparable to that of Si, suggesting excellent semiconducting properties. Through morphology-controlled syntheses, we have prepared several well-defined graphdiyne structures (e.g., nanotubes, nanowires, and nanowalls) having distinct properties. The graphdiyne nanotube arrays and graphdiyne nanowalls exhibited excellent field emission performance, higher than that of some other semiconductors such as graphite and carbon nanotubes. These structures have several promising applications, for example, as energy storage materials and as anode materials in batteries. The unique atomic arrangement and electronic structure of graphdiyne also inspired us to use it to develop highly efficient catalysts; indeed, its low reduction potential and highly conjugated electronic structure allow graphdiyne to be used as a reducing agent and stabilizer for the electroless deposition of highly dispersed and surfactant-free Pd clusters. GDY-based three-dimensional (3D) nanoarchitectures featuring well-defined porous network structures can function as highly active cathodes for H-2 evolution. Heteroatom-doped GDY structures are excellent metal-free electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Its excellent electrocatalytic activity and inexpensive, convenient, and scalable preparation make GDY a promising candidate for practical and efficient energy applications; indeed, we have explored the application of GDY as a highly efficient lithium storage material and have elucidated the method through which lithium storage occurs in multilayer GDY. Lithium-ion batteries featuring GDY-based electrodes display excellent electrochemical performance, including high specific capacity, outstanding rate performance, and long cycle life. We have also explored the application of GDY in energy conversion and found that it exhibits excellent conductivity.In this Account, we summarize the relationships between the functions of graphdiyne and its well-defined nanostructures. Our results suggest that GDY is a novel 2D carbon material possessing many attractive properties. It can be designed into new nanostructures and materials across a range of compositions, sizes, shapes, and functionalities and can be applied in the fields of electronics, optics, energy, and optoelectronics.									332	38	0	0	15	0	336			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000413392000007	28915007

It starts with ignition of a deflagration in a single off-centre bubble in a near-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf. Driven by buoyancy, the deflagration flame rises in a narrow cone towards the surface. For the most part, the main component of the flow of the expanding ashes remains radial, but upon reaching the outer, low-pressure layers of the white dwarf, an additional lateral component develops. This causes the deflagration ashes to converge again at the opposite side, where the compression heats fuel and a detonation may be launched. We first performed five three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the deflagration phase in 1.4 M-circle dot carbon/oxygen white dwarfs at intermediate-resolution (256(3) computational zones). We confirm that the closer the initial deflagration is ignited to the centre, the slower the buoyant rise and the longer the deflagration ashes takes to break out and close in on the opposite pole to collide. To test the GCD explosion model, we then performed a high-resolution (512(3) computational zones) simulation for a model with an ignition spot offset near the upper limit of what is still justifiable, 200 km. This high-resolution simulation met our deliberately optimistic detonation criteria, and we initiated a detonation. The detonation burned through the white dwarf and led to its complete disruption. For this model, we determined detailed nucleosynthetic yields by post-processing 10(6) tracer particles with a 384 nuclide reaction network, and we present multi-band light curves and time-dependent optical spectra. We find that our synthetic observables show a prominent viewing-angle sensitivity in ultraviolet and blue wavelength bands, which contradicts observed SNe Ia. The strong dependence on the viewing angle is caused by the asymmetric distribution of the deflagration ashes in the outer ejecta layers. Finally, we compared our model to SN 1991T. The overall flux level of the model is slightly too low, and the model predicts pre-maximum light spectral features due to Ca, S, and Si that are too strong. Furthermore, the model chemical abundance stratification qualitatively disagrees with recent abundance tomography results in two key areas: our model lacks low-velocity stable Fe and instead has copious amounts of high-velocity Ni-56 and stable Fe. We therefore do not find good agreement of the model with SN 1991T.									42	0	0	0	0	0	42			1432-0746			WOS:000384722600036

The standard Gibbs energy of formation of Ca3Ti8Al12O37 from component binary oxides is measured in the temperature range from 900 to 1250 K using a solid-state electrochemical cell incorporating single crystal CaF2 as the solid electrolyte. The results can be represented by the equation:delta G(f(0x))(0) (+/- 70)/J mol(-1) = -248474 - 15.706(T/K).Combining this information with thermodynamic data on calcium aluminates and titanates available in the literature, subsolidus phase relations in the pseudo-ternary system Al2O3-CaO-TiO2 are computed and presented as isothermal sections. The evolution of phase relations with temperature is highlighted. Chemical potential diagrams are computed at 1200 K, showing the stability domains of the various phases in the chemical potential-composition space. In each chemical potential diagram, chemical potential of one component is plotted against the cationic fraction of the other two components. The diagrams are valid at relatively high oxygen potentials where Ti is present in its four-valent state in all the oxide phases.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1547-7037	1863-7345		WOS:000306796800008

Herein, a novel core-shell-structured Bi2O4/BiO2-x composite was fabricated through a one-step hydrothermal method. The core-shell Bi2O4/BiO2-x composite presented distinct optical absorption property, including UV, visible, and near-infrared (NIR) light regions. Compared to Bi2O4 and BiO2-x, the Bi2O4/BiO2-x composite revealed improved broad spectrum light-responsive molecular oxygen activation into O-center dot(2)-, especially achieving O-center dot(2)- generation under NIR light irradiation. The achievement that enhanced broad spectrum light-activated molecular oxygen activation could be ascribed to the faster electron transfer confirmed by the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra, photoluminescence (PL) spectra, photoelectrochemical test, and quantitative analysis of O-center dot(2)-. The strong interface effect of the Bi2O4/BiO2-x composite was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. Density functional theory calculated results suggested that the Bi2O4/BiO2-x composite revealed increased density of states near the Fermi level, suggesting that it possessed higher carrier mobility as compared to Bi2O4 and BiO2-x, contributing to the faster separation of photoinduced carriers and the generation of O-center dot(2)-. Benefiting to the heterojunction, the Bi2O4/BiO2-x composite showed improved photocatalytic activity and anti-photocorrosion activity during rhodamine B (RhB) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) degradation with the irradiation of UV, visible, and NIR lights. Besides, the possible photocatalytic mechanism and transformation pathway of RhB and CIP degradation by the Bi2O4/BiO2-x composite were proposed by the analyses of the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. This study furnishes a new strategy for fabricating high-efficient and broad spectrum light-driven heterojunction photocatalysts for environment purification.									90	5	0	0	19	0	92			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000459642200045	30675792

The synthesis of nanostructures was carried out on silicon substrates with thin tin film as a catalyst. The evolution in the morphology of the obtained structures was investigated while changing the substrate temperature in the range 200-415 degrees C. Dense array of aligned nanowire bundles (microropes) is formed at a temperatures of 335 and 415 degrees C. With decrease in the temperature to 270 and 245 degrees C arrays of microropes transform into cocoon-like structures of nanowires. At a temperature 200 degrees C, array formed almost entirely consisting of cocoon-like structures. The results of X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) of the nanowires show that the ratio of oxygen to silicon is on average Si: O = 1: 2.4. At the same time, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis of the obtained nanostructures showed that the synthesized nanowires consist of SiOx with x around 2. Moreover, the composition of the structures remains practically unchanged with the variation of the substrate temperature. The IR spectra show bands due to both Si-OH bonds and water molecules. Measurements of contact angles for water showed that the nanowire film surface synthesized in this work is hydrophilic in nature. When structuring involves the oriented growth microropes, the contact angle is about 20-358. Decreasing of the substrate temperature and formation of cocoon-like structures leads to a decrease in the contact angle to 4-128. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of nanostructures synthesized at the different substrate temperatures consist of a broad band with a maximum around 2.5 eV when using laser at 325nmas the exciting source. We assume that the composition of the nanowires is close to SiO2, and the excess of oxygen in structures composition is due to the influence of adsorbed water molecules and hydroxyl groups with the formation of Si-OH bonds. Apparently, these bonds define the photoluminescence spectrum. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

J	Pena, Janeth J.; Adema, Coen M.								The Planorbid Snail Biomphalaria glabrata Expresses a Hemocyanin-Like Sequence in the Albumen Gland								PLOS ONE				11	12					e0168665	10.1371/journal.pone.0168665				DEC 30 2016	2016	The parasitic flatworm Schistosoma mansoni, causative agent of human intestinal schistosomiasis in South America, relies importantly on the freshwater snail Biomphalaria glabrata as intermediate host to achieve development of cercariae that infect humans. The recommendation from the World Health Organization (WHO) to integrate snail control in efforts to counter schistosomiasis transmission provides impetus for in depth study of B. glabrata biology. Our analysis indicates that two distinct hemocyanin-like genes (hcl-1 and hcl-2 are present in B. glabrata, a snail that uses hemoglobin for oxygen transport. Characterization of BAC clones yielded the full length hcl-1 gene, which is comprised of three functional unit (FU) domains at the amino acid level. Database searches and in silico analyses identified the second hdgene (hcl-2), composed of six FU domains. Both genes are unusual for lacking canonical residues and having fewer FU domains than typical molluscan hemocyanins that contain 7-8 FUs. Reverse transcription PCR demonstrated that Hcl-1 is expressed in a manner that correlates with reproductive maturity in the albumen gland (AG), an immune- and reproduction-relevant organ. Immune cross-reactivity with anti-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (alpha-KLH) antiserum and tandem-mass spectrometry validated the presence of Hcl-1 protein in the AG and egg mass fluid (EMF). The evolutionary conservation of hemocyanin-like sequences in B. glabrata in the presence of the oxygen carrier hemoglobin, combined with our results, suggest that the Hcl-1protein has a functional role in general and/or reproductive biology. Further investigations are needed to explore Hcl-1 as a potential target for snail control.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			1932-6203			WOS:000391229300019	28036345

This review highlights some findings of our investigations in the last few years in developing advanced approaches to nanostructured catalysts that address this challenge. Emphasis is placed on nanoengineering-based fabrication, processing, and characterization of multimetallic nanoparticles with controllable size (1-10 nm), shape, composition (e.g. M1(n)M2(100-n), M1(n)M2(m)M3(100- n-m), M1@M2, where M (1 or 2) = Pt, Co, Ni, V, Fe, Cu, Pd, W, Ag, Au etc) and morphology (e.g. alloy, core@shell etc). In addition to an overview of the fundamental issues and the recent progress in fuel cell catalysts, results from evaluations of the electrocatalytic performance of nanoengineered catalysts in fuel cell reactions are discussed. This approach differs from other traditional approaches to the preparation of supported catalysts in the ability to control the particle size, composition, phase, and surface properties. An understanding of how the nanoscale properties of the multimetallic nanoparticles differ from their bulk-scale counterparts, and how the interaction between the nanoparticles and the support materials relates to the size sintering or evolution in the thermal activation process, is also discussed. The fact that the bimetallic gold-platinum nanoparticle system displays a single-phase character different from the miscibility gap known for its bulk-scale counterpart serves as an important indication of the nanoscale manipulation of the structural properties, which is useful for refining the design and preparation of the bimetallic catalysts. The insight gained from probing how nanoparticle-nanoparticle and nanoparticle-substrate interactions relate to the size evolution in the activation process of nanoparticles on planar substrates serves as an important guiding principle in the control of nanoparticle sintering on different support materials. The fact that some of the trimetallic nanoparticle catalysts (e.g. PtVFe or PtNiFe) exhibit electrocatalytic activities in fuel cell reactions which are four-five times higher than in pure Pt catalysts constitutes the basis for further exploration of a variety of multimetallic combinations. The fundamental insights into the control of nanoscale alloy, composition, and core-shell structures have important implications in identifying nanostructured fuel cell catalysts with an optimized balance of catalytic activity and stability.									169	3	0	0	10	0	172			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000273553300001	20065536

J	Duan, Liyuan; Li, Guoqiang; Zhang, Shuting; Wang, Hongyu; Zhao, Yongle; Zhang, Yongfa								Sulfur-doped photocatalysts with iron-nitrogen coordination bonds by modifying graphitic carbon nitride obtained from ammonium thiocyanate pyrolysis with ferrous sulfate heptahydrate in ethanol								OPTICAL MATERIALS				118						111222	10.1016/j.optmat.2021.111222		JUN 2021		AUG 2021	2021	The photocatalytic agent graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was synthesized by pyrolysis of ammonium thiocyanate (NH4SCN) which is commonly produced via extraction of desulfurization waste liquids as the main salt. The g-C3N4 photocatalyst was modified by treatment with different amounts of ferrous sulfate heptahydrate in ethanol, which resulted in Fe-doping and a certain degree of S-doping of the material. According to the characterization results, the modified sample eg-C3N4/FeSO4-10% with superior photocatalytic efficiency exhibited the highest specific surface area and pore volume, poor crystallinity, and a good sample polymerization degree. The existence of more C defect vacancies in the modified sample structure increased the electron density around C and N atoms in the triazine ring structure and becomes the electron capture center. At the same time, the presence of ethanol solvent promotes the formation of more Fe-N coordination bonds between a large number of lone pair electrons and metal Fe ions. In addition, with the increase of the doping amount of S element, a new impurity level is introduced, and the band gap widths of the samples become narrower. The changes of surface structure and energy band structure of the modified samples led to a significantly reduced carrier recombination rate and further promoted the production of more reactive oxygen groups. In the process of Rhodamine B (RhB) degradation as organic pollutant, the degradation can reach 98% rapidly after 60 min of visible light irradiation, which is 78% higher than g-C3N4, at a simultaneous increase of the photocatalytic reaction rate constant from 0.007 to 0.305 per min. Meanwhile, the sample eg-C3N4/FeSO4-10% also showed excellent photocatalytic activity in the NOx removal process of air pollution. Compared with the original g-C3N4, the NO removal rate increased from 64% to 75%, and the production amount of harmful intermediate NO2 decreased from 0.15 to 0.08 mg/m3.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0925-3467	1873-1252		WOS:000674489900002

We describe the amplification of ee in the asymmetric autocatalysis of 5-pyrimidyl alkanols in the reaction between diisopropylzinc (i-Pr2Zn) and pyrimidine-5-carbaldehydes. During the reaction, an extremely low ee (ca. 0.00005% ee) can be amplified to >99.5% ee, and therefore, the initial slightly major enantiomer is automultiplied by a factor of ca. 630000, while the initial slightly minor enantiomer is automultiplied by a factor of less than 1000. In addition, pyrimidyl alkanols with various substituents at the 2-position of the pyrimidine ring, 3-quinolyl alkanol, 5-carbamoyl-3-pyridyl alkanol, and large multifunctionalized pyrimidyl alkanols also act as highly efficient asymmetric autocatalysts in the addition of i-Pr2Zn to the corresponding aldehydes.The asymmetric autocatalysis of pyrimidyl alkanol can discriminate the chirality of various compounds. Chiral substances such as alcohols, amino acids, hydrocarbons, metal complexes, and heterogeneous chiral materials can act as chiral triggers for asymmetric autocatalysis to afford pyrimidyl alkanols with the corresponding absolute configuration of the initiator. This recognition ability of chiral compounds is extremely high, and chiral discrimination of a cryptochiral quaternary saturated hydrocarbon was established by applying asymmetric autocatalysis.By using the large amplification effect of the asymmetric autocatalysis, we can link various proposed origins of chirality with highly enantioenriched organic compounds in conjunction with asymmetric autocatalysis. Thus, a statistical fluctuation in ee of racemic compounds can be amplified to high ee by using asymmetric autocatalysis. Enantiomeric imbalance induced by irradiation of circularly polarized light can affect the enantioselectivity of asymmetric autocatalysis. The asymmetric autocatalysis was also triggered by the morphology of inorganic chiral crystals such as quartz, sodium chlorate, and cinnabar. Chiral organic crystals of achiral compounds also act as chiral initiators, and during the study of a crystal of cytosine, enantioselective chiral crystal phase transformation of the cytosine crystal was achieved by removal of the water of crystallization in an achiral monohydrate crystal. Enantioselective C-C bond formation was realized on the surfaces of achiral single crystals based on the oriented prochirality of achiral aldehydes. Furthermore, asymmetric autocatalysis of pyrimidyl alkanols is a highly sensitive reaction that can recognize and amplify the significantly small effect of a chiral compound arising solely from isotope substitution of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen (D/H, (CC)-C-13-C-12, and O-18/O-16). These examples show that asymmetric autocatalysis with an amplification of chirality is a powerful tool for correlating the origin of chirality with highly enantioenriched organic compounds. Asymmetric autocatalysis using two b-amino alcohols reveals a reversal of enantioselectivity in the addition of i-Pr2Zn to aldehyde and is one approach toward understanding the mechanism of asymmetric dialkylzinc addition, where heteroaggregates act as the catalytic species.									123	3	1	0	21	0	126			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000346683200024	25511374

In this work, a simple hydrothermal method was used to prepare a MoSx/CeVO4 composite. The rose-like MoSx has a layered structure that exposes more active sites, which effectively improves the photocatalytic performance of the composite material. MoSx was successfully grown on the surface of irregular bulk CeVO4 by a hydrothermal method, and the optimal hydrogen production reached 295.24 mu mol in 5 h. The main reason for the improved hydrogen production performance is that the direct Z-scheme heterojunction constructed between the two semiconductors inhibits the recombination of electron-hole pairs in MoSx/CeVO4. Photoelectrochemical experiments and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were used to roughly determine the direction of electron transfer between MoSx and CeVO4, and further proved that the construction of a direct Z-scheme heterojunction promotes the separation of electron-hole pairs and can effectively improve the performance of hydrogen production. In addition, photoluminescence spectra further proved that the recombination of electron-hole pairs inside the composite material is effectively suppressed. The preparation of MoSx/CeVO4 has injected new vitality into the production of new energy in the future.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000661180900001
