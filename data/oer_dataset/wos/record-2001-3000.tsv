Adding nano-scale catalysts, i.e. La0.6Sr0.4CO0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCoF) on air side and Ce0.8Sm0.20O1.9-delta/Ni (SDC/Ni) on CH4 side, into the porous LSCrF-YSZ layers yielded substantially reduced interfacial polarization resistances, and thereby allowed for high oxygen permeability at reduced temperatures under the air/CH4 gradient, e.g., 1.1 and 4.3 ml cm(-2) min(-1) at 650 and 800 degrees C, respectively. Analysis of the impedance spectra suggest that the oxygen reduction kinetics on air side was probably limited by charge transfer reaction at T >= 750 degrees C and surface oxygen exchange at T <= 700 degrees C. Meanwhile, oxygen evolution reactions on CH4 side dominated the total resistances to oxygen permeation through the tri-layered OTMs. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The proposed strategy to overcome this is to replace OER with other kinetically favorable anodic reactions like urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Herein, we develop an organometallic synthesis of nickel nitride nanoparticles supported on carbon (Ni3N-C) as the catalyst for both UOR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A precious group metal-free electrolyzer based on Ni3N-C catalyst (as both anode and cathode) is implemented for the first time, and the urea electrolyzer cell has a 200 mV lower overpotential compared to that of the water electrolyzer.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2574-0962			WOS:000745851300001

The rate of oxygen evolution depends on potential, temperature and alloying additives. In this investigation, the influence of Ag as alloying additive on the oxygen evolution reaction is studied using linear sweep voltammetry. Based on Tafel and Arrhenius plots, the influence of Ag on the oxygen overvoltage and on the activation energy of the process is determined. It was found that Ag from the metal surface is oxidized and Ag ions are incorporated into the PbO2 layer where they decrease both the activation energy and the oxygen overvoltage of the process. Ag also changes the alpha/beta-PbO2 ratio and the structure of the PbO2 layer. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

Of particular interest, there has been growing research concerning the doping of two-dimensional transition-metal compounds (TMCs) to optimize their electrocatalytic performance. Despite the previous achievements, mechanistic insights of doping regulation in TMCs for electrocatalysis are still lacking. Herein, we provide a systematic overview of doping regulation in TMCs in terms of background, preparation, impacts on physicochemical properties, and typical applications including the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, CO2 reduction reaction, and N-2 reduction reaction. Notably, we bridge the understanding between the doping regulation of catalysts and their catalytic activities via focusing on the physicochemical properties of catalysts from the aspects of vacancy concentrations, phase transformation, surface wettability, electrical conductivity, electronic band structure, local charge distribution, tunable adsorption strength, and multiple adsorption configurations. We also discuss the existing challenges and future perspectives in this promising field.									70	1	0	0	3	0	70			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000678760800001	34308950

However, in sea water electrolysis toxic chlorine evolution is the preferred reaction over oxygen evolution at the anode. In this work, research has been focused on the development of electrode materials with a high selectivity for oxygen evolution over chlorine evolution. Selective oxidation in sea water electrolysis has been demonstrated by using a cation-selective polymer. We have used a perm-selective membrane (Naflon (R)), which electrostatically repels chloride ions (Cl-) to the electrode surface and thereby enhances oxygen evolution at the anode. The efficiency and behaviour of the electrode have been characterized by means of anode current efficiency and polarization studies. The surface morphology of the electrode has been characterized by using a scanning electron microscope (SEMI). The results suggest that nearly 100% oxygen evolution efficiency could be achieved when using an IrO2/Ti electrode surface-modified by a perm-selective polymer. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding the oxygen evolution and reduction reactions on carbon-based nanomaterials is of critical importance for development of highly active metal-free electrocatalysts. Here, the adsorption of oxygenated intermediates during oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was examined by ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results demonstrate that the carbon atoms on CNTs near the C=0 functional groups are active for OER. On the basis of this result, we further revealed the origin of the enhanced intermediate adsorption on surface-oxidized CNTs and the relationship between surface groups and apparent activation energy. Our study gained new understanding of OER on oxygen-doped carbon nanomaterials and provided an effective approach for investigating electrocatalysis on heteroatom-doped carbon electrocatalysts.									103	3	0	0	2	0	103			2380-8195			WOS:000394080000002

The relationship between thermoelectric properties including electrical resistivity, excess oxygen doping and decomposition of CuAlO2 was discussed. The reaction process of CuAlO2 compact during the annealing mainly included excess oxygen doping, decomposition of CuAlO2 into CuAl2O4 and CuO and complete decomposition of CuAlO2 as following evolution: CuAlO2 -> CuAlO2+x -> CuAlO2+CuO+CuAl2O4 -> CuAl2O4+CuO. Electrical resistivity of the CuAlO2 compact was decreased with the excess oxygen doping, but turned to increase when CuO and CuAl2O4 were formed. Thermoelectric performance of the CuAlO2 compact was improved due to the excess oxygen doping.					8th International Forum on Advanced Materials Science and Technology (IFAMST-8)8th International Forum on Advanced Materials Science and Technology (IFAMST-8)	AUG 01-04, 2012AUG 01-04, 2012	Saitama Inst Technol; Chinese Mat Res Soc Japan; Chinese Acad & Profess Assoc JapanSaitama Inst Technol; Chinese Mat Res Soc Japan; Chinese Acad & Profess Assoc Japan	Fukuoka Inst Technol, Fukuoka City, JAPANFukuoka Inst Technol, Fukuoka City, JAPAN	11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0255-5476		*****************	WOS:000319235900032

To improve the performance of polyoxometalate-based electrocatalyst in the hydrogen evolution reaction, one O(2- )in polyoxometalate is replaced by S2-.( )This weakens the binding of polyoxometalate to H*, facilitates its desorption, and improves the H-2 generation property. Vulcanized polyoxometalate only requires 55 mV to achieve 10 mA.cm(-2). current in the hydrogen evolution reaction. This electrocatalyst also exhibits promising performance in phenol degradation reaction, which is an ideal substitute for high-energy-consuming oxygen evolution reaction in H-2 production due to low voltage to drive. To acquire 100 and 200 mA.cm(-2) in the phenol degradation reaction, this vulcanized polyoxometalate only consumes 1.38 and 1.41 V. With this electrocatalyst working as a cathode and an anode simultaneously, an electrolyzer is constructed by employing phenol-containing KOH as an electrolyte. To obtain 100 and 200 mA.cm(-2) current, the electrolyzer only requires 1.54 and 1.57 V. Because energy-efficient phenol degradation reaction occurs, these values are obviously lower than the oxygen evolution reaction involved in the overall water-splitting H-2 production. This work provides a universal method to enhance the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of polyoxometalates. Furthermore, a new method is explored, which achieves energy conservation and phenol degradation simultaneously in H-2 production.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000596876400016	33201666

J	Pavlov, D; Monahov, B					Pavlov, Detchko/0000-0002-4104-2149			Mechanism of the elementary electrochemical processes taking place during oxygen evolution on the lead dioxide electrode								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				143	11			3616	3629		10.1149/1.1837261				NOV 1996	1996	When a Pb/PbO2 electrode immersed in H2SO4 solution is subjected to polarization in the lead dioxide potential region (phi >1.0 V vs. Hg/Hg2SO4 reference electrode), H2O is decomposed releasing oxygen. The aim of this investigation is to elucidate the mechanism of the reactions taking place on oxygen evolution. Linear-sweep-voltametric cycling according to various cycling programs has been performed, and the structure of the anodic layer has been examined through scanning electron micrscopy and x-ray diffraction. It has been established that at potentials in the region 1.0 <psi >1.3 V the electrode has passive behavior (i.e., only a weak current passes through it), and in the range 1.3 <phi <1.6 V extensive oxygen evolution is observed (active potential zone). This oxygen evolution is a result of two consecutive electrochemical reactions. While the first reaction proceeds at phi >1.0 V and leads to the formation of OH radicals, the second takes place at phi >1.3 V. It is assumed that these reactions proceed in the hydrated PbO(OH)(2) layer of the lead dioxide. Both reactions are localized in a certain number of active centers in the hydrated PbO(OH)(2) layer. At phi <1.3 V, the products of the first electrochemical reaction block these active centers and hence the current decreases significantly. At phi >1.3 V, the second electrochemical reaction proceeds, as a result of which oxygen is evolved due to oxidation of the OH radicals and consequent unblocking of the active centers. The electrode is activated, and the reaction resistance is the dominant rate-limiting factor. The present contribution proposes a mechanism of the elementary processes that occur on oxygen evolution in light of the gel-crystal structure of the PbO2 layer. This mechanism involves the hydrated polymer chains in the gel layer.									105	8	0	0	8	1	108			0013-4651			WOS:A1996VU82100040

However, the sluggish kinetics of these two reactions and their dependency on expensive noble metal catalysts (e.g, Pt or Ir) prohibit the sustainable commercialization of these highly innovative and in-demand technologies. Bifunctional perovskite oxides have emerged as a new class of highly efficient non-precious metal catalysts (NPMC) for oxygen electrocatalysis in alkaline media. In this review, we discuss the state-of-the-art understanding of bifunctional properties of perovskites with regards to their OER/ORR activity in alkaline media and review the associated reaction mechanisms on the oxides surface and the related activity descriptors developed in the recent literature. We also summarize the present strategies to modify their electronic structure and to further improve their performance for the ORR/OER through highlighting the new concepts relating to the role of surface redox chemistry and oxygen deficiency of perovskite oxides for the ORR/OER activity. In addition, we provide a brief account of recently developed advanced perovskite-nanocarbon hybrid bifunctional catalysts with much improved performances.									162	7	0	0	7	0	162			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000369063800001	26247625

Initially, a carbon slurry has been prepared using glucose and urea via heating at 140 degrees C for 6 h. During the preparation of carbon slurry Ru3+ salt has been added to disperse homogeneously. Finally, calcination at 500 degrees C for 10 h has been performed using homogeneously distributed Ru3+ ion in carbon slurry to get RuO2NR. The synthesized RuO2NR has been well characterized using FESEM, TEM, PXRD, and XPS analysis. The average aspect ratio of a single RuO2 rod is similar to 4.37. The synthesized RuO2NR has been used extensively as an electrocatalyst for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction. RuO2NR shows cathodic potential of -130 mV vs. RHE to achieve current density of 10 mA/cm(2) during hydrogen evolution reaction. Whereas, for oxygen evolution 1.508 V vs. RHE is required to generate 10 mA/cm(2) current density. Electrochemically active surface area and Tafel slope have been calculated to exhibit better activity of RuO2NR as compared to commercial RuO2. The overall electrocatalysis mechanism has also been discussed in detail.									23	2	0	0	0	0	23			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000451048400019

This hybrid delivers superior catalytic performances for hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions and overall water splitting: it shows an ultra-small Tafel slope of 28.56 mV dec(-1) for hydrogen evolution in acid, and a small Tafel slope of 42.77 mV dec(-1) for the oxygen evolution reaction; particularly, in a two-electrode setup for water splitting, it requires an ultra-small potential of 1.59 V to obtain 10 mA cm(-2) with nearly 100% faradaic efficiencies for H-2 and O-2.

The electrocatalyst is characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis. SEM analysis demonstrates notable morphology viz. nanopetals of the Mn-Fe oxide grown on carbon paper. The electrocatalytic activity is checked for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium. Rotating disk electrode (RDE) voltammetry is carried out to study the ORR kinetics, which proves that ORR process follows four-electron pathway in alkaline medium. Oxygen evolution reaction study reveals that it has higher activity for OER with a lower onset potential of 1.6 V vs RHE and higher current density of 11.5 mA/cm(2) at 2.0 V vs RHE reference electrode.

It is attractive because replacing noble metal-based materials is a key issue in current catalysis research. By using H-2 plasma treatment, the TiO2/nickel foam composite is converted to be an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst toward both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the alkaline electrolyte. The investigation reveals the existence of abundant oxygen vacancies of TiO2, which might lead to the dramatic improvement of electrical conductivity and faster charge transfer rate; also, density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the oxygen vacancies activate surrounding surface lattice oxygen to induce favorable reactive-intermediate adsorption energy of TiO2 for hydrogen evolution and adjust the strength of the chemical bonds between the TiO2 surface and reactive intermediates to more favorable values, inducing a lower energy barrier for oxygen evolution. The finding confers a unique function to TiO2 that is different from its widely accepted role as an electrocatalytically inert semiconductor material, suggesting the H-2 plasma treated TiO2/nickel foam could be a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting.									30	0	0	0	1	0	29			2168-0485			WOS:000455288800093

Iron-cobalt oxide ((Co, Fe)(3)O-4) is one of the most promising transition metal-based OER electrocatalysts under alkaline conditions, but its activity is unsatisfactory due to its limited active sites and poor electronic conductivity. Herein, self-supported (Co, Fe)(3)O-4 hierarchical nanosheet arrays with massive oxygen vacancies (denoted as V-O-(Co, Fe)(3)O-4/CC) are synthesized by a simple reduction method at room temperature. Oxygen vacancies can regulate the ratio of Co2+/Co3+, which leads to the modification of its electronic properties, and it also significantly improves the charge transfer ability and accelerates the reaction. Meanwhile, the unique hierarchical nanosheet arrays structure and abundant oxygen vacancies effectively adjust the number of OER active sites, which has a key role in developing a cost-effective oxygen electrode. Accordingly, V-O-(Co, Fe)(3)O-4/CC exhibits a relatively low overpotential of 286 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 41 mV dec(-1).									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000564391700002

In this study, nitrogen atoms are used to precisely modulate electrochemical active sites on the surface of nickel oxide with low-coordinated oxygen atoms, to achieve enhanced kinetics in alkaline hydrogen evolution. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that surface charge redistribution after modulation facilitates both the initial water dissociation step and the subsequent recombination of H-ad from low-coordinated oxygen sites and desorption of OHad- from nickel sites, thus accelerating the overall hydrogen evolution process. The N-modulated nickel oxide enriched in low-coordinated oxygen atoms exhibits significantly enhanced activity with a small overpotential of -100 mV at the current density of -10 mA cm(-2) and a robust stability over 90 h for hydrogen evolution in 1.0 m KOH.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000428315300003	29345435

The stability of pristine MoS2 basal plane against oxidation under ambient conditions is a widely accepted assumption however, here we report single-atom-level structural investigations that reveal that oxygen atoms spontaneously incorporate into the basal plane of MoS2 single layers during ambient exposure. The use of scanning tunnelling microscopy reveals a slow oxygen-substitution reaction, during which individual sulfur atoms are replaced one by one by oxygen, giving rise to solid-solution-type 2D MoS2-xOx crystals. Oxygen substitution sites present all over the basal plane act as single-atom reaction centres, substantially increasing the catalytic activity of the entire MoS2 basal plane for the electrochemical H-2 evolution reaction.									200	9	0	0	12	0	200			1755-4330	1755-4349		WOS:000450790300014	30224684

Here, amorphous cobalt hydroxide nanocages are demonstrated to be a promising electrocatalyst with an overpotential of 0.28 V at 10 mA cm(-2), far outperforming the crystalline counterparts and being in the top rank of the catalysts of their kind, under the condition of electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction. From the direct experimental in situ and ex situ results, this enhanced activity is attributed to its high structural flexibility in terms of 1) facile and holistic transformation into catalytic active phase; 2) hosting oxygen vacancies; and 3) structure self-regulation in a real-time process. Significantly, based on plausible catalytic mechanism and computational simulation results, it is disclosed how this structural flexibility facilitates the kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction. This work deepens the understanding of the structure-activity relationship of the Co-based catalysts in electrochemical catalysis, and it inspires more applications that require flexible structures enabled by such amorphous nanomaterials.									90	6	0	0	1	0	90			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000430922100005	29611337

The nitrogen doped carbon materials with low cost and long durability are potential catalysts to replace precious metal catalyst for oxygen electrochemistry; however, the unexposed active sites induced by the bulk dopant atoms are hardly accessible and consequently scarcely contribute to the catalytic property. In this study, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are selected as the platform to demonstrate the potential of full exposure of `active sites' at the surface. Novel N-doped carbon coaxial nanocables with the pristine CNTs as the core and the N-doped carbon layers as the shell are proposed. The accessible and efficient utilization of the integrated nitrogen atoms enriched on the surface, together with the undestroyed intact inner walls, render the electrocatalyst much enhanced electrocatalytic activity and high electrical conductivity of 3.3 S cm-1, therefore, N-doped nanocables afford higher oxygen reduction current, ~51 mV positively shift onset potential, low peroxide generation, as well as lower overpotential and higher current for oxygen evoluation reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1616-301X			INSPEC:15067366

Herein we report a new method that improves the oxygen evolution activity by integration of active nickel oxide clusters using amino acids, meaning that the amount of electrodeposited nickel oxides is increasing with maintaining the catalytic activity. This method enhances the catalytic activity because the reaction sites drastically increase in three dimensions. The detailed reaction mechanism was investigated using operando UV/vis absorption and Ni K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopic techniques, which suggested that amino acids such as glycine, alanine, and glutamine promoted the electrodeposition of NiO6 octahedral structure clusters. Meanwhile, the analysis of N and O K-edge X-ray absorption spectra showed that the amino acid (glycine) in the nickel electrocatalyst was. resent in the molecular state. Therefore, it was spectroscopically demonstrated that amino adds are bound to nickel oxide clusters accompanied by oxygen evolution activity.									14	0	0	0	3	0	14			1932-7447			WOS:000392035500027

To consolidate the understanding on electrocatalysis by spinel family, intermediate spinels should be deliberately examined because most spinel oxides are of intermediate structure. Here, we report an investigation on the ORR and OER performance of intermediate spinel MnFe2O4. The modulation of cation oxidation state and inversion degree of spinel MnFe2O4 were achieved by a simple annealing process. X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis reveals that the Mn occupancy in octahedral sites varied from 0.25 similar to 0.41 and Mn cations were oxidized from 2+ to 3+ with increasing temperature treatment. Convinced by the leading role of octahedral-geometric, we further reveal the role of Mn oxidation state through normalizing the activity to active Mn-[Oh] site number. Our findings clearly indicate that Mn3+ was more catalytically active than Mn2+ in catalyzing ORR and OER.									23	0	0	0	2	0	23			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000429123900002

Herein, we report a new oxygen evolution reaction mechanism originating from oxygen vacancies, which remarkably enhances the OER activity of oxygen deficient electrocatalysts. The OER activity of Sr2VFeAsO3- is drastically enhanced above the lattice oxygen vacancy of = 0.5, exhibiting approximate to 300 mV lower overpotential and 80 times higher specific activity at 1.7 V vs. RHE. Surprisingly, the initially low OER activity of Sr2VFeAsO3- ( < 0.5) is enhanced to the level of state-of-the-art OER catalysts simply by introducing higher concentrations of oxygen vacancies. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations clarify that the oxygen vacancies are initially dominated by one of the crystallographic sites, while two types of crystallographic sites become fully accessible for > 0.5. As a result, the distance between OH- coupled oxygen-vacant sites becomes sufficiently short to enable direct O-O bond formation as in photosystem II. Thus, we found that the OER activity of oxygen deficient electrocatalysts is controllable by the variety of lattice oxygen vacancies, which suggests that oxygen deficient layered superconductors are promising OER catalysts for energy conversion technologies.									42	3	0	0	0	0	42			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000443118300008

However, their scarcity and high price have severely hampered their large-scale commercial applications. In this work, with the aid of density functional theory calculations we systematically screened 26 types of transition metal atom embedded gamma-graphyne monolayer (TM-GY) as potential effective and cheap single functional and bifunctional single-atom catalysts (SACs) for ORR/OER. The catalytic activity of ORR/OER can be expressed by a single descriptor of the adsorption free energy of the OH intermediate. Our research shows that Fe, Ir, Co, Rh, Cu, Ni, Pd and Pt-GY are potential single-functional and bifunctional SACs candidates for ORR or/and OER. Specifically, Co-GY was found to be the optimal bifunctional SAC for ORR and OER. A three-step strategy for screening bifunctional SACs was put forward: (i) non-radioactive/toxic element, (ii) single-function SACs and (iii) bifunctional SACs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000861104500003

The cathode electrocatalysts often suffer from undesirable oxidation due to the oxygen gas crossover through the porous separator during electrolysis. This leads to oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the cathode electrocatalysts, resulting in the loss of activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we report a highly efficient and durable HER and ORR bifunctional electrocatalyst derived from Ni metalorganic frameworks to address the above problem. Decoupled active sites for ORR and HER are induced in a hybrid material, NiFeP@Ni_NC, where an ORR catalytic N-doped nanocarbon layer can protect a HER catalytic Ni delta+ from the undesired ORR. Therefore, excellent bifunctional stability is secured for NiFeP@Ni_NC. The strategy to enhance HER stability presented herein can be widely extended to design bifunctional electrocatalysts with improved stability in alkaline electrolysis.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000697032900005

The fabrication process of this electrode involved assembling the gold nanoparticles atop of amino group grafted glassy carbon electrode. The scanning electron microscopy indicated the deposition of gold nanoparticles in flower-shaped nanostructures with an average particle size of ca. 150 nm. Interestingly, the electrode exhibited outstanding enhancement in the electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction, which reflected from the large negative shift (ca. 0.8 V) in its onset potential, in comparison with that observed at the bulk unmodified glassy carbon and gold electrodes. Alternatively, the Tafel plot of the modified electrode revealed a significant increase (similar to one order of magnitude) in the apparent exchange current density of the oxygen evolution reaction upon the modification, which infers a faster charge transfer. Kinetically, gold nanoparticles are believed to facilitate a favorable adsorption of OH- (fundamental step in oxygen evolution reaction), which allows the charge transfer at reasonably lower anodic polarizations.

As parts of the effort to elucidate the reaction mechanisms, we report the influence of the cationic species on the ORR/OER activity of select transition metal oxide catalysts in alkaline solutions. Specifically, we use Li+, Na+, and K+-containing electrolytes to assess the role of the cation on the ORR activity of Pt nanoparticles and LaMnO3+delta, as well as the OER activity of rutile IrO2 and Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta. We found that all these benchmark electrocatalysts share the same cation trends, where the presence of the smaller cation (Li+) always leads to lower activity. We argue that this finding represents the possible cation influence on the ORR/OER intermediate stabilization.									92	4	0	0	6	0	94			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000315467100007

However, Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the negative half-cell causes a harmful influence on the performance of the VRFB by consuming current. Moreover, HER hinders V2+/V3+ redox reaction between electrode and electrolyte by forming a bubble. To address the HER problem, carbon nanotube/graphite felt electrode (CNT/GF) with oxygen functional groups was synthesized through the hydrothermal method in the H2SO4 + HNO3 (3:1) mixed acid solution. These oxygen functional groups on the CNT/GF succeed in suppressing the HER and improving charge transfer for V2+/V3+ redox reaction. As a result, the oxygen functional group applied electrode exhibited a low overpotential of 0.395 V for V2+/V3+ redox reaction. Hence, this work could offer a new strategy to design and synthesize effective electrodes for HER suppression and improving the energy density of VRFB.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1225-8024			KJD:ART002746660

New energy conversion schemes based on small molecule activation reactions, including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), have been proposed. For example, catalytic water splitting provides a promising way to convert solar energy to chemical energy, which is stored as the hydrogen fuel. Hydrogen oxidation in fuel cells is an energy-releasing process to generate electric energy and water as the only product. Although such a hydrogen-based new energy scheme is appealing, its viability is dependent on highly efficient and robust catalysts for these small molecule activation reactions. Recently, a variety of metal corroles have been demonstrated to be efficient in catalyzing HER, OER, and ORR The redoxactive trianionic corrole ligands can afford a rigid four-coordinated square-planar molecular structure and are very effective in stabilizing high-valent metal centers. These features make metal corroles very attractive to serve as catalysts for these processes. More importantly, the structure of metal corroles can be systematically modified, which provides an ideal system to investigate the structure-reactivity relationship with aims to obtain fundamental knowledge on catalyst design and also catalytic mechanism. In this review, we summarize recently reported metal corrole catalysts for HER, OER, and ORR, as well as pay particular attention to the structure effects on these reactions.									86	6	1	0	10	0	86			2155-5435			WOS:000467335600056

J	Keum, Changjoon; Lee, Sang-Yup								Iridium-Coordinated Histidyl Bolaamphiphile Self-Assemblies as Heterogeneous Catalysts for Water Oxidation								CHEMSUSCHEM				11	15			2569	2578		10.1002/cssc.201800461				AUG 9 2018	2018	Catalysts that can promote oxygen evolution from water are necessary for green energy production. In this study, colloidal heterogeneous catalysts for oxygen evolution were prepared by coordination of Ir species to self-assemblies of histidyl bolaamphiphiles. When dissolved in water, the histidyl bolaamphiphiles self-assembled to form particulate structures with the exposure of densely packed histidine imidazoles on their surface. Subsequent coordination of the Ir species to the bolaamphiphile assembly gave rise to catalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction. The oxygen evolution was examined by using the catalytic assemblies in the presence of a sacrificial oxidant, cerium ammonium nitrate. The Ir-coordinated assemblies showed a turnover frequency of 13min(-1), which was comparable to those previously reported for molecular water oxidation catalysts. The catalytic activity increased with increasing histidine imidazole/Ir molar ratio, which suggested that multiple coordination of Ir to imidazoles facilitated the formation of active Ir intermediates. This study demonstrates the feasibility of constructing catalytically active interfaces from colloidal bolaamphiphile assemblies with biochemical ligands.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000441237800013	29873890

Herein, Co3O4-CuO/Cu2O/C nanostructure with mixed valence oxides is reported as an efficient bi-functional EC towards oxygen electrode reactions in alkaline medium. The EC displays higher current density of 6.2 mA cm(-2) and mass activity of 12.9 mA mg(-1) compared to that of commercially available Pt/C in 0.1 M KOH solution for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Rotating disk electrode measurements are used to understand the kinetics of the reaction and the EC is durable up to 1000 redox cycles. The material is highly stable up to 7000 s by retaining 99% of its initial current. The fast electron transfer is established by the smaller Tafel slope value of 83.6 mV dec(-1). In addition, the prepared material is also active for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 0.1 M KOH solution. Thus, the nanostructure with different bimetallic active sites is found to be a potential material for oxygen electrocatalysis.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000621173600004

Herein, a nitrogen (N)-containing polymer waste was collected and used to synthesize N-doped bifunctional carbon electrocatalysts (N-BCEs). The results indicated that the N-containing polymer waste from a living environment can be converted to N-BCEs easily. In addition, the surface areas, pore structures and N doping contents of N-BCEs were further optimized by cyanoguanidine. Most importantly, the electrochemical tests demonstrated that the as prepared N-BCEs exhibited comparable ORR and OER activities to the commercial noble-metal Pt-C and IrO2 electrocatalysts in both acidic and alkaline media, indicating that environmentally-unfriendly heteroatom-containing polymer wastes can be utilized to synthesize advanced heteroatom-doped BCEs for ORR and OER in future fuel cells, metal-air batteries and water oxidation.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1452-3981			WOS:000417122400046

Herein, we present a facile method for the synthesis of a low-cost Ni-Fe-Co material that efficiently catalyzes the oxygen evolution reaction. A mixed transition metal electrocatalyst was synthesized using a nickel-plated iron substrate and a low concentration cobalt reagent. The catalyst was able to achieve competitive current densities (>130 mA cm(-2)) and still exhibit a low overpotential of 0.30 V at the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The Ni-Fe-Co catalyst was stable and maintained its activity during 24 h of electrolysis in alkaline media. The catalyst was also stable when maintained in ambient conditions for 90 days. This is the first reported oxygen evolution reaction catalyst that exhibits these competitive characteristics and that was synthesized using an environmentally-conscious, one-step process that can be manufactured on an industrial scale.

J	Chi, Le; Xu, Qian; Liang, Xiaoyu; Wang, Jide; Su, Xintai								Iron-Based Metal-Organic Frameworks as Catalysts for Visible Light-Driven Water Oxidation								SMALL				12	10			1351	1358		10.1002/smll.201503526				MAR 9 2016	2016	The development of earth-abundant, active, and stable catalysts is important for solar energy conversion. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been viewed as a promising class of porous materials, which may have innovative application in photocatalysis. In this paper, three types of Fe-based MOFs and their aminofunctionalized derivatives have been fabricated and systematically studied as water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) for oxygen evolution under visible light irradiation. MIL-101(Fe) possesses a higher current density and earlier onset potential and exhibits excellent visible light-driven oxygen evolution activity than the other Fe-based catalysts. It speeds up the oxygen evolution reaction rate with the higher initial turnover frequencies value of 0.10 s(-1). Our study demonstrates that Fe-based MOFs as efficient WOCs are promising candidates for photocatalytic water oxidation process.									110	8	0	0	13	0	115			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000372008200011	26756919

Herein, we demonstrate NiMn layered double hydroxide nanosheets/NiCo2O4 nanowires hierarchical nanocomposite catalyst with surface rich high valence metal oxide as an efficient catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction. A low overpotential of 310 mV is needed to drive a 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 99 mV dec(-1), and a remarkable stability during 8 h is demonstrated in a chronoamperometry test. Theoretical calculation displays the change in the rate-determining step on the nanocomposite electrode in comparison to NiCo2O4 nanowires alone. It is found high valence Ni and Mn oxide in the catalyst system can efficiently facilitate the charge transport across the electrode/electrolyte interface. The enhanced electrical conductivity, more accessible active sites and synergistic effects between NiMn layered double hydroxide nanosheets and NiCo2O4 nanowires can account for the excellent oxygen evolution reaction. The catalytic performance is comparable to most of the best non-noble catalysts and IrO2 noble catalyst, indicating the promising applications in water-splitting technology. It is an important step in the development of hierarchical nanocomposites by surface valence state tuning as an alternative to noble metals for oxygen evolution reaction.									94	4	0	0	6	0	94			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000435055500004

These reactions are kinetically sluggish, and require catalysts to promote their efficiency. Since their discovery and characterization decades ago, the catalytic properties of metal oxyhydroxides have not been profoundly studied. It was only in recent years when emphasis was placed on them again, mainly as possible OER catalysts. In this work, we wish to delve deeper into several layered first-row transition metal (cobalt, chromium, iron, manganese and nickel) oxyhydroxides, and investigate their inherent electrochemistry and electrocatalytic behaviors for HER and OER, as well as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Characterisation of these materials was performed using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, high resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy prior to electrochemical studies. Among the five layered oxyhydroxides examined, cobalt and nickel oxyhydroxides exhibited better electrocatalytic properties than the other three layered oxyhydroxides mainly in HER and OER.									61	2	0	0	0	0	62			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000355556300032

Herein, we demonstrate that fluorination of ZIF-67 Framework templated Prussian blue analogue hollow nano-box is highly efficient for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The structure and morphology observation shows the degree of structural transformation and morphology are influenced by the fluorination temperature, and the catalytic ability for OER is correspondingly correlated to these characters. The product obtained at the annealed temperature of 250 degrees C exhibits the highest catalytic performance for OER with an overpotential of 243 mV (No IR correction) to offer 10 mA cm(-2) when loaded on the inert glass carbon electrode, which is much better than that of the commercial IrO2 catalysts. High catalytic stability and kinetics are also found for the OER. Moreover, it has the highest intrinsic activity as demonstrated by the specific activity and turnover frequency indicating the intrinsic advantages of fluorination and hollow nano-box structure. This study enriches the application of Prussian blue analogue based hollow materials for OER by facile fluorination at low temperatures.									59	3	0	0	8	0	59			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000579752500093

The internal stresses developing in the anodic oxide film have been followed in situ during anodizing using a high-resolution curvature measurement technique. The observed stress evolution is discussed in relation to the oxygen evolution reaction and other growth instabilities previously reported in the literature. The onset of the oxygen evolution reaction, which significantly reduces the growth efficiency, is observed to induce very large compressive stresses. The latter are likely to result from oxygen evolution inside the oxide film. At some stage during film growth, the growth efficiency is observed to return to its initial high value, and the instantaneous stress in the film changes from compressive to tensile. A tentative explanation is proposed for the observed phenomena, taking into account the kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction inside the film.

Whereas, the kinetic process of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is very sluggish due to the four-electron proton coupling mechanism, which seriously affects the hydrogen production efficiency. The development and use of high-performance oxygen evolution electrocatalysts is an important way to improve the kinetics of OER processes. As an electrocatalyst platform, the hollow structure exhibits unique advantages in assisting the OER process. This review summarizes and discusses the advantages and disadvantages and improvement strategies of hollow structures, construction strategies, types of hollow structures and synthetic methods as well as unique advantages in facilitating the OER process. We focus on the role of hollow materials with different compositions and morphologies in promoting the OER reaction.

The model is used to calculate sensitivity coefficients for various parameters in the model. These calculations show that the discharge voltage of the cell is affected mostly by the kinetics of the nickel reaction. Toward the end of discharge, proton diffusion also becomes important, because the proton diffusion process affects the active material utilization significantly. During charge; the cell voltage is mainly affected by the kinetics of the nickel reaction until the oxygen evolution reaction begins, after which time the kinetics of the oxygen evolution has the largest effect. The oxygen evolution reaction is also the most influencing factor on the actual charge uptake of the cell by the end of a charge operation (charge efficiency). Compared to the rates of reaction and proton diffusion, the ohmic drop in the active material of the nickel electrode and the mass transport and ohmic drop in the electrolyte have negligible effect on the behavior of the cell studied here.									44	1	0	0	0	0	45			0013-4651			WOS:A1995QX76500028

Commercial ruthenium oxide (RuO2) catalyst displays remarkable activities but poor stability for OER. The instability stems from lattice oxygen oxidation, resulting in the oxidation of Ru4+ to soluble Rux+ (x > 4) species. Herein, we redirect dynamic structural evolution of Ru-based catalysts through introducing oxidized nickel (Ni) components. By virtue of comprehensive structural characterizations, such as high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), operando Raman and so forth, it is demonstrated that when the atomic content of Ni exceeds that of ruthenium (Ru), the Ni components can efficiently inhibit the Ru4+ oxidation and structural collapse. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the introduction of Ni component hinders the formation of oxygen vacancies, and makes lattice oxygen mediated mechanism turn to adsorbate evolution mechanism, which eventually improves the stability. The optimized nickel-contained RuO2 catalyst delivers an effective reactivity with an overpotential of less than 215 mV to attain 10 mA cm(-2) and remarkable stability with only 5 mV increment after 5000 potential cycles. This work provides insights into the origin of dynamic structural evolution of transition-metal-modified RuO2 electrocatalysts.

Herein, we report the development of nickel promoted cobalt disulfide nanowire array supported on carbon cloth (Ni-23%-CoS2/CC) as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting with superior activity and good durability in basic media. This Ni-2.3%-CoS2/CC electrode delivers 100 mA cm(-2) at overpotential of 231 mV for HER and 100 mA cm(-2) at overpotential of 370 mV for OER. The water electrolyzer based on Ni-2.3%-CoS2/CC only requires a cell voltage of 1.66 V to afford 10 mA cm(-2), implying the great potential for water splitting applications.

Metal complexes feature designabilityand reaction selectivity. This feature should be appreciated in theapplication as HER cocatalysts by suppressing unfavorable back reactions;however, low stability hampers their application.

NiBHT, a kind of 2D MOF, is deposited on thephotocatalyst SrTiO3:Al with CoOxas an oxygen evolution cocatalyst toshow long-term overall one-step water splitting with an apparent quantumefficiency (AQE) of 6.5% at 350 nm. In comparison to Pt as arepresentative HER cocatalyst, NiBHT turns out to be a suppressor of back reactions related to oxygen reduction reactions, which isproven both experimentally and theoretically.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000784255800015

A flexible electrode, based on carbon cloth substrate and iron phosphide nanotubes coated with an iron oxide/phosphate layer, is shown to catalyze overall water splitting. The as-prepared flexible electrode demonstrates remarkable electrocatalytic activity for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at modest overpotentials. The surface iron oxide/phosphate, which is formed in situ, is proposed to improve the HER activity by facilitating the water-dissociation step and serves directly as the catalytically-active component for the OER process.									206	9	0	0	4	0	207			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000367186000010	26493157

The deposited electrodes are studied for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as bifunctional electrodes for overall water splitting. These electrodes show overpotentials of 300 and 290 mV for OER and HER respectively, at a benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2). In case of OER, the absence of dopamine gives higher overpotential and exfoliation of Co coating. In the presence of dopamine, the electrodes show lower overpotential and better long-term stability for both HER and OER for overall water splitting. Hence, the present Ni-dopamine-Co electrode interface can be a better bifunctional electrode for the overall water splitting reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000700955500001

We demonstrate a nickel-based DPO material, La2FeNiO6 (LFNO), prepared via the sol-gel polymer method and a controlled synthesis approach, and the resultant product displays a reduced nanoparticle size of similar to 41.5 +/- 5 nm and a surface area of 27.52 m(2)g(-1) . The LFNO sample with a well-controlled textural property influences the electrochemical characteristics in all aspects, like OER/ ORR onset and Tafel slope values under 0.1 M KOH. Moreover, the LFNO exhibits exceptional bifunctionality characteristics: an ORR eta value of 518 mV at -3 mA cm(-2) and an OER eta value of 311 mV at 10 mA cm(-2); thus, the LFNO DPOs delivered a bifunctionality index value of similar to.0.82 V. In addition, a long-term stability test of the best LFNO catalyst achieved high retention values of 91.4% (ORR) and 72.2% (OER) after 10 h continuous working operation. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we report the synthesis of sulfur-doped carbon nanofibers (CNF) as support for tantalum oxide nanoparticles. Carbon nanofibers and tantalum oxides represent a durable choice for oxygen electrocatalysis, but an improvement of catalytic activity is required. Upon doping, sulfur is found to be mainly bonded to carbon as C-S-C species (more than 80%). The results show that the effective incorporation of sulfur in the support has a clear positive effect on the electroactivity of the tantalum oxide catalysts. It causes a decrease of OER/ORR overpotential of 80 mV with respect to the undoped counterpart, with special improvement in the ORR. The new catalysts have shown an interesting bifunctional behavior for the OER and ORR, as well as a good stability through time.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000863234100001

However, the role of oxygen species is usuallyomitted. Herein, a facile oxygen engineering strategy is proposed totune the oxygen species in N-doped porous carbon nanofibers(NPCNFs-O) via a facile electrospinning method, in which beta-cyclodextrin acts as the pore inducer and oxygen regulator.Benefitting from the large specific surface area and synergistic effectof N,O codoping, the NPCNF-O catalyst exhibits superior ORR(E1/2= 0.85 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and OER(Ej=10= 1.556 V vs RHE) activities with excellent stability. Bothexperimental and theoretical calculations verify the crucial role ofcarboxyl groups, which regulate the local charge density and reduce the reaction energy barrier for enhancing the oxygenelectrocatalytic activity. Moreover, a rechargeable zinc-air battery using NPCNF-O as the air cathode demonstrates a maximumpower density of 125.1 mW cm-2and long-term durability. Importantly, NPCNF-O can be served as an integrated freestandingelectrode for portable zinc-air batteries.

We substituted Nb into the Mn site of CaMnO3 (CMO) and treated the material with H-2. The as-obtained CaMn0.75Nb0.25O3-delta (H-2-CMNO) displays the same structure as that of CMO, and compared to that of CMO, H-2-CMNO exhibits significantly improved OER performance, including a lower overpotential, a reduced Tafel slope, a higher mass activity, and enhanced stability. In addition, the ORR performance of H-2-CMNO is also greatly enhanced, relative to CMO, with a higher ORR activity and a more efficient electron-transfer pathway. H-2-CMNO shows an even higher activity-per-catalyst cost and superior stability than that of state-of-the-art materials, such as IrO2 and Pt/C. This great enhancement in ORR and OER activity Of H-2-CMNO is attributed to several factors, including phase stabilization, optimized e(g) filling, better OH- adsorption, and improved electrical conductivity.									38	2	0	0	1	0	40			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000413503700033	28948763

Herein, we propose a novel strategy, that is, lattice contraction tailoring to modulate the charge density of active Co atom in LaCoO3 by doping Ce ions into the host lattice. The introduction of Ce can boost the bifunctional oxygen electrode activity (0.81 V) with better durability, surpassing the pure LaCoO3 (1.00 V) catalyst. Due to the improved catalysis performance, the Zn-air battery based on lattice constrain tailoring strategy has demonstrated the 1.2- and 2.0-fold enhancement for current and power densities, respectively. The theoretical calculation reveals that the lattice contraction tailoring in LaCoO3 can effectively increase the electrical conductivity, decrease the reaction free energy and enhance the rate-determining step rate, which causes the accelerated ORR and OER rates. This study provides a novel insight into designing high-performance oxygen electrocatalyst through engineering the crystal parameters of catalysts.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000664133400004

Much research has been devoted to developing efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen production via the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen production via the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The optimum electrocatalysts can drive down the energy costs needed for water splitting via lowering the overpotential. A number of cobalt (Co)-based materials have been developed over past years as non-noble-metal heterogeneous electrocatalysts for HER and OER. Recent progress in this field is summarized here, especially highlighting several important bifunctional catalysts. Various approaches to improve or optimize the electrocatalysts are introduced. Finally, the current existing challenges and the future working directions for enhancing the performance of Co-implicated electrocatalysts are proposed.									1739	92	0	0	58	0	1752			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000367842400001	26551487

By taking inspiration from the catalytic properties of single-atom catalysts and metallo-proteins, we exploit the potential of metal organic networks as electrocatalysts in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A dramatic enhancement of the catalytic activity toward the production of oxygen by nearly 2 orders of magnitude is demonstrated for novel hetero-bimetallic organic catalysts compared to metallo-porphyrins. Using a supramolecular approach we deliberately place single iron and cobalt atoms in either of two different coordination environments and observe a highly nonlinear increase in the catalytic activity depending on the coordination spheres of Fe and Co. Catalysis sets in at about 300 mV overpotential with high turnover frequencies that outperform other metal organic catalysts like the prototypical hangman porphyrins.									180	6	0	0	13	0	181			0002-7863			WOS:000372854200002	26937997

Noble metals are accepted for oxygen electrocatalysis, but their scarcity and poor durability largely inhibit their wide commercial application. Onedimensional (1D) porous carbon-based materials (e.g. carbon-supported transition metals and heteroatom-doped carbon) are the promising alternatives for noble metal-based catalysts, owing to more exposed active sites, high electronic conductivity, and good mechanical strength. However, achieving favorable 1D porous carbon-based materials remains a great challenge. Electrospinning technology accompanied by post-treatments (e.g. preoxidation and annealing) is considered to be a facile and universal strategy for the preparation of porous carbon-based nanofibers. This review focuses on recent progress in designing of porous carbon-based nanofibers via electrospinning technology for oxygen electrocatalysis. A brief introduction of the electrospinning principles is provided and discussed firstly. Then, a classified introduction and discussion of electrospun porous carbon-based nanofibers in terms of preparation and application in oxygen electrocatalysis is highlighted. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives on the synthesis and electrocatalytic applications of electrospun porous carbon-based nanofibers are proposed. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The measured electrochemical surface area values are 23.02 and 22.96 m(2) g(-1) for the Pt black and 80 wt% Pt/SiO2-SO3H catalysts, respectively. The silica support is not prohibiting the electrical conductivity of Pt in the Pt/SiO2-SO3H electrocatalyst due to the high loading of Pt on the supporter. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the fuel cell and water electrolyzer modes were carried out in a unit cell for the Pt/C, Pt/SiO2, and Pt/SiO2-SO3H electrocatalysts. The Pt/SiO2-SO3H catalyst is exhibit better performance in oxygen reduction (hydrogen oxidation) and oxygen evolution (hydrogen evolution) reactions during cyclic processing due to the high proton conductivity of the sulfonated silica supporter. This result means that the sulfonic acid functional group on the support material (SiO2-SO3H) enhances proton conduction in the catalyst layer. Therefore, the ohmic resistance is decrease in the unit cell. Hence, the sulfonated silica supported Pt electrocatalyst is a bifunctional electrocatalyst candidate that can be used in the operation of a URFC. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Herein, single Co atoms and ultra-small CoOx clusters are simultaneously introduced into polymeric perylene diimide (PDI) through a facile impregnation-calcination two-step method. The obtained Co-PDI exhibits excellent photocatalytic water oxidation activity under visible-light irradiation, with an oxygen evolution rate reaching as high as 5.53 mmol h(-1) g(-1) (lambda > 420 nm). The apparent quantum yield for oxygen evolution is determined to be 8.17% at 450 nm, and remains 0.77% at even longer visible light wavelength of 700 nm without redundant co-catalysts, indicating that Co-PDI may serve as an excellent oxygen evolution photocatalyst for water splitting. Theoretical calculations and experimental results demonstrate that single Co atoms act as the electron mediators connecting adjacent PDI layers to build directional channels for rapid charge transfer, while ultra-small CoOx clusters as hole collectors and reaction sites to accelerate oxygen evolution reaction kinetics. The study presents a facile and reliable strategy to effectively activate polymeric semiconductors for efficient photocatalysis by rationally modulating atomic structures and active sites for promoted charge carrier transfer and surface reaction kinetics.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000804476800001

Here, we investigated size dependent HER and OER performance of MoS2. The smallest size (90 nm) of MoS2 exhibits the lowest overpotential of -0.28 V at -10 mAcm(-2) and 1.52 V at 300 mAcm(-2) with the smallest Tafel slopes of 151 and 176 mVdec(-1) for HER and OER, respectively, compared to bigger sizes (2 mu m and 6 mu m) of MoS2. The better HER and OER performance is attributed to high electrochemical active surface area (6 x 10(-4) cm(2)) with edge sites and low charge transfer resistance (18.1 Omega), confirming that the smaller MoS2 nanosheets have the better catalytic behavior.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2093-8551			WOS:000767278200011

We report a CoV2O4 material that shows good activity for the oxygen evolution reaction. However, postmortem characterization of the catalyst material shows dissolution of vanadium resulting in an amorphous CoOx material, suggesting that this vanadium-free material, and not CoV2O4, is the active catalyst.

The vast majority of OER catalyst materials investigated are metal oxides of various compositions. The experimental results obtained on such materials strongly suggest the existence of a fundamental and universal correlation between the oxygen evolution activity and the corrosion of metal oxides. This corrosion manifests itself in structural changes and/or dissolution of the material. We prove from basic thermodynamic considerations that any metal oxide must become unstable under oxygen evolution conditions irrespective of the pH value. The reason is the thermodynamic instability of the oxygen anion in the metal oxide lattice. Our findings explain many of the experimentally observed corrosion phenomena on different metal oxide OER catalysts.									216	2	0	0	14	0	216			2045-2322			WOS:000358007900001	26178185

Sulfur and nitrogen codoped carbon tubes (SNCTs), prepared by annealing the mixture of amorphous carbonaceous tubes and cysteine, are found to be active bifunctional metal-free electrocatalysts for both oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution in acidic medium. The optimized SNCT catalyst exhibits a record high onset potential of 851mV (vs. RHE) for oxygen reduction and concurrent a low overpotential of 76mV for hydrogen evolution, with superior stability and low cost. The SNCT electrocatalyst could have great potential in proton exchange membrane fuel cells and water splitting devices.									44	5	0	0	2	0	46			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000380273300005	27150558

Here we report a facile approach to fabricate an atomic iron- and nitrogen-codoped graphene catalyst with high content of iron (up to 1.5 wt%). The atomic iron-based catalyst on glassy carbon electrodes displays low overpotential (194 mV and 275 mV) reported at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH and 0.1 M KOH solutions for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. In addition, the atomic iron-based composite electrocatalyst exhibits a high half-wave potential of 0.90 V vs. RHE for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in 0.1 M KOH, and a combined ORR and OER potential gap of 0.605 V. Structural characterization and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the efficient active sites for OER and ORR should be FeN4-moiety embedded into the graphene, on which the overpotential-determining step is the O-O coupling step.

We use a group of Mg-doped Y2Ru2O7 catalysts for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the alkaline OER, and the oxygen reduction reaction, and all demonstrate significantly higher catalytic performance than undoped Y2Ru2O7 and commercial RuO2. The optimal oxygen electrocatalysts, Y1.85Mg0.15Ru2O7, demonstrate great promise in both ZABs and PEMWEs. Our experiments disclose that a hole-doping effect is massively enhanced when the Y3+ in YRO is partially replaced by Mg2+; this promotes oxygen vacancy concentration and multivalence in Ru5+/Ru4+, both of which are closely related to the intrinsic activity of oxygen catalysts. This strategy could be extended to explore other oxygen catalysts with superior efficiency and durability for both PEMWE and ZAB.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000537388500005

Periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations were applied in this work to give a comprehensive understanding of the OER/EOP mechanism on the PbO2 (101) surface. The reaction networks including the AEM, LOM-1, and LOM-2 were established, and the results show that the LOM-2 reaction pathway exhibited the highest reactivity, which involves two surface lattice oxygens (Olatt) and one oxygen atom from H2O, with the theoretical overpotential calculated to be 0.48 V. Different potential-determining steps (PDSs) were predicted depending on the above three reaction pathways. Surprisingly, DFT calculations also found that the oxygen vacancy formation was exothermic on PbO2 surfaces, which was significantly different from most transition-metal oxides. Negative oxygen vacancy formation energies indicated that the surface lattice oxygens could easily migrate and couple to form O-2/O-3, which also verified the facile LOM reaction mechanism. DFT calculations reveal that the formation of O-vac1/O-vac2 triggered further reactions of H2O adsorption and splitting, which refilled the oxygen vacancy and ensured considerable stability of the PbO2 catalyst. Multiple H2O dissociation pathways were proposed on PbO2 (101) with oxygen vacancy sites: the acid-base interaction mechanism and the vacancy-fulfilling mechanism. This work gives a comprehensive understanding of reaction mechanisms for OER and EOP processes.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000821562400001

Improving the catalytic activity and utilization efficiency of noble metal is of great importance for the practical application. Here, we report a one-pot synthesis of porous rhodium octahedra through a corner-induced-selective-deposition (CISD) process. After simple interfacial boron modification, the performances towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media were greatly enhanced. Especially, a small overpotential of 31 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) was achieved for HER, and a high half-wave potential of 914 mV was obtained for ORR, much better than the commercial Pt/C catalysts (55 mV, 891 mV). Density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that the boron incorporation optimizes the adsorption properties of catalyst surface and in turn, lowers the over potentials for the three reactions. This work may be extended to design other nanoscale functional materials with delicate nanostructures and optimized compositions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773622300006

MnO2 catalysts have aroused intense interests owing to their promising activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which, however, is still not comparable to precious metal catalysts. To improve the ORR catalysis and meet the requirement for a bifunctional oxygen catalyst, MnO2 nanosheets are modified with Co, Ni or Fe via a facile solution-based method. Among the modified samples, Co-MnO2 presents improved catalysis for both ORR and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The modification introduces additional active sites for OER and induced more oxygen defects to further facilitate the ORR. Zn-air batteries with the Co-MnO2 air cathode showed a higher peak power density of 167 mW cm(-2), a lower potential gap of 0.75 V and a higher round-trip efficiency of 63 % (5 mA cm(-2)) compared to MnO2 without modification. Good cycling stability of the battery is also achieved. The proper amount of cobalt species in the MnO2 is vital for achieving a balance between high performance and durable cycling.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2196-0216			WOS:000605216400015

Herein, we report a bimetal Fe/Mn-N-C material composed of spinel MnFe2O4/metallic Fe hybrid nano particles encapsulated in N-doped mesoporous hollow carbon nanospheres as an excellent bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalyst in alkaline electrolyte. The Fe/Mn-N-C catalyst is synthesized via pyrolysis of bimetal ion-incorporated polydopamine nanospheres and shows impressive ORR electrocatalytic activity superior to Pt/C and good OER activity close to RuO2 catalyst in alkaline environment. When tested in Zn-air battery, the Fe/Mn-N-C catalyst demonstrates excellent ultimate performance including power density, durability, and cycling. This work reports the bimetal Fe/Mn-N-C as a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst and may afford useful insights into the design of sustainable transition-metal-based high-performance electrocatalysts.									55	2	0	0	5	0	55			1944-8244			WOS:000436211500026	29845856

The alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was used as a test reaction with four different metallic glasses, Ni78Si8B14, Ni70Mo20Si5B5, Ni58Co20Si10B12, and Ni25Co50Si15B10, as electrodes. The electrocatalytic properties of the electrodes were determined. The electrode surfaces were then investigated with an STM. A clear relationship between the catalytic activity of an electrode toward the OER and its tunneling characteristics was found.

These microorganisms are usually strictly anaerobic. At the same time, the anode reaction of bioelectrochemical systems is almost exclusively water splitting through the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This creates a dilemma for MES development and engineering. Oxygen penetration to the cathode has to be excluded to avoid toxicity and efficiency losses while assuring low resistance. We show that this dilemma derives a strong need to identify novel reactor designs when using the OER as an anode reaction or to fully replace OER with alternative oxidation reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1664-302X		WOS:000841303300001	35992647

The bottleneck is the difficulties on clear and precise understanding towards the multi-step reactions with fast reaction rates. Interdigitated array (IDA) electrodes with sensitive responses on the generation, transfer and collection of reaction products are proposed and utilized as a convenient and effective tool to in situ monitor and characterize the reaction thermodynamics and kinetics information. Herein, nickel-iron hydroxide, a promising and novel OER catalyst, is chosen as the candidate to demonstrate the merit of IDA on studying the OER. With the generator-collector mode, the real-time oxygen evolution process is monitored precisely with the IDA collector, distinguished it from the general catalytic current which is normally recorded with conventional electrochemical method. In another word, the actual faradaic efficiency was observed experimentally with IDA electrodes, which is often misled as 100% in many works. The diffusion of the reaction products has been 'seen' as well with the generator-collector mode. This general tool (IDA) may make more contributions on the study of reaction process of all electrocatalytical reactions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000665542900001	34111847

The dependence of the OER activity on film composition and thickness was evaluated, which revealed an optimal Fe:Co ratio of about 1:2.33. The composition of the catalyst film was observed to vary with film thickness. The electrodeposition parameters were carefully controlled to yield microstructured Ni-foam decorated with CoFe-OH films of controlled thickness and composition. The most active electrode exhibited an overpotential as low as 360 mV OER at an industrial scale current density of 400 mA cm(-2) that remained stable for at least 320 h.

The Se modification not only prevents Ru oxidation during charge/discharge cycling, but also improves the catalytic activity by promoting Li2O2 versus Li2O deposited on the Ru particles during discharge. A computational calculation with density functional theory supports the role of a larger electron transfer to the oxygen of Li2O2 adsorbed on a surface layer of RuSe2- than on a surface layer of RuO2, thereby shifting the more stable adsorbent from Li2O to Li2O2.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000427968900012

Herein, we develop a novel "adsorption-calcination-reduction" strategy to synthesize spinel transitional metal oxides with a unique necklace-like multishelled hollow structure exploiting sacrificial templates of carbonaceous microspheres, including NiCo2O4 (NCO), CoMn2O4, and NiMn2O4. Importantly, benefiting from the unique structures and reduction treatment to offer rich oxygen vacancies, the unique reduced NCO (R-NCO) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst exhibits the dual characteristics of good stability as well as high electrocatalytic activity for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). At 1.61 V cell voltage, a 10 mA cm(-2) water splitting current density is obtained from the dual-electrode, alkaline water electrolyzer. Calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) reveal a mechanism for the promotion of the catalytic reactions based on a decrease in the energy barrier for the formation of intermediates resulting from the introduction of oxygen vacancies through the reduction process. This method could prove to be an effective general strategy for the preparation of complex, hollow structures and functionalities.									313	16	0	0	26	0	315			0002-7863			WOS:000448755200026	30215256

Single-atom catalysts (SACS) with maximum atom efficiency and well-defined active sites have been recognized as promising alternatives of the present noble-metal-based catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction.

Herein, a detailed review of the recent advances of SACs with strong electronic metal-support interaction (EMSI) for rechargeable ZABs is provided. Great emphasis was placed on the EMSI forms and design strategies. Moreover, the importance and the impact of the atomic coordinating structure and the substrates on the oxygen electrocatalytic activity and stability are highlighted.

Herein, the NCM-based (NCM, LiN1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2) composite materials are prepared through the two steps method. The NCM-2 (Mn2O3/(LiN1/Co1/3Mn1/3O2)-Co-3) hybrid material demonstrates excellent ORR catalytic property and high OER catalytic performance, as well as the superior stability. Besides, with NCM-2 hybrid materials as catalysts of air cathode, the Al-air battery and Zn-air battery both exhibit higher power density. Therefore, based on results of Brunauer-Emmett-Teller and O-2 temperature programmed desorption analysis, the improved catalytic performance ascribed to large specific surface area, pore structure and enhanced oxygen adsorption ability.

In this work, carbon-supported tantalum based catalysts were synthesized by a microemulsion procedure from tantalum ethoxide through a fast hydrolysis reaction followed by heat treatment. The nature and composition of the different tantalates and oxides (general formula NaaTabOc, with a/b = 0-1 and c/b = 2.5-3) relied on the concentration of ethanol as well as on the annealing temperature, with Na2Ta8O21 as predominant crystal phase in all cases. High annealing temperatures resulted in a certain degree of oxygen substoichiometry, which creates defects responsible of electrocatalytic activity. The electrochemical response for the oxygen reduction and the oxygen evolution reactions in alkaline electrolyte (0.1 M NaOH) was evaluated for the first time in this type of materials. The presence of Na2Ta8O21 phase over other oxides/tantalates, a high crystallinity of such Ta-phase, and the oxygen substoichiometry are the three parameters playing a relevant role to favor ORR and OER electro-activity. The best formulations were found in a trade-off situation using 3% ethanol and annealing at 900 degrees C. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The structural and compositional characterization results showed that the obtained La0.8Sr0.2Mn1-xNixO3 (x = 0.2 and 0.4) contained more oxygen vacancies than did the undoped La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 as well as a certain amount of Ni3+ (e(g) = 1) on their surface. The Ni-doped La0.8Sr0.2Mn1-xNixO3 (x = 0.2 and 0.4)-was provided with higher bifunctional catalytic activities than that of the undoped La0 8Sr0.2MnO3. In particular, the La0.8Sr0.2Mn0.6Ni0.4O3 had a lower total over potential between the oxygen evolution reaction and the oxygen reduction reaction than that of the La0.8Sr0.2MnO3, and the value is even comparable to that of the commercial Pt/C yet is provided with a much reduced cost. In the lithium air battery, oxygen cathodes containing the La0.8Sr0.2Mn0.6Ni0.4O3 catalyst delivered the optimized electrochemical performance in terms of specific capacity and cycle life, and a reasonable reaction mechanism was given to explain the improved performance.									120	7	0	0	5	0	122			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000372479300027	26900959

Recently, metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived electrocatalysts have been extensively explored not only because of their superior electrocatalytic activities but also their well-defined active sites, particularly those of single-atom active sites, which have been recognized as role-model electrocatalysts for fundamental understanding of the catalytic mechanisms at both the molecular and electronic levels. In this paper, we have reviewed the recent progress in MOF-derived electrocatalysts with focus on the characterization of the catalytically active sites, their functional mechanisms and performance validation/optimization of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Regarding the synthesis of the electrocatalysts with active sites, the alloy and composite formation and the edge-defect/oxygen vacancy engineering are discussed. Regarding the characterization for fundamental understanding, some advanced in situ/ex situ characterization and theoretical calculations using first-principles Density Functional Theory (DFT) are summarized. Some technical challenges are analyzed and the corresponding further research directions for overcoming the challenges are also proposed for future research and development of practicable MOF-derived electrocatalysts.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000693225100001

Electrocatalytic reactions involving oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygenreduction reaction (ORR) play crucial roles in assisting the derivation of clean forms of energy. Here, wedemonstrate that few layers of the manganese oxide: hausmannitene (atomically thin two dimensional(2D-Mn3O4) can be exfoliated from its bulk form hausmannite (Mn3O4). Most significantly, the hausmanniteneexhibits catalytic activity towards oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. The hausmannitenehas enhanced Mn(III) ions ( 65%) compared to its parent structure hausmannite ( 31%). The Mn(III) ionsin a distorted lattice show the highest catalytic activity towards OER performance with the oxygen electrodeactivity (DE) of 1.08 eV for hausmannitene. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations, confirmedthe presence of both Mn(III) and Mn(II) sites on the (112)-oriented surface of Mn3O4 which arehighly active for OER and ORR, having vacant and filled orbitals of lowest and highest energy, respectively.Increased oxidation sites aiding to better performance of 2D structure was theoretically manifested.Therefore, demonstrating that similar mechanisms can be used to explore other 2D oxides aspossible efficient stable electrocatalyst substitute for energy conversion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1226-086X			KJD:ART002878418

Li-MnOx, Na-MnOx, K-MnOx, Rb-MnOx, and Cs-MnOx provide OER overpotentials of 1.64, 1.70, 1.79, 1.83, and 1.84 V vs. RHE, respectively as well as ORR overpotentials of 0.71, 1.06, 1.13, 1.15, and 1.14 V vs. RHE, respectively. Li-MnOx shows the highest bifunctional catalytic activity towards both the ORR and OER. In addition, the Gibbs free energy change of (OH)-O-star adsorption is found to be the largest throughout the reaction pathways determining the rate of the whole ORR and OER.									22	1	0	0	0	0	22			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000440432600025	29845149

By considering the oxophilicity of the doping element, here we demonstrate the Mn (with higher oxophilicity) and Ni (with lower oxophilicity) doping of Ni1-xMnxPS3 and Mn1-xNixPS3 NSs on their HER and OER activity in alkaline solution. It is found that non-substituted NiPS3 NSs show better catalytic activity than their Mn-doped samples. On the contrary, Ni doping into MnPS3 NSs significantly improves the electrocatalytic performance. This work may substantially expand the understanding of the role of elemental oxophilicity on the electrochemical water splitting activities of Ni/Mn based catalysts. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Multicomponent metal mixed oxides with controlled structures and compositions are recently considered as promising candidates to realize efficient oxygen evolution reaction at low overpotential. Herein, a Fe-Co-Ni gel with uniform dispersion of Fe/Co/Ni is prepared by a facile sol-gel method, followed by a vacuum drying process to obtain an amorphous ternary Fe-Co-Ni oxide. Of note, this strategy can be extended to synthesize other amorphous multicomponent metal oxides in force. Benefiting from the structural and compositional advantages, the as-prepared FeCoNiOx exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline solution with an overpotential of only 240 and 203 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) on a glassy carbon electrode and Ni foam electrode, respectively. The present approach provides some insight in design and synthesis of amorphous multicomponent metal oxide materials for energy storage and conversion applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, Co/N co-doped 3D hierarchical porous bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst was synthesized using F127 as soft template and PMMA nanosphere as hard template to build hierarchically ordered macro/mesoporous porous nanostructure. The as-obtained macro/mesoporous Co-N-doped carbon endowing its 3D ordered hierarchical porosity and satisfactory surface area, leading to superior performance for ORR, OER, and rechargeable Zn-air battery. For ORR, the catalyst showed superior ORR activity with an attractive half-wave potential of 0.85 V (vs RHE), remarkable methanol tolerance, and robust long-term stability under alkaline electrolyte. For OER, the as-synthetized electrocatalyst exhibited low overpotential of 1.67 V (vs RHE) under the current density of 10 mA/cm(2). Moreover, the Zn-air battery assembled from the hierarchical porous catalyst displayed a high peak power density of 146 mW/cm(2).									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000597214500001

I present here the one-step hydrothermal synthesis of a category of Pt-free NiCo alloy electrocatalysts assisted by a reduction process with diethanolamine, propanediol, ethanolamine or mono-ethylene gloycol. By optimizing assistant solvent species, the catalytic performances toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in seawater are maximized. The resultant NiCo electrocatalysts are featured with low onset overpotentials and large current densities for OER from seawater splitting. The large heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant (K-eff(o)) and turnover frequency (TOF) suggest robust catalytic behaviors toward OER in real seawater. Additionally, the reasonable long-term stability of the optimal NiCo alloy electrode over 40 h in seawater further demonstrates that it is promising for oxygen evolution from splitting seawater.

Intermittent renewable energies such as solar and wind could be stored in chemical bonds, such as hydrogen and carbon containing chemicals through water and CO2 electrolyzers respectively. Those two energy systems share a common anodic reaction, the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which currently relies on precious noble metals to achieve a reasonable energy conversion efficiency. Herein, tuning the d -band center of Fe-based inverse spinel oxides has been achieved through compositions and morphologies engineering. Ternary Mn0.5Co0.5Fe2O4 nanocubes exhibit oxygen evolution activity superior to the benchmark RuO2. Mossbauer and in-situ infrared spectra combined with density functional theory calculations prove that the optimized d-band center offers a balanced adsorption strength of intermediate *OOH on Mn0.5Co0.5Fe2O4 nanocubes.

Although ternary sulfides have been explored as oxygen electrocatalysts, they are usually mono-functional and undergo a complicated preparation process. Herein, via a facile and mild self-assembly method induced by electrostatic interaction, a series of novel ternary sulfide hybrids (denoted as MInS/NH2-CNT, M = Co, Fe or Mn) were fabricated as bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts using supertetrahedral metal sulfide nanoclusters (T4 clusters) with uniformly distributed ternary component as precursors. The synergistic effect between T4 clusters-aggregated nanoparticles and amino carbon nanotubes (i.e., NH2-CNT) endows the hybrids with oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic activity. Among the as-synthesized MInS/NH2-CNT, CoInS/NH2-CNT reveals superior electrocatalytic performance for the OER (overpotential of 398 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and ORR (half-wave potential of 0.76 V vs. RHE). The strategy developed here can be easily adopted to construct other cluster-based hybrid materials for electrocatalysts, thus providing more promising non-noble metal materials for energy application.

Herein, a tannic acid (TA) etching strategy is used to inhibit the metal aggregation and achieve muti-metal doping. The hollow NH2-MIL-101@TA derived Fe-N-C catalyst exhibits superior ORR catalytic activity with an E-1/2 of 0.872 V and a maximum output power density of 123.4 mW cm(-2) in Zn-air battery. Since TA can easily chelate with metal ions, Fe/Co-N-C and Fe/Ni-N-C are also synthesized. Fe/Ni-N-C manifests exceptional bifunctional activity with an E-j = 10 of 1.67 V and a potential gap of 0.833 V between E-j = 10 and E-1/2 in alkaline electrolyte, which is 45 mV smaller than Pt/C-IrO2. The improvement of ORR and OER performance of the catalysts via the simple TA etching and chelation method provides a novel strategy for the design and synthesis of efficient electrocatalysts.

For the low Ni-doped Co3O4, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman data show that the Ni ions are successfully incorporated into the Co3O4 lattices. Electrochemical measurements indicate that Co3O4 with low amount of Ni doping possesses remarkably enhanced activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. And especially, 4 wt% Ni-doped Co3O4 possesses the most efficient activity with an overpotential of 240 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and 120 mV for HER in 1 M KOH than the pure Co3O4 and other Ni-doped Co3O4 samples. Our study suggests that the low doping would have a great potential in rational design of spinel oxides toward highly efficient electrocatalysis. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Although platinum group metals exhibit high catalytic activity, increasing production costs due to resource constraints, limited countries of production, and geopolitical supply issues are threatening their use. Therefore, it is crucial to make substantial changes in resource utilization for the sustainable production of electrochemical catalysts. Herein, the preparation of trifunctional biomass-derived electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen/hydrogen evolution reactions by the pyrolysis of cellulose nanofibers from ascidian tunicates, dried blood meal, and cyanocobalamin is reported. The combination of N, P, FeN4, and CoN4 structures incorporated in the carbon network leads to high electrochemical performance comparable with rare-metal-based electrocatalysts and other carbon alloy electrocatalysts. This work provides a possible strategy for fabricating high-capacity energy storage devices from biomass resources such as industrial waste without the need for rare metals or other harmful heavy metals.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2699-9412			WOS:000854300600001

Here, we report an electrochemically activated Ni-Fe oxyhydroxide catalyst that delivers an early onset potential of 1.51 V at 100 mA cm(-2) within mimic saline water of 0.5 M NaCl + 1 M NaOH. During the electrochemical activation, ex situ X-ray radiation and in situ Raman characterizations reveal the structural reconstruction of amorphous Ni (oxy)hydroxide generation and electronic structure modulation from Fe intercalation. Headspace gas chromatography and iodine titration results confirm the similar to 100% Faradaic efficiency toward O-2 evolution on activated NiFeOxHy, whereas the long-term stability is assessed by an anion exchange membrane electrolyzer, demonstrating only 350 mV voltage decay during the 100 h continuous electrolysis at 500 mA cm(-)(2).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2168-0485			WOS:000834276100001

These reactions occur at open circuit by immersion of PbO2 coated electrodes in aqueous solutions of the cations and lead to the formation of outer oxide layers onto porous PbO2, whose composition and chemical nature have been assessed by XPS. The growth of the outer oxide layers has been studied by combining Evans' diagrams with SEM-EDS and XPS results, as a function of experimental variables, such as the chemical nature of the cations, their concentration and the solution temperature. The combination of oxygen bubble templated anodic deposition and galvanic displacement provides a route for the preparation of porous low-conductivity electroactive oxides not attainable by direct electrodeposition. Deposition of Co3O4 thin layers by galvanic displacement results in a strong enhancement of the activity of porous PbO2 electrodes in the oxygen evolution reaction. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Although, the primary overpotential requirement and stability problem of the electrocatalysts make the process difficult for industrial applications, a cost-effective electrocatalyst with high surface area, stability, and bifunctional activity can eliminate such barriers in the upcoming eons. To date, metal alloys, metal hydroxides, metal oxides, metal derivatives (phosphides, sulfides, selenides, and carbides) metal-organic frameworks, hybrid and metal-free materials based electrocatalysts have been already developed for the overall water splitting. Herein, the challenges to enhance the activity, stability and durability in the metal (both noble metal and transitional metal) and metal-free based electrocatalyst for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are summarized. A general overview of the water splitting mechanism followed by various electrocatalyst are discussed mainly. Moreover, it is expected to provide a comprehensive summary and outlook at the end.

For each synthesis method, a peak in oxygen evolution activity was observed near 10 mol % Fe content, where the mixed metal oxide was substantially more active than the parent metal oxide electrocatalysts. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed the formation of a mixed NiO/NiFe2O4 phase at low Fe concentrations, and formation of Fe2O3 at compositions above 25 mol % Fe. Raman vibrational spectroscopy confirmed the formation of NiFe2O4, and did not detect Fe2O3 in the electrocatalysts containing up to 20 mol % Fe. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XCANES) showed the Fe in the mixed oxides to be predominantly in the +3 oxidation state. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) showed changes in the Fe coordination shells under electrochemical oxygen evolution conditions. Temperature programmed reaction spectroscopy showed the mixed oxide surfaces also have superior oxidation activity for methanol oxidation, and that the reactivity of the mixed oxide surface is substantially different than that of the parent metal oxide surfaces. Overall, the NiFe2O4 phase is implicated in having a significant role in improving the oxygen evolution activity of the mixed metal oxide systems.									368	18	0	0	23	0	371			2155-5435			WOS:000307257800031

However, creating oxygen defects often require high processing temperatures or long-time consumption. Here, we exploited a simple and universal method to create defects in several metal oxides such as Co3O4, ZnO, SnO2, and CeO2 using highly active liquid sodium-potassium (Na-K) alloy as the reducing agent at room temperature. To verify the available potential of this synthetic strategy, we choose defective Co3O4 as an example and investigate its oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. The oxygen vacancies have a significant promotion effect on the OER activity and its starting potential is 1.54 V with a Tafel slope of 47.9 mV/dec, which is much lower than pristine Co3O4 nanoparticles. Our method of creating defects in oxides may be used for many other related applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000618297500007

The D-LDHs show a low overpotential of 283 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and small Tafel slope of 39 mV dec(-1) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

Here, we report transition metal-boron alloy Co-W-B is an active electrocatalyst for water electrolysis. The Co-W-B catalyst can be readily deposited on nickle foam (NF) using a simple electroless plating method. A combination of phase/chemical state/microstructural analyses of the Co-W-B electrocatalyst was conducted using XRD, TEM, Raman spectroscopy and XPS techniques. The properly annealed Co-W-B/NF catalyst with an optimal composition exhibits a low overpotential along with a high stability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solution, which is among the best reported levels for non-noble HER catalysts. In addition, the Co-W-B/NF catalyst also shows moderate activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). These study results highlight the potential of transition metal-boron alloys as high-performance and low-cost electrocatalyst for water splitting.									31	2	0	0	0	0	32			2365-6549			WOS:000406682000057

Potentiodynamic polarization curves and the corresponding kinetic parameter analysis show that [BMIM]HSO4 has a catalytic effect on oxygen evolution by stimulating the reaction rate constant. Impedance data reveal that [BMIM]HSO4 can markedly reduce the oxygen evolution charge transfer resistance. The addition of 5 mg . L-1 [BMIM]HSO4 obviously decreased the resistance value by at least 50% over the studied potential range from 1.85 to 2.10 V. In addition, the results of the impedance measurements also suggest an inhibition effect of [BMIM]HSO4 on the secondary reactions and this is due to the adsorption of the additive on the anode surface, which decreased the amount of active sites for anion adsorption. All electrochemical results were corroborated with a morphological and orientation analysis of the anodic surface after 120 h of anodic polarization. The addition of [BMIM]HSO4 inhibited the generation of the intermediate product beta-PbO2 and it promoted the generation of larger, loose, and porous alpha-PbO2, which benefited the oxygen evolution reaction.									12	6	0	0	1	0	16			1000-6818			WOS:000285781600023

Herein, hierarchically porous N-doped carbon nanofibers supported Fe3C/Fe nanoparticles (denoted as Fe/N-HCNFs) have been successfully fabricated. The synthesis involved the successive steps of electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) nanofiber, surface functionalization of tannic acid (TA), coordination with ferric salt and carbonization. The obtained Fe/N-HCNFs exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic performance for both ORR and OER. Furthermore, Fe/N-HCNFs delivered a higher power density and an excellent long-term stability when applied in a constructed Zn-air battery, which illustrated its outstanding prospects for energy storage and conversion.									18	2	0	0	0	0	18			2365-6549			WOS:000456211600040

However, the origin of the synergy between Ni and Fe remains unclear. Here, operando X-ray absorption and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy were used to prove the charging-discharging behavior of Ni and Fe when they are adjacent. Fe oxidation and Ni reduction were simultaneously observed during electrocatalytic OER in NiFeOxHy compared to unary metal (oxy)hydroxide. The higher Fermi level of FeOxHy compared to NiOxHy enables charge transfer from Fe to Ni domain near the boundaries. From the experimental results, the combination of Ni and Fe results in superior oxygen-evolving activity by exposing high valent Fe coupled with a dischargeable Ni matrix. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The formation of a protective-active oxide layer on the metallic-Co not only facilitated the effective charge separation and transport but also displayed improved stability of Co-Co3O4/NC in an alkaline operating condition. The Co-Co3O4/NC catalyst afforded 0.810 V overvoltage be-tween ORR and OER in 0.1 M KOH solution, consequently, this lower reversible overvoltage would result in energy saving of around 0.246 V if Co-Co3O4/NC is used as an oxygen electrode instead of commercially available 40 wt % Pt/C. Furthermore, in comparison with the use of Pt/C thorn IrO2 as an ORR and OER catalyst, respectively the single bi-functional electrocatalyst i.e., Co-Co3O4/NC would result in energy saving of around 0.13 V.

Lithium-oxygen (Li-O-2) batteries have shown great potential as next generation secondary batteries since their energy density is comparable to that of gasoline. Herein, we report a three dimensional (3D) self-supporting Co-CoSe@NSeC/bioC cathode fabricated through growing cobalt based metal organic framework (ZIF-67) on biomass and subsequent high-temperature selenization. The as synthesized Co-CoSe@NSeC/bioC cathode, benefiting from the 3D porous structure, the active defects derived from the doping of N, Se heteroatoms in carbon skeleton, and the highly-active of Co/CoSe heterojunction, shows excellent oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER) electrocatalytic activity. It delivers a high specific capacity of 9.1 mAhmiddotcm(-2) at a current density of 0.05 mAmiddotcm(-2) and maintains 78 stable cycles.

Here, we utilize AuNi heterodimers as the starting materials to achieve high activities toward HER, OER and ORR. The HER and ORR activities in an alkali environment are similar to those of Pt catalysts, and the OER activity is very high and better than that of commercial IrO2. Both the experimental and calculated results suggest that the surface oxidation under oxidative conditions is the main reason for the different activities. The NiO/Ni interface which exists in the as-synthesized heterodimers contributes to high HER activity, the Ni(OH)(2)-Ni-Au interface and the surface Ni(OH)(2) obtained in electrochemical conditons gives rise to promising ORR and OER activities, respectively. As a comparison, a Au@Ni core-shell structure is also synthesized and examined. The core-shell structure shows lower activities for HER and OER than the heterodimers, and reduces O-2 selectively to H2O2. The work here allows for the development of a method to design multifunctional catalysts via the partial oxidation of a metal surface to create different active centers.									54	3	0	0	3	0	54			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000429579100010	29468840

Herein, we use molybde-num oxide nanorods as sacrificial templates to construct a self-supporting molybdenum-doped cobalt hydroxide nanosheet hierarchical microtubule structure based on a structural engineering strategy to improve the active area of the catalyst. X-ray-based spectroscopic tests revealed that Mo (VI) with tetra-hedral coordination intercalated into the interlayer of cobalt hydroxide, promoting interlayer separation. At the same time, Mo is connected with Co through oxygen bonds, which promotes the transfer of Co charges to Mo and reduces the electron cloud density of Co ions. In 1 M KOH, optimized molybdenum -doped cobalt hydroxide nanosheet microtubules only needs an overpotential of 288 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2, which is significantly better than that of pure Co(OH)2 nanosheets and RuO2. Structural engineering and electronic state regulation can effectively improve the oxygen evolution activity of cobalt-based hydroxide, which provides a design idea for the development of efficient oxygen evolution catalysts.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Carbon dioxide concentration was achieved from a gaseous stream composed of 49.3% carbon dioxide and 50.7% oxygen. A volumetric ratio of 3.56:1 carbon dioxide to oxygen evolution was observed. Oxygen separation occurs through reversible oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions. Carbon dioxide separation occurs through homogeneous reactions between gas-phase CO2 and electrochemical reaction products on one side of the membrane to form carbonate and bicarbonate ions and neutralization of those ions on the other side of the membrane by electrochemical reactions. Current densities reached a maximum of 6 mA/cm(2) at a cell potential of 1.2 V. Although this approach is not efficient enough to utilize for CO2 capture for fossil energy applications at this time, more active electrocatalysts and thinner ion-exchange membranes could improve the efficiency in the future, and it may be suitable for other applications such as removal of CO2 from breathing air.

A sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction processes is noted either when Co3O4 is lacked or Ketjen Black is insufficient, which leads to much higher over-potentials between charge and discharge profiles. By contrast, with the optimal design in terms of electric conduction and catalytic activity, the Co3O4/Ketjen Black (80 wt%) composite achieves enhanced electrochemical performance with an initial discharge capacity of 2044 mAh g(-1) and maintaining 33 cycles at a fixed capacity of 500 mAh g(-1). The electrochemical characterization indicates that the improved Li-O-2 battery performance may benefit from the highest oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction activity under this electro-chemically optimized composite. This work may shed light on the design principle of future cathode materials for Li-O-2 batteries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This work demonstrates an effective approach of activating 2D carbon for highly efficient bifunctional oxygen reactions without N-doping, let alone a transition metal-nitrogen (TM-N-x) moiety, the usual component needed for high oxygen electrocatalytic activities. A solvothermally synthesized ceria (CeO2)-hydroxylated graphene hybrid catalyst shows excellent bifunctional ORR/OER activities both in alkaline and acidic solutions. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the activation of graphene occurs via topmost oxygens on ceria surface, but only when low coverage of hydroxyl groups is present on graphene. Furthermore, catalytically active forms of graphene share similar hydroxylated structural motifs. Finally, a simple approach of dramatically enhancing durability even in acidic media is demonstrated.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2366-7486			WOS:000530870600001

It was observed that the catalysts formed an array of FeCo/PDC > FeNi/PDC > FeCoNi/PDC according to their oxygen reduction onset potential values. High oxygen evolution activity comparable to IrO2 was exhibited by the materials. Consequently, excellent bifunctional activity comparable to data from the literature was reached with all three synthesized catalysts.

Herein, we developed a facile strategy to synthesize hollow tubular bimetallic Ni-Co oxide rooted with dense nanosheets for enhanced bifunctionality and facilitated redox reaction kinetics. Owing to the rational design of morphology and well-dispersed Ni and Co ions, the bimetallic samples exhibit admirable bifunctional electrocatalytic activities. This bimetallic Ni-Co oxide shows superior oxygen electrocatalytic performance in comparison with the monometallic Ni and Co oxides, according to the electrocatalytic synergistic effect from the bimetallic system. The optimized sample with the specific mass ratio of Ni and Co displays the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) property comparable to commercial Pt/C and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance superior to commercial RuO2. The electrochemical tests and structural characterizations offer in-depth dissection on the electrocatalytic behaviors, especially the superb stability in both ORR and OER tests, as well as the outstanding resistance to methanol poisoning, representing a promising candidate in the renewable energy field.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000621051200034	33538592

Iron foam, which is composed of the second most abundant metal element on the earth, can boost the water splitting reactions after a simple treatment of surface phosphorization. The as-prepared electrocatalyst, which is denoted as FePx@Fe, exhibits an excellent activity in alkaline solutions, and requires overpotentials of 124 and 274 mV to approach 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively. Meanwhile, FePx@Fe also shows a remarkable performance on overall water splitting, which only needs 1.67 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2) and exhibits a satisfying long-term durability.

Co3O4 as one kind of non-precious metal electrocatalysts has shown promising bifunctional performance in alkaline media, which is greatly influenced by the average particle size. Here, size-controlled synthesis of Co3O4 nanoparticles loaded on N-doped reduced graphene oxide (RGO) was performed by adjusting the Co2+ initial feed concentration, and five Co3O4/N-RGO catalysts with different particle sizes were obtained. Among the prepared samples, the Co3O4/N-RGO catalyst with the average particle size of 12.2 nm displays the best bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic activities with the Delta E (E-OER,E-10mAcm-2(ORR,-3mAcm-2)) value of 0.75 V, which is the lowest value for the Co-based bifunctional electrocatalysts as reported in the literatures.

Here, we report that a rod-like bimetallic NiFe metal-organic framework (NiFe-MOF) can directly act as a highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst synthesized by a convenient-to-operate hydrothermal method. The rod-like NiFe-MOF can derive 10 mA cm -2 with a low overpotential of only 26 mV, and its Tafel slope is 40.82 mV dec -1, which is superior to that of monometallic Ni-MOF or Fe-MOF, and even can be comparable to that of RuO2. To identify the origin of enhancing OER activity, we resorted to X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, high resolution transmission electron microscopy image and nitrogen adsorption–desorption techniques and various electrochemical techniques to probe it gingerly. The results indicate that its high electrochemically active area and the synergistic effect of bimetallic node could be responsible for the surprisingly high catalytic performance of the NiFe-MOF. These results suggest that this kind of bimetallic MOF (NiFe-MOF) could be a promising electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1793-2920			KJD:ART002498133

Suppression of Hydrogen Evolution by Oxygen Reduction in Nanoporous Electrocatalysts								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY				139	10			3663	3668		10.1021/jacs.6b10855				MAR 15 2017	2017	Electroreduction of small molecules in aqueous solution often competes with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), especially if the reaction is driven even moderately hard using a large overpotential. Here, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was studied under proton diffusion-limited conditions in slightly acidic electrolytes: a model system to study the relative transport kinetics of protons and reactants to an electrocatalyst and the relationship between transport and catalytic performance. Using dealloyed nanoporous nickel platinum (np-NiPt) electrodes, we find the hydrogen evolution reaction can be completely suppressed even at high overpotentials (-400 mV vs RHE). In addition, the mechanism of oxygen reduction can be changed by using buffered versus unbuffered solutions, suggesting the reaction selectivity is associated with a transient rise (or lack thereof) in the interface pH at the np-NiPt surface. Independently controlling reactant transport to electrocatalyst surfaces at high overpotentials exhibited a surprisingly rich phenomenology that may offer a generalizable strategy to increase activity and selectivity during electroreduction reactions.									25	0	0	0	2	0	25			0002-7863			WOS:000396801300018	28211275

Herein, we report high-performance bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts consisting of mixed transition metal (Fe, Co, Ni) oxide nanoparticles supported on oxidized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT). Investigation of the ORR and OER activity of samples with different metal compositions showed that trimetallic/MWCNT composites having Fe:Ni:Co = x:x:(1-2x) ratios, with 0.25 <= x <= 0.4, exhibit highest bifunctional activity in terms of the reversible ORR/OER overvoltage at a given current density. Moreover, the trimetallic catalysts exhibited improved selectivity with respect to the reduction of O-2 to OH- compared to the bimetallic Fe-Ni, Fe-Co and Co-Ni catalysts, thus revealing synergistic interactions among the metal oxide components. Correlation of the electrocatalytic activity with the structure of the composites is discussed for the most representative cases.									34	0	1	0	0	0	35			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000579549200028

Metal oxide semiconductors (MOS) are widely used in the field of catalysis because of its excellent catalytic characteristics. Introduction of defects, in addition to the adjustment of composition and atomic arrangement in the materials can effectively improve the materials' catalytic performance. Especially, introducing oxygen vacancies (OVs) into the lattice structure of MOS has been developed as a facile route to improve MOS's optical and electronic transmission characteristics. And a large number of metal oxides with rich OVs have been served in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2-RR) photo-degradation of organic pollutants, etc. This small review briefly outlines some preparation techniques to introduce OVs into MOS, and the characterization techniques to identify and quantify the OVs in MOS. The applications of OVs contained MOS especially in energy and environmental catalysis areas are also discussed. The effects of OVs types and concentrations on the catalytic performances are deliberated. Finally, the defective structure-catalytic property relationship is highlighted, and the future status and opportunities of MOS containing OVs in the catalytic field are suggested.

Herein, a novel three-dimensional (3D) bifunctional electrocatalyst was prepared by embedding CoO nanoparticles into nitrogen and sulfur co-doped carbon nanofiber networks (denoted as CoO@N/S-CNF) through a facile approach. The carbon nanofiber networks were derived from a nano-structured biological material which provided abundant functional groups to nucleate and anchor nanoparticles while retaining its interconnected 3D porous structure. The composite possesses a high specific surface area and graphitization degree, which favors both mass transport and charge transfer for electrochemical reaction. The CoO@N/S-CNF not only exhibits highly efficient catalytic activity towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media with an onset potential of about 0.84 V, but also shows better stability and stronger resistance to methanol than Pt/C. Furthermore, it only needs an overpotential of 1.55 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), suggesting that it is an efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The Delta E value (oxygen electrode activity parameter) of CoO@N/S-CNF is calculated to be 0.828 V, which demonstrates that the composite could be a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for both ORR and OER.

However, due to the complicated diffusion behavior of gas at the dynamic catalytic interfaces, it is still a great challenge to accurately portray mass transfer of gas during electrocatalysis process. Here, we track the diffusion of dissolved oxygen on Cu nanostructured plasmonic interface, which reveals multistage oxygen diffusion behaviors, including premature oxygen accumulation, spontaneous diffusion and accelerated oxygen dissipation. This work uncovers an accumulating inhibition effect on oxygen evolution arising from interfacial dissolved oxygen. With these knowledges, we develop a programmable potential scan strategy to eliminate interfacial gas products, which alleviates the concentration polarization, releases accessible actives sites and promotes electrocatalytic performance. Our findings provide a direct observation of the interfacial mass transfer processes that governs the kinetics of gas-involved multiphases catalysis. Understanding mass transfer processes concomitant with gas evolution reactions is important in energy research. Here, the authors show diffusion tracking of dissolved oxygen on copper nanostructured interface with plasmonic signal, and provide a direct observation of the interfacial mass transfer processes.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2041-1723			WOS:000640906500018	33846310

However, beyond the ORR, the development of carbon-based catalysts for other electrocatalytic reactions is still limited. More importantly, the intrinsic activity of most carbon-based metal-free catalysts is inadequate compared to their metal-based counterparts. To address this challenge, more design strategies are needed in order to improve the overall performance of carbon-based materials. Herein, using water splitting as an example, some state-of-the-art strategies in promoting carbon-based nanomaterials are summarized, including graphene, carbon nanotubes, and graphitic-carbon nitride, as highly active electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions. It is shown that by rationally tuning the electronic and/or physical structure of the carbon nanomaterials, adsorption of reaction intermediates is optimized, consequently improving the apparent electrocatalytic performance. These strategies may facilitate the development in this area and lead to the discovery of advanced carbon-based nanomaterials for various applications in energy-conversion processes.									173	6	0	0	7	0	173			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000463970200002	30276904

Herein, a systematic investigation of bimetallic Ir-based thin films was performed to identify activity and stability trends across material systems for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media. Electron beam evaporation was used to co-deposit metallic films of Ir, IrSn2, IrCr, IrTi, and IrNi. The electrocatalytic activity of the electrochemically oxidized alloys was found to increase in the following order: IrTi < IrSn2 < Ir similar to IrNi < IrCr. The IrCr system demonstrates two times the catalytic activity of Ir at 1.65 V versus RHE. Density functional theory calculations suggest that this enhancement is due to Cr active sites that have improved oxygen binding energetics compared to those of pure Ir oxide. This work identifies IrCr as a promising new catalyst system that facilitates reduced precious metal loadings for acid-based OER catalysis.									37	0	0	0	1	0	38			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000487179900057	31442022

Wettability is an important property for describing the balance of a gas-liquid-solid system. Therefore, the wettability of reaction interface, especially hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, plays an important role in the adsorption/desorption process of gas bubbles on the surface of the solid electrode. Herein, we present a comprehensive review of the wettability control of the electrode materials applied in electrocatalysis reactions, including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). Firstly, the basic theories of wettability as well as the impact on electrocatalysis were introduced in this review. Secondly, the overview of modifying methods of the wettability from electrocatalyst microstructure (structural modification, surface coating, introducing hydrophilic groups) and system design (electrode, device) were suggested. At last, the deficiencies and problems in the application of wettability control are discussed, and deeper and broader application prospects are proposed.

Zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIFs) are generally employed as ideal platforms for the design and fabrication of energy-related catalysts by exploiting their porous structure with high surface area and flexibility. This work presents the preparation of NiFe-bimetallic species decorated N-doped porous carbon composite (NiFe@NPC) through pyrolyzing the NiFe-coordinated ZIF precursor. The obtained NiFe@NPC shows a larger surface area and porous nanostructure comprising the active bimetallic species evenly distributed in the conductive carbon matrix. The nanocomposite demonstrates excellent trifunctional catalytic activity toward ORR, OER, and HER. For ORR, NiFe@NPC offers a half-wave potential value of 0.87 V, which is positively shifted by 30 mV relative to that of Pt/C in 1 M KOH. NiFe@NPC exhibits OER activity with superior overpotential, reaction kinetics, and durability to those of IrO2. It also demonstrates the desirable HER activity with a low overpotential of 150 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and excellent durability in an acidic electrolyte. Additionally, the water-splitting configuration and zinc-air battery assembled with NiFe@NPC catalyst reveal superior performance to noble-metal catalysts. Such excellent electrocatalytic performance can be attributed to the distinct chemical composition of evenly distributed bimetallic active sites on highly conductive carbon sheets, and the porous nanostructure with large surface area and fast mass transfer.

Anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as a half-reaction of water electrolysis involving the transfer of four electrons, is thermodynamically slow, leading to its poor performance. To solve this difficult problem, many oxygen evolutions of electrocatalytic materials have emerged, especially some three-dimensional materials, which can easily interact with nickel-iron, owing to advantages of controllable electronic channels and three-dimensional structures. But, the weak elec-trical conductivity and thermodynamic instability directly lead to weak oxygen evolution properties. Various modification methods have been invested, such as additions of transition metal cations or non-metal anions, the introduction of the conductive supports or agents, adjustment with the three-dimensional structures, formation of heterojunctions, etc, which can complement each other's superiorities, thus improving the oxygen evolution performances. The successful modification of these materials can illustrate the great opportunities for oxygen evolution functional materials, which also supplies a great possibility to replace the expensive electrocatalysts in the future. More importantly, catalytic composite materials have taken a firm step in the field of low-carbon environmental protection and green energy materials, meanwhile playing an important role in the field of artificial and sustainable energy development.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2213-2929	2213-3437		WOS:000870248700001

Here, we report on a bifunctional catalyst based on Ir-doped NiV layered double hydroxide with Ir-O-V catalytic groups on which water dissociation, HER, and OER occur on Ir, bridge O, and V atoms, respectively. Interestingly, the dopant Ir ions were found to play a triple role: (i) serve as catalytic sites for water dissociation, (ii) reduce charge density on adjacent bridge oxygen, thus facilitating HER there, and (iii) increase charge density on V ions, which in turn boosts OER. As a result, the catalyst achieves an ultralow applied voltage for overall water splitting (1.49 V @ 10 mA cm(-2)) and beats the noble metallic couple Pt/C and Ir/C with its value of 1.60 V @ 10 mA cm(-2).									86	2	0	0	5	0	85			2380-8195			WOS:000480672800005

However, the organic materials, which are used during the synthesis of metallic nanostructures, need to be completely eliminated to obtain cleaned surface states for effective catalytic reactions in aqueous atmospheres. Herein, we synthesize Ptlr nanostructures using a thermal decomposition method, followed by a heating process of the nanostructures under an air atmosphere to eliminate the organic materials covering the surface of Ptlr catalysts. The heated Ptlr alloy nanostructure catalysts represent the superior oxygen reduction and evolution performance due to an increased electrochemical active surface area caused by the complete removal of organic materials.

In this context, the selectivity toward chlorine evolution reaction (CER) during seawater electrolysis using electrodeposited Cu-doped RuO2 with lower doping concentration (2%) has been found to better than RuO2. Though Cu does not behave as an active site it reduces the binding energy of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) related intermediates (e.g. HO-, O-, HOO-) in neighboring Ru active sites and promotes both specific activity and selectivity of CER as suggested by both experimental and Density Functional Theory studies. However, due to aliovalent nature of Cu-dopant in RuO2 host, phase segregation and surface enrichment of dopants occur with increase in dopant concentration which reduces the overall activity and selectivity toward CER. Furthermore, increase in Cu-dopant would lower surface oxygen vacancy formation energy and promotes additional lattice-oxygen-vacancy aided water dissociation pathway resulting in enhancement of selectivity of OER. The present work offers insight on catalyst design taking account of selectivity of chlorine and oxygen evolution during seawater electrolysis. (C) The Author(s) 2018.

Herein, a hierarchical carbon architecture that comprises of 1D tubes and 2D sheets supported on Ni-Co oxide is synthesized. The 1D-2D carbon nanostructures further support homogeneously dispersed Co/Ni-N-x centers, NiCo and its oxide nanoparticles that are beneficial for ORR, HER, and OER, respectively. The hierarchical nanostructures offer highly exposed surface that enables the maximum utility of active sites for different reactions and also provide a single platform that can be used as OER-ORR and OER-HER bifunctional catalyst for metal- air batteries and electrolyzers, respectively. The catalyst displays a low Delta E (E-J(OER) = 10 - E-1/2(ORR)) of 0.846 V for bifunctional OER-ORR and low potential of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting with appreciable durability for 40 h. Overall, the nanostructures exhibit remarkable activity and are durable for OER, ORR, and HER. Moreover, the study offers a pathway to expand the functionality of the non-noble electrocatalyst and simultaneously offers a platform to prove that preferential active sites exist for different reactions.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2196-7350			WOS:000775954900001

When LSCO single-crystal rods are sliced along the (001), (110), and (111) planes of a high-temperature cubic structure, we obtain crystal electrodes that can be denoted (001)(C), (110)(C), and (111)(C), respectively. The catalytic activities for oxygen evolution occur in the order (110)(C)> (001)(C)approximate to(111)(C). Although the currents for oxygen reduction on LSCO single crystals are hardly observed, their activities are enhanced when carbon is placed on the crystal surfaces. These results clearly show that the oxygen evolution activities of LSCO electrodes are dependent on their crystal planes, whereas their oxygen reduction activities rely on the interplay between carbon and LSCO. These findings may contribute toward the development of an effective electrocatalyst for rechargeable air electrodes.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			2196-0216			WOS:000371254600005

Herein, we report photoelectrochemical hydrogen production in alkaline solutions, which are more favorable than acidic solutions for the complementary oxygen evolution half-reaction. We show for the first time that amorphous molybdenum sulfide is a highly active hydrogen evolution catalyst in basic medium. The amorphous molybdenum sulfide catalyst and a Ni-Mo catalyst are then deposited on surface-protected cuprous oxide photocathodes to catalyze sunlight-driven hydrogen production in 1M KOH.

In the past, h-BN has mainly been regarded as inert materials because of the poor conductivity and is mainly used commercially as insulators. However, recent advances in materials science and nanotechnology have unveiled exciting applications of h-BN by taking advantage of the unique chemical and electrochemical properties, high thermal stability, as well as environmental friendliness. In the energy field, h-BN has not been researched as extensively as other 2D materials such as graphene and there have been few comprehensive reviews discussing the various aspects of the materials and applications. The objective of this review is to summarize recent results and applications of this unique class of materials and to provide guidance to future research and development of green energy systems based on h-BN. We first describe the physical and chemical modification strategies to convert insulating h-BN into the desirable conductive materials suitable for energy conversion. In addition to functionalization strategies, different synthetic methods and important prop-erties of h-BN are reviewed. We then describe recent progress and applications of h-BN as electrocatalysts in energy applications, including the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). The electrocatalytic mechanisms and impact on the materials performance are discussed and finally, the chal-lenges and prospects for modified h-BN in the energy conversion field are discussed.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000720172300001

Recently, phosphorus (P)-based materials have drawn tremendous attention as a class of promising electrocatalysts and presented intrinsic electrochemical activity and widely tunable property. In a timely response to the ongoing interests, issues faced in P-based inorganic materials, and the approaches to address them in relation to energy conversion reactions, including hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and oxygen reduction reaction are investigated. The emphasis is focused on the key strategies to modulate black phosphorus, metal phosphides, and phosphates-based electrocatalysts, although it is impossible to include all possible P-compounds. The strategies are analyzed and discussed in four aspects, namely, morphological engineering, tuning in crystallinity, compositional tailoring, and material hybridization. They are aimed to modulate the key parameters involved in electrocatalysis, such as the adsorption energy, and density of the active sites, electrical conductivity, and durability of these P-based inorganic electrocatalysts. With the thorough understandings established for the rational design of the efficient electrocatalysts, the challenges and perspectives in the future development of these high-performance P-based systems are briefly looked into.									20	1	0	0	1	0	20			2196-7350			WOS:000555449700001

Herein, we report that stronger electron-electron correlation leads to higher OER activity by a systematic electrochemical study of Ca1-xSrxRuO3. Specifically, we find that when the conducting material is sufficiently near the metal-insulator boundary (Ca0.9Sr0.1RuO3 in this study), it leads to a remarkable activity enhancement by a factor of 17. Our finding suggests that electron correlation not only enhances the initial OER activity but also stabilizes the structure of the catalyst. Therefore, the coexistence of metallic conductivity and strong electron correlation is beneficial for developing highly active OER catalysts. Furthermore, the excellent OER activity at x similar to 0.1 is accompanied by superior bifunctionality toward the OER and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Our study also revealed that conducting materials close to the metal-insulator boundary are promising oxygen reaction catalysts for energy conversion technologies.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000473054500043

Current research on achieving high performance M-N-Cs is based on two aspects: one is to increase the density of active sites through a selection of appropriate precursors and smart design of the synthetic method, and the other is to boost the intrinsic activity of active sites through electronic structure modulation. In this review, we focus on the latter one and comprehensively summarize the reported strategies, including a judicious choice of central metal ions, modification of the carbon basal plane, and adjustment of the coordination environment of central metal ions, for achieving the optimized electronic structures of M-N-Cs and further correlate these structures with improved electrocatalytic performances, providing an in-depth understanding of M-N-Cs at the atomic level. Finally, to promote the practical application of M-N-Cs in clean and renewable energy conversion and storage technologies, some remaining challenges and future opportunities are pointed out.									26	0	0	0	0	0	26			2051-6347	2051-6355		WOS:000526652900021

In this manuscript, we successfully develop and fabricate an earth abundant Ni-Mo-S based electrocatalyst that is bifunctionally active for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by water splitting in alkaline electrolyte (1M NaOH). Such an electrocatalyst demonstrates the capability for water splitting in alkaline electrolyte with an applied potential of 1.539 V at the current density of 10 mA/cm2 when used as both anode and cathode. Though detailed studies in the reaction mechanism are still further required, the results suggest that the geometrical high surface area and the modified electronic structures and surface chemistry are very important in designing bifunctional electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1938-5862			INSPEC:19827825

To enhance AEMWE performance, the effects of the membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) fabrication method, operating conditions, and MEA parameters were examined. As a result of the optimization and the use of FAA-3-50 and FAA-3-Br as the AEM and anion-exchange ionomer, respectively, AEMWE showed the highest performance reported thus far. Single-cell tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results indicate that optimized AEMWE minimized the ohmic, charge-transfer, and mass transport resistances.

Typically, during the synthesis process, the functional group -NH2 from the external anchor formamide acts as a coordination site to control the nucleation and growth of nanoparticles, which can ensure high dispersion without aggregation of IrO2 on SL-NiFe LDHs. In addition, this reducing synthetic environment causes a large number of holes and grooves in the NiFe-LDHs nanosheets, which result in the formation of oxygen vacancies in the SL-NiFe LDHs. The loading of IrO2 nanoparticles and the formation of oxygen vacancies endow IrO2@SL-NiFe LDHs with excellent performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). IrO2@SL-NiFe LDHs nanosheets display outstanding OER performance with an overpotential of 270 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and good stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the hybridization of IrO2 and SL-NiFe LDHs accelerates the reaction step. Notably, the Ir sites at the edges are more conducive to the formation of oxygen, and the oxygen sites on SL-NiFe LDHs are more conducive to the cleavage of the O-H bond, thereby improving the OER activity. This work highlights a potential synthetic strategy that can combine nanoprecious metals with transition metals to prepare highly active electrocatalysts for efficient water oxidation reactions.									32	1	0	0	5	0	32			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000561598900009

This is crucial even for the development of electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) using three-electrode configuration because damaged surfaces of counter electrodes (CEs), which exposed to electrochemical oxidative environments often limit the performance of cathodes in working electrodes (WEs) by lowering the electrical conductivity and poisoning the surface of electrocatalysts. Herein, we demonstrate the use of IrxTa100-xOy as a CE in simulated seawater. IrxTa100-xOy-coated electrodes as CEs with optimized Ir:Ta ratios enable the high-valence states of Ir for improving activity and selectivity toward the OER. Moreover, the IrxTa100-xOy CEs ensure unhindered electrochemical performance of Pt for HER in contrast to carbon-based materials, thus highlighting their reliability as a CE.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0253-2964	1229-5949		WOS:000869032100001

This article summarizes recent progress and achievements in the development of strain-rich electrocatalysts (SREs) and their applications in the field of electrochemical energy conversion technologies. It starts from the definition of lattice strains, followed by the classification of lattice strains where the mechanisms of strain formation and the reported methods to regulate related strains are elaborated. The SRE characterization techniques are overviewed, focusing deeply on the clarification of the strain-property relationship of these SREs. Their applications for different electrocatalytic reactions are further highlighted, including the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, alcohol oxidation reaction, electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction, and nitrogen reduction reaction. Related reaction mechanisms of the SREs are interpreted after taking catalytic performance, as well as the relationship between the SRE properties and their strains into account. The challenges and future opportunities to regulate SREs are finally outlined and discussed together with their potential applications in different fields.									5	1	0	0	0	0	6			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000732713500001

OER activity of transition metal sulfides (TMSs) can be improved by compositing with highly conductive supports possessing a high surface-to-volume ratio, such as reduced graphene oxide (rGO). Herein we report on the relationship between synthetic conditions and the OER catalytic properties of TMSs and rGO (TMS-rGO) hybrids. Starting materials, reaction temperature and reaction time were controlled to synergistically boost the OER catalytic activity of TMS-rGO hybrids. Our results showed that (i) compared with sulfides, hydroxides are favourable as starting materials to produce the desired TMS-rGO hybrid nanostructure and (ii) high reaction temperatures and longer reaction times can increase physicochemical interaction between TMSs and rGO supports, resulting in highly efficient OER catalytic activity.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2054-5703			WOS:000446259700052	30839659

Here, we designed an efficient Co3O4 electrocatalyst using a pyrolysis strategy for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Morphological characterization confirmed the ultra-thin structure of nanosheet. Further, the existence of oxygen vacancies was obviously evidenced by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electron spin resonance spectroscopy. The increased surface area of Co3O4 ensures more exposed sites, whereas generated oxygen vacancies on Co3O4 surface create more active defects. The two scenarios were beneficial for accelerating the OER across the interface between the anode and electrolyte. As expected, the optimized Co3O4 nanosheets can catalyze the OER efficiently with a low overpotential of 310 mV at current density of 10 mA/cm(2) and remarkable long-term stability in 1.0 mol/L KOH.									16	2	0	0	2	0	19			1674-0068	1003-7713		WOS:000445660500019

State of the art noble metal catalysts for these reactions are fraught with issues whereas, metal oxides are expected to be stable in large potential window and can be tuned to have better bifunctional activity. Catalytically active metals, redox centres, oxygen vacancies etc. are some of the features of structured oxides which can be exploited in oxygen electrocatalysis. Brownmillerite family of compounds with general formula, A2B2O5 has high concentrations of ordered oxygen vacancy in a layer and can be promising bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts, by appropriate B site doping. Ba2In2O5 is a well-studied system for its oxide ion conductivity and proximity of active B sites to O vacancies provide good O adsorption sites which are catalytically active. Here, cobalt and cerium are co-doped in Ba2In2O5, anticipating a synergistic effect of Ce(III)/ Ce(IV) redox centre in ORR and Co activity in OER along with O vacancies providing adsorption sites. We have studied the structural changes associated with the doping by Rietveld refinement of the XRD patterns and correlated the structure to bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic activity which is found to enhance on increasing the Co and Ce content.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000668217200007

Particularly challenging is the oxygen evolution reaction which imposes high demands on the long-term activity of electrocatalysts and electrode support materials. To cross the "Rubicon" and in a deterministic manner claim that we developed principles of rational catalyst design, we need first to comprehend the determinants of electrocatalytic activity as well as character of their time evolution. How reliable are reported activity and stability trends, could we interrelate activity and stability, and how meaningful that relation really is are some of the important questions that have to be tackled in building of a more comprehensive view on critically important anodic oxygen evolution.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			2296-598X			WOS:000616381500001

Herein, we report changes in the oxygen-vacancy ratio during long-term stability tests. NiFe-based electrocatalysts containing various anions were prepared by a simple electrodeposition. After the fabrication procedure was optimized, the S-doped NiFe oxide electrocatalyst exhibited higher intrinsic activity than others in an alkaline electrolyte because it had the highest oxygen-vacancy ratio. During oxygen evolution at a constant positive potential, the intrinsic activity of the S-doped NiFe oxide electrocatalyst showed a significant correlation with the oxygen-vacancy ratio and surface morphology as a function of time.

J	Xiao, Liyuan; Wang, Zhenlu; Guan, Jingqi								2D MOFs and their derivatives for electrocatalytic applications: Recent advances and new challenges								COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS				472						214777	10.1016/j.ccr.2022.214777				DEC 1 2022	2022	Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising electrocatalysts due to their high porosity, large specific surface area and adjustable structure. Especially, two-dimensional (2D) MOFs with ultra-thin structure provide more active sites and shorter diffusion distance for heterogeneous catalytic reactions. However, the poor conductivity and poor stability of 2D MOFs impede their practical electrocatalytic applications greatly. Therefore, 2D MOF-derived transition metal carbides, sulfides, phosphides, oxides, and single-atom catalysts have been fabricated by carbonization, vulcanization, phosphorization or oxidation strategies, which improve the conductivity and stability significantly. Here, the synthesis strategies of 2D MOFs and their derivatives are summarized, and the factors affecting the geometries and electronic structures of active sites are commented in detail. The electrocatalytic applications of 2D MOFs and their derivatives in oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) are reviewed. The effect of the geometric construction and electronic configuration of active sites (including metals, nonmetals, and defects) of 2D MOFs and their derivatives on the electrocatalytic performance is detailedly discussed by combining experimental achievements and theoretical analysis. Finally, the development prospects and challenges of 2D MOFs and their derivatives are proposed. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

In the rod structure, Ni(II) intercalates in the defective perovskite-type WO2.72 and is stabilized. The NixWO2.72 NRs show the x-dependent electrocatalysis for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 0.1 M KOH with NixWO2.72 being the most efficient, even outperforming the commercial Ir-catalyst. The synthesis is not limited to NixWO2.72 but can be extended to MxWO2.72 (M = Co, Fe) as well, providing a new class of oxide-based catalysts for efficient OER and other energy conversion reactions.

Engineering metal-based nano-architectures and their atomic-scale surfaces is a promising approach for designing electrocatalysts. Single metal atom interactions with substrates and reaction environments crucially modulate the surface electronic properties of active metal centers, yielding controllable scaling relationships and transitions between different reaction mechanisms that improve catalytic activity. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) allow activity and selectivity tuning while maintaining relatively consistent morphologies. SACs have well-defined configurations and active centers within homogeneous single-atom dispersions, producing exceptional selectivities, activities, and stabilities. Furthermore, SACs with high per-atom utilization efficiencies, well-controlled substrate compositions, and engineered surface structures develop single atom active sites for molecular reactions, enhancing mass activities. Recent developments in different metal-based SAC nanostructures are discussed to explain their remarkable bi-functional electrocatalytic activities and high mechanical flexibility, especially in the oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, and in battery applications. Existing barriers to and future insights into improving SAC performance are addressed. This study develops practical and fundamental insights on single atom electrocatalysts directed towards tuning their electrocatalytic activities and enhancing their stabilities.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000690689200001

However, the water splitting kinetics is slow, and noble metal catalysts such as platinum (Pt), ruthenium (IV) oxide (RuO2)/ iridium (IV) oxide (IrO2) are typically required to improve water splitting efficiency. Therefore, non-noble metals such as cobalt (Co)-based catalysts with a lower cost, natural abundance, catalytic performance comparable to that of noble metal catalysts, and good structural stability are highly desirable as substitutes for the expensive and environmentally scarce noble metals in energy applications. In this review, recent progress pertaining to the advance and development of different types of Co-based catalysts is reviewed. In addition, the fundamental mechanisms of water electrolysis and ways to improve the HER/OER activity are discussed. Finally, the present challenge and prospective for the future development of water splitting electrocatalysts are discussed. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Valizadeh, Amirreza; Najafpour, Mohammad Mahdi								Is nickel phosphide an efficient catalyst for the oxygen-evolution reaction at low overpotentials?								NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY				44	45			19630	19641		10.1039/d0nj03701j				DEC 7 2020	2020	Recently, metal phosphides have been reported as a new class of oxygen-evolving (pre)catalysts with superior electrochemical activity. Herein, the oxygen-evolution reaction in the presence of Ni2P was investigated, using scanning electron microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, spectroelectrochemistry, energy dispersive spectrometry, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electrochemical methods. Under the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER), Ni2P was converted to nickel (hydr)oxide, which is an efficient catalyst for the OER only in the presence of Fe ions. The addition of Fe salt is a method proposed for detecting the conversion of Ni2P to Ni (hydr)oxide under the OER at low overpotentials. The different electrochemical methods showed that the thin and amorphous layer of Ni (hydr)oxide coupled with the high conductivity of Ni2P made core (Ni2P)-shell (Ni (hydr)oxide, 0.5-5 nm) type nanoparticles excellent substrates for adsorbing Fe ions and formed an excellent oxygen-evolving compound. The overpotential of the onset for the oxygen-evolution reaction in the presence of these nanoparticles was 217 mV in KOH (0.10 M).									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000594503300019

However, the formation of CaO in the CaSO4 reduction process by side reactions can cause sulfur species evolution and decrease its reactivity. An innovative method was investigated by means of adding hematite together with the CaSO4 to be combined oxygen carriers in CLC of coal. The objective was to decrease sulfur species evolution and increase the coal conversion. Experiments were performed in a batch fluidized-bed reactor at atmospheric pressure. Ten reduction/oxidation cycles confirmed the occurrences of side reactions toward sulfur species evolution, although the CaSO4 oxygen carrier showed an increasing reactivity in the initial cycles. With the addition of hematite, the gaseous sulfur species evolution was remarkably decreased in both reduction and oxidation processes during the cycles, while the coal conversion and CO2 capture were enhanced. The extensive physical and chemical properties of the oxygen carrier were characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD) analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) analysis to detect the mechanism. It was not the desulfurization capacity of iron oxide that lowered sulfur species emission but the suppression of the side reactions by adding hematite.									27	9	0	0	2	0	34			0888-5885			WOS:000316594200013

Here we present a nanostructured cathode based on molybdenum carbide nanoparticles (Mo2C) dispersed on carbon nanotubes, which dramatically increase the electrical efficiency up to 88% with a cycle life of more than 100 cycles. We found that the Mo2C nanoparticle catalysts contribute to the formation of well-dispersed lithium peroxide nanolayers (Li2O2) on the Mo2C/carbon nanotubes with a large contact area during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). This Li2O2 structure can be decomposed at low potential upon the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by avoiding the energy loss associated with the decomposition of the typical Li2O2 discharge products.									189	13	0	0	11	0	189			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000353867000078	25801846

We synthesized and fully characterized an electropolymerisable monomer bearing a pendant terpyridine unit for the selective complexation of PGMs. Electrocatalytic tests of the resulting metallopolymer, poly-[(tThTerpy)PtCl]Cl, revealed activity both in the oxygen reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction. Rotating disk experiments showed the direct four-electron reduction of molecular oxygen to water at low angular velocities of the rotating electrode. Furthermore, the fabrication of Pt metallopolymers proved to be simple, nonhazardous and versatile. This proof-of-concept opens up the possibility for developing future low-cost electro-and photocatalysts to replace current systems.									21	0	0	0	1	0	22			2168-0485			WOS:000414825900075

The solid-state voltammetric response of different hematite and ochre specimens, accompanied by SECM analysis in contact with 0.10 M HCl aqueous solution, is described. In air-saturated solutions, catalytic effects on the ORR and OER are accompanied by Fe(III)/Fe(II) and Fe(IV)/Fe(III) redox reactions. Such processes are conditioned by a variety of factors, the hydroxylation degree of the mineral surfaces being particularly influential, and exhibit significant variations upon heating the specimens between 300 and 900 degrees C. Voltammetric measurements carried out on a set of archaeological samples of Apulian red-figured pottery dated back within 5(th) and 4(th) centuries BCE permit to obtain site-characteristic voltammetric profiles.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2196-0216			WOS:000718891700001

In this work, metallic Ir, IrOx(OH)(y), and core-shell Ir@IrOx(OH)(y) were synthesized and employed as OER catalysts for photocatalytic water oxidation. It was found that the Ir@IrOx(OH)(y) core-shell heterostructure catalyst showed the best photocatalytic performance among these three catalysts, with the oxygen evolution rate as high as 59.63 mmolg(-1)h(-1). Detailed investigations revealed that the excellent photocatalytic activity of Ir@IrOx(OH)(y) could be attributed to both the outstanding intrinsic activity of IrOx(OH)(y) shell and the efficient electron transfer between the photosensitizer and catalyst.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000440307900004	30015623

Here, the rational design of a Pd/NiO atomic interface with well patterned Pd arrays imbedded into NiO thin films are reported to boost the catalytic activity toward the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction. Theoretical analysis elucidates that the Pd (111)/NiO (111) interface with minimized lattice mismatch effectively adsorbs intermediates (OH*, LiO2*, Li2O2*, and Li2O*) and induces the growth/decomposition of electrochemical reaction products, which greatly lowers the Gibbs energy barrier of crucial steps and boosts the reaction kinetics. As expected, such hybrid thin films exhibit high catalytic activity for both the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, with performance comparable to the benchmarked Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts. Moreover, favorable performance is also achieved in both aqueous Zn-air batteries and aprotic Li-air batteries with an overpotential of only 0.69 and 0.50 V, respectively. This work suggests the great potential of such particularly morphological hybrid thin films in the development of high-performance catalysts for energy storage and conversion.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000707497900001

Herein, a hierarchical 1D/3D hollow carbon nanopolyhedron with strong electron coupling between the encapsulated CoNi alloy and Co-Nx sites in N-CNTs was designed by a silicon protection-Ni infiltration strategy. Impressively, the optimized CoNi/Co-N@HNC catalyst exhibits high oxygen catalytic activity with a small potential gap of 0.73 V and superior ZABs durability over 350 h. DFT simulation results revealed that coupling with CoNi nanoclusters can effectively downshift the Ed energy levels of the Co adsorption site in CoN4, dramatically decreased the energy barrier of the rate-determining step (OH* to OH- in ORR; OH* to O* in OER), thereby promote the overall oxygen catalysis reaction kinetics.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000790388000003

Due to the complexity of low-temperature oxidation of coal with many parallel reactions, it is difficult to directly investigate the heat evolution due to the reaction of coal with oxygen by conventional analytical method. Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) was introduced in this study to study the intrinsic exothermic reaction of coal with oxygen based on the heat evolution. Using the subtraction analysis method of DSC, the DSC-subtraction curves can be obtained by subtracting the DSC-N-2 curves from the DSC-air curves. Experimental results indicate that the DSC-subtraction curve can better reflect the intrinsic exothermic reaction of coal oxidation than a DSC-air curve by eliminating the influence of evaporation of water and thermal decomposition of inherent functional groups. The experiment factors affecting the intrinsic reaction were also investigated with the subtraction method of DSC. In terms of the kinetics characteristics of heat evolution, the intrinsic reaction of coal with oxygen is divided into three stages: slow oxidation stage, advanced oxidation stage, and rapid oxidation stage. The activation energies and pre-exponent factors at each of the stages were also calculated by oxidative pyrolysis kinetics. The subtraction method applied in this study is a quite promising method to determine the susceptibility of coal to self-heating and spontaneous combustion.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0010-2202	1563-521X		WOS:000523741400001

In this work, porous MCo2O4 (M = Zn, Cu, Fe, Mn) were prepared by hydrothermal method with NH4F and urea as surfactants. FeCo(2)O(4)with porous structure has more oxygen defects and the larger specific surface area than other MCo2O4 (M = Zn, Cu, Mn), and it not onlysupplies more active sites but also avails the transmission of electrolyte and O-2 in the process of ORR and OER in 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution. Porous FeCo2O4 electrode material produces less intermediate H2O2, and its ORR is mainly controlled by a 4e(-) reaction path. Compared with commercial Pt/C, the prepared FeCo2O4 has comparable ORR activity and excellent OER activity. At the same time, the stability of FeCo2O4 to ORR is significantly higher than that of commercial Pt/C. The porous FeCo2O4 was prepared by facile synthesis procedure could be a potential promising bi-functional catalyst due to its high electrocatalytic activities and long-term stability for both the ORR and OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000843301700001	35914509

Herein, we have reported an efficient manganese and cobalt bimetallic phosphate electrocatalyst synthesized on an electrodeposited PANI nanowire array for TWS. The hierarchical morphology and higher Mn3+ and Co2+/Co3+ ratio on catalyst surface enhance faster charge transfer kinetic rate for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We achived a lower overpotential of 109 mV and Tafel value of 99 mV/Dec for HER application, whereas Mn1.5Co1.5 showed an excellent OER performance with overpotential of 254 mV and Tafel value of 36 mV/Dec. Further, the fabricated electrolyzer achieved a cell voltage of 1.54 V to attain a density of 10 mA/cm2 with an impressive durability of 40 h at 100 mA/cm2.

Herein, we synthesized hydrotalcite-like Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets growing on Ni foam (Ni(OH)(2)/NF) via a facile one-pot hydrothermal method. With the assistance of a rotating oven, Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets demonstrate a regular hexagonal morphology and homogeneous distribution. The resultant Ni(OH)(2)/NF electrode shows superior electrocatalytic activity and durability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as well as the overall water splitting. The Ni(OH)(2)/NF electrode delivers 20 mA.cm(-2) at an overpotential of 172 mV for HER, 50 mA.cm(-2) at an overpotential of 330 mV for OER, and 10 mA.cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.68 V for water electrolysis in 1.0 M KOH.

The reason for this unclear. Here, we performed an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on clean and oxygen deficient (100), (110), and (111) surfaces on STO by density functional theory. Combining our results with experimental results in the literature, we demonstrated that the overpotential is small enough for OER to occur on (100) surfaces. There is no photoactivity due to the photogenerated holes that cannot migrate to the (100) surfaces. On the (110) and (111) surfaces, the overpotential is very high, which prevents the OER from taking place on these two surfaces. Our work gives a guidance principle to understand the water splitting from the overpotential of OER and migrating photogenerated carriers. It may be helpful to design high efficiency photocatalysts based on STO.									10	1	0	0	0	0	9			2168-0485			WOS:000486565900023

Many methods, such as engineering heterostructure and introducing oxygen vacancy, have been used to improve the catalytic performance of electrocatalysts for OER. Herein, the above two kinds of regulation are simultaneously realized in a catalyst by using unique ion irradiation technology. A nanosheet structured NiO/NiFe2O4 heterostructure with rich oxygen vacancies converted from nickel-iron layered double hydroxides by Ar+ ions irradiation shows significant enhancement in both OER and hydrogen evolution reaction performance. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the construction of NiO/NiFe2O4 can optimize the free energy of O* to OOH* process during OER reaction. The oxygen vacancy-rich NiO/NiFe2O4 nanosheets have an overpotential of 279 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 42 mV dec(-1). Moreover, this NiO/NiFe2O4 electrode shows an excellent long-term stability at 100 mA cm(-2) for 450 h. The synergetic effects between NiO and NiFe2O4 make NiO/NiFe2O4 heterostructure have high conductivity and fast charge transfer, abundant active sites, and high catalytic reactivity, contributing to its excellent performance.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000685859300001	34405527

At present, IrO2 and Pt/C are regarded as the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively, but their poor durability and high cost severely impede the wide applications. Thus, constructing highly active, stable, and low-cost electrocatalysts for OER and HER is significantly important. Herein, the synthesis methods, construction of active sites, and catalytic coupling mechanisms for water splitting are fully summarized. In particular, the alloy effect, interface effect, various defects, and doping effects in electrocatalysts are the main reasons to improve the intrinsic catalytic activities. Finally, the future development trend of electrochemical catalysts for water splitting is prospected in the conclusion. It is believed that a comprehensive understanding of materials design strategies is provided, which is beneficial to the development of water splitting.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000606486100001

Room temperature water electrolysis is an interesting alternative for renewable electricity storage, even if it is well-known that high-temperature systems are more efficient. To address this issue, we studied different non-platinum group metal (non-PGM) catalysts for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by recording cyclic voltamperograms with a rotating disk electrode set up. Physicochemical characterizations of Ni-based and FeNi3-based catalysts were performed using transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). Ni synthesized by the hot injection method is a good catalyst for HER, yet still less active than Pt/C. FeNi3 with and without a Ni surface doping is very good OER catalysts, slightly better than commercial unsupported IrO2. Electrochemical tests under alternating magnetic field (AMF) using these nanoparticles are ongoing, as these materials are compatible with AMF activation.									7	1	0	0	1	0	7			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000546911100001

Current understanding of the OER mechanism based on oxygen adsorption on a metallic surface site fails to fully explain the activity of iridium and ruthenium oxide surfaces, and the drastic surface reconstruction observed for the most active OER catalysts. Here we demonstrate, using La2LiIrO6 as a model catalyst, that the exceptionally high activity found for Ir-based catalysts arises from the formation of active surface oxygen atoms that act as electrophilic centres for water to react. Moreover, with the help of transmission electron microscopy, we observe drastic surface reconstruction and iridium migration from the bulk to the surface. Therefore, we establish a correlation between surface activity and surface stability for OER catalysts that is rooted in the formation of surface reactive oxygen.									288	10	0	0	24	0	288			2058-7546			WOS:000396303000002

Transition metal sites with high valence states can accelerate the reaction kinetics to offer highly intrinsic activity, but suffer from thermodynamic formation barrier. Here, we show subtle engineering of highly oxidized Ni4+ species in surface reconstructed (oxy)hydroxides on multicomponent FeCoCrNi alloy film through interatomically electronic interplay. Our spectroscopic investigations with theoretical studies uncover that Fe component enables the formation of Ni4+ species, which is energetically favored by the multistep evolution of Ni2+-> Ni3+-> Ni4+. The dynamically constructed Ni4+ species drives holes into oxygen ligands to facilitate intramolecular oxygen coupling, triggering lattice oxygen activation to form Fe-Ni dual-sites as ultimate catalytic center with highly intrinsic activity. As a result, the surface reconstructed FeCoCrNi OER catalyst delivers outstanding mass activity and turnover frequency of 3601A g(metal)(-1) and 0.483s(-1) at an overpotential of 300mV in alkaline electrolyte, respectively. Electrocatalytic water oxidation is facilitated by high valence states, but these are challenging to achieve at low applied potentials. Here, authors report a multicomponent FeCoCrNi alloy with dynamically formed Ni4+ species to offer high catalytic activity via lattice oxygen activation mechanism.									141	6	0	0	13	0	141			2041-1723			WOS:000564248600004	32792524

Here, we present a general and scalable strategy for the synthesis of transition metal phosphide electrodes based on the reaction of commercially available metal foils (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and NiFe) with various organophosphine reagents. The resulting phosphide electrodes were found to exhibit excellent electrocatalytic HER and OER performance. The most active electrodes required over potentials of only 128 mV for the HER in acid (Ni2P), 183 mV for the HER in base (Ni2P), and 277 mV for the OER in base (NiFeP) to produce operationally relevant current densities of 10 mA cm(-2). Such HER and OER performance compares favorably with samples prepared using significantly more elaborate and costly procedures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the approach can also be utilized to obtain highly active and conformal metal phosphide coatings on photocathode materials, such as highly doped Si, that are relevant to solar fuels production.									208	13	0	0	12	0	209			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000376825800029	27156388

Herein, multifunctional active-center-transferable heterostructured electrocatalysts, platinum/lithium cobalt oxide (Pt/LiCoO2) composites with Pt nanoparticles (Pt NPs) anchored on LiCoO(2)nanosheets, are designed towards highly efficient water splitting. In this electrocatalyst system, the active center can be alternatively switched between Pt species and LiCoO(2)for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. Specifically, Pt species are the active centers and LiCoO(2)acts as the co-catalyst for HER, whereas the active center transfers to LiCoO(2)and Pt turns into the co-catalyst for OER. The unique architecture of Pt/LiCoO(2)heterostructure provides abundant interfaces with favorable electronic structure and coordination environment towards optimal adsorption behavior of reaction intermediates. The 30 % Pt/LiCoO(2)heterostructured electrocatalyst delivers low overpotentials of 61 and 285 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2)for HER and OER in alkaline medium, respectively.									83	8	0	0	5	0	84			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000544736400001	32485085

Several perovskites and other oxides of earth-abundant elements are found to exhibit improved catalytic OER activity. However, less attention is paid to the electrochemical stability, an important factor for large-scale application. The ongoing search for stable catalysts calls for characterizing active catalyst surfaces and identifying mechanisms of deactivation, activation, or repair. In situ techniques are indispensable for these tasks. This study uses environmental transmission electron microscopy on the highly correlated perovskite Pr1-xCaxMnO3 and the Ruddlesden-Popper Pr0.5Ca1.5MnO4 as model electrodes to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the stability trends identified on rotating ring disk electrodes. An electron beam at fluxes well below those that would cause radiation damage is used to induce positive local electrode potentials due to secondary electron emission, driving electrochemical reactions in H2O vapor. The stability of the model systems increases with increasing ionic character of the Mn-O bond, while more covalent bonds are prone to corrosion, which is triggered by formation of point defects in the oxygen sublattice.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			2366-7486			WOS:000424596200005

Recently, the reconstruction phenomenon of electrocatalysts during a catalytic reaction has been discovered, which could form reactive sites for both the oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions. Regulation of the reconstruction process to generate a large number of reactive species with high activity has since been demonstrated as an effective strategy to enhance the catalytic performance of electrocatalysts. This review summarizes recent progress in the regulation strategies for reconstruction reactions. First, the mechanism of water electrolysis is briefly introduced, and the critical factors regarding the reconstruction process are systematically discussed, followed by a brief introduction of advanced characterization for reconstruction. Moreover, the modulation strategies are summarized with reported examples highlighting the promoted effects on the reconstruction process. Finally, the challenges facing surface-reconstructed catalysts for water electrolysis in the future are discussed.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000823844100001

Here we report a novel mesoporous Co3O4 with the surface decoration of mixed CoOxPy species towards efficient OER catalysis. The material is synthesized from a simple carbon template derived from p-phenylenediamine bisulfate followed by low temperature phosphorization. Unlike traditional methods, silica intermediates are not involved during synthesis, improving the overall safety and efficiency. The as-prepared mesoporous Co3O4/CoOxPy catalyst shows excellent catalytic activity and stability towards oxygen evolution reaction in 1 M KOH. The overpotential is 295 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), superior to that of commercial IrO2/C catalyst. A small Tafel slope of 70 mV dec(-1) and high stability are also observed. The excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to the mesoporous structure, strong electronic interaction, and synergistic effect of the mesoporous Co3O4 and CoOxPy phases. Other heterogeneous catalysts with similar structures and compositions may also be fabricated following the same design principle.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2199-692X			WOS:000484140300001

We have investigated the effect of Ti functionalization on borophene monolayer from the perspective of HER and OER activities enhancement. We have probed the activities based on the reaction coordinate, which is conceptually related to the adsorption free energies of the intermediates of HER and OER, as well as from the vibrational frequency analysis with the corresponding charge transfer mechanism between the surface and the adsorbate. Tifunctionalized borophene has emerged as a promising material for HER and OER mechanisms. We believe that our probing method, based on reaction coordinate coupled with vibrational analysis that has been validated by the charge transfer mechanism, would certainly become as a robust prediction route for HER and OER mechanisms in coming days.									25	0	0	0	3	0	25			2574-0962			WOS:000458706400007

Recently, the transition metal dichalcogenide has attracted numerous attention and described as an effective and robust alternative to noble metal for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution. In this study, a novel structure of two-dimensional sheet-like NiSe2 nanoarchitecture integrating on three-dimensional carbon cloth has been fabricated via a facile two-step hydrothermal reaction. In addition, we research the phase structures and morphologies of nickel selenides were further controlled by adjusting the reaction temperature. Under certain conditions, orthorhombic NiSe2 nanosheets can convert into cubic NiSe2 nanosheets in solution directly. The series of nickel selenides have been investigated in detail by means of X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy analyses, respectively. Electrochemical experiments show the as-prepared pure cubic phase NiSe2 nanosheets-carbon cloth achieves-10 mAcm(-2) at an overpotential of 147mV (in 0.5MH(2)SO(4)) and 42 mV (in 1M KOH) for hydrogen evolution reaction, respectively. NiSe2 has an extremely small overpotential of 1.531 V at 40 mAcm(-2) in 1M KOH solution for oxygen evolution reaction. A voltage of only 1.62 V is required to drive 10mA cm(-2) for the two-electrode alkaline water electrolyzer using the cubic NiSe2 nanosheets on carbon cloth as an anode and cathode. This development provides us a fascinating non-noble-metal bifunctional electrocatalyst toward overall water splitting applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, Cu2S nanoparticles were prepared on Cu foam, forming a high-efficiency Cu2S/Cu foam robust pre-electrocatalysts. The Cu2S/Cu foam, as a new precatalyst for OER, presents an excellent efficiency with 373 mV of overpotential for 50 mA cm(-2), which is superior to RuO2 (400 mV). The Cu2S/Cu foam pre-electrocatalyst also demonstrates an impressive durability with a current retention of 86% after catalyzing OER for 60 h with a current density 60 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the structure, morphology and phase transformation of the pre-electrocatalyst during the OER operation were revealed. It was found that the Cu2S nanoparticles will evolve into sulfate ions embedded CuO nanowires that catalyze oxygen evolution reaction. It is believed that the evolution of Cu2S nanoparticles to sulfate ions embedded CuO involve the oxidation reaction under the high overpotential and the disproportionate reaction of Cu(I) species. The result suggests that hybridized cuprous sulfide/copper materials are attractive noble-metal-free pre-catalysts for water splitting. Our study may offer a new way to develop metal sulfide catalysts for high-performance water oxidation reaction.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000631644800002

The electrochemical evaluation reveals that (Ni, Co)(3)O-4 demonstrates a significantly positive-shifted ORR onset and half-wave potentials [-0.127 and -0.292 V vs. saturated calomel electrode (SCE), respectively], whereas Co3O4 results in a negative-shifted OER potential (0.65 V vs. SCE) measured at 10 mA cm(-2). Based on the DFT analysis, the potential at which all oxygen intermediate reactions proceed spontaneously is the highest for (Ni, Co)(3)O-4 (U= 0.66 eV) during ORR, whereas it is the lowest for Co3O4 (U= 2.09 eV) during OER. The high ORR activity of (Ni, Co)(3)O-4 is attributed to the enhanced electrical conductivity of the spinel lattice, and the high OER activity of Co3O4 is attributed to relatively weak adsorption energy promoting rapid release of evolved oxygen.									18	1	0	0	0	0	19			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000402122100019	28371457

Herein, we report a hierarchical FePx-NiCo2O4 nanoneedle arrays with core-shell structure grown on nickel foam (FeP-NCO@NF), which acts as a superior bifunctional electrocatalyst for water electrolysis. Benefiting from the synergetic effects between crystalline NiCo2O4 and amorphous FePx, the binder-free FeP-NCO@NF electrode delivers an oxygen hydrogen production with an overpotential of 220 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction and 82 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH electrolyte. In addition, the overall water splitting based on FeP-NCO@NF as anode/cathode can be performed with a low voltage of 1.523 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2), which is 14 mV lower than that for the commercial Pt/C-IrO2 electrocatalyst.

Thus, finding an effective method to activate lattice-oxygen in metal oxides is highly attractive for designing efficient OER electrocatalysts. Here, we discover that the lattice-oxygen sites in Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) crystal structure can be activated, leading to a new class of extremely active OER catalyst. As a proof-of-concept, the RP Sr-3(Co0.8Fe0.1Nb0.1)(2)O7-delta (RP-SCFN) oxide exhibits outstanding OER activity (eg, 334mV at 10mAcm(-2) in 0.1M KOH), which is significantly higher than that of the simple SrCo0.8Fe0.1Nb0.1O3-delta perovskite and benchmark RuO2. Combined density functional theory and X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies demonstrate that RP-SCFN follows the LOM under OER condition, and the activated lattice oxygen sites triggered by high covalency of metal-oxygen bonds are the origin of the high catalytic activity.									33	5	0	0	0	0	33				2567-3173		WOS:000682527300002

Here we present the synthesis, structural and morphological characterization, magnetic properties, electrochemical performance, and the calculated density of states of different layered metal thiophosphite materials with a general formula MPSx and as a result of varying the metal component, we obtain CrPS4, MnPS3, FePS3, CoPS3, NiPS3, ZnPS3, CdPS3, GaPS4, SnPS3, and BiPS4. SnPS3, ZnPS3, CdPS3, GaPS4, and BiPS4 exhibit only diamagnetic behavior due to core electrons. By contrast, trisulfides with M = Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni, as well as CrPS4, are paramagnetic at high temperatures and undergo a transition to antiferromagnetic state on cooling: Within the trisulfides series the Neel temperature characterizing the transition from paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic phase increases with the increasing atomic number and the orbital component enhancing the total effective magnetic moment. Interestingly, in terms of catalysis NiPS3, CoPS3, and BiPS4 show the highest efficiency for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), while for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) the highest performance is observed for CoPS3. Finally, MnPS3 presents the highest oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity compared to the other MPSx studied here. This great catalytic performance reported for these MPSx demonstrates their promising capabilities in energy applications.									129	5	0	0	5	0	131			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000399354100047	28355055

The unique lamellar architectures of FeNi-layered double hydroxide nanoparticles (FeNi-LDHs NPs) with OER activity and a prominent catalytic lifetime were first self-assembled on FeNi foam by a chemical corrosion engineering method. The obtained FeNi-LDHs@FeNi foam (FNF)-2 catalysts composed of FeNi hydroxides without any trace of NiOx species can function as active sites for an efficient OER. Moreover, considering the unique lamellar feature and partial crystallinity of FeNi hydroxides, FeNi-LDHs@FNF-2 can achieve a good balance between available active sites and electronic conductivity, thus endowing it with excellent oxygen evolution activity. This study affords an effective strategy to achieve optimized OER performance with a promising future for larger-scale non-precious materials in industry.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2398-4902			WOS:000654217000001

The structural, chemical, and morphological characterizations of the synthesized catalyst were performed by XRD, FTIR, SEM, TEM, and XPS techniques as a function of the Mn:Co elemental ratio. The time-temperature profile during the combustion process was also monitored to study the completion of the combustion reaction and to understand its impact on the structure of the perovskites. SEM/EDX and XPS analysis confirmed the formation of the targeted ratio of Mn and Co on the catalyst. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) results revealed that all perovskite samples with different Co:Mn ratios were active for ORR, OER, and MOR. The LaMnxCo1-xO3 perovskite with x=0.4 showed the highest current density compared to the other samples toward all the electrocatalytic reactions under alkaline reaction conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000852257600001

Hydrogen, as a promising alternative resource that is produced in an environmentally friendly and sustainable manner by a water splitting reaction, has attracted extensive attention in recent years. However, the large-scale application of water splitting devices is hindered predominantly by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. Therefore, the design and exploration of high-performing OER electrocatalysts is a critical objective. Considering their low prices, abundant reserves, and intrinsic activities, NiFe-based bimetal compounds are widely studied as excellent OER electrocatalysts. Moreover, recent progress on NiFe-based OER electrocatalysts in alkaline environments is comprehensively and systematically introduced through various catalyst families including NiFe-layered hydroxides, metal-organic frameworks, NiFe-based (oxy)hydroxides, NiFe-based oxides, NiFe alloys, and NiFe-based nonoxides. This review briefly introduces the advanced NiFe-based OER materials and their corresponding reaction mechanisms. Finally, the challenges inherent to and possible strategies for producing extraordinary NiFe-based electrocatalysts are discussed.									85	4	0	0	3	0	85			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000592435000001	33244890

The production of water inside and outside the Pt-ACF was visualized using micro-CT, CCD and infrared thermometer during hydrogen-oxygen reaction. Results indicate that the amount of Pt deposited on the ACF, external cooling conditions and number of the Pt-ACF catalytic layers may significantly affect water production, evaporation and condensation inside and outside the Pt-ACF samples by changing the reaction temperature and the water generation rate.

Here we present ruthenium oxide nanoparticles (RuO2 NPs)' dispersed on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as a cathode, which dramatically increase the electrical efficiency up to 73%. We demonstrate that the RuO2 NPs contribute to the formation of poorly crystalline lithium peroxide (Li2O2) that is coated over the.CNT with large contact area during oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). This unique Li2O2 stiucture can be smoothly decomposed at low potential upon oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by avoiding the energy loss associated with.the decomposition of the more typical Li2O2 structure with a large size, small CNT contact area, and insulating crystals.									388	18	0	0	17	0	395			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000326356300016	24024674

Nickel-iron layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDHs) with specific interlayer anions (i.e. phosphate, phosphite, and hypophosphite) were fabricated by a co-precipitation method and investigated as oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. Intercalation of the phosphorus oxoanion enhanced the OER activity in an alkaline solution; the optimal performance (i.e., a low onset potential of 215 mV, a small Tafel slope of 37.7 mV/dec, and stable electrochemical behavior) was achieved with the hypophosphite-intercalated NiFe-LDH catalyst, demonstrating dramatic enhancement over the traditional carbonate-intercalated NiFe-LDH in terms of activity and durability. This enhanced performance is attributed to the interaction between the intercalated phosphorous oxoanions and the edge-sharing MO6 (M = Ni, Fe) layers, which modifies the surface electronic structure of the Ni sites. This concept should be inspiring for the design of more effective LDH-based oxygen evolution electrocatalysts.									113	14	0	0	4	0	115			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000400005000020

Developing high-efficiency and earth-abundant non-noble metal electrocatalysts is considered as the key to electrolytic water technology. In this work, two-dimensional (2D) transition metal oxides (Co3O4 or NiO)/CeO2 heterostructures with rich oxygen vacancies (v-TMOs/CeO2 HSs) have been successfully synthesized via a simple and general strategy. The as-synthesized Co3O4/CeO2 HSs and NiO/CeO2 HSs demonstrated outstanding bifunctional electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline surroundings, supplying low overpotentials of at 10 mA cm 2 (eta(10)) of 88 and 258 mV (Co3O4/CeO2 HSs) as well as 99 and 265 mV (NiO/CeO2 HSs). The 2D heterostructure and oxygen vacancies endow the v-TMOs/CeO2 HSs with plentiful active sites and large active surface area, which can enhance the catalytic activity during the HER and OER. This work highlights a general strategy to fabricate the novel TMOs/CeO2 catalysts with abundant oxygen vacancies, and provides the guidance for the rational construction of catalyst materials which can be devoted to the highly efficient HER and OER.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000702833000003

However, the currently reported monometallic and noncrystalline multimetallic borides only show generic and monofunctional catalytic activity. In this work, the authors design and successfully synthesize highly crystalline ternary borides, Mo2NiB2, via a facile solid-state reaction from pure elemental powders. The as-synthesized Mo2NiB2 exhibits very low overpotentials for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), that is, 280 and 160 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), in alkaline media. These values are much lower from the ones observed over monometallic borides, that is, Ni2B and MoB, and the lowest among all nonprecious metal borides. By loading Mo2NiB2 onto Ni foams as both cathode and anode electrode for overall water splitting applications, a low cell voltage of 1.57 V is required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), comparable with the value required from the Pt/C||IrO2/C couple (1.56 V). The proposed synthesis strategy can be used for the preparation of cost-effective, multi-metallic crystalline borides, as multifunctional electrocatalysts.									14	0	0	0	0	0	13			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000753457400029	35142066

The vast majority of works are devoted to the study of the regularities of chlorine evolution reaction in highly concentrated NaCl solutions on the surface of oxide catalysts, which often contain oxides of ruthenium and iridium. Taking into account the variety of works, today there is no universal mechanism that describes the reaction of chlorine evolution under various conditions and on the surfaces of electrocatalysts of various nature. Comprehensive data on the peculiarities of such processes in low concentrated chloride solutions are presented. It is shown that the regularities of such processes are due to the participation of oxygen-containing particles with different bond strengths in individual steps. It was found that the electrocatalytic activity of electrodes in anodic processes in low concentrationed-chloride solutions was due to the strength of the bond of chemisorbed oxygen-containing particles of different nature with the anode surface. Participation in the oxidation of Cl(- )labile oxygen-containing particles of a certain energy increases the rate of formation of hypochlorous acid and leads to inhibition of undesirable reactions of oxygen evolution and synthesis of chlorates and chlorites. It is shown that the modification of the anode surface with palladium makes it possible to significantly increase their selectivity for the synthesis of hypochlorous acid from low concentration chloride solutions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2663-2934	2663-2942		WOS:000833370300015

Epitaxial strain is a powerful tool for tailoring various physical and chemical properties of perovskite transition metal oxides, including electrocatalytic activity. We present single-crystalline CaRuO3 epitaxial thin films as a model system, in which the oxygen evolution reaction was systematically controlled by the epitaxial strain. With an increase in the degree of tensile strain, the interband transition energy and hybridization strength within the Ru-O bond decreased, which enhanced the oxygen evolution reaction. Our study facilitates the understanding of the correlation between the lattice/electronic structure and the electrocatalytic activity, which might be applied to other transition metal oxide catalysts.

The efficiency of Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) largely depends on the activity and stability of any elctrocatalyst. Herein, we have employed a facile and reproducible electrodeposition coating method to synthesize bi-metallic CopperCobalt (CuCo) containing electrocatalyst supported on carbon paper (CuCo/CP) for electrochemical splitting of water in neutral medium. We have accomplished superior and improved HER and OER electrocatalytic activity, regardless of lower activity of Cu toward HER and OER. The unique structure and synergistic effect of CuCo/CP displayed better electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential of 450 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) toward HER and just 80 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) toward Oxygen evolution reaction than other Cu containing electrocatalysts. Moreover, the durability of synthesized electrocatalyst at high applied current density ensure the stable nature of the catalyst.

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is capable of creating conformal thin films over complex substrates. Here, ALD-MnOx on glassy carbon is investigated as a catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), two reactions that are of growing interest due to their many applications in alternative energy technologies. The films are characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, ellipsometry, and cyclic voltammetry. The as-deposited films consist of Mn(II)O, which is shown to be a poor catalyst for the ORR, but highly active for the OER. By controllably annealing the samples, Mn2O3 catalysts with good activity for both the ORR and OER are synthesized. Hypotheses are presented to explain the large difference in the activity between the MnO and Mn2O3 catalysts for the ORR, but similar activity for the OER, including the effects of surface oxidation under experimental conditions. These catalysts synthesized though ALD compare favorably to the best MnOx catalysts in the literature, demonstrating a viable way to produce highly active, conformal thin films from earth-abundant materials for the ORR and the OER.									254	7	0	0	5	1	258			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000309595900016

In this paper, a novel method of pulse current charging is developed for solving these problems. The results show, compared with the normal constant current samples, when duty cycle is 50% and frequency is 1 Hz and, the overpotential decreases up to 25% and the cycle life improves more than 4 times. During charging process, pulse current can reduce the concentration polarization and promote the decomposition of Li2O2, and increase the reaction kinetics of OER process, leading to the reduction of overpotential and improvement of electrochemical performance.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2468-0230			WOS:000663429800005

Herein, we report a one-step solvothermal method to synthesize iron-doped cobalt sulfide (CoFeS) nanoplates. A highly efficient OER catalytic performance with a low overpotential of 290 mV, small Tafel slope of 52.6 mV dec (1) and long-term operational stability is achieved from the CoFeS nanostructures with an optimized Fe/Co ratio. The enhanced catalytic activity is attributed to the high electric conductivity of CoFeS that accelerating charge transfer during the reaction, and Fe doping that changing the local Co-S environments toward a moderate absorption energy to the reaction intermediates.

This work computationally examines a number of earth-abundant metal (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) complexes with tetradentate coordinating anionic ligands which, subject to the same experimental conditions, either evolve or do not evolve oxygen. We offer an account for the inactivity of catalysts and develop an effective thermodynamic descriptor to describe the activity of those catalysts that do evolve oxygen. Additionally, we describe how the functionalization of certain Fe OER catalysts can boost activity. Finally, to allow for the rapid evaluation of homogeneous OER catalysts within this family of complexes, high-level heuristics to computationally screen these catalysts are detailed.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000564089700001

Catalyst materials are normally the key in determining the efficiency of these devices, as the electrochemical processes involved are normally sluggish in reaction kinetics. Herein, we found that by encapsulating Ni, Co and Fe alloyed cores inside graphitic carbon shells (NiCoFe@C), a versatile catalyst material can be obtained, showing decent activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The encapsulation of the NiCoFe alloyed core induces the electronic structure change of the outer graphitic carbon shell, which tunes the binding strength of reaction intermediates thereby improving the catalytic activity.									23	1	0	0	2	0	23			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472465300052

Here, hierarchical IrTe nanotubes (NTs) with assembled nanosheets have been prepared through a replacement reaction between Te nanowires and metal precursors in the presence of formic acid. Owing to the hollow nanostructure and nanosheet assemblies, the IrTe NTs can be used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for effective oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions in acidic media. More importantly, the IrTe NTs exhibit high-efficiency performance towards electrocatalytic overall water splitting in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, reaching 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of only 1.53 V. This study proposes a powerful approach to fabricate active bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000687270800001

The activity of the OER increased up to the plating current density of 160 mA/cm(2), as the Fe content of the deposited electrode increased and electrochemical surface area (ECSA) increased after Zn dealloying. However, for the plated electrode with higher than 160 mA/cm(2) of current density, the change in composition caused by underpotential deposition led to decreased activity due to decreasing Fe content and diminishing Zn dealloying. Moreover, when the Ni:Fe ratio in the plating bath was varied, outstanding OER activity was observed at Ni:Fe = 2:1. When the Fe content of the bath increased beyond this ratio, Fe could not restrain Ni oxidation and formed Fe oxides in OER reaction, and oxygen vacancy decreased. These caused a degradation of the OER activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4344		WOS:000775647100001

Ni-Fe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been reported as promising OER electrocatalysts in alkaline electrolytes. The rational design of advanced nanostructures for Ni-Fe LDHs is highly desirable to optimize their electrocatalytic performance. Herein, we report a facile self-templated strategy for the synthesis of novel hierarchical hollow nanoprisms composed of ultrathin Ni-Fe LDH nanosheets. Tetragonal nanoprisms of nickel precursors were first synthesized as the self-sacrificing template. Afterwards, these Ni precursors were consumed during the hydrolysis of iron(II) sulfate for the simultaneous growth of a layer of Ni-Fe LDH nanosheets on the surface. The resultant Ni-Fe LDH hollow prisms with large surface areas manifest high electrocatalytic activity towards the OER with low overpotential, small Tafel slope, and remarkable stability.									414	25	0	0	26	0	417			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000418798600015	29178355

The experimental results demonstrate that these samples are efficient OER and ORR catalysts. For the La2CoMnO6 compound annealed at 600 degrees C, its half-wave potential of ORR in alkaline media is as low as 0.75 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. As for the correlation between electrocatalytic activities and the e(g) orbital occupation numbers, it is found that the e(g)-filling rule proposed by Shao-Horn and co-workers is valid in La2CoMnO6-delta when the e g electrons of two kinds of transition-metal ions are all considered. In the case of La2NiMnO6-delta, because the samples which prepared in different conditions all have unity average e(g) occupation, the e(g)-filling rule should be amended. We suggest that the average deviation from unity e(g) occupation is a suitable activity descriptor, which can be used to design perovskite catalysts with unity average e(g) occupation.									26	1	0	0	1	0	26			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000435525100051	29863326

We systematically investigated the preferable adsorption site for hydrogen and oxygen atom on 2D Bi, BiAs and BiSb. It was found that the hydrogen atom prefers top site of bismuth atom and oxygen atom prefers to reside in the hexagonal ring of these 2D bismuth alloys. The free energy calculated from the individual adsorption energy for each monolayer subsequently guides us to predict the best suitable catalyst among the considered 2D monolayers. The 2D BiSb serves better for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with hydrogen adsorption energy as -1.384 eV while 2D BiAs is suitable for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with oxygen adsorption energy as -1.092 eV. We further investigated the effects of the adsorbate atom on the electronic properties of 2D Bi, BiAs and BiSb. The adsorption of oxygen on 2D BiAs and BiSb was shown to reduce the bulk band gap by 40.56 and 67.79% respectively which will be advantageous for the observation of Quantum Spin Hall effect at ambient conditions.

The heart reactions for these technologies are oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Different supporters such as graphene, carbon nanotube, and graphitic carbon nitride have been used to avoid agglomeration of active materials and provide maximum active surface for these reactions. Among all the supporters, boron nitride (BN) gains extensive research attention due to its analogue with graphene and excellent stability with good oxidation and chemical inertness. In this mini-review, the well-known strategies (exfoliation, annealing, and CVD) used in the synthesis of BN with different morphologies for HER, OER and ORR applications have been briefly debated and summarized. The comparative analysis determines that the performance and stability of state-of-the-art electrocatalysts can be further boosted if they are deposited on BN. It is revealed that BN-based catalysts for HER, OER and ORR are rarely studied yet especially with non-noble transition metals, and this research direction should be studied deeply in future for practical applications.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2095-025X	2095-0268		WOS:000727761300002

However, MOFs based bifunctional catalyst has been rarely explored. In this work, we reported the design of a bifunctional MOF catalyst, namely, twodimensional MOFs (H2NMe2)(2)M-2 (Cl(2)dhbq)(3)) (M = transition metals, Cl(2)dhbe(n-) = deprotonated 2,5-dich loro-3,6-dihydroxybenzoquinone), with high activity for Oxygen Evolution/Reduction Reaction (OER/ORR). The calculated overpotentials for OER and ORR are 0.41 and 0.46 V, respectively. Moreover, the catalytic activity is found to be governed by the interaction strength between transition metal (TM) and adsorbed species, which can be well modulated by the adjustment of d-electron occupation of TM. The ideal energy level of d band centre for OER and ORR are found to be 0.84 eV and 0.20 eV, respectively. Our findings offer cost-effective opportunities for advancing clean energy technology.

Molecular electrocatalysts offer attractive catalysts for the OER. Here, phytic acid (PA) was selected to investigate the OER activity of carbons in organic molecules by DFT calculations and experiments. Positively charged carbons on PA were very active towards the OER. The PA molecules were fixed into a porous, conductive hydrogel with a superhydrophilic surface. This outperformed most metal-free electrocatalysts. Besides the active sites on PA, the high OER activity was also related to the porous and conductive networks on the hydrogel, which allowed fast charge and mass transport during the OER. Therefore, this work provides a metal-free, organic-molecule-based electrocatalyst to replace carbon nanomaterials for efficient OER.									127	7	0	0	10	0	128			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000462655400037	30714282

Despite recent progress, the synthesis of monolayer metal hydroxides with unique structures remains a challenge, and their potential use in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has not been fully investigated. Herein, the fabrication of chromium-substituted alpha-cobalt hydroxide through a simple co-precipitation method under optimum conditions at higher pH is described. Such nanostructures can competently catalyze oxygen evolution reactions to produce a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 240 mV in alkaline medium. Microscopic, electrochemical, and spectroscopic analyses reveal that the exceptional OER performance originates from thin monolayer sheets with exposed active sites and partially due to the substitution of alpha-CoOOH with Cr. The phase purity is highlighted through powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2574-0962			WOS:000557375200054

Here, a novel metal oxide-nanostructured carbon composite is reported, which acts as OER and ORR electrocatalyst under technologically relevant conditions. A facile synthetic process allows the deposition of a molecular manganese vanadium oxide precursor, [Mn4V4O17(OAc)(3)](3-), on reduced graphene oxide. Simultaneously, the precursor is converted into insoluble nanostructured solid-state Mn-V-oxide catalysts. Control of the synthetic conditions allows tuning of the electrocatalytic properties of the composites, leading to excellent and stable electrochemical reactivity. The electrocatalytic ORR and OER activity was evaluated in alkaline aqueous electrolyte and showed performance comparable with commercial Pt/C electrocatalysts. The study thus demonstrates how polyoxometalate precursors based on earth-abundant elements can be deposited give high-performance OER/ORR catalysts for alkaline water electrolysis. A new class of composite catalysts can in future be accessed by a facile fabrication route.									39	0	0	0	3	0	39			1944-8244			WOS:000454751600034	30508370

Powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) studies were performed to analyse structure, chemical state, and size of the nanocatalysts. Hybrid Cu-Cu2O@C materials exhibited stronger electrocatalytic activity compared to pure phases whereas pure Cu and Cu2O@C NPs displayed better catalytic activity for A(3) coupling reaction. Oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction (OER and HER) showed enhanced current response (57.8 mA cm(-2) and -172 mA cm(-2)) for hybrid NPs with higher Cu2O ratio. Thus, the present work investigated the role of Cu and Cu2O ratio for fabricating earth abundant cost effective nanocatalysts for OER, HER, and organic chemical transformation.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9				2053-1591		WOS:000454322200003

The Fe-N-C catalyst prepared at 800 degrees C exhibits comparable ORR performance but significantly improved OER activity compared to the commercial Pt/C catalyst as well as good stability. We demonstrate that the excellent performance of the catalyst is caused by its high heteroatom content, large surface area, and high degree of graphitization.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2196-0216			WOS:000404604300026

Herein, we designed a highly efficient NiFe layered-double-hydroxide (NiFe LDH) nanosheets arrays catalyst for superior oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysis by lithium-induced amorphization. Electrochemical lithium tuning of layered NiFe LDH crystal makes for the formation of amorphous NiFe intermediate with abundant active sites. It exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction with an overpotential of 259 mV at 50 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 56 mV dec(-1) and prominent long-term stability, better than the RuO2 as benchmark catalysts. Experimental studies show that the electrochemical tuning contributes to the enhancement of NiFe LDH intrinsic activity due to crystallinity loss, morphology changes and formation of grain boundaries. This work enlightens a unique strategy to effectively design the advanced electrocatalysts by regulating the structure of material. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Given the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the above renewable-energy technologies, the development of efficient OER electrocatalysts with high performance is of great importance. Here, we demonstrate a layer-structured oxide Na0.86Co0.95Fe0.05O2 (NCF0.05) as a novel electrocatalyst for efficient water oxidation in alkaline media. NCF0.05 shows enhanced performance, including lower overpotential, lower Tafel slope and better stability than the parent Na0.86CoO2 (NC). Especially, the OER performance of NCF0.05 is comparable to the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst. This enhanced catalytic activity of NCF0.05 may be ascribed to the unusual synergistic interplay between Fe and Co. A possible dual-metal-site mechanism was also proposed for OER on NCF0.05.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000405159100001	28616961

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a crucial reaction for the sustainable hydrogen generation as a half reaction of water splitting. It is important to develop efficient electrocatalysts for the OER. Herein, the porous iridium nanowires (Ir PNWs) with polyallylamine hydrochloride (PAH) as a complex-forming agent and capping agent have been successfully synthesized through a one-pot hydrothermal approach. Benefiting from the inherent anisotropic characteristic of one-dimensional nanowires structure, abundant microporous channels and high atom utilization efficiency, the synthesized Ir PNWs possess very large electrochemically active surface area (118.2 m(2) g(-1)), and thus exhibit superior electrocatalytic activity and stability towards the OER compared with commercial RuO2 catalyst and other Ir nanocrystals.									11	1	0	0	1	0	12			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000528025400001

However, the commercialized iridium-based catalysts often suffer from severe sluggish kinetics, eventually deteriorating the polarization and overall PEMWEs performance. Therefore, to develop OER electrocatalysts with promising reaction kinetics and high stability is of great significance for PEMWEs. Compared to iridium, the ruthenium-based catalysts possess lower price and higher activity in acidic water oxidation, which promises Ru-based materials to replace the state-of-the-art IrOx. Yet, the less stable ruthenium than iridium impedes its real applications. In this mini review, recent knowledge of feasible engineering strategies for migrating the Ru-based electrocatalysts' stability is summarized. In order to improve performance and durability, basic fundamentals of acidic OER on nanoscale and molecular engineered Ru-based electrocatalysts are briefly introduced.

The interdependence reduces the number of degrees of freedom available for catalyst optimization. Here it is demonstrated that this limitation can be removed by active site modification. This can be achieved on ruthenia by incorporation of Ni or Co into the surface, which activates a proton donor-acceptor functionality on the conventionally inactive bridge surface sites. This enhances the actual measured oxygen evolution activity of the catalyst significantly compared to conventional ruthenia.									224	3	0	0	12	0	224			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000338116700016	24671166

Here we report a facile strategy toward bifunctional electrocatalysts by supporting mixed platinum and cobalt oxide nanoparticles on carbon black. The composite electrocatalyst (denoted as Pt+CoOx/C) is found to exhibit higher oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity than CoOx/C, but slightly lower oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity than Pt/C in alkaline electrolytes. The bifunctional catalytic performance is ascribed to the in situ formation of heterogenous platinum-cobalt (hydro) oxide (Pt-CoOxHy) interfaces under the electrochemical reaction conditions. Calculated electrochemical phase (Pourbaix) diagrams suggest that the migration of Co species was driven by the relative stability of Pt-CoOxHy interfaces versus bulk (hydroxy) oxides or aqueous ions of cobalt.

As a novel class of electrocatalyst, transition metal nanoparticles encapsulated within nitrogen-doped carbon have been regarded as competitive alternative to replace noble metal electrocatalysts. Herein, we report successful synthesis of high-density iron nanoparticles encapsulated within nitrogen-doped carbon nanoshell (Fe@N-C) by solid-phase precursor's pyrolysis of dicyandiamide and ammonium ferric citrate. The resulting Fe@N-C material shows excellent bifunctionality for ORR and OER in alkaline medium compared to state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C and IrO2, which demonstrates high performance and cycling durability in zinc air battery as efficient oxygen electrocatalyst.

Among the state-of-the-art efficient oxygen electrocatalysts, heteroatom-doped carbon materials are favorable candidates. However, the enriched doping requires a highly exposed carbon skeleton. Here, we report a scalable route to prepare carbon nanotubes (CNTs) loaded on graphene microfolds (CGFs) by a low-temperature spray-drying procedure. Molecular- level assembly of graphene and CNTs, mesoporous structures, and large specific surface areas permit the carbon skeleton of CGFs to be highly exposed. After doping with abundant nitrogen and phosphorous (5.58 at% for N, 0.1 at% for P), CGFs exhibit excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for both the ORR and OER, with superb durability and methanol tolerance. The measured variance of the ORR and OER metrics (Delta E=E-j=10-E-1/2) was low at 0.9V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE), being within only 20 mV of Pt-and Rubased electrodes, and superior to transition-metal-based catalysts and other carbon catalysts. Such efficient overall electrocatalytic activity allows CGFs to be used for high-performance oxygen electrodes in renewable energy devices.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000418390700012

Optimizing the performance of electrocatalysts requires a detailed understanding of surface-state changes during the catalytic process, ideally at the atomic scale. Here, we use atom probe tomography to reveal the three-dimensional structure of the first few atomic layers of electrochemically grown iridium oxide, an efficient electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction. We unveil the formation of confined, non-stoichiometric Ir-O species during oxygen evolution. These species gradually transform to IrO2, providing improved stability but also a decrease in activity. Additionally, electrochemical growth of oxide in deuterated solutions allowed us to trace hydroxy-groups and water molecules present in the regions of the oxide layer that are favourable for the oxygen evolution and iridium dissolution reactions. Overall, we demonstrate how tomography with near-atomic resolution advances the understanding of complex relationships between surface structure, surface state and function in electrocatalysis.									115	2	0	0	11	0	115			2520-1158			WOS:000430451900017

Herein, we develop Cu-CoP porous nanoplates through polyethylenimine assisted hydrothermal process and subsequent phosphidation treatment. The incorporation of Cu in cobalt phosphide enhances the density of active sites, as well as facilitates fast charge transfer, and hence boosts the OER activity. The Cu-CoP reveals efficient electrocatalytic activity and stability toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with a low overpotential of 252 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2. The post-OER analysis of electrocatalysts confirms that the phosphate modified Cu-CoOOH nanoplates generate on the catalyst surface during the OER process could perform as the active catalyst and improve the OER activity. This work demonstrates the influence of the role of Cu incorporation on structural, morphological and electrocatalytic performance of cobalt phosphide.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773067800002

The structures and morphologies of the Co-MOF materials have been characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Electrochemical performances of the as-synthesized materials have been investigated through cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), endurance-life and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) tests. The results suggest that Co-MOF6h (the sample synthesized by hydrothermal method for 6 h) electrode attains the specific capacitance of 450.89 F g(-1) at a current density of 0.5 A g(-1) and shows higher supercapacitive performance than others. All the Co-MOF electrodes show high capacitance retention more than 95% over 1000 cycles.

Systematic characterizations indicates that the series of CoxFe1-LDH/rGO/NF (x = 4, 3, 2) all show CoxFe1-LDH nanosheets (150-180 x 15 nm) grown vertically on the surface of rGO/NF. Especially, the Co3Fe1-LDH/rGO/NF exhibits the best performance with overpotentials of 250 and 110 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. When it is used as cathode and anode simultaneously for overall water splitting, they require 1.65 and 1.84 V at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Excellent performance of Co3Fe1-LDH/rGO/NF is due to the nanosheet arrays structure with open channels, synergistic coupling between Co3Fe1-LDH and rGO enhancing electrical conductivity, and in-situ growth of Co3Fe1-LDH on rGO/NF enhancing stability.

In OER working potential, the driving force of concentration gradient on Ni element migration can be strengthen by the shuttle of miniscule oxygen intermediates in the bulk phase, which promotes the changes of metal species (Ni or Co) and migration direction, further optimizing the surface oxide state.

A conventional but stationary ring-disc electrode was employed in a flow cell configuration for the detection of volatile reaction product other than oxygen, and the formation of at least two active species was detected. Potential-modulated UV-VIS reflectance spectroscopy helped to identify one of these volatile reaction byproducts as hydrogen peroxide, and the other is tentatively suggested to be ozone. It was found that these species are formed under potentiodynamic conditions due to the chemical recombination of the absorbed reaction intermediates. The influence of the electrode material composition on the production yield of these byproducts was studied, and we found that the generation of these corrosive reaction byproducts is suppressed the more active the catalyst is for the OER. The formation of by-products can therefore be addressed by a rational choice of the electrode materials based on the adsorption energy of the reaction intermediates as is done for the OER itself. Steady-state electrolysis minimizes hydrogen peroxide formation as byproduct of the oxygen evolution reaction. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Much research has been performed to understand the structure-activity relationship of NiFe LDH under OER conditions. However, the specific role of the Fe species remains unclear and under debate. Herein, based on DFT calculations, it was discovered that the edge Fe sites show higher activity towards OER than either the edge Ni sites or lattice sites. Therefore, a facile acid-etching method was proposed to controllably induce the formation of edge Fe sites in NiFe LDH, and the obtained sample exhibited higher OER activity. X-ray absorption near edge structure and extended X-ray absorption fine structure analyses further revealed that the interaction of the edge Fe species with Ni is believed to contribute to the enhancement of the OER performance. This work provides a new understanding of the structure-activity relationship in NiFe LDH and offers a facile method for the design of efficient electrocatalysts in an alkaline environment.									43	1	0	0	1	0	42			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000508211400001	31802649

Oxygenic photosynthesis is often cited as the most important microbial innovation-the emergence of oxygen-evolving photosynthesis, aided by geologic events, is credited with tipping the scale from a reducing early Earth to an oxygenated world that eventually lead to complex life. Anoxygenic photosynthesis predates oxygen-evolving photosynthesis and played a key role in developing and fine-tuning the photosystem architecture of modern oxygenic phototrophs. The release of oxygen as a by-product of metabolic activity would have caused oxidative damage to anaerobic microbiota that evolved under the anoxic, reducing conditions of early Earth. Photosynthetic machinery is particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of oxygen and reactive oxygen species and these effects are compounded by light. As a result, phototrophs employ additional detoxification mechanisms to mitigate oxidative stress and have evolved alternative oxygen-dependent enzymes for chlorophyll biosynthesis. Phylogenetic reconstruction studies and biochemical characterization suggest photosynthetic reactions centers, particularly in Cyanobacteria, evolved to both increase efficiency of electron transfer and avoid photodamage caused by chlorophyll radicals that is acute in the presence of oxygen. Here we review the oxygen and reactive oxygen species detoxification mechanisms observed in extant anoxygenic and oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria as well as the emergence of these mechanisms over evolutionary time. We examine the distribution of phototrophs in modern systems and phylogenetic reconstructions to evaluate the emergence of mechanisms to mediate oxidative damage and highlight changes in photosystems and reaction centers, chlorophyll biosynthesis, and niche space in response to oxygen production. This synthesis supports an emergence of H2S-driven anoxygenic photosynthesis in Cyanobacteria prior to the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis and underscores a role for the former metabolism in fueling fine-tuning of the oxygen evolving complex and mechanisms to repair oxidative damage. In contrast, we note the lack of elaborate mechanisms to deal with oxygen in non-cyanobacterial anoxygenic phototrophs suggesting these microbes have occupied similar niche space throughout Earth's history.									17	2	0	0	16	0	18			0891-5849	1873-4596		WOS:000485873700021	31078729

Understanding the characteristics of the materials that affect OER performance is of vital significance for the development of more advanced OER electrocatalysts. Anion vacancy engineering, with the functions of improving the intrinsic activity, exposing more accessible surface active sites, improving electrical conductivity and mechanical stability, plays an extra role in enhancing the electrocatalytic OER performance of transition metal compounds. Although the great endeavors made, the intrinsic reaction mechanism and dynamic behavior of anion vacancy sites are still unclear. Therefore, studying the structure -activity relationship of defective electrocatalysts is favorable for gaining a better understanding on the specific reaction mechanism and dynamic behavior. Herein, in this review, a systematic overview of the effect of anion vacancies, such as oxygen, sulfur, phosphorous, selenium vacancies on electrocatalytic OER performance of transition metal compounds is summarized, along with some advanced synthetic strategies and characterizations. Moreover, the challenges and future directions of anion vacancies engineering toward OER are also briefly discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000850409200004

Self-reconstruction of electrocatalysts plays an important role during oxidation reactions. Exploring the correlation between the intrinsic electronic structures with the reconstruction in the layered metal thio (seleno) phosphates is highly expected but inadequate. In this paper, we report the uncovering of the surface self-reconstruction behavior of NiPS3 nanosheets with remarkable electrochemical performance in an oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Our studies reveal that the orbital hybridization between S and P effectively modulates the surface electronic structure of Ni, lowering the Gibbs free energy of OH- adsorption and promoting the Ni2+ oxidation. As a result, this synergistic effect and the in-situ formed NiPS3-NiOOH heterostructure lead to impressive catalytic kinetic with a much small Tafel slope of 51 mV dec(-1) and excellent stability in our as-synthesized NiPS3 nanosheets. Our work provides fundamental understanding of the surface reconstruction of the promising metal thio (seleno) phosphates electrocatalysts toward OER from the view of intrinsic electronic structure.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000471830700007

For this purpose, electrochemical and in situ spectroelectrochemical characterizations of the metallophthalocyanines (MPc) bearing tetrakis-[4-((4'-trifluoromethyl)phenoxy)phenoxy] groups were performed. While CoPc gives both metal-based and ring-based redox processes, H2Pc, ZnPc and CuPc show only ring-based electron transfer processes. In situ electrocolorimetric method was applied to investigate the color of the electrogenerated anionic and cationic forms of the complexes. The presence of O-2 in the electrolyte system influences both oxygen reduction reaction and the electrochemical and spectral behaviors of the complexes, which indicate electrocatalytic activity of the complexes for the oxygen reduction reaction. Perchloric acid titrations monitored by voltammetry represent possible electrocatalytic activities of the complexes for hydrogen evolution reaction. CoPc and CuPc coated on a glassy carbon electrode decrease the overpotential of the working electrode for H+ reduction. The nature of the metal center changes the electrocatalytic activities for hydrogen evolution reaction in aqueous solution. Although CuPc has an inactive metal center, its electrocatalytic activity is recorded more than CoPc for H+ reduction in aqueous solution. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, for the first time by the use of potassium thiocyanate (KSCN) as sulfur source, CoS nanosheets are time-controlled electrosynthesized and further evolved to a 3D flower-like nanostructure, in which KSCN plays a critical role. With a deposition time of 1200s, the catalyst shows excellent catalytic activity toward OER, achieving a small Tafel slope of 55 mV dec(-1) and only requires an overpotential of 310 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), better than the benchmark IrO2 and other electrodeposited cobalt sulfide catalysts. The enhancement mechanism is attributed to the unique nanostructure offering a large electroactive surface while allowing reactants accessing the reaction surface and the produced oxygen bubble escaping out for a fast electrode kinetics toward OER.									19	1	0	0	1	0	20			2365-6549			WOS:000437504200007

In this study, we report the development of iron-doped nickel disulfide nanoarray on Ti mesh (Fe-0.1-NiS2 NA/Ti) via the sulfidation of its nickel-iron-layered double hydroxide precursor (NiFe-LDH NA/Ti). As a three-dimensional OER anode, Fe-0.1-NiS2 NA/Ti exhibits remarkable activity and stability in 1.0 M KOH, with the requirement of a low overpotential of 231 mV to achieve 100 mA center dot cm(-2). In addition, it exhibits excellent activity and durability in 30 wt.% KOH.

In this work, based on the different mass contents of MWCNTs, we construct a series of cost-effective noble metal free NiHCF/MWCNTs (NFM) catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium. Thanks to the conductive and 3D interleaved structure of MWCNTs support, the agglomeration of NiHCF nanoparticles is alleviated. NFM catalysts show comparable OER electroactivity with much lower Tafel slope and higher current density than that of bare NiHCF catalyst. In addition, by tuning the content of MWCNTs, as-prepared NFM-2 catalyst shows extensively enhanced electroactivity with the overpotential of only 360 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution. Meanwhile, under the optimum mass content of 14.29 wt% MWCNTs, NFM-2 catalyst exhibits long-term stability. The excellent electro-catalytic oxygen evolution performances suggest synergistic effect between NiHCF and MWCNTs. As a result, the content-dependent NFM composites are believed as feasible non precious electrocatalysts for alkaline OER. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

With this excellent electrocatalytic ability, comparable to that of the state-of-the-art precious-/transition-metal catalysts and superior to that of most free-standing films reported to date, they are directly used as efficient cathodes in rechargeable zinc-air batteries.

However, its hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity is challenged owing to the poor electronic conductivity and insufficient electrochemical active sites. Therefore, a three-dimensional self-supporting metal hydroxide/oxide electrode with abundant oxygen vacancies is prepared by electrodepositing CeOx nanoparticles on NiFe LDH nanosheets. According to the density functional theory calculations and experimental studies, the oxygen vacancies at the NiFe LDH/CeOx interface can be introduced successfully because of the positive charges accumulation resulting from the local electron potential difference between NiFe LDH and CeOx. The oxygen vacancies accelerate the electron/ion migration rates, facilitate the charge transfer, and increase the electrochemical active sites, which give rise to an efficient activity toward HER in alkaline solution. Furthermore, NF@NiFe LDH/CeOx needs a lower potential of 1.51 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in overall water splitting and demonstrates a superior performance compared with the benchmark Pt/C and RuO2, which is indicated to be a promising bifunctional electrode catalyst.									103	5	0	0	3	0	103			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000447954600035	30226039

The Pt@Ir nanoparticles were investigated as a bifunctional oxygen catalysts for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic medium. Benefiting from the good dispersion of ultrafine Pt nanodots on the Ir black surface and the synergistic effect between the Pt and underlying Ir atoms, Pt@Ir nanoparticles have exhibited outstanding ORR activity and comparable OER performance in comparison with commercial Ir black. In particular, Pt-16@Ir-84 shows an ORR mass activity of 2.6 times that of commercial Pt black and exhibits much better bifunctional performances than a mixture of Pt black and Ir black with a Ir/Pt mass ratio of 50/50 (Pt50Ir50).

The progress of cost-effective bifunctional catalysts has become a critical issue to be solved. Here, we report that Co(OH)(2) @N-doped carbon (NC) was facilely synthesized through the impregnation strategy of metal-organic frameworks derived carbon and cobalt ions. N-doped carbon with porous structure and cobalt hydroxide nanosheets play a synergistic effect role, representing excellent catalytic performance toward oxygen evolution and reduction reactions. The obtained Co(OH)(2)@NC exhibits remarkable activity in terms of a lower overpotential of 330 mV@10 mA cm(-2) for OER and a more positive half-wave potential (E-1/2 = 0.84 V) for ORR in alkaline medium, outperforming IrO2 and Pt/C. Due to its superior bifunctional catalytic performance, Co(OH)(2)@NC catalyst is applied into a promising air electrode of Zn-air battery. This presented strategy of impregnation synthesis in this work provides a new design direction for practical electrochemical energy devices.

Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)				13	48						10.1002/smll.201702753				2017-12	2017	Developing highly efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution is vital for renewable and sustainable energy production and storage. Herein, nitrogen-doped carbon encapsulated CoOx-MoC heterostructures are reported for the first time as high performance oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. The composition can be tuned by the addition of a Mo source to form a nanowire-assembled hierarchically porous microstructure, which can enlarge the specific surface area, thus exposing more active sites, facilitating mass transport and charge transfer. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the formation of CoOx-MoC heterostructures and the resulting synergistic effect between MoC and Co facilitate the reaction kinetics, leading to significantly improved oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with an onset overpotential of merely 290 mV, and a low overpotential of 330 mV to afford a current density of 10 mA cm-2 . The well-constructed microarchitecture contributes to superior long term stability electrochemical behaviors. This work provides a facile strategy via composition tuning and structure optimization for the development of next-generation nonprecious metal-based OER electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1613-6829		MEDLINE:29119671	29119671

Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments were performed to analyse the electrochemical behaviour of the Raney-Ni electrode under these conditions. Under silent conditions, it was found that the electrocatalytic activity of Raney-Ni towards the HER and the OER depends upon the electrolyte temperature, and higher current densities at lower overpotentials were achieved at elevated temperatures. It was also observed that the HER activity of Raney-Ni under ultrasonic conditions increased at low temperatures (e.g., 25 degrees C) while the ultrasonic effect on the OER was found to be insignificant. In addition, it was observed that the ultrasonic effect on both the HER and OER decreases by elevating the temperature. In our conditions, it is suggested that ultrasound enhances the electrocatalytic performance of Raney-Ni towards the HER due to principally the efficient gas bubble removal from the electrode surface and the dispersion of gas bubbles into the electrolyte, and this effect depends upon the behaviour of the hydrogen and oxygen gas bubbles in alkaline media.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1350-4177	1873-2828		WOS:000788114300003	35299037

With the development of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), non-noble-metal-based hollow nanoboxes have become one of the most promising candidate materials for heterogeneous electrocatalysts due to their unique structural features. In this review, we aim at providing an updated summary of the research related to hollow nanobox architectures, covering their classification, advantages, electrocatalytic applications and reaction mechanisms. Following a brief introduction, we review the recent progress in various advanced nanoboxes for electrocatalytic processes in the efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and overall water splitting (OWS). Then, we systemically discuss the relationship among the composition, morphology, structure, and catalytic activity, with an emphasis on the classification of nanoboxes, electrocatalytic performance and reaction mechanism. Later, the structural advantages and compositional merits for advanced electrocatalysis are also presented, including abundant surface active sites, facilitated electron/mass transport, and favorable synergistic effect and electronic effect. Finally, the current challenges, future perspectives, and research directions ahead for non-noble-metal-based nanoboxes as efficient electrocatalysts are also outlined.									54	0	0	0	2	0	54			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000609149500008

But, after they are discharged at1.1 to 1.2 V, large overpotential is required for their charging (usually 2.5 V). This is due to a sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Incorporating organic pollutants into the cathode electrolyte is a feasible strategy for lowering the required charging potential. In the discharge process, the related oxygen reduction reaction, hydrophobic electrocatalysts are more popular than hydrophilic ones. Here, a hydrophobic bifunctional polyoxometalate electrocatalyst is synthesized by precise structural design. It shows excellent activities in both bisphenol A degradation and oxygen reduction reactions. In bisphenol A containing electrolyte, to achieve 100 mA .cm(-2), its potential is only 1.32 V, which is 0.34 V lower than oxygen evolution reaction. In the oxygen reduction reaction, this electrocatalyst follows the four-electron mechanism. In both bisphenol A degradation and oxygen reduction reactions, it shows excellent stability. With this electrocatalyst as cathode material and bisphenol A containing KOH as electrolyte, a Zn-air battery was assembled. When "charged" at 85 mA .cm(-2), it only requires 1.98 V. Peak power density of this Zn-air battery reaches 120.5 mW .cm(-2). More importantly, in the "charge" process, bisphenol A is degraded, which achieves energy saving and pollutant removal simultaneously in one Zn-air battery.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000649688200001	33844332

This approach involves a spontaneous solution polymerization of polydopamine (PDA) film on graphene oxide (GO) sheets in the presence of Fe3+ and Co2+ to form the Fe/Co-PDA-GO precursor, followed by pyrolysis at 800 degrees C in argon (Ar) atmosphere. During the calcination process, Co/CoFe2O4 nanoparticles are in situ formed via high-temperature solid state reaction and are further entrapped by the PDA-derived N-doped carbon layer.

However, to fabricate highly active OER electrocatalysts, rational design of simple and effective strategies is still required. Herein, through hydrogen etching, we synthesizes defect-rich NiS with excellent catalytic performance for oxygen evolution, where it shows a low overpotential of 444 mV at 50 mA cm-2, and a small Tafel slope of 48.32 mV dec-1. Importantly, the characterization results implies that the NiS exhibits dynamic remodeling during the OER process to form NiOOH in situ. This work provides an effective strategy for transition metal compounds to enhance OER performance. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Here, a flower-like hybrid of Cr-doped FeOOH/Ni(OH)(2) was used as an OER catalyst with a low overpotential of 291 mV at 50 mA cm(-2). The results showed that faster charge transfer was achieved at the electrode/solution interface during the OER process after the FeOOH/Ni(OH)(2) was modified by Cr, which facilitates the rate-determining step of the Volmer reaction. Furthermore, the results of faradaic efficiency and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements confirmed that the synergistic effect between the ternary metal and oxygen vacancies led to excellent OER performance. This work provides a new strategy for the preparation of high-efficiency and low-cost oxygen evolution electrocatalysts.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000665773600001	34169303

Herein, gold nanoparticles were loaded onto conventional strontium doped lanthanum manganite-yttria stabilized zirconia (LSM-YSZ) anode, which evidently improved the performance of oxygen evolution reaction at 800 degrees C. The current densities at 1.2V and 1.4V increased by 60.0% and 46.9%, respectively, after loading gold nanoparticles onto the LSM-YSZ anode. Physicochemical characterizations and electrochemical measurements suggested that the improved SOEC performance was attributed to the accelerated electron transfer of elementary process in anodic polarization reaction and the newly generated triple phase boundaries in gold nanoparticles-loaded LSM-YSZ anode.

Here, it is shown that strontium substitution for lanthanum in coherently strained, epitaxial LaNiO3 films (La1-xSrxNiO3) significantly enhances the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, resulting in performance at x = 0.5 comparable to the state-of-the-art catalyst Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta. By combining X-ray photoemission and X-ray absorption spectroscopies with density functional theory, it is shown that an upward energy shift of the O 2p band relative to the Fermi level occurs with increasing x in La1-xSrxNiO3. This alloying step strengthens Ni 3d-O 2p hybridization and decreases the charge transfer energy, which in turn accounts for the enhanced OER activity.									53	1	0	0	6	0	52				2198-3844		WOS:000479248300001	31592141

In this paper, by applying the density functional theory method, a highly active site of C60-SWCNT is identified (named as site-2). The oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution on the site-2 both can be completed through the four-electron reaction pathway and the corresponding overpotentials are 0.58 V and 0.62 V for them, respectively. Furthermore, the hydrogen adsorption free energy is calculated to be a small value of 0.39 eV, also indicating the high hydrogen evolution activity of the site-2. These calculation results are consistent with the experimental determinations. The source of the excellent activities of the C60-SWCNT composite should be attributed to the intermolecular charge transfer from the SWCNT to the C60, which leads to the increased positive charges of the site-2 in the C60-SWCNT. Therefore, the activity of the C60-SWCNT is enhanced and the binding of the reaction species is further improved.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			2468-8231			WOS:000649342100017

It is highly challenging but desirable to develop low-cost bifunctional catalysts for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the lack of which is currently one of the major limiting components towards commercialization of these technologies. Here, we have conducted a systematic study on the OER and ORR performances of the Ruddlesden-Popper family of Lan+1NinO3n+1 (n=1, 2, 3, and ) in an alkaline medium for the first time. It is apparent that the Ni-O bond lengths and the hyperstoichiometric oxides in the rock-salt layers correlate with the ORR activities, whereas the OER activities appear to be influenced by the OH- content on the surface of the compounds. In our case, the electronic configuration fails to predict the electrocatalytic activity of these compounds. This work provides guidelines to develop new electrocatalysts with improved performances.									79	4	0	0	3	0	81			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000370193000021	26788934

Understanding the characteristics of the material that affect OER activity is of paramount importance for the development of high-efficiency electrocatalysts for OER. Oxygen vacancy engineering is an effective approach to tune the electronic structure of electrocatalysts and the surface absorption/desorption of reactants, and the important roles of oxygen vacancies play in electrocatalytic OER have been demonstrated by many groups. To make the oxygen vacancy effect clear, the recent development of manipulating the oxygen vacancies in electrocatalysts for enhancing OER performance is reviewed here and the proposed mechanisms for the enhanced performance are discussed in detail. Various approaches for generating oxygen vacancies in electrocatalysts and characterization methods for oxygen vacancies are also summarized. Furthermore, the challenges in designing high-efficient OER electrocatalysts and outlooks in understanding the oxygen vacancy-activity relationship are discussed.									214	7	0	0	10	0	214			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000560078000006

It requires efficient catalysts to accelerate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for sustained water oxidation, avoiding chlorine evolution under acidic conditions or hypochlorite formation in alkaline solutions. Conventional metal oxide-based OER catalysts follow the adsorbate evolution mechanism that involves concerted proton-electron transfer steps at the active sites. Thus, on the scale of reversible hydrogen electrode, their catalytic activity is independent of the pH of electrolytes. In the present study, nanostructured cobalt carbonate hydroxide (CoCH) with sequential proton-electron transfer properties was tested as a catalyst for seawater oxygen evolution. CoCH exhibited pH-dependent water oxidation activities, thereby providing larger potential and current operating windows for selective water oxidation compared to the catalysts with pH-independent OER activities. The operating window can be further expanded by increasing the pH of the electrolyte.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2168-0485			WOS:000643606000028

Catalysts are crucial to high-efficiency conversion of water to hydrogen and oxygen. Although transition metal nitrides (TMNs) are promising HER and OER catalysts due to the unique electronic structure and high electrical conductivity, single-phase nitrides have inferior activity compared to Pt-group metals because of the unsatisfactory metal-hydrogen (M-H) bonding strength. TMNs-based composites in combination with other metals, carbon materials, and metallic compounds have been demonstrated to possess improved catalytic properties because the modified electronic structure leads to balanced M-H bonding strength, synergistic effects, and improved electrochemical stability. Herein, recent progress pertaining to TMNs is reviewed from the perspective of advanced catalysts for electrochemical water splitting. The challenges and future opportunities confronting TMNs-based catalysts are also discussed.									172	12	0	0	5	0	177			2398-4902			WOS:000457548700003

Besides striving to explore catalysts with new compositions and structures, developing efficient tuning strategy to improve the performance of existing catalysts is of vital importance as well. Here, a sodium-ion electrochemical tuning method is proposed to improve the oxygen evolution catalytic activity of Prussian blue analog (PBA) hexacyanoferrate by tuning the oxidation states and defects in PBA structures. Compared with pristine PBA, the modified catalysts show a significant improvement in OER catalysis, with a decreased Tafel slope from 69 mV/dec to 41 mV/dec and an overpotential drop of 50 mV at 5 mA/mF. This work may promote the application of PBA in OER catalysis and more importantly provide a simple and effective strategy on tuning oxidation state and defects in material microstructures.

Here, reported is the successful deployment of cost-effective iron-based perovskites into efficient water splitting catalysts with both high activity and stability by combined bulk and morphology tuning strategy. Through constructing 3D ordered macroporous (3DOM) structure of LaFeO3 perovskite, approximately twofold and approximately fourfold enhancement in activity for OER and HER, respectively were realized together with much improved OER durability. By a small amount of cobalt doping, both catalytic activity and stability were further improved with activity comparing favorably to or even outperforming Co-/Ni-rich perovskite catalysts. Enhanced performance is correlated with optimized Fe/O species, high surface area, and good charge/mass transport.									63	6	0	0	0	0	63			2196-7350			WOS:000459631900013

The catalyst can be grown in a 3D hierarchical structure directly on a nickel substrate, thus making it an ideal candidate for practical water splitting devices. The activity of the catalyst towards the HER, together with its high stability especially in acidic solution, makes it one of the best non-noble materials described to date. Furthermore, Ni5P4 was investigated in the OER and showed activity superior to pristine nickel or platinum. The practical relevance of Ni5P4 as a bifunctional catalyst for the overall water splitting reaction was demonstrated, with 10 mA cm(-2) achieved below 1.7 V.									646	35	0	0	20	0	654			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000363397300018	26129698

Here, we have designed and synthesized a redox active porous organic polymer (TAPA-PG) by the Schiff base condensation reaction between 4,4 ',4 ''-triaminotriphenylamine (TAPA, donor) and 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol (PG, acceptor). The TAPA-PG possesses permanent microporosity and shows spherical nano-morphologies with diameter of 400-500 nm. TAPA-PG shows electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with an overpotential of 190 mV. Interestingly, TAPA-PG is found to be efficient for in situ reduction of the Co(II) to Co(0) under ambient conditions, and results in a cobalt nanoparticles-stabilized polymer matrix (Co@TAPA-PG). Co@TAPA-PG displays bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for ORR as well as oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Co@TAPA-PG shows improved ORR catalysis as the overpotential dropped down significantly to 120 mV. The OER catalytic performance results in the maximum current density of 15.8 mA/cm(2).The overpotential for OER is found to be 560 mV at the current density of 10 mA/cm(2).									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2196-0216			WOS:000477961200026

Ca2Sr2Mn2FeO10-delta has a structure where corner-sharing (Mn/Fe)O-6 octahedra form triple-layered stacks and Ca/Sr are located in spaces within and between the stacks. The incorporation of cobalt results in Ca2Sr2Mn2CoO10-delta, which has a greater concentration of oxygen vacancies and a quasi-one-dimensional structure, consisting of chains of CoO6-MnO6-MnO6-CoO6 polyhedra with distorted trigonal prismatic and octahedral geometry. Detailed investigation of the electrocatalytic activities of these materials indicates that these compounds are able to catalyze both half reactions of water splitting, namely, hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen-evolution reaction (OER). Ca2Sr2Mn2CoO10-delta shows enhanced electrocatalytic properties compared with Ca2Sr2Mn2FeO10-delta. The former material exhibits lower overpotential and greater electrochemically active surface area, as well as faster kinetics for both HER and OER processes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000710051500001

The development of MoS2 edge supported single-atom catalysts (SACs) for both the HER and OER is critical for overall water splitting. In this work, for the purpose of triggering OER performance and maintaining HER performance, 28 single transition-metal (TM) SACs supported on MoS2 edges as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting have been screened by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In order to design and achieve high OER performance, a simple equation derived from the chemical environment and local structure of the active center is used as a structure descriptor to predict the OER activities of MoS2-based SACs. Among these candidates, the T1-vacancy termination modified using a Pt single atom shows the lowest theoretical overpotential for the hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction being just -0.10/0.46 V, respectively, which is comparable to those of the precious-metal-group benchmark catalysts for overall water splitting. It is expected that our results can offer a theoretical basis for simplifying and steering the design of efficient electrocatalytic materials.									39	2	0	0	0	0	38			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000498838100057	31621737

In this work, nickel nanoparticles (from Ni(COD)(2)) were supported on CTF-1 materials, which were synthesized from 1,4-dicyanobenzene at 400 degrees C and 600 degrees C by the ionothermal method. CTF-1-600 and Ni/CTF-1-600 show high catalytic activity towards OER and a clear activity for the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Ni/CTF-1-600 requires 374 mV overpotential in OER to reach 10 mA/cm(2), which outperforms the benchmark RuO2 catalyst, which requires 403 mV under the same conditions. Ni/CTF-1-600 displays an OER catalytic activity comparable with many nickel-based electro-catalysts and is a potential candidate for OER. The same Ni/CTF-1-600 material shows a half-wave potential of 0.775 V for ORR, which is slightly lower than that of commercial Pt/C (0.890 V). Additionally, after accelerated durability tests of 2000 cycles, the material showed only a slight decrease in activity towards both OER and ORR, demonstrating its superior stability.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2190-4286			WOS:000531472700001	32509491

The synthesized samples exhibit rough, curly and porous structure, benefiting the gaseous transfer and diffusion during the electrocatalytic procedure. As expected, the obtained Mn doped CoP3 nanowire arrays with the doped concentration of 5% exhibit the promoted electrocatalytic activity, the overpotentials of 280 mV for oxygen evolution reaction and 96 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction afford the current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2), which indicates that the electrocatalytic performance can be dramatically enhanced via Mn doping. The Mn doped CoP3 electrocatalysts with increasing catalytic activity should be of high potential in the field of overall water splitting. This study also opens an avenue for further enhancing the electrocatalytic activity via tuning the electronic structures by doping.

A sustainable energy generation from water and sunlight holds a great promise to solve current energy and environmental challenges. However, low-cost, but efficient, catalysts are required. In this study, a rationally designed N, S co-doped three-dimensional porous graphitic network (N, S-3DPG) was used as a low-cost, highly efficient tri-functional catalyst to simultaneously catalyze hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for photo-electrochemical water splitting to generate hydrogen fuel, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for oxygen generation from water, and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for generation of clean electricity from hydrogen and oxygen gases in fuel cells. Based on the resultant multifunctional catalyst, the combination of photo-electrochemical water splitting, powered by CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells, for on-site generation of O-2 and H-2 gases with a H-2-O-2 fuel cell created a cost-effective and H-2-storage-free approach toward renewable generation of clean electricity. This work represents a new conceptually important approach to cost-effective generation of clean and renewable electricity from sunlight and water.									72	6	0	0	1	0	74			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000415302600040

Our experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show the 3D p-FGDY/CC network is highly active and it is a high potential metal-free catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as well as overall water splitting (OWS) under both acidic and alkaline conditions. The experimental and theoretical results show very good consistency; for example, in the HER process, p-FGDY/CC exhibits small overpotentials of 82 and 92 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) under alkaline and acidic conditions, respectively. This ensures an even higher selectivity for the adsorption/desorption of various O/H intermediate species. The essential key promotion accomplishes a bifunctional H2O redox performance application under pH-universal electrochemical conditions.									82	14	0	0	3	0	84			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000480137800001	31309671

Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and the emerging sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered as two of the most promising energy storage devices, and electrocatalysis processes play critical roles in energy conversion techniques that achieve mutual transformation between renewable electricity and chemical energies. It has been demonstrated that nanostructured metal chalcogenides including metal sulfides and metal selenides show great potential for efficient energy storage and conversion due to their unique physicochemical properties. In this feature article, the recent research progress on nanostructured metal sulfides and metal selenides for application in SIBs/LIBs and hydrogen/oxygen electrocatalysis (hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and oxygen reduction reaction) is summarized and discussed. The corresponding electrochemical mechanisms, critical issues, and effective strategies towards performance improvement are presented. Finally, the remaining challenges and perspectives for the future development of metal chalcogenides in the energy research field are proposed.									242	9	0	0	6	0	244			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000411027300009

In this work, we report that the OER performance of commercial catalysts of IrO2, Co3O4, and Pt-C can be improved by replacing the traditional Nafion((R)) ionomer with newly synthesized copolymers consisting of protonated imidazolium moieties such as ion conductors and binders in electrodes. Specifically, such an improvement in OER performance for all the tested catalysts is more significant in basic and neutral environments than that under acidic conditions.

The effect of the mixture electrolyte on current density, oxygen solubility, diffusion coefficient and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) mechanism was investigated. The presence of [BMP][NTf2] increases the solubility of oxygen and while DMSO improves the reversibility of ORR and OER by facilitating the solubility of Li2Ox. Cyclic voltammetric studies showed that mixed electrolyte showed significantly enhanced current density and reversibility for ORR and OER compared to pure DMSO or [BMP][NTf2]. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we report a bifunctional FeCoOOH nanosheet catalyst for highly efficient electrochemical water splitting in an alkaline electrolyte. The FeCoOOH nanosheet arrays were grown directly on the surface of a porous Ni foam by using a simple hydrothermal method. Because of their binary oxyhydroxide structure and high electrical conductivity intrinsic to direct growth, these FeCoOOH nanosheets exhibited excellent activities toward both the HER and OER. With the use of this bifunctional FeCoOOH catalyst, an alkaline water electrolyzer in a two-electrode configuration achieved 10mAcm(-2) only at a cell voltage of 1.62V without iR compensation in 1m KOH, which outperformed that based on the combination of commercial IrO2 and Pt/C catalysts.									42	3	0	0	0	0	42			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000428378300034	29430737

Although, conventional precious metal-based catalysts such as platinum, iridium, and ruthenium are able to efficiently catalyze the conversion of chemical to electrical energy, they are often very costly, scarce, and suffer from poor stability, hence impeding their widespread applications. The limitations of the current state-of art catalysts have propelled tremendous efforts in search for alternative catalysts. Notably, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have spurred much enthusiasm because of their natural abundance, low cost, and remarkable catalytic activity. Numerous studies have recounted that doping can tune the properties of TMDs and that vanadium dopants reportedly improve the electrical properties of Group 6 TMDs. Herein, the authors aspire to investigate the effects of doping varying amounts of vanadium on molybdenum dichalcogenides on their electrocatalytic activities toward hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and oxygen reduction reaction. Despite previous studies bespeaking promising effects, the results here demonstrate both improvements and worsening of electrocatalytic performances from varying the stoichiometry of vanadium dopants in molybdenum dichalcogenides, depending on the type of materials and intended electrochemical applications.									10	1	0	0	1	0	10			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000591907700001

In this work, we develop a hierarchical porous electrocatalyst structure utilizing Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets directly synthesized on Ni foam as the conductive and interconnected supports. By coupling with amorphous Ni-B nanoparticles, this hybrid catalyst exhibits dramatically enhanced electrocatalytic activities and durabilities towards OER. In specific, along with the optimized Ni-B loading, this catalyst requires only an impressively small overpotential of 300mV to drive a current density of 100mAcm(-2) for oxygen evolution in 1M KOH electrolyte. Meanwhile, it also yields a small Tafel slope of 49mVdec(-1) and a superior long-term stability. All these results evidently indicate that the hierarchical hybridization of Ni-B with Ni(OH)(2) on Ni foam can effectively synergize the oxygen evolution, opening up a new vista for designing high-performance transition metal-based nanostructures in the field of electrochemical water splitting.									18	2	0	0	1	0	18			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000448790300010

The model included reaction kinetics and it was applied for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Kinetic parameters of OER in the liquid cell were experimentally acquired and applied to the FEM model. Comparison between the experimental and simulated polarization curves demonstrated the reliability of the FEM predictions. The simulations were used to produce maps of the potential and current density distributions of the working and counter electrodes as well as for calculating the distribution of the current density in the liquid electrolyte. Two distinctive electrode geometries were evaluated with the FEM model. It was predicted that non-symmetrical electrode designs can cause unexpected electrochemical behaviour with respect to the electrolyte current density between working and counter electrodes accompanied by the presence of hot spots. The findings suggest that FEM simulations could be key to designing well-performing electrochemical microcells for liquid phase electron microscopy experiments.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000709100500001

As a replacement of very costly Pt/C and IrO2 as cathode and anode materials, respectively, used in water splitting, we have synthesized and characterized two bimetallic nanocrystallites (FeNiSe2 and FeNiSSe) and studied their bi-functional electrocatalytic activity in acidic and alkaline medium for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. Out of these two electrocatalysts, FeNiSSe nanotube is more efficient bi-functional electrocatalyst as compare to FeNiSe2. The electrocatalyst FeNiSSe nanotube required overpotential of 213 mV for oxygen evolution reaction and 91.2 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction to achieve current density 10 mA/cm(2). Besides OER and HER, FeNiSSe nanotube also acts as good bi-functional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting in 1.0 M KOH with small cell voltage 1.56, 1.64 and 1.78 V to reach current density 10, 20 and 50 mA/cm(2), respectively. The remarkable electrocatalytic activity of the FeNiSSe nanotube as compare to FeNiSe2 is due to its lower overpotential, lower Tafel slope value and well distinct nanotube shaped with larger BET surface area, ECSA, ESA, active sites and smaller charge transfer resistance.

To date, many OER electrocatalysts function well in alkaline media, but exhibit poor performances in neutral and acidic media, especially the acidic stability. Herein, sodium-decorated amorphous/crystalline RuO2 with rich oxygen vacancies (a/c-RuO2) was developed as a pH-universal OER electrocatalyst. The a/c-RuO2 shows remarkable resistance to acid corrosion and oxidation during OER, which leads to an extremely high catalytic stability, as confirmed by a negligible overpotential increase after continuously catalyzing OER for 60 h at pH=1. Besides, a/c-RuO2 also exhibits superior OER activities to commercial RuO2 and most reported OER catalysts under all pH conditions. Theoretical calculations indicated that the introduction of Na dopant and oxygen vacancy in RuO2 weakens the adsorption strength of the OER intermediates by engineering the d-band center, thereby lowering the energy barrier for OER.									78	1	0	0	4	0	78			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000671874400001	34121280

Here we report a rationally substituting sp-C strategy for the synthesis of methyl- and hydrogen-substituted graphdiyne (MGDY, HGDY) nanowires arrays as 3D porous flexible metal-free electrodes for AOER. Methyl group in MGDY with stronger electron-pushing effect makes electrons around the acetylenic carbon atoms more delocalized, resulting in more uneven distributed surface charge, and higher intrinsic catalytic activities for AOER than HGDY, with the smaller overpotential of 406 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) than HGDY and previously reported metal-free electrocatalysts. Our results reveal that the modulation of the electronic structure of GDY by selectively substituting sp-C allows for facilitating charge transfer kinetics, improving adsorption of reaction intermediate, and thereby accelerating the sluggish kinetics of AOER. This work provides us an ideal opportunity for studying the exact hydrogen evolution reaction/oxygen evolution reaction mechanisms of metal-free carbon materials.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2053-1583			WOS:000738248200001

Herein, this work reports the composite of Ni doped Fe2O3 (Ni-Fe2O3) with mildly oxidized multi-walled CNT (O-CNT) as an outstanding Mott-Schottky catalyst for OER and MOR. O-CNT acts as a co-catalyst which effectively regulates the charge transfer in Ni-Fe2O3 and thus enhances the electrocatalytic performance. Ni-Fe2O3/O-CNT exhibits a low onset potential of 260 mV and overpotential 310 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution. Being a Mott-Schottky catalyst, it achieves the higher flat band potential of -1.15 V with the carrier density of 0.173x10(24) cm(-3). Further, in presence of 1 M CH3OH, it delivers the MOR current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.46 V vs. RHE. The excellent electrocatalytic OER and MOR activity of Ni-Fe2O3/O-CNT could be attributed to the synergistic interaction between Ni-doped Fe2O3 and O-CNT.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2192-6506			WOS:000789474200001	35499139

Herein, hybrid trifunctional electrocatalysts are explored via a facile one-pot strategy toward an efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The catalysts are rationally designed to be composed by FeCo nanoparticles encapsuled in graphitic carbon films, Co2P nanoparticles, and N,P-codoped carbon nanofiber networks. The FeCo nanoparticles and the synergistic effect from Co2P and FeCo nanoparticles make the dominant contributions to the ORR, OER, and HER activities, respectively. Their bifunctional activity parameter ( increment E) for ORR and OER is low to 0.77 V, which is much smaller than those of most nonprecious metal catalysts ever reported, and comparable with state-of-the-art Pt/C and RuO2 (0.78 V). Accordingly, the as-assembled Zn-air battery exhibits a high power density of 154 mW cm(-2) with a low charge-discharge voltage gap of 0.83 V (at 10 mA cm(-2)) and excellent stability. The as-constructed overall water-splitting cell achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (at 1.68 V), which is comparable to the best reported trifunctional catalysts.									164	8	0	0	7	0	166			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000510687500001

Herein, we report the synthesis of three-dimensional (3D) hybrid carbon nanowire (i.e., Fe/P/C) networks with superior ORR, OER and HER activities and stabilities, and further experimentally confirm the Fe-P bond in the networks is one of the main active sites for ORR, OER and HER for the first time. Under the optimized condition, the resultant Fe/P/C networks show better ORR electrocatalytic activity in alkaline media/comparable activity in acidic media, better durability and stronger methanol tolerance compared to those of 20 wt.% Pt/C. The Fe/P/C networks also exhibit high activity with a potential of 1.56 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 67.1 mV dec(-1) for OER in 1.0 M KOH. Furthermore, as HER electrocatalyst, the Fe/P/C networks need a low overpotential of 256 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4. These make Fe/P/C nanowire networks to be among the best non-precious metal based carbonaceous electrocatalysts for ORR, OER and HER to date.									98	9	0	0	4	0	101			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000397314200024

However, sluggish kinetics of the oxygen-related reactions at air cathodes, i.e., oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), are still worth improving. Noble metals such as platinum (Pt), iridium (Ir), ruthenium (Ru) and their oxides are considered as the benchmark ORR and OER electrocatalysts, but they are expensive and prone to be poisoned due to the fuel crossover effect, and may suffer from agglomeration and leaching after long-term usage. To mitigate these limits, it is highly desirable to design alternative ORR/OER electrocatalysts with prominent performance. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of porous crystalline materials consisting metal ions/clusters coordinated by organic ligands. Their crystalline structure, tunable pore size and high surface area afford them wide opportunities as catalytic materials. This Review covers MOF-derived ORR/OER catalysts in electrochemical energy conversion, with a focus on the different strategies of material design and preparation, such as composition control and nanostructure fabrication, to improve the activity and durability of MOF-derived electrocatalysts.									121	6	0	0	6	0	122			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000412167100005	28752934

Herein, Co–Fe phosphates and their composites with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) were prepared by a simple hydrothermal method, which then acted as oxygen evolution reaction catalysts. In 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution, the as-obtained optimal composite, Co–Fe phosphate/rGO, can catalyze oxygen evolution reaction with a very sharp onset potential and a small over-potential of 338 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm -2. It was found that in these Co–Fe phosphates, the optimal Co:Fe ratio is 0.75:0.25. The excellent electrocatalytic performance of the Co–Fe phosphate/rGO composite would benefit from the synergistic effects between Fe and Co species, as well as rGO substrate providing conductive channels.

Herein, this work presents the MnCo2O4 nanofiber using as a photo-electrocatalyst for OER and ORR. After irradiation with visible light, the MnCo2O4 decreases ca. 17.1% and 15.4% in overpotential of OER and ORR, respectively, while the overpotential of the Co3O4 is reduced ca. 8.6% and 6.4% towards OER and ORR processes, respectively. These results suggest that MnCo2O4 can enhance OER/ORR performances with two-fold higher than Co3O4 under the light illumination. Due to the mixed valence states of Mn2+ and Mn3+ in its spinel structure, the MnCo2O4 has lower band gap energy (1.7 eV) than the Co3O4 nanofiber (2.0 eV). This narrower band gap can facilitate electron transfer from the valence band to the conduction band. Moreover, the photogenerated MnCo2O4* holes can accelerate the reaction with OH- and H2O which subsequently enhances OERperformance.									1	1	0	0	0	0	1			1938-5862			INSPEC:19827833

J	Hu, Wenhui; Wang, Qing; Wu, Shanshan; Huang, Yongmin								Facile one-pot synthesis of a nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon architecture with cobalt oxides encapsulated in graphitic layers as a robust bicatalyst for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				4	43			16920	16927		10.1039/c6ta08103g				2016	2016	The development of future energy technology relies deeply on the design of cheap, sustainable and efficient systems for energy conversion and storage. As for the widespread oxygen electrode reactions, exploiting high efficiency and stable catalysts to boost both oxygen reduction (ORR) and evolution reactions (OER) seems to be a paramount mission. Here, we report a nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon material with cobalt oxide nanoparticles encapsulated in the graphitic layers via a facile one-pot synthesis. Strikingly, the as-fabricated Co-N/C 800 affords a low reversible overvoltage of 0.96 V between ORR and OER, surpassing 270, 390 and 460 mV in potential over 20 wt% Pt/C, RuO2 and IrO2, which makes it a high performance non-precious metal bicatalyst for reversible oxygen electrode reactions.									46	2	0	0	3	0	46			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000387878700020

However, the mechanism of their enhanced. bicatalytic activities remains elusive. Herein, we construct N-doped graphene supported by Co(111) and Fe(110) substrates as bifunctional catalysts for ORR and OER in alkaline media. First-principles calculations show that these heterostructures possess a large number of active sites for ORR and OER with overpotentials comparable to those of noble metal benchmark catalysts. The catalytic activity is modulated by the coupling strength between graphene and the metal substrates, as well as the charge distribution in the graphitic sheet, which is delicately mediated by N-dopants. These theoretical results uncover the key parameters that govern the bicatalytic properties of hybrid materials and help prescribe the principles for designing multifunctional electrocatalysts of high performance.									115	9	0	0	2	1	115			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000405764700051	28621128

Herein, a series of isostructural metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with V-shaped trinuclear clusters was used as an ideal model to investigate the activity of trifunctional electrocatalysis for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), as these clusters contain both coordination unsaturated metal sites (also known as open metal sites, OMSs) and coordination saturation metal sites (CSMSs), corresponding to both ends and the middle of the V-shaped cluster, respectively. Using a combination of single-crystal X-ray diffractometry, Mossbauer spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, the accurate metal sequence of trinuclear clusters and the regulation effect of the active sites were identified, revealing that the adjacent inactive site plays a significant role in regulating the catalytic performance of the endmost active site. The proposed model of metal cluster-based electrocatalysts facilitates the investigation on efficient multifunctional electrocatalysts as well as the related catalytic mechanisms.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000651127700001

In this work, Mn3O4 nanoparticles were embedded into oxygen functionalized carbon nanotubes (Mn3O4/O-CNTs) via a facile wet impregnation method followed by oxygen plasma treatment. The O-CNTs not only act as conductive support for Mn3O4 nanoparticles, but also provide catalytically active centers for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This material benefitted from both the excellent electrocatalytic activity and the separated oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and OER active sites, as the zinc-air battery assembled from the bifunctional Mn3O4/O-CNT electrode exhibits high power density, reaching 86.6 mW cm(-2) with discharge capacity up to 827.6 mAh g' and super cycling stability, which can be stably charged and discharged over as long as 150 h at 2 mA cm(-2).

Now, a facile adsorption-oxidation strategy is used to anchor Fe-III atomically on an ultrathin TiO2 nanobelt to synergistically lower the spin state (e(g) filling ca. 1.08) to enhance the adsorption with oxygen-containing intermediates and improve the electro-conductibility for lower ohmic loss. The electronic structure of the catalyst is predicted by DFT calculation and perfectly confirmed by experimental results. The catalyst exhibits superior performance for OER with overpotential 270 mV @10 mA cm(-2) and 376 mV @100 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solution, which is much better than IrO2/C and RuO2/C and is the best iron-based OER catalyst free of active metals such as Ni, Co, or precious metals.									103	14	0	0	7	0	104			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000502936100001	31743560

The influence of the aging by repetitive triangular potential sweep (RTPS) on the composite electrodes performance toward the oxygen evolution process was studied. The results obtained demonstrate that the RTPS induces the growth of the active nickel hydroxide at the aggregates of bare nickel located on the surface and in the bulk of the electrode. In the case of the composite modified with cobalt, electrochemical aging led to the formation of cobalt oxides.

The influence of electrochemically formed Ni(II) oxide on the nickel electrode was studied and it was found that Ni(II) oxide is being transformed to Ni(III) oxide due to the change in the valence state of active sites of the electrode material. Both the anodic and cathodic peak currents were found to increase steadily with time but at a decreasing rate. With increasing temperature, a shift of the peak potential towards the positive direction and a lowering of the potential difference between the anodic and cathodic peaks indicates a shift of equilibrium potential for oxygen evolution to more negative values and a decrease in the overpotential for this reaction.									64	7	0	0	0	1	70			0360-3199			WOS:A1996TQ13900003

To get insight into the mechanism of experimental observations, we took Ni-NiO/beta-Ga2O3 photocatalytic system as a model and performed detailed density functional theory calculations. Electrochemical computational methods are used to investigate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Our results show that in Ni-n/Ga2O3 (n = 2, 3 and 4) systems, the reaction sites of HER are on Ni-n clusters. Loading Ni-n clusters on Ga2O3 surface importantly reduces the reaction free energy of HER. On the clean Ga2O3 surface, water dissociation is energetically unfavorable. After attaching NinOn (n = 2 and 4) clusters to the surface, water decomposition becomes thermodynamically favorable due to the unsaturated coordination of Ni and O atoms in clusters. The favorable reaction sites of OER focus on NinOn clusters. The rate-determining step of OER can be changed by adsorbing NinOn clusters. Notable reduction of overpotential (0.77-0.87 V) for OER on NinOn/Ga2O3 is found compared with that on clean Ga2O3 surface, which reasonably explains the experimental observation on significant enhancement of activity for generating oxygen after loading NiOx cocatalysts.

The theoretical overpotential was calculated by applying standard density functional theory in combination with the computational standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) model. We showed that by the discovery of a universal scaling relation between the adsorption energies of HOO* vs HO*, it is possible to analyze the reaction free energy diagrams of all the oxides in a general way. This gave rise to an activity volcano that was the same for a wide variety of oxide catalyst materials and a universal descriptor for the oxygen evolution activity, which suggests a fundamental limitation on the maximum oxygen evolution activity of planar oxide catalysts.									2415	82	0	0	140	0	2429			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000293384000012

Herein, we summarize recent advances in this area, including catalyst fabrication and performance in the water-splitting reaction. The catalysts are classified into transition metal fluorides, fluorine-doped and oxyfluoride compounds. All the fluorine-containing catalysts are reported to be efficient for active phase formation because of the increased strength of ionic bonds and the exposure of active sites caused by the fluorine etching effect. The problems and challenges of this approach are also discussed, and it is hoped that this review will be helpful to the scientific community.									18	2	0	0	2	0	18			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000620267700001

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that an anodically grown iridium oxide film was created on the Ir dendrite through a repeated potential sweep between 0.04 and 1.54 V vs. SHE. The highly branched structure of the Ir dendrites with a particle size of similar to 10 nm provides an increased active facet area that is available for OER in comparison to a commercial Ir catalyst, resulting in enhanced activity toward OER.

In this paper, hydrothermal and calcination method are used to in situ grow Co3O4@NiCo2O4 on nickel foam (NF). The formation of Co3O4@NiCo2O4 nanostructures depends on the different hydrothermal time, which further results in the different growth mechanism of Co3O4@NiCo2O4 nanostructures. The result shows that Co3O4@NiCo2O4-8h, as a catalytic material, could play a synergistic role to largely accelerate the electron transfer process and could be efficiently and persistently used in oxygen evolution reaction. The oxygen evolution reaction activity of Co3O4@NiCo2O4-8h material is significantly improved compared with Co3O4, Co3O4@NiCo2O4-6h and Co3O4@NiCo2O4-10 h. When the current density is 50 mA cm(-2), the overpotential is only 290 mV for Co3O4@NiCo2O4-8h material. The enhanced activity Co3O4@NiCo2O4-8h is attributed to more active site exposure, rapid charge transfer and synergistic catalysis of Co3O4 and NiCo2O4.

The electrocatalyst displayed outstanding OER activity in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte with lower overpotential (296 mV at 50 mA center dot cm(-2)) and remarkable durability. Comprehensive analysis shows that reinforcement of the catalytic function is due to the synergistic effect between Ni(OH)(2) and MoS2, which can provide more highly active sites for the catalyst.

Herein, we develop an green and facile strategy to synthesize core-shell nanostructured Ni@CNT with Ni nanoparticles (Ni NPs) distributed inside the CNTs via the formation of metal-phenolic networks, in which the tannic acid (TA), a ubiquitous natural polyphenol, was used as capping agents. Profited from the outstanding confinement effects, the Ni@CNT can prominently promote the electric transport, adsorption and concentration of reactants onto the active sites, which can facilitate the reaction kinetics. The spatial encapsulation and separation by the CNT shells can protect the Ni NPs from the self-aggregation and surface oxidation, realizing high dispersity and stability. The developed Ni@CNT hybrid shows the superior performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline. For OER in 1.0 M KOH, the overpotentials for Ni@CNT at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is only 280 mV.

They have unique layered structure and variable chemical compositions that can be readily tuned. In this review, summarized are the recent advances of synthetic routes to the LMHs with designed morphology, composition, and function for electrocatalysis. Versatile products can be readily derived by hybridization, anion-exchange, surface modification, self-assembly, etc. More importantly, LMHs can be artificially exfoliated into unilamellar nanosheets with a molecular-level thickness of about 1 nm versus 2D lateral size in submicrometer or micrometer scale. Molecular-scale assembly can be then applied to fabricate superlattice-like composites and functional nanofilms with high quality. The hydroxides can be transformed into oxides, nitrides, or other compounds via different preparation procedures, which can further extend their application prospects. In this regard, the most promising electrocatalysis-related applications of LMHs and their derivatives are reviewed, such as oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, CO2 reduction reaction, alcohol or urea electrooxidation, etc. At last, future challenges are also discussed from the aspect of synthesis and application, as well as encouraging advancements are anticipated.									61	4	0	0	1	0	61			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000501828100001

The modification of the experimental system with the exogenous quinones alpha-tocopherol quinone (alpha-TQ) or plastoquinone (PQ) resulted in a pronounced effect on photosynthetic oxygen evolution. The presence of alpha-tocopherolquinone (alpha-TQ) in PS-II samples decreased the rate of red light-induced oxygen evolution but increased the rate of green Iight-induced oxygen evolution. Blue light applied to the assay system in which oxygen evolution was saturated by red light resulted in a further increase of the oxygen signal. These findings are interpreted in terms of a cyclic electron transport around PS-II, regulated by an excitation state of beta-carotene in the reaction centre of PS-II. A mechanism is postulated according to which energetic coupling of beta-carotene in the reaction centre of PS-II and that of other antenna carotenoid pigments is regulated by the portion of the xanthophyll violaxanthin, which is under control of the xanthophyll cycle.									12	0	0	0	11	0	12			0939-5075			WOS:A1995QK48000009

Lithium oxygen battery with an oxygen electrode composed of 80% Ketjen Black (KB) and 20% BCFN9721 delivered a discharge voltage plateau of 2.63 V, which is the highest among different composition ratios of KB and BCFN9721 in the oxygen electrodes. Adding 20% BCFN9721 into KB could effectively reduce the polarization and achieve better bi-functional activities for the electrochemical reactions at positive electrode, especially for the OER. The lithium oxygen battery using BCFN9721 perovskite oxide as the electro-catalyst could run stably for 24 discharge/charge cycles with a fixed capacity of 1000 mAh g(electrode)(-1). The charge polarization could be significantly reduced by BCFN9721 catalyst, thus alleviating the formation of undesired discharge products caused by the corrosion of carbon and decomposition of the electrolyte.

Herein, we synthesized four Co3O4 crystals with different crystal planes and explored the crystal planes' effects on electrochemical water splitting through theoretical and experimental studies for the first time. The results illustrate that the correlation of catalytic activity is established as {111} > {112} > {110} > {001}. Co3O4 crystals exposed with {111} facets show the highest OER (oxygen evolution reaction) and HER (hydrogen evolution reaction) activities. Upon fabrication in an alkaline electrolyzer, the bifunctional {111}parallel to{111} couple manifests the highest catalytic activity and satisfying durability for overall water splitting. Density functional theory (DFT) explains that the {111} facet possesses the biggest dangling bond density, highest surface energy, and smallest absolute value of Delta G(H*), leading to the enhanced electrocatalytic performance. This work will broaden our vision to improve the activity of various electrocatalysts by selectively exposing the specific crystal planes.									106	4	0	0	10	0	109			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000408518800044	28758720

Despite the excellent performance of precious metal-based electrocatalysts for OER and ORR, their high cost and scarcity hamper their large-scale industrial application. As alternatives to precious metal-based electrocatalysts, the development of earth-abundant and efficient catalysts with excellent electrocatalytic performance in both the OER and the ORR is urgently required. Herein, we report a core-shell CoFeS2@CoS2 heterostructure entangled with carbon nanotubes as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the OER and the ORR. The CoFeS2@CoS2 nanocubes entangled with carbon nanotubes show superior electrochemical performance for both the OER and the ORR: a potential of 1.5 V (vs. RHE) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER in alkaline medium and an onset potential of 0.976 V for the ORR.

However, the efficiency of these technologies is fundamentally limited by high overpotentials, which stem from correlations between adsorption energies of different reaction intermediates. We propose a scheme to circumvent these scaling relationships by defining a three-dimensional nanoscopic catalyst structure that capitalizes on different interactions between the intermediates and the catalyst owing to confinement. These nanoscopic channels reduce the theoretical overpotential for oxygen evolution on RuO2 by over 200 mV, corresponding to a 10% increase in theoretical catalyst efficiency compared with a two-dimensional RuO2 surface. This approach may hold promise for other oxygen-evolution catalysts or, more broadly, to other reactions limited by (intermediate) adsorption-energy scaling relationships.									83	3	0	0	5	0	83			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000350473500004

In recent years, Ce-based materials have become very popular as the electrocatalysts for water splitting primarily because of the multivalence state of Ce and easily formed oxygen vacancies readily formed in CeO2. However, until now, this interesting subject has seldom been reviewed, especially for electrocatalysts for alkaline water splitting. Herein, we outline and discuss recent progress on the active sites of Ce-based electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution. Oxygen vacancies and interfaces between CeO2 and mixed metal components could provide optimized binding of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) intermediates, thus promoting HER performance. For the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), Ce3+/Ce4+ redox, oxygen vacancies, and exogenous transition metals could optimize the binding of OER intermediates toward top catalytic activities. The aim of this review is to seek an overall understanding about the reaction sites in Ce-based electrocatalysts for water splitting, which may provide a guide for the future development of HER and OER Ce-based electrocatalysts toward industrial applications.									10	0	0	0	0	0	9			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000750883400012		
J	Zhang, Chuanxiang; Wu, Chao; Gao, Yong; Gong, Yun; Liu, Huiying; He, Jianping								FeNi Nanoparticles Coated on N-doped Ultrathin Graphene-like Nanosheets as Stable Bifunctional Catalyst for Zn-Air Batteries								CHEMISTRY-AN ASIAN JOURNAL				16	12			1592	1602		10.1002/asia.202100347		MAY 2021		JUN 14 2021	2021	High-performance and low-cost bifunctional catalysts are crucial to energy conversion and storage devices. Herein, a novel oxygen electrode catalyst with high oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction (OER/ORR) performance is reported based on bimetal FeNi nanoparticles anchored on N-doped graphene-like carbon (FeNi/N-C). The complete 2D ultrathin carbon nanosheet is induced by etching and stripping of molten sodium chloride and its ions in the carbonization process at suitable temperature. The obtained FeNi/N-C catalyst exhibits rapid reaction kinetics for OER, efficient four electron transfer for ORR, and outstanding bifunctional performance with reversible oxygen electrode index of 0.87 V for OER/ORR. Zn-air batteries with a high open-circuit voltage of 1.46 V and a stable discharge voltage of 1.23 V are assembled using liquid electrolytes, zinc sheet as Zn-electrode and FeNi/N-C coating on carbon cloth as air-electrode. The specific capacity is as high as 816 mAh g(-1) and there is extremely little decay after charge-discharge cycle time of 275 h for the FeNi/N-C as oxygen electrode catalyst in Zn-air battery, which are much better than that assembled with Pt/C-RuO2 catalyst.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000649689600001	33908705

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a semi-reaction of water splitting, is generally the ratedetermining step because of its sluggish kinetics and high overpotential. In this study, a 2D/2D sheet-on-sheet heterostructure of transition metal sulfide and phosphide was successful synthesized via facile hydrothermal treatments followed by a controllable electrodeposition process. Owing to the sheet-on-sheet morphology formed in the electrodeposition process, a highly developed porous structure was formed, which was favorable for the electrode reaction. Additionally, the refined electronic structure resulting from the close interaction of the transition metal sulfide and phosphide was considered in the heterostructure design. At an optimal deposition time, the CoxP@Ni-Co-S grown on nickel foam (NF) exhibited OER activity with low overpotentials of 271 and 289 mV to afford current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm-2, respectively. Benefitting from the highly stable porous structure, CoxP@Ni-Co-S/NF showed a high catalytic stability during the 30-h harsh oxygen evolution process. This 2D/2D sheet-on-sheet transition metal sulfide/phosphide heterostructure provides a new route for the development of practical transition metal oxygen evolution catalysts.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000681219900004

A series of nanocotton-like amorphous ternary Ni-Co-B materials have been successfully prepared by facile electroless deposition method at room temperature and further applied to electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction in 1.0 KOH solution. The morphology, composition and element state of as-prepared materials have been characterized by scanning electron microscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Electrochemical oxygen evolution properties of as-prepared materials have also been systematically investigated by polarization curves, Tafel, EIS and chronoamperometry techniques. When the molar content of nickel salts in raw metal reactants reach to 30%, as-prepared ternary Ni-Co-B electrocatalyst exhibits optimal OER performances with small Tafel slope (113 mV dec(-1)) and low overpotential of 300 mV (vs. RHE) at current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Besides, it presents an excellent electrochemical stability during 55 h chronoamperometry test at constant potential of 1.50 and 1.67 V. The results demonstrate that the proper composition is an important factor to design highly efficient ternary Ni-Co-B electrocatalyst, providing a promising candidate for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction.

The lack of fundamental understanding on catalyst behaviour and on synergistic mechanisms limit the breakthrough for material design. Here, we systematically summarise a variety of investigations and arguments on the mechanism from the microscale (optimal octahedral intermediate with six M-O coordination) to atomic scale (the active site behaviour). The electron-orbital scale (e(g)) is further described for the intrinsic OER activity. The synergistic effect may also lead to a short-cut pathway of lattice-oxygen-mediated mechanism to achieve a smaller overpotential. This review provides a theoretical reference for the design of advanced catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2451-9103			WOS:000799957200008

Herein, a facile approach is proposed for obtaining hierarchically porous cobalt-nitrogen codoped carbon for reversible oxygen reduction and evolution reactions via the pyrolysis of Co/Zn bimetallic coordinated polymers with gradient Co:Zn ratio. The evaporation of Zn species during the pyrolysis process combined with the Kirkendall effect of Co species resulted in the formation of hierarchical porosity, which further creates highly accessible defective sites and improves multiscale mass transfer. The C-7Co93Zn catalyst with optimized defective Co-N-x and small-sized Co3O4 nanoparticles delivers an optimal bifunctional activity with a potential gap of 0.79 V for reversible oxygen reduction reaction (E-1/2) and oxygen evolution reaction (E-j = 10). Moreover, it displays a superior power density of 122 mW cm(-2) and long-term durability in a rechargeable Zn-air battery. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the defects adjacent to Co-N-x display improved electrocatalytic oxygen reduction with a smaller energy barrier. This work provides a facile method for optimizing the Co:Zn ratio towards the synthesis of bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst derived from a class of bimetallic coordinated polymers resulting in hierarchically porous structure and defective cobalt-based active sites.

The applications of non-precious-metal single-atom catalysts (NPM-SACs) have been extensively developed in electrochemical energy technologies such as fuel cells, metal-air batteries, and hydrogen production via water splitting. NPM-SACs can be confined on substrates with various structures and dimensions from 1D to 3D. However, the role of the structural dimensions of substrates has not been critically summarized. In this review, recent advances in NPM-SACs such as facile synthesis, characterization, performance in catalyzing oxygen redox reactions, and related applications are highlighted through a focus on different dimensional substrates (1D, 2D, and 3D). The general fabrication strategies and the catalytic mechanism of NPM-SACs in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are extensively discussed. Moreover, the opportunities and challenges in this emerging field are presented on the basis of its current development.									44	2	0	0	1	0	44			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000521200000002

However, oxygen redox reactions including oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as the core reactions suffer from sluggish kinetics of the multiple electron transfer process. Currently, Pt, RuO2, and IrO2 are considered to be the benchmark catalysts for ORR and OER, but their high price, scarcity and instability hinder them from large-scale application. To overcome these limits, exploring alternative electrocatalysts with low cost, high activity, long-term stability, and earth-abundance is of extreme urgency. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a family of inorganic-organic hybrid materials with high surface areas and tunable structures, making them proper as catalyst candidates. Herein, the recent progress of MOFs and MOF-derived materials for ORR and OER is systematically reviewed, and the relationship between compositions and electrochemical performance is discussed. It is expected that this review can be helpful for the future development of related MOF-based materials with excellent electrochemical performance.									42	11	0	0	1	0	43			1674-7291	1869-1870		WOS:000463714600005

Due to the inevitable formation of oxygenic intermediates on surface sites during the complex reaction steps, the surface structure dynamically evolves toward reaction-preferred active species. To date, transition metal compounds, here defined as TM-Xides, where "X" refers to typical nonmetal elements from group IIIA to VIA, including hydroxide as well, are reported as high-performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. However, more studies observe at least exterior oxidation or amorphization of materials. Thus, whether the TM-Xides can be defined as OER catalysts deserves further discussion. This Review pays attention to recent progress on the surface reconstruction of TM-Xide OER electrocatalysts with an emphasis on the identification of the true active species for OER, and aims at disseminating the real contributors of OER performance, especially under long-duration electrocatalysis.									114	6	0	0	7	0	116			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000483593200012	31267654

However, the nature of the active cobalt species, their role in these reactions, and possible commonalities remain poorly understand. Here, the impact of (redox-inert) germanium dopants on the physicochemical properties of Co3O4 nanoparticles was investigated in electrochemical oxygen evolution and photo-catalytic OWS reactions. A significant enhancement in OER performance on doping is attributed to the restructuring of spinel Co(3)O(4)to serpentine Co3Ge2(OH)(5), with the latter transforming to an oxyhydroxide active phase during OER. Combination of the p-type Co3Ge2(OH)(5) semiconductor as an OEC with an n-type Bi0.5Y0.5VO4 semiconductor doubles the photocatalytic OWS activity of the latter, resulting in H2 and O2 productivities of & SIM;175.7 and & SIM;90.1 smol/h, respectively. Formation of the composite semiconductor induces an intense internal electric field across the p-n junction, facilitating separation of photogenerated carriers and increased OWS activity, which is also validated in alternative photocatalyst, Al-doped SrTiO3. A similar transformation of serpentine Co3Ge2(OH)5 to an oxyhydroxide was not observed during OWS, indicating that Ge doping confers distinct advantages for electrochemical OER vs photocatalytic OWS.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000856500100001

The main challenge in conventional solution combustion synthesis (SCS) is the nanoparticle agglomeration that masks the active sites in catalysts. Herein, we follow a salt assisted solution combustion synthesis route to synthesize LaMnO3 perovskites (LaMnO3-SA) with a lower level of agglomeration and investigate its application for oxygen electrocatalysis. Through an effective incorporation of salt in the redox combustion mixture, the surface area of the particles doubled along with an improved pore size and pore volume distribution. The surface analysis by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated the formation of more surface oxygen defects with the introduction of inert salt that helps the absorption of oxygenated species during electrochemical process. Remarkably, LaMnO3-SA showed superior characteristics in terms of limiting current density, onset potential and half wave potential displaying enhanced bifunctionality towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The mass activity of LaMnO3-SA was almost double and kinetic current density was threefold the value at -0.25 V in comparison to the traditional SCS LaMnO3. This work demonstrates that active sites accessible for oxygen electrocatalysis in solution combustion synthesis can be enhanced through the introduction of an inert salt during the synthesis.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000668217200006

Electrochemical characterizations showed that C@CoP2 delivers an overpotential of 234 mV, retains its initial activity for over 80 h of continuous operation, and exhibits a fast OER rate of 63.8 mV dec(-1) in base.									16	1	0	0	1	0	16			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000471835800017	31091878

Herein, how to utilize composition change and structure reconstruction via an in situ nonmetal element-doping and leaching-induced strategy to develop robust water oxidation catalysts is firstly proposed. The as-obtained Ni-FeOOH with structural transformation presents a remarkable OER activity with an overpotential of 224 mV at 100 mA/cm(2), which is much superior to undoped or unleached catalysts. By tuning the amount of S, the S-doped NiFe-based catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 168 mV at 100 mA/cm(2) for the hydrogen evolution reaction. The electrocatalysts with tunable bifunctionality requires only 1.43 V to drive 10 mA/cm(2) towards overall water splitting. Systematic experiments and characterizations demonstrate that structural reconstruction into highly active oxyhydroxides species and sufficient activation of lattice oxygen redox reactivity are responsible for the fascinating OER activity induced by S doping/leaching.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000782993100002

In this work we present a study of the evolution of the intermediate phases involved in the TFA YBCO growth process under normal pressure conditions and we show that the oxygen partial pressure during pyrolysis of the TFA precursors is an important parameter. The Cu phase after the TFA pyrolysis can be either CuO, Cu(2)O or a mixture of both as the oxygen partial pressure is modified. The kinetics evolution of the intermediate phases has been determined for films pyrolysed in oxygen and nitrogen atmospheres and it is concluded that non-equilibrium phase transformations influence the reaction path towards epitaxial YBCO films and its microstructure. The intermediate phase evolution in these two series of films is summarized in kinetic phase diagrams.									38	3	0	0	0	0	41			0953-2048			WOS:000272611400013

Hydrazine, ethanol, glycol and urea can be easily oxidized than oxygen evolution reaction, but the lack of low-cost and efficient small molecules oxidation reaction electrocatalysts places constraints on their development. Herein, a flexible electrode based on cobalt selenide nanosheet arrays supported on carbon fiber paper (CoSe/CFP) is prepared through a two-step approach. The as obtained CoSe/CFP is efficient for small molecules electrooxidation reaction at the anode and hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathode. Due to the easier oxidation of hydrazine than other species, the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) is investigated in details. An assembled electrolytic cell based on the hydrazine oxidation reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrodes provides a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 0.5 V, long-term durability and 98% Faradaic efficiencies. This novel strategy can greatly lower the imput cell voltage than that under full water splitting (1.6-2.0 V) for cost-effective and energy-saving hydrogen production.									35	1	0	0	0	0	35			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000449444500027

Energetics of the reaction of photosynthetic evolution of oxygen								Biophysics				34	5			958	62						1989	1989	The concept of configurational free energy, a concentration-independent magnitude, is used to analyze the energetics of the reaction of evolution of oxygen. It is shown that the configurational redox potential of this reaction is +1.4 V, i.e. well above that of a primary oxidant; the total energy deficit (1.2 eV) cannot be eliminated by dividing the reaction into individual stages on the assumption of the high binding energies of the intermediate products. The favourable energy profile of the reaction may be ensured by participation in it of bases binding the protons released. The role of the electrostatic interactions in the changes in the acidity of water and other ligands bound at the active centre has been established.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0006-3509			INSPEC:3968884

Herein, a series of Co/Fe bimetal-organic frameworks (MOFs) were fabricated using a facile ultrasonic method at room temperature, as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solution. The Co2Fe-MOF exhibited an overpotential of 280 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 44.7 mV dec(-1), and long-term stability over 12000 s in 1 mol L-1 KOH. This impressive performance was attributed to the high charge transfer rate, large specific surface area, and synergistic effects of the cobalt and iron centers.

Literature thus far suggests that the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (i.e ORR and OER) take place at different active sites. However, the design and preparation of oxygen electrocatalysts with high-performance is still a great challenge. This work develops a general approach to introduce a nanoparticle that offers oxygen evolution reaction sites onto an oxygen reduction reaction catalyst via rapid microwave treatment. The metal-organic frameworks (Co, ZIF-8) derived Co-N-C with high ORR performance is employed as a support to homogeneously disperse OER active Ni3Fe nanoparticles. Potentials of 1.54 V and 0.79 V have been achieved at current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and 3 mA cm(-2) toward ORR, respectively. The developed rechargeable Zn-air battery assembled with Ni3Fe/Co-N-C as an oxygen-electrode exhibits superior efficiency and robust durability, exceeding that of commercial Pt/C + IrO2. Furthermore, the satisfactory activity of our fabricated wristband shows the successfully practical application of flexible Zn-air batteries for wearable devices.									39	3	0	0	5	0	39			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000537392600006

The results of first-principles calculations show that this composite structure has the photocatalytic mechanism of Z-scheme heterostructure, which is helpful for improving the photocatalytic efficiency. Calculations of Gibbs free energy changes confirm the thermodynamic feasibility of hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction in MoSSe/BiVO4(010) heterostructures.

Herein, we develop an oxygen-vacancy-rich TiO2 supported RuO2 catalyst (RuO2@r-TiO2) towards improved OER activity and stability. The oxygen vacancy on TiO2 not only supplies electrons to produce lower valence Ru, but also provides sufficient anchoring site for the deposition of RuO2 nanocrystal. Beyond that, it can generate strong electronic interaction between TiO2 and supported RuO2, and thereby tailors the intermediates' adsorption energy on the RuO2 surface. As a result, the derived RuO2@r-TiO2 catalyst exhibits superior OER activity and stability with the overpotential of 211 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and negligible activity degradation after 6 h operation, outperforming the non-oxygen-vacancy counterpart (223.3 mV, 12.75% activity loss) and RuO2 catalyst (234.6 mV, 42.86% activity loss).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1674-7321	1869-1900		WOS:000818728800001

Hydrogen is a potential energy carrier because of its advantageous properties, and the electrolysis of water is considered as an efficient method for its industrial production. However, the high-energy conversion efficiency of electrochemical water splitting requires cost-effective and highly active electrocatalysts. Therefore, researchers have aimed to develop high-performance electrode materials based on non-precious and abundant transition metals for conversion devices. Moreover, to further reduce the cost and complexity in real-world applications, bifunctional catalysts that can be simultaneously active on both the anodic (i.e., oxygen evolution reaction, OER) and cathodic (i.e., hydrogen evolution reaction, HER) sides are economically and technically desirable. This Minireview focuses on the recent progress in transition-metal-based materials as bifunctional electrocatalysts, including several promising strategies to promote electrocatalytic activities for overall water splitting in alkaline media, such as chemical doping, defect (vacancy) engineering, phase engineering, facet engineering, and structure engineering. Finally, the potential for further developments in rational electrode materials design is also discussed.									31	2	0	0	1	0	31			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000523694200001	32103541

In this study, dual cation doped Ni3S4 nanosheets loaded on nickel foam were prepared by two step hydrothermal method. Co and Fe dual doping can induce the internal electronic interaction of the catalyst, thus exposing more active sites. Meanwhile, high Ni3+ content enhances the chemisorption of OH-, which is conducive to the transfer of electrons in the reaction process. The electrochemical test results show that Co and Fe doped Ni3S4 have better electrocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution than single cation doped and pure Ni3S4. In 1.0 M KOH solution, the FeCo-Ni3S4 electrode exhibits a remarkable oxygen evolution reaction activity with low overpotentials of 230 mV at 20 mA cm-2 and 279 mV at 100 mA cm-2. The water-alkali electrolyzer using FeCo-Ni3S4 as anode achieves stable overall water splitting with a low potential of 1.47 V at 10 mA cm-2. This work will provide a new direction and guidance for the synthesis and application of transition metal sulfide catalysts.									23	0	0	0	4	0	23			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000729139100004

As compared with LSM, LSMI with the A-site deficiency and the B-site iridium (Ir)-doping has a larger lattice, lower valence state of transition metal, and weaker metal-OH bonding; therefore, it increases the concentration of oxygen vacancy and enhances both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). LSMI exhibits superior ORR performance with only 30 mV onset potential difference from the commercial Pt/C catalyst and significant enhancement in electrocatalytic activity-in the OER process, resulting in the best oxygen electrode material among all the reported perovskite oxides. LSMI also exhibits high durability for both ORR (only 18 mV negative shift for the half-wave potential compared with the initial ORR) and OER process with 10% decay. The electrochemical results indicate that the A-site deficiency and Ir-doping in perovskite oxides could be promising catalysts for the applications in fuel cells, metal-air batteries, and solar fuel synthesis.									62	5	0	0	2	0	64			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000406172700058	28662333

Here, MOF-253-derived nitrogen-doped carbon (N/C)-confined Pt single nanocrystals (Pt@N/C) have been synthesized and shown to be efficient catalysts for the OER. Even with low Pt mass loading of 6.1 wt% (Pt@N/C-10), the catalyst exhibits greatly improved activity and long-time stability as an efficient OER catalyst. Such high catalytic performance is attributed to the core-shell structure relationship, in which the active N-doped-C shell not only provides a protective shield to avoid rapid Pt nanocrystal oxidation at high potentials and inhibits the Pt migration and agglomeration, but also improves the conductivity and charge transfer kinetics.

In quadruple perovskite oxides AA'3B4O12 (A=Ca, Sr, A'=Cu, Mn and B=3d metals), the new reaction mechanism of O-O bond formation between adsorbed oxygen species at adjacent A'-B sites has been proposed in recent studies. This idea of multiple transition metals working together to form an active site, rather than a single active site, is appealing, but has not been systematically investigated so far. This study examined catalytic OER performances of CaMn7O12 quadruple perovskite oxides with precisely controlled Mn(A ')-Mn(B) distance by doping with Sr, Cu and Al. The crystal structure and the state of cations and O were investigated through XRD with Rietveld refinement and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The OER catalytic activity is clearly correlated with the distance of Mn(A')-Mn(B) while both e(g) state of Mn and O 2p band center unchanged. The shrinkage of the A'-B distance affects the stability of O-O bond on A'-B site and accelerates OER kinetics.									5	0	0	0	0	0	4			2196-0216			WOS:000728757600030

Nature communications				13	1			6094	6094		10.1038/s41467-022-33846-0				2022 Oct 15	2022	Promoting the formation of high-oxidation-state transition metal species in a hydroxide catalyst may improve its catalytic activity in the oxygen evolution reaction, which remains difficult to achieve with current synthetic strategies. Herein, we present a synthesis of single-layer NiFeB hydroxide nanosheets and demonstrate the efficacy of electron-deficient boron in promoting the formation of high-oxidation-state Ni for improved oxygen evolution activity. Raman spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and electrochemical analyses show that incorporation of B into a NiFe hydroxide causes a cathodic shift of the Ni2+(OH)2Ni3+deltaOOH transition potential. Density functional theory calculations suggest an elevated oxidation state for Ni and decreased energy barriers for the reaction with the NiFeB hydroxide catalyst. Consequently, a current density of 100mAcm-2 was achieved in 1M KOH at an overpotential of 252mV, placing it among the best Ni-based catalysts for this reaction. This work opens new opportunities in electronic engineering of metal hydroxides (or oxides) for efficient oxygen evolution in water-splitting applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2041-1723		MEDLINE:36241751	36241751

The outstanding OER activity resulted from the nano-micro structure of the prepared electrode with excellent redox activity in an alkaline electrolyte.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000481204100001		
J	Ma, Zhong; Wu, Kai; Wang, Haolin; Zhu, Long; Li, Zhixin; Luo, Yujia; Lu, Yonggang								Mechanism of solid state diffusion on the performance evolution of iron-based oxygen carrier at different operating conditions for chemical looping process								FUEL				331						125699	10.1016/j.fuel.2022.125699				JAN 1 2023	2023	In the oxidation half cycle of chemical looping, the outward diffusion of Fe cations occurred for Fe-based oxygen carriers. The focus of this study is to investigate into the influence of operating conditions on Fe segregation, and then reveal the role of operating conditions in performance evolution of Fe2O3/Al2O3 in the presence of solid state diffusion. The chemical looping cycles were performed at different operating conditions (temperature, oxygen concentration, reduction degree of oxygen carrier). This work evaluated the performance evolution of Fe2O3/Al2O3 in redox cycles and indicated that the generally accepted theory of particle sintering deactivation in gas-solid reactions was incomplete, which ignored the solid state diffusion in oxygen carrier particles. Contrary to the traditional view, the effect of reaction temperature on the performance evolution of oxygen carrier is conditional, depending on the dominating mechanism of solid state diffusion in redox cycles. The results of the experiment confirmed that the surface enrichment of active components enabled more active components to participate in gas-solid reactions on the surface of material particles, which leaded to a higher deactivation rate at low temperature: 700 ? (68.33 %) > 800 ? (54.41 %) > 900 ? (29.73 %). Reducing the oxygen concentration in oxidation half cycle and reduction degree can effectively inhibit the solid state diffusion of Fe2O3/Al2O3. When the oxygen concentration is reduced to 1 %, the Fe2O3/Al2O3 has the lowest deactivation rate, which is only 9.92 %. This study provided more experimental and theoretical results for better understanding the performance evolution of iron-based oxygen carriers.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000854558200005

The performance of the material as an electrocatalyst in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was investigated. The results indicated that the Co_4S_3 nanosheets have excellent electrocatalytic properties with an overpotential of 377 mV at the current density of 10 mA/cm~2 and a small Tafel slope of 64.47 mV/dec. It was found that some synthesis parameters,such as the reaction temperature and the solvent ratio (diethylenetriamine∶ water), have little effect on the OER catalytic activity of the product,but Fe~(3+) doping can significantly reduce the oxygen evolution overpotential and Tafel slope,and also enhance OER stability. The reasons for these changes in OER activity were analyzed by XPS.			采用溶剂热和超声剥离相结合的方法制备了超薄Co_4S_3纳米片,通过透射电子显微镜(TEM) 、扫描电子显微镜(SEM) 、原子力显微镜(AFM) 、X-射线衍射分析(XRD) 、拉曼光谱(Raman)等手段对其进行了结构和形貌的表征,并研究了其电催化产氧性能。结果表明,Co_4S_3纳米片在电流密度为10 mA/cm~2下的过电势为377 mV,塔菲尔(Tafel)斜率为64.47 mV/dec;溶剂热过程中反应温度和溶剂比对产物的析氧反应(OER)催化活性影响不大,但是Fe~(3+)的掺杂可以显著降低Co_4S_3纳米片的析氧过电势和Tafel斜率,提高材料的电催化稳定性。最后通过X-射线光电子能谱(XPS)分析了Fe~(3+)的掺杂对Co_4S_3纳米片OER性能影响的机理。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1671-4628			CSCD:6848332

However, the difficulties associated with BP synthesis severely hinder the further development of BP for any potential applications. On the other hand, searching for other potential applications of BP is also a big challenge. A facile strategy was developed for preparation of BP supported on Ti foil (BP-Ti) in a thin-film form. Surprisingly, the as-prepared BP shows advanced electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). To improve the OER activity of the electrocatalyst, BP was grown on a carbon nanotube network (BP-CNT), showing even better activity. The results demonstrate that BP can be prepared by a facile method and may be applied as an electrocatalyst.									239	20	0	0	14	0	241			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000387024200032	27682470

Although several strategies recently have been developed to fabricate NiFeOOH electrodes, such as electrodeposition, hydrothermal reaction, corrosion engineering, etc., it has been a challenge to directly tune the energy level, conductivity and surface properties (such as molecular adsorption) of NiFeOOH with less time-consuming and convenient synthesis to overcome the relatively sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, we, for the first time, utilize charged droplets to synthesize NiFeOOH with abundant oxygen vacancies (O-v) via the convenient electrospraying (ESI) approach without necessitating additional post-treatments. Specifically, the optimized NiFeOOH delivers much lower overpotentials of 145 mV, 215 mV and 360 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and overall water splitting in 1 M KOH at 10 mA cm(-2) with long-term durability over 180 h. The good performing electrocatalyst is much improved compared with the benchmark Pt/C/NF in the high current density region, RuO2/NF and other NiFe-based electrocatalysts. Simultaneously, the unique reaction environment of the droplet (confinement, superacid and desolvation) was further explored to understand the synthesis reaction acceleration process and related oxygen defect formation mechanisms. Also, we used density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the change of free energy of the reaction pathway caused by oxygen vacancies and understand the reaction mechanism of electrocatalysts prepared by different treatment methods. The calculation results show that the shortened Fe-O bonds and oxygen defects of NiFeOOH synergistically improve the interaction between the metal cations and the intermediate species and further accelerate the overall reaction kinetics. This work demonstrates that the charged microdroplet chemistry offers a novel means to expedite the design of powerful electrocatalysts.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000696364300093

It is pointed out that new detection methods can analyze OER reaction mechanism and study the intermediate activity products at atomic level. Optimization of the traditional synthesis method and the development of the new method can improve the catalysts performance.

Reported herein is that regulating charge transfer of lattice oxygen atoms in serial single-atom-doped titania enables tunable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. First-principles calculations disclose that the activity of lattice oxygen for the HER can be regularly promoted by substituting its nearest metal atom, and doping-induced charge transfer plays an essential role. Besides, the realm of the charge transfer of the active site can be enlarged to the second nearest atom by creating oxygen vacancies, resulting in further optimization for the HER. Various single-atom-doped titania nanosheets were fabricated to validate the proposed model. Taking advantage of the localized charge transfer to the lattice atom is demonstrated to be feasible for realizing precise regulation of the electronic structures and thus catalytic activity of the nanosheets.									26	4	0	0	1	0	29			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000532685400001	32293087

Developing highly efficient non -noble multifunctional catalysts in the same electrolyte is an open challenge. Herein, efficient Co N C electrocatalysts with a mixed structure comprising Co N moieties and Co nanoparticles encapsulated in a N-doped carbon layer were prepared via pyrolysis of a new structure of Co -coordinated bis(imino)pyridine polymer constructed by 2,6-diacetylpyridine and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine. Results demonstrate that Co ion sources have a remarkable impact on the final Co N C performance. The Co N C catalyst prepared using cobalt acetate as a precursor displays remarkable overall multifunctional performance. It needs only a cell voltage of 1.66 V (obtained from the half-cell test) for the water-splitting reaction (HER/OER) to reach 10 mA"cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH, and the overall oxygen redox activity (OER/ORR) is 0.72 V in 0.1 M KOH, outperforming the reported nonprecious metal catalysts. The excellent activity is attributable to the synergistic effects between active sites with encapsulated metallic Co for HER and OER and Co N moieties for ORR									51	3	0	0	3	0	51			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000493869700039	31596068

Here, we report the correlation between the calcination temperature of BRO and its catalytic activity in a KOH aqueous solution. It was found that the number of oxygen vacancies of BRO increased and the Tafel slopes for the ORR and OER decreased with an increase in the calcination temperature. The results of this study suggest that the oxygen vacancies of BRO are one of the factors that determine the catalytic activity for not only the ORR but also the OER.

In this study, we synthesized phosphorus incorporated nickel sulfide (Ni3S2@Ni5P4/NF) composite via a simple one-step hydrothermal treatment for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction in basic media. The newly synthesized Ni3S2@Ni5P4/NF composite catalyst shows a remarkable OER activity with an overpotential of 399 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2). Ni3S2@Ni5P4/NF also shows a Tafel slope of 75 mV dec(-1) with long-term stability for more than 15 h in alkaline media. The enhanced electrocatalytic activity of current system is among best catalysts based on Nickle sulfides and nickel phosphides according to our knowledge. Current enhancement can be attributed to fast electron transfer due to synergistic effect of Ni3S2 and Ni5P4 in the composite. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, we report a sea urchin-like cobalt phosphosulfide (CoPS) ternary compound for overall water splitting. Because CoPS contains more than one nonmetallic element, ternary compounds possess dianions might lead to modulated electronic structure and thus modified their electrocatalytic properties. Our DFT calculation results reveal that the ternary CoPS exhibits favorable performance for both the oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction. Experimentally set as cathode and anode in a full cell for overall water splitting, the CoPS cell needs a voltage of only similar to 1.59 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and has outstanding stability. Our results open up a path to search for alternative bifunctional electrocatalyst materials to substitute for noble metals in overall water splitting. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, Fe3+ dopants and flower-shaped CeO2-decorated NiOOH catalysts are synthesized, and the synergetic effect of Fe3+ dopants and CeO2 are investigated. The presence of both Fe3+ dopants and CeO2 produces more NiOOH species and more oxygen vacancies in the NiOOH structure as measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Electrochemical measurements illustrate that the increase in oxygen vacancies in NiOOH significantly increases the conductivity and activity of the catalyst and reduces the OER overpotential. Among the catalysts studied in this research, CeO2-NiFeOH/NF, which is modified by both Fe3+ dopants and CeO2, hosts the highest number of oxygen vacancies. It also has the lowest overpotential (280 mV), the highest current density, and excellent stability with high performance for the OER.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1452-3981			WOS:000474380600050

Oxygen electrocatalysis plays essential roles as the electrocatalytic reduction and evolution of di-oxygen are always the performance-limiting factors of these devices relying on oxygen electrochemistry. A novel perovskite with the formula La(Co0.55Mn0.45)(0.99)O3-delta (LCMO) is designed from molecular orbital principles. The hydrothermally synthesized LCMO nanorods have unique structural and chemical properties and possess high intrinsic activities for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The synergic covalent coupling between LCMO and NrGO enhances the bifunctional ORR and OER activities of the novel LCMO/NrGO hybrid catalyst. The ORR activity of LCMO/NrGO is comparable to the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst and its OER activity is competitive to the state-of-the-art Ir/C catalyst. LCMO/NrGO generally outperforms Pt/C and Ir/C with better bifunctional ORR and OER performance and operating durability. LCMO/NrGO represents a new class of low-cost, efficient and durable electrocatalysts for fuel cells, water electrolysers and batteries.									64	2	0	0	3	0	64			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000354204400045	25921031

Although recent advances have been achieved in the development of various cobalt sulfide composites to expedite their oxygen reduction reaction properties, to improve their poor oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity is still challenging, which significantly limits their utilization. Here, the synthesis of Fe3O4-decorated Co9S8 nanoparticles in situ grown on a reduced graphene oxide surface (Fe3O4@Co9S8/rGO) and the use of it as a remarkably active and stable OER catalyst are first reported. Loading of Fe3O4 on cobalt sulfide induces the formation of pure phase Co9S8 and highly improves the catalytic activity for OER. The composite exhibits superior OER performance with a small overpotential of 0.34 V at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and high stability. It is believed that the electron transfer trend from Fe species to Co9S8 promotes the breaking of the Co-O bond in the stable configuration (Co-O-O superoxo group), attributing to the excellent catalytic activity. This development offers a new and effective cobalt sulfide-based oxygen evolution electrocatalysts to replace the expensive commercial catalysts such as RuO2 or IrO2.									306	17	0	0	9	0	308			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000380887300011

Density, viscosity, and dissolved oxygen concentration for MgCl2 solutions were also measured. A 2-electron transfer for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on Pt was determined using a rotating disk electrode. SS304 L displayed non-Levich behavior for ORR and, due to ORR suppression and buffering of near surface pH by Mg-species precipitation, the primary cathodic reaction was the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in saturated MgCl2. Furthermore, non-carbonate precipitates were found to be kinetically favored. Implications of HER are discussed through atmospheric corrosion and stress corrosion cracking.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			0010-938X	1879-0496		WOS:000596028600001

This selectivity issue is elucidated on the microscopic level with the single-crystalline model electrode RuO2(110) by employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations in combination with the concept of volcano plots. We demonstrate that one monolayer of TiO2(110) supported on RuO2(110) enhances the selectivity towards the CER by several orders of magnitudes, while preserving the high activity for the CER. This win-win situation is attributed to the different slopes of the volcano curves for the CER and OER.									129	1	0	0	11	0	129			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000343750300039	25154724

Here, by using oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as a model, which has an adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) and a lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM), we demonstrate a general strategy for steering the two mechanisms on various LaxSr1-xCoO3-delta. By delicately controlling the oxygen defect contents, the dominant OER mechanism on LaxSr1-xCoO3-delta can be arbitrarily transformed between AEM-LOM-AEM accompanied by a volcano-type activity variation trend. Experimental and computational evidence explicitly reveal that the phenomenon is due to the fact that the increased oxygen defects alter the lattice oxygen activity with a volcano-type trend and preserve the Co-0 state for preferably OER. Therefore, we achieve the co-optimization between the activity and stability of catalysts by altering the mechanism rather than a specific design of catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2375-2548			WOS:000836554300039	35905191

It is ball milled with zirconia balls for 7 and 14 days. The particle size and surface area of the ball milled TaC are analyzed using scanning electron microscopy and nitrogen physisorption methods, respectively. After 14 days of ball milling, the TaC shows smaller particle size and larger surface area compared to after 7 days of ball milling and unmilled TaC. The long-term electrochemical stability of the ball milled TaC is evaluated under oxygen evolution reaction conditions using cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The ball milled support at a fixed voltage of 1.6 V is shown to be stable up to 5000 cycles.

The P-Ir particles show an atomic ratio of 2:1 (P:Ir) and a highly uniform size of 1.8-3.6 nm (>90%). Compared to the Ir nanoparticles, the present P-Ir catalyst displays higher catalytic activities in acidic, alkaline, and neutral solutions. The P-Ir catalyst only requires an onset-potential of 190 mV for oxygen evolution in the solution of 0.1M HClO4. Compared with Ir catalyst, the P-Ir reduces the overpotential similar to 30 mV to achieve the oxygen-evolution current densities of 10 and 30 mA cm(-2), respectively. Additionally, at an overpotential of 266 mV, P-Ir obtains a mass activity 1.7 times higher than Ir. Importantly, the P-Ir catalyst shows ultrahigh stability in acidic condition. The enhancement in electrocatalysis should be ascribed to the phosphorus introduction.

Herein, a hydrothermal synthesis employing the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate as structure-directing agent is developed to fabricate a family of crystalline mesoporous metal oxides (meso-MO X , M = Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Ce). The pore size and specific surface area depend on the metal used and they range from 3 to 6 nm and 60 to 200 m(2) g(-1), respectively. NiO and Co3O4 show a higher catalytic efficiency in alkaline media in comparison with the other oxides studied, and their activities are comparable with the values reported for platinum group metal (PGM)-based electrocatalysts. This stems from lower voltage losses and by the presence of specific hydroxide adsorbates on the surface. Both ORR and OER driven on Co3O4 show the unified rate-determining chemical step (|OO-|(center dot) (ads) + H2O <-> |OOH|(center dot) (ads) + OH-, where | X | ads are the species adsorbed on active sites). The bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysis obtained on mesoporous NiO is utilized for the first symmetrical PGM-free oxygen pump fed by air and water only.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000863488800001

Herein, flexible nanorods-integrated succulent-like Bi2S3/Ni3S2/NF heterostructure has been prepared by a facile solvothermal method and applied for OER. We highlight the unique nonequivalent sp a hybridization of P-region metal based sulfides, which makes a possibility of electronic inductive effect and enhanced electrocatalytic performance. The Bi2S3/Ni3S2/NF catalyst shows low overpotential 268 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and low Tafel slope of 82 mV dec(-1). Long-term stability evaluated at high current density suggests that succulent-like Bi2S3/Ni3S2 could be a promising alternative to noble-metal based electrocatalysts for water oxidation reaction in alkaline medium.

Herein, a direct synthesis methodology is proposed as a guidance for the bulk synthesis of organic framework materials. Framework porphyrin (POF) materials are one-pot synthesized to demonstrate the advances of the direct synthesis methodology. The as-synthesized POF materials are intrinsically 2D and exhibit impressive versatility in composition, structure, morphology, and function, delivering a free-standing POF film, hybrids of POF and nanocarbon, and cobalt-coordinated POF. When applied as electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, the cobalt-coordinated POF exhibits excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic performances comparable with noble-metal-based electrocatalysts. The direct synthesis methodology and resultant POF materials demonstrate the ability of controlling materials at the atomic level for energy electrocatalysis.									58	12	0	0	3	0	58			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000478629500011

However, limited by the available compositions, the explored electrocatalytic reactions on NMAs are highly restricted and certain important electrochemical processes have not been investigated. Here, an effective gelation approach is demonstrated by using a strong salting-out agent (i.e., NH4F), thereby expanding the composition of NMAs to various multimetallic systems and providing a platform to investigate composition-dependent electrocatalytic performance of NMAs. Combining structural features of aerogels and optimized chemical compositions, the Au-Pt and Au-Rh aerogel catalysts manifest remarkable pH-universal (pH = 0-14) performance surpassing commercial Pt/C and many other nanoparticle (NP)-based catalysts in the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, and water splitting, displaying enormous potential for the electrochemical hydrogen production, fuel cells, etc.									47	1	0	0	5	0	48			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000514011300001

Water electrolysis is a promising option for hydrogen production from renewable resources such as wind and solar energy. To date, tremendous efforts have been devoted to the development of electrocatalysts and membranes for water electrolysis technology. In principle, water electrolysis in acidic media has several advantages over that in alkaline media, including favorable reaction kinetics, easy product separation, and low operating pressure. However, acidic water electrolysis poses higher requirements for the catalysts, especially the ones for the oxygen evolution reaction. It is a grand challenge to develop highly active, durable, and cost-effective catalysts to replace precious metal catalysts for acidic water oxidation. In this article, an overview is presented of the latest developments in design and synthesis of electrocatalysts for acidic water oxidation, emphasizing new strategies for achieving high electrocatalytic activity while maintaining excellent durability at low cost. In particular, the reaction pathways and intermediates are discussed in detail to gain deeper insight into the oxygen evolution reaction mechanism, which is vital to rational design of more efficient electrocatalysts. Further, the remaining scientific challenges and possible strategies to overcome them are outlined, together with perspectives for future-generation electrocatalysts that exploit nanoscale materials for water electrolysis.									79	4	0	0	1	0	80			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000529146500001

In alkaline media, the Fe/Ni-N-CNFs catalysts (especially for Fe1Ni1-N-CNFs) exhibit remarkable electrocatalytic performances of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER). For ORR catalytic activity, Fe1Ni1-N-CNFs catalyst offers a higher onset potential of 0.903 V, a similar four-electron reaction pathway, and excellent stability.

The changes the catalysts undergo during the oxygen evolution reaction can be tracked by probing the electronic structure using UV-vis spectroscopy. These findings are compared to ex situ analyses, which support the assignments of the structures stabilized under different potentials. Thus, structure-activity correlations can be proposed, and deeper insights into the catalytically active structures can be obtained.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000509894100023

The catalytic activities toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were evaluated by linear-sweep voltammetry (LSV) in an alkaline electrolyte. The ligand mode of the carboxylate binding is chelating coordination and the ligand mode of imidazole is monodentate ligand in the Co-OBA/C catalyst. The Co-OBA/C catalyst shows much better ORR, OER and bifunctional activities than the Co-OBA + C catalyst due to the synergistic effect between Co-OBA and carbon black in the Co-OBA/C catalyst.

Monoclinic scheelite BiVO4 is a visible-light-responsive semiconductor which has proved to be effective for oxygen evolution. Recently, the synthesis of a series of monoclinic BiVO4 single crystals was reported, and it was found that the (010), (110), and (011) facets are highly exposed and that the photocatalytic O2 evolution activity depends on the degree of exposure of the (010) facets. To explore the properties of and photocatalytic water oxidation reaction on different facets, DFT calculations were performed to investigate the geometric structure, optical properties, electronic structure, water adsorption, and the whole OER free-energy profiles on BiVO4 (010) and (011) facets. The calculated results suggest both favorable and unfavorable factors for OER on the (010) and the (011) facets. Due to the combined effects of the above-mentioned factors, different facets exhibit quite different photocatalytic activities.									141	4	0	0	4	0	142			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000313721500022	23208855

PCC 6803. Four aspects were considered: sequence conservation in three extrinsic proteins for oxygen evolution, steady-state oxygen-evolving activity, charge recombination reactions, i.e., thermoluminescence and oscillation patterns of delayed luminescence on a second time scale and delayed fluorescence on the nanosecond time scale at - 196 degrees C. Even though there were significant differences between the amino acid sequences of extrinsic proteins in G. violaceus and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, the oxygen-evolving activities were similar. The delayed luminescence oscillation patterns and glow curves of thermoluminescence were essentially identical between the two species, and the nanosecond delayed fluorescence spectral profiles and lifetimes were also very similar. These results indicate clearly that even though the oxygen-evolving reactions are carried out in the periplasm by components with altered amino acid sequences, the essential reaction processes for water oxidation are highly conserved. In contrast, we observed significant changes on the reduction side of photosystem II. Based on these data, we discuss the oxygen-evolving activity of G. violaceus. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Using density functional theory with the PBE + U functional and the screened hybrid functional of Heyd, Scuseria, and Ernzerhof (HSE), we compute and analyze the ground-state geometry and electronic structure. We find that MnNiO3 is a ferrimagnetic semiconductor with an indirect band gap, consistent with experimental observations. We also predict that MnNiO3 has promising band edge positions relative to the vacuum, with potential to straddle the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) redox potentials in aqueous solution. A detailed analysis of the band structure and density of states provides a clear explanation for why MnNiO3 has appropriate electronic properties for OER. Furthermore, comprehensive calculations of its Pourbaix diagram suggest that MnNiO3 is stable in alkaline solution at potentials relevant for oxygen evolution.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000349323500025	25582626

Emerging noble metal-free Mo-based bifunctional catalysts for electrochemical energy conversion								NANO RESEARCH											10.1007/s12274-022-5022-y		OCT 2022			2022	The transition from a global economy dependent on fossil fuels to one based on sustainable energy conversion technologies presents the primary challenge of the day. Equipping water electrolyzers and metal-air batteries with earth-abundant bifunctional transition metal (TM) catalysts that efficiently catalyse the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) and the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER), respectively, reduces the cost and system complexity, while also providing prospects for accelerated scaling and sustainable material reuse. Among the TMs, earth-abundant molybdenum (Mo)-based multifunctional catalysts are especially promising and have attracted considerable attention in recent years. Starting with a brief introduction to HER, OER, and ORR mechanisms and parameters governing their bifunctionality, this comprehensive review focuses on such Mo-based multifunctional catalysts. We review and discuss recent progress achieved through the formation of Mo-based compounds, heterostructures, and nanoscale composites, as well as by doping, defect engineering, and nanoscale sculpting of Mo-based catalysts. The systems discussed in detail are based on Mo chalcogenides, carbides, oxides, nitrides, and phosphides, as well as Mo alloys, highlighting specific opportunities afforded by synergistic interactions of Mo with both non-metals and non-noble metals. Finally, we discuss the future of Mo-based multifunctional electrocatalysts for HER/OER, ORR/OER, and HER/ORR/OER, analysing emerging trends, new opportunities, and underexplored avenues in this promising materials space.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000871333600001

Here, we report that intermetallic Co3Mo spontaneously separated from hierarchical nanoporous copper skeleton shows genuine potential as highly efficient electrocatalysts for alkaline hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions in virtue of in-situ hydroxylation and electro-oxidation, respectively. The hydroxylated intermetallic Co3Mo has an optimal hydrogen-binding energy to facilitate adsorption/desorption of hydrogen intermediates for hydrogen molecules. Associated with high electron/ion transport of bicontinuous nanoporous skeleton, nanoporous copper supported Co3Mo electrodes exhibit impressive hydrogen evolution reaction catalysis, with negligible onset overpotential and low Tafel slope (similar to 40mV dec(-1)) in 1M KOH, realizing current density of -400mAcm(-2) at overpotential of as low as 96mV. When coupled to its electro-oxidized derivative that mediates efficiently oxygen evolution reaction, their alkaline electrolyzer operates with a superior overall water-splitting output, outperforming the one assembled with noble-metal-based catalysts. Electrochemical water splitting is an attractive energy conversion technology, but it usually suffers from low efficiency. Here, the authors report intermetallic Co3Mo integrated on porous Cu as highly efficient electrocatalysts for alkaline HER/OER due to in-situ hydroxylation and electro-oxidation.									85	3	0	0	4	0	86			2041-1723			WOS:000543972200001	32522988

However, the sluggish kinetics of its four-electron transfer process becomes a bottleneck to the performance enhancement. Thus, rational design of electrocatalysts for OER based on thorough understanding of mechanisms and structure-activity relationship is of vital significance. This review begins with the introduction of OER mechanisms which include conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism and lattice-oxygen-mediated mechanism. The reaction pathways and related intermediates are discussed in detail, and several descriptors which greatly assist in catalyst screen and optimization are summarized. Some important parameters suggested as measurement criteria for OER are also mentioned and discussed. Then, recent developments and breakthroughs in experimental achievements on transition metal-based OER electrocatalysts are reviewed to reveal the novel design principles. Finally, some perspectives and future directions are proposed for further catalytic performance enhancement and deeper understanding of catalyst design. It is believed that iterative improvements based on the understanding of mechanisms and fundamental design principles are essential to realize the applications of efficient transition metal-based OER electrocatalysts for electrochemical energy storage and conversion technologies.									86	2	0	0	0	0	86			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000659738200001	34114334

As-prepared Ag-MFe2O4/C demonstrated higher catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) than Ag+MFe2O4/C. The direct coupling and electron transfer between Ag and MFe2O4 in nanocomposites were proposed to enhance their catalytic activities.

In this work, we develop sphere-like morphology spinel oxide CoFe2O4/NF by hydrothermal reaction and calcination, and the diameter of the spheres is about 111.1nm. The CoFe2O4/NF catalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance with an overpotential of 273 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 78 mV dec(-1). The cycling stability of CoFe2O4/NF is remarkable, and it only increased by 5 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) after 3000 cycles. Therefore, this simple method to prepare CoFe2O4/NF can enhance the OER properties of electrocatalysts, which makes CoFe2O4/NF a promising material to replace noble metal-based catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction.									19	1	0	0	0	0	20			2046-2069			WOS:000468636000057	35520770

To date, the cost and scarcity of noble-metal catalysts are limiting their scale-up applications. To overcome the current challenge, high-performance novel electrocatalysts are required to speed up the commercialization of electrolysis technology. Notably, the sluggish electrode reactions, namely, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), especially the latter, have been the main rate-limiting factor for water splitting. Phosphate, as a new series of OER electrocatalysts, has attracted enormous attentions, owing to its unique lattice structure geometry. The phosphate group not only benefits the adsorption of water molecule but also facilitates the oxyhydrate of metal site and dissociation of water. This Minireview provides a brief summary of the recent progresses of phosphate-based electrocatalysts, discusses the relationship between crystal structure and catalytic activity, and presents the challenges of phosphate electrocatalysts.									67	3	0	0	0	0	67			2196-0216			WOS:000461673300001

One of the key components in designing the battery is the cathode catalyst that is used to facilitate the cathodic reactions, specifically oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions (ORR and OER). Here we report the facile synthesis of ternary metal oxide/graphene hybrid catalysts by combining ORR-active Co/Mn with OER-active Ni and Fe species to promote the bifunctional activity all in an in situ formed laser-induced graphene flexible film. These hybrid catalysts exhibit high catalytic activity and surpass the performance of precious metal Pt and RuO2 catalysts in Zn-air batteries.

In this work, hetero-porous is rationally engineered for the carbon encapsulated CoFe catalyst, which is highly active toward both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen evolution reaction (ORR). The hs-CoFe catalyst with "plate reactor" structure is facilely synthesized by combining the selective etching and reduced graphene oxide supporting to construct pores with size of 10-100 nm and 100-1000 nm, respectively, for smooth mass transfer. OER/ORR activities are significantly boosted, and difference between the potential to deliver 10 mA/cm(2) OER and half wave potential of ORR is therefore lowered to 0.608 V while this potential difference of Pt/C-IrO2 is 0.732 V. The corresponding ZAB exhibits a maximum power density of 232 mW/cm(2), which sheds light on providing a novel strategy for oxygen reaction catalyst designation.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000729145600008

The catalyst exhibited high activity and low overpotential for O(2) evolution under mild conditions. The main functional composition of the catalyst was a redox couple of Ag(2)O/AgO. Catalytic activity during oxygen evolution was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and Tafel plot. The effects of the concentration, temperature, and pH of K(2)B(4)O(7) solution on the catalyst, and the Faradaic efficiency of the oxygen evolving reaction were examined.

Herein, heteroatoms such as N and S are doped into graphene substrates to improve catalytic activity and structural stability of Ag-MnFe2O4 nanoparticles, Interestingly, these particles keep a primarily heterogeneous structure for their assembly on N, S-codoped graphene (NSG), while Ag domains shrink on S-doped graphene (SG) or N-doped graphene (NG). Subsequently, Ag-MnFe2O4 /NSG shows the best bifunctional catalytic activity due to the improved stability of Ag-MnFe2O4 NPs on NSG and enhanced bonding energy between supports and particles. The Koutecky-Levich plots confirm a major four-electron reaction pathway for the ORRs on Ag-MnFe2O4/NSG. Meanwhile, Ag-MnFe2O4/NSG exhibits higher stability and better methanol tolerance than commercial Pt/C.

Herein, we report a simple NaBH4 reduction tactic to design a novel CoP nanorods electrocatalyst with phosphorus vacancy (Pv) and discuss the effect of Pv content on its oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. It is proved that phosphate formed by filling Pv with oxygen is the key factor affecting the activity of catalyst. CoP with appropriate quantity Pvs have excellent OER activity, including lower overpotential (297 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)), excellent cyclicity (almost no change after 1000 cycles), good stability (small decay after 11 h) and a lower Tafel slope (58.1 mV dec(-1)). The excessive Pvs will hinder the formation of phosphate, thus affecting CoOx (OH)(y) active center production and ultimately reducing the OER performance of the catalyst.

The best NiCo2O4-CN catalyst shows a hierarchical structure composed of interconnected nanosheets, and exhibits versatile bifunctional ORR/OER electroactivities with a half-wave potential of 0.81 V for ORR and an overpotential of 383 mV for OER under a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The zinc-air battery with the NiCo2O4-CN cathode demonstrates superior peak power density (149.6 mW cm(-2)), excellent capacity performance up to 738.7 mAh g(-1) and considerable durability, showing the feasibility of NiCo2O4-CN in electrochemical energy devices.

The hydrous oxide is considered as a porous assembly of interlinked octahedrally coordinated anionic metal oxyhydroxide surfaquo complexes which form an open network structure. The latter contains considerable quantities of water molecules which facilitate hydroxide ion discharge at the metal site during active oxygen evolution. The dynamics of redox switching has been quantified in terms of a diffusive frequency using the Laviron-Aoki diffusion model. Steady state Tafel plot analysis has been used to elucidate the kinetics and mechanism of oxygen evolution with slopes of ca. 60 mVdec(-1) and ca. 120 mVdec(-1) at low and high overpotentials respectively, whereas the reaction order with respect to hydroxide ion activity remains invariant at ca. 1.0 as the potential is increased. These observations are rationalized in terms of a kinetic scheme involving surfaquo groups.

Electrocatalysts based on nitrogen-containing carbon (N-C) materials show promise in catalyzing these reactions; however, there is no systematic review of strategies for the engineering of active and stable N-C-based electrocatalysts. Herein, a comprehensive comparison of recently reported N-C-based electrocatalysts regarding both electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability is presented. In the first part of this review, the relationships between the electrocatalytic reactions and selection of the element to modify the N-C-based materials are discussed. Afterwards, synthesis methods for N-C-based electrocatalysts are summarized, and strategies for the synthesis of highly stable N-C-based electrocatalysts are presented. Multiple tables containing data on crucial parameters for both electrocatalytic activity and stability are displayed in this review. Finally, constructing M-N-x moieties is proposed as the most promising engineering strategy for stable N-C-based electrocatalysts.									17	2	0	0	2	0	17			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000439757800001	29770593

Our results reveal that the formation of an initial cobalt nickel acetate hydroxide prism is the key factor and directly affects the final microtubular structure. Moreover, P is subsequently doped into the Ni/Co3O4 lattice to increase the M3+/M2+ molar ratio (M = Co and Ni), promote reaction kinetics, and optimize electronic structure. Consequently, the oxygen evolution reaction performance of P-doped tubular Ni/Co3O4 is significantly higher than that of undoped Ni/Co3O4 and the state-of-the-art RuO2 electrocatalyst.

In this work, the cathodic reaction involved in the corrosion of X80 steel in acidic soil simulated solution under various conditions were analyzed, along with data from hydrogen collection testing and the polarization curve. In the acidic soil simulated solution, the cathodic corrosion reaction of X80 steel depended on the combined effects of pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration. For pH 5.0, oxygen-consuming corrosion occurred, and the corrosion rates in oxygen-adequate and anoxic system (0.90- 0.25 ppm) depended on the oxygen ionization reaction and oxygen diffusion process, respectively. For pH 4.0 and DO > 1.90 ppm, the depolarization of oxygen was still the main cathodic reaction, but hydrogen evolution dominated the cathodic process when DO was 0.25 ppm. In addition, both the reduction reactions of O-2 and H+ were present in the solution of pH 3.0, but the hydrogen reduction contribution was the key factor.									7	1	0	0	0	0	8			1452-3981			WOS:000384909300058

Here, Co9S8 embedded in porous nitrogen-doped carbon (N-C) matrix has been designed and fabricated. The as-fabricated Co9S8/N-C hybrid shows an excellent ORR activity, which is comparable to that of the commercial Pt/C (20 wt.%). Notably, the OER activity of Co9S8/N-C hybrid is superior to that of the RuO2/C (20 wt.%), a benchmark electrocatalyst for OER. The stabilities of Co9S8/N-C hybrid toward ORR and OER are significantly improved as compared to that of Pt/C (20 wt.%) and RuO2/C (20 wt.%), respectively. The synergistic effect of the covalent coupling between Co9S8 and N-C and the porous structure of N-C is responsible for the enhanced catalytic activity and durability of Co9S8/N-C hybrid.

Surface carbon adversely influences the catalytic activity of WC and hinders direct interaction between metal adlayer modifiers and the WC substrate. In this letter, we report the beneficial effects of pretreatments of WC foil by atomic oxygen generated in an oxygen plasma source. We found that the graphitic carbon at the WC surface could be removed controllably by the atomic oxygen without causing oxidation of WC, and this improved performances for electrocatalytic methanol oxidation and hydrogen evolution.									52	5	0	0	5	0	52			2155-5435			WOS:000303492400010

In this work, a self-supported ternary Ni-Fe-Sn film on three dimensional nickel foam, which is prepared through a simple electrodeposition method, is investigated as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst. The Ni-Fe-Sn film displays a considerably low overpotential of 253 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 61.5 mV dec(-1) and excellent long-term stability for OER in 30% KOH aqueous solution. The good OER performance of Ni-Fe-Sn film may originate from its high electrochemical active surface area, rapid electron/proton and mass transfers, and the close combination between Ni-Fe-Sn film and nickel foam. This work provides a guideline to develop the low-cost and efficient earth-abundant OER anodes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, a series of two-dimensional (2D) composites MOF/Ti3C2Tx (the MXene phase) were fabricated by electrostatically directed assembly and used as catalysts for OER. The obtained composite materials exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic properties, thanks to the ultrathin 2D/2D heterostructure with abundant active sites in Co2Ni-MOF and the high electronic conductivity of Ti3C2Tx. Among all the catalysts, Co2Ni-MOF@MX-1 achieved the best oxygen evolution performance with the lowest Tafel slope (51.7mV dec-1) and the lowest overpotential (265mV on carbon paper) at the current density of 10mAcm-2. These results demonstrated that the synthesis of 2D composite materials by electrostatically directed assembly could be a feasible and promising method for the preparation of 2D heterostructure catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1095-7103		MEDLINE:36332429	36332429

However, for an accurate assessment of their performance, the determination of their electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) is of paramount importance. So far, there is no fast and reproducible methodology. This article presents an easily applicable and affordable technique to determine the ECSA of MnOx accurately. The presented methodology makes use of the specific adsorption capacitance of reaction intermediates close to the onset potential of the oxygen evolution reaction. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is utilized to measure the specific adsorption capacitances at different potentials. Using MnOx thin-film electrodes, we determine the specific adsorption capacitances and present calibration values, which can be used for an accurate determination of the ECSA of different, for instance, nanostructured materials.

Under reductive conditions (-1.2 V vs Ag/AgCl), the hydrogen evolution catalyst (H-2-NiOx) was facilely deposited on MWCNTs. The resulting film demonstrates good catalytic activity for hydrogen production in a near-neutral aqueous solution at low overpotential. When switched to oxidative conditions (+1.1 V vs Ag/AgCl), the amorphous H-2-NiOx film onto MWCNTs can be transformed into another amorphous material (O2-NiOx) to efficiently catalyze OER. The NiOx-MWCNTs catalyst was further characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results show that the content of oxygen in the O2-NiOx-MWCNTs film is higher than that in the H-2-NiOx-MWCNTs film. The NiOx-MWCNTs catalyst has good catalytic stability, and the film is reversible when the potentials are switched between the reductive conditions and oxidative conditions.

The typical particle size ranged between 15 and 40 nm. Regardless of the particle size, the nanocrystals were of isometric shape with polygonal prismatic part capped with two pyramids. The prismatic part of the nanocrystals featured {110}- and {100}-oriented faces in the case of small nanocrystals (d < 20 nm) and {110}, {100} and {140} in the case of bigger nanocrystals (d > 20 nm). The pyramidal parts were formed by {101}-oriented faces. The activity of the RuO2 nanocrystals towards oxygen evolution reaction decreases with increasing particle size; the activity towards chlorine evolution is insensitive to the particle size/shape. The observed tendency indicates that the oxygen evolution is significantly affected by the crystal edges while chlorine evolution reaction proceeds mainly on crystal faces. The suppression of the oxygen evolution may be connected with the absence of edges separating the {110}-{100} faces on the prismatic part of the bigger nanocrystals. The {110}-{100} edges can be therefore regarded as the preferential site for O-2 evolution. (C) 2006 The Electrochemical Society.									53	2	0	0	1	0	54			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000237229300065

The catalysts play the important roles in both ORR and OER. It is particularly desirable but difficult to use cheap raw materials and facile way to prepare non-noble metal bifunctional electrocatalysts with high activity and stability for both ORR and OER. Here, a simple and effective method is reported for synthesizing cobalt sulfide (Co9S8)-porous carbon spheres composite catalyst (Co9S8/CS) with thiourea, glucose and cobalt nitrate. The material structures of N, S co-doped carbon combined with Co9S8 have been evidenced by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Under the thermal treatment temperature of 800 degrees C, the prepared catalyst exhibits an analogous oxygen reduction dynamics behavior to the commercial platinum catalyst with a four-electron pathway, and a superior oxygen evolution performance with the small reversible potential gap of 0.78 V (Delta E = E-j=10 = E-1/2) to most of the bifunctional electrocatalysts reported to date, such as metal-free carbon hybrids and transition metal doped carbon materials. Due to the interaction between Co9S8 and N, S co-doping carbon, Co9S8/CS-800 exhibits exceptionally good durability and excellent activity compared with the commercial Pt/C for ORR and OER, predicting a promising application in metal-air batteries and fuel cells.

The preparation of transition metal based catalysts using the unique structure of metal-organic frameworks is considered a feasible approach. Herein, we have designed and synthesized a heterostructure electrocatalyst composed of FeS2 and MOF-derived CoNiSe2. The catalyst exhibits an extraordinary OER activity with a low overpotential of 230 mV to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm-2, a slight Tafel slope of 54 mV dec1 in 1 M KOH, and robust durability up to 45 h. The result of density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveals that electronic coupling at the heterogeneous interface helps reduce reaction energy barriers and increase electrical conductivity. This work would provide some inspiration for explorations of advanced electrocatalysts with MOF-derived heterostructure.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000729555400003

A composite electrode consisting of FeOOH and Ni foam (FeOOH/Ni-foam) was fabricated, and its catalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was evaluated and compared with nanowire NiCo2O4/Ni-foam electrode. The mass current density of OER on FeOOH/Ni-foam is around three times of that on NiCo2O4/Ni-foam. Ni foam played a key role for the high activity of the FeOOH/Ni-foam. A synergistic mechanism of FeOOH and Ni was proposed to account for the superior catalytic performance of the FeOOH/Ni-foam electrode. Considering the low cost, abundant resource and environment-benign property of FeOOH, the FeOOH/Ni-foam electrode would be a promising anode for OER.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			1432-8488			WOS:000322392600021

Typically, in order to simplify the analysis, the non-rate-determining, steps in the reaction mechanism are assumed to be in quasi-equilibrium. Here, Tafel analysis of the oxygen evolution reaction following the electrochemical oxide mechanism is performed using a full kinetic model. It is shown that this model (which uses the steady-state assumption) predicts a larger number of Tafel slopes than if the quasi-equilibrium assumption is used and provides and predicts the surface coverages which underpin these Tafel slopes. Importantly, this model predicts Tafel slopes of 30, 40, 60, and 120 my, all of which are experimentally found on IrO2 and RuO2 anodes. Models using the quasi-equilibrium assumption fail to predict some Tafel regions, as these can occur When a non-rate-determining step is not at quasi-equilibrium. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, FeOOH decorated CoP porous nanofibers were fabricated via electrospinning, oxidation/phosphorization and subsequent deposition of FeOOH. Decorating CoP with FeOOH not only optimized the adsorption ability for oxygen-containing intermediates effectively and facilitated electron transfer but also provided abundant active sites to catalyze OER, resulting in a significant enhancement in the activity. As a result, the optimized CoP/FeOOH hybrid porous nanofibers exhibited excellent OER activity with a low overpotential of 250 mV to offer 10 mA cm-2 and remarkable stability, revealing its potential as a high-performance OER electrocatalyst. The strategy presented in this work can also be used to fabricate other types of transition metal phosphide-based hybrid porous nanofibers for advanced electrochemical applications.

Herein, we demonstrated a new method to optimize the eg filling and electronic-state of Co ions in Sr2Co2O5-x (SCO) via altering concentrations of oxygen vacancies using the CaH2 as reductant in an evacuated asymptotic to 10(-2) Pa) pyrex tube. As the oxygen vacancies concentration increased, the eg electron filling of SCO was optimized and its conductivity was greatly improved. Notably, the electronic state of SCO changed from antiferromagnetic (AFM) to ferromagnetic (FM) state. Moreover, the SCO exhibited a remarkable activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with a low overpotential of 320 mV and a tafel slope of 65 mV dec(-1), which is superior to most well-known perovskite oxides catalysts. The theoretical calculations demonstrated that oxygen vacancies could reduce the energy barrier of OER process. This work not only establishes a clear relationship among oxygen vacancies, eg filling, magnetic behavior and OER performance, but also provides a new method for designing highly activity efficient catalysts for OER.

High-energy electrons generated by plasma can produce oxygen vacancy and embed phosphorus into the spinel. To balance the charge of lattice phosphorus, manganese and cobalt atoms left their original sites and deposited as MnO and CoP, thereby forming a disordered structure. Meanwhile, the oxidation state of cobalt increased. These changes provided extra active sites for electrochemical reaction and improved electrical conductivity. In addition, tunnels were formed on the surface, thus favoring mass transport in the electrolyte. Compared with pristine MCO, the spinel doped with phosphorus via plasma treatment showed higher oxygen evolution reaction performance, with a lower onset potential of 1.45 V, higher current density of 25.32 mA cm(-2)at 1.75 V, and smaller Tafel slope of 118.7 mV dec(-1). These findings can facilitate the development of high-activity electrocatalysts with dopants and defects for energy storage and conversion systems.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2199-692X			WOS:000579305800001

Here, we present a new type of hetero-N-coordinated Co (HNC-Co) single sites, with Co active centers bonding to hetero pyridinic- and amino-N ligands, as an efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst in an acidic medium. The atomically dispersed HNC-Co electrocatalyst could effectively oxidize water at a quite low overpotential of 265 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution with an ultrahigh turnover frequency of 2.8 s(-1) and a huge mass activity of 7.6 A mg(-1), similar to 80-240 times that of commercial IrO2. By using operando synchrotron infrared spectroscopy, a potential-driven active site evolution of H2N-(*O-Co)-N-4 is observed for the first time during the OER process, which greatly promotes the surface oxo-species transformation for efficient acidic OER catalysis.									51	3	0	0	5	0	53			2380-8195			WOS:000480672800004

Herein, a fast (30 s) and facile (operated at ambient conditions) flame-engraved method is used to introduce abundant oxygen vacancies and well-defined hexagonal cavities with (110) edges to nickel-iron layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDH). Abundant oxygen vacancies, lower coordination numbers, and electron-rich structures of Ni and Fe sites emerge in the flame-engraved NiFe-LDH array electrode, leading to its onset potential as low as 1.40 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) for oxygen evolution reaction. This highlights the importance and convenience of flame-engraving method in preparing metal hydroxides with abundant oxygen vacancies, which can be used as efficient electrochemical catalysts.									89	4	0	0	2	0	90			2366-9608			WOS:000438365300014

Herein, the interfacial engineering of Ru via few-layer carbon (Ru@FLC) was carried out, in which FLC can significantly suppress the corrosion of Ru in acid media, ensuring the efficient interfacial charge transport between Ru and FLC. As a result, a low overpotentials@10 mA cm(-2) of 258 mV and small Tafel slopes of 53.1 mV dec(-1) for oxygen evolution OER were achieved in acid media. DFT calculations disclose that outer FLC could induce charge redistribution and effectively optimize intermediates free energy adsorption, resulting in greatly reduce the energy barrier for OER. Our work may offer a new avenue to produce progressive OER electrocatalysts for energy-related applications in acid solution. Crown Copyright (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, the major limitation of this technology is the efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring at the anode electrode. One of the best catalysts for this reaction is nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) when doped with iron. In this work, we use Density Functional Theory (DFT)+U calculations to systematically scan various metallic dopants for NiOOH. We predict that doping with middle and late transition metals significantly lowers the overpotential. Furthermore, we demonstrate that overpotential value is correlated to the adsorption energies of some specific reaction intermediates and to the chemical nature of the active center. Among the metallic dopants that we considered, late transition metal oxides exhibit great promise for improving reaction efficiency. Our results agree with trends observed in available experiments.									21	0	0	0	3	0	21			2365-6549			WOS:000395396400007

First, the stability of the Pt3M/Pt catalyst was investigated by calculating the bulk formation energy and surface separation energy. Using the calculated adsorption energies for the OER/ORR intermediates in the modeled catalysts, we predicted the OER/ORR overpotentials and potential limiting steps for each catalyst. The origins of the enhanced catalytic reactivity in Pt3M/Pt catalysts caused by strain and ligand effects are explained separately. In addition, compared to Pt(111), the OER and ORR activities in a Pt3Ni/Pt-skin catalyst with a Pt skin layer were increased by 13.7% and 18.4%, respectively, due to the strain and ligand effects. It was confirmed that compressive strain and ligand effects are key factors in improving the catalytic performance of OER/ORR bifunctional catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1996-1073		WOS:000727073800001

Here, for the first time, the contributions of oxygen vacancy (V-O) and orbital occupancy of B -site cations to the catalytic activity of NdNiO3 films are systematically investigated. It is found that OER activity follows a typical volcano-shaped dependence on the oxygen pressure. In the range of 0.2-10 Pa, proper concentration of V-O can provide a moderate bonding strength with intermediate hydroxyl OH star and the increased ratio of Ni3+/Ni2+ provides a more favorable occupancy of e(g) orbital for the catalytic activity; while in the range of 10-60 Pa, insufficient concentration of V-O leads to an enhanced strength of hybridization between Ni 3d and O 2p band and thus deteriorated catalytic activity. The superior OER catalytic performance can be only achieved with both appropriate concentration of VO and the ratio of B-site metal cations with different valences.									40	1	0	0	2	0	41			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000478612000013

The OER activity of this oxide is comparable to or beyond those of the state-of-the-art perovskite (PV)-catalyst Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) and a precious-metal catalyst RuO2, emphasizing the importance of the characteristic BM structure with multiple coordination environments of transition metal (TM) species. Also, Ca2FeCoO5 is clearly advantageous in terms of expense/laboriousness of the material synthesis. These facts make this oxide a promising OER catalyst used in many energy conversion technologies such as metal-air secondary batteries and hydrogen production from electrochemical/photocatalytic water splitting.									46	1	0	0	1	0	46			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000406052000002	28544652

Influence of alloying additives (Sb, Sn, Ca, Ag) on the oxygen evolution reaction on Pb/PbO2 electrodes								Fourteenth Annual Battery Conference on Applications and Advances. Proceedings of the Conference (Cat. No.99TH8371)								275	9		10.1109/BCAA.1999.796004				1999	1999	When the lead-acid battery is charged over 70% SOC, oxygen is evolved on the positive plates due to water decomposition. In valve-regulated lead-acid batteries, the evolved oxygen forms a closed recombination cycle. The rate of O2 evolution depends on potential, temperature and alloying additives. In this work, the influence of alloying elements (Sb, Sn, Ca, Ag) on oxygen overvoltage is studied and their effect on the activation energy of the process is determined using smooth model electrodes. It is established that Sn increases both the oxygen overvoltage and the activation energy, Ag and Sb have the opposite effect (weaker for Sb). Ca has a small influence on O2 evolution. Besides, the additives increase the ratio alpha-/beta-PbO2 in the corrosion layer.					Fourteenth Annual Battery Conference on Applications and Advances.

J	Sood, Kritika; Rana, Supriya; Wadhwa, Ritika; Bhasin, Kuldeep Kumar; Jha, Menaka								Mechanistic Insights of Electrochemical Cl-2 and O-2 Generation from Lanthanum Cobalt Manganese Oxide								ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES				9	25					2201138	10.1002/admi.202201138		AUG 2022		SEP 2022	2022	The chlorine evolution reaction holds a core role in the chemical industries and water-treatment plants. To overcome the high power input supplied for Cl-2 generation at an industrial scale an efficient and durable electrocatalyst is always on hunt. Double perovskite oxides have been used previously for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and have shown outstanding results on the ground of dual surface active site mechanism. Here, La2CoMnO6 (LCMO) are explored for the electrochemical Cl-2 and O-2 generation. The electrocatalytic studies are performed in 5 m NaCl (pH approximate to 2.2) for chlorine evolution reaction (CER) and 1 m KOH (pH = 13.5) for OER. The LCMO shows enhanced catalytic activity with onset and overpotential of 75 and 280 mV for CER. Further, the kinetics of the catalytic reaction is determined by the Tafel slope values that is calculated to be 44 mV dec(-1) for CER. The interfacial charge transfer resistance value at 11 omega tells the insight mechanism by facilitating more interaction between electrode-electrolyte interfaces. In addition to this, wettability analysis of LCMO shows a contact angle as low as 23 degrees. The present study paves a way for double perovskites to be used as an electro-catalyst for the chlor-alkali process.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-7350			WOS:000836997100001

In this approach, the capacitive charging current was eliminated using staircase voltammetry. The cathodic current was separated into the two current components arising from the ORR and HER (namely l(oRR) and l(HER)), and resultant current components were assessed quantitatively by using the rotating disk electrode method together with the Koutecky-Levich equation. Additionally, the relative contributions of l(ORR) and l(HER) to the cathodic current and the corrosion current in air-saturated and deaerated electrolytes at a given condition were obtained. This approach will be useful in understanding the corrosion of metals in different environments. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

These highly porous nanostructures, convenient for the green chemistry processes, are generally formed by the direct carbonization of a variety of MOF, mainly MOF-5, ZIF-8, ZIF-67, UiO-66-NH2, MIL-101-NH2 at 700-1000 degrees C in argon or nitrogen flow. Differences between conventional porous carbons and MOF-derived carbons are in pore volumes, surface area, and presence of ad-atoms. The morphology of the MOF-derived nanocarbons can be adjustable with uniform dopant distribution. Resulting nanocarbons are widely applied in heterogeneous catalysis, photocatalysis and are very promising as electrocatalysts, having excellent performance in oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, and hydrogen evolution reaction. Catalytic applications for environmental purposes are also discussed. Good catalytic performance is related with highly dispersed heteroatoms, density of catalytic active sites, controllable porosity, and high surface area. Opportunities for further research are indicated, in particular, the creation of low pH-stable electrocatalysts and novel strategies for the preparation of 1 divided by 3D single-atom catalysts.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0884-2914	2044-5326		WOS:000563483700011

The homogeneous N-CoOx thinfilm is conformally deposited on high-surface-area carbon nanotubes which maintains the one-dimensional structures. The N-CoOx/carbon nanotubes electrocatalyst displays remarkable bifunctional electrocatalytic activity and stability towards the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. The onset potential for oxygen reduction reaction is 0.9 V, which is about 80 mV positively shifted compared to the undoped sample while the oxygen evolution reaction performance is also improved by reducing the overpotential of 35 mV after nitrogen doping. Moreover, the limiting current density of N-CoOx/carbon nanotubes electrocatalyst is comparable to the benchmarking Pt/C while the former one exhibits better stability which is only 5% loss of current after operation for 10000 s and for the latter one is 11%. The improved electrochemical performance is affected by the introduction of N-dopant and the results provide a direction for designing and constructing other metal oxides as bifunctional electrocatalysts for air batteries and water splitting reactions.

In this paper, a composite bifunctional catalyst comprised of Ni-Fe layered double hydroxide and multi-walled carbon nanotubes on nickel foam (LDHCN) were synthesized through a one-step hydrothermal method. The catalyst displayed excellent catalytic activity in both the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. The composition and morphology of LDHCN were determined. Electrochemical testing was performed by building a parallel two-electrode electrolyzer (LDHCNkLDHCN) that required a voltage of only 1.542V to drive 10 mA/cm2. LDHCNkLDHCN also maintained 100 mA/cm2 for at least 30 hours, indicating its excellent stability and activity. These results show that the material is viable for the highly e +/- cient conversion and transport of hydrogen energy.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1793-2920	1793-7094		WOS:000616587000005

Owing to the dominant role of the oxygen-related electrochemical process in the development of electrochemical energy, an abundance of oxygen-related electrocatalysts is discovered. Among them, perovskite-type materials with flexible crystal and electronic structures have been researched for a long time. However, most perovskite materials still show low intrinsic activity, which highlights the importance of activation strategies for perovskite-type structures to improve their intrinsic activity. In this review, the recent progress of the activation strategies for perovskite-type structures is summarized and their related applications in oxygen-related electrocatalysis reactions, including electrochemistry water splitting, metal-air batteries, and solid oxide fuel cells are discussed. Furthermore, the existing challenges and the future perspectives for the designing of ideal perovskite-type structure catalysts are proposed and discussed.									11	1	0	0	3	0	11			2366-9608			WOS:000640790700001	34927915

The Tafel slopes used to evaluate the rate determining steps generally assume extreme coverage of the adsorbed species (theta approximate to 0 or approximate to 1), although, in practice, the slopes are coverage-dependent. We conducted detailed kinetic analyses describing the coverage-dependent Tafel slopes for the aforementioned reactions. Our careful analyses provide a general benchmark for experimentally observed Tafel slopes that can be assigned to specific rate determining steps. The Tafel analysis is a powerful tool for discussing the rate determining steps involved in electrocatalysis, but our study also demonstrated that overly simplified assumptions led to an inaccurate description of the surface electrocatalysis. Additionally, in many studies, Tafel analyses have been performed in conjunction with the Butler-Volmer equation, where its applicability regarding only electron transfer kinetics is often overlooked. Based on the derived kinetic description of the HER/HOR as an example, the limitation of Butler-Volmer expression in electrocatalysis is also discussed in this report.									1397	42	1	0	62	1	1404			2045-2322			WOS:000360796400002	26348156

Compared with commercial PVC and Ru02 catalysts, remarkable enhancements in activity and durability of both oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions are achieved on our PtNPs@MOFs composite materials, with one of the lowest over-potential gaps (Eg p) of 665 mV that has ever been reported. The tests on the assembled Zn-air batteries have revealed promising electrocatalytic performance and practical advantage of our new materials as air cathode catalyst. Both experimental results and theoretical study have confirmed the synergistic effect between Pt NPs and MOF nanosheets through a "win-win" electron structural modification, demonstrating the effectiveness of our strategy in developing effective bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for various types of electrochemical devices.									51	5	0	0	5	0	53			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000467661700038

Herein, a hybrid of Co3O4/Co active species incorporated in N-doped porous carbon matrix, denoted as Co3O4/Co-NPC, has been prepared using a scalable and facile method involving the carbonization of alginate composite after a Co ion exchange with sustainable seaweed biomass. The 3D Co3O4/Co-NPC exhibits good bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic performance in alkaline medium. The proposed catalyst gives the smaller onset potential (1.450 V vs. RHE) and overpotential (277 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2) current density, indicating a superior oxygen evolution reaction activity to commercial IrO2 catalyst. It also performs the excellent oxygen reduction catalytic activity with larger onset potential (0.91 V vs. RHE), more positive half wave potential (0.806 V vs. RHE) and bigger diffusion-limiting current density (-5.86 mA cm(-2) at 0.4 V). The Co3O4/Co-NPC hybrid experiences an almost ideal 4e process with better long-term stability and anti-methanol ability than commercial Pt/C catalyst in 0.1 M KOH.

However, its wide application is limited by the excessive dependence of oxygen evolution reaction on precious metals at anode. To address this issue, herein, we report a class of IrM (M = Ni, Co, Fe) catalysts with diluted Ir content fabricated via a eutectic-directed self-templating strategy. Manipulated by the eutectic reaction and dealloying inheritance effect, the IrM catalysts show a unique network structure composed of intertwining nanoporous nanowires. The catalytic activities of IrM nanowires show a transition -metal -dependent feature, among which IrNi delivers the best activity with an exceptionally low overpotential to drive 10 mA cm' (283 mV) and a high mass activity at 1.53 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (0.732 A mg-'). Such performance represents a major leap forward compared to that of commercial Ir02 and most of state-of-the-art Ir-based acidic catalysts toward oxygen evolution reaction. First-principles calculations indicate that the 3d transition -metal-dependent catalytic activity of IrM electrocatalysts is related to ligand effect, wherein the negative shift of Ir d-band center after alloying can effectively weaken the adsorption of reaction intermediates.									36	0	0	0	0	0	36			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000493869700030	31592630

In order to increase the oxygen permeability, porous La0.6Ca0.4CoO3 and SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-delta oxygen evolution layers were attached on the dense layer. It was found that the asymmetric structured membranes with the porous oxygen evolution layers showed remarkably higher oxygen permeability as compared with a conventional sintered disk-type membrane (1200 mu m). This suggests that oxygen permeation through membranes of 10 mu m in thickness is rate-determined by both bulk O2- diffusion and oxygen evolution reaction. The maximum oxygen permeability reached 4.77 cm(3) (STP) min(-1) cm(-2) (3.54 x 10(-6) Mol cm(-2) s(-1)) at 930 degrees C for the asymmetric membrane with porous La0.6Ca0.4CoO3 oxygen evolution layer of 10 mu m in thickness (STP= Standard Temperature and Pressure). Further improvements in the oxygen permeability would be achieved through control of the micro-structure of the oxygen evolution layers. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents a case study of a new and promising strategy for in situ catalyst synthesis by the adding Mn-II to either CAN or KMnO4/CAN solution, resulting in the formation of Mn-based catalysts for OER. The catalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Both compounds contained nano-sized particles that catalyzed OER in the presence of CAN.

We give an overview of the activities within the MAXNET Energy research consortium. The main focus of research is the electrocatalytic water splitting reaction with an emphasis on the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Activities span a broad range from creation of novel catalysts by means of chemical or material synthesis, characterization and analysis applying innovative electrochemical techniques, atomistic simulations of state-of-the-art x-ray spectroscopy up to model-based systems analysis of coupled reaction and transport mechanisms. Synergy between the partners in the consortium is generated by two modes of cooperation - one in which instrumentation, techniques and expertise are shared, and one in which common standard materials and test protocols are used jointly for optimal comparability of results and to direct further development. We outline the special structure of the research consortium, give an overview of its members and their expertise and review recent scientific achievements in materials science as well as chemical and physical analysis and techniques. Due to the extreme conditions a catalyst has to endure in the OER, a central requirement for a good oxygen evolution catalyst is not only its activity, but even more so its high stability. Hence, besides detailed degradation studies, a central feature of MAXNET Energy is a standardized test setup/protocol for catalyst stability, which we propose in this contribution.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1869-876X			INSPEC:15930686

To date, earth-abundant OER catalysts have been extensively studied, while unfortunately their catalytic activity and operational stability still need to be further optimized. In this work, we fabricated a highly efficient OER catalyst based on two-dimensional (2D) NiCoFe layered double hydroxide (LDH)/MoO3 stacked heterostructure with enriched active sites and optimal electronic structure via an electrostatic-driven self-assembly process. The rough surface of the 2D heterostructure could offer abundant reactive sites for the pre-oxidation reaction, thereby leading to fast generation of the high-valence active species for OER, and the multi -metal synergy and oriented interlayered charge transfer could further enhance the intrinsic OER activity, finally resulting in enhanced OER performance with low overpotential, large current density, high intrinsic activity and excellent operational stability.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

For ORR, onset potentials of 0.79V and 0.82V vs. RHE were achieved for Co3O4@GF_ KMnO4 and Co3O4@GF_O-3, respectively. Both nanocomposites presented excellent tolerance to methanol and, in the case of Co3O4@GF_O-3, a superior long-term stability with a current retention of 96.8% after 20 000s. For OER, the overpotential was 0.44 and 0.45V for Co3O4@GF_KMnO4 and Co3O4@GF_O-3, respectively. Additionally, Co3O4@GF_O-3 presented higher current densities, Faradaic efficiencies, and long-term stability (current loss of 32% after 15 000s).The superior bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalytic activity displayed by Co3O4@GF_O-3 arises from the stronger chemical coupling between Co3O4 nanoparticles and specific oxygen surface groups of GF_O-3 flakes.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2365-6549			WOS:000445178600013

In the present work, a three dimensional (3D) Co-N co-doped hollow carbon sphere (HCS) electrocatalyst is synthesized at room temperature by the aid of a facile preparation method.The as obtained Co-N co-doped catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activity towards both ORR and OER due to its high surface area and to 3D hollow architecture. For the ORR, the catalyst shows more positive onset-potential (of similar to 0.962 V vs. RHE) and larger diffusion limiting current density (5.55 mA cm(-2)) compared with benchmark Pt/C catalyst in alkaline medium. Moreover, the as synthesized catalyst exhibits low potential (1.720 V vs. RHE) at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and small Tafel slope (81 mV dec(-1)) for OER. In addition, the catalyst exhibits remarkable methanol tolerance and good long-term stability under working conditions.

Electrochemical water splitting (EWS) is an advanced technology to produce pure hydrogen in a cost-efficient manner. The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are the vital steps of EWS and have been at the forefront of research over the past decades. The low-cost nanostructured metal phosphide (MP)-based electrocatalysts exhibit unconventional physicochemical properties and offer very high turnover frequency (TOF), low over potential, high mass activity with improved efficiency, and long-term stability. Therefore, they are deemed to be potential electrocatalysts to meet practical challenges for supporting the future hydrogen economy. This review discusses the recent research progress in nanostructured MP-based catalysts with an emphasis given on in-depth understanding of catalytic activity and innovative synthetic strategies for MP-based catalysts through combined experimental (in situ/operando techniques) and theoretical investigations.

Herein, a scalable dealloying strategy was proposed to obtain hierarchically porous spinel-type oxide with minor hereditary Al doping. Benefiting from the well-structured porosity and native dopant, O-np-Ni5Co10(Al), namely Al-NiCo2O4, exhibited excellent electrocatalytic ORR and OER activities, giving a small potential gap of 0.71 V. The rechargeable ZAB with O-np-Ni5Co10(Al) as cathode catalyst delivered a high specific capacity of 757 mAh g(-1), a competitive peak power density of 142 mW cm(-2), and a long-term discharge-charge cycling stability. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations evidenced that appropriate Al doping into NiCo2O4 could significantly reduce the Gibbs free energy difference to 1.71 eV. This work is expected to inspire the design of performance-oriented bifunctional electrocatalysts for wider applications in renewable energy systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000857949900001	36042569

Perovskite oxide nanofibers have been established as one of the most promising catalysts for water electrolysis due to their simple preparation procedure, unique one-dimensional morphology, high specific surface area, controllable nano-size effect, and adjustable compositions. In this re-view, we firstly systematical summarize the designing strategies, such as electronic structure control (heteroatom doping and lattice oxygen activation), surface/interface engineering, and defect engineering for perovskite nanofiber electrocatalysts to enhance the water electrolysis performance. Based on the OER/HER descriptors and catalytic reaction mechanisms, we further discuss in-depth the significant detail of developing perovskite nanofibers as high-performance OER/HER catalysts to achieve practical application of water electrolysis, including recent advances in bifunctional catalysts for promoting the electrocatalytic activity for OER and HER. Finally, we present new insights for establishing rational OER/HER mechanism and future directions for developing next-generation perovskite nanofiber-based bifunctional catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000860289100003

However, well-designed and highly efficient electrocatalysts are the technological dilemmas that retard their practical applications. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) derived electrocatalysts exhibit tunable structure and intriguing activity and have received intensive investigation in recent years. In this review, the recent progress of MOFs-derived carbon-based single atoms (SAs) and metal nanoparticles (NPs) catalysts for energy-related electrocatalysis is summarized. The effects of synthesis strategy, coordination environment, morphology, and composition on the catalytic activity are highlighted. Furthermore, these SAs and metal NPs catalysts for the applications of electrocatalysis (hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, and nitrogen reduction reaction) are overviewed.

Current research, however, mainly focuses on improving electrode activity of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode of electrolyzers, although the maintenance of long-term performance poses a bigger challenge. To shift the focus of research to the issue of catalyst stability, this review describes the mechanism of HER/OER catalyst degradation based on catalyst dissolution and agglomeration, and summarizes representative catalyst designs for achieving stable catalysts in long-term water electrolysis operation. Additionally, various strategies toward the improvement of HER/OER stability are evaluated, and potential effective guidelines for the design of stable catalysts are suggested.									33	0	0	0	1	0	33			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000598292000001		
J	Zong, Meng; Wang, Keke; Lin, Zongshan; Tang, Zhenghua								Phosphorylated NiCo Metal-Organic-Frameworks for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE				16	9					21094	10.20964/2021.09.22				SEP 2021	2021	The development of abundant-element-based, cost-effective, and efficient catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) holds great promises to realize the practical water splitting. Herein, we report a facile phosphorylation treatment to boost the OER performance of NiCo metal organic frameworks (MOFs). Compared with the parent hollow bowl-like sphere NiCo-MOF, the optimal NiCo-MOF/Co2P2O7 had a lower overpotential of 408 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) and 583 mV at 200 mA cm(-2). The MOF/Co2P2O7 sample also demonstrated markedly superior long term durability for OER to the benchmark RuO2 catalyst. Such excellent performance can be attributed to the well-defined porous structure imparted enhanced reaction kinetics, the formation of phosphates with high oxygen content, and the synergistic catalytic effects of between Ni and Co. The findings here offer a new way in developing high-efficiency and durable MOF-based electrocatalysts for water splitting and beyond.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1452-3981			WOS:000700284600014

Theoretical relationships for both reactions have been derived. The mathematical relationships have been confirmed by experiments on sealed rechargeable NiCd batteries. Under steady-state overcharging conditions, the Cd electrode potential was proven to be constant, thereby significantly reducing the complexity of the interpretation of the results. The oxygen evolution reaction was found to be a two-step process at the Ni electrode: two linear Tafel dependencies were found at low and high currents, separated by a transition region at intermediate currents. The oxygen recombination kinetics was found to be first-order in partial oxygen pressure, strongly suggesting that the recombination reaction is purely diffusion-controlled by oxygen, redissolved into the electrolyte, to the Cd electrode surface. For all reactions, activation energies have been determined. The results can directly be applied to aqueous battery models and give more insight into both the overcharging and self-discharge processes occurring in these Ni-based systems.

The design of ORR/OER bifunctional electrocatalysts is a challenging task in the promotion of highly efficient rechargeable metal-air batteries as well as regenerative fuel cells. Owing to the wide adaptability of different types and ratios of metals in the interlayer space as well as the adjustable interlayer distance, composite materials with layered double hydroxides (LDHs) and their derivatives have recently been registered as electrode materials and catalysts supports for various electrochemical reactions. This study examines the recent development of bifunctional electrocatalysts based on LDHs for ORR/OER to expand the application of LDHs in the field of energy storage and conversion. Various bifunctional electrocatalysts associated with LDHs are discussed in detail to improve their performance. Finally, existing problems and future prospects for improving the performance of LDHs bifunctional electrocatalysts are proposed. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

After conducting an investigation of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the as-synthesized NiFe2O4 material exhibited good catalytic efficiency and high stability and durability in alkaline media. The as-synthesized NiFe2O4 material would promote the development of MOFs in non-noble-metal OER catalyst.									15	2	0	0	2	0	15			1388-0764	1572-896X		WOS:000430110700002

CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS				55	10			1442	1445		10.1039/c8cc08817a				FEB 4 2019	2019	We explore the role of oxygen vacancies in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for double perovskite PrBaCo2O6-. Interestingly, we find that largely increasing oxygen vacancies leads to a significant reduction in the intrinsic OER activity. Structural studies reveal that oxygen vacancies tend to orderly align in PrO1-. This ordered structure not only lowers the cobalt oxidation states but also triggers a spin-state transition from high-spin to low-spin states for cobalt ions, both greatly slowing the OER kinetics.									70	1	0	0	2	0	69			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000458546700015	30644464

Herein, we reveal that the stability degradation of NiFe-LDH catalysts during alkaline OER results from a decreased number of active sites and undesirable phase segregation to form NiOOH and FeOOH, with metal dissolution underpinning both of these deactivation mechanisms. Further, we demonstrate that the introduction of cation-vacancies in the basal plane of NiFe LDH is an effective approach for achieving both high catalyst activity and stability during OER. The strengthened binding energy between the metals and oxygen in the LDH sheets, together with reduced lattice distortions, both realized by the rational introduction of cation vacancies, drastically mitigate metal dissolution from NiFe-LDH under high oxidation potentials, resulting in the improved long-term OER stability. In addition, the cation vacancies (especially M3+ vacancies) accelerate the evolution of surface gamma-(NiFe)OOH phases, thereby boosting the OER activity. The present study highlights that tailoring atomic cation-vacancies is an important strategy for the development of active and stable OER electrocatalysts.									58	1	0	0	5	0	59			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000708574200001	34523207

The electrochemical properties of the obtained electrode materials were determined as well, using both dc and ac methods. It was found that cobalt ferrite coatings show excellent electrocatalytic properties towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with overpotential measured at a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) from 287 to 295 mV and a Tafel slope of 35-45 mVdec(-1). It was shown that the increase in the apparent activity of the CoFe2O4 coatings with an organic binder results mainly from a large electrochemically active area. Incorporation of the nickel binder between the CoFe2O4 particles causes an increase in both the conductivity and the electrochemically active area. The Tafel slopes indicate that the same rate-determining step controls the OER for all obtained coatings. Furthermore, it was shown that the CoFe2O4 electrodes exhibit no significant activity decrease after 28 h of oxygen evolution.

The structural and morphological properties of the catalysts were studied using XRD, SEM, and TEM. The synthesis conditions are found to have a siginificant effect on the nature of the nanoparticles and it can be tuned to synthesize amorphous or crystalline materials. The perovskites showed exceptional performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium. LaMnO3 is found to be most active for ORR, whereas LaCoO3 for OER. The onset potential of LaMnO3 is - 0.12 V, and for other La-transition metals is nearly - 0.2 V. The Koutechy-Levich plot obtained from rotating disk electrode shows a higher number of electron transfer for LaMnO3 catalyst and the least for LaCrO3, whereas the stability results indicate the LaCoO3 to be more stable as compared to LaMnO3. Based on the experimental results and literature survey, it is suggested that the improved activity of Mn and Co based lanthanum perovskite catalyst could be due to the optimum stabilization of reaction intermediates involved in the rate-determining step (RDS) of ORR/OER.									84	2	0	0	2	1	87			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000424309900004

Carbon-based nanomaterials are promising candidates because of their low-cost, good electrical conductivity, and high surface area. Among the carbon nanomaterials, graphene and carbon nanotube are more excellent as the electrocatalysts for oxygen electrode reactions, especially heteroatoms doped graphene and carbon nanotube. Herein, we developed a bifunctional electrocatalyst composed of nitrogen, sulfur co-doped graphene oxide and multi-walled carbon nanotube (N, S-GCNT), which exhibit good performance for catalyzing oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. These properties are comparable to those of noble-based catalysts such as Pt/C and IrO2, which are attributed to the synergetical effect of doped N, S because they modified the polarity of carbon in the graphene and carbon nanotube. This work provides a simple way to prepare high performance carbon-based metal-free catalysts for the applications in energy-related reactions. (C) 2018 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.

SEM and TEM images show that silver nanoparticles 10-30 nm in size are uniformly deposited on the surface of the micro-diamond. Electrochemical properties are investigated through cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Results show that 10 wt% Ag/Dia (silver content is 10% of the diamond) exhibits better bifunctional performance than the commercial Pt/C (20 wt% Pt on carbon) electrocatalyst under the same testing conditions. Compared with pristine micro-diamond and nanodiamond, 10 wt% Ag/Dia demonstrates lower onset potential and higher current density during oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. The electron transfer number of 10 wt% Ag/Dia is approximately 3.987 at-0.08 V, which indicates that the reaction is almost dominated by an efficient 4e(-) process. The satisfactory performances of the composites provide a novel potential application for electrochemistry.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1452-3981			WOS:000419169900026

Fe3C@N-CSs shows excellent oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction catalytic activity owing to the modulated electron structure by encapsulated Fe3C core via biphasic interfaces electron interaction, which can lower the free energy of intermediate, strengthen the bonding strength and enhance conductivity. Meanwhile, the contribution of the Fe-N-x sites, N doping sites and the effect of Fe3C core for the electrocatalytic oxygen reaction is originally revealed.

Herein, by means of comprehensive first-principles computations, we systematically explored the catalytic activities of a series of single transition metal atoms anchored on two-dimensional VS2 monolayers (TM@VS2) for ORR/OER. Our results revealed that Ni@VS2 exhibits low overpotentials for both ORR (0.45 V) and OER (0.31 V), suggesting its great potential as a bifunctional catalyst, which is mainly induced by its moderate interaction with oxygenated intermediates according to the established scaling relationship and volcano plot. Interestingly, the substituted doping of nitrogen heteroatoms into the VS2 substrate can further effectively improve the ORR/OER activity of the active metal atom to achieve more eligible ORR/OER bifunctional catalysts. Our results not only propose a new class of potential bifunctional oxygen catalysts but also offer a feasible strategy for further tuning their catalytic activity.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000784318400001	35446333

Nickel nanoalloys are potential low-cost OER electrocatalysts, but their catalytic activity and stability need to be improved. The doping of nickel catalysts with anionic elements combined with partial amorphization can improve their electrocatalytic activity. In this study, we report a ternary B-, P- and O-doped amorphous nickel nanoalloy (BPO-Ni) as an effective electrocatalyst for the OER. Compared with binary boron-oxygen-doped nickel (BO-Ni) and phosphorus-oxygen-doped nickel (PO-Ni), ternary BPO-Ni has higher OER catalytic activity and better durability under alkaline conditions. Our results reveal that the high catalytic activity of the B-, P- and O-doped Ni nanoalloy is derived from the synergistic effects between the ternary heteroatoms and the Ni atoms, thereby increasing their catalytic activity. This work produces a new non-metal doped amorphous nickel nanoalloy structure, and offers a way of studying novel inexpensive and efficient OER catalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000512969200009

Herein, we have developed cobalt (Co) single atoms anchored in porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanoflake arrays, synthesized from Co-MOF precursor and followed by removal of the unwanted Co clusters. The well-dispersed Co single atoms are attached to the carbon network through N-Co bonding, where there is extra porosity and active surface area created by the removal of the Co metal clusters. Interestingly, compared with those electrocatalysts containing excess Co nanoparticles, a single Co atom alone demonstrates a lower oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential and much higher oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) saturation current, showing that the Co metal clusters are redundant in driving both OER and ORR Given the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity and mechanical flexibility, the electrocatalyst assembled on carbon cloth is employed as the air cathode in a solid-state Zn-air battery, which presents good cycling stabilities (2500 min, 125 cycles) as well as a high open circuit potential (1.411 V).									258	21	0	0	13	0	262			2155-5435			WOS:000447224100001

Here, we employed density functional theory to study Co-N-doped carbon as electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions. Specifically, we investigated the interplay among adsorption energies, the spin state of the CoN4 active center, and the applied potential. We found that adsorption energies strongly depend on both the applied potential and the spin state of the Co center. Furthermore, spin state transitions induced by the applied potential also play an important role in determining the adsorption energies. This effect originates from a different potential of zero charge and capacitance of each spin state.									20	0	0	0	2	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200041

Here, we report that a rod-like bimetallic NiFe metal-organic framework (NiFe-MOF) can directly act as a highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst synthesized by a convenient-to-operate hydrothermal method. The rod-like NiFe-MOF can derive 10 mA cm(-2) with a low overpotential of only 26 mV, and its Tafel slope is 40.82 mV dec(-1), which is superior to that of monometallic Ni-MOF or Fe-MOF, and even can be comparable to that of RuO2. To identify the origin of enhancing OER activity, we resorted to X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, high resolution transmission electron microscopy image and nitrogen adsorption-desorption techniques and various electrochemical techniques to probe it gingerly. The results indicate that its high electrochemically active area and the synergistic effect of bimetallic node could be responsible for the surprisingly high catalytic performance of the NiFe-MOF. These results suggest that this kind of bimetallic MOF (NiFe-MOF) could be a promising electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1793-2920	1793-7094		WOS:000484116400008

Both CoTPyPz and the tetraruthenated cobalt porphyrazine species, TRuCoTPyPz, form very homogenous molecular films just by dropcasting their methanol solutions onto GCE electrodes. Such films exhibited low overpotentials for O-2 evolution, e.g., 560 e 340 mV, respectively, displaying high stability, typically exceeding 15 h. The kinetic parameters obtained from the Tafel plots showed that the peripheral complexes are very important for the electrocatalytic activity. Hyperspectral Raman images taken along the electrochemical process demonstrated that the cobalt center is the primary active catalyst site, but its performance is enhanced by the ruthenium complexes, which act as electron-donating groups, in the supramolecular system.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1420-3049		WOS:000832424400001	35889469

The extreme sensitivity of surface redox states to temperatures, to gas pressures and to electrochemical reaction conditions renders them difficult to investigate by conventional surface-science techniques. Here we report the direct observation of surface redox processes by surface-sensitive, operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy using thin-film iron and cobalt perovskite oxides as model electrodes for elevated-temperature oxygen incorporation and evolution reactions. In contrast to the conventional view that the transition metal cations are the dominant redox-active centres, we find that the oxygen anions near the surface are a significant redox partner to molecular oxygen due to the strong hybridization between oxygen 2p and transition metal 3d electronic states. We propose that a narrow electronic state of significant oxygen 2p character near the Fermi level exchanges electrons with the oxygen adsorbates. This result highlights the importance of surface anion-redox chemistry in oxygen-deficient transition-metal oxides.									246	7	0	0	23	0	249			2041-1723			WOS:000351857300001	25598003

To target a system which possesses both, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) capabilities, gamma-MnO2 microparticles were combined with NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDH) to a core-shell system. NiFe-LDH can be optimized in its constituency to yield a very low onset potential (at 10 mA cm (2)) for the oxygen evolution reaction of only 569 mV vs. Hg/HgO. We investigated different coating processes (in-situ precipitation coating and sonochemical assisted coating) in order to create a bifunctional system of LDH shell@gamma-MnO2 core. It was found that the overall catalytic functionality of the bifunctional system strongly depends on the coating process, as this ultimately determines the surface nature and thus the behavior in ORR and OER reactions, respectively, of this core-shell system.

This paper reviews the activity, stability and durability for oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline medium of different types of recently reported electrocatalysts such as Ni, Co, NiCo, Fe, Se, Mo, Cu, Mn, Zn, V, Ti/Ta, and metal free based earth-abundant-electrocatalysts.

Finally, this paper summarizes the efficient strategies such as preparing porous or nanostructured materials, preparing quantum sized materials, doping metals or heteroatoms, tuning the optimal crystal structure, preparing bimetallic/multi-metallic materials, preparing materials with oxygen vacancies/defects, preparing amorphous materials, preparing metal chalcogenides, preparing metal oxy hydroxides, and integrating electrocatalysts with carbon to enhance the activity, stability, and durability for OER.									297	11	0	0	9	0	299			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000447555400005

Herein, electrocatalytically active, hybrid materials composed of Fe-Co alloy nanoparticles-embedded N-doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are synthesized from Fe/Co-polyporphyrin-CNTs via pyrolysis. The materials serve as highly effective bifunctional oxygen electrode catalysts for zinc-air batteries. In particular, the one synthesized at 700 degrees C, named CNTs@(Fe,Co)PP-700, shows a very good activity for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline solution. This material catalyzes ORR with a limiting current density of 5.11 mA cm(-2) and a half-wave potential of 0.86 V vs RHE. It also catalyzes OER with 10 mA cm(-2) at a small overpotential of 360 mV. Besides, it operates well as an air cathode in a home-made rechargeable zinc-air battery, with a small voltage gap of 0.71 V at 2 mA cm(-2), while remaining stable in hundreds of charge-discharge cycles for >83 h.

In this minireview, a general overview of recent progress in developing high-performance TMP electrocatalysts for electrochemical water splitting has been presented. Design strategies including composition engineering by element doping, hybridization, and tuning the molar ratio, structure engineering by porous structures, nanoarray structures, and amorphous structures, and surface/interface engineering by tuning surface wetting states, facet control, and novel substrate are summarized.

Hence electrocatalysts have become the subject of electrochemical characterization on a daily basis. In certain cases of interest, when measuring electrochemical reactions beyond the onset potentials, however, appropriateness of existing electroanalytical methods may be questioned and alternative approaches need to be developed. The present study highlights some shortcomings in the electrochemical investigation of gas evolving reactions. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is selected as a case example with a specific focus on the electrochemical stability of a nanoparticulate iridium catalyst. When conventional electrochemical methods, such as thin film rotating disc electrodes are employed to study the materials' stability, the intrinsic degradation is masked by oxygen bubbles, which are inherently being formed during the reaction, especially when high current densities are used. In this Letter, we present a solution to this issue, the so-called floating electrode arrangement. Its elegant usage enables fast and reliable electrochemical characterization of oxygen evolution electrocatalysts.									12	0	0	0	0	1	12			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000482545300002	31379155

The proper control of Co2+/Co3+ ratio in Co3O4 could lead to modifications on its electronic and thus catalytic properties. Herein, we designed an efficient Co3O4-based OER electrocatalyst by a plasma-engraving strategy, which not only produced higher surface area, but also generated oxygen vacancies on Co3O4 surface with more Co2+ formed. The increased surface area ensures the Co3O4 has more sites for OER, and generated oxygen vacancies on Co3O4 surface improve the electronic conductivity and create more active defects for OER. Compared to pristine Co3O4, the engraved Co3O4 exhibits a much higher current density and a lower onset potential. The specific activity of the plasma-engraved Co3O4 nanosheets (0.055mAcm(BET)(-2) at 1.6V) is 10 times higher than that of pristine Co3O4, which is contributed by the surface oxygen vacancies.									1341	90	0	0	67	0	1360			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000374564300028	26990905

However, engineering the active sites of such catalysts still faces grand challenges. This study proposes a feasible ligand modulation strategy to boost the OER catalytic activity of cobalt-iron oxyhydroxide ((Fe,Co)OOH). The 2-methylimidazole (MI) ligand coordination on (Fe,Co)OOH reduces the orbital overlap between the Fe/Co 3d and O 2p, which weakens the adsorption to oxygen-containing intermediates and thus facilitates the unfavorable O-2 desorption. As a result, the MI ligand modulated (Fe,Co)OOH achieves an excellent OER performance with low overpotentials (230/290 mV at 10/100 mA cm(-2)) and excellent durability (>155 h). This study provides a novel ligand modulation strategy for the design of OER catalysts.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000777607400001	35278337

The Fe doped NiS, combined with highly conductive disulfide phase on porous Ni foam, is believed to be responsible for the ultrahigh activity. Further more, density functional theory simulation reveals that partially oxidized sulfur sites in Fe doped NiS could dramatically lower the energy barrier for the rate determining elementary reaction, thus contributing to the active oxygen evolution.									16	4	0	0	0	0	16			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000515355400004

Cyclic voltammetry studies reveal very low oxygen reduction current density of carbon-free perovskite oxides, indicating their poor catalytic activity on oxygen reduction reactions. By mixing carbon with perovskite oxides, the oxygen reduction current density is increased by about two orders. The results are consistent with the peroxide pathway mechanism in which the perovskite oxide is highly active on either electrochemical reduction or chemical decomposition. Electrochemical properties of a three-layered gas diffusion electrode demonstrate the peroxide pathway mechanism works even the perovskite oxide and the carbon exist in separate layers. Oxygen evolution reactions are prominently dependent on the oxide species and also on an addition of carbon. The electrode based on carbon-free LaNiO3 or La0.5Sr0.5CoO3 show moderate oxygen evolution activity, and the activity is further enhanced by an addition of carbon, while LaMnO3 and La0.6Sr0.4FeO3 show poor activity even with an addition of carbon.

It is also expected that a low activation energy barrier for initiating surface reconstruction is crucial for rapid and stable electrochemical catalysis. Despite this, the surface reconstruction kinetics and their effects on catalytic reactions have been rarely investigated. Herein, using phase modulated polymorphic cobalt-based catalysts with tailorable nitrogen-metal bonds through a cationic molybdenum-substitution strategy, real-time X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) structural monitoring of the surface chemical state evolution during the catalytic reaction is performed to track the initial surface reconstruction kinetics during the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It is concluded that the molybdenum-modulated cobalt-based nanocatalyst can be tuned with favorable initial surface reconstruction and stabilized active centers to reach optimized OER catalysis, accompanied by a low onset overpotential of only 210 mV and a favorable overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) of 290 mV, outperforming the commercial, noble-metallic RuO2 catalyst. This study thus provides new conceptual insights into rationally regulating the initial surface reconstruction kinetics for high-performance electrocatalysis reactions.									26	0	0	0	2	0	26			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000726296300001

Herein, we present a series of perovskite electrocatalysts (La0.65Sr0.3)zFeO3-delta with different A-site cation deficiencies through a simple and scalable solidstate synthesis method. Their electrocatalytic activities toward ORR and OER are studied by rotating disk electrode and rotating-ring disk electrode techniques in an alkaline electrolyte. Two obvious oxygen reduction potential regions are first reported in this work for these perovskites; the electron transfer number during ORR in the first oxygen reduction potential region is similar to 2 and that in the second region is similar to 4, indicating two different ORR mechanisms in these two potential regions. Among these perovskites, (La0.65Sr0.3)1.00FeO2.95 exhibits the highest electrocatalytic activity for ORR in the first ORR potential region with an onset potential of 0.72 V, a potential of 0.6 V at -1 mA cm-2, and a Tafel slope of 60.4 mV dec-1 in 0.1 M KOH. For OER in the alkaline electrolyte, (La0.65Sr0.3)0.89FeO2.9 with the highest A-site cation deficiency is proved to be the most active catalyst among these perovskites, which is mainly caused by its highest surface oxygen vacancy content. As a result, our work could provide guidance in the further development of easily prepared, scalable, and earth-abundant perovskite metal oxides.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000823472400001

Both intermediates contain an oxygen atom bonded to a surface iron atom. In one case, the adsorbed oxygen also forms a peroxo bond with a lattice oxygen from hematite; in the second case no such bond is formed. Both configurations are energetically equivalent and are related to the overpotential-determining step in the oxygen evolution reaction. The calculated reaction path for the breaking of the peroxo bond shows a barrier of about 0.86 eV for the transformation between the two intermediates. We explain this high barrier with the drastically different electronic and magnetic structure, which we also analyze using maximally localized Wannier functions. Photo-generated electron holes are shown to localize preferentially close to the reaction center at the surface in both configurations. In the case of the oxo species, this localization favors subsequent electron transfer steps during the oxygen evolution cycle. In the case of the peroxo configuration, this fact together with the high barrier for breaking the oxygen-oxygen bond indicates a possible loss mechanism due to hole trapping.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1610-2940	0948-5023		WOS:000444948800002	30229320

Here bifunctional CoMoS4/Ni3S2 nanostructures are in situ synthesized by a self-templating strategy, and the morphology control of the CoMoS4 outlayer is simultaneously achieved through a unique evolution from CoMoO4 nanocolumns array to hollow CoMoS4 nanosheets array with porous structure. Benefited from the synergistic effect of Ni3S2 interlayer, as obtained electrode exhibits greatly enhanced oxygen evolution activity than single CoMoS4 electrode with well-preserved hydrogen evolution activity. It, together with the three-dimensional topographic structure of CoMoS4 outlayer with high active areas, offers a rather low cell voltage (1.568 V@ 10 mA cm(-2)) for overall water splitting in a two-electrode system. Accordingly, our results may open new opportunities to explore hybrid nanostructures as efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting.									56	2	0	0	0	0	56			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000459839100012

Herein, a novel hybrid nanomaterial with multicomponent active dopants was conveniently fabricated by pyrolytic conversion from a bimetallic ion-decorated heteroatom-rich (P, S and N) covalent organic polymer (COP) composite. The unique nanostructure with innumerable Co9-xNixS8 and CoNiP nanoparticles anchored on P/S/N multi-doped carbon/carbon nanotubes, through in situ electrochemical reconstruction effectively provides substantial active sites and promotes charge transfer, and hence affords outstanding activity with a low overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mAcm(-2) and excellent stability for oxygen evolution reaction based on two runs of 10-h durability test in alkaline solution, which much outperformed the fewer-component counterparts.

To assess their catalytic activity and suitability for bifunctional operation in a consistent manner, we introduce and apply a standardized successive electrochemical testing protocol. Correlations are established between bifunctional activity and structure, by which the materials are classified. The large set of tested catalyst materials in this study enabled us to unravel entire reactivity trends across material groups and to make conclusions as to their suitability for reversible operating oxygen electrode applications. Our analysis reveals both beneficial synergistic effects of MnFe and MnCo based catalysts towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as well as favorable trends of NiFe based materials towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We visualize synoptic activity trends in so-called "double overpotential" diagrams to elucidate easily the underlying activity trends. The highest bifunctional activity was found for a novel mixed spinel phase of Co and Mn and the highest OER performance was demonstrated for a mixed metal NiFe layered double hydroxide catalysts, from which practical guidance for the design of bifunctional fuel cell or metal-air battery electrodes ensues.									26	0	0	0	0	0	26			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000445176700033

However, the existing bifunctional oxygen catalysts still suffer from low catalytic efficiency due to sluggish oxygen electrode reactions toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we report on a facile synthesis of nanoporous Pt-encapsulated Ir black with Pt/Ir mass ratio of 55/45 (Pt-55@Ir-45) via a newly modified polyol process at room temperature with the aid of water. The resulting Pt-55@Ir-45 catalyst demonstrated to be highly efficient and robust for both ORR and OER, relative to a mixture of commercial Pt and Ir black with Pt/Ir mass ratio of 50/50 (Pt-50/Ir-50). Mass activity of Pt-55@Ir-45 presented an 8.7- and 1.6-fold increase toward ORR and OER, respectively, compared with the Pt-50/Ir-50 catalyst. The enhanced bifunctional performance was rationalized in terms of the maximized Pt utilization, achieved by the excellent dispersion of Pt nanoparticles, and the nanoporous Pt layer constructing a conductive network without impeding the transport of oxygen and water molecules. Our work demonstrates an effective means to encapsulate nanoporous Pt layers on Ir black for the fabrication of bifunctional oxygen catalysts.									16	1	0	0	1	0	16			2196-0216			WOS:000477961200010

In this perspective, transition metal-based SACs with monolayer phosphorous (phosphorene) as the supporting material are scrutinized for their electrocatalytic activity towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from first-principle calculations. The detailed screening study has confirmed a breaking of the scaling relationship between the ORR/OER intermediates, resulting in various activity trends across the transition metal series. Groups 9 and 10 transition metal-based SACs are identified as potential catalyst candidates with the platinum single atom offering bifunctional activity for OER and HER with diminished overpotentials. Ambient condition stability analysis of SACs confirmed a different extent of interaction towards oxygen and water compared to pristine phosphorene, suggesting room for improving the stability of phosphoreneviachemical functionalization.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2516-0230			WOS:000543283200020	36133380

The kinetics equations based on the proposed OER mechanism were derived and were used to simulate the current-potential curve. A mathematical deduction of ElS data was also carried out based on one state-variable theory.

These materials were then tested as electrodes for both reduction (hydrogen evolution) and oxidation (oxygen evolution) reactions in acid medium. The composite deposition was carried out by cyclic voltammetry, potentiostatic or galvanostatic electrolysis of suspensions of the RuO2 or IrO2 particles in two different media described as appropriate for WO3 deposition: (i) a colloidal suspension obtained from Na2WO4 and H2SO4 or (ii) a solution obtained by dissolving W powder in aqueous H2O2. All the deposited composites were found to catalyse the hydrogen evolution reaction but none was active in oxygen evolution, presumably due to an inadequate electronic conductivity of the matrix. Such a behaviour differs from that of Pt-containing tungsten oxide electrodes which have been described as suitable anodes for the oxidation of organics. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The electronegativity of the fluorine anion is the strongest so that it will be much easier to form weak metal-fluorine bonds with stronger ionicity, contributing to the dynamic migration of fluorine anions and finally enriching on the surface of both cobalt-based oxide/oxyhydroxide. Surface enrichment of fluorine anions endows more hydrophilic surface character for accelerating the key process of oxygen-related intermediate adsorption.

Herein, we report a flexible and free-standing nano porous NiMnFeMo alloy (np-NiMnFeMo) with ultrahigh catalytic activity as both anode and cathode even at high current density. The nanoporous NiMnFeMo alloy can deliver as high as 1000 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of only 290 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction and 570 mV for oxygen evolution reaction. DFT calculations indicate that the ultrahigh HER activity of the catalyst is originated from the synergetic effect of the solid solution elements, where Ni atoms act as water dissociation center in the np-NiMnFeMo and the other metals (Mn, Fe and Mo) regulate the electronic structure and provide superior adsorption properties towards hydrogen. More importantly, the electrolyzer, assembled using the np-alloys as both cathode and anode for full water splitting, shows excellent stability.									37	2	0	0	1	0	37			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000600981900003

Herein, a simple and low-cost strategy of assembling CoNi nanowire arrays with NiFe nanosheets on flexible carbon cloth (CC) support as an efficient OER catalyst is developed. This unique 'nanosheets on nanowires' structure design increases its specific surface area, enabling access to more active sites. The resulting NiFe@H-CoNi/CC catalyst exhibits excellent OER activity (280 mV overpotential at 100 mA cm(-2)) with a Tafel slope of 36 mV dec(-1) and also has outstanding durability at high current operation conditions (over 100 h at 100 mA cm(-2)). Moreover, in-situ Raman analysis suggests that the NiOOH is the realistic OER active phase. This 'nanosheet on nanowire' design gives a means for fabricating OER catalysts that are both high-performance and long-lasting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2399-1984		WOS:000864900500001

Efficient electrocatalysts can be used to decrease the overpotential of these reactions and elevate practical applications of energy-related systems. Metal?organic frameworks (MOFs), via the modification of electrodes, provide new opportunities to develop green and sustainable energy systems and conduct fundamental research on electrocatalytic applications. Benefitting from the versatility of engineering and construction strategies, compositional/structural modification, high electrical conductivity, various high-density active sites, and the capability as precursors, MOFs and the derived materials are considered as efficient electrocatalysts. Based on those merits, the electrochemical application of MOFs and their derived materials for the five mentioned reactions are briefly discussed in this mini review. Furthermore, the challenges and perspectives for engineering MOF-based electrocatalysts are also provided.									55	0	0	0	1	0	55			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000649674700001

The various characterization techniques confirmed that Fe- and Fe3C-containing Fe-N-C material (FeP-P333-700) was successfully prepared by pyrolysis of porphyrin-encapsulated PCN-333 (Fe).

Different treatments such as heat (400 C, 1 h) or electrochemical (anodizing at 0.5 V vs. SCE followed by multi-cycle polarization) are employed and their effect on the alloys properties is analyzed using x-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy. Information on the performance of the as-deposited and treated electroless Ni-P coatings as anodes for oxygen evolution reaction, in alkaline media, is taken from the steady state polarization curves and the correspondent Tafel slopes. The data shows the importance of the deposit crystalline nature and of the electrochemical treatment on the formation of beta-Ni(OH)(2) and subsequently beta-Ni(OOH), crucial for obtaining Ni-P films with good electrocatalytic properties.									18	1	0	0	0	0	19			1023-1935			WOS:000243338000004

Herein, we develop a simple phosphating process to construct cobalt phosphide@nitrogen-doped carbon (CoP@NC) using metal organic frame (MOF) as a precursor and a template. In alkaline solution, CoP@NC-350 exhibits exceptional hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction performances with over potentials of 75 mV and 268 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. For a symmetric CoP@NC-350 two-electrode water splitting setup, the potential can be low as 1.69 V to obtain 10 mA cm(-2). Therefore, low-temperature phosphating treatment can be a simple and promising method to produce electrocatalysts for water splitting. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Even though the positive effects of surface oxygen vacancy have been well proved, very controversial conclusions are also reported in perovskites. In this work, the roles of oxygen vacancies on the surface and in the bulk of La0.7Sr1.3Co2O6-delta (LSCO) are well separately investigated by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (surface sensitive) and magnetization measurement (bulk sensitive). The results suggest that massive surface oxygen vacancies have positive effects by enhancing the adsorption, while excessive oxygen vacancies in bulk is double-edged because of the interruptions of exchange interaction of cations with different valence states (Co-O-Co) and smooth transport of electrons. The sample prepared with massive surface oxygen vacancies while with less bulk oxygen vacancies yields 10 times higher specific activity at 1.6 V than commercial IrO2. This work uncovers the role of bulk oxygen vacancies in OER process and paves the way for smart oxygen vacancy engineering for higher OER efficiency. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

However, such solid solutions had not been produced previously owing to their distinct formation energies and different synthesis conditions. Solid solutions combining perovskite oxides with fluorides were produced in this study by mechanochemical synthesis. The obtained perovskite oxide-halide solid solutions had highly mixed elements and valences, uniform element distributions, and single-phase crystalline structures.

Herein, we report an intrinsically conductive pi-d conjugated two-dimensional (2D) MOF Co-3(HITP)(2) (HITP= 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene), which possesses well-defined porous networks and much larger number of active sites for oxygen evolution, i.e. Co-N-4 sites (23.44 wt. % of Co element). Co-3(HITP)(2) exhibits high electrical conducting behavior (1150 S m(-1)), outperforming holey graphene (similar to 1000 S m(-1)). DFT theoretical calculation verifies the metallic behavior of Co-3(HITP)(2) and demonstrates that the pi-d conjugation contributes to the excellent conductivity. Additionally, Co-3(HITP)(2) displays prominent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity (an overpotential of 254 mV vs. RHE at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 86.5 mV dec(-1)) in alkaline electrolyte, which is comparable or even superior to most cobalt-based materials reported thus far as well as commercial RuO2 and IrO2.

Recently, metal oxides derived from metal nitrides, sulfides, chalcogenides, and phosphides have been demonstrated to exhibit superior catalytic activity as electrocatalysts for the OER but otherwise are difficult to gain access to by conventional metal oxidation methods. In this work, we demonstrate a novelin situchemical etching process of Ni(OH)(2)nanosheets followed by a thermal ammonolysis process to fabricate iron-nickel nitride Ni3FeN supported by pure Ni metal. Ni3FeN is not stable and would be converted partially into NiFeOOH under oxygen-evolution conditions, forming a NiFeOOH/Ni3FeN/Ni heterojunction showing extraordinarily high activity for the OER in alkaline medium with a low overpotential of 200 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)and a Tafel slope of 36 mV dec(-1). We demonstrated that NiFeOOH is the major active material while Ni3FeN/Ni could help increase the charge transfer dramatically. More importantly, the presented NiFeOOH/Ni3FeN/Ni catalyst has extremely good durability.

Compared with the water-oxidation electrocatalysts that are commonly utilized in alkaline conditions, the ones operating efficiently under neutral or near neutral conditions are more environmentally friendly with less corrosion issues. This review starts with a brief introduction of OER, the importance of OER in mild-pH media, as well as the fundamentals and performance parameters of OER electrocatalysts. Then, recent progress of the rational design of electrocatalysts for OER in mild-pH conditions is discussed. The chemical structures or components, synthetic approaches, and catalytic performances of the OER catalysts will be reviewed. Some interesting insights into the catalytic mechanism are also included and discussed. It concludes with a brief outlook on the possible remaining challenges and future trends of neutral or near-neutral OER electrocatalysts.

Perovskite oxides are exploited as a research frontier on OER, however, their activity and stability are still far from desirable. Herein, we highlight a paradigm shift in the design of highly efficient perovskite-type catalysts for OER by engineering anion defect. The Cl-doped LaFeO2.85Cl0.15 perovskite demonstrates an enhanced OER activity, which is attributed to the abundant surface oxygen vacancies and low adsorption energy of H2O molecule after Cl doping. Moreover, the LaFeO2.85Cl0.15 catalyst also delivers an improved electrocatalytic durability, in contrast to the pristine LaFeO3 catalyst. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Therefore, it is critical to develop multifunctional oxygen electrodes suitable for oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and decomposition of side reaction products. Here we report the application of ultrafine ruthenium on boron carbide (Ru/B4C) with highly efficient multifunctional activities as carbon-free oxygen electrodes for Li-O-2 batteries. Li2CO3 and LiOH can be completely decomposed by Ru/B4C at 4.0 V and 4.1 V, respectively, within the stability window of the electrolyte. A Li-O-2 battery using the Ru/B4C oxygen electrode achieves low overpotentials for Li-O-2 reactions, and excellent cycling performance under the capacities of 300 and 500 mAh g(Ru/B4c)(-1). In-situ gas chromatography analysis reveals that O-2 is the major gas product during charging. Only a negligible amount of CO2 is observed in the first charging process. Therefore, Ru/B4C can be a very promising oxygen-electrode material for Li-O-2 batteries and Li-air batteries operated in ambient air.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000457512700002		
J	Chen, Liang; Shen, Zhigang; Liu, Jie; Liang, Jieying; Wang, Xiaoxu								Effects of oxygen on the structural evolution of polyacrylonitrile fibers during rapid thermal treatment								RSC ADVANCES				10	11			6356	6361		10.1039/c9ra08881d				FEB 12 2020	2020	In this study, the mechanism of stabilizing polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers in a short period of time is investigated through probing the effects of oxygen on the structural evolution of PAN under different temperature regimes. It has been found that oxygen has a significant influence on both the chemical and physical structural evolution of PAN fibers, even in a short period of stabilization time, and the influences are dissimilar at different stabilization temperatures. At lower temperatures (below 140 degrees C), there is no noticeable change in the chemical and physical structures of the PAN fibers. In the mid-temperature range (140-200 degrees C), oxygen can slightly induce the cross-linking of PAN chains and result in a higher rate of decreasing crystallinity. When the main chemical reactions are initiated at higher temperatures (200-260 degrees C), oxygen is directly involved in the oxidation reaction of the PAN chains and facilitates cyclization and dehydrogenation. These reactions initiate in the amorphous regions of PAN fibers, and extend to the crystalline regions at elevated temperatures.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9				2046-2069		WOS:000515393300026	35496029

Therefore, the electrode material must ensure (1) the preferential adsorption of the organic compound, (2) the production of adsorbed hydroxyl radicals able to react with this compound in a selective oxidation reaction (with as little as possible oxygen evolution), and (3) a long-term stability. In the present paper, the oxidative decomposition of toluene in sulfuric acid solution on PbO2 coatings deposited on Ti substrate from acidic nitrate + fluoride baths containing Pb2+ and Bi3+ is investigated by voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and UV spectrophotometry. The chemical composition and structure of the catalytic coatings is characterized with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The catalytic activity is estimated both from current density vs potential and polarization resistance vs potential plots using measurements on the same electrodes in sulfuric acid without toluene to eliminate the oxygen evolution reaction that proceeds in parallel to the oxidation of toluene. A skeletal reaction mechanism of the process is proposed to account for the steady-state and transient response of the catalytic electrodes during oxidation of toluene.					4th Chianti Electrochemistry Meeting4th Chianti Electrochemistry Meeting	JUL 16-20, 2006JUL 16-20, 2006		Siena, ITALYSiena, ITALY	7	2	0	0	1	0	9			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000251677000004

The obtained catalyst exhibited a smaller specific surface area and was more graphitic compared to a catalyst synthesized identically but using carbide-derived carbon (CDC) instead of PDC. Due to the organic nature of the used peat, the PDC contained numerous additives. In 0.1 M KOH, both the PDC and CDC-based catalysts displayed ORR activity comparable to Pt/Vulcan. Additionally, equally high OER activities of 1.59 V vs RHE at 10 mA cm(-2) were reached for both catalysts studied. Considering the remarkable bifunctional activity of the PDC-based catalyst, it can be concluded that PDC is an exceptionally promising carbon support material for ORR and OER catalysts.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000525333700005

Herein, we report the development of P-doped Co3O4 nanowire array on nickel foam (P-Co3O4/NF) from Co3O4 nanowire array through low-temperature annealing, using NaH2PO2 as the P source. As a 3D catalyst, such P-Co3O4/NF demonstrates superior performance for oxygen evolution reaction with a low overpotential (260 mV at 20 mA cm(-2)), a small Tafel slope (60 mV dec(-1)), and a satisfying durability in 1.0 M KOH. Density functional theory calculations indicate that P-Co3O4 has a reaction free-energy value that is much smaller than that of pristine Co3O4 for the potential determining step of the oxygen evolution reaction. Such P-Co3O4/NF also performs efficiently for hydrogen evolution reaction, and a two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer assembled by P-8.6-Co3O4/NF as both anode and cathode needs only 1.63 V to reach a water-splitting current of 10 mA cm(-2).									398	26	0	0	27	0	403			2155-5435			WOS:000426804100069

Fe40Ni20Co20P15C5, a novel metallic glass ribbon, was prepared by arc melting and melt spinning method. The metallic glass was evaluated as an efficient electrocatalyst in water-splitting reactions, namely hydrogen evolution reaction under acidic and alkaline conditions. In addition, oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline medium was also evaluated. In 0.5 M H2SO4, the metallic glass ribbons, after electrochemical dealloying, needed an overpotential of 128 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction, while in 1 M KOH they needed an overpotential of 236 mV for hydrogen evolution. For the oxygen evolution reaction, the overpotential was 278 mV. The electrochemical dealloying procedure significantly reduced the overpotential, and the overpotential remained constant over 20 hours of test conditions under acidic and alkaline conditions. The improved electrocatalytic activity was explained based on the metastable nature of metallic glass and the synergistic effect of metal hydroxo species and phosphates. Based on the excellent properties and free-standing nature of these metallic glass ribbons in electrolyte medium, we propose the current metallic glass for commercial, industrial electrocatalytic applications.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5				2046-2069		WOS:000619136600023	35423272

However, harsh synthesis conditions and high energy consumption limit the further application of CNTs.

The introduction of pressure not only revolutionized the morphology of the electrocatalysts, but also enhanced the activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solution. Fe0.6Co0.4-P exhibits superior OER and HER performances in 1.0 mol.L-1 KOH solution with overpotentials of 364 and 346 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2), which are 28 and 5 mV lower than unpressurized Fe0.6Co0.4.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1001-0521	1867-7185		WOS:000870119800001

RuO(2)is the state-of-art electrocatalyst used for both OER and CER. The activity and selectivity of different RuO(2)low-index facets, namely (100), (110), (111), (001) and (101), are investigated through ab-initio density functional theory (DFT) based calculations. The selectivity of different facets is explored in a mixed OER-CER region by combining Pourbaix diagrams and linear scaling relationships. The difference in limiting overpotential of OER and CER is identified as the selectivity descriptor (SDCER). The most CER- and OER-selective facets are found to be (101) (SDCER=0.39 V) and (001) (SDCER=0.14 V), respectively. The understanding of facet dependent CER selectivity in RuO(2)can be extended as a design strategy to modulate OER and CER activity and selectivity as per design requirements.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000562249400001

The unique nanopeapods structure and synergistic effect between the bimetallic phosphides and carbon nanotubes provide them excellent bifunctional electroactivity and structural stability.

Moreover, the NiCoP nanopeapods/CNTs are used as both the cathode and anode for an alkaline electrolyzer, which only requires a cell voltage of 1.558 V at 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to most of the non-precious metal catalysts for water splitting.

The algorithms, data/database, and descriptors are usually the decisive factors for ML and the descriptors play a pivotal role for electrocatalysis as they contain the essence of catalysis from the physicochemical nature. Despite the considerable research efforts regarding electrocatalyst design with ML, the lack of universal selection tactics for descriptors bridging the gap between structures and activity impedes its wider application. A timely summary of the application of ML in electrocatalyst design helps to deepen the understanding of the nature of descriptors and improve the application scope and design efficiency. This review summarizes the geometrical, electronic, and activity descriptors used as input for ML training and predicting to reveal the general rules for their application in the design of electrocatalysts. In response to the challenges of hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, CO2 reduction reaction, and nitrogen reduction reaction, the ML application in these areas is tracked for the progress and prospective changes.

New ternary mixed oxides of Fe, Ni and Mo for enhanced oxygen evolution								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				36	20			12698	12705		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.07.029				OCT 2011	2011	Ternary mixed oxides of Fe, Ni and Mo with molecular formulas Fe(x)Ni(1-x)MoO(4) (x = 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75) have been prepared by a co-precipitation method and investigated for their structural and electrocatalytic properties by XRD, AFM, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and anodic Tafel polarization. Results indicate that the apparent oxygen evolution activity of the base (NiMoO(4)) electrode significantly increases with introduction of Fe from 0.25 to 0.75 mol. The Tafel slope for the oxygen evolution reaction at low overpotentials is found to be only similar to 35 mV on Fe-substituted oxides, while it was similar to 75 mV on the base oxide. The reaction follows the first order kinetics with respect to OH(-) concentration, regardless of Fe content in the oxide. Copyright (C) 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

J	Roh, B.; Macdonald, D. D.								Effect of oxygen vacancies in anodic titanium oxide films on the kinetics of the oxygen electrode reaction								RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMISTRY				43	2			125	135		10.1134/S1023193507020012				FEB 2007	2007	The effect of oxygen vacancies in the anodic oxide film on passive titanium on the kinetics of the oxygen electrode reaction has been studied by potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Oxide films of different donor density were prepared galvanostatically at various current densities until a potential of 20.0 V-SHE was achieved. The semiconductive properties of the oxide films were characterized using EIS and Mott-Schottky analysis, and the thickness was measured using ellipsometry. The film thickness was found to be almost constant at similar to 44.7 +/- 2.0 nm, but Mott-Schottky analysis of the measured high frequency interracial capacitance showed that the donor (oxygen vacancy) density in the n-type passive film decreased sharply with increasing oxide film formation rate (current density). Passive titanium surfaces covering a wide range of donor density were used as substrates for ascertaining relationships between the rates of oxygen reduction/evolution and the donor density. These studies show that the rates of both reactions are higher for passive films having higher donor densities. Possible explanations include enhancement of the conductivity of the film due to the vacancies facilitating charge transfer and the surface oxygen vacancies acting as catalytic sites for the reactions. The possible involvement of surface oxygen vacancies in the oxygen electrode reaction was explored by determining the kinetic order of the OER with respect to the donor concentration. The kinetic orders were found to be greater than zero, indicating that oxygen vacancies are involved as electrocatalytic reaction centers in both the oxygen evolution and reduction reactions.									47	1	0	0	3	0	47			1023-1935	1608-3342		WOS:000244848300001

Here, we have explored the independent effect of mixed valence and oxygen defects on the catalytic origin by artificially engineering the stoichiometry of Li2RuO3. On the basis of theoperandoX-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) results, we demonstrated that the mixed valence enhanced the redox reversibility of ruthenium ions and the oxygen defects provided more electrocatalytic active sites. Consequently, non-stoichiometric Li(2-x)RuO(3-y)exhibited superior performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and Zn-air batteries in alkaline media compared to state-of-the-art Pt/C and RuO2. Moreover, the applicability of the nonstoichiometric effect in various electrocatalytic reactions was systematically verified. Therefore, artificially induced non-stoichiometry is a feasible strategy to design efficient multifunctional electrocatalysts and this strategy can be applied to general metal oxide electrocatalysts for various electrocatalytic reactions.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000549074800016

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) represent the most significant processes in zinc-oxygen batteries. The development of nonprecious metal catalysts for OER with satisfactory performances and low cost (especially prepared by a straightforward synthesis route), still poses a significant challenge. Herein, we report an exceptionally facile and easily scalable method to produce NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) coated nickel foam by immersing nickel foams into aqueous solutions containing NiCl2 and FeCl2 and keeping them standing for a certain period of time. Without any other complicated technique or organic reagent, microflower-shaped NiFe LDHs can be obtained. The resulting electrode shows excellent OER performance with a low overpotential of 210 mV at a 10 mAcm(-2) constant current polarization and stable operation for more than 100 charge-discharge cycles in zincoxygen batteries.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2196-0216			WOS:000410500100011

However, lithium oxygen batteries exhibit poor cycle stability, relatively low power capability and significantly large polarizations for both, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR, discharge) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER, charge). To address these issues, various catalysts for aqueous and non- aqueous lithium oxygen batteries have thus been introduced, and some recent developments of bifunctional catalysts could simultaneously facilitate the ORR and OER, leading to great advance- ments in the overall battery performance. Herein, we present a brief overview of recent progress in the development of bifunctional catalysts for lithium oxygen batteries based on the current understanding of their working mechanism. Perovskitetype, spinel- type, and non- oxide catalysts and their use in aqueous lithium oxygen batteries are reviewed. Recently reported bifunctional catalysts in non- aqueous lithium oxygen batteries are also introduced, and the different roles of solidand soluble- type catalysts are further discussed. Finally, we conclude by deliberating the design prospects and perspectives for efficient bifunctional catalysts for future lithium oxygen batteries.									18	3	0	0	0	0	18				2566-6223		WOS:000477087800004

Herein, Ni was electrodeposited from two separate solvents, the aqueous acetate buffer and ethaline solvent as a kind of deep eutectic solvents (DESs), and both the deposited films were investigated as electrocatalysts for HER and OER. The electrodeposition parameters such as pH and deposition potential were studied. The electrodeposition process was performed using chronoamperometry technique and Ni deposits were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fabricated Ni@PGE deposit from ethaline only requires an overpotential of - 154 mV and 350 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER, respectively. While, Ni@PGE from acetate requires an overpotential of - 164 mV and 400 mV to produce the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000799436500001

It requires a very low over potential of 230 mV to achieve an anodic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 44 mV dec(-1). Ni0.2Co0.8P is also shown to perform well in catalyzing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under both alkaline (0.1 M KOH solution) and acidic conditions (0.5 M H2SO4 solution). Through first-principles theoretical analysis, we show that such high catalytic activity arises from the synergistic effect of Ni and Co on energies of d and p bands of Ni0.2Co0.8P, which is further enhanced by rapid mass transport possible due to the porous architecture of its three-dimensional network morphology.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0025-5408	1873-4227		WOS:000652836900024

Herein, we adopt a simple impregnation and hydrogen reduction strategy to prepare an ultrafine iridium oxide supported on the multiwalled carbon nanotubes. The 2.0% IrO2@CNT catalyst shows good chemical water oxidation activity with turnover frequency of 3.48 s(-1) and superior electrochemical oxygen evolution activity at 10 mA cm(-2), with only 217 mV and 272 mV of overpotential in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. Besides, 2.0% IrO2@CNT exhibits good stability for OER in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes. In addition, 2.0% IrO2@CNT manifests excellent ORR performance, including a positive onset potential (similar to 0.91 V vs RHE), a high limiting current density (-4.6 mA cm(-2)), good stability, and strong tolerance to methanol crossover. The enhanced catalytic activity arises from the synergetic action between IrO2 and multiwalled carbon nanotubes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Lattice-oxygen-mediated mechanism (LOM) has been developed to boost OER kinetic via triggering lattice oxygen redox. However, the promoted intrinsic activity is compromised by low stability due to bulk structure reconstruction during OER. Here, we demonstrate that a single-site Ir-doping strategy can effectively address this challenge. Attributing to the carefully defined chelation environment of Ir, increased Ir-O covalency and engaged lattice oxygen oxidation have been observed. More importantly, locally triggered LOM introduces no structure evolution during OER. As a result, the constructed catalyst (Ir-MnO2) exhibited over 42 timesmoremass activity than that of commercial IrO2 as well as over 650 h stability with only a 15mV increase in overpotential. Our work opens up a feasible strategy to boost OER activity and stability simultaneously.									39	2	0	0	2	0	39			2542-4351			WOS:000686543600019

Herein, CuCo2S4 nanowire arrays were synthesized on a nickel foam substrate by a two-step hydrothermal approach and utilized as highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. The CuCo2S4 nanowire arrays were identified as an exceptionally active catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in a basic solution with an extremely low overpotential of 65 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). The hierarchically structured CuCo2S4 electrode was also highly active toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), achieving a high current density of 100 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of only 310 mV. Consequently, an alkaline electrolyzer constructed using CuCo2S4 nanowire arrays as both anode and cathode can realize overall water splitting with a current density of 100 mA/cm(2) at a cell voltage of 1.65 V, suggesting a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for efficient overall water splitting.									76	3	0	0	4	0	76			2168-0485			WOS:000443924100085

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a decisive step in water splitting. Slow kinetics seriously limits the effective utilization of energy thus it is extremely urgent to develop electrocatalysts that can effectively reduce the reaction energy barrier thus accelerate OER kinetics. Here, Mn-Co0.85Se/NiSe2/NF nanosheets with 3D folded structure was assembled on Ni foam by electrodeposition and vapor-deposition method. Mn-Co0.85Se/NiSe2/NF can achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with only 175 mV overpotential in an alkaline environment of 1 M KOH, which is much lower than other reported catalysts. In addition, catalyst Mn-Co0.85Se/NiSe2/NF also performed well in long-term stability tests. Through the synergy of polymetallic, the improvement of catalyst surface energy together with the tuning of electronic structure and the optimization of conductivity can be realized.

The electrocatalytic studies reveal that the Ag-based composite is an excellent catalyst for both oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) in alkaline solution. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis through distribution function of relaxation times (DFRT) suggests that the improved activity originates from the suppression of resistance contributed by various relaxation processes.

A series of mixed Ni-MOFs and Fe-MOFs are synthesized by straightforward sonication and then directly used as catalyst candidates for OER in alkaline electrolyte. It can be confirmed via ex situ transmission electron microscopic images and X-ray diffraction patterns analysis, that the bimetallic hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) is generated in 1.0 m KOH in situ and acts as protagonist for oxygen evolution. The optimized catalyst (FN-2) exhibits a lower overpotential (275 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)) and excellent long-term stability (strong current density for 100 h without fading).

The ratio of Fe and Co in the alloy can be controlled by adjusting the carbonization temperature. The electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) could be enhanced by the subtle Fe-Co modification significantly. Among these electrocatalysts, the Fe-Co/NC-800 presents the best HER and OER activity as well as reaction kinetics. The overpotentials at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) of Fe-Co/NC-800 are 182 and 279 mV (vs. RHE) for HER and OER, respectively. The Tafel slopes of Fe-Co/NC-800 are 157.8 and 42.7 mV dec(-1) for HER and OER, respectively.

J	Zhang, Wenxiu; Cui, Liang; Liu, Jingquan								Recent advances in cobalt-based electrocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions								JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS				821						153542	10.1016/j.jallcom.2019.153542				APR 25 2020	2020	Electrochemical water splitting has proven to be the most promising way to generate hydrogen. However, the high cost and low efficiency of the catalysts for cathode and anode in water splitting device remain the most knotty obstacle that needs to be stepped over. The optimal electrocatalysts can lower the energy costs required for water splitting via the reduced overpotential. Therefore, developing efficient and nonprecious electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is highly critical and challenging. Cobalt (Co)-based electrocatalysts have been widely applied as electrocatalysts for HER and OER in water splitting. In this review, the mechanisms of HER and OER, was first illustrated, the preparation and electrochemical performance of various Co-based electrocatalysts, including cobalt oxides, hydroxides, sulfides, phosphides, nitrides and selenides for HER or OER are then summarized. Finally, the potential challenges and the future perspective of Co-based electrocatalysts are proposed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

NiCo2O4-x/NLG exhibits an excellent catalytic activity with a low overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mA center dot cm(-2) for OER and a high half-wave potential of 0.85 V for ORR. As a result, the overall ORR/OER overpotential of NiCo2O4-x/NLG is only 0.67 V in 1.0 mol/L KOH electrolyte, which is superior to commercial noble-metal-based catalysts (Pt/C+RuO2). It is evidenced that the enhanced intrinsic OER and ORR activities of NiCo2O4-x/NLG are attributed to a synergistic effect between the pyridinic-N-Co coordination and the oxygen vacancies. This work provides a new design strategy for enhancing the intrinsic activity of bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			1001-604X	1614-7065		WOS:000614901700001

Herein, we report the synthesis of free-standing 2D Ru nanosheets using a facile solvothermal method, in which Ru(III) is reduced via self-decomposition of the metal precursor and grows into ultrathin nanosheets with the aid of isopropanol and urea. The 2D Ru nanosheets and their 2D oxide derivative exhibit excellent hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction activities, respectively.

The effect of WC concentration in the composite anode material was emphasized. The surface microstructure was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the electrocatalysis of oxygen evolution behavior was investigated using anodic polarization curves, cyclic voltammetry curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) measurements in a synthetic zinc electrowinning electrolyte of 50 g.L-1 Zn2+ and 150 g.L-1 H2SO4 at 40 degrees C. The results show that the addition of WC can clearly decrease the grain size of PbO2 electrodes, and the electrodes become more compact. The addition of WC can increase the exchange current density j(0) of a composite electrode during the process of oxygen evolution, reduce the apparent activation energy E-a of the oxygen evolution reaction, increase the values of electric double layer capacitance C-dl during the charging process, increase the electric double layer capacitance Q(dl) of oxygen evolution reaction process, and reduce the values of charge transfer resistance R-ct; and also can improve the electrocatalytic stability. The doping of WC in the Ti/beta-PbO2 composite electrode can effectively improve the electrode coating microstructure, increase the electrocatalytic activity of the oxygen evolution reaction in the electrolytic zinc liquid and exert positive effects on the application of the composite electrode.

Here, Au@RhCu nanodendrites with core-shell nanostructure were facile generated via seed-mediated method. Through composition optimization, the Au@Rh3Cu nanodendrites show excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity with an overpotential of 83 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), together with a small Tafel slope of 33.4 mV dec(-1). Meanwhile, the Au@Rh3Cu nanocrystals are also a good oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst with an overpotential of 415 mV (at 10 mA cm(-2)) and a Tafel slope of 127 mV dec(-1). Additionally, the Au@Rh3Cu exhibits excellent stability for both HER and OER. Such attractive catalytic performance can be assigned to the large surface area produced by the unique core-shell dendritic nanostructure, the synergistic effect between different metal elements and the positive influence of Au seeds. This work would offer a reliable pathway for the design of multimetallic core-shell dendritic nanostructures as promising electrocatalysts toward water splitting.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2365-6549			WOS:000753977300042

Herein, a self-sacrifice template engineering strategy that feasible carbonization of the copolymer of melaminetrithiocyanurim wrapped by polydopamine was developed to fabricate N, S hollow co-doped carbon tube (NSCHCT) based trifunctional electrocatalyst. Owing to the hierarchical structure, including hollow and porous structure, the obtained catalyst exhibits rich active sites and favourable mass transfer advantage, boosting the kinetic of the catalytic process. Moreover, multiple heteroatoms-doping provides various active sites. Notably, the thiophene sulfur combining with pyridinic N(p-N/S) and thiophene sulfur combined with graphitic N (g-N/S) shows the lowest activation energy barrier for OER/ORR and HER, respectively. As a result, the NSCHCT assembled Zinc-air battery shows excellent performance with a power density of 109 mW cm-2 and a high opencircuit voltage of 1.44 V, comparable with the Pt/C + RuO2 system.									21	0	0	0	2	0	21			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000655688200002

In this work, highly crumpled hybrid of nitrogen and sulfur dual-doped graphene and quasi-hexagonal Co9S8 nanoplates (Co9S8/NSG(g-C3N4)) is fabricated via a facile ionic assembly approach. The unique structure of Co9S8/NSG(g-C3N4) renders it high specific surface area (288.3 m(2) g(-1)) and large pore volume (1.32 cm(3) g(-1)). As the electrocatalyst for ORR, Co9S8/NSG(g-C3N4) demonstrates excellent performance with the onset potential of -0.02 V vs Ag/AgCl and the limited current density of 6.05 mA cm(-2) at -0.9 V vs Ag/AgCl. Co9S8/NSG(g-C3N4) also presents outstanding catalytic activity toward OER by delivering a limited current density of 48 mA cm(-2) at 1 V vs Ag/AgCl. The bifunctional catalytic behaviors of Co9S8/NSG(g-C3N4) enable the assembly of a rechargeable Znair battery with it as the cathode catalyst, which exhibits stable discharge/charge voltage plateaus upon long time cycling over 50 h.									88	3	0	0	3	0	89			1944-8244			WOS:000399354100021	28368601

In nature, solar energy is converted to chemical energy via water oxidation at the oxygen-evolving center of photosystem II to generate dioxygen, protons, and electrons. In artificial energy schemes, water oxidation is one of the half reactions of water splitting, which is an appealing strategy for energy conversion via photocatalytic, electrocatalytic, or photoelectrocatalytic processes. Because it is thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically slow, water oxidation is the bottleneck for achieving large-scale water splitting. Thus, developing highly efficient water oxidation catalysts has attracted the interests of researchers in the past decades. The formation of O-O bonds is typically the rate-determining step of the water oxidation catalytic cycle. Therefore, better understanding this key step is critical for the rational design of more efficient catalysts. This review focuses on elucidating the evolution of metal-oxygen species during transition metal-catalyzed water oxidation, and more importantly, on discussing the feasible O-O bond formation mechanisms during the oxygen evolution reaction over synthetic molecular catalysts.

The synthesis exploits the fact that the kinetically inert Co(III) complex of ethylenediamine (en) is 35 orders of magnitude more stable than the kinetically labile Co(II) complex. [Co(en)(3)](3+) is therefore stable in alkaline solution, but [Co(en)3](2+) reacts with excess hydroxide ion to produce beta-Co(OH)(2). The electrodeposited beta-Co(OH)(2) is an active catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction. Raman spectroscopy suggests that the surface of beta-Co(OH)(2) is converted to CoOOH at the potentials at which oxygen evolution occurs.									131	2	0	0	11	0	130			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000319184600061

The efficiency of such a process would be greatly facilitated by incorporating more active catalysts based on abundant materials for the oxygen evolution reaction. Manganese oxides are proMising as catalysts for this reaction. Recent reports show that their activity can be drastically enhanced when modified with gold. Herein, we investigate highly active mixed Au-MnOx thin films for the oxygen evolution reaction, which exhibit more than five times improvement over pure MnOx. These films are characterized with operando X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy, which reveal that Mn assumes a higher oxidation state under reaction conditions when Au is present. The magnitude of the enhancement is correlated to the size of the Au domains, where larger domains are the more beneficial. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

All this promise has not yet reached fruition because of a plethora of practical barriers and challenges. These include solvent and electrode stability, pronounced overvoltage for oxygen evolution reactions, limited cycle life and rate capability. One of the approaches suggested to facilitate the oxygen evolution reactions and improve rate capability is the use of redox mediators such as iodine for the fast oxidation of lithium peroxide. In this paper we have examined LiI as an electrolyte and additive in Li oxygen cells with ethereal electrolyte solutions. At high concentrations of LiI, the presence of the salt promotes a side reaction that forms LiOH as a major product. In turn, the presence of oxygen facilitates the reduction of I-3(-) to 3I(-) in these systems. At very low concentrations of LiI, oxygen is reduced to Li2O2. The iodine formed in the anodic reaction serves as a redox mediator for Li2O2 oxidation.									153	5	0	0	7	0	160			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000352489200055

However, current electrocatalysts are not adequate (high overpotential, lack of selectivity toward O-2 production, catalyst degradation). We propose here mechanistic guidelines for experimental examination of modified catalysts based on the dependence of kinetic rates on the solvent dielectric constant. To illustrate the procedure we consider the fcc(111) platinum surface and show that the individual steps for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) change systematically with the polarizability of the medium. Thus changing this environmental variable can be used to tune the rate determining steps and the barriers, providing a means for screening and validating new systems to optimize the rate determining steps for the ORR and OER reaction pathways.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000350669900028	25682836

Herein, a series of spinel-structured nanosheets with oxygen deficiencies and ultrathin thicknesses were designed to increase the reactivity and the number of active sites of the catalysts, which were then taken as an excellent platform for promoting the water oxidation process. Theoretical investigations showed that the oxygen vacancies confined in the ultrathin nanosheet could lower the adsorption energy of H2O, leading to increased OER efficiency. As expected, the NiCo2O4 ultrathin nanosheets rich in oxygen vacancies exhibited a large current density of 285 mAcm(-2) at 0.8V and a small overpotential of 0.32 V, both of which are superior to the corresponding values of bulk samples or samples with few oxygen deficiencies and even higher than those of most reported non-precious-metal catalysts. This work should provide a new pathway for the design of advanced OER catalysts.									959	45	0	0	65	1	970			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000356390300034	25951435

Larger and crystalline alpha-Ni@ rGO-K nanoparticles (4.7 +/- 1.8 nm) generated materials with higher activity than the respective alpha-Ni(OH)(2)-Na derivatives (1.8 +/- 0.3 nm), where the incorporation of rGO improved dramatically the performance. However, an even larger efficiency was achieved when alpha-Ni@ rGO-K was covered up with a controlled amount of FeOCPc, a poor molecular OER catalyst, in this way demonstrating a synergic effect of that macrocycle on the reaction kinetics decreasing further the overpotential of the oxygen evolution reaction. In fact, alpha-NiFeOCPc@rGO-K was the ternary composite material with best performance, being able to sustain a stable current of 10 mA cm(-2) during 8 h of continuous electrolysis at 1.64 V vs RHE, in 1.0 mol dm(-3) KOH solution, showing good perspectives as electrode material for OER.

The corresponding recent development of in situ and operando tools has posed new challenges on experimental architectures. In this study, we use ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS) to probe the solid/liquid electrified interface of a polycrystalline Pt sample in contact with an alkaline electrolyte during hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. Using the "dip-and-pull" technique to probe the interface through a thin liquid layer generated on the sample surface, we observe that the electrolyte meniscus becomes unstable under sustained driving of an electrolyte-consuming reaction (such as water oxidation). The addition of an electrochemically inert supporting electrolyte mitigates this issue, maintaining a stable meniscus layer for prolonged reaction times. In contrast, for processes in which the electrolyte is replenished in the reaction pathway (i.e. water reduction in alkaline conditions), we find that the solid/liquid interface remains stable without addition of a secondary supporting electrolyte. The approach described in this work allows the extension of operando AP-XPS capabilities using the "dip-and-pull" method to a broader class of reactions consuming ionic species during complex interfacial faradaic processes.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			1022-5528	1572-9028		WOS:000451652600012

Here, the activities of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in zinc and nitrogen codoped graphene with different zinc-nitrogen (Zn-N) coordination numbers and configurations are studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The calculation results show that both Zn-N coordination numbers and structure configurations affect the activities of ORR and OER on ZnN(x)sites. Among all the calculated structures, ZnN4-pyridine shows the lowest ORR overpotential of 0.61 V, whereas ZnN4-pyrrole and ZnN4-edge show lower OER overpotentials of 0.73 and 0.63 V, respectively. However, the other low N coordination structures of ZnNx-pyridine/pyrrole/edge (x= 1/0/1-3) demonstrate poor activities. The electronic structure reveals that the O-p orbital shows moderate hybridization strength with the N-p and Zn-d orbitals in O adsorbed ZnN(4)systems thus facilitates the electrocatalytic reactions.

Herein, by means of density functional theory calculations, novel BACs with a bilayer structure composed of monolayers FeN4(Fe and nitrogen co-doped graphene) and MN4(Fe/M, M represents transition metal atoms) as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are investigated. Among these bilayer SACs, a series of highly efficient monofunctional, bifunctional, and even trifunctional electrocatalysts have been screened. For example, the overpotentials for the HER, ORR, and OER can reach -0.02 (Fe/Cu), 0.31 (Fe/Hg), and 0.27 V (Fe/Hf), respectively; Fe/Hf and Ir/Fe can serve as promising bifunctional catalysts for the ORR/OER and HER/OER, respectively and Fe/Rh is considered as an excellent trifunctional catalyst for the HER, OER, and ORR.

Herein, a kinetically controlled hydrolysis strategy is proposed for the scalable synthesis of gamma-FeOOH nanosheets arrays (NAs) with enhanced structural stability on diverse substrates at ambient conditions. The underlying mechanisms for the growth of gamma-FeOOH NAs associated with their structural evolution are systematically elucidated by alkalinity-controlled synthesis and time-dependent experiments. As a proof-of-concept application, gamma-FeOOH NAs are developed as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), where the sample grown on nickel foam (NF) exhibits superior performance of high catalytic current density, small Tafel slope, and exceptional durability, which is among the top level of FeOOH-based electrocatalysts. Density functional theory calculations suggest that gamma-NiOOH in situ generated from the electrooxidation of NF would induce charge accumulation on the Fe sites of gamma-FeOOH NAs, leading to enhanced OER intermediates adsorption for water splitting. This work affords a new technique to rationally design and synthesize gamma-FeOOH NAs for various applications.									42	2	0	0	2	0	43			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000616750900001	33569838

Herein, on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we systematically investigated 30 TMNxO4-x-HTP (TM = Fe, Co, Ni, Ru, Rh and Pd; x = 0-4; HTP refers to hexatriphenylene) analogs of conductive two-dimensional (2D) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as potential catalysts for HER, OER, and ORR. The results show the good stabilities and metallic features of TMNxO4-x-HTP. The interaction strength between intermediates and catalysts governs the catalytic activities, which can be modulated by tuning the TM atom and the local coordination number of N/O in catalysts.

The NiCo/NiCoOx composites consisted of NiCo alloy core and nickel cobalt oxide shell with the thickness of around 5 nm exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER) in 1 M KOH due to the enhanced conductivity and the large defect-rich interface. However, the electrocatalytic activity for oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) is boosted by ultrathin, amorphous and interconnected FeOOH nanosheets grown on the hierarchical NiCo/NiCoOx composites because of the promoted conductivity and electron transfer ability of the metallic NiCo core and the suitable interaction of NiCoOx and FeOOH with OH groups. In oxygen evolution process, a low overpotential of 278 mV is required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for NiCo/NiCoOx@FeOOH samples, and the Tafel slope is only 47.5 mV dec(-1). When integrated NiCo/NiCoOx with NiCo/NiCoOx@ FeOOH in an alkaline electrolyzer, a full water splitting current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and high electrochemical stability can be obtained at 1.65 V.

In this work, Co@NC core-shell nanoparticles were synthesized via a simple, eco-friendly, solid-state synthesis process, using cobalt nitrate and with pyrazole as the N and C source. The morphological analysis of the resulting Co@NC nanoparticles was performed with a scanning and transmission electron microscope, which showed Co nanoparticles as the core and the pyrolysis of pyrazole organic ligand N-doped carbon derived shell structure. The unique Co@NC nanostructures had excellent redox sites for electrocatalysis, wherein the N-doped carbon shell exhibited superior electronic conductivity in the Co@NC catalyst. The resulting Co@NC nanocatalyst showed considerable HER and OER activity in an alkaline medium. The Co@NC catalyst exhibited HERs overpotentials of 243 and 170 mV at 10 mA center dot cm(-2) on glassy carbon and Ni foam electrodes, respectively, whereas OERs were exhibited overpotentials of 450 and 452 mV at a current density of 10 and 50 mA center dot cm(-2) on glassy carbon electrode and Ni foam, respectively. Moreover, the Co@NC catalyst also showed admirable durability for OERs in an alkaline medium.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8				1996-1073		WOS:000628165100001

This perovskite-oxide catalyst, CaSrFe0.75Co0.75Mn0.5O6-delta (CSFCM), is examined using both experimental and computational methods. It demonstrates a combination of properties, which include (a) very high activity for the oxygen-evolution reaction with an overpotential of eta = 0.19 V at 10 mA/cm(2), (b) high stability over 1000 cycles of catalysis, (c) the ability to catalyze the hydrogen-evolution reaction effectively in both acidic and basic conditions, and (d) catalytic activity as a single-phase bulk material without the need for any additional processing, multicomponent composite preparation, or nanofabrication. Therefore, the catalytic activity of CSFCM is intrinsic, making it a good benchmark compound for future studies of electrocatalytic parameters. This work also highlights the impact of systematic structural design on electrocatalytic activity. Results from density functional theory calculations indicate that in addition to an optimal e(g) occupancy of similar to 1, an additional descriptor, i.e., maximizing the number of free e(g) carriers, correlates with the electrocatalytic activity.									10	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000753063400030

Ni-rich Fe-Ni NPs crystallize in a face-centered cubic (fcc) structure, whereas Fe-rich Fe-Ni NPs stabilize in body-centered cubic (bcc) structure. Fe-Ni NPs operate as bifunctional electrode materials at room temperature in alkaline medium and show enhanced electrocatalytic activity in the electrolysis of water to H-2 evolution and O-2 evolution reactions (HER and OER) at low onset potential versus Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. A low Tafel slope was also detected for Fe2Ni NPs (ca. 470 mV/dec) in the water oxidation reaction. Bifunctional electrocatalysts are significant in renewable and clean energy processes like hydrogen- oxygen fuel cells, metal-oxygen batteries, and so forth.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			2196-0216			WOS:000404604300035

Precious metal-free elements, i.e., nitrogen (N), nickel (Ni), and iron (Fe), were merged together through either doping or alloying to form a mesoporous structure supporting NiFe-alloy electrocatalyst (m-NiFe/CNx). The synergetic effects from multiple active sites, in combination with structural merits, endowed the mNiFe/CNx electrocatalyst with an excellent electrocatalytic activity for both OER and ORR, including high activity, fast kinetics, modest overpotential, and excellent stability. The m-NiFe/CNx also featured a simple and scalable synthesis process with a low cost, which makes it an attractive alternative catalyst to precious metal-based electrocatalysts for OER and ORR.									75	7	0	0	1	0	78			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000352441100039

High-performance, nonprecious metal-based hybrid catalysts are developed from postsynthesis integration of dual-phase spinel MnCo2O4 (dp-MnCo2O4) nanocrystals with nanocarbon materials, e.g., carbon nanotube (CNT) and nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO). The synergic covalent coupling between dp-MnCo2O4 and nanocarbons effectively enhances both the bifunctional ORR and OER activities of the spinel/nanocarbon hybrid catalysts. The dp-MnCo2O4/N-rGO hybrid catalysts exhibited comparable ORR activity and superior OER activity compared to commercial 30 wt % platinum supported on carbon black (Pt/C). An electrically rechargeable zinc-air battery using dp-MnCo2O4/CNT hybrid catalysts on the cathode was successfully operated for 64 discharge-charge cycles (or 768 h equivalent), significantly outperforming the Pt/C counterpart, which could only survive up to 108 h under similar conditions.									275	12	0	0	7	0	276			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000340446300103	25058393

The ordered nanoporous structure formed by anodization played a key role in enhancing the electrocatalytic performance of the Ag-embedded SnO2 layer in several ways: (1) the roughness factor of the thin film is greatly increased from 23 in the compact layer to 145 in the nanoporous layer, creating additional active sites that are involved in oxygen electrochemical reactions; (2) a trace amount of Ag (similar to 1.7 at %, corresponding to a Ag loading of similar to 3.8 mu g cm(-2)) embedded in the self-organized SnO2 nanoporous matrix avoids the agglomeration of nanoparticles, which is a common problem leading to the electrocatalyst deactivation; (3) the fabricated nanoporous thin film is active without additional additives or porous carbon that is usually necessary to support and stabilize the electrocatalyst. More importantly, the Ag-embedded SnO2 nanoporous thin film shows outstanding bifunctional oxygen electrochemical performance (oxygen reduction and evolution reactions) that is considered a promising candidate for use in metal-air batteries. The present technique has a wide range of applications for the preparation of other carbon-free electrocatalytic nanoporous films that could be useful for renewable energy production and storage applications.									29	2	0	0	0	0	29			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000361931600015	26320368

In this study, two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting group-VA monolayers were theoretically screened for the electrochemical CER by means of the density functional theory (DFT) method. Our results reveal the monolayered beta-arsenene has the ultralow thermodynamic overpotential of 0.068 V for CER, which is close to that of the commercial Ru/Ir-based dimensionally stable anode (DSA) of 0.08 V @ 10 mA cm(-2) and 0.13 V from experiments and theory, respectively. The change of CER pathways via Cl* intermediate on 2D beta-arsenene also efficiently suppresses the parasitical oxygen gas production because of a high theoretical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential of 1.95 V. Our findings may therefore expand the scope of the electrocatalysts design for CER by using emerging 2D materials.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2073-4344		WOS:000775714700001

Herein we report a Co-imidazolate framework (ZIF 67) as an OER catalyst that exhibits high activity in both a three electrode cell and an electrolyzer. Additionally, Fe, Ni, and Zn have been incorporated into ZIF 67 to evaluate their effects on the OER activity of ZIF 67. Due to the high charge conductivity of ZIF 67, none of the reported catalyst was carbonized at high temperature, a process that is generally accompanied by significant mass loss. Hence, in addition to being highly active, these catalysts are scalable which makes them promising candidates for application in commercial power markets.									18	0	0	0	3	0	18			2574-0962			WOS:000483434700028

Herein, we report a facile two-step approach to synthesizing La-oped CoOx nanosheets (NSs) with abundant oxygen vacancies by a La-triggered effect. Profiting from enriched O-vac and fast charge transfer, La-doped CoOx NSs deliver a remarkably high OER activity with a low overpotential of 353 mV at 10.0 mA m(-2) and a Tafel slope of 78.2 MV dec(-1), surpassing those of initial CoOx, IrO2, and most reported non-noble metal based electrocatalysts. In addition, they also exhibit superior durability with only slight degradation after continuous operation of 35 h in a 0.1 M KOH solution. Undoubtedly, the results inspire the use of La into the oxygen vacancies to explore highly active catalysts for various applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we demonstrate that hollow structured bimetallic PtNi/C synthesized through a facile solution-based approach can be employed as a highly active bifunctional electrocatalyst for both ORR and OER, showing a combined ORR and OER overpotential of 0.69 V, which represents a record low value for a bifunctional electrocatalyst. Rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) technique discloses that ORR was proceeding predominantly through the desired 4-electron pathway on the PtNi/C catalyst. Moreover, the PtNi/C is also found rather stable for both ORR and OER, with small activity lost after the accelerated durability test. These data echo the importance of innovative bi-/multi-metallic nanostructures for highly efficient catalysts that depend critically on using precious metals, for application in energy storage/conversion technologies.									94	5	0	0	0	0	95			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000414113400004

Electrochemical technology is considered one of the most promising and effective approaches in this regard. Herein, to explore the influence of HNO3 concentration on galvanostatic deconsolidation, 4%-68% HNO3 were taken as examples. The matrix graphite anodes gradually exfoliated to fragments in 34% HNO3, while expanding in other concentrations. The characterization results of deconsolidated fragments and galvanostatic curves identified the highest oxygen content was reached in 34% HNO3 due to the combined effect of intercalation, hydrolysis and oxygen evolution. In higher HNO3 concentrations like 68%, the intercalating agent predominates and therefore the intercalation and following hydrolysis reactions are the main causes of matrix graphite deconsolidation, with no oxygen evolution occurring. In contrast, in lower HNO3 concentrations like 4%, the violent oxygen evolution reaction hinders the intercalation and hydrolysis reactions. In short, only the combined interaction of intercalation, hydrolysis and oxygen evolution can deconsolidate the bulk matrix graphite into a more homogeneous powder.

Herein, a versatile, effective and economic co-precipitation synthesis of spinel NiCo2O4 with an urchin-like structure has been reported as an electrocatalyst for rechargeable non-aqueous Li-O-2 batteries. The spherical urchin-like structure of spinel NiCo2O4 was formed without the use of any template or surfactant. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics in the Li-O-2 batteries could be drastically improved by employing the effective NiCo2O4 catalyst, achieving a higher discharge potential and rate. In particular, the urchin-like structure of the catalyst not only provides more electrocatalytic sites but also promotes mass transport in the electrolyte. In addition, mesoporous NiCo2O4 can efficiently catalyze the formation and decomposition of Li2O2. The Li-O-2 battery containing the urchin-like NiCo2O4 catalyst exhibited the highest specific capacity of about 7309 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 mA cm(-2). The integrity and porosity of spinel NiCo2O4 had a significant effect on the performance of the Li-O-2 battery with reasonable specific capacity and cyclability, suggesting that the NiCo2O4-based materials can be effective catalysts for oxygen electrode in high performance Li-O-2 batteries.

These oxides follow the monoclinic crystal geometry. The study shows that the new oxide is highly active towards the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline solutions and that its activity seems to depend upon the molar ratio of Mo and Fe in the oxide. The oxide with [Mo]/[Fe] = 1.0 is observed to exhibit the greatest electrocatalytic activity. The reaction order with respect to OH- concentration has been found to be fractional (0.8-1.6).

The perovskites with varied Ni and Co content (of x = 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9) were synthesized via sol-gel glycine-nitrite combustion followed by heat-treated at 700, 900 and 1200 degrees C. The cubic perovskite phase of PrNixCo1-xO3-delta was stabilized at x = 0.1, 0.5 in the entire temperature range (of 700 degrees C-1200 degrees C), while the perovskite phase of SmNixCo1-xO3-delta (x = 0.1, 0.5) was observed only at lower temperatures (of 700 and 900 degrees C). Consequently, changes in structural properties resulted in superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrochemical activity in comparison to the state-of-the-art IrO2. Among the Sm-based perovskites, SmNi0.1Co0.9O3-delta (700 degrees C) demonstrated OER mass activity of 495 mA/mg and the highest oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of 95 mA/cm(2).mg. For Pr-based perovskites, the highest electrocatalytic activity toward OER and ORR was observed for PrNi0.1Co0.9O3-delta (900 degrees C) resulting in 60 mA/mg for ORR and 680 mA/mg for OER which is 50% higher than the mass activity of the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst. The overall performance of the composites is discussed in terms of graphene support interactions, Co and Ni redox processes, relative concentration of oxygen-vacancy sites and OER/ORR bi-functionality.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000503098200010

However, how to fabricate metal/metal oxides with abundant interfaces and well-dispersed metal phases is a challenge, and the synergistic effect between metal and metal oxides on boosting the electrocatalytic activities is still ambiguous. Herein, by controlling the lithium-induced conversion reaction of metal oxides, metal/metal oxide composites with plentiful interfaces and excellent electrical interconnection are fabricated, which can enhance the active sites, and accelerate the mass transfer during the electrocatalytic reaction. As a result, the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution activities of the as-fabricated metal/metal oxide composite catalysts including NiCo/NiCo2O4, NiMn/NiMn(2)O(4)and CoMn/CoMn(2)O(4)are greatly improved. The catalytic mechanism is also explored using thein-situX-ray and Raman spectroscopic tracking to uncover the real active centers and the synergistic effect between the metal and metal oxides during water oxidation. Density functional theory plus U (DFT + U) calculation confirms the metal in the composite can optimize the catalytic reaction path and reduce the reaction barrier, thus boosting the electrocatalytic kinetics.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000565484600001

Herein, Mn doped Ni2P microflowers with porous feature directly grown on Ni foam have been successfully synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method and phosphorization treatment. By detailed analyzing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results, it can be found that the electronic structure of Ni2P can be efficiently regulated by Mn doping. As expected, the Mn-doped Ni2P microflowers with an optimal Mn/Ni ratio of 0.053 exhibit a low overpotential of 205 mV for HER and 330 mV for OER to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0M KOH solution.

However, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) suffers greatly from low reaction kinetics and thereby hampers the energy efficiency of alkaline water electrolysers. In recent years, tremendous efforts have been dedicated to the pursuit of highly efficient, low cost and stable electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction. Herein, an amorphous FeOOH roughened capillary-liked CoAl layered double hydroxide (LDH) catalyst grown on nickel foam (denoted as FeOOH-CoAl LDH/NF) was reported for OER electrolysis. The developed FeOOH-CoAl LDH/NF electrode shows excellent OER activity with over potentials of 228 mV and 250 mV to deliver a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution, respectively, ranking it one of the most promising OER catalysts based on transition-metal-based LDH. This is owed to the formed capillary-liked hierarchy structure with high-porosity as well as the strong electronic interaction between FeOOH and CoAl LDH. The developed morphological engineering approach to build hierarchal porous structures together with facile amorphous FeOOH modification may be extended to other layered double hydroxide catalyst for enhanced OER activities.

Thermal analysis and variable temperature X-ray diffraction of the sol-gel precursor revealed the phase formation temperature of 700 degrees C. The oxygen non-stoichiometry was found in both LNO-SS and LNO-SG samples through iodometric titrations. A detailed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic surface and depth profiling analyses revealed the presence of Ni2+ due to oxygen vacancies. The influence of mixed-valence states of nickel (+2 and +3) on the properties of LaNiO3 was demonstrated. A comparison of electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of the two LaNiO3 samples was made in alkaline conditions. LNO-SG exhibited an onset potential of 1.60 V (vs. RHE) and a higher current density than LNO-SS. Both the samples exhibited a weak ferromagnetic behaviour at 300 K and LNO-SS showed a spin glass-like behaviour at low temperatures. These OER activities and unusual magnetic properties of LaNiO3 can be attributed to the oxygen vacancy and mixed-valence states of nickel.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000826802300001

Herein, we demonstrate the OER efficiently catalyzed by a novel quasi-single-crystalline cobalt fluoride, and reveal its surface structure evolution during the OER process that is instructive for catalysis process understanding and novel catalysts design. Because of strong ionic bonding dissociation driven by the chemical and electrochemical conditions, the structural evolution can readily generate such an active phase during the OER process. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in-situ Raman spectrum and microscopic observation confirm the structure evolution from pure cobalt fluoride to cobalt oxy/hydroxide over their surface, and the chemical anionic reconstruction induced cobalt oxy/hydroxide passive layer formation. The 3D nanoflower nanostructure can efficiently expose more active sites and increase mass transportation by expanding the contact surface to the electrolyte. Remarkably, no activation is required to reach stable catalytic performance. It only needs an overpotential as low as 285 mV to afford 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 60 mV dec(-1), outperforming the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst and some analogs transitional metal-based catalyst. It also shows excellent stability. The current findings are instructive in understanding OER catalytic reaction and active Co-based catalysts fabrication.									49	1	0	0	8	0	49			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000552025300032

Benefiting from the electronic structure effect of bimetallic composition and unique nanoarchitectures with abundant catalytically active sites and mass diffusion pathways, the as-constructed IrRh NAs can efficiently drive both the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions in alkaline conditions.

Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English)											10.1002/anie.202214794				2022-Oct-24	2022	Designing metal-organic framework (MOF)-based catalysts with superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and robust durability simultaneously is highly required yet very challenging due to the limited intrinsic activity and their elusive evolution under harsh OER conditions. Herein, a steady self-reconstructed MOF heterojunction is constructed via redox electrochemistry and topology-guided strategy. Thanks to the inhibiting effect from hydrogen bonds of Ni-BDC-1 (BDC=1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid), the obatained MOF heterojunction shows greatly improved OER activity with low overpotential of 225 mV at 10 mA cm-2, relative to the totally reconstructed Ni-BDC-3 (332 mV). Density function theory calculations reveal that the formed built-in electric field in the MOF heterojunction remarkably optimizes the ad/desorption free energy of active Ni sites. Moreover, such MOF heterojunction shows superior durability attributed to the shielding effect of the surface-evolved NiOOH coating.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1521-3773		MEDLINE:36278261	36278261

Multifarious strategies have been developed to access SACs, however, it still remains a formidable challenge to fabricate SACs with well-defined structure and high mass loading because of the high propensity of single atoms to aggregate. Atom migration-trapping (AMT) strategy is an efficient route to guarantee that only the most stable binding sites are occupied, thus, achieving highly stable SACs at large scale. In this article, we summarize recent advances in the AMT strategy to prepare SACs and their applications in diverse energy-related electrocatalysis including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). In the end, we present a brief conclusion and perspective about the AMT phenomenon for the synthesis of SACs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

CoFe-layered double hydroxide (CoFe-OH) has been widely considered as one of the most efficient electrocatalysts for OER in basic aqueous solution. However, it still suffers from low activity in neutral electrolyte. This paper describes partially oxidized CoFe-OH (PO-CoFe-OH) with enhanced covalency of M-O bonds and displays enhanced OER performance under mild condition. Mechanism studies reveal the suitably enhanced M-O covalency in PO-CoFe-OH shifts the OER mechanism to lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism and also promotes the rate-limiting deprotonation, providing superior OER performance. It just requires the overpotentials of 186 and 365 mV to drive the current density densities of 1 and 10 mA.cm(-2) in 0.1 M KHCO3 aqueous solution (pH = 8.3), respectively. It provides a new process for rational design of efficient catalysts for water oxidation in mild conditions.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000643200100002

Later, the general synthetic methods used to prepare TMS-based materials are explained in order to delve into the various strategies being used to achieve higher electrocatalytic performance in the HER. Complementary strategies can be used to increase the OER performance of TMS, resulting in bifunctional water-splitting electrocatalysts for both the HER and the OER. Finally, the current challenges and future opportunities of TMS materials in the context of water splitting are summarized. The aim herein is to provide insights gathered in the process of studying TMS, and describe valuable guidelines for engineering other kinds of nanomaterial catalysts for energy conversion and storage technologies.									735	44	0	0	29	0	737			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000465600000008	30793387

The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on perovskite oxide thin films in alkaline solution were observed by linear sweep voltammetry using a rotating disk electrode. Although we confirmed that the resultant perovskite oxide thin films were sufficiently electroconductive to facilitate the ferricyanide reduction reaction on themselves, the ORR activities of perovskite oxide thin films were much lower than those of conventional composite electrodes, which consist of perovskite oxide powder and carbon black. In contrast, the OER activities of thin films and their activity order (La0.8Sr0.2CoO3 > LaMnO3 >= La0.8Sr0.2MnO3) were almost the same as those of conventional composite electrodes. We discuss the catalytic roles of perovskite oxides and carbon powder in oxygen electrodes and propose possible reaction paths for the ORR and OER. (C) 2014 The Electrochemical Society.

Here, we report a homogeneous multi-metal-site oxyhydroxide electrocatalyst (consisting of Fe doped NiOOH and Cu doped NiOOH) obtained byin situelectrochemical dealloying of the multi-metal-site alloy (consisting of FeNi(3)and NiCu alloys). Thein situstructural evolution process manipulates the intermediate and enhances the water oxidation performance. After dealloying, the electrochemically dealloyed catalyst exhibits a small overpotential at large current density (250 mV at 100 mA cm(-2)), low Tafel slope (34 mV dec(-1)), remarkably increased ECSA (8-fold larger than before), and superior durability for 200 h at 100 mA cm(-2). This electrocatalyst presents one of the best performances among all reported transition metal-based electrocatalysts, and is even superior to the benchmark RuO2.OperandoATR FT-IR reveals that the electrochemically dealloyed electrocatalyst could manipulate the reaction path based on direct O(2)evolution mechanism (DOEM) and facilitate the formation of O-O bonds. This fundamental understanding will contribute to the identification and design of the active structure of oxygen evolution electrocatalysts.									43	2	0	0	3	0	43			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000549074800019

In this study, A CoFe2O4/graphene nanohybrid is facilely synthesized via a two-step process and applied as an electrocatalyst for the ORR and the OER. The as-prepared CoFe2O4/graphene nanohybrid demonstrates excellent catalytic activity for the ORR. At the same mass loading, the Tafel slope of CoFe2O4/graphene electrocatalyst for the ORR is comparable to that of the commercial Pt/C (20 wt% Pt on Vulcan XC-72, Johnson Matthey). The ORR on CoFe2O4/graphene mainly favours a direct 4e(-) reaction pathway. The CoFe2O4/graphene nanohybrid also affords high catalytic activity for the OER. The chronoamperometric tests show that CoFe2O4/graphene catalyst exhibits excellent stability for both the ORR and the OER, outperforming the commercial Pt/C. The high electrocatalytic activity and durability of CoFe2O4/graphene nanohybrid are attributed to the strong coupling between CoFe2O4 nanoparticles and graphene. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Here, homologous Co-Ni-based nanotube/nanosheet structures with tunable Co/Ni ratios, including hydroxides and nitrides, are grown on conductive substrates by a cation-exchanging method to grow hydroxides, followed by anion exchanging to obtain corresponding nitrides. These hydroxide OER catalysts and nitride HER catalysts exhibit low overpotentials, small Tafel slopes, and high current densities, which are attributed to their large electrochemically reactive surface, 1D morphologies for charge conduction, and octahedral coordination states of metal ions for efficient catalytic activities. The homologous Co-Ni-based nanotube hydroxides and nitrides suggest promising electrocatalysts for full water splitting with high efficiency, good stability, convenient fabrication, and low cost.									230	7	0	0	11	0	230			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000370004900007

However, this model cannot be used to explain the extremely high carrier accumulations in ultrathin semiconductor catalysis observed in our work. Inspired by the recently developed ion-controlled electronics, we revisit the semiconductor-electrolyte interface and unravel a universal self-gating phenomenon through microcell-based in situ electronic/electrochemical measurements to clarify the electronic-conduction modulation of semiconductors during the electrocatalytic reaction. We then demonstrate that the type of semiconductor catalyst strongly correlates with their electrocatalysis; that is, n-type semiconductor catalysts favour cathodic reactions such as the hydrogen evolution reaction, p-type ones prefer anodic reactions such as the oxygen evolution reaction and bipolar ones tend to perform both anodic and cathodic reactions. Our study provides new insight into the electronic origin of the semiconductor-electrolyte interface during electrocatalysis, paving the way for designing high-performance semiconductor catalysts.									96	9	0	0	4	0	99			1476-1122	1476-4660		WOS:000486618800019	31332336

Herein, it is reported that the electrocatalytic performance of dual functional (i.e., electrocatalytic and photothermal functions) Co3O4 can be dramatically improved via its photothermal effect. The operating temperature of the Co3O4 electrode is elevated in situ under near infrared (NIR) light irradiation, resulting in enhanced oxygen evolution activity due to its accelerated electrical conductivity, reaction kinetics, and desorption rate of O-2 bubbles from the electrode. In addition, photothermal effect can also enhance the electrocatalytic reaction rates of metal-doped Co3O4 electrodes, indicating that it is able to significantly improve the OER activities of electrodes together with other modification strategies. With the assistance of the photothermal effect, the obtained Ni-doped Co3O4 catalyst requires an extremely low overpotential of 208 mV to achieve a benchmark of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope, superior to most reported Co-based catalysts. Significantly, the electrocatalytic performance of other electrodes with photothermal effect, such as CoN, CoP, and CoS, are also boosted under NIR light irradiation, indicating opportunities for implementing photothermal enhancement in electrocatalytic water splitting.									33	1	0	0	2	0	33			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000486591000001	31512397

Herein, metal organic framework-derived (MOF-derived) hollow CoSx@MoS2 microcubes were successfully synthesized by a novel method. Co-MOF [(CH3)(2)NH2][Co(HCOO)(3)] prepared by a simple liquid precipitation method at room temperature reacted with S2- released from thioacetamide (TAA) to generate Co9S8 under solvothermal conditions. Through hydrothermal treatment, numerous MoS2 nano sheets grew on the surface of CoSx vertically and uniformly after introduction of sulfur and molybdenum sources, finally generating CoSx@MoS2 heterostructures. As bifunctional electrocatalysts, the heterostructures exhibited remarkable performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction with a low overpotential of 239 mV when the current density increased up to 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 103 mV dec(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4. They also worked effectively for the oxygen evolution reaction with a low overpotential of 347 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. The enhanced electrocatalytic activities of CoSx@MoS2 can be ascribed to their unique heterostructures and the synergism between CoSx and MoS2.									62	1	0	0	4	0	61			2168-0485			WOS:000446413100044

However, the relatively inert catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) suppresses their practical applications in Li-O-2 battery. Here, nanoscale NiCo2O4 (NCO) layer with high OER catalytic activity has been homogenously incorporated into the surface of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM) nanorods to form a core-shell structure. In this typical structure, the ORR mainly occurred on the LSM core, while the OER mainly occurred on the nanoscale NCO shell, and structure damage of catalysts coming from gas evolution can be greatly avoided. The synergy of high catalytic activity and core shell structure results in the Li-O-2 battery with good rate capability and excellent cycle stability, which sustains 80 cycles without capacity attenuation at a high current density of 200 mA g(-1).

In addition to the electrochemical characterization, the electrode was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (X-EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy and elemental analyses via inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The spontaneous formation of a catalytic film, during the aging test, gives rise to interesting electrode performances. Indeed, this film, containing a large part of nanocrystalline nickel oxides (83 at% of cationic composition), catalyzes the oxygen evolution reaction via two phenomena: an increase of the roughness of the electrode surface and a hypo-hyper d interbonding effect, due to the presence of well dispersed additives of Fe and Cr in the film.

Here we demonstrate that rationally designed hybrid catalysts through the in situ exsolution process of metallic nanoparticles on a B-site Ni-substituted lead ruthenate pyrochlore oxide improve both oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction activity. A combination of operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations reveals that the generated oxygen and cation vacancies in the pyrochlore oxide support during the in situ exsolution process can decrease the charge-transfer energy, thereby facilitating charge transfer between exsolved metal nanoparticles-oxide support as well as hybrid catalyst-electrolyte. These findings establish a structure-property relationship of complicated hybrid catalysts for efficient water splitting, suggesting a new strategy in designing various hybrid catalysts for other electrochemical reactions.									21	0	0	0	2	0	21			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000652354100035

However, the states of the art catalytic performance are still significantly restricted by the limited content of active sites for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, a series of NC encapsulating CoNi samples as a bifunctional catalyst for both ORR and OER were synthesized via a simple pyrolysis method. Large surface area and high content M-N (x) active sites promote the ORR activity and accelerate the surface reconstruction layer for high OER performance. The NC encapsulating CoNi with optimized Co/Ni ratio (2:1) shows high ORR activity with a half-wave of potential (0.85 V) and a low overpotential of 309 mV for OER. Rechargeable Zn-air battery assembled by an air cathode with the NC encapsulating CoNi exhibits a power density of 143 mW cm(-2) and good cyclability over 100 h at 10 mA cm(-2). This mechanism work provides a feasible strategy for developing high activity and low cost bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000867398900001

Water oxidation catalysts are typically considered bound by adsorbate scaling relations, limiting their activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as well as selectivity between OER and the chlorine evolution reaction (CER) that compete in saline water streams. RuO2 is highly active for both reactions, and recent measurements have shown that the OER activity is greater on undercoordinated, high index facets compared to the lowest energy (110) facet often studied. The growth of such orien-tations as epitaxial films, however, can result in appreciable strain and potential surface faceting via its relaxation. We find the activity and selectivity toward OER and CER vary with thickness in epitaxial (101) RuO2 thin films: OER activity decreases four times as film thickness increases from 8 nm to 48 nm, while CER activity is comparable. Thus, strain and its relaxation can be used to break scaling relationships between OER and CER, highlighting the important role that defects play in selective oxidation processes on RuO2 in chloride-containing media.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, hollow Co-based layered double hydroxide (LDH) decorated with Ag nanoparticles (Ag@H-Co--LDH) was constructed using ion etching of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks-67 (ZIF-67), followed by simple stirring with Ag salts. Hollow double layered structure could expose rich active centers and improve electron transfer and mass transport. Meanwhile, the introduction of Ag species greatly increases the electrical conductivity and enhances cobalt species to form highly catalytically active Co4+. Therefore, the as-obtained Ag@H-Co-LDH exhibits a distinguished OER activity with a low overpotential of 298 mV to provide an oxygen evolution current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to that of Co-LDH and even commercial RuO2.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000784727900001

The deposited thin films exhibited a mixed morphology of nanosheets and nanoflakes. We investigated the effect of increasing Ni(OH)(2) content on the electrocatalytic activity toward the OER and the HER in 1 M KOH. We found that the hybrid catalyst with low Ni (OH)(2) content (20 wt%) revealed a high OER electrocatalytic activity that delivers 50 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 330 mV with a low Tafel slope of 78 mV dec(-1). Meanwhile, catalysts with higher Ni(OH)(2) content (80 wt%) exhibited superior HER activity that delivered 20 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 154 mV and a low Tafel slope of 92 mV dec(-1).

Thus, an efficient catalyst toward the oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction (OER and ORR) is highly essential for high-performance Zn-air batteries. Here, we have reported bifunctional nickel iron phosphide/phosphate (NiFeP/Pi) catalysts with various Ni/Fe ratios toward oxygen electrocatalysis in alkaline media. These catalysts are highly active toward OER and ORR, wherein NiFe(1:2)P/Pi exhibits a low OER overpotential of 0.21 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and a high ORR onset potential (0.98 V vs RHE) with the lowest potential difference (Delta E = E-10 - E-1/2) of 0.62 V, which surpasses that of the benchmark Pt/C and RuO2 catalyst as well as those of most previously reported bifunctional catalysts. Furthermore, the NiFe(1:2)P/Pi-based Zn-air battery demonstrates a very high power density of 395 mW cm(-2) and outstanding discharge capacity of 900 mAh g(-1)@10 mA cm(-2) along with steady cyclability, maintaining 98% of the round trip efficiency over 300 cycles. These results are helpful for a good understanding of the composition-activity relation with a certain band gap toward high-performance Zn-air batteries.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000718271300064	34709029

The oxygen evolution reaction is more energetically demanding and kinetically sluggish and represents the bottleneck for a commercial competitiveness of electrochemical hydrogen production from water. Moreover, oxygen is essentially a waste product of low commercial value since the primary interest is to convert electrical energy into hydrogen as a storable energy carrier. We report on the anodic oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to afford the more valuable product 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) as a suitable alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction. Notably, HMF oxidation is thermodynamically more favorable than water oxidation and hence leads to an overall improved energy efficiency for H-2 production. In addition, contrary to the "waste product O-2", FDCA can be further utilized, e.g., for production of polyethylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate (PEF), a sustainable polymer analog to polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and thus represents a valuable product for the chemical industry with potential large scale use. Various cobalt-metalloid alloys (CoX; X = B, Si, P, Te, As) were investigated as potential catalysts for HMF oxidation. In this series, CoB required 180 mV less overpotential to reach a current density of 55 mA cm(-2) relative to OER with the same electrode. Electrolysis of HMF using a CoB modified nickel foam electrode at 1.45 V vs RHE achieved close to 100% selective conversion of HMF to FDCA at 100% faradaic efficiency.									41	2	0	0	3	0	41			1860-5397			WOS:000435488700001	29977407

This paper reviewed monofunctional electrocatalysts, bifunctional electrocatalysts and multifunctional electrocatalysts for three important reactions in electrocatalytic process, i.e., hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The electrochemical reaction mechanisms of water splitting and fuel cell were introduced, respectively. The design, preparation, relationship and functional characteristics was described for the monofunctional electrocatalysts, bifunctional electrocatalysts and multifunctional electrocatalysts and other electrochemical materials. The systematical characterization and resolving were performed on these promising non-noble metal electrocatalysts by using scanning electron microscopy, atomic force scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy and other complementary techniques. The surface morphology, structure, internal composition, elemental distribution and other related information were also analyzed. From the aspects of providing more defect vacancies and potential active sites, optimizing interface interaction, increasing electrochemical specific surface area, functionalizing synergistic effect, the mechanisms of improving conductivity and enhancing stability of electrocatalyst as well as reducing cost were analyzed.

Much effort has been devoted to regulating the components, phases, crystallinity, facets, morphology and defects to optimize the electronic structures for improved catalytic activity. However, it is still a great challenge to develop low-cost and efficient electrocatalysts. Recently, photo-assisted electrocatalysis has attracted extensive research interest due to its appealing benefits for the charge transfer, surface electronic structures, and reaction selectivity. It adds a new dimension for electrocatalyst optimization, although it is still in the preliminary stage. A comprehensive and timely review on this specific subject is necessary, aiming to present recent significant achievements and challenges and point out future research directions. In this review, three primary strategies for photo-assisted electrocatalysis are systematically summarized: photo-generated carrier-assisted, localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)-assisted, and photothermally-assisted electrochemical enhancement. In each part, possible mechanisms are outlined and followed by the most recent advances. Finally, key challenges, as well as possible strategies to address them, are highlighted for the hotly developing field.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000723282900001

Concerning the oxygen evolution reaction and the oxidation of formic acid, both films show similar mechanism.The electrode stability measurements have shown that both films are not corroded under strong OER or organics oxidation conditions and therefore, to summarize, both IrO2-based films exhibit similar electrochemical behaviours.

The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of these catalysts was found to increase with the increasing Se:Ni ratio due to which NiSe2 turned out to be the better one among others. Interestingly, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of these catalysts showed a different trend irrespective of Se:Ni ratio where the ease of formation of NiOOH was found to control the kinetic current. Such influences of stoichiometry in HER and ease of NiOOH formation in OER had never been revealed before for nickel selenide system.									32	0	0	0	1	0	31			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000471996400131

However, improving their intrinsic catalytic activity is essential for practical application. In this work, CeO2 with three different morphologies (rod, cube, octahedron) and supported IrOx nanoparticles were fabricated, and they display morphology-dependent OER activity. The IrOx/CeO2-rod shows the highest activity; the catalysts have a catalytic activity sequence of rod > cube > octahedron. A plausible mechanism was proposed: the CeO2 support with different morphologies modulates the electronic structure of IrOx by the synergistic interaction promoted by oxygen vacancies between the active component and the support, thereby altering the catalytic activity of the IrOx/CeO2 catalyst.

Both the morphology and composition of the catalyst were optimized by a facile hydrothermal reaction, resulting in a 10h reacted sample demonstrating significantly enhanced activity toward both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 0.1m KOH. Specifically, the catalyst demonstrated -0.28 and 0.60V versus SCE (saturated calomel electrode) at the ORR half-wave potential and an OER current density of 10mAcm(-2), respectively. The resulting ORR/OER potential difference of 0.90V was the smallest compared to the catalysts synthesized using 2, 6, and 12h of hydrothermal reaction time. The excellent bifunctional activity of the catalyst is attributed to the nanoscale porous morphology and the spinel nickel cobaltite composition, which improved the active site exposure and transport of reactants and charges during the oxygen reactions.									23	0	0	0	1	0	23			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000423205200008	29106027

Unfortunately, the electrochemical water splitting is limited by the slow oxygen evolution reaction kinetics at anode. So far, the synthesis of active and stable electrocatalysts in acid media is still a challenging work. In the work, carbon nanobowls supported ultrafine iridium nanocrystals are synthesized by a simple complexation-reduction method with assistance of 1-hydroxyethane-1, 1-diphosphonic acid, which effectively serves as as complexant, capping agent and surfactant during the synthesis. The good dispersion and ultrafine size of Ir nanocrystals, the modified interfacial property from phosphonate with excellent hydrophilicity, as well as carbon nanobowls as advanced carbon supports contribute to their excellent electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction in acid media. The as-prepared carbon nanobowls supported ultrafine iridium nanocrystals present an ultra-low overpotential of 290 mV to achieve the mass activity of 1000 A g(-1) and a small Tafel slope of 49.1 mV dec(-1), which significantly outperform commercial Ir/C electrocatalyst. The remarkable activity and durability make carbon nanobowls supported ultrafine iridium nanocrystals as a potential candidate for the oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalyst in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer.

Pcs and their derivatives are more attractive than many other macrocycles as electrocatalysts since, although they are structurally related to natural porphyrin complexes, they offer the advantages of low cost, facile synthesis and good chemical stability. Moreover, their high tailorability and structural diversity mean Pcs have great potential for application in electrochemical devices. Here we review the structure and composition of Pcs, methods of synthesis of Pcs and their analogues, as well as applications of Pc-based heterogeneous electrocatalysts. Optimization strategies for Pc-based materials for electrocatalysis of ORR, CO2RR, OER and HER are proposed, based on the mechanisms of the different electrochemical reactions. We also discuss the structure/composition-catalytic activity relationships for different Pc materials and Pc-based electrocatalysts in order to identify future practical applications. Finally, future opportunities and challenges in the use of molecular Pcs and Pc derivatives as electrocatalysts are discussed.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000716052500001	34751683

The results indicate the amounts of Mn-III and Mn-IV species in MnOx and CaMnO3 depend on potential. A Mn-V species was identified in both structures during the OER. Time-delay titration of Mn-V further revealed that MnOx produced two types of active sites with different OER reaction rates: k '(fast)(MnOx)=1.21 s(-1) and k'(slow)(MnOx)=0.24 s(-1). In contrast, CaMnO3 perovskites in which the Mn-V species formed at a less positive potential than that in MnOx, displayed only one kinetic behavior with a faster reaction rate of 1.72 s(-1).									22	1	0	0	1	0	22			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000587487400001	32939974

Here, we report a vacancy-boosting strategy to realize enhanced activity in a library of novel selenite electrocatalysts.

Thus, they present great potential for noble metal-based electrochemical application systems, such as water electrolyzers and fuel cells. However, their practical applications are severely hindered by intrinsic complications, namely atom agglomeration and relocation, originating from the uncontrollably high surface energy of isolated single-atoms (SAs) during postsynthetic treatment processes or catalytic reactions. Extensive efforts have been made to develop new methodologies for strengthening the interactions between SAs and supports, which could ensure the desired stability of the active catalytic sites and their full utilization by SACs. This review covers the recent progress in SACs development while emphasizing the association between the regulation of coordination environments (e.g., coordination atoms, numbers, sites, structures) and the electrocatalytic performance of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The crucial role of coordination chemistry in modifying the intrinsic properties of SACs and manipulating their metal-loading, stability, and catalytic properties is elucidated.

However, it is critical to develop durable and cost-effective electrocatalysts using earth-abundant materials for overall water splitting. Here we report, a facile method to fabricate N-doped cotton cloth as an electrocatalyst. The N-doped cotton cloth showed outstanding performance as an electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. For oxygen evolution reaction (OER), N-doped cotton cloth requires a low overpotential of 351 mV to deliver 10 mA/cm(2) of current density with a Tafel slope of 88 mV/dec. On the other hand, it requires 233 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a Tafel slope of 135 mV/dec. Furthermore, the electrocatalyst showed outstanding electrocatalytic stability and flexibility. The observed overpotential and stability are among the best for the metal-free electrocatalyst. Such a binder-free approach for fabrication of high performance, durable and flexible bi-functional (HER and OER) electrocatalyst could be a promising way to generate green energy from water.									22	3	0	0	2	0	22			0257-8972			WOS:000436917300045

This is attributed to the synergistic effects between transition metals in the active sites of the material and a hierarchically porous microstructure, achieved through the reactive carbonitride template formed from dicyandiamide during the pyrolysis.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000633163700014

Electrocatalytic water splitting is one of the most powerful and widespread technologies. The development of highly efficient, inexpensive, flexible, and versatile water electrolysis devices is desired. This review discusses the significance and impact of the electrolyte on electrocatalytic performance. Depending on the circumstances under which the water splitting reaction is conducted, the required solution conditions, such as the identity and molarity of ions, may significantly differ. Quantitative understanding of such electrolyte properties on electrolysis performance is effective to facilitate the development of efficient electrocatalytic systems. The electrolyte can directly participate in reaction schemes (kinetics), affect electrode stability, and/or indirectly impact the performance by influencing the concentration overpotential (mass transport). This review aims to guide fine-tuning of the electrolyte properties, or electrolyte engineering, for (photo)electrochemical water splitting reactions.									105	3	0	0	3	0	106			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000398838600002	27984671

Herein, we report a facile pyrolysis strategy for the controllable synthesis of NiCo@NiS/S-CNTs with NiCo@NiS nanoparticles anchored on sulfur-doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The obtained NiCo@NiS/S-CNT electrocatalyst exhibits excellent dual-functional catalytic activities under an alkaline condition, an ORR performance with an onset potential of -30 mV, and a half-wave potential of -150 mV (versus Ag/AgCl) while the overpotential for the HER is -1.16 V (versus Ag/AgCl) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). It was found that the incorporation of sulfur can regulate the electronic structure of CNTs to accelerate the electron transfer performance and generate new catalytic sites, thus contributing to greatly enhancing both the activity and stability of the catalytic process. This work provides a promising way for the rational design of efficient and robust catalysts for sustainable energy conversion.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000518974600001	31816611

Actually, the genesis of structural changes in electrochemical catalysts during the reaction process is often actively influenced by both intrinsic factors and various environmental fields. In this short review, we summarized the latest advances in the structural self-reconstruction of OER electrocatalysts, with a focus on the strategies in rationally driving reconstruction as well as the in situ capturing process, through the combination of synchrotron radiation-based multitechniques. Moreover, extensive efforts are encouraged to precisely manipulate the OER catalyst's self-optimization process, with capability to accelerate their high potential for various practical applications.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2451-9103			WOS:000704353800009

In this study, silver-nanoparticle-decorated transition-metal hydroxide (TMH) composites were synthesized by an approach based on a spontaneous redox reaction (SRR) at room temperature. The SRR between silver ions and TMH provides a simple and facile route to establish effective and stable heterostructures that can enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. Ag@Co(OH)(x) grown on carbon cloth exhibits outstanding OER activity and durability, even superior to IrO2 and many previously reported OER electrocatalysts. Experimental and theoretical analysis demonstrates that the strong electronic interaction between Ag and Co(OH)(2) activates the silver clusters as catalytically OER active sites, effectively optimizing the binding energies with reacted intermediates and facilitating the OER kinetics.									121	9	0	0	9	0	122			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000526818900043	32077180

The growth of Co-Fe-P from the Co-Fe-O is anisotropic. As a result, Co-Fe-P nanorods (from the polyhedral Co-Fe-O nanoparticles) and sea-urchin-like Co-Fe-P (from the cubic Co-Fe-O nanoparticles) are synthesized with both the nanorod and the sea-urchin-arm dimensions controlled by Co/Fe ratios. The Co-Fe-P structure, especially the sea-urchin-like (Co0.54Fe0.46)(2)P, shows enhanced catalysis for the oxygen evolution reaction in KOH with its catalytic efficiency surpassing the commercial Ir catalyst. Our synthesis is simple and may be readily extended to the preparation of other multimetallic phosphides for important catalysis and energy storage applications.									125	5	0	0	4	0	127			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000358987300036	26118355

Their electrocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is investigated. The results show that the NiCo2O4/Ti4O7 possesses not only the best stability but also the highest catalytic activity, which may be attributed to the enhanced electrical conductivity and higher contents of Co2+ and Ni3+ caused by Ti4O7 according to the analyses for electrochemical impedance spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectra.

Previous works have shown that manganese oxides are promising lithium-oxygen cathode catalysts, which is in agreement with their remarkable activities for the reduction and evolution of oxygen in aqueous media. Motivated by these resembling catalytic behaviors, we prepared and characterized a number of manganese oxide modifications directly on carbon black and attempted to correlate their oxygen reduction and evolution activities in aprotic and aqueous electrolytes. Although our results cannot confirm this correlation, they provide valuable insight into the reaction mechanisms at play in each medium. More precisely, in 0.1M potassium hydroxide, the reduction of oxygen is related to the reduction of a manganese(III) intermediate whereas the oxidation of hydrogen peroxide (which was regarded as a mimic of the lithium peroxide produced upon lithium-oxygen battery discharge) correlates with the transition between manganese(II) and manganese(III) phases. In the aprotic medium, manganese oxide cathodes prefilled with lithium peroxide showed a strong catalytic effect but were not active in the oxidation of lithium peroxide produced in the previous discharge. This discrepancy is thought to arise from the stark differences in the sizes and morphologies of the lithium peroxide involved in each test, which implies that the catalytic activity of a material for the oxidation of lithium peroxide prefilled on electrodes is not indicative of its behavior in the charging of a real lithium-oxygen cell.									20	0	0	0	2	0	21			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000326104700025

Herein, we demonstrate a concept-driven strategy of self-catalyzed oxygen evolution in PEC system to realize efficient and stable charge injection by introducing oxygen vacancies (O-vac) in the nitrogen-doped TiO2 (N-TiO2) which plays dual role of light absorber and electrochemical catalyst. DFT calculation reveals the oxygen vacancies confined in the N-TiO2 films lower its adsorption energy of H2O, leading to a dramatically increase in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) efficiency. Therefore significantly improved charge injection efficiency of 94.6% at 1.23 V-RHE can be achieved for the N-TiO2 with oxygen vacancies (TiO2-N-2) films in the absence of any oxygen evolution catalyst. More interestingly, the TiO2-N-2 electrode exhibits excellent stability with negligible photocurrent decay (2%) after 4 h of PEC reaction at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5G illumination. Systematic studies reveal that the O vacancies in the N-TiO2 play an important role in increasing the electrochemically active surface area and the reactivity of active sites along with reduction of anodic overpotential for oxygen evolution. It is worth mentioning that, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on self-catalyzed oxygen evolution in PEC systems. Consequently, the strategy provides an alternative route for efficient and stable PEC water splitting.									33	4	0	0	1	0	34			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000419833900047

Despite significant progress achieved in the past few decades, their commercialization is hindered by their fast degradation. This perspective article outlines the historical development of M-N-C electrocatalysts, the current understanding of their active catalytic sites, and crucial degradation mechanisms. We highlight that many methods used to tailor M-N-C electrocatalysts likely cause contradictory effects on activity and stability.

However, in situ synthesis is often difficult due to multistep procedures and harsh conditions. Herein, NiFe2O4 nanoparticles are successfully grown in situ on NiFe(OH)(x) nanosheets via using unique laser ablation in liquids technology. The quenching effect of the pulsed laser and the reduction of BH4- promote the generation of oxygen-vacancy-abundant NiFe(OH)(x)/NiFe2O4 nanocomposites, and the weak alkalinity of the NaBH4 solutions accelerates the production of NiFe(OH)(x) nanosheets. Profited from the affluent oxygen vacancies and enhancive surface areas, the NiFe(OH)(x)/NiFe2O4 nanocomposites reveal enhancement in electrocatalytic OER performance with small overpotential of 249 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 40.1 mV dec(-1), accompanied by superior stability (the current density retention after 150 h is 98.5% of the initial value). In addition, the NiFe(OH)(x)/ NiFe2O4 hybrid electrocatalysts also exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance for the urea oxidation reaction (a potential of 1.343 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 19.9 mV dec(-1)). This work can provide guidance for exploring other hydroxide/oxide materials with abundant oxygen vacancies and high surface areas.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000778888200005

The CoMnPi is formed on a conductive substrate using Co2+-modified phosphating. The CoMnPi is converted into layered-type, amorphous CoMnPOxHy by electrochemical activation, which is active toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Our phosphating-based method greatly simplifies the preparation procedure of electrodes for water electrolyzers, possibly resulting in wide utilization of H-2.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2574-0962			WOS:000669533800005

Here, we adopt the laser ablation in liquid technique to produce Ru nanoparticles (NPs) enriched with grain boundaries (GBs). The as-prepared Ru NPs were then applied as an OER catalyst, achieving an overpotential as low as 202 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4. Moreover, the catalyst demonstrated stability for over 10 h, which is much better than commercial RuO2 (305 mV). EXAFS analysis and DFT calculations revealed that both the remarkably enhanced activity and stability originated from the compressive strain caused by the GBs accumulated in the laser-generated Ru NPs.									25	1	0	0	1	0	26			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900020

Herein, regulating the crystalline structure and electronic configuration of Ni2P was proposed and realized by introducing foreign Mo element to reinforce the catalytic property for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). Doping high-valence Mo created more structural defects as the catalytic sites and regulated d-band structure of Ni with higher oxidation state for better adsorption of oxygen intermediates. As the result, electrochemical performances suggested the great improvement in OER and MOR in alkali for Mo-doped Ni2P with lower overpotentials and higher current densities, more active Ni sites and better conductivity, as compared with undoped Ni2P. Therefore, the regulation of structure and improvement in electrocatalytic activity demonstrated that this highly-efficient Mo-doped Ni2P is expected as a robust electrocatalyst for practical applications of water splitting and methanol fuel cell.

Though transition-metal oxides and oxysulfides are increasingly researched and used as oxygen evolution electrocatalysts, the bases of their differential activities are not properly under stood. In this article, we have synthesized NiCo2O4 and NiCo2OxS4-x by a chemical bath deposition technique, and the latter has shown better oxygen evolution performance, both in terms of stability and activity, under alkaline conditions. Comprehensive analysis through time-dependent cyclic voltammetry, microscopy, and elemental analysis reveal that the higher activity of NiCo2OxS4-x may be attributed to the lower metal-sulfur bond energy that facilitates the activation process to form the active metal hydroxide/oxyhydroxide species, higher electrochemically active surface area, higher pore diameter and rugged morphology that prevents corrosion. This work provides significant insights on the advantages of sulfur-containing materials as electrochemical precatgysts over their oxide counterparts for oxygen evolution reaction.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			2470-1343			WOS:000444182900048	31459041

Herein, we report a ZIF-67 derived hybrid Co-based carbon composite as bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalyst exhibiting excellent performance and stability in a custom-built Zn-air battery. The catalyst was formed by pyrolytic carbonization of ZIF-67 followed by mild oxidation and sulfurization to a hybrid composite (Co/Co3O4@CoS-SNC) comprised of multiple active sites including Co-N4, Co-N/SC, C-N/S-C, Co3O4 and CoS, as well as the surface and edge defects in the carbon matrix, that act concertedly yielding a highly efficient bifunctional ORR/OER catalyst for reversible oxygen electrodes. The catalyst affords remarkably low reversible overpotentials and stability not only in a 3-electrode system, but also in a customconstructed Zn-air battery, exhibiting competitive performance against state-of-the-art bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts reported to date and thus placing it among the best non-precious metal catalysts for reversible oxygen reactions.									37	1	0	0	2	0	37			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000663704900003

Here, a new class of Ru1Coy nanoparticles (NPs) with a smaller size (5 nm) is designed via a hydrothermal method for overall water splitting in an alkaline medium. The Ru/Co atomic ratio of the starting Ru1Coy NPs is adjusted experimentally, revealing that the difference of electrocatalytic activity is caused by the adjustment of electronic structure and the change of active surface area. The optimized Ru1Co2 NP catalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance with a lower overpotential of 240 mV for OER and 188 mV for HER at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the overall water splitting performance is demonstrated; a cell voltage of only 1.59 V is needed to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This work provides a direction for the design of bimetallic catalysts with high activity and stability.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			2574-0962			WOS:000516665300070

J	Liu, Zhixin; Guo, Zhengang; Yang, Fasong; Liu, Zhifeng					Zhengang, Guo/0000-0002-2874-770X			Hyperbranched NxPy/NiCoP Arrays Based on Nickel Foam Electrode for Efficient and Stable Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution								ELECTROCATALYSIS				13	5			611	621		10.1007/s12678-022-00747-1		MAY 2022		SEP 2022	2022	Transition metal phosphides have high catalytic performance and stability among non-precious metal electrocatalysts, particularly exhibiting good hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in alkaline solutions, due to the platinum-like electronic structure of transition metal phosphides. In this study, we successfully synthesized nickel phosphide and nickel cobalt phosphate hybrid on the three-dimensional nickel foam by a facile hydrothermal method. It is worth noting that the NxPy/NiCoP in 1 M KOH only needs the overpotential of 95 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the overpotential of 231 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is superior to most electrocatalysts. The obtained results indicate that there is a synergistic effect between the three elements of Ni, Co, and P, facilitating the process of electrocatalysis. Meanwhile, the synthesized electrode not only has a large active surface area, but also good electrical conductivity, effectively facilitating the electrocatalytic reaction kinetics. Thus, this work provides an effective route to a low-cost, high-performance catalyst for electrocatalytic hydrogen production.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000801130000001

Therefore, we successfully synthesized Fe3S4@NiS hollow nanospheres (HSs) by a one-step solvothermal process, applied in oxygen evolution reactions (OER) to provide sustainable energy. Owing to particular microstructure and proper elemental composition ratio, Fe3S4@NiS HSs (partially been oxidized) show an outstanding OER performance with the overpotential and Tafel slope of only 338 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 73 mV dec(-1) in 0.1 M KOH solution, respectively.

This study suggests hollow CeO2@Co2N nanosheets synthesized using Co-ZIF-L as a precursor, followed by a hydrothermal reaction and a nitridation process as very attractive OER catalysts. The increased activity is supposed to be due to nitridation and strong electronic interaction between CeO2 and Co2N that contribute to the formation of active CoOOH phase. The synthesized CeO2@Co2N exhibits low overpotentials of 219 and 345 mV at OER current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, as well as a long-term durability of 30 h at a comparatively high current density of 100 mA cm(-2).									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2196-7350			WOS:000625723200001

Metal cations (including transition metal and noble metal cations), particularly high-valence metal cations that show high catalytic activity and can serve as the main active sites in electrochemical processes, have received special attention for developing advanced electrocatalysts. In this review, heterogenous electrocatalyst design strategies based on high-valence metal sites are presented, and associated materials designed for water splitting are summarized. In the discussion, emphasis is given to high-valence metal sites combined with the modulation of the phase/electronic/defect structure and strategies of performance improvement. Specifically, the importance of using advanced in situ and operando techniques to track the real high-valence metal-based active sites during the electrochemical process is highlighted. Remaining challenges and future research directions are also proposed. It is expected that this comprehensive discussion of electrocatalysts containing high-valence metal sites can be instructive to further explore advanced electrocatalysts for water splitting and other energy-related reactions.									79	4	0	0	7	0	80			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000618701600001
