J	Kruk, J; Strzalka, K								Redox changes of cytochrome b(559) in the presence of plastoquinones								JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY				276	1			86	91		10.1074/jbc.M003602200				JAN 5 2001	2001	We have found that short chain plastoquinones effectively stimulated photoreduction of the low potential form of cytochrome b(559) and were also active in dark oxidation of this cytochrome under anaerobic conditions in Triton X-100-solubilized photosystem II (PSII) particles. It is also shown that molecular oxygen competes considerably with the prenylquinones in cytochrome b(559) oxidation under aerobic conditions, indicating that both molecular oxygen and plastoquinones could be electron accepters from cytochrome b(559) in PSII preparations. alpha -Tocopherol quinone was not active in the stimulation of cytochrome photoreduction but efficiently oxidized it in the dark. Both the observed photoreduction and dark oxidation of the cytochrome were not sensitive to 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea. It was concluded that both quinone-binding sites responsible for the redox changes of cytochrome b(559) are different from either the Q(A) or Q(B) site in PSII and represent new quinone-binding sites in PSII.									71	1	0	0	61	0	72			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000166280700013	11022032	
J	Yang, Mei; Liu, Yijiang; Chen, Hongbiao; Yang, Duanguang; Li, Huaming								Porous N-Doped Carbon Prepared from Triazine-Based Polypyrrole Network: A Highly Efficient Metal-Free Catalyst for Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Alkaline Electrolytes								ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES				8	42			28615	28623		10.1021/acsami.6b09811				OCT 26 2016	2016	Metal-free N-doped carbon (NC) materials have been regarded as one of the most promising catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media because of their outstanding ORR catalytic activity, high stability, and good methanol tolerance. Up to now, only a small minority of such catalysts have been synthesized from triazine-based polymeric networks. Herein, we report the synthesis of such NC catalyst by directly pyrolyzing a nitrogen rich, triazine-based polypyrrole network (TPN). The TPN is fabricated by oxidative polymerization of 2,4,6-tripyrrol-1,3,5-triazine monomer using TfOH as the protonating agent and benzoyl peroxide as the oxidizing agent. The obtained NC-900 (pyrolyzed at 900 degrees C) catalyst exhibits excellent ORR activity in alkaline media with a high ORR onset potential (0.972 V vs RHE), a large kinetic-limiting current density (15.66 mA cm(-2) at 0.60 V), and good Me0H tolerance and durability. The as synthesized NC-900 material is a potential candidate as a highly active, stable, and low-cost ORR catalyst for alkaline fuel cells.									40	4	0	0	1	0	43			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000386540300040	27714991

Unraveling Evolution through Molecular Simulations								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY				133	31			12050	12062		10.1021/ja2017575				AUG 10 2011	2011	We here present a theoretical study of the alkaline hydrolysis of a phosphodiester (methyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate or MpNPP) in the active site of Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase (AP), a monoesterase that also presents promiscuous activity as a diesterase. The analysis of our simulations, carried out by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) potentials, shows that the reaction takes place through a D(N)A(N) or dissociative mechanism, the same mechanism employed by AP in the hydrolysis of monoesters. The promiscuous activity observed in this superfamily can be then explained on the basis of a conserved reaction mechanism. According to our simulations the specialization in the hydrolysis of phosphomonoesters or phosphodiesters, developed in different members of the superfamily, is a consequence of the interactions established between the protein and the oxygen atoms of the phosphate group and, in particular, with the oxygen atom that bears the additional alkyl group when the substrate is a diester. A water molecule, belonging to the coordination shell of the Mg2+ ion, and residue Lys328 seem to play decisive roles stabilizing a phosphomonoester substrate, but the latter contributes to increase the energy barrier for the hydrolysis of phosphodiesters. Then, mutations affecting the nature or positioning of Lys328 lead to an increased diesterase activity in AP. Finally, the capacity of this enzymatic family to catalyze the reaction of phospho esters having different leaving groups, or substrate promiscuity, is explained by the ability of the enzyme to stabilize different charge distributions in the leaving group using different interactions involving either one of the zinc centers or residues placed on the outer side of the catalytic site.									54	2	0	0	29	0	55			0002-7863			WOS:000293768400049	21609015	
J	Wei, Xiaodong; Hou, Guoliang; An, Yulong; Yang, Pan; Zhao, Xiaoqin; Zhou, Huidi; Chen, Jianmin								Effect of doping CeO2 and Sc2O3 on structure, thermal properties and sintering resistance of YSZ								CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL				47	5			6875	6883		10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.11.032		JAN 2021		MAR 1 2021	2021	6-8 wt% yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) has been widely employed as thermal barrier coating (TBC) to protect the high-temperature components of aero-engine and gas-turbine. However, the phase transition and sintering densification at high temperature seriously limit its application above 1200 degrees C. On account of this, CeO2 and Sc2O3 were doped into the YSZ by solid-state reaction sintering method in this paper. The effects of doping on the crystal structure, phase transition behavior and sintering resistance were investigated on the basis of XRD, Raman and FESEM, and the evolution of thermal properties of the ceramics was also analyzed. The results indicated that doped CeO2 increases the cell volume and tetragonal degree, but doped Sc2O3 was opposite. Co doping caused not only significant difference in atomic mass and radius but also the formation of a large number of oxygen vacancies in the ceramics. Therefore, CeScYSZ showed the lowest thermal conductivity (1.53 W-m(1)K(-1)), which was about 23% lower than that of YSZ (2.00 W-m(1)-K-1). More importantly, the oxygen vacancy also effectively stabilized the octet lattice, while the increase of lattice energy caused by Sc-O bond made it difficult for ions to misplace, which finally well prevented the transformation from t phase to m phase. There was no detrimental m-ZrO2 phase formation in the CeScYSZ after 120 h at 1500 degrees C. Besides, Co-doping could simultaneously overcome the poor sintering resistance caused by single CeO2 doping and the lower thermal expansion coefficient caused by single Sc2O3 doping, thus the CeScYSZ should be an ideal long-acting thermal protection material at higher temperatures.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000615135500003

A highly facile exchange of Sn(II) is found by using a low melting SnCl2/SnF2 peritectic flux, yielding mixed A-site (Ba1-xSnx)ZrO3 and mixed A- and B-site (Ba1-xSnx)(Zr1-yTiy)O-3 solid solutions that exhibit a very high metastability, with up to 60% Sn(II) cations and a calculated reaction energy for decomposition of up to -0.3 eV atom(-1). Kinetic stabilization of the higher Sn(II) concentrations is achieved by the high cohesive energy of the perovskite compositions containing Zr(IV) and mixed Zr(IV)/Ti(IV) cations. Significantly red-shifted bandgaps are found with increasing Sn(II) substitution, enabling the optical absorption edge to be broadly tuned from similar to 3.90 to similar to 1.95 eV. Percolation pathways are calculated to occur for BSZT compositions with >12.5% Sn(II) and >25% Ti(IV) cations. High photocatalytic rates are found for molecular oxygen production for compositions which exceed the percolation thresholds, wherein extended diffusion pathways should "open up" across the structure and the charge carriers become delocalized rather than trapped. These results establish the critical importance of synthetically accessing metastable semiconductors for the discovery of advanced optical and photocatalytic properties.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000526394000035

A popular strategy is engineering the size of electrocatalysts for better electrochemical performance and lower cost. Nanosized electrocatalysts with high specific surface area have been widely used in state-of-the-art electrochemical devices such as fuel cells. From an engineering aspect, nanosizing electrocatalysts increases the surface area of the electrode and improves the electrode/device performance. Beyond an engineering scope, this perspective highlights the size effects of certain scientific fundamentals in electrocatalytic reactions. The paper summarizes the representative examples in studying the size effects of electrocatalysts and sheds light on the change of intrinsic properties of electrocatalysts caused by the size variation. The size effects of electrocatalysts should be investigated in terms of both engineering and fundamental aspects; that is, the observed activity change is more than a result of surface area variation, and it is interesting to investigate the link between the intrinsic activity and the properties of the catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000819592000001	35704873

In the process, more environment-friendly power generation technologies have been developed utilizing fossil fuels with a view to timely commercialization. As one such "clean coal" technology, an Integrated Gasification Fuel Cell system is a promising power generation means where a carbonyl sulfide (COS) hydrolysis reactor is installed downstream of coal syngas to remove acidic gas constituents such as H2S and COS. The most significant design parameters affecting performance of the COS hydrolysis reactor were selected to be gas hourly space velocity (GHSV), reaction temperature, and length ratio, and numerical modeling was performed considering heat and fluid flow transfer as well as chemical reaction kinetics. Effect of the selected design parameters on the variation of conversion rate and reactant gas mixture concentration were comprehensively investigated to predict performance of the COS hydrolysis reactor. Stochastic modeling of reactor performance was finally performed using Monte Carlo simulation and linear regression fitting.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2076-3417		WOS:000441814300186

Hydrogen is produced by the reaction of zinc and water in a cell which consist of zinc powder as negative electrode and a hydrogen evolution cathode in form of a gas diffusion electrode. In comparison to a zinc air primary battery the KOH electrolyte contains additional water and the ingress of oxygen is prevented. Therefore, the large energy density of the zinc air battery can be maintained to a great extend while the life time of the system is considerably higher. This is achieved by complete separation of the cell from ambient air.Based on the material improvements of Zn powders and separation membranes demountable cells of 70 Ah capacity were designed and tested in combination with micro fuel cells. A control algorithm for the hydrogen generation rate were developed and tested, to achieve stable fuel cell performance at lowest possible hydrogen consumption.The system can be miniaturized and is well suited for mobile and portable power supplies.

By Thermal gravimetric (TG), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and SEM, the mass loss, microstructure, and surface morphology of carbon fibers were investigated. The mass loss of carbon fiber increases linearly with increasing oxidative ablated time under 500 and 600 degrees C. The carbon fiber with higher graphite degree shows higher oxidative resistance, and the surface roughness increases gradually because of chemical ablation during the whole oxidation. A gloss morphology appears on the surface primarily because of physical denudation for carbon fibers with lower graphite degree and then burn off according to carbon and oxygen reaction. The crystallite size (La) decreases significantly, while interlayer spacing(d(002)) remains nearly unchanged. SEM observation suggests the two kinds of ablation mechanisms for carbon fibers with different graphite degrees indicating that CC band in sp(3) hybridization prefers to be attacked by oxygen molecule more than that in sp(2) hybridization during oxidation ablation in air.

The material was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (p-XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis and its morphology was probed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Polymer 1 shows a surface area of 441.74 m(3) g(-1), while the discrete CoTcPP molecule (2) shows a surface area of 3.44 m(3) g(-1). The HER catalytic performance was evaluated by means of linear sweep voltammetry in the presence of 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution. To achieve 10 mA cm(-2) cathodic current density, 1 and 2 respectively require an overpotential of 0.475 V and 0.666 V, providing strong evidence that the extended network of cobalt-based porphyrin leads to enhanced HER efficiency. The polymer also shows great tolerance for HER electrolysis in the presence of an acid remaining active over 10 hours.									10	1	0	0	1	0	10			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000437317700037	29922804

Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was employed to introduce mutations into a segment of psbC that encodes the large extrinsic loop E of CP 43 in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803. Two mutations, R305S and R342S, each produced a strain with impaired photosystem II activity. The R305S mutant strain grew photoautotrophically at rates comparable to the control strain, Immunological analyses of a number of PSII components indicated that this mutant accumulated. normal quantities of PSII proteins. However, this mutant evolved oxygen to only 70% of control rates at saturating Tight intensifies. Measurements of total variable fluorescence yield indicated that this mutant assembled approximately 70% of the PSII centers found in the control strain. The R342S mutant failed to grow photoautotrophically and exhibited no capacity for oxygen evolution. However, when grown photoheterotrophically in medium containing both glucose and 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU), oxygen-evolving activity was observed in the R342S mutant, but at a low level of approximately 10% of the control rate. Immunological analysis of isolated thylakoid membranes from this mutant also indicated that this strain accumulated normal amounts of PSII core proteins. Total variable fluorescence yields for the R342S mutant indicated that it assembled a severely reduced number of fully functional PSII centers. R305S and R342S mutant strains exhibited, respectively, 2.7- and 4-fold increased sensitivity to photoinactivation. The fluorescence rise times for both mutants were comparable to the control when hydroxylamine was used as electron donor. However, both strains exhibited an increase (2.5- and 8-fold, respectively, for R305S and R342S) in fluorescence rise times with water as an electron donor. These results suggest that the mutations R305S and R342S each produce a defect associated with the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II. These are the first site-directed mutations in CP 43 to show such an effect.									38	0	0	0	28	0	38			0006-2960			WOS:000078836700023	9931025

The results reveal a complex structure of different phases at different stages of corrosion. The oxide/metal interface exhibits an intermediate layer, with an oxygen content between 45 and 55 O at.% and a suboxide layer corresponding to an oxygen-saturated solid solution in the metal matrix side (similar to 30 O at.%). Local variations are observed in the width of these characteristic structural features, especially near the transition. Good agreement on the layers present as well as their order, composition, and width was seen with the two techniques. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Hemodynamic changes evaluated with Doppler ultrasound have been used as a surrogate marker of fetal hypoxia. However, Doppler evaluation cannot be performed continuously. As a first step, the present work aimed to evaluate the performance of miniaturized electrochemical sensors in the continuous monitoring of oxygen and pH changes in a model of acute hypoxia-acidosis.MethodspH and oxygen electrochemical sensors were evaluated in a ventilatory hypoxia rabbit model. The ventilator hypoxia protocol included 3 differential phases: basal (100% FiO(2)), the hypoxia-acidosis period (10% FiO(2)) and recovery (100% FiO(2)). Sensors were tested in blood tissue (ex vivo sensing) and in muscular tissue (in vivo sensing). pH electrochemical and oxygen sensors were evaluated on the day of insertion (short-term evaluation) and pH electrochemical sensors were also tested after 5 days of insertion (long-term evaluation). pH and oxygen sensing were registered throughout the ventilatory hypoxia protocol (basal, hypoxia-acidosis, and recovery) and were compared with blood gas metabolites results from carotid artery catheterization (obtained with the EPOC blood analyzer). Finally, histological assessment was performed on the sensor insertion site. One-way ANOVA was used for the analysis of the evolution of acid-based metabolites and electrochemical sensor signaling results; a t-test was used for pre- and post-calibration analyses; and chi-square analyses for categorical variables.ResultsAt the short-term evaluation, both the pH and oxygen electrochemical sensors distinguished the basal and hypoxia-acidosis periods in both the in vivo and ex vivo sensing. However, only the ex vivo sensing detected the recovery period. In the long-term evaluation, the pH electrochemical sensor signal seemed to lose sensibility. Finally, histological assessment revealed no signs of alteration on the day of evaluation (short-term), whereas in the long-term evaluation a sub-acute inflammatory reaction adjacent to the implantation site was detected.ConclusionsMiniaturized electrochemical sensors represent a new generation of tools for the continuous monitoring of hypoxia-acidosis, which is especially indicated in high-risk pregnancies. Further studies including more tissue-compatible material would be required in order to improve long-term electrochemical sensing.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3				1479-5876		WOS:000617215200002	33541374

The dependence of the catalytic activity, selectivity, and corrosion resistance of these anodes with x mol % RuO2 + (30 - x) mol % IrO2 + 70 mol % TiO2 is studied in conditions of chlorine electrolysis on the ratio of concentrations of IrO2 and RuO2 in them at a constant loading of iridium in the coatings. It is established that the maximum corrosion resistance and selectivity is inherent in OIRTA with the RuO2 concentration close to 4 mol %. Partial curves, which describe the dependence of the rates of dissolution of iridium out of OIRTA and the evolution of chlorine and oxygen in them on the electrode potential, are obtained. The dependence of the rates of these processes on the solution pH, the concentration of NaCl in it, and the thickness of the active layer is studied. It is shown that the rate of dissolution of iridium out of OIRTA and the concentration of oxygen in chlorine at a constant potential increase approximately proportionally to the coating thickness, from whence it follows that the said processes proceed over the entire depth of the coating. An assumption is put forth that the chlorine evolution on OIRTA of the optimum composition, with a loading of iridium equal to 2.5 g m(-2), at high anodic currents occurs in an outer-kinetics regime in the presence of diffusion limitations on the removal of chlorine out of the coating's depth.									12	2	0	0	0	0	14			1023-1935			WOS:000232592900010

However, developing highly active and inexpensive electrocatalysts is an important part of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we present a multifaceted atom (sp(2)-and sp-hybridized boron) doping strategy to directly fine-modify the electronic structures of the active site and the HER performance by the density functional theory calculations. It is found that the binding strength between the Co atom and the B doped graphyne nanosheets can be enhanced by doping B atoms. Meanwhile, the Co@B-1-GY and Co@B-2-GY catalysts exhibit good thermodynamic stability and high HER catalytic activity. Interestingly, the Co@B-2-GY catalyst has an ideal HER performance with the Delta G(H center dot) value of -0.004 eV. Moreover, the d-band center of the Co atoms is upshifted by the sp(2)-or sp-hybridized B dopants. The concentrations of the sp-hybridized B atoms have a positive effect on the electrons transformation of the Co atoms. The interaction between the H and Co atoms becomes strong with the increase of the concentrations of the sp-hybridized B atoms and thus the corresponding catalysts show sluggish HER kinetics. This investigation could provide useful guidance for the experimental groups to directly and continuously control the catalytic activity towards HER by precisely doping multifaceted atoms.

Rietveld refinement of X-ray diffraction data was performed to analyse various parameters for its structure exploration. Microstructure and compositional information of prepared ceramic was determined by SEM, EDX and elemental mapping. The grain size was found 2.32 mu m with the use of ImageJ software on SEM images. The identical Raman mode were observed in present doped CCTO ceramics comparative to that reported for pure CCTO in Raman spectroscopy. The resistivity of prepared sample reveals NTC behaviour of the ceramic. The parameters; non-linear coefficient (alpha = 1.86), breakdown electric field (Eb = 191.56V/cm) and leakage current (I = 0.44 mA) were obtained by current voltage measurement at room temperature (RT~303K). The detail comparative study of various barrier models was carried out and found Schottky barriers as most suited model for potential barrier at grain boundaries in the present system.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0921-4526	1873-2135		WOS:000790019500002

The molten phase formed at 2520 degrees C contained tetrahedral VO42-, which plays a vital role in accelerating the SO3 uptake and conversion to SO2/O2. The present study aimed to reveal how the SO3 decomposition activity is affected by adding other oxoanions such as borate (BO33-), carbonate (CO32-), and phosphate (PO43-) into the melt. Although borate showed a deteriorating effect, phosphate tended to improve the catalytic activity when the P/V molar ratio was equal to or less than 0.5. The addition of phosphate produced a mixed phosphate vanadate with a composition of KV2PO8, which consists of infinite tetrahedral PO4 and pyramidal VO5 linked by vertex sharing. Because of the congruent melting at temperature as low as 3530 degrees C, KV2PO8 may be expected as another candidate of active molten phase catalyst for SO3 decomposition.

The process is redox mediated by the NiOOH/Ni(OH)(2) couple and starts as soon as NiOOH is formed on the surface. Depending on the applied potential, propenol oxidation takes place in parallel with water oxidation. The latter requires a higher surface concentration of NiOOH compared to propenol oxidation, indicating that a binuclear mechanism for oxygen evolution prevails at low overpotentials. The redox reaction of nickel oxide is markedly slower at the NiZn alloy than for solid Ni or pulse plated Ni, which also is reflected in the oxidation of water and propenol. Separation of all three oxidation currents (Ni(OH)(2), water and propenol) shows that pulse plated Ni is more efficient as catalyst than NiZn per NiOOH site, for both water and propenol oxidation. The role of Zn ions in the mixed NiZn hydroxide is discussed and a mechanism for propenol oxidation is suggested. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, through ab initio calculations, we systematically investigated the structural and electronic properties of small (Li2O2)(n)(m+) (n = 1, m = 0, 1 and n = 2, m = 0, 1, and 2) clusters and calculated the reaction energies of various decomposition reactions. Results show that the (Li2O2)(1) monomer has a low spin, whereas the (Li2O2)(2) dimer has a high spin. The analysis of bond length, molecular orbitals, and projected density of states reveals that the interaction of O-O is stronger in the cationic cluster than in the neutral one, whereas the interaction of O-Li is weaker in the cationic cluster than in the neutral one; this facilitates the decomposition of cationic lithium peroxide cluster. Furthermore, the calculated reaction energies indicate that the peroxide lithium decomposition preferentially favors two-step reaction over one-step reaction. Finally, the lowest-energy reaction pathway for the decomposition of (Li2O2)(2) dimer was predicted to be (Li2O2)(2) -> Li2O2 -> (Li2O2)(+) -> LiO2 -> O-2, and the rate-determining step was predicted to be the first step.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000487555400017	31475717	
J	Wang, Chao; Sui, Guozhe; Guo, Dongxuan; Li, Jinlong; Luo, Ze; Chai, Dong-Feng; Qi, Meili								A novel self-activation strategy for designing oxygen vacancies-rich nickel ferrite and cobalt ferrite microspheres with large specific surface area for overall water splitting								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				47	58			24343	24357		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.05.185				JUL 8 2022	2022	Nickel ferrite (NFO) and cobalt ferrite (CFO) have been explored as promising electro-catalysts for overall water splitting in virtue of unique characteristics. However, the poor intrinsic conductivity and the limited active sites of NFO and CFO give rise to sluggish charge transfer dynamics. It is the general approach that the target products implemented as shell are tightly wrapped on the sacrificial core of silicon dioxide (SiO2) to design the hollow/porous electrode materials, while employing SiO2 as sacrificial shell could be a novel method to improve the specific surface area (SSA) of NFO and CFO. Herein, the porous nickel ferrite (P-NFO (V-O)) and cobalt ferrite (P-CFO (VO)) microspheres with rich oxygen vacancies and enhanced SSA are reported through the novel self-activation treatment along with reduction process. The simultaneous formation of rich pore channels and oxygen vacancies could expose numerous active sites, optimize electronic configuration, and boost charge transfer. As expected, the elaborately designed P-NFO (V-O) and P-CFO (V-O) microspheres achieve excellent achievement for HER with low over-potentials (102.9 and 100.7 mV) and relatively small Tafel slopes (45.2 and 60.1 mV/dec), respectively. Beyond that, P-NFO (V-O) and P-CFO (V-O) microspheres deliver favorable overpotentials of 336.3 and 384.2 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) for OER, respectively, which is highly considerable to transition metal oxide-based electrocatalysts. Overall, the versatile strategy could be employed to construct other transition metal oxides with superior electrochemical properties. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Under drought stress, chlorophyll (Chl) content, Chl fluorescence, relative water content and oxygen evolution capacity gradually decreased, and the thylakoid structure was gradually damaged. Short-term drought stress caused a rapid disassembly of the light-harvesting complex II (LHCII). However, PSII dimers kept stable under the short-term drought stress and significantly decreased only after 15 days of drought stress. Immunoblotting analysis of the thylakoid membrane proteins showed that most of the photosystem proteins decreased after the stress, especially for Lhcb5, Lhcb6 and PsbQ proteins. However, surprisingly, PsbS significantly increased after the long-term drought stress, which is consistent with the substantially increased non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) after the stress. Our results suggest that the PSII-LHCII supercomplexes and LHCII assemblies play an important role in preventing photo-damages to PSII under drought stress.									88	5	1	0	63	0	93			0031-9317	1399-3054		WOS:000383574800008	26918860

Effects of Li+ on the formation of oxygen vacancies, change of lattice parameters and grain sizes were investigated. The disordered distribution of Li+ ions on B sites of BCZTL were found to give rise to the emergence of local random fields and facilitate the appearence of polar nanoregions (PNRs), which led to the relaxor behavior observed in dielectric measurements. The physical mechanisms for the influences of Li+ substitution and sintered temperature on the variation of PNRs, relaxor behavior and tunability were also proposed. Compared with other sintered temperatures, the 1300 degrees C sintered BCZTL sample exhibited relatively lower degree of relaxor behavior (gamma = 1.89) and higher tunability (k = 56%) owning to the smaller PNRs size.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000480558400026

The open challenge is to develop high performance catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and CO2 electroreduction (CO2ER) to valuable chemicals. Under such context, this work reported computational efforts to design promising electrocatalyst for HER and CO2ER based on the swarm-intelligence algorithm. Among the family of transition-metal phosphides (TMPs), Pt2P3 monolayer has been identified as excellent bifunctional catalysts due to high stability, excellent conductivity and superior catalytic performance. Different from typical d-block catalysts, p-band center presented by P atoms within Pt2P3 monolayer plays the essential role for its reactivity towards HER and CO2ER, underlining the key value of p-electrons in advanced catalyst design and thus providing a promising strategy to further develop novel catalysts made of p-block elements for various energy applications.

These modifications improved their photocatalytic activity for H-2 evolution and CO2 photo-reduction. Long K2Ti6O13 whiskers prepared by ultrasound assisted sol-gel method are the most active photocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction using pure water as reactant (U-SG, 10,065 mu mol g(-1)). In contrast, an opposite behavior was observed using a mixture of ethanol-water, where the highest activity was achieved by the shortest and less crystalline K2Ti6O13 whiskers (C-SG, 3,2871 mu mol g(-1)). In case of CO2 photo-reduction, long whiskers that were also prepared by the sono-chemical assisted sol-gel method were the most active to transform CO2 to formaldehyde, methane, methanol and hydrogen. The E-FB value of this catalyst is located very close to the potential for formaldehyde production and favors the selectivity to this organic product.

Fernandez-Perez el al., Room temperature sintering of polar ZnO nanosheets: I-evidence, 2017, DOI: 10.1039/ C7CP02306E), polar ZnO nanosheets were stored at room temperature under different atmospheres and the evolution of their textural and crystal properties during storage was followed. It was found that the specific surface area of the nanosheets drastically decreased during storage, with a loss of up to 75%. The ZnO crystals increased in size mainly through the partial merging of their polar surfaces at the expense of narrow mesoporosity, in a process triggered by the action of moisture, oxygen and, in their absence, by light. In the present work, a set of spectroscopic techniques (FTIR, Raman and XPS) has been used in an attempt to unravel the mechanism behind this spontaneous sintering process. The mechanism starts with the molecular adsorption of water, which takes place on Zn atoms close to oxygen vacancies on the (100) surface, where H2O dissociates to form two hydroxyl groups and to heal one oxygen vacancy. This process triggers the room temperature migration of Zn interstitials towards the outer surface of the polar region. What were previously interstitial Zn atoms now gradually occupy the mesopores, with interstitial oxygen being used to build up the O sublattice until total occupancy of the narrow mesoporosity is achieved.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000404530600014	28631791

The surface state of the electrodes varying with potential are investigated using cyclic voltammetry techniques combined with in situ Raman spectroscopy in 1 M KOH solution. As-deposited nickel hydroxide is electrooxidized to the oxides of higher state with Raman characteristic bands, 475 and 55 cm(-1), and the corresponding reaction is assigned to be a alpha-Ni-(OH)(2)/gamma-NiOOH redox reaction in the potential range between 350 and 500 mV. When the film is deactivated by voltammetric cycling, the phases, beta-Ni(OH)(2), and some untransformed alpha-Ni(OH)(2) are present. beta-Ni(OH)(2) will he electrooxidized to beta-NiOOH, which has Raman characteristic bands of 480 and 560 cm(-1) in the anodic sweep between 350 and 450 mV. The redox pair on the electroless Ni-P electrode is recognized as beta-Ni(OH)(2)/beta-NiOOH because of the identical Raman bands with beta-NiOOH, namely, 480 and 560 cm(-1) after being electrooxidized.									116	4	0	0	15	0	118			0743-7463			WOS:000072128400038		
J	PISTORIUS, EK								THE IDENTITY OF THE WATER OXIDIZING ENZYME IN PHOTOSYSTEM-II IS STILL CONTROVERSIAL								PHYSIOLOGIA PLANTARUM				87	4			624	631						APR 1993	1993	In recent years great advances in the understanding of photosystem II have been achieved. The process of photochemical charge separation seems to be fairly well understood, while the identity of the water oxidizing enzyme in photosystem II has remained uncertain. In the first part of the paper a brief review on structural and functional aspects of photosystem II is given, and in the second part the nature of the elusive water oxidizing enzyme is considered. Two models are discussed. The first model, favoured by the majority of groups working in this area, suggests that the reaction center polypeptide D1 (in association with other known photosystem II polypeptides) is the site of water oxidation. The second model, mainly based on our results with cyanobacteria, predicts that the water oxidizing enzyme is a separate polypeptide in the 30 kDa region, distinct from D1 and D2, in addition to the seven polypeptides so far recognized in minimal O2 evolving photosystem II complexes.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			0031-9317			WOS:A1993LG82500025

To express thermostable D1/D2 heterodimer in a cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, we constructed a series of mutant strains whose psbA1 and psbD1 genes encoding, respectively, the most highly expressed D1 and D2 polypeptides were replaced with those of a thermophilic strain, Thermosynechococcus vulcanus. Because the C-terminal 16 amino acid sequences of D1 polypeptides should be processed prior to maturation but diverge from each other, we also constructed the psbA1 AC replaced strain expressing a thermostable D1 polypeptide devoid of the C-terminal extension. The psbA1/psbD1-replaced strain showed decreased growth rate and oxygen evolution rate, suggesting inefficient photosystem II. Immunoblot analyses for thermostable D1, D2 polypeptides revealed that the heterologous D1 protein was absent in thylakoid membrane from any mutant strains with psbA1, psbA1 AC, and psbA1/psbD1-replacements, whereas the heterologous D2 protein was present in thylakoid membrane as well as purified photosystem II complex from the psbA1/psbD1-replaced strain. In the latter strain, the compensatory expression of psbA3 and psbD2 genes was elevated. These data suggest that heterologous D2 polypeptide could be combined with the host D1 polypeptide to form chimeric D1/D2 heterodimer, whereas heterologous D1 polypeptide even without the C-terminal extension was unable to make complex with the host D2 polypeptide. Since the heterologous D1 could not be detected even in the whole cells of psbA1/psbD1-replaced strain, the rapid degradation of unprocessed or unassembled heterologous D1 was implicated.

Three types of globins have been described so far: hemoglobin facilitates the transport of oxygen in the blood, myoglobin serves oxygen transport and storage in the muscle. and neuroglobin has a yet unidentified function in nerve cells. Here we report the identification of a fourth and novel type of globin in mouse, man, and zebrafish, It is expressed in apparently all types of human tissue and therefore has been called cytoglobin (CYGB). Mouse and human CYGBs comprise 190 amino acids, the zebrafish CYGB. 174 amino acids. The human CYGB gene is located on chromosome 17q25. The mammalian genes display a unique exon-intron pattern with an additional exon resulting in a C-terminal extension of the protein, which is absent in the fish CYGB. Phylogenetic analyses Suggest that the CYGBs had a common ancestor with vertebrate myoglobins. This indicates that the vertebrate myoglobins ire in fact a specialized intracellular globin that evolved in adaptation to the special needs of muscle cells.									422	34	2	0	382	1	461			0737-4038			WOS:000174967000005	11919282

XPS spectroscopy and the effects of ionic bombardment: Reduction of the thin layers of titanium dioxide elaborated by cathodic radio frequency sputtering								SILICATES INDUSTRIELS				71	9-10			173	180						SEP-OCT 2006	2006	Ion beam bombardment of surfaces has been used to determine the depth profiles of species in materials. Generally, when we are interested in binary components, ionic abrasion leads to an important change of the physical and chemical properties at altered surfaces of the treated material because the abrasion rates of these distinct elements are different. In the present work, we report on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study of the effects of argon ion bombardment on titanium dioxide (TiO2) thin films prepared by reactive cathodic radiofrequency sputtering. All deposits are grown on a crystalline silicon substrate at ambient temperature and the sputtering gas is a mixture of oxygen and argon with an overall pressure of 10(-2) mbar. The oxygen partial pressure ratio is 10%.Bombardment of the stoichiometric titanium dioxide layers by argon ions of 2keV kinetic energy, leads to the appearance of shoulders in the low bonding energy side of Ti2p(1/2-3/2) doublets. The intensifies of these shoulders increase with abrasion time and end by the disappearance of the double structure Ti2P(1/2-3/2). The latter is known to characterize the presence of titanium dioxide. The variation of oxygen to titanium atomic concentration ratio reveals that the film lost oxygen during abrasion.Deconvolution of XPS spectra of Ti2p obtained at different abrasion time reveals the formation of titanium suboxides: Ti2O3, TO and metallic titanium Ti at the altered layers surfaces. Evolution of the intensities ratios: I-Ti2O3/I-TiO2, I-Ti2O3/I-TiO, I-TiO/I-Ti2O3 and I-TiO/I-Ti with abrasion time shows that the reduction process follows the chain reaction TiO2 -> Ti2O3 -> TiO -> T. When the abrasion time increases, the relative proportions of the suboxides formed increase and tend to a constant values. The maximum thickness of the altered surface layer is 30 angstrom. This lower value is comparable to the penetration depth of argon ions into the titanium dioxide.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0037-5225			WOS:000243068100006

Silicon carbide (SiC) has drawn much attention due to its superior physical and chemical characteristics, and its performance under hyperthermal atomic oxygen (AO) impact, however, is still little known. This work investigates the effects of various SiC crystalline polytypes, surface temperature, and crystal orientations on the SiC interface evolution by hyperthermal AO collisions via the reactive molecular dynamics method. The results showed that SiC surface erosion is highly dependent on the temperature and the presence of different interfacial structures. In the range of 500-2000 K, the proceeding of the passive oxidation advances the amorphous SiO2/SiC interface and the formation of SixOy phase weakens the surface catalytic characteristics and mechanical properties. The presence of defects, such as dangling bonds at the gas-solid interface, caused by different surface orientations affects the anti-erosion capabilities of SiC significantly, which may limit its further wide applications.

Flash-induced variable fluorescence changes and thermoluminescence measurements were performed in wild type and Stm6 mutant cells during different stages of sulfur (S)-deprivation. Analysis of the fluorescence decay kinetics indicated that the forward electron transfer on the acceptor side of Photosystem II was dramatically slowed down during the O-2 evolution and O-2 consumption stages and was completely blocked in the anaerobic stage of S-deprivation, thus, indicating a complete reduction of the PQ-pool. During the H-2 formation stage, the forward electron transfer kinetics in the mu sec and msec time scale re-appeared indicating partially restored electron flow from Q(A)(-) to Q(B) and the PQ-pool. Thermoluminescese measurements fully confirmed the fluorescence kinetic analysis. Activation of hydrogenase in the H-2 formation stage is responsible for re-oxidation of the PQ pool and reactivation of the electron flow which was found to be faster and more efficient on the Stm6 mutant due to the higher amount of functionally preserved Photosystem II.

The microstructure and electrochemical properties of the different modified electrodes were investigated using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Mott-Schottky, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and linear sweep voltammetry techniques. The results show that adulteration of PEG has a noticeable improvement in the morphology of Bi-PbO2 electrode which can greatly decrease its particle size and enlarge its active surface area. Phenol degradation experiments reveal that the modified electrodes have excellent electro-catalytic activity and stability, and the optimal adulterate concentration of PEG is 8gL(-1). Electrochemical performance tests show that the modified electrodes exhibit more negative flatband potential (E-fb), larger adsorption pseudo capacitance, lower adsorption resistance and higher oxygen evolution potential, and these characteristics promote the electro-catalytic activity of the Bi-PbO2 electrode. Finally, accelerated lifetime tests demonstrate that PEG modification can highly lengthen the service life of Bi-PbO2 electrode in its practical application. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed model rigorously assesses lithium peroxide (Li2O2) formation and growth in an air electrode, and its complex interactions with electrochemical reactions and species/charge transport. We assume that the porous air electrode mainly consists of sphere-like carbon particles, and hence a spherical film growth model is adopted to simulate the precipitation of Li2O2 on the spherical carbon surfaces. The model is first validated against voltage evolution data measured at different discharging current densities. Good agreement between the simulation results and experimental data is achieved, demonstrating that the model accurately captures voltage decline behaviors due to accumulated Li2O2 in the air electrode. Additional simulations are carried out with different air electrode designs in order to establish the optimization strategy for the air electrode. Detailed simulation results, including multidimensional contours, clearly indicate that the electrode thickness and degree of electrolyte filling are key factors for improving the discharging performance of lithium-air batteries.

Recycling of oxidized materials such as carbonates from Earth's surface by subduction could explain the observed variations. Here we present high-pressure high-temperature multi-anvil experiments to determine the redox reactions between calcium-, magnesium-, or iron-carbonate and ferrous iron-bearing silicate mineral (garnet or fayalite) at conditions representative of subduction zones with intermediate thermal structures. We show that both garnet and fayalite can be oxidized to ferric iron-rich garnets accompanied by reduction of calcium carbonate to form graphite. The ferric iron content in the synthetic garnets increases with increasing pressure, and is correlated with the Ca content in the garnets. We suggest that recycled sedimentary calcium carbonate could influence the evolution of the mantle oxidation state by efficiently increasing the ferric iron content in the deep upper mantle. Calcium carbonate transported by subducting slabs could explain elevated ferric iron content in the upper mantle through redox reactions with iron-rich garnet and graphite as products, according to high-pressure, high-temperature experiments									4	3	0	0	0	0	6				2662-4435		WOS:000665753600002

Among all the preparing approaches, metal-organic framework (MOF) originated or related strategies have been recognized as one of the most promising methodologies for producing ADMCs with single-, dual-, triple- or quad-atom sites, because of the unique features of MOFs including well-defined and tailorable structures, large pore volumes and high surface areas. In this review, we outline the reported approaches for preparing MOF-based ADMCs with novel atomic configurations and discuss their advantages and limitations. Moreover, we stress the recent advances in the electrocatalysis by MOF-based ADMCs. Finally, this review presents some bottleneck problems and outlooks for the ulterior applications of MOF-based ADMCs in electrocatalysis for renewable energy-conversion and other reactions.

Herein, composite systems based on cobalt ferrite oxide-reduced graphene oxide (Co2FeO4)@(rGO) using simultaneous hydrothermal and chemical reduction methods have been prepared. The proposed study eliminates one step associated with the conversion of GO into rGO as it uses direct GO during the synthesis of cobalt ferrite oxide, consequently rGO based hybrid system is achieved in-situ significantly, the optimized Co2FeO4@rGO composite has revealed an outstanding multifunctional applications related to both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen counterpart (HER). Various metal oxidation states and oxygen vacancies at the surface of Co2FeO4@rGO composites guided the multifunctional surface properties. The optimized Co2FeO4@rGO composite presents excellent multifunctional properties with onset potential of 0.60 V for ORR, an overpotential of 240 mV at a 20 mAcm(-2) for OER and 320 mV at a 10 mAcm(-2) for HER respectively. Results revealed that these multifunctional properties of the optimized Co2FeO4@rGO composite are associated with high electrical conductivity, high density of active sites, crystal defects, oxygen vacancies, and favorable electronic structure arisinng from the substitution of Fe for Co atoms in binary spinel oxide phase. These surface features synergistically uplifted the electrocatalytic properties of Co2FeO4@rGO composites. The multifunctional properties of the Co2FeO4@rGO composite could be of high interest for its use in a wide range of applications in sustainable and renewable energy fields.

The aim of this study was to investigate ROS production over time in critically ill with sepsis patients and its correlation with outcome.METHODS: This was a pilot single-centre prospective, observational study of patients consecutively admitted to our 18-general ICU. Over a period of 6 months all the consecutive patients with recent-onset of severe sepsis or septic shock were enrolled. Clinical and demographic characteristics of all patients were recorded. ROMs (ROS metabolites), reduced sulfhydryl groups (SH) and plasmatic lactate levels were collected at enrollment in the study and then every 5-7 days over 28 days or until sepsis resolution or death during sepsis. ROMs were analysed spectrophotometrically by the d-ROMs test (Diacron-Italia). SH were assayed in plasma by Ellman's reaction by spectrophotometric method. Septic shock-related mortality was defined as death that occurred during the follow up period, when the signs of shock remained, and death could not be attributed to causes other than septic shock by the attending physician.RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were studied. The SOFA score and the plasmatic lactate levels significantly correlated with the ROMs plasmatic levels. The mortality rate was higher in patients whose ROMs plasmatic levels decreased during septic shock evolution.CONCLUSIONS: Serial measurements of the ROMs plasmatic levels together with the SOFA score and lactate levels could help to identify septic shock patients with a very high probability of death.									14	0	0	0	6	0	14			0375-9393	1827-1596		WOS:000392470200012	27611805

It is an efficient strategy to rationally architect amorphous/ crystalline hybrid nanostructures on the ZIFs-derived amorphous LDH counterparts. Herein, we provide a facile two-step method to fabricate crystalline Ag NPs decorated amorphous QLDHs (Ag/QLDHs) nanosheet arrays on the Ni foam through ions exchange and spontaneous redox reaction. Based on the multi-metal synergetic effects (Co, Zn, Fe, Ni) and regulation of Ag nanoparticles (NPs), the as-formed Ag/QLDHs with heterogeneously hi-erarchal structures exhibit excellent OER performance with a low overpotential of 216 and 247 mV under 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, respectively, together with highly structural robustness. Through using the in situ -Raman spectroscopy, we reveal that the Ag NPs play the important role in enhancing the oxidation state of Ni and Fe species in Ag/QLDHs, which facilitates the generation of active MOx(OH)y at a much lower potential. The synthesized approach proposed in this work will supply a promising pathway for constructing amorphous/ crystalline hybrid structures applied to alkaline water oxidation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000830245500004

Although various procedures have been employed to synthesize efficient metal/TiO2 catalysts, the promotional mechanisms for both reactions are still unclear due to the lack of well-defined systems. Here, we have deposited gold nanoparticles on a series of highly crystalline anatase TiO2 substrates with different crystallite sizes (7, 12, 16, 28 nm) by both direct precipitation and sol-immobilization methods to examine the effect of metal deposition methods and TiO2 sizes on both photo- and thermal catalytic glycerol reforming. For photocatalytic H-2 evolution from glycerol, optimum performance was observed for the Au supported on 12 nm TiO2 for both deposition methods. For thermal catalytic glycerol oxidation, all catalysts show a similar selectivity to glycerate (>70%) regardless of the TiO2 size and metal deposition method; however, the metal deposition method significantly influences the catalytic activity. In situ UV-vis spectrometry reveals that the optimized photocatalytic performance originates from enhanced charge transfer kinetics and a more negative Fermi level for proton reduction, whereas electrochemical analysis reveals that the promoted glycerol oxidation is caused by the enhanced oxygen reduction half-reaction.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000481568900053

The as-prepared composite is able to reduce CO2 exclusively to CO with a maximum Faraday efficiency of 60%, and no decay in the catalytic activity was observed even after 50 h of reaction. The enhanced catalytic activity towards CO2 reduction is attributed to the formation of active carbon-nitrogen bonds, high specific surface area, and improved material conductivity of the g-C3N4/MWCNT composite.									104	7	0	0	6	0	107			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000382925000015	27312815

For further understanding the regasification characteristics of oxidized lignite residues in coalfield fire, Shengli lignite was selected for conducting ultra-lean oxygen pre-oxidation under different isothermal temperatures and CO2 regasification experiments. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results indicate that higher temperature leads to the increase of aromatic hydrocarbon and reduction of aliphatic hydrocarbon side chains on the coal structure. It is found that the pre-oxidation of under 1% oxygen concentration and 300 degrees C will increase the specific surface area and pore volume, which would be beneficial for the following regasification. The analysis of gasification parameters suggests that the gasification quality and performance of lignite residues decline with the increasing oxygen concentration and rising isothermal temperatures in preoxidation. The kinetic analysis demonstrates that when the oxygen concentration ranges from 1% to 5%, the activation energy of gasification increases by 16.744 kJ/mol. The findings suggest that the lignite pre-oxidation under ultra-lean oxygen conditions will inevitably increase the activation energy of CO2 gasification, which causes the coal more difficult to be utilized effectively.

However, few reports provide sufficient annual hydrochemical and isotopic data to compare the variation characteristics and mechanisms with both atmospheric temperature and seismic effects. In this study, we used continuous delta H-2, delta O-18, and major ion data from four springs over 1 year to understand the groundwater origin, recharge sources, circulation characteristics, and coupling relationships with atmospheric temperature and earthquakes. We found that (1) atmospheric temperatures above and below 0 degrees C can cause significant changes in ion concentrations and water circulation depth, resulting in the mixing of fresh and old water in the aquifer, but it cannot cause changes in delta H-2 and delta O-18. (2) Earthquakes of magnitude >= 4.8 within a 66 km epicentral distance can alter fault zone characteristics (e.g., permeability) and aggravate water-rock reactions, resulting in significant changes in delta H-2, delta O-18, and hydrochemical ion concentrations. (3) Hydrogen and oxygen isotopes are the most sensitive precursory seismic indicators. The results of this study offer a reference for the establishment of long-term hydrochemical and isotopic monitoring, with the potential for use in earthquake forecasting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1660-4601		WOS:000866846500001	36231302

The coexistence of anatase and rutile were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the presence of oxygen vacancies reduce the value of the observed bandgap to 3.0 eV compared to the typical 3.2 eV TiO2, this reduction is concomitant with a partial phase,transition which is probably responsible for the increase in photoactivity. The experimental results with an initial concentration of ATZ (100 mu g L-1) show that more than 99% of ATZ oxidation was obtained after 30 min of treatment and reaction kinetic constant was about 0.146 min(-1). This good efficiency indicates that EPC process is an efficient, simple and green technique for degradation of pesticides such as ATZ in water. The analysis with liquid chromatography technique permits to identify, quantify and see the evolution of ATZ by-products which are generated by dechlorination, dealkylation and alkylic-oxidation mechanisms. Finally, the possible pathways of ATZ degradation by hydroxyl radicals were proposed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, primary g-C3N4 usually exhibits limited utilization of visible light and fast combination of photoexcited charge carriers, resulting in low photocatalytic H-2 evolution activity. Defect-modified g-C3N4 shows much enhanced photocatalytic H-2 evolution activity owing to extended light absorption as well as efficient charge separation and transfer. Here, the photocatalyst simultaneously containing nitrogen vacancies and O-doping is successfully developed by using a two-step post-synthetic strategy for photocatalytic H-2 evolution, resulting in a greatly-boosted H-2 evolution activity (1.69 x 10(3) mol g(-1) h(-1)) compared with that of pristine g-C3N4 (1.12 x 10(2) mol g(-1) h(-1)). It is believed that the newly developed double-defect strategy may open an avenue toward obtaining molecular level comprehension of the function of a catalyst in photocatalytic H-2 evolution and can be extended to the modification of other semiconductors.									21	2	0	0	2	0	21			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000436571800062	29911711

Detailed understanding on failure mechanisms and key optimization knowledge of fluorinated-DRX (F-DRX), however, are lacking. In the present study, we incorporate different amounts of F into a baseline DRX system, Li1.2Ti0.4Mn0.4O2 (LTMO3.0, 3.0 denotes nominal Li/Mn ratio), and synthesize two oxyfluoride compounds, Li-rich Li1.3Ti0.3Mn0.4O1.7F0.3 (LTMOF3.25) and Mn-rich Li1.2Ti0.2Mn0.6O1.8F0.2 (LTMOF2.0) with an increased and reduced Li/Mn ratio of 3.25 and 2.0, respectively. Through careful monitoring of chemical and structural evolution, we show that cycling-induced changes are manifested not only by Mn reduction and degradation of its local coordination environment, but also by F enrichment and formation of LiF-type of domains on the surface. A "concerted-densification" based failure mechanism, involving atomic-level changes in both transition-metal cationic sublattice and oxygen/fluorine anionic sublattice, is proposed for the degradation in F-DRX cathode materials. The study reveals that increasing F content accompanied by reduced Li/Mn ratio mitigates the degradation process, offering key design strategies in achieving balanced cathode capacity and stability.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000635284900046		
J	Jiang, Jingwen; Wang, Xiaofeng; Xu, Qijun; Mei, Zhiyuan; Duan, Lingyan; Guo, Hong								Understanding dual-vacancy heterojunction for boosting photocatalytic CO2 reduction with highly selective conversion to CH4								APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL				316						121679	10.1016/j.apcatb.2022.121679				NOV 5 2022	2022	The selective reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) as the primary component of greenhouse gas, remains a significant challenge in photocatalysis. Here, we present a novel strategy of preparing highly selective and stable heterostructure photocatalysts, which simultaneously contain oxygen and nitrogen vacancies. Synergistic catalysis effect originated from Nb2O5 with oxygen vacancies and nitrogen-rich vacancies of metal-free catalytic (g-C3N4) substrate leads to excellent photocatalytic reduction performances. The as-prepared photocatalysts exhibit outstanding capacity of selective reduction of CO2 with yields of CH4 16.07 mu mol g(-1) and CO 0.89 mu mol g(-1) after 5 cycles. Furthermore, the CO2 reduction mechanism is confirmed through density functional theory (DFT) calculation and in-situ technology in detailing. This indicates that the heterojunction surface has a lower free energy barrier for CO2 reduction compared with the pristine sample surface. This new strategy may exploit a vital application of dual-vacancy heterostructure in environmental catalysis.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000841427900002

However, it is challenging to reverse-engineer the working mechanism of brain function and behavior through the evolving functional neuroimages. In this work, we conceptualize that the ensemble of evolving neuronal synapses forms a dynamic system of functional connectivity, where the system behavior (aka. Brain state) of such a reaction-diffusion process can be formulated by a set of trainable PDEs (partial differential equations). To that end, we first introduce a PDE-based reaction-diffusion model (RDM) to jointly characterize the propagation of brain states throughout the functional brain network as well as the non-linear interaction between brain state and neural activity manifested in the BOLD (blood-oxygen-level-dependent) signals. Next, we translate the diffusion and reaction processes formulated in the PDE into a graph neural network, where the driving force is to establish the mapping from the evolution of brain states to the known cognitive tasks. By doing so, the layer-by-layer learning scenario allows us to not only fine-tune the RDM model for predicting cognitive tasks but also explain how brain functions support cognitive status with a great neuroscience insight. We have evaluated our proof-of-concept approach on both simulated data and functional neuroimages from HCP (Human Connectome Project) database. Since our neuro-RDM combines the power of deep learning and insight of dynamic systems, our method has significantly improved recognition performance in terms of accuracy and robustness to the non-neuronal noise, compared with the conventional deep learning models.					25th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI)25th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI)	SEP 18-22, 2022SEP 18-22, 2022	MICCAI SocMICCAI Soc	Singapore, SINGAPORESingapore, SINGAPORE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0302-9743	1611-3349	978-3-031-16452-1; 978-3-031-16451-4	WOS:000867418200035

As the state-of-the-art ORR electrocatalysts, Pt-based electrocatalysts suffer from high price, low earth abundance and poor stability. Developing high performance noble-metal-free ORR electrocatalysts as alternatives for Pt is highly desirable but still remains a significant challenge. In this work, we reported a metal-organic-framework- engaged strategy for the fabrication of cobalt-tipped carbon nanotube/Ti3C2 nanosheet composites (Co-CNT/Ti3C2), in which ZIF-67 particles were in situ grown on Ti3C2 nanosheets and then were converted to cobalt-tipped carbon nanotubes through a pyrolysis process. The Ti3C2 nanosheets not only served as two-dimensional conductive scaffolds for the growth of Co-CNTs but also balanced the tradeoff between graphitization of carbon and the surface area. Benefiting from the abundant Co-N/C active sites, reasonably high graphitization of carbon and suitable surface areas, the optimized Co-CNT/Ti3C2 manifested comparable ORR activity (half-wave potential of 0.82 V and diffusion-limiting current density of 5.55 mA cm(-2)) but superior stability to commercial Pt/C (half-wave potential of 0.82 V and diffusion-limiting current density of 5.30 mA cm(-2)), providing great opportunity for its application in renewable conversion and storage technologies.									111	13	0	0	2	0	111			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000457268300042		
J	Li, Yi; Xie, Shiwei; Yao, Jiaxiong								Singlet oxygen generation for selective oxidation of emerging pollutants in a flow-by electrochemical system based on natural air diffusion cathode.								Environmental science and pollution research international											10.1007/s11356-022-23364-3				2022-Oct-06	2022	The decay of free radicals involved in side reactions is one of the challenges faced by electrochemical degradation of organic pollutants. To this end, a non-radical oxidation system was constructed by a natural air diffusion cathode (ADC) and a Ti-based dimensional stable anode coated by RuO2 (RuO2-Ti anode) for cathodic hydrogen peroxide activation by anodic chlorine evolution. The ADC fabricated by the carbon black of BP2000 produced a stable concentration of hydrogen peroxide of 339.94mg L-1 (current efficiency of 73.4%) without aeration, which was superior to the cathode made by the XC72 carbon black. The flow-by ADC-RuO2 system consisted of an ADC and a RuO2-Ti anode showed high selectivity to aniline (AN) compared to benzoate (BA) in a NaCl electrolyte, whose degradation efficiencies were 97.72% and 1.3%, respectively. Rapid degradations of a mixture of emerging pollutants and AN were also observed in the ADC-RuO2 system, with pseudo-first-order kinetic constants of 0.51, 1.29, 0.89, and 0.99min-1 for Bisphenol A (BPA), tetracycline (TC), sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and AN, respectively. Quenching experiments revealed the main reactive oxygen species for the pollutant degradation was singlet oxygen (1O2), which was also identified by the electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis. Finally, the steady-stable content of 1O2 was quantitatively determined to be 6.25*10-11M by the method of furfuryl alcohol (FFA) probe. Our findings provide a fast, low energy consumption and well controlled electrochemical oxidation method for selective degradation of organic pollutants. H2O2 generated on an air diffusion cathode by naturally diffused O2, reacts with ClO- produced from chloride oxidation on the RuO2-Ti anode to form singlet oxygen (1O2). The electrochemical system shows an efficient oxidation to electron-rich emerging pollutants including bisphenol A, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole and aniline, but a poor performance on the electron-deficient compounds (e.g., benzoate).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1614-7499		MEDLINE:36201074	36201074

In addition to various well-known applications, such as solar cells, light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, and resistive switching memories, HPs can be utilized as efficient photocatalysts for numerous electrochemical reactions, including carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reactions, hydrogen evolution reaction, photosynthesis, and wastewater treatment. However, the use of HPs toward photo-driven catalysis remains a tremendous challenge owing to their poor stability in polar solvents. Nevertheless, huge progress has been made to counter this critical issue for improving the performance of HPs as efficient photocatalysts in a wide range of applications. In this review, we first introduce the structures and properties of HPs. Next, we highlight the recent approaches on the fabrication of HPs, including thin films and nanostructures. Strategies for implementing HPs in catalysis systems and their working mechanisms are thoroughly summarized and discussed. Lastly, the current challenges and prospects of the application of HPs toward photocatalytic reactions are fully addressed.

Herein, we describe the rational design and synthesis of nitrogen/sulfur-codoped porous graphene networks (N, S-PGN) as a highly efficient ORR catalyst. Assisted by supramolecular polymerization, petroleum coke, a byproduct produced by the oil refinery industry in million tons every year, can be converted into N/S-codoped graphene nanosheets with a highly porous architecture. Such a hierarchical and doped structure favors the exposure of the active sites and facilitates electron transport. As a result, N, S-PGN exhibits a remarkable electrocatalytic activity for the ORR and, in particular, outperforms the Pt/C electrode in terms of a superior diffusion-limiting current density and stability when operated under the same conditions. Furthermore, the increased number of carbon active sites and enhanced electron transport were confirmed by theoretical calculations. It was found that codoping porous graphene increases the charge density on the carbon active sites and increases the HOMO energy, thus favoring the ORR. The present study demonstrates a novel and feasible route for preparing heteroatom-codoped porous graphene for energy applications as well as a new strategy for the value-added utilization of petroleum coke.									47	5	0	0	1	0	48			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000402734600064

The main industrial process for the production of NH3 is the Haber-Bosch process, which requires a large amount of energy as a result of the use of high temperatures and pressures, making it costly, inefficient, and environmentally unfriendly. Because of the growing demand for NH3 in industry and agriculture, the development of alternative technologies, especially those having low energy consumption and producing little pollution, is urgently required. The electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is an example of such a reaction. However, the efficiency of the NRR is limited by the high N N bond strength and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Therefore, current implementations of the NRR are not suitable for industrialization. To enable the use of the NRR in an industrial setting, high-performance electrocatalysts are required. In this study, density functional theory calculations were used to investigate the performance of NRR electrocatalysts based on the transition metal doped Ir(100) surface to yield two-atom active sites (TM2@Ir(100)) from an energetic perspective. Mn-2@Ir(100) and Fe-2@Ir(100) were determined to have high catalytic activities for the NRR based on the screening of the adsorption energies and activation of N-2, formation of adsorbed N2H, desorption of adsorbed NH3, and HER inhibition. Finally, using these two catalysts, the energetics of the whole NRR pathway were calculated. The key findings are that the para-doped Mn-2@Ir(100) catalyst affords excellent NH3 selectivity and NRR activity with an extremely low free energy barrier of 0.36 eV.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000814249800001

Our results support the adsorption of only completely dissociated or atomic species whatever T(S) between room temperature and 1100 K. The respective oxygen and nitrogen uptakes, given as a function of pressure and T(S), are compared. For oxygen, a critical temperature T(c)O (pressure P(c)O) for a given pressure P(c)O (temperature T(c)O) separates the desorption or combustion mode from the passivating one, very similar to the oxidation by 02. For nitrogen, similar evolutions with T(S) and pressure are evidenced only above 750 K, when oxygen desorption occurs. Below 750 K, oxidation prevails over nitrogen chemisorption with a nitrogen coverage limited to a fraction of a monolayer whatever the pressure. Above 750 K the nitrogen chemisorption rate is enhanced so that the T(S) range comprised between 750 K and T(c)O defines an oxynitridation stage where both substantial oxygen and nitrogen coverages are found. Above T(c)O, nearly pure nitridation is enabled by oxygen etching. In conjunction with coverage measurements, angle-resolved XPS was used to probe the in-depth distribution of the chemisorbed atoms in the T(S) range above 750 K. From the comparison of the 0 ls and N ls intensities it is concluded that the initial oxynitride occurs with the formation of nitrogen pile-up at the Si/Si-oxide interface.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0169-4332			WOS:A1993MK12300018

Apart from the traditional Au and Ag based plasmonic photocatalysts, more recently the noble-metal-free alternative plasmonic materials have attracted ever-increasing interest. Here we report the first use of plasmonic zirconium nitride (ZrN) nanoparticles as a promising photocatalyst for water splitting. Highly crystalline ZrN nanoparticles with sizes dominating at 30-50 nm were synthesized that exhibit intense visible and near-infrared absorption due to localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). Without utilizing any noble metal cocatalysts such as Pt, the plasmonic ZrN nanoparticles alone showed stable photocatalytic activity for H-2 evolution in aqueous solution with methanol as sacrificial electron donor. The addition of a cobalt oxide (CoOx) cocatalyst can facilitate the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and further improve the photocatalytic activity. The optimized CoOx modified ZrN photocatalyst was observed not only to activate the O-2 evolution reaction with presence of electron acceptor, but also to drive overall water splitting for the simultaneous H-2 and O-2 evolution in the absence of any sacrificial agents.

To address these challenges, we herein fabricated NiCo2S4 supported on reduced graphene oxide (NiCo2S4@rGO), the surface of which is further modified via a unique low-pressure capacitive-coupled nitrogen plasma (CCPN-NiCo2S4@rGO). The high ionization environment of the plasma could etch the surface of NiCo2S4@ rGO, introducing effective nitrogen doping. The as-prepared CCPN-NiCo2S4@ rGO has been employed as an efficient catalyst for advanced LOBs. The electrochemical analysis, combined with theoretical calculations, reveals that the N-doping can effectively improve the thermodynamics and kinetics for LiO2 adsorption, giving rise to a well-knit Li2O2 formation on CCPN-NiCo2S4@rGO. The LOBs based on the CCPN-NiCo2S4@rGO oxygen electrode deliver a low overpotential of 0.75 V, a high discharge capacity of 10,490 mA h g-1, and an improved cyclic stability (more than 110 cycles). This contribution may pave a promising avenue for facile surface engineering of the electrocatalyst in LOBs and other energy storage systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000844650000001	35938575

Moreover, the search for active photocatalysts that efficiently oxidize water remains a challenging task. Here, we demonstrate that a series of Ag3PO4/Ag/graphene/graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) heterostructured materials can drive photocatalytic water oxidation efficiently under LED illumination. The water oxidation behavior of as-prepared composite photocatalysts in relation to the added amount of g-C3N4 and the roles of electron mediators was investigated in detail. Based on the illuminated Z-scheme photocatalytic mechanism, the photogenerated electrons and holes can be separated effectively and the electron-hole recombination of bulk material is suppressed. The reduced metallic Ag nanoparticles were found to function as the center for the accumulation of electrons from Ag3PO4 and holes from g-C3N4. By exploiting the proper addition of g-C3N4 into the composite, photocatalytic oxygen evolution performance over the heterostructured materials could be suitably tuned, which resulted in highly efficient water oxidation.

The potential for using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to study complex responses by non-model organisms to the environment is evident in a rapidly growing body of literature. This is particularly true of fishes for which research has been motivated by their ecological importance, socioeconomic value, and increased use as model species for medical and genetic research. Here, we review studies that have used RNA-seq to study transcriptomic responses to continuous abiotic variables to which fishes have likely evolved a response and that are predicted to be affected by climate change (e.g., salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, and pH). Field and laboratory experiments demonstrate the potential for individuals to respond plastically to short-and long-term environmental stress and reveal molecular mechanisms underlying developmental and transgenerational plasticity, as well as adaptation to different environmental regimes. We discuss experimental, analytical, and conceptual issues that have arisen from this work and suggest avenues for future study.									35	0	0	0	33	1	35			2371-1671			WOS:000409859900001

Two types of experiments were conducted. In one type the potential was induced to travel from low to high values by applying a large constant current Results. on the time of passage show the reaction process is more efficient with mixtures of the inorganic acids than with only H2SO4 or HClO4 in the supporting electrolyte. Oscillations accompanying the potential evolution reveal the rate of formation of species that inhibit reaction is less when mixtures of acids are used. In the second type of experiment, the applied current took the form of a staircase function. The current at each step was held at its constant value for no less than 15 min. It was found that the range of stability for behaviors seen with only H2SO4 or HClO4 in the supporting electrolyte is considerably shorter than the stability range of a behavior obtained using mixtures of the two acids.

The 3D-HBGP was utilized as the support catalyst for platinum-cobalt (Pt-Co) that was electrochemically deposited on its surface for methanol oxidation reaction. Electrochemical measurements illustrates that the peak current density of 3D-HBGP/Pt/Co is 22.53 mA/cm(2), which is 2.48 higher than Pt-Co alloy without 3D-HBGP support. According to this observation, the electro-catalytic activity of 3D-HBGP/Pt/Co is higher than that of Pt-Co electrocatalyst for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). Compared to Pt-Co electrocatalyst, the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of 3D-HBGP/Pt/Co increases to 20.38 m(2)/g during cyclic voltammetry (CV) test. In addition, multi-scan cyclic voltammetry indicates that the 3D-HBGP/Pt/Co electrocatalyst has great catalytic stability for MOR. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation results reveal that utilizing the 3D-HBGP structure alongside Pt and Co leads to decreasing of the energy gap and increasing of the reactivity of catalyst which is in good agreement with experimental findings. The current study results (performance and stability) illustrate that the fabricated 3D-HBGP/Pt/Co electrocatalyst can be a prospective anode catalyst for direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC).

This interaction is mediated not just through geochemistry but also via biology. Infauna vigorously mix sediment particles, enhance porewater-seawater exchange, and consequently, facilitate chemical reactions. In turn, the ecology and activity of benthic fauna are impacted by their environment, amplifying the sensitivity of seawater-sediment interaction to environmental change. However, numerical representation of the bioturbation of sediment has often been treated simply as an enhanced diffusion of solutes and solids. Whilst reasonably successful in representing the mixing of bulk and predominantly oxic marine sediments, the diffusional approach to bioturbation is limited by a lack of environmental sensitivity. To better capture the mechanics and effects of sediment bioturbation, we extend a published bioturbation model (Lattice-Automaton Bioturbation Simulator; LABS) by adopting a novel method to simulate realistic infaunal behavior that drives sediment mixing. In this new model (extended LABS - eLABS), simulated benthic organism action is combined with a deterministic calculation of water flow and oxygen and organic matter concentration fields to better reflect the physicochemical evolution of sediment in response to bioturbation. The predicted burrow geometry and mixing intensity thus attain a dependence on physicochemical sedimentary conditions. This interplay between biology, chemistry, and physics is important to mechanistically explain empirical observations of bioturbation and to account for the impact of environmental changes. As an illustrative example, we show how higher organic rain can drive more intense sediment mixing by "lur-ing" benthic organisms deeper into sediments, while lower ambient dissolved oxygen restricts the oxic habitat depth and hence tends to reduce bulk mixing rates. Our model, with its oxygen and food availability controls, is a new tool to interpret the trace fossil record, e.g., burrows, as well as to explore biological engineering of past marine environments.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1991-959X	1991-9603		WOS:000492831500002

However, low specific surface area and fast electrons and holes recombination restrict the photocatalytic applications of CN material. Herein, a nitrogen defect-rich and highly porous CN nanostructure (CN-LT) was prepared by combining two strategies, i.e., LiOH treatment and heat etching. The as-prepared nitrogen defect-rich porous CN-LT not only has a larger specific surface area, as compared with pristine CN, but also the photogenerated electron-hole separation was boosted remarkably. Using Pt as a co-catalyst and lactic acid aqueous solutions as sacrificial reagent under visible light irradiation (lambda > 400 nm), the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) rate for CN-LT (1.54 mmol h(-1) g(-1)) was 19.25 times higher than that for pristine CN (0.08 mmol h(-1) g(-1)). While subjecting pristine CN to heat etching under the same experimental conditions, excepting the use of LiOH (CN-T), an increase in HER rate of 7.5 times was obtained. Our current study may shed more light on the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of bulk CN materials by altering their microstructure. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The fabricated catalysts were characterized by XRD, EDS, SEM, and TEM. From TEM micrographs, Ni/NiO with the particle size in the range of 20-30 nm was synthesized and uniformly embedded on MWCNTs with a diameter of 10-40 nm. It was found from the EIS results that the Ni/NiO/MWCNT has a lower charge transfer resistance than Ni/NiO, indicating a faster electron transfer from the Ni/NiO/MWCNT to methanol and faster reaction kinetics. The Ni/NiO/MWCNT catalyst showed a maximum peak current density of 15.94 mA cm(-2) (49.81 mA mg(-1)) in peak potential of 0.43 mV (at room temperature) and long-term stability, showing good electrocatalytic activity.

Herein, we demonstrate the tailoring of bimetallic copper-palladium (Cu-Pd) nanoalloys with different morphologies and compositions for obtaining highly efficient electrocatalysts for the reduction of CO2 to CO. We further evaluate the catalytic performance of these Cu-Pd nanomaterials for the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to CO. In particular, the spherical Cu-Pd nanoalloys with Cu/Pd molar ratio of 1/0.3 have the highest Faradaic efficiency for CO conversion (93%), while the dendritic Cu-Pd nanoalloys have the highest Faradaic efficiency for H-2 production (65.2%) via hydrogen evolution reaction at a polarized potential of -0.87 V. The balancing of the rate-determining steps during CO2 conversion is a key factor for the observed activity/selectivity of Cu-Pd nanoalloys with different morphologies/compositions. The findings revealed in this study may shed some light on the design of cost-effective and efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 conversion to CO or to other useful hydrocarbons.									52	6	0	0	1	0	52			2574-0962			WOS:000458705100081

Time-resolved Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and quadrupole mass spectrometry with ionization by electronic impact have been used to measure the temporal evolution of the concentrations of the stable species present in the discharge N2O, N-2, O-2, NO, and NO2. A model based on a reduced set of kinetic equations gives a global account of the measured data; this model takes into account all the mechanisms considered in a former work (Arcos, T. et al. J. Phys. Chern. A 1998, 102, 6282) to explain the steady state of a continuous N2O discharge but includes also additional mechanisms to which transient phenomena have proven to be much more sensitive than the stationary results. In particular, excitation of some vibrational levels of N2O and homogeneous reactions of vibrationally excited species, as well as electron impact dissociation of the stable products of the discharge are considered. On the other hand, the partial formation of NO2 by an heterogeneous reaction previously proposed seems to be confirmed.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000086872800016

In addition to the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond two different nucleophilic groups are incorporated with complete chemio-, regio- and high (>90%) stereoselectivity. The NMR and X-Ray structure analysis of a sigma-pi-palladium-bipyridine complex clearly establishes the stereochemistry of the prerogative intermediate and the position of the coordinated vinyl group in an 'extracyclic' position before the insertion-cyclisation step. This stereochemistry establishes the oxidative cleavage of the cyclised (cis-insertion) organopalladium intermediate to proceed with predominant (90%) inversion of configuration. A further ring opening reaction via Baeyer-Villiger oxidation has been developed showing the usefullness of the brendane derivatives far an easy access to functionalized quinane system(s) with complete stereocontrol of 5 stereogenic centers.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0040-4020			WOS:A1994MR16000021

The surface electronic states of copper in CuS nanocrystal catalysts were modified by iron doping through a simple wet-chemical method. The iron-doped CuS catalysts displayed drastically enhanced catalytic activities for overall water electrolysis in the strong alkaline electrolyte of 1 M KOH after a simple cyclic voltammetry activation. The optimized catalytic performance for overall water electrolysis was achieved in the CuFe0.6S1.6 catalyst, which exhibited a low overpotential of -237 mV for HER and 302 mV for OER to reach 10 mA cm(-2). The high activities for overall water electrolysis in CuFe0.6S1.6 were induced by the enhanced charge transfer from Cu to S via iron doping, which not only modified the surface electronic state of copper but also enhanced charge transfer during the electrochemical reactions. Moreover, the catalysts displayed satisfying stability for over 20 h at a high current density of 300 mA cm(-2) for both HER and OER, showing great potential for industrial water electrolysis.

J	ASHWORTH, JR								FLUID-ABSENT DIFFUSION KINETICS OF AL INFERRED FROM RETROGRADE METAMORPHIC CORONAS								AMERICAN MINERALOGIST				78	3-4			331	337						MAR-APR 1993	1993	Estimates are obtained for diffusion coefficients of Al through polycrystalline hornblende layers during retrograde metamorphism using petrological studies of two types of coronas, with geologically based estimates of time scale. The observations indicate a combination of fluid-absent grain-boundary diffusion and intracrystalline diffusion in the presence of composition gradients whose magnitude for Al is constrained by mineral analyses. Corona growth is linked to diffusion by the results of steady-state modeling of the diffusion-controlled reaction. The estimated effective (bulk) diffusion coefficient D(Al)eff is 10(-24+/-2) m2/s, leading to a maximum estimate for the product of grain-boundary diffusion coefficient D(Al)gb and grain-boundary width, delta, of 10(-29+/-2) m3/s. In comparison with data in the literature, D(Al)eff is greater (by up to a few orders of magnitude) than intracrystalline Al diffusion coefficients (extrapolated from high-temperature experiments), as expected where grain-boundary diffusion is important. However, D(Al)eff is smaller than would be expected if grain boundaries had high contents of dissolved H2O. The results are consistent with H2O concentration being an important kinetic control on retrograde reaction.									29	1	0	0	0	0	29			0003-004X			WOS:A1993KY02300010

An existing theoretical framework conceived initially for the analysis of a counter-flow diffusion flame established above the surface of a condensed fuel is extended for charring materials to deliver a fundamental understanding of the self-extinction of timber. This study shows that the energy balance at the burning surface is influenced primarily by the magnitude of external heating conditions, which directly influences the evolution of bulk properties such as flame temperature, location, and stagnation plane position. Variations in the oxygen content had a lesser influence over these bulk properties. For all investigated conditions, the limits of the strain rate range where a flame can be sustained were shown to vary substantially, and critical Damkohler number (Da) analyses were conducted. Blow-off at high strain rates (low Da) occurs for all investigated conditions. The value of this critical Da decreases when increasing either the magnitude of the external heating or the oxygen content as flame temperature increases. Quenching at low strain rates (high Da) is only found for sufficiently low magnitudes of external heating. There, the associated critical Da increases when increasing either the external heating or the oxygen content. Above a certain degree of external heating, the flame can be theoretically sustained even at infinitely-low strain rates. By comparing these results to experimental data, the experimental critical Da at quenching was found to behave like the theoretical results but with a lower sensitivity to variations in the parameters studied. To account for this discrepancy, a fuel dilution parameter is introduced to incorporate the complex dependencies of timber decomposition and surface reactions not captured by the theoretical framework.

The formation of hybrid structure is characterized using X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy, which confirmed as well as showed the uniform growth of NiMn-LDH layers on LSTN nanoparticles.

The capacity of LSTN@NiMn-LDH was found to be 485 mAh/g (1745 C/g) at 1 A/g, with 86% capacitive retention after 10,000 cycles at 2 A/g. The improved electrochemical performance of the LSTN@NiMn-LDH electrode could be ascribed to rapid diffusion pathways provided by LSTN and improved redox reactions of NiMn-LDH nanosheets owing to the high surface area.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0257-8972	1879-3347		WOS:000681716300030

Time-dependent conservation equations of mass, species, and energy are integrated numerically to investigate the details of flame structure and calculate the flame speed. Kinetic sensitivity analysis of the burning velocity is used to elucidate the importance of individual elementary reactions at various pressures. Laminar flame propagation in stoichiometric mixtures heavily diluted with steam is investigated near the flammability limit through numerical simulation of the evolution of the spherical flame kernel initiated by a spatially: localized ignition source. Critical conditions for flame propagation are analyzed in terms of ignition energy and flame kernel radius. The effect of pressure on these critical conditions is revealed and investigated. The predicted ignition energy and limiting hydrogen concentration nonmonotonically depend on pressure. The computed results are in reasonable agreement with available experimental data on flammability limits.					26th International Symposium on Combustion26th International Symposium on Combustion	JUL 28-AUG 02, 1996JUL 28-AUG 02, 1996	Combust Inst; ALCOA Tech Ctr; Arthur D Little Inc; Chevron Res & Technol Co; Chevron Chem Co; CONSOL Inc; E I du Pont de Nemours & Co; Elect Power Res Inst; Engn Managements Consultants; EXXON Res & Engn Co; Factory Mutual Res Corp; Ford Motor Co; GE Corp Res & Dev Ctr; Owens, Brockway; Phillip Morris USA; Res Industries; Sawyer Associates; S Coast Air Quality Management Dist; SS Energy & Environm Int; United Technol Res Ctr; Ansaldo; Camera Commercio, Industria Artigianato; Consiglio Nazl Ricerche; ENEL CRT; ENI; Elsevier Sci Inc; FIAT CFR; Gordon & Breach Publicat Inc; Riello; Univ Federico II; Bric a Brac Napoi; Comune Napoli; ELASIS; Hewlett Packard Italian; Perkin Elmer Italia spa; Reg CampaniaCombust Inst; ALCOA Tech Ctr; Arthur D Little Inc; Chevron Res & Technol Co; Chevron Chem Co; CONSOL Inc; E I du Pont de Nemours & Co; Elect Power Res Inst; Engn Managements Consultants; EXXON Res & Engn Co; Factory Mutual Res Corp; Ford Motor Co; GE Corp Res & Dev Ctr; Owens, Brockway; Phillip Morris USA; Res Industries; Sawyer Associates; S Coast Air Quality Management Dist; SS Energy & Environm Int; United Technol Res Ctr; Ansaldo; Camera Commercio, Industria Artigianato; Consiglio Nazl Ricerche; ENEL CRT; ENI; Elsevier Sci Inc; FIAT CFR; Gordon & Breach Publicat Inc; Riello; Univ Federico II; Bric a Brac Napoi; Comune Napoli; ELASIS; Hewlett Packard Italian; Perkin Elmer Italia spa; Reg Campania	NAPLES, ITALYNAPLES, ITALY	2	0	0	0	0	0	2					*************	WOS:000083308500117

Dekel, Dario/0000-0002-8610-0808			Unraveling mysteries of hydrogen electrooxidation in anion exchange membrane fuel cells								CURRENT OPINION IN ELECTROCHEMISTRY				12				182	188		10.1016/j.coelec.2018.11.013				DEC 2018	2018	Anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) can potentially revolutionize the energy generation market; however, to be seriously considered as a real alternative to the mainstream fuel cell technology, complete removal of previous metal electrocatalysts needs to be achieved. While in cathode electrodes platinum can be easily substituted, the electrochemical hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in the AEMFC anodes currently involves prohibitive overpotential losses, making the removal of platinum extremely challenging. Understanding the HOR in AEMFCs will facilitate the path to overcome the challenge and finally develop and demonstrate platinum-free high-performance AEMFC devices.									45	1	0	0	1	0	45			2451-9103			WOS:000453329900024

However, the capacity fading and voltage decay during the cycle at high voltage hinders its practical application, resulting from the surface instability and bulk structural transformation. Here, we constructed a high-voltage-stable interface of Li-n(TM)(m)PO4 (LTMPO, TM = Ni, Co, and Mn) by surface treatment to improve the voltage and capacity stability of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) during cycling. The formed LTMPO nanolayer with better ionic conductivity and bonds with the surface of host NCM811 by a TM-O-P bond. As a result, the formed LTMPO interface could suppress the occurrence of surface side reactions and oxygen evolution, thus stabilizing the host structure and surface structure. The surface-modified NHP-2 electrode shows excellent capacity retention of 80.36% over 300 cycles at a high cut-off voltage of 4.5 V. This structure design strategy can effectively improve the electrochemical performance of NCM811 cathodes and promote the rapid development of high energy density Li-ion batteries (LIBs).									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000727811900001

The model of NO and N2O in air-staged combustion is established in this study, creatively associates the important reactions involving NO and N2O, and successfully predicts the secondary increase of NO during air-staged combustion and the occurrence of N2O in the high-temperature zone. The model correlates CO with the reduction of NO in the reduction zone and the generation of N2O, successfully predicting the downward trend of NO in the reduction zone. The formation mechanism of NO and N2O was further explored by simulating the combustion atmosphere. The results show that the increase in oxygen concentration can promote the oxidation of NH3 to NO. In the CO/O-2 combustible atmosphere, NH3 will be converted into a high ratio of NO and a certain amount of N2O. The addition of NO did not increase N2O formation. N2O can be formed through the direct oxidation of CO(NH2)(2) and also can be generated by reaction of NO with NCO; the significant increase in the production of N2O in the second stage indicates the important role of NO in N2O formation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0888-5885			WOS:000812131300001

Future energy materials for applications, such as Li-ion, Li-sulfur, Li-air batteries, and supercapacitors require materials with high energy density and power capability. The preparation of three-dimensional (3D) carbon nanotubes (CNTs)-carbon nanofibers (CNFs) nanomaterials through a multi-step process has many difficulties. The aggregation, the high expense of CNTs, and the difficult conditions for synthesizing CNTs have pushed researchers to consider new methods. The direct growth of CNTs on CNFs via one-step electrospinning and a combined pyrolysis process is an efficient method for preparing 3D CNTs-CNFs, as demonstrated in the literature. Herein, the importance of the hybrid 3D CNTs-CNFs nanomaterials is reviewed, as well as their growth mechanisms, and the parameter influence on the morphology of grown CNTs. Moreover, the performance of the electrochemical energy storage for the hybrid CNTs grown on CNFs in the literature is reviewed and explained. Finally, the nanomaterials form the CNTs grown CNFs have great potential for various applications.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			2365-6549			WOS:000468976000010		
J	Guo, Yue; Dai, Fangqin; Hu, Shoutian; Xu, Guang								Effect of Surface Oxidation on Decarburization of a Fe-3%Si Steel during Annealing								ISIJ INTERNATIONAL				58	9			1727	1734		10.2355/isijinternational.ISIJINT-2018-233				2018	2018	The main purpose of decarburization annealing is to reduce the mass fraction of carbon in Fe-3%Si steels to avoid magnetic aging in silicon steels. Decarburization annealing experiments are carried out at different annealing temperatures, P-H2O/P-H2 and times. The morphological evolution of oxidized layer on steel surface, the changes of carbon and oxygen concentrations in a Fe-3% Si steel, and the influence of the oxidation of alloying elements on the decarburization are analyzed. Results show that decarburization rate of the tested silicon steel is the highest when annealing temperature is 1 103 K and P-H2O/P-H2 is 0.374. When P-H2O/P(H2 )and annealing temperature are lower than that of optimum annealing condition, increasing annealing temperature or P-H2O/P-H2 result in the increase of the convective mass transfer coefficient between steel and atmosphere, promoting the mass transfer and intensifying decarburization reaction. On the other hand, the amount of oxide particles also increases with further increasing P-H2O/P-H2 and annealing temperature, resulting in the hindrance of the diffusion of carbon atoms in the oxidized layer and slow-down of decarburization.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			0915-1559	1347-5460		WOS:000445974300024

In order for these technologies to be more competitive, advanced electrocatalysts with much higher performance and lower cost are required. The structural and chemical flexibilities of perovskite oxides enable them to be easily modified for diverse catalytic applications. Here we combine three strategies to develop a high-performance trifunctional perovskite electrocatalysts: 1) design a mesoporous fibrous nanostructure; 2) couple a dual functional system; and 3) engineer surface oxygen vacancies. The obtained nanomaterial shows promise to catalyze ORR/OER/HER in alkaline conditions, implying that optimization of the internal/external structure via engineering the defect chemistry of a complex perovskite catalyst would be helpful in advancing its catalytic activity. This protocol discloses an exciting new opportunity to design multifunctional perovskite catalysts for energy storage and conversion.									155	3	0	0	6	0	155			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000397003700030

When desiccated, anhydrobiotic organisms are also able to tolerate other physical stresses, as high and low levels of temperature and pressure. Here, we decided to investigate the tolerance of desiccated P. superbus to an unprecedented double stress-hypoxia within 99.99% Gallium (Ga) metal cage. The authors observed that regardless of the external relative humidity, desiccated P. superbus tolerated 7d confined within the metal cage, displaying no negative effects on its survival and population growth rates over 40d. The results evidence that anhydrobiosis also renders nematodes tolerant to otherwise lethal concentrations of Ga, in an oxygen-poor environment; thus, expanding its polyextremotolerance profile.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-300X			WOS:000535281700001	32421263

In the catalyst powder, Ni was evenly distributed and it could form NiOOH to promote catalysis, and an amorphous carbon (C) layer with a thickness of <10 nm was formed on the surface of the composite particles, improving the stability of the Ni/WC powder and promoting electron transport. Due to the characteristics of uniformity and a large specific surface area and the synergistic effect of Ni, WC, and C, this powder showed significantly improved ORR catalytic activity in alkaline solution. When the amount of Ni doping was 15 wt%, the composite powder showed the smallest particle size and the best ORR catalytic performance. Its cathode peak potential was -0.31 V and the half wave potential was -0.34 V. The number of electrons transferred in the ORR reaction was 3.6. This work provided a fast and cheap method for the preparation of multicomponent composite catalyst materials.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2046-2069		WOS:000724951200001	35493248

In this work, an integrated probe consisting of a Pt microelectrode wrapped with an Ag/AgCl wire and inserted into an outer capillary filled with KCl is developed as sensor for electrochemical analysis of small volume droplets (20 mu L). With a 3D-printed holder, the design allows easy fabrication, dismantling and re-assembly, which is important for renewing the probe. The integrated probe shows acceptable ohmic drop with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, thus offers reliable and reproducible potentiometric and voltammetric measurements in bulk solutions. The ring-shaped opening between the inner microelectrode and the outer capillary also enables homogenous current distribution when applying potential between Pt and Ag/AgCl. Based on this, two droplet systems mimicking atmospheric corrosion are in-situ studied: (1) Fe3+ droplet on bare and silane-coated steel; (2) Cu2+ in a H2SO4 droplet on copper. The concentration of Fe3+/Fe2+ and Cu2+ in the droplet is monitored with time, allowing interfacial corrosion reactions between the droplet and the substrate to be studied.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				0925-4005		WOS:000700575800001

In the present work, dual S, N-doped activated CoFe2O4@CNTs was successfully synthesized using carbamide and sodium thiosulfate as N and S precursors and CNTs as a substrate via a convenient two-step hydrothermal activation procedure, which presents good performance for supercapacitor. The characterization results indicate that activity S and N atoms can be successfully doped into the framework of CoFe2O4@CNTs with little impact on the inner morphology and structure. However, the electrode material of N2S1-CoFe2O4@CNTs exhibits a superior electrochemical performance with 1053.60 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) in KOH electrolyte due to synergistic effects between spinel-type metal oxides, heteroatoms and sp(2) lattice of graphitic carbon. In addition to high energy and power densities, the capacitance retention of charging-discharging reaches 93.15% at a current density of 30 A g(-1) after 5000 cycles, exhibiting an outstanding cycle stability and potential lifetime in an alkaline electrolyte.

Specifically, the modification of the FeNi LDHs at the surface of NiCo2O4 nanocones modulates the chemical valences of Ni, Fe, and Co species and is controlled by the electrodeposition time, finally achieving the optimal bifunctional electrocatalytic activity. Primary ZABs manufactured by NiCo2O4@FeNi LDH have a peak power density (130 mW cm(-2)), open-circuit potential (OCV) (1.40 V), and great discharge stability.

Improving the affordability of coating processes can bring enormous manufacturing advantages to battery applications. Herein, we report a cheap, simple and efficient method to create conformal coating layers on the primary particles of sodium layered oxide materials for improving battery performance. Mimicking the cathode-electrolyte interfacial reaction in practical cells, we create conformal coating layers via the spontaneous reaction between the oxidative cathode surfaces and a cocktail of reductive organic solvents. The conformal coating layers consist of metal-organic compounds with reduced transition metal cations, i.e., artificial cathode-electrolyte interphases (CEIs). The cells containing these coated cathode materials deliver much improved cycle life while maintaining reasonably high reversible capacity and rate capability. Furthermore, the structural stability and water resistance are enhanced, which can practically help simplify the storage protocol of cathode powders prior to battery manufacturing. The surfaces of most oxide cathode materials (e.g., lithium cathodes and sodium cathodes) are highly oxidative, and thus we expect that the present method, with tailored experimental parameters, can be readily applied to most battery systems.									11	1	0	0	1	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000424466300037

The evolution of AlOx on the CH3-SAMS was studied by comparing with that on hydrophilic OH-terminated silicon dioxide (OH-SiO2) surfaces, The AlOx grown on the CH3-SAM surfaces underwent growth instability and developed significantly rough surface morphologies while the AlOx on the OH-SiO2 maintained atomically smooth surface morphologies. The structural integrity of the CH3-SAMs was also found to be disturbed substantially at the onset of the ALD process with H2O. To improve the surface morphology of AlOx on CH3-SAM surfaces, a two-stage ALD process was developed. In the two-stage ALD process for AlOx, the first stage utilized n-propanol as the oxygen source and the second stage proceeded with H2O. The optimized two-stage ALD process significantly improved the surface morphology of AlOx films and effectively protected the structural integrity of underlying CH3-SAMs.					World Congress on Engineering and Computer Science (WCECS 2007)World Congress on Engineering and Computer Science (WCECS 2007)	OCT 24-26, 2007OCT 24-26, 2007	Int Assoc EngineersInt Assoc Engineers	San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0094-243X		978-0-7354-0526-4	WOS:000256223200006

Herein, the concept of metal cofactor was utilized in the in situ fabrication of multiple metal and heteroatom self-doped porous carbonaceous electrocatalysts. The sustainable biomass legume root nodules that contain nitrogenase were used as single precursors, and the specific surface area of the as-prepared catalyst could reach 1835 m(2) g(-1) by the activation of ZnCl2 during high-temperature pyrolysis processes. The self-doped biomass-derived catalyst exhibits an outstanding oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalytic performance with half-wave potentials (E-1/2) of 0.723 V and 0.868 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M HClO4 and 0.1 M KOH solution, respectively. It is worth noting that E-1/2 of the catalyst even outperforms 25 mV to that of Pt/C (E-1/2 = 0.843 V) in alkaline electrolytes. This performance is also markedly better than that of most other reference catalysts, which is based on codoped additional transition metals or heteroatoms with biomass-derived carbonaceous materials. The catalyst also delivers promising fuel cell performance in both low-temperature air-breathing polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and Zn-air batteries. The role of Mo atoms from the iron-molybdenum cofactor in the as-prepared biomass-derived catalyst toward ORRs is discussed herein. This study is expected to inspire exploration and design of appropriate doping structures and compositions to develop highly active and renewable biomass-derived catalysts in diverse application fields.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000661591700001

These materials have demonstrated improved characteristics such as electron transport, dye loading, electrolyte permeation, and oxidative capabilities when compared to those of typical nanostructured catalysts when used for different catalytic applications. Of particular interest are ferrites that have demonstrated roles in biomedical and magnetic devices, recharge-able batteries, sensors, catalysis, and water treatment. In addition, microwave hydrothermal synthesis is an attractive method due to its simplicity, rapid synthesis rate, and ease of operation. This paper details the synthesis of mesoporous first-row transition metal ferrites. M2+ (Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+) ferrite synthesis was systematically studied using a Biotage Initiator microwave apparatus, and the effects of reaction time and initial M(2+ )concentration on the crystal structure, morphology, composition, and magnetic and catalytic activities were evaluated. Various characterization techniques were utilized to study the synthesis mechanism and characteristics of the materials. These materials were then applied to the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction, where NiFe2O4 showed high activity vs other ferrites with a low overpotential of 278 mV at 10 mA/cm(2).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000855240100001

Remarkably, this transition takes place below the decomposition temperature of the functional groups and thus allows fine tuning of graphitic domains without compromising with the functionality of GO. By studying the transformation of GO under mild thermal treatment, we directly observe this size enhancement of graphitic domains from originally <= 40 nm(2) to >200 nm(2) through an extensive transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study. Additionally, we confirm the integrity of the functional groups during this process by a comprehensive chemical analysis. A closer look into the process confirms the theoretical predicted relevance for the room temperature stability of GO and the development of the composition of functional groups is explained with reaction pathways from theoretical calculations. We further investigate the influence of enlarged graphitic domains on the hydration behaviour of GO and the catalytic performance of single atom catalysts supported by GO. Additionally, we show that the sheet resistance of GO is reduced by several orders of magnitude during the mild thermal annealing process.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1369-7021	1873-4103		WOS:000731402500010

AuPt nanoparticles and multiwalled carbon nanotube composites (AuPt-MCNTs) were successively modified on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE), which improved the electronic transfer rate as well as increased the amount of immobilized capture hairpin DNA (HP). In the presence of Pb2+, GR could be specifically cleaved at the ribonucleotide (rA) site, which produced the short MoS2-GR to hybridize with HP immobilized on the surface of the GCE. Because of the mimic peroxidase property of MoS2, an enzymatically amplified electrochemical signal was obtained to achieve the sensitive detection of Pb2+. In addition, benefiting from the Pb2+-dependent GR, the proposed assay could selectively detect Pb2+ in the presence of other metal ions. This method showed a good linear relationship between the current response and the Pb2+ concentration ranging from 0.03 to 500 nmol L-1 with a detection limit of 0.015 nmol L-1. The new, robust, and convenient assay systems can be widely utilized for the identification of other target molecules.									11	0	0	0	4	0	11			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000406192800016		
J	Yang, Zhiyu; Huang, Yizhe; Li, Xin; Jiang, Zhiwei; Chen, Yuwen; Yang, Song; Garces, Hector F.; Sun, Yu; Yan, Kai								Highly dispersed CoFe2O4 spinel on biomass-derived 3D porous carbon framework for much enhanced Fenton-like reactions								SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY				298						121535	10.1016/j.seppur.2022.121535				OCT 1 2022	2022	Rational design of the low-cost, highly efficient and easily recyclable catalyst to directly activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) is crucial for the efficient removal of organic pollutants in the sewage treatment. Herein, hyperdispersed CoFe2O4 spinel nanoparticles were successfully in-situ fabricated on biomass-derived 3D porous carbon framework (C) by the facile one-step solvothermal method (CoFe2O4/C). These as-prepared CoFe2O4/C exhibit superior performance in the Fenton-like removal of four quinolones by the combination of experimental work and theoretical calculation. Experimental results prove that CoFe2O4/C catalyst can directly activate PMS to efficiently remove four types of quinolones in 12 min without the external energy consumption. The characterization results show that hyperdispersed CoFe2O4 (18.0 +/- 5.0 nm) nanoparticles are uniformly anchored on the matrix of C, exhibit a large specific surface area of 733.1 m2/g, and present rich oxygen vacancies (Ovs), thus exposing more reactive sites and generating more reactive oxygen species (ROS). In CoFe2O4/C + PMS system, -97.5% of ciprofloxacin (CIP) is removed within 12 min, which is far superior to other candidates previously reported. Other quinolones (e.g., -96.8% of ofloxacin (OFL), -100% of levofloxacin (LEV), and -86.4% of norfloxacin (NOR)) can also be efficiently degraded under the same conditions. Based on quenching experiments, electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, these superior activities are mainly due to the free radical (SO4.-, .OH, and .O2-) and non-free radical (1O2), whereas SO4.- and .OH are the major reactive oxygen species. In addition, these CoFe2O4/C catalysts remain stable even after five cycles. Subsequently, degradation pathways are rationally proposed. This work provides a feasible and universal strategy for the direct activation of PMS in wastewater treatment.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1383-5866	1873-3794		WOS:000826506500005

JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY B-BIOLOGY				84	1			70	78		10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2006.01.012				JUL 3 2006	2006	The effects of cadmium (from 7.5 to 75 mu M) on chloroplasts of rice were studied at the structural and biochemical level. Loss of pigments, reduction of thylakoids and decrease in oxygen evolution and Fv/Fm ratio occur in leaves following cadmium treatment. However, the amount of photosystem II reaction center proteins and that of its light harvesting complex is not affected, indicating that cadmium does not adversely influence the structural organization of this photosystem. In thylakoids isolated from cadmium-treated plants a loss in the capability to reduce 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol is observed, which is partially restored if diphenylcarbazide is used as an electron donor, indicating that cadmium affects water splitting activity. In thylakoids isolated from control plants and treated with cadmium, diphenylcarbazide preserves most of the photosystem II activity lost after incubation with cadmium; most of the S-2 multiline electron paramagnetic resonance signal from the manganese cluster is lost, whereas the TyrD(+) and other signals are retained. Light-induced photosystem II damage, in vitro, is promoted by Cd-treatment as deduced from the mobility shift of the D1 protein observed by immunoblot. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Biotechnology advances				61				108051	108051		10.1016/j.biotechadv.2022.108051				2022-Oct-18	2022	Cytochrome P450s are heme-thiolate enzymes that have been broadly applied in pharmaceutical and biosynthesis because of their efficient oxidation at inert carbons. Extensive engineering campaigns are applied to P450s to explore new non-natural substrates and reactions; however, achieving high coupling efficiency is one of the main challenges. The undesirable uncoupling reactions result in the extra consumption of expensive cofactor NAD(P)H, and lead to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and the inactivation of enzymes and organisms. Using protein engineering methods, these limitations can be overcome by engineering and fine-tuning P450s. A systemic perspective of the enzyme structure and the catalytic mechanism is essential for P450 engineering campaigns for higher coupling efficiency. This review provide an overview on factors contributing to uncoupling and protein engineering approaches to minimize uncoupling and thereby generating efficient and robust P450s for industrials use. Contributing uncoupling factors are classified into three main groups: i) substrate binding pocket; ii) ligand access tunnel(s); and iii) electron transfer pathway(s). Finally, we draw future directions for combinations of effective state-of-the-art technologies and available software/online tools for P450s engineering campaigns.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1873-1899		MEDLINE:36270499	36270499

We fabricated a hierarchically porous Ni-Fe-S hollow hierarchical sphere through a solvothermal reaction of Ni2+, Fe3+ with a mixed solution of glycerol and isopropanol and a S2- ion-exchange process. The incorporation of hybrid metal atoms significantly improved the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of the hollow hierarchical sphere. Typically, the Ni-Fe-S hollow hierarchical sphere exhibits superior OER and HER activities to the single-phase Ni-S and Fe-S hollow hierarchical spheres, as well as most of the bifunctional electrocatalysts when catalyzing full water splitting. To drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the Ni-Fe-S hollow hierarchical sphere requires an overpotential of only 223 and 115 mV for the OER and HER, respectively. Furthermore, the Ni-Fe-S hollow hierarchical sphere catalyst shows excellent durability after a long-term test. The superior activity and long-term stability demonstrate that the Ni-Fe-S hollow hierarchical sphere catalyst has promising potential for application in large-scale water splitting.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000669862200001

The unfavorable kinetics of this reaction requires the development of highly efficient catalysts (WOCs). The most promising performance has been obtained with noble metal based systems, which however pose challenges for the careful exploitation of these precious elements. In this Review, one of the most promising strategies for the development of WOCs in a `noble metal atom economy' fashion is described, that is, the incorporation of these metals in layered double hydroxides (LDHs) of earth abundant elements. A rapidly raising number of studies demonstrate that excellent catalytic activity and durability can be obtained by following this strategy. The strong electronic coupling between noble metal nanoparticles or single atoms and the LDHs matrix is typically responsible for such intriguing results. Interestingly, noble metal incorporation as low as 1 wt% allows to boost the catalytic performance of intrinsically active systems like NiFe-LDHs, but also to activate otherwise inert materials like ZnAl-LDHs.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0020-1693	1873-3255		WOS:000605619000010

To achieve this, heterogeneous water oxidation catalysis needs to be mastered and properly understood. The search continues for a catalyst that is stable at the surface of electro(photo)anodes and can efficiently perform this reaction at the desired neutral pH. Here, we show how oligomeric Ru complexes can be anchored on the surfaces of graphitic materials through CH-pi interactions between the auxiliary ligands bonded to Ru and the hexagonal rings of the graphitic surfaces, providing control of their molecular coverage. These hybrid molecular materials behave as molecular electroanodes that catalyse water oxidation to dioxygen at pH 7 with high current densities. This strategy for the anchoring of molecular catalysts on graphitic surfaces can potentially be extended to other transition metals and other catalytic reactions.									29	0	0	0	2	0	29			1755-4330	1755-4349		WOS:000573437300001	32989272

However, the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) often exhibits low faradaic efficiencies due to (i) the low solubility of nitrogen gas (N-2) in water and (ii) the hydrogen evolution reaction that is prominent in the same range of potentials in aqueous systems. Ionic liquids (ILs) have been shown to overcome these issues to some extent. In this work, we describe the synthesis and characterization of a family of phosphonium-based ILs with highly fluorinated anions, which are shown to display high N-2 solubilities. Their thermal properties were examined, with perfluorosulfonate-based ILs showing high decomposition temperatures in comparison to a low, two-step decomposition process found with perfluorocarboxylate-based ILs. Their transport properties, including viscosity and ionic conductivity, were fitted to the Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher (VTF) equation over a wide temperature range, and the VTF parameters are described. The electrochemical window for all of the synthesized ILs extend past the reduction potentials required for N-2 reduction. Thus, these high N-2 solubility ILs show scope as nonaqueous electrolytes for the electrochemical NRR.									38	3	1	0	1	0	39			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000449308400007

In this study, the citrate sol-gel method was used to synthesize these nanostructures and inspect the significant impacts of nitrogen-doping-originated crystalline defects on their photocatalytic performance in some details for the first time. The results indicated that the penetration of nitrogen atoms into AT crystal lattice, depending on the nitriding time and temperature, can induce a great deal of the residual stress and result in propagating the existing cracks and breaking down the particles. The XPS and FTIR results confirmed the formation of some new bonds in the crystal structure (including O-Ti-N and Ti-N), the substitutional and interstitial replacement of nitrogen atoms with oxygen atoms, oxygen vacancies, and the attachment of nitrogen species at superficial oxygen sites. These events may vary the bandgap values from 2.88 eV for pristine AT to 2.73 eV for the nitrided one, thereby manipulating the charge carrier recombination rate and activation of superficial catalytic reactions in the particles. Numerically, the band structure variations can efficiently increase the photodegradation efficiency of methylene blue (MB) and apparent rate constant (k) by 1.4 times (from 38.9 to 55.9%) and 1.8 times (from 0.0038 to 0.0068 min(-1)), respectively. Finally, the results show that the synthesized photocatalyst can successfully compete with TiO2-based photocatalysts in terms of photocatalytic performance.

It is hypothesized that if the corrosion process is accelerated at approximately the same rate as the fatigue frequency, testing time could be highly reduced. Corrosion acceleration is possible by modifying physical and/or electrochemical properties involved in the redox reactions. In this work the first option was chosen. Based on a literature review temperature and dissolved oxygen level were concluded to be the most influencing parameters. Several test scenarios with different combinations of sea water temperature and dissolved oxygen level have been defined. Corresponding S-N curves have been constructed for HSLA steel (type DNV F460) specimens immersed in natural seawater. The direct current potential drop technique was used to quantify damage evolution for all tested scenarios. Additionally, a reference S-N curve for immersed behaviour was determined at a temperature and frequency close to North Sea conditions. Comparison of the experimental results indicates that an average acceleration of the corrosion assisted fatigue damage process of around 80 % could be obtained.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0014-4851	1741-2765		WOS:000398161000004

Each of the complexes is an efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen production at the potential of the Co(II/I) couple, with turnover frequencies ranging from 40 to 400 s(-1) in 18 mM TFA and TsOH. In our study, the reaction path and reaction rate are affected by both the proton source and the substituent. In organic solvent, the catalysis may undergo two competing catalytic routes (EECC and ECEC pathways). The rate of catalysis can be improved remarkably by increasing the number of cyano-substituents. For the three cyano-substituent complex 4, a TOF of 381 s(-1) is obtained in low concentration of p-toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH) which is 9 times higher than that of the unsubstituted complex 1. Complex 4 is also an efficient electrocatalyst for the HER in neutral aqueous systems, and a turnover number (TON) of 1675 and Faraday efficiency of 98% have been observed in aqueous medium. This work can provide some evidence for the influence of the cyano-substituent on corroles for the HER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000820727400001

For practical applications, it is necessary to improve the interfacial properties of light-harvesting semiconductors through modification with proper electrocatalysts, by trying to overcome their intrinsic limitations such as rapid recombination, sluggish reaction kinetics, and photocorrosion. Compared to their heterogeneous counterparts, molecular electrocatalysts have a higher catalytic activity and more flexibility in their design/synthesis and integration with semiconducting materials. In this article, we review recent efforts on the tailored assembly of molecular electrocatalysts to address the above issues for artificial photosynthesis, especially those for oxygen evolution reactions on semiconductor photoelectrodes for photoelectrochemical water oxidation. One can expect that the strategies and methods developed for the tailored assembly and integration of molecular electrocatalysts on water oxidation photoanodes can provide insights for the design and fabrication of various forms of photosynthetic devices due to the similarity between their underlying principles.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			1434-1948	1099-0682		WOS:000466518100006

Here a universal process for the design of high-performance carbon-based electrocatalysts, by engineering their intrinsic electronic structures and physical structures to promote their extrinsic activities for different energy conversion reactions, is presented and summarized.

J	Wang, Yaru; Zhao, Jianjun; Hou, Wenqing; Xu, Yiming								Decoration of CdS nanowires with Ni3S4 nanoballs enhancing H-2 and H2O2 production under visible light								APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL				310						121350	10.1016/j.apcatb.2022.121350				AUG 5 2022	2022	Much work in the past four decades has focused on CdS as photocatalyst for water splitting. Recently, Ni3S4 has been reported to be more active than IrO2 as an electrocatalyst for water oxidation. Herein we report a positive role of Ni3S4 in CdS photocatalysis. Reaction was conducted in aqueous suspension under a 420 nm light, either for proton reduction to H-2 in presence of Na2S and Na2SO3, or for O-2 reduction to H2O2 without addition of any sacrifices. In both cases, Ni3S4 were nearly not active. After Ni3S4 loading, however, the rates of H-2 and H2O2 production on CdS increased by factors as much as 21 and 3, respectively. Furthermore, Ni3S4/CdS was more efficient than CdS for proton and O-2 reduction on a cathode, respectively, while Ni3S4/CdS was less efficient than CdS for the photoelectron accumulation on an electrode at open circuit potential. Based on the solid photoluminescence spectra and band edge potentials, a possible mechanism is proposed, involving the interfacial electron transfer from CdS to Ni3S4, followed by an increased surface reaction, for proton (oxygen) reduction on Ni3S4 sites, and for sulfide (water) oxidation on CdS sites, respectively.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000803806500005

The main pyrolytic liquids were ketones and acids in the non-catalytic pyrolysis run, which were mainly derived from the pyrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose in biomass by ring opening and side chain cracking reactions, while the relative content of phenolic substances obtained from catalytic reaction at 400 degrees C over CO2-activated char increased from 33.79% to 78.12% with the increasing char activation time from 0.5 to 2.0 h, resulting from the formation of more multiple active sites (including surface active groups and the pore characteristics) on activated char. When the catalytic reaction temperature reached 600 degrees C, the quality of the bio-oil was further improved since the relative content of aromatic hydrocarbons increased from 7.30% to 21.04% at the expense of elimination of some oxygen-containing compounds (e.g., ketones, acids, aldehydes, etc). Furthermore, the content of phenol in phenolic compounds increased from 26-64% to 51-97%. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

In the early stage of water stress (0-6 d) only the activity of Hill reaction was inhibited, whereas activities of photophosphorylation and Ca2+-ATPase, and ATP content were increased and peaked in the day 6 of withholding irrigation. In the late stage of water stress (6-12 d), the activities of photosynthetic 02 evolution, Hill reaction, photophosphorylation, and Ca2+-ATPase, and ATP content were significantly reduced. The membrane lipid content was sharply decreased, especially of sulfoquinovosyl-diacylglycerol (SQDG) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG). The changes in the ultrastructure of chloroplasts included mainly a decrease in number of grana and increase in number of osmiophilic granules.									28	9	0	0	28	0	38			0300-3604	1573-9058		WOS:000227107400013

Herein, non-precious NixCoy-P@C core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) are synthesized as a high-active cocatalyst for photocatalytic water splitting. After coupling with g-C3N4, H-2 and O-2 production achieved 485 and 240 mu mol g(-1) h(-1); the half-reaction of H-2 evolution achieved 4182 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), comparable to 4552 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) of Pt/g-C3N4. The carbon shell leads to the controlled core size of NixCoy-P NPs, leading to an interfacial contact with g-C3N4, rapid electron transfer efficiency, and enhanced electron receiving capability of the catalyst. The carbon-shell and NixCoy-P NPs contribute to a significant synergy in promoting carrier separation and transfer efficiency. The Ni/Co ratio modulation in NixCoy-P NPs could optimize the work function of the cocatalyst for H-2 evolution. Besides, carbon-shell introduces more pore structures and increases the surface area of the catalysts, which could provide more sites to receive electrons for H-2 evolution. This work demonstrates the great potential of using high active and inexpensive NixCoy-P@C to replace expensive Pt for photocatalytic H-2 evolution and open new avenues for optimizing cocatalyst with an excellent performance by bimetals modulation and carbon-shell coating.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000739566700001

In this contribution, we present a combination of multiple stable isotopes,oxygen-sulfur-carbon included,of different minerals from Jinshandian skarn Fe deposit, Hubei province,which been proved had experienced a significant incursion of evaporites into its skarn system. Carbon and oxygen isotope values of calcite indicate extensive water-rock reactions between Jinshandian pluton and limestone or dolomite, which was part of the alteration and mineralization process of the Jinshandian skarn Fe deposit. Oxygen isotope values of fluid equilibrium with minerals from different stages showed a narrow range,and exhibited a regularity variation as the decrease of temperature. It is clear that oxygen isotope values of the early skarn stage overlap within the range of magmatic water,and has markedly higher delta~(18)O values during magnetite stage,and notable light delta~(18)O values during post ore stages, especially in late calcite-gypsum stage. These features indicating a mixing of multiple fluid sources in Jinshandian hydrothermal system, with originally dominated by magmatic water during the pre-ore stage, followed by significant incursion of evaporite materials during the ore forming stage and notable influx of delta~(18)O-depleted meteoric water after ore formed. Oxygen and sulfur isotope values of anhydrite indicated incursion of heavy delta~(34)S and delta~(18)O enriched fluid, which was likely been the magmatic water or circulation of meteoric water with leached evaporite materials. Pyrite form magnetite stage and post-ore stage (anhydrite-pyrite stage) are both enriched in heavy delta~(34)S,also suggesting the incursion of evaporite materials. The study of multiple stable isotope shows a mixing of diverse fluids in Jinshandian hydrothermal system and notable influx of evaporite materials during the ore forming stage, indicating that incursion evaporites was probably as the way of leaching evaporite materials by magmatic water or circulatory meteoric water, or a mix of both.			相比单一稳定同位素而言,多元稳定同位素组合的使用,能更有效地示踪成矿作用过程中流体的来源和演化。本文对已证明有含膏盐地层参与成矿作用的湖北金山店铁矿开展了碳-氧-硫等多元稳定同位素的研究。方解石碳氧同位素结果表明,金山店岩体与灰岩或白云岩之间发生了广泛的水岩反应,这些水岩作用是金山店铁矿蚀变矿化过程的一部分。与各阶段矿物平衡的流体氧同位素值变化范围较小,且表现出随温度降低具有规律性变化的特征:早期矽卡岩阶段氧同位素值在岩浆水范围内变化,磁铁矿阶段则明显富集重氧同位素,而成矿后的各阶段特别是石膏-方解石阶段,成矿流体明显富集轻氧同位素。这些特征暗示成矿之前流体以岩浆水为主,成矿作用发生时有一定含膏盐地层参与成矿,而成矿后大气水特征明显,即成矿流体具有多元混合的特征。硬石膏氧-硫同位素组合暗示成矿流体中具有明显富delta~(34)S-delta~(18)O流体成分的加入,这一流体可能为淋滤了地层中膏盐组分的岩浆水或循环的大气水。成矿阶段和成矿后的黄铁矿均富集重硫同位素,也暗示成矿流体中含膏盐地层组分的加入。多元稳定同位素组合的联合证据表明,金山店铁矿成矿流体具有多元混合的特点,成矿阶段含膏盐地层参与成矿作用特征明显,暗示含膏盐地层中的膏盐组分可能是被岩浆水或循环的大气水或二者的混合流体所淋滤而进入矽卡岩成矿体系的。						8	6	0	0	0	0	11			0001-5717			CSCD:5631973

The relationship of physicochemical properties and biological responses in catalytic nanomaterials needs to be clarified at the nano-bio interface for achieving the safe application. Herein, high-energy crystallographic facets of palladium (Pd) nanocrystals that have been known to significantly contribute to the catalytic activity were introduced to attenuate the toxicity, and the underlying mechanism was unraveled. Polyhedral Pd nanocrystals with morphology evolution from truncated octahedron to cuboctahedron and cube were prepared for elaborately tuning the extents of high-energy {100} facets, and hierarchical in vitro and in vivo biological evaluation were performed to clarify that Pd nanocrystals exposed with the more {100} facets could show the less toxicity to cells and animals. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation revealed {100} facet exposure was endowed with a strong oxygen adsorption, which weakens the breakage of the water molecule and suppresses the hazardous water dissociation and hydroxyl radical generation, which was supported by electron spin resonance (ESR)-based radical evaluation and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)-based oxygen identification. This means high-energy facet-based catalytic Pd nanocrystals can deliver low toxicity due to their unique surface properties.									7	0	0	0	4	0	7			1743-5390	1743-5404		WOS:000415921500006	28980841	
J	Gagliardi, Christopher J.; Westlake, Brittany C.; Kent, Caleb A.; Paul, Jared J.; Papanikolas, John M.; Meyer, Thomas J.								Integrating proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) and excited states								COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS				254	21-22	SI		2459	2471		10.1016/j.ccr.2010.03.001				NOV 2010	2010	In many of the chemical steps in photosynthesis and artificial photosynthesis, proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) plays an essential role. An important issue is how excited state reactivity can be integrated with PCET to carry out solar fuel reactions such as water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen or water reduction of CO2 to methanol or hydrocarbons. The principles behind PCET and concerted electron-proton transfer (EPT) pathways are reasonably well understood. In Photosystem II antenna light absorption is followed by sensitization of chlorophyll P-680 and electron transfer quenching to give P-680(+). The oxidized chlorophyll activates the oxygen evolving complex (OEC), a CaMn4 cluster, through an intervening tyrosine-histidine pair, Y-Z. EPT plays a major role in a series of four activation steps that ultimately result in loss of 4e(-)/4H(+) from the OEC with oxygen evolution. The key elements in photosynthesis and artificial photosynthesis - light absorption, excited state energy and electron transfer, electron transfer activation of multiple-electron, multiple-proton catalysis - can also be assembled in dye sensitized photoelectrochemical synthesis cells (DS-PEC). In this approach, molecular or nanoscale assemblies are incorporated at separate electrodes for coupled, light driven oxidation and reduction. Separate excited state electron transfer followed by proton transfer can be combined in single semi-concerted steps (photo-EPT) by photolysis of organic charge transfer excited states with H-bonded bases or in metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excited states in pre-associated assemblies with H-bonded electron transfer donors or acceptors. In these assemblies, photochemically induced electron and proton transfer occur in a single, semi-concerted event to give high-energy, redox active intermediates.

In order to utilize the unique structure of MOFs, a novel Ni-x/ZIF-67 photocatalyst was successfully prepared. It was synthesized by compounding semiconductor material on the surface of MOF at appropriate temperature. The composite photocatalyst not only had a large specific surface area, but also can provide a place for photosensitizer adsorption and hydrogen production reactions. At the same time, semiconductor bound with metal binding sites of MOF to form synergistic interface, which accelerated the photogenerated electron transfer. In other words, the synergistic interface between the double-shell structure of ZIF-67 and NiPx, which proved by SEM and TEM, established an effective electron transport layer. When the content of NiPx was 30%, it exhibited best activity which generated 322 mu mol hydrogen in 5 h. Through the analysis of fluorescence intensity and photocurrent response, it can fully demonstrate that transfer efficiency of the photogenerated electronics in system was significantly improved. In addition, other characterizations from different focus were taken and the role of each composition in the reaction system was vividly described in mechanism.									31	1	0	0	4	0	31			2468-8231			WOS:000461410800010

Accelerated service life tests were carried out in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution and 1.0 M NaOH solution, respectively. The deactivation mechanism of the electrodes is studied using oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as the reaction mode. Cyclic voltammetry test showed that the electrodes after accelerated life tests had no catalytic-oxidizing activity upon phenol. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis exhibited that the membrane resistance of the deactivated electrode increases obviously in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution and 1.0 M NaOH solution, with the values of 1231 and 90.6 Omega, respectively. The structure, morphology and the content of the fresh and deactivated electrode were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray detector (EDX). This suggested that the Ti content on the electrode surface increases after deactivation, and TiO2 membrane with poor conductivity is grown on the electrode surface.									25	1	0	0	4	1	25			1023-1935	1608-3342		WOS:000278122000008

However, efficient electrocatalysts of CO2 reduction are still lacking. Herein, the theoretical screening was implemented to design bimetal catalysts (M2@M1, M1, M2 = Cu, Ag, Au, Pt, Pd, M1 not equal M2) and the catalytic activity of catalysts was investigated systematically. A simple and rapid screening method is proposed for the design and development of electrocatalysts. Pt@Ag has good catalytic performance for CO2RR-to-HCOOH, and greatly inhibits competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Au@Pd exhibits superior performance for CO production. Its overpotential (0.448 V) required for CO production is lower than those of the many catalysts reported. Pt@Ag is also a promising catalyst to produce CH3OH, and has a better catalytic activity than the most active CO2RR-to-CH3OH catalysts. The overpotential of CO2RR-to-CH3 OH is 0.393 V. This theoretical work provides a motivation for the experimental synthesis of bimetal catalysts, which are used for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0378-3820	1873-7188		WOS:000830060300007

By mimicking the naturally occurring enzymatic process, ammonia could be produced electrochemically from N-2 and water. To date, no such mechanism has come close to the production rates required for commercial viability. In this article, we present the results of a screening for possible catalysts, where density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed on 11 transition metal dioxides in the rutile structure. The aim was to find candidates that were stable and active toward ammonia formation while simultaneously suppressing the competing reaction of H-2 evolution. The most promising rutile oxide candidates are found to be the (110) facets of NbO2, ReO2 and TaO2, showing promise of producing ammonia at relatively low onset potentials of -0.57 V, -1.07 V and -1.21 V vs the standard hydrogen electrode, respectively. IrO2 was found to be the most active catalyst for this reaction with an onset potential of -0.36 V, but its surface might be poisoned by adsorbed hydrogen atoms.									86	5	0	0	7	0	88			2168-0485			WOS:000414825900089		
J	Ji, Guodong; Tan, Yufei; Zhang, Lihong								Bacterial and Granular Sludge Characteristics in an Ultrahigh-Temperature Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket Reactor Treating Super Heavy Oil-Containing Wastewater								ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE				28	2			129	137		10.1089/ees.2010.0166				FEB 2011	2011	Bacterial communities, taxonomic functional groups, and chemical characteristics of granular sludge were assessed in an ultrahigh-temperature (70 degrees C) upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASB) used to treat super heavy oil-containing wastewater. The UASB, with an organic loading rate of 3.0 kg COD m(-3) day(-1), achieved an average chemical oxygen demand removal of 48%, with 52% oil removal from the wastewater. It was also found to successfully degrade two typical biomarkers of super heavy oil, C26-34 17 alpha 25-norhopanes and C26-28 triaromatic steroid. Scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction results showed that the granular sludge became more compact with an increased quantity of extracellular polymeric substances, Fe2O3, FeS, and CaCO3 crystals in the reactor. Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and real-time polymerase chain reaction results indicated that after 90 days of operation, the density of total bacteria in the UASB dropped while Pseudomonas density increased, making it a dominant bacterium in the reactor. Data obtained from this research will provide useful information and insights with respect to effective treatment for super heavy oil wastewater under ultrahigh-temperature conditions.									5	1	0	0	2	0	5			1092-8758	1557-9018		WOS:000286652600006

Because of the presence of sulfur contaminants in fossil fuels, the gaseous products of sulfur species and the interactions between these sulfur contaminants and the oxygen carrier are significant concerns in chemical-looping combustion. Experiments on chemical-looping combustion of a sulfur-containing gaseous fuel with iron ore as the oxygen carrier were performed by thermogravimetric analysis and Fourier transform infrared (TGA-FTIR) spectroscopy. The effects of reaction atmosphere (N-2 and CO2), H2S concentration, and pressure on the reactivity of iron ore in the presence of H2S were investigated. The evolution of gaseous sulfur species was also investigated in both N-2 and CO2 atmospheres. With a higher concentration of H2S in the gaseous fuel, the weight loss was slower, and a weight gain was even observed due to the sulfidation of iron ore. Sulfidation of iron ore was observed in both N-2 and CO2 atmospheres, and elevated pressure contributed to a higher sulfidation rate. Compared with N-2 atmosphere, CO2 atmosphere gave higher concentrations of COS and an initial SO2 peak but a lower concentration of CS2. Furthermore, the effect of sulfidation on the structure of the iron ore was investigated in a fluidized bed, and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive analysis by X-rays (SEM-EDAX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were utilized to characterize the iron ore. The sulfidation of iron ore caused a decrease in both surface area and pore volume, and the porous surface of the oxygen carrier became smoother and almost imperforate. FeS was the only iron sulfide observed during the sulfidation process. The vulcanized iron ore could be regenerated with air calcination treatment, and the addition of H2O in the gaseous fuel could prevent the sulfidation of iron ore. The addition of CaO in the oxygen carrier was effective in mitigating the sulfidation and reducing the emission of gaseous sulfur species.									30	5	0	0	3	0	34			0888-5885			WOS:000314794700003

The fabricated photoanode exhibits rapid response to visible light, enhances photocurrent density and shows significant cathodic shift compared to BiVO4. Moreover, the measured incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of the photoanode is comparable to that reported in the literature. The amount of evolution oxygen was measured and the faradaic efficiency produced oxygen was also obtained by comparing the theoretical calculation value. The enhancement is attributed to the increase of the carrier density, the effective separation of photogenerated electron-hole and consuming of the photogenerated holes accumulated at the electrode surface, which has been confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and the intensity modulated photocurrent spectra (IMPS). The work may offer a promising method for designing a high efficiency and low-cost photoanode.

The diagnosis is usually performed by RT-PCR or CT chest scan. Lung ultrasonography (LUS) has been proposed as an alternative method to monitor patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.To assess the diagnostic performance of LUS, we performed LUS using a portable device and adapting a protocol already used in Acute Respiratory Syndrome. We used the score obtained with the index we created to assess for LUS diagnostic performance as compared to lung CT chest scan and to predict for oxygen requirements.Daily bedside LUS was easy to perform and microbiologically safe. LUS was 89% sensitive and 100% specific in predicting CT chest scan abnormalities, and 95% sensitive and 67% specific in detecting oxygen requirements.This is the first report on the diagnostic performance of LUS as compared to CT chest scan for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and assessments of oxygen requirements by LUS. LUS could help in the orientation of dyspneic patients to intensive care. It could also be proposed when there is limited access to CT scan in the context of a pandemic crisis, or to implement clinical lung examinations for outpatient follow-up.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1945-4589			WOS:000583838700012	33136555

In this study, we describe new findings on amorphous platinum-ruthenium-nickel-phosphorous nanoparticles supported on carbon (PtRuNiPa/C) and the comparison between their catalytic activity and the degree of disorder. The nanoscale amorphous structure with different degrees of disorder are probed as a function of surface composition, particle size, and thermal treatment conditions using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, selected area electron diffraction and electrochemical characterization. The results provide experimental evidence in support of nanoscale long-range disorder, medium-range disorder, and medium-range order evolution dependence on the catalyst synthesis temperature. More importantly, the results of the electrochemical performance investigation show that the amorphous structures with medium-range disorder have not only better catalytic activity, but also better durability for methanol oxidation compared to the long-range disorder and medium-range order structure. These results provide an opportunity for establishing the correlation between the nanoscale amorphous structure and their electrocatalytic activity for methanol oxidation reaction, which could play an important role in developing new high active catalysts for direct methanol fuel cells.

J	Saka, Cafer								Facile fabrication of P-doped g-C3N4 particles with nitrogen vacancies for efficient dehydrogenation of sodium borohydride methanolysis								FUEL				313						122688	10.1016/j.fuel.2021.122688				APR 1 2022	2022	The graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has become important in the field of environmental remediation with its metal-free and low-cost advantages. Here, for the first time in the literature, P doped graphitic carbon nitride (gC3N4) was used in the dehydrogenation of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) methanolysis. The effects of interaction time with phosphoric acid (H3PO4), NaBH4 concentration, amount of catalyst and temperature were investigated. The best interaction time with phosphoric acid was found to be 12 h. There was a 2-fold increase in the HGR values obtained by increasing the amount of NaBH4 from 1.25% to 2.5%, while there was a less proportional increase with increasing the amount of NaBH4 from 2.5% to 5%. Depending on the increase in the amount of catalyst, there is a decrease in the completion times of this reaction. H2 production rate of NaBH4 methanolysis increases rapidly with increasing temperature. An HGR value of 8666 mL min-1 cat- 1 using P doped g-C3N4 (10 mg) was found. The activation energy obtained for this metal-free catalyst was 30.29 kJ mol-1. Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-Ray analysis (SEM-EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses were used for characterization. A possible reaction mechanism was proposed for the catalyst used in this methanolysis reaction. At the same time, repeatability experiments were carried out for the catalyst.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000747409400003

These catalysts exhibited relatively good methane conversion under the following conditions: 2.0 g of catalyst, 50 mL/min CH4, 900 degrees C for 5 h, even without hydrogen pre-reduction. Fe2O3 species on these samples were found to be gradually reduced by methane to Fe3O4, FeO and then finally into Fe-0 active species. When methane decomposed onto the Fe-0 active sites, Fe3C species would form to deposit graphite around themselves to finally form carbon nano-materials, showing possible application in the oxygen evolution reaction and in Li-ion batteries as anode electrodes. Furthermore, using the best catalyst, iron concentrate powder, the effect of temperature and gas hourly space velocity was studied, where 900 degrees C and 3 L/g(cat).h were determined as the optimized reaction conditions to reach the highest carbon/hydrogen yield.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0959-6526	1879-1786		WOS:000721455900005

A chemical catalyst that shares this property could greatly improve the efficiency of water electrolysis and photolysis. There is therefore great interest in understanding the mechanism of this enzyme (and enzymes that catalyse the reverse reaction) and in reproducing aspects of its function in artificial systems. A similar interest exists in producing artificial proton-reducing systems to replace platinum as a catalyst in the current electrochemical systems for H-2 production. Such new catalysts could also help to improve the efficiency of fuel cells. In addition, bioinspired photochemical and electrochemical catalysts could well contribute to energy efficient synthesis of other high value chemicals and fuels. The recent improved understanding of the water oxidizing enzyme and of hydrogenases has made research in this area much more realistic than even in the recent past. Improvements in inorganic chemistry, photochemistry and nanotechnology all contribute of making research in this area timely. This article presents a brief overview of the current knowledge of the enzyme and some of the artificial systems that it has inspired.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0151-9093	2105-2409		WOS:000248146100010

The mass ratios between the OAm:PVP were respectively set to the 1:2, 1:1, 2:1 values. Platinum acetylacetonate (Pt(acac)(2)) was used as Pt precursor and the reduction of this salt to the metallic Pt was provided by microwave irradiation technique. It is seen that increasing amount of OAm triggers the formation of cubic shape Pt NPs. The average sizes of the Pt NPs fall in the range of 6-8 nm. The unsupported Pt NPs were directly used as a catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). According to the hydrodynamic ORR voltammograms of the catalysts, the Pt NPs prepared with 1:2 (OAm:PVP) exhibit the highest current density at all stirring rates of rotating disc electrode (RDE). Besides, Pt NPs prepared with 2:1 (OAm:PVP) have the minimum charge transfer resistance based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis conducted at 0.9 V. After all these analyses, Pt NPs were synthesized using extra five different ratios (1.5:1, 1:1.5, 2.5:1, 3:1, 1:3) of (OAm:PVP) for thoroughly examining the optimum value for the ORR catalytic activity. As a result, the Pt NPs prepared with a 2.5:1 (OAm:PVP) ratio provided the best performance among all the catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1662-5250	1661-9897		WOS:000809706400003

MoeO5, the enzyme responsible for the first step in moenomycin biosynthesis, catalyzes the transfer of farnesyl to 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3PG) to give a product containing a cis-allylic double bond. We show that this reaction involves isomerization to a nerolidyl pyrophosphate intermediate followed by bond rotation prior to attack by the nucleophile. This mechanism is unprecedented for a prenyltransferase that catalyzes an intermolecular coupling. We also show that PcrB transfers geranyl and geranylgeranyl groups to glycerol-1-phosphate (G1P), making it the first known bacterial enzyme to use G1P as a substrate. Unlike MoeO5, PcrB catalyzes prenyl transfer without isomerization to give products that retain the trans-allylic bond of the prenyl donors. The TIM barrel family of PTs is unique in including enzymes that catalyze prenyl transfer by distinctly different reaction mechanisms.									14	0	0	0	8	0	15			0002-7863			WOS:000287228500036	21214173

However, achieving high activity and product selectivity simultaneously remains a significant challenge. Herein, a series of Fe single-atom catalysts coordinated by B atoms, namely FeBxCy (x + y = 3 or 4), are constructed to systematically investigate the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) based on density functional theory computations. Eight catalysts, including FeO4, are identified that can effectively activate CO2 molecules and significantly inhibit competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Among them, FeB2C and FeB(2)C(2)h (h represents a cis structure) show the higher CO2RR activity with the less negative limiting potentials of-0.24 and-0.40 V toward production of CH4, indicating the optimal content for doping B atoms. The activity mechanism shows that d-band center and magnetic moment of central Fe atom can be manipulated by rational modulating the coordinated B atoms to improve the CO2RR performance. By the coordinated B atom, an optimal adsorption strength of the reaction intermediates can be achieved on the FeBxCy surface, and thereby increasing CO2RR catalytic activity and product selectivity. FeB2C with more negative d-band center and the optimal Fe atomic magnetic moment shows the best CO2RR performance. These results reveal a great potential of coordination tuning for CO2RR, and provide a new theoretical perspective for rational design of high activity, selective CO2RR catalysts.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000777263000001

In the clean getter direct photoemission is mostly sensitive to Fe-derived states and inverse photoemission to Zr-derived states. Direct photoemission shows the modification of oxygen-p-derived states in the suboxide-oxide transition and the effect of Fe-oxygen interaction with a depletion of Fe d states near the Fermi level. Inverse photoemission shows a progressive localization of the Zr d states upon oxidation.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0039-6028			WOS:A1992HJ95200016

The model considered the following chemical processes: 1) the rate of slag-steel reaction; 2) the rate of supply of calcium during calcium treatment; and 3) the rate of steel-inclusion reactions, including oxides and sulfides. Herein, the model is further validated by running the model in varying conditions and comparing the predicted and measured composition of inclusions and dissolved species in the steel for additional plant heats. A sensitivity analysis is also carried out to investigate the effect of different parameters, including sulfur content of steel, total oxygen, slag composition, and reoxidation of steel on the trajectory of composition of inclusions during the ladle process.

Hydrogen is a key solar fuel because it can be used directly in combustion engines or fuel cells, or combined catalytically with CO2 to make carbon containing fuels. Different approaches to solar water splitting include semiconductor particles as photocatalysts and photoelectrodes, molecular donor-acceptor systems linked to catalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution, and photovoltaic cells coupled directly or indirectly to electrocatalysts.Despite several decades of research, solar hydrogen generation is efficient only in systems that use expensive photovoltaic cells to power water electrolysis. Direct photocatalytic water splitting is a challenging problem because the reaction is thermodynamically uphill. Light absorption results in the formation of energetic charge-separated states in both molecular donor-acceptor systems and semiconductor particles. Unfortunately, energetically favorable charge recombination reactions tend to be much faster than the slow multielectron processes of water oxidation and reduction. Consequently, visible light water splitting has only recently been achieved in semiconductor-based photocatalytic systems and remains an inefficient process.This Account describes our approach to two problems in solar water splitting: the organization of molecules into assemblies that promote long-lived charge separation, and catalysis of the electrolysis reactions, in particular the four-electron oxidation of water. The building blocks of our artificial photosynthetic systems are wide band gap semiconductor particles, photosensitizer and electron relay molecules, and nanoparticle catalysts. We intercalate layered metal oxide semiconductors with metal nanoparticles, These intercalation compounds, when sensitized with [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) derivatives, catalyze the photoproduction of hydrogen from sacrificial electron donors (EDTA(2-)) or non-sacrificial donors (I-). Through exfoliation of layered metal oxide semiconductors, we construct multilayer electron donor-acceptor thin films or sensitized colloids in which individual nanosheets mediate light-driven electron transfer reactions. When sensitizer molecules are "wired" to IrO2 center dot nH(2)O nanoparticles, a dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode becomes the photoanode of a water-splitting photoelectrochemical cell.Although this system is an interesting proof-of-concept, the performance of these cells is still poor (similar to 1% quantum yield) and the dye photodegrades rapidly. We can understand the quantum efficiency and degradation in terms of competing kinetic pathways for water oxidation, back electron transfer, and decomposition of the oxidized dye molecules. Laser flash photolysis experiments allow us to measure these competing rates and, in principle, to improve the performance of the cell by changing the architecture of the electron transfer chain.									853	26	0	0	109	2	857			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000273082800012	19905000	
J	Wu, Dan; Hao, Jie; Song, Zhongxin; Fu, Xian-Zhu; Luo, Jing-Li					WU, Dan/0000-0001-5272-6581			All roads lead to Rome: An energy-saving integrated electrocatalytic CO2 reduction system for concurrent value-added formate production								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				412						127893	10.1016/j.cej.2020.127893		MAR 2021		MAY 15 2021	2021	Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) to value-added fuels has been actively pursued to reduce the carbon intensity of our energy and products-driven economy. Conventional CO2R is always coupled with the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), resulting in high electricity input being consumed by the OER due to its large energy barrier and sluggish kinetics. Herein, OER is replaced with selective methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) on non-noble electrocatalysts. In an integrated cell, CO2R is conducted on the cathode of Bi nanoparticles and MOR is performed on the anode of Ni(OH)(2) in alkaline electrolyte. Over 92% selectivity for cathodic reduction of CO2 into formate and 100% selectivity for anodic oxidation of methanol to formate are achieved at high current densities within a wide potential range. The use of the integrated system significantly lowers the specific energy consumption by 57.3% reduction for individual CO2R and 71.2% reduction for individual MOR for 1 mol formate generation. This novel strategy for concurrent formate generation at the cathode and anode dramatically increases the valuable fuels production with low electricity consumption. This study thus highlights the promise that coupling CO2R with viable alternative oxidation reaction is theoretically and technically feasible and presents significant economic benefits.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000638215700004

The in situ growth contributed to the formation of an intimate interface between Bi2MoO6 nanosheets and Bi2O3 nanofibers, thereby constructing an efficient 1D/2D heterojunction and obtaining a 3D hierarchical structure at the same time. More importantly, the growth of Bi2MoO6 nanosheets on Bi2O3 yielded superficial oxygen vacancies. Such a special morphology and defect structure could not only increase the light harvesting, but also promote the separation of photo-induced electrons and holes through a Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism. Therefore, the Bi2MoO6@Bi2O3 composite photocatalyst showed excellent photocatalytic performance under weak visible-light illumination, thus exhibiting potential for application in the degradation of antibiotics. This promising Bi2MoO6@Bi2O3 photocatalyst had a superior photocatalytic degradation rate of 96.3% for TC under 5 W LED visible-light irradiation for 3 hours, which was 6.0 and 4.9 times higher than those of pristine Bi2O3 and Bi2MoO6, respectively. Moreover, two main possible photocatalytic degradation pathways for TC over the Bi2MoO6@Bi2O3 photocatalyst were also proposed.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000750610200001		
J	Ren, Lei; Wang, Fei; Cheng, Fangqin; Yang, Fengling; Zhang, Kai								Mechanisms of gas generation from conventional and microwave pyrolysis of coal slime								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				452						139388	10.1016/j.cej.2022.139388				JAN 15 2023	2023	Microwave pyrolysis can efficiently achieve the clean upgrading of solid waste value fuels, such as coal slime (CS). However, the mechanism of pyrolysis gas release remains unclear. This study investigated the effects of the pyrolysis temperature and methods on pyrolysis gas generation. The results demonstrated that microwave pyrolysis exhibited a higher percentage of gas phase and a lower percentage of liquid phase and promoted the generation of pyrolysis gas, while inhibiting the formation of tar compared to conventional pyrolysis. The gas composition was quantified by micro gas chromatography, and kinetic calculations revealed that microwaves decreased the activation energy of H2 and CO generation by 23.74% and 36.01%, respectively, and the release of H2 and CO increased. The analysis of tar by gas mass spectrometry revealed that microwaves can reduce secondary reactions and promote the transfer of oxygen-containing functional groups to the liquid phase. The increase in temperature further stimulated the cyclization and condensation of tar, leading to the transfer of numerous center dot H and center dot O radicals in tar to the gas phase, as more H2 and CO were released. This is further explained in terms of heat and mass transfer. Density functional theory calculations of the R-COO-R' reaction pathway showed that microwaves could generate tremendous energy to promote the thermal decomposition of ester groups in tar, generating more H2 and CO. Therefore, a possible reaction path for generating H2 and CO by the thermal decomposition of CS under microwave intensification is proposed, which provides a feasible idea for the efficient quality improvement of CS.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000870963100004

In the present work, the electrocatalytic oxidation of AA was implemented at IrOx immobilized glassy carbon electrode (GC-IrOx) in an acidic medium. Prior to use, the physical properties of GC-IrOx surface were investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The XPS analysis revealed that a film of IrOx formed on the GC surface while it was cycled between 0 and 1.0 V vs Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl) reference electrode in Ir2O3 colloidal solution. The voltammetric investigations of AA oxidation at the GC-IrOx electrode revealed 4-folds higher current compared to a pristine GC electrode suggesting an excellent electrocatalytic performance. The Ir-(III)/Ir-(IV) redox couple is assigned for catalyzing the reaction. It was found that AA oxidation followed first order kinetics on the GC-IrOx electrode surface. The heterogeneous electron transfer (ET) kinetic study unveiled that AA oxidation reaction followed stepwise mechanism at potentials below 0.38 V and concerted mechanism above this potential with respect to a Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl) reference electrode. In this study, the standard rate constant (k(0)) pertaining to AA oxidation was evaluated as 7.25 x 10(-4) cm s(-1). The GC-IrOx electrode exhibited reasonably excellent stability, which mounts the probability of its application as an anode in the AA fuel cells. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Using the hybrid density functional theory, structural, electronic, optical, and photocatalytic properties of nine spatially modified bilayers referred to as S-0-S-8, together with site-dependent oxygen/hydrogen evolution reactions (OER/HER) on the most photoactive bilayer (S-3), have been explored in this work. vdW bilayers arranged considering all possibilities of interlayer atomatom/atombond alignment along with the upper layer rotated by 0 degrees (AA) and 180 degrees (AB) on energy and force minimization are classified into planar (corrugated) geometry with band gap decrement (increment) compared to the monolayer, indicating the role of pi-delocalization. Increased mobility, feasible surface migration, and reduced rate of recombination for photogenerated charge carriers in S-3 along with the highest optical absorbance indicated its importance over monolayer and other bilayer configurations. Among the different active reaction sites, the best suitable site on S-3 reveals 2 and 3 (20) times drop in value of overpotential for OER and HER (with an additional H2O molecule), respectively, against the monolayer. Current analysis displays efficient charge carrier separation, in which charge transfer within the bilayer on intermediate adsorption and formation of an interfacial electric field illustrates the stepwise reaction mechanism and proclaims the synergistic effect of pi-conjugation and interlayer orbital interaction for surface activation and improved photocatalytic activity of the g-C3N4 bilayer as compared to the monolayer.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000766226700027

These carbon foams, which serve as hosts for sulfur in lithium battery, can provide a conducting network and shorter diffusion length for Li-ions. Specially, the zinc nanodots derived from the carbothermal reaction of ZnCl2 at high temperature can interact with sulfur/polysulfides by strong chemisorption. In addition, the zinc nanodots can also facilitate the conversion reaction between Li2Sx (2 < x < 8) and Li2S/Li2S2. Therefore, Zn@NCFs/S cathode presents high sulfur utility and large capacity.

A popular trend of their diversified development is pyrolyzing them to produce derived materials with improved stability, conductivity, and well-inherited characteristics. Thanks to these properties, prepared MOF derivatives are gradually testified as alternative catalysts in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), involving Fenton reaction, sulfate radical-based AOPs (SR-AOPs) as well as photocatalysis for efficient pollutants degradation. Unfortunately, the introduction of the synthetic method of MOF derivatives is relatively rough yet and a comprehensive understanding of the differences in their application to different AOPs systems has not emerged. This review creatively details synthetic strategies of MOF derivatives by analyzing their special conditions and procedures. And starting with suitable MOF precursors, the review focuses on their changes in structure and component during derivation and associates them with performance improvements in AOPs. Besides, the related mechanisms are also discussed respectively by distinguishing the functional sites in different systems.									15	0	0	0	4	0	15			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000663714700005

In this review, we firstly discuss the extreme flexibilities of oxide perovskites in terms of their structures and compositions, which lead to a treasure trove of materials for diverse applications. Secondly, the current status of their applications and challenges in EC, PC and PV are reviewed.

Herein, with N as the primary dopant, B, F, P, and S as the secondary heteroatoms are introduced into porous carbons respectively to investigate their electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) performance. The promoting effect of B, F, P, and S to N-doped carbons for NRR is different from the experimental evolution and analysis. In there, N,B-codoping of porous carbon has the greatest promotional effect in NRR. The electronic structure of these doped carbons determines the electrocatalytic activity. For instance, with the presence of B dopant, the fabricated N-doped materials exhibit a higher content of pyridinic-N. Further systematic and controlled experiments demonstrate that the presence of B element facilitates the formation of B-N bonds, thus boosting NRR activity. From in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic findings, this N,B dual-doped carbons follow the associative mechanism during NRR process.									67	6	0	0	2	0	70			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000517665200024

A majority of published studies agree on superior electrochemical performance of disordered LNMO, but the underlying reasons for improvement remain unclear due to the fact that different thermal history of the samples affects other material properties such as oxygen content and particle morphology. In this study, ordered and disordered samples were prepared with a new strategy that renders samples with identical properties apart from their cation ordering degree. This was achieved by heat treatment of powders under pure oxygen atmosphere at high temperature with a final annealing step at 710 degrees C for both samples, followed by slow or fast cooling. Electrochemical testing showed that cation disordering improves the stability of material in charged (delithiated) state and mitigates the impedance rise in LNMO parallel to LTO (Li4Ti5O12) and LNMO parallel to Li cells. Through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), thicker surface films were observed on the ordered material, indicating more electrolyte side reactions. The ordered samples also showed significant changes in the Ni 2p XPS spectra, while the generation of ligand (oxygen) holes was observed in the Ni-O environment for both samples using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS). Moreover, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images indicated that the ordered samples show a decrease in ordering near the particle surface after cycling and a tendency toward rock-salt-like phase transformations. These results show that the structural arrangement of Mn/Ni (alone) has an effect on the surface and "nearsurface" properties of LNMO, particularly in delithiated state, which is likely connected to the bulk electronic properties of this electrode material.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2574-0962			WOS:000543715100098		
J	Domej, Wolfgang; Oettl, Karl; Renner, Wilfried					Oettl, Karl/0000-0001-9792-5760			Oxidative stress and free radicals in COPD implications and relevance for treatment								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE				9				1207	1224		10.2147/COPD.S51226				2014	2014	Oxidative stress occurs when free radicals and other reactive species overwhelm the availability of antioxidants. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species, and their counterpart antioxidant agents are essential for physiological signaling and host defense, as well as for the evolution and persistence of inflammation. When their normal steady state is disturbed, imbalances between oxidants and antioxidants may provoke pathological reactions causing a range of nonrespiratory and respiratory diseases, particularly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In the respiratory system, ROS may be either exogenous from more or less inhalative gaseous or particulate agents such as air pollutants, cigarette smoke, ambient high-altitude hypoxia, and some occupational dusts, or endogenously generated in the context of defense mechanisms against such infectious pathogens as bacteria, viruses, or fungi. ROS may also damage body tissues depending on the amount and duration of exposure and may further act as triggers for enzymatically generated ROS released from respiratory, immune, and inflammatory cells. This paper focuses on the general relevance of free radicals for the development and progression of both COPD and pulmonary emphysema as well as novel perspectives on therapeutic options. Unfortunately, current treatment options do not suffice to prevent chronic airway inflammation and are not yet able to substantially alter the course of COPD. Effective therapeutic antioxidant measures are urgently needed to control and mitigate local as well as systemic oxygen bursts in COPD and other respiratory diseases. In addition to current therapeutic prospects and aspects of genomic medicine, trending research topics in COPD are presented.									182	10	1	0	106	2	199			1178-2005			WOS:000343291400001	25378921

Among numerous candidates, noble-metal-free Mo2C catalysts are favored because of their low cost, abundance and similar d-orbital electronic state to the state of the art platinum. However, due to the high empty d-orbital density of high-valence Mo species in Mo2C, the HER performance was impaired. We reason that introducing modulators into the Mo2C framework that could decrease the empty d-orbital density and valence states of Mo may be an efficient way to optimize the HER energetics. Herein, inspired by the versatile electronic structures of 3d metals, we carried out first principles calculations using 3d metal Co as a dopant of Mo2C to construct Co-Mo bimetallic carbide and found an enhanced HER activity after Co incorporation. We further synthesized a Co-Mo bimetallic carbide catalyst. The obtained catalysts achieved excellent alkaline HER performance with the lowest overpotential of -46 mV at -10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 46 mV dec(-1) and great stability without any decay after a 500 hour reaction. The X-ray adsorption spectroscopy study showed that the valence state of Mo was decreased by the Co dopant and we propose that the decrease of Mo valence states should be the reason for the better HER performance of the bimetallic carbide than bulk Mo2C.									39	0	0	0	1	0	39			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472219400005

We have studied electrochemical stability of a commercial Pd/C sample in an acidic electrolyte by exposing it to an accelerated stress test (AST) to mimic potential spikes in fuel cells and electrolyzers during start/stop events. AST consisted of extensive rapid potential cycling (5000 cycles, 1 V/s) in two potential regions, namely AST1 was performed between 0.4 and 1.4 V-RHE, while AST2 was performed between 0.05 and 1.4 V-RHE. Degradation of Pd/C was monitored by the changes in Pd electrochemical surface area, while the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was used as a test reaction to observe the corresponding impact of the degradation on the activity of Pd/C. Significant Pd/C degradation and HER activity loss were observed in both potential regions. Coupling of the electrochemical flow cell with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry device showed substantial Pd dissolution during both ASTs. Identical location scanning electron microscopy revealed that Pd dissolution is followed by redeposition during both ASTs, resulting in particle size growth. Particle size growth was seen as especially dramatic in the case of AST2, when particularly large Pd nanostructures were obtained on top of the catalyst layer. According to the results presented in this work, (in)stability of Pd/C and other Pd-based nanocatalysts should be studied systematically as it may present a key factor limiting their application in energy conversion devices.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000731156800001

These structures are dynamic and provide changes in the chemical environment and redox state of transition metal centers that result in drastic changes in the catalytic behavior. Inspired by these catalytic traits, porous polymers represent a versatile platform for preparing catalysts by anchoring metals to organic functional groups. Following this inspiration, we studied the structural evolution of a series of catalysts containing atomically dispersed Cu ions grafted onto imine-linked porous organic frameworks (IPOFs) during synthesis and reaction. Cu species were found to be bound to the imine or diiminopyridine units of IPOFs and to be active for oxidation of carbon monoxide. Combining X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (S) showed that the metal centers could gradually activate oxygen and change their oxidation state. Interestingly, depending on the type of functional group responsible for binding Cu, the active sites either reach a balanced redox turnover between Cu(I) and Cu(II) states or get poisoned by CO and locked at a Cu(I) state during reaction. Furthermore, samples with agglomerated Cu species were found to be redispersed upon contact with the reaction mixture, which promoted a high initial activity not seen in the original samples. Overall, our results show that catalytic sites in porous polymers can have very dynamic structures that are highly dependent on the polymer functional groups as well as reaction conditions and show how this strategy can be used to produce active catalysts with a wide range of possible compositions and chemistries.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900031

These enzymes catalyze some of the most important biological processes in nature, such as photosynthesis, respiration, water oxidation, molecular oxygen reduction, and nitrogen fixation. They are also among the most proficient catalysts in terms of their activity, selectivity, and ability to operate at mild conditions of temperature, pH, and pressure. In the absence of these enzymes, these reactions would proceed very slowly, if at all, suggesting that these enzymes made the way for the emergence of life as we know today. In this review, the structure and catalytic mechanism of a selection of diverse metalloenzymes that are involved in the production of highly reactive and unstable species, such as hydroxide anions, hydrides, radical species, and superoxide molecules are analyzed. The formation of such reaction intermediates is very difficult to occur under biological conditions and only a rationalized selection of a particular metal ion, coordinated to a very specific group of ligands, and immersed in specific proteins allows these reactions to proceed. Interestingly, different metal coordination spheres can be used to produce the same reactive and unstable species, although through a different chemistry. A selection of hand-picked examples of different metalloenzymes illustrating this diversity is provided and the participation of different metal ions in similar reactions (but involving different mechanism) is discussed.									11	0	0	0	6	0	11				1420-3049		WOS:000476700300116	31277490

However, the development of noble metal-free catalysts with high activity and selectivity is still a significant challenge. In this study, uniformly dispersed amorphous CoBx nanoparticles supported on carbon paper were synthesized via a simple wet chemical reduction method. As an efficient nitrate reduction electrocatalyst, CoBx exhibited a maximum faradaic efficiency of 94.00 +/- 1.67% and a yield rate of up to 0.787 +/- 0.028 mmol h(-1) cm(-2) for ammonia production. The enhanced NitRR performance could be attributed to a partial electron transfer from B to Co, which is necessary for optimizing the adsorption energies of the reaction intermediates and facilitating electron transport. Thus, selective and cost-effective electroreduction of nitrates to ammonia can be achieved using CoBx nanoparticles.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000824680500001	35833645

They are a subtype of molecular organic frameworks (MOFs), consisting of metal ions coordinated with imidazolate linkers. Their unique material properties, such as a highly porous nature and mechanical stability, have extended their utilization to many fields. In addition, one-dimensional (1D) fibrous materials are most habitually synthesised via the highly recommended electrospinning (ES) technique and are utilized for many applications because of their unique physicochemical properties. In this review, the utilization of ZIF-based materials and 1D fibrous materials in the field of electrocatalytic water splitting reactions is discussed, and we also propose new insights into the incorporation of ZIF-based materials into 1D fibrous networks, as well as elaborating on the advantages and challenges associated with this type of incorporation.									25	0	0	0	1	0	25			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000649740400001

In fact, oxidation and reduction reactions are fundamental for the transformation of cellular and external compounds both for cell reproduction and for energy production. Redox enzymes share a common characteristic that is the capacity of transferring electrons to and from molecules. In addition, microorganisms contain many oxidative enzymes, and because they are relatively easier to cultivate and study, they have been investigated in details, in particular for potential use in biotechnological field. One important reaction that oxidative enzymes perform is the introduction of one or two oxygen atoms on aromatic compounds. The most representative classes of enzymes that perform this reaction are oxygenases/hydroxylases, peroxidases, and laccases; they differ in many aspects: the metal present in the active site, the used reductive cofactor, the final oxidant, and the number of electrons transferred in each step. Their essential features and mechanisms of action have been the subject of several studies, together with some structural analyses. This review reports recent developments and summarizes some of the most interesting results concerning both structural requirements and mechanisms implicated in aromatic hydroxylation.									16	0	0	0	10	0	16			0175-7598	1432-0614		WOS:000291034200001	21523477

Among various surface modification strategies, nonthermal plasma technique possesses an irreplaceable role due to the merits of simple but controllable operation procedure, low pollution, low cost, and easy scale-up for practical applications. Nonthermal plasma treatment, as a powerful tool for material surface and structural engineering, can mainly benefit the electrocatalytic reactions in the following aspects: surface atom doping or reconstructing, introducing vacancies or defects, surface partially reducing or oxidizing, and increasing the porosity or roughness. Given to its flexibility, plasma modification is gaining a noticeable popularity, and great progress has been made in applying plasma for optimizing surface properties of the mainstream electrocatalysts, including metal-free carbon materials, metal oxides, and other compounds, as well as organometallic electrocatalysts, etc. This review first summarizes the recent advances in nonthermal plasma modification for achieving desirable electrocatalytic behaviors, aiming to highlight the cutting-edge function designs of electrocatalysts with plasma technology. It is hoped that this work can give some inspiration for the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000827186300001

In this study, choline chloride (ChCl) DESs were successfully synthesized via hydrogen-bonding networks of urea and thiourea as the hydrogen bond donors (HBDs). The as-synthesized ChCl-urea and ChCl-thiourea DESs had excellent thermal stability and displayed good lubrication between steel/steel tribo-pairs. The friction coefficient and wear rate of ChCl-thiourea DES were 50.1% and 80.6%, respectively, lower than those of ChCl-urea DES for GCr15/45 steel tribo-pairs. However, for GCr15/Q45 steel, ChCl-urea DES decreased the wear rate by 85.0% in comparison to ChCl-thiourea DES. Under ChCl-thiourea DES lubrication, the tribo-chemical reaction film composed of FeS formed at the interfaces and contributed to low friction and wear. However, under high von Mises stress, the film could not be stably retained and serious wear was obtained through direct contact of friction pairs. This illustrated that the evolution of the tribo-chemical reaction film was responsible for the anti-friction and anti-wear properties of the DESs.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2223-7690	2223-7704		WOS:000787118300001

Here, we demonstrate a route where electrochemical processing of scrap metals extracts catalytic species to the surface that actively convert CO, scavenged from the atmosphere to form multiwalled carbon nanotubes (M-VVCNTs). Our findings demonstrate two distinct pathways for this technique that is generalizable to a broad range of scrap metals. First is the case where the catalytic elements are the primary constituents of the material (e.g., Fe in stainless steel) and the reaction with CO, consumes the material. Second is the case where the catalytic elements are impurities (e.g., Fe in brass) where reaction with CO, leads to impurity consumption. Our results demonstrate facile growth of MWCNTs directly from irregular scraps, such as shavings and pipes. Overall, this study presents a route where input sources of atmospheric CO, and low-value metal scraps can be transformed to higher valued purified metals and high valued MWCNTs with the promise of an overall carbon negative capture and conversion strategy.									19	1	0	0	1	0	20			2168-0485			WOS:000407410900082

In this work, we show how these techniques could be applied to study Glioblastoma, the deadliest and most frequent primary brain tumor. In particular, we study Glioblastoma invasion using the recent concept of Physically-Guided Neural Networks with Internal Variables (PGNNIV), able to combine data obtained from microfluidic devices and some physical knowledge governing the tumor evolution. The physics is introduced by means of nonlinear advection-diffusion-reaction partial differential equation that models the Glioblastoma evolution for defining the network structure. On the other hand, multilayer perceptrons combined with a nodal deconvolution technique are used for learning the go or grow metabolic behavior which characterises the Glioblastoma invasion. The PGNNIV is here trained using synthetic data obtained from in silico tests created under different oxygenation conditions, using a previously validated model. The unravelling capacity of PGNNIV enables discovering complex metabolic processes in a non-parametric way, thus giving explanatory capacity to the networks, and, as a consequence, surpassing the predictive power of any parametric approach and for any kind of stimulus. Besides, the possibility of working, for a particular tumor, with different boundary and initial conditions, permits the use of PGNNIV for defining virtual therapies and for drug design, thus making the first steps towards in silico personalised medicine.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1553-734X	1553-7358		WOS:000788729400002	35377875

The nuclear magnetic resonance, thermogravimetric analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results of unhydrolyzed oxidized graphite indicate that the oxidation process involves the intercalating oxidation, where electrically neutral species is the oxidizing agent, and the diffusive-oxidation, where MnO3+ is the oxidizing agent. An intrinsic formation and conversion path of oxygen-containing functional groups is proposed based on the experimental results and further interpreted with the aid of frontier molecular orbital theory and density functional theory. Meanwhile, the two unique features of the oxidation process of graphite, the chemistry stability of oxygen-containing functional groups in the strong oxidizing medium, and the self-regulation of the oxidation process are theoretically reasoned.									22	1	0	0	4	0	22			2470-1343			WOS:000517796000029	32118154

One way to handle the problems related to the OER is to use other oxidative reactions by so-called coupled water electrolysis. One option is the SO2 oxidation reaction (SO2OR), a process that generates H2SO4, which has industrial use, by the consumption of an abundant pollutant that demands, under standard conditions, 0.70 V less than the OER according to theoretical predictions. On the basis of theoretical calculations the mechanism is expected to be the same for a range of metallic catalysts, with the best ones being Pt and Au, in order. Here, the SO2 electro-oxidation on Pt and Au electrodes was investigated by in situ infrared reflection-absorption (IRRA) spectroelectrochemistry, aiming to elucidate the mechanism. On Pt, species such as dithionate, S2O62-, not commonly cited in the literature, were found as intermediates, and PtOH and PtO were suggested as oxidative species. On Au electrodes, the situation observed was completely different. The electrolyte chaotropicity strongly influenced the adsorption of SO2 on Au, changing from Au-O for highly kosmotropic media to Au-S for more chaotropic systems. When the Au-S bond is formed, dithionate and S(2)O(6)(2-)species were simultaneously present along with the Au(SO3) complex in solution. The observation of these two species was accompanied by potential oscillations, and an HN-NDR (hidden N-shaped negative differential resistor) oscillator was observed. Different mechanisms for different electrolytes are proposed for Au electrodes.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000485090400047

Compounds 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7 gave oxidative-addition products 8-12, while compounds 3 and 6 gave no detectable reaction. Kinetic analysis showed three discrete reactions: an initial fast, second-order (first-order in both bromine and substrate) reaction to give an association complex followed by two consecutive first-order processes to give the final products. Single-crystal, X-ray crystallographic analysis of 14 [from the addition of bromine to 2-((dimethylamino)methyl)phenyl phenyl telluride] was indicative of an ionic structure. The addition of tetra-n-butylammonium bromide to 8 and 9 gave the corresponding diphenyl chalcogenides 1 and 2, respectively, and Br3-. Heating crystals of 8 under nitrogen gave melting and gas evolution. The residue was identified as diphenyl selenide (1). The data are consistent with multiple, reversible steps in oxidative addition involving entropy-controlled association, ionic dissociation and recombination, and slow conversion of a product mixture of kinetic control to a product mixture of thermodynamic control.									45	0	0	0	5	0	45			0276-7333			WOS:A1994PC14000053

In this study, low-PGM Ni100-xRhx electrocatalysts, seldomly studied as alkaline HOR catalysts, with various compositions are fabricated via electrodeposition. Substantial changes are observed in both the morphology and crystalline structure of the catalysts when Ni is alloyed with Rh, such as enlarged surface area and development of different textures. The HOR activities of Ni100-xRhx catalysts evaluated in 0.1 M KOH solution are dramatically enhanced because of the enlarged surface area, bifunctional roles of H-providing sites (Ni/Rh) and OH-providing sites (Ni[OH](2)/Rh2O3), and their balanced composition on the surface. The durability of Ni89Rh11, the most appropriate catalyst, is investigated with the 3000 potential cycling, giving the average decay rate of approximately 0.30 mu A cm(-2)/cycle. The origin of enhanced activity and degradation during durability test was explained in terms of the electronic structures and surface composition of the catalysts. The initial high HOR activity of about 1.5 mA/cm(2) for Ni89Rh11 at 0.05 V-RHE, though it requires a further improvement in the durability, suggests the practical feasibility of it as a low PGM alkaline HOR catalyst.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000585886200001

The negative band at 1404 cm-1 in the difference spectra exhibited the same temperature dependence as the S2 formation in the oxygen-evolving center previously determined by EPR spectroscopy (De Paula, J.C., Innes, J.B. and Brudvig, G.W. (1985) Biochemistry 24, 8114-8120). This observation strongly supports our previous assignment of the 1404 cm-1 band to the structural change of proteins upon the S1 --> S2 transition (Noguchi, T., Ono, T. and Inoue, Y. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 5953-5956). The temperature dependence of the 1660 cm-1 band due to cytochrome b559 (Cyt b559) oxidation has shown a complementary relationship to that of the 1404 cm-1 band, consistent with the view that the oxidation of Cyt b559 competes with the S2 formation on the electron-donor side of PS II. The present FTIR data also suggest that the structural difference between the two S2 states exhibiting the g = 4.1 EPR signal and the multiline signal is not very large as far as the protein moiety around the Mn cluster responsible for the 1404 cm-1 band is concerned.									33	0	0	0	23	0	33			0006-3002			WOS:A1993LP97300009

Core-shell PtNi-Ni nanoparticles' evolution was investigated using in situ liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A two-stage growth of core-shell PtNi-Ni nanoparticles was observed. The platinum (Pt)-based binary alloy was formed initially by a thermodynamically driven process, then grown by a monomer attachment process, and then the core formed and the process was stopped by depletion of the Pt precursor, and finally the nickel (Ni) shell formed. This growth process gives a way to grow a metallic shell for novel catalysts.									10	1	0	0	2	0	10			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000436133400002	29881854	
J	Rivaton, A; Gardette, JL								Photo-oxidation of aromatic polymers								ANGEWANDTE MAKROMOLEKULARE CHEMIE				262				173	188						DEC 1998	1998	The photodegradation of aromatic polymers involves several distinctive reactions both direct photolytic pathways and photo-oxidative processes. To account for such a complexity, reactivity of four aromatic polymers is detailed. The mechanisms of photochemical evolution were probed using various techniques such as FTIR and UV spectroscopies, chemical derivatization reactions, physical treatments of irradiated films and mass spectrometric analysis of the low molecular weight fragments. A dual photochemistry, largely dependent upon the spectral distribution of the excitation light source, is well evidenced with bisphenol-A polycarbonate (PC). Excitation of PC at short wavelengths involves two consecutive photo-Fries rearrangements of the aromatic carbonate units; on irradiation at long wavelengths, photoproducts are shown to result from the photo-induced oxidation on the side chain and from the phenyl rings oxidation. The photo-oxidation of poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) largely involves pure photolytic pathways; on the opposite, the dominant photo-oxidative pathway of phenoxy resins (PR) is attributed to the high oxidizability of methylene groups in a-position to the oxygen atom of the ether groups. It is shown at last that the photo-oxidation of poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) (PPO) largely involves the oxidation of phenyl rings.					20th International Conference on Advances in the Stabilization and Degradation of Polymers20th International Conference on Advances in the Stabilization and Degradation of Polymers	JUN 10-12, 1998JUN 10-12, 1998		LUZERN, SWITZERLANDLUZERN, SWITZERLAND	59	1	0	0	9	0	59			0003-3146			WOS:000077914600017

In the present study, by coating similar to 3 nm MoSx on nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) pre-engrafted on a flexible carbon cloth (MNG) as a model system, an extremely low Tafel slope of 39.6 mV dec(-1) with cyclic stability up to 5000 cycles is obtained. The specific fraction of N on the NG framework is also analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy with synchrotron radiation light sources, and it is found that the MoSx particles are selectively positioned on the specific graphitic N sites, forming the unique Mo-N-C bonding state. This Mo-N-C bonding is founded to facilitate highly effective charge transfer directly to the active sulfur sites on the edges of MoSx, leading to a highly improved hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with excellent stability (95% retention @5000 cycles). The functional anchoring of MoSx by such bonding prevents particle aggregation, which plays a significant role in maintaining the stability and activity of the catalyst. Furthermore, it has been revealed that MNG samples with adequately high amounts of both pyridinic and graphitic N result in the best HER performance. This work helps in understanding the mechanisms and bonding interactions within various catalysts and the scaffold electrode.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000558792700033	32644795

In response to anaerobiosis or in a respiration defective context, the photosynthetic electron transport chain of Chlamydomonas is remodeled by a state transition process to a conformation that favours the photoproduction of ATP at the expense of reductant synthesis. In some unicellular green algae including Chlamydomonas, anoxia also triggers the induction of a chloroplast-located, oxygen sensitive hydrogenase, which accepts electrons from reduced ferredoxin to convert protons into molecular hydrogen. Although microalgal hydrogen evolution has received much interest for its biotechnological potential, its physiological role remains unclear. By using specific Chlamydomonas mutants, we demonstrate that the state transition ability and the hydrogenase function are both critical for induction of photosynthesis in anoxia. These two processes are thus important for survival of the cells when they are transiently placed in an anaerobic environment.									33	0	1	0	25	0	35			1932-6203			WOS:000319435600048	23717558

Herein, we report an S-scheme heterojunction with tunable oxygen vacancies (Vo) via in-situ growth of InVO4 nanobelts on protonated ultrathin C3N4 nanosheets (p-C3N4/InVO4) assisted by nitric acid for efficient CO2 photoreduction. The nitric acid plays three roles in the synthetic process: providing protonation sources for the pC(3)N(4), assisting the growth of InVO4 nanobelts on p-C3N4, and facilitating the formation of Vo in InVO4. Intriguingly, the Vo content is tuned by varying the amount of C3N4 which reduces free H+ concentration and increases the electron density around V in VO43-, leading to a tade-off effect on Vo formation and thus a volcano shaped evolution profile of Vo content. The introduction of Vo reduces the band gap of InVO4 and enhances the n-type conductivity, expediting the interfacial charge transfer in terms of the S-scheme pathway. Besides, the protonation of C3N4 improves electrical conductivity, promotes the adsorption and activation of CO2 molecules, and thermodynamically favours the conversion to CO. Due to the composite effect of Vo and protonation in the S scheme system, the optimized p-C3N4/InVO4 hetero-nanosheet displays dramatically boosted photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity with a CO production rate of 14.05 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), 6.03 and 3.23 times higher than that of bare InVO4 and p-C3N4, respectively. This work provides new platforms for the development of efficient photo catalysts by integrated refining of structure defects and surface modification in constructing heterostructures.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000813390600002		
J	Exner, Kai S.								A Universal Descriptor for the Screening of Electrode Materials for Multiple-Electron Processes: Beyond the Thermodynamic Overpotential								ACS CATALYSIS				10	21			12607	12617		10.1021/acscatal.0c03865				NOV 6 2020	2020	On the way toward a sustainable energy economy, electrode materials that do not contain scarce noble metals need to be developed. Operating at low computational costs, material screening is a powerful tool to assess the performance of potential electrode compositions by categorizing materials into active and inactive. Most commonly, linear scaling relationships are analyzed by the construction of a volcano plot, in which the thermodynamic overpotential, eta(TD), serves as activity descriptor. Even if this descriptor identifies the majority of active electrode materials, it has been reported that eta(TD) lacks thorough sorting of catalysts according to their activity. This failure is mainly related to the fact that eta(TD) is defined by a single free-energy change (thermodynamics), whereas the applied overpotential and kinetics are not factored in the analysis. Based on the discussion of free-energy diagrams and the rate-determining reaction step, this Viewpoint introduces an alternate activity descriptor, G(max)(eta), for multiple-electron processes, thereby including the applied overpotential and kinetic effects in the evaluation. On the example of the oxygen evolution reaction, the application of G(max)(eta) for the screening and optimization of electrode materials is discussed, providing a different perspective compared with the conventional scheme of eta(TD).									41	0	0	0	4	0	41			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900024

However, bare CeO(2)shows poor photocatalytic performance under visible-light irradiation because it absorbs only UV light that leads to fast recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Therefore, surface modification can be one of the effective strategies to improve the visible-light absorption and reduce the recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers. Herein, a series of CeO2/polydopamine (CeO2@PDA) composites were successfully fabricated by the polymerization of dopamine on the surface of CeO2. Our results demonstrated that the surface modification of CeO(2)by a small amount of PDA could effectively inhibit the photocatalytic reaction; this not only promoted the photoelectron injection and reduced the charge recombination rate, but also controlled the overgrowth of Pt cocatalyst. As compared to bare CeO2, CeO2@PDA shows remarkable photocatalytic hydrogen production performance. This composite also presents good durability and stability for the photocatalytic hydrogen production reaction. Thus, this study provides a new insight into the preparation of CeO(2)composites with effective solar energy conversion.									8	1	0	0	2	0	8			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000569368500046

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to study the thermochemistry of cathode reaction so as to construct the free energy profile and to predict the required onset potential via the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. Stability of the surface vacancy as well as the poisoning possibility of these catalysts under operating conditions are also investigated towards catalyst engineering for sustainable ammonia formation. The most promising candidates turned out to be the (100) facets of rocksalt structure of VN, CrN, NbN and ZrN that should be able to form ammonia at -0.51 V, -0.76 V, -0.65 V and -0.76 V vs. SHE, respectively. Another interesting result of the current work is that for the introduced nitride candidates, hydrogen evolution is no longer the competing reaction; thus, high formation yield of ammonia is expected at low onset potentials.					15th Annual International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS)15th Annual International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS)	JUN 01-03, 2015JUN 01-03, 2015	Elsevier; Univ Amsterdam; NTU Singapore; Univ TennesseeElsevier; Univ Amsterdam; NTU Singapore; Univ Tennessee	Reykjavik Univ, Reykjavik, ICELANDReykjavik Univ, Reykjavik, ICELAND	38	2	0	0	2	0	39			1877-0509		*****************	WOS:000373939100194

The experimental impedance diagrams, with two time constants, have been explained by means of an equivalent circuit considering the electrode porosity and the kinetics of hydrogen reaction. No significant diffusion effects have been detected in the Nyquist diagrams up to about the mHz. The dependence of the exchange current density on the OH- ion concentration and hydrogen partial pressure has been interpreted on the basis of a Tafel-Volmer mechanism, with the Tafel reaction as the slowest step, in agreement with previous work in which kinetic data were obtained from linear sweep voltammetry. The apparent activation energies determined from the Arrhenius plots of the exchange current densities correspond to the hydrogen reaction on Pt(100) faces, in agreement with a cubo-octahedral structure of the Pt nanoparticles.

For the model, reactions kinetics rate constants were evaluated by obtaining the reaction product solid mass of the various species through time using an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM). To obtain a mathematical model of the electrodeposition using Ansys CFX 2D simulation software, the reaction kinetics rates were used to calculate mass transfer in the volume closest to the surface. The model was applied to the experimental electrodeposition conditions to validate its accuracy. Dense wurtzite nanostructures with controlled morphology were obtained on a indium-doped tin-oxide (ITO) glass. Sample characterization was performed using high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on focused ion beam milled (FIBed) sheets from wurtzite mono-crystals. Average crystallite size was evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using the Scherrer equation, and superficial areas were evaluated by Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) method. Through the experimental results, a chemical model was developed for the competing reactions based on the speciation of zinc considering pH evolution, and kinetic constants, on the oxygen rich aqueous environment. Owing to the model, an accurate prediction of thickness and type of electrodeposited layers, under given conditions, is achieved. This allows an excellent control of the optical properties of Wurtzite as a photon absorber, for an efficient separation of the electron-hole pair for conduction of the electric charges formed. The large surface area, and small wurtzite crystallites evenly distributed on the thin film electrodeposited over the ITO conductive layer are promising features for later dye-sensitized photovoltaic cell production.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2079-4991		WOS:000778586700001	35215048

Their unique configuration and attractive properties make HEAs one of the most promising catalysts. Although a very limited amount of work has been reported, higher activities of HEAs than traditional catalysts have been confirmed. This review firstly summarizes the current synthetic methods of nanostructured HEA catalysts. Then, four core effects of HEAs, namely high entropy, cocktail effect, lattice distortion and sluggish diffusion, are briefly introduced, and their impacts on the catalytic properties of HEAs are highlighted. The research progress in the application of HEAs in heterogeneous catalysis is subsequently reviewed from the perspectives of both theory and experiment. The relationships among metastable microstructures, substitution effects (i.e. strain, ligand and ensemble effects) and d-band center are discussed in detail, and their impacts on the adsorption energy of intermediates in catalytic reactions are emphasized. We conclude the review with the discussion of the challenges and opportunities of HEA catalysts. Several directions of future HEA research are put forward. The review provides a valuable resource for those interested in these exciting catalytic materials.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000674442200001

This new procedure has provided the first opportunity to quantitatively investigate the kinetics of halogen-OH exchange reactions at subsolidus conditions. Hand-picked, chemically homogeneous tremolite crystals were exposed to either F-rich or F-poor fluids at temperatures ranging from 500-800 degrees C at 200 MPa (2000 bars), and the resulting concentration profiles were measured with either an electron microprobe or an ion microprobe. Critical to this procedure is the use of an aqueous silica-buffering assemblage (either quartz or forsterite + diopside + tremolite) in order to maintain the chemical and physical stability of the exposed crystal surfaces. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) photomicrographs taken before and after hydrothermal treatment show no evidence of dissolution reactions, consistent with a diffusion-controlled exchange process. For temperatures between 500 and 800 degrees C, the Arrhenius relations for diffusion parallel to the c-crystallographic direction have an activation energy (Q) = 41 (+/- 5) kJ/mole and (D-0) = 3.4((+4.1)(-1.9)) X 10(-17) m(2)/s. Transport rates parallel and perpendicular to the c-axis are the same within the estimated uncertainties. Calculations indicate that F metasomatism by volume diffusion in amphiboles is relatively slow and may only play an important role in the evolution of a given hydrothermal system in the absence of faster processes such as chemical reaction. Knowledge of the Arrhenius relationships for F-OH interdiffusion allows one to extract information about the maximum duration of metasomatic or thermal events from F-zoned amphiboles. This procedure can be adapted to the study of other halogen-Ga exchange reactions provided that the mineral stability is controlled by the dissolution of silica.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0016-7037			WOS:A1995RV07500008

The design and development of low-cost high-performance catalysts with high activity, high selectivity, high stability and significant suppress of hydrogen evolution reaction(HER) is the key to the CO2RR research. On the other hand, single atomic catalysts (SACs), due to their unique electronic and geometric structures, exhibit unusual catalytic activity for many important chemical reactions, such as CO oxidation, hydrogenation, OER, ORR, HER, etc., and have attracted extensive attention. Inspired by the profound progress, very recently, N-doped porous carbon support transition metal single atomic materials(M-N-C) have been employed in CO2RR research. The results manifest that M-N-C catalytic materials have exciting prospects for CO2RR, and are expected to be a substitute for precious metal(Au, Ag) catalysts for CO2 reduction in electrolyte aqueous media. This review is focused on fabrications, electrocatalytic performance and MNx active sites of M-N-C SACs used in electrochemical CO2RR. Finally, the problems remaining to be solved are summarized, and future research aspects and new ideas are prospected.									3	2	0	0	1	0	5			1005-281X			WOS:000478690000002

In this study, we performed first principles molecular dynamics simulations to understand the water-splitting reaction on a bi-layer BP surface. We focused on the site-specific aqueous reactivity of the buckled surface. A difference in the axis-dependent reactivity is observed owing to edge defects and exposed sites. Thus, we believe that BP edges, which significantly affect the interfacial water or organic solvent molecules, must exhibit very different edge-dependent reactivity. Experiments suggested the increasing catalytic efficiency of undisturbed BP in the order bulk, few-layered BP, and BP quantum dots. We choose three active sites to investigate the mechanistic details of the OER: the zigzag (ZZ), armchair (AC), and bulk sites. This study will provide insight into the enhanced catalytic activity when more edges are exposed as the active surface. We hope to clarify the reactive pathway in an aqueous solution supported by bi-layer BP by exploring the two different mechanisms for forming the OOH* complex. We explore and report two mechanisms: a simple push-pull reaction for oxygen-oxygen bond formation, the nucleophilic attack by formed OH- and an attack by a water molecule. The free energy barriers procured for mechanism 1 taking place at the zigzag, armchair, and bulk sites are 7.59 +/- 0.33, 9.04 +/- 0.01, and 12.80 +/- 0.09 kcal mol(-1), respectively. For mechanism 2 the free energy barriers are 7.62 +/- 0.11, 9.15 +/- 0.16, and 11.63 +/- 0.11 kcal mol(-1) for the ZZ, AC, and bulk sites. The interlink between both the mechanisms is established concerning the reported free energy barriers for OOH* formation. The ZZ site is found to lower the activation barrier for the rate-determining step, followed by the AC and bulk.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000742393000001	35029266

In this work, a 1-D transient model of the combustion of single coal particles with soot evolution was proposed and validated in both O-2/N-2 and O-2/CO2 atmospheres. Gasification reactions of tar and soot were included in the soot-relevant reaction pathways, and the reaction rates were compared quantitatively to reveal controlling processes affecting soot behaviors. The results show that the predicted soot volume fraction decreases apparently in O-2/CO2 environments when soot gasification and tar gasification are considered. The effect of tar gasification is more important than that of soot gasification. However, in O-2/N-2 environments, both soot gasification and tar gasification barely affect the predicted soot volume fraction. The decrease in soot volume fraction at the late stage of volatiles combustion is predominantly attributable to soot diffusion from the fuel-rich zone near the particle surface to the outer boundary rather than an actual decrease in soot yield. Among all soot-relevant reaction pathways proposed in the simulation, the controlling processes affecting soot yields in O-2/N-2 and O-2/CO2 atmospheres include soot formation, tar oxidization, and tar gasification. Finally, the effects of temperature and oxygen concentration on soot yields in O-2/N-2 and O-2/CO2 atmospheres are discussed.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000465486100093

As a subfamily of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) possess the characteristics of both MOFs and zeolites, showing highly porous structures, large surface area, and open catalytic active sites. This review presents materials design strategies for constructing improved electrocatalysts based on ZIF precursors/templates, with special emphasis on the varieties of derivatives, controllable building of active sites, the construction of macroscopic structure, and the favored electrocatalytic reactions based on these materials. These ZIF-derived N-doped carbon-based composites or compounds have exhibited remarkable activity and stability for a broad electrocatalysis application, displaying great potential to replace noble-metal-based catalysts. The challenges and perspectives regarding ZIF-derived electrocatalysts are also discussed for better development of ZIF-derived electrocatalysts.									170	13	0	0	12	0	173			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000443674100019

In this article, we report an easy and effective soft-template method to in situ assemble Fe2N nanoparticles on the surface of N-doped graphene-like carbon (NC). The prepared Fe2N nanoparticles were covered by a few carbon layers, which promoted the connection of Fe-N-X clusters with graphene to facilitate the formation of Fe-N-C active sites. Fe-N-X and NC units were found to respectively fulfill different functionalities, and commonly afford the sample with excellent performance. The electrochemical data show that the Fe2N@NC composite with high-purity and good crystalline displays a synergistic enhanced catalytic activity for ORR, including a positive onset potential (0.084 V), a half-wave potential (-0.036 V) and a high electron transfer number (similar to 4e(-)), as compared to 20% Pt/C. Additionally, the existence of carbon shells wrapped around Fe2N nanoparticles can restrain their expansion and dissolution. In addition, the as-prepared catalyst was implemented as an air catalyst for zinc-air batteries and was found to display a comparable open circuit voltage of ca. 1.48 V and a maximum power density of 82.3 mW cm(-2). These results demonstrate that the Fe2N@NC catalyst may serve as a good alternative to precious Pt for ORR in practical applications.									41	3	0	0	1	0	41			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000417706600023

The favorable reaction kinetics of sulfur species is a key prerequisite for pursuing their commercialization. Recent years have witnessed a wealth of investigations in terms of boosting sulfur redox via rationalizing redox mediators. Defect engineering, which allows for the effective exposure of active sites and optimization of electronic structure, has emerged expeditiously as an essential strategy to enhance polysulfide modulation, and hence expedite Li-S chemistry. Nevertheless, a comprehensive overview of defect engineering in Li-S realm is still lacking. This review emphasizes the recent advances in the rational design and polysulfide modulation strategies of different types of defective mediators. Their unique morphological configuration, superb electrochemical activity, and underlying catalytic mechanism are comprehensively summarized, aiming to deepen the understanding of defect-mediated Li-S chemistry. Moreover, in situ evolution of defective mediators is discussed to identify the true active sites under aprotic reaction conditions. Opportunities and an outlook of this fast-developing frontier that may lead to practical implementations of Li-S batteries are proposed.									64	1	0	0	0	0	64			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000647985600001

One of the most important regulations is keeping the reaction center chlorophyll (P700) of photosystem I in its oxidized form in excess light conditions. The oxidation of P700 is supported by dissipating excess electrons safely to O-2, and we previously found that the molecular mechanism of the alternative electron sink is changed from flavodiiron proteins (FLV) to photorespiration in the evolutionary history from cyanobacteria to plants. However, the overall picture of the regulation of photosynthetic electron transport is still not clear in bryophytes, the evolutionary intermediates. Here, we investigated the physiological roles of FLV and photorespiration for P700 oxidation in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha by using the mutants deficient in FLV (flv1) at different O-2 partial pressures. The effective quantum yield of photosystem II significantly decreased at 2kPa O-2 in flv1, indicating that photorespiration functions as the electron sink. Nevertheless, it was clear from the phenotype of flv1 that FLV was dominant for P700 oxidation in M. polymorpha. These data suggested that photorespiration has yet not replaced FLV in functioning for P700 oxidation in the basal land plant probably because of the lower contribution to lumen acidification, compared with FLV, as reflected in the results of electrochromic shift analysis.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1664-462X			WOS:000724181000001	34489990

It is known that protein phosphorylation controls the repair cycle of Photosystem II. However, it is not known how protein phosphorylation affects the partial electron transport reactions in PS II. Here we have applied variable fluorescence measurements and EPR spectroscopy to probe the status of the quinone acceptors, the Mn cluster and other electron transfer components in PS II with controlled levels of protein phosphorylation. Protein phosphorylation was induced in vivo by varying illumination regimes. The phosphorylation level of the D1 protein varied from 10 to 58% in PS II membranes isolated from pre-illuminated spinach leaves. The oxygen evolution and Q(A)(-) to Q(B)(Q(B)(-)) electron transfer measured by flash-induced fluorescence decay remained similar in all samples studied. Similar measurements in the presence of DCMU, which reports on the status of the donor side in PS II, also indicated that the integrity of the oxygen-evolving complex was preserved in PS II with different levels of D1 protein phosphorylation. With EPR spectroscopy we examined individual redox cofactors in PS II. Both the maximal amplitude of the charge separation reaction (measured as photo-accumulated pheophytin(-)) and the EPR signal from the Q(A)(-) Fe2+ complex were unaffected by the phosphorylation of the D1 protein, indicating that the acceptor side of PS II was not modified. Also the shape of the S-2 state multiline signal was similar, suggesting that the structure of the Mn-cluster in Photosystem II did not change. However, the amplitude of the S-2 multiline signal was reduced by 35% in PS II, where 58% of the D1 protein was phosphorylated, as compared to the S-2 multiline in PS II, where only 10% of the D1 protein was phosphorylated. In addition, the fraction of low potential Cyt b(559) was twice as high in phosphorylated PS II. Implications from these findings, were precise quantification of D1 protein phosphorylation is, for the first time, combined with high-resolution biophysical measurements, are discussed.									13	0	1	0	14	0	15			0166-8595			WOS:000178933000005	16228545

A simulation technique based on a Monte Carlo collision operator is developed to study the capture of externally injected ion beams in ion source plasmas. To illustrate the utility of the method, we have studied the dynamics of Ar1+ ions in oxygen plasma. Evolution of statistically averaged quantities such as the beam size, average directional velocity, and rms velocity is studied for various beam parameters. It is observed that the number of undamped particles and the steady state beam size increase with the increase in beam emittance. The simulation result indicates that the capture and thermalisation of the ion beam are affected by the kinetic energy and emittance of the beam.

Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is not usually considered as a promising material for these applications because of its chemical inertness and poor electronic conductivity. However, through physical and chemical modification, h-BN shows tuneable properties that make it interesting for energy conversion and storage. The excellent stability and environmentally benign nature make h-BN derived materials particularly attractive for green energy applications. In this review, we survey the studies on structural and chemical properties of functionalised h-BN materials as well as their energy-related applications. Research progress in energy conversion and utilisation such as electrochemical catalysis, photocatalysis, and selective oxidative dehydrogenation is reviewed. Energy storage applications including rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors, and hydrogen storage are also presented. Finally, we discuss the future and challenge for functionalised h-BN in energy conversion and storage.									44	0	0	0	3	0	44			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000553632500003

The dissociation of H-2 and subsequent formation of H2O have been considered to highlight the role of the metal structure and its underlying metal oxide support as a potential candidate as a catalyst to the above-mentioned reactions. The structural, energetic, electronic, and vibrational properties of all species involved in different reaction paths considered have been fully characterized. The cluster-oxide surface interface has been found to involve the reduction of up to 3Ce(4+) to CO3+, by direct electron transfer from the cluster to the oxide. When comparing the reducibility of the Ag-CeO2 and clean CeO2 systems, O vacancy formation has been found to be hindered along the perimeter of the cluster, while it is promoted underneath the cluster, and is almost unaffected on the surface sites close to the cluster. On the other hand, barriers for the H-2 dissociation and the formation of water by H and HO association are lowered with respect to the most favored reaction path found on clean CeO2. These results highlight the key role of metal structures and their underlying oxide support, and especially the three-phase boundary between the gas phase, Ag, and CeO2 as catalysts to such reactions, suggesting potential application as anodic electrocatalysts in fuel cells for example.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000492803300017

Phase composition, crystallographic orientation relationships (ORs) and dislocation loops were characterized using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy techniques. Proton-irradiation at elevated temperatures promoted the transformation of UN into uranium sesquinitride (U2N3) and UO2 phases. U2N3 and UO2 formed a fully coherent structure with two ORs: {002}U2N3 parallel to{002}UO2 and [001]U2N3 parallel to[001]UO2; U2N3{101}parallel to UO2{101} and U2N3[101]parallel to UO2[101] due to low lattice misfit (2.3%) and low interfacial energy (127 mJ/m(2)). Observed oxidation of UN and coherent interface are consistent with density-functional theory calculations which suggest lower energy for oxidized configuration and low energy of the interface. The dislocation loops grew while their number density decreased with the temperature and dose. The loop size was over three times larger in two nitride phases than that in UO2, while the number density was one order of magnitude higher in UO2 than in nitride phases. Loop density and diameter were analyzed using a kinetic rate theory that considers stoichiometric loop evolution. This analysis led to the conclusion in all compounds loop growth is governed by mobility of uranium interstitials, and enabled measurement of diffusion coefficients of uranium interstitials and non-metal interstitials and vacancies. This analysis provided a comparative study of early stage of microstructure evolution under irradiation which has implications for use of this mixture as advanced fuel in nuclear energy systems.

The confinement effects in NPM-based nanoparticles encapsulated in carbon nanoshells have been considered as an emerging and efficient way to special types of electrocatalysts which facilitate electrocatalytic activity and stability, even under rigorous conditions. This review focuses on the unique individual carbon encapsulation for high-performance design of NPM-based electrocatalysts, outlining all confinement synthesis methods, mechanistic studies on confinement effects, and the emerging practical reactions. It begins first introducing the synthetic methods for NPM-based core@carbon shell electrocatalysts, and then follows clarification of the relationship between the fundamental confinement effects and the performance improvement of carbon shell encapsulating NPM-based electrocatalysts. Further and detailed discussions on the alloying effect, doping effect, and heterojunction effect of the NPM-based core to alter the electronic situation which affects the electrocatalytic performance are subsequently provided. Finally, the review provides a perspective on challenges and opportunities in future research with respect to both in-depth theoretical research and potential design concept of such NPM-based core@carbon shell electrocatalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000736434900001

With increased current density of 1-16 mA cm(-2), the anodic removal of phenol pollutant was increased from 37.28% (k = 0.0039 min(-1)) to 96.44% (k = 0.028 min(-1)), and meanwhile the cathodic H-2 production was increased from 6.35 mL to 137.51 mL within 120-min electrolysis. The H-2 gas was recovered at a coulombic efficiency (CE) of 71.77-99.88% and energy efficiency (EE) of 10.48-22.74%. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) scan results confirmed the capability of aqueous [Fe(CN)(6)](4-/3-) redox couple to mediate electrolysis in the EO/C-BPE cell. This study provides a proof-in-concept demonstration of a spatially decoupled anodic oxidation and cathodic H-2 production, making electrochemical water purification more secure, more economical and more sustainable.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000504039300023

The deposition of nanoparticles produced by LED of bimetallic targets from alloyed or pressed metal powders provides the uniform distribution of both metals on the outer support surface; the metal ratio is similar to that in the original target. The catalytic behaviour of produced "core-shell" catalysts in comparison with monometallic analogues was tested in two model reactions: the CO oxidation with oxygen on NiPd catalysts supported on alumina and Sibunit; and thiophene oxidation with hydrogen peroxide on NiMo and NiW alumina supported catalysts. Novel LED bimetallic catalysts with extremely low metal content (0.005 %) were superior in terms of activity and stability to monometallic ones and the catalysts obtained by "wet" chemistry methods. Improved catalytic properties of bimetallic LED catalysts are related to the high density of single nanoparticles and the formation of active metal-oxide interfaces on the support surface.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000544708400001

The cyclic voltammetric anodic-cathodic peak separations for these nano-honeycomb electrodes were in the same range as those for polished polycrystalline diamond films, indicating that the involvement of the oxygen-terminated surface of the nano-pore walls, which should give rise to large peak separations for certain redox couples was only slight. Moreover, the peak currents in the CV were not enhanced to the extent expected on the basis of the roughness factors of the nano-honeycomb films. Ac impedance plots results indicated the existence of a concentration gradient of the reactant in the nano-pores, which is in agreement with theoretical predictions for charge transfer reactions in porous electrodes. The average concentration of the reactant (Fe2+/3+) inside the nanopores was a factor of ca. 80 lower than that in the bulk electrolyte. The results of the impedance analysis also indicated an increase in the reaction resistances with decreasing pore diameters. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Current Distortion and Performance Degradation by Dual-Phase Ohmic Drop Effects. Analysis and Remedies								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				120	38			21263	21271		10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b07013				SEP 29 2016	2016	In the active interest aroused by catalysis of electrochemical reactions, particularly molecule activation. related to modern energy challenges, mesoporous films deposited on electrodes are often, preferred to catalysts homogeneously dispersed in solution. Conduction, in the solid portion of the film and in the pores may strongly affect the characteristic catalytic Tafel plots, possibly leading to mechanistic misinterpretation and also degrade the catalytic performances. These ohmic drop effects take place, unlike those classically encountered with a massive electrode immersed in an electrolytic solution, in two different zones of the film, the solid bulk of the film and the pores, that are coupled together by a distributed capacitance and by the faradaic impedance representing the catalytic reaction located at their interface. A transmission line modeling allows the analysis of,the Capacitance charging responses as a function of only two dimensionless parameters in the framework of linear scan voltammetry: the ratio of the resistances in the two parts of the film and of the time-constant of the film. After validation with an experimental system consisting of an ionic polymer/carbon powder mixture, deposited on a. glassy carbon electrode and immersed in a strong electrolyte aqueous solution, a procedure is established that gives access the key-conduction parameters of the film. On these bases, and of the predicted current potential responses for fast catalytic reactions according to the same transition; line model, it is shown how the dual-phase ohmic drop effects can be gauged and compensated. Ensuing consequences on optimization of macroelectrolysis are finally discussed.									18	0	0	0	2	0	18			1932-7447			WOS:000384626800015

In this work, rice cultivar 'IIyou 084' seedlings were treated with NaHS, which is a donor of H2S, for 10 days, and its effects on growth and physiology, including photosynthesis, photorespiration, chlorophyll fluorescence, and stomata, were investigated. The data revealed that 0.01 mM of H2S improved rice biomass and chlorophyll content, while higher concentrations of H2S had an adverse effect on these parameters. Photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.39) activity also increased under 0.01 mM H2S treatment. However, photosynthetic oxygen evolution rate, photosynthetic electron transfer, and photochemical efficiency of PSII were not affected by H2S treatment. In addition, photosynthesis oxygen sensitivity, CO2 compensation point, and glycolate oxidase (EC 1.1.3.1) activity reduced by H2S treatment, and thus photorespiration was down-regulated. Under light, stomatal aperture and density increased by treatment with 0.01 mM H2S. On the basis of these results, it can be deduced that 0.01 mM of H2S treatment improved photosynthesis in rice by increasing its stomatal aperture and density, which may result from reduced photorespiration.									44	8	0	0	40	0	52			0167-6903	1573-5087		WOS:000349974200004

Hollow carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are considered promising electrocatalysts owing to their outstanding thermal stability, robust chemical properties, and high specific surface area. Herein, a convenient and controllable solid-phase route is proposed for the preparation of porous nitrogen (N) and boron (B) co-doped carbon nanotubes (NBCNT) by using tubular polypyrrole (PPy) and sodium tetraphenylboron ((C6H5)4BNa), in which (C6H5)4BNa serves not only as a B source but also as a pore-forming agent that can help to regulate N configuration and expose more active sites. Due to the synergistic effects of porous one-dimensional hollow structure and the binary heteroatom doping, the optimized NBCNT catalyst demonstrates superior catalytic performance for ORR in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. Moreover, Zn-air batteries are constructed based on the as-prepared catalysts, which reveal a high operating voltage (1.43 V) and peak power density (173.93 mW cm-2), further demonstrating a comparable electrocatalytic performance of the catalysts to commercial Pt/C catalyst. This work reveals a novel construction of high-efficiency and cost-effective metal-free catalysts for various energy conversion and storage technologies.									37	0	0	0	1	0	36			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000672572000003

Alternatively, H2O2 can be produced electrochemically via the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction, although the performance of the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts is insufficient to meet the demands for industrialization. Interestingly, guided by first-principles calculations, we found that the catalytic properties of the Co-N-4 moiety can be tailored by fine-tuning its surrounding atomic configuration to resemble the structure-dependent catalytic properties of metalloenzymes. Using this principle, we designed and synthesized a single-atom electrocatalyst that comprises an optimized Co-N-4 moiety incorporated in nitrogen-doped graphene for H2O2 production and exhibits a kinetic current density of 2.8 mA cm(-2) (at 0.65 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) and a mass activity of 155 A g(-1) (at 0.65 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) with negligible activity loss over 110 hours.Producing H2O2 electrochemically currently use electrocatalysts that are insufficient to meet the demands for industrialization. A single-atom electrocatalyst with an optimized Co-N4 moiety incorporated in nitrogen-doped graphene is shown to exhibit enhanced performance for H2O2 production.									333	15	0	0	31	0	337			1476-1122	1476-4660		WOS:000508172300004	31932671

This high resolution and sensitive absorption spectrometer opens a new window into the phenomena occurring within UFs. The approach extends the detection range to new electronic and rovibrational transitions within Laval flows and offers the possibility to probe numerous species which have not been investigated yet. This new tool has been designed to probe radicals and reaction intermediates but also to follow the chemistry of hydrocarbon chains and PAHs which play a crucial role in the evolution of astrophysical environments. For kinetics measurements, the UF-CRDS combines the CRESU technique (French acronym meaning reaction kinetics in uniform supersonic flows) with the SKaR (Simultaneous Kinetics and Ring-Down) approach where, as indicated by its name, the entire reaction is monitored during each intensity decay within the high finesse cavity. The setup and the approach are demonstrated with the study of the reaction between CN (v = 1) and propene at low temperature. The recorded data are finally consistent with a previous study of the same reaction for CN (v = 0) relying on the CRESU technique with laser induced fluorescence detection.

It has been found that production of CO2 is in all cases accompanied by evolution of hydrogen, the production rate of which is significantly enhanced, compared with that obtained in the absence of organic additives in solution. Results are explained by considering that organic compounds act as sacrificial electron donors, which become progressively oxidized toward CO2 by consuming photogenerated holes and/or oxygen. This results in decreased rates of electron-hole recombination and oxygen-hydrogen back reaction and, concomitantly, in increased H-2-production rates. The rate of photoinduced hydrogen production depends strongly on the concentration of the sacrificial agent employed and to a lesser extent on solution pH and temperature. When complete mineralization of the sacrificial agent is achieved, photogenerated oxygen can no longer be removed from the photocatalyst surface and the H-2-production rate drops to steady-state values, comparable to those obtained in the absence of the organic compound in solution. The amounts of carbon dioxide and "additional" hydrogen produced depend on the nature of the organic additive and are directly proportional to its initial concentration in solution. Quantification of results shows that the overall process may be described as "photoinduced reforming of organic compounds at room temperature". It is concluded that mineralization of organic pollutants such as alcohols and organic acids, which are common waste products of biomass processing industries, can be achieved with simultaneous production of H-2 fuel. The process may provide an efficient and cost effective method for cleaning up waste streams. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In all ablation spectra obtained, and for any particular size Sn-x core, the tin-rich clusters (SnO)(x)Sn+ were more abundant than the corresponding oxygen-equivalent clusters (SnO)(x)(+), while the oxygen-rich clusters (SnO)(x)O- were always more abundant than the oxygen-equivalent clusters (SnO)(x)(-). High yields of the ions (SnO)(1,3)Sn+, (SnO)(3,6)O- and (SnO)(-)(6) suggest high stabilities for these species. Low energy CID studies revealed that loss of neutral (SnO)(x) units is the preferred, and for most ions investigated the exclusive, dissociation pathway. Global minima for the smaller cations and anions are proposed on the basis of local density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Calculated dissociation energies for the neutral and charged clusters were found to compare well with effusion cell and FTICR results. DFT also predicts that, for any cluster with the same size Sn-x core, IE(SnO)(x)<IE(SnO)(x)Sn and EA(SnO)(x)O>EA(SnO)(x). A correlation between ion abundances and DFT heats of formation is evident, and the ground state geometries provide insight into the evolution of structural versus size trends. Without assistance from the calculations, erroneous conclusions regarding the structures of the experimentally-sampled clusters might have been drawn from the low energy CID results.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1040-7278	1572-8862		WOS:000175715300001

Two-dimensional (2D) MXene-based electrocatalysts hold tremendous potential for the applications of hydrogen fuel cell and water electrolyzer. Here, we successfully immobilized transition-metalbased NiMo nanoparticles (NPs) on 2D Ti3C2Tx (Tx: surface terminations, such as O, OH, or F) surfaces by a wet chemical method. Our results demonstrate that the NiMo NPs are monodispersed on Ti3C2Tx with surface functionalization. These monodisperse NPs resulted in superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activities in an alkaline media. The NiMo NPs/Ti3C2Tx in 1.0 M KOH yielded an HER current of -10 mA cm(-2) at -0.044 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), nearly 232 mV smaller than that of the parent NiMo NPs. The NiMo NPs/Ti3C2Tx produced an HOR current density of 1.5 mA cm(-2) at 0.1 V vs RHE. Density functional theory (DFT) results further reveal that Ti3C2Tx support can facilitate the charge transfer to metallic NPs and tailor the electronic structure of catalytic sites, resulting in optimized adsorption free energies of H* species for hydrogen electrochemistry. This work provides a facile and universal strategy in the development of 2D Ti3C2Tx with nonprecious metals for low-cost bifunctional hydrogen electrocatalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1948-7185			WOS:000753949700018	34784226

A better understanding of fluid flows within and out of the subducting slab is fundamental to unravel the role of fluids during burial. In this study, major and trace element geochemistry combined with oxygen isotopes were used to investigate metasediments and eclogites from the Sesia Zone in order to reconstruct the effect of internal and external fluid pulses in a subducted continental margin. Garnet shows a variety of textures requiring dissolution-precipitation processes in presence of fluids. In polycyclic metasediments, garnet preserves a partly resorbed core, related to pre-Alpine high-temperature/low-pressure metamorphism, and one or multiple rim generations, associated with Alpine subduction metamorphism. In eclogites, garnet chemical zoning indicates monocyclic growth with no shift in oxygen isotopes from core to rim. In metasediments, pre-Alpine garnet relics show delta O-18 values up to 5.3 parts per thousand higher than the Alpine rims, while no significant variation is observed among different Alpine garnet generations within each sample. This suggests that an extensive re-equilibration with an externally-derived fluid of distinct lower delta O-18 occurred before, or in correspondence to, the first Alpine garnet growth, while subsequent influxes of fluid had delta O-18 close to equilibrium. The observed shift in garnet delta O-18 is attributed to a possible combination of (1) interaction with sea-water derived fluids during pre-Alpine crustal extension and (2) fluids from dehydration reactions occurring during subduction of previously hydrated rocks, such as the serpentinised lithospheric mantle or hydrated portions of the basement.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0010-7999	1432-0967		WOS:000583027300001

Here, we show that Mo thio- and oxo-thio-complexes anchored on 2D p-WSe2 nanosheets considerably boost water splitting under visible light irradiation with photocurrent density up to 2.0 mA cm(-2) at -0.2 V/NHE. Besides developing high electro-catalytic activity, the Mo-complexes film is also shown to be capable of healing surface defects. We propose that the observed healing of surface defects arises from the strong adsorption on point defects of the 2D WSe2 substrate of Mo complexes such as (MoS4)(2-), (MoOS3)(2-), (Mo2S6O2)(2-) as supported by DFT calculations. In addition, the thio-, oxo-thio Mo complexes films are shown to enhance charge carrier separation and migration favouring the hydrogen evolution reaction, putting forward the use of thio-, oxo-thio-Mo complexes as a multicomponent passivation layer exhibiting multiple properties.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000564571400003

Both support-free and carbon-supported Mo2C nanomaterials with improved HER performance have been developed. Herein, distinct from prior research, novel ordered mesoporous core-shell nanowires with Mo2C cores and ultrathin graphitic carbon (GC) shells are rationally synthesized and demonstrated to be excellent for HER The synthesis is fulfilled via a hard-templating approach combining in situ carburization and localized carbon deposition. Phosphomolybdic acid confined in the SBA-15 template is first converted to MoO2, which is then in situ carburized to Mo2C nanowires with abundant surface defects. Simultaneously, GC layer (the thickness is down to similar to 1.0 nm in most areas) is controlled to be locally deposited on the Mo2C surface because of its strong affinity with carbon and catalytic effect on graphitization. Removal of the template results in the Mo2C@GC core-shell nanowire arrays with the structural properties well-characterized. They exhibit excellent performance for HER with a low overpotential of 125 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 66 mV dec(-1), and an excellent stability in acidic electrolytes. The influences of several factors, especially the spatial configuration and relative contents of the GC and Mo2C components, on HER performance are elucidated with control experiments. The excellent HER performance of the mesoporous Mo2C@GC core-shell nanowire arrays originates from the rough Mo2C nanowires with diverse active sites and short charge-transfer paths and the ultrathin GC shells with improved surface area, electronic conductivity, and stabilizing effect on Mo2C.									34	2	0	0	0	0	35			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000434895500036	29741865

Differential electrochemical mass spectrometry was demonstrated for the first time to resolve H-OPD and H-UPD by measuring the H-2 evolved from water by the hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathode (a Pt electrode) of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). The H-UPD at the cathode was thus quantified and determined to form a saturated layer on the Pt surface when the lower potential limit of cyclic voltammetry is below about 70 mV vs. the anode, a dynamic hydrogen electrode.

However, electrochemical reforming of ethanol has not received adequate attention due to its low catalytic efficiency and poor selectivity, which are caused by the multiple groups and chemical bonds of ethanol. In addition to the thermodynamic properties affected by the electronic structure of the catalyst, the dynamics of molecule/ion dynamics in electrolytes also play a significant role in the efficiency of a catalyst. The relatively large size and viscosity of the ethanol molecule necessitates large channels for molecule/ion transport through catalysts. Perforated CoNi hydroxide nanosheets are proposed as a model catalyst to synergistically regulate the dynamics of molecules and electronic structures. Molecular dynamics simulations directly reveal that these nanosheets can act as a "dam" to enrich ethanol molecules and facilitate permeation through the nanopores. Additionally, the charge transfer behavior of heteroatoms modifies the local charge density to promote molecular chemisorption. As expected, the perforated nanosheets exhibit a small potential (1.39 V) and high Faradaic efficiency for the conversion of ethanol into acetic acid. Moreover, the concept in this work provides new perspectives for exploring other molecular catalysts.									63	6	0	0	4	0	63			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000477972300017	31116896

On the other hand, a large amount of Cl-2 is generated during the electrolysis process, which leads to potential environmental risks. In the present work, a novel three-compartment ceramic membrane flow reactor, including a cathode chamber, an anode chamber, and a gas absorption chamber was developed. The three chambers were divided by an Al2O3 ceramic membrane and a breathable hydrophobic anode diffusion electrode (ADE). The Cl-2 evolution onset potential of the ADE was increased to 1.19 V from 1.05 V of the graphite fell, effectively inhibiting the chlorine evolution reaction (CER). The anode-generated Cl-2 diffused into the gas absorption chamber through the ADE and was eventually consumed by the H2O2 adsorbent. Cu could be recovered without emitting chlorine due to the special structure of reactor. The current efficiency of copper precipitation and cathode reduction from Cu2+ to Cu+ reached 97.7% at a working current of 150 mA. These results indicated that the novel membrane reactor had high potential for application in the copper recovery industry.

J	Sahnoun, Z; Jamoussi, K; Zeghal, KM								Free radicals: fundamental notions and methods of exploration								THERAPIE				52	4			251	270						JUL-AUG 1997	1997	Oxygen has invaded progressively, and through the ages, an initially anaerobic world. Living organisms hail to invent, in the course of evolution, diverse and ingenious defence systems, to survive the toxicity of this element, which was new for them. Strengthened by this experience over billions of years, the present superior organisms, and particularly human species, are thoroughly adapted to 21 per cent of atmospheric oxygen. Nevertheless, the equilibrium is fragile and the menace of oxygen hovers continually.This deleterious potential of oxygen is attributed to the formation, in vivo, of free radicals, a free radical being, by definition, any chemical species possessing one or several mismatched electrons. These free radicals are, in general, very active. They trigger chain reactions able to damage the different constituents of the living organism.Basic oxygen, must be pre-activated to manifest its toxicity. Such an activation can be achieved in two ways:it can be photodynamic, ending mainly in singlet oxygen,it can be reducing, followed by the formation of the anion hydrogen peroxide and of radical hydroxyl; the latter is the most reactive chemical species in the biological world.The reductive process is accelerated in the presence of transition metals, such as iron and copper, and/or specific enzymes (monoxygenase and certain oxydases). This activation takes place in different cellular compartments: mitochondria, microsomes, peroxysomes, cytoplasmic membrane.To this potential toxicity of oxygen, the organism opposes different anti-oxidant defence systems. A first group works up the radical drain, inhibiting activation mechanisms. Such a group, as a consequence, warns of the initiation of radical reactions.The second group neutralizes the free radicals already formed and thus stops the chain of propagation. In this group can be found detoxifying enzymes, notably superoxide dismutase and catalase, producing jointly peroxidases, particularly peroxidase glutathions. Such enzymes for the most part have trace elements as cofactors.In this secund group can also be found various molecules which act like 'substrate suicide', or as an anti-oxidant shield. Among these molecules, some can act in the lipidic phase, such as tocopherols. carotenoids and ubiquinones. Other molecules which are lipophobic, mainly ascorbic acid and uric acid, are active in a hydrated environment.In the case of a weakening of such an antioxidant defence or excess production of radicals, a state of oxidative str ess occurs.Uncontrolled, these radicals will damage different biological targets: lipids, DNA, proteins. Disturbances of cellular metabolism will occur, unless corrective defences intervene.The identification of these radical phenomena is an obligatory stage. But because of the very short life span of free radicals, identification poses a real analytical problem. However, three approaches are possible:identification of free radicals, either directly by means of paramagnetic electron resonance, or indirectly by identifying some more stable intermediates,evaluation of the traces of radical attack on biological molecules, for example by high performance liquid chromatography, gas-liquid chromatography, colorimetric tests,estimation of the antioxidant status, for example by colorimetric tests, immunoenzymatic methods, high performance liquid chromatography.									49	1	1	0	37	0	53			0040-5957	1958-5578		WOS:A1997YE23500002	9437876

However, exploring photocatalysts that could meet energy needs and put into industrial manufacture remains a challenging task. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), as a class of porous crystalline materials with tailorable structure and ultrahigh surface area, are regarded as an ideal candidate for photocatalysis application. Recently, their peculiar employment in photocatalytic water splitting aroused tremendous interests. Although this topic still in early stage, recent advanced experiments results have certified its potential for future application. This review starts with the fundamentals of photocatalytic water splitting, and subsequently summarizes and exemplifies recent developments of MOFs based- and derived-photocatalysts for water splitting, including water-splitting half reaction and overall water splitting. Particularly, two strategies to enhance photocatalytic performance of MOFs are specific emphasized, namely functional modification and surface or pore decoration. Finally, this review identifies the scarcities of MOFs based- and derived-photocatalysts and proposes pertinent suggestions for further improvement, whilst highlights a green future for photocatalytic water splitting.<bold> </bold>									108	2	0	0	26	0	109			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000504404800117

Operando monitoring and reliable identification of reacting species, however, are challenging tasks because they require surface-molecular sensitive and specific experiments under reaction conditions and sophisticated theoretical calculations. The lack of molecular insight under operating conditions is largely due to the limited availability of operando tools and to date still hinders a quick technological advancement of electrocatalytic devices. Here, we present a combination of advanced density functional theory (DFT) calculations considering implicit solvent contributions and time-resolved electrochemical surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (EC-SERS) to identify short-lived reaction intermediates during the showcase electro-reduction of Au oxide (AuOx) in sulfuric acid over several tens of seconds. The EC-SER spectra provide evidence for temporary Au-OH formation and for the asynchronous adsorption of (bi)sulfate ions at the surface during the reduction process. Spectral intensity fluctuations indicate an OH/(bi)sulfate turnover period of 4 s. As such, the presented EC-SERS potential jump approach combined with implicit solvent DFT simulations allows us to propose a reaction mechanism and prove that short-lived Au-OH intermediates also play an active role during the AuOx electro-reduction in acidic media, implying their potential relevance also for other electrocatalytic systems operating at low pH, like metal corrosion, the oxidation of CO, HCOOH, and other small organic molecules, and the oxygen evolution reaction.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900033	33194302

The mechanism of this reaction under photocatalytic conditions remains to be fully characterized. Here, we report the competitive carbon kinetic isotope effects (C-13 KIEs) on photocatalytic CO2 reduction by 1 and analyze the results of experimental measurements by comparing with computed KIEs via density functional theory (DFT) calculations as a means of formulating a chemical mechanism and illustrating the utility of this approach. The C-13 KIEs, k(C-12)/k(C-13), in acetonitrile (ACN) and dimethylformamide (DMF) were determined to be 1.0718 +/- 0.0036 and 1.0685 +/- 0.0075, respectively. When [Ru(bpy)(3)]Cl-2 is added to the reaction mixture in acetonitrile as a photosensitizer, the reduction of CO2 exhibited a C-13 KIE = 1.0703 +/- 0.0043. These values are consistent with the calculated isotope effect of CO2 binding to the one-electron reduced [Re-I(bpy(center dot-))(CO)(3)] species. The findings reported here provide strong evidence that the reactions in the two different solvents have the same first irreversible step and proceed with similar reactive intermediates upon reduction. Theoretically, we found that the major contribution for the large C-13 isotope effects comes from a dominant zero-point energy (ZPE) term. These results lay the groundwork for combined experimental and theoretical approaches for analysis of competitive isotope effects toward understanding CO2 reduction catalyzed by other complexes.									45	0	1	0	4	0	46			2155-5435			WOS:000381236700074

Peptide ligands and their cognate receptors involved in immune signaling share common motifs among many species of vascular plants. However, the origin and evolution of immune peptides is still poorly understood. Here, we searched for genes encoding small secreted peptides in the genomes of three bryophyte lineages-mosses, liverworts and hornworts-that occupy a critical position in the study of land plant evolution. We found that bryophytes shared common predicted small secreted peptides (SSPs) with vascular plants. The number of SSPs is higher in the genomes of mosses than in both the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha and the hornwort Anthoceros sp. The synthetic peptide elicitors-AtPEP and StPEP-specific for vascular plants, triggered ROS production in the protonema of the moss Physcomitrella patens, suggesting the possibility of recognizing peptide ligands from angiosperms by moss receptors. Mass spectrometry analysis of the moss Physcomitrella patens, both the wild type and the Delta cerk mutant secretomes, revealed peptides that specifically responded to chitosan treatment, suggesting their role in immune signaling.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0167-4412	1573-5028		WOS:000628467100001	33713297

In our FE-SEM images, we observed that Co3S4 NS was vertically, or obliquely, deposited on the Ni foam. As a result, the structure contained more active sites, and active sites were highly accessible to the electrolyte for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Furthermore, results of XPS and XRD analysis confirmed S-conversion from Co3O4 to Co3S4 during sulfurization. 3-Co3S4 NS/NF with sulfurization for 3 h exhibited the highest sulfur content, while Co3S4 began to desulfurize to Co9S8 after sulfurization for 4 h. The 3-Co3S4 NS/NF electrocatalyst showed a lowest overpotential of 93 mV at -10 mA/cm(2), with a Tafel slope of -55.1 mV/dec in N-2-purged 1 M KOH. Also, the single cell anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) showed a high current density of 431 mA/cm(2) with cell voltage 2.0 V-cell at 40-45 degrees C.

J	Guo, Weifu; Zhou, Chen								Patterns and controls of disequilibrium isotope effects in speleothems: Insights from an isotope-enabled diffusion-reaction model and implications for quantitative thermometry								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				267				196	226		10.1016/j.gca.2019.07.028				DEC 15 2019	2019	Stable isotope composition of speleothems reflects the physicochemical condition of their formation environment such as the local temperature and the isotopic composition of surface precipitation, making them one of the best archives of terrestrial climate. However, quantitative reconstruction of paleo-temperature from speleothem isotope records is challenging, because most speleothems do not form in isotope equilibrium with the drip water. These disequilibrium isotope effects, often thought to arise from the rapid degassing of CO2 from a thin water film, vary among different speleothems and over time, and hinder the applications of many isotope thermometers in speleothems, including both the conventional carbonate-water oxygen isotope thermometer and the recently developed carbonate clumped isotope thermometer. Here we present an isotope-enabled reaction-diffusion model of speleothem formation (IsoCave), and use it to systematically examine the patterns and controls of the disequilibrium isotope effects in speleothems (delta C-13, delta O-18, Delta'O-17, Delta(47), Delta(48) and Delta(49)) and explore their implications for isotope thermometry in speleothems.We show that prior calcite precipitation, cave air pCO(2) and delta(CCO2)-C-13 exert the strongest controls on the disequilibrium isotope effects in speleothems, followed by cave temperature, water film thickness and water drip rate. Together, changes in these environment parameters explain the variations of disequilibrium isotope effects in natural speleothems. Our model reproduces the apparent temperature dependence of oxygen isotope compositions of speleothems compiled from multiple caves over a large temperature range, but highlights the challenges in the application of speoleothem-specific calibration of isotope thermometers due to the effects of non-temperature factors. Further, we show the disequilibrium effects in different isotope systems are highly correlated. The slopes of these correlations reflect mainly the kinetic isotope fractionations associated with HCO3- dehydration and dehydroxylation reactions, and remain relatively constant despite changes in environmental conditions especially for speleothems formed during the early evolution period of drip water. Based on these correlations, specifically the correlation between disequilibrium Delta(47) and Delta(48) effects, we propose a novel approach to quantitatively correct for disequilibrium isotope effects in speleothems and derive more accurate estimates of speleothem formation temperatures. Application of this coupled Delta(47)-Delta(48) approach to synthetic speleothem isotope records reproduces the speleothem formation temperatures, suggesting new opportunities for quantitative paleo-temperature reconstruction based on speleothem isotope records.

Herein, a series of highly active and inexpensive Co-Ni-P films were fabricated by a one-step constant current density electro-deposition method. These films were demonstrated to be efficient bifunctional catalysts for both H-2 and O-2 evolution reactions (HER and OER), while deposition time was deemed to be the crucial factor governing electrochemical performance. At the optimal deposition time, the obtained Co-Ni-P-2 catalyst performed remarkably for both HER and OER in alkaline media. In particular, it requires -103 mV over potential for HER and 340 mV for OER to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), with corresponding Tafel slopes of 33 and 67 mV dec(-1). Moreover, it outperforms the Pt/C//RuO2 catalyst and only needs 160 mV (430 mV) overpotential for HER (OER) to achieve 200 mA cm(-2) current density. Co Ni-P electrodes were also conducted for the proof-of-concept exercise, which were proved to be flexible, stable, and efficient, further opening a new avenue for rapid synthesis of efficient, flexible catalysts for renewable energy resources.									77	4	0	0	4	0	79			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000411771400070	28849904

In this paper, urea and melamine were employed as base precursor materials to obtain four different morphologies of tubular g-C3N4: stacked rectangular thin plates with flocculent structure, ragged porous hollow tubes, porous hollow tubes and tetragonal hollow prismatic tubes by simply regulating the heating rate. Among them, the ragged porous hollow tubular g-C3N4 (TCN-1.5) exhibit an amazing hydrogen evolution rate of 8683 mmol h(-1) g(-1) from water, which is 19.3 times that of the massive g-C3N4 (449 mmol h(-1) g(-1)), and still maintain a high hydrogen evolution rate (6782 mmol h(-1)g(-1)) from sea water. The analysis results show that by controlling the change of the heating rate, the ammonia overflow rate can be effectively controlled to produce abundant voids and pits to form volume defects, which can exhibit higher specific surface area and serve as a highly active center for the catalytic reaction and effectively improve the photocatalytic performance. This study provides a simple design idea to construct a novel type of ragged porous hollow tubular gC(3)N(4) for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production from water and seawater.

Different percentages of platinum nanoparticles (0.2-0.8 wt%) were deposited onto mesoporous PbTiO3 nanosheets surface employing a photoassisted deposition method. TEM images of Pt@PbTiO3 mesoporous nanocomposites show the close proximity of lattice fringes 0.220 nm of metallic platinum (111) and the 0.284 nm lattice layout of the PbTiO3 (101). The synthesized Pt@PbTiO3 mesoporous composites were tested in the presence of glycerol employing visible light derived photocatalytic water splitting reaction. The H-2 evolution rate with the use of 0.6 wt% Pt@PbTiO3 reached 3564 mu mol/g, which is 85 times higher than the rate when pure mesoporous PbTiO3 was used. The H-2 evolution rate when using PbTiO3 was 42 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), which was enhanced to 3564 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) upon the use of 0.6 wt% Pt@PbTiO3. Pt@PbTiO3 nanocomposites exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity with outstanding stability and enhanced possibility of reuse with a potential to be used in environmental and energy applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1388-0764	1572-896X		WOS:000567930900002

For hematite photoanodes, only one type of surface states with higher oxidative energy (S1) has been proposed and verified as reaction intermediate, while the other surface state located at lower potentials (S2) was assigned to inactive or recombination sites. Through employing rate law analyses and systematical (photo)electrochemical characterizations, here we show that S2 is an active reaction intermediate for water oxidation as well. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the reaction kinetics and dynamic interactions of both S1 and S2 depend significantly on operational parameters, such as illumination intensity, nature of the electrolyte, and applied potential. These insights into the individual reaction kinetics and the interplay of both surface states are decisive for designing efficient photoanodes.

Here, it is proposed, for the first time, to engineer the basal surface activity of NiPS3 by nonmetal heteroatom doping, and predict that the degree to which the valance band of NiPS3 is filled dominates not only the electrical conductivity of the catalyst, but also the strength of hydrogen adsorption at its surface. Direct experimental evidence is offered that in all the single nonmetal doping samples, C-doped NiPS3 exhibits the optimum activity owing to its moderate filled state of valance band and that C, N codoping even shows Pt-like activity with an ultralow overpotential of 53.2 mV to afford 10 mA cm(-2) current density and a high exchange current density of 0.7 mA cm(-2) in 1 m KOH. The findings that less valance electrons of dopants than substitutional atoms are of pivotal importance for improving HER activity of NiPS3 catalyst pave the way for readily designing novel MTPs of ever high performance to replace the incumbent Pt-based catalysts.									56	5	0	0	4	0	58			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000510466500001		
J	Barry, Bridgette A.; Brahmachari, Udita; Guo, Zhanjun				Guo, Zhanjun/M-4666-2018	Guo, Zhanjun/0000-0003-0413-6805			Tracking Reactive Water and Hydrogen-Bonding Networks in Photosynthetic Oxygen Evolution								ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH				50	8			1937	1945		10.1021/acs.accounts.7b00189				AUG 2017	2017	In oxygenic photosynthesis, photosystem II (PSII) converts water to molecular oxygen through four photodriven oxidation events at a Mn4CaO5 cluster. A tyrosine, YZ (Y161 in the D1 polypeptide), transfers oxidizing equivalents from an oxidized, primary chlorophyll donor to the metal center. Calcium or its analogue, strontium, is required for activity. The Mn4CaO5 cluster and YZ are predicted to be hydrogen bonded in a water-containing network, which involves amide carbonyl groups, amino acid side chains, and water. This hydrogen-bonded network includes amino acid residues in intrinsic and extrinsic subunits. One of the extrinsic subunits, PsbO, is intrinsically disordered. This extensive (35 A) network may be essential in facilitating proton release from substrate water. While it is known that some proteins employ internal water molecules to catalyze reactions, there are relatively few methods that can be used to study the role of water. In this Account, we review spectroscopic evidence from our group supporting the conclusion that the PSII hydrogen-bonding network is dynamic and that water in the network plays a direct role in catalysis. Two approaches, transient electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and reaction-induced FT-IR (RIFT-IR) spectroscopies, were used. The EPR experiments focused on the decay kinetics of YZ center dot via recombination at 190 K and the solvent isotope, pH, and calcium dependence of these kinetics. The RIFT-IR experiments focused on shifts in amide carbonyl frequencies, induced by photo-oxidation of the metal cluster, and on the isotope-based assignment of bands to internal, small protonated water clusters at 190, 263, and 283 K. To conduct these experiments, PSII was prepared in selected steps along the catalytic pathway, the S-n state cycle (n = 0-4). This cycle ultimately generates oxygen. In the EPR studies, S-state dependent changes were observed in the YZ center dot lifetime and in its solvent isotope effect. The YZ center dot lifetime depended on the presence of calcium at pH 7.5, but not at pH 6.0, suggesting a two-donor-model for PCET. At pH 6.0 or 7.5, barium and ammonia both slowed the rate of YZ center dot recombination, consistent with disruption of the hydrogen-bonding network. In the RIFT-IR studies of the S state transitions, infrared bands associated with the transient protonation and deprotonation of internal waters were identified by D2O and (H2O)-O-18 labeling. The infrared bands of these protonated water clusters, W-n(+) (or nH(2)O(H3O)(+), n = 5-6), exhibited flash dependence and were produced during the S-1 to S-2 and S-3 to So transitions. Calcium dependence was observed at pH 7.5, but not at pH 6.0. S-state induced shifts were observed in amide C=O frequencies during the S-1 to S-2 transition and attributed to alterations in hydrogen bonding, based on ammonia sensitivity. In addition, isotope editing of the extrinsic subunit, PsbO, established that amide vibrational bands of this lumenal subunit respond to the S state transitions and that PsbO is a structural template for the reaction center. Taken together, these spectroscopic results support the hypothesis that proton transfer networks, extending from YZ to PsbO, play a functional and dynamic role in photosynthetic oxygen evolution.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000407988400017	28763201

However, this strategy has not yet been explored for the preparation of polyoxometalate (POM)-encapsulated metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). In this work, we designed and prepared a new compound, [Co-2(3,3'-bpy)(3,5'-bpp)(4,3'-bpy)](H2O)(3)[SiW12O40] (1) (4,3'-bpy = 4,3'-dipyridine, 3,5'-bpp = 3,5'-bis(pyrid-4-yl)pyridine, and 3,3'-bpy = 3,3'-bis(pyrid-4-yl) dipyridine), via an in situ ligand synthesis route. The compound shows a novel POM-encapsulated MOF structure with two pairs of left- and right-handed double helixes. These left- and right-handed helical chains further lead to triangular and rhombus-like channels, respectively. Moreover, the as-synthesized title compound shows superior electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1 M KOH aqueous solution with a low overpotential and Tafel slope of 92 mV and 92.1 mV dec(-1), respectively, under a current density of 10 cm(-2). Also, the compound exhibits a high activity for the photocatalytic degradation of the dye rhodamine B. The excellent performance of the compound may be attributed to the synergistic effect between W and Co elements and the presence of encapsulated POMs. The title compound proves that it is possible to prepare multifunctional MOFs with POMs and transition metals showing HER activity and dye degradation activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000831034200001	35852958

However, it is a challenging issue owing to the complex and difficult preparation process. Herein, a novel waste tires-derived Zn, S, N selfdoped CM is prepared and used for efficiently electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The electronic state and molecular structure are effectively adjusted by forming C-N and C-S bonds in CM, and the Zn 3d configuration could participate in molecular orbital hybridization to produce the synergistic effect with regulation of N and S, thus improving the electrocatalytic HER activity. The obtained Zn, S, N self-doped CM requires only an overpotential of 50 mV at 10 mA cm-2, which is close to that of Pt/C (42 mV). The cell voltage of Zn, S, N self-doped CM || RuO2 electrolyze (1.31 V) at 10 mA cm-2 is much smallerthan that of Pt/C || RuO2 (1.46 V). This work points out a promising strategy for the devel-opment of multielement doped CM applied in electrocatalytic HER and the efficiently resourceful utilization of waste tires.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The nontoxicity, low cost, and versatility of photocatalysts make them especially attractive for this application. This study demonstrates that small amounts of alpha-Fe2O3 nanosheets can actively promote exfoliation of g-C3N4, producing 2D hybrid that exhibits tight interfaces and an all-solid-state Z-scheme junction. These nanostructured hybrids present a high H-2 evolution rate >3 x 10(4) mu mol g(-1) h(-1) and external quantum efficiency of 44.35% at lambda = 420 nm, the highest value so far reported among the family of g-C3N4 photocatalysts. Besides effectively suppressing the recombination of electron-hole pairs, this Z-scheme junction also exhibits activity toward overall water splitting without any sacrificial donor. The proposed synthetic route for controlled production of 2D g-C3N4-based structures provides a scalable alternative toward the development of highly efficient and active photocatalysts.									516	37	0	0	45	0	520			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000409410000010

Herein, we report a novel elctrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) fabricated by doping Ni foam (NF) supported Ni2P nanosheets with Cu atoms. The Cu atoms effectively tune the structure and physicochemical properties of Ni2P, leading to the lower HER free energy, improved electrical conductivity, and high exposure of surface active sites. The optimized Ni1.8Cu0.2-P displays an excellent catalytic performance and stability, which is demonstrated by the low overpotentials of 78 (Tafel slope: 70 mV dec-(1)) and 245 mV to reach a current density of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) for the HER in 1.0 M KOH. The high electrocatalytic activity of Ni1.8Cu0.2-P is attributed to the increased Fermi level and the exposed active crystal plane (201). The H-2 amount produced with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is about 1.91 mmol h(-1) cm(-2), which is the highest value among the reported non-precious metal catalysts.									96	3	0	0	5	0	97			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000453616800055

In order to balance performance and cost in a Pt-based electrocatalyst, we prepared a series of PtCu bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) with different Pt/Cu ratios through a facile synthetic strategy to optimize the utilization of Pt atoms. PtCu NPs demonstrate a uniform particle size distribution with exposed (111) facets that are highly active for the HER. A synergetic effect between Pt and Cu leads to electron transfer from Pt to Cu, which is favorable for the desorption of H intermediates. Therefore, the as-synthesized carbon black (CB) supported PtCu catalysts showed enhanced catalytic performance in the HER compared with a commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst. Typically, Pt1Cu3/CB showed excellent HER performance, with only 10 mV (acid) and 17 mV (alkaline) overpotentials required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This is because the Pt1Cu3 NPs, with a small average particle size (7.70 +/- 0.04 nm) and Pt-Cu core and Pt-rich shell structure, display the highest electrochemically active surface area (24.7 m(2) g(Pt)(-1)) out of the as-synthesized PtCu/CB samples. Furthermore, Pt1Cu3/CB showed good electrocatalytic stability, with current density drops of only 9.3% and 12.8% in acidic solution after 24 h and in alkaline solution after 9 h, respectively. This study may shed new light on the rational design of active and durable hydrogen evolution catalysts with low amounts of Pt.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6				2046-2069		WOS:000680655300054	35479446

MoSe2 is one of the low-cost candidates; however, its activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is still not satisfactory due to the low conductivity and poor electrical contact with the charge collection substrate. Herein, we provide a simple approach of synthesizing vertically aligned MoSe2 nanoplatelets on the urchin-like HERactive conductive CoSe2 nanowire array. Nanostructured MoSe2/CoSe2 hybrid catalysts obtained a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of only 129 mV, with a small Tafel slope of 38.2 mV dec(-1), which is superior to those of most transition metal dichalcogenides (MoSe2, MoSe2-CoSe2 hybrids, and so on).

Use of reaction path modelling to investigate the evolution of water chemistry in shallow to deep crystalline aquifers with a special focus on fluoride								SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT				830						154566	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154566				JUL 15 2022	2022	Crystalline aquifers are layered systems in which the hydrogeological path of waters extends from highly weathered, shallow and porous rocks to poorly weathered, deep and fissured rocks. This varying hydrogeological setting influences the water chemistry in different ways. The paper aims to reconstruct the water-rock interaction process in these various environments starting from a solid reactant represented by an average granite rock and several waters from the shallow aquifer. Afterwards, the water-rock interaction processes occurring in the deep environment are reconstructed, varying the geochemical conditions (primary reactants, secondary mineral phases allowed to precipitate, fO(2) and fCO(2)), with a special focus on fluoride (F-). The evolution from the F-poor, Ca-HCO3 facies to the F-rich, Na-HCO3 water type of high pH was simulated using reaction path modelling. The obtained results show that the theoretical evolution trends well reproduce both shallow and deep water samples providing detailed information on the behavior of fluoride and other relevant constituents (i.e., Na, K, Ca, Mg, SiO2). The performed model represents a flexible and powerful tool for environmental research, applicable in other areas hosting F-rich groundwater.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0048-9697	1879-1026		WOS:000804454700005	35304151

The oxidation of ethanol in O-2/N-2 and O-2/CO2 environments was examined using reactive molecular dynamics in the temperature range from 2200 to 3000 K at constant density media and O-2/fuel ratio equals to 0.5. The main reactions were examined to supply a description of the ethanol oxidation behavior, the main product distribution, and the corresponding time evolution behavior in the atomic scale. It has been noted that the oxidation of C2H6O was initiated mainly from the same routes in both environments generating the same main species. However, the key reaction pathways were different depending on the media. We noticed an increase of CO formation when N-2 was replaced by CO2 molecules, increasing the net flux of the following reactions: by CO2 + H -> CO + OH and CO2 + CHO -> O=COH + CO. This work also studied the effect of increasing O-2 concentration (O-2/fuel ratio equals to 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0) in O-2/CO2 combustion. During the simulations, high oxygenated and unstable species were detected such as carbonates and carboxyl radicals. The change of the O-2/fuel ratio from 0.5 to 2.0 lead to an increase of CO2 formation mainly from O-2 + O=COH -> CO2 + HO2 and O-2 + CO -> CO2 + O reactions. In addition, the increase of O-2 concentration attenuated the effect of CO2 and could increase the occurrence of reactions that lead to flame cessation.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1549-9596	1549-960X		WOS:000516665600028	31977206

Among them, MoS2 nanostructures have intrigued great interest for its low cost and potential high performance. However, due to the intrinsically low conductivity, its H-2 evolution activity is not satisfactory as an applicable electrocatalyst. Herein we report a novel MoS2/FeS2 nanocomposite grown directly on carbon cloth by a facile method based on simple one-step chemical vapor deposition, which has significantly improved H-2 evolution performance compared to its pure MoS2 nanosheets counterpart. Such self-supported MoS2/FeS2 nanocomposite electrode exhibits a relatively low overpotential of 134 mV at a current of 10 mA cm(-2), a quite small Tafel slope of 76.8 mV.dec(-1) and excellent electrocatalytic durability in 0.5 mol L 1 H2SO4. The remarkably high H-2 evolution activity could be ascribed to the fully exposed and increased number of active sites, enhanced charge transfer rate between MoS2 nanosheets and FeS2 nano-particles in the composite, and the 3D self-supported structure. This strategy to prepare MoS2/FeS2 nanocomposite with controllable morphology and highly active microstructure would provide a new way for the improvement of the electrocatalytic H-2 evolution activity and durability of MoS2.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1293-2558	1873-3085		WOS:000530688700004

Potentials of current peaks of Ni(II)/Ni(III) redox couple are independent of alloy composition. On the other hand, Ni(II)/Ni(III) redox couples formed on Pd-Ni alloys and Ni differ in respect to the structure of involved compounds and the processes of transport of the species accompanying oxidation/reduction reaction. The process of oxidation of Pd exhibits some differences between pure Pd and Pd-Ni alloys. This concerns mainly on participation of adsorbed water/OH- in Pd oxidation process. In the initial stages of Pd oxidation, the source of oxygen is water/OH- from the bulk of the solution. At this stage of the process, the product of Pd oxidation could be described as Pd(OH)(2) or PdOH2O. With further progress in oxidation process, adsorbed species, water/OH-, start to play a decisive role. Hydrous species, i.e. Pd(OH)(2) or PdOH2O, are also reduced in the final stages of Pd(II) reduction process.									63	2	0	0	1	0	64			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000252629500005

The HER performance for the CoNi-LDH@NiCo alloy achieved the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotential of 69 mV in 1 M KOH solution, improved 60% for h10 by comparing with the pristine NiCo alloy. Utilizing the specialized adsorption of CoNi-LDH for H2O and the featured attractiveness of NiCo alloy for H atom, the interface effect of the heterostructure electrocatalyst accelerated the dissociation of water molecules and elevated the catalytic kinetics dramatically. This work points out a potential approach towards the easy construction of inexpensive heterostructured electrocatalysts for HER activity in alkaline medium.

Four quanta of light drive the OEC through the increasingly oxidized states S-0 double right arrow S-1 double right arrow S-2 double right arrow S-3 double right arrow S-4 to yield O-2 during the transition S-4-->S-0. It has been speculated that the oxidation of water might be kinetically facilitated by the abstraction of hydrogen. This implied that the respective electron acceptor is deprotonated upon oxidation. Whether Y-Z and X fulfill this expectation is under debate. We have previously inferred a 'chemical' deprotonation of X based on the kinetics of proton release (Haumann M, Drerenstedt W, Hundelt M and Junge W (1996) Biochim Biophys Acta 1273: 237-250. Here, we investigated the rates of electron transfer and proton release as function of the D2O/H2O ratio, the pH, and the temperature both in thylakoids and PS II core particles. The largest kinetic isotope effect on the rate of electron transfer (factor of 2.1-2.4) and the largest pH-dependence (factor of about 2 between pH 5 and 8) was found on S-2 double right arrow S-3 where X is oxidized. During the other transitions both factors were much smaller (less than or equal to 1.4). Electron transfer is probably kinetically steered by proton transfer only during S-2 double right arrow S-3. These results corroborate the notion that X-. serves as a hydrogen acceptor for bound water during S-4-->S-0. We propose a consistent scheme for the final reaction with water to yield dioxygen: two two-electron (hydrogen) transfers in series with a peroxide intermediate.									99	1	0	0	65	0	99			0166-8595			WOS:A1997XJ61200004

A kanamycin resistance gene was used to interrupt the psaA gene in the unicellular cyanobacterittm Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Selection of a fully segregated mutant, ADK9, was performed under light-activated heterotrophic growth (LAHG) conditions; complete darkness except for 5 min of light every 24 h and 5 mM glucose. Under these conditions, wild-type cells showed a 4-fold decrease in chlorophyll (chl) per cell, primarily due to a decrease of PS I reaction centers. Evidence for the absence of PS I in ADK9 includes: the lack of EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) signal I, from P700+; undetectable P700-apoprotein; greatly reduced whole-chain photosynthesis rates; and greatly reduced chl per cell, resulting in a turquoise blue phenotype. The PS I peripheral proteins PSA-C and PSA-D were not detected in this mutant. ADK9 does assemble near wild-type levels of functional PS 11 per cell, evidenced by: EPR signal II from Y(D)+; high rates of oxygen evolution with 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone (DCBQ), an electron acceptor from PS II; and accumulation of D1, a PS II core polypeptide. The success of this transformation indicates that this cyanobacterium may be utilized for site-directed mutagenesis of the PS I core.									84	3	0	0	75	0	86			0261-4189	1460-2075		WOS:A1991GK97300021	1717264

This unusual characteristic has been connected to the origin of highly enhanced catalytic performance for decades, but the mechanistic explanation of SMSI remains a long-standing issue in heterogeneous catalysis. To understand this matter at the molecular level, geometric and electronic functions of metal-oxide interfaces during catalytic reactions should be clearly interpreted using advanced microscopic and spectroscopic analysis techniques. In this Review, we highlight recently performed investigations at metal-oxide interfaces by operando characterization tools to identify active sites in working conditions. We introduce two kinds of catalysts, platinum-based bimetallic alloys and mixed metal-oxide catalysts. Selected operando techniques reveal their atomic-scale morphology, surface electronic structure, and charge transfer/transport at surfaces under oxidation, reduction, and gas mixture environments. With bimetallic model catalysts, topographic morphology observations present critical evidence for the structural modulation between the topmost layer and the subsurface lattice in oxygen conditions. For the mixed metal-oxide catalysts, we note that metal nanoparticles on reducible oxides demonstrate the catalytic activity enhancement, which is obviously influenced by the change of oxidation states at the metal-oxide interface. Environmental transmission electron microscopy images unveil the atomic-scale redox behaviors at the nanoparticle interfaces with evolutions of the reducible oxide under the catalytic reaction. The important role of reactive interfaces between the transition metal atom and oxide-support explains the surface chemistry and heterogeneous catalysis over active sites on well-defined single crystal model surfaces, as well as nanoparticle catalysts. Overall, operando studies for metal-oxide interfaces can shed light on mechanistic insights into the tuning of catalytic activity at the molecular level and on improving catalytic performance by the SMSI effect.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000674927200025

An especially attractive approach is to store solar energy in the form of chemical bonds as performed in natural photosynthesis. Therefore, there is a challenge in the last decades to construct semi-artificial and artificial photosynthetic systems, which are able to efficiently capture and convert solar energy and then store it in the form of chemical bonds of solar fuels such as hydrogen or hydrogen peroxide, while at the time producing oxygen from water. Here, we review the molecular level details of the natural photosynthesis, particularly the mechanism of light dependent reactions in oxygen evolving organisms, absorption efficiency of solar energy and direct energy production. We then demonstrate the concept and examples of the semi-artificial photosynthesis in vitro. Finally we demonstrate the artificial photosynthesis, which is composed of light harvesting and charge-separation units together with catalytic units of water oxidation and reduction as well as CO2 reduction. The reported photosynthetic molecular and supramolecular systems have been designed and examined in order to mimic functions of the antenna-reaction center of the natural process. The relations between structures and photochemical behaviors of these artificial photosynthetic systems are discussed in relation to the rates and efficiencies of charge-separation and charge-recombination processes by utilizing the laser flash photolysis technique, as well as other complementary techniques. Finally the photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide as a more promising solar fuel is discussed in relation with the natural photosynthesis, which also produces hydrogen peroxide in addition to NADPH.

However, Cu2O usually suffers from poor stability because the oxidation state of copper is easily changed. In this work, Cu2O particles of three different shapes were prepared with distinct surface structures: cubes with (100) facets, octahedra with (111) facets, and rhombic dodecahedra with (110) facets. Their shape stability was estimated in deionized water with or without light irradiation. The Cu2O(100) facets were selectively deformed under dark conditions, as expected from density functional theory calculations. The rhombic dodecahedra showed the most violent degradation under light irradiation, with many large thorns appearing on the surface. When water splitting was attempted using the shaped Cu2O particles, the rhombic dodecahedra produced the most hydrogen, whereas the cubes produced none. Oxygen was not measured because the holes generated upon light absorption were used to oxidize the Cu2O surface to CuO. A conformal TiIrOx overlayer was successfully formed on the rhombic dodecahedral Cu2O particles, and the coated particles presented overall water splitting producing both hydrogen and oxygen. They also showed significantly improved stability over repeated water splitting reactions relative to bare Cu2O particles or TiOx-coated Cu2O particles.									97	4	0	0	5	0	100			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000345962800021		
J	Szanyi, J; Paffett, MT								The adsorption of NO and reaction of NO with O-2 on H-, NaH-, CuH-, and Cu-ZSM-5: An in situ FTIR investigation								JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				164	1			232	245		10.1006/jcat.1996.0378				NOV 1996	1996	The adsorption of NO and the reaction of NO with O-2 On H-, NaH-, CuH-, and Cu-ZSM-5 zeolites were studied at 300 K using in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), At this temperature, NO readily adsorbs on the Cu+ sites of CuH- and Cu-ZSM-5 catalysts and decomposition of NO is observed for all catalysts, although the rate of decomposition is vastly different on these materials. In comparison, this reaction is negligible over the Hand NaH-ZSM-5 samples. The time evolution of several nitrogen-containing molecules after controlled O-2 exposure to the NO/ZSM-5 systems has allowed the spectral correlation of these species, These nitrogen-containing species can interact with either the protonic sites of bridging hydroxyls forming hydrogen bonding complexes or the metal cations producing primarily surface nitrates and nitrites. The hydrogen bonded NxOy complexes were characterized with their IR absorption features: (a) NO2, 2133 cm(-1); (b) N2O3, 1875 and 1587 cm(-1); and (c) N2O4, 2185 and 1745 cm(-1). The stretching vibrational frequency of the acidic OH groups of ZSM-5 redshifts due to the interaction with nitrogen-containing molecules and forms ''ABC'' band structures characteristic of medium and strong hydrogen bonding complexes. Although the adsorbed NxOy species (N2O3, N2O4) interacting with the Bronsted protons exhibit characteristics of a strong Lewis base, adsorption enthalpies are sufficiently weak that their existence is not observed even after brief evacuation. Nitric oxide, oxygen coadsorption produces metal cation (Na+ and Cu-n+) bonded surface species possessing IR absorption bands between 1400 and 1650 cm(-1) characteristic of nitrite and nitrate species. The thermal stability of the nitrite and nitrate adsorbed species is much greater than the NxOy species nucleated at free Bronsted acid sites.

Iridium (Ir) is the only active element with a high resistance to the acid corrosion during water electrolysis. However, Ir is rare, and its large-scale application could only be possible if the intrinsic activity of Ir could be greatly enhanced. Here, a pseudo-cubic SrCo0.9Ir0.1O3-delta perovskite, containing corner-shared IrO6 octahedrons, is designed. The Ir in the SrCo0.9Ir0.1O3-delta catalyst shows an extremely high intrinsic activity as reflected from its high turnover frequency, which is more than two orders of magnitude higher than that of IrO2. During the electrochemical cycling, a surface reconstruction, with Sr and Co leaching, over SrCo0.9Ir0.1O3-delta occurs. Such reconstructed surface region, likely contains a high amount of structural domains with corner-shared and under-coordinated IrOx octahedrons, is responsible for the observed high activity.									171	12	0	0	8	0	169			2041-1723			WOS:000457582900016	30718514

This work reveals charge transfer upon visible light illumination from this MOF to two different charge acceptors, as an alternative to sacrificial electron donors. Charge transfer is demonstrated through a combined spectroscopic study between this MOF and: (1) 2-(1H-pyrazol-3-yl) phenol, a molecule that functionally mimics the tyrosine-histidine pair, responsible for shuttling the holes to the oxygen evolving centre in natural photosynthesis, and (2) TEMPO, a well known and stable radical. Charge transfer of the holes from the MOF to these occluded molecules takes place on the picosecond time scale. This work suggests that, by coupling a stable and recyclable charge acceptor to the photogenerated holes, the charges can be utilised for oxidation reactions and, thus, link the reduction to the oxidation reactions in water splitting.									10	1	0	0	1	0	11			1359-6640	1364-5498		WOS:000409366000004	28678276

However, the efficiency of H-2 production from the reaction is limited by the slow kinetics of the water oxidation. Herein the promising role of fluoride on water-oxidizing activity of nanolayered Mn oxide is reported. The effects were studied for water oxidation in the presence of cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate. These experiments showed that the treatment of nanolayered Mn oxide by potassium fluoride increases water-oxidizing activity of these oxides in the presence of cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate approximately two times.

The overpotential of heptazine were superior to triazine and precious metal. It was revealed that the difference in overpotential between heptazine and triazine was mainly a result of the gap of charge voltages. Using potential dependent surface phase diagram, it was confirmed that the charge voltage was determined by the LiO2 formation. The hybridization of Li and bound N in the cavity revealed a clear distinction between substrates. Through the charge analysis, these results stemmed from the electron difference of bound N that was caused by the cavity structural property depending on the substrates. These findings may provide insight for designing of N-doped carbon materials as catalysts for Li-O-2 batteries, which possess overpotential that are lower than existing catalyst materials.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			0040-6090			WOS:000441177500021

However, the fabrication of SiNW photocathodes with both high photoelectrocatalytic activity and long-term operational stability using a simple and affordable approach is a challenging task. Herein, we report conformal and continuous deposition of a di-cobalt phosphide (Co2P) layer on lithography-patterned highly ordered SiNW arrays via a cost-effective drop-casting method followed by a low-temperature phosphorization treatment. The as-deposited Co2P layer consists of crystalline nanoparticles and has an intimate contact with SiNWs, forming a well-defined SiNW@Co2P core/shell nanostructure. The conformal and continuous Co2P layer functions as a highly efficient catalyst capable of substantially improving the photoelectrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and effectively passivates the SiNWs to protect them from photo-oxidation, thus prolonging the lifetime of the electrode. As a consequence, the SiNW@Co2P photocathode with an optimized Co2P layer thickness exhibits a high photocurrent density of -21.9 mA.cm(-2) at 0 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode and excellent operational stability up to 20 h for solar-driven hydrogen evolution, outperforming many nanostructured silicon photocathodes reported in the literature. The combination of passivation and catalytic functions in a single continuous layer represents a promising strategy for designing high-performance semiconductor photoelectrodes for use in solar-driven water splitting, which may simplify fabrication procedures and potentially reduce production costs.									21	3	0	0	0	0	21			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000441237100031

The activity of Pt is controlled by its electronic structure (typically, the d-band centre), which depends sensitively on lattice strain(4,5). This dependence can be exploited for catalyst design(4,6-8), and the use of core-shell structures and elastic substrates has resulted in strain-engineered Pt catalysts with drastically improved electrocatalytic performances(7,9-13). However, it is challenging to map in detail the strain-activity correlations in Pt-catalysed conversions, which can involve a number of distinct processes, and to identify the optimal strain modification for specific reactions. Here we show that when ultrathin Pt shells are deposited on palladium-based nanocubes, expansion and shrinkage of the nanocubes through phosphorization and dephosphorization induces strain in the Pt(100) lattice that can be adjusted from -5.1 per cent to 5.9 per cent. We use this strain control to tune the electrocatalytic activity of the Pt shells over a wide range, finding that the strain-activity correlation for the methanol oxidation reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction follows an M-shaped curve and a volcano-shaped curve, respectively. We anticipate that our approach can be used to screen out lattice strain that will optimize the performance of Pt catalysts-and potentially other metal catalysts-for a wide range of reactions.									55	0	0	0	2	0	55			0028-0836	1476-4687		WOS:000705847500001	34616058

Kinetics of production of nitric oxide during the pyrolysis of small particles of coal in a hot (electrically heated) bed of sand fluidised by pure nitrogen								JOURNAL OF THE ENERGY INSTITUTE				81	3			125	130		10.1179/174602208X305228				SEP 2008	2008	Tiny coal particles (size <1 mm) have been shown to lose their volatile matter, when in a hot (similar to 1100 K) bed of quartz sand fluidised by pure nitrogen, at a rate governed by chemical kinetics and not by, e. g. the rate of heating. In fact, nitric oxide is produced during pyrolysis (i.e. in the absence of atmospheric oxygen) with simple first order kinetics, as if only one reaction step were involved. The measured activation energy (20 kJ mol(-1)) for Tymawr coal is however much smaller than the strengths of the bonds (>300 kJ mol(-1)) broken during pyrolysis or devolatilisation. Likewise, the frequency factor for thermal decomposition producing NO is 5 s(-1); this is very much less than the expected value of similar to 10(14) s(-1). The reason for these major numerical discrepancies is that the volatile matter and consequently NO are produced by very many first order reactions, all acting in parallel. These numerical differences also hold generally for the kinetics of pyrolysis and devolatilisation, when producing hydrocarbons from a solid fuel, such as coal.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1743-9671	1746-0220		WOS:000260209100001

Oxygen isotope studies of phosphite oxidation: Purification and analysis of reactants and products by high-temperature conversion elemental analyzer/isotope ratio mass spectrometry								RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY				29	21			2039	2044		10.1002/rcm.7293				NOV 15 2015	2015	RationaleIncreased attention has been recently focused on the origin and reactions of reduced-P oxyanions such as phosphite [PO3(III)] in terrestrial and biological systems. We present new methods for studying O-isotopic reactions between PO3(III) and other oxygen sources during oxidation of PO3(III) to PO4(V).MethodsNa(2)(HPO3)5H(2)O, used as a PO3(III) source, contains structural water due to its hygroscopic nature; thus, we developed a method for determining the O-18 value of PO3(III) after the removal of structural water. Next, we tested two techniques for purifying PO4(V) from aqueous PO3(III)/PO4(V) mixtures: (1) precipitation of PO4(V) as ammonium phosphomolybdate (APM); and (2) precipitation of PO4(V) as magnesium ammonium phosphate (MAP). The O-isotope compositions, O-18:O-16 (O-18 values), of Na-2(HPO3) and Ag3PO4 were analyzed by TC/EA/IRMS.ResultsStructural water was removed from Na-2(HPO3)5H(2)O after drying at 100 degrees C under vacuum and the O-18 value of PO3(III) was obtained. The O-18 values of PO4(V), which was extracted from O-18-labeled PO3(III)/PO4(V) mixtures by APM and MAP precipitations, were not altered by the precipitation process. This result confirms that PO3(III) is not converted into PO4(V) by oxidation or hydrolysis under either strong acidic/oxidizing (APM) or alkaline (MAP) conditions for up to a 24-h period.ConclusionsWe conclude that both APM and MAP precipitation are reliable and effective methods for the separation and purification of PO4(V) from aqueous PO3(III)/PO4(V) mixtures. The methods described here will permit the study of the isotopic evolution of various pathways of geochemical as well as biological PO3(III) oxidation.

This tissue regeneration often occurs in a bioreactor. Important challenges in tissue engineering include ensuring adequate nutrient supply, maintaining the desired cell distribution and achieving sufficiently high cell yield. To put laboratory experiments into a theoretical framework, mathematical modelling of the physical and biochemical processes involved in tissue growth is a useful tool. In this work, we derive and solve a model for a cell-seeded porous scaffold placed in a perfusion bioreactor in which fluid delivers nutrients to the cells. The model describes the key features, including fluid flow, nutrient delivery, cell proliferation and consequent variation of scaffold porosity. Fluid flow through the porous scaffold is modelled by Darcy's law, and nutrient delivery is described by a reaction-advection-diffusion equation. A reaction-diffusion equation describes the evolution of cell density, in which cell proliferation is modelled via logistic growth and cell spreading via non-linear diffusion, which depends on cell density. The effect of shear stress on nutrient consumption and cell proliferation is also included in the model. COMSOL (a commercial finite element solver) is used to solve the model numerically. The results reveal the dependence of the cell distribution and total cell yield on the initial cell density and scaffold porosity. We suggest various seeding strategies and scaffold designs to improve the cell distribution and total cell yield in the engineered tissue construct.									24	1	0	0	18	0	24			1477-8599			WOS:000316136400002	21994793

In the past decades, this technology has attracted worldwide attention, and considerable progress has been achieved. However, numerous critical scientific challenges remain to be solved for practical applications. A specific discussion of recent progress from the perspective of the stable aprotic Li-O-2 system with high energy efficiency is presented. The discussion is highlighted on the reaction mechanisms on air cathode, stability of cell components in semi-open surroundings, and improvement of battery performance by catalyst design. Challenges and perspectives are also presented. This study provides an intensive understanding of aprotic Li-O-2 batteries and offers an important guideline for developing reversible and high-efficiency Li-O-2 batteries.									304	23	0	0	11	0	305			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000379306400013

A competitive system economy demands development of cost-effective electrocatalyst with dual active sites for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, a single atom electrocatalyst derived from a metal-organic framework is proposed, in which Co single atoms and N functional groups function as atomic CO2RR and HER active sites, respectively. The synthesis method is based on pyrolysis of ZnO@ZIF (zeolitic imidazolate framework). The excess in situ Zn evaporation effectively prevents Co single atoms (approximate to 3.4 wt%) from aggregation and maintains appropriate Co/N ratio. The as-prepared electrocatalyst is featured with high graphitic degree of carbon support for rapid electron transport and sponge-like thin carbon shells with hierarchical pore system for facilitating active site exposure and mass transport. Therefore, the electrocatalyst exhibits a nearly 100% Faradic efficiency and a high formation rate of approximate to 425 mmol g(-1) h(-1) at 1.0 V with the gaseous product ratio (CO/H-2) approximating ideal 1/2. With the assistance of an extensive material characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is identified that Co single atoms are uniformly coordinated in the form of Co-C2N2 moieties, and act as the major catalytic sites for CO2 reduction.									71	5	0	0	3	0	73			2198-3844			WOS:000439842100023	30027049

Here, we report a model study of electro-oxidation of a Li2O2 film on an Au electrode using voltammetry coupled with in situ Raman spectroscopy. It was found that the charging reaction initializes at the positive electrode|Li2O2 interface, instead of the previously presumed Li2O2 surface, and consists of two temporally and spatially separated Li2O2 oxidation processes, accounting for the potential rise during charging of Li-O-2 batteries. Moreover, the electrode surface-initialized oxidation can disintegrate the Li2O2 film resulting in a loss of Li2O2 into electrolyte solution, which drastically decreases the charging efficiency and highlights the importance of using soluble electro-catalyst for the complete charging of Li-O-2 batteries.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1674-7291	1869-1870		WOS:000417935600005

Noble-metal phosphides are newly developed electrocatalysts that can function well at all pH values. Despite the pivotal role Os compounds have played in the progress of catalytic chemistry, its phosphides have never been demonstrated to mediate the HER. Herein, we report a new OsP2-based electrocatalyst that consists of fine OsP2 nanoparticles (NPs) dispersed over N,P co-doped carbon film (OsP2@NPC) using a combination of template and pyrolysis methods. Impressively, this novel OsP2@NPC exhibits improved HER activity compared with Os@NPC, with small overpotentials of 38, 54, and 70 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slopes of 40, 82, and 67 mV dec(-1), and better stability than commercial Pt/C in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1.0 M phosphate buffer solution, and 1.0 M KOH, respectively. The experimental and computational results indicate that both the unique structure of the porous interconnected network and the interaction between OsP2 NPs and NPC contribute to the robust activity. Meanwhile, the similar to 40 mV dec(-1) Tafel slope in 0.5 M H2SO4 and the density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest the predominant Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism for the OsP2-catalyzed HER, with electrochemical desorption of hydrogen as the rate-limiting step. This new electrocatalyst is expected to enlarge the growing family of transition metal phosphides for the HER. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this regard, numerous works have mainly been devoted to developing the appropriate photocatalyst which satisfies the conditions for water splitting and understanding the photocatalysis process. In this study, we propose for the first time the potential application of the two-dimensional Janus aluminum oxysulfide Al2OS as an efficient photocatalyst material for hydrogen-production H-2 through the first-principles calculations. Janus Al2OS monolayer has been designed from the parental binary aluminum sulfide AlS by substituting one sub-layer of sulfide atoms (S) to oxygen atoms (O). The electronic properties of the pristine AlS and the derived Janus Al2OS were computed using GGA-PBE and HSE06 functionals. According to the band structure, AlS monolayer shows a semiconductor behavior with an indirect bandgap of 2.14 eV whereas, the Janus Al2OS exhibits a direct bandgap of 1.579 eV. Motivated by the desirable bandgap of the Janus Al2OS, the absorption-coefficient of Janus Al2OS shows strong visible light harvesting compared to the parental AlS. Furthermore, the photocatalytic performance of Al2OS has been investigated. Our calculations demonstrate that the band edge position of Al2OS is suitable for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). More importantly, based on the reaction coordinate, it was found that the Gibbs free-energy Delta G(H*) of Al2OS is 0.97 eV which is smaller than of the two-dimensional Janus Ga2XY (X, Y = S, Se, Te with X not equal Y) reported recently. Moreover, this value decreases from 0.97 eV to 0.69 eV under 0.5 V/angstrom of an external electrical field. Our results indicate that Janus Al2OS fulfills the fundamental requirements for efficient photo-catalyst under visible light and provides new guidance for hydrogen-production via water splitting.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000780313400004

We have isolated cDNAs encoding CtpA, the carboxyl-terminal processing protease for the D1 protein, from two higher plants, spinach and barley, In each of these organisms, CtpA is encoded by a single copy nuclear gene, and its steady-state mRNA levels are light-regulated. The CtpA protein is detectable in etiolated material, and its level increases similar to 5-fold upon illumination. Moreover, the CtpA gene is expressed in shoot tissues and not in roots. In its precursor form, the CtpA protein harbors a bipartite transit sequence characteristic for thylakoid lumenal proteins. Cell fractionation studies demonstrated that CtpA is associated with thylakoid membranes and is resistant to treatments with thermolysin, consistent with its localization in the lumen of thylakoids. Comparisons of the sequence of the higher plant CtpA enzyme with those of other related carboxyl-terminal processing proteases suggest that these proteins constitute a new family of proteases.									58	6	0	0	56	0	66			0021-9258			WOS:A1996VF61200027	8702985	
J	Pareja, P; Molina, S; Amariglio, A; Amariglio, H								Isothermal conversion of methane into higher hydrocarbons and hydrogen by a two-step reaction sequence involving a rhodium catalyst								APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL				168	2			289	305		10.1016/S0926-860X(97)00360-8				MAR 27 1998	1998	A two-step reaction sequence for converting methane to higher hydrocarbons and hydrogen was investigated on a 5%Rh-5%CeO2/SiO2 catalyst. Isothermal cycles were carried out from room temperature to 275 degrees C and produced alkanes up to hexanes. In contrast with previous observations on platinum and ruthenium, the conversion was possible even at room temperature and two maxima versus temperature were evidenced. The first maximum occurred at about 100 degrees C while the second one took place beyond 200 degrees C. A noticeable selectivity to n-pentane was also observed. This work includes a study of the phenomena occurring during the exposure of the catalyst to flowing methane at atmospheric pressure (evolution of hydrogen at T greater than or equal to 100 degrees C and of ethane at T greater than or equal to 150 degrees C). A determination of the amounts of methane chemisorbed under various conditions of exposure as well as the evaluation of the WC ratios of the corresponding surface species was achieved. These quantities were derived from temperature programmed desorption (up to 300 degrees C) followed by reaction with hydrogen at room temperature and further temperature programmed surface reaction with hydrogen. Interpretations in line with those put forward in the case of platinum and ruthenium are proposed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			0926-860X			WOS:000073133500010		
J	Hagen, Bettina; Hoernes, Stephan; Roetzler, Jochen								Geothermometry of the ultrahigh-temperature Saxon granulites revisited. Part II: Thermal peak conditions and cooling rates inferred from oxygen-isotope fractionations								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MINERALOGY				20	6			1117	1133		10.1127/0935-1221/2008/0020-1858				NOV-DEC 2008	2008	Anhydrous mineral assemblages in felsic and mafic rocks from the Saxon Granulite Massif, part of the central European Variscan Belt, preserve O-isotope equilibrium fractionations recording temperatures of 1000-1020 degrees C. Although ultrahigh-temperature (UHT) metamorphism has been reported from Precambrian shields and Phanerozoic I-old belts, this is the first time that an independent confirmation of UHT conditions based on both I-isotopic and chemical equilibria in the very same set of samples is presented. The evidence comes from feldspathic prismatine granulite and garnet-two-pyroxene granulite, where decompression-related minerals and the whole rocks are in isotopic equilibrium. The rocks thus behaved as closed systems with respect to oxygen at least during early stages of exhumation.Based on isotopic fractionations between the whole rock and minerals that cease to exchange oxygen at high temperatures, the closed-system behaviour enabled us to estimate near-peak temperatures, even if the predominant minerals were reset during cooling. This has been demonstrated in several samples mainly for whole-rock/garnet fractionations, which indicate temperatures similar to or slightly higher than the multiphase equilibria. Average cooling rates calculated from O-isotopic disequilibrium assemblages using the program COOL (Jenkin et al., 199 1) are in the range of 50-80 degrees C/Ma and correspond to an average exhumation rate of 10 mm/a. The preservation of the UHT isotopic and chemical equilibria is due partly to rapid cooling, partly to anhydrous conditions during peak metamorphism and early cooling. Partial chemical and isotopic homogenisation of peak-metamorphic mineral compositions under anhydrous conditions suggests that the chemical and isotopic exchange reactions were essentially controlled by volume diffusion.

Therefore, numerous studies have been conducted to develop sustainable long-term and renewable alternative energy sources. The anodic electrode, which is one of the two-electrode system components, is an essential element for effective energy production. In general, precious metal-based electrocatalysts show high OER reactions from the anodic electrode, but it is difficult to scale up due to their low abundance and high cost. To overcome these problems, transition metal-based anodic electrodes, which exhibit advantages with respect to their low cost and high catalytic activities, are in the spotlight nowadays. Among them, stainless steel is a material with a high ratio of transition metal components, i.e., Fe, Ni, and Cr, and has excellent corrosion resistance and low cost. However, stainless steel shows low electrochemical performance due to its slow sluggish kinetics and lack of active sites. In this study, we fabricated surface modified electrodes by two methods: (i) anodization and (ii) hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) immersion treatments. As a result of comparing the two methods, the change of the electrode surface and the electrochemical properties were not confirmed in the H2O2 immersion method. On the other hand, the porous electrode (PE) fabricated through electrochemical anodization shows a low charge transfer resistance (R-ct) and high OER activity due to its large surface area compared to the conventional electrode (CE). These results confirm that the synthesis process of H2O2 immersion is an unsuitable method for surface modification. In contrast, the PE fabricated by anodization can increase the OER activity by providing high adsorption of reactants through surface modification.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2073-4344		WOS:000667383100001

Herein, we combine catalyst and electrolyte engineering to achieve a high-efficiency NRR enabled by a Se-vacancy-rich WSe2-x, catalyst in water-in-salt electrolyte (WISE). Extensive characterizations, theoretical calculations, and in situ X-ray photoelectron/Raman spectroscopy reveal that WISE ensures suppressed H-2 evolution, improved N-2 affinity on the catalyst surface, as well as an enhanced pi-back-donation ability of active sites, thereby promoting both activity and selectivity for the NRR. As a result, an excellent faradaic efficiency of 62.5% and NH3 yield of 181.3 mu g h(-1) mg(-1) is achieved with WSe2-x in 12 m LiClO4, which is among the highest NRR performances reported to date.									27	0	0	0	0	0	27			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000812148900068	35451836

The average H-2 evolution rate over the optimized Ni2P/Zn3In2S6 under simulated sunlight can reach up to 6.4 mmol g(-1) h(-1), which is about 3.4 and 2.6 times higher than that of pure Zn3In2S6 and Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid. The excellent photocatalytic performance can be attributed to the interaction between the well-dispersed ultrafine Ni2P cocatalyst and the 2D-3D Zn3In2S6 hierarchical structure, which contributes to the separation and transportation of the photoinduced charge carriers.									34	10	0	0	6	0	34			1566-7367	1873-3905		WOS:000474675100005

The hollow tubular structure has the functions of increasing the specific surface area, promoting the multiple scattering effect of light, as well as imparting the directional transfer of electrons. Simultaneously, the introduction of vacancy defect can manipulate the electronic structure of g-C3N4 with narrow band-gap and excellent charge carrier behavior. The catalytic activity of the photocatalysts were evaluated by the degradation reaction of chlortetracycline hydrochloride (CTC center dot HCl) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The results indicated that the photocatalytic property of the resulting g-C3N4 tube with appropriate nitrogen vacancy was significantly better than that of original g-C3N4. Under visible light irradiation, ND-TCN-10 demonstrated the optimal photocatalytic degradation effect and achieved a hydrogen generation rate of 235.68 mu mol g(-1) h(-1). In addition, based on the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), the main by-products of CTC center dot HCl and the possible degradation pathways were analyzed. The method of introducing nitrogen deficiency into the tubular structure provides a promising strategy for increasing the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4-based materials.									47	3	0	0	12	0	47			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000573790700007

Herein, effective HER electrocatalysts based on metal-carbon composites are prepared by controlled pyrolysis of resin containing a variety of heavy metals. For the first time, Cr2O3 nanoparticles of 3-6 nm in diameter homogeneously dispersed in the resulting porous carbon framework (Cr-C hybrid) is synthesized as efficient HER electrocatalyst. Electrochemical measurements show that Cr-C hybrids display a high HER activity with an onset potential of -49 mV (vs reversible hydrogen electrode), a Tafel slope of 90 mV dec(-1), a large catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at -123 mV, and the prominent electrochemical durability. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic measurements confirm that electron transfer occurs from Cr2O3 into carbon, which is consistent with the reported metal@carbon systems. The obtained correlation between metals and HER activities may be exploited as a rational guideline in the design and engineering of HER electrocatalysts.									28	3	0	0	2	0	28			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000378424400011	27061759

They generate catalytic gas 300 degrees below thermal cracking temperatures, discontinuously in aperiodic episodes, and lose these properties on exposure to trace amounts of oxygen. Here we report a surprising reversal in hydrocarbon generation. Heavy hydrocarbons are formed before light hydrocarbons resulting in wet gas at the onset of generation grading to dryer gas over time. The effect is moderate under gas flow and substantial in closed reactions. In sequential closed reactions at 100 degrees C, gas from a Cretaceous Mowry shale progresses from predominately heavy hydrocarbons (66% C(5), 2% C(1)) to predominantly light hydrocarbons (56% C(1), 8% C(5)), the opposite of that expected from desorption of preexisting hydrocarbons. Differences in catalyst substrate composition explain these dynamics. Gas flow should carry heavier hydrocarbons to catalytic sites, in contrast to static conditions where catalytic sites are limited to in-place hydrocarbons. In-place hydrocarbons and their products should become lighter with conversion thus generating lighter hydrocarbon over time, consistent with our experimental results.We recognize the similarities between low-temperature gas generation reported here and the natural progression of wet gas to dry gas over geologic time. There is now substantial evidence for natural catalytic activity in source rocks. Natural gas at thermodynamic equilibrium and the results reported here add to that evidence. Natural catalysis provides a plausible and unique explanation for the origin and evolution of gas in sedimentary basins.									7	0	0	0	1	0	9			1467-4866			WOS:000272219400001	19900271

The development of composite coating with a homogeneous dispersion of GO was achieved using an optimal Ni-W plating bath loaded with GO. The electrocatalytic efficacy of the coating for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was tested using cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry techniques in 1.0 M KOH medium. The variation in electrocatalytic activity with the addition of GO was studied. A significant increase in the electrocatalytic activity towards HER was found. The improvement in electrocatalytic activity of Ni-W-GO composite coating was ascribed to the intersticed GO nanoparticles in the alloy matrix, evidenced by different advanced methods of analyses, like Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD).

Herein, rice-grain-shaped iron oxide hollow structures were synthesized via a hydrothermal process using a silk fibrous template, and the crystalline phases (alpha-Fe2O3, Fe3O4) were controlled by annealing. These structures were applied in a lithium-oxygen battery cathode and as adsorbents for wastewater treatment. The porosity, hollow interior, surface area, surface chemical composition and efficient carbon matrix of the C/Fe3O4 hollow granules obtained by annealing under Ar atmosphere were favorable for enhancing the oxygen reduction and evolution kinetics when applied as an electrocatalyst for lithium-oxygen batteries, and also led to superior adsorption of organic pollutants (Rhodamine B) from an aqueous medium. The C/Fe3O4 hollow granules were uniformly distributed and confined in the 3D nanoarchitecture; this morphology can offer rapid ion transport with improved electronic and chemical kinetics as well as superior adsorption of organic pollutants.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			1884-4049	1884-4057		WOS:000415904900004

Recently, multiple studies have found that AAP bacteria are widely distributed in oceans and estuaries and may play an important role in carbon cycling. However, AAP bacteria in inland lake ecosystems have not been investigated in depth. In this study, the abundance and diversity of the pufL-M genes, encoding photosynthetic reaction centers of AAP bacteria, were determined in the oxic water column and anoxic sediments of saline lakes (Qinghai, Erhai, and Gahai Lakes) on the Tibetan Plateau, China. Our results indicated that AAP bacteria were abundant in inland lakes, with the proportion of AAP bacteria (in total bacteria) comparable to those in the oceans, but with a lower diversity. Salinity and pH were found to be potential factors controlling the AAP bacterial diversity and community composition. Our data have implications for a better understanding of the potential role of AAP bacteria in carbon cycling in inland lake ecosystems.									42	11	0	0	43	0	54			0168-6496	1574-6941		WOS:000261961900009	19016867

The temperature-and electric field-dependent dielectric constants show that the antiferroelectric (AFE) phase stability is enhanced via the La doping. Neutron diffraction was performed to obtain insights into the structural evolution with composition and temperature, where the local structural variation is found to involve subtle ion displacement as well as oxygen octahedral tilting, leading to the disruption of the long-range interactions, which is responsible for the enhanced AFE phase stability. As expected, the enhanced AFE phase stability, together with the improved breakdown strength, gives rise to a high energy density of 4.4 J cm(-3) and an improved efficiency of 70%, which are achieved in 2 mol% La-doped AgNbO3 ceramics. Our research opens a new way to tailor the macroscopic properties by tuning the microstructure of AgNbO3-based materials.									132	6	0	0	4	0	131			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000457546000029

Herein, in order to increase the number of the active sites and fasten the charge transfer of NiCo2S4, a facile two-step solvothermal method is used to prepare superdispersed NiCo2S4 nanoparticles anchored on reduced graphene oxide (NCS/rGO) as low-cost and high-efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). By modulating the amount of rGO, the as-prepared NCS/rGO composite shows high specific surface area of 114.4 m2 g-1 and small particle size of 50-60 nm, which exhibits excellent HER activity with a lower overpotential of 115 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and a smaller charge transfer resistance of 12 omega in acidic solution. Additionally, in the case of alkaline solution, the as-prepared NCS/rGO composite also exhibits a low overpotential of 241 mV and a small Tafel slope of 110 mV dec-1. The significantly improved HER performance of NCS/rGO composite can be ascribed to the constructed heterogeneous interface between NiCo2S4 nanoparticles and rGO, which can inhibit the aggregation of NiCo2S4 nanoparticles and enhance the intrinsic electrical conductivity. In light of the excellent HER electrocatalytic performance, the inexpensive NCS/rGO composite might be regarded as a promising alternative in HER and other energy conversion and storage applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0925-8388	1873-4669		WOS:000812994000003

In this study, nano-zeolite Y (50-150 nm range) and micro-zeolite Y (500-800 nm range) were loaded with WO3, by impregnating the zeolite support with ammonium metatungstate and thermally decomposing the salt thereafter. Two different loadings of WO3 were studied, 3 wt.% and 5 wt.% with respect to the overall catalyst. The prepared catalysts were characterized for their morphology, structure, and surface areas through scanning electron microscope (SEM), XRD, and BET. They were further compared for their electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 0.5 MH2SO4. On comparing the bare micro-zeolite particles with the nano-form, the nano-zeolite Y showed higher currents with comparable overpotentials and lower Tafel slope of 62.36 mV/dec. WO3 loading brought about a change in the electrocatalytic properties of the catalyst. The overpotentials and Tafel slopes were observed to decrease with zeolite-3 wt.% WO3. The smallest overpotential of 60 mVand Tafel slope of 31.9 mV/dec was registered for nano-zeolite with 3 wt.% WO3, while the micro-zeolite gave an overpotential of 370 mV and a Tafel slope of 98.1 mV/dec. It was concluded that even with the same metal oxide loading, nano-zeolite showed superior performance, which is attributed to its size and hence easier escape of hydrogen bubbles from the catalyst.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			1388-0764	1572-896X		WOS:000425601900002

Herein, with the aid of divinyl functionalized ionic liquids, uniformly distributed Ru nanoparticles (NPs) on nitrogen-doped carbon frameworks are obtained via an in situ confined polymerization strategy. Attributed to the unique lamellar structure and confinement effect of carbon supports, the optimized homo-PIL-Ru/C-600 (with Ru 10 wt%) catalyst exhibits superior catalytic efficiency for the hydrogen evolution reaction with the overpotential of only 16 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and the corresponding Tafel slope of only 42 mV dec(-1). Moreover, the performance can be well reserved even after 10 000 cycles, demonstrating excellent stability and promising potentials for industrial application. This work not only provides a facile approach for the preparation of highly efficient Ru-based catalysts, but also guides the synthesis of other highly dispersed metallic NPs for special applications.									9	1	0	0	1	0	10			2366-9608			WOS:000663166100001	34927987

The heterogeneous reaction is measured in a photochemical flow tube reactor in which chlorine atoms are produced by the photolysis of Cl(2) at 365 nm. By monitoring the heterogeneous reaction, using a vacuum ultraviolet photoionization aerosol mass spectrometer, the effective reactive uptake coefficient and the distributions of both oxygenated and chlorinated reaction products are measured and found to depend sensitively upon O(2), Cl(2), and Cl concentrations in the flow reactor. In the absence of O(2), the effective reactive uptake coefficient monotonically increases with Cl(2) concentration to a value of similar to 3, clearly indicating the presence of secondary chain chemistry occurring in the condensed phase. The effective uptake coefficient decreases with increasing O(2) approaching a diffusion corrected value of 0.65 +/- 0.07, when 20% of the total nitrogen flow rate in the reactor is replaced with O(2). Using a kinetic model it is found that the amount of secondary chemistry and the product distributions in the aerosol phase are controlled by the competitive reaction rates of O(2) and Cl(2) with alkyl radicals. The role that a heterogeneous pathway might play in the reaction of alkyl radicals with O(2) and Cl(2) is investigated within a reasonable range of reaction parameters. These results show, more generally, that for heterogeneous reactions involving secondary chain chemistry, time and radical concentration are not interchangeable kinetic quantities, but rather the observed reaction rate and product formation chemistry depends sensitively upon the concentrations and time evolution of radical initiators and those species that propagate or terminate free radical chain reactions.									29	0	0	0	4	0	29			1463-9076			WOS:000289955000043	21455529

At a low MnCO3 content (y <= 2.0 wt%), weak diffuseness is visible, while strong diffuseness is observed for a higher MnCO3 content. For x = 0.01 and 0.01 <= y <= 0.02, high tunability is attributed to the small cooperative displacements of Ti4+ ions in the close packed oxygen octahedra of the BST system. The Q value gradually increases with y, potentially due to the microstructural evolution of the BST lattice structure characterized by Raman spectra. Interestingly, the high Q value of the composition with x = 0.01 and y >= 0.05 is in a wide frequency range, which may play an important role in the engineering of the electric-field tunable microwave elements.									23	2	0	0	0	0	24			0022-3727			WOS:000264385900047

Different characterization techniques, including XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, DRS, PL, EIS, and photocurrent generation, are performed to investigate the structural and optical properties of the as-prepared samples. The results indicate that the Bi particles are generated inside and outside of reduced TiO2 microspheres via the reduction of Ti4+ and Bi3+ by ethylene glycol. When the annealing temperature is controlled at 300 degrees C, the corresponding Bi@R-TiO2-300 sample with an appropriate amount of Bi nanoparticles exhibits the highest full solar spectrum photocatalytic oxygen evolution activity (4728.709 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)), which is 5.9 and 9.5 times higher than that of pure TiO2 and Bi-Ti bimetal organic frameworks (Bi-Ti-MOFs). Several reasons are suggested for the above results: (1) Bi metal behaves as an "electron acceptor" to accelerate the charge carrier transfer from TiO2 to Bi; (2) The surface plasmon resonance effect of loaded metallic Bi particles can enhance the visible and NIR light absorption capacity; (3) The generation of Ti3+ further narrows the band gap of TiO2.

In this work, a Mn doped cobalt phosphide (CoP) electrocatalyst coated electrode was prepared from CoMn LDH precursors by a unipolar pulse electro-deposition (UPED) method combined with a thermal phosphorization process. Experimental results indicated that the Mn-CoP coated electrode needed a much lower overpotential than the original CoP coated one in the same current density for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in water splitting. The CoP coated electrode required an overpotential of 127 mV to support 10 mA cm(-2) current density in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, and in contrast, the Mn-CoP coated one required only 108 mV overpotential to support the same current density. Furthermore, in the 1.0 M KOH solution, the Mn-CoP coated electrode revealed better performance, and the overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) current density was reduced to as low as 95 mV.									51	1	0	0	0	0	51			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000444242800013

They are compared to recent precise nebular abundances in a sample of Galactic planetary nebulae (PNe) that is divided among double-dust chemistry (DC) and oxygen-dust chemistry (OC) according to the infrared dust features. Unlike the similar subsample of Galactic carbon-dust chemistry PNe recently analysed by us, here the individual abundance errors, the higher metallicity spread, and the uncertain dust types/subtypes in some PNe do not allow a clear determination of the AGB progenitor masses (and formation epochs) for both PNe samples; the comparison is thus more focused on a object-by-object basis. The lowest metallicity OC PNe evolve from low-mass (similar to 1 M-circle dot) O-rich AGBs, while the higher metallicity ones (all with uncertain dust classifications) display a chemical pattern similar to the DC PNe. In agreement with recent literature, the DC PNe mostly descend from high-mass (M >= 3.5 M-circle dot) solar/supersolar metallicity AGBs that experience hot bottom burning (HBB), but other formation channels in low-mass AGBs like extra mixing, stellar rotation, binary interaction, or He pre-enrichment cannot be disregarded until more accurate C/O ratios would be obtained. Two objects among the DC PNe show the imprint of advanced CNO processing and deep second dredge-up, suggesting progenitors masses close to the limit to evolve as core collapse supernovae (above 6M(circle dot)). Their actual C/O ratio, if confirmed, indicate contamination from the third dredge-up, rejecting the hypothesis that the chemical composition of such high-metallicity massive AGBs is modified exclusively by HBB.									11	0	0	0	0	1	11			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000383272500042		
J	Shervedani, Reza Karimi; Amini, Akbar								Sulfur-doped graphene as a catalyst support: Influences of carbon black and ruthenium nanoparticles on the hydrogen evolution reaction performance								CARBON				93				762	773		10.1016/j.carbon.2015.05.088				NOV 2015	2015	We develop an efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) based on sulfur doped graphene nanosheets (S-GNs) synthesized with simple, cost effective and scalable method. The structure and morphological characteristics of the fabricated catalysts are investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray diffraction microanalysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy and electrochemical methods such as voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Electrochemical results show that glassy carbon modified S-GNs heattreated at 1000 degrees C (GCE-S-GNs-1000) benefit of a good activity toward HER compared to GNs. To improve the characteristics of S-GNs and prevent agglomeration of the layers, the GCE-S-GNs-1000-CB-Ru is fabricated by insertion of carbon black (CB) into S-GNs1000, and further modification of GCE-S-GNs-1000-CB with ruthenium nanoparticles. The GCE-S-GNs-1000-CB-Ru demonstrated excellent performance for the HER, compared with its ancestors GCE-GNs-1000, GCE-GNs-1000-CB, GCE-S-GNs-1000, GCE-S-GNs-1000-CB as well as with traditional catalysts such as WS2 and MOS2. Analysis of the results obtained by the EIS showed that the increase in the activity of the electrode was partially originated from increase in the double layer capacitance (surface roughness effect) and mostly from increase in the intrinsic activity (synergistic effect).

Therefore, the development of renewable clean energy to replace traditional fossil fuels has become the focus of research. In this study, nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)(2)) composite was prepared by a simple hydrothermal method. Transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize its morphology and structure. The results proved the successful preparation of the Ni(OH)(2) composite and show that the prepared composite has a three-dimensional flower-like structure. In addition, the electrochemical performance of the prepared Ni(OH)(2) composite was investigated under the three-electrode system. The three-dimensional flower-like structure of the composite can make the electrode and electrolyte fully contact, providing a rapid transfer path for ions and electrons to improve the electrochemical performance of the electrode material. This work provides new ideas for the preparation of self-assembled nickel-based materials and the wide application in electrocatalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1058-4587	1607-8489		WOS:000698611500011

Sulfation of the noble metal and the support material led to pronounced catalyst deactivation. A pronounced transfer of sulfates to the support, particularly alumina, only partially protects the noble metal. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy gave insight into the nature and evolution of Pd species during regenerative treatment. Although palladium sulfate that formed during poisoning is decomposed at approximately 200 degrees C in oxygen-free conditions, support regeneration requires higher temperatures, which result in PdS formation above 400 degrees C. Despite its high stability under rich conditions, PdS decomposition by oxidation in lean atmosphere leads to the recovery of the activity. In addition, water vapor that is present during the rich regeneration exhibited a beneficial effect on the regeneration with higher catalytic activity after regeneration.									16	5	0	0	3	0	19			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000564575200007

Herein, WC-embedded graphite carbon films (WC@GCFs) were successfully fabricated as co-catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) via an in-situ carbonization technique. The mass specific activity of the WC@GCFs loading Pt NPs is 278 mA mg(-1) Pt and 277 mA mg(-1) Pt under the overpotential of 48 and 52 mV, which is 1.3 and 1.45 times higher than those of the commercial Pt-C (212.8 mA mg(-1) Pt and 191.4 mA mg(-1) Pt). The WC@GCFs-Pt displays excellent high stability for HER in acidic and alkaline media even after 50 00 potential cycles. As expected, the GCFs originated from the surface of WC can effectively prevent WC particles from agglomeration, which contributes to high catalytic activity and stability of WC. The in-situ formed GCFs possesses ultrathin edges (similar to 5 carbon layers), high degree of graphitization, and some oxygen-containing function groups. Charges are easily transferred from Pt NPs to WC via the linked-GCFs, which contributes to the high HER activity of WC@GCFs-Pt. We believe this work can provide a more economical and efficient route for large-scale synthesis of graphite carbon films coated transition metal carbide as co-catalysts in electrochemical fields.

One of the key challenges in electrochemical CO2 reduction is the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at reduction electrode potentials. In this work, we used a hybrid material composed of pyrolyzed zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to selectively catalyze electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO in aqueous solution with close to 100% faradaic efficiency and a current density up to 7.7 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 740 mV. The MWCNT support is crucial to achieving superior selectivity, thanks to enhanced electron transport on the MWCNT network and expedited CO2 transport in the mesoporous structure constructed by the MWCNTs. Moreover, doping Fe into the hybrid further reduces the overpotential of CO2 reduction to 440 mV with a current density of 2 mA cm(-2) and a CO faradaic efficiency of 97%. This work highlights the importance of optimizing electron and mass transport in turning moderate catalysts into superior ones with high activity and selectivity for CO2 reduction.									52	5	0	0	2	0	53			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000417063200038

The Ni-Fe-Sn60 electrode obtained after 1 h deposition exhibits cauliflower-like morphology and the best electrocatalytic properties for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) compared to other electrodes. The electrode requires an overpotential of 43 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 70 mV dec(-1) in a 1 M KOH solution. Moreover, the electrode shows outstanding stability in prolonged electrolysis and overall water splitting performance, generating a current density of 93 mA cm(-2) at 1.8 V, which is thrice that of an industry electrode. This electrocatalytic activity is ascribed to the high active surface area produced by the cauliflower-like Ni-Fe-Sn particles and the synergistic interaction of Ni, Fe and Sn. The simple synthesis method and excellent performance endow this electrode with great potential for large-scale applications. (c) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Summers, David P.; Khare, Bishun								Nitrogen fixation on early Mars and other terrestrial planets: Experimental demonstration of abiotic fixation reactions to nitrite and nitrate								ASTROBIOLOGY				7	2			333	341		10.1089/ast.2006.0032				APR 2007	2007	Understanding the abiotic fixation of nitrogen is critical to understanding planetary evolution and the potential origin of life on terrestrial planets. Nitrogen, an essential biochemical element, is certainly necessary for life as we know it to arise. The loss of atmospheric nitrogen can result in an incapacity to sustain liquid water and impact planetary habitability and hydrological processes that shape the surface. However, our current understanding of how such fixation may occur is almost entirely theoretical. This work experimentally examines the chemistry, in both gas and aqueous phases, that would occur from the formation of NO and CO by the shock heating of a model carbon dioxide/nitrogen atmosphere such as is currently thought to exist on early terrestrial planets. The results show that two pathways exist for the abiotic fixation of nitrogen from the atmosphere into the crust: one via HNO and another via NO2. Fixation via HNO, which requires liquid water, could represent fixation on a planet with liquid water (and hence would also be a source of nitrogen for the origin of life). The pathway via NO2 does not require liquid water and shows that fixation could occur even when liquid water has been lost from a planet's surface (for example, continuing to remove nitrogen through NO2 reaction with ice, adsorbed water, etc.).									43	1	0	0	27	0	43			1531-1074	1557-8070		WOS:000246680700004	17480164

The MoS2/PQ composite photocatalyst was prepared via a facile procedure and was fully characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and UV-vis spectroscopy. Layered MoS2 was incorporated on the PQ surface and served as electron traps. This allowed active sites to efficiently promote the separation of photogenerated carriers, thus facilitating the photocatalytic production of hydrogen from water. The effects of the MoS2 loading on the PQ morphology and the pH of the reaction have been evaluated using triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial reductant. The photocatalytic results showed that the MoS2/PQ composite photocatalyst manifested the highest H-2 production rate of 79.5 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) under visible light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm) at a MoS2 concentration of 0.5 wt%, which exceeds the optimized photocatalytic H-2 evolution activity of Pt-loaded PQ (Pt/PQ) photocatalyst. The heterogeneous catalyst could be readily recovered and recycled at least three times without a significant loss of activity. This study provides new insights into solar-to-energy conversion using composite photocatalysts that are free of noble metals, are environmentally friendly and are responsive to visible light.

Engineering surface-active facets of the metal cocatalyst on the surface of 3-dimensional (3D) structured photocatalysts not only efficiently promotes charge separation and transfer but also serves as reaction active sites for the further development of advanced photocatalysts. Herein, taking 3D SrTiO3 (STO) as a model, we introduce a plasmonic photocatalyst involving the adjusted loading of well-defined Ag active components as a cocatalyst deposited on the surface of 3D STO nanocubes to form the binary Ag/STO nanostructures for photocatalytic behavior driven by light at wavelengths of 365 nm and 420 nm. After the incorporation of the functional cocatalyst, the photocurrent response of STO was substantially increased, while its photoluminescence emission significantly declined, which could be due to the Schottky channel and enrichment of surface reactants: (i) the enhancement of the interfacial separation and inhibition of the recombination process of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs; and (ii) the Ag arrangement on the 3D structure could not only promote the enhanced light absorption but also provide a large surface area with highly active sites for the photocatalytic reaction. The as-synthesized hybrid photocatalyst with a loading content of 1 wt% Ag displays a high photocatalytic H2 evolution and RhB degradation reaching 30 mu mol g-1 h-1 (H2 gas) and a rate constant (k) of 0.027 min-1 (RhB dye), which was 2.5, and 3.4 times higher than that of the pristine STO specimen (12.5 mu mol g-1 h-1 and k = 0.008 min-1, respectively, at 385 nm). Under a wavelength of 420 nm, the binary Ag/STO structures exhibited excellent performance for the H2 production (17.5 mu mol g-1 h-1) and RhB degradation (k = 0.0134 min-1) in comparison with the pristine STO specimen. They also demonstrated remarkable stability for H2 evolution and dye degradation performance in continuous cycles. Based on the experimental outcomes, an energy band outline and a plausible mechanism have been proposed to describe the charge transfer and separation process for enhanced HER activity and RhB degradation.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0925-8388	1873-4669		WOS:000806054300002

In essence, surface reactive oxygen species (ROS) is crucial for the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants in wastewater. Recently, the direct conversion of clean and renewable solar energy to heat to drive the activation process of oxygen is a highly effective and desirable way to use solar energy. However, it still remains a challenge to develop a flexible and versatile method to enhance the efficiency of photocatalysis. Herein, we report a new strategy for designing and constructing a C@TiO2 yolk-shell (YS) heterostructure with excellent photo-thermal conversion ability to achieve highly photo-thermal catalytic degradation of RhB under visible light irradiation, consisting of a tunable hydrothermal carbon sphere (CS) core covered by TiO2 shells. This approach integrates the hetero-interfacial charge carrier management, the photothermal excitation of the CS core and the injection of hot electrons into the TiO2 shells, leads to reliably boosted hot electron generation and transfer, and further promotes the activation of dissolved oxygen in water, consequently enhancing the visible light driven catalysis. The YS architecture and the photothermal effect interplay of the C@TiO2 heterostructure are comprehensively studied and optimized. Such a YS heterostructure photo-thermocatalyst concept provides a novel approach for effective utilization of solar energy, and coupling with the CS photothermal effect in a traditional catalytic process is a promising strategy for large-scale environmental and energy applications.									46	2	0	0	10	0	46			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000509343800022

The activation mechanism originates from the conversion of the surface layer of CoMoO4 to Co(OH)(2) nanosheets, together with the release of Mo3O102- ions into the activation solution. Our experimental and calculated results suggest that the Co(OH)(2) nanosheets on the surface of the CoMoO4-based microrod arrays show the ability to improve water molecule disassociation and stabilize the catalytic activity of the two-component catalysts by decreasing their overpotentials in the hydrogen evolution reaction. When extending this strategy to activate P-doped CoMoO4 with a low hydrogen absorption free energy, we report the synthesis of a new class of superior neutral electrochemical hydrogen evolution catalysts of P-doped CoMoO4 -Co(OH)(2) microrod arrays. We show that a low overpotential of about 30 mV (obtained from bulk electrolysis) is required to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in the neutral media. By making use of our catalyst and NiFe double hydroxide as cathodic and anodic electrodes, respectively, we fabricated a two-electrode electrolysis device for neutral overall water splitting. Our results showed a low cell voltage of 1.78 V (obtained from bulk electrolysis) that is needed for delivering a current density of about 10 mA cm(-2) in the neutral electrolyte, even outperforming the state-of-the-art catalyst combination of Pt/C parallel to RuO2 in terms of catalytic activity and stability. These findings suggest that our strategy may be utilized as a facile but useful strategy toward the activation of molybdate catalysts to improve their HER performance in both basic and neutral media.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000550633400092	32526140

Platinum nanoparticles are well dispersed in CTF-T1, which is ascribed to the synergistic effects of the coordination of triazine moieties and the nanoscale confinement effect of CTFs. CTF-T1 exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity and stability for H-2 evolution in the presence of platinum under visible light irradiation ( 420 nm). The activity and stability of CTF-T1 are comparable to those of g-C3N4. Importantly, as a result of the tailorable electronic and spatial structures of CTFs that can be achieved through the judicial selection of monomers, CTFs not only show great potential as organic semiconductor for photocatalysis but also may provide a molecular-level understanding of the inherent heterogeneous photocatalysis.									195	14	0	0	14	0	199			1022-1336	1521-3927		WOS:000363217600005	26292975

Non-uniform use of synonymous codons during translation, known as codon usage bias (CUB), depends on the balance between mutations bias and natural selection. We estimated different CUB indices, i.e. the effective number of codons (ENC), G + C content in the 3rd codon positions (GC(3)), and codon adaptation index for CDSs of intrinsic proteins of photosystem II (PSII), such as psbA (D1), psbD (D2), psbB (CP47), psbC (CP43), and CDSs of the extrinsic protein psbO (PsbO). These genes occur in all organisms that perform oxygenic photosynthesis (OP) on Earth: cyanobacteria, algae and plants. Comparatively, a similar analysis of codon bias for CDSs of L and M subunits that constitute the core proteins of the type II reaction centre (RCII) in anoxygenic bacteria was performed. Analysis of CUB indices and determination of the number of synonymous (d(S)) and nonsynonymous substitutions (d(N)) in all analysed CDSs indicated that the crucial PSII and RCII proteins were under strong purifying (negative) selection in course of evolution. Purifying selection was also estimated for CDSs of atpA, the alpha subunit of ATP synthase, an enzyme that was most likely already present in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA). The data obtained point to an ancient origin of OP, even in the earliest stages of the evolution of life on Earth.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000804508100002	35648248	
J	Chen, Pei; Fu, Meiyan; Deng, Hucheng; Xu, Wang; Wu, Dong; He, Puwei; Guo, Hengwei								The Diagenetic Alteration of the Carbonate Rocks from the Permian Qixia Formation as Response to Two Periods of Hydrothermal Fluids Charging in the Central Uplift of Sichuan Basin, SW China								MINERALS				11	11					1212	10.3390/min11111212				NOV 2021	2021	The hydrothermal fluid-carbonate rock reaction is frequently regarded to occur in deep-burial diagenesis, and the hydrothermal dissolution is usually distributed and takes place along the faults. Previous studies have suggested that there was hydrothermal fluid activity locally in the Permian Qixia Formation in Sichuan Basin, likely related to the Emeishan basalt eruption. However, the effect of hydrothermal fluids on the carbonate rocks of the Qixia Formation in the central uplift of Sichuan Basin is still unclear. Based on the characteristics and geochemical parameters of the diagenetic minerals, this study aims to reveal the diagenetic alteration related to the hydrothermal fluid-rock reaction in the Qixia Formation and reestablish the diagenetic evolution by using the timing of diagenetic mineral precipitation. The methods include petrographic observation; trace and rare earth element (REE) analysis; C, O and Sr isotope measurement; fluid inclusion temperature measurement and cathodoluminescence analysis. According to the petrographic characteristics, the dolostones are mainly of crystalline structure, namely fine-medium crystalline dolostone, meso-coarse crystalline dolostone, and coarse crystalline dolostone, with the cathodoluminescence color becoming brighter in that order. The limestones from the Qixia Formation are of the bioclastic limestone type, with no cathodoluminescence color. Compared with dolostones, limestones have higher Sr content, lower Mn content, and heavier oxygen isotopes. With the crystalline size of dolostone becoming coarser, the oxygen isotopes of dolostones tend to become lighter. The meso-coarse crystalline dolostone has the highest Mn content and negative carbon isotope. Both limestones and dolostones have an obvious positive Eu anomaly in the Qixia Formation. However, the REE patterns of fine-medium crystalline dolostones are very different from those of meso-coarse crystalline dolostones. It is credible that there were two periods of hydrothermal fluid charging, with different chemical compositions. The first period of hydrothermal fluids could laterally migrate along the sequence boundary. Fine-medium crystalline dolostones were almost completely distributed below the sequence boundary and were dolomitized during the shallow burial period. As products of the hydrothermal fluid-dolostone reaction, the saddle-shaped dolomites in the meso-coarse crystalline dolostones were the evidence of the second period of hydrothermal fluids. As a result, the dolomitization model was established according to the timing of diagenetic mineral precipitation, which can improve that the geological understanding of the effect of hydrothermal fluid activities on the carbonate rocks in the Qixia Formation.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2075-163X		WOS:000724819900001

We propose a layered hydrosphere prior to 3.2 Ga in which sulfate produced by atmospheric photolytic reactions was enriched in an upper layer, whereas the underlying layer was reduced and sulfur-poor. Between 3.2 and 2.4 Ga, sulfate reduction removed sulfate from the upper layer, producing broadly uniform, reduced, sulfur-poor and iron-rich oceans. As a result of increasing atmospheric oxygenation around 2.4 Ga, the flux of sulfate into the hydrosphere by oxidative weathering was greatly enhanced, producing layered oceans, with sulfate-enriched, iron-poor surface waters and reduced, sulfur-poor and iron-rich bottom waters. The rate at which this process proceeded varied between basins depending on the size and local environment of the basin. By 1.8 Ga, the hydrosphere was relatively sulfate-rich and iron-poor throughout. Variations in sulfur and iron abundances suggest that the redox state of the oceans was buffered by iron before 2.4 Ga and by sulfur after 1.8 Ga. Crown Copyright (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Photoelectrochemical cell with chemical bias, involving photo-anode in form of TiO2 film deposited on conducting indium tin oxide (ITO) film and Pt as cathode, is developed. The effect of conducting ITO layer on photo-voltage is studied by varying the thickness of ITO films. Constant H-2 generation rate is obtained for long period of time by both the TiO2 films because of the separated evolution of H-2 and O-2 gas, thus eliminating the back-reaction effect. Sputter-deposited film as compared to sol-gel-synthesized film showed better H-2 generation rate, mainly explained in terms of the higher visible light absorption achieved by oxygen vacancies created in the TiO2 film by the energetic target ions during deposition in pure Ar gas pressure.

Thus, the design and preparation of efficient ORR electrocatalysts is of high importance. In this work, we successfully prepared a series of nitrogen-doped graphene-like carbon nanosheets (NCNSs) with large pore volumes of up to 1.244 cm(3) g(-1) and high level of N dopants (5.3-6.8 at%) via a one-step, in-situ reactive template strategy by co-pyrolysis of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and dicyandiamide (DICY) as the precursors at 1000 degrees C. The DICY-derived graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets could act as the hard template for the confined growth of 2D carbon nanosheets, and the further increase in the pyrolysis temperature could directly remove off the g-C3N4 template by complete decomposition and simultaneously dope N atoms within the carbon nanosheets. The pyridinic and graphitic nitrogen groups are dominant among various N functional groups in the NCNSs. The NCNS_1:10 prepared with the HPMC/DICY mass ratio of 1/10 can be used as the metal-free ORR electrocatalysts with optimal activity (onset potential: 0.1 V vs. SCE; limiting current density: 4.8 mA cm(-2)) in 0(2)-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte among the NCNSs. Moreover, the NCNS_1:10 demonstrates a dominant four electron reduction process, as well as excellent long-term operation stability and outstanding methanol crossover resistance. The excellent ORR activity of the NCNS_1:10 should be mainly owing to high contents of pyridinic and graphitic N dopants, large pore volume, hierarchical structures, and micro structural defects.

This study focuses in particular on the semiconductor properties and interfacial design of transparent Ta3N5 photoanodes fabricated on insulating quartz substrates (Ta3N5/SiO2), typically the geometric area of 1 x 1 cm(2) in contact with indium on its edge. This material utilizes the self-conductivity of Ta3N5 to make the PEC system operational, and the electrode would strongly reflect the intrinsic nature of Ta3N5 without a back contact that is commonly introduced. First, PEC measurements using acetonitrile (ACN)/H2O mixed solution were made to elucidate the intrinsic photoresponse in the presence of tris(2,2'-bipyridine)ruthenium(II) bis(hexafluorophosphate) (Ru-(bpy)(3)(PF6)(2)) without water contact which avoids a multielectron-transfer oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and photoinduced self-oxidation. The potential difference between the onset potential of Ru2+ PEC oxidation by Ta3N5/SiO2 and the redox potential of Ru2+/3+ in the nonaqueous environment was about 0.7 V. While a stable photoanodic response was observed for Ta3N5/SiO2 in the nonaqueous phase, the addition of a small quantity of water into this nonaqueous system led to the immediate deactivation of Ta3N5/SiO2 photoanode under illumination by self-photooxidation to form TaOx at the solid/water interface. In aqueous phase, flatband potentials estimated from Mott-Schottky analysis varied with solution pH (constant potential against reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)). Photoelectrode modification by a transparent NiFeOx layer was attempted. The complete coverage of the Ta3N5 surface with transparent NiFeOx electrocatalysts, achieved by an optimized spin-coating protocol with controlled Ni-Fe precursors, allowed for the successful protection of Ta3N5 and demonstrated an extremely stable photocurrent for hours without any additional protective layers. The stability of the resultant NiFeOx/Ta3N5/SiO2 was limited not by Ta3N5 but mainly by a NiFeOx electrocatalyst due to Fe dissolution with time.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000641156600033	33797878

The authors achieve an economical, ecofriendly, and most efficient MoS2-based hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst of N-doped MoS2 nanosheets, exhibiting an onset overpotential of 35 mV, an overpotential of 121 mV at 100 mA cm-2 and a Tafel slope of 41 mV dec(-1). The dual-functions of N dopants are (1) activating the HER catalytic activity of MoS2 S-edge and (2) enhancing the conductivity of MoS2 basal plane to promote rapid charge transfer. Comprehensive electrochemical measurements prove that both the amount of active HER sites and the conductivity of N-doped MoS2 increase as a result of doping N. Systematic first-principles calculations identify the active HER sites in N-doped MoS2 edges and also illustrate the conducting charges spreading over N-doped basal plane induced by strong Mo 3d-S 2p-N 2p hybridizations at Fermi level. The experimental and theoretical research on the efficient HER catalysis of N-doped MoS2 nanosheets possesses great potential for future sustainable hydrogen production via water electrolysis and will stimulate further development on nonmetal-doped MoS2 systems to bring about novel high-performance HER catalysts.									223	14	0	0	7	0	224			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000398362700016

Design and fabrication of efficient non-metallic electrocatalytic gas diffusion cathode (GDC) with strong durability is highly desirable. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is a promising electrocatalytic material for 2-electron O(2)reduction but with unsatisfying electrocatalytic activity and stability. Hetero-atom doping of CNTs has been proved to promote its electrocatalytic selectivity for H2O2 generation, but the electrocatalytic performance of CNTs co-doped with two hetero-atoms and its synergy mechanisms need further investigation. Herein, O or F mono-doped and O/F co-doped CNTs with different O/F ratios were developed through one-step acidification and then used as the electrocatalysts on the graphite felt (GF) GDC for H2O2 generation. The electrocatalytic activity was greatly improved by the synergetic effects of O/F-containing functional groups on the surface of CNTs. The GF/CNTs-1:1 cathode with the highest contents of COOH and CFX (X & GE; 2) was found to be most efficient in H(2)O(2 & nbsp;)electrogeneration at a wide pH range of 1-9. Further, with coating of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) film, the GF/ CNTs-1:1/PTFE-30 GDC exhibited extremely high activity and superior stability in 15 cycles without aeration, giving the maximum H2O2 yield of 263.2 mg & BULL;L(- 1)in 1 h with little decline rate. The present study provides op-portunities for developing highly efficient, cost effective, and durable metal-free electrocatalysts for H2O2 evolution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0959-6526	1879-1786		WOS:000770357900005

Based on our results, we have located the obstacles toward unity efficiency and revealed that the degradation strongly depends on the Ni concentration and the depth of charge. The threshold capacities for degradation of LiNi1-2xCoxMnxO2 are 130-140 mA.hg(-1) (y < 0.5) for 1/4 <= x = 1/3 (33.33-50% of Ni), and 200 -210 mA.hg(-1) (y < 0.25) for 0 <= x = 1/4 (50-100% of Ni), respectively. For 1/4 <= x = 1/3, our results show that the origin of the degradation is the oxidation of O2-, which is the result of the pining of O-p and Ni-d bands at the valence band edge. For 0 <= x = 1/4, lattice distortion and Li-Ni exchange are the mechanisms responsible for the degradation of the cathode material, leading to severe structural instabilities in the Ni-rich region (x = 0.1). Our findings will help to rationally design NCM cathode materials with high-energy density, also providing possible solution mechanisms to the degradation factors, such as doping, coating or novel nanostructures, like core-shell or concentration gradient cathodes.

J	Zhang, Wenyong; Chen, Shancheng; Han, Feng; Wu, Dun								An experimental study on the evolution of aggregate structure in coals of different ranks by in situ X-ray diffractometry								ANALYTICAL METHODS				7	20			8720	8726		10.1039/c5ay01922b				2015	2015	Coal samples of different ranks were selected based on geological ages and regions to investigate their thermal evolution in aggregate structure using in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy. Samples were heated at a rate of 10 degrees C min(-1) in the range of 25-900 degrees C. The XRD profiles of the coal samples displayed an evident decrease in intensity of peak at 20 degrees (lambda-band), which suggests the decomposition of oxygen-containing functional groups in the coal matrix at higher temperatures. In contrast, the peak at 26 degrees (so-called G-band) became sharper and shifted to higher angles, which suggests a more ordered crystallite structure of coal with increasing heating temperature. Note that the integrally diffracted intensity of these two bands weakened intensely above 400 degrees C, which suggests that the coal aggregate structure may be loosened due to the depolymerization of the carbonaceous matrix in coal. The primary phase of weight loss for the low-rank coals took place in the range of 300-500 degrees C, but the high-rank coals had an obvious second pyrolysis reaction above 500 degrees C. Moreover, this study shows that the heating temperature effect plays a key role in the evolution of the interlayer spacing of the crystalline structure (d(002)) and height of the aromatic layers (L-c), whereas the diameter of the aromatic layers (L-a) is more dependent on coal ranks rather than heating temperature.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			1759-9660	1759-9679		WOS:000362662600031

Abundance ratios and delayed mixing in the solar neighbourhood								MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY				296	1			119	149						MAY 1 1998	1998	We analyse two recent computations of Type II supernova nucleosynthesis by Woosley & Weaver (hereafter WW95) and Thielemann, Nomoto & Hashimoto (hereafter TNH96), focusing on the ability to reproduce the observed [Mg/Fe] ratios in various galaxy types. We show that the yields of oxygen and total metallicity are in good agreement. However, TNH96 models produce more magnesium in the intermediate and less iron in the upper mass range of Type II supernovae than WW95 models. To investigate the significance of these discrepancies for chemical evolution, we calculate simple stellar population yields for both sets of models and different initial mass function slopes. We conclude that the Mg yields of WW95 do not suffice to explain the [Mg/Fe] overabundance either in giant elliptical galaxies and bulges or in metal-poor stars in the solar neighbourhood and the Galactic halo. Calculating the chemical evolution in the solar neighbourhood according to the standard infall model, we find that, using WW95 and TNH96 nucleosynthesis, the solar magnesium abundance is underestimated by 29 and 7 per cent, respectively.We include the relaxation of the instantaneous mixing approximation in chemical evolution models by splitting the gas component into two different phases. In additional simulations of the chemical evolution in the solar neighbourhood, we discuss various time-scales for the mixing of the stellar ejecta with the interstellar medium. We find that a delay of the order of 10(8) yr leads to a better fit of the observational data in the [Mg/Fe]-[Fe/H] diagram without destroying the agreement with solar element abundances and the age-metallicity relation.									89	2	0	0	0	0	89			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000073798400018

Herein, PtxCoy nanocrystals underwent a shape evolution from a core-shell structure to multicubes under an identical synthetic condition via using the previous structure serving as a seed precursor to induce the formation of the latter. PtxCoy@Co cubes can be viewed as a PtxCoy octapod core coated by a Co atom shell that exhibits complete selectivity towards the C=C bond of unsaturated aldehydes. The Co shell of PtxCoy@Co was further substituted by introducing Pt atoms, followed by successive deposition of Pt on PtxCoy, and interdiffusion between Pt and Co, leading to formation of multicubes. Such multicubes gave rise to superior catalytic activity with higher selectivity for the C=O bond of unsaturated aldehydes compared to pure Pt nanocubes and a commercial Pt/C catalyst.									7	1	0	0	0	0	8			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000372851500027	26726876

XAFS analysis reveals that the oxygen coordination number in the first shell with short W-o bond distance increases as the calcination temperature is increased, suggesting the transform of W-species on surface. Slight degradation of Keggin structure of H4SiW12O40 supported on Al2O3 is observed upon calcination at 350 and 450 degrees C, though [SiW12O40](4-) anions with Keggin structure are still the dominating species. The total decomposition of Keggin unit occurs after calcination at 550 and 650 degrees C. Isolated WO6 species and small amount of WO3 micro-crystallites are formed as a result of the decomposition. The glycerol conversion increases with acid center concentration under the specified reaction condition. As well, selectivity to acrolein increases with Bronsted/Lewis acid ratio, suggesting the crucial role of Bronsted acid sites for acrolein formation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The surface and cross-section morphologies of the anode were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The anodic polarization behavior of the electrode in trivalent chromium plating bath was studied by linear sweep voltammetry. The cathodic current efficiencies under different current densities in chromium plating for the anodes prepared at different heat treatment temperatures were examined. The results showed that the anode prepared is well-structured and free of cracks. In the application of trivalent chromium plating, the IrO2/TNTs/Ti anode exhibits a more positive oxidation potential as compared with the conventional graphite anode, facilitating the oxygen evolution reaction and having a cathodic current efficiency up to 18%.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1004-227X			INSPEC:17644404

To this aim we developed an all-metallic positive electrode by electrodeposition of a gold dendritic film on a nickel foam (Au@Ni). These carbon-free electro-catalytic electrodes have been used to investigate the degradation chemistry of the electrolytes in Li-O-2 cells by eliminating the parallel parasitic reactions due to the commonly used carbon electro-catalysts. In particular the composition and morphological evolutions of the Au@Ni electrodes after discharge and cycling have been characterized ex situ by Raman Spectroscopy, X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy. We also couple this experimental study with thermodynamic predictions about the onset degradation of the DME molecule based on density functional theory calculations. In summary in both DME/LiTfO and TEGDME/LiTfO electrolytes, the degradation involves the oxidation of the ether solvent to a mixture of carbonates and carboxylates/formate/oxalate. DME is apparently more strongly degraded compared to TEGDME whereas the LiTfO anion is highly stable. Calculations suggest the key role played by the singlet oxygen molecule as initiator of the degradation path. (C) The Author(s) 2018.

Herein, we demonstrated a two-step calcining strategy to synthesize a new excellent HER catalyst consisting of MoP nanoparticles loaded on a nitrogen-doped carbon hybrid framework substrate (MoP@NCF), for which acetone was used as the carbon source of the MoP-based electrocatalysts for the first time. The MoP@NCF exhibits an outstanding electrocatalytic performance for the HER with a low overpotential (only 121.8 mV in acid and 129.5 mV in alkaline electrolytes, respectively) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is ascribed to the unique porous nanostructure with an enormous special surface area of 247.43 m(2) g(-1), and the ultrasmall size and homogeneous distribution of the MoP nanoparticles. Our work provides a rational method to reinforce the HER activity of molybdenum phosphide through structure design, and the therein useful strategy has the possibility of being applied to a range of other metal-based electrocatalyst materials.									18	0	0	0	3	0	18			2052-1553			WOS:000472193200017

The greatest challenge for electrochemical ozone production is the lack of catalysts with high selectivity for ozone evolution. Nickel- and antimony-doped tin oxide electrodes synthesized from sol-gels and nanoparticles have been reported to reach ozone current efficiencies up to 50% for electrochemical ozone production. In this study, we present a novel electrodeposition synthesis method that results in current efficiencies up to 63%. The optimal temperature of the post-deposition oxidation treatment is determined by the tradeoff between catalyst stability and crystallinity. Analysis via microscopy and X-ray diffraction suggests that electrodeposited films provide sufficient Ni concentration, surface area, and morphology to support a solution-mediated ozone production reaction.

Earth-abundant transition metals such as Fe, Co and Ni have been investigated as promising alternatives in alkaline electrolytes. However, these non-precious- metal catalysts are not stable in acids, excluding their application in the acidic solid polymer electrolyte (SPE). Herein, we report a strategy to encapsulate 3d transition metals Fe, Co and the FeCo alloy into nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and investigated their HER activity in acidic electrolytes. The optimized catalysts exhibited long-term durability and high activity with only an similar to 70 mV onset overpotential vs. RHE which is quite close to that of the commercial 40% Pt/C catalyst, demonstrating the potential for the replacement of Pt-based catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that the introduction of metal and nitrogen dopants can synergistically optimize the electronic structure of the CNTs and the adsorption free energy of H atoms on CNTs, and therefore promote the HER with a Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism.									722	30	0	0	28	0	729			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000336831700013

However, the specific activity and durability of noble metal catalysts is the main hindrance to the hydrogen evolution reaction. Based on the continuous pore regulation of hollow porous carbon spheres (N-HPCSs) by hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide, the 6.21 wt% Pt/N-HPCSs exhibited good dispersibility, according to a low overpotential of 45 mV (10 mA cm(-2)/1 M KOH). Its mass activity was 4 times that of the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C at -0.07 V (vs. RHE) potential. We analyse that the excellent activity is due to the interaction between Pt nanoparticles and N-HPCSs so that the electron density around the Pt atoms increases, which is beneficial for H2O to obtain electrons and transform into H-ad. Meanwhile the sea urchin-like structure of N-HPCSs facilitates the desorption of H-2. Furthermore, the overpotential showed no obvious decrease in the long-term durability test, which should be attributed to the confinement of Pt nanoparticles by the well-defined pores in N-HPCSs to avoid the aggregation of Pt nanoparticles during long-term testing.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000712540800001	34714896

First, SiW11Co-CNP was synthesized using a polyoxometalate-assisted hydrothermal process and drop-cast on the surface of a GC electrode (SiW11Co-CNP/GC). Next, the anodic dissolution-cathodic deposition technique was employed for the deposition of Pt-SiW11Co on the SiW11Co-CNP/GC electrode. The as-prepared Pt-SiW11Co/SiW11Co-CNP/GC electrode was evaluated for its electrocatalytic activity towards the HER using linear sweep voltammetry, cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The electrode has demonstrated favorable electrocatalytic activity towards the HER with a low onset potential of 80 +/- 7 mV, an overpotential of 150 +/- 4 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) current density, and a small Tafel slope of 61 +/- 1 mV dec(-1), as well as a long-term stability.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000618190800032

These species are compared to the bare support as well as to bulk platinum with respect to the catalytic activity. Photoelectron spectroscopy showed Pt4f core-level shifts to higher binding energies with decreasing cluster size. In addition, the various species contribute significant density of states into the valence band gap of TiO2, thereby with larger particle size, the resulting band gap narrows. For nanoparticles, metal-like behaviour was already observed. Electrochemical measurements in 0.1 M H2SO4 showed the highest overall catalytic activity for bulk platinum and large Pt nanoparticles. A different assertion is obtained when the activities are related to the mass of the catalyst used, indicating that clusters with a size of about ten atoms seem to be most active. In comparison with the results from photoelectron spectroscopy regarding the electronic structure, no clear correlation to the catalytic activity was found. In terms of degradation induced due to the electrochemical treatment, the cluster samples showed no sintering effects, but instead, some detachment took place.									7	0	0	0	0	0	6			0942-9352			WOS:000534258100005

In this study, facile one-step fabrication strategy was adopted in synthesizing Co@N-G materials for the first time. Simultaneous fabrication of Co@N-G was achieved by simplistic one-pot synthesis strategy through the catalytic mixture of cobalt (II) nitrate hexahydrate, urea, fumaric acid, and sodium carbonate which were pyrolytically treated at appreciable temperature ranges. The as-fabricated nanoparticles display outstanding morphological/electrocatalytic properties benefitting from the synergistic and formative relationship between Co atom and defective N-doped graphene, mass electron transfer support, abundant active sites and unique morphology exhibited by the as-prepared nanoparticles. A medium overpotential of 0.26 V with a time-dependent stability of 40 hours were enough to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in basic electrolyte. However, the simplistic fabrication strategy is fascinating to scale up easy processes in designing HER electrocatalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000638435400001

However, the strategies previous adopted are mainly chemical delithiation, which has violent effect on the crystal structure and deteriorates the cycle performance. Here, we report a facile and effective microwave-assisted treatment method to preactivate Li-rich layered oxides without structural distortion. The microwave-treated sample shows a high discharge capacity of about 281 mAh g(-1) with a Coulombic efficiency of 87% at 0.1 C and exhibits unnormal continuous increase of discharge capacity from 203 mAh g(-1) to 218 mAh g(-1) during 110 cycles at 1 C as well as presents distinctly improved cycling stability. EIS, GITT and XRD studies reveal that the kinetics of electrochemical reaction on electrode surface and Li ionic migration coefficient in crystal structure become progressively enhanced due to the gradual expansion of, interplanar spacing upon cycling. Those results demonstrate that preactivation by microwave-assisted treatment contributes to optimize the structure evolution of Li-rich material for rate performance in cyclic process, which also provides new thinking in modifying Li-rich layered cathode materials.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			2574-0962			WOS:000458706400074

Among them, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is considered as an effective alternative to Pt-based materials due to its excellent structure properties. Here, by using metal-organic framework (MOF) as the precursor, sodium molybdate as molybdenum sources and thiourea as sulfur sources, a hollow structure of Co-MoS2 electrocatalyst was prepared on highly conductive carbon nanowire arrays/carbon cloth (CA/CC) by hydrothermal reaction. The combination of carbon nanowire arrays and carbon cloth ensures the high conductivity, while the hollow Co-MoS2 structure promotes the penetration of electrolytes and the release of hydrogen bubbles. The overpotential is only 296 mV when the current density was similar to 1500 mA/cm(2), which shows excellent catalytic hydrogen evolution activity of the material. In addition, the three-dimensional hollow structure avoids the use of adhesives between the active material and the self-supporting material, which can improve the stability of the material and provides a new idea to design commercial electrocatalysts.

The obtained nanocomposites have a thin overlayer which is made of nanoparticles with a diameter of similar to 3 nm. The products were characterized by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The obtained SnO2/CNTs have an excellent electrocatalytic oxidation performance for the X-3B, a kind of dye. The parameters affecting the electrocatalytic activity were investigated in details. The excellent catalytic property of the SnO2/CNT electrodes can be explained as follows: (1) high specific surface area gives more active sites for X-3B oxidation; (2) the formation of thin, uniform, and uninterrupted coverage of SnO2 nanoparticles on CNTs raises the potential of oxygen evolution and the current efficiency; and (3) the CNTs increase the conductivity of the electrodes, which results in the increase of the current efficiency.

Herein, ultra-low amount Pt-doped Co2P/Ni2P on nickel foam (Pt/Co2P/Ni2P/NF) was facilely synthesized via an in situ controlled growth and used as an efficient electrocatalyst for electrolytic water splitting into hydrogen. Pt/Co2P/Ni2P/NF was achieved by a two-step procedure that was conducted by the hydrothermal approach to obtain the precursor, followed by a subsequent in situ phosphorization procedure. Due to the NF substrate being supermacroporous, more active sites of Pt/Co2P/Ni2P/NF could be exposed, improving electron transport and providing open-channels for the rapid release of H-2. Pt/Co2P/Ni2P/NF exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic performance towards HER with an overpotential of 75 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline electrolyte and a small Tafel slope of 64 mV dec(-1). This work provided a facile and reliable synthetic approach to improve transition metal phosphides (TMPs) for electrocatalytic HER performance in alkaline electrolytes.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2398-4902			WOS:000620730300014

However, it exists in a variety of stable compositions and obtaining a pure phase is a challenge. This study demonstrates a potentially scalable, solvent free and phase selective synthesis of uncapped alpha-NiS, beta-NiS and alpha-beta-NiS composites using nickel alkyl (ethyl, octyl) xanthate precursors. Phase transformation and morphology were observed by powder-X-ray diffraction (p-XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The comparative efficiency of the synthesized samples was investigated for energy storage and generation applications, in which superior performance was observed for the NiS synthesized from the short chain xanthate complex. A high specific capacitance of 1,940 F/g, 2,150 F/g and 2,250 F/g was observed at 2 mV/s for bare alpha-NiS, beta-NiS and alpha-beta-NiS composite respectively. At high current density of 1A/g, alpha-NiS showed the highest capacitance of 1,287 F/g, with 100% of Coulombic efficiency and 79% of capacitance retention. In the case of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), beta-NiS showed an overpotential of 139 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2), with a Tafel slope of only 32 mV/dec, showing a fast and efficient process. It was observed that the increase in carbon chain of the synthesized self-capped nickel sulfide nanoparticles decreased the overall efficiency, both for energy storage and energy generation applications.									34	0	0	0	0	0	34			2045-2322			WOS:000563271100008	32094383

One of the key astrobiological questions of Titan's environment is the fate of the organic aerosols produced in the atmosphere, after they are deposited on the surface. In the present study, we report the geological structures these aerosols may encounter in the light of the last observations of the Cassini-Huygens mission. We chose to quantify the production of some astrobiologically interesting molecules in putative ammonia-water bodies likely to be present at the surface or subsurface of Titan, as crater melt pools or cryolavas. We synthesized laboratory analogs of Titan's aerosols from a continuous flow of a N-2:CH4 (98:2) gas mixture irradiated by a cold plasma discharge. Aerosol analogs were recovered, partitioned in several 10.0 mg samples and placed in pure water and in 25 wt% ammonia solutions during ten weeks at 253 and 279 K, respectively. A derivatization reaction was performed on the residues obtained after evaporation of the hydrolysis solution using MTBSTFA in DMF as a reagent. Then some resulting products were identified and quantified using GC-MS analysis. Tholins were found to be very reactive toward an oxygen source. Urea was identified as the main product of Titan's tholins hydrolysis in ammonia-water solutions, with a production yield in mass, ranging from 6% to 12% at 279 K after 10 weeks. Several amino acids-alanine, glycine and aspartic acid-and perhaps the uracil nucleobase were also produced with yields from 0.001% to 0.4%. The determination of production yields carried out by the present study is a major step into the characterization of potential aerosols evolution on Titan. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TNA were obtained by anodization of Ti films deposited by magnetron sputtering on transparent conducting oxide-coated glass. This study presents the impact of introducing a compact TiO2 underlayer on the morphological, optical and electrochemical properties of the TNA photoanodes.The TNA morphology was found to be more regular with a TiO2 underlayer and the macroscopic homogeneity of the samples was also increased. This is ascribed to a strong reduction, in the presence of the compact TiO2 underlayer, of a side reaction leading to oxygen evolution and destructuring the TNA film during anodization.As a consequence, the optical and transport properties (characterized by UV-vis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, respectively) were improved, together with an increased photovoltaic efficiency.

Here, 2D mesoporous graphitic-C3N4 nanolayers are rationally assembled on 2D mesoporous graphene sheets (g-CN@G MMs) by in situ selective growth. Benefiting from an abundance of exposed edges and rich defects, fast electron transport, and a multipathway of charge and mass transport from a continuous interconnected mesh network, the mesh-on-mesh g-CN@G MMs hybrid exhibits higher catalytic hydrogen evolution activity and stronger durability than most of the reported nonmetal catalysts and some metal-based catalysts.									132	10	0	0	5	0	134			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000399019000011

The catalysts have strong ability in absorbing visible light (lambda > 420 nm), showing significantly superior activity than pCN in water splitting for H2 production. The average H-2 evolution rates achieved by using N3/pCN and N719/pCN as catalysts and using Pt as a co-catalyst reached 1490.7 and 2500.1 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), respectively, much higher than the rate (592.2 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)) achieved by using the pCN-Pt combination. A feasible mechanism of charge transfer and hydrogen generation was proposed.

Here, the production and evolution of free radicals were systematically investigated during composting. Results indicated that multiple reactive oxygen species and environmentally persistent free radicals (G-factor 2.003-2.004) were generated with dynamic changes during composting. The center dot OH yield fluctuated significantly with a maximum content of 365.7-1,262.3 mu mol/kg at the thermophilic phase of composting, which was closely correlated with the changes of Fe (II) (Pearson's r = 0.928-0.932) and the electron-donating capacity of humus (Pearson's r = 0.958-0.896) during composting. Further investigation suggested that microorganisms driven iron/humus redox conversion could contribute to the production and dynamic changes of free radical during composting. These findings highlight the abiotic processes involving free radicals, and provide a new perspective for humification and contaminants removal during composting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0960-8524	1873-2976		WOS:000848233900008	35724905

In particular, the strategy of atomic doping has garnered some success in tuning the electronic properties and harnessing the vast potential that TMDs can offer in the catalysis of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Moreover, with computational studies reporting the promising effects of transition-metal doping, such a strategy has been adopted with much enthusiasm. Herein, we consider one of the most prevalent TMDs, that is, MoS2, and the possible presence of impurities arising from its preparation method and starting materials that may act as dopants to affect its electronic and catalytic properties. An ultrapure MoS2 material was synthesized and compared with a relatively impure MoS2 sample obtained commercially. Ultrapure MoS2 was found to outperform its impurities-doped counterpart in HER catalysis. These findings not only provide valuable insight into the influence of parts-per-million concentrations of impurities on the catalytic activity of TMD materials but also highlight the importance of the intentional and proper design of atomic doping to realize its true effects. At the same time, the need for a more in-depth understanding and evaluation of the benefits of the atomic-doping strategy in the experimental setting as a means to harness the potential of TMDs as catalysts for hydrogen evolution is also revealed.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000398859500004

SO2 is found to adsorb on Ru(0001) at 100 K molecularly in two variants as well as dissociatively and to react to SO3, SO4, SO, and S with increasing coverage. After the monolayer has been saturated, SO2 adsorbs molecularly in multilayers. When heating adsorbed SO2 from 100 K, SO, SO2, and SO4 decompose in a wide temperature range up to 305 K. In contrast SO3 is found to be stable bound to Ru(0001) up to 300 K and to disappear from the surface to below 325 K. At 550 K the surface remains with a saturated atomic sulfur and oxygen layer and some sulfur species in a second layer. Our quantitative analysis of the sulfur amount bound to the surface supports a simple desorption process only for SO4. All other species mainly or partly decompose on the surface.

Many physical techniques have provided important insights into the OEC structure and function, including X-ray diffraction (XRD) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy as well as mass spectrometry (MS), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy applied in conjunction with mutagenesis studies. However, experimental studies have yet to yield consensus as to the exact configuration of the catalytic metal cluster and its ligation scheme. Computational modeling studies, including density functional (DFT) theory combined with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) hybrid methods for explicitly including the influence of the surrounding protein, have proposed chemically satisfactory models of the fully ligated OEC within PSII that are maximally consistent with experimental results. The inorganic core of these models is similar to the crystallographic model upon which they were based, but comprises important modifications due to structural refinement, hydration, and proteinaceous ligation which improve agreement with a wide range of experimental data. The computational models are useful for rationalizing spectroscopic and crystallographic results and for building a complete structure-based mechanism of water-splitting in PSII as described by the intermediate oxidation states of the OEC. This review summarizes these recent advances in QM/MM modeling of PSII within the context of recent experimental studies.									51	0	0	0	21	0	51			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000257962600007	18483777

The well-designed composite material was prepared by a simple solvothermal method and achieved a dramatically enhanced H-2-evolution performance when compared with other bulk counterparts. Under optimal conditions, the H-2-evolution efficiency can reach up to 17.60 mu mol mg(-1) h(-1) after 10 h of LED visible light irradiation, which is comparable to that of noble Pt nanoparticles (18.60 mu mol mg(-1) h(-1)). It is proposed that the unusual catalytic rate arises from the special nanostructure of Co0.85Se and a positive synergetic effect between Co0.85Se and graphene. The results show that the ultrathin Co0.85Se which possesses a half-metallic character is a promising noble-metal-free cocatalyst for practical photocatalytic hydrogen production application.									43	2	0	0	1	0	43			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000360490600045

In this work, we have synthesized ultrasmall rhodium-rhodium phosphide hetero-nanoparticles (3.4 nm, Rh-Rh2P@C) by partial phosphorization of Rh@C at 300 degrees C together with Na2HPO2. The constructed Rh-Rh2P@C requires only 24 mV and 37 mV overpotentials to reach 10 mA m(-2)in 0.5 M H(2)SO(4)and 1 M KOH electrolytes, which are lower than those of Rh@C and Rh2P@C due to the formation of heterointerfaces inducing modulation of local electronic structures and more active sites; as a result, a more moderate hydrogen adsorption-desorption strength is achieved for Rh-Rh2P@C as proved by theoretical calculation. Moreover, the calculated mass activity of Rh-Rh2P@C is 4 orders of magnitude higher than that of the benchmark Pt/C electrocatalyst. Besides, exceptional stability is recorded for Rh-Rh2P@C in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes due to the strong electronic interaction between Rh and Rh2P. This study offers a new strategy to manufacture efficient electrocatalysts for various applications.									26	2	0	0	2	0	26			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000544719500014

Ag3PO4 is an excellent visible-light-driven photocatalyst, showing an extraordinary photoactivity for oxygen evolution in water splitting and degradation of pollutant in aqueous solution. However, due to the uncontrollable photocorrosion phenomenon, the Ag3PO4-based photocatalysis is still at laboratory scale. To remove the obstacles for practical application and to further improve its photocatalytic performance, this review summarized the achievements that have been made in this field. We began with an effort to introduce the reasons for Ag3PO4 exhibiting excellent photocatalytic performance. Subsequently, the different synthesis methods of Ag3PO4 were discussed. Finally, we outlined the barriers that hindered the practical application of Ag3PO4 and proposed the ways to remove these barriers. This review also underlined the crucial problems that should be addressed prior to practical applications.									60	3	0	0	14	0	62			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000459903100033

The nanobroom morphology and atomic structure are characterized using the scanning, transmission, and scanning transmission electron microscopies. Both Si NW backbones and ZnO NW stalls are defect-free, single-crystalline, and their surfaces are smooth. The optical absorption and photocurrents from nanobroom array electrodes with different Si and ZnO NW dimensions are studied. The longer Si NW backbones and smaller ZnO NW stalls lead to better light absorption and larger photoanodic current. The ZnO/Si nanobrooms show much higher photoanodic current than the bare Si NWs due to the effective Si/ZnO junction and increased surface area. The nanobroom electrode stability is also investigated and using a thin TiO2 coating layer protecting the NWs against dissolution, long-term stability is obtained without any change in shape and morphology of nanobrooms. Finally, the effect of catalyst to improve the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the electrode surface is studied resulting in large enhancement in photoanodic current and significant reduction in anodic turn-on potential. This study reveals the promise of the use of simply fabricated and low-cost 3D heterostructured NW photoelectrodes for clean solar energy harvesting and conversion.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1862-6300	1862-6319		WOS:000328452500005

For efficient catalysis, single-atom catalysts must expose abundant single atomic metal active centers. Here, we report the rational design and synthesis of a Cu single-atom catalyst with high Cu content of over 20.9 wt%, made of single atomic Cu anchored into an ultrathin nitrogenated two-dimensional carbon matrix (Cu-N-C). The high Cu content was achieved by the introduction of additional N species, which can securely trap and protect the Cu atoms. During oxygen reduction, the single atomic Cu exhibited over 54 times higher mass activity than metallic Cu nanoparticles at a potential of 0.85 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Furthermore, the Cu-N-C exhibited 3.2 times higher kinetic current at 0.85 V (vs. RHE), and a much lower Tafel slope (37 mV dec(-1)), as well as better methanol/carbon monoxide tolerance and long-term stability than commercial Pt/C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the Cu active sites exhibit improved O-O bond stretching and favorable adsorption energies of O-2 and OOH for four-electron oxygen reduction.									314	21	0	0	18	0	316			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000442262900034

Notably, carbon-based catalysts, such as transition metal and heteroatomic-doped carbon materials, are promising candidates to replace precious metal catalysts. The functionalization of the carbon matrix with nitrogen and cobalt is an effective way to develop the electrocatalytic properties of carbon-based catalysts. However, simple and cheaper synthesis methods for catalysts have not been fully investigated. Herein, we report on a cobalt oxide nanoparticle-decorated nitrogen (N)-doped carbon catalyst synthesized by a simple two-step method using spent coffee grounds (SCG). In the first step, SCG-derived carbon (SCG-KU) was obtained by pyrolysis under high temperatures with urea and potassium hydroxide. Second, SCG-KU was functionalized with urea and cobalt chloride. We determined that Co@SCG-KU had a high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area (1413.2 m(2) g(-1)); cobalt nanoparticles were uniformly distributed in hierarchically porous carbon and surrounded by graphitic carbon. Electrochemical performance results confirmed that the Co@SCG-KU possessed a high electrocatalytic effect (0.28 V at 10 mA cm(-2)) and better HER stability (at 5.0 mA cm(-2) for 8 h). Our results demonstrate a simple, eco-friendly, and low-cost method to prepare a more efficient carbon-based electrocatalyst from SCG in hydrogen evolution applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000824971900001

In addition, 2D mixed phase leaf-Ti1-xCuxO2 sheets (1CuLTiO(2)) were prepared by incorporating Cu ions (1wt%) into the LTiO2 lattice using a deposition-precipitation method followed by a calcination process. Structural microscopic and spectroscopic analyses demonstrated the generation of anatase and rutile surface-phase junctions as well as the combination of Cu ions with the disordered mesoporous leaf-TiO2 lattice. Hydrogen evolution reactions over 1CuLTiO(2) materials were performed using methanol as a sacrificial reagent under one sun illumination. LTiO2-750, synthesized by calcination at 750 degrees C, showed an absorption onset at 410nm, while LTiO2-550, synthesized by calcination at 550 degrees C, exhibited an onset at 387nm. Cu incorporation into the 1CuLTiO(2)-750 lattice, synthesized by calcination at 750 degrees C, led to the increase in the visible light absorption. Both the photocurrent and hydrogen yield via 1CuLTiO(2)-750 (apparent quantum yield, 4.9%) were higher than the respective values of 1CuLTiO(2)-550 (AQY=2.9%) synthesized by calcination at 550 degrees C, highlighting the importance of the surface-phase junction. The increased photocatalytic activity of 1CuLTiO(2)-750 was mainly assigned to the formation of surface-phase junctions, disordering mesoporosity, and 2D sheet morphology for fast charge carriers.									13	2	0	0	0	0	13			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000443935100027

However, the weak interactions between unsaturated metal atoms and supports can result in metal dissolution or aggregation in a harsh electrochemical environment. Here we report a facile yet effective method to stabilize atomic Ru-N sites on boron-doped carbon by mild photo-activation. Owing to the presence of adjacent B/N co-doped pairs, Ru atoms are firmly anchored on Ru-N-B-C centers leading to an enhanced metal-support interaction, with a Gibbs free energy close to zero for adsorption of H*. The resulting highly stabilized atomic Ru has excellent catalytic activity with efficient metal utilization towards the hydrogen evolution reaction in either alkaline or acidic electrolyte (with turnover frequencies of 2.82 and 1.02 H(2)per s, respectively), along with good rate capability and anti-reverse-current ability in long-term operation. This work opens a new route to prepare highly robust single-atom catalysts, which have good prospects for practical application in high-performance and low-cost electrochemical energy conversion devices.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000561168500051

There were three obvious peaks (011), (112), (222) interface in D-MOFs core, which fully showed that ZIF-67/ZIF-8 crystal core was successfully synthesized. The morphology of composite material was core-shell structure with a rough surface, and Ti, Co, Zn, Al were uniformly distributed on the surface. TiO2@ZIF-67/ZIF-8 also had excellent electrochemical activity and the maximum power density of TiO2@ZIF-67/ZIF-8 microbial fuel cell (MFC) was 341.506 mW/m(2), which was 1.30 times of ZIF-67/ZIF-8-MFC (262.144 mW/m(2)) and 2.07 times of ZIF-67-MFC (164.836 mW/m(2)). And the continuous output voltage of TiO2@ZIF-67/ZIF-8-MFC was 413.43 mV, which could maintain stable voltage output for 8.3 days. D-MOFs as the core of composites ensured the integrity, stability and high activity of materials; Rough TiO2 as the surface of the material provided surface area and reaction center.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0960-8524	1873-2976		WOS:000781667800003	35176464

A well-ordered mesostructure of circa 7nm pores were obtained by a facile one-pot soft-templating strategy, employing a [Ir(OH)(6)](2-) precursor stabilized by a triblock copolymer PluronicF127 as a pore-directing template. A mesoporous IrO2 film calcined at 400 degrees C (approximate to 70nm thick) affords a high surface area of 512m(2)cm(-3) and 2times higher O-2 evolution during the electrocatalytic water oxidation relative to an untemplated IrO2 coating film.									33	1	0	0	1	0	33			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000350661600007	25656858

Mechanical alloying was carried out for 108ks by using a planetary ball mill under an argon atmosphere. After mechanical alloying, the powders were consolidated to the P/M materials by vacuum hot pressing and subsequent hot extrusion. Structural evolutions accompanying with the displacement reaction of oxygen were studied by XRD and TEM for the mechanical alloyed powders and extruded P/M materials. Mechanical properties were examined by hardness and compression tests for the extruded materials. In all the systems studied, solid state reactions started during mechanical alloying and further progressed during subsequent heat treatment. In Mg-MnO2 and Mg-Fe2O3 systems, decomposition of MnO2 and Fe2O3 occurred during mechanical alloying and formation of MgO was observed during subsequent heating. In Mg-Al-MnO2 and Mg-Al-Fe2O3 systems, the added oxides were decomposed and formation of MgO and intermetallic aluminide compounds occurred. In the as-extruded P/M materials, fine Mg matrix grains of 100-200 nm in size were observed, and extremely fine compounds of less than 20 nm were dispersed in the Mg matrix. At room temperature, 0.2% proof stress and specific proof strength of the as-extruded P/M material of Mg-Al-MnO2 system were 596MPa and 305MPa/(Mg/m(3)), respectively.					2nd International Conference on Platform Science and Technology for Advanced Magnesium Alloys2nd International Conference on Platform Science and Technology for Advanced Magnesium Alloys	JAN 26-30, 2003JAN 26-30, 2003	Minist Educ, Sci, Culture, Sports & Technol Japan; USAF Off Sci Res; Asian Off Aerosp Res & DevMinist Educ, Sci, Culture, Sports & Technol Japan; USAF Off Sci Res; Asian Off Aerosp Res & Dev	OSAKA, JAPANOSAKA, JAPAN	9	1	0	0	0	0	9			0255-5476		0-87849-914-8	WOS:000182606100128

Fe-CC can be partially transformed into an Fe metal-organic framework (MOF), [FeCl2(Htrz)], via low-temperature annealing. After sulfurization at 250, 300, and 400 degrees C, S-doped Fe2O3/N-doped carbon (denoted as NC)/Fe-MOF, FeS2/NC/Fe-MOF, and FeS2/NC were obtained, respectively. S-doped Fe2O3/NC/Fe-MOF shows the best oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activity in 1 M KOH solution, with overpotentials (eta) of 185, 232, and 258 mV required to reach current densities of 10, 30, and 50 mA cm(-2), respectively, outperforming commercial RuO2 and most transition-metal oxides reported to date; this high performance is associated with the Fe2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) anchored on the Fe-MOF/NC nanosheets. The Fe-MOF/NC matrix can act as a support to prevent the agglomeration of Fe2O3 NPs. In addition, S-doped Fe2O3/NC/Fe-MOF exhibits long-term OER activity at 20 mA cm(-2), which is related to the partial transformation of Fe2O3/Fe-MOF into FeOOH. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the rate-determining step of the OER process at the Fe sites of both Fe2O3 and FeS2 is the formation of Fe*-OH, and the Fe2O3 sites display a lower Gibbs free energy (Delta G(max)) of 1.674 eV and a smaller eta value of similar to 0.444 V. Bader charge, differential charge density mapping, and density of states (DOS) analysis all reveal more charge accumulation at the Fe sites of FeS2 than at the Fe sites of Fe2O3, which is due to the lower electronegativity of S than of O. As a result, the Fe sites of FeS2 show weaker affinity for -OH intermediates, giving rise to inferior OER performance compared with Fe2O3.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000718422600001	34778898

Its components, connected in series by plastic tubing, are the following: plastic oxygen hood, suction flask used both as a mixing and sampling chamber, Brooks mass flow controller, and wall suction. Gas aliquots withdrawn from the sampling flask are analyzed for CO2 concentration in the laboratory. The system was validated by measuring over a 60-min period the evolution of CO2 from the reaction of sodium carbonate with phosphoric acid. In 9 trials, the mean recovery of CO2 was 99.8%. In 14 studies in 11 preterm infants, we evaluated the reproducibility of duplicate measurements of CO2 production on consecutive days; in 9 of the studies, the coefficient of variation was <5 %, but in other 5 studies, it ranged from 7.7 to 35.8%. We believe that this device might have both research and clinical applicability.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0006-3126			WOS:A1995RG88300004	7662813	
J	Wang Kai; Zhang Wen-Hua; Liu Ling-Yun; Xu Fa-Qiang								Healing of oxygen defects on VO2 surface: F(4)TCNQ adsorption								ACTA PHYSICA SINICA				65	8					088101	10.7498/aps.65.088101				APR 20 2016	2016	Oxygen-defect vacancies that routinely exist in wet production of VO2 material or on the surface of VO2 single crystal after surface treatment have significant influence on the metal-insulator phase transition features mainly due to their enhanced effect of doping on V 3d electronic structure. The removal of the surface oxygen defects is highly desired for investigating the VO2 intrinsic electronic properties. In this work, we propose a charge transfer doping method by using strong electric affinity molecule tetrafluorotetracyanoquinodimethane (F(4)TCNQ) adsorption rather than the normal thermal annealing in oxygen atmosphere to heal the surface oxygen defects of VO2 crystalline film. The healing effect is probed by the electronic structure evolution at the F(4)TCNQ/VO2 interface. The VO2 crystalline film is grown by an oxygen plasma assisted molecular beam epitaxy method on an Al2O3 (0001) substrate. Surface oxygen defects on VO2 film are produced after a mild sputtering with an ionic energy of 1 keV and a thermal annealing in vacuum at 100 degrees C. The influence of F(4)TCNQ molecule adsorption on the electronic structure of the sputtered VO2 film is studied by using in-situ synchrotron-based photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). XPS and XAS results demonstrate convincingly that V3+ species of sputtered VO2 are oxidized into the V4+ and simultaneously negative molecular ions form at F(4)TCNQ/VO2 interface resulting from the electron transfer from VO2 to the F(4)TCNQ layer. The preferred adsorption on surface defects and the strong electron withdrawing function of F(4)TCNQ molecules may account for the effective elimination of the electron doping effect of oxygen defects on VO2 surface. This charge transfer effect at interface recovers the electronic properties of VO2. Compared with thermal annealing in oxygen environment, the healing of oxygen defects by the molecular adsorption can prevent the surface from over oxidating VO2 into V2O5, which opens a new route to surface defect healing.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1000-3290			WOS:000380363400042		
J	Sukanya, Ramaraj; Chen, Shen-Ming								Amorphous cobalt boride nanosheets anchored surface-functionalized carbon nanofiber: An bifunctional and efficient catalyst for electrochemical sensing and oxygen evolution reaction								JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE				580				318	331		10.1016/j.jcis.2020.07.037				NOV 15 2020	2020	Development of new metal boride with carbon composite is an emerging class of catalyst and it brings enormous curiosity in the material community because of their potential intriguing properties. Here, we describe a new type of amorphous cobalt boride (A-CoB) nanosheet anchored on the surface of functionalized carbon nanofiber (A-CoB/f-CNF) by a simple method. The emerged A-CoB/f-CNF composite was demonstrated to possess great bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for the electrochemical sensing of antibiotic drug nitrofurantoin (NFT) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The prepared A-CoB/f-CNF composite was characterized by various analytical and spectroscopic techniques such as XRD, FE-SEM, HR-TEM, Raman, and XPS analysis. The result from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy confirms that the A-CoB/f-CNF composite shows high electrical conductivity and the number of electron transferability for the NFT sensor and OER which is due to the presence of abundant active sites/large surface area in A-CoB, and synergistic effect between the A-CoB and f-CNF. As an electrochemical sensor, the A-CoB/fCNF modified electrode shows substantial sensitivity (3.13 mu A mu M-1 cm(-2)), wider linear response range (0.01- 527 mu M), and lower detection limit (0.003 mu M) as-compared to the previously reported noble and non-noble metal-based electrocatalyst for NFT sensor. As well, the A-CoB/f-CNF composite demonstrates superior OER activity with low overpotential and small Tafel slope value of 0.35 V and 173 mV/dec, respectively, which shows advanced kinetics than noble metal catalysts. Based on the results, we believed that the present work gives clear evidence for the preparation of transition metal boride anchored carbon material with an outstanding catalytic activity, and hence, it can be also extended to further electrochemical applications.

Rapid measurement of photocatalytic oxidation of poly(vinyl chloride) by in situ FIR spectrometry of evolved CO2								MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				22	8			908	914		10.1179/174328406X91159				AUG 2006	2006	The CO2 generated by UV irradiation of unplasticised PVC pigmented with TiO2 was monitored by in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry. CO2 was evolved immediately irradiation began (although no HCI was detected) and when irradiation ceased CO2 evolution fell significantly. A comparison of photogeneration of CO2 from unpigmented and pigmented PVC demonstrated that, although a heavily coated TiO2 (R5) did not increase the rate of CO2 formation, lightly coated TiO2 (R3) photocatalysed PVC oxidation to CO2. As expected for a photocatalytic process, the photogeneration of CO2 increased with increased TiO2 loading. The convenience of the FTIR method allowed the increased rate of oxidation with increasing partial pressure of oxygen, or increasing humidity, to be demonstrated. It was also shown that the rate of photocatalytic oxidation varied as the square root of UV intensity. This dependence would result if recombination of UV generated charge carriers controls the rate of photocatalysis.									21	0	0	0	2	0	21			0267-0836	1743-2847		WOS:000240433200007

These features distinguish ReS2 from other two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) used as catalysts in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and suggest that it may be a suitable alternative catalyst to the expensive Pt most commonly in this reaction. Similar to traditional TMDCs, the catalytic activity of ReS2 is mainly contributed by the edge sites, whereas the basal plane, which accounts for a large percentage of the surface area, has poor catalytic activity. Activation of the basal plane of ReS2 would be an ideal strategy by which to boost its catalytic performance. We used density functional theory calculations to show that the catalytic activity of the ReS2 basal plane can be efficiently activated by doping with transition metal (TM) atoms such as Mo, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Pt, Au and Ag. Our results indicate that doping with a TM not only significantly reduces the hydrogen adsorption free energy (.GH*) of ReS2 by tuning the adsorption behavior of the H atom on the ReS2 surface, but can also expose more active sites by introducing more unsaturated electrons. Pt-doped ReS2 showed the highest catalytic activity for the HER of all the TM-doped ReS2 systems investigated, with.GH* = 0, a low reaction barrier and an increased density of active sites on the basal plane. More importantly, ReS2 doped with the non-noble TMs Mo and Cr showed excellent HER catalytic activities comparable with those of Pt-doped ReS2. Our findings will help to guide the future design of new HER catalysts based on TMDCs.									34	2	0	0	0	0	34			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000470697800027	31111853	
J	Kozma, C; Fransson, C								Late spectral evolution of SN 1987A. II. Line emission								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				497	1			431	457		10.1086/305452				APR 10 1998	1998	Using the temperature and ionization calculated in our previous paper, we model the spectral evolution of SN 1987A. We find that the temperature evolution is directly reflected in the time evolution of the lines. In particular, the IR catastrophe is seen in the metal lines as a transition from thermal to nonthermal excitation, seen most clearly in the [O I] lambda lambda 6300, 6364 lines. The good agreement with observations clearly confirms the predicted optical to IR transition. Because the line emissivity is independent of temperature in the nonthermal phase, this phase has a strong potential for estimating the total mass of the most abundant elements. The hydrogen lines arise as a result of recombinations following ionizations in the Balmer continuum during the first similar to 500 days and later as a result of nonthermal ionizations.The distribution of the different zones, and therefore the gamma-ray deposition, is determined from the line profiles of the most important lines, where possible. We find that hydrogen extends into the core to less than or similar to 700 km s(-1). The hydrogen envelope has a density profile close to rho proportional to V-2 from 2000-5000 km s(-1). The total mass of hydrogen-rich gas is similar to 7.7 M., of which similar to 2.2 M. is mixed within 2000 km s(-1). The helium mass derived from the line fluxes is sensitive to assumptions about the degree of redistribution in the line. The mass of the helium-dominated zone is consistent with similar to 1.9 M., with a further similar to 3.9 M., of helium residing in the hydrogen component. Most of the oxygen-rich gas is confined to 400-2000 km s(-1), with a total mass of similar to 1.9 M.. Because of uncertainties in the modeling of the non-thermal excitation of the CO II lines, the uncertainty in the estimated oxygen mass is considerable. Masses of nitrogen, neon, magnesium, iron, and nickel are also estimated.The dominant contribution to the line luminosity often originates in a different zone from that in which most of the newly synthesized material resides. This applies to, e.g., carbon, calcium, and iron. The [C I] lines, arising mainly in the helium zone, indicate a substantially lower abundance of carbon mixed with helium than given by stellar evolution models, and a more extended zone with CNO-processed gas is also indicated. The [Fe II] lines have in most phases a strong contribution from primordial iron, and at t greater than or similar to 600-800 days this component dominates the [Fe II] lines. The wings of the [Fe II] lines may therefore come from primordial iron rather than synthesized iron mixed to high velocity. Lines from ions with low ionization potentials indicate that the UV field below at least 1600 Angstrom is severely quenched by dust absorption and resonance scattering.									95	0	1	0	0	0	96			0004-637X			WOS:000073049600034

In plants, ROS act like a double-edged sword; they play multiple beneficial roles at low concentrations, whereas at high concentrations ROS and related redox-active compounds cause cellular damage through oxidative stress. To examine the dual role of ROS as harmful oxidants and/or crucial cellular signals, this review elaborates that (i) how plants sense and respond to ROS in various subcellular organelles and (ii) the dynamics of subsequent ROS-induced signaling processes. The recent understanding of crosstalk between various cellular compartments in mediating their redox state spatially and temporally is discussed. Emphasis on the beneficial effects of ROS in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis, regulating diverse cellular functions, and activating acclimation responses in plants exposed to abiotic and biotic stresses are described. The comprehensive view of cellular ROS dynamics covering the breadth and versatility of ROS will contribute to understanding the complexity of apparently contradictory ROS roles in plant physiological responses in less than optimum environments.									139	5	2	0	110	1	145			0981-9428	1873-2690		WOS:000475997300036	31207496

Dissolved redox mediators, like nitroxides, providing increased energy efficiency and longer lifetime are promising tools to overcome this challenge. Since this auspicious concept is still in its infancy, the underlying chemical reactions as well as the impact of the different (electro) chemical parameters are poorly understood. Herein, we derive an electrochemical model for the charging reactions, which is validated by potentiostatic measurements. The model elucidates the impact of the major factors including basic cell parameters and the chemical properties of the redox mediator. The model is applied to the promising class of nitroxides, which is systematically investigated by using derivatives of TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy), AZADO (2-azaadamantane-N-oxyl), and an azaphenalene based nitroxide. The nitroxides are electrochemically characterized by cyclic voltammetry and their performance as redox mediators is studied in Li-O-2 batteries with an ether-based electrolyte. Based on the presented model, the charging profiles of the different nitroxide redox mediators are correlated with their molecular structures.									91	2	1	0	4	0	92			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000365410100042	26563563

Thermal decomposition at 450 degrees C (1 h, air stream) was adopted as standard procedure. Metal support pretreatment, solvent mixture, method of applying the precursor mixture and calcination procedure were all investigated. X-ray diffraction, scanning electronic microscopy, voltammetric and differential capacity analysis show the use of HCl 1:1 as solvent and applying the mixture by brush led to fragile rugged/porous oxide coatings. However, for the same conditions, but controlled calcination (heating/cooling rates), the coating becomes more compact. Using isopropanol as solvent results in a more homogeneous coating, presenting the lowest morphology factor. Kinetic investigation shows the rugged/porous coating presents the lowest Tafel slopes and the highest global electrocatalytic activity for OER. The more compact the coating the lower the electrochemically active surface area and the global OER activity. Ozone efficiency depends on the electrochemically active area while support pretreatment strongly influences the lifetime of the electrode. Application of a Pt interlayer between the oxide and Ti base improves the service life.									21	4	0	0	2	2	22			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000230069700011

The fabricated Ti/SnO2-Sb-HFs electrode was characterized in detail by SEM and XRD that reveal a denser surface layer and a smaller crystallite size rather than traditional Ti/SnO2-Sb electrode. Through in-depth investigation of electrochemical properties by CV, Voltammetric charge analysis, EIS and ISV, the results show that the Ti/SnO2-Sb-HFs electrode has a higher oxygen evolution potential, a lower charge transfer resistance and a larger electrochemical active surface area. Especially, the stability of the electrode is improved most obviously. The accelerated life of Ti/SnO2-Sb-HFs electrode can reach 149.5 min at current density of 1 A cm(-2), which is 9.3 times as long as that of electrode without hierarchical flower-like structure. Moreover, Acid Red 73 was selected as simulated wastewater to evaluate the electrocatalytic oxidation ability of electrodes. The experiments showed that the removal rate of AR 73 and COD on Ti/SnO2-Sb-HFs electrode can reach 98.7% and 83.9% respectively after 5 h, which was superior to that of Ti/SnO2-Sb electrode (91.5% and 72.6%).									6	0	0	0	3	0	6			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000505643500037

This material has potential in the fabrication of low cost ceramic matrix composites with high temperature capability. Here we study the relationship between the microstructure of Blackglas(TM) resins and ceramics and the postcure temperature using solid-state NMR to determine explicitly the microstructure evolution from resin to ceramic. In this study, Si-29 solid-state NMR reveals a dependence between the postcure temperature and the microstructure of the resin. which then effects the resulting ceramic structure. The postcure temperature that appears to give optimal mechanical and oxidative properties of Blackglas(TM) ceramic is around 150 degrees C. For a resin postcured at 250 degrees C, the incorporation of oxygen into the resin network, and thermal redistribution reactions between Si-H and Si-O bonds, results in a dramatic and detrimental change of microstructure compared to that of resins postcured at 100 degrees C and 150 degrees C.

By combining Kelvin probe microscopy with classical optical techniques it has been possible to monitor the evolution of the nanoscale contact potential, the surface photovoltage and the optical properties of the material establishing a correlation between them. Contrary to what is usually accepted, it has been found that the nanoscale surface photovoltage is larger when the polymer is already photobleached. In addition, it has been possible to distinguish between the photophysical processes that govern the working principle of a polymer-based device and the photochemical reactions that degrade the material. Although complex charges trapping phenomena take place during the irradiation, the surface photovoltage effect depends only on the number of photons that have reached the polymer.

The influence of the potential/time pre-treatment of the ruthenium substrates and three different potentials of the oxide film formation on the electrochemical behaviour of the oxide films generated are followed by impedance and current transient measurements. It is shown that all oxide films exhibited charge-storage/delivery properties over a certain range of polarisation potentials with nearly equal total (pseudo)capacitance values that indicate no influence of either the formation potential or the ruthenium pre-treatment procedure on the quantity of active metal sites. There is, however, a significant influence of the ruthenium pre-treatment procedure on the content of proton oxygen sites (OH-, H2O species) that is responsible for the degree of kinetic inhibition of the charge-storage/delivery reaction, the fraction of the capacitance that is available rapidly, the stability of the films towards the total film reduction, and the formation of the maximum possible oxidation level of the oxide films, The different contents of the proton oxygen sites are related to the different contents of water molecules inside the differently pre-treated ruthenium substrates prior to anodic oxidation. The potential of formation acts predominantly on the average oxidation state of ruthenium inside the oxide films initially formed. The electrochemical behaviour of the oxide films over a descending range of potentials is determined by the properties of the oxide films initially formed. The electrochemical behaviour of the oxide films over the range of increased potentials is determined by the polarisation potential and the content of available proton oxygen sites, irrespective of the formation potential.

Special emphasis is given to NO2 and N2O reduction with the decrease of O-2 content in the feedstock gas. A detailed reaction mechanism including electronic and ionic processes, as well as the contribution of radicals and excited atomic/molecular species is proposed. The temporal evolution of the densities of NO, NO2 and N2O species, and some other by-products, is analyzed, and the major pathways for the NxOy remediation are discussed for one pulse. Subsequently, simulations are presented for a multi-pulses case, where three O-2 contents are tested for optimization of the remediation process. It is found that when the gas mixture O-2/N-2/H2O/NOx has no initial O-2 content, the best NOx and N2O remediation is achieved.									31	1	0	0	3	0	31			1612-8850	1612-8869		WOS:000306279500005

Electrosynthesis of hypochlorous acid in a filter-press electrolyzer and its modeling in dilute chloride solutions								JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				892						115286	10.1016/j.jelechem.2021.115286		MAY 2021		JUL 1 2021	2021	This paper shows computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations during the accumulation of hypochlorous acid (HClO), through the anodic oxidation of chloride ion (Cl-), in acidic condition at pH 3, in a filter-press cell equipped with a Ti|Ir-Sn-Ru oxides plate and a 316 stainless-steel plate as the anode and cathode, respectively. The flow plant considers the filter-press cell coupled with a recirculation tank. The chloride oxidation modeling consisted of solving a tertiary current distribution problem by coupling the average diffusion-convection equation for turbulent flow. The model considered the side oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The experimental validation of Cl- depletion and HClO accumulation was made by electrolysis trials using 0.002 m3 of two solutions containing 15 and 35 mol m-3 NaCl at pH 3, at current densities of 50, 100, 150 and 200 A m-2, and flow rate of 0.003 m3 min-1. The best electrolysis was reached at 200 A m-2, achieving 12.2 mol m-3 HClO after four hours, with current efficiency and electrolytic energy consumption of 25% and 0.023 kWh (g HClO)-1, respectively. Experimental electrolysis data agree well with CFD simulations, highlighting that only 25% of the applied current produced HClO and the OER consumed the rest.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000663793400005

This limitation is overcome in the gas-phase approach, particularly by oxidative chemical vapor deposition (oCVD), leading to the simultaneous synthesis and deposition of conjugated porphyrin coatings. We have investigated the impact of the metal cation of 5,15-diphenyl metalloporphyrins (MDPP; M = Co, Cu, Mg, Zn, Pd, Pt, Ag, Ru, Ag, and FeCl) on the dehydrogenative coupling reaction leading to fused-metalloporphyrin thin films via oCVD and on the optoelectronic properties of the resulting thin films. We found that the nature of the chelated cation strongly affects the intermolecular coupling efficiency, as well as the occurrence of side reactions such as chlorination, intramolecular cyclization, demetallation/re-metalation, and oxidation of the porphyrin core. Moreover, we discussed the influence of the above-mentioned reactions on the optoelectronic properties of the fused metalloporphyrin coatings, in view of their potential application in photo-electrocatalytic systems. This study paves the way toward the engineering and future implementation of porphyrin-based systems for clean and efficient solar fuel production.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000746047600001	35308894

Most super-asymptotic giant branch (SAGB) stars are expected to end their life as oxygen-neon white dwarfs rather than electron capture supernovae (ECSN). The reason is ascribed to the ability of the second dredge-up to significantly reduce the mass of the He core and of the efficient AGB winds to remove the stellar envelope before the degenerate core reaches the critical mass for the activation of electron capture reactions.Aims. In this study, we investigate the formation of ECSN through case A and case B mass transfer. In these scenarios, when Roche lobe overflow stops, the primary has become a helium star. With a small envelope left, the second dredge-up is prevented, potentially opening new paths to ECSN.Methods. We compute binary models using our stellar evolution code BINSTAR. We consider three different secondary masses of 8, 9, and 10 M. and explore the parameter space, varying the companion mass, orbital period, and input physics.Results. Assuming conservative mass transfer, with our choice of secondary masses all case A systems enter contact either during the main sequence or as a consequence of reversed mass transfer when the secondary overtakes its companion during core helium burning. Case B systems are able to produce ECSN progenitors in a relatively small range of periods (3 <= P(d) <= 30) and primary masses (10.9 <= M/M-circle dot <= 11.5). Changing the companion mass has little impact on the primary's fate as long as the mass ratio M-1/M-2 remains less than 1.4-1.5, above which evolution to contact becomes unavoidable. We also find that allowing for systemic mass loss substantially increases the period interval over which ECSN can occur. This change in the binary physics does not however affect the primary mass range. We finally stress that the formation of ECSN progenitors through case A and B mass transfer is very sensitive to adopted binary and stellar physics.Conclusions. Close binaries provide additional channels for ECSN but the parameter space is rather constrained likely making ECSN a rare event.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1432-0746			WOS:000435610500001

Active, robust and cheap photocatalysts are required for large-scale photocatalytic H-2 evolution reaction (p-HER), which transforms solar energy into chemical energy. Here we report the decoration of Ni-imidazole framework (NiIm) with CdS nanorods for p-HER. The p-HER rate of CdS/NiIm hybrid sharply increased by about 14.23 times to 21,712 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) when compared with that of CdS alone. Physicochemical characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal strong interactions at the CdS/NiIm interface and the presence of numerous Ni-N4 active sites on NiIm leading to the significant performance enhancement. This work demonstrates that NiIm acts as an affordable and abundant co catalyst that remarkably enhances the p-HER, and enlightens the further development in the design and preparation of metal-organic framework-based materials for various applications in photocatalysis and related subjects.									7	2	0	0	0	0	7			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000772757000003

Palladium complexes bearing calixpyrrole ligands with pendant hydrogen bond donors: Synthesis, structural characterization, electrochemistry and dihydrogen evolution								POLYHEDRON				225						116046	10.1016/j.poly.2022.116046				OCT 1 2022	2022	A series of three calixpyrrole ligands (1a-c) with pendant nitrogen-based hydrogen bond donors, R, were syn-thesized and coordinated to palladium to produce metal complexes (2a-c), where R = NH2 (a); NHC(O)CH3 (b); or NHC(O)OC(CH3)3 (c). The calixpyrrole compounds were generated using a Schiff-base reaction starting with 5,5 & PRIME;-diformyl-2,2 & PRIME;-diphenyldipyrromethane and an aniline precursor. The deprotonated calixpyrrole species were subsequently bound to palladium to generate distorted square planar complexes. The pendant groups were not coordinated to the metal with Pd-N distances of 3.36 to 4.79 & ANGS;. The electrochemical properties of the palladium complexes were also explored, and 2a-c displayed two irreversible oxidations above 0.0 V vs ferrocene/ferro-cenium (Fc/Fc+), as well as two irreversible reductions below -0.70 V vs Fc/Fc+. Interestingly, the free ligands showed similar electrochemical features, suggesting redox non-innocence. Preliminary reactivity studies indi-cated the palladium complexes did not activate small molecules, but they did catalyze H2 evolution in the presence of acid. The onset of catalysis for 2a-c was approximately 0.4-0.5 V more positive than a glassy carbon electrode, and the active species could undergo 500 scans without significant changes in activity. The catalysts were found to be heterogeneous in nature and adsorbed onto the working electrode.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0277-5387	1873-3719		WOS:000844046300010

In the field of solar fuels research these involve predominantly photosystem II and hydrogenases, which catalyze water oxidation and hydrogen evolution, as well as related biomimetic and bio-inspired models. Theoretical methods are extensively used to better comprehend the nature of catalytic intermediates, establish important structure-function and structure-property correlations, elucidate functional principles, and uncover the catalytic activity of these complex systems by unravelling the key steps of their reaction mechanism. Computations in the field of water oxidation and hydrogen evolution are used as predictive tools to elucidate structures, explain and synthesize complex experimental observations from advanced spectroscopic techniques, rationalize reactivity on the basis of atomistic models and electronic structure, and guide the design of new synthetic targets. This feature article covers recent advances in the application of quantum chemical methods for understanding the nature of catalytic intermediates and the mechanism by which photosystem II and hydrogenases achieve their function, and points at essential questions that remain only partly answered and at challenges that will have to be met by future advances and applications of quantum and computational chemistry.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000634386700001	33885698

Herein we report surface sulfurized CoMn2O4 microspikes (S-CoMn2O4-MSs) grown directly at low temperature and ambient atmosphere using a two-step facile synthesis protocol, requiring only 310 s. S-CoMn2O4-MSs showed excellent OER activity with an overpotential of 300 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) while pristine Mn3O4 and Co3O4 required 580 and 410 mV to deliver the same current density value. Moreover, we rationally designed the study to gradually decrease the Tafel slope value from 307.5 to 26.2 mV dec(-1) for the best electrocatalyst, with excellent stability at 20 mA cm(-2) for 24 h without any binder. This overall performance compares well with very recently reported oxides and CoMn2O4 based systems and the as-synthesized material showed highly competitive overall performance. During this work, the stability of the S2- layer remained the main concern and was confirmed by several characterization techniques. We investigated the surface blockage role of the surface S2- layer and, therefore, optimized the degree of sulfurization for best performance. In the end, we attributed and supported the exciting performance of S-CoMn2O4 MSs to the synergistic effect of Co and Mn, their unique morphology, the easily oxidizable lower oxidation states of cobalt (due to surface sulfurization treatment), and the large interior structure for increased contact with the electrolyte.									37	0	0	0	2	0	37			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000650212100001		
J	Journois, D								Hemofiltration during cardiopulmonary bypass								KIDNEY INTERNATIONAL				53				S174	S177					66	MAY 1998	1998	Several factors combine to facilitate the evolution towards heart and multi-organ failure following cardiac surgery. Some of these factors are related to pure cardiac aspects, for example, the existence of a preoperative heart disease, the use of aortic cross clamping or performance of cardiotomy. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) also plays an important role in the occurrence of postoperative organ dysfunctions by two principal means. It induces a profound hemodilution, which impairs oxygen transport through tissues. This phenomenon becomes obvious in the postoperative period by the existence of increased transpulmonary O-2 gradients, extravascular lung water volume and subsequent impairments of O-2 transport. (2) Cardiopulmonary bypass is deleterious by triggering an important inflammatory reaction. This reaction is largely related to the ratio of the circuit area to the patient's body surface area and is therefore maximal in children. It has been widely demonstrated that the very early paths of this reaction imply several humoral factors including kinins, coagulation factor XII and complement fragments. The activation of these factors is self-amplified and triggers both expression and release of numerous mediators by endothelial cells and leukocytes. Finally, these mediators are responsible for the well described "post-bypass syndrome" which is, from a clinical viewpoint, very close to hyperkinetic septic shock. Several methods have been proposed to reduce the deleterious effects of both cardiac surgery and CPB. The older one is hypothermia that considerably reduces the triggering of the inflammatory mediator network. Heparin-coated circuits may also reduce this reaction to some extent. Hemofiltration has been introduced in the 1990s in CPB management. Because of its very high tolerance in patients with compromised circulatory status this technique was already used in the postoperative period to treat patients with acute renal failure. Initially hemofiltration was intended to correct the accumulation of extravascular water during or immediately following the surgical procedure. Nevertheless, several of its side-effects appeared to be useful, such as the reduction of postoperative blood loss and immediate improvement in hemodynamics. Several studies attempted to point out the mechanism of action of hemofiltration and although removal of inflammatory mediator occurs, there is currently no proof that this removal is the actual mechanism by which this technique acts.									28	0	0	0	11	0	28			0085-2538	1523-1755		WOS:000073285700035	9573598

Mechanically polished samples								JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH				62	3			412	421		10.1002/jbm.10329				DEC 5 2002	2002	Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is used to monitor the long-term stability (up to 150 days) of mechanically polished commercial pure titanium, Ti6Al4V, Ti6Al7Nb, and CoCrMo alloys in O.1M sodium sulfate and fetal bovine serum. A capacitive spectrum in the frequency range from 10(-3) to 10(5) Hz is always found and the impedance spectra can be fitted by a simple parallel RC circuit with a constant phase element. The open circuit potential observed in serum is always more cathodic and the polarization resistance (RP) is higher than that recorded in sodium sulfate solutions. The observed variation of the equivalent capacitance in serum bovine suggests that an adsorption layer of organic molecules develops on the electrode surface and it is responsible for both the decrease in open circuit potential and the higher RP, because it hinders the oxygen evolution reaction and the charge transfer responsible for the passive film dissolution (or growth). Among the alloys studied, Ti6Al4V displayed the highest steady-state values of RP both in serum and in sodium sulfate.

In this context, the discovery of proper catalysts for electrochemical and photochemical water splitting assumes great importance. There is also a serious intent to eliminate platinum and other noble metal catalysts. To replace Pt by a non-metallic catalyst with desirable characteristics is a challenge. Borocarbonitrides, (BxCyNz) which constitutes a new class of 2D material, offer great promise as non-metallic catalysts because of the easy tunability of bandgap, surface area, and other electronic properties with variation in composition. Recently, BxCyNz composites with excellent electrochemical and photochemical hydrogen generation activities have been found, especially noteworthy being the observation that BxCyNz with a carbon-rich composition or its nanocomposites with MoS2 come close to Pt in electrocatalytic properties, showing equally good photochemical activity.									82	3	0	0	4	0	82			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000463970200003	30375670

Low concentration of methylamine (mM range) was shown to affect water oxidation and the advancement of the S-states. Modified kinetics of chlorophyll fluorescence rise and thermoluminescence in the presence of methylamine indicated that the electron transfer was affected at both sides of PSII, and in particular the electron transfer between Y-Z and P680(+). As the concentration of methylamine was raised above 10 mM, the extrinsic polypeptides associated with the oxygen-evolving complex were lost and energy transfer between PSII antenna complexes and reaction centers was impaired. It was concluded that methylamine is able to affect both extrinsic and intrinsic subunits of PSII even at the lowest concentrations used where the extrinsic polypeptides of the OEC are still associated with the luminal side of the photosystem. As methylamine concentration increases, the extrinsic polypeptides are lost and the interaction with intrinsic domains is amplified resulting in an increased F-0. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

At a rate of 2.8 kg ha(-1), DBU reduced cucumber root and shoot biomass between 59 and 63%, regardless of time of application. DBU caused dilation of grana and irregularities in the lamellae of cucumber chloroplasts and completely inhibited photosynthesis (measured as decreased oxygen evolution) of hydrilla after 1 h of exposure. DBU also reduced the peak-to-terminal chlorophyll a fluorescence ratio of hydrilla. DBU probably inhibits photosynthesis and consequently plant growth of susceptible plants.									16	0	0	0	14	0	16			0021-8561			WOS:A1994NM29800031

For this reason, urgent action on the management of these wastes is necessary within a framework that respects the environment and human health. Mobile phone components can be physically segregated through grinding at the dismantling sites, in order to reuse or reprocess (via chemical or physical recycling) the recovered plastics and valuable metals.A kinetic study of the thermal decomposition of a mobile phone case has been carried out under different conditions by thermogravimetry. Several experiments were performed in a nitrogen atmosphere (pyrolysis runs) and also in an oxidative atmosphere with two different oxygen concentrations (10% and 20% oxygen in nitrogen). Dynamic runs and dynamic + isothermal runs have been carried out to obtain much decomposition data under different operating conditions. Moreover some TG-MS runs were performed in order to better understand the thermal decomposition of a mobile phone case and identify some compounds emitted during the controlled heating of this material. A scheme of two independent reactions for pseudocomponents has been proposed for the pyrolysis process. For the combustion runs, the scheme proposed includes two pyrolytic reactions competing with other two reactions with formation of an intermediate residue, and finally the reaction of oxidation/burning of the intermediate residue.Furthermore, pyrolysis and combustion runs at 500 degrees C in a horizontal laboratory furnace were carried out. More than 50 compounds, including carbon oxides, light hydrocarbons, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been identified and quantified. The main semivolatile compounds detected were phenol and styrene. Furthermore, polychlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and polychlorodibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and dioxin-like PCBs produced were analyzed. In the combustion run, PCDDs were obtained in higher amounts than PCDFs and HxCDD was the most emitted homologue. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The degradation rate of BPA was 23.58 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4 and the efficiency benzaldehyde formation rate without the need of any solvent increased to 5.43 times that of g-C3N4. M the same time, the band structure calculation of its simulated structure is performed by DFT, which shows that the introduction of oxygen linking band can adjust its band structure and obtain a smaller band gap. In addition, the PACN displays an enhanced photocatalytic degradation of BPA under the long wavelength (X 550 nm) and NIR light irradiation (X 760 nm), which indicates that the synthesized materials have a broad spectrum of photocatalytic activity. According to the results of secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), C atoms and 0 atoms were introduced into the original g-C3N4 skeleton. In addition, the intermediate products were detected by mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), and the BPA degradation pathway was proposed. A feasible photocatalytic reaction mechanism was also proposed.									27	1	0	0	8	0	27			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000581684900040	32652416

At the BDD electrode, three ECL waves (1.25, 2.30 and 3.72 V) were observed in cyclic voltammograms for 20 mM ascorbic acid (AA). For the ECL peaks observed at 1.25 V corresponding to the oxidation potential for Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) (1.15 V), the light intensities and current densities were found to depend on the square root of the AA concentration. This suggests that AA oxidation, followed by the fort-nation of the reducing radical that is necessary for generating the excited state of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+)* occurred through homogeneous electron-transfer between Ru(bPY)(3)(3+) and the AA species. However, for the ECL peaks at 2.30 V, the current densities and light intensities linearly increased with increasing AA concentration, suggesting that the reducing radical was formed through the direct oxidation at the electrode surface. The ECL reaction at 3.72 V was observed only at the BDD electrode and not at other electrodes. The onset potentials for the light intensity were approximately 2.6 V, independently of the type of the co-reactants (e.g. 2-propanol and AA). The peak potentials exhibited linear relation with the co-reactant concentration. In the analysis of the ECL intensity for various co-reactants (alcohols) that show different reactivity for the hydrogen abstraction reaction, the order of the light intensities at the peaks for alcohols was found to be consistent with that for the rate constants of the hydrogen abstraction reaction. These results indicate that the co-reactant radical was formed through the hydrogen abstraction reaction with the hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) generated during the oxygen evolution reaction.

Here, we design a sunlight promotion strategy into rechargeable zinc-air battery with significantly reduced charging potential below the theoretical cell voltage of zinc-air batteries. The sunlight-promoted zinc-air battery using BiVO4 or alpha-Fe2O3 air photoelectrode achieves a record-low charge potential of similar to 1.20 and similar to 1.43 V, respectively, under illumination, which is lowered by similar to 0.5-0.8 V compared to the typical charge voltage of similar to 2 V in conventional zinc-air battery. The band structure and photoelectrochemical stability of photoelectrodes are found to be key factors determining the charging performance of sunlight-promoted zinc-air batteries. The introduction of photoelectrode as an air electrode opens a facile way for developing integrated single-unit zinc-air batteries that can efficiently use solar energy to overcome the high charging overpotential of conventional zinc-air batteries.									104	4	0	0	6	0	104			2041-1723			WOS:000490982100007	31628345

The characterization, degradation performance, oxidation mechanism and mass transfer impact of the novel electrode was investigated. Compared with the conventional Ti/SnO2-Sb electrode, our novel electrode has higher oxygen evolution potential and electrochemical stability, due to the fabrication of ENTA structure. Its application for the destruction of a common biocide of MIT (2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one), the first-order rate constants were determined from 0.01 min(-1) to 0.505 min(-1) during the electrochemical process. The radical oxidation and non-radical oxidation of the MIT degradation contribution were quantitatively identified as 87.8% and 12.1%, respectively. Furthermore, the second-rate constant between hydroxyl radical and MIT was estimated at 3.72 x 10(9)M(-1) S-1. The mass transfer impact was investigated with a differential column batch reactor (DCBR) under the conditions of various electrode spacing and fluid velocities. It indicated that reducing the electrode spacing and increasing the fluid velocity would enhance the mass transfer process and increase the overall oxidation rate. Meanwhile, the EE/O decreased from 17.7 kWh m(-3) to 9.7 kWh m(-3), and the mass transfer coefficients increased dramatically from 0.52 x 10(-6) m s(-1) to 2.48 x 10(-6) m s(-1).

The results revealed different voltage transients for the three different Compositions during the stages of barrier layer growth and steady-state pore growth. In addition, the morphology of the oxide layers, as determined by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (cross-section) and laser scanning confocal microscopy (surface) indicated: (i) thickening of the oxide layers with current density and time regardless of the substrate composition (ii) entrapment of silicon in the growing layers (for the binary and ternary substrates), associated with a non-uniform thickness, a scalloped substrate/oxide interface and surface cracks and GO appearance of flaws like features from the commencement of anodizing (AlSi10Cu3) and after a certain anodizing time (AlSi10) associated with enhanced oxygen evolution and (partial) oxidation of second phases.

CDs-based composite materials showcase attractive electrocatalytic performances because of the abundant active sites and charge distribution on the material surface. Considering the complicated structure of CDs, it's important to identify the specific catalytic activity source and understand catalytic mechanisms with the aid of theoretical method. In this review, the latest advancements are presented on improving the electrocatalytic activity and stability of CDs-based composite materials from theoretical perspective.

It also shows decent durability at 100 mA cm(-2). The UOR mechanism exploration reveals that the rate-determining step is the removal of the last proton from the amino-group.

The decay of the flash-induced high fluorescence state of PSII was measured with pulse amplitude modulated fluorometry in thylakoids and PSII enriched membrane fragments. Calculated Q(A)(-) decay was well described by three exponential decay components, reflecting Q(A)(-) reoxidation with halftimes of 450 and 860 mu s, 2 and 7.6 ms, and 111 and 135 ms in thylakoids and PSII membranes, respectively. The effect of modification of the PSII donor side by changing pH or by removal of the extrinsic 17 and 24 kDa proteins on period four oscillations in both maximum fluorescence yield and the relative contribution of Q(A)(-) reoxidation reactions was compared to flash-induced oxygen yield. The four-step oxidation of the manganese cluster of the WOC was found to be necessary but not sufficient to produce modulation of PSII fluorescence. The capacity of the WOC to generate molecular oxygen was also required to observe a period four in the fluorescence; however, direct quenching by oxygen was not responsible for the modulation. Potential mechanisms responsible for the periodicity of four in both maximum fluorescence yield pattern and flash-dependent changes in proportion of centers with different Q(A)(-) reoxidation rates are discussed with respect to intrinsic deprotonation events occurring at the WOC.									19	0	0	0	18	0	19			0006-2960			WOS:000082334700002	10451357

However, the usage of bare anodic TiO2 nanotubes in (photo)electrochemical reactions is limited by their higher charge transfer resistance and higher bandgaps than those of semiconductor or metal catalysts. In this review, we describe several techniques for doping TiO2 nanotubes with suitable catalysts or active materials to overcome the insulating properties of TiO2 and enhance its charge transfer reaction, and we suggest anodization parameters for the formation of TiO2 nanotubes. We then focus on the (photo)electrochemistry and photocatalysis-related applications of catalyst-doped anodic TiO2 nanotubes grown on Ti foil, including water electrolysis, photocatalysis, and solar cells. We also discuss key examples of the effects of doping and the resulting improvements in the efficiency of doped TiO2 electrodes for the desired (photo)electrochemical reactions.									27	1	0	0	1	0	27			2073-4344			WOS:000451150200071

Viable methods process as input details on materials structure, composition and reaction conditions. Their output includes metrics for stability and activity, phase diagrams, as well as mechanistic insights on reaction mechanisms and pathways. The core challenge, connecting input to output, is a self-consistency problem that couples the electrode potential to variables for the electronic structure of the solid electrode, solvent properties and ion distributions in the electrolyte as well as specific properties of a boundary region in-between.

The final decomposition products were characterized by Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopy. Water molecules were released first, followed by a distinct decomposition step with endothermic DTA peak of 1 and 2 at 273 and 248 degrees C. respectively, corresponding to the evolution of molecular oxygen as confirmed by EGA-MS. The released amounts of O-2 were determined as 0.42 and 0.52 mol pro formula of 1 and 2, respectively. The decomposition product of K2FeO4 at 250 degrees C was determined as Fe(III) species in the form of KFeO2. Formation of an amorphous mixture of superoxide, peroxide, and oxide of potassium may be other products of the thermal conversion of iron(VI) oxide I to account for less than expected released oxygen. The thermogravimetric and Mossbauer data suggest that barium iron perovskite with the intermediate valence state of iron (between III and IV) was the product of thermal decomposition of iron(VI) oxide 2.

In this paper, we report a facile magnesiothermic reduction of commercial TiO2 nano-particles under Ar atmosphere and at 550 degrees C followed by acid treatment to synthesize reduced black TiO2 powders, which possesses a unique crystalline core-amorphous shell structure composed of disordered surface and oxygen vacancies and shows significantly improved optical absorption in the visible region. The unique core-shell structure and high absorption enable the reduced black TiO2 powders to exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activity, including splitting of water in the presence of Pt as a cocatalyst and degradation of methyl blue (MB) under visible light irradiation. Photocatalytic evaluations indicate that the oxygen vacancies play key roles in the catalytic process. The maximum hydrogen production rates are 16.1 and 163 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) under the full solar wavelength range of light and visible light, respectively. This facile and versatile method could be potentially used for large scale production of colored TiO2 with remarkable enhancement in the visible light absorption and solar-driven hydrogen production.									10	1	0	0	2	0	11			1388-0764	1572-896X		WOS:000428465700002

In this transformant, psbD is expressed in copper-depleted but not in copper-replete medium. Because psbD encodes the D2 reaction center polypepticle of photosystem 11 (PSII), the repression of psbD leads to the loss of PSII. We have tested this system for hydrogen production. Upon addition of copper to cells pregrown in copper-deficient medium, PSII levels declined to a level at which oxygen consumption by respiration exceeded oxygen evolution by PSII The resulting anaerobic conditions led to the induction of hydrogenase activity. Because the Cyc6 promoter is also induced under anaerobic conditions, this system opens possibilities for sustained cycling hydrogen production. Moreover, this inducible gene expression system is applicable to any chloroplast gene by replacing its 5' UTR with the psbD 5' UTR in the same genetic background. To make these strains phototrophic, the 5' UTR of the psbD gene was replaced by the petA 5' UTR. As an example, we show that the reporter gene aadA driven by the psbD 5' UTR confers resistance to spectinonnycin in the absence of copper and sensitivity in its presence in the culture medium.									124	0	0	0	91	0	125			0027-8424			WOS:000250638400057	17951433

The Heyrovsky-type associative and dissociative NRR mechanisms on the (110) facet and edge of the NC are systematically elucidated by calculating reaction free energies for all the possible elementary reaction steps in NRR. Our results show that the most of the NRR intermediates (*N-2, *N2H, *N2H2, *N, *NH, *NH2, and *NH3) bind weakly on different sites of the NC in comparison to that on the periodic Fe(110) surface. Importantly, the reaction free energy change for the potential determining step (PDS) in the distal associative mechanism with the formation of *NNH on the NC facet is lower than the edge of NC and periodic Fe(110) surface. Our study also indicates that the PDS (*NH2 formation) associated with the periodic Fe(110) surface is no longer the same as the reaction is catalyzed by the NC. The calculated value of working potential is observed lower for Fe-85 NC in comparison to that of the periodic Fe(110) surface. Furthermore, the current density plot indicates that the NC shows less hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity compared to other considered Fe based systems. Apart from the working potential study, the positive shift of dissolution potential has also been considered for dissolution behavior of Fe from the NC with respect to surface, confirming its stability in an electrochemical environment. The Fe-85 NC electrocatalyst possess quite a low overpotential of 0.29 V for NRR with reduced HER activity, which is further lower compared to that of the well-established Re(111) and enhanced stability toward Fe dissolution in comparison to that of the periodic Fe(110) surface. Therefore, such an NC system may perform as an efficient catalyst for an electrochemical NRR.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2574-0970		WOS:000692034900019

In this work, we report the synthesis of iron (ca. 10 at%) oxide catalysts with the doping of a small amount (0.5-0.6 at%) of ruthenium oxide, which have been deposited onto the surface of ceria nanorods by an optimized deposition-precipitation (DP) route. Multiple characterization studies including X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and nitrogen adsorption/desorption confirmed the identical structural and textural properties of the ceria support after the DP step. Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) combined with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) showed the formation of subnanometer iron species in the fresh samples. Furthermore, the X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) technique with the help of related data analysis verified the generation of noncrystalline iron oxide clusters predominantly composed of Fe3+ ions. Here, the addition of a secondary metal (ruthenium) greatly promoted the dispersion of Fe over the ceria nanorods. After the catalytic reaction of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS), the transformation from subnanometer iron oxide species to ionic Fe delta+ single atoms has been revealed and confirmed by the corresponding profile fits on the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra. In contrast to the normal coarsening process, the FTS conditions (up to 300 degrees C, 2 MPa, CO/H-2 = 1/1) did drive the creation of such iron single atoms solely coordinated by oxygen ions.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2052-1553			WOS:000417060300014

SOA precursors were n-decane (n-C-10), n-pentadecane (n-C-15), n-heptadecane (n-C-17), tricyclo[5.2.1.0(2,6)]clecane (JP-10), and vapors of diesel fuel and Southern Louisiana crude oil. Aerosol mass spectra were measured with a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer, from which normalized SOA yields, hydrogen-tocarbon (H/C) and oxygen-to-carbon (O/C) ratios, and CxHy+, CxHyO+, and CxHyO2+ ion abundances were extracted as a function of OH exposure. Normalized SOA yield curves exhibited an increase followed by a decrease as a function of OH exposure, with maximum yields at O/C ratios ranging from 0.29 to 0.74. The decrease in SOA yield correlates with an increase in oxygen content and decrease in carbon content, consistent with transitions from functionalization to fragmentation. For a subset of alkane precursors (n-C-10, n-C-15, and JP-10), maximum SOA yields were estimated to be 0.39, 0.69, and 1.1. In addition, maximum SOA yields correspond with a maximum in the CxHyO+ relative abundance. Measured correlations between OH exposure, 0/C ratio, and H/C ratio may enable identification of alkane precursor contributions to ambient SOA.									135	9	0	0	50	0	139			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000303964700025	22534114

The influence of the three main variables that govern the degradation kinetic (pH. H2O2 and Fe(II) concentrations) was evaluated with a circumscribed central composite (CCC) model and a response surface methodology (RSM). The optimal conditions for Fenton and photo-Fenton reactions are very similar: pH 3.5, around 400 mu mol L-1 H2O2 and 87 mu mol L-1 Fe(II). Under such optimized conditions, the complete AMP removal was reached after 10 min and 3 min for Fenton and photo-Fenton reactions, respectively. A very similar removal profile in the first 2 min of reaction was observed for both systems with a high degree of degradation (close to 90%). After a 2-min treatment, the Fenton reaction became slower, and the IR product analysis suggests the formation of different oxidation intermediates. This observation was confirmed by the COD and TOC evolution during the reactions. The oxidation degree, measured as Average Oxidation State (AOS), indicates that the photo-Fenton reaction produces faster most of the oxidation intermediates. The antibacterial activity (AA) of the oxidized samples was determined using the inhibition halo methodology on agar plates cultured with Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. The course of AA is concomitant with the AMP removal, which indicates that the long-term intermediates do not present antibiotic properties. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We directly observed the structural and chemical evolution of Al/CuO/Al multilayers upon heating to 700 degrees C using high-magnification transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning TEM, providing simultaneous subnanometrer imaging resolution and detailed chemical analysis. Interestingly, as deposited, the trilayer is characterized by two distinct interfacial layers: 4.1 +/- 0.2 nm thick amorphous alumina and a 15 +/- 5 nm thick mixture of AlOx and CuxAlyOz, at the bottom interface and top interface, respectively. Upon heating, we accurately characterized the evolving nature and structure of these interfaces, which are rapidly replaced by the reaction terminal oxide (Al2O3). For the first time, we unraveled the release of gaseous 0 from the sparse columnar and defective CuO well below reaction onset (at similar to 200 degrees C) which accumulates at interfaces and contributes to initiate the Al oxidation process at the vicinity of native interfaces. The oxidation process is demonstrated to be accompanied by a continuous densification and modification of the CuO layer. Between 300 and 350 degrees C, we observed a brutal shrinkage of the CuO layer (14% loss of its initial thickness) leading to the mechanical fracture in the top alumina growing layer. Consequently, this latter becomes highly permeable to oxygens leading to a brutal enhancement of the oxidation rate (X4). We also characterized stressed-induced interfacial delamination at 500 degrees C pointing clearly to the mechanical fragility of the top interface after the CuO transformation. Altogether, these results permit one to establish a multistep reaction scenario in Al/CuO sputter-deposited films supporting to an unprecedented level a mechanistic assignation of differential scanning calorimetry peaks. This study offers potential benefits for the development of aging models enabling the virtual prediction of the calorimetric response of exothermic Al/CuO thin-film reactions.									31	2	0	0	0	0	33			2574-0962			WOS:000458705400045

The 3D hierarchical architecture possesses large surface area and plenty reactive sites which contribute highly in catalysis performance. In this work we report a tetrabutyl titanate (TBT) assisted simultaneous approach of layer-assembled single-unit-cell 3D Bi2WO6 hierarchical architecture by Ti-doping. The Ti-doping beside its morphological effect can also generate crystal defects in the crystal lattice of Bi2WO6, resulting in highly enhanced visible-light driven photocatalytic performance towards highly stable refractory pollutants and profound photoelectrochemical ability. Moreover, the crystal defects mediated by Ti-doping can generate abundant oxygen vacancies which remarkably improve the selective adsorption towards different charges pollutants. Furthermore, the Ti-doping beside its great influence on the electron dynamic and band structure can also introduce the redox couples (Ti3+/Ti4+), resulting in significance enhancement in reactive oxygen species during photocatalytic reaction. The present work provides a valid route for constructing simultaneous approach of layer-assembled 3D hierarchical architecture and Ti-substitution in the crystal structure of Bi2WO6 with great improvement in photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical performance.

This study mainly focuses on the electrochemical activation behaviour of peroxydisulfate (PDS) using a Ti/ATO electrode. The catalytic performance of the Ti/ATO-electro-activated PDS system was systematically investigated. The effects of different operating conditions on the RhB degradation rate, including electrolyte pH, PDS concentration, current density, and coexisting anions, were experimentally analysed. Quenching experiments, EPR, and electrochemical methods were used to identify the dominant reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced in the Ti/ATO electro-activated PDS system. Diverse radical and non-radical oxidations were verified to exist in the Ti/ATO electro-activated PDS system. We simulated the proposed reaction pathways of persulfate ion on the SnO2 surface using first-principles calculations. Computational results imply that persulfate ions are more easily activated into SO4 center dot- when adsorbing on the surface of SnO2. Furthermore, all the feasible oxidation processes which had made contribution to the RhB removal in Ti/ATO electro-activated PDS system were discussed. This work offers a new and effective strategy for electrochemical PDS activation and a viable technique for wastewater treatment.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1383-5866	1873-3794		WOS:000780382300003

The influence of several operating parameters (i.e., pH, temperature and initial anolyte and pollutant concentrations) was determined through the Taguchi optimization method. Optimal conditions corresponded to 1 mu M CBZ, pH 2, 30 degrees C, 10 mM Na2SO4 and 50 A m(-2), resulting in complete CBZ removal in less than 5 min. Complementary scenarios with different ion species, energy sources and current densities further corroborated the suitability of the optimum. Moreover, they revealed that the optimal conditions were driven by the presence of both SO42- and NO3- ions in solution. Hence, the optimal degradation results were also attained when replacing HNO3 by NaNO3, which allowed to operate without prior pH adjustments. The contribution of (OH)-O-center dot and SO4 center dot- radicals was studied through scavenging tests and it was for the first time tentatively ascribed to the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), since the selection of the operating potential influences the type of oxidative species present. Finally, the primary transformation products formed during CBZ degradation under optimal conditions were investigated.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000810444900002

The distinct layered configuration may offer some interesting possibilities to tune the intrinsic activity by regulating the intralayer edge-shared CoO6 octahedra and the CoO2 interlayer spacing/strain. In this work, electrochemical desodiation tuning method is explored on intralayer Ag, Cu, Ce-doped Na0.7CoO2 for highly active OER catalysts. It is demonstrated that the Delta GOH* value in the volcano plot is optimized by proper desodiation. Meanwhile, the lattice strain introduced along with the desodiated process modulates the Delta GOH*, according to first principle calculations. It shows that -0.157 % compressive strain in the CoO2 layers and -1% tensile strain between CoO2 layers are introduced in the desodiated Ag doped Na0.7CoO2. Among these catalysts, the desodiated Ag-Na0.7CoO2 sample exhibits an optimal RuO2-beyond water oxidation (OER) activity with the lowest overpotential of 236 mV@10 mA/cm2, the smallest Tafel slope of 48 mV/dec and the highest mass current density of 227.8 A/g. This work provides an interesting avenues to optimize existing layered materials with inter/intralayer modifications for highly efficient water oxidation electrolysis.									16	0	0	0	2	0	16			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000700112900001

This methodology was applied to the analysis of partially pyrolysed carbon cryogels (400 degrees C), which were oxidized/activated in four different ways (phosphoric acid, Fenton like reaction, ammonium persulfate with sulfuric acid and nitric acid with hydrogen peroxide). The quantitative TPD-MS evaluation enables analysis of all the evolved gases during the sample heating (without the calibration of all gases) and distinguishes the carbonization process from the decomposition of the more thermally stable oxygen surface groups (analysis of the effect of oxidation/activation reagents). The activation by H3PO4 results in the hydrolysis and esterification of anhydrides, lactones and phenols and creation of phosphoric acid esters (C-O-P), which decompose into C-3-P=O linkages with the CO evolution. All the oxidation treatments had a similar effect on the surface chemistry. The amounts of carboxylic acids and anhydrides increased significantly, while the amount of lactones and phenol groups decreased (oxidized into carbonyls). Application of TG-MS fundamentals to the evaluation of TPD-MS profiles from a wide range of samples allows determining all the gaseous products. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, uncertainty remains around the alkaline HOR mechanism owing to a lack of direct in situ evidence of intermediates. In this study, in situ electrochemical surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and DFT were used to study HOR processes on PtNi alloy and Pt surfaces, respectively. Spectroscopic evidence indicates that adsorbed hydroxy species (OHad) were directly involved in HOR processes in alkaline conditions on the PtNi alloy surface. However, OHad species were not observed on the Pt surface during the HOR. We show that Ni doping promoted hydroxy adsorption on the platinum-alloy catalytic surface, improving the HOR activity. DFT calculations also suggest that the free energy was decreased by hydroxy adsorption. Consequently, tuning OH adsorption by designing bifunctional catalysts is an efficient method for promoting HOR activity.									31	4	0	0	1	0	32			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000612640300001	33325603

Of the photocatalysts examined, Pt/KTaO3 showed the highest photocatalytic activity for HI decomposition. KTaO3, having the lowest excitation energy, absorbs the largest number of photons for use in photocatalytic reactions, and its corresponding catalyst has the highest number of reaction sites owing to the excellent dispersion of the Pt cocatalyst.

Porous g-C3N4 (P-g-C3N4) was synthesized by altering the surface as well as the morphology of g-C3N4 by treating with oxidizing acids (chemical protonation). The photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 and P-g-C3N4 are estimated by degrading various organic dyes namely methyl blue (MB), crystal violet (CV), and rhodamine B (Rh-B) irradiated under sunlight. The optical absorption edge of g-C3N4 was found to be blue-shifted from 2.7 eV to 3 eV on protonation. The g-C3N4 shows superior photocatalytic degradation efficiency in comparison with pristine g-C3N4. The P-g-C3N4 shows enhanced photocatalytic degradation efficiency of 98%, 99%, and 90% for MB, CV, and Rh-B, respectively, in 180 mins under sunlight irradiation with a rate of the reaction of about 4.046 min(-1), 5.951 min(-1), and 2.260 min(-1). Reactive oxygen species experiments revealed that the production of(.) center dot OH radicals are responsible for the deterioration of dyes. The boosted degradation efficacy of P-g-C3N4 is attributed to an increase in the surface area thereby exposing a large number of active sites for dye degradation.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1042-6507	1563-5325		WOS:000714000500001

New electrodic materials having electrochemical selectivity, low cost and low overvoltage for electrolytic hydrogen production in sulphuric acid solutions								Hydrogen as an Energy Vector. Proceedings of the International Seminar								408	23						1980	1980	New electrocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions in sulphuric acid solutions have been studied and developed. For the cathode the possibility of utilizing tungsten carbide as electrocatalyst has been evaluated. The influence of the preparation method has been examined and a suitable method for obtaining electrodes with low overvoltage proposed. For the anode several substances have been screened as possible catalysts. They include superionic conductors, such as Ag6I4WO4, and rare earth chromites of perovskite structure. To obtain stable chromites, cations giving chromates of low solubility have been introduced in the perovskite structure. The obtained substances have shown promising catalytic activity for oxygen discharge in sulphuric acid, also at high current density. Their behaviour has been examined and compared with that of ruthenium dioxide electrodes. Teflon bonded electrodic structure has been used, having shown good mechanical strength and high utilization of the electrocatalyst surface area.					Hydrogen as an Energy Vector.

Trancmission electron microscope (TEM) images showed that PdxMo/C was 2 similar to 4 nm circular particles with uniform size and good dispersion. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results showed that the crystal lattice of Pd was expanded by adding the second component Mo, and the lattice structure of Pd was adjusted. In addition, X - ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results show that compared with Pd/C, the binding energy of Pd3d(5/2) for Pd4Mo/C was shifted by 0.50 eV to the lower direclion, indicating that Pd with higher electronegativity absorbs electrons from Mo, and the electronic structure changes. The results of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) showed that the activity of different ratios of PdxMo/C was better than that of Pd/C, and the ORR activity was the best when x=4. The initial oxidation potential and half-wave potential were 0.876 and 0.813 V, respectively, which were higher than that of 0.870 and 0.810 V of commercial Pt/C. In addition, the current density retained 82.9% after 3 h of operation, showing a significant advantage over commercial Pt/C.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1001-4861			WOS:000707926300012

Koh and P. Strasser, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2007, 129, 12624). Using cyclic voltammetry and structural XRD studies, we systematically characterize the Pt-Cu precursor compounds as well as the early stages of the selective Cu surface dissolution (dealloying) process for Pt25Cu75, Pt50Cu50, and Pt75Cu25 alloy nanoparticles annealed at both low and high temperature. We also assess the impact of the synthesis conditions on the electrocatalytic reactivity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). To gain atomistic insight into the observed voltammetric profiles, we compare our experimental results with periodic DFT calculations of trends in the thermodynamics of surface Cu dissolution potentials from highly stepped and kinked Pt(854) single crystal surfaces. The modeling suggests a dependence of the electrochemical Cu dissolution potentials on the detailed atomic environment (coordination number, nature of coordinating atoms) of the bimetallic Pt-Cu surfaces. The DFT-predicted shifts in electrochemical Cu dissolution potentials are shown to qualitatively account for the observed voltammetric profiles during Cu dealloying. Our study suggests that metal-specific energetics have to be taken into account to explain the detailed dealloying behavior of bimetallic surfaces.									175	4	0	0	3	0	175			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000256877200009	18563228

It has been concluded that high-valent M=O species such as [Mn(IV)=O](2+) and [Fe(IV)=O](2+) exhibit electrophilic property in a sharp contrast with nucleophilic character of low-valent M=O bonds: [M(II)O2-](0), and closed-shell d pi-p pi bonds of high-valent M=O species often suffer the triplet-instability, giving rise to open-shell (BS) configurations with significant metal-diradical (MDR) character: center dot M-O center dot: note that these bonds are therefore regarded as typical examples of strongly correlated electron systems. Because of the MDR character, 1,4-metal diradical mechanism was indeed preferable to four-centered mechanism in the case of addition reaction of naked Mn(IV)=O to ethylene. Recently the manganese-oxo species have been receiving renewed interest in relation to catalytic cycle of oxygen evolution from water molecules in the photosynthesis II (PSII) system. Accumulated experimental results indicate that this process is catalyzed with four manganese oxide clusters coordinated with calcium ion (CaMn4O4). Past decade we have performed BS MO theoretical investigations of manganese oxide clusters related to CaMn4O4. These calculations have elucidated that high-valent Mn(X)=O (X=IV, V) bonds exhibit intermediate MDR character (y=40-60%) in the case of total low-spin (LS) configuration but the MDR character decreases with coordination of Ca2+ and water molecules. While the MDR character of the Mn-oxo bonds becomes very high at the high-spin (HS) configuration. Our computational results enabled us to propose two possible mechanisms on the theoretical ground: (A) electrophilic (EP) mechanism and (B) radical coupling (RC) mechanism. The theoretical results indicate that the EP mechanism is preferable for the low-spin (LS) state in polar media like in the protein environments (native OEC), whereas the RC mechanism is feasible at the state without such environmental stabilization: local singlet and local triplet diradical mechanisms are proposed for the O-O coupling process. Possibilities of EP and RC mechanisms are examined in comparison with a lot of experimental results accumulated and theoretical results with several groups.					7th International Conference on Computational Methods in Science and Engineering (ICCMSE)7th International Conference on Computational Methods in Science and Engineering (ICCMSE)	SEP 29-OCT 04, 2009SEP 29-OCT 04, 2009	European Soc Computat Methods Sci, Engn & TechnolEuropean Soc Computat Methods Sci, Engn & Technol	Rhodes, GREECERhodes, GREECE	8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0094-243X		978-0-7354-1122-7	WOS:000317113600006

This rapid transition may be related to an atmospheric instability caused by the formation of the ozone layer. Previous works were all based on 1D photochemical models. Here, we revisit the GOE with a 3D photochemical-climate model to investigate the possible impact of the atmospheric circulation and the coupling between the climate and the dynamics of the oxidation. We show that the diurnal, seasonal and transport variations do not bring significant changes compared to 1D models. Nevertheless, we highlight a temperature dependence for atmospheric photochemical losses. A cooling during the late Archean could then have favored the triggering of the oxygenation. In addition, we show that the Huronian glaciations, which took place during the GOE, could have introduced a fluctuation in the evolution of the oxygen level. Finally, we show that the oxygen overshoot, which is expected to have occurred just after the GOE, was likely accompanied by a methane overshoot. Such high methane concentrations could have had climatic consequences and could have played a role in the dynamics of the Huronian glaciations.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1814-9324	1814-9332		WOS:000871564700001

This process includes two steps: pyrolysis at 550 degreesC and plasma post-combustion at 1400 degreesC with an excess of oxygen.CEA/.../SCD has developed a pilot-scale reactor using a plasma torch to burn the gases produced by a rotary kiln pyrolyzer. The tubular reactor is the evaporator of a heat transfer system ensuring both removal of the heat flux and control of the wall temperature (between 200 and 400 degreesC) to prevent condensation. Efficiency of the concept and reliability of the pilot have been proved by several long time trials.In order to control or to predict the composition of the exhaust gases, a model previously developed with a C/H/O/N system, has been extended to chlorinated and fluorinated wastes. This model is based on calculation of chemical kinetics inside the post-combustion plasma reactor. The temperature evolution along the cylindrical afterburner chamber is deduced from calorimetric balances and from thermocouples.More than fifty species and two hundred reactions, direct and reverse, have been taken into account in the following chemical system: Ar/C/H/O/N/Cl/F.Model predictions have been compared with off-gas analysis results, concerning especially COx NOx and chlorine compounds.					6th European Conference on Thermal Plasma Processes6th European Conference on Thermal Plasma Processes	MAY 30-JUN 03, 2000MAY 30-JUN 03, 2000		STRASBOURG, FRANCESTRASBOURG, FRANCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					1-56700-165-3	WOS:000172097800106

Through extensive optimization, a rapid, facile and heat-treatment free route is progressed which ensues 88.4 and 92.3% degradation of congo-red dye for CNTs/ZnO and g-C3N4/ZnO, respectively. g-C3N4/ZnO shows the highest value of correlation co-efficient (R-2) (0.9927) and rate constant (K-C) (0.0390 min(-1)) among all others. g-C3N4/ZnO-HPs(4) displays the highest potential of 1.54 V and over potential of 310 mV for current density value of 10 mA/cm(2) compared to others composite while CNTs/ZnO-HPs(4) Tafel slope has a value of 42 mV/dec. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffractometry and energy dispersive spectrometry were carried out to confirm the efficacy of nano-composites while electron LSV, Tafel slopes and Nyquist plots were plotted to reveal the consequent efficient electro-catalytic behavior. The modified recipe for the development of nanocomposites having CMs exhibited its potential for use in multiple engineering applications, including but not limited to photocatalysis and oxygen evolution reaction.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2190-5509	2190-5517		WOS:000538013400004

Li-O-2 batteries have high theoretical capacity, but are difficult to put into practical use due to problems such as high overvoltage, low charge-discharge efficiency, poor rate, and cycle performance. The development of high-efficiency catalysts to effectively solve the shortcomings of Li-O-2 batteries is of great significance to finding a solution for energy problems. Herein, we design CoFe2O4/g-C3N4 composites, and combine the advantages of the g-C3N4 material with the spinel-type metal oxide material. The flaky structure of g-C3N4 accelerates the transportation of oxygen and lithium ions and inhibits the accumulation of CoFe2O4 particles. The CoFe2O4 materials accelerate the decomposition of Li2O2 and reduce electrode polarization in the charge-discharge reaction. When CoFe2O4/g-C3N4 composites are used as catalysts in Li-O-2 batteries, the battery has a better discharge specific capacity of 9550 mA h g(-1) (catalyst mass), and the cycle stability of the battery has been improved, which is stable for 85 cycles.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6				2079-4991		WOS:000657024000001	33922335

However, the lack of effective methods for OVs implantation currently hampers the rational design of highly-active CO2 reduction catalysts. Herein, we reported a novel non-equilibrium photochemical strategy for preparing OV-rich Co3O4 at ambient temperature and pressure. Results confirm that the single isolated OV and Co-OV associates are the predominant defect types within Co3O4 skeleton. Moreover, the OVs concentration in Co3O4 can be tuned over a wide range by merely controlling the light-irradiation time. The experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the OVs can promote the adsorption/activation of CO2 and water, while considerably lowering the free energy barrier for COOH* formation, thereby accelerating the reaction kinetics. The OV-rich Co3O4 displays a 26.7-fold improvement in CO2 reduction activity over the OV-poor Co3O4. The turnover frequency of Co atoms in OV-rich Co3O4 reaches 3.754 s(-1), which is one of the best reported catalysts for CO2 photoreduction to date. Moreover, we also successfully synthesize a series of defect-rich metal oxides and metal sulfides using this photochemical method, such as TiO2, Fe2O3, CuO, Mn3O4, CeO2, V2O5, MoO3, ZrO2, Bi2O3, MoS2, MnS, CdS, NiS2-Ni3S4 and Bi2S3-BiS2, which suggests its universality. We believe this photochemical method developed herein greatly enriches the knowledge for the synthesis of defective nanocrystals under mild synthesis conditions. Importantly, the relationship between the OVs and the CO2 reduction performance has been established by various characterizations, which may guide the design of highly-efficient catalysts for CO2 photofixation.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000702901800005

High surface wettability is a key factor to achieve enhanced efficiency in these catalytic applications. Here, we report a fast and environment friendly route to fabricate super hydrophilic CuO thin films using a low power (5-10 W) atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ). With APPJ treatment for 5 min, the CuO surface transforms from hydrophobic to super-hydrophilic with threefold increase in catalytic activity. The electrodes were extensively characterized using various bulk and surface-sensitive techniques. APPJ in-troduces anisotropy in the crystal structure and creates unique three-dimensional surface morphology with distinct surface chemical and electronic features. Interestingly, presence of oxygen in the plasma was found to be critical for the enhanced activities and the activity decreased when the functionalised with nitrogen plasma. Oxygen plasma functionalisation of CuO electrodes resulted in a 130 mV reduction in the onset potential for oxygen evolution reaction along with enhanced current density, 10 mA cm(-2) against 3 mA cm(-2) at 1 V vs Saturated Calomel Electrode in 0.1 M KOH without iR compensation. Importantly, without introducing any external dopants the work function could be decreased by 80 mV. Moreover, the treated films exhibited a higher rate of photo degradation (0.0283 min(-1) compared to 0.0139 min(-1)) of Methylene Blue and phenol indicating efficient charge separation. This work presents the potential of APPJ functionalisation of CuO surface to boost the activity of other thin film catalyst materials and solutions processed systems.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000674654600005

The multiplicity of roles for (bi)carbonate in photosystem II operation in the hypercarbonate-requiring cyanobacterium Arthrospira maxima								PHOTOSYNTHETICA				56	1			217	228		10.1007/s11099-018-0781-0				MAR 2018	2018	Arthrospira maxima is unique among cyanobacteria, growing at alkaline pH (< 11) in concentrated (bi)carbonate (1.2 M saturated) and lacking carbonic anhydrases. We investigated dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) roles within PSII of A. maxima cells oximetrically and fluorometrically, monitoring the light reactions on the donor and acceptor sides of PSII. We developed new methods for removing DIC based on a (bi)carbonate chelator and magnesium for (bi)carbonate ionpairing. We established relative affinities of three sites: the water-oxidizing complex (WOC), non-heme iron/Q(A) (-), and solvent-accessible arginines throughout PSII. Full reversibility is achieved but (bi)carbonate uptake requires light. DIC depletion at the non-heme iron site and solvent-accessible arginines greatly reduces the yield of O-2 due to O-2 uptake, but accelerates the PSII-WOC cycle, specifically the S2 -> S3 and S3 -> S0 transitions. DIC removal from the WOC site abolishes water oxidation and appears to influence free energy stabilization of the WOC from a site between CP43-R357 and Ca2+.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			0300-3604	1573-9058		WOS:000430309200020		
J	Park, JW; Pedraza, AJ; Allen, WR								Irradiation-induced decomposition of Al2O3 during Auger electron spectroscopy analysis								JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY A-VACUUM SURFACES AND FILMS				14	2			286	292		10.1116/1.579890				MAR-APR 1996	1996	The effect of electron fluence on the decomposition of sapphire (Al2O3) was studied in situ by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). The decomposition was primarily detected by monitoring the evolution of the low kinetic energy Auger transitions of aluminum in Al2O3 (54 eV) and in metallic aluminum (68 eV). The decomposition of sputter-cleaned sapphire started at a fluence of similar to 4.9 x 10(19) electrons/cm(2) (7.8 C/cm(2)). This fluence was independent of the electron fluxes used in this work, except the lowest, which indicates that heating due to electron bombardment does not significantly affect the decomposition behavior. Electron-induced decomposition takes place in a minimum of the first five atomic layers of the substrate, as revealed by the evolution during irradiation of the high energy Al peaks associated with Al2O3 (1388 eV) and metallic aluminum (1396 eV). Comparison of the evolution of low and high kinetic energy Auger transitions demonstrates that the decomposition kinetics are much faster for the first monolayer than for the subjacent atomic layers. The surface condition strongly influences the decomposition kinetics. Thus, a carbon layer adsorbed at the alumina surface significantly increases the threshold dose for decomposition. The carbon layer most probably acts as a diffusion barrier for the oxygen produced during decomposition. An equation for the decomposition rate of the first monolayer of alumina is established. The integral of this equation gives a good fitting to the experimental data. It is found that the Auger signal of aluminum from sapphire does not disappear even if the entire region has been decomposed. This effect is due to backscattered electrons that promote Auger electron excitations outside the irradiated region.

The results showed that there was not significant change of DO content in water of the bay. All of the cruises showed that DO content was within the range of the first class to the marine water quality standard. The highest was in winter, a little lower in spring, and the lowest in summer and autumn, and it was consistent with the variation of O_2%. Due to the positive and negative effects of phytoplankton on the environmental change, the relation between DO and environmental factors is complicated. The temperature - salinity function of DO was a strong positive correlation with water temperature and a strong negative correlation with salinity, but the correlations with pH, COD, phytoplankton (or chl.a), N, P, and Si showed an evolution with the age. On the other hand, the changes of O_2% are different with DO. As a whole, the enrichment oxygen effect of phytoplankton has played a leading role in the sustainable development of ecological environment in the bay.			通过对钦州湾1983～2003年10个航次调查资料的分析,探讨了该湾溶解氧的含量变化及其在生态环境可持续发展中的作用.结果表明:20~a来该湾水体中的DO含量变化并不大,所有航次均在一类海水标准范围内,以冬季最高、春季次之、夏秋季较低的特征出现;O_2%的变化与DO相一致.但由于浮游植物在海湾生态环境的演变过程中扮演了正、反两方面的角色,从而使DO与环境因子之间的关系趋于复杂,作为温盐函数的DO,与水温之间却多以显著正相关出现,与盐度则多以显著负相关出现,与pH、COD、浮游植物(或chl.a)和N、P、Si的相关性,却体现了时代变迁的特征;O_2%的相关变化与DO不尽一致.但总的说来,浮游植物的增氧作用在海湾生态环境可持续发展的进程中起到了主导影响作用.						0	3	0		0	0	3			1007-6336			CSCD:3589329		
J	Wang, Ruiling; Kuwahara, Yasutaka; Mori, Kohsuke; Bu, Yuyu; Yamashita, Hiromi								Tunable surface modification of a hematite photoanode by a Co(salen)-based cocatalyst for boosting photoelectrochemical performance								CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				10	6			1714	1723		10.1039/c9cy02481f				MAR 21 2020	2020	In this work, a water splitting photoanode composed of hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) nanorods was modified with a Co(salen)-based cocatalyst, which was proven to exhibit special photoelectrochemical (PEC) oxygen evolution activity. Co(salen) was deposited on the surface of the alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode as a precursor of the cocatalyst and then heat-treated at different temperatures. When the annealing temperature is 250 degrees C, Co(salen) transforms into Co3+ species stabilized with C-N ligands, which act as active sites and decrease the OER energy barrier for the photoelectrochemical process of the alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode. Meanwhile, the interaction between Co-C-N and Fe (Co-C-NMIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSISFe) via van der Waals force can provide a photocarrier transfer pathway to achieve a 1.7 fold higher photocurrent at 1.23 V vs. RHE and 180 mV onset potential negative shift compared to those of the pure alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode. This work demonstrates a unique surface structure of a cocatalyst created by a post synthetic strategy using a metal complex precursor containing organic ligands.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000526708900012

Herein, the occupancy ratio of two different Na sites (sites below transition metal ions and sites below oxygen ions along the c direction) in P2-Na-0.67[Mn0.66Ni0.33]O-2 cathode is tuned successfully by inducing Sb5+ ions with strong repulsion toward Na sites right below transition metals. It is found that the decrease of Na occupancy right below transition metal ions is beneficial to the electrochemical performance of P2-layered cathode materials, regarding cycle stability and rate capability. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals that the reversible Mn3.3+/Mn4+ and Ni2+/Ni3+ redox couples provide charge compensation in different voltage regions of 1.8-2.3 and 2.3-4.2 V, respectively. The transmission X-ray microscopy confirms the uniform redox reaction over the whole electrode particle. In addition, Sb substitution can suppress the "P2-O2" phase transition in high voltage region by preventing oxygen gliding in a-b planes, thus ensuring robust structure stability during cycling.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000620996500001

Surface modification with an OER cocatalyst can reduce electron-hole recombination and thus improve the PEC OER performance of CuWO4. Herein, we coupled CuWO(4)nanoflakes (NFs) with Iridium-cobalt phosphates (IrCo-Pi) and greatly improved the photoactivity of CuWO4. The optimized photocurrent density for CuWO4/IrCo-Pi at 1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) rose to 0.54 mA center dot cm(-2), a ca. 70% increase over that of bare CuWO4(0.32 mA center dot cm(-2)). Such improved photoactivity was attributed to the enhanced hole collection efficiency, which resulted from the reduced charge-transfer resistance via IrCo-Pi modification. Moreover, the as-deposited IrCo-Pi layer well coated the inner CuWO(4)NFs and effectively prevented the photoinduced corrosion of CuWO(4)in neutral potassium phosphate (KPi) buffer solution, eventually leading to a superior stability over the bare CuWO4. The facile preparation of IrCo-Pi and its great improvement in the photoactivity make it possible to design an efficient CuWO4/cocatalyst system towards PEC water oxidation.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2073-4344		WOS:000564878100001		
J	VIXGUTERL, C; EHRBURGER, P								THERMAL-STABILITY OF SILICON-CARBIDE FIBERS								SILICATES INDUSTRIELS				60	9-10			251	255						SEP-OCT 1995	1995	The aim of this work is to study the chemical evolution of the surface of the SiC-based fibres after treatments at various conditions. The fibres used were Nicalon fibres with the following molar composition: 47% SiC, 20% SiOxCy (with x = 1,1, y = 0,45) and 33%C. They are surrounded by a thin silica layer. The SiC-based fibres are treated at 1000 degrees C, 1200 degrees C and 1300 degrees C either in vacuum or under an argon flow at atmospheric pressure. The changes of the superficial composition of the fibres induced by the treatments are determined by measuring the fibre reactivity in oxygen (1kPa) at 900 degrees C. Reactivity tests were carried out by a volumetric method including mass spectrometry for the analysis of the gaseous species. The fibre surface were also examinated by XPS. The experimental results indicate a more important degradation of the fibres in vacuum than in argon; In particular, the treatment in vacuum leads to the disappearance of the carbon layer present at the fibre surface and to the formation of a silica network deficient in oxygen. At the contrary, the treatment of the fibre in argon is essentially characterized by the formation of a silica layer. The surfaces changes are related to the degradation of the SiOxCy continuum and to chemical reactions between the different constituants of the fibre.					3rd Colloquium on Ceramic - Ceramic Composites3rd Colloquium on Ceramic - Ceramic Composites	OCT, 1994OCT, 1994		MONS, BELGIUMMONS, BELGIUM	0	0	0		0	0	0			0037-5225			WOS:A1995TJ50700003

A low-temperature and normal operating pressure are the main advantages of these processes, but a limited energy efficiency and little selectivity control hinder their practical implementation. In this work, we propose the use of isotope labelling to retrieve information about the intermediate reactions that may intervene during the DBD processes contributing to a decrease in their energy efficiency. The results are shown for the wet reforming reaction of methane, using D2O instead of H2O as reactant, and for the ammonia synthesis, using NH3/D-2/N-2 mixtures. In the two cases, it was found that a significant amount of outlet gas molecules, either reactants or products, have deuterium in their structure (e.g., HD for hydrogen, CDxHy for methane, or NDxHy for ammonia). From the analysis of the evolution of the labelled molecules as a function of power, useful information has been obtained about the exchange events of H by D atoms (or vice versa) between the plasma intermediate species. An evaluation of the number of these events revealed a significant progression with the plasma power, a tendency that is recognized to be detrimental for the energy efficiency of reactant to product transformation. The labelling technique is proposed as a useful approach for the analysis of plasma reaction mechanisms.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				2073-4344		WOS:000459732000045

The model includes substrate, oxygen, and biomass concentrations. The reaction equations are solved using a predictor corrector algorithm with adaptive time stepping and adjustment of time step size near the inflow boundary. The method is benchmarked against the direct ELLAM solution of Wang et al. (1995) for the test problem of Celia et al. (1989). The split operator approach is shown to be competitive with the direct solution for simple test problems and is expected to have better performance for more complex multi-component systems.Nonlinear regression using a shuffled complex evolution algorithm is then used to fit the transport and biodegradation model to column experiment data. A Metropolis algorithm is used for uncertainty analysis. These inverse methods were employed in a case study of aniline substrate depletion data from laboratory scale column experiments using pristine aquifer material from CFB Borden, Ontario as a microbial population source under aerobic conditions. Results show that the transport and biodegradation model parameters were uniquely identified when fitted to the aniline and oxygen concentration data from the column experiment.					14th International Conference on Computational Methods in Water Resources14th International Conference on Computational Methods in Water Resources	JUN 23-28, 2002JUN 23-28, 2002		DELFT, NETHERLANDSDELFT, NETHERLANDS	1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0167-5648		0-444-50975-5	WOS:000178839400090

The aglycone landomycinone is the distinctive core, while the oligosaccharide chain differs within derivatives. Herein, we report that landomycins spontaneously form Michael adducts with biothiols, including reduced cysteine and glutathione, both cell-free or intracellularly involving the benz[a]anthraquinone moiety of landomycinone. While landomycins generally do not display emissive properties, the respective Michael adducts exerted intense blue fluorescence in a glycosidic chain-dependent manner. This allowed label-free tracking of the short-lived nature of the mono-SH-adduct followed by oxygen-dependent evolution with addition of another SH-group. Accordingly, hypoxia distinctly stabilized the fluorescent mono-adduct. While extracellular adduct formation completely blocked the cytotoxic activity of landomycins, intracellularly it led to massively decreased reduced glutathione levels. Accordingly, landomycin E strongly synergized with glutathione-depleting agents like menadione but exerted reduced activity under hypoxia. Summarizing, landomycins represent natural glutathione-depleting agents and fluorescence probes for intracellular anthraquinone-based angucycline metabolism.Landomycins are promising anti-cancer agents with the potential to bypass common resistance pathways, but their mechanism of action remains incompletely understood. Here a mechanism is proposed involving intracellular sequential thiol-Michael and oxidation reactions, which depletes endogenous thiols and induces reactive oxygen species formation.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2399-3669			WOS:000722611000001

Herein, the dynamic evolutions of surface atomic and electronic structures on ultrathin BiOCl photocatalysts were firstly explored by combining synchronous-illumination X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SI-XPS) with X-ray diffraction (SI-XRD). The related results clearly reveal that the exposed {001} facets of ultrathin BiOCl are terminated with chlorine atoms instead of generally considered oxygen atoms. Under steady states, the outward migration of chlorine atoms on BiOCl (001) surfaces resulted in the formation of Bi, Cl, and O atoms with multiple-valence states and length decrease of Cl-O and Bi-O bond within the lattice phase. Under excitation states, the surface chlorine atoms return back to the lattice phase, leading to the elongation of Bi-Cl and Bi-O bonds and the valence-state normalization of Bi, Cl, and O atoms. Owing to these significant atomic- and electronic-structure changes, ultrathin BiOCl nanosheets exhibit the prominent activity enhancement (21.4 mu mol g (-1) h (-1)) for CO2 reduction to CO compare with bulk BiOCl (3.3 mu mol g (-1) h (-1)).									20	0	0	0	3	0	20			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000703891500006

We here present a facile methodology for the room temperature precipitation of cobalt hydroxide carbonate under additive-free conditions. Upon aging in aqueous solution, the initially deposited amorphous bulk solid slowly transforms into macroscopic crystals with an unusual spherulitic morphology interfacially templated by glass surfaces. Most intriguingly, the individual branches of these hemispherical particles represent highly anisometric, elongated platelets reaching millimeter dimensions along the growth direction, while their lamellar architecture indicates the formation of a layered double hydroxide structure. Gradual substitution of Co(II) with Mn(II) results in the deposition of spheroidal stoichiometric carbonates with a calcite structure, in which the crystal lattice progressively expands with increasing Mn content. Replacement of Co(II) by Ni(II), in contrast, preserves the spherulite morphology at low Ni(II) content (Co/Ni > 1), but prevents precipitate maturation at higher proportions of Ni(II). Calcination converts the hydroxide carbonate precursor into hierarchical Co3O4 spherulites with superstructures composed of interconnected nanoparticles, where this nanoscale arrangement is shown to positively affect the electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1528-7483	1528-7505		WOS:000580511100017

There is no consensus in the increasingly abundant literature, especially relating to the epoxy groups as the main surface complexes in the basal plane, as well as the simultaneous presence of GO sheets and oxidative debris (OD), with a large difference in their oxygen content. In the present work we characterized the base-washed GO (bwGO) sheets, the OD and the humic fraction of the OD obtained by base digestion, when the parent GO was dispersed by applying sonication, a routine procedure when starting from dried graphite oxide. When sonication is not applied, the amount of OD detected is considerably lower, indicative of its formation before base digestion. The presence of lactols and carboxylic anhydrides as the dominant surface complexes at graphene edges is consistent with all the characterization results, as well as with the general knowledge of surface chemistry of carbon materials ranging from coal to graphite. These findings suggest that the Hummers-Offeman reaction produces a chemical scissor effect during the water/hydrogen peroxide quenching step, yielding a broad size distribution of GO sheets, with little in-plane oxidation and the vast majority of edges being oxidized to form oxepinone-type functionalities.

The introduction of cheap transition metals improves catalytic performance while significantly reducing the cost of the catalysts. Here, we report the synthesis of Pt3Co/NC alloy catalysts via coating and pyrolysis treatment. The agglomeration of nanoparticles during the high-temperature alloying process is significantly inhibited by coating with PANI. Remarkably, the obtained Pt3Co/NC alloy catalysts exhibit excellent ORR catalytic performance and structural stability in 0.1 mol/L HClO4. After 30,000 potential cycles, the mass activity and area-specific activity of Pt3Co/NC alloy catalysts are 1.949 and 3.936 times higher, respectively, than that of JM-Pt/C with negligible performance loss. The strong metal-support interaction between N and Pt and the Pt-rich surface restrict the dissolution of Pt and Co, resulting in excellent stability. This synthesis approach provides an effective way to develop active and stable Pt alloy catalysts. (c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, the influence of MOF type on the structure and further ORR activity of derived metal-free carbon catalysts is still elusive. In the present work, a series of different Zn-based MOFs were employed as precursors to explore this issue. Meanwhile, prepare N-doped metal-free carbon catalysts were prepared for the ORR under the activation of sacrificial urea (which is effective to enhance the ORR activity of carbon-based catalysts). By analyzing the intermediates during pyrolysis, it is found that the decisive role of MOF types on the doped N and the morphology of derived carbon catalysts was played by the Zn coordination environment of MOFs and its reactivity with the decomposition intermediate of urea. Although the structure and porosity of derived carbon catalysts from different MOFs are very different, they all showed superior ORR activity and Zn-air battery performance up to 20 wt% Pt/C benchmark catalysts. From the above analyses, the combination of urea and compounded Zn is also a promising activation method for the preparation of highly-efficient metal-free carbon electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000822865100001	35816017

Developing noble-metal free and robust electrocatalysts are of great importance for the eco-friendly upgrading of biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to produce FDCA. Herein we demonstrated a facile one-step hydrothermal method to grow tungsten trioxide (WO3) nanorods on Ni foam, which was efficient for the electrochemical oxidation of HMF to FDCA. The 3D porous WO3/Ni electrode was controllably synthesized at low temperature with the aid of polyethylene glycol (PEG) template. Three types of electrodes were investigated and the catalytic results showed excellent electrochemical performance with the high electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) up to 40.0 cm(2), 99.4 % HMF conversion rate, 88.3 % FDCA yield and 88.0 % Faradaic efficiency in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte under ambient conditions, avoiding the traditionally harsh environment (e.g. extra oxygen sources, high temperature and pressure). Besides, the product distribution, reaction kinetics and mechanisms were also investigated. This work provides an alternative and efficient way of electrocatalytic processing of biomass-derived monomers using noble-metal free catalysts under ambient conditions.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			2468-8231			WOS:000632674700002

Specifically, the TNTs interlayer was fabricated by anodic oxidation on pure Ti plate, followed by heat-treatment (450 degrees C) to transform its amorphous structure to anatase structure. This TNTs interlayer not only has a good protection for Ti substrate, but also has a low resistance. The resultant RuO2-TiO2 electrode presents superior performance toward chlorine evolution reaction (ClER) and longer service lifetime (132 h) than that without interlayer (59 h). Experimental results show that anodizing time determines the length of TiO2 nanotubes and brings about different catalytic activity and stability. The RuO2-TiO2/TNTs/Ti electrode with an optimal RuO2-TiO2 coating (4.5 g m(-2)) presents a better spatial structure, homogeneous crystal particles, uniformly distribution and more active sites. However, high calcination temperature (>600 degrees C) has a detrimental impact, i. e. the collapse of TNTs and a "cracked mud" structure, which provide a path for oxygen and electrolyte to penetrate into the substrate and cause the spalling of coating, eventually lead to a serious decline in electrocatalytic activity and stability.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2365-6549			WOS:000488160100052

Herein, we first compare three amorphous metal-borates (M-Bi, M = Ni, Co, Mn) as low-cost electrocatalysts, among which Mn-Bi is proposed for the first time for fabrication of new PEC devices for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations compared the catalytic activity of the effective structures in M-Bi and found that NiO6 possesses kinetically the lowest overall OER energy barrier. Experimentally, M-Bi thin layers were self-assembled on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) linked ZnO nanorod arrays respectively, to form a highly efficient ternary PEC system (M-Bi/rGO/ZnO) using a modified photodeposition method. rGO facilitates the fast charge separation in light-absorbing ZnO NAs, while M-Bi (M = Ni, Co, Mn) can improve the kinetics of OER. In accordance with DFT results, Ni-Bi serves as the most active electrocatalyst in such a PEC device, followed by Co-Bi and Mn-Bi. Compared to ZnO, the photoelectroconversion efficiency is elevated by approximately 4 times on Ni-Bi/rGO/ZnO, with its onset potential migrated by 0.17 V in the cathodic direction under one sun illumination.									26	2	0	0	3	0	26			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000452482900020

The as-obtained products were systematically characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), photoluminescence (PL), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), respectively. The results indicate that the products consist of hierarchically nanostructured bundles assembled with smaller nanotube subunits. Meanwhile, the photoluminescence spectra demonstrate that the obtained products contain more oxygen vacancies compared with the reported WO3 materials. The morphologies of the products are found to be strongly dependent on the reaction time and the EG/H2O volume ratio, uniform WO3 nanotube bundles can be fabricated readily just via tuning the volume ratio of EG and H2O. Through a series of time-dependent morphological evolution studies, the growth process of WO3 nanostructures has been investigated, and the corresponding growth mechanism is discussed in detail as well. Additionally, the gas-sensing performances of uniform WO3 nanotube bundles were investigated for 100 ppm of ethanol. It was found that the WO3 nanotube bundles sensor displayed significantly better sensing performance than many reported WO3 materials due to more electron donor related oxygen vacancies.									46	1	0	0	1	0	47			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000326984000059

Improving the activity and 4e(-) selectivity of the ORR is required for the practical applications of these technologies. We herein report the Co corrole 1 with an appended N,N-di(2-picolyl)ethylenediamine (DPEN) unit and its electrocatalytic 4e(-) ORR in different pH aqueous solutions. The appended DPEN of Co corrole 1 has two pyridyl groups and one tertiary amine unit, which are expected to be partially protonated in aqueous solutions of pH <= 7. This will convert DPEN to an intramolecular group functioning as multiple positively charged and proton relay sites. Importantly, 1 is more active and selective than Co tris(pentafluorophenyl)corrole 2, the DPEN-free analogue of 1, for the electrocatalytic 4e(-) ORR in pH <= 7 aqueous solutions, whereas 1 and 2 display similar activities and selectivities for the ORR in basic solutions. These results confirmed our catalyst design strategy by using protonated multiple pyridyl and amine groups as positively charged proton relay sites to improve the activity and 4e(-) selectivity of the ORR. Therefore, this work is significant because it shows the benefit of using molecular catalysts for studying structure-function relationships and to underline the potential applications of molecular electrocatalysis.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000726699600005

They represent an important class of materials ranging from single-atom catalysts (SACs) and nanoparticles (NPs). While SACs and NPs have been extensively reported, catalysts featuring a few atoms with well-defined structures are poorly studied. The difficulty in synthesizing such structures has been a critical challenge. Here we report a facile photochemical method that produces catalytic centers consisting of two Ir metal cations, bridged by O and stably bound to a support. Direct evidence unambiguously supporting the dinuclear nature of the catalysts anchored on alpha-Fe2O3 is obtained by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM). Experimental and computational results further reveal that the threefold hollow binding sites on the OH-terminated surface of alpha-Fe2O3 anchor the catalysts to provide outstanding stability against detachment or aggregation. The resulting catalysts exhibit high activities toward H2O photooxidation.									137	5	0	0	14	0	135			0027-8424			WOS:000427829500044	29507243

The samples were synthesized by microwave assisted procedures and by hydrothermal deposition procedure. Differences in the catalyst structural properties of the prepared catalysts were detected by XRD, TPR and XPS measurement. When tested at atmospheric pressure with feed gas mixture containing methane and oxygen in molecular ratio CH4/O-2 = 2, all the samples reached 98% conversion with CO selectivity values >95% in the 700-800 degrees C temperature range. The samples exhibited different behavior towards carbon formation during the tests. Moreover, according to XRD, XPS and TGA results, when the carbon was formed it did not cause catalyst deactivation. TPR profiles confirmed different degree of chemical interaction between NiO and CeO2 support, depending on the preparation method. The building up or the easy removal of carbon during the CH4 temperature programmed surface reaction (TPSR), substantiate the role of the CeO2 lattice oxygen mobility, enhanced by metal-support interaction, in the removal of the deposited carbon through CO evolution. Structure-activity relationship established a close dependence of the CPO performance on the combination of NiO and CeO2 crystallite sizes and the interaction between the two. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Recent opacity computations of OPAL along with a new hydrodynamical mixing process have been considered. We also introduce up-to-date nuclear reaction rates and explore the impact of accretion, mixing length parameter, nonsolar distributions among metals, and realistic rotation history. Models predict lithium depletion that we compare to the Li-7 content observations of the Sun and four young clusters of different metallicities and age. We show that we can distinguish two phases in lithium depletion : (1) a rapid nuclear destruction in the T Tauri phase before 20 Myr whatever the mass in our range and largely dependent on the extension and temperature of the convective zone, and (2) a second phase where the destruction is slow and moderate and which is largely dependent on the (magneto)hydrodynamic instability located at the base of the convective zone. Regarding composition we show the interest that takes on helium and above all the mixture of heavy elements : carbon, oxygen, silicium, and iron. We outline the importance of the O/Fe ratio. We note a reasonable agreement on lithium depletion for the two best-known cases, the Sun and the Hyades, for solar-like stars. Other clusters suggest that processes which may partly inhibit the predicted pre-main-sequence depletion cannot be excluded, in particular for stars below similar to0.9 M. We finally propose different research areas such as initial stellar models and more realistic atmospheres which could contribute to understanding better this early phase of evolution and which will be the object of subsequent works.									97	2	0	0	0	0	98			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000173766700040

However, the facile synthesis of DSAs uniformly located on nitrogen porous carbon materials is still challenging. Herein, Fe and Ni dual-metal single-atomic active sites uniformly located on nitrogen doped porous carbon polyhedrals (FeNi-DSAs-PNCH) are successfully prepared by a facile and rapid microwave-assisted adsorption and subsequent pyrolysis process with free template and free metal ligand. The FeNi-DSAs-PNCH catalyst exhibits boosted ORR activity and long time stability. Experimental investigations and density functional theory calculation results verify that, besides the hierarchical porous structure, large specific surface area and abundant catalytic active sites, the adjacent NiNx atomic sites can modulate the d-band center of Fe-Nx single atomic active centers and balance the adsorption-desorption affinities to O-2 molecules and oxygen-containing intermediates on Fe-Nx, thus leading to an superior ORR activity with a more positive half-wave potential (0.89 V vs. RHE) than the single Fe or Ni atomic catalyst and the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, with FeNi-DSAs-PNCH as the air cathode and zinc foil as the anode, an assembled Zn-air battery exhibits a higher open-circuit voltage of 1.48 V and a larger specific capacity of 802.18 mAh g(-1) than that of the Pt/C-based Zn-air battery (1.37 V and 664.78 mAh g(-1), respectively). This work develops a convenient strategy for preparing dual-metal single-atomic cataysts as promising substitutes for the commercial Pt/C catalysts in the practical energy conversion applications, and also offers experimental and theoretical guidance for rational designing and improvement of ORR and other catalysts by tailoring the d-band center of the active sites.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000779582200005

To assist the coordination of -OH- ligands with the metal center and also to weaken the M3+-OH bonding, which is desirable to enhance the OER behavior, tin (Sn) has been incorporated to form Sn entrapped iron hydroxyphosphate, otherwise known as Sn incorporated FeHP (Sn-FeHP) which is another new electrocatalyst, which has been identified and characterised in the current study. Symmetrical nanocrystals of FeHP and Sn-FeHP were prepared using a simple hydrothermal method with appropriate metal precursors at 220 degrees C for 48 h. Interestingly, the incorporated Sn does not lead to any change in the orthorhombic crystal structure of pristine FeHP. However, the effect of the added Sn is found to be reflected in the morphology by way of forming self-assembled needle-like crystals to ultimately form a star-like architecture. The ability of these nanocrystals to perform in electrocatalytic water oxidation in alkaline conditions as anode for the OER was studied in comparison with the state-of-art ruthenium(IV) oxide (RuO2) and with the best performing alkaline OER catalyst from 3d VIII group metals, i.e., nickel(II) hydroxide [Ni(OH)(2)]. The results of the OER study suggest that the currently synthesized Sn-FeHP possesses better catalytic ability than that of pristine FeHP. The overpotential (eta) required to achieve the benchmarking current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is 359 mV for Sn-FeHP and 442 mV for FeHP. Similarly, the Tafel slope of Sn-FeHP and FeHP is 81 and 91 mV dec(-1), respectively, suggesting that the Sn-FeHP explored in this research is a better electrocatalyst for OER. The enhanced activity of Sn-FeHP compared to that of Fe-HP may be correlated to the morphology-based advantages and the effect of added Sn in altering the electronic structure of FeHP, which in turn favors the OER kinetics. The stability of the Sn-FeHP modified working electrode was supported by the constant i-t performance for more than 800 min at 1.65 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Thus, Sn-FeHP could be considered as an efficient, cheaper and alternative futuristic anode material in comparison to the expensive nickel-based electro-catalysts, exploited commonly in water electrolysers.									22	3	0	0	1	0	23			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000414041700023

Increasing demands for ammonia have necessitated the development of alternative synthesis approaches as the backup technology to the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process. Among others, the electrosynthesis of ammonia (ESA) technology offers a promising approach to produce NH3 via a cathodic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). However, current ESA technologies desperately suffer from insufficient production rates (<10(-6) mol h(-1) cm(-1)) and low Faradaic efficiency (<30%) due to the lack of highly active and selective NRR catalysts and favorable electrolytes to suppress competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. This review provides an insight into the ESA technology with an emphasis on the design of catalyst/electrolyte systems that optimizes the production of NH3 from N-2 and H2O under ambient conditions. Basic electrochemical principles and reaction mechanisms of the NRR are briefly analyzed in the first section, followed by the impacts of electrochemical components (e.g., catalysts and electrolytes) that define the effectiveness of EAS technologies. The challenges that limited the developments and the approaches that researchers have focused on the catalyst developments are discussed in detail with the main emphasis on the combined catalyst/electrolyte systems. Finally, NRR performance evaluation methods, along with economic analysis of the EAS, are critically examined.									75	6	0	0	2	0	76			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000513814400020

The ORR (O-2 + 4e(-) + 4H(+) -> 2H(2)O) involves up to nine substrates and thus requires navigating a complicated reaction landscape, typically with several high-energy intermediates. Many catalysts can perform this reaction, though few operate with fast rates and at low overpotentials (close to the thermodynamic potential). Attempts to optimize these parameters, both in homogeneous and heterogeneous electrocatalytic systems, have focused on modifying catalyst design and understanding kinetic/thermodynamic relationships between catalytic intermediates. One such method for analyzing and predicting catalyst reactivity and efficiency has been the development of "molecular scaling relationships". Here, we share our experience deriving and utilizing molecular scaling relationships for soluble, iron-porphyrin-catalyzed O-2 reduction in organic solvents. These relationships correlate turnover frequencies (TOFmax) and effective overpotentials (eta(eff)), properties uniquely defined for homogeneous catalysts. Following a general introduction of scaling relationships for both homogeneous and heterogeneous electrocatalysis, we describe the components of such scaling relationships: (i) the overall thermochemistry of the reaction and (ii) the rate and rate law of the catalyzed reaction. We then show how connecting these thermodynamic and kinetic parameters reveals multiple molecular scaling relationships for iron-porphyrin-catalyzed O-2 reduction. For example, the log(TOFmax) responds steeply to changes in eta(eff) that result from different catalyst reduction potentials (18.5 decades in TOFmax/V in eta(eff)) but much less dramatically to changes in eta(eff) that arise from varying the pK(a) of the acid buffer (5.1 decades in TOFmax/V in eta(eff)). Thus, a single scaling relationship is not always sufficient for describing molecular electrocatalysis. This is particularly evident when the catalyst identity and reaction conditions are coupled. Using these multiple scaling relationships, we demonstrate that the metrics of turnover frequency and effective overpotential can be predictably tuned to achieve faster rates at lowered overpotentials. This Account uses a collection of related stories describing our research on soluble iron-porphyrin-catalyzed ORR to show how molecular scaling relationships can be derived and used for any electrocatalytic reaction. Such scaling relationships are powerful tools that connect the thermochemistry, mechanism, and rate law for a catalytic system. We hope that this collection shows the utility and simplicity of the molecular scaling approach for understanding catalysis, for enabling direct comparisons between catalyst systems, and for optimizing catalytic processes.									40	0	0	0	4	0	40			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000537147700008	32281786

In this paper, the lignite CLC and hematite used as an oxygen carrier (OC) were investigated. The thermodynamic behavior of NH3/HCN (NOx precursors) and Fe2O3 (the main component of hematite) were analyzed. Under different OC masses, the release characteristics of NH3 and HCN with temperature were studied using TG-MS. Using a fixed bed reactor, the nitrogen trade-off in the fuel reactor was investigated as a function of OC mass, changing reaction temperature, carrier gas flow rate, and type of OC (modified by K/Na/Ca/Ni/Cu/ Mn). Increasing the OC to lignite mass ratio led to a decrease of NH3 and HCN release. The release of HCN increased with the increasing temperature, while NH3 release decreased. An increased gas flow rate increased the emission of NH3 and HCN. Additionally, modifying the OC with Ni and Cu improved the oxidation performance and significantly reduced the emission of NH3 and HCN. To sum up, NH3 and HCN emission were lowest when the OC mass, temperature, and carrier gas flow rate were 10 g, 900 C, and 50 mL/min, respectively, and OC-Ni or OC-Cu was the OC.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-3820	1873-7188		WOS:000804025500003

Here, the core-shell-structured Ni@Co nanoislands were electrodeposited onto the surface of n-type Si photoanode to construct a metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) structure. We discover that the high-quality interface in Si/SiOx/Ni MIS structure is more efficient for charge extraction and transfer than Si/SiOx/Co. Owing to a slightly higher work function for Co (5.0 eV) than Ni (4.6 eV), the Si/SiOx/Ni@Co exhibits the larger band bending to enhance the charge separation efficiency, while the in-situ formed CoOOH significantly increases the charge injection efficiency due to the decreased oxygen-evolution overpotentials. As a result, the Ni@Co core-shell nanoparticles coupling with n-Si photoanode can afford the PEC performance with an onset potential of 1.02 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), saturated current density of 36.7 mA cm(-2), and retain good stability in K-borate buffer solution. This core-shell structure strategy is efficient and easy to achieve the separation of photogenerated carriers and improve the charge injection efficiency to nearly 100 %									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000449951500033

Here, we report the synthesis of novel cobalt-copper layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets via a simple co-precipitation method under Ar gas. The resulting CoCu LDH nanosheets, possessing an average thickness of 4.3 nm and a high surface area of 163 m(2) g(-1), have been applied as bifunctional catalysts for Li-air battery. In the simulated air environment, Li-air batteries with Co-Cu LDH nanosheets demonstrate higher discharge capacity of 4870 mAh g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1), lower charge overpotential and better cycling stability with controlling capacity of 1000 mAh g(-1), which is much better than that with CuCo2O4 electrode. The enhanced electrochemical performance is ascribed to the large interface between electrolytes and catalysts resulting from high surface area of Co-Cu LDH, providing plenty of actives sites to promote the formation/decomposition of Li2O2. The unique ultrathin nanosheet structure of Co-Cu LDH can also facilitate the mass transportation of O-2 and ions in Li-air battery. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

These measurements give information about potassium-calcium phosphate glasses related vibration modes and the nature of the bond between P, K, and Ca ions and surrounding oxygen atoms within the glass network. Thermal analysis DTA and GTA were also made to study behavior under different temperature regimes and to see chemical changes with time and temperature of these glasses. The evolution of the absorption bands, with the increasing of K2O, shows the significant distortions of the phosphate groups. Beginning with x = 35 mol% in Raman spectra appear new bands and the existing one disappear. But from Raman spectra we can see that the increasing of potassium oxide content leads to the appearance of gradually depolymerization process of the calcium phosphate network.									5	0	0	0	0	1	6			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000294064900032

However, poor oxygen reduction (ORR)/oxygen evolution (OER) kinetics involving Li2O2 formation/decomposition is a major obstacle to its development. By designing suitable cathode with desired structure and surface electronic states, the formation/morphology of Li2O2 and the reaction kinetics of charge process can be efficiently optimized simultaneously. In this work, a novel sulfur (S) and chlorine (Cl) co-doped porous carbon (CSC) were synthesized by one-step pyrolysis strategy, and the amount of heterogeneous atoms could be flexibly controlled by different calcination temperatures. Experimental combined with theoretical calculations show that the content of C-Cl bond plays an important role in the adsorption of intermediate LiO2, thus regulating the morphology of Li2O2 and ultimately affecting the release of battery energy. The C-S bond mainly acts on the dynamics of the ORR and OER processes, which has an important influence on improving the round-trip efficiency of the battery. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of heteroatoms, the electrochemical performances of the Li-O-2 battery, including round-trip efficiency, discharge capacity and cycling stability are greatly improved.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000872022700003

Witha small-pore size of similar to 16.7 nm and a high curvature, the 3D nanoporousgraphene is able to host/stabilize a high amount of N (5.88 at. %) and metal single atoms/clusters (Au, Pt, and Ir), which arein situ anchored on graphene during the removal of the nanoporous template. As a result, the obtained 3D graphene-basedcomposite exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activities toward both ORR and OER in both alkaline and acidic media.

To fulfill the increasing global demand for renewable and sustainable energy sources, significant research efforts have been devoted to the design and fabrication of well-defined hollow heterostructures with manipulated geometric morphology, modified surface and heterointerfaces, optimized electronic structure, and diverse composition in the past decade. Here, a comprehensive overview of the compositional and structural properties of hollow heterostructure, which provides a large surface area, void spaces, and multiple interfaces for electrolytes/reactants impregnation, reduced diffusion lengths for mass transport, as well as structural strength for suppressing agglomeration, is firstly presented. Thereafter, a brief classification of the design and construction of hollow heterotructures that derived from MOFs is also described, including template-induced assembly, dissolution-regeneration, selective chemical etching, etc. Subsequently, the niche applications of hollow heterotructures as electrode materials for oxygen- and hydrogen- involved energy conversion devices, and rechargeable batteries are particularly highlighted. Finally, the emerging challenges and further research directions of hollow heterotructures for electrochemical energy conversion and storage are also concluded. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Experiments have been conducted using the hydrothermal method at medium pressure (T = 200 degrees C, P = 20 atm) followed by a thermal treatment of the precursor at 700 degrees C (10 h).Structural and physico-chemical properties of the catalysts were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), BET sorption, temperature-programmed reduction or desorption, mass spectrometry (TPR-MS and TPD-MS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). While CHhyd and MWhyd powder catalysts exhibited the same XRD patterns indexed as pure perovskite structure, their surface physico-chemical properties were found to be strongly influenced by the preparation method. The effect of the nature of oxygen species, their amount and mobility, evidenced by temperature programmed experiments, on the catalytic properties in methane combustion in the presence and in the absence of hydrogen sulphide has been studied. MWhyd-La0.8Ag0.2MnO3+delta catalysts were found to exhibit a much better performance in methane combustion together with higher resistance to sulphur poisoning than CHhyd catalysts.									29	1	0	0	1	1	29			1631-0748	1878-1543		WOS:000252181700011

The oxidative production of furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) from bio-based 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) has attracted one of the most attention. Herein, spinel CuMn2O4 with an urchin-like nanostructure was synthesized by a hydrothermal method and subsequently soaked in ammonia water to create oxygen vacancies. The as-prepared material was used as an efficient electrocatalyst to oxidize HMF to FDCA. It was confirmed that CuMn2O4 etched with ammonia has an excellent electrocatalytic performance: at a current density of 20 mA/cm(2), the potential of HMF oxidation was 1.31 V vs RHE in 1.0 M KOH solution with 10 mM HMF prior to the takeoff of the competing reaction, O-2 evolution. Long-term chronoamperometry demonstrated that a 100% conversion of HMF and a 96% Faradaic efficiency of yield of FDCA were achieved. Our results indicated that it is feasible to employ the earth-abundant transition metal-based electrocatalyst CuMn2O4 to selectively oxidize biomass with higher energy conversion efficiency than water splitting as well as to produce valuable products in a H-type electrochemical cell.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2168-0485			WOS:000695384700017

The effect of PANI deposition time on the electrode performance was studied with methyl orange as the probing pollutant and the parameters of degradation experiment were investigated. The performance of Ti/PANI/PbO_2 electrodes for the degradation of rhodamine B and 4-nitrophenol was also studied. The results showed that the PANI deposited on the surface of the electrodes had no effect on the crystal structure and morphology of PbO_2, but can significantly improve the oxygen evolution potential of the electrode. The oxygen potential of Ti/PANI/PbO_2 can reach 3.43V (vs. SCE). When PANI deposition time was 30min, the modified electrode Ti/PANI-30/PbO_2 showed the best electrochemical and electro-catalytic degradation performance.

In nature, this reaction is efficiently catalyzed by photosystem II via cooperative catalytic centers and charge transporters. However, the integration of water oxidation catalysts and charge transporters in artificial systems remains challenging. In this report, a function-integrated water oxidation catalyst produced by the electrochemical polymerization of a cobalt phthalocyanine complex bearing carbazole moieties is described. The monomer complex, Co(czPc) (H(2)czPc=tetrakis(9H-carbazole-9-ethoxy)phthalocyanine), was synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, and Fourier transform infrared and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy measurements. The electrochemical polymerization of Co(czPc) was confirmed using cyclic voltammetry measurements and yielded poly-Co(czPc) on the surface of a glassy carbon electrode. Poly-Co(czPc) showed excellent charge-transport ability and superior electrocatalytic water oxidation performance to that of the corresponding nonpolymeric system.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2199-692X			WOS:000766397500001

These exceptional behaviors are mainly attributed to their combined properties. Herein, we have synthesized trimetallic zeolite imidazolate framework (ZIF) based fibrous material via a feasible wet chemical method followed by the reliable electro-spinning (ES) method. The successful implantation of metals into the organic frameworks was ensured initially and then subjected as the electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline medium. The newly developed material showed the lesser overpotential of 273 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) current density. The observed Tafel slope value and charge transfer resistance (R-ct) value were found to be lesser. In addition to that, the synthesized material possessed remarkable stability over 12 h. From the aforementioned values, there is a confirmation that the observed enhancement in the electrocatalytic activity was mainly associated with the morphology and the combined physicochemical properties.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1528-7483	1528-7505		WOS:000626321500046

Oxidation rates were likewise measured for fresh, demineralized, and Ca-loaded chars prepared from Beulah-Zap lignite coal in a flat flame burner at 1473 K. The oxidation rates of CaO-catalyzed Spherocarb and Zap char are the same within experimental error, suggesting that the high reactivity of the Zap char is due in large part to catalysis by CaO. It was also found that chlorine added to Ca-loaded char had a negligible effect on its low-temperature reactivity.									27	1	0	0	3	0	28			0887-0624			WOS:A1994NZ30300025

With appropriate electrocatalysts, such as silver-based and metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) materials, the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) allows for the production of CO alongside H-2 (from the hydrogen evolution reaction), and thus leads to syngas generation. In this Minireview, the application of M-N-C electrocatalysts for syngas generation is discussed. The mechanisms leading to different faradaic selectivities for CO are reviewed as a function of the nature of the metal, by using both computational and experimental approaches. The role played by the metal-free moieties in the M-N-C electrocatalysts is underlined. Since M-N-C electrocatalysts only recently entered the CO2RR field (as opposed to Cu-, Ag-, or Au-based nanostructures), they have been mainly characterized in static liquid environments, in which the reaction rate is significantly hampered by CO2-dissolution/diffusion limitations. Therefore, the design of CO2RR electrolyzers for M-N-C electrocatalysts is addressed, and designs such as zero-gap electrolyzers with anionic membranes and humidified CO2 gas feed at the cathode are highlighted.									26	1	0	0	0	0	27			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000520272700001	31961996

The catalysts have been characterized by H-2 chemisorption at room temperature (after different pre-treatments), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and temperature-programmed desorption of adsorbed hydrogen (H-2-TPD), and their catalytic behavior in the gas-phase hydrogenation of benzene has been determined under differential conditions. TPD profiles of oxygen surface groups in fresh catalysts evidenced the support oxidation by H2PtCl6, with the occurrence of a CO evolution peak at low temperature (630 K). The presence of oxygen surface groups in the support favors the anchoring of [Pt(NH3)(4)](2+), but does not affect the amount of platinum retained by the support when H2PtCl6 is used as metal precursor. TPR experiments have evidenced that the oxidized support hinders the reduction of the platinum precursor. The catalytic activities in the benzene hydrogenation reaction do not show a direct correlation with dispersion values obtained from hydrogen chemisorption, and it has been related to storage and mobility of hydrogen which is spilt over the support during the reduction treatments.

As supported by DFT calculations and experimental analysis, owing to the synergistic effect of oxygen defect and doping engineering, a tailored energy band structure alignment with higher redox potentials and larger Fermi level potential difference are achieved, resulting in more efficient S-scheme interface charge transfer and separation efficiency, thus improving the photocatalytic activity of O-ZnIn2S4/TiO2-x. The optimal O-ZnIn2S4/TiO2-x photocatalyst shows remarkable H-2 and benzaldehyde production rate of 2584.9 mu mol g(-1)h(-1) and 2880.5 mu mol g(-1)h(-1) under visible light, which are 52.5 and 66.4 times as high as those over blank TiO2. Interestingly, this coupled reaction system also displays superior H-2 evolution activity compared to sacrificial reagent systems of Na2SO3/Na2S and triethanolamine. Further quenching and EPR experiments reveal that both water and organic molecules provide protons for H-2 production.									12	0	0	0	2	0	12			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000727799900003		
J	Vankeerberghen, M; Gavrilov, S; Nelissen, G								Finite element calculation of the polarisation behaviour of a metal in an aqueous solution using the dilute solution model								CORROSION SCIENCE				43	1			37	51		10.1016/S0010-938X(00)00072-X				JAN 2001	2001	This article describes the calculation of the polarisation behaviour of a metal in an aqueous environment using a computational electrochemistry code based on finite elements. The corrosion system consisted of three parallel reactions (oxygen reduction, hydrogen evolution and metal dissolution), taking place in the centre at the surface of the rotating disc electrode (RDE). The selected problem is simple enough to be solved analytically, which allows verification of the finite element calculation. Simultaneously, the example is rich enough to demonstrate the potential and the advantages of finite element simulation for corrosion science and engineering. The analytical and finite element calculations were in excellent agreement. The influence of the speed of the RDE, of the bulk concentration of dissolved oxygen and of the bulk hydrogen ion concentration on the polarisation behaviour have been determined. The use of finite elements had the following specific advantages. Firstly, no prior assumption on the diffusion layer thickness had to be made. Secondly, transport by diffusion, convection and electro-migration were taken into account. Thirdly, the finite element approach is general and flexible enough to tackle more complex systems. The calculations presented here are a first step towards the finite element simulation of stress corrosion cracking of stainless steel in an aqueous nuclear environment.

From various analyses, it was found that, during pyrolysis at 900 degrees C under an N-2 atmosphere, the amorphous MoS2 precursor decomposed into Mo and S, facilitating the formation of graphene sheet-like carbon with MoC and doping of sulfur in the carbon. In the nanocomposite formed from 10 wt% MoS2 precursor (denoted as Mo/S/PC-10), most of the MoS2 was decomposed, thus forming S-doped carbon, which was grown on the MoC phase without crystalline MoS2. Furthermore, Mo/S/PC-10 exhibited better performance in the oxygen reduction reaction (specific activity of 1.23 mA cm(-2) at 0.9 V and half-wave potential of 0.864 V) than a commercial Pt catalyst, owing to a heteroatom-doped carbon nanostructure with a fairly high specific surface area. In the polarization curve of the unit-cell performance measured at 80 degrees C under ambient pressure, Mo/S/PC-10 as a cathode catalyst exhibited an optimal power density of 314 mW cm(-2) and a current density of 280 mA cm(-2) at 0.6 V.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000402122100012	28296248

Herein, Co is introduced into conductive Cu-catecholate (Cu-CAT) nanorod arrays directly grown on a flexible carbon cloth for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Electrochemical results show that the Co-incorporated Cu-CAT nanorod arrays only need 52 and 143 mV overpotentials to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline and neutral media for HER, respectively, much lower than most of the reported non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts and comparable to the benchmark Pt/C electrocatalyst. Density functional theory calculations show that the introduction of Co can optimize the adsorption energy of hydrogen (Delta G(H*)) of Cu sites, almost close to that of Pt (111). Furthermore, the adsorption energy of water (Delta EH2O) of Co sites in the CuCo-CAT is significantly lower than that of Cu sites upon coupling Cu with Co, effectively accelerating the Volmer step in the HER process. The findings, synergistic effect of bimetals, open a new avenue for the rational design of highly efficient MOF-based electrocatalysts.									29	0	0	0	1	0	29			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000705016300001	34623713

The results of UV spectroscopy obtained during galvanostatic electrolyses at the anode indicated the complete removal of the methylene blue dye. The high removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) suggested a high level of mineralization of its intermediates. It was found that the electrocatalytic performance of the electrode in the anodic degradation of the organic pollutant was significantly enhanced by the presence of chloride ions in the solution. The improvement in the degradation rate of MB was attributed to the in situ electrogeneration of chlorine active species. The results show that Ni0.6Co0.4-oxide anode can be employed as a stable energy-efficient electrocatalyst in the electrochemical purification of wastewater.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2073-4344		WOS:000676351600001

CO_2+O_2地浸采铀工艺是我国第三代铀矿采冶的代表性技术,研究CO_2+O_2溶浸过程中水动力场-化学场的耦合机制是模拟预测铀动态浸出过程的关键.本文以钱家店砂岩型铀矿床为研究对象,构建了适用于北方砂岩型铀矿CO_2+O_2溶浸过程的热力学数据库,并考虑在氧气O_2(aq)和重碳酸根HCO_3共同作用下的铀溶解动力学反应过程,基于TOUGHREACT模拟框架建立了CO_2+O_2地浸采铀的反应运移数值模型,模拟了地浸采铀过程中的水动力演化、溶浸液-岩石相互作用及铀矿浸出动力学过程.同时,基于参数敏感性分析定量比较了模型参数对浸铀效果影响的重要性程度.结果表明,模型能再现溶浸过程中抽注单元内流体动力演化和铀的动态浸出过程,参数敏感性分析结果揭示矿层中初始铀矿的体积分数(品位)及注入氧气的浓度是铀浸出浓度的主要控制因素.本研究可为开展采区尺度CO_2+O_2浸出过程的精准模拟和动态调控提供技术支撑.						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1674-7259			CSCD:7215937

Spontaneous reaction of Pd(0) with formic acid and oxygen is shown to result in the competing formation of (i) hydrogen peroxide (at low formic acid concentration in air; with optimum H2O2 yield at 2 mM HCOOH), (ii) water, or (iii) hydrogen (at higher formic acid concentration or under argon). Next, a spontaneous electroless gold deposition process is employed to attach gold (typically 10- to 35-nm diameter) to the nano-palladium in PIM-EA-TB to give an order of magnitude enhanced production of H2O2 with high yields even at higher HCOOH concentration (suppressing hydrogen evolution). Pd and Au work hand-in-hand as bipolar electrocatalysts. A Clark probe method is developed to assess the catalyst efficiency (based on competing oxygen removal and hydrogen production) and a mass spectrometry method is developed to monitor/optimise the rate of production of hydrogen peroxide. Heterogenised Pd/Au@PIM-EA-TB catalysts are effective and allow easy catalyst recovery and reuse for hydrogen peroxide production.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000705695700001

The finding of monophasic recombination kinetics requires that the proton equilibration of this group is faster than the recombination rate. The same group modulates the ext-ent of proton release, from 0 below pH 5 to 1 per center above pH 7, The kinetics of proton appearance and disappearance in the bulk medium are markedly dependent on the material used. In PSII core particles, the release is observed in the 100 mu s range and the uptake accompanies the recombination reaction, In PSII membranes, both of these reactions are markedly delayed, so that the uptake considerably lags behind the completion of the recombination reaction. An electrochromic shift of a chlorophyll is present during the whole lifetime of Y-Z(ox), suggesting a charged character of this species, A fast decreasing phase of this signal was observed in particles in the same time range as proton release, These results are discussed in the framework of a model where the proton originating from the formation of the neutral oxidized tyrosine radical (Y-Z*) remains locally trapped. In turn, this proton shifts the pK of a nearby group from a value greater than or equal to 9 to a value of 6.									62	1	2	0	44	0	64			0006-2960			WOS:A1997YL10500030	9398258

Metallic group-5 TMDs have been demonstrated to be effective catalysts for the HER in acidic media, making affordable real proton exchange membrane water electrolysers. Their key-plus relies on the fact that both their basal planes and edges are catalytically active for the HER. In this work, the 6R phase of TaS2 is "rediscovered" and engineered. A liquid-phase microwave treatment is used to modify the structural properties of the 6R-TaS2 nanoflakes produced by liquid-phase exfoliation. The fragmentation of the nanoflakes and their evolution from monocrystalline to partly polycrystalline structures improve the HER-activity, lowering the overpotential at cathodic current of 10 mA cm(-2) from 0.377 to 0.119 V. Furthermore, 6R-TaS2 nanoflakes act as ideal support to firmly trap Pt species, which achieve a mass activity (MA) up 10 000 A g(Pt)(-1) at overpotential of 50 mV (20 000 A g(Pt)(-1) at overpotentials of 72 mV), representing a 20-fold increase of the MA of Pt measured for the Pt/C reference, and approaching the state-of-the-art of the Pt mass activity.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000591337200001	33225597

In this study, we demonstrated the simultaneous hydrogen production and ibuprofen degradation through heterogeneous photocatalysis. By anchoring Au nanoparticles (NPs) on the (101) surface of sheaf-like TiO2 mesocrystals with [001] orientation, efficient charge separation is achieved, which is essential for the photocatalytic redox reactions. XPS analysis showed that the binding energies of Ti 2p and O is indicated no shift after Au addition. Peaks observed at 81.8 and 85.5 eV due to Au 4f(7/2) and Au 4f(5/2) of metallic gold on the surface of Au/meso-TiO2, confirmed the formation of Au NPs. The as-synthesized anatase TiO2 mesocrystals are composed of small nanocrystals with a size of 8 nm and exhibit the uniform sheaf-like morphology along [001] orientation. As expected, the 1 wt% Au/TiO2 mesocrystals shows the largest photocurrent density, highest H-2-evolution rate, and fastest photodegradation rate of ibuprofen under simulated sunlight irradiation among all the studied catalyst. Furthermore, the effect of solution pH, common anions (Cl-, NO3-, and SO42-) and cations (Na+, K+, and Ca2+) on photocatalytic H-2 evolution and degradation of ibuprofen were individually investigated and discussed. A mechanism for the simultaneous photocatalytic hydrogen generation and degradation of ibuprofen has also been proposed. This work opens up new opportunities for the development of energy efficient techniques for PPCPs degradation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

A structural reorganization is believed to be responsible for the morphology evolution from tetragonal alpha-MnO2 nanowires to spinel LNMO nanoparticles. Galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements indicate the LNMO nanoparticles exhibit a high initial discharge capacity of 129 mA h g(-1) with an 88% capacity retention over 100 cycles at 1C (147 mA h g(-1)), superior to those of LNMO nanorod counterparts (116 mA h g(-1)). The superior electrochemical performance of LNMO nanoparticles can be ascribed to their narrow particle size distribution, less particle aggregation, intimate interparticle contact, increased electrical conductivity and lithium ion insertion-extraction kinetics due to the existence of oxygen deficiency and exposed {111} crystal facets.									26	2	0	0	1	0	26			2046-2069			WOS:000368193500030

We propose an electrocatalytic reductive amination and simultaneous oxidation (ERAO) route to convert biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into valuable 2-hydroxymethyl-5-(ethanolamine methyl) furan (HEMF) at the cathode side and 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) at the anode. Accordingly, the cathode and anode electrode materials of the ERAO electrolyzer are titanium-based metal-organic framework (Ti-MOF) cubes and NiCoFe-LDHs nanosheets, respectively. The overall ERAO shows very good performance with similar to 68% conversion of HMF after 6 h reaction, which is closely related to the exposed N-Ti-O active center from Ti-MOF and porous structure in providing extra access to the internal sites.

For this reason, we report a bi-functional Sm0.5Sr0.5Co1-xFexO3-delta/acetylene black composite electrocatalyst, consisting of the Sm0.5Sr0.5Co1-xFexO3-delta (SSCF) nanofibers and acetylene black (AB). Owing to the electronic coupling effect of Fe and Co and the spillover effect of AB on Sm0.5Sr0.5Co1-xFexO3-delta, SSCF/AB exhibits outstanding OER and ORR performance. In 0.1M KOH solution, the OER Tafel slope of the SSCF/AB catalyst with the optimal mass ratio is 66.7 mV dec(-1), the ORR Tafel slope is 129.6 mV dec(-1). And after 1000 CV cycles, the stability performance of the catalyst remains good.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1452-3981			WOS:000669352100022

This study reports that nickel/iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) with constant tensile strain can be achieved by flash nanoprecipitation. To control the strain extent of NiFe-LDH, a multi-inlet vortex mixer (MIVM) is employed to create a continuous adjustable shear stress field. We utilize this method to produce NiFe-LDH with a precise control over the orientation stretching along the (116) plane from 0.042% up to 0.552% by tuning the flow velocities of 55-70 mL/min. The as-prepared NiFe-LDH with aforementioned strain regulation improves their adsorption properties of oxygen on the surface and exhibits excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity modulations. There is a degressive trend along the strain degree in the tested OER performance, and a 10 mV decrease in overpotential is clearly visible, which can lead to a low overpotential of 320 mV. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations offer valuable insights into the effect of strain in the (116) plane on the adsorption of oxygenated intermediates for OER kinetics. This work which was accomplished with MIVM confirms an effective "bottom-up" strategy to regulate the structural and electronical properties of nanomaterials and is expected to enrich design principles to enhance the electrocatalytic performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0888-5885			WOS:000592479200007

The obtained samples were characterized by a series of techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), photoluminescence (PL) spectra, electrochemical measurements and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS). The results show that the CdS nanoparticles were highly dispersed on surface of MIL-125(Ti). The combination will promote the separation of electron-hole pairs and increase the dispersity of CdS. The nanocomposites were subsequently used as photocatalysts in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde using the molecular oxygen as the oxidant. The nanocomposites show excellent performance in the photocatalytic reaction under visible light irradiation. The conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde was about 20.1% with no by-products observed.									20	1	0	0	2	0	21			1474-905X	1474-9092		WOS:000403432200019	28497824

While significant amounts of mercury were found to be lost upon transfer of mercury coated platinum electrodes, the recovery after transfer was often higher than 100% for mercury coated carbon fibre electrodes. The losses observed with the platinum electrodes were shown to be caused by mechanical detachment of mercury during the handling of the electrode. No losses of mercury due to oxidation by oxygen could be detected either for mercury coated carbon fibre or platinum electrodes. For carbon fibre electrodes (and also for platinum electrodes under some experimental conditions), additional mercury deposition was found to take place in the mercury plating solutions at open circuit. The effect was most pronounced for depositions at negative potentials in acidic solutions indicating that the reproducibility in the preparation of mercury coated electrodes should be improved by avoiding conditions during which hydrogen evolution occurs. In solutions of Hg(II), the reaction Hg2++Hg-->Hg-2(2+) resulted in a gradual loss of the mercury coatings after sufficiently long times at open circuit.									22	1	0	0	5	1	22			0003-2670			WOS:A1996UY44900003

The nanostructured CoP has been proved to be one of the most efficient non-noble metal HER catalyst. However, to further improve their performance in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is still a challenging task. In the present work, we prepare thenanohybrid CeO2-CoP-C catalyst with high porosity through a co-ionic-exchange with Co and Ce ions using the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as template followed with a low-temperature phosphorization route. The high porosity of the catalysts is conductive to the diffusion and mass transfer of the reactants on the catalyst surface. Meanwhile, the doping of rare earth (RE) element modulates the electronic structure of the CoP nanoparticles, and the carbon skeleton left over from the annealed MOF is beneficial to the electronic conduction in the catalyst. Electrochemical tests showed that the ternary CeO2-CoP-C/CC hybrid nanostructure presented overpotential of 71 mV at 10 mV cm(-2) (eta(10)), which is much higher than that of the binary CoP-C/CC catalysts (i.e., 132 mV). In addition, the ternary catalyst also presented a superior long-term durability in an acidic electrolyte. This work opens up a potential strategy for designing more efficient CoP-based catalysts toward electrochemical water splitting. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The HVMA samples with different thicknesses were prepared to perform the weathering aging under different solar radiation intensities. Then, the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy test, gel permeation chromatography test, and fluorescence microscopy test were used to study the chemical composition and micromorphology characteristic of HVMA at different aging depths. Afterward, the dynamic shear rheology test and multiple stress creep recovery test were applied to investigate the macroscopic rheological performance of HVMA. The test results showed that the effect of solar radiation aging diffused from the asphalt surface to the asphalt inside gradually. As the solar radiation intensity and aging time increased, the significant aging depth of HVMA increased continuously. At the surface, HVMA absorbed the solar light near the characteristic absorption band to activate the asphalt molecules and polymer molecules and had oxidation and depolymerization reactions with the full participation of diffuse oxygen. Simultaneously, HVMA also showed continuous microcracks at the surface due to the direct radiation of solar light. As the aging depth increased, the cracking phenomenon disappeared, and the asphalt oxidation rate and polymer degradation rate of HVMA decreased gradually. The increase of solar radiation intensity causes more severe aging at the surface and a faster downward propagation rate of aging effect, thus resulting in accelerated deterioration of the macroscopic rheological performance of HVMA.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2168-0485			WOS:000720777100010		
J	Binder, Bernd; Keppler, Hans								The oxidation state of sulfur in magmatic fluids								EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS				301	1-2			190	198		10.1016/j.epsl.2010.10.042				JAN 3 2011	2011	Sulfur compounds in volcanic gases are responsible for the global cooling after explosive eruptions and they probably controlled the early evolution of the Earth's atmosphere. We have therefore studied the oxidation state of sulfur in aqueous fluids under the pressure and temperature conditions and oxygen fugacities typical for magma chambers (0.5-3 kbar, 650-950 degrees C, Ni-NiO to Re-ReO2 buffer conditions). Sulfur speciation was determined by Raman spectroscopy of quenched fluids trapped as inclusions in quartz. Our results show that sulfur in hydrothermal fluids and volcanic gases is much more oxidized than previously thought and in particular, some explosive eruptions may release a significant fraction of sulfur as SO3 or its hydrated forms. In the pressure range from 500 to 2000 bar, the equilibrium constant K-1 of the reaction 2H(2)S + 3O(2)= 2SO(2) + 2H(2)O in aqueous fluids can be described by InK1 = -(57.1 +/- 7.1) + (173,480 +/- 7592)T-1, where T is temperature in Kelvin. The equilibrium constant K-2 for the reaction SO2+ 1/2O(2)= SO3 in aqueous fluids, where SO3 may include hydrated forms, such as H2SO4, was found to be strongly pressure dependent, with InK2= (5.2 +/- 5.7) + (19,243 +/- 5993)T-1 at 1500 bar; InK2= (11.1 +/- 1.3) + (25,383 +/- 1371)T-1 at 2000 bar and InK2= (22.1 +/- 2.2) + (37,082 +/- 2248)T-1 at 2500 bar. Our data imply that volcanoes may directly inject hexavalent sulfur in the form of H2SO4 into the atmosphere, not only on Earth, but possibly also on Venus and on Mars, when it was still tectonically active. Remote measurements from satellites may have underestimated the sulfur yield of some recent eruptions. Moreover, the mechanisms of the interaction of volcanic gases with the stratosphere need to be reconsidered. (C) 2010 Elsevier BM.

Unfortunately, the current state-of-the-art catalysts still suffer from high cost of noble metals, insufficient catalytic activity and long-term stability. Furthermore, the current strategy to develop new catalysts relies on “trial-and-error” method, which could be time-consuming and inefficient. To tackle this challenge, atomic-level simulations have demonstrated the potential to facilitate catalyst discovery. For the past decades, the simulations have become reasonably accurate so that they can provide useful insights toward the origin of experimentally observed improvements in catalytic properties. In addition, with the exponential increase in computing power, high-throughput catalyst screening has become feasible. More excitingly, recent advances in machine learning have opened the possibility to further accelerate catalyst discovery. Herein, we introduce recent applications and challenges of computation and machine learning for catalyst discovery.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1226-976X			KJD:ART002852757

In this study, to reduce the recombination rate of photoexcited electrons and holes and increase the reaction activity site, BiVO4-Bi2O3 heterostructural flowers were fabricated by one-pot hydrothermal method by adjusting the concentration of hydrogen ions. Moreover, we used sucrose to control the morphology structure of BiVO4 and form the BiVO4-Bi2O3 heterostructural flowers. The BiVO4-Bi2O3 heterostructural flowers exhibited a higher photodegradation rate of organic pollutant than product synthesized without sucrose, BiVO4, and Bi2O3. The synergistic effect between BiVO4 and Bi2O3 and the recombination frequency of photoexcited electrons and holes as influence factors of improving the photooxidative capability were widely explored. The flower-like morphology provided active sites, and the nanosheets of the flowers decreased the transport distance of the photoexcited carriers.									18	2	0	0	1	0	19			1932-7447			WOS:000448087900037

Through XRD, BET and TEM characterization methods, BET surface area of the modified TiC was increased by more than 2 times and a multiple phase structure was formed. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) reveals that the peak current density at 1.5 V vs. SCE on the Ir/TiC is about five times of that on the unsupported Ir black catalyst, and one on Ir/(TiC-TiO_2) (the modified TiC) is about six times of that on Ir/TiC. It is obvious that the processed TIC (TiC-TiO_2 composite) is better for dispersing precious metals and so its catalytic activity is higher for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).			针对PEMWE阳极催化剂,对具有多孔结构和较高比表面积的纳米TiC采用控制氧化进程的方法,进行了表面物相和微孔结构改性,形成多孔结构的TiC-TiO_2壳-芯复合物,并以处理后的TiO_2-TiC原位复合物作为载体,制成了具有高活性的负载型催化剂.通过X射线衍射光谱法(XRD),布鲁瑙尔-埃利特-特勒法(BET)和透射电子显微镜法(TEM)等多种表征方法,证明了改性后的TiC-TiO_2比表面积比TiC增加了2倍以上,具有多矿相复合结构.循环伏安测试表明,Ir/TiC催化剂的析氧峰值电流是Ir黑的5倍,而经过改性后的TiC-TiO_2负载的Ir催化剂则是Ir/TiC催化剂的析氧峰值电流的6倍.很明显改性后的TiO_2-TiC原位复合物具有更大的比表面积和孔体积,更好地分散了贵金属Ir,大大提高了析氧反应的催化活性.						0	0	0		0	0	0			1002-087X			CSCD:3857798

However, bare BiVO4 undergoes poor charge separation and transport and slow kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction. Herein, a dual-cocatalyst-modified photoanode is prepared by depositing Ni(oxy)hydroxide/borate (Ni-OEC) and molecular cobaloxime on a nanoporous BiVO4 photoanode. The optimized BiVO4 photoanode shows an excellent photocurrent density under AM 1.5 G illumination (5.1 mA cm???2 at 1.23 V vs RHE), which is among the highest values using cocatalyst-modified BiVO4 photoanodes for PEC water oxidation. Furthermore, the maximum surface charge injection efficiency and incident photon-to-current efficiency of the ultimate composite photoanode are 85.6% (at 1.23 V vs RHE) and 83.6%, respectively. These results indicate that surface-modified Ni-OEC and molecular cobaloxime can highly improve the photoelectrocatalytic performance of bare BiVO4.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000822504800001

With the advancement of micro-electromechanical system-based technologies, windowed gas cell became increasingly popular due to its ability to achieve high pressure and its compatibility to a wide range of microscopes with minimal modification. This enables a series of imaging and analytical technologies such as atomic resolution imaging, spectroscopy, andoperando, revealing details that were unprecedented before. By reviewing some of the recent work, we demonstrate that the windowed gas cell has the unique ability to solve complicated catalysis problems. We also discuss what technical difficulties need to be addressed and provide an outlook for the future of in situ environmental transmission electron microscopy (TEM) technologies and their application to the field of catalysis development.									11	2	0	0	0	0	12				2073-4344		WOS:000557189400001

However, one significant challenge has been recognized as the instability for most homogeneous LP catalysts upon recycling, thus inevitably leading to dramatic loss in catalytic activity. Additionally, current heterogeneous LP catalysts suffer from low surface area, which largely limits their catalytic efficiency, thereby restricting their potential applications. In this work, we report the successful introduction of LPs, classical and frustrated, into a metal-organic framework (MOF) that features high surface and ordered pore structure via a stepwise anchoring strategy. Not only can the LP be stabilized by the strong coordination interaction between the LP and MOF, but the resultant MOF-LP also demonstrates excellent catalysis performance with interesting size and steric selectivity. Given the broad applicability of LPs, our work therefore paves a way for advancing MOF-LP as a new paradigm for catalysis.									72	3	0	0	5	0	72			2451-9294			WOS:000449667900010

Of these, iridium oxide and, iridium-based molecular compounds are frequently employed as catalysts to oxidize substrates ranging from small organic molecules to water. Here, we study the mechanism and evaluate the potential of iridium-based catalysts for small molecule oxidation in wastewater treatment, using lactic acid as a substrate. By investigating the reaction products, kinetic isotope effects, and electrochemical properties of iridium oxide and a molecular analogue on a high surface area antimony-doped tin oxide (ATO) support, we find evidence for a new iridium-catalyzed pathway for lactic acid oxidation.

Biosensors & bioelectronics				215				114558	114558		10.1016/j.bios.2022.114558				2022-Nov-01	2022	Here, we show that it is possible to harvest photocurrent directly from unprocessed plant tissues from terrestrial or aquatic environments in bio-photoelectrochemical cells (BPECs) and use the current to produce molecular H2. The source of electrons is shown to originate from the Photosystem II water-oxidation reaction and utilizes exported mediating molecules, especially NADPH. The photocurrent production is dependent on the concentration of the photosynthetic complexes, as an increase in total chlorophyll and oxygen evolution rates in the leaves lead to increased photocurrent rates. The permeability of the outer leaf surface is another important factor in photocurrent harvesting. Different tissues produce photocurrent densities in the range of 1-10mA/cm2 which is significantly higher than microorganism-based BPECs. The relatively high photocurrent and the simplicity of the plants BPEC may pave the way toward the development of future applicative photosynthetic based energy technologies.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1				1873-4235		MEDLINE:35930998	35930998

Here, we report that single-atom metal sites distributed around active materials can enhance the CO2RR performance by controlling the Lewis acidity-based local CO2 concentration. By utilizing the oxidation Gibbs free energy difference between silver (Ag), zinc (Zn), and carbon (C), we can produce Ag nanoparticle-embedded carbon nanofibers (CNFs) where Zn is atomically dispersed by a one-pot, self-forming thermal calcination process. The CO2RR performance of AgZn-CNF was investigated by a flow cell with a gas diffusion electrode (GDE). Compared to Ag-CNFs without Zn species (53% at -0.85 V vs. RHE), the faradaic efficiency (FE) of carbon monoxide (CO) was approximately 20% higher in AgZn-CNF (75% at -0.82 V vs. RHE) with 1 M KOH electrolyte.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2046-2069		WOS:000678299000026	35481048

The compact alpha-oxide was shown to be anhydrous in nature (either PtO or PtO2). When the potential was extended into the hydrogen adsorption region, the electrode mass was seen to decrease, but then stabilized once the hydrogen evolution reaction commenced. These results, as well as the effect of the addition of chloride and ferrous ions on the mass measurements, have been interpreted in terms of ion adsorption-desorption processes. The mass change during the reduction of thin hydrous beta-oxide films was also monitored and yielded a mass-to-charge ratio consistent with a PtO(OH)2 film composition. Other mass data indicated that Pt dissolution can occur with repeated beta-oxide growth-reduction cycles and that some Pt may redeposit, given sufficient time at negative potentials.									110	0	0	0	7	0	110			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:A1993LV15300011

Direct charge carrier recombination at the solid/liquid interface is a major cause of efficiency loss in BiVO4-based devices. Intrinsic and extrinsic surface states (SSs) can act as electron and hole traps that enhance the recombination rate and lower the faradaic efficiency. In this study, we investigate the BiVO4/aqueous KPi interface using two types of samples. The samples were prepared at two different deposition and annealing temperatures (450 degrees C and 500 degrees C) leading to different morphologies and stoichiometries for the two samples. Both samples exhibit SSs in the dark that are passivated under illumination. In situ ambient pressure hard x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments performed under front illumination conditions reveal the formation of a bismuth phosphate (BiPO4) surface layer for the sample annealed at 450 degrees C, whereas the sample annealed at 500 degrees C exhibits band flattening without the formation of BiPO4. These results imply that the light-induced formation of BiPO4 may not be responsible for SS passivation. Our study also suggests that slight differences in the synthesis parameters lead to significant changes in the surface stoichiometry and morphology, with drastic effects on the physical-chemical properties of the BiVO4/electrolyte interface. These differences may have important consequences for device characteristics such as long-term stability.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000614055900001

In this paper, the regeneration effects of partial oxidation on biochar's catalytic activity for tar reforming were explored. The catalytic activity of regenerated biochar was verified using a single-stage three sieve plate reaction system. The biochar physicochemical structure was characterised by N2 adsorption, Raman, FTIR and TG analysis. The tar fraction was analysed by GC-MS and the generation of the gas phase fraction was detected online by a synthetic gas analyzer. The results demonstrate that oxidative regeneration can effectively recover the catalytic activity of biochar and promote the production of CH4 and H2. After oxidative regeneration, the external surface area and the microporous area of biochar increase significantly. In addition, the O-containing structures on regenerated biochar become more abundant. The recovery rate of the catalytic activity of RB-0.4-7 is 108.1% and its comprehensive efficiency reaches a maximum of 79.1%. This indicates that the regeneration of deactivated biochar is most efficient when 0.4% oxygen is supplied for 7 min, taking into account the catalytic activity of regenerated biochar and its weight loss rate during the regeneration. The yield of CH4 and H2 catalyzed by regenerated biochar is increased compared with SB. Considering the gas generation in catalytic reforming, a regeneration time of 9 min at the oxygen concentration of 0.4% is considered to be the optimum regeneration condition for deactivated biochar.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000861088100005

The aeration tank is an important part of the activated sludge process, which promotes the oxidation and decomposition of microorganisms by continuously blasting the sewage in the aeration tank. Stirring plays an important role in determining the overall performance of the biological reaction of the aeration tank. However, the current stiring method has a stiring dead zone and uneven oxygen concentration, causing sludge precipitation to affect the aeration effect of the bottom aeration pipe, and at the same time, the biological oxygen demand of the aeration tank is insufficient, which ultimately affects the overall evolution of the aeration tank. Work efficiency is reduced. This paper proposes a novel concept of underwater stiring robot, which is used in sewage treatment aeration tank stiring to prevent precipitation and promote uniform oxygen concentration. It has the advantages of high flexibility, low energy consumption, and low cost. According to the basic functional requirements, the dynamics and control system are analyzed and discussed, and the control technology suitable for aeration tank stirring underwater robot is proposed.					2021 IEEE 21st Annual Wireless and Microwave Technology Conference (WAMICON)2021 IEEE 21st Annual Wireless and Microwave Technology Conference (WAMICON)	28-29 April 202128-29 April 2021		Virtual Conference, USAVirtual Conference, USA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-7281-5176-2	INSPEC:21540682

To avoid the constraints inherent in handling radioactive material, the irradiation effects on the corrosion resistance of zirconium alloys can be studied by irradiating the materials with ions. We performed an original experiment using ion irradiation to more specifically study the influence of irradiation damage in the oxide on the corrosion rate of M5 (R). It has been established that irradiation with a 1.3-MeV helium ion at a fluence of 10(17) cm(-2) results in significant modifications of oxide properties, oxygen diffusion flux, and oxidation kinetics, as evidenced by Raman spectroscopy, secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) analyses, and measurements of mass gains. A newly identified Raman vibration band at 712 cm(-1) was linked to the presence of irradiation defects and allowed the evolution of their concentrations to be followed. The oxygen diffusion flux was significantly reduced after irradiation partly due to a surface concentration decrease of oxygen. The defects remained present in the oxide after 100 days of annealing in pressurized water reactor (PWR) conditions and were thus very stable in PWR conditions, which probably means that these defects would be stable in the reactor. According to the kinetics and in agreement with the results obtained by SIMS analyses, the oxidation rate was significantly reduced after ion irradiation, and this effect remained beyond 100 days in agreement with the high stability of irradiation defects in PWR conditions. An original model described quite well the oxidation kinetic results.					18th International Symposium on Zirconium in the Nuclear Industry18th International Symposium on Zirconium in the Nuclear Industry	MAY 15-19, 2016MAY 15-19, 2016	ASTM Int Comm B10 React & Refract Met & Alloys; ASTM Subcomm B10 02 Zirconium & HafniumASTM Int Comm B10 React & Refract Met & Alloys; ASTM Subcomm B10 02 Zirconium & Hafnium	Hilton Head, SCHilton Head, SC	3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0066-0558		978-0-8031-7641-6	WOS:000434240000014		
J	Iliuta, I; Larachi, F								Concept of bifunctional Redox iron-chelate process for H2S removal in pulp and paper atmospheric emissions								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE				58	23-24			5305	5314		10.1016/j.ces.2003.09.009				NOV-DEC 2003	2003	Utilization of ferric chelates for the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide is beneficial from the standpoint of iron-sequestration and protection against precipitation in the alkaline environments characteristic of the Kraft mill effluents. Availability of oxygen along with hydrogen sulfide in the atmospheric emissions of pulp and paper industries is beneficial for the simultaneous Redox regeneration from ferrous to ferric chelates. By putting together these two premises, the concept of a multifunctional Redox process for the scrubbing of hydrogen-sulfide-contaminated atmospheric effluents emanating from the Kraft mills is formulated, modeled and simulated. This paper discusses from a multiphase reactor engineering perspective, the design of a countercurrent packed-bed bifunctional scrubber by setting an exhaustive modeling framework in which are solved both the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide in reactive ferric chelate solutions of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA chelate) and the simultaneous oxidative regeneration of ferrous chelates resulting from oxidation of hydrogen sulfide. A one-dimensional model based on the transient species balance equations in the gas and liquid phases coupled with the transient film model according to the film-penetration theory was developed for the description of the time and space evolution of the species concentrations along the scrubber. The oxidative regeneration of the ferrous chelate showed a synergistic effect resulting in increased enhancement factor for the hydrogen sulfide oxidation. Availability of plenty of oxygen in the atmospheric effluent precluded starvation of the ferric form and maintained high reaction rates of hydrogen sulphide removal along the whole reactor length.

Cobalt phosphide (CoP) was employed as an active electrocatalyst to promote the oxidation of each of the individual substrates. Surface analysis of the CoP electrocatalyst using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as well as electrochemical characterization, revealed that it had excellent catalytic activity for each of the substrates studied. The combined droplet flow with the continuous flow electrochemical oxidation approach significantly enhanced the conversion and selectivity of the transformation reactions.

Herein, we report a theoretical investigation of the structural, optical and catalytic properties of the (BiVO4)(4) clusters through a combination of density functional theory methods (ab initio molecular dynamics, time-dependent density functional theory, transition state theory). The enhanced solar water oxidation efficiency of BiVO4 quantum-sized clusters is linked with the localisation of the spin density on the cluster surface, and the dramatic reduction, compared with the crystalline BiVO4 phase, of the Gibbs energy of activation and Gibbs energy of reaction associated with the hydrogen transfer process between water and BiVO4. Our results illustrate the main effects associated with the reduction of dimensions (from bulk to quantum-size) on the main steps of water oxidation mechanisms. This understanding can contribute to the design of efficient BiVO4 quantum sized water-splitting photocatalysts.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000453550700028

Conceptually, a hollow nanostructure can be obtained by forming a desired material phase on a removable template and then by subsequently removing the template core. We recently reported the synthesis of a core-shell type structure with a Cu-rich core and Ir rich shell. However, the Cu phase could not be removed from the core due to the imperviousness of the single crystalline Ir-rich shell. In order to facilitate the Cu phase removal, we introduced the polycrystalline Pd seed into the growth of the CuIr nanocrystal, which resulted in the formation of Pd@CuIr nanocrystals with multiple radial grain boundaries. By placing the Pd@CuIr nanocrystal under oxidizing conditions, we could initiate the outward movement of the Cu phase along the grain boundaries. Herein we report the synthesis of an unusual bilayer hollow nanostructure with a CuIr surface layer and a Pd inner-coating layer, following a facile CuPd alloy phase formation and an outward movement of the Cu phase under oxidizing conditions. We also report the high catalytic performance of the hollow nanostructure in oxygen evolution reaction (OER).									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			1466-8033			WOS:000355481800006

Therefore, rational design of cathode catalysts with high activity and stability is crucial to overcome the terrible issues at high current density. Herein, we report a surface engineering strategy to adjust the surface electron structure of boron (8)-doped PtNi nanoalloy on carbon nanotubes (PtNiB@CNTs) as an efficient bifunctional cathodic catalyst for high-rate and long-life Li-O-2 batteries. Notably, the Li-O-2 batteries assembled with as-prepared PtNiB@CNT catalyst exhibit ultrahigh discharge capacity of 20510 mAh/g and extremely low overpotential of 0.48 V at a high current density of 1000 mA/g, both of which outperform the most reported Pt-based catalysts recently. Meanwhile, our Li-O-2 batteries offer excellent rate capability and ultra-long cycling life of up to 210 cycles at 1000 mA/g under a fixed capacity of 1000 mAh/g, which is two times longer than those of Pt@CNTs and PtNi@CNTs. Furthermore, it is revealed that surface engineering of PtNi nanoalloy via B doping can efficiently tailor the electron structure of nanoalloy and optimize the adsorption of oxygen species, consequently delivering excellent Li-O-2 battery performance. Therefore, this strategy of regulating the nanoalloy by doping nonmetallic elements will pave an avenue for the design of high-performance catalysts for metal-oxygen batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2766-8525	2688-819X		WOS:000859663300001

The same procedure was used to prepare ceria-zirconia compositions with different amounts of ceria, both doped and undoped with La and Nd. The potential use of these materials in a two-step solar thermochemical water splitting cycle for the production of H2 was investigated. For this purpose the O2 release of the materials was measured through thermogravimetric analysis in N2 at 1573K. Then all prepared compositions were subjected to an aging treatment at temperature above 1573K in air or in N2 flow and their activity in producing H2 via water splitting at 1073K was evaluated with respect to their structural evolution. The results obtained highlight that the reactivity depends on the temperature and atmosphere of the treatments and on the composition. The best result was obtained for the ceria rich composition treated at 1573K in N2 and for the corresponding doped composition treated in air.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1662-8969			INSPEC:15391960

Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations not only confirm that the O-O coupling step is the rate-limiting step, as expected, but also provide useful insights about the number of water molecules involved in the catalytic cycle, which is under immense debate from a kinetic stand point. To test the effect of the metal environment, we tune the ligands, choosing four ligands (L-1-L-4) holding four kinds of chelation: C-C, N-C, N-N, and C-N ', respectively. A screening analysis of the potential-energy surface reveals the water-oxidation mechanism, together with the optimum number of water molecules, concluding that three water molecules are optimal, and that a highly positive iridium oxo center with a predicted high oxidation state (Ir-V) pulls the electron density from the lone pair of the oxo oxygen and the O center shows positive density. Moreover, the bimolecular mechanism for the O-O bond step is also calculated, for comparison. This study reveals that high cationic character of the metal is helpful for O center dot center dot center dot O coupling.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1434-1948	1099-0682		WOS:000466518100012

Metallic MoO2 with its small size easily agglomerates, making it difficult to use in water splitting to obtain hydrogen by electrolysis. Here, the nano-Cu-mediated multi-site method is proposed to prepare ultrafine MoO2 nanoparticles (NPs) dispersed on poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride)-decorated reduced graphene oxide (denoted as MoO2/PDDA-rGO). The introduction of Cu NPs increases the number of growth sites for MoO2 on the PDDA-rGO and simultaneously promotes the growth rate of MoO2 on PDDA-rGO. As a consequence, the resulting size of the MoO2 NPs is only 2 nm and these are evenly dispersed on PDDA-rGO. Significantly, the optimized catalyst has a low onset potential of -42 mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), a calculated Tafel slope of only 42 mV dec(-1), and good cycling stability of more than 40 h. This favored hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity is caused by the synergistic effects of MoO2 and PDDA-rGO, rapid charge transport, and sufficient exposed active sites of MoO2/PDDA-rGO.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000459737500011	30460758	
J	Pandey, Sakshi; Singh, Varunendra Kumar; Verma, Nidhi; Prasad, Sheo Mohan								Homeostatic influence of calcium and kinetin: Regulation of defense strategies against NaCl stress in cyanobacterium Nostoc muscorum ATCC 27893								SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY				150				851	860		10.1016/j.sajb.2022.08.035				NOV 2022	2022	In the present study, the possible roles of kinetin (KN, 20 nM) and calcium (Ca2+, 0.8 mM) in the alleviation of the salinity stress (50 mM NaCl) induced damage on the growth, and metabolism of cyanobacterium Nostoc muscorum ATCC 27893 was explored. The results revealed that salinity stress decreased the growth, light-harvesting pigments (chlorophyll a, carotenoids and phycobiliproteins) and exopolysaccharides (EPS) contents, photosynthesis (whole-cell oxygen evolution), and the performance of PS II photochemistry [Chl a fluorescence kinetics: maximum photosynthetic quantum yield (Fv/Fm or Phi_Po), quantum yield of electron transport flux (Phi_Eo), yield of electron transport per trapped exciton (Psi_o), size and number of active photosynthetic reaction centers (Fv/Fo) and performance index (PIABS)]. Reverse to this, enhancement of respiratory rate and values of PS II related energy flux parameters [absorption flux per reaction center (ABS/RC), trapping flux per reaction center (TRo/RC), dissipation flux per reaction center (DIo/RC), and electron transport flux per reaction center (ETo/RC)], and rise in levels of oxidative biomarkers (superoxide radical; O-2(center dot-), hydrogen peroxide; H2O2, and malonaldehyde; MDA equivalents) even under accelerated activity of enzymatic antioxidants (superoxide dismutase; SOD, peroxidase; POD, catalase; CAT and glutathione-s-transferase; GST) were observed. Kinetin in presence of Ca2+ improved the growth, pigments contents and performance of PS II photochemistry by down-regulating the oxidative stress biomarkres. Application of Ca2+ scavenger (EGTA) in KN treated samples increased the damaging effect on growth and photosynthesis by aggravating oxidative stress under NaCl stress, thereby indicating the positive role of Ca2+ in NaCl-induced toxicity alleviation by KN. The overall results suggest that Ca2+ together with KN could be applied in paddy fields to up-regulate the growth of N-2-fixing cyanobacterium Nostoc muscorum ATCC 27893, an inhabitant of paddy field under NaCl stress, hence they may be considered for sustainable agriculture.

Here, Ni-Co LDH infused C, O co-doped g-C3N4 two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin nanosheet was prepared by a simple thermal polymerization coupling hydrothermal method. The molecular oxygen activation was estimated by the quantitative determination of center dot O2- and 3,3 ',5,5 '-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) oxidation. 2D/2D heterojunction exhibits impressive photocatalytic performance. The arrestive activation efficiency is derived from the regulated energy band position, the broadened solar light absorption range, and the enhanced photoexcited electron transfer. Benefitting from these merits, the surface charge transfer efficiency of 2D/2D heterojunction is promoted to 51.3% from 14.3% (g-C3N4). The surface recombination rate constant is reduced to 0.0011 s-1 from 0.0042 s-1 (g-C3N4). The feasible photocatalytic mechanism for molecular oxygen activation is expounded based on experimental analysis.									18	0	0	0	5	0	18			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000672571000003

Herein, we demonstrate that composite CoOx/CuO cocatalyst could efficiently enhance the oxygen evolution activity of BiVO4. The onset potential of BiVO4 shifts negatively from 0.42 to 0.38 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and the photocurrent of BiVO4 increases from 0.42 mA cm(-2) to 1.58 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which increases by about 3.76 times. It was confirmed by subsequent electrochemical and physical characterization that the charge separation and injection efficiency were improved, and the IPCE was also improved. Systematic studies indicate that composite CoOx/CuO cocatalyst exhibits better performance than the single CoOx or CuO cocatalyst for promoting the separation of electron-hole, and accelerating the surface water oxidation reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2365-6549			WOS:000838284900001

Selective electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) of biomass-derived lignin monomers to high-value oxygen-functional compounds is promising towards achieving this goal. However, ECH has to date lacked the satisfied selectivity to upgrade lignin monomers to high-value oxygenated chemicals due to the reduction of vulnerable -OCH3 that exists in most lignin monomers. Herein we report carbon-felt supported ternary RhPtRu catalysts with a record faradaic efficiency (FE) of 62.8% and selectivity of 91.2% to methoxy-cyclohexanes (2-methoxy-cyclohexanol and 2-methoxy-cyclohexanone) from guaiacol, via a strong inhibition effect on the cleavage of the methoxy group, representing the best performance compared to previous reports. We further conducted a brief TEA to demonstrate a profitable ECH of guaiacol to high-value methoxy-cyclohexanes using our designed RhPtRu ternary catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000729749000001

Phase evolution, microstructure and optical properties were investigated by thermal analysis, X-ray diffractometry, electron microscopy and Raman, photoluminescence (PL) and diffuse reflectance spectrometry techniques. Rapid combustion reaction in closed system led to weak crystallinity, as confirmed by deep-level emissions in PL spectra. Larger spherical particles (similar to 200 nm) were synthesized in open system at phi = 1. The ascombusted ZnO powders in closed system exhibited higher photocatalytic activity under ultraviolet irradiation, due to their higher adsorption capacity of methylene blue on ZnO surface. Photodegradation rate increased with the increase of fuel content in as-combusted ZnO powders produced by open route as a result of the reduction of particle size and band gap energy.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000436351700099

The H2O oxidation half-reaction, which is essential for producing the necessary reduction equivalents, is an energy-demanding transformation associated with a high kinetic barrier. Herein we present a couple of efficient Ru-based catalysts capable of mediating this four-proton-four-electron oxidation. We have focused on the incorporation of negatively charged ligands, such as carboxylate, phenol, and imidazole, into the catalysts to decrease the redox potentials. This account describes our work in designing Ru catalysts based on this idea. The presence of the negatively charged ligands is crucial for stabilizing the metal centers, allowing for light-driven H2O oxidation. Mechanistic details associated with the designed catalysts are also presented.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1527-8999	1528-0691		WOS:000374765700024	26991306

It is possible to operateMW scale plant. Because It used non-precious metal for electrode. But It has relatively low current density andlow efficiency. In this study, research objective is development of anode for alkaline water electrolysis with lowcost, high corrosion resistance and high efficiency. Stainless steel 316L (SUS 316L) was selected for a substrateof electrode. To improve corrosion resistance of substrate, Nickel (Ni) layer was electrodeposited on SUS 316L.Ni-Fe alloy was electrodeposited on the passivated Ni layer as active catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction(OER).We optimized preparation condition of Ni-Fe alloy electrodeposition by changing current density, electrodepositiontime and composition ratio of Ni-Fe electrodeposition bath. This electrodes were electrochemically evaluated byusing Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and Cyclic voltammetry (CV). The Ni-Fe alloy (Ni : Fe = 1 : 1) showedbest activity of OER. The optimized electrode decreased overpotential about 40% at 100 mA/cm2compared withNi anode.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1738-7264			KJD:ART002184586

The first series (ch1) was crystallised at low water pressure from the granitic melts. The formation of ch2-series is associated with the orthopyroxene, replacement of orthopyroxene by phlogopite in primary ch1 rocks, silica removement and the substantial decrease of deltaO-18, the latter especially developing in restite margins around ch1 rock remnants. The distribution of most petrogenic elements is in agreement with the material balance condition: ch1 + restite = ch2 at high melting extent (0.8-0.9). The depletion of O-18 (up to 0.2 parts per thousand during rapid melt separation is interpreted in terms of Railaigh distillation. These conditions include the presumable increase of H2O activity at the account of buffer reactions. These factors could have been responsible for diatexis resulted in later charnokite (ch2) formation.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0016-7525			WOS:A1994NA17200002

From the four nuclear genes encoding this sulfate permease holocomplex, two are coding for chloroplast envelope-targeted transmembrane proteins (SulP and SulP2), a chloroplast stroma-targeted ATP-binding protein (Sabc) and a substrate (sulfate)-binding protein (Sbp) that is localized on the cytosolic side of the chloroplast envelope. The sulfate permease holocomplex is postulated to consist of. a SulP-SulP2 chloroplast envelope transmembrane heterodimer, flanked by the Sabc and the Sbp proteins on the stroma side and the cytosolic side of the inner envelope, respectively. The mature SulP and SulP2 proteins contain seven transmembrane domains and one or two large hydrophilic loops, which are oriented toward the cytosol. The corresponding prokaryotic-origin genes (SulP and SulP2) probably migrated from the chloroplast to the nuclear genome during the evolution of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. These genes, or any of its homologues, have not been retained in vascular plants, e.g. Arabidopsis thaliana, although they are encountered in the chloroplast genome of a liverwort (Marchantia polymorpha). The function of the SulP protein was probed in antisense transformants of C. reinhardtii having lower expression levels of the SulP gene. Results showed that cellular sulfate uptake capacity was lowered as a consequence of attenuated SulP gene expression in the cell, directly affecting rates of de novo protein biosynthesis in the chloroplast. The antisense transformants exhibited phenotypes of sulfate-deprived cells, displaying slow rates of light-saturated oxygen evolution, low levels of Rubisco in the chloroplast and low steady-state levels of the Photosystem II D1 reaction center protein. The role of the chloroplast sulfate transport in the uptake and assimilation of sulfate in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is discussed along with its impact on the repair of Photosystem II from a frequently occurring photo-oxidative damage and H-2-evolution related metabolism in this green alga.									60	3	0	0	55	1	71			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000235165000002	16307303

Agardh (Chlorophyta) was cultured under two CO2 conditions supplied through the air bubbling system: non-manipulated air and 1% CO2-enriched aeration. These were also combined with N sufficiency and N limitation, using nitrate as the only N source. High CO2 in U. rigida led to higher growth rates without increasing the C fixed through photosynthesis under N sufficiency. Quantum yields for charge separation at photosystem II (PSII) reaction centres (phi(PSII)) and for oxygen evolution (phi(O2)) decreased at high CO2 even in N-sufficient thalli. Cyclic electron flow around PSII as part of a photoprotection strategy accompanied by decreased antennae size was suspected. The new re-arrangement of the photosynthetic energy at high CO2 included reduced investment in processes other than C fixation, as well as in carbon diverted to respiration. As a result, quantum yield for new biomass-C production (phi(growth)) increased. The calculation of the individual quantum yields for the different processes involved allowed the completion of the energy flow scheme through the cell from incident light to biomass production for each of the CO2 and N-supply conditions studied.									65	13	0	0	68	0	78			0032-0935	1432-2048		WOS:000186978600018	12937985

To understand the underlying mechanisms and energetics, the model for faceted nanoparticles was created. The multifaceted nanoparticles' surface is considered by us as a combination of flat and "stepped " facets. Ab initio calculations of the adsorption of water and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) intermediates were performed. Our findings suggest that the "slope " part of the step showed a natural similarity to the flat surface, whereas the "ridge " part exhibited significantly different adsorption configurations. On the "slope " region, both molecular and dissociative adsorption modes were possible, whereas on the "ridge ", only dissociative adsorption was observed. Water adsorption energies on the "ridge " ( -1.50 eV) were significantly higher than on the "slope " ( -0.76 eV molecular; -0.83 eV dissociative) or flat surface ( -0.79 eV molecular; -1.09 eV dissociative).									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2073-4344		WOS:000724477800001

Here we present a cationic redox-tuning method to modulate in situ catalyst leaching and to redirect the dynamic surface restructuring of layered LiCoO2-xClx (x= 0, 0.1 or 0.2), for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Chlorine doping lowered the potential to trigger in situ cobalt oxidation and lithium leaching, which induced the surface of LiCoO1.8Cl0.2 to transform into a self-terminated amorphous (oxy)hydroxide phase during the OER. In contrast, Cl-free LiCoO2 required higher electrochemical potentials to initiate the in situ surface reconstruction to spinel-type Li1 +/- xCo2O4 and longer cycles to stabilize it. Surface-restructured LiCoO1.8Cl0.2 outperformed many state-of-the-art OER catalysts and demonstrated remarkable stability. This work makes a stride in modulating surface restructuring and in designing superior OER electrocatalysts via manipulating the in situ catalyst leaching.									93	7	0	0	7	0	94			2520-1158			WOS:000623755200001

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have constituted a new frontier in the field of catalytic science in recent years. As a non-precious metal, iron (Fe)-SACs show great potential in the field of electrocatalysis, which is comparable to or even better than the performance of precious metal catalysts. However, a robust, generic synthetic strategy toward atomically dispersed Fe catalysts is still lacking, which is still a formidable challenge to maintain the dispersion of Fe atoms at high temperatures and to obtain high catalytic activity. In this review, the latest progress in the synthesis of Fe-SACs is introduced and summarized, and the electrochemical applications of Fe-SACs are further summarized and discussed. Herein, the relationship between the structural characteristics and performance of Fe-SACs is further introduced and discussed. Finally, the existing problems and development prospects of Fe-SACs are discussed.									10	1	0	0	1	0	11				2046-2069		WOS:000609865700052	35424223

Using physical vapor deposition as a tool to overcome thermodynamic miscibility limitations, CuAg thin films with nonequilibrium Cu/Ag alloying were prepared for CO2R performance evaluation. In comparison to pure Cu, the CuAg thin films showed significantly higher activity and selectivity toward liquid carbonyl products, including acetaldehyde and acetate. Suppressed activity and selectivity toward hydrocarbons and the competing hydrogen evolution were also demonstrated on CuAg thin films, with a greater degree of suppression observed at increasing nominal Ag compositions. Compositional-dependent CO2R trends coupled with physical characterization and density functional theory suggest that significant miscibility of Ag into the Cu-rich phase of the catalyst underpinned the observed CO2R trends through tuning of adsorbate and reaction intermediate binding energies on the surface.									47	1	0	0	4	0	47			2380-8195			WOS:000453805100013

However, the reported efficiencies are very low due to the poor kinetics of water oxidation by photogenerated holes on alpha-Fe2O3. In the present study, an alpha-Fe2O3 electrode is obtained by heating a film of Fe which is prepared by the electrochemical reduction of Fe2+ ions. Film thickness and calcination temperature are carefully optimized to get a maximum photoresponse in neutral phosphate solution. In order to improve the water oxidation kinetics and reduce the charge carrier recombination, an iridium-phosphate (Ir-Pi) catalyst is electrodeposited on the surface of alpha-Fe2O3. Ir-Pi is found to reduce the OER onset potential by 350 mV, and enhances the photocurrent density by 3 times at 1.23 V vs. RHE.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2046-2069			WOS:000399810800010

Matching the flux between electrocatalysts and light-absorbers, and between individual semiconducting light-absorbers, are two major issues to design economically viable devices for artificial photosynthesis. With the knowledge that natural photosynthesis is an integrated nanosystem, individual building blocks of biomimetic artificial photosynthesis are discussed. Possible research directions are presented under an integrated device design scheme, with examples of our current progress in these areas. Coupling all of the components together, including electrocatalysts, light-absorbers, and charge transport units, is crucial due to both fundamental and practical considerations. Given the advantages of one-dimensional nanostructures, it is evident that semiconductor nanowires can function as essential building blocks and help to solve many of the issues in artificial photosynthesis.									277	13	0	0	20	0	278			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000330416900035

The study of films in a 0.8 mol dm(-3) LiClO4 + 5 mmol dm(-3) KOH solution indicates that the porosity of the polymer matrix somewhat increases with incorporation of oxide nano-particles. The average apparent diffusion coefficient (D-a) of the dopant (ClO4-) has been observed to be -2 times higher in the composite film compared to pure PPy film. The sum of the film and solution resistances, though higher for the composite electrode, remains practically constant under cathodic polarization conditions. In contrast to a non-composite electrode of the same oxide, the composite electrode exhibits much better clectrocatalytic activity towards the O-2 reduction reaction.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0376-4710	0975-0975		WOS:000233473100007

The GCE shows three surface redox peaks in aqueous HF solutions which become distinct at higher HF concentrations. Fresh surface oxidation and slight surface roughening occurs above 1.6 V. The background current increases significantly due to strong anodic polarisation in HF solutions. However, the electrode activity as measured by the response of the ferricyanide/ferrocyanide redox system remains unaltered. In mixed solvent systems, the surface redox currents and fresh surface oxidation decrease significantly. The oxygen evolution occurs at less positive potentials. Thus the electrochemical activity in such systems is much better.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1040-0397			WOS:A1995QX52600012

Electropolymerization occurred at room temperature in a 1.0 M HBF4 aqueous solution of aniline (0.1 M) by using the potentiostatic technique (800 mV vs SCE).The thermal treatment of protonated polyemeraldine removes the dopant. This phenomenom is accompanied by a drastic modification of the chemical structure of the polymer. The X.P.S. of Nls and Cls levels reveals cross-linking reactions and modifications in atomic charge distribution.The exposure time to atmosphere (0 to 180 days) of the polyleucoemeraldine acidic (0 % imine nitrogen) does not modify the stoechiometry of the polymer, checked by the evolution of C/N atomic ratio. Nevertheless, the oxidation state of the polyaniline is stronghly enhanced at 50 % imine nitrogen is found from a careful X.P.S. analysis.In addition to the two well-known redox couples, a third one is identified as corresponding to the quinone/hydroquinone system.

In bitumen oxidation studies, the increased viscosity has often been related to an increase in polar interactions from oxygen-containing compounds, like carbonyl groups. In this study, bitumen was subjected to two oxidation processes, aging and air blowing. Aging was performed using the rolling thin film oven test (RTFOT) and the pressure aging vessel (PAV), whereas air blowing was conducted in a laboratory unit. This investigation gives more insights in the changes observed during oxidation and highlights the differences between aging and air blowing. Moreover, the oxidation tests provide bitumen samples of increasing viscosity, which are used to evaluate relations between molecular and viscoelastic characteristics. As a comparison, the changes observed in harder bitumen samples prepared by a continued distillation are also included. As expected, the evolution of rheological properties with oxidation time is very similar in the PAV and in the air-blowing unit, although the timescales are very different. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and acidity measurements reveal clear differences in the formation of oxygen-containing functional groups depending on the oxidation process. UV-visible spectroscopy shows that during aging as well as during air blowing, larger conjugated aromatic compounds are formed. These findings suggest that the formation of polyaromatic compounds may be the main contributor to the increase in elasticity and viscosity during oxidation.									51	4	0	0	2	0	54			0035-4511	1435-1528		WOS:000373160800005

To advance CIGS towards an efficient photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), a protective overlayer (typically TiO2) is needed to prevent the corrosion of CIGS and CdS in the electrolyte, and a HER catalyst (typically Pt) is required to promote the surface reaction. However, it is a great challenge to realize delicate spatial control of the HER catalyst on the surface of the protective overlayer using the traditional deposition method. The charge transport through the CdS/overlayer interface is also of vital importance but is rarely considered. Herein, through a new two-step platinization strategy, the dispersion and particle size of Pt nanoparticles are independently controlled to realize high HER catalytic activity. Moreover, defects at the CdS/TiO2 interface are passivated via an ultrathin Al2O3 insertion layer. Consequently, we have obtained a robust CIGS/CdS/Al2O3/TiO2/Pt photocathode for PEC hydrogen evolution, which yields an applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of 6.6% in neutral electrolyte with a long-term stability up to 8 h (4.5% drop), and an unprecedented ABPE of 9.3% in acidic electrolyte that is the highest among chalcopyrite-based photocathodes. When paired with a BiVO4 photoanode to form a PEC tandem cell, an unbiased solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 1.01% is achieved.									84	3	0	0	2	0	85			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000444766400001

In particular, precious metal nanoparticles are key electrocatalysts for a wide range of reactions. Colloidal syntheses offer several advantages to develop precious metal nanoparticles but unfortunately often require capping agents to stabilize the nanoparticles. These ligands or surfactants often block the surface active sites and need to be removed by time and/or energy demanding steps. These extra steps potentially (unnecessarily) complicate studies, might impair reproducibility and limit a direct transfer of fundamental breakthroughs to reallife applications. Fortunately, a range of surfactant-free syntheses have been reported and are well-suited to develop electrocatalysts with improved activity. Surfactant-free syntheses also bear promising features towards high-throughput screening of multi-metallic nanomaterials to explore new concepts in electrode design.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2451-9103			WOS:000819871900008

Co and Fe3+ molybdate phases with various degrees of defectivity are present in the original catalysts along with the ternary compound Bi3FeMo2O12. In the course of the catalytic reaction, conversion of Fe2(MoO4)3 to beta-FeMoO4 is observed; this conversion proceeds to a considerable depth and is accompanied by evolution of lattice oxygen of the solid, which is consumed in the elementary acts of catalysis. Simultaneously, a nonstoichiometric molybdenum oxide phase of the Mo4O11 type is formed; this phase is preserved under reducing conditions and disappears upon reoxidation. The structures of the Co molybdate and the ternary compound remain unchanged in the course of the catalytic process for a period of several hours.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0023-1584			WOS:A1991HV78000010

Herein, a hierarchically porous bimetallic Fe/Co single-atom-coordinated N-doped carbon (Fe/Co-N-x-C) electrocatalyst for ORR is synthesized from Fe/Co-coordinated polyporphyrin using silica template-assisted and silica-protection synthetic strategies. In the synthesis, first silica nanoparticles-embedded, silica-protected Fe/Co-polyporphyrin is prepared. It is then pyrolyzed and treated with acidic solution. The resulting Fe/Co-N-x-C material has a large specific surface area, large electrochemically active surface area, good conductivity, and catalytically active Fe/Co-N(x)sites. The material exhibits a very good electrocatalytic activity for the ORR in alkaline media, with a half-wave potential of 0.86 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, which is better than that of Pt/C (20 wt%). Furthermore, it shows an outstanding operational stability and durability during the reaction. A zinc-air battery (ZAB) assembled using Fe/Co-N-x-C as an air-cathode electrocatalyst gives a high peak power density (152.0 mW cm(-2)) and shows a good recovery property. Furthermore, the performance of the battery is better than a corresponding ZAB containing Pt/C as an electrocatalyst. The work also demonstrates a synthetic route to a highly active, stable, and scalable single-atom electrocatalyst for ORR in ZABs.									30	1	0	0	3	0	31			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000566328100001	32893431

Green and additive-free construction of the above three-in-one carbon nitride (CN) based materials is extremely challenging. Herein the target hierarchical carbon nitride tube with a pipe-in-pipe double-layer and porous coral-like architecture as well as oxygen doping and carbon defects is successfully obtained via a self-templating method. Melamine is the only precursor in the whole process, and there are no harmful solvents or cross-linking agents used for self-assembly with cyanuric acid, which comes from melamine under hydrothermal treatment. Surpassing the simple hollow carbon nitride tube, this hierarchical hollow structure, which is clearly visualized by 3D electron tomography, offers more contact sites and creates new heterogeneous catalytic interfaces synergistically. Hence, the as-prepared photocatalyst achieves a satisfactory hydrogen yield, ascribed to the large surface area, short charge transfer distance, light scattering, fast mass transfer and suitable bandgap with midgap states. This eco-friendly method provides a new opportunity for designing novel micro-nanostructures with desirable performance in solar-to-chemical energy conversion.									38	1	0	0	3	0	38			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000521938400021

The anoxic material used for the column, which is 2 m long, was taken from a core white drilling into a pyrite bearing sediment with an average pyrite content of 0.04 wt%. After packing the column it was drained-and maintained in an unsaturated state over a period of 107 days to allow oxygen supply and pyrite weathering. During this period oxygen breakthrough curves were measured. After 108 days the column was flooded with distilled anoxic water from the bottom to the top with an average water table rise of 5 cm per day. The chemical composition of the pore water in the saturated zone as welt as the water saturation and the oxygen contents have been monitored over the profile of the column. The compositions of the water samples at different depths of the column were modelled with PHREEQC, defining a one-dimensional reactive transport model regarding the mixing process between the incoming flooding water and the residual pore water of the drained period. Kinetic relations were implemented to account for source terms of acids and acid generating components released during the drained period. This study showed that the evolution of the rising water table can be characterized by almost immediate uptake of gypsum and by kinetically controlled dissolution of pyrite weathering products in combination with mixing processes and dispersion.

Here, four kinds of N-doped carbons with well-controlled N species were synthesized using Friedel-Crafts reaction or thermal pyrolysis. It was found that the strong interaction between Pt and N in C-N=C and bridged -NH at the edge of heptazine rings in g-C3N4 improved the performance of Pt/g-C3N4 for nitrobenzene hydrogenation. The calculated turnover frequency of each Pt atom in Pt/g-C3N4 reached 42,865 h(-1) at 50 degrees C, and it was stable for five cydes without agglomeration or leaching of Pt species. These findings provide a promising way for the rational design of the hydrogenation catalysts and the development of well-controlled N-doped carbon materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2574-0970		WOS:000847906700001

Frontiers in bioscience (Scholar edition)				3	3			1180	95						2011 Jun 01	2011	Only recently we can link thermogenesis, mitochondria, nitric oxide, and redox regulation in biochemical terms. Currently, we are discussing these processes from the aspect of fundamental principles of molecular physiology. Thus, the present article highlights both cell physiology and the principles of the maintenance of energy homeostasis in organisms. Energy homeostasis means much more than simple combustion; adipose tissues at this point of evolution development are related to a broad spectrum of metabolic disturbances and all aspects of cellular remodeling (i.e. structural, metabolic and endocrine changes). Therefore, this paper addresses not only thermogenesis but also energy homeostasis, oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production, proliferation and differentiation of brown adipocytes, their life and death, mitochondriogenesis and angiogenesis. These processes will be united by molecular players of oxidation/reduction reactions, thus creating the principles based on the redox regulation.									14	0	0	0	10	0	14				1945-0524		MEDLINE:21622264	21622264

Uniform thin layered nanosheets further self-assembled at micro scale forming embossing structures of delta-MnO2 were fabricated by microwave irradiation technique. The irradiation of UV/O-3 impacts incorporation of oxygen vacancy into the pristine system. Furthermore, detailed structural, morphological, surface analytical and electrochemical investigations evidenced outstanding energy storage and conversion activities. The asymmetric device delta-MnO2-UVT//F-MWCNT with an extended potential window 1.5 V, exhibited maximum energy density of 39 Wh/kg at a power density of 468.75 W/kg. The defect structural design exhibited excellent electrocatalytic OER activity with lowest overpotential (eta(20), 300 mV) and Tafel slope (71 mV/dec). The efficiency and stability of the illuminated material showed outstanding performances. To support our experimental findings, we have presented the electronic structures and quantum capacitance for pristine delta-MnO2 and delta-MnO2 with O vacancy employing Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations. Presence of O vacancy makes a semi-conducting to metallic transition. The oxygen vacancies delocalize the neighboring electrons around the low coordinated Mn atoms and these delocalized electrons can be easily moved into the conduction band resulting improved conductivity in the material. In addition, the computed quantum capacitance tendency is as follows, delta-MnO2-UVT > delta-MnO2 which associates with the experimental supercapacitance behaviour of these systems.

Using CW X-band EPR we can follow the film formation from a Co(NO3)(2) solution in phosphate buffer and quantify Co uptake into the catalytic film. As deposited, the film shows predominantly a Co(II) EPR signal, which converts into a Co(IV) signal as the electrode potential is increased. A purpose-built spectroelectrochemical cell allowed us to quantify the extent of Co(II) to Co(IV) conversion as a function of potential bias under operating conditions. Consistent with its role as an intermediate, Co(IV) is formed at potentials commensurate with electrocatalytic O-2 evolution (+1.2 V, vs. SHE). The EPR resonance position of the Co(IV) species shifts to higher fields as the potential is increased above 1.2 V. Such a shift of the Co(IV) signal may be assigned to changes in the local Co structure, displaying a more distorted ligand field or more ligand radical character, suggesting it is this subset of sites that represents the catalytically 'active' component. The described spectroelectrochemical approach provides new information on catalyst function and reaction pathways of water oxidation.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16				2073-4344		WOS:000502278800052

The mechanisms of many events induced by NO are now well defined, so that a fundamental understanding of NO biology is almost established. Accumulated evidence suggests that NO and oxygen radicals such as superoxide are key molecules in the pathogenesis of various infectious diseases. NO biosynthesis, particularly through expression of an inducible NO synthase (iNOS), occurs in a variety of microbial infections. Although antimicrobial activity of NO is appreciated for bacteria and protozoa, NO has opposing effects in virus infections such as influenza virus pneumonia and certain other neurotropic virus infections. iNOS produces an excessive amount of NO for long periods, which allows generation of a highly reactive nitrogen oxide species, peroxynitrite, via a radical coupling reaction of NO with superoxide. Thus, peroxynitrite causes oxidative tissue injury through potent oxidation and nitration reactions of various biomolecules. NO also appears to affect a host's immune response, with immunopathological consequences. For example, overproduction of NO in virus infections in mice is reported to suppress type 1 helper T-cell-dependent immune responses, leading to type 2 helper T-cell-biased immunological host responses. Thus, NO may be a host response modulator rather than a simple antiviral agent. The unique biological properties of NO are further illustrated by our recent data suggesting that viral mutation and evolution may be accelerated by NO-induced oxidative stress. Here, we discuss these multiple roles of NO in pathogenesis of virus infections as related to both non-specific inflammatory responses and immunological host reactions modulated by NO during infections in vivo.									277	4	5	0	219	2	290			0019-2805	1365-2567		WOS:000165663100002	11106932

The photocatalytic performance of graphitic carbon nitrides can be considerably promoted by modulating its crystallinity. Results confirmed that a high crystallinity accelerates the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers, thus providing more free charges for photoredox reactions. More importantly, the high crystallinity facilitated the adsorption of benzyl alcohol and desorption of benzaldehyde and simultaneously lowered the energy barrier for O-2 activation. As a result, the crystalline carbon nitride exhibited a roughly twelvefold promotion with respect to the normal carbon nitride. The remarkable enhancement of activity can be attributed to the synergistic effects of increased electron-hole separation and increased surface reaction kinetics. These findings will open up new opportunities to modulate the structure of polymers for a wide variety of organic reactions.									74	3	0	0	4	0	73			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000416158500019	28868731

First, the thermal behaviour of the material was investigated and it outlined a good thermal stability up to 400 degrees C. Second, a comparative electrochemical study concerning the OER performance in alkaline medium of several graphite electrodes modified with the nickel phosphite was performed. The most promising electrodes were further characterised electrochemically and the electrode modified with Naflon solution and 5 mg Ni-11(square)(HPO3)(8)(OH)(6) exhibited the smallest overpotential value at the 10 mA cm(-2) anodic current density (0.59 V), as well as the smallest Tafel slope (0.081 V dec(-1)). Furthermore, the constant potential electrolysis test revealed that this electrode is fairly stable within a time span of 300 min. Third, the capacity of Ni-11(square)(HPO3)(8)(OH)(6) nanorods to remove MB and RhB were investigated under simulated visible light irradiation and positive results were obtained for the application as visible-light active photocatalyst. All this together corroborated with the eco-friendly nature of the materials, reinforces the fact that the phosphite type compound is a promising candidate for the design of new multifunctional and advanced materials.

One of the well-known electrocatalysts is hydroxide. In this work, a simple and rapid hydrothermal-electrodeposition method was used to prepare Co(OH)(2)@NiFe-LDH/NF. First, NiFe-LDH nanospheres were grown directly on a nickel foam (NF) surface via a hydrothermal method, and then NiFe-LDH/NF was converted into amorphous Co(OH)(2)@NiFe-LDH/NF using an electrodeposition method. Particularly, the optimized material exhibits excellent OER performance in alkaline electrolytes. Overpotentials of 209 mV and 229 mV were required to drive current densities of 50 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2). Besides, the material possesses a small Tafel slope (38.7 mV dec(-1)) and displays outstanding durability for 100 h. This strategy opens up new possibilities for future non-precious metal OER electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000869277700001

Owing to the diversity of structures and excellent physicochemical properties, MOFs have been regarded as promising materials in wide-ranging fields. However, the application as electrocatalysts is severely hampered by the low electrical conductivity of pristine MOFs. Previous studies have demonstrated that the development of conductive MOFs can be a feasible solution to this issue. Herein, various synthetic strategies to construct conductive MOFs are briefly summarized, including intrinsically conductive MOFs, guest-based conductive MOFs, and conductive MOF composites. Some successful examples of conductive MOFs used as electrocatalysts in electrochemical energy conversions are also introduced. Finally, the existing problems and present prospects for the ulterior applications of conductive MOFs in electrocatalysis for renewable energy conversion and other reactions are highlighted.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2699-9412			WOS:000783863100023

On the other side, surface of the catalysts, entropic effects have been rarely investigated because of the difficulty in deciphering the increased complexities in multicomponent systems. Recent advances in high-entropy materials (HEMs) have triggered broad interests in exploring entropy-stabilized systems for catalysis, where the enhanced configurational entropy affords a virtually unlimited scope for tailoring the structures and properties of HEMs. In this review, we summarize recent progress in the discovery and design of HEMs for catalysis. The correlation between compositional and structural engineering and optimization of the catalytic behaviors is highlighted for high-entropy alloys, oxides, and beyond. Tuning composition and configuration of HEMs introduces untapped opportunities for accessing better catalysts and resolving issues that are considered challenging in conventional, simple systems.									75	2	0	0	5	0	72			2375-2548			WOS:000652258100032	33980494

This has sparked the development of electrocatalysts that need to operate at high product selectivity and high energy efficiency. Electrocatalytic alcohol oxidation, oxygen activation and nitrogen and carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction are examples of reactions with a huge industrial potential. Notably, electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 has recently developed as a favourable pathway to convert this greenhouse gas into valueadded chemicals and fuels. Earth-abundant metals stabilized by carbon/nitrogen macrocycle ligands are well-known efficient and selective catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 in homogeneous conditions. Recently, such catalysts have also been used in supported conditions and implemented in flow cell electrolyzers, showing promising performances. This review provides a synopsis for the evolution of CO2 electrolyzers using molecular catalysts.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2451-9103			WOS:000600547000008

In this article, the metal organic framework ZIF-67 was synthesized by solvothermal method at room temperature, and then the high temperature carbonization was used to prepare the nitrogen-doped carbon-based composite material Co@NC with the Co nanoparticle inside. The effects of the carbonization temperature on surface morphology, chemcial composition and electrocatalytic property were investigated. Most importantly, the Co@NC catalyst with the best morphology and structure was synthesized, and its catalytic activity and stability toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were studied under alkaline conditions. Electrochemical test results showed that the Co@NC catalyst prepared at 700 °C had higher OER catalytic activity and excellent stability. It only required an overpotential of 266 mV for reaching the current density of 10 mA·cm~(-2), with good stability over 40 h.			本文从开发替代贵金属催化剂(如RuO_2,IrO_2,Pt)的廉价催化剂方面着手,以金属有机框架化合物ZIF-67为前驱物,通过室温溶剂热法合成金属有机骨架ZIF-67,将其高温炭化制备出包覆Co纳米颗粒的氮掺杂的碳基复合材料,即Co@NC.研究炭化温度对其形貌结构、元素组成和电催化性能的影响.制备形貌结构最优的Co@NC催化剂,并研究了其在碱性条件下析氧反应的催化活性和稳定性.						4	3	0	0	0	0	6			1006-3471			CSCD:6630386

The crystalline particles of Ta2O5 and NaTaO3 have mean sizes of 6 and 9 nm, constructing mesoporous networks with surface areas of 91 and 75 m(2)g(-1), respectively. The photocatalytic performances of the tantalum-based replicas were investigated for the water splitting reaction by using methanol as sacrificial agent and better photocatalytic performances were observed in comparison with bulk and amorphous counterparts. Loading the templated Ta2O5 and NaTaO3 with 1 wt% NiOx boosted their photocatalytic activity.

The shape and structure of the nanocompounds were confirmed by SEM, XRD, FTIR, Raman spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, BET, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. These compounds were examined as catalysts in photocatalytic water oxidation with [Ru(2,2-bipyridine)(3)](2+) and S2O82- as a photosensitizer and a sacrificial oxidant, respectively. All of the samples exhibit high turnover frequencies and perfect stability in slightly alkaline conditions. A characteristic peak at around E=0.95V versus Ag/AgCl assigned to a Ni3+ species was detected by cyclic voltammetry, which suggests that a high-valent nickel species may be responsible for water oxidation. The surface properties of the -NiO nanorods also remain unchanged after examination by XPS before and after the photocatalytic reaction.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000359066500014

Unlike the conventional chemical/thermal reduction pathways which effectively deoxygenated the oxidized graphite, the photocatalytic method removes oxygen functional groups selectively to afford excellent conductivity restoration yet maintaining its water miscibility. The controlled redox capabilities of the photocatalyst serve as an effective modulation tool to tune the conductivity restoration and suppression of hydrophobicity. Moreover, the evolution of defect minimization/generation in a two-step pattern is monitored throughout the photocatalytic process and its association with the conductivity of RGO is established. The insights of defect engineering at the initial stage of graphene oxide (GO) to RGO transformation provides useful information in developing optimum chemical methods to produce large domain and small defect density graphene.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000325098300053

Here, we report a simple bottom-up, strategy to rationally tune the band structure of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4). By incorporating electron-deficient pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) monomer into the network of g-C3N4, the,VB position can be largely decreased and, thus, gives a strong photooxidation capability. Consequently, the modified photocatalyst shows preferential activity for water, oxidation over water reduction in comparison with g-C3N4. More strikingly, the active species involved in the photodegradation of methyl orange switches from photogenerated electrons to holes after band structure engineering. This Work may provide guidance on designing efficient polymer photocatalysts with the desirable electronic structure for specific photoreactions.									372	23	1	0	43	0	379			2155-5435			WOS:000318589100017

Ti was included because it is often combined with Ru and Ir to improve stability of these highly active catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Different OER catalyst coating thicknesses were formed by varying Ru, Ir and Ti mass in the range of 1-10 mu g/cm(2) Pt-NSTF geometric area. The OER activity was assessed by quasi-steady state polarization measurements. The electrochemical data demonstrate that the OER catalytic activity of Ru and Ir in PEM compares well with their behavior in aqueous environment.

These nanometric systems contain elements of nanoconfinement in different degrees, depending on the geometry, which can have a much greater effect on the activity and selectivity than often considered. In this Review, we firstly identify the systems containing different degrees of nanoconfinement and how they can affect the activity and selectivity of electrocatalytic reactions. Then we follow with a fundamental understanding of how electrochemistry and electrocatalysis are affected by nanoconfinement, which is beginning to be uncovered, thanks to the development of new, atomically precise manufacturing and fabrication techniques as well as advances in theoretical modeling. The aim of this Review is to help us look beyond using nanostructuring as just a way to increase surface area, but also as a way to break the scaling relations imposed on electrocatalysis by thermodynamics.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000802881500001	35403340

Hydrogen has been proposed as the main element responsible for the density deficit observed in the Earth's inner core. Moreover, the solubility of hydrogen in iron increases considerably with increasing pressure. Here, we systematically investigated global energetically stable structures of FeH4 in the pressure range of 80-400 GPa using a first-principles structural search. A transition from an insulated alpha-phase to a metallic beta-phase and then to a semi-conductive gamma-phase was predicted. Interestingly, we find a superconducting state in the beta-phase with a transition temperature of 1.70 K at 109.12 GPa. The results are useful for investigating the stable phases and equation of state in the Fe-H system, which are relevant to the Earth's core.									11	1	0	0	1	0	11				2046-2069		WOS:000395934500017

The morphologies of ZnO/SnO2 hierarchical nanostructures can be well tailored by adjusting the reaction time and pH value in the hydrothermal process. Cyclic voltammetry was used to investigate the electrocatalytic activity of the samples. The results show that ZnO/SnO2 hetero nanotubes with a high electroactive surface area can significantly enhance the oxygen evolution potential and lower the phenol oxidation potential (similar to 650 mV) in comparison with the Pt (Ag/AgCl)(similar to 1000 mV) electrode, SnO2 electrode (similar to 1400 mV) and ZnO nanorods electrode (similar to 880 mV). It suggests that such ZnO/SnO2 hetero nanotubes hold great potential in electrocatalytic oxidation process. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, a pH-controlled co-precipitation route was systematically investigated. Special attention was paid to the pH value during co-precipitation and co-precipitate posttreatment. In a sacrificial photocatalytic water oxidation test, the highest activity was observed for a sample precipitated at pH = 1 and 70 degrees C, which was post treated at 600 degrees C in air for 3 h after washing and drying. The activity was further improved by another 90% by the addition of the Co3O4-based co-catalyst. Good synergy between semiconductor and co-catalyst was obtained for the deposition of pre-formed nanoparticles at a loading of 0.1 w% (physical impregnation). The effects of different synthesis conditions of the semiconductor and impregnation method for the co-catalyst on the structure, morphology and optical properties of the catalysts were investigated by PXRD, SEM, UV-vis spectroscopy, and TEM, while the water oxidation activity was compared in the dark and with the aid of visible light using cerium (IV) or silver (I) as sacrificial agents, respectively, with the aim of establishing structure-activity correlations. The roles of semiconductor particle anisotropy and co-catalyst particle distribution for optimal photo-activity in the oxygen evolution reaction are discussed.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0942-9352			WOS:000542554000008

A novel mechanism responsible for widening the electrochemical stability window of water-in-salt electrolytes (WiSEs) compared to conventional salt-in-water electrolytes is suggested based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the electrolyte-electrode interface. Water exclusion from the interfacial layer at the positive electrode provided additional kinetic protection that delayed the onset of the oxygen evolution reactions. The interfacial structure of a WiSE at negative electrodes near the potential of zero charge clarified why the recently discovered passivation layers formed in WiSEs are robust. The onset of water accumulation at potentials below 1.5 V vs Li/Li+ leads to formation of water-rich nanodomains at the negative electrode, limiting the robustness of the WiSE. Unexpectedly, the bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anion adsorbed and trifluoromethanesulfonate desorbed with positive electrode polarization, demonstrating selective anion partitioning in the double layer.									105	4	0	0	5	0	107			1948-7185			WOS:000411781900006	28846430

The flexible changes of the oxidation state of the Fe component during ammoxidation were followed by examining the intensity changes of the characteristic bands of Fe2Mo3O12 and FeMoO4 in the Raman spectra and could be correlated with the catalyst performance examined by simultaneous MS analysis. Depending on the catalyst composition and the oxygen content in the feed, Fe2Mo3O12 is reduced to a different extent, and consequently, FeMoO4 is formed, which is accompanied by a restructuring of the catalyst and the formation of nanostructured MoOx species. In accordance with previous investigations, operando Raman studies revealed that CoMoO4 and Bi2Mo3O12 influence the redox behavior of Fe2Mo3O12 in different ways.									9	0	1	0	0	0	10			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000372152100016

Decreases are generally observed in the electrochemically active area, electrochemical stability and durability of the electrodes in aqueous solutions in the presence of these organic substrates. The following sequence holds for the influence of C-1 compounds on the electrode properties (i.e. activity and stability): CH3OH > HCHO > HCOOH. The corrosion characteristics of electrode are studied by X-ray diffraction measurements. For the first time, the decomposition and dissolution of active oxide layers are quantitatively characterized from the decreases in cell volume of rutile-structured IrO2 crystallite and from the increases in texture coefficient of (0 0 2) planes, respectively, as a result of the accelerated lifetime tests.

The first major degradation step of LCPs was the ester linkage rupture reaction. In the case of fully aromatic LCPs, this process was little influenced by 20% oxygen atmosphere. The main evolved gaseous products at this step were CO, CO2, H2O and phenol for fully aromatic LCP samples, in addition, aliphatic products for a semi-aromatic LCP sample. Evolution of CO2 was followed by that of flammable organic products for fully aromatic LCPs, while flammable organic products evolved prior to CO2 for semi-aromatic LCP. The flame resistant and self-extinguishing mechanisms of LCPs are discussed on the basis of their thermal degradation behavior.									35	0	0	0	2	0	35			0165-2370			WOS:A1996VJ72200004

The size of the clusters generated in the carbon solids can be controlled by the platinum loading level in the carbon precursors. The platinum clusters possess a narrow size distribution with average diameters from 8 to 19 angstrom. The exchange current density of the materials for the hydrogen evolution reaction correlates with the number of vertex sites for the clusters with the highest efficiency found for the smallest clusters. The materials also exhibit excellent catalytic activity for the reduction of dioxygen with a response similar to that found for polycrystalline platinum.									32	0	0	0	1	0	33			0897-4756			WOS:A1993MM32500010

These retardants may reduce the risk of fire, but they also involve high cost, toxicity, and related ecological issues. In an effort to mitigate some of these negative factors, we herein report the development of a green flame-retardant PAN based on bio-inspired dopamine methacrylamide (DMA) co-monomer. This polymer was synthesized through free radical polymerization of AN and acetonide-protected dopamine methacrylamide (ADMA), followed by deprotection of ADMA. Systematic investigation of the structural evolution of P(AN-co-DMA) confirmed that DMA provides a kinetic advantage for initiating the cyclization of PAN at significantly lower temperatures (209 degrees C) as well as for controlling effectively the amount of heat generated. Moreover, the effective radical scavenging capability of DMA, and the formation of a carbonaceous layer on the polymer surface, greatly improved the flame-retardant performance of PAN, without the use of conventional additives. This resulted in low heat-release capacity (HRC) and high limiting oxygen index (LOI) values of 58 Jg(-1) K-1 and 37% (superior to those values of Nomex (R)), respectively. The thermal oxidative stabilization (TOS) process and flame retarding properties of PAN/GO composites were further investigated. TOS process and flame retarding mechanism were found to be influenced by ionic interaction and hydrogen bonding between polymer and nanomaterial. This work opens up a facile and sustainable methodology for the design of environmentally friendly and high-performance flame retardants and composites.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			1359-8368	1879-1069		WOS:000514216400013

Currently, about 95 % of H(2)is produced from the steam reforming of methane. However, this process leads to the burning of fossil fuels and emits greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Water electrolysis is an effective strategy to produce H(2)in high purity. Alkaline anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AAEMWE) is preferred to proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) because of the flexibility to be able to use cheaper membranes as separators and non-noble electrocatalysts. However, the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics in AAEMWE is a bottleneck for water splitting efficiency and decreases the overall performances. Now, a novel nickel and iron graphene-nanoplatelets-supported metal-organic framework-based electrocatalyst has been developed that shows excellent durability and record-high current density for alkaline electrolysis that outperforms the state-of-the-art OER electrocatalysts.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			2196-0216			WOS:000571804000001

In this work, we synthesize the N-doped carbon-coated Ni-MoO2 nanowire heterostructure catalyst anchored on nickel foam for boosting the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (HER and OER). Electrochemical results indicate that it exhibits low overpotentials for HER (50 and 304 mV) and OER (240 and 400 mV) at +/- 10 and +/- 2000 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, it can keep for 340 h under a multicurrent-process condition (10-1500 mA cm(-2)) as a cathode and anode without obvious attenuation. The outstanding performance could be ascribed to the heterostructure existing in Ni and MoO2, N-doped-carbon coating structure, and nanowire architecture anchored on nickel foam. This work could provide an industrially promising, cheap, and green method for hydrogen production.									30	1	0	0	2	0	31			2168-0485			WOS:000562983600021

Here, we report nitrogen fixation by Ru single-atom electrocatalytic reduction at room temperature and pressure. In contrast to Ru nanoparticles, single Ru sites supported on N-doped porous carbon greatly promoted electroreduction of aqueous N-2 selectively to NH3, affording an NH3 formation rate of 3.665 mg(NH3) h(-1) mg(Ru)(-1) at -0.21 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. Importantly, the addition of ZrO2 was found to significantly suppress the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. An NH3 faradic efficiency of about 21% was achieved at a low overpotential (0.17 V), surpassing many other reported catalysts. Experiments combined with density functional theory calculations showed that the Ru sites with oxygen vacancies were major active centers that permitted stabilization of *NNH, destabilization of *H, and enhanced N-2 adsorption. We envision that optimization of ZrO2 loading could further facilitate electroreduction of N-2 at both high NH3 synthesis rate and faradic efficiency.									510	50	0	0	19	1	519			2451-9294			WOS:000455452800017

In addition, hydrogen-peroxide formation is identified as a competing process affecting the oxidative stability of photoelectrodes. We impose spin-selectivity by coating the anode with chiral organic semiconductors from helically aggregated dyes as sensitizers; Zn-porphyrins and triarylamines. Hydrogen peroxide formation is dramatically suppressed, while the overall current through the cell, correlating with the water splitting process, is enhanced. Evidence for a strong spin-selection in the chiral semiconductors is presented by magnetic conducting (mc-)AFM measurements, in which chiral and achiral Zn-porphyrins are compared. These findings contribute to our understanding of the underlying mechanism of spin selectivity in multiple electron-transfer reactions and pave the way toward better chiral dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells.									139	2	0	0	18	0	139			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000394829200038	28132505

Anode current on gold in mixed thiosulfate-sulfite electrolytes								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				154				315	320		10.1016/j.electacta.2014.12.097				FEB 1 2015	2015	The anodic current in individual and mixed thiosulfate-sulfite solutions was studied by means of voltammetry on a fresh gold RDE surface. An unexpected result was obtained: a new additional current maximum appears on the anodic voltammogram in mixed solutions; it is not observed in the individual solutions of sodium thiosulfate and sulfite. The reasons for, and mechanism associated with, this phenomenon require separate and detailed investigation. It is shown that the rate of the anodic process in sulfite solutions is limited by diffusion of discharging particles, while the rate of the anodic process in thiosulfate solutions is limited by slow (in comparison with diffusion) heterogeneous reactions. In mixed solutions, the presence of thiosulfate causes partial passivation of the electrode, while the presence of sulfite causes its partial depassivation. It is stressed that the initial stages of oxygen evolution on gold have opposite effects on anodic currents in sulfite and thiosulfate solutions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Supramolecular templates with tunable morphology and rich surface functional groups facilitate the tight coating of other materials for the formation of hollow nanostructures. The weak interaction between the supramolecules or micromolecules benefits the facile removal of the templates for large-scale synthesis of hollow nanostructures and also affords excellent template reusability. This method allows for the incorporation of various metal dopants into the TiO2 lattice, as a typical example of nanocatalyst, by introducing the corresponding metal salt as a dopant source. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and UV-vis absorption spectroscopy investigations suggested substitution of Ti4+ sites by Co2+, which increased the activity of the catalytic sites in the doped materials, reducing the overpotential of TiO2 for the oxygen evolution reaction.									6	3	0	0	0	0	6			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000209924600003

A relatively high adsorption rate and its reversibility have been confirmed; parameters of the Mossbauer spectra obtained provide evidence that the adsorbed ferric species retain their hydroxo coordination while its symmetry is being distorted, which is considered to proceed with partial loss of water molecules of the outer (second) coordination sphere. Specimen treatment in water leads to destruction of the initial coordination, the bonding strength of the resulting ferric particles to the adsorbent surface being significantly increased. The role of the surface phase non-homogeneity of higher Ni oxyhydroxide has also been outlined.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:A1992GY64600015

High-surface-area particles can be obtained at substrate temperatures as low as 150 degrees C by this technique. Clear differences in morphology were identified, which depended on the type of reactive gas introduced in the process. Although oxygen leads to a crystalline film growth, hydrogen leads to an open structure of stacked Pt spheres. The electrochemically active surface area of these deposits were determined by hydrogen adsorption-desorption measurements in alkaline solution. With respect to water splitting and other catalytic processes, we present a way to synthesize and characterize high-surface-area Pt samples easily. To evaluate their electrocatalytic performance, the catalysts were analyzed in terms of the overvoltage for the hydrogen evolution reaction.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000370036900010

The measurement results of XRD, cyclic voltammetry and constant current charging and discharging indicated that the synthesis prepared through micro-emulsion method were still hexagonal beta-Ni(OH)_, however, their reaction activity and discharging capacity were reduced because the crystallite size were very small and soichiometric ratio were not 1/2. It was also demonstrated that the addition of zinc with different forms can increase the fault of crystal, improve the structure of nickel hydroxide and the transporting ability of electron and H~+ in the electrode material, so the reversibility of nickel hydroxide electrode and the oxygen evolution potential were increased. These improved the charging efficiency of nickel hydroxide electrode, accordingly, increased the discharging capacity of Ni(OH)_2. The effect of adding zinc by coprecipitating was the best among different addition forms.			研究了以共沉淀、包覆、机械混合等不同方式添加或不添加锌对微乳液法合成的氢氧化镍结构和性质的影响.XRD、循环伏安和恒电流充放电测试结果表明:微乳液法的合成物仍是具有六方晶体结构的beta-Ni(OH)2,但其晶粒度很小,且化学计量比不等于1/2,所以材料的活性和放电比容量下降;锌的添加增加了Ni(OH)2的晶体缺陷,改善了Ni(OH)2的结构,增加了电极中电子和质子的传递能力,从而提高了氢氧化镍电极的可逆性,强化了电极的析氧极化,其充电效率和放电比容量也随之提高;其中,以共沉淀方式添加锌,氢氧化镍电极的性能最好.						0	0	0		0	0	0			0441-3776			CSCD:1672661

Multicomponent structure of the EPR spectra of these macerals was analysed. The number of component lines, their lineshapes and parameters: linewidths and g factors, were determined. Total concentrations and concentrations of paramagnetic centres responsible for the component lines were measured. The broad Gaussian, broad Lorentzian and narrow Lorentzian lines were observed in the experimental spectra of exinite and vitrinite. The EPR spectra of inertinite are superposition of two narrow Lorentzian lines with different linewidths. The evolution of paramagnetic centres during heating of the macerals at 300-650 degrees C was studied. Paramagnetic centres with broad Lorentzian lines are the most active ones in the thermal decomposition. The EPR results indicate reactions between individual macerals during thermal decomposition of coal. Thermally excited multiplet states were found in exinite and vitrinite.

By using well-defined thin-film model electrodes, the stability of Pt and Pt on Ir were examined as cathode catalysts in a single cell PEMFC setup. The electrodes were fabricated by evaporating thin layers of Pt and Pt on Ir onto the microporous layer of a gas diffusion layer. The amount of Pt deposited was equivalent to 3 nm (about 6.3 mu g cm(-2)) and the amount of Ir was varied between 1.5 nm and 20 nm (between 3.4 mu g cm(-2) and 45.3 mu g cm(-2)). All samples with Ir showed an increased stability over samples with sole Pt during cyclic corrosion test between 0.6V and 1.2V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode. For thin layers of Ir, the initial activity for the oxygen reduction reaction was equal to or superior to that of sole Pt but for thicker Ir films it was somewhat lower. Hydrogen underpotential deposition and CO stripping were used to estimate the electrochemical surface area during the experiments and physical characterisation using scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to determine the structure of the samples. The results suggest that Ir can stabilise Pt in the cathode electrode. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									15	0	0	0	1	0	16			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000329531100021

The data showed that the net photosynthetic rate(P_n),stomatal conductance and chlorophyll content were significantly decreased compared with that of the control after infection by C. canadense,whereas intercellular CO_2 concentration was significantly increased. These results indicated that the decreased photosynthesis in infected leaves was resulted from non-stomatal factor. Furthermore,significantly enhanced H_2O_2 content,reduced F_v/F_m and PI_(ABS),as well as the changed chlorophyll fluorescence transient was also observed in leaves of tree peony infected by C. canadense. The donor sides(Oxygen evolution complex),reaction centers and acceptor sides of PSⅡ were significantly inhibited by C. canadense infection. But the acceptor sides were more suffered than the donor sides. At the same time,the activity of PSⅠ was also significantly reduced. Taken together,the data presented here indicated that C. canadense infection resulted in the accumulation of H_2O_2,which in turn damaged the functions of PSⅠand PSⅡ. The decline of PSⅠ activity inhibited transportation of electrons from PSⅡ to PSⅠ,which then led to the accumulation of excessive excitation energy and reactive oxygen species(ROS). The increased ROS Inhibited synthesis of protein D1,accelerating damage to PSⅡ. It was the main reason for inhibition of photosystems in tree peony leaves after infected by C. canadense.			以牡丹(Paeonia suffruticosa)藏枝红为试验材料,通过测定叶绿素荧光快速诱导动力学曲线、820 nm 光吸收曲线以及气孔交换参数和H_2O_2含量,研究了柱枝孢叶斑病(Cylindrocladium canadense)对牡丹叶片光合性能和光系统功能的影响。结果显示:在病原菌侵染后,牡丹叶片的净光合速率(P_n)、气孔导度和叶绿素含量均下降,而细胞间隙CO_2浓度升高,表明P_n的降低是受非气孔因素的影响。Cylindrocladium canadense 的侵染,使H_2O_2含量显著升高,快速叶绿素荧光诱导动力学曲线形状发生明显改变,F_v/F_m 和PI_(ABS)均显著下降。PSⅡ供体侧、反应中心和受体侧活性均受到抑制,但PSⅡ受体侧所受抑制比供体侧大。同时,病原菌侵染也使PSⅠ(△I/I_o)活性快速下降。由上述研究结果推测:Cylindrocladium canadense 的侵染,使H_2O_2积累增加,对PSⅠ和PSⅡ的功能造成伤害。PSⅠ活性的下降阻碍了PSⅡ向PSⅠ的电子传递,过剩激发能增加,导致ROS 增加,抑制D1蛋白的合成,加剧了对PSⅡ伤害,这是其侵染抑制牡丹光合系统的主要原因。						0	10	0	0	0	0	10			0513-353X			CSCD:4800552

To study the dependence of the initial sticking probability, so, saturation coverage of the O-2 incident energy, E-n, and the oxygen uptake curves, which were evaluated from the time evolution of O 1s peak area, were measured over energy ranges from E-n = 0.03 eV (thermal gas) to 2.26 eV. It was found that a trapping-mediated adsorption mechanism is dominant at E-n < 0.06 eV. In contrast, an activated adsorption mechanism becomes prominent at E-n > 0.06 eV, along with the trapping-mediated adsorption mechanism which becomes less prevalent with increasing E-n. The saturation coverage at energies over 1.9 eV is approximately 1.6 times larger than that at 0.03 eV. Two different components of the 0 1s spectrum and their energy dependence were verified. A marked increase in the tri oxygen component is clearly observed in the 0 1s photoelectron spectrum for saturation at E-n > 0.39 eV, which is the evidence for the enhancement of dissociative adsorption of O-2 into the subsurface layers; 0.39 eV was taken as the threshold energy for E-n dependence of both s(0) and saturation coverage. The adsorption states induced via the novel reaction channel correlating with E-n were confirmed by the in situ spectroscopic surface analysis method.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			1932-7447			WOS:000285447000025

Herein, a step-by-step strategy to prepare a hierarchical structure assembled from Ni-doped amorphous FeP nanoparticles, porous TiN nanowires, and graphitic carbon fibers (Ni-FeP/TiN/CC) is described. The FeP/TiN/CC composite is plasma-implanted with Ni ions to modify the electronic structure and produce an amorphous surface. Simultaneous doping and amorphization of FeP by Ni ion implantation to enhance the HER activity is achieved for the first time. The flexible and freestanding Ni-FeP/TiN/CC catalyst produced on a carbon cloth can serve directly as an electrode in HER in an alkaline medium. The Ni-FeP/TiN/CC catalyst delivers excellent HER performance including an overpotential of 75 mV to generate a cathodic current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope close to that of commercial Pt/C catalysts, and long lifetime indicated by a more constant cathodic current density during continuous operation for 10 h. The remarkable HER activity is attributed to the combined effects rendered by the Ni and Fe atoms in the Ni-doped FeP nanoparticles, active amorphous surface, as well as conductive nanowire scaffold, which expose a large amount of active sites, enhance the charge transfer efficiency, and prevent the catalysts from migration and aggregation.									74	4	0	0	2	0	75			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000448994600008

Herein, the hydrogenation hierarchical flower-like Bi2MoO(6) hollow spheres (H-BMO-X, where X represents the different hydrogen calcination temperatures) have been successfully fabricated by a solvothermal-surface hydrogenation process. The as-prepared nano-photocatalyst H-BMO-300 clearly exhibits a photocatalytic reaction apparent rate constant k for high-noxious pollutants by similar to 3-times higher than pristine Bi2MoO(6). Moreover, the resultant H-BMO-300 sample with a narrow bandgap of similar to 2.70 eV possesses surface oxygen vacancy defects. Based on the scanning Kelvin probe and surface photovoltage spectroscopy, it is deduced that the photo catalytic activities are attributed to the surface oxygen vacancy of H-BMO-X favoring the electron-hole pair's separation. The enhanced photocatalytic performance can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of surface defects favoring efficient electron-hole separation and the hollow hierarchical structure benefiting the utilization of visible light, which provides more surface-active sites. This work provides a viable route to perceptibly enhance the photocatalytic activities of H-BMO-300 for environmental remediation with good mineralization properties. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Although many solid elements in the periodic table have been fabricated as nanoporous materials by dealloying, technically important nanoporous boron has not been realized because of the poor diffusivity and high chemical stability of boron. Here we report a scalable top-down method to produce three-dimensional nanoporous boron by selectively leaching a less stable metal compound phase from rapidly solidified two-phase metal-boron alloys. The metalloid boron phase with relatively high chemical stability remains as the skeleton of a nanoporous structure. The resultant nanoporous boron with tunable pore sizes, and porosities, shows superior catalytic activities towards ammonia electrosynthesis. This work provides a new approach to fabricate nanoporous metalloids for a wide range of functional applications and brings boron, an important functional material, to the family of dealloyed nanoporous materials.									20	1	0	0	1	0	20			1369-7021	1873-4103		WOS:000573371200001

In this work, a facile synthetic process is reported for single-crystalline WO3 microplates with variable thicknesses grown directly on a fluorine-doped tin oxide substrate followed by an annealing procedure. The WO3 microplate electrode showed an improved photocurrent under 1 sun irradiation (1.9 mA/cm(2) at 0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl, 100 mW/cm(2)) for water oxidation, including a significant enhancement in the visible light region compared to either a nanoparticle or a bulk film electrode. The enhanced water oxidation activity originates from both the single crystallinity with an optimum thickness and the oxygen-deficient characteristic of the WO3 microplates. To improve the photochemical stability, FeOOH electrocatalysts were deposited on the surfaces of the WO3 microplates. The resulting WO3/FeOOH composite electrode showed enhanced stability for water oxidation reactions.									32	0	0	0	2	0	31			1932-7447			WOS:000375631100021

Here, we have constructed MoS2 nanosheets decorated on a copper-doped CdS nanorod composite as a noble-metal-free photoelectrocatalyst. This kind of composite material was constructed through a simple solvothermal method. The morphology, structure, chemical states, photoelectrochemical properties, and other properties were tested by using a diverse range of analytical techniques. Owing to the Cu2+ doping and the excellent electron-capturing ability of MoS2, 5% MoS2/Cu-CdS (with 7% Cu2+ doping in CdS) exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution reaction with a rate of 10.18 mmol h(-1) g(-1), which is about 48 times higher than that of pure CdS. A significant increase in the photoelectrochemical performance of the composite catalytic material benefits from the synergistic effect between CdS and MoS2 and fast interfacial charge transfer, owing to the Cu2+ doping. These findings provide a new thought for further research of the ion doping in photoelectrocatalytic field.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2196-0216			WOS:000458972400016

Our approach has been to emphasize characterization of mutants with reduced PS II activity rather than those that lack PS II activity altogether in order to address questions about the effects of the mutations on the functional properties of the Mn ensemble. A number of mutants have been isolated with impaired PS II activity and a characterization of in vivo photosynthesis from mutant and WT strains is presented. All of the mutants described in this report produce nearly WT levels of PS II in the thylakoid membrane. Non-conservative mutation at Asp-103 (DN103D1), Glu-104 (EQ104D1) or Glu-333 (EQ333D1) results in moderate (similar to 50%) inhibition of oxygen evolution, whereas mutation at Glu-65 (EQ65D1) or His-337 (HF337D1) results in cells that retain only 10 to 20% of WT activity. In vivo fluorescence induction kinetics are consistent with a lesion on the donor side of PS II in each of the mutants tested. We conclude that Glu-65 and His-337 are directly involved in binding manganese or calcium, and that Asp-103 and Glu-104 may be involved in calcium binding but are not manganese ligands.					95th Annual Meeting of the Deutsche-Bunsen-Gesellschaft-fur-Physikalische-Chemie on Primary Processes of Photosynthesis95th Annual Meeting of the Deutsche-Bunsen-Gesellschaft-fur-Physikalische-Chemie on Primary Processes of Photosynthesis	MAY 16-18, 1996MAY 16-18, 1996	Deut Bunsen Gesell Phys ChemDeut Bunsen Gesell Phys Chem	JENA, GERMANYJENA, GERMANY	2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0005-9021			WOS:A1996WB83300008

In this study we have grown such composites with a potentiostatic anodic/cathodic pulse-plating procedure and characterised them by a multi-technique approach, combining a suite of in situ and ex situ spectroscopic methods with electrochemical measurements. We have thus achieved a sound degree of molecular-level understanding of the hybrid co-electrodeposition process consisting of electropolymerisation of polypyrrole with incorporation of Mn. By in situ Raman spectroscopy we followed the formation of MnOx and the polymer by monitoring the build-up and development of the relevant vibrational bands. The compositional and chemical-state distribution of the as-deposited material has been investigated ex situ by soft X-ray fluorescence (XRF) mapping and micro-absorption spectroscopy (micro-XAS). XRF shows that the spatial distribution of Mn is consistent in a rather wide range of current densities (c.d.s), while micro-XAS reveals a mixture of Mn valencies, with higher oxidation states prevailing at higher c.d.s. Pyrolysis of electrodeposits, desirable for obtaining more durable and active catalysts, has been followed in situ by photoelectron microspectroscopy, allowing to assess the evolution of: (i) the electrodeposit morphology, resulting in a uniform distribution of nanoparticles; (ii) the chemical state of manganese, changing from a mixture of valences to a final state consisting of Mn(III) and Mn(IV) oxides and (iii) the bonding nature of nitrogen, from initially N-pyrrolic to a combination of pyridinic and Mn-N/graphitic.									21	0	0	0	3	0	21			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000361553100045

In this regard, development of high performance, stable, and cost-effective catalysts for full water splitting is highly demanded. In this work a high performance electrocatalyst based on commercially available Tin oxide nanoparticles mixed with carbon nanotubes (CNT) is presented for electrocatalytic water splitting. The catalyst prepared through facile dropped casting method and obtained a high electrocatalytic activity for full water splitting. One of the key important parameters in water splitting is producing hydrogen/oxygen at high rate under long term stability. This is problematic because it would result in catalyst degradation and performance fallen. However, herein, the prepared electrocatalyst demonstrated a high stability of more than 10 h operation under a high applied current density of 100 mA.cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction. For the both hydrogen and oxygen, the prepared catalyst (SnO2/CNT coated on carbon paper) delivered the current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) at a low overpotentials of 150 mV and 250 mV, respectively. Our observations validate the excellent capability in significantly modifying the catalytic activity of transition metal compound catalysts with carbon nanostructures. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

The obtained product morphology was explored by using surfactants like sodium lauryl sulfate (SDS) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). The structural, optical, vibrational and morphological properties were confirmed employing standard characterization techniques. Rectangular nanoflakes of the obtained product were confirmed by employing Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) studies. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern confirms obtained product crystalline nature. The better morphology controlled sample gives higher 227 mA/g current density at 10 mV/s and small 184 V overpotential. Long duration stability over 16 h was exhibited by Cu6Mo5O18 electrode. Hence, Cu6Mo5O18 electrode shows better electrochemical activity with stunning low overpotential. It would be suggested that PVP surfactant is quite optimum to produce efficient Cu6Mo5O18 catalysts for electrochemical water splitting applications. (c) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The approach involves late-stage fragment coupling of a tertiary-carbon radical and an electron-deficient double bond to form vicinal quaternary and tertiary stereocenters with high fidelity. A stereoselective Mukaiyama hydration is the key step in the subsequent elaboration of the cis-2,8-dioxabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-3-one moiety. This strategy was utilized in enantioselective total syntheses of (-)-macfarlandin C and (+)-dendrillolide A.

Impedance spectra between 1 to 100.000 Hz were measured under galvanostatic conditions. Electrolyte, polarization, charge-transfer resistance (R(D)), double-layer capacitance (C-D) and inductance (L) were determined.For a constant current density, fluoride causes an increase of C-D and a decrease of R(D). At a certain potential (measured and corrected by the electrolyte resistance) C-D nearly remains the same with and without fluoride, whereas R(D) is slightly increased by fluoride.This behaviour is explained by the double function of the fluoride: It is adsorbed on the anode surface and causes an increase of the real current density on the surface. Simultaneously, the evolution of oxygen is hindered by fluoride.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0932-0776			WOS:A1995TH42100019

However, unsatisfactory conversion efficiency still hinders its practical application. The introduction of external fields can remarkably enhance the photocatalytic performance of semiconductors from the inside out. This review focuses on recent advances in the application of diverse external fields, including microwaves, mechanical stress, temperature gradient, electric field, magnetic field, and coupled fields, to boost photocatalytic reactions, for applications in, for example, contaminant degradation, water splitting, CO2 reduction, and bacterial inactivation. The relevant reinforcement mechanisms of photoabsorption, the transport and separation of photoinduced charges, and adsorption of reagents by the external fields are highlighted. Finally, the challenges and outlook for the development of external-field-enhanced photocatalysis are presented.									109	3	0	0	11	0	109			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000612671500001	32770594

Materials were grown in a N-2 + O-2 atmosphere in the presence of water vapor, investigating the influence of growth temperature and total pressure on the system structural, compositional, morphological, and optical properties through a multitechnique characterization approach. The obtained alpha-Mn3O4 nano- deposits were ultimately tested as catalysts in the photo- electrochemical (PEC) splitting of water under simulated solar illumination, with particular focus on the interplay relationships between the adopted preparative conditions and the resulting functional performances. The amphoteric semiconducting behavior along with the PEC properties markedly dependent on the deposit nanoscale organization opens interesting avenues to an eventual implementation of the target materials in view of sustainable applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2574-0962			WOS:000500038900064

The as-prepared Co3O4/g-C3N4 composite delivers a high specific capacitance of 780 F g(-1) at the current density of 1.25 A g(-1) in 2 M KOH solution and the capacitance value retain 80% after 1000 cycles with the current density of 3 A g(-1). The capacitance of Co3O4/g-C3N4 composite is much greater than the bare Co3O4 with 419 F g(-1) at the current density 1.25 A g(-1). The investigation suggests that the excellent performance of capacitance may be assigned to as-prepared Co3O4/g-C3N4 composite, which could be a potential and outstanding electrode material in electrochemical energy storage devices.

We report the synthesis of hollow tungsten carbide/carbon sphere composites (HWCSs) with a thinner surface carbon layer and smaller particle size. The polystyrene sphere (PS) as a template and P123 as a surfactant favor the dispersion of carbon and WC precursors, leading to HWCSs with a smaller-sized WC and thinner surface carbon. The above factors in turn favor a stable loading of smaller Pt particles on HWCSs, resulting in excellent electrocatalytic activity (due to the synergistic effect) and stability (due to stronger interaction force between WC and Pt) of Pt/HWCS in electrocatalyzing methanol oxidation in acidic media. The present method is imagined to easily prepare other small-sized carbide particles with a thinner surface carbon layer.									14	2	0	0	0	0	15			2046-2069			WOS:000347410600072

To investigate this important phenomenon, a finite-element method is used to simulate the effect of 3-dimensional (3D) distributions of pores on the thermal transport in a nuclear fuel element consisting of uranium oxide (UO2) nuclear fuel pellet and Zircaloy cladding. Spherical pores ranging in size from 70 to 172 mu m are introduced to create up to 30 vol% total porosity. The simulations demonstrate that the centerline temperature increases with the total porosity and the increase is nonlinear. The results also show that the centerline temperature, at fixed total porosity, weakly depends on the pore size distribution. This method can provide useful information regarding the effect of high porosity levels that may occur in off-normal operation conditions.									3	1	0	0	0	0	4			0884-2914			WOS:000324328900013

The oxidation of Ti3SiC2 material resulted in the formation of TiO2 and SiO2, accompanying the evolution of CO or CO2 gases from the initial stage of oxidation. The oxidation resistance of Ti3SiC2 mainly owes the protectiveness of highly stoichiometric SiO2. During the initial stage of oxidation, the dominant reaction was the inward transport of oxygen into the matrix. As the oxidation progressed, an outer TiO2 layer and an inner (TiO2+SiO2) mixed layer formed. Between these layers and inside the oxide scale, numerous fine voids formed. Numerous, fine oxide grains formed at 900oC developed into the outer coarse TiO2 grains and an inner fine (TiO2+SiO2) mixed grains at the higher temperatures. The oxidation resistance of Ti3SiC2 progressively deteriorated as the oxidation temperature increased, forming thick scales above 1000oC. The outer coarse TiO2 grains formed above 1100oC grew rapidly mainly along (211).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1225-8024			KJD:ART000938549

The evolution of crystalline mullite is accompanied by a decrease in both the sialon z value and in the proportion of tetrahedral Al. The ratio of Si-29 in the SiO2 to Si-29 in the mullite oxidation products is about 4, consistent with the formation of Al2O3 as an additional oxidation product. The oxidation kinetics at 1100-1300 degrees C are described by a parabolic rate law with an activation enthalpy of 161 kJ mol(-1), suggesting the rate-determining step to be the permeation of oxygen through the oxidised layer coating the sialon grains.									34	5	0	0	0	0	37			0959-9428	1364-5501		WOS:A1997WP53400027

The gedrite is replaced by medium-grained magnetite, cordierite and anthophyllite. Plagioclase is zoned to more Na-rich compositions near the breakdown aggregates. The textures suggest the reaction: gedrite + quartz + plagioclase (An30-34) + O2 + CO2 - cordierite + anthophyllite + magnetite + plagioclase (An27-28) + H2O, which can be balanced to a high degree, using microprobe analyses. The system is considered closed, except for O2, CO2 and H2O. Gedrite breakdown is inferred to have proceeded at T = 527 - 560-degrees-C, P = 3 - 6 kbar and logfO2 between - 18.7 and - 21.2 and to be the result of an increase in oxygen fugacity and a high CO2/(H2O + CO2) ratio of the infiltrating fluid.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0028-3649			WOS:A1992JY45000005

It is stable in air up to similar to 400 degrees C beyond which it turns into the spinel. The oxide has a direct optical transition attributed to the crystal field splitting of Cu+, linearly coordinated. It exhibits p -type behavior due to O2- insertion in the layered lattice. Such property is corroborated by a cathodic photocurrent in the intensity-potential (J - E) plot and a negative slope of the capacitance potential (C-2 - E) plot. The latter traced in NaOH (0.01 M) electrolyte, exhibits a straight line from which a flat band potential of +0.411 V and a hole density of 6.9 x 10(23) m(-3) were extracted. An exchange current density of 7.36 mu A cm(-2) and a polarizarion resistance (6.69 k Omega cm(2)), derived from the semi-logarithmic curve (log(J) - E), indicate a good electrochemical stability with a medium hysteresis loop and a low H-2-over potential. The anisotropy of the 2 D dimensional crystal structure allows reversible oxygen insertion in the (0 0 n) planes evidenced from the (J - E) profiles. The Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements give two well-distinguished depressive semicircles in the dark. The diameter of the semicircle at high frequencies (1.49 k Omega cm(2)) decreases down to (1.28 k Omega cm(2)) under irradiation, a behavior typical of a non-degenerate semi conductivity of CuCoO2.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1369-8001	1873-4081		WOS:000706440600001

Here, we identified that anionic doping of the layered oxides for PIBs is effective to combat their capacity fading at high voltage (>4.0 V). Taking P2-type K2/3Mn7/9Ni1/9Ti1/9O17/9F1/9 (KMNTOF) as an example, we showed that the partial substitution of O2- by F- enlarged the interlayer distance of the K2/3Mn7/9Ni1/9Ti1/9O2 (KMNTO), which becomes more favorable for fast K+ transition without violent structural destruction. Meanwhile, based on the experimental data and theoretical results, we identified that the introduction of F- anions effectively increased the redox-active Mn cationic concentration by lowering the average valence of the Mn element, accordingly providing more reversible capacity derived from the Mn3+/4+ redox couple, rather than oxygen redox. This anionic doping strategy enables the KMNTOF cathode to deliver a high reversible capacity of 132.5 mAh g(-1) with 0.53 K+ reversible (de)intercalation in the structure. We expect that the discovery provides new insights into structural engineering for pursuing stable cathodes to facilitate the future applications of high-performance PIBs.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000787373300039	35266694

However, the development of catalyst with high activity and selectivity to methanol from the CO2 hydrogenation is still a challenge due to the chemical inertness of CO2 and its characteristics of multi-path conversion. Herein, a series of highly active carbon-confining molybdenum sulfide (MoS2@C) catalysts were prepared by the in-situ pyrolysis method. In comparison with the bulk MoS2 and MoS2/C, the stronger interaction between MoS2 and the carbon layer was clearly generated. Under the optimized reaction conditions, MoS2@C showed better catalytic performance and long-term stability. The MoS2@C catalyst could sustain around 32.4% conversion of CO2 with 94.8% selectivity of MeOH for at least 150 h.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1422-0067		WOS:000794529300001	35563618

While expensive catalysts and low energy conversion efficiency limited industrial application of this method. Herein, we reported a cost-effective and efficient water splitting electrocatalyst prepared by one-step thermo-selenation from readily available stainless steel foam. The activity of the synergistic multi-metal catalyst has been greatly improved, showing overpotentials of 237 mV and 263 mV for HER and OER, respectively, to achieve catalytic current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH.

In this review, the recent development in the fundamental understanding of photocatalytic NH3 synthesis and the methods of precise NH3 detection are summarized. More importantly the strategy for surface engineering and interface engineering of photocatalysts toward photocatalytic NH3 production has been thoroughly analyzed with the aim to stimulate critical thinking about the effective methodology for catalyst modification instead of exploring new materials. At the end the challenges and a few concerns are raised from the current reports and future perspectives in this research field are discussed targeting to clarify the reliability and reproducibility of the photochemical process and to direct the future research direction, such as flow reactor design and in-depth understanding of the underlying reaction pathway.									14	1	0	0	1	0	15				2633-5409		WOS:000616240100003

The performance was compared to a commercial Nafion 115 membrane of similar thickness. The cell equipped with Nafion - SZrO2 showed better performance at intermediate temperatures. The current densities were 2.7 and 2.2 A.cm(2) at a terminal voltage of 1.8 V for the composite Nafion - SZrO2 and Nafion 115, respectively, at 100 degrees C and atmospheric pressure. The superior performance of the composite electrolyte was due to the strong acidity and water affinity of sulfated zirconia nanoparticles used as filler. Operation at intermediate temperatures in a solid polymer electrolyte water electrolyzer appears useful for a better thermal management of the heat released at high current densities.									27	0	0	0	1	0	27			1452-3981			WOS:000302730000051		
J	Ateya, BG; Al-Kharafi, FM; Abdallah, RM; Al-Azab, A								Electrochemical removal of hydrogen sulfide from polluted brines using porous flow through electrodes								JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY				35	3			297	303		10.1007/s10800-004-7273-6				MAR 2005	2005	Carbon felt was used in porous electrodes to achieve electrochemical oxidation of sulfide ions from flowing chloride brines. Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), sulfur was identified as the final reaction product under various potentials and temperatures. While some of the resulting sulfur flows out with the electrolyte, the rest remains adsorbed on the graphite surface. The rate of the process and the removal efficiency increase with potential, temperature, flow rate and sulfide concentration. The measured limiting currents are substantially lower than those predicted from mass transfer correlations. This was attributed to the passivating effects of the sulfur deposited on the internal surface of the porous electrode. Potentiostatic current transients show that the carbon felt electrodes have higher capacity for removing sulfide ions than planar electrodes, which is attributed to the large internal surface area of the carbon felt.									25	2	0	0	10	1	27			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000227942700011

Considering that the fundamental aspect of antibiotic photodegradation is a free radical reaction on the catalyst surface, boosting the generation of surface active free radicals is a direct and effective approach to promote the surface antibiotic oxidation reaction. However, rational regulation of the surface free radicals of photocatalysts is still a big challenge, and has also been rarely investigated. Herein, surface defect engineering was employed to introduce two different surface defect structures (i.e., two-coordinated nitrogen vacancies (N-2C) on g-C3N4 and oxygen vacancies on TiO2) on the surface of a g-C3N4/TiO2 Z-scheme photocatalyst by one-step hydrogenation treatment, aiming to effectively modulate the surface active free radicals that directly dominate the surface redox reaction. The resulting defect-rich hydrogenated g-C3N4/TiO2 (H-CN/TiO2) Z-scheme heterojunction produced much more OH and O-2(-) free radicals on the surfaces of TiO2 and g-C3N4, respectively, which would greatly facilitate the surface redox reactions in photocatalytic processes. As expected, the H-CN/TiO2 Z-scheme heterojunction exhibited obviously improved activity in photodegradation of tetracycline hydrochloride compared with those of defect-free photocatalysts. Meanwhile, the effect of defect structures on the surface free radicals of the H-CN/TiO2 photocatalyst was well explored and the photocatalytic mechanism was also discussed. This work paves the way for the regulation of free radical formation via surface defect engineering to further improve the photocatalytic activities of Z-scheme heterostructures.									21	1	0	0	4	0	22			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000598674500013

However, the sluggish kinetics and demand of high anodic potential are the bottlenecks for half-the cell oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which severely hamper the overall conversion efficiency. Although transition metal oxides based electrocatalysts have been envisioned as cost-effective and potential contenders for this quest, nevertheless, their low conductivity, instability, and limited number of active sites are among the common impediments that need to be addressed to eventually enhance their inherent catalytic potential for enhanced OER activity. Herein, the controlled assembly of transition metal oxides, that is, Cu@CuO(x)nanoclusters (NCs, approximate to 2 nm) and Co@CoO(x)beaded nanoclusters (BNCs, approximate to 2 nm), on thiol-functionalized graphene oxide (G-SH) nanosheets is reported to form novel and highly efficient electrocatalysts for OER. The thiol (-SH) functionality was incorporated by selective epoxidation on the surface of graphene oxide (GO) to achieve chemically exfoliated nanosheets to enhance its conductivity and trapping ability for metal oxides in nanoscale dimensions (approximate to 2 nm). During the electrocatalytic reaction, overpotentials of 290 mV and 310 mV are required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)for BNCs and NCs, respectively, and the catalysts exhibit tremendous long-term stability (approximate to 50 h) in purified alkaline medium (1 mKOH) with no dissolution in the electrolyte. Moreover, the smaller Tafel slopes (54 mV/dec for BNCs and 66 mV/dec for NCs), and a Faradic efficiency of approximately 96 % indicate not only the selectivity but also the tailored heterogeneous electrons transfer (HET) rate, which is required for fast electrode kinetics. It is anticipated that such ultrasmall metal oxide nanoclusters and their controlled assembly on a conducting surface (G-SH) may offer high electrochemical accessibility and a plethora of active sites owing to the drastic decrease in dimensions and thus can synergistically ameliorate the challenging OER process.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000552740200001	32227539

For an improvement in the understanding of the structural factors required by the most active Fe sites, the role of geometric tilting in determining the activity of the FeO(6 )octahedron for water oxidation was investigated. The catalytic performance of the FeO6 octahedron in a series of crystalline structures, i.e., perovskites AFeO(3), spinel ZnFe2O4, and beta-FeOOH, was found to be negatively correlated with their octahedral tilting degree. This correlation was rationalized through the Fe-O covalency, which is reflected by the O 2p band center as well as the charge-transfer energy obtained from ab initio calculations. Thus, it was disclosed that FeO6 octahedral tilting alters the activity for water oxidation through changing the covalency degree of Fe-O bonds.									36	3	0	0	3	0	36			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000438653300016

The square wave and cyclic voltammetry measurements reveal the stepwise proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) oxidations of the active Mn-II-OH2 site to Mn-III-OH and then to Mn-IV=O and finally an electron transfer oxidation of Mn-IV=O to Mn-V=O species. The Mn-V=O species undergoes a rate-limiting O atom transfer to H2O to give a Mn-III-OOH2 species that, in turn, undergoes further oxidations to release O-2.									26	3	0	0	2	0	27			2155-5435			WOS:000379457300050

Favorable electronic structures and strengthened internal electric fields are important factors for the observed improvements in performance.

There is strong coupling between the kinetic parameters of the relevant branching-growth-anastomosis stochastic processes of the capillary network, at the microscale, and the family of interacting underlying biochemical fields, at the macroscale. A hybrid mesoscale tip cell model involves stochastic branching, fusion (anastomosis) and extension of active vessel tip cells with reaction-diffusion growth factor fields. Anastomosis prevents indefinite proliferation of active vessel tips, precludes a self-averaging stochastic process and ensures that a deterministic description of the density of active tips holds only for ensemble averages over replicas of the stochastic process. Evolution of active tips from a primary vessel to a tumor adopts the form of an advancing soliton that can be characterized by ordinary differential equations for its position, velocity and a size parameter. A short review of other angiogenesis models and possible implications of our work is also given.

In both media the Ce(IV) ions oxidised the ruthenium red to brown and, with excess of Ce(IV), decomposed the ruthenium brown irreversibly to product(s) with three weak absorption bands at 390, 523 and 593 nm. Only in HCIO4 did the decomposition product(s) appear to act as a stable O2 catalyst. Spectral evidence tentatively suggests that the active catalyst may be a hydrolysed Ru(IV) polymeric species. The rate of catalysis was proportional to the initial concentration of ruthenium red/brown and the activation energy was determined as 36 +/- 1 kJ mol-1 over the temperature range ambient to ca. 50-degrees-C. At temperatures greater than 50-degrees-C the O2 catalyst undergoes an irreversible thermal decomposition reaction.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			0956-5000			WOS:A1991EV99500015

Designing novel efficient and robust electrocatalysts with sufficient active sites and excellent conductivity is one of the key parameters for hydrogen production using water splitting devices. Recently, low-dimensional carbon materials have gained attention as metal-free catalysts for hydrogen production. Such nanostructures need to be engineered to improve their catalytic activity. Here, we designed and synthesized a B and N doped carbon nanostructure (CNS)-hBN heterostructure as an improved HER catalyst. The hBN layers on CNS could provide exposed defects and edges that act as active sites for proton adsorption and reduction. The composition, structure and chemical properties of the B and N doped CNS-hBN heterostructure were tuned to obtain excellent HER activity. Detailed morphological, structural and electrochemical characterization demonstrated that the synergistic effect rising from the interaction between B and N doped CNS and hBN structures contributes to enhance the electrocatalytic performances. To get more insight into the role of defects and doping, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the CNS-hBN heterostructure.									18	2	0	0	1	0	18			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000474160000008	31225850

Boronate Oxidation as a Bioorthogonal Reaction Approach for Studying the Chemistry of Hydrogen Peroxide in Living Systems								ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH				44	9	SI		793	804		10.1021/ar200126t				SEP 2011	2011	Reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide, are important products of oxygen metabolism that, when misregulated, can accumulate and cause oxidative stress inside cells. Accordingly, organisms have evolved molecular systems, including antioxidant metalloenzymes (such as superoxide dismutase and catalase) and an array of thiol-based redox couples, to neutralize this threat to the cell when it occurs. On the other hand, emerging evidence shows that the controlled generation of ROS, particularly H2O2, is necessary to maintain cellular fitness. The identification of NADPH oxidase enzymes, which generate specific ROS and reside in virtually all cell types throughout the body, is a prime example. Indeed, a growing body of work shows that H2O2 and other ROS have essential functions in healthy physiological signaling pathways.The signal-stress dichotomy of H2O2 serves as a source of motivation for disentangling its beneficial from its detrimental effects on living systems. Molecular imaging of this oxygen metabolite with reaction-based probes is a powerful approach for real-time, noninvasive monitoring of H2O2 chemistry in biological specimens, but two key challenges to studying H2O2 in this way are chemoselectivity and bioorthogonality of probe molecules. Chemoselectivity is problematic because traditional methods for ROS detection suffer from nonspecific reactivity with other ROS. Moreover, some methods require enzymatic additives not compatible with live-cell or live-animal specimens. Additionally, bioorthogonality requires that the reactions must not compete with or disturb intrinsic cellular chemistry; this requirement is particularly critical with thiol- or metal-based couples mediating the major redox events within the cell.Chemoselective bioorthogonal reactions, such as alkyne-azide cycloadditions and related click reactions, the Staudinger-Bertozzi ligation, and the transformations used in various reaction-based molecular probes, have found widespread application in the modification, labeling, and detection of biological molecules and processes. In this Account, we summarize H2O2 studies from our laboratory using the H2O2-mediated oxidation of aryl boronates to phenols as a bioorthogonal approach to detect fluxes of this important ROS in living systems. We have installed this versatile switch onto organic and inorganic scaffolds to serve as "turn-on" probes for visible and near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence, ratiometric fluorescence, time-gated lanthanide luminescence, and in vivo bioluminescence detection of H2O2 in living cells and animals. Further chemical and genetic manipulations target these probes to specific organelles and other subcellular locales and can also allow them to be trapped Intracellularly, enhancing their sensitivity. These novel chemical tools have revealed fundamental new biological insights into the production, localization, trafficking, and in VIVO roles of H2O2 in a wide variety of living systems, including immune, cancer, stem, and neural cell models.									596	17	0	0	233	0	602			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000296075300015	21834525

In this work, we found that Co(Td)(2+)in Co(3)O(4)is capable of chemical adsorption for acidic organic molecules, and Co(Oh)(3+)play a decisive role in HMF oxidation. Thereafter, the Cu(2+)was introduced in spinel oxides to enhance the exposure degree of Co(3+)and to boost acidic adsorption and thus to enhance the electrocatalytic activity for HMF electrooxidation significantly.									96	1	0	0	8	0	95			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000563132200001	32705755

However, it is still a huge challenge to introduce enough defects into carbon-based materials to improve their catalytic activity. Herein, we report a new method for defect generation by the pyrolysis of the sulfur-nitrogen-containing coordination polymer [Zn(ptt)(2)](n) (ptt = 1-phenyl-1H-tetrazole-5-thiol). A series of controlled experiments clearly demonstrates that the carbothermal reduction reaction of zinc sulfide with carbon at a high temperature plays an important role in creating defects and enhancing the catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of the carbon-based materials. The ZnS/C-1100 with a high content of defects and a small number of ZnS nanoparticles exhibits excellent ORR electrocatalytic performances in alkaline media, in which the half-wave potential (0.894 V vs. RHE), stability, and methanol tolerance are all superior to that of a 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, the ZnS/C-1100 driven ZAB (zinc air battery) exhibits a stable discharge at 10 mA, a peak power density of 134 mW cm(-2) and a cathode current density of 265 mA cm(-2), which are significantly better than that catalyzed by 20 wt% Pt/C under the same conditions. This research not only develops a new highly active catalyst, but also provides a new method for the preparation of defect-rich carbon materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000855861700001	36129320

In this work, we determined that nitrogen vacancies (NVs) in graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) could enhance photocatalytic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. The as-prepared N-deficient g-C3N4 samples (CNx) exhibited superior conversion efficiency and excellent product selectivity than pristine gC(3)N(4) upon visible light irradiation. By combining experimental characterizations and density functional theory calculations, the NVs in g-C3N4 could significantly boost carrier separation and act as specific sites to enhance the adsorption and activation of reactants. Thus, our work could provide insight into the pathways of reaction between defects and reactants, and point out a feasible strategy for green fine chemical production.

Nanocasting mesoporous earth-abundant materials and their composite materials offer opportunities to make electrochemically active materials that allow scalable production and cost-effectiveness. Recently, due to their intrinsic open pore structure as well as high surface areas, various mesoporous cobalt-based ordered materials have been applied to electrocatalysis, rechargeable batteries, and supercapacitors. In this review, we have critically evaluated the advancements made specifically in three- and two-dimensionally (3D/2D) electrode Co-based materials (oxides, nitrides, phosphides, and sulfides). We outline foreseeable challenges and issues for the utilization of mesostructured cobalt-based electrode materials. This review also provides guidelines for further work to those who work on energy-related applications of mesoporous cobalt-based materials.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000538233100001

Heteroatom-doped carbon materials are receiving increased attention in research as effective catalysts. However, the uncontrolled doping of heteroatoms into a carbon matrix tends to inhibit the activity of a catalyst. Here, the in situ activation of a uniquely structured nitrogen-doped carbon/Ni composite catalyst for the ORR is demonstrated. This well-designed catalyst is composed of a nitrogen-doped carbon shell and embedded metallic nickel. The embedded Ni nanoparticles, dispersed on stable alumina with a high specific surface area for protecting them from agglomeration and in an unambiguous composite structure, are electron-donating and are shielded by the nitrogen-doped carbon from oxidation/dissolution in harsh environments. The electronic structure of the nitrogen-doped carbon shell is modulated by the transfer of electrons at the interface of nitrogen-doped carbon-Ni heterojunctions owing to the Mott-Schottky effect. The electrochemically active surface area result implies that the active sites do not relate to Ni directly and the enhanced catalytic activity mainly arises from the modulation of nitrogen-doped carbon by nickel. XPS and theoretical calculations suggest that the donated electrons are transferred to pyridinic N primarily, which ought to enhance the catalytic activity intrinsically. Benefiting from these transferred electrons, the half-wave potential of the nitrogen-doped carbon/Ni composite catalyst is 94mV positively shifted compared to the Ni-free sample.									36	1	0	0	5	0	37			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000417305000021	28906066

In pre-stellar molecular clouds, widely dispersed microscopic dust particles contain approximately a dozen refractory minerals that represent the starting point of planetary mineral evolution. Gravitational clumping into a protoplanetary disk, star formation, and the resultant heating in the stellar nebula produce primary refractory constituents of chondritic meteorites, including chondrules and calcium-aluminum inclusions, with similar to 60 different mineral phases. Subsequent aqueous and thermal alteration of chondrites, asteroidal accretion and differentiation, and the consequent formation of achondrites results in a mineralogical repertoire limited to similar to 250 different minerals found in unweathered meteorite samples.Following planetary accretion and differentiation, the initial mineral evolution of Earth's crust depended on a sequence of geochemical and petrologic processes, including volcanism and degassing, fractional crystallization, crystal settling, assimilation reactions, regional and contact metamorphism, plate tectonics, and associated large-scale fluid-rock interactions, These processes produced the first continents with their associated granitoids and pegmatites, hydrothermal ore deposits, metamorphic terrains, evaporites, and zones of surface weathering, and resulted in an estimated 1500 different mineral species. According to some origin-of-life scenarios, a planet must progress through at least some of these stages of chemical processing as a prerequisite for life.Biological processes began to affect Earth's surface mineralogy by the Eoarchean Era (similar to 3.85-3.6 Ga), when large-scale Surface mineral deposits, including banded iron formations, were precipitated under the influences of changing atmospheric and ocean chemistry. The Paleoproterozoic "Great Oxidation Event" (similar to 2.2 to 2.0 Ga), when atmospheric oxygen may have risen to >1% of modern levels, and the Neoproterozoic increase in atmospheric oxygen, which followed several major glaciation events, ultimately gave rise to multicellular life and skeletal biomineralization and irreversibly transformed Earth's surface mineralogy. Biochemical processes may thus be responsible, directly or indirectly, for most of Earth's 4300 known mineral species.The stages of mineral evolution arise from three primary mechanisms: (1) the progressive separation and concentration of the elements from their original relatively uniform distribution in the pre-solar nebula; (2) an increase in range of intensive variables such as pressure, temperature, and the activities of H2O, CO2, and O-2; and (3) the generation of far-from-equilibrium conditions by living systems. The sequential evolution of Earth's mineralogy from chondritic simplicity to Phanerozoic complexity introduces the dimension of geologic time to mineralogy and thus provides a dynamic alternate approach to framing, and to teaching, the mineral sciences.									379	21	1	0	115	0	398			0003-004X	1945-3027		WOS:000261072500001

Herein, a simple hydrothermal one-step method is exploited to successfully synthesize Co3O4-NiCo2O4 anchored on N-doped reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (Co3O4-NiCo2O4/N-RGO). The active sites present in Co3O4-NiCo2O4/N-RGO and the synergy between N-RGO and Co3O4-NiCo2O4 accelerate the charge transfer and transport rate during the electrochemical course, which improves the ORR/OER activities of the Co3O4-NiCo2O4/N-RGO electrocatalyst. As expected, the Co3O4-NiCo2O4/N-RGO exhibits a better half-wave potential in the ORR and a lower Tafel slope during the OER process. A ZAB with optimal Co3O4-NiCo2O4/N-RGO as the cathode gives a higher open-circuit voltage (1.49 V), larger power density (97 mW cm(-2)), and better stability (180 h).									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000626769200077

By using an acetylacetonate modifier to stabilize the hydrolysed titanium alkoxide and by omitting a catalyst, gels were produced in all cases. Transmission electron microscopy and EDX analysis confirmed the high dispersion of iridium in the dried gel material on the nanometre scale. The images also show spherical cage features up to 20 nm in diameter. High mass losses of the gels in the TGA scans suggested low degrees of hydrolysis of the acetate precursor, but calcination gave a crystalline, mixed oxide (TixIr1-xO2) solid solution. The precursor is also soluble in ethanol, which provides a slightly modified route to similar materials.									11	0	1	0	0	0	11			0928-0707	1573-4846		WOS:000255033500002

Here, two enrichment cultures of Fe(II)-oxidizing photoautotrophs and a culture of the genus Thiodicryon were studied with respect to their ability to fractionate Fe isotopes. Fe isotope fractionations produced by both the enrichment cultures and the Thiodictyon culture were relatively constant at early stages of the reaction progress, where the Fe-56/Fe-54 ratios of poorly crystalline hydrous ferric oxide (HFO) metabolic products were enriched in the heavier isotope relative to aqueous ferrous iron (Fe[II](aq)) by similar to1.5 +/- 0.2parts per thousand. This fractionation appears to be independent of the rate of photoautotrophic Fe(II)-oxidation, and is comparable to that observed for Fe isotope fractionation by dissimilatory Fe(III)-reducing bacteria. Although there remain a number of uncertainties regarding how the overall measured isotopic fractionation is produced, the most likely mechanisms include (1) an equilibrium effect produced by biological ligands, or (2) a kinetic effect produced by precipitation of HFO overlaid upon equilibrium exchange between Fe(II) and Fe(III) species. The fractionation we observe is similar in direction to that measured for abiotic oxidation of Fe(II)aq by molecular oxygen. This suggests that the use of Fe isotopes to identify phototrophic Fe(II)oxidation in the rock record may only be possible during time periods in Earth's history when independent evidence exists for low ambient oxygen contents.

Ebonex-supported catalysts were prepared as arrays and screened combinatorially for activity and stability as bifunctional oxygen reduction/water oxidation catalysts. The highest activity and stability was found in the Pt-Ru-Ir ternary region at compositions near Pt4Ru4Ir1. X-ray near edge absorption spectra indicated a significant electronic interaction between the catalyst and the support, and a substantial increase in catalyst utilization was observed, even though the support surface areas were relatively low. Both Ebonex and Ti4O7 have short-lived electrochemical stability under conditions of oxygen evolution at +1.6 V vs. RHE in 0.5 M H2SO4. Current at these supported catalysts gradually decreases, and the decrease is attributed to loss of electronic conductivity. Ebonex and Ti4O7 are also thermally oxidized in air at temperatures above 400degreesC. In contrast, Ti0.9Nb0.1O2, which has a nondefective oxygen lattice, is quite resistant to electrochemical and thermal oxidation. Conditioning of Ti0.9Nb0.1O2-supported Pt 4 Ru 4 Ir 1 at positive potentials had little effect on the activity of the catalyst.

Here we use Se isotopic and abundance measurements of marine and non-marine mudrocks to reconstruct the evolution of the biogeochemical Se cycle from similar to 3.2 Gyr onwards. The six stable isotopes of Se are predominantly fractionated during redox reactions under suboxic conditions, which makes Se a potentially valuable new tool for identifying intermediate stages from an anoxic to a fully oxygenated world. delta(82)/Se-78 shows small fractionations of mostly less than 2 parts per thousand throughout Earth's history and all are mass-dependent within error. In the Archean, especially after 2.7 Gyr, we find an isotopic enrichment in marine (+0.37 +/- 0.27 parts per thousand) relative to non-marine samples (-0.28 +/- 0.67 parts per thousand), paired with increasing Se abundances. Student t-tests show that these trends are statistically significant. Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility of volcanic Se addition, these trends may indicate the onset of oxidative weathering on land, followed by non-quantitative reduction of Se oxyanions during fluvial transport. The Paleoproterozoic Great Oxidation Event (GOE) is not reflected in the marine delta(82)/Se-78 record. However, we find a major inflection in the secular delta(82)/Se-78 trend during the Neoproterozoic, from a Precambrian mean of +0.42 +/- 0.45 parts per thousand to a Phanerozoic mean of -0.19 +/- 0.59 parts per thousand. This drop probably reflects the oxygenation of the deep ocean at this time, stabilizing Se oxyanions throughout the water column. Since then, reduction of Se oxyanions has likely been restricted to anoxic basins and diagenetic environments in sediments. In light of recent Cr isotope data, it is likely that oxidative weathering before the Neoproterozoic produced Se oxyanions in the intermediate redox state Se (IV), whereas the fully oxidized species Se-VI became more abundant after the Neoproterozoic rise of atmospheric oxygen.

However, the role of the solvent remains poorly understood. In this study, the role of the solvent in furfural (FFA) conversion over a Co/CoOx catalyst supported on N-doped carbon nanotubes (Co/ CoOx @N-CNTs) was investigated. In water, cyclopentanone (CPO)/cyclopentanol was produced with high selectivity via Piancatelli rearrangement. In ethanol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFOL) synthesized via furan ring saturation was the major product. The presence of Bronsted acid sites (BASs) in water and the participation of four hydrogen atoms from water molecules promoted FFA conversion via the CPO pathway. By contrast, the absence of BASs in ethanol and the participation of three hydrogen atoms from ethanol molecules resulted in the THFOL pathway being dominant. Furthermore, both thermodynamic properties and oxygen vacancies were found to affect FFA conversion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000859490700003

A limiting factor that impedes the widespread application of the PEMWE is its reliance on the rarest elements, such as iridium and platinum. In order to optimize the device performance as well as to reduce the usage of rare elements, it is important but difficult to directly observe the reaction within the electrolyzer under working conditions. Thus, operando characterization methods are urgently needed to probe in real time the water electrolysis process during operation. In this perspective, we highlight the important role and summarize the recent advances of operando characterization methods in obtaining kinetic insights about PEMWEs. Based on the demands of kinetic optimization, an outlook of future characterization methods is given at the end.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1948-7185			WOS:000829303900001	35822838

In comparison with pure CoTiO3 and BiOBr, all the CTBB nanocomposites display enhanced photocatalytic performance toward dye decomposition. Particularly, CTBB-5 reveals the best photocatalytic efficiency for RhB removal with a K of 0.2030 min(-1), which is about 50.75 and 3.02-fold higher than that of pure CoTiO3 and BiOBr, respectively. The outstanding activity is further demonstrated by MO photodegradation. The dramatically enhanced activity can be attributed to the increased surface area and reduced recombination probability of charge carriers. Furthermore, CTBB-5 exhibits excellent stability after repetitively running four times. The h(+) and O-2(-) are identified as the dominating reactive species contributing to the oxidation reaction. Finally, a possible Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism is presented and analyzed in detail.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000724286200001

DSA electrodes have been used in many industrial fields such as chlor-alkali, electrochemical water treatment, water electrolysis, etc. This review paper summarizes the study on the applications using DSA electrodes published in the recent 5 years. It suggests that the researches are intensively required on effective screening of electrodes materials, optimal designing of electrode structures and economical manufacturing of large area electrodes. It is expected that these studies will contribute to the further research and development on advanced DSA electrodes. In addition, the enhancement of DSA electrodes significantly leads to expand the type of the application using electrochemical processes in industry.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1229-1935			WOS:000566949700001

The results show the conditions under which enhancement of film growth occurs as revealed from its formation and dissolution characteristics. The results also show the possibility of the electrochemical oxidation of formic acid by the thick oxide film on tungsten. The importance of this electrocatalytic process is the occurrence of oxidation without appreciable oxygen evolution. The galvanostatic oxidation of tungsten in HCOOH as a reducing agent can be considered as a novel method for the preparation of a class of oxides; oxidation with simultaneous partial reduction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-891X			INSPEC:3384995

Three main features such as high density of active sites, improved charge transfer, and optimized electronic configuration have positive effects on the elec-trocatalyst activity. In this context, understanding structure-composition-property relationships and catalyst activity is very important and highly desirable. Herein, for the first time, we present the design and fabrication of novel MOF-derived ultra-small Ru/RuO2 nanoparticles doped in copper/cobalt nitride (CuCoN) encapsulated in nitrogen-doped nanoporous carbon framework (NC) (Ru/RuO2/CuCoN@NC). For the synthesize of this nanocomposite, firstly bimetallic Cu-Co/MOF hollow nanospheres are prepared via a facile emulsion-based interfacial reaction method and used as the template for Ru ion doping (Ru-doped Cu-Co/MOF). Then, Ru-doped Cu-Co/MOF precursor during the carbonization/nitridation/cooling process converted to the Ru/RuO2/CuCoN@NC nanocomposite. Benefiting from the desirable composi-tional and structural advantages of more exposed active sites, optimized electronic structure, and interfacial synergy effect, Ru/RuO2/CuCoN@NC hollow nanosphere electrocatalyst demonstrates striking catalytic performances under alkaline conditions with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpoten-tials of 41 mV for HER and 231 mV for OER, respectively. Moreover, as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting, a two-electrode device needs a voltage of 1.51 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Comprehensive electrochemical studies show that the excellent electrocatalytic perfor-mance of the Ru/RuO2/CuCoN@NC hollow nanosphere could be attributed to the improved physical and chemical properties such as desirable compositional, catalysts uniform dispersion, structural advan-tages of more exposed active sites, optimized electronic structure, high electrical conductivity, and inter-facial synergy effect. This work paves a novel avenue for constructing robust bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Here we show a distinct mechanism of H2O2 photo-oxidation on haematite (alpha-Fe2O3) photoanodes. We found that the photocurrent voltammograms display non-monotonous behaviour upon varying the H2O2 concentration, which is not in accord with a linear surface reaction mechanism that involves a single reaction site as in Eley-Rideal reactions. We postulate a nonlinear kinetic mechanism that involves concerted interaction between adions induced by H2O2 deprotonation in the alkaline solution with adjacent intermediate species of the water photo-oxidation reaction, thereby involving two reaction sites as in Langmuir-Hinshelwood reactions. The devised kinetic model reproduces our main observations and predicts coexistence of two surface reaction paths (bi-stability) in a certain range of potentials and H2O2 concentrations. This prediction is confirmed experimentally by observing a hysteresis loop in the photocurrent voltammogram measured in the predicted coexistence range.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2041-1723			WOS:000446793900001	30301897

The observed sticking probability S shows a good correlation with theta(K), indicating that the alkali promotion is local in nature. The decay of S as a function of NO dose as observed with AES shows an anti-correlation with the evolution of the direct-inelastic scattering intensity as obtained with REMPI, which suggests that the alkali promotion proceeds within a single collision of impinging NO molecules with the surface. The decay of S as a function of NO dose is then simulated by introducing a reaction cross section. The evaluated reaction radius is almost equal to the covalent radius of a K atom. The alkali promotion is explained in terms of electron charge transfer from the alkali adatoms to the affinity level of NO molecules based on the adatom density of state around E(F).					3RD ISSP INTERNATIONAL SYMP ON DYNAMICAL PROCESSES AT SOLID SURFACES ( ISSP-3 )3RD ISSP INTERNATIONAL SYMP ON DYNAMICAL PROCESSES AT SOLID SURFACES ( ISSP-3 )	APR 20-23, 1992APR 20-23, 1992	MINIST EDUC SCI & CULTURE JAPAN; INOUE FDN SCI; NISHINA MEM FDN; INT SUPERCONDUCT TECHNOL CTR; FUJITSU; HITACHI; HOYA; IBM JAPAN; KAO; KAWASKI STEELMINIST EDUC SCI & CULTURE JAPAN; INOUE FDN SCI; NISHINA MEM FDN; INT SUPERCONDUCT TECHNOL CTR; FUJITSU; HITACHI; HOYA; IBM JAPAN; KAO; KAWASKI STEEL	TOKYO, JAPANTOKYO, JAPAN	6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0039-6028			WOS:A1993KM97500003

Various preparative conditions yield various patterns of performance and stability, as quantified by overpotentials eta 10 in steady-state electrolyses, maximum current densities jmax in dynamic voltammetry, surface roughness rf, and by overpotential increase, iridium loss, and jmax decrease after 100 h of operation, on the other hand. In other words, the system is highly flexible and can be adapted to specific constraints depending on the application chosen.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000806499100006

As a first step in understanding the mechanism for OER we carried out detailed Density Functional Theory (DFT) studies of the electronic structure of IrO2. We compared the electronic states and magnetic properties of IrO2 using several density functionals. We found that DFT with hybrid functionals (B3PW and PBE0) leads to a weak ferromagnetic coupling, although IrO2 has often been reported as nonmagnetic. We also found a magnetic ground state for RuO2, whose electronic structure is similar to that of IrO2. Ru-Ru antiferromagnetic interaction has been observed experimentally in nanoparticle RuO2. Further low temperature measurements are necessary to confirm whether a weak magnetism may occur below 20 K in IrO2. We also found that PBE leads to a better agreement with the experimental XPS spectra, compared with hybrid functionals and PBE+U.									59	1	0	0	5	0	60			1932-7447			WOS:000355495600034

The Si nano-particles were completely encapsulated by amorphous carbon shell. With this core-shell approach, the anodic performance of Si electrode for lithium cells has been improved on aspects of Si utilization and cycle retention, which seems to be indebted to the formation of stable electronic conductive network by an intimate contact between Si core and carbon shell. The capacity delivered by this electrode is, however, smaller than that of bare Si due to the presence of RF-derived carbon and electrochemically inactive silicon oxide that was generated during the carbonization process by a reaction between Si and oxygen from the RF gel. The evolution of cracks in the carbon shell after cycling is additional problem to be solved. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, at present there is a lack of systematic cytological research on the infection process and host-pathogen interactions. This study used a combination of various staining techniques and microscopy to observe the O. heveae infection process and the cytological changes in the infected leaves associated with host resistance response. The infection of O. heveae in the host developed through 5 crucial time points: conidia germination peak at 4 hours post infection (hpi), appressoria formation peak (8 hpi), penetration structure (primary haustoria) formation peak (15 hpi), secondary hyphae formation peak (24 hpi) and conidiophore formation peak at 5 days post infection. Prior to haustorium penetration into the host cells, the energy for the process came from conidium's own energy reserves. After the formation of pathogen's primary haustoria, in response to pathogen penetration, the rubber tree leaves initiated resistance reactions, including reactive oxygen burst and formation of calluses and papillae. Reactive oxygen species played an important role in the rubber tree-pathogen interactions. Low ROS levels in the rubber tree leaves allowed the development and penetration of O. heveae. In contrast, high levels of ROS and resultant oxygen burst prevent further pathogen expansion. The development of O. heveae infection in the host proceeded through 5 crucial time points, including the initial period of pathogen infection, latent period and post-infection period. In the leaves of rubber tree, an early phase of compatible host-pathogen interactions and later phase of incompatible interactions preserve the balance in the evolution of obligatory host-pathogen relationships.			白粉病是橡胶树生产中最重要的病害之一,是由粉孢属病菌Oidium heveae Steinm.引起。目前,对该病原菌在寄主中侵染行为及其与寄主互作的组织细胞学尚缺乏系统研究。本文利用显微技术,结合多种染色方法,观察了橡胶树白粉菌侵染橡胶树叶组织的细胞学变化及寄主的抗性反应。O. heveae在寄主上发育要经历5个关键发育时间点,即分生孢子萌发高峰(4 hpi)、附着胞形成高峰(8 hpi)、侵入结构(初生吸器)形成高峰(15 hpi)、次生菌丝形成高峰(24 hpi)、分生孢子梗形成高峰(5 dpi);分生孢子萌发侵入寄主前,其能量来自自身贮存的能量物质。在互作过程中,病原菌初生吸器形成之后,橡胶树叶组织开始出现明显的氧暴发、胼胝质和乳突等抗性反应,活性氧在橡胶树与病原菌互作中起到了重要的作用,当橡胶树叶片中活性氧积累较低时,有利于O. heveae的发育及入侵,活性氧积累较高时,则引发寄主氧暴发等以阻止病原菌进一步扩展。O. heveae在寄主上发育的5个关键发育时间点分别属于病原菌侵染前期、潜育期和侵染后期,橡胶树叶组织早期亲和互作与中后期非亲和互作保持了专性寄生菌与寄主间发育平衡的进化关系。						0	7	0	0	0	0	7			0529-1542			CSCD:5151133

These photoanodes are made of 1 cm(2) rectangular glass substrates, surface-covered by thin films of conductive fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO). Thin mats of titanium dioxide nanorods (TDNRs) have been deposited over the FTO surfaces. The TDNRs have then been sensitized by surface deposition of cobalt dodecahedral Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework (ZIF-67) metal organic framwork (MOF). ZIF-67 has been deposited using a two-step process: (i) deposition of cobalt hydroxide by chronoamperometry; (ii) in-situ transformation of cobalt hydroxide into ZIF-67 by chemical reaction with a solution of 2-methylimidazol. The amount of ZIF-67 has been adjusted by monitoring the duration of the electro-reduction step. The photoanodes have been characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy. The photoelectrochemical responses of the different photoanodes have been measured under chopped illumination conditions. Dark currents as high as 100-150 mu A/cm(2) and photocurrents of only 10-15 mu A/cm(2) have been measured on fresh samples with large MOF contents, at an operating potential of +1.0 V vs. saturated calomel electrode, 25 degrees C, under UV-Vis irradiation. No dark current and photocurrents close to 40 mu A/cm(2) have been measured on samples with low MOF contents. The dynamics of charge transfer leading to the formation of molecular oxygen has been analyzed by photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy to understand the interplay between the OER electroactivity and photo-electroactivity. It is shown that large MOF contents induce two contradictory effects: the first one (faster charge transfer kinetics) is desirable while the second one (faster charge recombination kinetics) is not desirable. Only limited MOF contents are beneficial to maximize the photocurrent density. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000524973600018

However, the MoS2 thin films are typically more resistive than their exfoliated and co-evaporation chemical vapor deposition based counterparts. The ability to modulate the electrical property of MoS2 thin films will have a significant impact on scalable device applications in electronics, sensors, and catalysis. Here, we report the tuning of electrical transport properties of large area MoS2 thin films with different oxygen plasma exposure times. The electrical transport measurements of the pristine and plasma treated samples reveal that with increasing oxygen plasma treatment, the resistance of the MoS2 thin films first decreases by almost an order of magnitude and then increases again. The x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements show that the S:Mo ratio continuously decreases with increasing plasma exposure time. For a short plasma exposure time, the resistance decrease can be explained due to the creation of sulfur vacancies leaving unsaturated electrons with molybdenum (Mo) atoms which act as electron donors. With increasing plasma exposure, more sulfur vacancies and hence more Mo atoms are created, many of which get converted to insulating MoO3 resulting in an increase in the resistance of the MoS2 thin film. The results presented here are a major step forward in realizing the overreaching goals of MoS2 thin films for practical device applications.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0003-6951	1077-3118		WOS:000538172600001

Anodic porous alumina with straight pore channels grown in a stable, self-ordered manner is formed on (001) oriented Al grain, while disordered porous pattern is formed on (101) oriented Al grain with tilted pore channels growing in an unstable manner. In this work, numerical simulation of the pore growth process is carried out to understand this phenomenon. The rate-determining step of the oxide growth is assumed to be the Cabrera-Mott barrier at the oxide/electrolyte (o/e) interface, while the substrate is assumed to determine the ratio beta between the ionization and oxidation reactions at the metal/oxide (m/o) interface. By numerically solving the electric field inside a growing porous alumina during anodization, the migration rates of the ions and hence the evolution of the o/e and m/o interfaces are computed. The simulated results show that pore growth is more stable when beta is higher. A higher beta corresponds to more Al ionized and migrating away from the m/o interface rather than being oxidized, and hence a higher retained O:Al ratio in the oxide. Experimentally measured oxygen content in the self-ordered porous alumina on (001) Al is indeed found to be about 3% higher than that in the disordered alumina on (101) Al, in agreement with the theoretical prediction. The results, therefore, suggest that ionization on (001) Al substrate is relatively easier than on (101) Al, and this leads to the more stable growth of the pore channels on (001) Al.

The role of neutrinos								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				644	2			1028	1039		10.1086/503891				JUN 20 2006	2006	One of the outstanding unsolved riddles of nuclear astrophysics is the origin of the so-called p-process nuclei from A 92 to 126. Both the lighter and heavier p-process nuclei are adequately produced in the neon and oxygen shells of ordinary Type II supernovae, but the origin of these intermediate isotopes, especially Mo-92,Mo- 94 and Ru-96,Ru-98, has long been mysterious. Here we explore the production of these nuclei in the neutrino-driven wind from a young neutron star. We consider such early times that the wind still contains a proton excess because the rates for nu(e) and positron captures on neutrons are faster than those for the inverse captures on protons. Following a suggestion by Frohlich and coworkers, we also include the possibility that - in addition to the protons, alpha-particles, and heavy seed - a small flux of neutrons is maintained by the reaction p( (nu) over bar (e); e(+)) n. This flux of neutrons is critical in bridging the long waiting points along the path of the rp-process by ( n, p) reactions. Using the unmodified ejecta histories from a recent two-dimensional supernova model by Janka and coworkers, we find synthesis of p-rich nuclei up to Pd-102, although our calculations do not show efficient production of Mo-92. If the entropy of these ejecta is increased by a factor of 2, the synthesis extends to Te-120. Still larger increases in entropy, which might reflect the role of magnetic fields or vibrational energy input neglected in the hydrodynamical model, result in the production of nuclei up to A approximate to 170. Elements synthesized in these more extreme outflows include numerous s- and p-process nuclei, and even some r-process nuclei can be synthesized in these proton-rich conditions.									205	5	0	0	2	0	209			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000238340100032

DIFFERENTIAL CONVERSION USING PERIODIC CELL-VOLTAGE CONTROL								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				139	5			1358	1366		10.1149/1.2069412				MAY 1992	1992	The effect of steady and periodic, step cell-voltage control on the selectivity of the reduction of nitrobenzene in a parallel-plate reactor was theoretically investigated. Under step cell-voltage control, the potential is continuously oscillated from a constant high to a constant low value. Nitrobenzene (NB) is electroreduced to the intermediate phenylhydroxylamine (PHA) which may undergo further electrochemical reduction to aniline (AN) or may rearrange chemically to form the desired product, p-aminophenol (PAP). A reactor model was developed which assumes a well-mixed core, mass-transfer boundary layers for NB and PHA at the cathode, concurrent hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution at the anode, and negligible migration transport. An analytic, stationary-state solution to the transient-diffusion equation within the boundary layers was coupled through the reaction kinetics to an analytic solution of the one-dimensional Laplace equation for electrolyte potential. Differential-conversion simulations were performed in which the homogeneous reaction (PHA --> PAP) need not be considered because its characteristic reaction time is large compared to both those of the other reactions and to the cycle time of the control. The best periodic cell-voltage control strategy employed in the simulations was found to produce a PHA selectivity 250% of that under steady control at the same cycle-averaged PHA production rate. Under periodic control, PHA selectivity was shown to increase asymptotically with decreasing cycle time; high-frequency operation lowered the depletion of NB and overabundance of PHA in the boundary layer which otherwise would occur during the high-polarization portion of the cycle. Decreasing the duty cycle (fraction of cycle time spent at high polarization) increased the PHA selectivity since smaller duty cycles resulted in-a higher NB concentration and a lower PHA concentration at the cathode surface, but simultaneously the PHA production rate decreased. Increasing the voltage of the high-polarization portion of the cycle kinetically favors the production of PHA over AN. An increase in the mass-transfer rate causes a like effect on the PHA selectivity and to a much smaller extent on the PHA production rate for any set of steady or periodic-control parameters. The differential-conversion results provide a basis for the control strategies used in integral-conversion simulations and experiments presented in Part Il of this work.									15	1	0	0	3	0	16			0013-4651			WOS:A1992HU22800031

In this research, density functional theory calculations are performed to screen a series of heteronuclear and homonuclear transition metal dimers anchored on nitrogen-doped graphene (M1M2@N6 and M1M1@N6, M-1, M-2 = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Mo) for NRR. Among them, heteronuclear CoMo@N6 is screened out as the most promising electrocatalyst because of its high selectivity, activity, and stability. This work not only predicts a promising electrocatalyst candidate for NRR, but also provides a useful guideline for the rational design of heteronuclear double atom catalysts.									10	1	0	0	1	0	11				2513-0390		WOS:000586458400001

The slag basicity has a significant influence on inclusion compositions in 304 stainless steels. The Al2O3 content in inclusions shows a slight increase tendency with the slag basicity of 1.9. The addition of CaO increases the slag basicity from 1.9 to 2.2, which is beneficial to the removal of inclusions while increasing the Al2O3 content in inclusions from roughly 20% to 40%. The low slag basicity lowers the Al2O3 content in inclusions to around 20% while resulting in a higher total oxygen (TO) at the ladle furnace (LF) end. A kinetic model of slag-steel-inclusion reactions is developed to simulate the effect of slag modification on inclusion composition using FactSage Macro Processing. Evolutions of slag, steel, and inclusions during the slag modification process are well predicted.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1611-3683	1869-344X		WOS:000592607800001

In this paper, the water starvation phenomena of a unit cell in a PEM electrolyzer stack are investigated. The voltage, current density and temperature distribution are investigated in situ with a segmented electrolyzer. The results show that the voltage of the middle and outlet regions is higher than the inlet voltage, which illustrates that water starvation could occur simultaneously in different regions of the electrolyzer. The water stoichiometries have an important effect on the voltage distribution, current density distribution and temperature distribution at 0.5 A cm(-2) and 60 degrees C. The electrochemical impedance spectra of different segments show that the cell resistance and charge transfer resistance gradually increase along the water flow direction when the water stoichiometry is 3. According to the flow regime map, the critical water stoichiometry for electrolysis is further discussed.									42	0	0	0	0	0	42			2046-2069			WOS:000349434600054

The results indicated two product ion peaks in the IMS spectrum of barbituric acid. The thermal decomposition of the barbituric acid sample was investigated by scanning the temperature of the injection port and analyzing the temporal evolution of the IMS peaks over elapsed time. It was found that the barbituric acid sample was not thermally decomposed in the injection port of the instrument. Experimental evidences were collected by changing the reactant ions, concentration of barbituric acid sample, and IMS cell temperature. The two observed peaks were then assigned to cationic form and oxygen protonated isomers of barbituric acid. The positions of the product ion peaks were explicated considering the dipole moments of the product ions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1469-0667	1751-6838		WOS:000620289300001	33563052

PSII is composed both of intrinsic subunits, such as D1, D2, and CP47, and extrinsic subunits, such as the manganese-stabilizing subunit (MSP). Previous work has shown that amines covalently bind to amino acid residues in the CP47, D1, and D2 subunits of plant and cyanobacterial PSII, and that these covalent reactions are prevented by the addition of chloride in plant preparations depleted of the 18- and 24-kDa extrinsic subunits. It has been proposed that these reactive groups are carbonyl-containing, post-translationally modified amino acid side chains (Ouellette, A. J. A., Anderson, L. B., and Barry, B. A. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95, 2204-2209 and Anderson, L. B., Ouellette, A. J. A., and Barry, B. A. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 4920-4927). To identify the amino acid binding site in the spinach D2 subunit, we have employed a biotin-amine labeling reagent, which can be used in conjunction with avidin affinity chromatography to purify biotinylated peptides from the PSII complex. Multidimensional chromatographic separation and multistage mass spectrometry localizes a novel post-translational modification in the D2 subunit to glutamate 303. We propose that this glutamate is activated for amine reaction by post-translational modification. Because the modified glutamate is located at a contact site between the D2 and manganese-stabilizing subunits, we suggest that the modification is important in vivo in stabilizing the interaction between these two PSII subunits. Consistent with this conclusion, mutations at the modified glutamate alter the steady-state rate of photosynthetic oxygen evolution.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4				1083-351X		WOS:000249455600029	17666402

Classical electrostatics would then suggest particularly strong dependencies at protruding defect sites like steps and kinks due to a local field enhancement. Here, we use first-principles density functional theory calculations that capture the capacitive charging of the electric double layer to analyze these dependencies for prototypical adsorbates at vicinal Pt(111) surfaces in an implicit aqueous electrolyte. This analysis confirms effective dipole-field-type dependencies but rationalizes why they can neither be estimated on the basis of accessible molecular dipoles nor the mere atomic-scale geometry of the adsorption site. The observed magnitude questions mechanistic analyses of surface catalytic reactions made on the basis of the prevalent computational hydrogen electrode approach that is agnostic to these potential-induced adsorption energy variations.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000820061500001

Therefore, growing heterogeneous materials on the surface of GDY is very attractive to achieve efficient energy utilization. Here, a simple method for the controllable synthesis of ultrathin charge-transfer complexes (CTs) of nickel with terephthalic acid nanosheets on GDY is reported. This catalyst shows record-high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with an overpotential of only 155 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline electrolyte. Density functional theory calculations reveals that a strong p-d coupling effect in the GDY-CT interface region enhances the overall electronic activity, resulting in fast reversible redox-switching with a low electron-transfer barrier. Experimental characterization confirms that GDY plays a key role in modulating the morphological and electronic structures to accelerate the OER rate. These findings are expected to contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for the realization of efficient hydrogen energy technologies.									23	2	0	0	2	0	24			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000617901900001

Initial adsorption results in a multilayer molecular film, which blocks both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and re-oxidation of the Ni by ambient oxygen. However, excess octanethiol can be removed by rinsing with ethanol, leaving behind a monolayer that continues to protect against re-oxidation but gives rise to an unexpected enhancement in the HER, with a greater enhancement for longer film formation times. The presence of an octanethiol monolayer on the surface was confirmed by spectroscopic observation of the CH(2), CH(3) and thiolate groups using infra red spectroscopy, while X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy demonstrated the effectiveness of the thiol layer as a barrier to surface oxidation. The electrochemically prepared octanethiol film impedes oxidation of the Ni in air more effectively than a film formed by immersion in a solution of octanethiol in ethanol.									16	0	0	0	2	0	16			1463-9076			WOS:000295578400008	21922091

Organic matter is made soluble at high temperatures and there is a threshold temperature for the same. The reaction involves an increase of nitrogen and oxygen, and a decrease of carbon contents. These variations reach a limit as the solubility of the organic matter progresses. The attack on inorganic sulfur is very fast, producing an initial leap as in the attack on organic sulfur, while the solubilization of organic matter is slower, because of which shorter times should be applied for the purpose of desulfurization.

ROS can be difficult to detect directly; however, they can be detected indirectly from the effects on oxidative stress biomarkers (OSB), such as glutathione (GSH), 3-nitrotyrosine, homocysteine, and cysteine. Moreover the reaction of transition metals with thiol-containing amino acids (for example GSH) oxidized by ROS can yield reactive products that accumulate with time and contribute to aging and diseases. The study of the interaction between OSB using functionalized nanoparticles (fNPs) has attracted interest because of potential applications in bio-sensors and biomedical diagnostics. A goal of the present work is to use fNPs to detect and ultimately quantitate OS in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells subjected to external stressors, e. g. nonionizing (light) and ionizing (gamma) radiation. Specifically, we are investigating the assembly of gold fNPs mediated by the oxidation of GSH in irradiated RPE cells. The dynamic interparticle interactions had been characterized in previously reported work by monitoring the evolution of the surface plasmon resonance band using spectroscopic analysis (UV-VIS absorption). Here we are comparing the dynamic evolution of fNP assembly using photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS). We expect that PAS will provide a more sensitive measure allowing these fNP sensors to measure OS in cell-based models without the artifacts limiting the use of current methods, such as fluorescent indicators.

Optical emission spectroscopy (OES) in the visible spectral range has been combined with infrared laser absorption spectroscopy (IRLAS). The experiments were carried out in order to analyze the dependence of plasma chemical phenomena on power and gas mixture at relatively low pressures, up to 50 Pa, and power values, up to 2 kW. The evolution of the concentration of the methyl radical, CH3, and of seven stable molecules, HMDSO, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, CO and CO2, was monitored in the plasma processes by in situ IRLAS using tunable lead salt diode lasers (TDL) and external-cavity quantum cascade lasers (EC-QCL) as radiation sources. To achieve reliable values for the gas temperature inside and outside the plasma bulk as well as for the temperature in the plasma hot and colder zones, which are of great importance for calculation of species concentrations, three different methods based on emission and absorption spectroscopy data of N-2, CH3 and CO have been used. In this approach line profile analysis has been combined with spectral simulation methods. The concentrations of the various species, which were found to be in the range between 10(11) to 10(15) cm(-3), are in the focus of interest. The influence of the discharge parameters power, pressure and gas mixture on the molecular concentrations has been studied. To achieve further insight into general plasma chemical aspects the dissociation of the HMDSO precursor gas including its fragmentation and conversion to the reaction products was analyzed in detail.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000384239200002

Among those, M-N-C catalysts with 4d and 5d transition metal (TM4d,5d) centers are much more durable and not susceptible to the undesirable Fenton reaction, especially compared with 3d transition metal based ones. However, the ORR activity of these TM4d,5d-N-C catalysts is still far from satisfactory; thus far, there are few discussions about how to accurately tune the ligand fields of single-atom TM4d,5d sites in order to improve their catalytic properties. Herein, we leverage single-atom Ru-N-C as a model system and report an S-anion coordination strategy to modulate the catalyst's structure and ORR performance. The S anions are identified to bond with N atoms in the second coordination shell of Ru centers, which allows us to manipulate the electronic configuration of central Ru sites. The S-anion-coordinated Ru-N-C catalyst delivers not only promising ORR activity but also outstanding long-term durability, superior to those of commercial Pt/C and most of the near-term single-atom catalysts. DFT calculations reveal that the high ORR activity is attributed to the lower adsorption energy of ORR intermediates at Ru sites. Metal-air batteries using this catalyst in the cathode side also exhibit fast kinetics and excellent stability.									25	1	0	0	2	0	25			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000766221400024	35089019

Despite significant efforts to date, it is still a challenge to achieve photoelectrode with superior performance and long-term stability. Many bismuth-based semiconductor materials have demonstrated excellent visible light harvesting capability and suitable band edge for water splitting. Herein, we summarized the latest studies conducted on bismuth-based photoelectrodes for photoelectrochemical water splitting. Specifically, photoelectrochemical properties of copper bismuth oxide (CuBi2O4), bismuth ferrites (BiFeO3, Bi2Fe4O9), bismuth vanadate (BiVO4), bismuth tungstate (Bi2WO6), bismuth molybdate (Bi2MoO6) and bismuth oxyhalids (BiOX, X = I, Cl, Br) are presented. Strategies to achieve high stability and photolectrochemical performance were discussed in the aspects of nanostructure formation, heterostructure assembly, practical defect engineering, preferential facet growth and oxygen evolution catalyst incorporation.

The penta-twinned NWs possess a combination of ultrahigh mechanical strength, large surface-to-volume ratios and an abundance of undercoordinated adsorption sites, all desirable for CO2 electroreduction. In particular, we show that the penta-twinned Cu NWs can withstand elastic strains orders of magnitude higher than their conventional counterpart, and as a result their CO2 electroreduction activities can be significantly enhanced by elastic tensile strains. With a moderate tensile strain, the bias potential for methane production at a decent current density (2 mA cm(-2)) can be reduced by 50%. On the other hand, the competing hydrogen evolution reaction can be suppressed by the tensile strains. The presence of H at the NW surface is found to have a minor effect on CO2 electroreduction. Finally, we propose to use graphene as a substrate to stretch deposited Cu NWs.									56	3	0	0	6	0	57			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000365225300017	28757974

Cyclic voltammetry of the polyamines was conducted in pH 10 carbonate buffer. Well-resolved oxidation waves with respect to the background signal were observed, and the current-potential curves exhibited a scan rate dependence characteristic of slow desorption kinetics of the polyamine oxidation product. E-1/2's of similar to+ 0.88 V vs Ag/AgCl were measured for all five polyamines. A mechanism is proposed whereby the polyamine oxidation occurs by oxygen transfer from reactive OH radicals. These radicals are produced during the initial stage of oxygen evolution at the nondiamond carbon impurity sites. These sites are believed to be located primarily at the grain boundaries, isolated from one another by the diamond microcrystallites, although the impurities could also exist as extended defects within the lattice. Stabilization of the polyamine prior to oxidation is achieved through adsorption/complexation of the amine functionality with surface boron dopant atoms, also clustered at the grain boundaries. In general, the FIA results demonstrated that the diamond can be used to effectively detect all five polyamines with a concentration limit of quantitation of similar to 1 mu M (S/N greater than or equal to 3) and a linear dynamic range from 10(-3) to 10(-6) M (r(2) > 0.97), These detector figures of merit were achieved at constant potential without prior derivatization. Lower quality rather than higher quality diamond films are needed for this assay, and the requisite film properties can be introduced by judicious choice of the deposition conditions.									140	3	1	0	26	2	146			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000079124100015

All the prepared samples were analysed using XRD, FESEM, TEM and XPS spectroscopy for various structural and surface features. Further, absorbance (UV-visible) and photo-luminescence (PL) spectroscopy revealed the bandgap narrowing and emission quenching, respectively as a result of doping and formation of heterojunction. Ca doped NaNbO3-C3N4 sample exhibited almost 100% photodegradation of methylene blue (MB) dye in 4 h. Here, the superoxide anion radical has been found as the active reactive oxidative species (ROS). Further, being a visible active catalyst, photocatalytic H-2 evolution has also been studied through water splitting under solar irradiations in which H-2 yield of 0.01, 0.03, 0.09 and 0.29 mmol (in 1 h) was observed using bare NaNbO3, Ca-NaNbO3, and their respective heterostructures, respectively. Modified oxygen vacancies and synergistic interracial interaction have induced such a noteworthy photocatalytic H-2 evolution ability of as-prepared heterostructure with 3.45 mmol H-2 yield 4 h of exposure.									29	1	0	0	2	0	30			0038-092X			WOS:000471087200042		
J	Terwilliger, NB; Dangott, L; Ryan, M								Cryptocyanin, a crustacean molting protein: Evolutionary link with arthropod hemocyanins and insect hexamerins								PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA				96	5			2013	2018		10.1073/pnas.96.5.2013				MAR 2 1999	1999	Cryptocyanin, a copper-free hexameric protein in crab (Cancer magister) hemolymph, has been characterized and the amino acid sequence has been deduced from its cDNA It is markedly similar in sequence, size, and structure to hemocyanin, the copper-containing oxygen-transport protein found in many arthropods. Cryptocyanin does not bind oxygen, however, and lacks three of the six highly conserved copper binding histidine residues of hemocyanin. Cryptocyanin has no phenoloxidase activity, although a phenoloxidase is present in the hemolymph, The concentration of cryptocyanin in the hemolymph is closely coordinated with the molt cycle and reaches levels higher than hemocyanin during premolt, Cryptocyanin resembles insect hexamerins in the lack of copper, molt cycle patterns of biosynthesis, and potential contributions to the new exoskeleton. Phylogenetic analysis of sequence similarities between cryptocyanin and other members of the hemocyanin gene family shows that cryptocyanin is closely associated with crustacean hemocyanins and suggests that cryptocyanin arose as a result of a hemocyanin gene duplication. The presence of both hemocyanin and cryptocyanin in one animal provides an example of how insect hexamerins might have evolved from hemocyanin. Our results suggest that multiple members of the hemocyanin gene family-hemocyanin, cryptocyanin, phenoloxidase, and hexamerins-may participate in two vital functions of molting animals, oxygen binding and molting. Cryptocyanin may provide important molecular data to further investigate evolutionary relationships among all molting animals.									78	3	0	0	76	0	82			0027-8424			WOS:000078956600039	10051586

Here, we report a self-regenerable PM sensor using a proton conductive solid electrolyte and an active working electrode for PM oxidation. The withstanding voltage capability of BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-delta was greatly improved by the growth of a dense Zr1-xYxP2O7 film on the electrolyte surface. The reaction of PM with active oxygen under anodic polarization was further enhanced by the addition of IrO2 to the working electrode. As a result of these combined modifications, when the working electrode was anodically polarized, PM was oxidized to CO2 according to a four-electron reaction (C + 2H(2)O -> CO2 + 4H(+) + 4e(-)) while remaining below the self-ignition temperature. This amperometric sensor successfully produced a current signal corresponding to the quantity of PM in a gas stream at an operating temperature of 300 degrees C. These results demonstrate that the sensor can carry out continuous monitoring of PM concentrations while self-regenerating. (C) The Author(s) 2016. Published by ECS.

Herein, a facile one-step hydrothermal method is utilized to fabricate CoWO4/CoP2 nanoflakes (CTCP) on carbon nanotube film (CNTF), which constructs self-supported CTCP/CNTF composite electrocatalyst for water splitting. Benefitting from the well-configured structure, CTCP/CNTF possesses more active sites for reactions along with quicker interfacial charge transfer and better electrical conductivity. Meanwhile, embedding CoP2 in CoWO4 yields obvious synergistic effect to improve the intrinsic catalytic activity for OER and HER. In 1.0 M KOH, the optimized CTCP/CNTF-3 electrode requires a low overpotential of 252 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) (anodic current density) for OER, and 133 mV at -10 mA cm(-2) (cathodic current density) for HER. When employing CTCP/CNTF as both anode and cathode, the cell voltage for overall water splitting is only 1.605 V at j(cell) = 10 mA cm(-2), which value is extremely close to that of Pt/C/CNTF (-) // RuO2/CNTF (+). Remarkably, the electrolyzer (CTCP/CNTF(-) // CTCP/CNTF(+)) shows better stability for water splitting than Pt/C/CNTF (-) // RuO2/CNTF (+) over a duration of 32 h at j(cell) = 10 mA cm(-2).									14	1	0	0	0	0	15			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000523185200019

The thermal stability of obtained systems was significantly enhanced by compatibilizer both in oxidative and inert atmosphere. The thermoanalytical methods (TG-FTIR and TG-MS) were used for identification of gaseous products of degradation. The results showed less intensive evolution of formaldehyde and formic acid during the thermal degradation of POM/TPU/OMMT nanocomposites. Both formaldehyde and formic acid had an autocatalytic effect on degradation of neat POM and POM/MMT nanocomposites, especially in the initial stage of the process. However, in the presence of TPU the monomer formed in depolymerization reaction was captured most probably by urethane linkage in a formylation process. The decreased concentration of catalytic agent is considered as a cause of the reduced rate of mass loss of POM/TPU/OMMT nanocomposites. Interestingly, during thermooxidative degradation the temperature of maximum rate of mass loss was shifted towards higher temperature more than it could be anticipated from the TGA results obtained for neat POM. POM/TPU blend and POM/OMMT nanocomposite material with corresponding contents of nanofiller and compatibilizer. It is likely that the mechanism of thermal stabilization may be also related to the physical barrier effect of layered silicate towards oxygen diffusion. Both chemical and physical mechanisms of stabilization are referred to the structure and interfacial area developed in nanocomposite materials and thus can be influenced by addition of a compatibilizer.The obtained POM/TPU/OMMT nanocomposites revealed higher impact strength as compared to POM/OMMT materials due to the presence of elastomeric domains facilitating the dissipation of impact energy.

However, the preparation of highly dispersed nanodot electrocatalysts remains a challenge. Herein, we report the interlayer confinement synthesis of sulfur-doped carbon-coated Ir nanodots on reduced graphene oxide (Ir@S-C/rGO) as an electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. The Ir@S-C/rGO composite is derived from a guest/host precursor of dodecyl sulfate (DS-)/hexachloroiridate (IrCl63-) co-intercalated MgAl-layered double hydroxide on a GO support. The composite has these advantages: Ir nanodots (1.7 +/- 0.2 nm) with a low Ir amount of 6.2 wt%, S-doped carbonaceous encapsulation and a rGO support, as well as a large specific surface area of 194 m(2) g(-1) and meso-/macropore size distribution. The composite electrode requires overpotentials of 280 and 300 mV at 10 and 20 mA cm(-2), respectively, for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline conditions; and 20 and 35 mV at 10 and 20 mA cm(-2) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline conditions, respectively. Furthermore, a two-electrode electrolyzer yields a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.51 V for overall water splitting. Moreover, the density functional theory calculations show that the charge distribution of the Ir nanoclusters facilitates the enhancement of the electrocatalytic activity for the OER, and the sulfur-doped carbon lowers the work function of the Ir particles on graphene; both of which underpin the enhancement. Our guest/host-assisted interlayer nanoconfinement can promise an effective synthesis strategy for designing and preparing well-dispersed nanodots as promising electrocatalysts for water splitting.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000621407000035

However, the presence of O-2 hampers H-2 generation and most photocatalysts show a major drop in activity in air without synthetic modification. Here, we demonstrate efficient H-2 evolution in air, simply enabled by controlling O-2 diffusion in the solvent. We show that in deep eutectic solvents (DESs), photocatalysts retain up to 97% of their H-2 evolution activity and quantum efficiency under aerobic conditions whereas in water, the same catalysts are almost entirely quenched. Solvent-induced O-2 tolerance is achieved by H-2 generation outcompeting O-2-induced quenching due to low O-2 diffusivities in DESs combined with low O-2 solubilities. Using this mechanism, we derive design rules and demonstrate that applying these rules to H-2 generation in water can enhance O-2 tolerance to >34%. The simplicity and generality of this approach paves the way for enhancing water splitting without adding complexity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000695963300001

The effect of the concentration (activity) of Cl(-)anions was evaluated in NaCl solutions with variable concentrations in the range 0.0005-0.01 mol/L of the salt. To obtain a superhydrophobic coating, the metal surface was textured by IR laser radiation of nanosecond duration followed by chemisorption of MAF (methoxy-{3-[2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,8-pentadecafluorooctyl)oxy]propyl}silane from a solution of n-decane. The thickness of the superhydrophobic coating, including the textured metal layer and the adsorbed nanosize layer of the superhydrophobization agent (2-3 nm), was of the order of 100 mu m. The wetting angle is 168.8 +/- 1.5 degrees.The kinetic parameters of the hydrogen evolution reaction, accompanied by cathodic reduction of dissolved oxygen, and anodic ionization of the metal as a function of the acidity of the medium were obtained. With increasing duration of exposure, corrosion potential (E-cor) shifts to the region of more negative potentials and the most negative E-cor is observed at minimal HCl concentration. The steady state is achieved only after 120 hours and the corrosion potentials of the steel that corrodes in the active state assumes very negative values (-0.550 to -0.580 V) due to inhibition of the cathodic reaction.In media containing 0.0005-0.01 mol/L sodium chloride, the relationship between the kinetic parameters of the same electrode reactions and the activity of chloride ions (a(Cl-)) has been studied. The anodic reaction is accelerated and the corrosion rate of the steel increases with an increase in the activity of chloride ions (1.0 <= d lg i(a) / d lg a(Cl) <= 2, 1.0 <= d lg i(cor) / d lg a(Cl-) <= 1.3). This may be a consequence of the participation of halogen anions in the anodic process.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2305-6894			WOS:000453888800004

Z-scheme photocatalytic water splitting based on the two-step excitation of an oxygen evolution photocatalyst (OEP) and a hydrogen evolution photocatalyst (HEP) is a promising approach toward the utilisation of visible light. In particular, a photocatalyst sheet system consisting of HEP and OEP particles embedded in a conductive layer has been recently proposed as a new means of obtaining efficient and scalable redox mediator-free Z-scheme solar water splitting. In this paper, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the photocatalyst sheet approach compared to conventional photocatalyst powder suspension and photoelectrochemical systems through an examination of the water splitting activity of Z-scheme systems based on SrTiO3:La, Rh as the HEP and BiVO4:Mo as the OEP. This photocatalyst sheet was found to split pure water much more efficiently than the powder suspension and photoelectrochemical systems, because the underlying metal layer efficiently transfers electrons from the OEP to the HEP. The photocatalyst sheet also outperformed a photoelectrochemical parallel cell during pure water splitting. The effects of H+/OH- concentration overpotentials and of the IR drop are reduced in the case of the photocatalyst sheet compared to photoelectrochemical systems, because the HEP and OEP are situated in close proximity to one another. Therefore, the photocatalyst sheet design is well-suited to efficient large-scale applications. Nevertheless, it is also noted that the photocatalytic activity of these sheets drops markedly with increasing background pressure because of reverse reactions involving molecular oxygen under illumination as well as delays in gas bubble desorption. It is shown that appropriate surface modifications allow the photocatalyst sheet to maintain its water splitting activity at elevated pressure. Accordingly, we conclude that the photocatalyst sheet system is a viable option for the realisation of efficient solar fuel production.									28	1	0	0	1	0	28			1359-6640	1364-5498		WOS:000400580400023	28164191

The Gongchangling iron deposit is the only one large scale high-grade-iron ores in China, which is formed from low-grade BIFs by the alteration of later hydrothermal fluid, but its genesis is still controversial. In this paper,based on the previous studies,the new understandings on the ore-forming fluid properties and sources, mineralization, and the rich ore mineralization mechanism have been put forward, with the comparative study of the Fe, Si, O and S isotopes characteristics, spatial variations and geological characteristics of poor BIF ores,rich ores, alterated rocks and wall rocks in Anshan-Benxi area. The rich ore mineralization was associated with the hydrothermal activity caused by the crustal uplift and non orogenic magmatic intrusion after the Paleoproterozoic orogeny in Liaodong area (1. 85 Ga). The ore-forming fluid was formed by the meteoric water evolution or massive meteoric water was added during itself evolution. The ore-forming fluid at first is acidic and weak reductive, which leached the carbonate rich in ~(13) C,the gypsum rich in ~(34) S and CH_4 from the evaporate formation of the Liaohe Group. The iron activation and re enrichment is an important mechanism of the rich iron ore genesis in Anshan-Benxi area. The reaction of ore-forming fluid with poor BIF ore and wall rocks improved the iron activation and migration. The temperature decreasing and oxygen fugacity increasing or mixture with the meteoric water, which lead the magnetite precipitation with the Fe~(2+) oxidation. While the Fe~(2+) oxidation, the CH_4was also oxidized into graphite which precipitation with magnetite and formed the graphite-magnetite rich ore. And the SO_4~(2-) was reduced and the pyrite rich in ~(34) S has been formed.			辽宁鞍本地区是我国最重要的鞍山式沉积变质型(BIF)铁矿矿集区,弓长岭铁矿是我国唯一的由鞍山式贫铁矿经后期热液改造形成的大型磁铁富矿。本文在前人工作基础上,对比研究了鞍本地区贫铁矿、富铁矿和蚀变围岩的铁、硅、氧、硫同位素组成特征和空间变化规律,结合磁铁富矿的地质特征,对成矿流体的性质、来源、成矿作用和富矿成矿机制提出了新的认识。指出鞍本地区富铁矿的成矿作用与辽东地区古元古代造山运动结束后(1.85 Ga)地壳抬升引发的非造山岩浆侵入和热液活动有关,成矿溶液由大气降水演化形成,而非变质热液或混合岩化热液;成矿溶液淋滤了辽河群蒸发盐地层中富~(13)C碳酸盐、富~(34) S石膏、CH_4等成矿物质,成矿溶液具偏酸性弱还原特征;铁质活化再富集是鞍本地区富铁矿形成的重要机制,成矿溶液与贫铁矿及围岩反应使铁质以Fe~(2+)形式活化迁移。温度降低、氧逸度升高或与大气降水混合是溶液中Fe~(2+)氧化形成磁铁矿沉淀的主要原因;在Fe~(2+)被氧化形成磁铁矿的同时,成矿溶液中的CH_4被氧化形成石墨,与磁铁矿一起沉淀下来,形成含石墨磁铁富矿;溶液中SO_4~(2-)被还原形成富~(34)S黄铁矿。						9	13	0	0	0	0	19			0001-5717			CSCD:5309679

Oxidase reaction accompanies emission of toxic by-product reactive oxygen molecules including superoxide anion, and superoxide dismutase and catalase activities are essential to detoxify them in the peroxisomes. Although there is an argument about whether primitive life was born and evolved under high temperature conditions, thermophilic archaea apparently share living systems with both bacteria and eukaryotes. We hypothesized that alkane degradation pathways in thermophilic microorganisms could be premature and useful to understand their evolution.Results: An extremely thermophilic and alkane degrading Geobacillus thermoleovorans B23 was previously isolated from a deep subsurface oil reservoir in Japan. In the present study, we identified novel membrane proteins (P16, P21) and superoxide dismutase (P24) whose production levels were significantly increased upon alkane degradation. Unlike other bacteria acyl-CoA oxidase and catalase activities were also increased in strain B23 by addition of alkane.Conclusion: We first suggested that peroxisomal beta-oxidation system exists in bacteria. This eukaryotic-type alkane degradation pathway in thermophilic bacterial cells might be a vestige of primitive living cell systems that had evolved into eukaryotes.									14	0	0	0	13	0	14			1471-2180			WOS:000265847300001	19320977

Herein, a higher monomeric precursor for synthesizing improved micro-and electronic structure possessing g-CN was prepared by high-concentrated sulfuric acid (SA) treatment of bulk type g-CN (BCN). Several structural analyses show that after the SA treatment of BCN, the polymeric melon-based structure is torn down to cyameluric or cyanuric acid-based material. After re-polycondensation of this material as a precursor, the resulting g-CN has more condensed microstructure, carbon and oxygen contents than BCN, indicating that C, O co-doping by corrosive acid of SA. This g-CN shows a much better visible light absorption and diminished radiative charge recombination by the charge localization effect induced by heteroatoms. As a result, this condensed C, O co-doped g-CN shows the enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 4.57 mu mol/h from water under the visible light (>420 nm) by almost two times higher than that of BCN (2.37 mu mol/h). This study highlights the enhanced photocatalytic water splitting performance as well as the provision of the higher monomeric precursor for improved g-CN.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2073-4344		WOS:000609994900001

By functional screening in yeast, we identified a new member of the NDPK family, nm23-M5, which encodes a 211-amino acid protein with 86% identity to the human homolog Nm23-H5. Northern blot analysis revealed that nm23-M5 encodes two transcripts of 0.8 and 0.7 kb, which are highly and specifically expressed in adult testis. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that nm23-M5 transcripts first appear in pachytene spermatocytes and increase in abundance in subsequent stages. However, a low level of nm23-M5 mRNA was detected by RT-PCR in other tissues, such as ovary, brain, heart, and kidney. In situ hybridization studies showed that testicular nm23-M5 transcripts are localized in stage 12 to stage 16 spermatids in the neighboring lumen of seminiferous tubules. This distribution contrasts with that of Nm23-H5 transcripts, which are specifically found in spermatogonia and early spermatocytes. The heterologous expression of nm23-M5 in yeast cells confers protection from cell death induced by Bax, which is due to the generation of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, overexpression of nm23-M5 in fibroblasts altered the cellular levels of several antioxidant enzymes, particularly glutathione peroxidase 5. Thus, we believe that the murine nm23-M5 gene plays an important role in late spermiogenesis by elevating the ability of late-stage spermatids to eliminate reactive oxygen species.

Goodenough from Oxford to the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin). While most people will tend to retire, Goodenough transitioned to UT Austin at the age of 64 in 1986 and has been making phenomenal contributions during the past 35 years, with a genuine passion for science and profound impact on the society at large. To highlight a few, the contributions at UT Austin include the following: chemistry and physics of high-temperature copper oxide superconductors; battery electrodes and electrolytes, including polyanion family of oxide cathodes, niobium titanium oxide anode, and Prussian Blue cathode; alkali-metal plating/stripping; solid-state batteries; flow batteries; oxygen reduction/evolution reaction catalysts; and solid oxide fuel cell electrodes and electrolytes. Finally, what distinguishes Goodenough more than anything else is his unique personal attributes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000770129100001

Coal particles are injected along the centerline of a laminar flow flat flame burner, where a fuel-rich methane-air flame is used as a heat source, Volatiles released from the coal particles form a cloud of soot particles at high temperatures in the absence of oxygen. A carbon-coated microscope grid is briefly inserted into the soot cloud, where the temperature gradient between the soot particles and the cold grid surface causes the migration of soot particles and results in deposition. Soot particles are analyzed using transmission electron microscopy.; Distinct primary soot particles with approximate diameters of 25-60 nm are observed, along with agglomerates composed of multiple primary particles. Condensed, highly volatile, liquid-like deposits are observed in some cases, which are thought to be tar at some stage of secondary reaction. Coal-derived soot is also compared to thermophoretically collected butane soot.									29	5	0	0	0	0	34			0887-0624			WOS:A1995RW99100011

The optical spectra are used, together with the best available ionization correction factors, to calculate the abundances of Ar, C, Cl, He, N, Ne, and O relative to H. The infrared spectra are used to classify the PNe in two groups depending on whether the observed dust features are representative of oxygen-rich or carbon-rich environments. The sample contains one object from the halo, eight from the bulge, and eleven from the local disc. We compare their chemical abundances with nucleosynthesis model predictions and with the ones obtained in seven Galactic H II regions of the solar neighbourhood. We find evidence of O enrichment (by similar to 0.3 dex) in all but one of the PNe with carbon-rich dust (CRD). Our analysis shows that Ar, and especially Cl, are the best metallicity indicators of the progenitors of PNe. There is a tight correlation between the abundances of Ar and Cl in all the objects, in agreement with a lockstep evolution of both elements. The range of metallicities implied by the Cl abundances covers one order of magnitude, and we find significant differences in the initial masses and metallicities of the PNe with CRD and oxygen-rich dust (ORD). The PNe with CRD tend to have intermediate masses and low metallicities, whereas most of the PNe with ORD show higher enrichments in N and He, suggesting that they had high-mass progenitors.									50	0	0	0	0	2	50			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000355337500052

Individual oxide phase shows considerable compositional variation among textures and samples. These textures arguably developed by oxidation reaction of early spinel and ilmenite solid solution from near-peak to subsequent retrogressive stages. Oxygen fugacity is measured at a constant pressure of 8 kbar and different temperatures estimated from geothermometric analyses involving oxide and silicate-bearing equilibria in different samples. The calculated fO(2) values are 2-3 log units higher than the QFM buffer except for one sample. Uncertainties in fO(2) calculation in some samples arise presumably due to extensive compositional readjustment of different oxide systematics at lower temperatures. The persistence of high fO(2) in mineral assemblages could be inherited from an oxidized precursor, but field evidence and presence of H2O-CO2-rich fluid inclusions in the studied samples imply possible involvement of externally-derived oxidizing fluid in the later part of the retrograde history. Recent experimental and natural data suggest CO2 charged brine solution could be suitable for oxidation of mineral assemblages. Presence of brine inclusions are not detected, but fluorine enriched nature of biotite grains could possibly provide some indication for its presence. The mixed fluid possibly has its source in the crystallizing mafic magma emplaced at the lower crust that is exposed in the adjacent area. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In the northern Bowen Basin, the oxygen isotope compositions of the mixed-layer illite/smectite show significant irregular variations with respect to depth, which parallel the changes in the extent of the illitisation reaction and are interpreted as reflecting changes in water/rock ratio in turn related to permeability. The delta(18)O and delta D values of illite-smectite and kaolinite in the northern Bowen Basin and the calculated fluid isotopic composition (delta(18)O = -3%, to +1%; delta D = -70% to -90%) in equilibrium with these clays are considerably lower than those typically reported for deeply buried sedimentary basins. These stable isotope data, together with relatively high inferred palaeotemperatures (up to 235 degrees C) and abnormally high geothermal gradients are consistent with a hydrothermal origin for clay mineral formation in the northern Bowen Basin. The hydrothermal system is interpreted to be a result of the Late Triassic extensional tectonic regime, which developed in large parts of eastern Australia and affected the northern part of the Bowen Basin. In the southern Bowen Basin, by contrast, clays are more enriched in O-18 and deuterium, which is explained by lower temperatures (in the shallow coal measures) and a significant enrichment in the fluid isotopic composition (delta(18)O = -3.6% to +5.6%, delta D = -66% to -35%) under low water/rock ratio conditions, especially in deeper pelitic rocks.

A family of alkylammonium hydrogen sulfate ILs, which are different in the number of alkyl chain, is investigated with the aim to compare their effects on the electrochemical behavior of Pb-Sb-Sn alloy in sulfuric acid solution. The hydrogen and oxygen gas evolution potential and anodic layer characteristics were investigated employing cyclic and linear sweep voltammetric methods. The morphological changes of the PbSO4 layer that formed on the electrode surface were confirmed using scanning electron microscopy. Also, potentiodynamic polarization curves, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and an equivalent circuit analysis were used to evaluate the corrosion behaviors of the Pb-Sb-Sn alloy in the presence of ILs. The obtained results indicate that hydrogen and oxygen evolution overpotential of lead-antimony-tin alloy increases in the solution containing IL and mainly depends on the number of alkyl chain in alkylammonium cation. It is clearly observed that the morphology of PbSO4 layer changes under the influence of ILs. The corrosion studies show an increase in corrosion resistance of lead alloy in the presence of some ILs. Also, the electrochemical effects of ILs in conversion of PbSO4 to PbO2 and vice versa were investigated by carbon-PbO paste electrode. Cyclic voltammogram of carbon-PbO electrode shows that in the presence of ILs, oxidation and reduction peak currents increase, while reversibility decreases.									17	2	0	0	0	0	19			1432-8488			WOS:000287526800023		
J	Ji, Rong; Zhu, Zhi; Ma, Wei; Tang, Xu; Liu, Yang; Hu, Pengwei								A heterojunction photocatalyst constructed by the modification of 2D-CeO2 on 2D-MoS2 nanosheets with enhanced degrading activity								CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				10	3			788	800		10.1039/c9cy02238d				FEB 7 2020	2020	A new 2D/2D heterojunction of MoS2/CeO2 is successfully prepared by a facile hydrothermal method. The MoS2/CeO2 heterojunction demonstrates superior photocatalytic performance for the degradation of ciprofloxacin (CIP) to that of pure MoS2 and CeO2. The enhanced degradation efficiency of the MoS2/CeO2 heterojunction is on account of the 2D/2D structure, which not only accelerates the interfacial charge separation but also endows the heterojunction with numerous reactive sites to facilitate the degradation reaction. Meanwhile, the Ce4+ ions in 2D CeO2 serve as the redox centers and utilize the photogenerated carriers to generate more oxygen vacancies. In addition, this paper also carefully discusses the possible photocatalytic reaction mechanisms for the transfer behaviors of charge carriers, generation of reactive species and intermediate degradation products by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), electron spin resonance (ESR) and HPLC-MS analysis. This work may provide a promising approach for synthesizing 2D/2D heterojunctions in photocatalytic degradation.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000514293400016

The Ni3S2 nanorod arrays initially grow on the Ni foam in a specific orientation, then unexpectedly act as a ldquoskeletonrdquo to support MoS2 nanosheets which form in situ and undergo film-like stretching, resulting in the exposure of abundant Mo-S edges favorable for electrocatalytic water splitting. RGO is incorporated at the same time and offers a fast channel for electronic transfer, which leads to strong electronic interactions in the system. Due to the synergistic effects of the various components in the distinctive 3D structure, the RGO-MoS2DaggerNi3S2perpNF electrode exhibited a low HER overpotential of 55 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2, a small Tafel slope of 56.43 mV.dec-1, and demonstrated good long-term stability.

In this review we focus on laser-assisted fluorination, which currently achieves the highest levels of precision available for oxygen isotope analysis. In particular, we examine how results using this method have furthered our understanding of early-formed differentiated meteorites. Due to its rapid reaction times and low blank levels, laser-assisted fluorination has now largely superseded the conventional externally-heated Ni "bomb" technique for bulk analysis. Unlike UV laser ablation and SIMS analysis, laser-assisted fluorination is not capable of focused spot analysis. While laser fluorination is now a mature technology, further analytical improvements are possible via refinements to the construction of sample chambers, clean-up lines and the use of ultra-high resolution mass spectrometers.High-precision oxygen isotope analysis has proved to be a particularly powerful technique for investigating the formation and evolution of early-formed differentiated asteroids and has provided unique insights into the interrelationships between various groups of achondrites. A clear example of this is seen in samples that lie close to the terrestrial fractionation line (TFL). Based on the data from conventional oxygen isotope analysis, it was suggested that the main-group pallasites, the howardite eucrite diogenite suite (HEDs) and mesosiderites could all be derived from a single common parent body. However, high precision analysis demonstrates that main-group pallasites have a Delta O-17 composition that is fully resolvable from that of the HEDs and mesosiderites, indicating the involvement of at least two parent bodies. The range of Delta O-17 values exhibited by an achondrite group provides a useful means of assessing the extent to which their parent body underwent melting and isotopic homogenization. Oxygen isotope analysis can also highlight relationships between ungrouped achondrites and the more well-populated groups. A clear example of this is the proposed link between the evolved GRA 06128/9 meteorites and the brachinites.The evidence from oxygen isotopes, in conjunction with that from other techniques, indicates that we have samples from approximately 110 asteroidal parent bodies (similar to 60 irons, 35 achondrites and stony iron, and similar to 15 chondrites) in our global meteorite collection. However, compared to the likely size of the original protoplanetary asteroid population, this is an extremely low value. In addition, almost all of the differentiated samples (achondrites, stony-iron and irons) are derived from parent bodies that were highly disrupted early in their evolution.High-precision oxygen isotope analysis of achondrites provides some important insights into the origin of mass-independent variation in the early Solar System. In particular, the evidence from various primitive achondrite groups indicates that both the slope 1 (Y&R) and CCAM lines are of primordial significance. Delta O-17 differences between water ice and silicate-rich solids were probably the initial source of the slope 1 anomaly. These phases most likely acquired their isotopic composition as a result of UV photo-dissociation of CO that took place either in the early solar nebula or precursor giant molecular cloud. Such small-scale isotopic heterogeneities were propagated into larger-sized bodies, such as asteroids and planets, as a result of early Solar System processes, including dehydration, aqueous alteration, melting and collisional interactions.There is increasing evidence that chondritic parent bodies accreted relatively late compared to achondritic asteroids. This may account for the fact that apart from a few notable exceptions' such as the aubriteenstatite chondrite association, known chondrite groups could not have been the parents to the main achondrite groups.

Effects of temperature, especially high temperature, on the photosynthetic performance of this alga are poorly understood. The responses of net O-2 evolution and pigment content in mature thalli exposed to various temperatures of 14, 18, 22, 26, and 30 degrees C for 2 days were studied. Fast Chl-a fluorescence kinetics and RuBPCase activity of plants exposed to 30 degrees C for 6, 12, 24, and 48 h were also determined. The results showed that 14-26 degrees C favored the net O-2 evolution of G. amansii, which ranged from 0.50 to 1.53 mu mol O-2.g(-1).min(-1) High temperature (30 degrees C) decreases the contents of Chl-a and carotenoids. Phycobiliproteins increased in the thalli treated for 12 h and longer at 30 degrees C, suggesting that phycobiliproteins might play an important role in alleviation of oxidative damage caused by high temperature. In addition, the carbon assimilation process, light harvesting pigments, PSII reaction centers, and PSII acceptor side of G. amansii were damaged under 30 degrees C at 12 h; however, the PSII acceptor side was relatively stable during the initial 24 h treatment. At 30 degrees C both PSII photochemistry and carbon assimilation were negatively affected and impacted the photosynthetic response of G. amansii. RuBPCase activity showed a stronger positive correlation with photosynthetic oxygen release than the photochemistry. The results of this study confirm that the optimal temperature for G. amansii photosynthesis is between 22 degrees C to 26 degrees C and high temperatures of 30 degrees C and above limit G. amansii growth in near-shore waters.									7	2	0	0	5	0	8			0044-8486	1873-5622		WOS:000491992200051

In particular, key electron-capture rates, such as that for Co-60, are much smaller. We consider here the effects of these revised rates on the presupernova (post-oxygen burning) evolution of massive stars in the mass range 11-40 M-circle dot. Moreover, we include, for the first time in models by our group, the effects of modern rates for beta decay in addition to electron capture and positron emission. Stars of 15, 25, and 40 M-circle dot are examined in detail using both the full FFN rate set and the revised rates. An additional finely spaced (in mass) grid of 34 models is also calculated in order to give the systematics of iron core and silicon core masses. Values for the central electron mole number at the time of iron core collapse in the new models are typically larger, by DeltaY(e) = 0.005-0.015, than those of Woosley & Weaver, with a tendency for the more massive models to display larger differences. About half of this change is a consequence of including beta decay; the other half, the result of the smaller rates for electron capture. Unlike what might be expected solely on basis of the larger values, the new iron core masses are systematically smaller owing to a decrease in the entropy in the outer iron core. The changes in iron core mass range from zero to 0.1 M-circle dot (larger changes for high-mass stars). It would be erroneous however to estimate the facility of exploding these new models based solely upon their iron core mass since the entire core structure is altered and the density change is not so different as the adjustments in composition might suggest. We also observe, as predicted by Aufderheide et al., a tendency toward beta equilibrium just prior to the collapse of the core, and the subsequent loss of that equilibrium as core collapse proceeds. This tendency is more pronounced in the 15 M-circle dot model than in the heavier stars.

Herein, a hybridization catalyst construction concept is presented to dramatically enhance the alkaline HER activities of catalysts based on 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) (MoS2 and WS2). A series of ultrathin 2D-hybrids are synthesized via facile controllable growth of 3d metal (Ni, Co, Fe, Mn) hydroxides on the monolayer 2D-TMD nanosheets. The resultant Ni(OH)(2) and Co(OH)(2) hybridized ultrathin MoS2 and WS2 nanosheet catalysts exhibit significantly enhanced alkaline HER activity and stability compared to their bare counterparts. The 2D-MoS2/Co(OH)(2) hybrid achieves an extremely low overpotential of approximate to 128 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. The combined theoretical and experimental studies confirm that the formation of the heterostructured boundaries by suitable hybridization of the TMD and 3d metal hydroxides is responsible for the improved alkaline HER activities because of the enhanced water dissociation step and lowers the corresponding kinetic energy barrier by the hybridized 3d metal hydroxides.									137	6	0	0	7	0	137			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000439994500025	29782677

The ultrafine CoSe2 nanocrystals uniformly decorate the entire macroporous CNT backbone in CoSe2-CNT composite microspheres. The macroporous CNT backbone strongly improves the electrocatalytic activity of CoSe2 by improving the electrical conductivity and minimizing the growth of CoSe2 nanocrystals during the synthesis process. In addition, the macroporous structure resulting from the CNT backbone improves the electrocatalytic activity of the CoSe2-CNT microspheres by increasing the removal rate of generated H-2 and minimizing the polarization of the electrode during HER. The CoSe2-CNT composite microspheres demonstrate excellent catalytic activity for HER in an acidic medium (10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of approximate to 174 mV). The bare CoSe2 powders exhibit moderate HER activity, with an overpotential of 226 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The Tafel slopes for the CoSe2-CNT composite and bare CoSe2 powders are 37.8 and 58.9 mV dec(-1), respectively. The CoSe2-CNT composite microspheres have a slightly larger Tafel slope than that of commercial carbon-supported platinum nanoparticles, which is 30.2 mV dec(-1).									100	7	0	0	4	0	100			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000405403300002	28558155

The effect of secondary reactions, which are mainly vapor-phase cracking, on shale oil property and yield at different temperatures is characterized on the basis of ultimate, C-13 NMR and GC-MS analyses of the produced oil. The increases in the production rate of hydrocarbon gas species and related molar ratios clarify that the oil vapor cracking, rather than coking, is the main secondary reactions at pyrolysis temperature over 495 degrees C. Ultimate analysis of shale oil shows that cracking increases the carbon and nitrogen contents of oil but decreases its hydrogen and oxygen contents. There are obvious decreases in the atomic H/C and O/C ratios of shale oil with increasing the pyrolysis temperature. NMR analysis shows that the aromaticity of shale oil increases considerably due to secondary reactions. Selective concentration of existing aromatics and aromatization of aliphatics are of roughly equal importance. The GC-MS results indicate that the aliphatic hydrocarbons (alkanes and alkenes) are the main detected components in shale oil and represent 75% of the detected peak areas. Via oil vapor cracking, a part of long-chain aliphatics is transformed into short-chain alkanes, alkenes and gas species to increase the low-carbon hydrocarbons. The increase in aromatic proportion with raising temperature is due to the selective concentration by cracking aliphatics and aromatization reactions such as dehydrogenation and their subsequent reactions.

A single-step aerosol-assisted deposition using a rhodium diethyldithiocarbamate precursor was employed for this purpose at an operating temperature of 500 degrees C. Manipulating only the deposition time yielded crystalline and phase-pure Rh2S3 films with self-organized and controllable nanostructured morphologies. The HER performance of the resulting films in acidic electrolyte was found to be largely influenced by these morphologies in addition to the metallic substrates (i.e., Ni foam (NF) and Ti foil (Ti)) used to form the working electrodes in an electrolytic cell. A blooming flower-like structure obtained in 80 min of deposition on a NF substrate (Rh2S3/NF-80) exhibited the highest catalytic activity. A detailed characterization indicated that the highly exposed surface characters and pronounced number of active sites were responsible for such an extraordinary performance. To produce current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), the Rh2S3/NF-80 needed overpotentials (eta) of 67 and 132 mV, the lowest reported for any rhodium sulfide material, while being comparable to the Pt benchmark catalyst. The Tafel slope for Rh2S3/NF-80 electrode was estimated to be 36 mV dec(-1), suggesting that the HER followed the Volmer-Heyrovsky kinetic model. Furthermore, the current density outstretched to 350 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of just above 300 mV, thereby meeting the standards for large-scale application. With all these unprecedented structural and performance attributes, it is envisaged that the as-prepared Rh2S3 catalytic films would perform equivalently in many other catalytic operations.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2398-4902			WOS:000611818900014

Platinum remains a leading choice of catalyst, but because of its high cost and low natural abundance, it is critical to optimize its use. In the present study, platinum oxide nanoparticles of approximately 2 nm in diameter are deposited on carbon nitride (C3N4) nanosheets by thermal refluxing of C3N4 and PtCl2 or PtCl4 in water. These nanoparticles exhibit apparent electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acid. Interestingly, the HER activity increases with increasing Pt4+ concentration in the nanoparticles, and the optimized catalyst even outperforms commercial Pt/C, exhibiting an overpotential of only -7.7 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of -26.3 mV dec(-1). The results from this study suggest that the future design of platinum oxide catalysts should strive to maximize the Pt4+ sites and minimize the formation of the less active Pt2+ species.									8	1	0	0	1	0	8			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000501677000001	31659785

In this contribution, a promising Mo-precursor was first designed and prepared via partial reduction of commercial (NH4)(6)Mo7O24 center dot 4H(2)O by DL-tartaric acid. A simple pyrolysis method as a new "bottom-up" approach was then developed to achieve the desired HER catalysts by using the Mo-precursor. The resulting catalysts consist of multiphasic 1T/2H-MoS2 and residual S, N co-doped carbon (SNC) with oxygen functional groups. In comparison with (NH4)(6)Mo7O24 center dot 4H(2)O, Mo-precursor with high content of Mo5+ promotes the full formation of MoS2, while its high content of carbon is more favorable to gain the residual SNC in the resulting catalysts. The further results demonstrate that the percentages of 1T-MoS2 and the content of the residual SNC can be facilely tuned by the pyrolysis temperatures or the Mo/S feeding molar ratios. Notably, although the resulting catalysts exhibit the "bulk" and irregular morphology with low specific surface areas, the high percentages of 1T-MoS2 as the primary advantage, the highly exposed active sites mainly stemming from disordered stacking of S-Mo-S layers, and the high content of the SNC residues are synergistically responsible for their high electrocatalytic HER activity. The high thermal stability of 1T-MoS2 and the excellent durability and stability during HER processes are attributed to the stabilizing effects of the residual SNC. Under the optimized synthetic conditions, the achieved Mo/S(0.2)-450 has a low overpotential of similar to 130 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 77 mV dec(-1), a high specific activity of 17.53 mu A cm(Cat center dot)(-2), and the excellent durability and stability in 0.5 M H2SO4. This work can provide a promising Mo-precursor and a facile route to developing the highly efficient HER catalysts.									17	1	0	0	0	0	18			2574-0962			WOS:000462944700050

WO3 modified with nanoparticulate Pt species (more specifically, PtOx) as cocatalysts is capable of photocatalyzing water oxidation under visible light in the presence of iodate (IO3-) ions as an electron acceptor under near-neutral pH conditions (pH approximate to 5.9). When PtOx/WO3 was further modified with a very small amount (0.001 wt%) of a metal oxide (e. g., MnOx, CoOx, RuO2 or IrO2) as a secondary cocatalyst, the water oxidation activity was improved. Among the metal oxide cocatalysts examined, RuO2 was found to give the highest performance, with an apparent quantum yield of 14.4% at 420 nm. The results of photocatalytic reactions and photoelectrochemical analyses suggest that the main roles of the loaded PtOx and RuO2 on WO3 are to promote the reduction of IO3- and water oxidation, respectively.									135	9	0	0	7	0	138			1754-5692			WOS:000306571800036

Under the optimal photocatalytic conditions [photoirradiation at lambda >= 420 nm, [Ru(bpy)(3)]Cl-2 as the photosensor, Na2S2O8 as the oxidant in borate buffer (pH = 9.0)], the turnover number (TON) can reach as high as 360, the initial quantum yield and the initial turnover frequency (TOF) for the first 60 seconds was 27% and 0.5 s(-1), respectively. Variables of the photocatalytic reaction, including catalyst concentrations, buffer types and concentrations, pHs, dye concentrations, oxidant concentrations, etc., were systemically studied. The oxygen atoms of the evolved oxygen came from water, as confirmed by isotope-labeled experiments. In the thermal water oxidation, the TON and oxygen yield were measured to be 15 and 60%, respectively. The stability of 1 was tested and confirmed with multiple experiments (laser flash photolysis, DLS, CV, FT-IR, EDX, and catalyst recycling) within the photocatalytic water oxidation duration, which ruled out the possibility that neither the free Co2+ ions were present in the reaction solution nor were cobalt oxide/hydroxide nanoparticles in situ formed from the assumed decomposition of 1. All the evidence stated here collectively supports that 1 is the true molecular catalyst. In addition, the recycled sample was reused for water oxidation catalysis and showed similar catalytic behaviors (kinetics and activity) to that of the freshly prepared catalyst. No insoluble forms where found when the borate buffer solution of 1 was aged for 2 months, whereas its analogue, K-8[(CoCoII)-Co-II(H2O)W11O39] (4), is rapidly decomposed to a blue-purple cobalt oxide precipitate in borate buffer. The stability difference between 1 and 4 indicates that the +3 oxidation state of the central cobalt in 1 plays a vital role in maintaining the structural integrity. A series of other Keggin-type POMs, such as K-6[(CoW12O40)-W-II] (2), K-5[(CoW12O40)-W-III] (3), K-6[SiCoII(H2O)W11O39] (5), and K-5[PCoII(H2O)W11O39] (6), were also evaluated for their catalytic activity by comparison with 1. Our study demonstrates that the unique structural features of the mixed-valent central and peripheral cobalt atoms are essential for 1 to maintain both catalytic stability and efficiency.									262	18	0	0	15	0	270			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000316468600013

However, insufficient oxidation potential and limited light-absorption have restricted its further improvement. Herein, PCN with sufficient oxidation potential and improved visible-light usage (up to 550 nm) was prepared by co-polymerization of 2,5,8-triaminotri-s-triazine (melem) and barbituric acid (BA). With the loading of Na2CoP2O7, as a water-oxidation co-catalyst, this novel PCN system showed a record-high apparent quantum efficiency (420 nm) of 8.0 % and a solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency of 0.30 % for H2O2 production. This improvement is attributed to the introduced O 2p states by C=O groups remained in the PCN matrix, leading to a positive valence band maximum of 1.85 eV (vs. SHE). The co-polymerization of BA and melem combined with Na2CoP2O7 loading also suppressed the charge recombination, resulting in a rapid stepwise one-electron to one-electron reaction for efficient H2O2 production.									40	1	0	0	4	0	40			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000532681500004

Multistage karstification is superimposed to form the present ultra-deep karst-hydrothermal reformed carbonate reservoirs in the Yubei area of the Tarim Basin. Based on petrology identification, stable carbon and oxygen isotope analysis, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and Laser Ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), we investigated paleokarst periods, chemical property of hydrothermal fluids, and the evolution model and formation mechanism of paleokarst-hydrothermal reformed Ordovician carbonate reservoirs. The results show that the Ordovician strata experienced five periods of karstification from the middle Caledonian period to the late Himalayan period. The Caledonian quasi contemporaneous karst and the Hercynian epigenetic karstification provided the most fundamental pore - fracture framework for carbonate reservoirs, and the later multistage deep burial karstification re-transformed the established reservoir space by hydrothermal dissolution under thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR) reaction. It is proposed that the thermal convection between the hydrothermal fluids from the upper mantle and carbonate rocks formed two kinds of hydrothermal fluids in Ordovician strata. The first kind of hydrothermal fluid is performed with a SiO2-enriched fluid under the acidic environment based on TSR, forming siliceous cements and hydrothermal dissolution pores in the Lower Ordovician strata. The second kind of hydrothermal fluids appeared as an alkaline CO32- enriched fluid with the reversible reaction between HCO3- and CaCO3, forming hydrothermal calcite and dolomite near the migration channel in Upper Ordovician carbonate rocks. The periodic changes of in situ trace element concentrations of multistage quartz fillings indicated that paleokarst reservoirs are controlled by thermal convection under episodic tectonic activity. As a summary, we established the migration pattern of hydrothermal fluids in the thin section scale and the evolution model of the hydro thermal reformed paleokarst reservoirs in basin scale.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0264-8172	1873-4073		WOS:000797223500002

The goal of these studies was to experimentally determine whether O-H or C-H bond scission occurs first. This was accomplished by examining the reaction of two partially deuterated ethanol molecules (only the fully deuterated version has been studied previously): a deuterium atom at the hydroxyl (CH3CH2OD) or two deuterium atoms at the a-carbon (CH3CD2OH). To support the experiment, density functional theory was used to calculate vibrational spectra for the respective adsorbed alcohols, alkoxides and hydroxyethyl intermediates. Based on the thermal evolution of vibrational spectra together with the sequence of desorption of D2O and H2O during TPD, we conclude that the decomposition of adsorbed ethanol proceeds directly to ethoxide (not hydroxyethyl) on Pd(111).

However, the sluggish kinetics of HER remains a challenge. Here we demonstrate an efficient HER catalyst comprising Ru and AgCl nanoparticles anchored on Ag nanowires (Ru/AgCl@Ag), which delivers a low overpotential of 12 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 38 mV decade(-1). A high mass activity of 214 mA mg(-1) at an overpotential of 25 mV and a long-term durability in 1.0 M KOH are observed. In combination with computational simulations, we find that the high electronegativity of chlorine in AgCl and d-band electrons from Ru synergistically destabilize the water molecule and modulate H adsorption/desorption on the surface of Ru/AgCl@Ag, respectively. This work opens a promising avenue for the facile design and application of highly active and stable composite electrocatalysts toward water splitting.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			1948-7185			WOS:000535177500039	32282220

Herein, we report a facile strategy to configure an electrocatalyst composed of cobalt phosphide and rhodium uniformly anchored on reduced graphene oxide for hydrogen generation. The hybrids effectively integrate the exposed active sites, electron conductivity and synergistic effect of the catalyst. Electrochemical tests exhibit that the catalyst shows superior hydrogen evolution reaction catalytic activity and stability, with a small Tafel slope of 43 mV dec(-1). Over-potentials as low as 29 and 72 mV are required to achieve current densities of 2 and 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5M H2SO4, respectively. The hybrid constitution with highly active sites on conductive substrate is a new strategy to synthesize extremely efficient electrocatalysts. Especially, the efficient synergistic effect among cobalt phosphide, rhodium and reduced graphene oxide provides a novel approach for configuring electrocatalysts with high electron efficiency.

Herein, we report the synthesis of highly dispersed ruthenium nanoparticles (2.2 +/- 0.4 nm) on nitrogen doped carbon (Ru/N-C) by chemical reduction of RuCl3 on carbon in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone in combination with subsequent pyrolysis. Ru/N-C exhibits an excellent overpotential of 13.5 and 18.5 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution, respectively, much better than and comparable to those of commercial Pt/C (38.0 and 10.0 mV). The exceptional HER activity arises from high surface area of ultrafine Ru nanoparticles and appropriate Ru electronic state tuned by nitrogen dopant. Furthermore, Ru/N-C demonstrates excellent durability in both alkaline and acidic condition relative to commercial Pt/C. We speculate that the nitrogen dopant might have coordinated with Ru and tightly anchored Ru nanoparticles, preventing them from agglomerating.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2046-2069		WOS:000792839500001	35558850

However, it has always been a great challenge to develop a facile and low-cost system to facilitate the highly efficient synergistic effect between co-catalyst and heterostructure. Herein, co-catalyst NiS decorated ZnS/CdS heterostructure (CdS/ZnS-NiS) has been fabricated by using a facile one-pot hydrothermal procedure for the photocatalytic H2 evolution from water splitting. As a result, CdS, ZnS and NiS contact closely with each other at nano scale to assemble into fluffy porous nano-composite, the optimized CdS/ZnS-NiS exhibits a high hydrogen evolution rate of 60.44 mmol.h(-1)g(-1) without the addition of extra noble metal co-catalyst, which is about 22.3 times higher than that of pure CdS and much higher than that of 1% wt Pt decorated CdS/ZnS (52.36 mmol.h(-1)g(-1)). One-pot fabrication process allows the formation of intimate contacted interface between different components, contributing to the sufficient exposure of active reaction sites. Moreover, noble-metal-free co-catalyst NiS distributes uniformly in both surface and inner region of porous nanocomposite. The synergistic effect between the intimately contacted heterostructure and co-catalyst boosts the separation and utilization of photogenerated charge carriers, resulting in a dramati-cally enhanced H2 evolution ability. This work provides a facile pathway to uniformly introduce noble-metal-free co-catalyst in heterostructure and gives out a paradigm in constructing high active solar energy conversion system.									31	2	0	0	4	0	31			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773003000001

The mechanism consists of a shell detonation and subsequent core detonation. The focus of our study is the effect of the progenitor metallicity on the nucleosynthetic yields. For this, we computed and analyzed a set of 11 different models with varying core and shell masses at four different metallicities each. This results in a total of 44 models at metallicities between 0.01 Z(circle dot) and 3 Z(circle dot). Our models show a strong impact of the metallicity in the high-density regime. The presence of Ne-22 causes a neutron-excess that shifts the production from Ni-56 to stable isotopes such as Fe-54 and Ni-58 in the alpha-rich freeze-out regime. The isotopes of the metallicity implementation further serve as seed nuclei for additional reactions in the shell detonation. The production of Mn-55 increases with metallicity, confirming the results of previous work. A comparison of elemental ratios relative to iron shows a good match to solar values for some models. Super-solar values are reached for Mn at 3 Z(circle dot) and solar values in some models at Z(circle dot). This indicates that the required contribution of Type Ia supernovae originating from Chandrasekhar-mass WDs can be lower than estimated in previous work to reach solar values of [Mn/Fe] at [Fe/H] = 0. Our galactic chemical evolution models suggest that Type Ia supernovae from sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs, along with core-collapse supernovae, could account for more than 80% of the solar Mn abundance. Using metallicity-dependent Type Ia supernova yields helps to reproduce the upward trend of [Mn/Fe] as a function of metallicity for the solar neighborhood. These chemical evolution predictions, however, depend on the massive star yields adopted in the calculations.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000728074200007

Here, we manipulate the occurrence and process of surface reconstruction in two model ABO(3) perovskites, i.e., SrSc0.5Ir0.5O3 and SrCo0.5Ir0.5O3, which allow us to evaluate the structure and activity evolution step by step. The occurrence and order of leaching of Sr (A-site) and Sc/Co (B-site) were controlled by tailoring the thermodynamic stability of B-site. Sr leaching from A-site mainly generates more electrochemical surface area for the reaction, and additional leaching of Sc/Co from B-site triggers the formation of a honeycomb-like IrOxHy, phase with a notable increase in intrinsic activity. A thorough surface reconstruction with dual-site metal leaching induces an activity improvement by approximately two orders of magnitude, which makes the reconstructed SrCo0.5Ir0.5O3 among the best for water oxidation in acid.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2375-2548			WOS:000730596500017	34890227

Nevertheless, only a few systems have been reported so far by applying solar energy in visible light region in particular high wavelength (such as lambda >= 650 nm). Herein, we report an efficient 650 nm-induced CO2 photocatalytic reduction system to syngas by introducing Co into MgAl-layered double hydroxide (CoMgAl-LDH) nanosheets in conjunction with Ru(bpy)(3)]Cl-2.6H(2)O as photosensitizer, in which [Ru(bpy)(3)]Cl-2.6H(2)O could be activated to generate photogenerated electrons which further transfer to surface of CoMgAl-LDH for CO2 reduction. Under irradiation >400 nm, the CoMgAl-LDH nanosheets showed excellent CO2 conversion with TOF of 11.57 h(-1), 3 times higher than that of CoAl-LDH. Most importantly, up to monochromatic irradiation wavelength at 650 nm, the CoMgAl-LDH nanosheets still displayed optimized syngas evolution rate, with CO rate of 0.35 mu mol.h(-1) with quantum yield of 0.86%. Furthermore, as evidenced by X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and high-resolution synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction, the proper introduction of Co promoted its dispersion on the laminate of LDH. The suitable dispersion of Co active sites into LDH nanosheets facilitates the transportation of photo-generated electrons to further promote catalytic activity for reaction. This work paves a potential way for CO2 PR to syngas under wavelength irradiation up to 650 nm.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000635382300001

In this study, phosphorus doped porous ultrathin carbon nitride nanosheets (PCN-S) were prepared successfully via the element doping and thermal exfoliation method. The prepared PCN-S was characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, N-2-adsorption -desorption measurement, FT-IR, XPS, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, photoluminescence (PL), photocurrent response (I-t) and ElS. The results show that PCN-S owns regular crystal structure of g-C3N4, large specific surface areas and nanosheet structure with lots of in-plane pores on its surface, excellent chemical stability, and broad light response to the whole visible light region, which was attributed to the doping of phosphorus element. Under visible light irradiation, the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) over different samples indicated that the P doping and porous nanosheet structure play an important role for the enhanced performance of PCN-S. The reason was that P element doping can broaden the visible light response region, and large specific surface areas from the porous nanosheet structure can provide quantities of active sites for the photocatalytic reaction. Then the detailed study on the PCN-S for simultaneous photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) and oxidation of 2,4-diclorophenol (2,4-DCP) was conducted. The experiments results show that low pH value and enough dissolved oxygen were found to promote Cr(VI) reduction and 2,4-DCP oxidation. The detailed photocatalytic mechanism was proposed. The strategies used in this study could provide new insight into the design of g-C3N4 based materials with high photocatalytic activity, and present potential for the treatment of Cr(Vl)/2,4-DCP or other mixed pollutants in wastewater.

A complete level structure of Al-24 incorporating all states below the proton-emission threshold, has been constructed. The first excited state above the proton threshold has also been identified as a 3(+) state at 2345.1 +/- 1.4 keV. This state, corresponding to a resonance energy of 473 +/- 3 keV, has been suggested to be the dominant resonance contributing to the Mg-23(p,gamma)Al-24 stellar reaction rate. The improved precision of the level energy and unambiguous assignment of the state has reduced the uncertainty of the Mg-23(p,gamma)Al-24 stellar reaction rate, which constrains the production of A>20 nuclei in ONe novae.									19	1	0	0	0	0	19			0556-2813	1089-490X		WOS:000255457700011

Surface/interface engineering is found to be effective in achieving novel physicochemical properties and synergistic effects in nanomaterials for electrocatalysis. Among various engineering strategies, heteroatom-doping has been regarded as a most promising method to improve the electrocatalytic performance via the regulation of electronic structure of catalysts, and numerous works were reported on the synthesis method and mechanism investigation of heteroatom-doping electrocatalysts, though the heteroatom-doping can only provide limited active sites. Engineering of other defects such as vacancies and edge sites and construction of heterostructure have shown to open up a potential avenue for the development of noble metal-free electrocatalysts. In addition, surface functionalization can attach various molecules onto the surface of materials to easily modify their physical or chemical properties, being as a promising complement or substitute for offering materials with catalytic properties. This paper gives the insights into the diverse strategies of surface/interface engineering of the high-efficiency noble metal-free electrocatalysts for energy-related electrochemical reactions. The significant advances are summarized. The unique advantages and mechanisms for specific applications are high-lighted. The current challenges and outlook of this growing field are also discussed.

This phenomenon was studied by analysis of the positive active material, lithium cobaltate (LiCoO2), by measurement of the species on the negative electrode and the composition of the generated gases, and by estimating the abundance of the species in the electrolyte after/during charging the battery. The potential of the positive electrode maintained a constant value, the crystals of the positive material did not change, metallic Li and oxides of Li were produced on the negative electrode, CO2 and CO were generated, and the relative abundance of the species from the additives did not change during overcharging of the battery. We postulated that, in the lithium-ion battery sample with the additives, oxygen gas and/or carbon dioxide gas is generated at the positive electrode during overcharge, moves to the negative electrode, and oxidizes the Li deposited on the negative electrode. This reaction process has been suggested to be similar to that observed on overcharging of Ni-Cd or Ni-MH sealed batteries, and the battery with the additives remained safe during the overcharge.

It is demonstrated that the obtained InSe flakes have maximum lateral sizes ranging from 30 nm to a few micrometers, and thicknesses ranging from 1 to 20 nm, with a maximum population centered at approximate to 5 nm, corresponding to 4 Se-In-In-Se quaternary layers. It is also shown that no formation of further InSe-based compounds (such as In2Se3) or oxides occurs during the exfoliation process. The potential of these exfoliated-InSe few-layer flakes as a catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is tested in hybrid single-walled carbon nanotubes/InSe heterostructures. The dependence of the InSe flakes' morphologies, i.e., surface area and thickness, on the HER performances is highlighted, achieving the best efficiencies with small flakes offering predominant edge effects. The theoretical model unveils the origin of the catalytic efficiency of InSe flakes, and correlates the catalytic activity to the Se vacancies at the edge of the flakes.									74	2	0	0	1	0	74			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000436408800011	29845748

The method uses gases instead of liquid to disperse carbon precursors, leach templates, and remove impurities, minimizing synthetic procedures and the use of chemicals. The method is universal and demonstrated by the synthesis of 12 different porous carbons with various template sources. The effects of pore geometries in catalysis can be isolated and investigated. Two of the resulted materials with different pore geometries are studied as supports for Ru clusters in the hydrogenolysis of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and electrochemical hydrogen evolution (HER). The porous carbon-supported Ru catalysts outperform commercial ones in both reactions. It was found that Ru on bottleneck pore carbon shows a highest yield in hydrogenolysis of HMF to 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) due to a better confinement effect. A wide temperature operation window from 110 to 140 degrees C, with over 75% yield and 98% selectivity of DMF, has been achieved. Tubular pores enable fast charge transfer in electrochemical HER, requiring only 16 mV overpotential to reach current density of 10 mA.cm(-2).									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000460199400145	30649849

An inorganic-organic two-dimensional (2D)/one-dimensional (1D) graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheet anchored with a vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) nanoparticle heterojunction photocatalyst (GCN/V2O5-3) with excellent solar-light-driven photocatalytic performance was prepared using a facilethermal decomposition method and used for photocatalytic hydrogen (H-2) evolution from concentrated lactic acid aqueous solution. The optimized GCN/V2O5-3 catalyst attained a high initial H-2 evolution rate of 2891.53 mu molg(-1), which is 2.44 times greater than that of pristine g-C3N4 under simulated solar light irradiation. In addition, the GCN/V2O5-3 catalyst is relatively stable for 5h H-2 evolution reactions, indicating the robustness of the V2O5 co-catalyst. The improved photocatalytic activity of the g-C3N4/V2O5 composites can be ascribed to their large specific surface area. Photoelectrochemical analysis results clearly show that V2O5 co-catalyst captures photoinducedholes from the valance band of the excited g-C3N4 by a Z-scheme mechanism and thusimproving the charge separation performance andendorse the H+ reduction to H-2. Lastly, the mechanism of photocatalytic H-2 evolution of the g-C3N4/V2O5 composite is discussed. Importantly, because of its high stability, easy processing, and low cost, the V2O5 co-catalyst has abundant potential in designing high-performance-semiconductor/organic photocatalysts for large-scale H-2 production utilizing renewable energy sources.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000446481300089

Among various routes to generate hydrogen, solar water splitting has received increasing interest due to the abundance of renewable and sustainable solar energy. Thus, it is crucial to rationally design and develop high-performance photocatalysts and photoelectrodes for achieving high-efficiency photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical water splitting, respectively. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with well-distributed atoms anchored on substrates have attracted rapidly increasing attention in photocatalytic/photoelectrochemical water splitting because of the high activity, superior durability and extremely high atom utilization efficiency (100%). Herein, a timely and comprehensive review about the recent advances of SACs for photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical water splitting is presented by highlighting the distinctive and promotional roles of SACs in photo(electro)catalysis and unique fabrication methods for SACs used in this emerging field. Furthermore, several specific design strategies to boost the photo(electro)catalytic activity of SACs including substrate engineering, defect engineering, electronic structure modulation, constructing strong interactions, band gap/structure engineering, and transfer channel design are also presented and discussed. Finally, some perspectives on the development and design of SACs for high-efficiency solar energy utilization in future applications are provided by presenting the promises, critical issues and challenges.									12	1	0	0	1	0	12			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000765866800001

Herein, for the first time, a "self-assembly and self-template" strategy is adopted to fabricate self-assembled Ni2P/FeP heterostructural nanoparticles embedded in N-doped graphene nanosheets (NFP@NG) via a facile and cost-effective approach. The bimetallic NFP heterostructure embedded into NG presents far better water splitting performance than single-component counterparts. Notably, the NFP@NG hybrid exhibits enhanced HER performance with low onset potentials of similar to 110 and similar to 144 mV along with low overpotentials of similar to 250 and -240 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline and acid electrolytes, respectively. In addition, the hybrid displays superior OER properties with a low overpotential of 295 mV@ 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 59.1 mV dec(-1) and remarkable long-term cycling durability. Furthermore, when employed as both cathode and anode for overall water splitting, NFP@NG yields a remarkable long-term stability of 24 h with a low cell voltage (1.69 V) at 10 mA cm(-2). The remarkable multifunctional electrocatalytic properties can be attributed to the unique and novel architecture constructed by well-dispersed Ni2P/FeP heterostructural nanoparticles embedded in highly conductive few-layer NG nanosheets, which can not only lead to a uniform growth of phosphides with a large effective surface area and enable full utilization of electroactive sites, but also greatly accelerate the electron transfer and ion diffusion. This work presents a "self-assembly and self-template" strategy to synthesize nonprecious bi-metallic phosphide heterostructure/N-doped graphene nanosheets as promising multifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting.

Here, ternary alloy nanoparticles of NiCoMo are fabricated electrochemically on graphene nanosheets (GNs) as new nanocomposites using a glassy carbon electrode (GC) base, and then the prepared electrode systems are decorated with ruthenium nanoparticles (Ru NPs). The electrodes are characterized by several surface analysis techniques. The electrocatalytic activity of the electrodes is monitored toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solutions, and the fabrication conditions are optimized systematically based on advanced optimization methods such as central composite design (CCD) and simplex -lattice mixture design (SLMD). Initially, the electrodeposition bath parameters are investigated and optimized by CCD. Then, the SLMD analysis is utilized to obtain the optimal mole ratio of metal ions using HER kinetic data. The results revealed an optimized mole ratio of 33:27:40 for metal ions of Ni/Co/Mo in the electrodeposition bath leading to a GC-GNs-Ni0.20Co0.36Mo0.44 electrode structure. A Tafel slope of-45 mV dec(-1), j(0) of 1.26 mA cm(-2), and eta(50) of -82 mV are obtained at the optimized structure, which are close to -42 mV dec(-1) 5.93 mA cm(-2), and -48 mV obtained under the same conditions on the GC electrode modified with commercial Pt/C (GC-Pt/C). The electrode is further decorated with Ru NPs through electrodeposition to form GC-GNs-Ni-0.15,Co0.31Mo0.38/Ru-0.16. The results obtained on this electrode showed high physical and electrochemical stabilities and excellent kinetic performance for the HER, Tafel slope of -38 mV dec(-1), j, of 6.31 mA cm(-2), and eta(50) of -49 mV, which are similar or even better than the results obtained on the GC-Pt/C electrode.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000441484600005

The objective of this study was to monitor the concentration changes in anthocyanin-derived compounds during MOX and to draw conclusions on the polymerization processes of anthocyanins and flavanols in red wine. A 2013 Pinot noir was treated with MOX applying different oxygen dosages. The flavanol-to-anthocyanin ratio was changed prior to MOX by the addition of a commercial tannin preparation. Color intensity, acetaldehyde, and polymeric pigments were monitored during MOX and compared with concentration changes of ethylidene-bridged anthocyanin-flavanol adducts and vitisin B. Photometric analysis revealed a continuous increase in color intensity. More oxygen and a higher flavanol-to-anthocyanin ratio synergistically amplified the increase in color. MOX was also associated with an accumulation of acetaldehyde. While acetaldehyde was noticeably affected by the amount of oxygen applied, an altered flavanol-to-anthocyanin ratio had no significant influence on its accumulation. Anthocyanin and flavanol concentrations decreased due to MOX. This observation was accompanied by an increase in polymeric pigments, explaining the enhanced color intensity. Higher flavanol-to-anthocyanin ratio amplified the formation of large polymeric pigments in particular. MOX increased concentrations in vitisin B (+4 mg/L), ethylidene-bridged malvidin-3-glucoside-(epi)catechin dimer (+10 mg/L), and double ethylidene-bridged (epi)catechin-malvidin-3-glucoside(epi)catechin trimer (+6 mg/L). Different to color and polymeric pigments, vitisin B and ethylidene-bridged dimers reached a constant concentration and decreased after turning off MOX suggesting that these compounds are intermediates in polymerization reactions. In contrast, the concentration of the double ethylidene-bridged trimers increased linearly showing that trimers are formed out of dimers. While higher flavanol-to-anthocyanin ratio amplified the increase in ethylidene-bridged trimers, vitisin B and dimers were not affected. Hence, a higher flavanol-to-anthocyanin ratio is thought to particularly promote the formation of large(r) polymeric pigments.

This is a more acute problem when dealing with large gene families, such as the superfamily encoding cytochrome P450 enzymes in higher plants. We propose here a new, simple, medium-throughput methodology to screen for potential substrates of orphan P450 mono-oxygenases. The same technique can also be applied to screening for inhibitors of the oxygenases involved in the biosynthesis of compounds essential for plant development, such as growth regulators. The method is based on a commercially available microplate system, which detects the oxygen consumed by the catalytic reaction via an oxygen-sensing fluorophore. It is optimized using as a model CYP73A1, the cinnamic acid hydroxylase from Helianthus tuberosus, expressed in yeast. We show that the procedure is suitable not only for the detection and real-time monitoring, but also for the quantitative evaluation of enzyme activity. This new method has broad application for the identification of candidate substrates and inhibitors in chemical libraries, to support determination of physiological substrates, development of plant growth regulators, investigations on herbicide and pollutant metabolism, synthesis of valuable compounds and drug design. It also provides a fast-assay platform for determination of catalytic and inhibition parameters. The method applies to plant P450 enzymes, but also to cytochromes P450 from other organisms, and all types of oxygenases. The critical steps, calculation of oxygen consumption from fluorescence signal, and limits of the methods are discussed.									22	1	0	0	16	0	23			0960-7412	1365-313X		WOS:000247758600016	17610545

To this end, we have performed quantum chemical calculations using the Gaussian 09 program package to identify new reaction pathways and species formed during decomposition. The thermodynamic quantities of the species, such as Gibbs free energy and enthalpy, are calculated using a double-hybrid density functional theory method, B2PLYP, with Jensen's basis set, aug-pc2. For heavy atoms, such as chlorine, the basis set is augmented by adding 2 d functions with a stride factor of 2.5. To incorporate the solvation effect, the conductor-like polarizable continuum model, which is an implicit solvation model, is used. Numerical simulations using a control-volume analysis of an experiment are also performed using the proposed mechanism. In these simulations, rates of the reactions are calculated using transition state theory, incorporating diffusion effects on the rate constants. In order to consider the nonideal behavior of a concentrated HClO4 solution, activity coefficients are used to calculate the effective concentration of acid in solution. The activity coefficient of HClO4 plays a critical role in the calculation of the induction period involved in the HClO4 decomposition. A comparison of numerically predicted O-2 evolution and duration of the induction period with experimental data shows that the numerical simulation using the proposed mechanism predicts both the three-stage decomposition characteristics and the induction period observed during HClO4 decomposition, thus validating the proposed mechanism.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000693398500017	34428052

The resulting material is characterized by FT-IR, high resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM), NMR, and XAS, and then used to perform photocatalytic water splitting. The photocatalyst with SOMC-grafted Pt shows superior performance in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and strongly suppresses the backwards reaction of H-2 and O-2 forming H2O under dark conditions, compared to the photocatalyst prepared by impregnation at the same Pt loading. However, single Pt atoms on this surface also rapidly coalesce into nanoparticles under photocatalytic conditions. It is also found that adsorption of CO gas at room temperature also triggers the aggregation of Pt single atoms into nanoparticles. A detailed mechanism is investigated for the mobility of Pt in the formation of its carbonyls using density functional theory (DFT) calculations.									23	3	0	0	1	0	25			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000498220500015	31674630

Herein, we present a facile route for fabricating a hierarchical Ni-P/NiSex hetero-nanostructured material grown in situ on nickel foam (NF) (denoted as Ni-P/NiSex/NF), which can act as a bifunctional electrocatalyst, via electrodepositing amorphous Ni-P film on the surface of hydrothermally synthesized crystalline NiSex nanorod arrays. The distinctive superhydrophilic 3D structure and useful heterointerface not only afford the greater exposure of active sites, but this material also shows faster charge/mass transport and facilitates the departure of gas bubbles. Meanwhile, benefitting from the regulated electronic structure of NiSex and the synergistic effects of outer amorphous Ni-P and inner crystalline NiSex, the as-fabricated multi-phase catalyst exhibits simultaneously excellent electrocatalytic performances during the HER (overpotentials of 98 and 165 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively) and OER (an overpotential of 320 mV at 100 mA cm(-2)) in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Impressively, a Ni-P/NiSex/NF sample presents robust stability (100 h) during the OER and HER at a large current density. Significantly, an ultralow cell voltage of 1.536 V is required to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in a two-electrode electrolyzer with Ni-P/NiSex/NF as both the anode and cathode for overall water splitting (OWS), with the demonstration of remarkable durability, and this material far outperforms many recently reported bifunctional electrocatalysts. This work provides a promising strategy for developing efficient bifunctional catalysts for hydrogen production based on the synergistic engineering of the nanostructure design, composition control, and the use of crystalline states.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000780844500001		
S	Cao, Yangrong; Halane, Morgan K.; Gassmann, Walter; Stacey, Gary					Halane, Morgan/0000-0001-6357-6232	Merchant, SS		The Role of Plant Innate Immunity in the Legume-Rhizobium Symbiosis								ANNUAL REVIEW OF PLANT BIOLOGY, VOL 68		Annual Review of Plant Biology		68				535	561		10.1146/annurev-arplant-042916-041030				2017	2017	A classic view of the evolution of mutualism is that it derives from a pathogenic relationship that attenuated over time to a situation in which both partners can benefit. If this is the case for rhizobia, then one might uncover features of the symbiosis that reflect this earlier pathogenic state. For example, as with plant pathogens, it is now generally assumed that rhizobia actively suppress the host immune response to allow infection and symbiosis establishment. Likewise, the host has retained mechanisms to control the nutrient supply to the symbionts and the number of nodules so that they do not become too burdensome. The open question is whether such events are strictly ancillary to the central symbiotic nodulation factor signaling pathway or are essential for rhizobial host infection. Subsequent to these early infection events, plant immune responses can also be induced inside nodules and likely play a role in, for example, nodule senescence. Thus, a balanced regulation of innate immunity is likely required throughout rhizobial infection, symbiotic establishment, and maintenance. In this review, we discuss the significance of plant immune responses in the regulation of symbiotic associations with rhizobia, as well as rhizobial evasion of the host immune system.									93	5	1	0	85	0	96			1543-5008	1545-2123	978-0-8243-0668-7	WOS:000401335200020	28142283

However, the knowledge how to rationally design catalysts is still lacking. By combining different nitrogen/carbon precursors, including polyaniline (PANI), dicyandiamide (DCDA), and melamine (MLMN), we aim to tune catalyst morphology and structure to facilitate the ORR. Instead of the commonly studied single precursors, multiple precursors were used during the synthesis; this provides a new opportunity to promote catalyst activity and stability through a likely synergistic effect. The best-performing Fe-N-C catalyst derived from PANI+ DCDA is superior to the individual PANI or DCDA-derived ones. In particular, when compared to the extensively explored PANI-derived catalysts, the binary precursors have an increased half-wave potential of 0.83 V and an enhanced electrochemical stability in challenging acidic media, indicating a significantly increased number of active sites and strengthened local bonding structures. Multiple key factors associated with the observed promotion are elucidated, including the optimal pore size distribution, highest electrochemically active surface area, presence of dominant amorphous carbon, and thick graphitic carbon layers with more pyridinic nitrogen edge sites likely bonded with active atomic iron.									100	7	0	0	2	0	100			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000397006500017	27935237

However, their widespread application is hindered by low power density. Herein, a multiscale structural engineering of Ni-doped CoO nanosheets (NSs) for zinc-air batteries with superior high power density/energy density and durability is reported for the first time. In micro- and nanoscale, robust 2D architecture together with numerous nanopores inside the nanosheets provides an advantageous micro/nanostructured surface for O-2 diffusion and a high electrocatalytic active surface area. In atomic scale, Ni doping significantly enhances the intrinsic oxygen reduction reaction activity per active site. As a result of controlled multiscale structure, the primary zinc-air battery with engineered Ni-doped CoO NSs electrode shows excellent performance with a record-high discharge peak power density of 377 mW cm(-2), and works stable for >400 h at 5mA cm(-2). Rechargeable zinc-air battery based on Ni-doped CoO NSs affords an unprecedented small charge-discharge voltage of 0.63V, outperforming state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst-based device. Moreover, it is shown that Ni-doped CoO NSs assembled into all-solid-state coin cells can power 17 light-emitting diodes and charge an iPhone 7 mobile phone.									106	13	0	0	0	0	106			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000453355300020	30368937

The metals of the s-block of the periodic table have so far received little attention in the application of oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). Herein, a carbon catalyst with calcium (Ca) single atom coordinated with N and O is reported, which displays exceptional ORR activities in both acidic condition (E-1/2 = 0.77 V, 0.1 m HClO4) and alkaline condition (E-1/2 = 0.90 V, 0.1 m KOH). The Ca-N, O/C exhibits remarkable performance in zinc-air battery with a maximum power density of 218 mW cm(-2), superior to a series of catalysts reported so far. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) characterization confirms the formation of N- and O-atom-coordinated Ca in the carbon matrix. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the high catalytic activity of main-group Ca is ascribed to the fact that its p-orbital electron structure is regulated by N and O coordination so that the highest peak (E-P) of the projected density of states (PDOS) for the Ca atom is moved close to the Fermi level, thereby facilitating the adsorption of ORR intermediates and electron transfer.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000705985400001	34636109

The synergistic effect of the deposited Bi metal and oxygen deficiencies results in the effective separation of the photogenerated carriers in Bi3.84W0.16O6.24 and the enhancement of the photo-response properties. As a result, Bi/Bi3.84W0.16O6.24 exhibited outstanding visible-light photocatalytic activities and sustained cycling performance. Under visible-light irradiation, nearly 96% of RhB is degraded after 15 min. Radical trapping experiments indicate that h(+) and (OH)-O-center dot are the main active species. This study provides an attractive avenue to design and fabricate highly efficient Bi-based photocatalysts, which possess a high application value in the field of environmental remediation, especially for wastewater purification.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000452782100098

Characterization by X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy revealed that small particles of BiVO4 with 20-50 nm of sizes were obtained from micron-sized monoclinic scheelite-type BiVO4 without changes in the crystal structure by ball milling treatment. The specific surface area increased from 0.7 to 22.6 m(2) g(-1) by the milling treatment. Although the milling treatment decreased the photocatalytic activity, the successive annealing treatment at 400 degrees C remarkably improved the activity of milled BiVO4. As a result, the annealed small particles of BiVO4 achieved a slightly higher external quantum yield than the pristine one, 22.6% versus 20.8%. In contrast, the activity of non-milled BiVO4 decreased due to the annealing treatment. Transient absorption spectroscopy using femtosecond and nanosecond pump lasers clarified the influences of the ball milling and annealing treatment on the carrier dynamics of BiVO4. The ball milling treatment accelerated recombination in picosecond and microsecond regions. For example, only 40% of photogenerated holes survived in milled BiVO4 at 10 ps whereas 60% of holes remained in the non-milled sample. Annealing treatment at 400 degrees C suppressed the recombination in milled BiVO4 but facilitated the recombination in the non-milled sample. The small BiVO4 particles annealed at 400 degrees C, which exhibited high activity in sacrificial O-2 evolution, also showed high performance in overall water splitting by Z-scheme systems combined with Ru/SrTiO3:Rh of a H-2-evolving photocatalyst. A small amount of annealed small BiVO4 particles (5 mg) showed comparable activity in Z-scheme water splitting to the reaction with 30 mg of non-milled sample. In addition, in the Z-scheme water splitting based on interparticle electron transfer, the annealed small BiVO4 allowed 17% higher activity than the non-milled sample.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2398-4902			WOS:000766284900001

The structure, physico-chemical, and optical properties of TiO2-x(B) nanosheets were systematically characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, etc. The concentration of Ti3+ can be well tuned by NaBH4 reduction. With increasing the mass ratio of NaBH4 to TiO2(B), the generation of Ti3+ defects gives rise to the increased intensity of a broad band absorption in the visible wavelength range. It is demonstrated that the TiO2-x(B) photocatalyst synthesized with the mass ratio of NaBH4 to TiO2(B) of 3:1 exhibited an optimum photocatalytic activity and excellent photostability for hydrogen evolution under visible-light irradiation. By combining the advantages of 2D TiO2(B) nanosheets architecture with those of Ti3+ self-doping and simultaneous production of oxygen vacancy sites, the enhanced photocatalytic performance of the defective TiO2-x(B) nanosheets was achieved.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10				2073-4344		WOS:000507336600077

Recent investigations on the combined action of moderate light intensity and heat stress suggest that moderately high temperatures do not cause serious PSII damage but inhibit the repair of PSII. The latter largely involves de novo synthesis of proteins, particularly the D1 protein of the photosynthetic machinery that is damaged due to generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in the reduction of carbon fixation and oxygen evolution, as well as disruption of the linear electron flow. The attack of ROS during moderate heat stress principally affects the repair system of PSII, but not directly the PSII reaction center (RC). Heat stress additionally induces cleavage and aggregation of RC proteins; the mechanisms of such processes are as yet unclear. On the other hand, membrane linked sensors seem to trigger the accumulation of compatible solutes like glycinebetaine in the neighborhood of PSII membranes. They also induce the expression of stress proteins that alleviate the ROS-mediated inhibition of repair of the stress damaged photosynthetic machinery and are required for the acclimation process. In this review we summarize the recent progress in the studies of molecular mechanisms involved during moderate heat stress on the photosynthetic machinery, especially in PSII.									173	18	3	0	149	2	198			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000261577900046	18649006

The electrochemical (EC) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) degradation studies were carried out on trypan blue (TB) dye. These studies revealed that the characteristics and performance of MMO electrode improved significantly on nano-WO3 modification. The oxygen evolution potential (OEP) increased from 2.07 V (vs Ag/AgCl) to 2.21 V and the accelerated service life increased by 1.7 times. 88 and 93% color removal was achieved on electrolysis for 240 min using MMO electrode; whereas, 100% color removal was achieved within 120 min by both EC and PEC using MMO-WO3. The percentage chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal achieved using MMO electrode by EC and PEC were only 60 and 63% respectively; whereas, it increased to 78 and 84% with MMO-WO3 electrode. A probable pathway for TB degradation was proposed on the basis of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis and quantum chemical calculations were performed on TB molecule to corroborate the proposed degradation pathway.									11	0	0	0	3	0	11				2213-3437		WOS:000414041300086		
J	Seidler, A								Intermolecular and intramolecular interactions of the 33-kDa protein in photosystem II								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY				242	3			485	490		10.1111/j.1432-1033.1996.0485r.x				DEC 15 1996	1996	Intermolecular and intramolecular interactions of the extrinsic 33-kDa protein in photosystem II were investigated by cross-linking with a water-soluble carbodiimide as cross-linking agent. This zero-length cross-linker is known to cross-link the 33-kDa protein to the chlorophyll-alpha-binding protein CP47 [Bricker, T M., Odom, W. R. & Queirolo, C. B. (1988) FEBS Lett. 231, 111-117; Enami, I., Kaneko, M., Kitamura, N., Koike, H., Sonoike, K., Inoue, Y. & Katoh, S. (1991) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1060, 224-232]. In this work, cross-linking was observed not only to CP47 but also to a small intrinsic subunit. In addition, through the use of a high-resolution SDS-gel system, three intramolecular cross-linked products of the 33-kDa protein were detected. To search for additional cross-linking sites that might not be accessible to the cross-linker in intact photosystem II, the isolated 33-kDa protein was activated for cross-linking and subsequently bound to CaCl2-washed photosystem II. In the complementary experiment, CaCl2-washed photosystem II was activated, then reconstituted with the 33-kDa protein. The results of the crosslinking reactions demonstrated that all carboxylic acid groups involved in cross-linking were located on the 33-kDa protein and all primary amines were located on intrinsic membrane proteins. No cross-linking other than those observed in cross-linking experiments with intact photosystem II were observed. This indicated that the 33-kDa protein is bound to CP47 and a small subunit but not to the photosystem II reaction centre. This observation is consistent with the finding that cross-linking was independent of the presence or absence of the manganese cluster. Possible residues on the 33-kDa protein and CP47 involved in cross-linking are suggested.									31	0	1	0	29	0	32			0014-2956			WOS:A1996WB94900007	9022672	
J	Guo NaXin; Liu ShanBao; Chen ZhenYu; Jiang ShengXiong; Li HongWei								Mechanism of Nb and REE enrichment in the Tiemuli alkali-feldspar granite, Chongyi County, Jiangxi Province								ACTA PETROLOGICA SINICA				38	2			371	392		10.18654/1000-0569/2022.02.05				FEB 2022	2022	South China is an important critical metal mineral resources base, and it is remarkable for widespread granites and extensive rare and rare-earth metal metallogeny. Niobium mineralization is closly assosicated with highly differentiated peraluminous granites, while the REEs decrease as magma evolves. The Early Cretaceous Tiemuli granitic pluton, located in Chongyi County, Jiangxi Province, eastern Nanling metallogenic belt, is mainly composed of flesh red and grey metaluminous-peraluminous biotite-bearing alkali-feldspar granites (r-G and g-G in short, respectively) which are chemically distinctive with high contents of niobium and rare earth elements. In this paper, detailed mineral analyses were carried out to probe into the enrichment mechanism of Nb and REEs in this intrusion. Niobium minerals in r-G mainly compose ilmenorutile, while rare earth minerals compose magmatic chevkinite, monazite, apatite and hydrothermal monazite, bastnaesite and parasite. Niobium minerals in g-G contain magmatic ilmenorutile and hydrothermal ilmenorutile, aeschynite and columbite, while magmatic apatite and hydrothermal apatite, monazite, bastnaesite, parasite comprise the REE minerals in g-G. Enclaves in the granites were caused by mixing of mafic and acidic magmas and contain apatite, monazite, a little rutile and chevkinite. Mineral assemblage characteristics indicate that Nb and REEs of the Tiemuli alkali-feldspar granite were concentrated during the magmatic and hydrothermal stages. Physicochemical conditions of the magmatic-hydrothermal system have been constrainted by rutile, apatite, chlorite, etc. And the enrichment mechanism of Nb and REEs has been delineated. Niobium was accommodated into ilmenorutile during the magmatic crystallization at temperature of 688 similar to 500 degrees C, and be contained by hydrothermal rutile, aeschynite and niobite during the hydrothermal stage at temperature of 500 similar to 486 degrees C. The rare earth elements were mainly taken into apatite, monazite, chevkinite, while some were reserved into biotite during the magmatic crystallization, and then turned to be moblizied and were migrated by hydrothermal fluid. The REEs were mainly deposited at temperature of similar to 280 degrees C with forms of monazite, bastnaesite and parasite. The melt had high oxygen fugacity while postmagmaic hydrothermal fluid turned to be reductive. The temperature and oxygen fugacity declined following the evolution. Variation of temperature, oxygen fugacity, and composition caused by magma evolution and reaction between magma and carbonate wall rocks during the hydrothermal stage are the critical factors for the mobilization, migration and deposition of REEs. The Tiemuli alkali-feldspar granite is characterized by magmatic-hydrothermal Nb-REE mineralization, and might be comprehensivly evaluated for granite-type Nb and REEs resources.									1	1	0	0	0	0	1			1000-0569	2095-8927		WOS:000771197700005

These inhibitors caused a marked restriction of malate (+ glutamate)-dependent O-2 uptake in mitochondria (53-73%) isolated from pea leaves. When mesophyll protoplasts were illuminated in the presence of mitochondrial inhibitors, there was a significant decrease (> 45%) in HCO3--dependent O-2 evolution, while the decrease in O-2 evolution was marginal (< 10%) in the presence of benzoquinone (BQ) (photosystem PSII-mediated) and NO2--(dependent on PSII + PSI) as electron acceptors. 3-(3.4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU), a typical photosynthetic inhibitor decreased drastically all the three reactions: HCO3 or BQ or NO2 -dependent O-2 evolution in mesophyll protoplasts. Our results indicate that mitochondrial oxidative metabolism (through both cytochrome and alternative pathways) is essential for maintenance of photosynthetic carbon assimilation, but not for PSI or PSII-dependent photochemical electron transport activities in mesophyll protoplasts of pea.									10	1	0	0	11	0	11			0011-3891			WOS:000171362900024

Parazitologiia				48	2			110	30						2014 Mar-Apr	2014	The review is aimed to analyze the biochemical and immune-breaking adaptive mechanisms established in evolution of plant parasitic nematodes. Plant parasitic nematodes are obligate, biotrophic pathogens of numerous plant species. These organisms cause dramatic changes in the morphology and physiology of their hosts. The group of sedentary nematodes which are among the most damaging plant-parasitic nematodes cause the formation of special organs called nematode feeding sites in the root tissue called syncytium (cyst nematodes, CN; Heterodera and Globodera spp.) or giant cells (root-knot nematodes, RKN; Meloidogyne spp.). The most pronounced morphological adaptations of nematodes for plant parasitism include a hollow, protrusible stylet (feeding spear) connected to three esophageal gland cells that express products secreted into plant tissues through the stylet. Several gene products secreted by the nematode during parasitism have been identified. The current battery of candidate parasitism proteins secreted by nematodes to modify plant tissues for parasitism includes cell-wall-modifying enzymes, multiple regulators of host cell cycle and metabolism, proteins that can localize near the plant cell nucleus, potential suppressors of host defense, and mimics of plant molecules. Plants are usually able to recognize and react to parasites by activating various defense responses. When the response of the plant is too weak or too late, a successful infection (compatible interaction) will result. A rapid and strong defense response (e. g. due to the presence of a resistance gene) will result in the resistant (incompatible) reaction. Defense responses include the production of toxic oxygen radicals and systemic signaling compounds as well as the activation of defense genes that lead to the production of structural barriers or other toxins.									5	0	2	0	4	0	7			0031-1847			MEDLINE:25272462	25272462

Here, using first principles calculations, the CeO2(111)/hBN heterojunction was conceived. The influence of the interface effect on the structural, electronic and optical properties of the heterojunction was investigated in detail. The band gap of the heterojunction is smaller than the two individual components and forms a type-II heterojunction, improving the photo catalytic activity. Furthermore, by doping two C atoms, the band gap of heterojunction was further narrowed. Both the oxidation and reduction potential of CeO2(111)/hBN heterojunction meet the requirements of water splitting and has certain advantages over other photocatalysts in the ability for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The study revealed the possible mechanism of CeO2(111) and hBN monolayers compositing to facilitate photo- catalysis and hydrogen evolution ability, which may provide a possible reference direction for the practical design of more high-quality semiconductor photocatalysts.

Large linear wastewater ponds that lack anti-seepage measures can act as river channels that cause the deterioration of groundwater quality. This study investigated the groundwater recharge by leakage of the Tanghe Wastewater Reservoir, which is the largest industrial wastewater channel on the North China Plain. Additionally, water quality evolution was investigated using a combination of multivariate statistical methods, multi-tracers and geochemical methods. Stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen indicated high levels of wastewater evaporation. Based on the assumption that the wastewater was under an open system and fully mixed, an evaporation model was established to estimate the evaporation of the wastewater based on isotope enrichments of the Rayleigh distillation theory using the average isotope values for dry and rainy seasons. Using an average evaporation loss of 26.5% for the input wastewater, the estimated recharge fraction of wastewater leakage and irrigation was 73.5% of the total input of wastewater. The lateral regional groundwater inflow was considered to be another recharge source. Combing the two end-members mix model and cluster analysis revealed that the mixture percentage of the wastewater decreased from the Highly Affected Zone (76%) to the Transition Zone (5%). Ion exchange and redox reaction were the dominant geochemical processes when wastewater entered the aquifer. Carbonate precipitation was also a major process affecting evolution of groundwater quality along groundwater flow paths. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

On the basis of the experimental results, it is determined that the reaction time significantly influences the phase transition, microstructure and photocatalytic activity of the prepared samples. The possible mechanisms for the morphology evolution process have been systematically proposed. Moreover, the as-prepared products exhibit significant morphology-dependent photocatalytic activity. The flower-like W18O49 prepared at 6 h possesses a large specific surface area (150.1 m(2).g(-1)), improved separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs and decreased electron-transfer resistance according to the photoelectrochemical measurements. As a result, the flower-like W18O49 prepared at 6 h exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity for the degradation of Methyl orange aqueous solution. The radical trap experiments showed that the degradation of MO was driven mainly by the participation of h(+) and center dot O-2(-) radicals.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2079-4991			WOS:000392240000019	28335368

A standard solution of K4Fe(CN)(6)-KPi was utilized to benchmark the photocurrent and assess progressive surface oxidation on Ta3N5 in various oxidizing solutions. In this manner, a proportional increase in the surface oxygen concentration was detected with respect to oxidation time and further correlated with a continuous decline in the photocurrent. To discern how surface oxidation alters the photocurrent, we experimentally and theoretically explored its impact on the surface carrier recombination and the interfacial hole transfer rates. Our results indicate that the sluggish photocurrent demonstrated by oxidized Ta3N5 arises because of changes in both rates. In particular, the results suggest that the N-O replacement present on the Ta3N5 surface primarily increases the carrier recombination rate near the surface and to a lesser degree reduces the interfacial hole transfer rate. More generally, this methodology is expected to further our understanding of surface oxidation atop other nonoxide semiconductor photoelectrodes and its impact on their operation.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000643578300025	33835772

Catalyst coating on filter substrate is effective technology promoting regeneration, possessing the merits of high regeneration efficiency and low energy consumption. Filter regeneration depends on soot oxidation activity which is determined by catalyst and physicochemical properties. In this paper, oxidation activity of soot substitute at both with and without catalyst conditions is tested; moreover, soot feature evolutions during oxidation are analyzed. The results showed that thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) profiles of Printex-U and Printex-V were slightly shifted to low temperature directions by CeO2. The drop of Printex-U start oxidation temperature by CeO2 and Al2O3 was approximately 13.3 degrees C and 2 degrees C, respectively. Activation energy of Printex-U and Printex-V was increased significantly by CeO2 at the end of oxidation, with the maximum values reaching 500 kJ/mole and 400 kJ/mole, respectively. Oxygen-containing functional groups of Printex-U and Printex-V changed slightly in the first stage of oxidation process. Surface oxidation of Printex-U and Printex-V was enhanced by mixing catalyst, which facilitated soot particles to oxidize into small sizes.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000800405500005

The nickel complexes also play a very vital role in various biological activities. Here, three new ligands {H(2)mbhce = N'-(4-methyl-benzoyl), H(2)pchce = N'-(pyridine-carbonyl) and H(2)hbhce = N'-(2-hydroxy-benzoyl) hydrazine carbodithioic acid ethyl ester} and their corresponding Ni(ii) complexes [Ni(Hmbhce)(2)(py)(2)] (1), [Ni(pchce)(o-phen)(2)]center dot CH3OH center dot H2O (2) and [Ni(hbhce)(o-phen)(2)]center dot 1.75CHCl(3)center dot H2O (3) have been synthesized and fully characterized by various physicochemical and X-ray crystallography techniques. The photoluminescence study and thermal degradations were also examined. The treatment of K562 cells with the increasing concentrations of the nickel salts, ligands, and complexes 1, 2, and 3 showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity. The cytotoxic activity of ligands reveals that ligand H(2)mbhce is more potent in inhibiting the growth of tumor cells in comparison to other ligands H(2)pbhce and H(2)hbhce. Cytotoxicity assay results indicate that all complexes have remarkable cytotoxic potential in comparison to either nickel salts or the free ligands. Among these complexes, complex 1 has significantly better anti-tumor activity as compared to complexes 2 and 3. The electrochemical study of complexes 1, 2, and 3 for water oxidation reveals that all the complexes possess admirable electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and have lower overpotential (328, 338, and 370 mV, respectively) than many previously reported complexes and RuO2 (390 mV). Among complexes 1, 2, and 3, complex-2 shows a better water oxidation response. Consequently, these complexes have great potential to be utilized in fuel cells. The more reliable electrochemical parameter TOF is also calculated for all three complexes.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000699980300001	34568879

Defenses against such damage include a number of antioxidant enzymes that specifically target the removal or dismutation of the reactive agent. We report here the isolation and regional mapping of a human gene, TDPX1, that encodes an enzyme homologous to a yeast thioredoxin-dependent peroxide reductase (thioredoxin peroxidase, TPX). The human TDPX1 coding sequence was determined from the product of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of human cDNA. Eased on PCR analysis of DNA from a human/rodent somatic cell hybrid panel, the TDPX1 locus was assigned to chromosome 13. Further localization of the locus to 13q12 was accomplished by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, using as a probe DNA from a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) that contains the TDPX1 gene. It was also determined by PCR analysis of various YACs that the TDPX1 locus is in the region of the dinucleotide repeat markers D13S289 and D13S290. This regional mapping localizes the TDPX1 gene to a genomic region recently shown to contain the breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA2 and a gene associated with a form of muscular dystrophy. Oxygen radical metabolism has been hypothesized to be important for cancer, muscular dystrophy, and other disorders, so TDPX1 should be considered a candidate gene for these diseases.

J	VANWIJK, KJ; KRAUSE, GH								OXYGEN DEPENDENCE OF PHOTOINHIBITION AT LOW-TEMPERATURE IN INTACT PROTOPLASTS OF VALERIANELLA-LOCUSTA L								PLANTA				186	1			135	142		10.1007/BF00201509				1991	1991	Photoinhibition of photosynthesis in vivo is shown to be considerably promoted by O2 under circumstances where energy turnover by photorespiration and photosynthetic carbon metabolism are low. Intact protoplasts of Valerianella locusta L. were photoinhibited by 30 min irradiation with 3000-mu-mol photons.m-2.s-1 at 4-degrees-C in saturating [CO2] at different oxygen concentrations, corresponding to 2-40% O2 in air. The photoinhibition of light-limited CO2-dependent photosynthetic O2 evolution increased with increasing oxygen concentration. The uncoupled photochemical activity of photosystem II, measured in the presence of the electron acceptor 1,4-benzoquinone, and maximum variable fluorescence, F(V), were strongly affected and this inhibition was closely correlated to the O2 concentration. The effect of O2 did not saturate at the highest concentrations applied. An increase in photoinhibitory fluorescence quenching with [O2], although less pronounced than in protoplasts, was also observed with intact leaves irradiated at 4-degrees-C in air. Initial fluorescence, F(O), was slightly (about 10%) increased by the inhibitory treatments but not influenced by [O2]. A long-term cold acclimation of the plants did not substantially alter the O2-sensitivity of the protoplasts under the high-light treatment. From these experiments we conclude that oxygen is involved in the photoinactivation of photosystem II by excess light in vivo.									21	1	0	0	17	1	22			0032-0935	1432-2048		WOS:A1991GV36700019	24186586

TMDs combine the capacitive and faradaic contribution in the electrochemical response. However, due to the fact that the TMDs have a strong catalytic effect of promoting hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (HER and OER), their usage in aqueous ECs is questioned. Our study shows a hydrothermal L-cysteine-assisted synthesis of two composites based on different carbon materials- multiwalled carbon nanotubes (NTs) and carbon black (Black Pearl-BP2000)-on which MoS2 nanolayers were deposited. The samples were subjected to physicochemical characterization such as X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy which proved that the expected materials were obtained. Scanning electron microscopy coupled with electron dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) as well as transmission electron microscopy images confirmed vertical position of few-layered MoS2 structures deposited on the carbon supports. The synthetized samples were employed as electrode materials in symmetric ECs, and their electrochemical performance was evaluated and compared to their pure carbon supports. Among the composites, NTs/MoS2 demonstrated the best electrochemical metrics considering the conductivity and capacitance (150 Fg(-1)), whereas BP2000/MoS2 reached 110 Fg(-1) at a current load of 0.2 Ag-1. The composites were also employed in a two-electrode cell equipped with an additional reference electrode to monitor the potential range of both electrodes during voltage extension. It has been shown that the active edge sites of MoS2 catalyze the hydrogen evolution, and this limits the EC operational voltage below 1 V. Additional tests with linear sweep voltammetry allowed to determine the operational working voltage for the cells with all materials. It has been proven that the MoS2/carbon composites possess limited operating voltage, that is, comparable to a pure MoS2 material.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2296-598X			WOS:000657646000001

The reaction mechanism is investigated with a combination of electronic structure calculations, using the BEEF-vdW and HSE06 functionals, and mean-field micro kinetic modeling. Considered pathways include vacancy formation and oxidation, monomolecular dehydrogenation of methanol on reduced and nonreduced surfaces, bimolecular reactions between dehydrogenated intermediates, and precursor steps for hydrogen molybdenum phase (HyMoO(3-x)) formation. Methanol dissociation begins with C-H or O-H scission, with the O-H route found to be kinetically and thermodynamically preferred. Dehydrogenation of CH2O* to CHO* is slow in comparison to desorption, leading to complete selectivity toward CH2O. C-H scission of CH3O* and recombination of dissociated OH* to form H2O* are kinetically significant steps exhibiting positive degrees of rate control, while oxidation of the reduced surface through adsorbed O-2 has a negative degree of rate control. The energetics of the latter elementary step are somewhat sensitive to the choice of density functional, and although this does not affect the predicted reaction orders, the overall rate may change. To estimate the impact of the surface oxidation state on the kinetics, the external pressure of oxygen is varied in the microkinetic model, and the reaction rate is found to follow a volcano-like dependency, with the optimum rate located where surface oxidation neither promotes nor inhibits the overall rate. The methodology demonstrated in this study should be more broadly applicable to modeling catalytic kinetics on reducible oxide single-crystal surfaces.									48	2	0	0	0	0	48			2155-5435			WOS:000387306100001

This study focused on the incorporation of carbon quantum dots doped with nitrogen as a photosensitizer into mesoporous tungsten trioxide photoanodes (N-CQD/meso-WO3) using a surfactant self-assembly template approach. The crystal structure, composition, and morphology of pure and N-CQD- modified mesoporous WO3 photoanodes were investigated using scanning electron and transmission microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Due to their high surface area, enhanced optical absorption, and charge-carrier separation and transfer, the resulting N-CQD/meso-WO3 photoanodes exhibited a significantly enhanced photocurrent density of 1.45 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5 G illumination in 0.5 M Na2SO4 without any co-catalysts or sacrificial reagent, which was about 2.23 times greater than its corresponding pure meso-WO3. Moreover, the oxygen evolution onset potential of the N-CQD/meso-WO3 photoanodes exhibited a negative shift of 95 mV, signifying that both the charge-carrier separation and transfer processes were promoted.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15				2079-4991		WOS:000495666800157	31652537

Marcasite and pyrite formed under both oxic and anaerobic conditions, which is inconsistent with the traditionally assumed polysulfide route for FeS2 formation (oxidants required for polysulfide formation). The nature of the products was controlled by the level of supersaturation of the solution with respect to Fe disulfide minerals. Marcasite formed preferentially at low pH or S(-II)-deficient solutions (saturation index << 1000), while pyrite was the main product at saturation indices >1000.Different textures were obtained for the replacement of pyrrhotite by either pyrite or marcasite. Pyrite formation proceeded by direct replacement of pyrrhotite and, simultaneously, by overgrowth from solution. The pyrite crystals were >10 mu m in size and randomly oriented. In comparison, marcasite crystals were <1 mu m in size, and no significant overgrowth was observed. At pH(21 degrees C) <3, the marcasite nanocrystals showed the well-known crystallographic relationship with pynhotite, but at pH(21 degrees C) 3.96, the marcasite crystallites were randomly oriented. These experimental results confirm that the preservation of the crystallographic orientation is not a distinguishing feature between dissolution-reprecipitation and solid-state reactions. The different textures among pyrite and marcasite reflect the dominance of crystal growth (pyrite) vs. nucleation (marcasite) as a precipitation mechanism.									61	2	0	0	2	1	63			0003-004X	1945-3027		WOS:000297241400022

In situ DRIFTS and high-pressure (similar to 1 mbar) XPS experiments were performed to study the mechanism of the PROX reaction on Pt/ceria catalysts. The partial pressure of O-2 and/or CO was varied and correlated with induced changes in activity and selectivity as well as with the surface state and species under reaction conditions. Pt-carbonyl species changed rather insignificantly, especially relative to the wide variations of the product pattern with changing feed composition. Furthermore, the interconversion of for-mate and carbonate species was observed. Therefore, the changes in the evolution of surface species detected by in situ DRIFTS cannot explain the variation observed in CO oxidation activity. On the other hand, high-pressure XPS showed significant modification of the surface state with changing feed composition. Most significantly, oxygen vacancy formation seemed to correlate with enhanced CO oxidation activity. At higher vacancy density, water desorption was hindered. Highly hydrated ceria with significant vacancy density was found to be beneficial for the PROX process; here surface water blocked H-ads oxidation sites. Moreover, lower apparent activation energy of CO oxidation was measured in the PROX reaction on catalysts with more vacancies. The results given here reinforce the view of catalysts being adaptive to a certain reaction rather than having active sites as prepared. Whereas IR-detectable surface species may only be indicators and/or consequences of this surface change, formation of the beneficial surface/near-surface state may be the rate-limiting factor in several catalytic processes.

It is host to a variety of supernova (SN) progenitors and is therefore very important for galactic chemical evolution and stellar population studies. In this paper, we study the transition from super-AGB (SAGB) star to massive star and find that a propagating neon-oxygen-burning shell is common to both the most massive electron capture supernova (EC-SN) progenitors and the lowest mass iron-core-collapse supernova (FeCCSN) progenitors. Of the models that ignite neon-burning off-center, the 9.5 M-circle dot star would evolve to an FeCCSN after the neon-burning shell propagates to the center, as in previous studies. The neon-burning shell in the 8.8 M-circle dot model, however, fails to reach the center as the URCA process and an extended (0.6 M-circle dot) region of low Y-e (0.48) in the outer part of the core begin to dominate the late evolution; the model evolves to an EC-SN. This is the first study to follow the most massive EC-SN progenitors to collapse, representing an evolutionary path to EC-SN in addition to that from SAGB stars undergoing thermal pulses (TPs). We also present models of an 8.75 M-circle dot SAGB star through its entire TP phase until electron captures on Ne-20 begin at its center and of a 12 M-circle dot star up to the iron core collapse. We discuss key uncertainties and how the different pathways to collapse affect the pre-SN structure. Finally, we compare our results to the observed neutron star mass distribution.									132	1	0	0	0	0	132			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000322024700072		
J	Hong, Dikun; Lei, Ming; Yue, Shuang; Wang, Chunbo								Molecular insights into the role of char-bound hydrogen in char-NO reactions under high pressures: A reactive molecular dynamics simulation study								FUEL				308						121997	10.1016/j.fuel.2021.121997		SEP 2021		JAN 15 2022	2022	In the present work, the role of char-bound hydrogen in char-NO reaction under pressurized oxy-fuel combustion (POFC) conditions was studied using the reactive molecular dynamics (ReaxFF MD) simulations. The effects of char-bound hydrogen on the chemisorption of NO, formation of N-2, kinetics of char-NO reaction, and structure of char at different pressures and temperatures were investigated. The results show that the char-bound hydrogen hindered the chemisorption of NO, and inhibited the generation of CN. The role of char-bound hydrogen in the chemisorption of NO weakened with the increase in pressure. Considerable amount of H2O was generated during the reaction of NO with H-containing char, which proves that char-bound hydrogen provided another channel for the conversion of NO to N-2, especially at high pressures. The activation energies of the chemisorption of NO and the formation of N-2 during the reaction of NO with H-containing char were determined to be 174 and 126 kJ/mol, respectively. The ReaxFF MD simulation results were in good agreement with previous experimental and DFT values. The char-bound hydrogen increased the activation energies of the chemisorption of NO and the formation of N-2 by 40% and 29%, respectively. The role of char-bound hydrogen in char gasification and char structure were also examined. The char-bound hydrogen reduced the consumption of char, and CO was the main product from char gasification. The results of the O/C and N/C ratios of char indicate that char-bound hydrogen had little effect on the desorption of CO. By analyzing the dynamic evolution of char structure, it is found that char-bound hydrogen inhibited N-down chemisorption of NO.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000702881800001

However, the electrochemical behaviors of HET coupled with Faradic adsorption/desorption are complicated, and difficult to get the interface reaction kinetics quantitatively. In this paper, finite element method was adopted to simulate the cyclic voltammetric behaviors of HET coupled with Faradic adsorption/desorption processes by using the Ficks second law and Langmuir isotherm. The cyclic voltammograms when reactant or product adsorbed weakly or strongly were simulated, and they agreed well with the classical results. In addition, taking the reactant adsorption for example, the effects of scanning rate, saturated adsorption and adsorption equilibrium constant on cyclic voltammograms were investigated. The simulation demonstrates that weak adsorption can be magnified with the increasing scanning rate, and the peak current changes gradually from being proportional to the square root of scanning rate to being proportional to the scanning rate. The difference between anodic and cathodic peak currents is linearly related to saturated adsorption. Therefore, the quantitative characterization of saturated adsorption is realized by correlating the difference between anodic and cathodic peak currents to the saturated adsorption. With the increasing adsorption equilibrium constant, the weak adsorption transfers to strong adsorption, and the adsorption/desorption peaks separate from diffusion peaks to form prepeaks or postpeaks. The potential-dependent adsorption equilibrium constant was also simulated, which demonstrates that it can further change the shape and position of adsorption/desorption peaks. The quantitative method based on this model can help researchers to obtain saturated adsorption and adsorption equilibrium constant quantitatively from the cyclic voltammograms coupled with Faradic adsorption/desorption processes. The simulation can also help researchers to understand the different cyclic voltammetric behaviors between surface processes and diffusion processes, and would be constructive for the study of electrocatalysis involving adsorption/desorption processes.			法拉第吸脱附偶联过程的电化学行为较为复杂,难以定量获得其表界面反应动力学信息.本文通过COMSOL有限元软件对法拉第吸脱附偶联过程的循环伏安行为进行数值分析,研究了反应物或产物不同吸附条件下的循环伏安行为.结果表明:当反应物或产物弱吸附时,可通过阴、阳极峰电流之差实现饱和吸附量的定量表征.随着吸附平衡常数的增大,反应由弱吸附向强吸附过渡,峰电流由扩散峰与吸脱附峰相互重叠过渡到相互分离的吸脱附前波或后波特征.该吸脱附特征峰的形状和位置与电势依赖的吸附平衡常数有关.吸附平衡常数及其电势依赖程度越大,吸脱附峰偏离扩散峰越远,吸脱附峰越尖锐.该模型为法拉第吸脱附偶联过程的循环伏安研究提供了一种定量研究方法,能够帮助研究者从复杂的吸脱附伏安行为中定量获得饱和吸附量和吸附平衡常数等信息,并对涉及吸脱附的电催化研究具有一定指导意义.						1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1006-3471			CSCD:6796845

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) technology enables rational design and atomic utilization of catalyst by homogenously distributing catalytically active material on a variety of substrates. Here, a novel hierarchical nanostructured Co3O4 is decorated on carbon nanotubes by ALD (CNT@ Co3O4) and used as a catalyst for SABs. CNT@ Co3O4 demonstrates better performance and longer cycle life than a mechanically mixed CNT/Co3O4 nanocomposite. Well-dispersed ALD Co3O4 catalyst on CNTs, which serves as functionalized active sites, enables rapid electron exchange and high oxygen reduction/evolution activities. Synchrotron-based X-ray analysis including X-ray absorption near edge structure, extended X-ray absorption fine structure, and scanning transmission X-ray microscopy characterization techniques have been employed to elucidate the activity of Co3O4 and to investigate the nanoscale discharge product distribution found in SABs. This analysis reveals that Co3O4 catalyst can promote the electrochemical decomposition of sodium peroxide, superoxide, and carbonates. The role of the catalyst in SABs is clarified and discussed in detail.									32	1	0	0	1	0	32			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000399787900007		
J	HOFER, MU; SANTORE, UJ; WESTHOFF, P								DIFFERENTIAL ACCUMULATION OF THE 10-KDA, 16-KDA AND 23-KDA PERIPHERAL COMPONENTS OF THE WATER-SPLITTING COMPLEX OF PHOTOSYSTEM-II IN MESOPHYLL AND BUNDLE-SHEATH CHLOROPLASTS OF THE DICOTYLEDONOUS C4 PLANT FLAVERIA-TRINERVIA (SPRENG) C-MOHR								PLANTA				186	2			304	312						JAN 1992	1992	The differential expression of PSII genes was investigated in mesophyll and bundle-sheath cells of Flaveria trinervia, a dicotyledonous C4 plant of the NADP-malic enzyme type. A comprehensive immunoblot analysis showed that three extrinsic proteins of the water-splitting complex (10, 16 and 23 kDa) are selectively depleted in mature bundle-sheath chloroplasts. In contrast, the reaction-centre core remained virtually unaffected as inferred from the abundance of the 47-kDa chlorophyll-a-binding protein, the D1 and D2 polypeptides, cytochrome b559 and the 34-kDa polypeptide. The selective depletion of the 10-, 16- and 23-kDa polypeptides in bundle-sheath chloroplasts was paralleled by a diminished PSII capacity. On the basis of oxygen evolution in the presence of the artificial electron acceptor 2,5-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone, bundle-sheath chloroplasts maintained up to 23% of the PSII capacity shown by mesophyll chloroplasts. However, the levels of the 10-, 16- and 23-kDa proteins and, concomitantly, PSII activity varied to some degree and appeared to be correlated with environmental factors caused by seasonal changes. The selective depletion of the three members of the water-splitting complex was not reflected at the transcript level. The corresponding mRNAs were detectable in considerable amounts in bundle-sheath cells, indicating that the depletion of these proteins is regulated by post-transcriptional events. These findings reinforce the view that the peripheral proteins of the water-splitting complex are a focal point for controlling PSII activity in bundle-sheath chloroplasts of both mono- and dicotyledonous C4 plants of the NADP-malic enzyme subtype.									40	0	0	0	35	0	41			0032-0935			WOS:A1992HA72600017	24186670

The malonic acid-bromate reaction in acidic media								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A				110	3			990	996		10.1021/jp055259o				JAN 26 2006	2006	The title reaction was studied with various techniques in 1 M sulfuric acid, a usual medium for the oscillatory Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction. It was found to be a more complex process than the bromomalonic acid (BrMA)-BrO3- reaction studied previously in the first part of this work. Malonic acid (MA) can react with acidic bromate by two parallel mechanisms. The main aim of the present research was to determine the mechanisms, the rate laws, and the rate constants for these parallel channels. In one reaction channel the first molecular products are glyoxalic acid (GOA) and CO2 while in the other channel mesoxalic acid (MOA) is the first molecular intermediate, that is, no CO2 is formed in this step. To prove these two independent routes specific colorimetric techniques were developed to determine GOA and MOA selectively. The rate of the GOA channel was determined by following the rate of the carbon dioxide evolution characteristic for this reaction route. In this step, regarding it as an overall process, one MA is oxidized to GOA and CO2 and one BrO3- is reduced to HOBr, which forms BrMA with another MA. The initial rate of the GOA channel is a bilinear function of the initial MA and BrO3_ concentrations with a second-order rate constant k(GOA) = 2.4 x 10(-7) M-1 s(-1). The rate of the other channel was calculated from the rate of the BrO3- consumption measured in separate experiments, assuming that the measured depletion is a sum of two separate terms reflecting the consumptions due to the two independent channels. In the MOA channel one MA is oxidized to MOA and one BrO3_ is consumed while another MA is brominated as in the GOA channel. It was found that the initial rate of the MOA channel is also a bilinear function of the MA and BrO3- concentrations with a second-order rate constant k(MOA) = 2.46 x 10(-6) M-1 s(-1). Separate chemical mechanisms are suggested for both channels. In all of the various bromate-substrate reactions of these mechanisms oxygen atom transfer from the bromate to the substrate occurs generating bromous acid intermediate. This can be of high importance in BZ systems as bromous acid is the autocatalytic intermediate there. GOA and MOA also can be oxidized by acidic bromate but a study of these reactions will be published later.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			1089-5639			WOS:000235046100021	16419999

Pure fatigue damage, which is assumed to evolve independent of time, is correlated using the cyclic J integral. For test temperatures exceeding about 600 degrees C, oxygen-induced embrittlement of the material ahead of the advancing crack tip is the dominating environmental effect. To model the contribution of this damage mechanism to fatigue crack growth, extensive use of metallographic measurements was made. Comparisons between stress-free annealed samples and fatigued specimens revealed that oxygen uptake is strongly enhanced by cyclic plastic straining. In fatigue tests with a temperature below about 500 degrees C, the contribution of oxidation was found to be negligible, and the detrimental environmental effect was attributed to the reaction of water vapor with freshly exposed material at the crack tip. Both environmental degradation mechanisms contributed to damage evolution only in out-of-phase TMF tests, and thus, this loading mode is most detrimental. Electron microscopy revealed that cyclic stress-strain response and crack initiation mechanisms are affected by the change from planar dislocation slip to a more wavy type as test temperature is increased. The predictive capabilities of the model are shown to result from the close correlation with the microstructural observations.									32	1	0	0	0	0	32			1073-5623			WOS:000085248700013

Herein, bean sprout-like Co-TiO2/Ti nanostructures were first synthesized by thermal treatment at 800 degrees C under Ar-flow conditions using sacrificial ZIF-67 templated on Ti sheets. It was observed that ZIF-67 on Ti sheets started to thermally decompose at around 350 degrees C and was converted to the cubic phase Co3O4. The head of the bean sprout structure was observed to be Co3O4, while the stem showed a crystal structure of rutile TiO2 grown from the metallic Ti support. Cu sputter-deposited Co-TiO2/Ti nanostructures were also prepared for photocatalytic and electrocatalytic CO2 reduction performances, as well as electrochemical oxygen reaction (OER). Gas chromatography results after photocatalytic CO2 reduction showed that CH3OH, CO and CH4 were produced as major products with the highest MeOH selectivity of 64% and minor C-2 compounds of C2H2, C2H4 and C2H6. For electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, CO, CH4 and C2H4 were meaningfully detected, but H-2 was dominantly produced. The amounts were observed to be dependent on the Cu deposition amount. Electrochemical OER performances in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte exhibited onset overpotentials of 330-430 mV (vs. RHE) and Tafel slopes of 117-134 mV/dec that were dependent on Cu-loading thickness. The present unique results provide useful information for synthesis of bean sprout-like Co-TiO2/Ti hybrid nanostructures and their applications to CO2 reduction and electrochemical water splitting in energy and environmental fields.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2079-4991		WOS:000689936300001	34443738

However, most of the recently explored photocatalysts for N-2 fixation are in the powder form, suffering from agglomeration and difficulty in the collection and leading to unsatisfactory conversion efficiency. Developing efficient film catalysts for N-2 photofixation under ambient conditions remains challenging. Herein, we report the efficient photofixation of N-2 over a periodic WS2@TiO2 nanoporous film, which is fabricated through a facile method that combines anodization, E-beam evaporation, and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Oxygen vacancies are introduced into TiO2 nanoporous films through Ar annealing treatment, which plays a vital role in N-2 adsorption and activation. The periodic WS2@TiO2 nanoporous film with an optimized WS2 content shows highly efficient photocatalytic performance for N-2 fixation with an NH3 evolution rate of 1.39 mmol g(-1) h(-1), representing one of the state-of-the-art catalysts.									28	1	0	0	1	0	28			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000508855700008

TEM imaging of the top layer at various temperature provided evidences of the evolution of top oxide layer, while the associated chemistry explored through TOF-SIMS spectra and depth profiles revealed an interesting transformation of the oxide layer in to a carbide-dominated layer between similar to 200-400 degrees C. The oxide layer transformation dominated at the vacuum-oxide interface until 250 degrees C, beyond which, oxygen diffusion and carbon enrichment at the metal-oxide interface and associated reactions transitioned the layer to a thin Nb(OC) mixed layer up to similar to 1-2 nm from top surface, followed by a uniform carbide layer of similar to 5 nm thickness. Furthermore, desorption of bulk H was found to be co-related to the oxide layer transition up to 350 degrees C, beyond which, near surface hydrogen enrichment became the dominating factor. Finally, the proposed mechanisms were applied to understand the surface contamination and nitrogen doping during standard HTD of Nb samples.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000514902000079

Maximizing the utilization of Pt based materials by modulating their morphologies to expose more active sites is a fundamental objective for the practical application of fuel cells. Herein, we report a new class of hierarchically skeletal Pt-Ni nanocrystals (HSNs) with a multi-layered structure, prepared by an inorganic acid-induced solvothermal method. The addition of H2SO4 to the synthetic protocol provides a critical trigger for the successful growth of Pt-Ni nanocrystals with the desired structure. The Pt-Ni HSNs synthesized by this method exhibit enhanced mass activity of 1.25 A mg(pt)(-1) at 0.9 V (versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) towards ORR in 0.1-M HClO4, which is superior to that of Pt-Ni multi-branched nanocrystals obtained by the same method in the absence of inorganic acid; it is additionally 8.9-fold higher than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Meanwhile, it displays enhanced stability, with only 21.6% mass activity loss after 10,000 cycles (0.6-1.0 V) for ORR. Furthermore, the Pt-Ni HSNs show enhanced activity and anti-toxic ability in CO for MOR. The superb activity of the Pt-Ni HSNs for ORR and MOR is fully attributed to an extensively exposed electrochemical surface area and high intrinsic activity, induced by strain effects, provided by the unique hierarchically skeletal alloy structure. The novel open and hierarchical structure of Pt-Ni alloy provides a promising approach for significant improvements of the activity of Pt based alloy electrocatalysts.

Carbon materials as the cathode, however, limit both the cycling performance and the energy efficiency of the rechargeable Li-CO2 battery, due to the insulating Li2CO3 formed in the discharge process, which is difficult to decompose in the charge process. Here, a Mo2C/carbon nanotube composite material is developed as the cathode for the rechargeable Li-CO2 battery and can achieve high energy efficiency (77%) and improved cycling performance (40 cycles). A related mechanism is proposed that Mo2C can stabilize the intermediate reduction product of CO2 on discharge, thus preventing the formation of insulating Li2CO3. In contrast to insulating Li2CO3, this amorphous Li2C2O4-Mo2C discharge product can be decomposed below 3.5 V on charge. The introduction of Mo2C provides an effective solution to the problem of low round-trip efficiency in the Li-CO2 battery.									156	8	0	0	4	0	159			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000405926800005

The results of the PAC measurements on samples thermally treated at temperatures from 400 to 1300 degrees C indicate that Hf is surrounded only by oxygen at all studied temperatures. This finding is in agreement with the evolution pathway of polymer-derived SiHfOC ceramics, which were reported to be generated as single-phase amorphous materials upon pyrolysis of alkoxide-modified polysiloxanes and subsequently to phase separate and crystallize towards HfO2/SiOC nanocomposites. Thus, the results presented here support our previous statement that there is a thermodynamic control on the phase separation and crystallization behavior of Si-M-O-C (M = metal) ceramics (Ionescu et al. 96;2013:1899-1903), which in the case of Hf leads to the precipitation and crystallization of hafnia nanoparticles within a SiOC matrix.

We show that the latter advanced oxidation method gives the best results: it is a Fenton-type degradation of the target pollutants taking place in the cathodic compartment by reason of the highly oxidizing environment brought about by radicals that are formed mainly in the reactions of O-3 with OH- and HO2-.

The rate constant determined by SI-SECM was sensitive to the nature of the Pt oxide formed at different potentials. A simplified model with finite element method simulation was used to fit the SI-SECM experimental response. The extraction of kinetic constants and their comparison to the potential (reducing power) of the mediator yielded a Marcus-theory type relationship. Although these are clearly not outer sphere reactions, if subjected to the Marcus theory treatment, one can extract an estimated value of lambda = 1.3 +/- 0.3 eV for the reduction of "place exchanged" oxide, which forms with oxide coverage values larger than 0.5 (as PtO). Steady state feedback experiments were also conducted in which the reduced form of the mediators was oxidized at Pt with different oxide coverage, i.e., over a wide range of potentials. A comparison of SI-SECM kinetic analysis with the Pt substrate at open circuit to the case where an electrode bias is applied indicates that for Fe(II)[EDTA](2-), the feedback current follows the oxide coverage at the Pt substrate. We suggest that thin layers of oxide provide a chemical route in which the oxide mediates oxidation of the reduced electrogenerated species; this route is governed by the reactivity of the different species of oxide formed at the electrode and not necessarily by other effects, such as direct electron tunneling through the oxide layer.									43	1	0	0	5	0	43			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000283519400048

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations with a computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model are applied to study the hydrogenation of CO2 on the two-dimensional (2D) M3C2 transition metal carbide (MXenes) surface. It is demonstrated that the adsorbed CO2 is activated and can combine with surface hydrogen to form bicarbonate species, thus leading to more competitive selectivity for the CO2RR than the HER. All possible conversion pathways for carbon dioxide to methane are explored, and it is found that the formation of the bicarbonate (HCO2) species is energetically the most favourable reaction pathway, whereas the main intermediate of the CO2RR is HCHO. Detailed characterization of the initial activation, scaling relationships, protonation steps and electrode overpotential, together with the evaluation of the limiting potentials for several reaction mechanisms, reveals that MXene M3C2 exhibits a high catalytic performance for CO2, providing novel fuel cells.									30	3	0	0	2	0	31			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000529531500020	32236195

Using cyclic voltammetry to track the surface composition overtime, we carried out a detailed study of metal migration in a well-defined model Au-Pd core-shell nanocatalyst. When subjected to electrochemical conditions, Au migration from the core to the shell was observed. The effect of Pd shell thickness and electrolyte identity on the extent of migration was studied. Migration of metals during catalytic ethanol oxidation was found to alter the particle's surface composition and electronic structure, enhancing the core shell particles' activity. We show that metal migration in core-shell nanoparticles is a phenomenon common to numerous electrochemical systems and must be considered when studying electrochemical catalysis.									51	2	0	0	3	0	53			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000342184400068	25185075

The high capacity comes from the activation of inactive Li2MnO3 in the high voltage range (>4.5 V). However, many adverse factors appear along with the activation process, such as low initial coulombic efficiency and severe capacity and voltage fading during cycling, which limit the commercialization of Li-rich materials. This review based on existing research on the electrochemistry of Li-rich materials presents an introduction to the reaction mechanism, challenges and strategies and prospects.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2052-1553			WOS:000680392400001

The isolated FeN(4)sites lower the energy barrier for the key intermediate in the CO(2)reduction process, leading to the enhanced selectivity for CO production with a faradaic efficiency of up to 93%.									55	7	0	0	3	0	55				2198-3844		WOS:000571219100026	32995135

In this regard, unveiling all the physical principles that determine their activity would be enormously beneficial for the rational design of novel catalysts with improved performance. Within this context, this work explores the activity of bulk molybdenum-based transition metal nitrides in ammonia synthesis. Our results highlight that the most active compositions show increasing ferromagnetism in the metal-nitrogen bonds, which constitute the active sites. We observe that the total spin accumulated in the bonds at the active sites is a physically meaningful descriptor to discriminate optimum catalysts. Higher activities are associated with ferromagnetic phases, and the underlying reason is an enhanced overlapping of the electronic wavefunctions; which also make the reaction steps spin-sensitive. These finding provides strong evidence of the general influence of electrons magnetic moment in catalysis, being part of the specific field of spintro-catalysis.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000449718600005	30137677

Working in alkaline as opposed to acidic media yields a number of tangible benefits, including (i) the ability to use cheaper and plentiful precious-metal-free catalysts, due to their increased stability, (ii) a reduction in the amount of degradation and corrosion of Pt based catalysts, and (iii) a longer operational lifetime for the overall fuel cell configuration. However, in the absence of Pt, no catalyst has achieved activities similar to those of Pt. Herein, we have synthesized a number of crystalline ultrathin PtM alloy nanowires (NWs) (M = Fe, Co, Ru, Cu, Au) in order to replace a portion of the costly Pt metal without compromising on activity while simultaneously adding in metals known to exhibit favorable synergistic ligand and strain effects with respect to the host lattice. In fact, our experiments confirm theoretical insights about a clear and correlative dependence between measured activity and chemical composition. We have conclusively demonstrated that our as-synthesized alloy NW catalysts yield improved hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activities as compared with a commercial Pt standard as well as with our as-synthesized Pt NWs. The Pt7Ru3 NW system, in particular, quantitatively achieved an exchange current density of 0.493 mA/cm(2), which is higher than the corresponding data for Pt NWs alone. Additionally, the HOR activities follow the same expected trend as their calculated hydrogen binding energy (HBE) values, thereby confirming the critical importance and correlation of HBE with the observed activities.									96	13	0	0	4	0	98			2155-5435			WOS:000377326700062

The present paper rectifies this misunderstanding by demonstrating that the energy actually consumed in the degradation process is much less than that wasted in the side reaction of oxygen evolution. To minimize the side reaction, the possible highest instantaneous current efficiency (PHICE) for electrochemical oxidation of phenol at Boron-doped Diamond (BDD), Ti/SnO2-Sb/PbO2 (PbO2), and Ti/SnO2-Sb (SnO2) anodes has been investigated systematically, and found to reach almost 100% at the BDD anode compared with 23% at the PbO2 anode and 9% at the SnO2 anode. The significant discrepancy between PHICE values at the various anodes is interpreted in terms of different existing forms of hydroxyl radicals. For each anode system, the PHICEs are maintained experimentally using a computer-controlled exponential decay current mode throughout the electrolysis process. For applications, the minimized energy consumption is predicted by response surface methodology, and demonstrated for the BDD anode system. Consequently, almost 100% current efficiency is achieved (for a relatively meagre energy consumption of 17.2 kWh kgCOD(-1)) along with excellent COD degradation efficiency by optimizing the initial current density, flow rate, electrolysis time, and exponential decay constant. Compared with galvanostatic conditions, over 70% of the energy is saved in the present study, thus demonstrating the great potential of electrochemical oxidation for practical applications.

Here we report that a composite catalyst, nickel nanoparticles supported on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes, has hydrogen oxidation activity similar to platinum-group metals in alkaline electrolyte. Although nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes are a very poor hydrogen oxidation catalyst, as a support, it increases the catalytic performance of nickel nanoparticles by a factor of 33 (mass activity) or 21 (exchange current density) relative to unsupported nickel nanoparticles. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the nitrogen-doped support stabilizes the nanoparticle against reconstruction, while nitrogen located at the edge of the nanoparticle tunes local adsorption sites by affecting the d-orbitals of nickel. Owing to its high activity and low cost, our catalyst shows significant potential for use in low-cost, high-performance fuel cells.									274	17	0	0	16	0	277			2041-1723			WOS:000369028900001	26762466

The high surface area and the tailorable nature of MOFs make them ideal candidates for catalyst design. Therefore, they have been investigated as catalysts for a variety of processes including electrochemical reactions. Herein, we focus on their use as catalysts for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), which is a promising technology for converting waste CO2 into valuable carbon-based chemicals. Recent studies have shown that CO2 can be selectively reduced using MOF-based catalysts, furthermore, MOFs in catalysis have the key advantage of using well-defined single-atom active sites. This is helpful to understand and optimize the structural parameters that control their performance towards the CO2RR. Despite these advantages and the promising early results, there are some important limitations that need to be overcome, namely the poor conductivity and stability of MOFs, which need to be addressed in future studies. In addition, more systematic studies are needed to gain fundamental understanding of the structural parameters that control the performance of MOF-based catalysts.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000744609200001

For instance, it has been argued(1-4) that small changes in the balance between two potential greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide and methane, may have dictated the feedback cycle involving organic haze production and global cooling. Climate models have focused on carbon dioxide as the greenhouse gas responsible for maintaining above-freezing surface temperatures during a time of low solar luminosity(5,6). However, the analysis of 2.75-billion-year (Gyr)-old(7) palaeosols-soil samples preserved in the geologic record-have recently provided an upper constraint on atmospheric carbon dioxide levels well below that required in most climate models to prevent the Earth's surface from freezing. This finding prompted many to look towards methane as an additional greenhouse gas to satisfy climate models(1,4,8,9). Here we use model equilibrium reactions for weathering rinds on 3.2-Gyr-old river gravels to show that the presence of iron-rich carbonate relative to common clay minerals requires a minimum partial pressure of carbon dioxide several times higher than present-day values. Unless actual carbon dioxide levels were considerably greater than this, climate models(5,6,8) predict that additional greenhouse gases would still need to have a role in maintaining above-freezing surface temperatures.									101	1	0	0	31	0	102			0028-0836			WOS:000220823800035	15085128

Highly intelligent natural systems overcomes selectivity issues with biological catalysts, predominantly with porphyrins such as cytochromes, catalyzing the oxidation-reduction processes, transport of dioxygen, destruction of peroxide, electron transfer reactions etc. and all form of life depends on it. These biological catalysts smartly tailored on the way to specific substrate and exert high levels of stereo-, regio- and chemo-selectivity. Porphyrins are tetradentate, very stable pi-conjugated macrocyclic compounds that can accommodate almost all metals in their central cavity and offer a high architectural flexibility in structure, which facilitates the chemical and biological parameters over a very broad range. Natural systems functions rather in a different way over the laboratory systems when it comes to entail selectivity in chemical conversions. Mimicking the bio-inspired chemistry associated with natural porphyrin complexes using synthetic porphyrinoids provide the cost effective, reliable alternatives to the other catalytic options. These porphyrinoid complexes are now well documented and creating their space as catalyst for various important organic transformations such as selective direct activation of inactivated C-H bonds (hydroxylation, halogenations, cyanation etc), oxidations, reductions, C-C and C-N couplings, refining of chemicals etc. Although, some researchers have compiled the different aspects of porphyrinoids, however, their contribution in deciding the reaction selectivities is an interesting idea to describe. Herein, our aim is to resolve the structural components of porphyrinoids accountable for the generation of selectivities in a chemical reaction and to describe how these porphyrinoids are controlling the selectivities through mechanistic considerations.

We make pair-wise comparative analyses between the supercomplexes from plants and green algae to gain insights about the evolution of the PSII-LHCII supercomplexes involving the peripheral small PSII subunits that might have been acquired during the evolution and about the energy transfer pathways that define their light-harvesting and photoprotective properties.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0032-0781	1471-9053		WOS:000715876600006	34038564	
J	Diao, Ruimin; Ye, Haonan; Yang, Zhicheng; Zhang, Shicong; Kong, Kangyi; Hua, Jianli								Significant improvement of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of diketopyrrolopyrrole-based donor-acceptor conjugated polymers through side-chain engineering								POLYMER CHEMISTRY				10	47			6473	6480		10.1039/c9py01404g				DEC 21 2019	2019	Donor-acceptor (D-A) type conjugated organic polymers exhibited great potential for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution due to their diverse synthetic approaches, tunable energy band, and electronic structure. But the poor dispersion of most conjugated organic polymers limited their photocatalytic performance. Herein, we designed and developed a series of D-A type conjugated organic polymers with benzene as the donor and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) with different side chains on N sites as the acceptor. We changed the length of the side chain and further introduced oxygen atoms on side chains. As a result, the hydrogen evolution rate (HER) of PDPP3B-O4 with a short butoxy chain as the side chain was 5.53 mmol h(-1) g(-1) with 1 wt% Pt loading (lambda > 400 nm), which increased 110 times compared to PDPP3B-C8 with a long octyl chain. All polymers showed outstanding photocatalytic stability. Notably, an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 5.7% at 450 nm was achieved by PDPP3B-O4, and even a still high AQY of 1.13% at 600 nm was obtained due to its excellent light capture capability. PDPP3B-O4 showed a superior photocatalytic performance because of the wider absorption spectrum and better wettability via side chain engineering.									9	1	0	0	1	0	10			1759-9954	1759-9962		WOS:000501007300006

The physical origin of the observed anion redox remains debatable, and more direct experimental evidence is needed. In this work, we have shown electronic signatures of oxygen-oxygen coupling, direct evidence central to lattice oxygen redox (O2-/(O-2)(n-)), in charged Li2-xRuO3 after Ru oxidation (Ru-4(+)/Ru5+) upon first electron removal with lithium deintercalation. Experimental Ru L-3-edge high-energy-resolution fluorescence-detected X-ray absorption spectra (HERFD-XAS), supported by ab initio simulations, revealed that the increased intensity in the high-energy shoulder upon lithium deintercalation resulted from increased O-O coupling, inducing (O-O) sigma*-like states with pi overlap with Ru d-manifolds, in agreement with O K-edge XAS spectra. Experimental and simulated O K-edge X-ray emission spectra further supported this observation with the broadening of the oxygen nonbonding feature upon charging, also originated from (O-O) sigma* states. This lattice oxygen redox of Li2-xRuO3 was accompanied by a small amount of O-2 evolution in the first charge from differential electrochemistry mass spectrometry but diminished in the subsequent cycles, in agreement with the more reduced states of Ru in later cycles from Ru L-3-edge HERFD-XAS. These observations indicated that Ru redox contributed more to discharge capacities after the first cycle. This study has pinpointed the key spectral fingerprints related to lattice oxygen redox from a molecular level and constructed a transferrable framework to rationally interpret the spectroscopic features by combining advanced experiments and theoretical calculations to design materials for Li-ion batteries and electrocatalysis applications.									38	5	0	0	2	0	40			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000489678800007	32210521

The influential effects of several important experimental parameters on the shape of Pt nanocrystals were systematically investigated, demonstrating that L-lysine and oxidative etching were critical to the morphological control and evolution of Pt nanocuboids. Due to the unique orientation and size effects, the as-prepared Pt nanocuboids exhibited significantly enhanced catalytic activity and stability towards the ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) in comparison with commercial Pt black catalysts.									25	3	0	0	1	0	25			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000343961300023

Pt/CuNWs are studied as a hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) catalyst in base along with Cu templated Pt nanotubes (PtNT (Cu)), a 5% Cu monolayer on a bulk polycrystalline Pt electrode (5% ML Cu/BPPt), BPPt, and carbon supported Pt (Pt/C). Comparison of these catalysts demonstrates that the inclusion of Cu benefited the HOR activity of Pt/CuNWs likely by providing compressive strain on Pt; surface Cu further aids in hydroxyl adsorption, thereby improving the HOR activity of Pt/CuNWs. Pt/CuNWs exceed the area and mass exchange current densities of carbon supported Pt by 3.5 times and 1.9 times.									120	8	0	0	5	0	121			0002-7863			WOS:000330163200044	23952885

However, its practical application is hindered by its poor performance in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and poor stability in electrolytes. Here, we introduced a conductive indium tin oxide (ITO) protective layer for superior interface charge transfer and developed a synergistic strategy by combining the protective layer with a NiOx catalyst layer for favorable kinetic overpotential. Thus, we delivered a photocurrent density as high as 7.64 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus RHE on the double junction microcrystalline silicon (mu c-Si: H) solar cell PEC device in 1 M NaOH electrolyte. This current density is 37 times higher than that of the device with only NiOx under the same conditions. The mu c-Si : H solar cell with ITO and NiOx layers has a maximum efficiency of 2% at an applied bias of 0.85 V vs. RHE. Our work will open up new opportunities for designing and preparing high-performance and non-noble PEC water splitting devices.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000417706600016

All investigations were performed in situ under UHV conditions. A 10nm thick MgO film was prepared via oxidation of a Mg overlayer on a clean polycrystalline Cu substrate. The MgO electronic structure was completely screened after deposition of a few monolayers of Pd and the Pd-related TCS fine structure appeared. We observed an irreversible NO2 adsorption on the Pd layer. A negative charge transfer to adsorbed molecules and appearance of new adsorption-induced unoccupied bands were revealed. These new bands are considered as a result of hybridisation of palladium and unoccupied oxygen orbitals. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Replacement of precious catalysts with cost-effective and highly active alternatives is still a great challenge. Herein, based on theoretical predictions, holey structures are designed and fabricated on the free-standing conventional 2D OER catalyst. By well-controlled defects engineering, uniform tiny holes are created on the free-standing Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets via a sol-gel method, with the embedded Zn components as the template for holes production. The whole preparation process is feasible and effective to make full use of the basal plane of 2D nanomaterials, which can provide higher surface area, richer defects, more grain boundaries, and edge sites, as well as greater distorted surfaces. Meanwhile, these holes developed inside the sheet structure can supply tremendous permeable channels for ions adsorption and transportation, enable a fast interfacial charge transfer and accelerate the reaction process. The as-prepared 2D holey Ni(OH)(2) nanostructures exhibit excellent catalytic performance toward electrochemical water oxidation, with lower onset overpotentials and higher current densities compared with the pristine Ni(OH)(2) catalyst, suggesting the holey defects engineering is a promising strategy for efficient water-splitting devices and rechargeable metal-air batteries.									80	8	0	0	1	0	83			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000404986200009	28544425

Due to the phosphorization process, additional active sites coming from Fe2P boost the electrocatalytic activity of Fe@Fe2P/NCNT resulting in decrement in overpotentials by 40.3 mV and 186 mV for 10 mA cm(-2) and 50 mA cm(-2) compared to Fe/NCNT electrocatalyst, respectively. Meanwhile, Fe@Fe2P/NCNT exhibits ignorable degradation in HER activity after 6000 potential cycles suggesting that the Fe@Fe2P/NCNT with superior HER activity and stability could potentially replace the benchmark Pt/C (overpotential@10 mA cm(-2): 31 mV) as efficient HER electrocatalyst for water splitting.									21	3	0	0	0	0	21			2196-0216			WOS:000462598900019

One technologically relevant example is the case of mixed ionic/electronic conductor (MIEC)-metal interfaces, which play an important role in electrochemistry. Metal-MIEC composite electrodes can demonstrate improved catalytic activity vs single-phase MIECs, improving fuel cell efficiency. Similarly, MIEC surface reaction kinetics are often evaluated using techniques that place metal current collectors in contact with the surface under evaluation, potentially altering the response vs the native surface. Techniques enabling direct and local in situ observation of the behavior at and around such heterointerfaces are needed. Here, we develop a spatially resolved optical transmission relaxation (2D-OTR) method providing continuous evaluation of local, high-temperature, controlled atmosphere defect kinetics across a similar to 1 cm2 sample area simultaneously in a contact-free manner. We apply it to observe the spatial variance of oxygen incorporation and evolution rates at similar to 525-620 degrees C, in response to step changes in oxygen partial pressure, on MIEC SrTi0.65Fe0.35O3-x films as a function of distance from porous Pt and Au layers. Using this model geometry, we find significant enhancements in kinetics adjacent to the metals that decay over a few millimeter distance. To extract kinetic parameters, we fit the short-term optical data (initial portion of relaxations) with an exponential decay function appropriate for surface-exchange-limited kinetics, yielding apparent surface exchange coefficients (kchem) with spatial resolution, decreasing with distance from the metal. To understand the kinetic processes governing the complete (long-term) optical relaxations, we performed COMSOL simulations, which demonstrated that a combination of laterally varying kchem and in-plane diffusion controls the observed kinetics over the full time range. Further support for spatially varying kchem comes from demonstrations of changing surface and bulk chemistry vs distance from the metal-MIEC interface, by X-ray photoelectron and optical absorption spectroscopies, respectively. Although microporous Pt and Au are not excellent electrodes in isolation, both metals exert a synergistic effect on the oxygen surface exchange rate in the presence of the mixed conducting film.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000871021600001	36226963

The irregular shaped TTA1-02 (5X3mm) consists mostly of olivine grains of ca. 5mum in diameter. Olivine grains of Mg-rich (Fo(9.5) and Fe-rich (Fo(60)) composition are in direct contact with each other, with a sharp cornpositional boundary. Oxygen isotopic compositions of Fe-rich olivine grains are O-16-poor (Delta(17)O congruent to -5parts per thousand), whereas Mg-rich olivine is O-16-rich (Delta(17)O congruent to -25parts per thousand). Several Al-rich inclusions (<ca. 500 mum in diameter) are enclosed by olivine grains in the AOA. Oxygen isotopic compositions of spinel and fassaite in Al-rich inclusions are O-16-rich (Delta(17)O congruent to -20parts per thousand , whereas those of anorthite, nepheline and phyllosilicate are O-16-poor (Delta(17)O congruent to 5parts per thousand). We propose the following sequence of events during the formation of AOAs in the Allende meteorite: 1) Formation of Al-rich inclusions with 160-rich oxygen isotopic composition; 2) Accretion of Mg-rich olivine grains with 160-rich oxygen isotopic composition around Al-rich inclusions; 3) Accretion into parent body; and 4) Aqueous alteration in the parent body, which led to crystallization of O-16-poor minerals, Fe-rich olivine, anorthite, nepheline, and phyllosilicate. This is reflecting reactions among primary 160-rich AOA minerals and aqueous fluid having O-16-poor oxygen isotopic composition. Fe-rich olivine grains precipitated from aqueous fluids, which partially dissolved pre-existing Mg-rich olivine grains. Sintering and Mg-Fe diffusion occurred during thermal metamorphism. Anorthite, nepheline and phyllosilicate in M-rich inclusions replaced primary anorthite or melilite during the aqueous alteration stage.

To solve this problem, the carbon felt (CF) decorated with bismuth hydrogen edetate (Bi(HEDTA)) complex was synthesized and studied as anode for VRFB. The cyclic voltammetry curve reflects the great improvement in electrochemical reversibility by reducing the peak potential difference from 0.73 to 0.50 V. Electrochemical impedance spectrum shows the better charge transfer process by reducing the charge transfer resistance from 7.14 to 1.13 omega. The VRFB assembled by the CF modified with Bi(HEDTA) exhibits an energy efficiency of 66.25% at a current density of 160 mA cm(-2), which is 11.76% higher than that of the pristine system. Moreover, the mechanism of Bi(HEDTA) involved in the anodic half-reaction of VRFB has been put forward. The results demonstrate that not only the metal but also the ligand of the complex are significant for improving the electrochemical activity of the reaction towards V3+/V2+ redox couple. In more detail, the oxygen-containing functional groups in the ligand could increase the wettability of the CF as well as act as the active sites, and the metal could decrease the evolution of hydrogen at the same time. Therefore, the effective combination of the respective functions of ligand and metal, makes Bi(HEDTA) a feasible ornament of the CF for VRFB.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000481943500021

Here, the electron transfer reaction mechanism from cytochrome c(6) to photosystem I from the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum has been analyzed by laser-flash absorption spectroscopy. Kinetic traces of photosystem I reduction fit to biphasic curves, the analysis of the observed rate constants indicating that electron transfer occurs in a cytochrome c(6)/photosystem I transient complex, which undergoes a reorganization process from the initial encounter complex to the optimized final configuration. The mild ionic strength dependence of the rate constants makes evident the relatively weak electrostatically attractive nature of the interaction. Taken together, these results indicate that the "red" Phaeodactylum system is less efficient than "green" systems, both in the formation of the properly arranged (cytochrome c(6)/photosystem I) complex and in the electron transfer itself. The results obtained from cross-reactions with cytochrome c(6) and photosystem I from cyanobacteria, green algae, and plants shed light on the different evolutionary pathway of the electron transfer to photosystem I in diatoms with regard to the way that it evolved in higher plants.									9	0	0	0	8	0	9			0006-2960			WOS:000327999300008	24180741

Alloying a second metal with noble metals offers an available way to decrease their usage and consumption and enhances their catalytic activity. Among the potential candidates, Sn is a high abundance element in the earth. In this work, a new highly active low-cost Pd-Sn/RGO catalyst has been developed. Under optimized conditions, the hydrogen evolution rate reached up to 530.07 mu mol h(-1) driven by visible light. By taking advantage of the optimized adsorption nature of the active sites on the alloy cocatalyst, effective separation and transfer of photogenerated charges have been achieved; at the same time, the photo-generated electrons have a longer lifetime. More interestingly, it has been found that trace amounts of oxygen are helpful in catalytic hydrogen production from HCHO.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000536690000011

Deposits were made electrolytically by an atom-by-atom method in a controlled plating; we prepared an individual Pt deposit on Bi and Pb ultramicroelectrodes (UMEs) such as a single isolated atom, clusters containing one to five Pt atoms, and nanoparticles to about 10 nm radius. A steady-state voltammogram on the single Pt deposits is observed by electrocatalytic amplification of the HER, with a negligible contribution by the HER at the substrate UME. A single Pt atom can act as an electrode for the HER, showing a diffusion-limiting current plateau in the voltammogram that can be used to estimate the radius of a single deposit. We simulated the voltammograms of the individual deposits, assuming the Volmer step of the HER is appropriate for a Pt cluster deposit, to obtain kinetic parameters for each deposit. The HER kinetics increases as the particle radius increases from similar to 0.2 to similar to 4 nm for Bi and Pb substrates and then reaches a limiting plateau. The limiting kinetics on the Bi substrate approaches that of bulk Pt while that on the Pb substrate is much smaller.									85	5	0	0	3	0	86			0002-7863			WOS:000467781600016	31017772

The hydroxylase was a monomer with a M(r) of 35,000-38,000. Alpha-Ketoglutarate, ferrous iron, and molecular oxygen were required for the enzyme activity. The hydroxylase was optimally active between pH 7.0 and 7.4 in a 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid buffer and at 29-degrees-C. It was stimulated by a reducing agent, particularly dithiothreitol or reduced glutathione, and ATP. The requirement for ferrous ion was specific, and at least one sulfhydryl group was apparently essential for the enzymatic hydroxylation. The K(m) values of the hydroxylase for deacetoxycephalosporin C and alpha-ketoglutarate were 59 and 10-mu-M, respectively, and the K(a) for ferrous ion was 20-mu-M. In addition to its known hydroxylation of deacetoxycephalosporin C to deacetylcephalosporin C, the hydroxylase catalyzed effectively an analogous hydroxylation of 3-exomethylenecephalosporin C to deacetoxycephalosporin C. Surprisingly, the hydroxylase also mediated slightly a novel ring-expansion of penicillin N to deacetoxycephalosporin C. The substrate specificity of the hydroxylase is overlapping with but distinguishable from that of deacetoxycephalosporin C synthase, the enzyme which normally mediates the ring-expansion reaction (Dotzlaf, J. E., and Yeh, W. K. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 10219-10227). Furthermore, the hydroxylase exhibited an extensive sequence similarity to the synthase. Thus, the two enzymes catalyzing the consecutive reactions for cephamycin C biosynthesis in S. clavuligerus represent apparent products from a divergent evolution.									35	0	0	0	29	0	37			0021-9258			WOS:A1991FC21700062	2002049

Here, an anion-exchange strategy is reported to achieve the complete reconstruction of cobalt molybdate (CoMoO4 center dot nH(2)O) by engineering the ultrathin Co(OH)2 nanosheets in situ growing on CoMoO4 center dot nH(2)O. The leaching of molybdate during anion-exchange reaction favors the formation of the loose hierarchical nanostructure, which facilitates deep reconstruction of precatalyst under electro-oxidation conditions. In-situ and ex-situ techniques demonstrate that CoMoO4 center dot n-H2O@Co(OH)(2) undergoes four stages of reconstruction, and the reconstruction degree depend on the electrolyte and the bias voltage. After reconstruction, more CoOOH species are generated in the reconstructed CoMoO4 center dot n-H2O@Co(OH)(2) compared with the reconstructed CoMoO4 center dot nH(2)O, which is ascribed to the preferential conversion of amorphous Co(OH)(2) to beta-Co(OH)(2) and CoOOH under alkaline conditions. As a result, the reconstructed CoMoO4 center dot nH(2)O@Co(OH)(2) catalyst exhibits the significantly enhanced OER activity and excellent long-term durability. This study provides an effective strategy to construct the highly efficient OER electrocatalyst, and investigated the origin of catalytic activity through deep self-reconstruction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000817832700002

Characterization of various techniques indicated the CoxNiyP nanoparticles with about 5 nm in diameter were uniformly embedded in NC to form CoxNiyP@NC nanosheets with thickness of 20-400 nm. The NC was composed of graphene and the CoxNiyP@NC nanosheets stood up on NF in crisscross fashion. The electrochemical results showed that the CoxNiyP@NC/NF nanocomposites showed high catalytic activity for HER in alkaline solution and its catalytic activity depended on the ratio of Co:Ni. At the ratio of Co:Ni of 4:1, the Co4NiP@NC/NF presented best HER performances with the overpotential of 70 mV at 10 mA cm(-1), better than commercialized Pt. The Co4NiP@NC/NF also displayed a wonderful Faraday efficiency of 95%, suggesting that it could effectively convert electrical energy into chemical energy in HER. The catalytic activity of Co4NiP@NC/NF remained unchanged in 35 h, indicating the Co4NiP@ NC/NF possessed good stability. The excellent HER performances might make it be a substitute for precious metal catalysts for hydrogen production.									13	1	0	0	3	0	14			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000454617200008

Due to the local electric field polarization derived from its unique asymmetric coordination, Pt-SA/MXene displays remarkably higher catalytic HER activity in an alkaline electrolyte. In detail, the Pt-SA/MXene electrocatalyst only needs a low overpotential of 33 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and maintains the performance over 27 h. Besides, Pt-SA/MXene also has a competitive mass activity, 23.5 A mg(Pt)(-1), at an overpotential of 100 mV, which is 29.4 times greater than that of the commercial Pt/C counterpart. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the polarized electric field could efficiently tailor the electronic structure of Pt-SA/MXene and reduce the energy barrier of adsorption/desorption of the H* intermediate step, further improving its HER catalytic activity.									13	1	0	0	0	0	12			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000635679500001	33889881

As the detailed reaction mechanisms are not conclusively revealed, we want to take an alternative approach to investigate the importance of pH value changes during cycling. By adding a pH-indicator to the electrolyte (2 M ZnSO4 + 0.1 M MnSO4), the local pH-value change during operation is visualized in operando. The overall pH value was found to increase during cycling whereas a major temporary pH drop in close proximity of the manganese dioxide electrode surface occurs. Additionally, this pH value change was quantified locally by in operando measurements with a pH micro electrode. Different electrolyte compositions with additives (sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), sulfuric acid (H2SO4)) and operation voltages were tested. The pH-potential-diagrams of manganese and zinc reveal pH value and potential limits, leading to active material dissolution at lower pH values and oxygen gas evolution at higher potentials >1.7 V. The procedure of combining a pH indicator, pH microelectrode measurements and pH-potential diagrams can be seen as an appropriate method to determine the recommendable working window of aqueous batteries.

However, their platinum-like HER catalytic performance is heavily hindered, due to their strong interaction with hydrogen. Herein, Ni activation of TMCs (M = V, Fe, Cr, and Mo) is proposed through introducing adsorbed nickel atoms on the TMC surface (Ni/TMC). In both acidic and alkaline solutions, a sharp decrease of both overpotentials and Tafel slopes of the Ni/TMC catalysts for HER is achieved. At 10 mA cm(-2), the overpotentials of the Ni/vanadium carbide (VC) and Ni/Fe3C catalysts are 128 and 93 mV in 1mKOH, 111 and 112 mV in 0.5mH(2)SO(4), respectively. Even at 150 mA cm(-2), they exhibit the overpotentials of as low as 270 and 291 mV, respectively. In the alkaline solutions, the performance of these Ni/TMC catalysts is even superior to a Pt/C catalyst. As confirmed from density functional theory calculations and X-ray absorption fine structure analysis, such adsorbed Ni atoms effectively optimize the d-electron structure and improve HER performance. As a versatile strategy, this work provides a universal route to activate TMCs for highly efficient HER in different media.									100	5	0	0	2	0	100			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000554471100001

It is revealed that dehydration condensation reaction between -OH of GLC and -COOH of GO induces the anchoring of GLC on the surface of GO under high temperature and acidic environment, and subsequently, the dehydration of GLC produces 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) and epitaxially polymerizes and carbonizes into a two-dimensional carbon along GO sheets. In this step, GO provides both nucleation sites and template for the directional polymerization and carbonization of GLC. Due to the catalytic effect of GO, the activation energy of polymerization of GLC is reduced from 114.0 KJ mol(-1) to 89.25 KJ mol(-1) after the addition of GO, and the composite is transformed from two-dimensional nanosheets to three-dimensional crumpled structure by the capillary force of water evaporation. Due to the unique graphene-like structure, high conductivity offered by GO after heat treatment and more C-O groups derived from GLC, CG-50 shows good electrocatalytic performance. The overpotential is only 438 mV vs. RHE at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and the Tafel slope is 102 mV dec(-1). (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Catalytic Activity of Lanthanide-Doped Sr2PdO3 for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Fuel Cells								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				167	2					026501	10.1149/1945-7111/ab61e8				JAN 2 2020	2020	The electrocatalytic activity of Ln(0.3)Sr(1.7)PdO(3) (Ln = La, Nd, or Gd) perovskites prepared by the citrate combustion method for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was examined by electrochemical techniques. The X-ray diffraction data indicate the formation of Sr2PdO3 and SrPd3O4 as primary and secondary phases, respectively, with the LnPd alloy only appearing in the Gd3+-doped sample. Transmission electron microscopy images clearly show the orthorhombic geometry of Sr2PdO3 in all samples, and the particle size decreased and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area increased as the dopant ionic size decreased. Potentiodynamic cathodic polarization measurements show that lanthanide doping at the Sr2+ site increased the catalytic activity toward the HER compared to that of the undoped binary perovskite, Sr2PdO3, except for the La3+-doped sample. The order of catalytic activity is Gd0.3Sr1.7PdO3 > Nd0.3Sr1.7PdO3 Sr2PdO3 > La0.3Sr1.7PdO3, which is consistent with the impedance data and activation energy calculations. This order is probably related to the amount of the secondary phase, SrPd3O4, contained in each sample, which not only contributes to the activity but also prevents the catalyst from being deactivated. Of all the prepared ternary perovskites, Ln(0.3)Sr(1.7)PdO(3) shows considerable operational stability, making it a promising HER catalyst. (C) 2020 The Electrochemical Society ("ECS").

Here, a series of phosphorous-doped carbon nitride materials were synthesized by thermal annealing of urea and ammonium hexafluorophosphate, and platinum was atomically dispersed within the structural scaffold by thermal refluxing with Zeise's salt forming Pt-N/P/Cl coordination interactions, as manifested in X-ray photoelectron and absorption spectroscopic measurements. The resulting materials were found to exhibit markedly enhanced electrocatalytic activity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media, as compared to the P-free counterpart. This was accounted for by P doping that led to a significantly improved charge carrier density within C3N4, and the sample with the optimal P content showed an overpotential of only -22 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), lower than that of commercial Pt/C (-26 mV), and a mass activity (7.1 mA mu g-1 Pt at -70 mV vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) nearly triple that of the latter. Results from the present study highlight the significance of P doping in the manipulation of the electronic structures of metal/carbon nitride nanocomposites for high-performance HER electrocatalysis.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000700909400001

Herein, for the first time, we report the design and synthesis of a novel three-dimensional (3D) hierarchically meso-macroporous and hollow tube-like architecture of Ni3N nanosheets/carbon microfibers/Ni3N nanosheets (Ni3N/CMFs/Ni3N) assembled by the dispersion of porous Ni3N nanosheets (NSs) over the inner and outer walls of hollow and porous CMFs. Benefitting from excellent electrical conductivity and a high density of utilizable active sites, Ni3N/CMFs/Ni3N revealed superior OER and HER catalytic activities compared with Ni3N supported by graphene (Gr), carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and macroporous carbons (MPCs), respectively. In O-2-saturated 1.0 M KOH, the OER potential at 10 mA cm(-2) [E-10, 1.50 V vs. RHE] and the Tafel slope (41.54 mV dec(-1)) of Ni3N/CMFs/Ni3N were both lower than those of RuO2 [1.53 V vs. RHE and 43.45 mV dec(-1), respectively]. Also, the HER E-10 value of Ni3N/CMFs/Ni3N [-0.115 V (vs. RHE)] was only 40 mV larger than that of commercial Pt/C [-0.075 V (vs. RHE)] in N-2-saturated 1.0 M KOH. For full water splitting, to achieve a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) (E20) in O-2-saturated 1.0 M KOH, the (-) Ni3N/CMFs/Ni3N parallel to Ni3N/CMFs/Ni3N (+) electrolysis cell required a cell voltage of only 1.652 V, which is only 19 mV larger than that of the state-of-the-art (-) Pt parallel to RuO2 (+) benchmark (1.633 V). In addition, due to the remarkable structural and chemical stabilities of Ni3N/CMFs/Ni3N, especially the unique protection of similar to 2 to 3 layers of graphite carbon shells (GCSs) on the Ni3N nanoparticles (NPs) in Ni3N/CMFs/Ni3N, the Ni3N/CMFs/Ni3N-based water electrolysis cell also displayed excellent stability. The novel conceptual double surface catalysis model of Ni3N/CMFs/Ni3N, which was assembled by the dispersion of porous Ni3N nanosheets (NSs) over the inner and outer walls of hollow and porous CMFs, is an exciting new direction for the rational design and fabrication of porous nanomaterials for electrochemical energy and sensing applications.									93	6	0	0	7	0	94			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000401316100066

While many MOFs are unstable in water and aqueous solutions, aluminum MOFs (Al-MOFs) offer an unprecedented stability. First, we synthesize unusual highly hygroscopic Al-MOF MIL-160(Al), purify it and assign FTIR peaks to specific groups as potential water binding sites. Further, we introduce a novel method of in-situ time-dependent ATR-FTIR spectroscopy to detect specific binding sites in MIL-160(Al) and investigate the progress of reaction. Specifically, we combine in-situ time-dependent ATR-FTIR spectroscopy with using water as "spectroscopic probe" to determine binding sites in MIL-160(Al) and their evolution during the reaction. The in-situ time-dependent ATR-FTIR spectra provide evidence of water bonding to: the mu-OH group, the carboxylate anion COO- in 2,5-FDCA(2-) linker, oxygen atom in the furan ring of the linker, and the C-C and C-H bonds of the furan ring of the linker. Then, we conduct mechanistic and kinetic study of sorption of water vapor on MIL-160(Al) in air using the combination of two complementary in-situ timedependent methods: the ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and gravimetric analysis. Water vapor sorption on MIL-160(Al) results in the solid-state adsorption complex with up to four water molecules per unit of MIL-160(Al). Chemical kinetics of water sorption on MIL-160(Al) follows a pseudo-first order rate law and it is consistent with dynamics and timescale revealed by in-situ time-dependent ATR-FTIR. The combination of two in-situ time-dependent methods, the ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and gravimetry, forms a new powerful experimental approach to facilely study mechanisms, stoichiometry and chemical kinetics of various solid-gas reactions in the ambient and controlled environments.

Polyamidoamine dendrimers (generations 4-6) are modelled and the temporal evolution of the intracellular cascade of; increased levels of reactive oxygen species, intracellular antioxidant species, caspase activation, mitochondrial membrane potential decay, tumour necrosis factor and interleukin generation is simulated, based on experimental observations.The dose and generation dependence of several of these response factors are seen to well represent experimental observations at a range of time points. The model indicates that variations between responses of different cell-lines, including murine macrophages, human keratinocytes and colon cells, can be simulated and understood in terms of different intracellular antioxidant levels, and, within a given cell-line, varying responses of different cytotoxicity assays can be understood in terms of their sensitivities to different intracellular cascade events.The model serves as a tool to interpolate and visualise the range of dose and temporal dependences and elucidate the mechanisms underlying the in vitro cytotoxic response to nanoparticle exposure and describes the interaction in terms of independent nanoparticle properties and cellular parameters, based on reaction rates. Such an approach could be a valid alternative to that of effective concentrations for classification of nanotoxicity and may lay the foundation for future quantitative structure activity relationships and predictive nanotoxicity models.

This work demonstrates that, when loading mixed-valence cobalt (II,III) oxide (Co3O4) dispersed in a Nafion membrane (Nf) on a nanoporous bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) photoanode (i. e., BiVO4/Nf[Co3O4]), stable and efficient water oxidation occurred. In particular, it is noteworthy that the BiVO4/Nf[Co3O4] photoanode exhibited stable performance even in an acidic medium (pH=2). In the present system consisting of a BiVO4/Nf[Co3O4] photoanode along with an organo-photocathode, the stoichiometric formation of O-2 and H-2 successfully occurred by applying just 0.1 V between the photoelectrodes (cf. maximum efficiency, ca. 0.2 %), which was superior to the prototype comprising BiVO4 and Pt counter electrode. The Co3O4 loading can effectively suppress the collapse of the nanostructured BiVO4 upon photocorrosion, resulting in the stable and kinetically efficient consumption of holes in BiVO4.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2196-0216			WOS:000605216400026

In this work, the formation of PMSO2 was also observed when PMSO was treated by the Fe(II)/peroxymonosulfate (PMS) system over the pH range of 3-7, and the yield of PMSO2 (i.e., the molar ratio of PMSO2 formed to PMSO lost) was quantified to be approximately 100% under acidic conditions, similar to the Fe(II)/PDS system. Moreover, O-18 from isotope-labeled water ((H2O)-O-18) was successfully incorporated into PMSO2 product when PMSO was oxidized by the Fe(II)/PDS and Fe(II)/PMS systems in (H2O)-O-18, likely due to the competitive oxygen exchange of Fe(IV)-oxo species with (H2O)-O-18. Further, Fe(IV) evolution profiles in both systems were predicted by a Fe(IV)-mediated kinetic model, and these results are in good agreement with the experimental data obtained with a stopped-flow spectrophotometer.									95	4	0	0	69	0	97			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000467042200087

The physical and chemical structure of a metal phosphide varies with the method of preparation as the electronic, catalytic, and magnetic properties of the metal phosphides strongly depend on their synthesis routes. Commonly practiced processes such as solid-state synthesis and ball milling have proven to be reliable routes to prepare TMPs but they generally require high temperature and long reaction time. Here, a recently developed plasma-assisted conversion route for the preparation of TMPs is reviewed, along with their applications in energy conversion and storage, including water oxidation electrocatalysis, sodium-ion batteries, and super-capacitors. The plasma-assisted synthetic route should open up a new avenue to prepare TMPs with tailored structure and morphology for various applications. In fact, the process may be further extended to the synthesis of a wide range of transition-metal compounds such as borides and fluorides at low temperature and in a rapid manner.									26	2	0	0	0	0	28			2366-9608			WOS:000410932500002

This photoanode exhibited much lower electron-hole recombination, fast charge transport, higher visible light harvesting, and excellent performance with respect to FTO vertical bar c-TiO2 vertical bar TiO2 assembly (TiO2 photoanode) in the photoelectrocatalytic oxygen evolution process. The photocurrent density of Ni(OH)(2) photoanode is 7 times (0.35 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE) greater than that of TiO2 photoanode (0.045 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE). The compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) layer in Ni(OH)(2) photoanode plays a role of an effective hole-blocking layer. Few-layer graphene layer could speed up the transport of the photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of the TiO2/GQDs to FTO. Ni(OH)(2) layer could transfer rapidly holes into electrolyte solution. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We investigate the evolution of the bonding configuration in ta-C thin films subjected to high temperature annealing in flowing Argon gas using a rapid thermal annealing furnace over the range of 200-1000 degrees C. We observe no substantial change in bonding structure below 600 degrees C. Changes in the NEXAFS and Raman spectra start to appear above 600 degrees C, and by 1000 degrees C a significant increase in the sp(2) bonding in the film is observed. No oxygen bonding is detected in the NEXAFS spectra, but we do observe an isosbestic point, demonstrating that the thermally driven sp(3)-> sp(2) conversion reaction occurs without passing through an intermediate transition state. This allows us to use NEXAFS spectra of thermally annealed ta-C films to quantitatively determine that the activation energy for directly converting the sp(3)-bonded carbon to the sp(2)-bonded configuration is 3.5 +/- 0.9 eV.									76	1	0	0	4	0	76			0021-8979			WOS:000274517300040

As a promising hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst, MoSe2 is rarely investigated especially combined with TiO2 photoanode. In this study, we report a composite photoanode of MoSe2 nanosheets (with 1T and 2H phase)-modified 3D TiO2 nanoflowers (NFs). The hybrid of 3D TiO2 NFs/2D MoSe2 holds great promise in boosting the PEC water splitting performance. TiO2 NFs/MoSe2-15 showed the largest photocurrent density of 1.40 mA/cm(2), which was five times higher than that of pure TiO2 NFs under AM1.5G illumination. Moreover 10 times improvement in current density was observed for the TiO2 NFs/MoSe2-15 under visible light. This increase could be ascribed to synergistic effects of light absorption enhancement and more efficient carrier separation after MoSe2 modification. This study not only provides a reference to boost the photoelectrochemical performance of photoelectrodes but also renders a perspective on the potential applications of MoSe2 nanosheets.									14	1	0	0	1	0	14			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000519787400053

Here we report catalysts comprising Pt on Ni single crystalline spines (Pt/Ni-SP) with high activity and stability for HER in alkaline solution with proposed mechanism. The Pt/Ni-SP catalysts are prepared by dispersing platinum nanoparticles (1.7-3.1 nm) on the single-crystalline spines (Ni-SP) of Ni urchin-like particles. The size and coverage of Pt nanoparticles on Ni-SP are increased with increases in the Pt loading amount. X-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy are performed to observe the structure of the Pt/Ni-SP catalyst. The catalysts achieve the mass activity of 1.11 A mg((Pt))(-1), comparing favorably to Pt/C catalysts with the mass activity of 0.33 A mg((Pt))(-1) at 0.05 V overpotential. The Tafel slope of the Pt/Ni-SP catalyst is approximately 30 mV dec(-1,) similar to that of Pt, while Pt/Ni-SP is very stable in alkaline solution, like Ni. The synergistic effect of Pt/Ni-SP is ascribed to H spillover from Pt to Ni.									43	2	0	0	0	0	44			2045-2322			WOS:000424985800024	29445208

However, the eNRR process remains a coveted goal due to the poor product selectivity, low activity, and stability of traditional catalysts. Inspired by recent experimental advances in dual-atom catalysts, herein, by means of comprehensive spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) computations, the catalytic performance of various binary transition metals dispersed in nitrogen-doped porous graphene (NPG) for the eNRR was systematically evaluated. Our results revealed that the N atoms around vacancies in the substrate can strongly stabilize the metal dimers by forming metal-N bonds. Among FeFe, FeCo, FeNi, FeCu, FeRh, FeRu, FePd, MoFe, MoCo, MoCu, MoRu, and MoMo, the binary FeRh embedded in NPG was identified as the best catalyst due to its lowest limiting potential (-0.22 V) and high selectivity towards the eNRR. Our results further suggested that the good eNRR catalytic activity of the dispersed FeRh mainly originates from its optimal eNRR intermediates' adsorption/desorption features, obvious suppressing effects on the hydrogen evolution reaction, and great promise for synthesis. Our work not only opens a new door to advance sustainable NH3 production by tailoring the electronic structures of binuclear metal atoms, but also provides deeper insight into the structure-performance relationships of dual sites for eNRR electrocatalysts.									81	7	0	0	0	0	81			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000519704200034

The main challenges restricted the wider application for MoS2-based nanomaterials are the complex preparation process and the high overpotential. Here, we design a novel and facile sealed vessel to synthesize vertical oriented MoS2 nanosheets electrocatalyst with vast exposed edges. Benefiting from the unique vertically-oriented structural and compositional characteristics, the MoS2 nanosheets with 10-20 layers exhibits superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with a small overpotential of 135.2 mV at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) and low Tafel slope of 82.5 mV.dec(-1) as well as extraordinary catalytic stability over 5000 cycles. Importantly, the sealed vessel reactor system may open up a versatile and potential synthetic way to construct various morphologies and structure of metal dichalcogenides for high-performance energy storage and conversions devices.					5th International Conference on Advances in Energy, Environment and Chemical Science (AEECS)5th International Conference on Advances in Energy, Environment and Chemical Science (AEECS)	FEB 26-28, 2021FEB 26-28, 2021		ELECTR NETWORKELECTR NETWORK	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2267-1242		*****************	WOS:000664285400127

The influence of water and oxygen feed contents was examined. Different Transient Response Techniques were applied to investigate the SCR dynamics in view of applications to vehicles. The experimental results were analysed by means of a dynamic one-dimensional heterogeneous PFR model, and fitted by multiresponse nonlinear regression to provide estimates of the rate parameters. Such parameters, as well as the relevant geometrical and morphological characteristics, were then used to simulate transient SCR runs performed over an extruded honeycomb sample of the same commercial catalyst. The satisfactory match obtained between model predictions and monolith data validates the proposed rate equations. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

However, adopting the suitable strategy to further improve the intrinsic activity and exposure of transition metal selenides is still a challenge. Herein, the optimized MoCoSex encapsulated in N-doped hollow carbon nanosphere (MoCoSex@NC) has been synthesized for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) through a simple two-step method. Firstly, the uniform porous NC has been obtained through carbonization at 900 degrees C, which provides the growth space and fast electron transfer of active sites. Secondly, the optimized MoCoSex@NC with excellent dispersion has been synthesized through the following hydrothermal process. Moreover, the synergistic effect of Mo doping can improve the intrinsic activity of CoSex for HER. The obtained MoCoSex@NC exhibited excellent low over potential of 60 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and great stability for HER. The enhanced activity may attribute to the good dispersion of MoCoSex and NC substrate. After optimized synthesis process, we found that the first carbonization of NC is the base for constructing the good dispersion of MoCoSex. This work provides a new design strategy for transition metal selenides supported on carbon substrate as electrocatalysts for HER.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000566337200003

Electrodes were prepared by the spontaneous deposition of either Pd or Rh and by co-deposition of both Rh and Pd on polycrystalline gold electrode. Characterization of modified electrodes was performed by cyclic voltammetry in alkaline solution, while additional information about phase analysis, chemical composition and surface morphology of tai-metallic Rh@Pd/Au(poly) electrode were acquired using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Investigations of HER catalysis have shown that the activity of tri-metallic Rh Pd/Au(poly) electrode exceeds the activities of both Pd/Au(poly) and Rh/Au(poly) electrodes, meaning that the synergism between co-deposited Pd and Rh islands is achieved. Moreover, Rh@Pd/Au(poly) electrode showed significant approach to the activities of bulk Pd and Rh electrodes for HER, especially when taking into account low activity of bare Au substrate. Synergistic effect of co-deposited Pd and Rh islands is a consequence of the strong electronic interaction between three metals in a close contact, which promotes the activity for HER by lowering the adsorption energy of Hads intermediate.

Understanding the mitochondrial metabolic response to hypoxia is key to understanding ischemia tolerance in the myocardium. We used a novel combination of 2 genome-scale methods to study key processes underlying human myocardial hypoxia tolerance. In particular, we hypothesized that computational modeling and evolution would identify similar genes as critical to human myocardial hypoxia tolerance.Methods and Results-We analyzed a reconstruction of the cardiac mitochondrial metabolic network using constraint-based methods, under conditions of simulated hypoxia. We used flux balance analysis, random sampling, and principal component analysis to explore feasible steady-state solutions. Hypoxia blunted maximal ATP (-17%) and heme (-75%) synthesis and shrank the feasible solution space. Tricarboxylic acid and urea cycle fluxes were also reduced in hypoxia, but phospholipid synthesis was increased. Using mathematical optimization methods, we identified reactions that would be critical to hypoxia tolerance in the human heart. We used data regarding single-nucleotide polymorphism frequency and distribution in the genomes of Tibetans (whose ancestors have resided in persistent high-altitude hypoxia for several millennia). Six reactions were identified by both methods as being critical to mitochondrial ATP production in hypoxia: phosphofructokinase, phosphoglucokinase, complex II, complex IV, aconitase, and fumarase.Conclusions-Mathematical optimization and evolution converged on similar genes as critical to human myocardial hypoxia tolerance. Our approach is unique and completely novel and demonstrates that genome-scale modeling and genomics can be used in tandem to provide new insights into cardiovascular genetics.									6	0	0	0	3	0	6			1942-325X	1942-3268		WOS:000341197700003	24873932

In this work, the microstructure evolution and corresponding performance of a Cu/Ta2O5-x/Pt system are investigated at the atomic scale. By inducing intrinsic oxygen vacancies into tantalum oxide and applying copper as the active electrode, the RRAM device can exhibit the electrical properties of a dual-mechanism filament. The device demonstrates a long retention time (10(4) s) and a large memory window of 10(6). By using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the conductive filament is found to consist of crystalline copper and oxygen vacancies. Moreover, with the growth kinetics of filaments from in situ transmission electron microscopy and curve fitting relevant to the conduction mechanism, the formation of filaments is promoted by field-coalesced oxygen vacancies induced by the growth of copper filaments. Therefore, this work provides a unique perspective and a novel material engineering approach for tailoring RRAM devices and developing further applications in electronic technology.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			2199-160X			WOS:000688191900001

The [Mo3S13](2-) polymer-based structure confers a high density of exposed sulfur moieties, widely regarded as the HER active sites. However, their intrinsic complexity conceals full understanding of their exact role in HER catalysis, hampering their full potential for water splitting applications. In this report, a unifying approach is adopted accounting for modifications in the inherent electrochemistry (EC), HER mechanism, and surface species to maximize the AE-MoSx electroactivity over a broad pH region (0-10). Dramatic enhancements in HER performance by selective electrochemical cycling within reductive (overpotential shift, eta(HER) approximate to -350 mV) and electro-oxidative windows (eta(HER) approximate to -290 mV) are accompanied by highly stable performance in mildly acidic electrolytes. Joint analysis of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman, and EC experiments corroborate the key role of bridging and terminal S ligands as active site generators at low pH, and reveal molybdenum oxysulfides (Mo5+OxSy) to be the most active HER moiety in AE-MoSx in mildly acidic-to-neutral environments. These findings will be extremely beneficial for future tailoring of MoSx materials and their implementation in commercial electrolyzer technologies.									61	2	0	0	1	0	60			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000459313500011

Various homogeneous, heterogeneous and nanocatalytic systems have been designed using such ligands. Although reports on selenium ligated homogeneous catalysts are quite high in number, significant work has also been done on the development of heterogeneous and nanocatalytic systems using organoselenium ligands. A review article, focusing on the utility of organoselenium compounds in the development of catalytic systems, was published in 2012 (A. Kumar, G. K. Rao, F. Saleem and A. K. Singh, Dalton Trans., 2012, 41, 11949). Moreover, it mainly covered the homogeneous catalysts. There are no review articles in the literature on heterogeneous and nanocatalytic systems designed using organoselenium compounds and their applications. Hence, this perspective aims to cover the developments pertaining to the synthetic aspects of such catalytic systems (using organoselenium compounds) and their applications in catalysis of a variety of chemical transformations.

Developing earth-abundant H-2-production materials with robust activity and stability has become the mainstream in this field. Due to the unique properties and characteristics, transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have been proven to be high performance co-catalysts to replace some of the classic precious metal materials in photocatalytic water splitting. In this Minireview, we summarize the recent significant progress of TMPs as co-catalysts for water splitting reaction with high activity and stability. Firstly, the characteristic of TMPs is briefly introduced. Then, we mainly discuss the recent research efforts toward their application as photocatalytic co-catalysts in photocatalytic H-2-production, O-2-evolution and photoelectrochemical water splitting. Finally, the catalytic mechanism, current existing challenges and future working directions for improving the performance of TMPs are proposed.									115	6	0	0	6	0	116			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000416158500005	29121451

However, little efforts have been made to improve the intrinsic activity on per-catalytic site of MoSe2 for HER. In this work, the electrocatalytic HER activities of MoSe2 are extremely enhanced by simple incorporation of boron which can reasonably engineer the electron transfer from Mo atoms to the active sites including B and Se atoms. Compared with the pristine 1T MoSe2, the as-opimized B-1T MoSe2 nanosheets show a reduced overpotential of 180 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a lowered Tafel slope of 50.6 mV dec(-1), and increased turnover frequency under a constant overpotential. While the electrochemical surface area of the catalyst after B-incorporation is decreased, the improved inherent activity on per-catalytic site and facilitated HER kinetics are demonstrated. The results pave the way to reasonably engineer the electron transfer to the active sites in the catalysts by B-doping to boost the intrinsic activity on per-catalytic site for electrocatalytic HER.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2196-7350			WOS:000506582100028

Compared with traditional hydrogen production from fossil fuel (e.g. natural gas, coal) by steam reforming, the electrocatalytic production of hydrogen by water splitting is a renewable and eco-friendly technique. Currently, the widely used catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a noble metal (e.g. Pt), which has very limited availability and a high cost. Therefore, it is crucial to develop low-cost and highly effective alternative HER electrocatalysts. In this review, we summarize the use of carbon materials for noble metal-free HER catalysts, in which they play roles including as an active catalyst and a matrix component. By heteroatom doping, the intrinsic activities of carbon materials are optimized and improved, and carbon-based metal-free catalysts are produced. As a matrix, the main roles of the carbon materials are as conductive substrates, highly-dispersed support materials and corrosion resistant layers. The catalytic activity of carbon-based catalysts is improved by a synergistic effect between a co-catalyst and the carbon skeleton. The HER performance of some reported carbon-based catalysts are even close to that of Pt. We summarize the strategies for tailoring the HER performance of carbon-based electrocatalysts and the prospects for future research on developing highly efficient and low-cost catalysts are discussed.									4	5	0	0	0	0	6			1007-8827	1872-5805		WOS:000466570400001

Here, we have used nickel cyclotetraphosphate (Ni2P4O12) nanosheet arrays as a HER electrocatalyst for the first time. The Ni2P4O12 arrays were obtained through a facile low-temperature phosphorylation process and possess superior HER catalytic activities and stability in acid. The Ni2P4O12 delivers a small overpotential of 131.8 mV at -10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 47.8 mV dec(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4, comparable to most of the non-precious metal-based catalysts. Importantly, the Ni2P4O12 shows a negligible potential change (6.5 mV) over 80000 s continuous testing in acid. The remarkable catalytic performances of Ni2P4O12 are mainly attributed to the inductive effect of P4O124- and its polymer-like structure, promoting it as a potential acid-stable HER electrocatalyst.									19	2	0	0	0	0	19			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000434313200007	29790551

The time evolution of O 1s photoelectron intensity showed a linear uptake curve up to similar to90 L followed by a sudden saturation up to similar to160 L and then a restart of the linear increase, indicating that O-2 adsorption obeys a zero-order reaction scheme before and after the saturation. Corresponding to the first linear uptake and saturation, the surface core level shift component of Ti 2p decreased predominantly and disappeared completely, and appeared again after the saturation and remained persistently during TiO2 growth. Thus the zero-order reaction of O-2 adsorption on the Ti (0 0 0 1) surface at 405 degreesC is concerned with the metallic Ti layer on the outermost surface. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

On clean Ru(0001), desorption of N2H4 was observed at temperatures of 185 (multilayer state) and 280 K (monolayer state, desorption energy approximately 17 kcal/mol). Adsorbed hydrazine decomposed extensively into NH3, N2, N, and H. TDS spectra from N/Ru(0001) surfaces showed N2 evolution in a sharp peak at approximately 510 K and in a broad feature between 600 and 800 K. Boron-nitrogen adlayers with stoichiometry close to 1:1 were formed: (a) by simultaneous dosing of B2H6 and N2H4 at 450 K, and (b) after coadsorption of B2H6 and N2H4 at 90 K and subsequent heating to 450 K. These adlayers decomposed at temperatures above 1100 K.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0022-3654			WOS:A1992GZ69700063

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiles using different X-ray energies and scanning transmission electron microscopy showed that the as-synthesized RhxPd1-x and PdxPt1-x nanoparticles have a core-shell structure whereas the RhxPt1-x alloys are more homogeneous in structure. The evolution of their structures and chemistry under oxidizing and reducing conditions was studied with ambient-pressure XPS (AP-XPS) in the Torr pressure range. The RhxPd1-x and RhxPt1-x nanoparticles undergo reversible changes of surface composition and chemical state when the reactant gases change from oxidizing (NO or O-2 at 300 degrees C) to reducing (H-2 or CO at 300 degrees C) or catalytic (mixture of NO and CO at 300 degrees C). In contrast, no significant change in the distribution of the Pd and Pt atoms in the PdxPt1-x nanoparticles was observed. The difference in restructuring behavior under these reaction conditions in the three series of bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts is correlated with the surface free energy of the metals and the heat of formation of the metallic oxides. The observation of structural evolution of bimetallic nanoparticles under different reaction conditions suggests the importance of in situ studies of surface structures of nanoparticle catalysts.									217	3	1	0	11	1	219			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000279196500035	20521788

Graphene-based materials as metal-free catalysts have attracted significant attention but suffer from insufficient activity and stability. Therefore, a novel and economical approach is developed to prepare highly active, robust, and self-supported reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/SiO2 ceramic composites as electrocatalysts in HER. Through intercalation and pressure sintering, the rGO sheets are parallelly aligned and embedded into a dense and chemically inert SiO2 matrix, ensuring the electrical conductivity and stability of the prepared composites. After directional cutting, the edges of the oriented rGO sheets become fully exposed on the composite surface, acting as highly electrocatalytic active sites in HER, as confirmed by density functional theory calculations. The 4 vol% rGO/SiO2 composite displays superior electrocatalytic performance, featuring a low overpotential (134 mV) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope (103 mV dec(-1)), and excellent catalytic durability in 0.5 m H2SO4. This study provides a new yet cost-effective strategy to prepare metal-free, robust, and edge-rich rGO/ceramic composites as a highly electrocatalytic active catalyst for HER applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2366-9608			WOS:000685452500001	34927927

Herein, we design and develop the first type of single-atom Ru based catalyst applied for the HER under pH-universal conditions. This binder-free catalyst consists of single Ru atoms anchored to the surface of MoS2 nanosheets array supported by a carbon cloth (Ru-MoS2/CC, Ru in Ru-MoS2: 0.37 wt%). The abundant dispersed single Ru atoms are highly catalytically active, and the MoS2 array supported 3D porous structure offers more opportunities for active sites and serves as co-catalysts for synergetic catalysis, with accompanying enhanced the electrical conductivity of this array-catalyst. Remarkably, the Ru-MoS2/CC exhibits extremely enhanced catalytic activity compared to that of MoS2/CC and possesses good long-term stability. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the improved catalytic activities stem from the synergistic effect between MoS2 and single-atom Ru. This discovery holds a great potential to accelerate the large-scale binder-free application of single Ru atoms in industry.									105	5	0	0	5	0	106			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000464487500010

However, high cost and poor stability of the Pt catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) hinder its wide applications. Here, we report a facile approach to synthesize an ultra-low PtCo bimetallic catalyst embedded in porous carbon via direct annealing of Pt-doped ZIF-67. The resulting catalyst (CPt@ZIF-67) with only 5 wt% Pt loading exhibits better performance than commercial 20 wt% Pt/C, achieving a Tafel slope of 27.1 mV dec(-1) with an overpotential of only 50 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Theoretical simulations show that carbon cages generated over the bimetal clusters during annealing dramatically reduce the free energy for HER. The free energy does not reduce proportionally with increasing Pt loading, implying the need to ensure appropriate Pt placement on surfaces, rather than simply raising Pt level, in order to enhance effectiveness of a Pt-based catalyst. The study provides a viable approach for developing cost-effective Pt-related catalysts for HER.									38	1	0	0	0	0	38			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463970400067

Herein, we explore the effect of boron (B) doping on the surface properties of activated carbon (AC) materials based on their water adsorption behavior and oxygen reduction reaction. In the high-temperature B doping process, B-doped AC materials at 1400 degrees C exhibit an open pore structure with B-O bonds, whereas at a temperature of 1600 degrees C, a nonporous structure containing a large amount of B-C bonds prevails. The B-O species act as active sites for water adsorption on the carbon surface. On the basis of the isothermal adsorption heat, we suggest that B atoms are present at the pore openings and on the surfaces. The B-O moieties at the open edges improve the electrocatalytic activity, whereas the B-C bonds at the closed edges decrease the electrocatalytic activity because of the stable structure of these bonds. Our findings provide new evidence for the electrocatalytic properties associated with the structure of B-doped edges.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0743-7463			WOS:000721132300001	34724383

Herein, a novel electrocatalyst, Pt nanoparticles (NPs) anchored on Ni/nitrogen-doped graphene nanotubes (Pt/Ni@NGNTs), was designed and its exceptional catalytic performance towards hydrogen evolution reaction was demonstrated. Ni@NGNTs itself showed poor catalytic activity. Unexpectedly, when employed as a support, it increased the mass activity of the Pt metal by 30.1 times in an acidic electrolyte and 15.3 times in an alkaline electrolyte relative to that of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C. Moreover, the durability of Pt/Ni@NGNTs reached up to 50 h. Impressively, Pt NPs preferentially distributed around the protective graphene shells of the enclosed metal Ni, due to the enriched electron density and structural defects induced by Ni and N dopants. The electronic interactions between Pt and Ni@NGNTs tuned the electronic properties and greatly boosted catalytic performances of the anchored Pt NPs. The present catalyst shows significant potential for the synthesis of low cost, high performance Pt-based catalysts.									22	3	0	0	0	0	23			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000465911200021

According to our computations, Li4NiTeO6 exhibits satisfactory structural stability with a volume change of 7.2% and electrical conductivity similar to Li2MnO3. We also examined the electronic configuration of this cathode material during its electrochemical progress and found a weak hybridization of Ni-3d and O-2p. Moreover, by analyzing the Bader charges of different elements, we confirmed that O and Ni are exclusively responsible for electron loss and gain. In addition, O evolution reactions occur when half of Li+ ions are extracted. Finally, we investigated Li+ migration paths and concluded that migration barriers depend on the charge distribution around migration paths.									9	1	0	0	0	0	10			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000339628400048	24967833

In order to improve the electrochemical performance of Co-base catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), nanoporous cobalt nickel hydroxide (CoNi) composites were fabricated on the 3D nickel foam (NF) by a cyclic voltammetry method. With a doping of nickel hydroxide, the electrocatalytic activity of the catalysts was significantly enhanced. As-prepared optimal CoNi/NF electrode is able to deliver a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) with an overpotential (.) of only 77 mV, which is much lower than of Co/NF electrode (185.5 mV) and Ni/NF electrode (189 mV), and shows exceeding stability and durability. The CoNi/NF catalyst also displays extraordinary performance at high current densities (e.g., 200 mA/cm(2) at. = 204 mV), and is comparable to the best Co-based HER electrocatalysts reported to date. The high active surface areas (about 14 times higher than the bare NF), high surface wettability and low charge-transfer resistance of CoNi/NF catalyst, together with effective mass transport offered by the 3D nanoporous structure, all contribute to the extraordinary synergistic HER performance.

By adjusting the reaction temperature and the amount of Pt precursor, monodispersed octahedron, highly branched nanosphere, concaved Pt nanocube and nanorod were prepared. Transmission electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were used to investigate the formation mechanism. The overgrowth rate is believed to play an important role in the evolution of nanoparticles' shape. A reaction temperature higher than 185 degrees C and Cu/Pt molar ratio (<0.1) can accelerate the overgrowth rate. The fast growth rate along < 111 > direction leads to the formation of multi-branched and concaved nanocubes. The reaction condition (Cu/Pt 0.1; 185 degrees C) prefers the formation of monodispersed octahedron Pt nanoparticles. The absence of CuO facilitates the formation of a branched nanosphere. The electro-catalytic oxidisation of methanol shows that the catalytic ability has significant shape-dependence. Compared with other shaped nanoparticles, concaved cube nanoparticles have excellent catalytic performance because they are coated by high index facets.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1750-0443			WOS:000316947000006

Herein, we propose a general top-down route to convert metal nanoparticles into uniformly dispersed metal single atoms in mild electrochemical environment via a facile cathodic corrosion process. Within the synthetic process, Pt nanoparticles precursors are transformed into migrating Pt single atoms (Pt-1) driven by a high negative potential; and subsequently these mobile Pt atoms are trapped and stabilized by N coordination sites of N-doped carbon paper (NCP). The as-prepared Pt-1/NCP electrodes exhibit a superior catalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a low overpotential of 0.022 V at 10 mA/cm(2) and a low Tafel slope of 28.5 mV/dec as well as a long-term durability. Notably, the proposed electrochemical atomic migration strategy shows a promising generality for fabricating other metal single atoms (e.g., Pd, Ir, Cu), which may open a new avenue for metallic SACs preparation.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000684526800009

Insight into how, when, and where DDT occurs is obtained by analyzing analytically and by means of multidimensional numerical simulations dynamics of a flame accelerating in a tube with no-slip walls. It is shown that the deflagration-to-detonation transition exhibits three separate stages of evolution corroborating majority experimental observations. During the first stage flame accelerates and generates shocks far ahead of the flame front. During the second stage the flame slows down, shocks are formed in the immediate proximity of the flame front and the preheated zone ahead of the flame front is created. The third stage is self-restructuring of the steep temperature profile within the flame, formation of a reactivity gradient and the actual formation of the detonation wave itself. The mechanism for the detonation wave formation, given an appropriate formation of the preheated zone, seems to be universal and involves a reactivity gradient formed from the initially steep flame temperature profile in the presence of the preheated zone. The developed theory and numerical simulations are found to be well consistent with extensive experiments of the DDT in hydrogen-oxygen and ethylene-oxygen mixtures in tubes with smooth and rough walls.

Transition metal nitrides (TMNs) are very attractive potential candidates since of high electrical conductivity, robust stability, element rich and high activity. Antiperovskite metal nitrides provide chemical flexibility since two different types of transition metal elements are contained, allowing partial substitution both for A - and M -sites. Herein, we report a novel antiperovskite metal nitride Ag x Ni 1- x NNi 3 (0 < x < 0.80) thin film used as highly effective HER electrocatalysts. Pure phase antiperovskite nitride can be successfully obtained for Ag x Ni 1- x NNi 3 with x less than 0.80. The Ag 0.76 Ni 0.24 NNi 3 towards HER shows an overpotential of 122 mV at 10 mA cm -2 in alkaline media. Furthermore, considering the role of Ag for adsorbing hydroxyl groups, chemical engineering has been carried out for designing metal/antiperovskite nitride Ag/Ag x Ni 1- x NNi 3 composite electrocatalysts. The 0.18 Ag/Ag 0.80 Ni 0.20 NNi 3 electrocatalyst shows a mere 13 and 81 mV of overpotential to reach 1 and 10 mA cm -2 , respectively, showing high durability in alkaline media. These results will provide a novel type of HER catalysts based on antiperovskite metal nitrides and a strategic design for metal/antiperovskite metal nitride composite electrocatalysts for HER in alkaline media.

As a first step to studying this mixing in more detail, we have combined a large nuclear reaction network with four detailed stellar evolutionary sequences of different metallicities in order to follow the production and destruction of the C, N, O, Ne, Na, Mg, and Al isotopes around the hydrogen-burning shell (H shell) of globular cluster RGB stars. The abundance distributions determined:by this method allow for the variation in the temperature and density around the H shell as well as for the dependence on both the stellar luminosity and cluster metallicity. Because our nuclear reaction network operates separately from the stellar evolution code, we are able to more readily explore the effects of the uncertainties in the reaction rates on the calculated abundances.We discuss implications of our results for mixing in the context of the observational data. Our results are qualitatively consistent with the observed C versus N, O versus N, Na versus O, and Al versus O anticorrelations and their variations with both luminosity and metallicity. We see evidence for variations in Na without requiring changes in O, independent of metallicity, as observed by Norris and Da Costa in 1995 and Briley and coworkers in 1997. Also, we derive C-12/C-13 ratios near the observed equilibrium value of 4 for all sequences and predict the temperature-dependent O-16/O-17 equilibrium ratio based on new data for the O-17(p, alpha)N-14 reaction rate. Additionally, we discuss the Mg isotopic abundances in light of the recent observations by Shetrone of M13 and NGC 6752.									79	1	0	0	0	0	79			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000071704200013

For decades, the stability of this critical reaction intermediate has been used to predict catalytic activity, by a Sabatier analysis of the first bond (O-O) the intermediates catalyse within the O-2 evolution cycle. Recently, several groups directly detected these intermediates by their specific vibrations during the reaction on different material surfaces (Co3O4, Fe2O3, SrTiO3). By observing surface bound one-electron intermediates, these experiments validate a Sabatier analysis. However, the experiments strongly suggest that solvation by the electrolyte is important to their stability, which has not been a focus of calculations of their charge trapping capacity. For the time-resolved (femtosecond) experiments of the SrTiO3 surface, solvation by water rate limits the intermediates' formation time constant. Further, the kinetic stability or lifetime of the intermediates across diverse material surfaces points to the importance of reorganization within the electrolyte. In this highlight, we review these recent results, put them in the context of theoretical investigations, and discuss the implications of solvation-enabled intermediate stability for probing and understanding catalytic mechanism at surfaces.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000403228200003

However, it is an inefficient anode material in the absence of photoactivation due to its low electron conductivity. To overcome this limitation, a series of conductive TiO2 nanotube array electrodes have been developed. Even though nanotube arrays are effective for electrochemical oxidation initially, deactivation is often observed within a few hours. To overcome the problem of deactivation, we have synthesized cobalt doped Black-TiO2 nanotube array (Co-Black NTA) electrodes that are stable for more than 200 h of continuous operation in a NaClO4 electrolyte at 10 mA cm(-2). Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and DFT simulations, we are able to show that bulk oxygen vacancies (O-v) are the primary source of the enhanced conductivity of Co-Black. Cobalt doping both creates and stabilizes surficial oxygen vacancies, O-v and thus prevents surface passivation. The Co-Black electrodes outperform dimensionally stable IrO2 anodes (DSA) in the electrolytic oxidation of organic-rich wastewater. Increasing the loading of Co leads to the formation of a CoOx film on top of Co-Black electrode. The CoOx/Co-Black composite electrode was found to have a lower OER overpotential (352 mV) in comparison to a DSA IrO2 (434 mV) electrode and a stability that is greater than 200 h in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2).									99	6	0	0	30	0	102			2155-5435			WOS:000431727300059	29755829

Shi, X.-X. Li, F.-H. Wu and W.-B. Yu, Dalton Trans., 2017, 46, 16321.). In the previously published report, this cobalt compound (compound 1) was believed to display a high turnover frequency (5 s(-1)) at eta = 720 mV at pH 9. Herein, the OER in the presence of compound 1 is reinvestigated. The nanosized oxide-based particles formed after the OER in the presence of compound 1 were tracked by electrochemical methods, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDX), X-ray diffraction studies (XRD), (High-resolution) transmission electron microscopy ((HR)TEM), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Based on these experiments, it is proposed that a candidate for the true catalyst of the OER in the presence of compound 1 is cobalt oxide. During the OER and using chronoamperometry, the oxidation state of Co ions for the formed Co oxide is (III), but after consecutive CVs the oxidation states of Co ions for the formed Co oxide are (II) and (III). The results shed new light on the role of Co oxide nanoparticles formed in the presence of this Co coordination compound during the OER. Our experimental data also show that for the OER in the presence of a homogeneous (pre)catalyst, careful analyses to find the role of metal oxides are necessary for informed progress. The present findings also might help to find the mechanism of the OER in the presence of coordination compounds.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000728259200001	34881752

Investigation of the electrical properties, charging process, and passivation of the electrode containing RuO2-Ta2O5 thin films was conducted as a function of electrode composition in a 0.5 mol dm(-3) H2SO4 solution. For potential values in the double layer region (0.2-1.0 V vs. RHE), the impedance profile observed at low frequency domain was attributed mainly to the capacitive behavior of the oxide/solution interface. As for the high frequency domain, the impedance profile gave evidence that the kinetic process is limited by supporting electrolyte/water diffusion inside the pores of the difficult-to-access oxide regions and/or the Ti/oxide interface. The electrode passivation mechanism toward OER (oxygen evolution reaction - 1.5 V vs. RHE) was also investigated during long-term electrolysis (j = 750 mA cm(-2) and T= 80 degrees C) by means of EIS at pre-established times. The SEM-EDS data give evidence of the increase in the TiOx interlayer. Moreover, the EIS data furnished complementary insight that helped our proposition of the deactivation mechanism.

To date, almost all photocatalysts for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) suffer from poor selectivity, low activity due to the difficulty in breaking the strong N=N bond, competition with the more favorable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and inefficient utilization of the solar spectrum. Here, a photo(electro)chemical setup is demonstrated using a hybrid plasmonic-semiconductor as an active photocatalyst under visible light. Hybrid hollow Au-Ag2O nanocages are utilized to convert atmospheric N-2 to NH3 in a pure water system without using sacrificial reagents. The average NH3 production rate of 28.2 mg m(-2) h(-1) and the solar-to-ammonia (STA) conversion efficiency of 0.017% are achieved under one sun illumination. The apparent quantum efficiency of 1.2% for NH3 production is obtained with the monochromatic light source at 685 nm, which is among the highest ever-reported values for the photocatalytic NRR. The isotopic labeling experiments using N-15(2) confirms that supplied N-2 gas is the only source of NH3 formation in the system. This work showcases the application of plasmonic photocatalysis in the challenging multi-electron nitrogen fixation.									47	5	0	0	5	0	48			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000480422400074

Active catalysts derived from Co and Ni oxides dissolve at low pH, whereas acid stable systems such as Mn oxides (MnOx) display poor OER activity. We now demonstrate a rational approach for the design of earth-abundant catalysts that are stable and active in acid by treating activity and stability as decoupled elements of mixed metal oxides. Manganese serves as a stabilizing structural element for catalytically active Co centers in CoMnOx films. In acidic solutions (pH 2.5), CoMnOx exhibits the OER activity of electrodeposited Co oxide (CoOx) with a Tafel slope of 70-80 mV per decade while also retaining the long-term acid stability of MnOx films for OER at 0.1 mA cm(-2). Driving OER at greater current densities in this system is not viable because at high anodic potentials, Mn oxides convert to and dissolve as permanganate. However, by exploiting the decoupled design of the catalyst, the stabilizing structural element may be optimized independently of the Co active sites. By screening potential-pH diagrams, we replaced Mn with Pb to prepare CoFePbOx films that maintained the high OER activity of CoOx at pH 2.5 while exhibiting long-term acid stability at higher current densities (at 1 mA cm(-2) for over 50 h at pH 2.0). Under these acidic conditions, CoFePbOx exhibits OER activity that approaches noble metal oxides, thus establishing the viability of decoupling functionality in mixed metal catalysts for designing active, acid-stable, and earth-abundant OER catalysts.									108	4	0	0	12	0	109			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000404617300010	29163926

Herein, a considerate surface engineering strategy is developed for promoting HER process taking place on nanoporous HER electrodes. Cobalt nanopore arrays (CoNPA) are fabricated as the representative nanoporous HER electrode. Then an ultrathin titanium dioxide (TiO2) with optimized thickness is conformally coated onto CoNPA for improving the wettability in order to expose more active sites, followed by a well-dispersed platinum (Pt) nanoparticles with an ultralow mass loading (ca. 54 mu g cm(-2)) anchored on TiO2 layer for enhancing the HER activity. The advanced features of nanoporous architecture in combination with the synergistic contribution from ultrathin TiO2 layer and well-dispersed Pt nanoparticles enable CoNPA@TiO2@Pt electrode exhibit outstanding HER performance in alkaline conditions, i.e., an overpotential of 29 mV needed to reach the catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and long-termed performance as well as structure stability.

The most important task in PEC water splitting is the development of an efficient and stable photoanode with effective solar light absorption, generation and separation of free charge carriers, and charge carrier transport to the surface for the oxygen evolution reaction; however, such requirements are challenging to achieve simultaneously. Here we show that this problem can be solved in polycrystalline Ta3N5-nanorods (Ta3N5-NRs) that consist of aggregated single crystalline domains. The fabricated highly-conductive photoanode with large grain domains provides enhanced light harvesting because of the efficient generation and extraction of charge carriers, which leads to a completely saturated photocurrent of 9.95 mA cm(-2) at 1.05 V (versus RHE) and delivers a solar energy conversion efficiency of 2.72% for single-photon photoanodes.									43	6	0	0	2	0	45			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000536818900012

Here we present the synthesis of two bipyridine-functionalized terthiophenes, which can be electropolymerized to give photoactive p-type semiconductors the capability to perform as photocathode in photoelectrochemical cells for water photosplitting or artificial photosynthesis. Indeed the bipyridine moiety in their structure allows the binding of transition metal carbonyl complexes employed in CO2 reduction, and their band-gap is suitable for the coupling with wide band-gap semiconductors, which have already found application as photoanodes. Finally, they are characterized by photogenerated charge carrier density between 1.1 and 1.4 x 10(19) cm(-3), with first-order recombination constant of 0.7-1.8 x 10(-2) s(-1). These figures are of the same order of magnitude of their inorganic counterparts and would therefore guarantee photoconductivity of the device and the activation of the organometallic catalysts with which they should be coupled to function as photocathodes for CO2 reduction.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1996-1073			WOS:000460666200009

We have explored the iron cerium system as they are the most abundant transition and rare earth metals, and also due to the rnutualistic impact of their size and electronic attributes that can induce critical changes in the structure and electrochemical activity. Submicrometer thick films of a series of Fe(III)-Ce(III) phosphate(oxyhydroxide) (FeCePH) are fabricated using a soft chemical strategy involving surfactant-aided assembly, spin-coating, and mild thermal annealing. FT-IR, Raman, and Xray photoelectron spectroscopies, chemical analysis, X-ray diffraction, and electron microscopy reveal the systematic structural, electronic, and morphological variation, on tuning the iron cerium composition. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption studies show the surface area increasing and pore size distribution shrinking with the cerium content, indicating its structure-directing role. The electrocatalysis of water oxidation by FeCePH films on FTO-coated glass is studied in neutral pH conditions. The overpotential and Tafel slope decrease with increasing cerium content, reaching minima at the optimal Fe:Ce ratio of 1:0.5; the turnover frequency shows a corresponding increase and maximum. The trends are explained on the basis of the structural changes in the films, and the coupling of Ce3+ / Ce4+ with Fe3+/Fe4+ that leads to active state regeneration. This study presents a rational strategy to tune the efficiency of easily fabricated transition metal-based electrocatalyst thin films through rare earth metal incorporation; it should prove useful in the design of cost-effective catalysts for water oxidation.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0743-7463			WOS:000409292500003	28817279

NO reactions with sol-gel and solution phase samples of the ferric nitrite derivative of HbA								NITRIC OXIDE-BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY				22	2	SI		180	190		10.1016/j.niox.2009.11.003				FEB 15 2010	2010	The reaction of nitric oxide (NO) with the ferric (met) nitrite derivative of human adult hemoglobin Hb is probed for both solution phase and sol-gel encapsulated populations. The evolution of both the Q band absorption spectrum and fitted populations of Hb derivatives are used to show the sequence of events Occurring when NO interacts with nitrite bound to a ferric heme in Hb. The sol-gel is used to compare the evolving populations as a function of quaternary state for the starting met-nitrite populations. The redox status of intermediates is probed using the CN- anion to trap ferric heme species. The emergent presence of reactive NO species such as N2O3 during the course of the reaction is probed using the fluorescent probe DAF-2 whereas the fluorophore Chemifluor is used as an indirect measure of the ability of the reaction to create S-nitrosothiols on glutathione. The results are consistent with the formation of a stable reactive intermediate capable of generating bioactive forms of NO. The patterns observed are consistent with a proposed mechanism whereby NO reacts with the ferric nitrite derivative to generate N2O3. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The axisymmetric initial models used in the simulations are in rotational equilibrium and possess a density stratification similar to that of configurations predicted by the merging scenario of Type la supernovae. The energy release is approximated by a single exothermic nuclear reaction 14 C-12 --> 3 Ni-56 proceeding at the rate of the C-12(C-12,He-4)Ne-20 reaction. Central and off-center ignitions have been studied.When burning is ignited in the center our results show, that independently of the shape of the star, all matter is burned into iron group elements and the star is completely disrupted after typically 200 msec. Igniting the white dwarf in an extended central region having a more or less flattened spheroidal or cylindrical shape gives rise to an initially different behaviour, but within about 100 msec the shape of the detonation wave approaches that of one being ignited only in the center. When burning is ignited off-center all carbon is consumed, too. Thus detonations in non-spherical massive white dwarfs cannot explain the observed intermediate mass elements seen in the spectra of Type Ia supernovae.									27	2	1	0	0	0	28			0004-6361			WOS:A1992HC81700035

Mn- and Co-rich spent LIBs were chosen as sustainable sources for recovering the oxides of the respective elements. The physical dismantling of Li-ion batteries, chemical leaching with 2 M acetic acid, precipitation with ammonium carbonate, hydrothermal conditioning and calcination at 650 degrees C led to the facile formation of spherical spinel MnCo2O4 with very high morphological selectivity. The obtained spherical MnCo2O4 was identified by various advanced characterization techniques. Detailed electrochemical characterization revealed that the recovered spheres of spinel MnCo2O4 were effective in catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M KOH and required an overpotential of 358 and 400 mV to generate a current density of 5 and 10 mA cm(-2), respectively, with a relatively low catalyst loading (0.001025 g cm(-2)). Comparative electrocatalytic studies carried out with recovered LiCoO2, recovered LiXMnOX+1 and commercially available catalysts such as RuO2 (c-RuO2), Co3O4 (c-Co3O4) and MnO2 (c-MnO2) revealed that the recovered spheres of spinel MnCo2O4 were more effective OER catalysts than the recovered LiCoO2, recovered LiXMnOX+1, c-Co3O4 and c-MnO2 and exhibited comparable activity to that of c-RuO2 with very little difference in overpotential (similar to 50 mV) at current densities of 5 and 10 mA cm(-2). With such a low catalyst loading, the observed electrocatalytic performance in water oxidation of a material recovered from waste is highly significant and will surely attain greater industrial importance when the recycling of spent LIBs from electronic wastes is considered.									47	3	0	0	5	0	50			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000413638400041	29027560

The hydrogen permeation behavior on zircaloy with passive film, however, is rarely understood so far. In this work, the gaseous hydrogen permeation characteristic mainly on the defect evolution of nanoscale passive films of nanoscale passive films formed hydrothermally on different types of zirconium alloys (Zirconium, Zircaloy-4, N18 and M5) was explored and compared. Surface analytical techniques were implemented to evaluate the hydrogen permeation characteristic. The AES depth profiles showed that the as-prepared oxides were hundreds of nanometers in thickness and inward diffusion occurred upon hydrogen exposure. Electrochemical measurements suggested that the oxides formed on different types of zircaloys were of similar phase structures of monoclinic zirconia but with different oxygen vacancy concentrations. XPS results comparison confirmed that niobium enhances the hydrogen resistance of the oxides, yet tin causes degradation of the oxides in the reductive environment. In view of these analyses, the involving mechanism was first proposed and discussed on the basis of point defect reactions. Copyright (C) 2016, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

B	Yuan Hao								Electrocatalytic water splitting to produce fuel hydrogen								Electrocatalytic water splitting to produce fuel hydrogen								114 pp	114 pp						2017	2017	Solar energy is regarded as a promising source for clean and sustainable energy. However, it is not a continuous energy source, thus certain strategies have to be developed to effectively convert and store it. Solar-driven electrocatalytic water splitting, which converts solar energy into chemical energy for storage as fuel hydrogen, can effectively mitigate the intermittence of solar radiation. Water splitting consists of two half reactions: water oxidation and hydrogen evolution. Both reactions rely on highly effective electrocatalysts. This dissertation is an account of four detailed studies on developing highly effective low-cost electrocatalysts for both reactions, and includes a preliminary attempt at system integration to build a functional photoanode for solar-driven water oxidation. For the water oxidation reaction, we have developed an electrochemical method to immobilize a cobalt-based (Co-OXO) water oxidation catalyst on a conductive surface to promote recyclability and reusability without affecting functionality. We have also developed a method to synthesize a manganese-based (MnOx) catalytic film in situ, generating a nanoscale fibrous morphology that provides steady and excellent water oxidation performance. The new method involves two series of cyclic voltammetry (CV) over different potential ranges, followed by calcination to increase crystallinity. The research has the potential to open avenues for synthesizing and optimizing other manganese-based water oxidation catalysts. For the hydrogen evolution reaction, we have developed a new electrodeposition method to synthesize Ni/Ni(OH)2 catalysts in situ on conductive surfaces. The new method involves only two cycles of CV over a single potential range. The resulting catalytic film has a morphology of packed walnut-shaped particles. It has superior catalytic activity and good stability over long periods. We have investigated the feasibility of incorporating manganese-based water oxidation catalysts into TiO2 to build a composite photoanode. Results show that the composite photoanode has good activity under ultraviolet (UV) illumination, and that its catalytic performance can be significantly improved by enabling light collection over a wider range of wavelengths. We have also proposed a scheme for a solar-driven water splitting device that integrates both electrocatalysts with solar energy collection and intensification, and is capable of minimizing mass transfer resistance. The dissertation concludes with suggested future work to further explore the MnOx and Ni/Ni(OH) 2 electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-13-696-6831-5	INSPEC:20149183

One is the "shuttle effect" originated from the sulfur cathode, and the other is the low Coulombic efficiency and security issues arising from the lithium metal anode. In addressing these issues, we propose a novel silicon-sulfurized poly(acrylonitrile) full battery. In this lithium metal-free system, the Li source is pre-loaded in the cathode, using a nitrogen evolution reaction (NER) to implant Li+ into the silicon/carbon anode. Sulfurized poly(acrylonitrile) based on a solid-solid conversion mechanism can fundamentally circumvent the "shuttle effect". Meanwhile, the silicon/carbon anode can achieve more efficient utilization and higher security when compared with the Li metal anode. The full cell used in this technology can deliver a capacity of 1169.3 mAh g(-1), and it can be stabilized over 100 cycles, implying its excellent electrochemical stability. Furthermore, the practical pouch cell with a high sulfur loading of 4.2 mg cm(-2) can achieve a high specific energy of 513.2 Wh kg(-1). The mechanism of the NER in cathode has also been investigated and analyzed by in situ methods. Notably, this battery design completely conforms to the current battery production technology because of the degassing of gasbag, resulting in a low manufacturing cost. This work will open the avenue to develop a lithium metal-free battery using the NER. (C) 2021 Science China Press. Published by Elsevier B.V. and Science China Press.

In this article wesummarize the research progress made by our group in the studying of monolayer MoS2 films in the past fewyears. The controlled growth of large-size MoS2 single crystals is achieved by oxygen-assisted chemical vapordeposition method. By a unique facile multisource CVD growth method, the highly oriented and large domainsize ML MoS2 films are epitaxially grown on a 4-inch wafer scale. Almost only 0 degrees and 60 degrees oriented domains arepresent in films, and the average size of MoS2 grains ranges from 100 mu m to 180 mu m . The samples exhibit theirbest optical and electrical quality ever obtained, as evidenced from their wafer-scale homogeneity, nearly perfectlattice structure, average room-temperature device mobility of similar to 70 cm(2).V-1.s(-1) and high on/off ratio of similar to 10(9) on SiO2 substrates. By adjusting the oxygen doping concentration in the MoS2 film through using an effective CVDtechnique, electrical and optical properties can be well modified, thereby greatly improving the carrier mobilitiesand controllable n-type electronic doping effects resulting from optimized oxygen doping levels of MoS2-xOx . Interms of MoS2 thin film devices and applications, the 4-inch wafer-scale high-quality MoS2 monolayers are usedto fabricate the transparent MoS2-based transistors and logic circuits on flexible substrates. This large-areaflexible FET device shows excellent electrical performance with a high device density (1,518 transistors per cm(2))and yield (97%), and exhibits a high on/off ratio (1010), current density (similar to 35 mu A.mu m(-1)), mobility (similar to 55 cm(2).V-1.s(-1))and flexibility. Based on the vertically integrated multilayer device via a layer-by-layer stacking process, anindividual layer of all-2D multifunctional FET is successfully achieved with nearly multiplied on-currentdensity, equivalent device mobility, and persevered on/off ratio and subthreshold swing (SS) of the individuallayer, the combined performance of the device is fully utilized, and the integration of " sensing-storing-computing" is realized. A two-terminal floating-gate memory (2TFGM) based artificial synapse built from all-2D van der Waals materials is prepared, the 2TFGM synaptic device exhibits excellent linear and symmetricweight update characteristics with high reliability and tunability. A large number of states of up to approximate to 300 high switching speed of 40 ns and low energy consumption of 18 fJ for a single pulse are demonstratedexperimentally. The introduction of structural domain boundaries in the basal plane of monolayer MoS2 cangreatly enhance its hydrogen evolution reaction performance by serving as active sites. The progress we havemade in the preparation of monolayer MoS2 films and the research on device characteristics is of guidingsignificance for the basic and application research of MoS2, and also is universal and instructive for other 2Dtransition metal dichalcogenides									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1000-3290			WOS:000808428400007

Due to the absence of the ozone layer in the early atmosphere it was most likely adapted to the presence of ionizing radiation continuously emitted by solar and stellar flares. That complex radiation spectrum comprises protons, alpha particles, heavy charged particle-HZE, electrons, X-ray and neutrons. Such spectrum has a significant impact on biological systems which capture light energy for e.g. photosynthesis. Oxygenic photosynthesis of plants, algae and cyanobacteria initiates at the level of photosystem II (PSII), a multisubunit protein complex embedded in the thylakoid membrane inside chloroplasts. PSII uses sunlight to power the unique photo-induced oxidation of water to atmospheric oxygen which is indispensable for most life forms. It is an especially sensitive component if exposed to space radiation and thus an important target for research aimed at improving bioregenerative life-support systems. The unicellular green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a long standing model organism for photosynthesis research. It was exposed to ionizing radiation in the ESA facility Biopan located in the Foton capsule brought to space by the Russian Soyuz for 15 days. The algae were tested in space under shielded conditions in the past, but they were never exposed to direct ionizing radiation such as in Biopan. Conditions for survival were identified. It was observed that the effect of space stress on the survival of the algae varied depending on the light conditions to which they were exposed during the flight. In some cases the flight experience caused a stimulation of the photosystem II oxygen evolution of the cells.

The formation of the surface nanotexture is associated with copper-rich nanoparticles in the copper-enriched layer beneath the residual alumina film. Specifically, the copper-rich nanoparticles support local cathodic reactions, which support the anodic dissolution of the adjacent aluminium matrix, thereby resulting in the surface nanotexture. The initial development of the surface nanotexture is grain orientation dependent. Further, the presence of smut (etching products), which is porous in nature and rich in O, Mg, Mn, Cu and Zn species, also affects the surface nanotexture evolution. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The differences found between all existing calculations and the very-low-T experiments are discussed and explored via a simple numerical model that links these cross section reductions to collinear approaches where nonadiabatic crossing is expected to dominate. The new rates are further linked to a complex chemical network that models the evolution of the CH+ abundance in the photodissociation region (PDR) and molecular cloud (MC) environments of the ISM. The abundances of CH+ are given by numerical solutions of a large set of coupled, first-order kinetics equations that employs our new chemical package KROME. The analysis that we carry out reveals that the important region for CH+ destruction is that above 100 K, hence showing that, at least for this reaction, the differences with the existing laboratory low-T experiments are of essentially no importance within the astrochemical environments discussed here because, at those temperatures, other chemical processes involving the title molecule are taking over. A detailed analysis of the chemical network involving CH+ also shows that a slight decrease in the initial oxygen abundance might lead to higher CH+ abundances because the main chemical carbon ion destruction channel is reduced in efficiency. This might provide an alternative chemical route to understand the reason why general astrochemical models fail when the observed CH+ abundances are matched with the outcomes of their calculations.									13	2	0	0	0	0	14			1089-5639			WOS:000366881000004	26061287

Recently, various transition metal-based oxides, hydroxides, sulfides, and other chalcogenide-based materials have been synthesized for developing a suitable anode material for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Among the various transition metal-based catalysts, their oxides have received much consideration for OER, especially in lower pH condition, and MnO2 is one of the oxides that have widely been used for the same. The large variation in the structural disorder of MnO2 and internal resistance at the electrode-electrolyte interfaces have limited its large-scale application. By considering the above limitations of MnO2, here in this work, we have designed Ni-doped MnO2 via a simple wet-chemical synthetic route, which has been successfully applied for OER application in 0.1 M KOH solution. Doping of various quantities of Ni into the MnO2 lattices improved the OER properties, and for achieving 10 mA/cm(2) current density, the Ni-doped MnO2 containing 0.02 M of Ni2+ ions (coined as MnO2-Ni-0.(002)(M)) demands only 445 mV overpotential, whereas the bare MnO2 required 610 mV overpotential. It has been proposed that the incorporation of nickel ions into the MnO2 lattices leads to an electron transfer from the Ni3+ ions to Mn4+, which in turn facilitates the Jahn-Teller distortion in the Mn-O octahedral unit. This electron transfer and the creation of a structural disorder in the Mn sites result in the improvization of the OER properties of the MnO2 materials.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000753447800094	34821497

In this study, the electrocatalytic performance of a series of transition metal (TM) atoms supported on MoS2 nanosheets (TM@MoS2) was systematically investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It was found that Re supported on MoS2 (Re@MoS2) has the best NRR catalytic activity with a limiting potential of -0.43 V, along with high selectivity over the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Moreover, the ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations at 500 K and density of states (DOS) calculations indicated the high thermodynamic stability and excellent electrical conductivity of Re@MoS2. A linear trend between several parameters of single atom catalysts (SACs) and the adsorption Gibbs free energy change of the NH species (Delta G(*NH)) was observed, indicating the later as a simple descriptor for the facilitated screening of novel SACs.

In particular, metal-free catalysts are intensively investigated as good substitutes for metal-based catalysts towards the HER due to their earth-abundance, good conductivity, low toxicity and low cost. Although some reviews have surveyed metal-free catalysts for water splitting, the tremendous recent advances require an update as a guide for further development. This review mainly summarizes the recent progress on theoretical calculations, experimental approaches and fundamental insights for metal-free catalysts. In particular, the Gibbs free energy of the intermediate state, Delta G(H*), is an inclusive and much more influential descriptor for HER catalysts considering advanced methods beyond density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and a fine structure and high doping content can greatly improve the catalytic activity for the HER, but make the preparation process increasingly complicated. Therefore, simple and rapid preparation routes are highly desirable and urgently required. Thus, theoretical calculations have been applied to predict the structure-activity relationship of catalysts as a guide for good design.

The synthesized Pd/B-CNPs with various amounts of palladium (5-30 wt%) were used as a hydrogen evolution electrode in PEM water electrolysis for hydrogen production. The Pd/B-CNPs surface morphological studies and electrochemical performances have been investigated by FE-SEM, EDS, TEM, ICP, XRD, XPS and Cyclic Voltammetry methods. The membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) have been fabricated using synthesized Pd/B-CNPs and its performance studied in single cell PEM water electrolyser at various experimental conditions. The synthesized 30 wt% Pd/B-3-CNPs (B-doping 6.68 at%) results have shown competitive electrochemical performance (1 A cm(-2) with 2.04 Vat 80 degrees C) and stability. Therefore the synthesized 30 wt% Pd/B-3-CNPs can be used as a promising alternative for Pt based electrocatalysts for HER in PEM cells. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Song, Jin; Gu, Xiaojun; Cao, Yaduo; Zhang, Hao								Porous oxygen vacancy- rich V2O5 nanosheets as superior semiconducting supports of nonprecious metal nanoparticles for efficient on- demand H2 evolution from ammonia borane under visible light irradiation								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				7	17			10543	10551		10.1039/c9ta01674k				MAY 7 2019	2019	From the perspective of controlling visible-light-driven catalytic activities of supported metal catalysts by tailoring the band structures of semiconducting supports, we calcined pristine V2O5 in a H2 atmosphere at 250-350-C to synthesize a series of porous two-dimensional V2O5 nanosheets with narrow bandgaps and rich oxygen vacancies, which supported Co and Ni nanoparticles as catalysts for visiblelight- driven on-demand H2 evolution from ammonia borane (NH3BH3) in aqueous solution at 25-C. The systematic investigations showed that all the catalysts had higher activities under visible light irradiation than in the dark and one Co catalyst exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity with a total turnover frequency (TOF) value of 120.4 min-1, which exceeded the values of all the reported noble metal-free catalysts. Structural characterization indicated that pristine V2O5 and the three post-modified V2O5 species had different bandgaps, valence band positions and concentrations of oxygen vacancies as well as different photocurrent densities, leading to different electron densities of active metal NPs in the supported catalysts with different catalytic activities. This was verified using the UV-vis spectra, valence band X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction patterns and electrochemical characterization of various V2O5 species and the corresponding photocatalytic performance of catalysts.									21	0	0	0	2	0	21			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472183200041		
J	Li, H.; Luo, X.; Chen, M.; Liu, C.; Wu, X.; Feng, Y.; Zhang, B.								Porous organic polymers involving chloro-substituted peryleneimide for photocatalytic water oxidation under visible light irradiation								Chemical Engineering Journal				443				136463	136463		10.1016/j.cej.2022.136463				2022	2022	Porous organic polymers (POPs) have become a class of promising photocatalytic materials for solar water splitting due to their high structural adjustability, multiple active sites and high stability against water corrosion. However, because of the complex transfer process involved and the large overpotential required for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the studies about POP type semiconductor photocatalysts for the efficient photocatalytic OER are very few. Here, we design and prepare a novel POP type photocatalyst 4Clper-POPs constructed by chlorine-modified peryleneimide and aromatic aldehyde that can significantly improve the photocatalytic OER activity. The band gap of as-synthesized 4Clper-POPs is 1.28 eV, indicating that they possess a wide light absorption range extended to the near-infrared region. Moreover, 4Clper-POPs exhibit a large oxidation potential to drive the photocatalytic OER. More importantly, combining the results of experiments and the first-principles calculations, under the condition of AgNO3 as the electronic sacrificial agent, it can be obtained that the chlorine element in the 4Clper-POPs can effectively accumulate AgNO3 and the reduced Ag nanoparticles (NPs), facilitating the rapid transport of electrons. Under visible light, 4Clper-POPs exhibit the highest average O2 evolution efficiency (714.17 mumol g-1h-1) with 5 wt% Co2+ loaded among all the reported POP materials used for the OER. Our findings provide design ideas of POP type semiconductor photocatalysts for the efficient OER. All rights reserved Elsevier.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1873-3212			INSPEC:21891291

By applying an active-data-mining approach, employing a mean-field kinetic model and a statistical approach of Bayesian data assimilation, we demonstrate here a fast decoding to extract key properties in the kinetics of complicated electrode processes from current-potential profiles in experimental and literary data. As the proof-of-concept, kinetic parameters on the four-electron oxygen reduction reaction in the 0.1 M HClO4 solution (ORR: O-2 + 4e(-) + 4H(+) -> 2H(2)O) of various platinumbased single-crystal electrocatalysts are extracted from our own experiments and third-party literature to investigate the microscopic electrode processes. Furthermore, data assimilation of the mean-field ORR model and experimental data is performed based on Bayesian inference for the inductive estimation of kinetic parameters, which sheds light on the dynamic behavior of kinetic parameters with respect to overpotential. This work shows that a fast-decoding algorithm based on a mean-field kinetic model and Bayesian data assimilation is a promising data-driven approach to extract key microscopic features of complicated electrode processes and therefore will be an important method toward building up advanced human-machine collaborations for the efficient search and discovery of high-performance electrochemical materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000757799300001	35135188

The far-red light excitations are supporting the photochemical activity of photosystem II, as is indicated by the increased chlorophyll fluorescence in response to the reduction of the photosystem II primary electron acceptor, Q(A). The results also demonstrate that the far-red photosystem II excitations are susceptible to non-photochemical quenching, although less than the red excitations. Uphill activation energies of 9.8 +/- 0.5 kJ mol(-1) and 12.5 +/- 0.7 kJ mol(-1) have been revealed in sunflower leaves for the 716 and 740 nm illumination, respectively, from the temperature dependencies of quantum yields, comparable to the corresponding energy gaps of 8.8 and 14.3 kJ mol(-1) between the 716 and 680 nm, and the 740 and 680 nm light quanta. Similarly, the non-photochemical quenching of far-red excitations is facilitated by temperature confirming thermal activation of the far-red quanta to the photosystem II core. The observations are discussed in terms of as yet undisclosed far-red forms of chlorophyll in the photosystem II antenna, reversed (uphill) spill-over of excitation from photosystem I antenna to the photosystem II antenna, as well as absorption from thermally populated vibrational sub-levels of photosystem II chlorophylls in the ground electronic state. From these three interpretations, our analysis favours the first one, i.e., the presence in intact plant leaves of a small number of far-red chlorophylls of photosystem II. Based on analogy with the well-known far-red spectral forms in photosystem I, it is likely that some kind of strongly coupled chlorophyll dimers/aggregates are involved. The similarity of the result for sunflower and bean proves that both the extreme long-wavelength oxygen evolution and the local quantum yield maximum are general properties of the plants.

The hybrid kernel function is used to enhance the performance of the existing kernels. To improve the model's accuracy, the internal parameters are optimized by a differential evolution algorithm. In light of the complex mechanisms of the converter steelmaking process, a multistage modeling strategy is designed instead of the traditional singlestage modeling method. Owing to the dynamic nature of the practical production process, great effort has been made to construct a dynamic model that uses the prediction error information based on the static model. The validity of the proposed method is verified through experiments on real-world data collected from a basic oxygen furnace steelmaking process. The results indicate that the proposed method can successfully solve dynamic prediction problems and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy.Note to Practitioners-With the development of cyber-physical systems, abundant real-time data have been collected from the converter steelmaking process. These data provide an opportunity to solve product quality prediction problems using data-driven models. This paper proposes a dynamic analytics method based on the least squares support vector machine with a hybrid kernel to address this challenging issue. To improve the model's performance, a differential evolution algorithm is used to optimize its parameters. Because of the fierce physicochemical reaction in the converter furnace, it is difficult for a single-stage model to achieve accurate predictions. Thus, a multistage modeling strategy is proposed to address this difficulty, and a dynamic model based on feedback error is developed to realize real-time prediction. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed method using real data from a basic oxygen furnace (BOF) steelmaking process. The computational results reveal that the proposed method has a higher prediction accuracy than other methods, making it helpful in guaranteeing the specified product quality and in maintaining stable BOF operation.									47	1	1	0	1	0	49			1545-5955	1558-3783		WOS:000473649700008

The particles are divided into three categories according to their temporal behaviour. All charged particles exhibit oscillations with the same frequency as the driven power. Densities of elements O, N and H increase in a long-time scale. Densities of O3 and NO increase firstly and then decrease at t = 0.65 s; in particular, they have very similar density evolution profiles to each other.									5	4	0	0	0	0	5			0256-307X			WOS:000233180800045

The flower-like bundles consist of many thin and uniform hexagonal-structured ZnO nanosheets, with a thickness of 50 nm. The selected area electronic diffraction (SAED) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) images indicate that the ZnO nanosheets are single crystal in nature. The growth mechanism of the flower-like bundles of ZnO nanosheets is discussed based on the morphology evolution with growth times and reaction conditions. It is believed that the formation of flower-like bundles of ZnO nanosheets is related to the shielding effect of OH-ions and the self-assembly process, which is dominated by a preheating time. Room temperature photoluminescence spectra results show that the annealing atmosphere strongly affects the visible emission band, which is sensitive to intrinsic and surface defects, especially oxygen interstitials, in flower-like bundles of ZnO nanosheets.									23	0	0	0	2	0	23			1687-4110	1687-4129		WOS:000347329200001

The nanostructured materials are revolutionizing the water splitting technology into decoupled hydrogen with simultaneous value-added organic chemical production. Yet, the bottleneck in semiconductor photocatalysis is rapid charge recombination and sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, we demonstrate an efficient and non-noble metal-based catalyst for successful redox reaction with a theoretical modeling through density functional theory (DFT) study. Implementing this robust approach on 2D/1D ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets and TiO2 nanowires heterojunction, we achieved H2 production of 5.1 mmol g-1 h-1 with apparent quantum efficiency of 7.8% under visible light illumination and 93% of benzylamine conversion to N-benzylidene benzylamine in situ. The interface of 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets and 1D nanowires provide ample active sites and extends the visible light absorption with requisite band edge position for the separation of photoinduced charge carriers with superior stability. The electronic properties, band structure, and stability of the heterojunction are further investigated via DFT calculations which corroborate the experimental results and in good agreement for the enhanced activity of the heterojunction.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000812818400001	35506450

Understanding the role of ligands used to prepare colloidal nanocrystals in catalysis is challenging due to the complexity and heterogeneity of nanocrystal surfaces. We use in situ single-molecule fluorescence imaging to map the spatial distribution of active regions along individual tungsten oxide nanowires before and after functionalizing them with ascorbic acid. Rather than blocking active sites, we observed a significant enhancement in activity for photocatalytic water oxidation after treatment with ascorbic acid. While the initial nanowires contain inactive regions dispersed along their length, the functionalized nanowires show high uniformity in their photocatalytic activity. Spatial colocalization of the active regions with their surface chemical properties shows that oxidation of ascorbic acid during photocatalysis generates new oxygen vacancies along the nanowire surface. We demonstrate that controlling surface-ligand redox chemistry during photocatalysis can enhance the active site concentration on nanocrystal catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000816896600001	35674669

To resolve low-efficiency issues, lead halide perovskite (LHP) with outstanding optoelectronic properties compared to conventional semiconductors can be a promising approach to improve the solar-to-fuel conversion reactions and solar fuel production efficiency. The tunable energy band structure and charge transport properties of LHP have promoted their extensive use in the production of solar fuels. This study summarizes the recent advancements of LHP-mediated solar-to-fuel conversions, classified by their redox reactions, namely solar water splitting, hydrohalic acid splitting, and CO2 reduction. Advanced approaches for achieving high conversion efficiency and long-term durability are discussed, including the configuration of devices, the composition of LHP, and the protection strategy of LHP. Moreover, the reaction mechanisms of LHP-mediated solar-to-chemical energy conversions and obstacles for enhancing the conversion efficiency are discussed. Finally, we present the perspectives on the development of LHP-incorporated solar-to-fuel conversion systems, which might open a new era of energy harvesting and storage.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy are employed for qualitative and quantitative analyses of the different compounds involved during the oxidation of nickel. Atomic force microscopy is used for both imaging the evolution of the oxide layer and determining its surface roughness. The in situ oxidation process of nickel demonstrates three stages: rapid formation of a compact surface oxide (first stage), thicker oxide layer (second stage), and a porous oxide structure (third stage). The lithiation reaction has been identified to occur during the second stage. Formation of an intermediate and unstable compound, namely NiCO3, has been confirmed by XRD.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			1432-8488			WOS:000171816300014

The optimal Ni/Co (molar ratio) and the amount of doping Mn are investigated, the sample with Ni/Co = 1:3 and the addition of 0.4 mmol Mn exhibits the best catalytic activity with the largest specific surface area. Then the two-electrode electrolyzers composed of NNi1Co3Mn0.4O/NF are constructed, and the results from experiments show that the voltage required for overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) at 100 mA cm-2 is 0.272 V, 1.614 V lower than that of overall water splitting (OWS, 1.886 V), while the overall urea splitting (OUS) needs 1.669 V, 0.187 V lower than that of OWS, revealing the outstanding thermodynamic and kinetic advantages of OUS and OHzS. The superior performance may be attributed to the heterostructure between metal and metal oxide and N-doping, which can promote electron transfer and optimizes the decomposition of urea and hydrazine hydrate and hydrogen production, and the research on mechanism will be carried out in the future.

The effect; of the OFR, on the film's structural and optical properties was systematically investigated by using X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy and spectrophotometry. The Ag(x)O films deposited clearly show an evolution of the film's phase structure from the biphased (Ag + Ag(2)O) structure to the biphased (AgO + Ag(2)O) structure and then to the single-phased (Ag(2)O) structure as value of the OFR increases. Accordingly, the film's surface morphology, related to the film's crystalline structure, clearly changes from a loose and porous surface structure to a compact surface structure and then to a pyramid-like surface structure with increasing value of the OFR. The novel porous structure may be attributed to the interruption of the silver's growth course by the AgO on the film's surface. Notably, a single-phased Ag(2)O film is deposited by DC-sputtering at OFR = 0.5 due to the dual effects of thermal decomposition of the AgO phase and a combination reaction of AgO and Ag to Ag(2)O. The oscillations both in the film's reflectivity and transmissivity spectra are strengthened with increasing OFR, indicating an evolution from the metallic behavior of the biphased (Ag + Ag(2)O) film to the dielectric behavior of the biphased (Ag(2)O + AgO) film and the single-phased Ag(2)O film. The fitted optical absorption edges of the Ag(2)O and the Ag(x)O films deposited at values of the OFR, of 0.5 and 0.33 are approximately 2.43 eV and 2.34 eV, respectively.

Herein, density functional theory calculations are used to screen for suitable HER catalysts among 24 two-dimensional double transition-metal (TM) carbide MXenes (chemical composition M-2'M '' C2Tx and M-2'M-2 '' C3Tx; M' and M '' are two different metals, M' = Cr, V, Ti, or Nb; M '' = Nb, Ta, Ti, or V; and T = O and/or OH) and determine their thermodynamic stability under HER-relevant conditions. The established surface Pourbaix diagrams, describing the chemistry on the basal planes of the MXenes, reveal the most stable terminations under the standard conditions (U = 0, pH = 0, p = 1 bar, and T = 298 K) for Mo2Mx '' C-y, Ti2Mx '' C-y, and Nb2Ta2C3 to be O-termination, whereas Cr2Mx '' C-y and V2M2 '' C-3 expose a mixed O- and OH-termination (M '' = Nb, Ta, Ti, or V; x = 1, y = 2, or x = 2, y = 3). Eighteen different carbides are predicted to be active HER electrocatalyst candidates, and Mo2NbC2O2 showed the lowest overpotential. The Pourbaix diagrams and free energy diagrams reveal that the stability of the functional groups under HER-relevant conditions and the HER performance of the investigated double metal MXenes are closely related to its outermost TM. In other words, the outermost metal dominates the basal plane chemistry of the double TM carbide MXenes. Bader charge, density of states, and the crystal orbital Hamilton population analyses indicate that the hydrogen binding strength on different functionalized MXenes is related to the initial outer layer metal M'-O bond. A guiding observation is that the weaker the M'-O bond of the MXenes, the stronger the bonding between the terminated O* and the adsorbed H. Overall, this investigation demonstrates that the double TM carbides, as a subfamily of MXenes, provide a plethora of design opportunities, in particular as promising electrocatalysts for HER and other reactions.									31	1	0	0	0	0	31			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000535281300034		
J	Chan, Yu-Te; Tsai, Ming-Kang					Tsai, Ming-Kang/0000-0001-9189-5572			CO2 reduction catalysis by tunable square-planar transition-metal complexes: a theoretical investigation using nitrogen-substituted carbon nanotube models								PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS				19	43			29068	29076		10.1039/c7cp06024f				NOV 21 2017	2017	In this work, using density functional theory, we have characterized the CO2 reduction capabilities of a series of nine transition-metal-chelated nitrogen-substituted carbon nanotube models (TM-4N2v-CNT). Each of the chelated models consists of a four-N-substituted and one vacancy framework to mimic square planar homogeneous catalysts, and is coordinated to Fe, Ru, Os, Co, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pt or Cu. The results are further investigated to search for the possible electrochemical intermediates along the CO2 reduction pathway. We've found that all of the tested elements are predicted to favor the hydrogen evolution reaction over CO2 reduction energetically (with the exception of Cu), and that only Group 8 elements are predicted to bind CO effectively and other cases prefer HCOOH formation. The observed CO binding preference could be rationalized via ligand field theory based on the molecular orbitals of the square planar complexes. With a suitable applied voltage to stabilize all of the adsorbed CO intermediates, Ru and Os are predicted to produce CH4, whereas Fe is predicted to produce CH3OH. Increasing the curvature of the CNT could reduce the required potential in the potential-determining step substantially. However, the predicted catalytic sequence is subject to only the selection of a metal center.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000414773100005	29077096

Used amorphous boron powder with the particle size of 1...5 mum and molybdenum powder with the particle size of about 30...40 mum. The discharge was created with gyrotron impulse with the frequency of 75 GHz, 4 ms duration and the power up to 350 kW. For optical temperature measurements were used lines of atoms and ions of the basic substances and the lines of impurities (iron, titanium and oxygen, etc.) presenting in small amounts. We registered two phases of the microwave discharge in the experiment. In the first phase, after the breakdown, a spark plasma discharge was developed. The optical continuum spectra were observed with the atomic (Mo I, N I, Ti! ; Fe l, etc.) and ion lines (Mo ll, N I!, Ti ll, etc.). The surface temperature of the powder, plasma and gas reached 4000... 6000 degC. In the second phase of the discharge was initiated a chemical reaction of self-propagating high-temperature synthesis. Synthesis reaction evolved both the main materials, and the impurities. In the optical spectrum, against the continuum, were observed broad molecular bands, atomic lines have not been determined. Duration of the high-temperature synthesis reached 40...50 ms. A slow decrease in temperature from 4000 K to 1000 K was observed. Such microwave discharges can be used in nanotechnology for the synthesis of new materials.									0	0	1	0	0	0	1			2072-9995			INSPEC:13988447		
J	Scalo, Carlo; Piomelli, Ugo; Boegman, Leon					Piomelli, Ugo/0000-0002-7834-7894			Self-similar decay and mixing of a high-Schmidt-number passive scalar in an oscillating boundary layer in the intermittently turbulent regime								JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS				726				338	370		10.1017/jfm.2013.228				JUL 2013	2013	We performed numerical simulations of dissolved oxygen (DO) transfer from a turbulent flow, driven by periodic boundary-layer turbulence in the intermittent regime, to underlying DO-absorbing organic sediment layers. A uniform initial distribution of oxygen is left to decay (with no re-aeration) as the turbulent transport supplies the sediment with oxygen from the outer layers to be absorbed. A very thin diffusive sublayer at the sediment-water interface (SWI), caused by the high Schmidt number of DO in water, limits the overall decay rate. A decomposition of the instantaneous decaying turbulent scalar field is proposed, which results in the development of similarity solutions that collapse the data in time. The decomposition is then tested against the governing equations, leading to a rigorous procedure for the extraction of an ergodic turbulent scalar field. The latter is composed of a statistically periodic and a steady non-decaying field. Temporal averaging is used in lieu of ensemble averaging to evaluate flow statistics, allowing the investigation of turbulent mixing dynamics from a single flow realization. In spite of the highly unsteady state of turbulence, the monotonically decaying component is surprisingly consistent with experimental and numerical correlations valid for steady high-Schmidt-number turbulent mass transfer. Linearly superimposed onto it is the statistically periodic component, which incorporates all the features of the non-equilibrium state of turbulence. It is modulated by the evolution of the turbulent coherent structures driven by the oscillating boundary layer in the intermittent regime, which are responsible for the violent turbulent production mechanisms. These cause, in turn, a rapid increase of the turbulent mass flux at the edge of the diffusive sublayer. This outer-layer forcing mechanism drives a periodic accumulation of high scalar concentration levels in the near-wall region. The resulting modulated scalar flux across the SWI is delayed by a quarter of a cycle with respect to the wall-shear stress, consistently with the non-equilibrium state of the turbulent mixing.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0022-1120	1469-7645		WOS:000327870600002

The geometry, process variables and removal of oxygen bubbles in these cells need to be optimized. Bubbles tend to remain attached to the catalytic surface, thus blocking the reaction, and they therefore need to be dragged out of the cell. Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations have been carried out to assess the design of miniaturized cells and their results have been compared with experimental results. It has been found that low liquid inlet velocities (similar to 0.1 m/s) favor the homogeneous distribution of the flow. Moderate velocities (0.5-1 m/s) favor preferred paths. High velocities (similar to 2 m/s) lead to turbulent behavior of the flow, but avoid bubble coalescence and help to drag the bubbles. Gravity has a limited effect at this velocity. Finally, channeled cells have also been analyzed and they allow a good flow distribution, but part of the catalytic area could be lost. The here presented results can be used as guidelines for the optimum design of photocatalytic cells for the water splitting reaction for the production of solar fuels, such as H-2 or other CO2 reduction products (i.e., CO, CH4, among others).									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2311-5521			WOS:000417149300013

The facile cost-effective fabrication strategy including hydrothermal self-assembly of 3D-GN and subsequent low-temperature phosphidation is implemented. The obtained hybrids exhibit pH-universal electrocatalytic activity towards ORR thanks to facilitated mass diffusion, boosted charge transport, and abundance of electroactive sites as a result of the synergistic effect of co-doped heteroatoms and metal phosphide nanoparticles. The virtues of large specific surface area and 3D-interconnected microporous and mesoporous architecture, as well as tailoring of the surface with CoP and N,S-co-doping, facilitate the ORR catalytic activity and offer four-electron pathways both in acidic (n = 3.962) and alkaline media (n = 3.991). CoP@N,S-3D-GN offered long-term stability with 91.8% and 82.8% retention of initial current after 25,000 s in 0.1 M KOH and 0.1 M HClO4 electrolytes, respectively. The boosted electrocatalytic performance of CoP@N,S-3D-GN puts forward its up-and-coming usage of noble metal-free electrocatalysts alternative to platinum-group metals for ORR. This work paves the way for designing the next generation electrocatalysts for renewable energy systems due to the intriguing features including pH-universal catalytic activity, satisfactory durability, relatively low-cost and scalable production method.									27	0	0	0	13	0	27			2162-8769	2162-8777		WOS:000661491700001

We report the cloning of the first non-Bohr effect beta-globin cDNA from an adult Atlantic salmon kidney bank. Nucleotide sequence analysis of this cDNA shows that the predicted beta-globin peptide comprises 147 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 15 975 Da and an overall amino acid homology of 40 to 50% to higher vertebrates and 60-90% to fish sequences. This sequence confirms the important amino acid residues which are changed thus causing loss of the Bohr effect [Powers, D.A. and Edmunson, A.B. (1972) Multiple hemoglobins of catostomid fish. J. Biol. Chem. 247, 6686-6693; Brunori, M. (1975) Molecular adaptation to physiological requirements: the hemoglobin system of trout. Curr. Topics Cell. Regul. 9, 1-39]. This loss allows the haemoglobin protein to have a higher oxygen affinity, as it does not release oxygen when the pH of the surrounding environment decreases, which is an important ability for the fish in times of stress.

The calculation based on Huckel theory indicates that PAHs (3H-cydopenta[a]anthracene oxyradical) with oxyradicals on a five-membered ring site have high chemical reactivity. The rate coefficients of PAH oxyradical decomposition were evaluated by using RiceRamspergerKasselMarcus theory and solving the master equations in the temperature range of 15002500 K and the pressure range of 0.110 atm. The kinetic calculations revealed that the rate coefficients of PAH oxyradical decomposition are temperature-, pressure-, and surface site-dependent, and the oxyradical on a five-membered ring is easier to decompose than that on a six-membered ring. Four-membered rings were found in decomposition of the five-membered ring, and a new reaction channel of PAH evolution involving four-membered rings is recommended.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000345892200001	25386793

Our intent was to determine any possible foci of asymmetry besides the one determined for meteoritic amino acids. As a probe, we employed a very sensitive asymmetric autocatalytic reaction. We were able to determine that asymmetry still resides in powders after extraction with water and solvents as well as in the insoluble organic material (IOM) obtained after demineralization. Asymmetry is not found any longer in the IOM after hydrothermal treatment and in meteorite powders from which all organics had been removed by O-2 plasma at low temperature. The data are interpreted to indicate a diverse molecular asymmetry residing in yet unknown meteorite organics; these organics might have had an inductive effect on organic molecular evolution upon exogenous delivery to the early Earth.

Both the discharge products and the detonation forming process which is assisted by the plasma are analyzed. It is found that the patterns of the temporal and spatial distributions of discharge products in one cycle are not changed by the actuating frequency. However, the concentration of every species decreases as the actuating frequency rises, and atom O is the most sensitive to this variation, which is related to the decrease of discharge power. With respect to the reaction flow of the detonation tube, the deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) time and distance both increase as the actuating frequency rises, but the degree of effect on DDT development during flow field evolution is erratic. Generally, the actuating frequency affects none of the amplitude value of the pressure, temperature, species concentration of the flow field, and the combustion degree within the reaction zone.									1	1	0	0	0	0	1			1674-1056	1741-4199		WOS:000426948700008

Specific kinetics scavenging experiments coupled with quantum yield determinations were used to distinguish the roles of various reactive species induced by self-sensitized and direct photolysis reactions, and the excited triplet state of PPB ((PPB)-P-3*) was identified as the most important species to initiate the photochemical degradation of PPB in aquatic environments. The computational results of time-resolved absorption spectra proved that (PPB)-P-3* is a highly reactive electron acceptor, and a head-to-tail hydrogen transfer mechanism probably occurs through electron coupled with proton transfer. Physical quenching by, or chemical reaction of (PPB)-P-3* with, O-2 was confirmed as a key step affecting the initial PPB transformation pathways and degradation mechanisms. The transformation products were identified and the toxicity evolutions of PPB solutions during photochemical degradation under aerobic and anaerobic conditions were compared. The results indicate that anaerobic conditions are more likely than aerobic conditions to lead to the elimination and detoxification of PPB but less likely to lead to PPB mineralization.

The iron-containing nanoparticles existed in the form of alpha-Fe in the SiC fibers pyrolyzed below 1000 degrees C. Above 1200 degrees C, most of the iron-containing nanoparticles existed in the form of Fe3Si. The SiC grains became obviously coarse above 1600 degrees C due to the decomposition of SiCxOy. After being sintered at 1800 degrees C, the final iron-containing SiC fibers were oxygen-free and remained dense. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

This work looks in the effects of humidity of the synthesis process to the morphology, chemical structure, band structure as well as the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 materials. Four g-C3N4 samples were prepared by heating melem in four gas environments: dry Ar, dry Air, moist Ar and moist Air. The photocatalytic activity measurements revealed that the samples synthesized in moist inert and oxidic gases environments displayed 20 and 10 times the photocatalytic H-2 evolution activity of the samples synthesized in dry inert and oxidic gases environments, respectively. The reasons for this remarkable variety in photocatalytic activities had been through investigated. After all, the terminations of the carbon vacancies were identified as the dominant factor in enhancing H-2 evolution performance. The work here thus demonstrating an example of defect engineering.

In this study, a two-stage partial nitritation (PN)-anammox (floc-granule) system was established to treat reject water (COD/NH4+-N = 0.97 +/- 0.15), and the evolution of organic compounds along PN and annamox bioreactors was investigated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and excitation emission matrix. Also, the variation of PN and anammox sludge properties relating to COD reduction was examined. The PN-anammox system removed approximately 80% of total inorganic nitrogen and COD with hydraulic reaction time of 16 h. The influent organics (330-600 mg COD/L) in reject water were primarily composed of volatile, protein-like and humic acid-like organic compounds. PN process contributed 53 +/- 18% of the overall COD removal, primarily including oxygen-containing organics (e.g. phenol), proteins and humic acids. Anammox process contributed 22 +/- 15% of the overall COD removal, but large molecule acids (e.g. lactic acid) and small molecule alcohols (e.g. glycerol) were reoccurred, contributing to the effluent COD with recalcitrant hydrocarbons (e.g. n-Octadecane). Reject water increased the extracellular proteins/polysaccharides ratio of PN and anammox sludge, promoting the adsorption and degradation of organic compounds. High-throughput sequencing results showed that denitrifying bacteria of Ottowia increased from 0.03% to 14.4% in PN reactor, and of Denitratisoma increased from 9.6% to 15.4% in anammox reactor. The occurrence of these denitrifiers might mitigate the negative impact of organics to functional organisms. This study highlights the organics fate during PN-anammox treatment system, which is important to maintain the robust nitrogen removal when treating organics-containing and high ammonium concentration wastewater.

Hydrogen energy production using manganese/semiconductor system inspired by photosynthesis								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				42	12			8530	8538		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.01.100				MAR 23 2017	2017	Hydrogen is the most efficient and the cleanest fuel. Inspired by photosynthesis, which is able to catalyze water-splitting reaction to achieve energy storage on the large scale at room temperature and neutral pH in nature, artificial systems and technology have been increasing advanced and great progresses have been made over the past decades. The three-dimensional structure of photosystem II with oxygen-evolving activity has been determined at an atomic level, which provides a thorough image with the specific position of each atom in the Mn4CaO5 cluster. These advancements have significantly enhanced our understanding of the mechanisms of water splitting in photosynthesis and offered a unique opportunity for hydrogen fuel production. In this review, the recent efforts in the area of manganese/semiconductor system for hydrogen generation were summarized with examples and discussed to highlight the operation mechanisms of this kind of catalytic configuration. A robust PS II mimic containing manganese/semiconductor nanostructure to accomplish the photo water splitting chemistry was evaluated. The development, mechanism, and future improvement of the manganese/semiconductor system were presented. The manganese/semiconductor system is highly likely to offer novel technology for hydrogen energy production. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Electrochemical reduction of CO2 and H+/H2O is an alternative renewable route to produce syngas. Here we introduce the concept of coupling a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst with a CDots/C3N4 composite (a CO2 reduction catalyst) to achieve a cheap, stable, selective and efficient route for tunable syngas production. Co3O4, MoS2, Au and Pt serve as the HER component. The Co3O4-CDots-C3N4 electrocatalyst is found to be the most efficient among the combinations studied. The H-2/CO ratio of the produced syngas is tunable from 0.07:1 to 4:1 by controlling the potential. This catalyst is highly stable for syngas generation (over 100 h) with no other products besides CO and H-2. Insight into the mechanisms balancing between CO2 reduction and H-2 evolution when applying the HER-CDots-C3N4 catalyst concept is provided.									112	8	0	0	12	0	112			2041-1723			WOS:000416399700001	29184053

Bixby, Teresa/0000-0003-2157-791X			Femtosecond pump-probe studies of actinic-wavelength dependence in aqueous chlorine dioxide photochemistry								JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS				130	15					154503	10.1063/1.3116108				APR 21 2009	2009	The actinic or photolysis-wavelength dependence of aqueous chlorine dioxide (OClO) photochemistry is investigated using femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy. Following photoexcitation at 310, 335, and 410 nm the photoinduced evolution in optical density is measured from the UV to the near IR. Analysis of the optical-density evolution illustrates that the quantum yield for atomic chlorine production (Phi(Cl)) increases with actinic energy, with Phi(Cl)=0.16 +/- 0.02 for 410 nm excitation and increasing to 0.25 +/- 0.01 and 0.54 +/- 0.10 for 335 and 310 nm excitations, respectively. Consistent with previous studies, the production of Cl occurs through two channels, with one channel corresponding to prompt (< 5 ps) Cl formation and the other corresponding to the thermal decomposition of ClOO formed by OClO photoisomerization. The partitioning between Cl production channels is dependent on actinic energy, with prompt Cl production enhanced with an increase in actinic energy. Limited evidence is found for enhanced ClO production with an increase in actinic energy. Stimulated emission and excited-state absorption features associated with OClO populating the optically prepared (2)A(2) surface decrease with an increase in actinic energy suggesting that the excited-state decay dynamics are also actinic energy dependent. The studies presented here provide detailed information on the actinic-wavelength dependence of OClO photochemistry in aqueous solution.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0021-9606			WOS:000265486300029	19388755

The Sabatier Principle in Electrocatalysis: Basics, Limitations, and Extensions								FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH				9						654460	10.3389/fenrg.2021.654460				MAY 4 2021	2021	The Sabatier principle, which states that the binding energy between the catalyst and the reactant should be neither too strong nor too weak, has been widely used as the key criterion in designing and screening electrocatalytic materials necessary to promote the sustainability of our society. The widespread success of density functional theory (DFT) has made binding energy calculations a routine practice, turning the Sabatier principle from an empirical principle into a quantitative predictive tool. Given its importance in electrocatalysis, we have attempted to introduce the reader to the fundamental concepts of the Sabatier principle with a highlight on the limitations and challenges in its current thermodynamic context. The Sabatier principle is situated at the heart of catalyst development, and moving beyond its current thermodynamic framework is expected to promote the identification of next-generation electrocatalysts.									34	0	0	0	3	0	33			2296-598X			WOS:000651221300001		
J	Sakaushi, Ken				Sakaushi, Ken/B-3790-2011	Sakaushi, Ken/0000-0003-4797-9087			Quantum proton tunneling in multi-electron/-proton transfer electrode processes								FARADAY DISCUSSIONS				221				428	448		10.1039/c9fd00032a				JAN 1 2020	2020	Quantum proton tunneling (QPT) in two representative multi-electron/-proton transfer electrode processes, i.e. hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), was investigated using polycrystalline platinum (pcPt) and gold (pcAu) electrodes at 298 kelvin (K). To observe quantum effects in the electrode processes, the hydrogen/deuterium kinetic isotope effect constant ratio (equivalent to K-H/D) was measured in various conditions. For the HER in both acidic and alkaline conditions, results show that the pcPt exhibits a negligible or weak QPT evident by the small value of K-H/D (1 < K-H/D < 3), which indicates that the semiclassical transition state theory (SC-TST) scheme dominates the rate-determining step (RDS). For pcAu in an alkaline condition, the K-H/D was a small value of ca. 1 at a low eta region around 0.2 V. However, at a high eta region >0.6 V, a high K-H/D (>13) was obtained. These results suggest a transition of the electrode process from SC-TST to a full QTP in the RDS on increasing the overpotential. For ORR with pcPt, K-H/D higher than the theoretical maximum in SC-TST was observed in the alkaline condition at a low overpotential region. A primitive but robust theoretical analysis suggests that the QPT governs the rate-determining step of ORR in this condition. However, this full QPT path transits to the classical in a higher overpotential region. Therefore, contrary to the HER on pcAu in alkaline, the electrode process shows a transition from a full QPT to SC-TST on increasing the overpotential. No QPT in ORR on a pcPt electrode was observed in an acidic condition. This report describes that the QPT in surface electrochemical systems is strongly affected by the choice of system. Although several systems show a clear manifestation of QPT in the electrode processes and also primitive interpretations can be made of these observations, deriving a fine molecular-level picture of the results including several complicated effects remains challenging. However, the observations suggest that selection of a full QPT path might be affected strongly by different microscopic proton transfer mechanisms, i.e. proton transfer from hydronium ion or water molecules.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			1359-6640	1364-5498		WOS:000505590900020	31539014

Their oxidation kinetics in pressurized water reactor primary water at 325 degrees C were determined using ion beam analyses. After a 24 h exposure, the internal oxide layer reaches a thickness equivalent to the implanted affected depth (90 nm) which does not change much for longer exposure duration. Two-stages corrosion experiments followed by secondary ion mass spectrometry analyses have revealed two oxygen diffusion regimes in the internal oxide layer, which seems to be linked with the distribution of implanted defects.

The distribution of the constituent elements was tested in X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Samples of the as-extruded material were annealed at 873 K for various times. The microstructure changed due to a solid-state reaction between the Al-matrix and heavy-metal oxides. The distribution of oxygen was analyzed by EDS across oxide/matrix boundaries in order to test an Al-matrix oxidation nearby pre-existing oxide particles. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed an intermetallic grain growth after long annealing times. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The growth process is found to start from Pt nano-cuboid seeds, then PtZn nanoclovers which are formed from epitaxial growth, and then the flower-like PtZn crystals and finally the novel PtZn-ND. The formation mechanism of PtZn-ND, in particular the effects of hexadecyltrimethyammonium bromide (CTAB) and oleic acid (OA) on the morphology, crystal shape and exposure lattice facets, have been comparatively and systematically studied. And it turns out that CTAB mainly controls depositing directions, while OA mainly controls the crystal shape/size. The combination effect results in unique PtZn-ND structures. The novel PtZn-ND also displays superior catalytic performance and anti-sulfate poisoning ability. In particular, the mass activity (MA) and specific activity (SA) are 5.72 and 7.55 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C, and still 2.91 and 5.09 times higher after accelerated durability tests in 0.5 m H2SO4 for oxygen reduction reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-7350			WOS:000749636900001

However, the development of CNx-based photoanodes for visible light-driven water oxidation to dioxygen is rather challenging, particularly due to issues related to photoelectrode stability and effective coupling of the light absorber with water oxidation catalysts. Herein, a triadic photoanode comprising a porous TiO2 electron collector scaffold sensitized by CNx coupled to a molecular cobalt polyoxometalate (CoPOM = [Co-4(H2O)(2)(PW9O34)(2)](10-)) catalyst is reported. Complete water oxidation to dioxygen under visible (lambda > 420 nm) light irradiation is demonstrated, with photocurrents down to relatively low bias potentials (0.2 V vs RHE). Furthermore, polyethyleneimine (PEI), a cationic polymer is shown to act as an effective and non-sacrificial electrostatic linker for immobilization of the anionic CoPOM onto the negatively charged surface of CNx. The optimized deposition of CoPOM using the PEI linker translates directly into improved efficiency of the transfer of photogenerated holes to water molecules and to enhanced oxygen evolution. This work thus provides important design rules for effective immobilization of POM-based catalysts into soft-matter photoelectrocatalytic architectures for light-driven water oxidation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2366-7486			WOS:000765827100001

Comparative chloroplast proteome analysis of exogenously supplied trehalose to wheat seedlings under heat stress								PHOTOSYNTHETICA				56	4			1123	1133		10.1007/s11099-018-0808-6				DEC 2018	2018	The aim of our study was to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of exogenously supplied trehalose affecting wheat photosynthesis under heat stress. The amount of ATP synthase (ATPase), oxygen-evolving enhancer protein (OEE), PsbP, Rubisco, chloroplast fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (FBPA), and ferredoxin-NADP(H) oxidoreductase (FNR) were downregulated, while PSI reaction center subunits were upregulated under heat stress. However, in the trehalose-pretreated groups, the amount of FNR, cytochrome b (6) f complex, PSI reaction center subunits, ATPase, FBPA, and Rubisco were upregulated under normal growth conditions and heat stress. Besides, during the recovery period, the upregulation in CAB, PsbP, OEE2, and ATPase suggested that trehalose pretreatment might help to the recovery of PSII and PSI. These results indicate that trehalose pretreatment effectively regulates the levels of the photosynthesis-related proteins and relieves the damage of heat stress to wheat chloroplast.									7	0	0	0	5	0	7			0300-3604	1573-9058		WOS:000444149800015

The method achieves a relatively high C conversion efficiency of similar to 41.9%. The final carbon materials are doped by N (similar to 3 at.%) and possess high surface area (similar to 1097 m(2) g (-1)) and abundant micropores. Compared to commercial Pt/C materials, the as-prepared carbon catalyst exhibits a comparable electrocatalytic activity and much better stability. Furthermore, the metal-free catalyst loaded Zn-air battery possesses higher discharge voltage and power density as compared with that of commercial Pt/C. This novel technique can also be readily applied to produce metal-free carbon catalysts from other typical waste biomass (e. g., orange peel, leaves) as the carbon sources. The method can be developed as a potentially general and effective industrial route to transform waste biomass into high value-added microporous carbon with superior functionalities.

Moreover, it is also disclosed that the electronic effect and strain effect within 2D nanostructures also benefit the further promotion of the electrocatalytic performance. In this review, we have focused on the recent progress in the fabrication of advanced electrocatalysts based on 2D noble-metal-based nanomaterials toward water splitting electrocatalysis. First, fundamental descriptions about water-splitting mechanisms, some promising engineering strategies, and major challenges in electrochemical water splitting are given. Then, the structural merits of 2D nanostructures for water splitting electrocatalysis are also highlighted, including abundant surface active sites, lattice distortion, abundant surface defects, electronic effects, and strain effects. Additionally, some representative water-splitting electrocatalysts have been discussed in detail to highlight the superiorities of 2D noble-metal-based nanomaterials for electrochemical water splitting. Finally, the underlying challenges and future opportunities for the fabrication of more advanced electrocatalysts for water splitting are also highlighted. We hope that this review article provides guidance for the fabrication of more efficient electrocatalysts for boosting industrial hydrogen production via water splitting.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000670729100001	34236371

The reaction of nanodroplets at the interface in miniemulsions is significantly affected by the concentration of dopants. The growth mechanism is both reaction- as well as diffusion-controlled, which finally determines the particular morphology. With a varying degree of dopant concentration and quantum confinement, the concentration of Ce3+ available on the surface of the nano-droplets and -particles is found to change quite appreciably. This immediately leads to modulation in the physical properties, such as ferromagnetism or absorption. The significant red shift in the absorption spectra and associated broadband visible photoluminescence opens newer applications for the present material in visible optoelectronic devices.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000393912900001	28084225

A novel approach to fabricate hierarchically porous carbon encapsulated with CoPx nanoparticles and wired with carbon nanotubes (NC@CoPx/PyCNTs) was developed. An optimal sample of the NC@CoPx/PyCNTs-900 material displayed excellent electrocatalytic performance for ORR with onset and half-wave potentials of similar to 0.92 V vs. RHE and 0.80 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M KOH, respectively, as well as a small Tafel slope of 85 mV/dec. It is noteworthy that the mass activity of NC@CoPx/PyCNTs was 9.8 times higher than commercial 20% Pt/C. In addition, NC@CoPx/PyCNTs exhibited remarkable long-term cycling stability and methanol tolerance, which were superior to commercially Pt/C catalyst. The interaction of the hierarchically porous carbon, CoPx nanoparticles, and carbon nanotubes in NC@CoPx/PyCNTs were observed. Moreover, good electron conductivity and high specific surface area also contributed to the enhanced ORR performance. This work is expected to open up new avenues for the rational design and development of low-cost and highly active ORR catalysts for energy technologies. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Such a model, called the gamma-process, is quite successful in reproducing the abundance pattern of many rare p-isotopes if one assumes that a distribution of near-solar seeds is exposed to the thermodynamic conditions that occur naturally in the neon-oxygen layers of massive stars (M > 10-12 M.) experiencing Type II supernova explosions. However, a failure of this model is the inability to reproduce the abundance pattern of the light p-isotopes 78Kr, Mo-92, Mo-94, Ru-96, and Ru-98 due to a lack of sufficient seeds with A greater-than-or-equal-to 96. We propose that the requisite thermodynamic conditions may also occur in Type Ia or certain subclasses of Type II supernovae, where a carbon-oxygen white dwarf explodes by deflagration or detonation. For such cases, the abundance pattern of all p-nuclei, including the light p-nuclei, is well reproduced. We also note the production of several possible p-isotope cosmochronometers Mn-53 (tau-1/2: 3.7 x 10(6) yr), Nb-92 (tau-1/2: 36. x 10(6) yr), Tc-97 (tau-1/2: 2.6 x 10(6) yr) and Sm-146 (tau-1/2: 103. x 10(6) yr).									135	1	0	0	0	0	135			0004-637X			WOS:A1991FK91800002

The enhanced performance of 3D GNRs over individual 2D GNRs is established using standard redox probes - [Ru(NH3)(6)](3+/2+), [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-) and important bio-analytes - dopamine and ascorbic acid. 3D GNRs are found to have high double layer capacitance (2482 mu F cm(-2)) and faster electron transfer kinetics; their exceptional electrocatalytic activity towards the oxygen reduction reaction is indicative of their potential over a wide range of electrochemical applications. Moreover, this study opens a new platform for the design of novel point-of-care devices and electrodes for energy devices.									25	0	0	0	3	0	25			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000352277500015	25712510

Pd and NiCo2O4 nanoparticles were uniformly distributed on the SiO2 support, so that every Pd or NiCo2O4 nanoparticle was separated from each other by another component. Comparing with Co3O4/SiO2, NiCo2O4/SiO2, Pd-Co3O4/SiO2 and Pd#NiCo2O4/SiO2 (catalysts without uniform distribution of Pd and NiCo2O4 nanoparticles), Pd-NiCo2O4/SiO2 had the highest catalytic activity in the catalytic combustion of lean methane, with a methane total conversion temperature at 378 degrees C. In addition, the high activity did not decrease during the long time reaction, which showed good thermal stability. TEM and BET results showed that the nanoparticle sizes of Pd and NiCo2O4 were very small. The XRD patterns indicated that the Pd nanoparticles were highly dispersed on the surface of SiO2. The XPS spectra demonstrated the formation of NiCO2O4, the presence of enough active oxygen species on the catalyst surface and the high ratio of PdO/Pd-0 . The enhanced influence of Ni introduction was also proved by comparison tests. All these results indicated that the high catalytic activity of Pd-NiCo2O4/SiO2 mainly comes from the nanoparticle distribution and the Ni cation enhancement. (C) 2017 Energy Institute.

Among these surfaces, (100) has not yet received ample attention. In this study, we investigated the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of Co3O4 (100) surface using density functional theory calculations. By considering both stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric surface structures of the two possible terminations, A and B. Besides the greater stability of the newly proposed stoichiometric models compared to nonstoichiometric models reported in previous studies, the results show that the B termination is energetically preferred over the entire range of oxygen chemical potentials. Unlike the bulk, Co3+ octahedral ions become magnetic at the surface, which leads to interesting surface magnetic properties. Density of states (DOS) indicate a small band gap of 1.15 eV for the B-stoichiometric model, due to the presence of surface states in the bulk band gap. More polar surface with a very narrow band gap is found in the A-nonstoichiometric model. These surface states may play an important role in the magnetism and metallicity observed experimentally in several Co3O4 systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Nocera, Daniel G.								The Artificial Leaf								ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH				45	5			767	776		10.1021/ar2003013				MAY 2012	2012	To convert the energy of sunlight into chemical energy, the leaf splits water via the photosynthetic process to produce molecular oxygen and hydrogen, which is in a form of separated protons and electrons. The primary steps of natural photosynthesis involve the absorption of sunlight and its conversion into spatially separated electron hole pairs. The holes of this wireless current are captured by the oxygen evolving complex (OK) of photosystem II (13511) to oxidize water to oxygen. The electrons and protons produced as a byproduct of the OEC reaction are captured by ferrodoxin of photosystem I. With the aid of ferrodoxin NADP(+) reductase, they are used to produce hydrogen in the form of NADPH. For a synthetic material to realize the solar energy conversion function of the leaf, the light-absorbing material must capture a solar photon to generate a wireless current that is harnessed by catalysts, which drive the four electron/hole fuel-forming water-splitting reaction under benign conditions and under 1 sun (100 mW/cm(2)) illumination.This Account describes the construction of an artificial leaf comprising earth-abundant elements by interfacing a triple junction, amorphous silicon photovoltaic with hydrogen- and oxygen-evolving catalysts made from a ternary alloy (NiMoZn) and a cobalt phosphate cluster (Co-OEC), respectively. The latter captures the structural and functional attributes of the PSII-OEC. Similar to the PSII-OEC, the Co-OEC self-assembles upon oxidation of an earth-abundant metal ion from 2+ to 3+, may operate in natural water at room temperature, and is self-healing. The Co-OEC also activates H2O by a proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism in which the Co-OEC is increased by four hole equivalents akin to the S-state pumping of the Kok cycle of PSII. X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies have established that the Co-OEC is a structural relative of Mn3CaO4-Mn urbane of the PSII-OEC, where Co replaces Mn and the cubane is extended in a corner-sharing, head-to-tail dimer.The ability to perform the oxygen-evolving reaction in water at neutral or near-neutral conditions has several consequences for the construction of the artificial leaf. The NiMoZn alloy may be used in place of Pt to generate hydrogen. To stabilize silicon in water, its surface is coated with a conducting metal oxide onto which the Co-OEC may be deposited. The net result is that immersing a triple-junction Si wafer coated with NiMoZn and Co-OEC in water and holding it up to sunlight can effect direct solar energy conversion via water splitting. By constructing a simple, stand-alone device composed of earth-abundant materials, the artificial leaf provides a means for an inexpensive and highly distributed solar-to-fuels system that employs low-cost systems engineering and manufacturing. Through this type of system, solar energy can become a viable energy supply to those in the non-legacy world.									1297	38	0	0	148	2	1313			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000303965300009	22475039

The aim of our study was to investigate the latest hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwaters in the crystalline bedrock at Olkiluoto, which is the planned site for deep geological disposal of spent nuclear fuel. Samples were collected from drill cores intercepting water-conducting fractures at the upper 500m of the bedrock. The latest fracture calcite generations were identified using optical microscopy and electron microprobe. They occur as thin 10-200 m crusts or small euhedral crystals on open fracture surfaces. These latest calcite fillings were carefully sampled and analysed for the isotopic composition on carbon and oxygen. In addition, fluid inclusion homogenisation temperatures were determined on selected calcite samples. Fluid inclusion data indicated a low temperature of formation for the latest fracture calcite fillings. The 18O values of calcite in these fracture fillings vary only slightly, from-7.3 to-11.5 parts per thousand (Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite, VPDB), whereas the 13C values fluctuate widely, from-30 to+31 parts per thousand (VPDB). The 13C values of latest calcite fillings show a systematic pattern with depth, with high and variable 13C values below 50m. The high 13C values indicate active methanogenesis during the formation of the latest calcite fillings. In contrast, the present-day methanic redox environment is restricted to depths below 200-300m. It is possible that the shift in the redox environment at Olkiluoto has occurred during infiltration of [image omitted]-rich marine waters, the latest of such events being the infiltration of brackish waters of the Littorina Sea stage of the Baltic Sea at 8000-3000 BP.									15	0	0	0	3	0	15			1025-6016			WOS:000281851900010	20665300

The pyrolysis process of biomass is complicated, which is generally considered to consist of the pyrolysis of the three major components (i.e., cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin). Understanding the pyrolysis behavior and product of each component holds a key to understanding the biomass pyrolysis mechanism. In this work, the pyrolysis behavior, pyrolysis kinetics, volatile evolution, and product characterization of the three major components are investigated. Results showed that pyrolysis characteristics and thermal stability of the three components were closely related to their unique chemical structures. During pyrolysis, the main pyrolytic volatiles of hemicellulose appeared first, followed by cellulose and then lignin volatiles in the 3D FTIR spectra. In term of pyrolysis products, gases were generated by the cracking of specific functional groups. Hemicellulose had the highest CO 2 yield, whereas lignin had the highest CH 4 yield due to the aromatic rings and methoxy groups in lignin structure. Whereas cellulose demonstrated the highest CO yield at high temperatures (above 550 degrees C). With increasing temperature, the carbon structures of carboxylic-C and O-alkyl-C in biochar decreased, while aryl-C was enhanced. This was due to the deoxygenation reactions such as dehydroxylation, decarboxylation, decarbonylation, and demethoxylation, resulting in a reduction in the number of oxygen-containing functional groups (such as -OH, -C = O, -COOH, and -OCH 3 ), as well as the polycondensation reactions that formed more polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon units during pyrolysis. The major components of cellulose bio-oil included anhydrosugars and furans. Whereas the bio-oils derived from hemicellulose and lignin showed the highest relative content of acids and phenols, respectively. Based on this analysis, the thermal decomposition pathways of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin were proposed. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

Halsey, Lewis/B-8498-2011	Halsey, Lewis/0000-0002-0786-7585			The relationship between energy expenditure and speed during pedestrian locomotion in birds: A morphological basis for the elevated y-intercept?								COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR & INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY				165	2			295	298		10.1016/j.cbpa.2013.03.027				JUN 2013	2013	The slope of the typically linear relationship between metabolic rate and walking speed represents the net cost of transport (NCOT). The extrapolated y-intercept is often greater than resting metabolic rate, thus representing a fixed cost associated with pedestrian transport including body maintenance costs. The full cause of the elevated y-intercept remains elusive and it could simply represent experimental stresses. The present literature-based study compares the mass-independent energetic cost of pedestrian locomotion in birds (excluding those with an upright posture, i.e. penguins), represented by the y-intercept, to a known predictor of cost of transport, hip height. Both phylogenetically informed and non-phylogenetically informed analyses were undertaken to determine if patterns of association between hip height, body mass, and the y-intercept are robust with respect to the method of analysis. Body mass and hip height were significant predictors of the y-intercept in the best phylogenetically-informed and non-phylogenetically informed models. Thus there is evidence that, in birds at least, the elevated y-intercept is a legitimate component of locomotion energy expenditure. Hip height is probably a good proxy of effective limb length and thus perhaps birds with greater hip heights have lower y-intercepts because their longer legs more efficiently accommodate body motion and/or because their limbs are more aligned with the ground reaction forces.

The results revealed a strong influence of the nominal cerium concentration, [CeO2](N), on t(6V), showing substitution of Ti by Ce causes a major decrease in t(6V). The degree of electrode instability, A, calculated from the slope of the linear segment present in the chronopotentiometric profiles, showed [CeO2](N) exerts a strong influence on A. Voltammetric curves recorded at several anodisation times, t, support final electrode deactivation is due to Ti-support passivation. The chronopotentiometric and voltammetric data permitted to present a model for the porous electrode/electrolyte interface. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopic, EIS, investigation as function of t supports the proposed model denouncing a fast growth a TiO2 interlayer at the Ti-o/oxide interface for [CeO2](N) greater than or equal to 30 mol%. The studies also support substitution of Ti by Ce leads to an increase in the coating porosity, thus favouring electrode deactivation by passivation of the Ti-substrate. The model proposed for the porous electrode/electrolyte interface combined with the results of the EIS investigation permitted to propose an equivalent circuit to describe the modifications occurring in the electrode structure during anodisation. The true electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction, OER, depends on t and [CeO2](N). The dependency of the inductive behaviour on t was investigated according to the model proposed for the effective inductance, L-E, in the high frequency domain. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The exotic electronic states of the low-dimensional materials which arise from the quantum-confinement effects of electrons render a potential strategy to overcome the size-limitation of traditional semiconducting materials and continue the Moores' law which is difficult for the conventional bulk materials. The electronic structure modulation of low-dimensional materials to meet the relevant requirements serves as the key to reach this goal. Notably, in low-dimensional materials, the defect effects are more remarkable than those in bulk materials due to the high specific surface area and quantum confinement effects. Moreover, the compatibility of low-dimensional materials to nanoscaled devices is crucial for the next-generation device applications. Here, we focus on the role of defects in electronic structure modulation of one- (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) materials to summarize works of our group relevant to this topic in recent years. The point defects, such as vacancies and adatoms (or functional groups) are revealed to have significant contribution to the electron spin-polarization and excited states. The ferromagnetism of the metal-free materials is demonstrated in wide range of materials, such as graphite, hexagonal boron nitride and silicon carbide both theoretically and experimentally. The spinpolarization of p electrons in these materials enriches the family of ferromagnetic materials and offers a promising strategy for spintronics device applications. The hollow structure of carbon nanotubes provides an ideal platform for the study of atomic reaction, diffusion and condensation processes confined in nanospace. The electronic band structures of carbon nanotubes can be effectively regulated by encapsulating metal or hydrogen nanowires. Ultrahigh density of hydrogen nanowires can be confined inside carbon nanotubes, thanks to the excellent mechanical properties, which lead to metallization or superconductivity of the 1D hydrogen systems at relative low pressure and high temperature, due to the "physical compression" effect of carbon nanotubes. The superconducting hydrogen can be well explained in terms of the Eliashberg superconductivity theory for electron-phonon strong-coupling system. The metallization and superconducting phase of hydrogen nanowires encapsulated in carbon nanotubes open a promising platform for study of low-dimensional superconductivity at high pressure. Additionally, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) which are composed of transition metal (TM) atoms and organic ligands emerged as a new family of 2D materials. Compared with traditional 2D materials, MOFs have the advantages of structural diversity, porous configurations. tunable electronic band structures. Some lattice models, such as Kagome. Lieb and Ruby lattice models can be achieved in 2D MOFs. The synergistic effect of TM atoms and organic ligands leads to exotic properties, such as Kane fermions, topological electronic states (quantum spin Hall effects and quantum anomalous Hall effect), superconductivity, high catalytic activity, etc. The well-distributed TM atoms in the porous structures of 2D MOFs facilitate the catalysis in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which hold great promise in water splitting and fuel cells.In view of the experimental progresses on the synthesis of diverse 2D MOFs. the fascinating properties of 2D MOFs bring about new concepts for electronic devices and catalysis design.									1	1	0	0	0	0	1			0023-074X	2095-9419		WOS:000663791800007

OAPs were modified with noble metals (Au, Ag, Cu and Pt) by two photodeposition methods: in the absence and in the initial presence of oxygen in the system. Photocatalytic activities for oxidative decomposition of acetic acid and anaerobic dehydrogenation of methanol under UV/vis irradiation and for oxidation of 2-propanol under visible light irradiation were investigated. Antibacterial activities for bacteria (Escherichia coli) and fungi (Candida albicans) were investigated in the dark and under UV irradiation and/or visible light irradiation. It was found that the kind of metal deposition significantly influenced the properties of photocatalysts obtained and thus their photocatalytic and antimicrobial activities. Modification of OAPs with metallic deposits resulted in enhanced photocatalytic activities for all tested systems. Pt-modified OAPs showed the highest activity for dehydrogenation of methanol due to their highest work function and lowest activation overpotential of hydrogen evolution. Cu-modified OAPs exhibited the highest activity for oxidative decomposition of acetic acid under UV/vis irradiation, probably due to the heterojunction between Cu oxides and TiO2. On the other hand, Au-modified OAPs showed the highest photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation due to their plasmonic properties. Bare OAPs, prepared with various durations of the HT reaction, did not have any antibacterial properties in the dark, while their activity under UV/vis irradiation was correlated with their photocatalytic activities for dehydrogenation of methanol and decomposition of acetic acid. Antimicrobial activity of modified OAPs in the dark and under visible light irradiation was the highest for Ag-modified OAPs. Under UV irradiation, Cu-modified OAPs showed the highest activity for inactivation of both bacteria and fungi. (C) 2016 The Authors.

By varying the calcination temperature, we prepared RNiO3 powders with different degrees of chemical reaction. We found that perovskite RNiO3 becomes predominant after high-temperature calcination (>= 1,000 degrees C) in X-ray diffraction and XPS (at Ni 3p and O 1s edges) measurements. While the observed spectra at the Ni 3p edge are similar for all powders, a sizable difference was observed in the O 1s-edge spectra depending on the calcination temperature. With the formation of a perovskite phase with a trivalent Ni3+ state, an XPS peak corresponding to oxygen ions in the perovskite lattice distinctly emerges. Our work shows that the Ni3+ state cannot be determined by analyzing the Ni3+ edge solely and rather, the O is edge should be simultaneously monitored for explicit identification.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1567-1739	1878-1675		WOS:000496996300017

Marun brines are characterized by having higher concentrations of calcium (11 000-20 000 mg/L), chlorine (120 000-160 000 mg/L) and bromide (600-1000 mg/L) compared to modern seawater. Samples are also enriched in O-18 relative to seawater, fall to the right of the Global Meteoric Water Line and local rain water, and plot close to the halite brine trajectory on the delta D versus delta O-18 diagram. Geochemical characteristics of Marun brines are inconsistent with a meteoric origin, but instead correspond to residual evaporated seawater modified by water rock interaction, most significantly dolomitization. In addition, anhydrite precipitation or sulphate reduction appears to be important in chemical modification of the Martin brines, as indicated by lower sulphate contents relative to evaporated seawater. Extensive dolomitization, the presence of anhydrite nodules and hid salinity fluid inclusions in the upper parts of the Asmari Formation fit a model whereby the Marun brines likely originated from the seepage reflux of concentrated seawater during the deposition of the overlying Gachsaran Formation evaporites in the Miocene.

Supersonic flow onto a gravitating center, known as Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion, is a natural shock wave creating process, but, to our knowledge, a reactive medium has never been considered in the literature. Here, we conduct an order of magnitude analysis to investigate under which conditions the shock-induced reaction zone recouples to the shock front. We derive three semianalytical criteria for self-sustained detonation ignition. We apply these criteria to the special situation where a primordial black hole (PBH) of asteroid mass traverses a carbon-oxygen white dwarf (WD). Since detonations in carbon-oxygen WDs are supposed to produce normal thermonuclear supernovae (SNe Ia), the observed SN Ia rate constrains the fraction of dark matter (DM) in the form of PBHs as log(10) (f(PBH)) < 0.8 log(10) (M-BH/3 x 10(22)g) in the range 10(21)-10(22) g (10(20)-10(22) g) from a conservative (optimistic) analysis. Most importantly, these encounters can account for both the rate and the median explosion mass of normal sub-Chandrasekhar SNe Ia if a significant fraction of DM is in the form of PBHs with mass 10(23) g.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0031-9007	1079-7114		WOS:000669052000004	34270288

In this research, Bi2O3/BiFeO3 heterojunction nanofibers with rich oxygen vacancies were successfully synthesized via the in-situ growth of Bi2O3 nanosheets on the surface of BiFeO3 nanofibers, and were then reduced in N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) via the solvothermal method for different times. The composite ratios and oxygen vacancy concentrations were then systematically optimized. The optimal composite with the molar ratio of BiFeO3:Bi2O3 = 1:1 and solvothermally reducted in DMF for 3 h was found to completely degrade the tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) solution within 120 min, and its photodegradation rate was 8.7 and 5.4 times higher than those of pure BiFeO3 and Bi2O3, respectively. The enhancement can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of the p-n heterojunction formed at the interface and oxygen vacancies produced on the surface, which significantly increased the absorption of visible light, inhibited the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, and accelerated the separation and transfer of photogenerated charges. Moreover, the obtained oxygen vacancy-enriched Bi2O3/BiFeO3 heterojunction nanofibers exhibited good cyclic stability and magnetic separation capability, and therefore have potential applications in practical sewage treatment.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000663752000004

The structure evolution of FeVO4 was studied by using XRD, UV-vis, PL, FTIR, XPS, SEM, EDX, TEM, EIS, Raman and BET surface area techniques. XRD analysis showed that crystal structure and phase formation of FeVO4 to depend on V-metal loadings, and that the various Fe:V ratio showed peaks shifting, which were related to the transformation of Fe2O3 and V2O5 interface into FeVO4 phase with respect to increasing V-metal loadings. The XPS results showed the significant influence of the V-metal loadings on inducing various electronic, redox oxidation states of V3+/V4+/V5+ and Fe2+/Fe3+ and oxygen vacancy defects structure properties of FeVO(4 )catalysts. The physical structure changes confirmed by XRD, XPS and FTIR manifested the tailoring of the optical properties as evidenced by PL and UV-vis with FeV-3 catalyst showing the desirable optics properties. This were determined to give the properties for the efficient photodegradation activity of methylene blue model organic dye of wastewater with its near complete removal with 30 min reaction time. The enhanced productivity photodegradation performance of the hetero-mixed FeVO4 catalysts is ascribed to their enriched visible-light harvesting range and efficient suppression of electrons/holes (e(-)/h(+)) recombination manifested by the effect of Fe:V composition ratio. Moreover, the presence of small quantity of Fe2O3 in predominant FeVO4 could allow efficient e(-)/h(+) separation and transfer by creation of Fe2O3/FeVO4 heterojunction interface. The FeVO4 catalyst showed excellent recyclability and its stable photoactivity under aqueous degradation conditions.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000722892100002

However, traditional synthetic methods trade off durability for the high activity of PGM-based catalysts. Herein, a novel dynamic CO2-bubble template (DCBT) approach was established to electrochemically fine-tuning the exposed Pt active sites in PtFeNi (PFN) porous films (PFs). Particularly, CO2 bubbles were intentionally generated as gas-phase templates by methanol electrooxidation. The generation, adsorption, residing, and desorption of CO2 bubbles on the surface of PFN alloys were explored and controlled by adjusting the frequency of applied triangular-wave voltage. Thereby, the surface morphology and Pt exposure of PFN PFs were controllably regulated by tuning the surface coverage of CO2 bubbles. Consequently, the Pt1.1%Fe8.8%Ni PF with homogeneous nanoporous structure and sufficiently exposed Pt active sites was obtained, showing preeminent activities with a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.87 V and onset overpotential (eta(onset)) of 288 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER), respectively, at an ultralow Pt loading of 0.01 mg cm(-2). When tested in ZABs, a high power density of 175.0 mW cm(-2) and a narrow voltage gap of 0.64 V were achieved for the long cycling tests over 500 h (750 cycles), indicating that the proposed approach can efficiently improve the activity of PGM catalysts by fine-tuning the microstructure without compromising the durability.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000684586600032	34269572

Moreover, controversies remain in the unambiguous identification of active sites in nitrogen-doped carbons for persulfate activation. Here we report the facile synthesis of nitrogen-doped carbon material via one-step pyrolysis of urea and D-mannitol, which simultaneously combine ultrahigh nitrogen content (up to 33.75 at%) with apparent porous structure via transformation from graphitic carbon nitride. With this strategy, the highly nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NC1.0) exhibits excellent catalytic activity toward peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation for oxidation of organic pollutants. Both experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, for the first time, revealed that the electron-rich graphitic N and electron-deficient carbon atom adjacent to graphitic N in NC1.0, served as active sites for PMS reduction and oxidation toward the generation of hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)), respectively, in which PMS oxidation was the main reaction in the course of PMS activation rendering O-1(2) the dominant reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the NC1.0/PMS system. More importantly, NC1.0 presents robust stability in PMS activation, superior to most reported nitrogen-doped carbon-based catalysts, offering great promise for practical environmental remediation.									54	1	0	0	27	0	55			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000532829200002	32120204

The WO3 particulate film calcined at 650 degrees C showed high PEC performance for water oxidation to evolve O-2. In linear sweep voltammetry, the photocurrent density proportionally increased with incident light intensity (I-0). This means that the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of Ti/WO3 was not dependent on I-0 in voltammetry. In contrast, there was no proportional relation between I-0 and the photocurrent density in chronoamperometry at a constant potential, indicating that the IPCE at steady state decreased with an increase of I-0. To elucidate the effect of light intensity on the steady-state IPCE, we investigated the IMPS response of Ti/WO3 photoanodes by applying a simple branching model with respect to the photogenerated holes (h(+)). It was found that the recombination rate constant (k(rec)) rather than the charge transfer rate constant (k(ct)) significantly depends on I-0 at the steady-state condition. The pseudo-first-other k(r)(ec) increased with an increase of I-0, suggesting that recombination is increased by the accumulation of photogenerated carriers during continuous PEC water oxidation. This is the reason for the decrease in the steadystate IPCE of Ti/WO3 under high-intensity light irradiation. The effects of applied potentials on the kinetic parameters (k(ct) and k(rec) were also evaluated for Ti/WO3 under different I-0. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

We find that when within a particular compositional range, the fresh nanoalloys may exhibit high catalytic activity for low-temperature CO oxidation. Using surface-specific atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) extracted from the in situ total X-ray scattering data, we find that, regardless of their chemical composition and initial catalytic activity, the fresh nanoalloys suffer a significant surface structural disorder during CO oxidation. Upon reactivation in oxygen atmosphere, the surface of used nanoalloy catalysts both partially oxidizes and orders. Remarkably, it largely retains its structural state when the nanoalloys are reused as CO oxidation catalysts. The seemingly inverse structural changes of studied nanoalloy catalysts occurring under CO oxidation and reactivation conditions affect the active sites on their surface significantly. In particular, through different mechanisms, both appear to reduce the CO binding strength to the nanoalloy's surface and thus increase the catalytic stability of the nanoalloys. The findings provide clues for further optimization of nanoalloy catalysts for the oxidation of carbonaceous species through optimizing their composition, activation, and reactivation. Besides, the findings demonstrate the usefulness of combined in situ infrared spectroscopy and total X-ray scattering coupled to surface-specific atomic PDF analysis to the ongoing effort to produce advanced catalysts for environmentally and technologically important applications.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000429625400030	29533583

In contemporary aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, the dominating groups are the oxygen evolving cyanobacteria, algae, and higher plants. Anoxygenic phototrophic microorganisms occupy mainly ecological niches with extreme environmental conditions. Despite diverse evolution of all these taxonomic groups, their photosynthetic apparatus has a similar molecular design and identical principles of operation. This review covers recent data about features of the structural and functional organization of pigment-protein complexes of the basic types of photosynthetic units in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

To address these problems, THERMOX, a two-dimensional (2-D) finite element program, was developed. THERMOX simulates physical and geochemical processes in waste rock with variable sulfide content and water saturation. The program includes pyrite oxidation kinetics, equilibrium precipitation and dissolution reactions, heat transfer by conduction and convection, and oxygen transport by diffusion and convection. The program was applied to data from a waste rock pile at the Doyon Mine site in Quebec, Canada. Simulations were performed for two end-member scenarios: a nonconvective mode with diffusion as the only oxygen transport process, and a convective mode with both diffusion and convection as oxygen transport processes. Simulations confirmed previous findings from the Doyon Mine site about the development of high temperatures and high pore-water concentrations close to the slope of a highly permeable waste rock pile with high pyrite content, linked to rapid oxygen convection. When only diffusion of oxygen was considered, the rate of pyrite oxidation was lower and the oxidation front was relatively continuous, with lower maximum dissolved species concentrations close to the slope. Calculated temperatures compared well with the Doyon Mine field data. The match for pH was reasonable, while calculated sulfate concentrations were lower. This can be explained by the high friability of the sericite schist rock at the site, which accelerates the pyrite oxidation rate, and temporal changes In recharge (most recharge occurs during spring snow melt). The program can be used for predicting various remediation scenarios (e.g., change in the slope of a rock pile or the use of an impermeable cover). Kinetically constrained dissolution of silicates should be included to simulate conditions during late stages of neutralization.									13	0	0	0	6	0	13				1539-1663		WOS:000271936900021

Herein, we investigated typical tetrahedral and octahedral cobalt ions in CoAl2O4 and ZnCo2O4 via an inactive cation substitution strategy towards spinel Co3O4. ZnCo2O4 (0.095 min(-1)) performs remarkably better than CoAl2O4 (0.007 min(-1)) for degrading rhodamine B, while non-radical O-1(2) is the dominant reactive oxygen species. Then, interface kinetics characterized by systemic electrochemical techniques indicate the feasibility of Co2+/Co3+ transformation and charge transfer resistance at catalyst-electrolyte interface determine intrinsic activity. Octahedral cobalt species exhibit superior intrinsic activities comparing with tetrahedral ones on the removal of several dye and aromatic pollutants. Additionally, flat band potentials of cobalt-based oxides reflecting Fermi level positions is a thermodynamic factor to activate PMS. Our work attempts to further understand spatial occupation-activity relationship of cobalt sites to design efficient PMS activators.									25	0	0	0	11	0	25			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000663271600001

The results showed that the trends of thermogravimetric pyrolysis and oxidation curves were divided into three stages and five stages, respectively, and presented the same variations. As the heating rate increased, their curves moved the high temperature. In addition, the characteristic temperatures indicated that the coal samples had a relatively significant spontaneous combustion tendency. In the stage of water evaporation and gas desorption, the rates of formation of CO and CO2 went up promptly, and gaseous water produced during the oxidation reaction began to increase, but its generation rate was lower than that in the stage of oxygen absorption and mass increase. The apparent activation energy (E-a) showed a characteristic jump with increasing temperature, and the optimal mechanism function was chosen by integration and differentiation. Moreover, the relationship between E-a and lnA was linear, which indicated that there was a kinetic compensation effect.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1388-6150	1588-2926		WOS:000604537200015

The turnover frequencies were 0, 1700, and 5500 mol H-2/mol PS/h for O, S, and Se derivatives, respectively (Phi(H2) = 0%, 12.2%, and 32.8%, respectively), which correlates well with relative triplet yields estimated from quantum yields for singlet oxygen generation. Phosphorescence from the excited PS was quenched by the sacrificial electron donor. Fluorescence lifetimes were similar for the O- and S-containing rhodamines (similar to 2.6 ns) and shorter for the Se analog (similar to 0.1 ns). These data suggest a reaction pathway involving reductive quenching of the triplet excited state of the PS giving the reduced PS- that then transfers an electron to the Co catalyst. The longer-lived triplet state is necessary for effective bimolecular electron transfer. While the cobalt/rhodamine/triethanolamine system gives unprecedented yields of hydrogen for the photoreduction of water, mechanistic insights regarding the overall reaction pathway as well as system degradation offer significant guidance to developing even more stable and efficient photocatalytic systems.									284	9	0	0	32	1	286			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000283955600008	20945839

In this study, we use in situ ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy with "tender" X-rays (4.0 keV) to investigate a polycrystalline bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) electrode in contact with an aqueous potassium phosphate (KPi) solution at open circuit potential under both dark and light conditions. This is facilitated by the creation of a 25 to 30 nm thick electrolyte layer using the "dip-and-pull" method. We observe that under illumination bismuth phosphate forms on the BiVO4 surface leading to an increase of the surface negative charge. The bismuth phosphate layer may act to passivate surface states observed in photoelectrochemical measurements. The repulsive interaction between the negatively charged surface under illumination and the phosphate ions in solution causes a shift in the distribution of ions in the thin aqueous electrolyte film, which is observed as an increase in their photoelectron signals. Interestingly, we find that such changes at the BiVO4/KPi electrolyte interface are reversible upon returning to dark conditions. By measuring the oxygen is photoelectron peak intensities from the phosphate ions and liquid water as a function of time under dark and light conditions, we determine the time scales for the forward and reverse reactions. Our results provide direct evidence for light-induced chemical modification of the BiVO4/KPi electrolyte interface.									24	0	0	0	1	0	24			1520-6106			WOS:000423140600050	28853574

Typical processes were studied by potentiodynamic cathodic polarization and galvanostatic polarization and typical samples were analyzed by SEM and XRD. The results indicate that the depositing effciency is not only the highest but stablest, and deposited coatings show the best uniformity with Mg(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O solution employed as depositing medium and applied current density >= 1.0mA cm(-2). Cathodic deposition leads to regular mass loss of Mg substrate. The cathodic polarization curve of pure Mg in magnesium nitrate solution shows more obvious pseudo-passivation, several Tafel regions with different slopes appearing before diffusion-limited current density region, and oxygen consumption is the major cathodic reduction reaction under specified current density. However, hydrogen evolution reaction is dominant in both Mg chloride and Mg sulfate solutions. The deposition coatings are all composed of continuous and uniform mesh-like "basic layer" adjacent to substrate and discrete distributed snowball-like particles on the microscopic scale. The phase compositions are all crystal Mg(OH)(2), and the coatings deposited in Mg chloride solution have (011) preferred orientation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0218-625X	1793-6667		WOS:000414965600010

However, particle loading and size are inversely proportional. Surfactant-assisted melt-infiltration (SAMI) may alleviate this problem. In this study, various solid surfactants (Span60, SDBS, and CTAB) were homogeneously mixed with nickel nitrate and mesoporous silica support (SBA-15) under non-solvent conditions during melt-infiltration. The non-ionic surfactant (Span60) afforded a high loading (40 wt%) of nanoscale (11 nm) nickel particles and generated a large number of interfaces between the nickel particles and the support. These interfaces may contain oxygen vacancies that facilitate the adsorption-dissociation of CO2 on the catalyst surface. The Span60/40Ni/as-syn-SBA-15 catalyst exhibited the highest catalytic activity with CO2 conversion of 78 % and CH4 selectivity of 99 % at a temperature of 350 degrees C (Space Velocity: 120,000 mL/g(cat)center dot h). The nanoscale size of the catalyst improved the catalytic performance by ensuring a simple and efficient reaction pathway. The SAMI method generates no liquid waste and may be commercialized to produce efficient catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000779429700003

This work aims to deepen the understanding and initiate a rational molecular tuning of ILs for improved activity and stability. To this end, Pt/C catalysts were modified using a variety of 1-methyl-3-alkylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([C(n)C(1)im][NTf2], n = 2-10) ILs with varying alkyl chain lengths in imidazolium cations, and the electrocatalytic properties (e.g., electrochemically active surface area, catalytic activity, and stability) of the resultant catalysts were systematically investigated. We found that ILs with long cationic chains (C6, C10) efficiently suppressed the formation of nonreactive oxygenated species on Pt; however, at the same time they blocked active Pt sites and led to a lower electrochemically active surface area. It is also disclosed that the catalytic activity strongly correlates with the alkyl chain length of cations, and a distinct dependence of intrinsic activity on the alkyl chain length was identified, with the maximum activity obtained on Pt/C-[C(4)C(1)im][NTf2]. The optimum arises from the counterbalance between more efficient suppression of oxygenated species formation on Pt surfaces and more severe passivation of Pt surfaces with elongation of the alkyl chain length in imidazolium cations. Moreover, the presence of an IL can also improve the electrochemical stability of Pt catalysts by suppressing the Pt dissolution, as revealed by combined identical-location transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and in situ inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analyses.									54	2	0	0	1	0	54			2155-5435			WOS:000444364800053	30221028

The change in surface charge at different pH values was detected by zeta potential measurement, and the evolution of oxygen-containing functional groups attached to the RGOs was analysed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy. Results showed that the edge phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups made more contributions to the negative surface charge compared with the basal-plane hydroxyl and epoxy groups. Electrical impedance spectroscopy results proved that the surface charge of RGOs significantly affected their electrochemical properties. Furthermore, GO and RGOs (graphene oxide materials) were also used to construct electrochemical sensors for quantitive measurement of Cu2+ by differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry. The results revealed that the increase in negative surface charge on RGO enhanced its electrocatalytic activity for Cu2+ reduction. Thus, considering that studies on the properties of graphene oxide materials can be simplified by the surface charge, its analysis is an important means of material characterisation.

J	Halaoui, Lara								Photoelectrochemical Investigation of the Mechanism of Enhancement of Water Oxidation at the Hematite Nanorod Array Modified with "NiBi"								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				120	40			22766	22776		10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b04430				OCT 13 2016	2016	Modifying the surface of a hematite photoanode with NiBi or CoPi oxygen evolution catalysts has been reported to reduce the bias required for photooxidation of water, but the mechanism remains a subject of discussion. In this work, the effect of photochemically modifying an array of hematite nanorods in Ni2+ solution in potassium borate (or NiBi) on water oxidation was studied using cyclic voltammetry in the dark and in the light and with photocurrent transient measurements. A prominent reduction of a photooxidized species is reported here on the reverse scans of cyclic voltammograms under illumination near the photocurrent onset, coinciding with the cathodic shift in water oxidation potential, showing transfer of the hole in a long-lived oxidized state at NiBi-hematite. The reduction peak was still observed at slow scan rate indicating a stable photooxidized state with slow back electron reaction. A reduction was similarly detected albeit with lower magnitude in the dark when the modified electrode was biased to high anodic potential into the water oxidation region. Photocurrent transients revealed slow decay with a median lifetime of ca. 1-3 s at low bias at NiBi-hematite and a slower decay relative to the bare electrode biased 0.6 V more positive. The results are explained by proposing that photogenerated hole transfer occurs to a state at Ni-oxide-modified hematite, forming a photooxidized species where the photohole is sufficiently long lived, with reduced recombination rate allowing water oxidation to occur at low bias. Electrochemical evidence points to this being the same oxidized state formed in the dark at water oxidation potentials at NiBi-hematite, but the chemical identity of the photooxidized state involved in water oxidation is yet to be determined.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1932-7447			WOS:000385607000002

In this work, we have aimed to improve the catalytic activity of cobalt selenides by growing them over the self-supported Co3O4 microrods. Initially, Co3O4 microrods were synthesized through annealing of an as-prepared cobalt oxalate precursor. The subsequent selenization ofCo(3)O(4) resulted in the formation of a grainy rodlike Co3O4/Co0.85Se/Co9Se8 network The structural and morphological analysis reveals the presence of Co3O4 even after the selenization treatment where the cobalt selenide nanograins are randomly covered over the Co3O4 support. The resultant electrode shows superior electrocatalytic activity toward OER in alkaline medium by delivering a benchmark current density of 10 mA/cm(2) geo at an overpotential of 330 mV. As a comparison, we have developed Co0.85Se/Co9Se8 under similar conditions and evaluated its OER activity. This material consumes an overpotential of 360 mV to deliver the benchmark current density, which signifies the role of the Co3O4 support to improve the electrocatalytic activity of Co0.85Se/Co9Se8. Despite having a low TOF value for Co3O4/Co0.85Se/Co9Se8 (0.0076 s(-1)) compared to Co0.85Se/Co9Se8 (0.0102 s(-1)), the improved catalytic activity of Co3O4/Co0.85Se/Co9Se8 is attributed to the presence of a higher number of active sites rather than the improved per site activity. This is further supported from the C-dl (double layer capacitance) measurements where Co3O4/Co0.85Se/Co9Se8 and Co0.85Se/Co9Se8 tender C-dl values of about 8.19 and 1.08 mF/cm(2), respectively, after electrochemical precondition. As-prepared Co3O4/Co0.85Se/Co9Se8 also manifests rapid kinetics (low Tafel slope similar to 91 mV/dec), long-term stability, low charge-transfer resistance, and 82% Faradaic efficiency for alkaline electrocatalysis (pH = 14). Furthermore, the proton reaction order (pRHE) is found to be 0.65, indicating a proton decoupled electron transfer (PDET) mechanism for alkaline OER. Thus, the Co3O4 support helps in the exposure of more catalytic sites of Co0.85Se/Co9Se8 to deliver the improved catalytic activities in alkaline medium.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000599190300062	33213153

The effect of methanol addition into water was estimated in the photocatalytic water splitting. Photocatalytic activity of perovskite was also assessed in the photocatalytic water splitting. H-2 was evolved in the photocatalytic splitting of water by reacting of active species. The photocatalytic activity for H-2 generation of TiO2 prepared by sol-gel method was higher than that of commercial TiO(2)photocatalyst. The rate of H-2 evolution was progressed with Ag loading on TiO(2)photocatalysts. The addition of methanol into water brought to a significant enhancement of H-2 evolution. The methanol acted as an electron donor to increase the amount of H-2 production. Copyright (C) 2018 The Authors.

However, using only a single semiconductor as a photocatalyst remains a great challenge. Designing Z-scheme systems is the most common method used for photocatalysis. We report a Z-scheme Co3(PO4)2/alpha-Fe2O3 structure as an efficient photocatalyst for overall water splitting under visible light. The as-prepared Co3(PO4)2/alpha-Fe2O3 photocatalyst shows excellent improvement in visible light absorption and photocatalytic efficiency for overall water splitting, in which Co3(PO4)2 and Fe2O3 act as H2-evolving and O2-evolving photocatalysts, respectively. By varying the amount of alpha-Fe2O3 in the photocatalysts, we found that Co3(PO4)2/alpha-Fe2O3-1.6% exhibited the optimal photocatalytic activity in hydrogen production (0.63 mumol h-1) and oxygen evolution (0.32 mumol h-1), which is almost 35-fold higher than that of a pure Co3(PO4)2 catalyst. In addition, the chemical stoichiometric ratio of H2 and O2 in the photocatalysis process is almost 2 :1. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was attributed to the synergetic effects of Co3(PO4)2 and alpha-Fe2O3 in the Z-scheme structure, which resulted in highly efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2044-4753			INSPEC:18137080

The abundant internal cavities in hollow particles can provide a larger number of active sites and promote the electron/mass transport in the OER, and thus are highly desirable. However, their large-scale facile preparation, especially for small-sized particles, remains challenging. We present herein a scalable high-frequency ultrasonic pyrolysis strategy to prepare ultrafine Fe-doped NiO porous hollow spheres as OER catalysts. In this aerosol droplet-mediated method, a 3 MHz high-frequency ultrasonic wave ensures the formation of small sized droplets and oxide hollow products. The prepared Ni0.9Fe0.1O hollow spheres with a NiO phase exhibit a uniform and small size of similar to 200 nm and a wall thickness of similar to 10 nm, and they are highly porous with a specific surface area of about 50 m(2) g(-1). The fine and hollow structure increases the OER active site number, while the synergistic effect of Fe and Ni elements optimizes the intrinsic activity. As a result, the Ni0.9Fe0.1O hollow spheres have a low OER overpotential for achieving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (288 mV), suggesting an excellent OER performance. During potentiostatic testing, almost no decrease in the current density occurred upon catalyzing for 18 h, indicating the high stability of our catalyst, which may be because the well-crystallized NiO phase may suppress the rapid dissolution of the doped Fe in catalyzing the OER, thereby diminishing an appreciable activity loss. This synthesis strategy can be applied to other ultrafine hollow particles.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000863909300001

Other chelating agents assayed, including o-phenanthroline, cannot replace NC in promoting the O-2 formation. O-2 is also produced by adding NC to a mixture of Cu-II and H2O2 Concomitant with the O-2 evolution, the typical absorbance of the (NC)(2)Cu-I complex appears to account for the complete reduction of Cu-II to Cu-I. It is concluded that the addition of H2O2 with Cu-II produces the equilibrium Cu-II(O2H)(-) <-> (CdO2H)-O-I.. Addition of NC shifts the equilibrium to the right side by binding CuI. The released O-2(.-) then reacts with the remaining Cu-II yielding, in the presence of NC, the net reaction of 4 NC + 2 Cu-II + H2O2 --> 2 (NC)(2)Cu-I + O-2 + 2 H+. O-2 is also released in the absence of added NC provided the H2O2 concentration is increased. In these conditions the Cu-II(O2H)(-) complex undergoes other reactions leading to the copper-catalysed decomposition of H2O2.

Consistent construction of poly(oxyphenylene)-coated carbon fiber ultramicroelectrodes (CF-UMEs) with tip diameters less than 1.5 mu m proceeds by epoxy-sealing a carbon-fiber filament within a pulled-glass capillary, electrochemical etching of the protruding fiber of an CF into a conical tip and insulating the protruding fiber by electropolymerized poly(oxyphenylene) while the conical tip is protected within a conductive silicon rubber membrane. The CF-UMEs were characterized by cyclic voltammetry and successfully employed as an amperometric SECM tip to study the correlation between crystal structure orientation of an iridium/iridium oxide substrate and its electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction. To prepare a pH ultramicroelectrode (pH-UME), a thin film of IrOx is electrochemically deposited on the surface of a CF-UME. The pH-UME shows a response time of < 5 s over the pH range of 2-12 with a sensitivity of 65.3 mV/pH. As a potentiometric SECM-tip, the pH-UME was successfully used to map the pH changes near the surface of a negatively biased Au disk electrode in buffered solutions. Results indicate that these pH-UME tips are well-suited for SECM studies requiring high-resolution pH imaging. (C) The Author(s) 2019.

These results are consistent with a at behavior in this metallicity range, tempting one to deduce from these observations a primordial value for the He-3 abundance, which could join D and Li-7 as an indicator of the cosmic baryon density. However, using the same data, we show that it is not possible to obtain a strong constraint on the baryon density range. This is due to (1) the intrinsically weak sensitivity of the primordial He-3 abundance to the baryon density, (2) the limited range in metallicity of the sample, (3) the intrinsic scatter in the data, and (4) our limited understanding of the chemical and stellar evolution of this isotope. Consequently, the He-3 observations correspond to an extended range of baryon-to-photon ratio, eta = (2.2-6.5) x 10(-10), which diminishes the role of He-3 as a precision baryometer. On the other hand, once the baryon-to-photon ratio is determined by the cosmic microwave background, D/H, or Li-7/H, the primordial value of He-3/H can be inferred. Henceforth, new observations of Galactic He-3 can in principle greatly improve our understanding of stellar and/or chemical evolution and reconcile the observations of the H II regions and those of the planetary nebulae.									61	1	0	0	0	0	61			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000181287200002		
J	PUTRENKO, II								ROLE OF S-0, S-1, S-2, AND S-3 STATES OF THE MANGANESE CLUSTER IN THE WATER-OXIDIZING COMPLEX OF PS-II IN THE INDUCTION OF LUMINOL CHEMILUMINESCENCE								BIOCHEMISTRY-MOSCOW				60	9			1133	1141						SEP 1995	1995	The slow phase of a chemiluminescence induced by the addition of photosystem II (PS II)-enriched chloroplast membrane particles to a luminol-peroxidase system in phosphate buffer (pH 8.0-8.5) was studied. Mixing of dark-adapted PS II particles (with or without a microsecond light flash) with the luminol-peroxidase system induced a chemiluminescence (signal B') which slowly increased in intensity to reach a maximum within 3-5 min after mixing. PS II particles illuminated with a series of five flashes induced chemiluminescence (signal B) whose intensity reached a higher maximum 1-1.5 min after mixing; the maximum intensity did not rise with further increase in the flash number. The magnitude (area) of signal B was 2-6 times greater than that of signal B'. PS II particles illuminated in the presence of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (6 mu M) or an inhibitor of O-2 evolution, tetracyanoethylene (10 mu M), induced only the B' signal. Catalase suppressed signals B' and B (I-50 = 0.14-0.15 mu M) only when added during measurement. PS II particles from which Mn had been extracted did not induce signals B' and B. The magnitudes of signals Delta B (B - B') and B' were at largest when the reaction medium contained 200 mM phosphate buffer, and these signals were not detected in the presence of 1 M Tris-HCl or 50 mM Hepes-NaOH buffers. Luminol chemiluminescence dependent on the type of buffer in the reaction medium was also induced by manganese coordination complexes. It is concluded that signal B' is related to the S-0, S-1, and S-2 states and signal Delta B to the S-3 state of the water-oxidizing complex. It is suggested that H2O2, which gives rise to signals Delta B and B', is formed by the oxidation of luminol by molecular oxygen. This reaction is catalyzed by the manganese cluster in the water-oxidizing complex and indicates an oxidase activity of PS II. The difference between the magnitudes of signals Delta B and B' is probably due to a structural transition in the manganese cluster occurring during the S-2-S-3 transition.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0006-2979			WOS:A1995TG96900014

Here we report an approach to depositing a novel manganese borate (Mn-Bi) OER catalyst on BiVO4 nanocone photoanode by photodeposition in sodium borate buffer solution containing Mn(II) ions. Due to the spontaneous photo-electric-field-enhancement effect at the vertically oriented BiVO4 nanocone structure, spherical Mn-Bi nanoparticle was selectively photodeposited at the apex of BiVO4 nanocone. Significant improvement of photocurrent was observed for the obtained hierarchical Mn-Bi/BiVO4 photoanode which could be ascribed to enhanced hole injection efficiency, especially in low bias region. It was observed that the injection efficiency of Mn-Bi/BiVO4 is 98% which gave a photocurrent of 0.94 mA/cm(2) at 1.5 V vs. RHE.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000458992000014

In our previous work, IrO2-Ta2O5 catalysts supported on Ti fibers exhibited an amorphous structure, a large electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), and a high stability in acidic media. However, the local structure of amorphous OER electrocatalysts has not been studied extensively. In this study, the properties of an amorphous IrO2-Ta2O5 layer were analyzed through X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to understand the factors that contribute to its high OER stability. Herein, the addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to a precursor composed of H2IrCl6 and TaCl5 resulted in the formation of IrO2 nanoparticles with low chlorine residues even after thermal decomposition at a low temperature of 350 degrees C. X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy results showed that the synthesized IrO2 nanoparticles were amorphous. However, from the XAS results, the local [IrO6] octahedron structure, which is similar to that of rutile IrO2 crystals, was revealed. During the preparation process, PEG assisted a complete ligand exchange from the [IrCl6] octahedron to the [IrO6] octahedron. This local structure of the IrO2 nanoparticles makes the amorphous IrO2-Ta2O5 layer on the Ti fibers stable during OER in acidic media. Furthermore, sintering is unlikely to occur during the synthesis because of the low thermal decomposition temperature of the precursor. As such, the synthesized amorphous IrO2 nanoparticles exhibited a large ECSA. In addition, the high intrinsic activity of the [IrO6] local structure resulted in a small Tafel slope. Thus, the amorphous IrO2 nanoparticles with an [IrO6] local structure are essential not only to achieve high activity but also high stability during the OER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000745903400001

Because of its good chemical stability and available tritium release behavior, Li2TiO3 has been selected as one of leading candidates for ceramic breeder materials. During a blanket operation, defects are introduced into tritium breeder materials by high energy neutrons and energetic particles from nuclear reactions, resulting in performance degration of the materials. He and O ion irradiation were applied to introduce irradiation damage into Li2TiO3 in this study. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectra experiments were performed to identify the evolution of the Li2TiO3 microstructure. The experimental results show that the atomic arrangement in Li2TiO3 is strongly disordered by the ion irradiation. The destruction of long-range order is confirmed by the reduction in XRD intensities. The destruction of short-range order is validated by the reduction in the Raman intensities and disappearance of Raman bands with increasing irradiation dose. The disorder in Li2TiO3 structure is considered to be associated with the species and energy of the ions. In order to further clarify the defects induced by ion irradiation, Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) was employed. E-centers which are oxygen vacancies occupied by one electron have been formed by ion irradiation. Compared with He ion irradiation, O ion irradiation produces relatively less E-centers, but more Ti3+ defects. These different defects induced by irradiation are discussed in relation to the disorder of microstructure.					23rd International Conference on Ion Beam Analysis (IBA)23rd International Conference on Ion Beam Analysis (IBA)	OCT 08-13, 2017OCT 08-13, 2017	Int Atom Energy Agcy; Shanghai Seeder Publ Acad Sci & Technol; Natl Electrostat Corp; High Voltage Engn Europa B V; KYKY Technol Co; IONTOF; Sky Technol Dev; Pfeiffer VacummInt Atom Energy Agcy; Shanghai Seeder Publ Acad Sci & Technol; Natl Electrostat Corp; High Voltage Engn Europa B V; KYKY Technol Co; IONTOF; Sky Technol Dev; Pfeiffer Vacumm	Fudan Univ, Handan Campus, Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINAFudan Univ, Handan Campus, Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA	11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0168-583X	1872-9584		WOS:000474501400039

In this reaction, GR helps scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) as reducing power and protects plants from ROS damage. In this review, we focused on GR biological functions and characteristics by study their distribution and comparing gene and amino acid sequences. In order to make the discussion clearly, we summarized a huge amount of relative research progresses -plants' GR functions in stress conditions and enzyme-deficiency researches. As a result, a conclusion on GR functions in plant in vivo was made, particularly on the expression and regulation functions of GR pathway and physiological functions of metabolic products. Further, we discussed its possible origins of GR and made a hypothesis on its evolutionary process based on former research results and our theoretical analysis. This review will make a significant reference for further researches on GR.			谷胱甘肽还原酶(glutathione reductase,GR:EC 1.6.4.2)是植物体内一种重要的抗氧化酶类,其主要的生理功能是将氧化型谷胱甘肽(oxidaized glutathione disulfide,GSSG)还原成还原型谷胱甘肽(reduced glutathione,GSH),从而为活性氧(reactive oxygen species,ROS)的清除提供还原力,保护植物免受伤害。文中主要从Gr基因及其氨基酸序列的比较等方面分析了该酶的生物学特性;又对植物逆境响应,酶基因的缺失等方面的研究进行综述,阐释了GR酶在植物体内的作用原理、在逆境胁迫中抗逆表达调控途径及其作用机制;并对已有的研究成果进行总结分析,探讨了GR酶可能的起源及系统进化过程,为今后该酶的研究提供理论参考。						5	19	0	0	7	0	24			1007-7626			CSCD:4848373

The previously developed lithiated NiO modified Ni (Li (x) Ni2-x O-2/Ni) has a high catalytic activity and durability during potential cycling, whereas the relatively high surface oxide resistance due to preparation of the oxidation at high temperature with a LiOH coating. In order to improve the catalytic activity, we proposed optimization of the oxide layer by thermal decomposition with various precursor coatings. The oxide layers prepared with acetate and nitrate precursors were dense and porous, respectively. The initial activity obtained from the acetate precursor electrode was higher than that of the nitrate precursor and the oxidation with the LiOH coating. Although the nitrate precursor electrode suffered from the same degradation as the Ni anode during potential cycling, the activity of the acetate precursor electrode as well as the oxidized electrode with the LiOH coating increased, and the activity for the former was almost the same as the initial Ni anode after 20,000 cycles. The lower preparation temperature of the acetate precursor would suppress the formation of the electron resistive nickel oxide between the base nickel and lithiated NiO, which was observed for the oxidized electrode with the LiOH coating as well. While the double-layer capacitance and redox peak around 1.3 V vs. RHE of the Ni and the nitrate precursor electrode significantly increased with Ni(IV) formation during potential cycling, those of the acetate precursor electrode slightly increased without any Ni(IV) formation. Therefore, the dense Li (x) Ni2-x O-2 prepared with acetate has a good electric conductivity and catalytic activity with a high durability during potential cycling as the anode of an alkaline water electrolyzer for renewable power sources.									13	0	0	0	0	0	14			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000426955500005

Low concentrations of SNP or H2O2 were used to minimize nonspecific effects. The effects of NO or H2O2 on respiration and photosynthesis were different. The presence of NO decreased the rate of photosynthesis but caused a marginal stimulation of dark respiration. Conversely, externally administered H2O2 drastically decreased the rate of respiration but only slightly decreased photosynthesis. The PS I activity was more sensitive to NO than PS II. On the other hand, 100 mu M H2O2 had no effect on the photochemical reactions of either PS I or PS II. The sensitivity of photosynthesis to antimycin A or SHAM (reflecting the interplay between chloroplasts and mitochondria) was not affected by NO. By contrast, H2O2 markedly decreased the sensitivity of photosynthesis to antimycin A and SHAM. It can be concluded that chloroplasts are the primary targets of NO, while mitochondria are the primary targets of ROS in plant cells. We propose that H2O2 can be an important signal to modulate the crosstalk between chloroplasts and mitochondria.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0176-1617	1618-1328		WOS:000519607200009	32065920

Mitochondrial respiration may be uncoupled from ATP synthesis by a proton leak induced by the thermogenic uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). Mild uncoupling activity, as proposed for UCP2, UCP3, and avian UCP could theoretically control ROS production, but the nature of their transport activities is far from being definitively understood. The recent discovery of a UCP1 gene in fish has balanced the evolutionary view of uncoupling protein history. The thermogenic proton transport of mammalian UCP1 seems now to be a late evolutionary characteristic and the hypothesis that ancestral UCPs may carry other substrates is tempting. Using in silico genome analyses among taxa and a biochemical approach, we present a detailed phylogenetic analysis of UCPs and investigate whether avian UCP is a good candidate for pleiotropic mitochondrial activities, knowing that only one UCP has been characterized in the avian genome, unlike all other vertebrates. We show, here, that the avian class seems to be the only vertebrate lineage lacking two of the UCP1/2/3 homologues present in fish and mammals. We suggest, based on phylogenetic evidence and synteny of the UCP genes, that birds have lost UCP1 and UCP2. The phylogeny also supports the history of two rounds of duplication during vertebrate evolution. The avian uncoupling protein then represents a unique opportunity to explore how UCPs' activities are controlled, but also to understand why birds exhibit such a particular relationship between high metabolism and slow rate of aging.									34	2	0	0	33	0	37			0022-2844	1432-1432		WOS:000250626400004	17909695

Significant mixing beyond convective boundaries determined by mixing-length theory brings fuel (C-12) into the convective region, causing hot spots of nuclear burning. Plumes dominate the velocity structure. Finite perturbations arise in a region in which O-16 will be explosively burned to Ni-56 when the star explodes; the resulting instabilities and mixing are likely to distribute Ni-56 throughout the supernova envelope. Inhomogeneities in Y(e) may be large enough to affect core collapse and will affect explosive nucleosynthesis. The nature of convective burning is dramatically different from that assumed in one-dimensional simulations; quantitative estimates of nucleosynthetic yields, core masses, and the approach to core collapse will be affected.									65	0	0	0	1	0	65			0004-637X			WOS:A1994PG64000011

In some models, helium accretion on to a carbon-oxygen (CO) WD from a companion was suggested to dynamically trigger a detonation of the accreted helium shell. The helium detonation then produces a shock that after converging on itself close to the core of the CO WD, triggers a secondary carbon detonation, and gives rise to an energetic explosion. However, most studies of such scenarios have been done in one or two dimensions, and/or did not consider self-consistent models for the accretion and the He donor. Here, we make use of detailed 3D simulation to study the interaction of a He-rich hybrid 0.69 M-circle dot HeCO WD with a more massive 0.8 M-circle dot CO WD. We find that accretion from the hybrid WD on to the CO WD gives rise to a helium detonation. However, the helium detonation does not trigger a carbon detonation in the CO WD. Instead, the helium detonation burns through the accretion stream to also burn the helium shell of the donor hybrid HeCO WD. The detonation of its massive helium shell then compresses its CO core, and triggers its detonation and full destruction. The explosion gives rise to a faint, likely highly reddened transient, potentially observable by the Vera Rubin survey, and the high-velocity (similar to 1000 kms(-1)) ejection of the heated surviving CO WD companion. Pending on uncertainties in stellar evolution, we estimate the rate of such transient to be up to similar to 10 per cent of the rate of type Ia SNe.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000649001600005

We concentrate mainly on water, methanol and carbon dioxide, which constitute nearly 90 per cent of the grain mantle. We investigate how the production rates of these molecules depend on the relative gas-phase abundances of oxygen and carbon monoxide and constrain the relevant parameter space that reproduces these molecules close to the observed abundances. Allowing the accretion of only H, O and CO on the grains and using the Monte Carlo method, we follow the chemical processes for a few million years. We allow the formation of multilayers on the grains and incorporate the freeze-out effects of accreting O and CO. We find that the formation of these molecules depends on the initial conditions as well as on the average cloud density. Specifically, when the number density of accreting O is less than three times that of CO, methanol is always overproduced. Using the available reaction pathways it appears to be difficult to match the exact observed abundances of all three molecules simultaneously. Only in a narrow region of parameter space are all three molecules produced within the observed limits. Furthermore, we found that the incorporation of the freeze-outs of O and CO leads to an almost steady state on the grain surface. The mantle thickness grows anywhere between 60 and 500 layers in a period of two million years. In addition, we consider a case in which the gas number density changes with time owing to the gradual collapse of the molecular cloud and present the evolution of the composition of different species as a function of the radius of the collapsing cloud.									43	2	0	0	0	0	43			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000284282300027

The change in chemical, optical, and structural properties was analysed by comparing Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and ultraviolet (UV)-visible spectra of pristine and irradiated films. The FTIR spectra show no major change in characteristic bands on irradiation, except that some weak bands appear because of the evolution of volatile species, unsaturated bond formation, decomposition of the free radicals, and subsequent cross-linking. The spectra of the irradiated films show some broadening and a decrease in intensity in characteristic bands when compared with the pristine samples. The FTIR results indicate that the overall chemical structure of PVDF is stable under SHI irradiation.The UV-visible absorption spectra of irradiated samples reveal hyperchromic shift, bathochromic shift, and hypsochromic shift. The spectra also estimate the direct optical band gap around 3.6 eV. The band gap decreases on irradiation, and the decrease is dependent on ion beam and fluence rate. The present study opens up the scope for the applicability of SHI-irradiated PVDF thin films as microsensors and actuators.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1350-6501	2041-305X		WOS:000279867000007

This paper focuses on the effect induced by the total gas flow rate and gas composition on the characteristics of pulsed DBD. Using tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy, ultraviolet absorption, and optical emission spectroscopy, complementary information on the reactive species (O, O-3, N-2, and N-2(+)) present in the discharge has been obtained. It results that the excited species generated by direct electron excitation (as He and N-2) follow the evolution of their precursors with increasing gas flow rate, while those created by chain reactions (as N-2(+), O, and O-3) depend on the collective behavior of all their precursors, regardless of the fact that these are originating from the feeding gas or are coming from impurities. At specific energies, between 5 and 50 J/L, and a gas temperature of 315 +/- 20 K, the atmospheric-pressure plasma is able to produce 10(14)-10(15) m(-3) of O (3(5)S(2)) or (1.5-2.8) x 10(15) cm(-3) of O-3, depending on the feeding gas composition and its flow rate. Low gas temperature and high density of reactive species could make the present DBD arrangement suitable for medical applications.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			0093-3813	1939-9375		WOS:000352084400013

This combined theoretical and pump-probe femtosecond time experiment on 2-hydroxypyridine proposes an answer. Bypassing the well-established transition state and conical intersection relaxation pathways, this molecular system undergoes relaxation into the S-1 excited state: the central ring is destabilized by the electronic excitation, within similar to 100 fs after absorption of the pump photon, then the H-atom bound to oxygen undergoes a roaming behavior when it couples to other degrees of freedom of the molecule. The timescale of the latter process is measured to be similar to 1.3 ps. Further evolution of the wavepacket is either an oscillation onto the S1 potential or a conversion into the triplet state for timescale larger than similar to 110 ps. Our work introduces a new tool for the understanding of time-resolved relaxation dynamics applied to large molecules through the roaming dynamics characterized by its strongly delocalized wavepacket on flat molecular potential energy surfaces.									22	1	0	0	2	0	22			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000327888100023	24196979

Single-atom electrocatalysts with maximum atom efficiency are highly considered as an alternative of the present noble-metal-based electrocatalysts. However, the fabrication of transition metal single-atoms is very challenging, requiring extensive attempts of precursors with novel design principles. Herein, an all-covalently constructed cobalt-coordinated framework porphyrin with graphene hybridization is innovatively designed and prepared as the pyrolysis precursor to fabricate single-atom Co-N-x-C electrocatalysts. Excellent electrochemical performances are realized for both bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis and rechargeable Zn-air batteries with regard to reduced overpotentials, improved kinetics, and prolonged cycling stability comparable with noble-metal-based electrocatalysts. Design principles from multiple scales are proposed and rationalized with detailed mechanism investigation. This work not only provides a novel precursor for the fabrication of high-performance single-atom electrocatalysts, but also inspires further attempts to develop advanced materials and emerging applications.									227	34	0	0	8	0	229			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000469243400021	30907474

Here, we fabricate a novel interconnected N, S-codoped porous exfoliated carbon nanosheets (ECNs) with large specific area and pore volume through a one-step carbonization process by using glucose/melamine-sulphate-salt (GMSS) as precursor. By carefully examining the carbonization process of the precursor, we propose a phase separation mechanism for the formation of ECNs. The optimized sample, composed of interconnected thin graphite layers with N and S co-doping in the carbon lattice, exhibits outstanding ORR activity in terms of half-wave potential (0.83 V vs. RHE) and onset potential (0.97 V vs. RHE), together with 4-electron selectivity (H2O2 yield less than 8%), one of the best among all reported metal-free ORR catalysts.

Herein, a novel anodic HOR electrocatalyst with RuP nanoparticles loaded on N, O codoped porous hollow carbon (RuP/NOC) is prepared. The catalyst exhibits high catalytic activity toward HOR, achieving a kinetic mass activity of 3.25 mA mu g(PGM)(-1) at 50 mV, 13 times higher than that of Ru/NOC and even superior to that of Pt/C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the transfer of electrons from ruthenium to phosphorus shifts down the d-band center of Ru, weakening the hydroxyl binding energy and decreasing the reaction energy barrier for HOR, thus enhancing the catalytic activity of Ru.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2196-7350			WOS:000751745600001

The best-known ETP is gliotoxin, which appears to be a virulence factor associated with invasive aspergillosis of immunocompromised patients. The toxicity of ETPs is due to the presence of a disulphide bridge, which can inactivate proteins via reaction with thiol groups, and to the generation of reactive oxygen species by redox cycling. With the availability of complete fungal genome sequences and efficient gene-disruption techniques for fungi, approaches are now feasible to delineate biosynthetic pathways for ETPs and to gain insights into the evolution of such gene clusters.									316	18	0	0	230	0	342			1350-0872	1465-2080		WOS:000228509100003	15817772	
J	SHEN, JR; VERMAAS, W; INOUE, Y				Shen, Jian-Ren/B-2558-2011				THE ROLE OF CYTOCHROME C-550 AS STUDIED THROUGH REVERSE GENETICS AND MUTANT CHARACTERIZATION IN SYNECHOCYSTIS SP PCC-6803								JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY				270	12			6901	6907		10.1074/jbc.270.12.6901				MAR 24 1995	1995	The gene coding for cytochrome c-550 in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was cloned based on the N-terminal sequence of the mature polypeptide. Using the most probable translation start codon, the gene is expected to code for 160 amino acid residues. This includes a cleavable N-terminal leader sequence of 25 residues. This leader sequence has an Arg-Asn-Arg sequence immediately before the cleavage site; this is characteristic for transit peptides in prokaryotes. Comparison of this sequence with the leader sequence of the photosystem II-associated extrinsic 33-kDa protein from the same cyanobacterium showed an identity of 13 out of 25 residues. These results suggest that after synthesis of the apoprotein, cytochrome c-550 is transported into the thylakoid lumen. Using the cloned gene, insertion and deletion mutants of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 were constructed. In the absence of cytochrome c-550, both mutants were capable of photoautotrophic growth but at a significantly reduced rate. Atrazine binding and Western blot analysis showed that these mutants on a per-chlorophyll basis contained 53-67% of the amount of photosystem II as compared with wild type. The photosystem II- specific oxygen-evolving activity at saturating light intensity was reduced to about 40% of that in the wild type strain. Taken together, these results indicate that the cytochrome c-550 is transported into the thylakoid lumen and contributes to optimal functional stability of photosystem II in cyanobacteria. This supports our biochemical evidence that cytochrome c-550 is associated with the lumenal side of photosystem II as one of the extrinsic proteins enhancing oxygen evolution (Shen, J.-R., Ikeuchi, M., and Inoue, Y. (1992) FEBS Lett. 301, 145-149; Shen, J.-R., and Inoue, Y. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 1825-1832). Based on these results, the gene for cytochrome c-550 was named psbV. The possible evolutionary relationship among extrinsic proteins of the photosystem II donor side is discussed.									78	0	0	0	68	0	79			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:A1995QQ85500070	7896839

Contrary to this, low concentration of dimethoate (50 ppm) caused stimulation on these parameters, while together with UV-B it showed inhibitory effects. Carotenoids (Car) showed varied responses. It was found that carbon-fixation ((CO2)-C-14) was more sensitive to both the stresses than photosynthetic oxygen evolution. Photosynthetic electron transport activity was reduced by both the stresses, however, 50 ppm dimethoate besides inhibiting photosystem II (PSII) and whole chain activity, showed slight stimulation in photosystem I (PSI) activity. The individual effect of two stresses on PSII activity was probably due to interruption of electron flow at oxidation side of PSII which extended to its reaction center following simultaneous exposure. A similar trend was also noticed in case of CO2 liberation (measured as (CO2)-C-14 release) in light and dark. Results suggest that dimethoate (100 and 200 ppm) and UV-B alone caused heavy damage on pigments and photosynthetic activity of cowpea, leading to the significant inhibition in growth. Further, the interactive effects of both the stresses got intensified. However, low concentration (50 ppm) of dimethoate showed stimulation, but in combination, it slightly recovered from the damaging effect, caused by UV-B. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

To date, it is still challenging to synergistically tune the crystal structure, morphology, and electronic band (i.e., band gap and band alignments) of MnO2 through facile synthesis approaches. This study has reported a one-step hydrothermal method to synthesize a prototypical MnO2 electrocatalyst with optimized structural and electrochemical properties. By simply adjusting the hydrothermal time, the phase transition from polymorphic 8 to alpha can be induced in MnO2. The obtained nanowires on nanosheets structure grown in-situ on nickel foam provides a large surface area, great accessible active sites, and good mass/charge transfer efficiency. Further investigation through first-principles calculations reveals that compared to delta-MnO2, the alpha-MnO2 polymorph with rich oxygen vacancies has better band-alignment tunability, which is also beneficial for improving the electrochemical performance. The alpha phase MnO2 exhibits superior catalytic performance for both OER and HER (OER overpotential of 0.45 V at 50 mA cm(-2) and HER overpotential of 0.14 V at 50 mA cm(-2)). The developed synthesis method can be extended to catalyst designs that require precise control of phase and morphology evolution in a wide range of applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000779697700005

The aim of the study is to compare some bionomic and physiological parameters of susceptible and nematicide-exposed strains with regard to possible alterations of fitness. The following parameters were tested: temperature tolerance, motion activity, oxygen consumption, migration in electrical fields, reproductivity of individual females and body measurements. In some cases different breeding temperatures (14, 22, 28 degrees C) were included as an additional factor. In media without active substances the susceptible animals are privileged and show more advantageous reactions than nematicide-exposed strains. On the other hand the long-term exposed strains indicate much higher tolerance to the nematicides and better adaptation than the sensitive ones. Aldicarb proved to be the stronger resistance producer. Different temperature conditions can superimpose on the reactions, lower temperatures being generally more favourable than higher ones. Oriented migration in electrical fields is considered to be a useful tool to elucidate behaviour patterns. In both exposed strains body measurements were remarkably reduced,in particular the tail region. It seems that some alterations (e.g. reduced body size) are part of a changed fitness strategy under permanent nematicide stress. The results are discussed in this context.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0028-2596			WOS:A1995RQ32100004		
J	Lacas, F; Leroux, B; Darabiha, N								Experimental study of air dilution in oxy-liquid fuel flames								PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE				30				2037	2045		10.1016/j.proci.2004.08.084				2005	2005	The influence of oxidizer dilution in oxy-liquid ethanol flames is experimentally investigated by using a coaxial air-assisted injector positioned in a vertical combustion chamber. This study accounts for the influence of a two-phase mode since two different injector geometries are used: for the first configuration, a vaporization mode is observed at nominal power in oxy conditions, while for the second one, a brush mode is observed. Dilution with air is applied by keeping oxidizer velocity constant. Flame structure is observed through CH emission: dilution leads to an increase in the flame diameter, and collective effects of two-phase combustion are encouraged. The effect of dilution on oxy flame stability is also studied: for a given oxygen mass fraction in the oxidizer, the oxidizer flow rate is increased until extinction occurs. Dilution leads to a less stable flame, which may be essentially explained by the decrease in laminar flame speed with dilution. For high oxidizer dilution levels, the change in flame structure might be another parameter to consider. Finally, species concentrations are measured using a standard gas sampling technique, NO and CO evolutions with dilution are different between both two-phase combustion regimes. An empirical approach based on thermal NO mechanism and CO oxidation reaction enables one to explain the evolutions for brush mode. For vaporization mode, the residence time in burned gases is also to be considered. (c) 2004 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Ni-rich layered transition metal oxides exhibit higher interfacial reactivity than their lower Ni-content analogues, reacting via mechanisms that are poorly understood. Here, we study the pivotal role of the electrolyte solvent, specifically cyclic ethylene carbonate (EC) and linear ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), in determining the interfacial reactivity at charged LiNi0.33Mn0.3 Co0.33O2 (NMC111) and LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) cathodes by using both single-solvent model electrolytes and the mixed solvents used in commercial cells. While NMC111 exhibits similar parasitic currents with EC-containing and EC-free electrolytes during high voltage holds in NMC/Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) cells, this is not the case for NMC811. Online gas analysis reveals that the solvent-dependent reactivity for Ni-rich cathodes is related to the extent of lattice oxygen release and accompanying electrolyte decomposition, which is higher for EC-containing than EC-free electrolytes. Combined findings from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), TEM, solution NMR, ICP, and XPS reveal that the electrolyte solvent has a profound impact on the degradation of the Ni-rich cathode and the electrolyte. Higher lattice oxygen release with EC-containing electrolytes is coupled with higher cathode interfacial impedance, a thicker oxygen-deficient rock-salt surface reconstruction layer, more electrolyte solvent and salt breakdown, and higher amounts of transition metal dissolution. These processes are suppressed in the EC-free electrolyte, highlighting the incompatibility between Ni-rich cathodes and conventional electrolyte solvents. Finally, new mechanistic insights into the chemical oxidation pathways of electrolyte solvents and, critically, the knock-on chemical and electrochemical reactions that further degrade the electrolyte and electrodes curtailing battery lifetime are provided.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000787373300022	35258927
