J	EGGERS, B; VERMAAS, W								TRUNCATION OF THE D2 PROTEIN IN SYNECHOCYSTIS SP PCC-6803 - A ROLE OF THE C-TERMINAL DOMAIN OF D2 IN PHOTOSYSTEM-II FUNCTION AND STABILITY								BIOCHEMISTRY				32	42			11419	11427		10.1021/bi00093a020				OCT 26 1993	1993	Termination and deletion mutations were introduced near the C-terminal end of the D2 protein in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 in order to determine the role of the large hydrophilic C-terminal domain of D2 in the function and stability of photosystem II (PS II). The loss of 57 residues from the C-terminal end of D2 (most of the hydrophilic tail) resulted in the loss of D2 and PS II reaction centers from thylakoids. Truncation of 16, 15, 14, or 13 amino acid residues from the C-terminus of D2 resulted in a virtual disappearance of oxygen evolution, a loss of photoautotrophic growth, and a decrease in the number of PS II centers in thylakoids. The loss of 11 C-terminal amino acid residues led to a photoautotrophic mutant that grew at one-half the rate of the wild type under photoautotrophic conditions and that showed a progressive loss of oxygen evolution at high light intensity. Truncation of 9 residues from D2 led to a virtual loss of CP43, presumably because of interference of the mutation with the overlapping ribosome-binding site for psbC translation. To delete smaller portions of D2 and yet not interfere with psbC expression, various deletions were made between the tenth and twentieth amino acid residues from the C-terminal end of D2, resulting in the loss of 8, 7, 4, 3, and 2 residues. The deletion of 8 or 7 residues from within the C-terminal end of D2 resulted in photoautotrophic mutants. Surprisingly, the deletion of shorter fragments had more pronounced effects: deletion of 4 residues within the same domain gave rise to a mutant lacking D2 and PS II centers. A mutant with a deletion of 3 residues was an obligate photoheterotroph, containing functional PS II reaction centers but showing rapid photoinhibition. The deletion of 2 residues resulted in an obligate photoheterotrophic mutant with a 10-fold-reduced level of PS II centers. In the mutant lacking the 15 C-terminal residues of D2, fluorescence induction behavior indicated rapid inactivation at the donor side. In this and similar mutants, stable PS II-mediated electron transport between diphenylcarbazide and dichlorophenolindophenol could be observed at rates proportional to their PS II content. These results indicate that the primary effect of the mutations is on the oxygen-evolving complex. We conclude that domains near the C-terminal end of D2 have a role in oxygen evolution and contribute to determining the stability and activity of the PS II complex.									14	0	0	0	11	0	14			0006-2960			WOS:A1993MD71000020	8218208

Herein, ternary NiCoP nanosheet arrays (NSAs) were fabricated on 3D Ni foam by a facile hydrothermal method followed by phosphorization. These arrays serve as bifunctional alkaline catalysts, exhibiting excellent electrocatalytic performance and good working stability for both the HER and OER. The overpotentials of the NiCoP NSA electrode required to drive a current density of 50 mA/cm(2) for the HER and OER are as low as 133 and 308 mV, respectively, which is ascribed to excellent intrinsic electrocatalytic activity, fast electron transport, and a unique superaerophobic structure. When NiCoP was integrated as both anodic and cathodic material, the electrolyzer required a potential as low as similar to 1.77 V to drive a current density of 50 mA/cm(2) for overall water splitting, which is much smaller than a reported electrolyzer using the same kind of phosphide-based material and is even better than the combination of Pt/C and Ir/C, the best known noble metal-based electrodes. Combining satisfactory working stability and high activity, this NiCoP electrode paves the way for exploring overall water splitting catalysts.									261	27	0	0	7	0	264			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000380726200005

Herein, the deeply reconstructed (DR) catalyst is proposed and derived from a sub-10 nm precatalyst to achieve high-mass-activity catalysis. As a proof-of-concept, the DR-NiOOH with a multilevel nanosheet structure interconnected by sub-5 nm nanoparticles was obtained via a lithiation-induced deep reconstruction strategy. The robust DR-NiOOH with abundant active species enables its significantly enhanced mass activity (170 mV decrease in OER over-potential to achieve 5 mA mg(-1)) and better durability (>10 days) than that of incompletely reconstructed Ni@NiOOH. Its strong corrosion resistance (30 wt % KOH, 72 h) and high thermal stability (52.8 degrees C, >40 h) were also confirmed. Theoretical analyses support that the unsaturated OH coverages on orthorhombic NiOOH endow its good OER-active property. This work highlights the merits of high-utilization DR catalysts toward potential catalytic applications under realistic conditions.									75	5	0	0	4	0	76			2380-8195			WOS:000496040800003

However, the poor stability of organic-inorganic hybrid materials in aqueous alkaline electrolytes and the presence of binders restrict their use in various electrochemical applications such as energy storage and electrocatalytic water splitting. A class of electrodeposited binder-free organic-inorganic hybrid materials based on a benzo[2,1,3]selenadiazole-5-carbonyl N-capped dipeptide (BSeLW) and metal hydroxide (Ni(OH)(2)) are prepared for electrochemical applications. The binder-free electrodeposited nanohybrids grown on carbon paper (CP) ((1 : 20) BSeLW/Ni(OH)(2)/CP) are stable in aqueous 1 M KOH electrolyte solution and exhibit pseudo-capacitive behavior with a high charge storage efficiency of 742 F g(-1) at 1.5 A g(-1). A prominent 71% specific capacitance retention at 10 A g(-1) after 1000 cycles indicates higher stability of dipeptide-based organic-inorganic nanohybrids on the carbon paper-based electrode surface. Additionally, the nanohybrid shows catalytic activity for electrocatalytic water splitting with a low overpotential for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline aqueous 1 M KOH solution. This work elucidates the rational engineering of organic-inorganic binder-free multi-functional nanohybrid electrodes as a favorable candidate for high-performance energy storage and electrocatalyst for electrocatalytic water splitting.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2398-4902			WOS:000518690900032

This review first summarizes the different synthetic strategies for 2D heterostructures. The significant role of 2D heterointerfaces for energy storage and conversion is then discussed, involving charge transfer and redistribution, the 2D space-confined effect and the tunable 2D channel. The recent progress of 2D vdW heterostructures for energy-related electrochemical applications is reviewed, including electrocatalysts (e.g., hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction and overall water splitting), Li+/Na+ ion batteries and supercapacitors. Advanced studies that highlight the impressive interfacial synergistic effect for improved performance are systematically introduced. Finally, current challenges and prospective solutions of this field for energy-related applications are proposed.									31	2	0	0	1	0	30			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000508175800014

Herein, robust electrocatalysts using a heterostructure of Ni-sulphide (NiS, NiS2 and Ni3S2) and -selenide (NiSe) supported on Ni-foam (NF) have been developed via the simple single-step thermal diffusion of S and Se. Among the various prepared hierarchical structures, Ni3S2@NiSe/NF shows the best catalytic activity for the HER, with low overpotentials of 103 and 289 mV at current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm(-2), respectively. It shows a promising Tafel slope of 74.2 mV dec(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4 for the HER. The same structure also shows remarkable OER activity in acidic conditions, with an overpotential of 0.26 V (vs. RHE) at 50 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 68.9 mV dec(-1). The density functional theory (DFT)-based approach reveals that the Ni3S2@NiSe heterointerface exhibits a very low adsorption free energy for hydrogen at the cathode and strong electron localization across its interface, which facilitates the charge-transfer kinetics at the anode to improve the sluggish OER rate. In addition, its excellent HER performance results from the strong hybridization of the Ni d orbitals with the S and Se p orbitals, destabilizing their antibonding characteristics.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000804202300001

Incorporation of Ni leads to improved conductivity and favorable hydrogen adsorption on Mo sites, which collectively yield efficient electrocatalytic H-2 production from Ni-CMB catalyst. The ultrathin nature (thickness = 5.0 nm) of the designed material expectedly helps to attain high exposure of active sites and facile charge transportation through the nanosheets. Additionally, the decorated mesopores (average size = 3.86 nm) on nanosheets have benefitted towards faster electrolyte diffusion, easy gas escape from catalyst surface to support high electrocatalytic performance. Finally, well-maintained morphology of the sample and evolution of HER active sites in the material have guaranteed long-term, sustainable hydrogen production even at high current densities, which clearly demonstrate its superiority over an expensive electrolyzer (Pt-C) in alkaline water.									46	1	0	0	3	0	46			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000504828100018

In this work, fused copper(II) porphyrin-based conjugated polymer thin films are shown to be active electrocatalysts and photocatalysts for the heterogeneous hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The fused copper(II) porphyrin thin films notably show a significant reduction of the overpotential required for HER in comparison to the reference nonfused porphyrin thin films. More importantly, in-depth high-resolution mass spectrometry reveals how the porphyrin substituents influence the catalytic performance of the films, with phenyl substituents enabling superior photocatalytic performances over mesityl substituents, providing insights for the engineering of heterogeneous catalysts based on fused metalloporphyrins.									11	1	1	0	0	0	11			2574-0962			WOS:000586710300044

CoFe@N-C effectively catalyzed the overall water splitting in alkaline media. Specifically, the as-synthesized CoFe@N-C exhibited excellent activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a low over-potential of 292 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a low overpotential of 110 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The good electrocatalytic properties may be attributed to the synergistic electronic coupling between single-crystalline CoFe and highly conductive N-doped CNTs and the enrichment of active sites. Additionally, CoFe@N-C showed excellent stability and durability with no observable deviation in the overpotential for the OER and HER after 1000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV).									11	1	0	0	0	0	11				2052-1537		WOS:000557157600024

Ascorbate at millimolar concentrations was necessary for thylakoid-bound ascorbate peroxidase (tAPX) protection from inhibition by hydrogen peroxide. The K-m for H2O2 in the ascorbate peroxidase reaction was independent of the pH in the range from 7.0 to 8.0 and was 17 mu M. At pH 8.0, the K-m for H2O2 in light-dependent oxygen evolution which resulted from H2O2 addition to thylakoids was close to the K-m for H2O2 in the ascorbate peroxidase reaction. At pH 8.0 and saturating H2O2 the rates of these reactions were nearly equal, indicating that under such conditions the rate of electron transport depended on the rate of MDHA generation in the ascorbate peroxidase reaction. The rate of the latter reaction changed insignificantly while the rate of in the response to H2O2 addition dropped when the pH was decreased from 8.0 to 7.0, These data suggest the "tunnelling" supply of MDHA radical to the site of its photoreduction and the influence of MDHA disproportion on such a supply. The results implied the possibility of a competition between MDHA radical and My for electrons from the electron transport chain.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			0006-2979	1608-3040		WOS:000071727100004

Such oxidations are commonly catalyzed by cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, heme-containing enzymes that activate molecular oxygen while selectively binding and orienting the substrate for reaction. Despite the plethora of P450catalyzed reactions, the P450 fold is highly conserved, and static structures are often insufficient for characterizing conformational states that contribute to specificity. High-resolution solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) offers insights into dynamic processes and conformational changes that are required of a P450 in order to attain the combination of specificity and efficiency required for these reactions.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0958-1669	1879-0429		WOS:000665520200007	33360373

Three subjects have been studied: the macroscopical segregation due to the rimming action; the gas evolution; the relation between the factors which affect segregation and the internal soundness of the ingots and slabs. The fundamental aspects of these problems have been examined in order to contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms involved. The segregation mechanism and its dependence on the ingot shape have been explained and the control of the internal quality has been given a satisfactory solution.

J	Sato, Ayumu; Saito, Genki; Abe, Keisuke; Kunisada, Yuji; Sakaguchi, Norihito; Akiyama, Tomohiro; Nomura, Takahiro								Rapid oxygen storage and release with Brownmillerite-structured Ca2AlMnO5								JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS				851						156817	10.1016/j.jallcom.2020.156817				JAN 15 2021	2021	Brownmillerite-structured Ca2AlMnO5 is inexpensive and capable of rapid oxygen storage and release. This study focused on improving the oxygen storage/release rate of Ca2AlMnO5 , which is essential for its application in practical oxygen production systems. Two approaches were investigated for improving the oxygen-trapping ability of Ca2AlMnO5: heat treatment for 2 h and 24 h after solution combustion synthesis (SCS) and the addition of Pt nanoparticles as a catalyst. Noticeably, crystalline Ca2AlMnO5 was formed after heat treatment at 1250 degrees C for at least 2 h. For the 2-h heat treatment, the average particle size of Ca2AlMnO5 was 11.4 mu m, while that for the 24-h treatment was 18.9 mu m. This reduction in the particle size increases the oxygen storage/release rate because of the relatively short diffusion distance within the particles. The oxygen storage rate increased with the addition of Pt nanoparticles because the nanoparticles were distributed across the surface and acted as catalyst. This catalyst accelerated the oxygen-evolution reaction by activating the surface reactions between oxygen ions and the Ca2AlMnO5 particles. The short 2-h heat treatment prevented the Pt nanoparticles from aggregating. When the Pt nanoparticle addition was implemented in combination with the 2-h heat treatment, the storage and release rates were drastically improved, i.e., by 2.5 and 6.1 times, respectively, compared with the sample after 24-h heat treatment without Pt nanoparticles. The oxygen storage/release rate remained constant even after repeated use at 550 degrees C, for over 25 cycles.

Herein, a selfassembled IrCox nanorings (NRs) with bracelet-like architecture is fabricated as a bifunctional high-efficient overall water splitting electrocatalyst by a facile, controllable and surfactant-free strategy. The unique nanoring architecture enriches in abundant homointerface and strong synergistic electronic interaction between Ir and Co. The optimized IrCox. 14 NRs exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 16 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 278 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M HClO4 , respectively, significantly outperforming the commercial Pt/C, Ir/C and reported Ir-based catalysts. As both anode and cathode, a cell voltage of only 1.53 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2) is obtained for overall water splitting and no obvious activity loses after a long-term electrolysis for 14 h. Combined with a PV cell, this catalyst also shows excellent water splitting performance with a solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 12.8%. This work provides further insights on designing promising and efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for clean energy electrochemical conversion in the future. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, quaternary heteroatom (N, S, P, O)-doped multishelled carbon (NSPO-C) nanospheres are synthesized from heteroatom-containing poly(cyclotriphosphazene-codioxo-thiane) (PCD) polymer nanospheres. The contents of these quaternary heteroatoms were controlled via a facile carbonization process. The OER performance was tested, which was found to be related to the N and S contents, and the as-prepared NSPO-C-8 nanosphere anode with optimized contents of N (2.76 wt %) and S (1.52 wt %) showed a maximum OER activity, that is, it required a very low overpotential of 339 mV to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a low Tafel slope value (39.40 mV dec(-1)), which is much lower than its conventional RuO2 (401 mV), 20% Pt/C (566 mV), and PO-C nanosphere (452 mV) counterparts. Higher performance is attributed to the synergy between N and S in the NSPO-C nanospheres, which provides maximum exposure to electroactive sites, while special morphology ensures efficient pathways for fast charge transportation. These findings advocate that polyphosphazene-derived heteroatom-doped carbons are potential candidates to fabricate high-performance devices for water oxidation.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2168-0485			WOS:000526352300029

Titan's stratosphere contains oxygen compounds (CO, CO2, and H2O), implying an external source of oxygen whose nature is still uncertain. Recent observations from the Herschel Space Observatory using the HIFI and PACS instruments and the Cassini/CIRS, as well as steady-state photochemical modeling indicate that the amounts of CO2 and H2O in Titan's stratosphere may imply inconsistent values of the OH/H2O input flux, and that the oxygen source is time-variable.Aims. We attempt to reconcile the H2O and CO2 observed profiles in Titan's atmosphere by using an updated photochemical scheme and developing several time-dependent scenarios for the influx/evolution of oxygen species.Methods. We use a time-dependent photochemical model of Titan's atmosphere to calculate effective lifetimes and the response of Titan's oxygen compounds to changes in the oxygen input flux. Two variants for the C-H-O chemical network are considered. We investigate a time-variable Enceladus source and the evolution of material delivered by a cometary impact.Results. We find that the effective lifetime of H2O in Titan's atmosphere is only a factor of six shorter than that of CO2 and exceeds 10 yr below 200 km. A time-variable Enceladus source, involving a decrease by a factor of 5-20 in the OH/H2O flux over the last few centuries, shows promise in explaining the relative CO2/H2O profiles. However, if the previous measurements from the Herschel Space Observatory are representative of Titan's atmospheric water, an additional H2O loss to the haze term is needed to bring the model in full agreement with the data. In an alternate situation, CO2 production following a cometary impact that occurred at least 220-300 yr ago can in principle explain the CO2 "excess" in Titan's stratosphere, but this scenario is highly unlikely, given the estimates of the impact rate at Titan.									23	0	0	0	2	0	23			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000338681500060

The structure of the Pt(111)/water interface is a particularly interesting model system in electro-catalysis for proton exchange reactions, especially the oxygen reduction reaction in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells. Further insight into such reactions requires accurate simulations of the electrolyte structure in the interface. The study displays many interesting details in the behaviour of the electrolyte structure, e.g. that the electrolyte structure average responds to the presence of protons by a H-down water orientation and that hexagonal adsorbed water layers are present only when they are anchored at the surface by HO*. New adsorbate configurations were also found at 5/12 ML coverage of HO*, suggesting an explanation for reported cyclic voltammetry experiments. The present study is a step towards a more complete understanding of the structure of the electrochemical interface on the atomic scale.									32	0	0	0	1	0	32			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000408671600092	28829459

The structure and optical properties of photocatalysts are characterized using scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, UV-vis, atomic force microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. The g-C3N4 nanoparticles are coated on the surface of TiO2 forming a heterojunction structure, which extends the light-absorption region and inhibits the recombination of electrons with holes. Ibuprofen is used as a model pharmaceutical pollutant. The heterojunction structure allows the g-C3N4/TiO2 high photocatalytic efficiency that is two times larger than that of TiO2 nanotubes. The efficiency of g-C3N4/TiO2 is further enhanced by oxygen plasma treatment. The oxygen plasma-treated g-C3N4/TiO2 exhibits a photocatalytic efficiency of 95% within 90 min, which is much larger than that of TiO2 nanotubes (28%), g-C3N4 (52%), and g-C3N4/TiO2 nanotubes (70%). The kinetics of the photocatalytic degradation are also investigated. The plasma-treated g-C3N4/TiO2 exhibits the largest rate constant, which results from massive surface-active species and surface oxygen. Finally, the structural evolution and reaction mechanism are investigated using molecular dynamics simulations, which offer a deep insight into the photocatalytic reaction.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000537510400001

Illumination with 10 flashes at 0.25-s intervals of the PSII membranes in the presence of 2.0 mM Mn2+, 20 mM Ca2+ , and 1.2 M Cl- restored 14% of oxygen-evolving activity destroyed by the NH20H treatment. Among the benzoquinones tested, DBMIB (2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-BQ) and tetramethyl-BQ did not enhance the activity recovery, but all the others doubled the recovery when present at their optimal concentrations during illumination. The order of effectiveness was tetrabromo-, phenyl-, and 2,6-dichloro-BQs greater-than-or-equal-to 2,5-dichloro-BQ > tetrachloro-BQ > 2,5-dimethyl-BQ, though the differences were small. This order reflects their efficiencies as electron acceptors of PSII. This finding, together with others, suggests that the enhancement of activity recovery results from rapid oxidation by the benzoquinones of the reduced form of the quinone acceptors in PSII, Q(A)- and Q(B)-, which cause loss of an oxidized intermediate through charge-recombination reaction with Mn3+. The flash-number dependence of the recovery of oxygen-evolving activity indicated that the activity was not restored after one flash but recovered significantly after illumination with two flashes and then further increased upon additional flashes. This provides direct evidence that the minimum quantum requirement for photoactivation is two.									33	1	0	0	25	0	33			0006-2960			WOS:A1992HA99300032	1731910

The PSII complex in the crystals contained the D1/D2 reaction center subunits, CP47 and CP43 (two chlorophyll-binding core antenna proteins of photosystem II), cytochrome b-559 alpha- and beta -subunits, several low molecular weight subunits, and three extrinsic proteins, that is, 33 and 12 kDa proteins and cytochrome c-550. The PSII complex also retained a high rate of oxygen evolution. The apparent molecular mass of the PSII in the crystals was determined to be 580 kDa by gel filtration chromatography, indicating that the PSII crystallized is a dimer. The crystals diffracted to a maximum resolution of 3.5 Angstrom at a cryogenic temperature using X-rays from a synchrotron radiation source, SPring-8. The crystals belonged to an orthorhombic system, and the space group was P2(1)2(1)2(1) with unit cell dimensions of a = 129.7 Angstrom, b = 226.5 Angstrom, and c = 307.8 Angstrom. Each asymmetric unit contained one PSII dimer, which gave rise to a specific volume (V-M) Of 3.5 Angstrom (3)/Da based on the calculated molecular mass of 310 kDa for a PSII monomer and an estimated solvent content of 66%. Multiple data sets of native crystals have been collected and processed to 4.0 Angstrom, indicating that our crystals are suitable for structure analysis at this resolution.									109	5	0	0	76	0	113			0006-2960			WOS:000165610100004	11101288

Among the earth-abundant transition metals, Ni(II) has huge importance as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electro-catalyst owing to its high electrical conductivities, low cost, and most importantly, ability to exist in multiple oxidation states. In this report, a new Ni(II)-based CP [Ni(MCA)(bipy)(H2O)(2)](n) denoted as CP 1 (H(2)MCA = mesaconic acid, bipy = 4,4'-bipyridine) was prepared by a solvothermal method. The crystal structure analysis revealed that CP 1 has a two-dimensional structure having 8 angstrom x 12 angstrom rectangular channels. For comparison purposes, we have also synthesized another CP formulated as {[Ni(bipy)(3)(H2O)(2)]center dot(bipy)center dot(ClO4)(2)} CP 2 and tried to clarify the role of the coordinated mesaconate linker in OER. The developed CPs were directly utilized as OER catalysts in alkaline solution. The bi-linker CP 1 shows a higher OER activity compared to mono-linker CP 2 and requires an overpotential of 530 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This indicates that the additional pi-conjugated organic linker mesaconic acid in CP 1 eases the formation of NiOOH species, which enhances the OER activity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000797928000032

Cation doping is widely used to boost the photocatalytic activity of perovskite oxides while the anion doping into the oxygen (O)-site of perovskite oxides is less investigated. Herein, we present a non-metal fluorine (F-) doping strategy to improve the photocatalytic activity of Ruddlesden-Popper Sr2TiO4 perovskites for H-2 evolution reaction (HER). By optimizing the F- doping amount in Sr2TiO4-xFx, the highest H2 generation rate of 282 mu mol/h/g is achieved by Sr2TiO3.97F0.03 under full-range sunlight illumination (lambda >= 250 nm), which is 44% larger than that of Sr2TiO4 (195 mu mol/h/g). Such enhancement in the photocatalytic HER activity of Sr2TiO3.97F0.03 can be assigned to the increased surface oxygen vacancy amount, suppressed charge carrier recombination, more negative conduction band position as well as well-balanced band gap energy, particle size, and specific surface area induced by the F- doping. Our current study presents a facile and effective strategy for the future design of highly efficient catalysts for solar water splitting. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we construct a novel heterostructure electrocatalyst with abundant FeP4 nanoparticles grown on the surface of CoFe2O4 nanosheets for efficient HER catalysis. FeP4, as the crucial co-catalyst, not only promotes the proton adsorption process due to its large electronegativity but also improves the electron structure around the Co sites for optimizing H* coupling and H-2 evolution process. Consequently, the FeP4/CoFe2O4 heterostructure electrocatalyst shows a much improved HER performance (eta 100 = 168 mV) and a faster reaction kinetics by comparing with the pristine FeP4 and CoFe2O4. Further electrochemical characterization demonstrates that the heterostructure is also beneficial to increase active sites and enhance intrinsic activity. This work provides a feasible perspective for constructing heterostructure to acquire excellent HER catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000817822800002

Transition metal selenides have been considered as promising alternatives for OER due to their excellent conductivity. Herein, FeOOH-decorated Fe-doped NiSe on NiFe foam (FeOOH@Fe-NiSe@NiFe) was synthesized with an autologous growth approach, where the NiFe foam was used as an Fe and Ni resource. The FeOOH@Fe-NiSe@NiFe electrode exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance with an overpotential of 224 mV at 10 mA cm-2, a small Tafel slope of 52.67 mV dec-1, and remarkable stability. Results confirm that the morphology and electronic structure of designed electrocatalysts can be significantly tailored due to the introduction of Fe. The designed FeOOH@Fe-NiSe@NiFe electrode also possesses superior aerophobicity, which ensures fast mass transfer during water splitting processes. As a result, the electrocatalytic activity is improved remarkably. In addition, the actual active sites of designed electrocatalysts were also systematically investigated. Experimental studies demonstrate that the Fe/NiOOH on the surface of Fe-NiSe, which in situ converses from Fe-NiSe, can serve as the intrinsic active sites toward the OER. Thus, this work can provide a new methodology to designing durable and efficient electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0888-5885			WOS:000798806700006

However, most approaches for fabricating porous carbon electrodes from biomass are highly energy inefficient as they require the breaking down of the biomass and its subsequent reconstitution into powder-like carbon. Here, enzymes are explored to effectively hydrolyze the partial cellulose in bulk raw wood to form a large number of nanopores, which helps to maximally expose the inner parts of the raw wood to sufficiently dope nitrogen onto the carbon skeletons during the subsequent pyrolysis process. The resulting carbons exhibit excellent catalytic activity with respect to the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions. As-fabricated cellulose-digested, carbonized wood plates are mechanically strong, have high conductivity, and contain a crosslinked network and natural ion-transport channels and can be employed directly as metal-free electrodes without carbon paper, polymer binders, or carbon black. When used as metal-free cathodes in zinc-air batteries, they result in a specific capacity of 801 mA h g(-1) and an energy density of 955 W h kg(-1) with the long-term stability of the batteries being as high as 110 h. This work paves the way for the ready conversion of abundant biomass into high-value engineering products for energy-related applications.									217	22	0	0	15	0	224			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000468005400026	30843289

To design such a two-step (chemical + biological) process to treat poorly characterized wastewaters, it is useful to model the time evolution of characteristic global variables, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), in order to develop a useful treatment strategy based upon these classical variables. We consider two simple model reaction networks, requiring three- and five-rate constants, respectively. The first model, proposed recently, involves conversion of a nonbiodegradable species, C, into a single biodegradable intermediate S. Here, biodegradable compounds are immediate kinetic products of oxidation. In general, it is not probable that a single recalcitrant compound undergoes a single-step reaction to CO2. However, when working with complex undefined wastewaters streams, single-step reactions may be used to simplify. The second new model corresponds to a lag time in BOD formation due to the necessity of multiple partial oxidations to reach a first biodegradable intermediate. The second network includes two intermediates, I and S, which are, respectively, nonbiodegradable and biodegradable. We then compare model behavior with an unfortunately sparse literature on BOD and COD values versus time in chemical reactors, and demonstrate the convenience of the first model, and the occasional necessity of the second, which reflects the presence of early intermediates which are nonbiodegradable.									64	3	0	0	39	2	66			0733-9372			WOS:000223363500007

Oxygenous structures of PAN fibers were investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), thermogravimetry-infrared (TGA-FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis (XPS) and chemical titration. The results show that only the carboxyl group of itaconic acid in copolymer PAN precursor is transformed into the anhydride at 150 ℃. At 170 ℃, carboxyl and anhydride groups are removed from PAN fibers in the form of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, while hydroxyl and carbonyl groups are generated from the reaction between oxygen in air and the fibers, of which the carbonyl groups occupy the higher percentage. With heat treatment temperature increasing, the oxidation reaction becomes more violent, as a result, the content of oxygenous groups increases, and parts of the hydroxyl and carbonyl groups are gradually oxidized to carbonyl and lactone structures.			在空气气氛下,对共聚聚丙烯腈(PAN)原丝在不同温度进行恒温热处理,利用红外吸收光谱(FT-IR)、固体核磁谱(NMR)、热失重红外联用仪(TGA-FT-IR)、X射线光电子能谱(XPS)和化学滴定研究了PAN纤维在空气气氛下含氧官能团结构的形成与演变。结果表明,150℃时仅是PAN纤维中共聚单体衣康酸的羧基官能团转化为酸酐官能团;170℃时是共聚单体中的羧基和酸酐结构以CO和CO_2形式从纤维中脱除,而此时空气中的氧与PAN纤维反应形成羰基和羟基结构,羰基含量较多;随着温度进一步提高,氧化反应程度剧烈,含氧结构含量增多,部分形成的羰基和羟基结构被逐步氧化为羧基、内酯结构。						0	3	0	0	0	0	3			1000-7555			CSCD:4934206

The thermal degradation of neat PVB, PVB coated on silica, and PVB coated on silanized silica are compared. Thermal degradation of PVB in contact with silica proceeds through four stages. At low temperature, water is generated due to dehydroxylation. A second stage occurs between 350 and 450-degrees-C, corresponds to the largest sample mass loss, and is characterized by evolution of oxygen-containing species. The third stage occurs between 400 and 600-degrees-C and is characterized by evolution of unsaturated and aromatic species. The last degradation stage occurs between 600 and 800-degrees-C and corresponds to removal of carbon-rich residue by the water-gas reaction. The water-gas reaction is inhibited by the presence of H-2.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			0897-4756			WOS:A1992HC55800043

Currently, several groups have reported a novel metal-chalcogenide arrangement, with the possibility of isolating metals at specific sites on chalcogenides to enhance their properties resulting in a synergistic effect in which both chalcogenide and single-atom metal features are exploited, either as promoters or active sites.

Our study on the oxygen electrodes focuses on specifically the effect of electrode crystal structure and morphology on its electrochemical performance, and the evolution of the electronic and structural properties of the electrodes while under electrochemical conditions and high temperature. We found through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy experiments that the different crystal orientations in a given oxygen electrode material, for example La0.8Sr0.2MnO3+d (LSM), can show different initial performance, dissimilar processes governing the oxygen reaction mechanism, and different electrochemical activation behavior under DC bias at a given temperature in air. Our in-situ x-ray and electrochemical measurements at the Advanced Photon Source have identified the chemical states of the main components of the doped lanthanum manganite electrodes. We found that the bias and time dependent changes in the concentration and in the electronic state of the La (the A-site element of the perovskite) occurring only at the top air-electrode film interface can be responsible from the electrochemical improvement of the electrode under DC current. Our observation related to the La chemical state change is unexpected and probably unique to the electrochemical current-conditioning of the oxygen electrodes.					31st International Conference on Advanced Ceramics and Composites31st International Conference on Advanced Ceramics and Composites	JAN 21-26, 2007JAN 21-26, 2007	Amer Ceram SocAmer Ceram Soc	Daytona Beach, FLDaytona Beach, FL	5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0196-6219	1940-6339	978-0-470-19635-9	WOS:000281438600015

The improvement in active sites due to siloxene was used to increase the catalytic activity. The hierarchical structure of the composite with the synergistic effect of metal oxides helped enhance the catalytic activity to show a low overpotential of 110 mV at 10 mA/cm2 in 1 M KOH and stability at 10 mA/cm2 over 20 h without an obvious change in voltage. The as-prepared catalyst can be a promising electrocatalyst for the HER owing to the low cost of transition metal oxides, the abundance of silicon on Earth, and the simplicity of the synthesis process.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1567-1739	1878-1675		WOS:000869486600005

The laboratory cell was cycled for 50 cycles at the C/2 rate (10 mA cm(-2)). The average discharge/charge voltages of the cell were 0.65 and 1.6 V, respectively.

In the present work, we investigated the formation and destruction of PCDD/F on fly ash as a function of time at 280 degrees C, chlorine mass balance, evolution of the total equivalent toxicity and kinetic modelling. We determined that the volatilization process is negligible and that the reactive processes at short reaction times only become important above 300 degrees C. The results provide a substantial improvement on existing studies. We experimentally demonstrated, for the first time, that there is a correlation between the oxidative breakdown of native carbon and PCDD/F de novo synthesis. Data processing by our kinetic model showed that the formation of oxygen complexes C(O) was the determining step for de novo synthesis of PCDD/F. Indeed, the calculated reaction time at which the PCDD/F concentration was at a maximum (850 min) was greater than that calculated for the oxygen complexes C(O) (435 min). Moreover, the experimental carbon conversion efficiency for PCDD/F production (0.0032% at 600 min maximum) was in a very good agreement with the theoretical conversion (0.0041%).

A simple mathematical model is developed to describe the total current resulting from these simultaneous processes, and results of preliminary tests of this model are in good agreement with experimental data for DMSO oxidation.									37	4	0	0	4	2	39			0003-2700			WOS:000071810400007	21644745

However, experimentally finding an electrocatalyst for specific final products with high efficiency and high selectivity poses serious challenges due to multiple electron transfer, complicated intermediates, and numerous reaction pathways in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. Here, an intrinsic descriptor that correlates the catalytic activity with the topological, bonding, and electronic structures of catalytic centers on M-N-C based single-atom catalysts is discovered. The "volcano"-shaped relationships between the descriptor and catalytic activity are established from which the best single-atom catalysts for CO2 reduction are found. Moreover, the reaction mechanisms, intermediates, reaction pathways, and final products can also be distinguished by this new descriptor. The descriptor can also be used to predict the activity of the single-atom catalysts for electrochemical reactions such as hydrogen evolution, oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in fuel cells and water-splitting. These predictions are confirmed by the experimental results for onset potential and Faraday efficiency. The design principles derived from the descriptors open a door for rational design and rapid screening of highly efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 conversion as well as other electrochemical energy systems.									89	4	0	0	5	0	87			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000489794900001

PCC 6803. However, second-site mutants (pseudorevertants) with restored photoautotrophic growth but still maintaining the E69Q mutation in D2 are easily obtained. Using a genomic mapping technique involving functional complementation, the secondary mutation was mapped to slr0286 in two independent mutants. The mutations in Slr0286 were R42M or R394H. To study the function of Slr0286, mutants of E69Q and of the wild-type strain were made that lacked slr0286. Deletion of slr0286 did not affect photoautotrophic capacity in wild type but led to a marked decrease in the apparent affinity of Ca2+ to its binding site at the water-splitting system of photosystem II and to a reduced heat tolerance of the oxygen-evolving system, particularly in E69Q. Moreover, a small increase in the half-time for photoactivation of the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II for both wild type and the E69Q mutant was observed in the absence of Slr0286. The accumulation of photosystem II reaction centers, dark stability of the oxygen-evolving apparatus, stability of oxygen evolution, and the kinetics of charge recombination between Q(A)(-) and the donor side were not affected by deletion of slr0286. Slr0286 lacks clear functional motifs, and no homologues are apparent in other organisms, even not in other cyanobacteria. In any case, Slr0286 appears to help the functional assembly and stability of the water-splitting system of photosystem II.									15	0	0	0	15	0	15			0006-2960			WOS:000170301100022	11478892

Therefore, it is necessary to study the intrinsic electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution properties of materials. Here, for the first time, we used the 2D NaxWOy as precursor to prepare various W-based compounds (WC1-x, WS2, WP, W2N3, and WN) and compared their electrocatalytic activity of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). WC1-x has the best HER performances with a low overpotential (216 mV in base and 247 mV in acid solutions at 10 mA cm(-2)) and good long-term durability. Furthermore, WC1-x shows low interfacial transfer resistance and large electrochemically active surface areas, suggesting its high conductivity and rich active sites, and thus resulting in the superior electrocatalytic HER activity.

Herein, a green wet-chemical approach was developed to directly prepare hollow Ag44Pt56 nanotube bundles (H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs), utilizing 5-azacytosine as a structure-directing agent. The obtained electrocatalyst displayed superior catalytic activity and durability for HER in acid media, and the great improvement in catalytic performance for ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR) in the alkaline electrolyte, outperforming home-made Ag34Pt66 nanoparticles (NPs), Ag70Pt30 NPs, and commercial Pt/C catalysts. The high electrocatalytic characters are mainly attributed to the special nanostructures and the synergetic effects between the bimetals. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Low-cost and high-efficiency Ni3N electrocatalysts have shown great potential to replace platinum-based (Pt) electrocatalysts. However, the challenge for the practical application of Ni3N electrocatalysts is their very low stability, especially in alkaline solutions. In this research we have developed a novel technology for the modification of Ni3N using a carbon layer containing amorphous cobalt species to form a (Co-C)/Ni3N core/shell composite. The composite catalyst is stable for HER in alkaline solutions. The (Co-C)/Ni3N electrocatalyst (0.7 mol %) has also exhibited excellent durability in a 1.0 M KOH solution. After 5000 electrochemical scanning cycles, the activity loss for (Co-C)/Ni3N is insignificant. This work has introduced a practical approach to the development of highly efficient and sustainable non-noble-metal electrocatalysts for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution under alkaline conditions.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			2168-0485			WOS:000618670600002

We present a novel strategy to realize the traction and stabilization of isolated Pt atoms in the nitrogen-containing porous carbon matrix (Pt@PCM). In comparison with the commercial Pt/C catalyst (20 weight %), the as-prepared Pt@PCM catalyst exhibits significantly boosted mass activity (up to 25 times) for hydrogen evolution reaction. Results of extended x-ray absorption fine structure investigation and density functional theory calculation suggest that the active sites are associated with the lattice-confined Pt centers and the activated carbon (C)/nitrogen (N) atoms at the adjacency of the isolated Pt centers. This strategy may provide insights into constructing highly efficient single-atom catalysts for different energy-related applications.									356	25	0	0	19	0	358			2375-2548			WOS:000426694200052	29372181

The results of structural characterization indicate Pt2FeNi alloy nanoparticles evenly distribute on the surface of DS--NiFe LDH. The sizes of the Pt2FeNi nanoparticles, closely related to their OER performance, could be well-controlled by adjusting the amount of H2PtCl6 addition. The composite structure of as-prepared product was stable during processes of synthesis, exfoliation, self-assembly, and subsequent electrocatalytic OER. Rigorous electrochemical test proving the contributing catalytic active sites was located at the interface between Pt2FeNi and DS--NiFe LDH, and the Ni and Fe were the major active elements while O atoms are adsorption sites. The formation of Pt2FeNi nanoparticles could greatly prompt the reduction of Tafel slope. The best-performing Pt2FeNi/DS--NiFe LDH with a Pt content of 0.98 wt% achieved low overpotential of 204 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 262 mV at 50 mA cm(-2). This work provides a convenient and effective strategy to create additional active sites for enhancing OER performance of NiFe LDH and make contribution to its wide application.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2575-0356		WOS:000637805900001

In this work a serial of nitrogen/sulfur (N/S)-doped graphene catalysts were synthesized by modifying graphene oxide (GO) with cysteine as a NS source and sequential thermal annealing. It is disclosed that the cysteine-GO reaction time shows a significant influence on the ORR activity of N/S-doped graphene. A unique process of oxidation-induced in situ disulfide formation is further found to be involved in the synthesis of optimal N/S-doped graphene, which displays ORR activity superior to commercial Pt/C in alkaline media. This work suggests that the heteroatom source itself and careful optimization of reaction conditions are critical to obtain high performance doped-graphene electrocatalyst. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

It is important to develop a scalable method for synthesis of more efficient Pt-based electrocatalysts with higher activity and stability. In this work, a low-loading Pt-based electrocatalyst (8.0 wt%) is fabricated by the galvanic replacement reaction, presenting well-dispersed Pt nanoparticles adjacent to atomic Ni-N-C complexes (Pt@NiNC). Due to the synergetic effect associated with the nanoscale/atomic scale joint active sites and the strong metal-support interaction, the resulting Pt@NiNC hybrid exhibits better ORR performance and higher mass activity than the benchmark Pt/C, as well as enhanced electrochemical stability.

Particularly, for the slag oxidized at low %VO2 (3vol%O-2), its acid solubility is bad, due to no obvious Fe outward migration happens and particles show extremely dense structure, unfavorable for the subsequent reactions. For the slag oxidized at moderate %VO2 (around 6vol%O-2), its acid solubility can be promoted, since Fe outward migration slightly happens and pores form from the original dense structure. However, for the slag oxidized at high %VO2 (21vol%O-2), since excessive Fe outward migration results in the formation of Fe-deficient M3O5 phase in the particle center, which is hard to be reduced and further leached, its acid solubility is also bad, although more pores form in such cases.									1	1	0	0	0	0	2			1611-3683	1869-344X		WOS:000414464400009

Eleven presolar silicates and eight presolar oxides were identified in the primitive carbonaceous chondrite Acfer 094 for abundances of 325 and 360 parts per million (ppm), respectively. In addition, nine presolar silicates and five presolar oxide grains were identified in the CO3 chondrite ALHA 77307, for abundances of 320 and 200 ppm, respectively. These abundances, which are matrix-normalized and corrected for instrumental detection efficiencies, are much higher than those of other presolar phases, with the exception of nanodiamonds, although the latter may not all be presolar. The chemical compositions of six presolar silicate grains from ALHA 77307 were elucidated by Auger spectroscopy. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of one presolar silicate grain revealed a nonstoichiometric composition and an amorphous structure as indicated by the diffuse electron diffraction pattern. The oxygen isotopic compositions of the presolar silicates indicate origins in red giant and asymptotic giant branch stars. Analysis of the Si isotopic compositions of 10 presolar silicates provides further constraints on the effects of Galactic chemical evolution.									136	2	1	0	1	0	139			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000244336900052

Experimental conditions were selected as: reaction temperature was 1200 degreesC; oxygen content was 10%, 30% and 50%, and the residence time varied from 0.6 to 2.4 s. The experimental results show that increasing the oxygen content significantly improved the combustibility of sludge. Sludge with high volatile matter, e.g., 70.8% in sludge B, could not combust completely even at 50% O-2, which is due to the fact that the formed ash surrounded the combusting char, it acted as a resistance for the diffusion of oxygen to unburnt carbon. Accordingly, about 2-6% unburnt carbon, having particle size of about 1.5 mum, was kept in the ash. In addition, at low oxygen content, the major mineral compounds in sludge, including calcium oxide, phosphorus oxide and aluminosilicate, mainly underwent coalescence within char to form the large molten agglomerates. Increasing oxygen content resulted in the rapid decomposition of sludge, and accordingly, many droplets were formed and condensed into fine particles. Finally, the vaporization model for both sodium and zinc was built considering the internal diffusion of both two elements with char and their reaction with phosphates. The simulation results had a fairly good consistence with experiments. Sodium was mainly released under the controlling of its internal mass-transfer diffusion within ash layer. Conversely, zinc was released under the controlling of both internal mass-transfer diffusion and its reaction with molten phosphate salts. Improving oxygen content mitigated the diffusion resistance in ash layer, and hence, more the sodium and zinc were vaporized. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Small molecule oxidation reactions with lower working potentials, such as methanol oxidation reactions, are good alternatives to OER with faster kinetics. However, the typically employed Ni-based electrocatalysts have poor activity and stability. Herein, a novel three-dimensional (3D)-networking Mo-doped Ni(OH)(2) with ultralow Ni-Ni coordination is synthesized, which exhibits a high MOR activity of 100 mA cm(-2) at 1.39 V, delivering 28 mV dec(-1 )for the Tafel slope. Meanwhile, hydrogen evolution with value-added formate co-generation is boosted with a current density of more than 500 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 2.00 V for 50 h, showing excellent stability in an industrial alkaline concentration (6 M KOH). Mechanistic studies based on density functional theory and X-ray absorption spectroscopy showed that the improved performance is mainly attributed to the ultralow Ni-Ni coordination, 3D-networking structures and Mo dopants, which improve the catalytic activity, increase the active site density and strengthen the Ni(OH)(2) 3D-networking structures, respectively. This study paves a new way for designing electrocatalysts with enhanced activity and durability for industrial energy-saving hydrogen production.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000864682800003	36203066

Herein, three-dimensional (3D) phosphorus-anion-decorated cobalt disulfide hollow nanosheet arrays are uniformly deposited on carbon cloth (P-CoS2 HNA/CC) through a MOF-based growth-sulfidation-phosphorization approach. Benefiting from the moderated electronic structure, maximum exposure of active surface sites and the unique 3D hollow conductive architecture, the optimal P-CoS2 HNA/CC delivers superior electrocatalytic activity with extremely low overpotentials of 250 and 80 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER in alkaline conditions, respectively. The corresponding two-electrode electrolyzer for overall water splitting requires a cell voltage of 1.56 V to attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), close to commercial IrO2/CC parallel to Pt/C/CC couple (1.55 V). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that decoration of Panions into CoS2 electrocatalysts not only significantly tunes adsorption energetics of H- and O-containing intermediates, but also offers additional active sites for OER/HER process, dramatically boosting the catalytic activity of P-CoS2 HNA/CC. This work may shed some new light on the design of advanced and high-active electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									48	5	0	0	5	0	48			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000522640100062

We report herein that a Cu/Cu3P nanoarray catalyst was directly grown on the surfaces of Cu nanosheets from its Cu/CuO nanoarray precursor by a low-temperature phosphidation process. In particular, the effects of phosphating distance, mass ratio and temperature on the morphology of Cu/Cu3P nanoarrays were studied in detail. This nanoarray, as an electrocatalyst, displays excellent catalytic performance and long-term stability in an acid solution for electrochemical hydrogen generation. Specifically, the Cu/Cu3P nanoarray-270 exhibits a low onset overpotential (96 mV) and a small Tafel slope (131 mV dec(-1)).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4344		WOS:000831402200001

On-line FTIR analysis of evolved gases from pyrolysis reveals marked structural differences in a series of Spanish coals varying in rank from peat to bituminous. Using slow heating conditions the pyrolysis reactions were resolved into separate peaks for the evolution of individual species such as CO2, CO, CH4 and sulphur compounds, giving information on oxygen-containing functional groups, coal decomposition temperature and the thermal stability of sulphur structures. Furthermore, kinetic parameters such as activation energies and frequency factors for these reactions can be calculated from the gas evolution profiles.Additional information on structural units present in coal was obtained by studying pyrolysis tars. The structural parameters deduced from FTIR data indicated that tars seem to be structurally related to parent coals, although, they have higher aliphatic hydrogen content and aromaticity.									44	2	0	0	7	0	46			0165-2370			WOS:A1991GC78900015

However, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) hinders the energy input utilization, and the added value of the product O-2 is low. Here, through a combined CO2RR and selective methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), we report an efficient and unas-sisted solar-driven simultaneous cathodic and anodic production of formate on hydroxide-derived self-selective Cu-based electrocata-lysts. Upon in situ treatments, Cu(OH)(2)-derived Cu (HOD-Cu) and CuO (HOD-CuO) electrocatalysts display efficient CO2RR and MOR performances at a wide potential range, respectively. The rational integration of the electrolyzer to a triple junction GalnP/GaAs/Ge photovoltaic cell could realize efficient solar-driven formate synthesis, leading to a solar-to-formate (STF) conversion efficiency of 3.63% and a production rate of 0.194 mmol h(-1) cm (-2). This work demonstrates a simultaneous formate generation by coupling CO2RR and MOR, providing new paths for solar-driven electrochemical synthesis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2666-3864		WOS:000839600200001

Herein, a novelty of precious metal-free, iron, nitrogen and phosphorus-doped porous carbon (Fe@NPC) was prepared by using cheap and renewable biomass silk as basic nitrogen sources, as an efficient ORR and MOR electrocatalyst with its high nitrogen content (8.16 wt%). The Fe@NPC catalyst exhibits extremely high onset potential (1.125 V vs RHE), current density (-6.089 mA cm(-2)) and methanol tolerance for ORR, even exceeds the corresponding values of Pt/C (1.007 V vs RHE, 5.068 mA cm(-2)).

To fundamentally understand the relation of activity with specific defect, control of defect type in carbon is indispensable and unfortunately still remains a great challenge to date. Here, we developed a general edge-engineering method to produce a class of definitive defect configurations converted from corresponding specific nitrogen (N) doping sites. Theoretical simulations provide the fundamental capability and the design principles. Experimentally, structural characterizations clearly elucidate the specific oneto-one conversion of confirmative N configuration to carbon defect; e.g., graphitic-N to divacancy (C585), pyridinic-N to separate pentagon (S-C5), and pyrrolic-N to adjacent pentagons (A-C5), respectively. For electrocatalysis, A-C5 defects show the highest intrinsic activity in oxygen reduction reaction, whereas C585 defects perform the best in hydrogen evolution reaction. This work provides the main guidance in design of carbon-based catalysts via control of target defect synthesis.									54	3	0	0	2	0	55			2451-9294			WOS:000558679600016

However, the slow reaction kinetics and high overpotential of this process will result in low energy conversion efficiency. Therefore, it is of great practical value to research low-cost, efficient, and stable transition-metal-based bifunctional electrocatalysts. Herein, Fe-Co Prussian blue analogue (PBA) was coated with Ni-Co PBA to prepare the trimetallic PBA precursor, and the trimetallic phosphate (Fe-Co-Ni-P-1) has been prepared via the low-temperature phosphating process. The effects of metal ratios, the amount of sodium hypophosphite, and phosphating temperature on the catalytic performances were studied. When Fe-Co-Ni-P-1 was used as an electrocatalyst, the overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction was 247 and 215 mV, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). At the same time, Fe-Co-Ni-P-1 showed faster kinetics and better long-term stability in the catalytic process. The catalytic performances of unary metal, binary metal, and ternary metal phosphides, oxides, and sulfides were systematically studied. It is demonstrated that the ternary metal phosphide Fe-Co-Ni-P-1 manifests the best catalytic performance, which is mainly attributed to the monodisperse core-shell structure, low resistance, large electrochemical active area, and the synergistic effect among metals.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000682991300084	34282615

It was found that the hydrogen evolution rate of C@TiO2-x/CNNS was 417.2 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) under visible light irradiation, which was much higher than that of other prepared photocatalysts in solar water splitting process at the same conditions, and obvious decrease in catalytic activity can be observed after three recycles. The formation of carbon layer on the surface of TiO2-x can effectively protect Ti3+ and oxygen vacancies (O-vs) from oxidation by air and dissolved O-2, afterwards much more Ti3+/O-vs are exsited, which can serve as charge carrier traps to inhibit the recombination of light-excited electrons-holes. Therefore, C@TiO2-x/CNNS showed a highly conductivity, rapidly effective electron-hole separation and lower transmission resistance comprehensive consideration of the advantages of carbon layer and hetero-junction, which are of great benefit to the improvement of photocatalytic performance. Hence, a new catalytic tactic namely layer-protection effect was founded and this strategy for boosting hydrogen evolution and protection Ti3+/O-vs may give us some hints on the design of photocatalytic systems.									50	2	0	0	5	0	50			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000454137400006

Electrodes prepared at T < 400-degrees-C are poorly active, being subjected mainly to bulk oxide reduction. Those prepared at T greater-than-or-equal-to 400-degrees-C show two different Tafel slopes (about 40 mV and 120 mV) at low and high overpotentials respectively. The observed reaction order of -0.5 with the Tafel slope of 40 mV suggests a mechanism in which the second electron transfer is rate determining while the oxide surface experiences acid-base equilibria. Tafel slopes determined between 5-degrees-C and 45-degrees-C have shown temperature dependence close to theoretical expectations. which suggests that these surfaces conform to classical kinetic models better than metal surfaces since double-layer and impurity effects are minimized. Open-circuit potentials before and after H-2 evolution, the origin of uncompensated ohmic drops and electrocatalytic activity as a function of calcination temperature are also discussed.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			0022-0728			WOS:A1993MC26900005

Here, carbon fiber-supported porous nickel phosphide nanosheets have been used to decorate ruthenium nanoclusters (CF@P-Ni2P/Ru) to generate a hybrid catalyst. The synthesized CF@P-Ni2P/Ru catalyst with multiple- interfaces exhibits overpotential as low as only 45 and 112 mV to deliver current of -10 and -100 mA cm(geo)(-2), respectively, and long stability of at least 100 h to achieve -10 mA cm(geo)(-2). Dual-pathway kinetic analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the hybrids of P-Ni2P and Ru enable stronger water dissociation at the interface of P-Ni2P/Ru and lower the energy barrier of Volmer step, which is beneficial for the HER. Such unique hybrid structure and superior performance provides an important route to fabricating advanced electrocatalysts.									24	2	0	0	3	0	25			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000542320300002

In this work, the effects of Ag content and surface plating with beta-PbO2 on the anodic behavior and reaction kinetics were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), anodic polarization curves, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and corrosion rate test. The phase composition and microscopic morphology of the anode oxide layers after electrolysis were observed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. The results indicate that high content of silver and electroplating beta-PbO2 layer can increase the oxygen evolution activity, electrocatalytic activity and corrosion resistance of the anodes. Al/Pb-0.75%Ag plating beta-PbO2 has the lowest oxygen evolution overpotential followed by Al/Pb-0.3%Ag plating beta-PbO2, Al/Pb-0.75%Ag and Al/Pb-0.3%Ag. Besides, high content of silver is more beneficial to improving corrosion resistance compared with electroplating beta-PbO2 on anode. In addition, the phase composition of four anodes layer are mainly composed of alpha-PbO2, beta-PbO2, Pb and PbO.									3	3	0	0	0	0	5			1002-185X			WOS:000441099900008

In conventional electrolyzers, hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions at the two electrodes run at the same temperature. In this work, we implement an asymmetric temperature modulation to enhance the water electrolysis rate in an alkaline solution. We revisit the thermodynamics of water electrolysis and determine by both simulations and experiments that the Gibbs free energy change required for alkaline water electrolysis under asymmetric temperature is lower than that under uniform average temperature. With the temperature difference of 40 K (possible for low-grade waste heat), the required voltage of asymmetric configuration decreases by 100 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) compared to the system operated at the same average temperature. Moreover, the thermal efficiency reaches a maximum value of 7% under optimized operating current density. The asymmetric-temperature water electrolysis opens a promising way for utilization of low-grade heat.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0003-6951	1077-3118		WOS:000670035400009

The OER activities of most metal oxide catalysts were measured at relatively low current density (i.e., 10 mA cm(-2)) by using an ink-painted electrode because most metal oxides are synthesized as a powder. The ink-painted electrodes are unstable under high current densities, for example at 400 mA cm(-2) which is the practical operation condition of AWE. Therefore, long-term durability test of powder metal oxide catalysts under practical condition has been quite limited, using the ink-painted electrodes. Here, we demonstrate a novel pressure-bonded electrode which is suitable for the measurement of OER activities of powdery catalysts under practical conditions (>400 mA cm(-2)). A perovskite oxide, LaNiO3, was used as a model catalyst. The pressure-bonded electrodes were prepared by uniaxial press at 262 MPa, cold isostatic press at 300 MPa, and calcination at 800 degrees C. The catalyst film was stable in the cyclic voltammetry measurements with the upper limit of the geometrical current density ca. 1800 mA cm(-2) for 200 cycles. The specific activity of LaNiO3 was maximized when the loading amount was ca. 1 mg cm(-2). The measured OER current density at the loading amount 1.2 mg cm(-2) was higher than the most values reported in the literature at ca. 1.6 V vs. RHE and almost the same as the highest value, implying that the OER activity of the pressure-bonded electrodes mostly reflected the intrinsic activity of LaNiO3. Because of the high stability of the pressure-bonded electrodes, the long-term stability test was successfully performed at 400 mA cm(-2) for 512 h. The increase in the iR-corrected cell voltage was 0.17 mV h(-1). Consequently, the pressure-bonded electrode is shown to be useful to evaluate the electrode performance, such as long-term stability and accelerated durability tests, under practical current density.

In this work, we introduce Ca into the B site of BaNbO2N to form a complex perovskite BaNb1-x/3Cax/3O2+yN1-y (0 <= x, y <= 1). The presence of Ca in BaNbO2N has great impact on a number of important properties such as band gap value, nitrogen content, surface hydrophilicity, and defects levels. In particular, defects such as Nb4+ species are effectively suppressed in Ca-modified BaNbO2N. More importantly, photocatalytic activity of BaNbO2N for water oxidation reactions is substantially improved after Ca modifications. Compared with pristine BaNbO2N, more than twofold enhancement in photocatalytic oxygen evolution is observed for BaNb0.8Ca0.2O2+yN1-y (x = 0.6). Such improvements probably stem from the suppression of Nb4+ species in the structure as well as enhanced surface hydrophilicity after Ca modification. The facile approach by incorporating alkaline earth cations into crystal structure can be well extended to other perovskite oxynitrides whose photocatalytic activity is subject to those defective species.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000478649200048

J	Xu, TF; White, SP; Pruess, K; Brimhall, GH								Modeling of pyrite oxidation in saturated and unsaturated subsurface flow systems								TRANSPORT IN POROUS MEDIA				39	1			25	56		10.1023/A:1006518725360				APR 2000	2000	Pyrite oxidation (FeS2) causes acidification and mobilization of metals. Mathematical modeling of pyrite oxidation in variably saturated reactive flow systems is challenging because (1) it occurs through a complex interplay of multi-phase flow and transport processes, and (2) aqueous concentrations of key species vary over tens orders of magnitude in different redox conditions. Here, we present a general multi-phase reactive transport model for redox processes. Two alternative implementations were made in the TOUGHREACT and TOUGH2-CHEM simulation codes which use sequential iteration and simultaneous solution, respectively. Both codes are used to simulate a fully and a variably saturated pyrite oxidation problem with simple 1-D flow and reaction conditions. Results from both codes indicate that the effects of oxygen partial pressure reduction due to reactions on the fluid flow is not significant under ambient conditions. However, it must be noted that when fluid flow and chemical reactions are strongly coupled, such as when boiling takes place in geothermal reservoirs, this could be essential. The fully simultaneous approach has a complete process description. The sequential iteration approach is found to be more efficient computationally. The oxygen gas diffusion process plays a dominant role in the chemical evolution for pyrite oxidation in unsaturated conditions. An example in 2-D fractured rock is presented to demonstrate pyrite oxidation under complex flow and geochemical conditions. This example shows that pyrite oxidation exerts strong influence on hydrogeochemical evolution in variably saturated flow systems. The alteration of primary rock minerals and the development of secondary mineral assemblages predicted are consistent with field observations. This example serves as a prototype for oxidative weathering processes with broad significance for geoscientific, engineering, and environmental applications.									46	1	0	0	8	0	47			0169-3913	1573-1634		WOS:000085449500002

Coulometry, as well as visible reflectometry, are fast and simple methods for determining the thickness of thin anodic oxide films on Titanium (99.9%) and a titanium alloy (TiAlV6-4). A comparison of the results shows the specific disadvantages and limitations of each method. On the one hand, the reflectometry yields a too-small film thickness and the authors therefore developed a simple correction algorithm for the reflectometric data. On the other hand, coulometry is not suitable as a thickness determination in the case of side reactions such as oxygen evolution. However, the complementary approach to the thickness determination, by using both reflectometry and coulometry, brings reliable thickness values of visible reflectometry down to >= 5 nm. Furthermore, the comparison between coulometry and reflectometry allows the estimation of the current efficiency when the oxide formation is attended by side reactions.

Herein, we study the active surfaces of layered lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) using the enhancement effect of electrochemical delithiation (De-LCO). Our theoretical results indicate that the most stable (0001) surface has a very large overpotential for OER independent of lithium content. In contrast, edge sites such as the nonpolar (11 (2) over bar0) and polar (01 (1) over bar2) surfaces are predicted to be highly active and dependent on (de)lithiation. The effect of lithium extraction from LCO on the surfaces and their OER activities can be understood by the increase of Co4+ sites relative to Co3+ and by the shift of active oxygen 2p states. Experimentally, it is demonstrated that LCO nanosheets, which dominantly expose the (0001) surface show negligible OER enhancement upon delithiation. However, a noticeable increase in OER activity (similar to 0.1 V in overpotential shift at 10 mA cm(-2)) is observed for the LCO nanoparticles, where the basal plane is greatly diminished to expose the edge sites, consistent with the theoretical simulations. Additionally, we find that the OER activity of De-LCO nanosheets can be improved if we adopt an acid etching method on LCO to create more active edge sites, which in turn provides a strong evidence for the theoretical indication.									117	4	0	0	10	0	117			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000400802300043	28418250

Various methods have been investigated to obtain high catalytic activity, but in these synthetic processes other active materials are inevitably introduced to modify or load onto the surface of the TMP to further improve the catalytic performance. Herein, we describe a novel approach for preparing CoP/CoP2 structures (650 degrees C) by pyrolysis of a complex formed from Co ions crosslinked with phytic acid (PA) using 2-methylimidazole (MeIM). The integration of CoP2 and CoP in the structures can enhance the intrinsic electrical conductivity, and facilitate electron transfer from solution to the electrode. Overpotentials of only 250 and 239 mV were required to support the current densities of 10 and 20 mAcm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, respectively, demonstrating the potential of the novel material for practical overall water splitting.									88	5	0	0	4	0	90			2196-0216			WOS:000425380200018

In order to study the roles of lipids in photosystem II (PSII), we treated the PSII core dimer complex from a thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus vulcanus with phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) and lipase, and examined their effects on PSII structure and function. PLA(2)-treatment decreased the content of phospholipid, phosphatidylglycerol (PG) by 59%, leading to a decrease of oxygen evolution by 40%. On the other hand, although treatment with lipase specifically decreased the content of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) by 52%, it decreased oxygen evolution only by 16%. This indicates that PG plays a more important role in PSII than MGDG. Both PLA(2)- and lipase-treatments induced neither the dissociation of PSII dimer, nor any loss of polypeptides. The degradation of PG resulted in a damage to the Q(B)-binding site as demonstrated from photoreduction activity of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol and chlorophyll fluorescence yields in the absence or presence of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)1,1-dimethylurea, and the dependencies of oxygen evolution on various electron acceptors before and after PLA(2)- or lipase-treatments. However, there were approximately three and five molecules of PG and MGDG per PSII reaction center left in the PSII dimeric complex after the PLA(2)- and lipase-treatments. These lipids are therefore bound to the interior of the protein matrix and resistant to the lipase treatments. The resistance of these lipids against PLA(2)- and lipase-treatments may be a specific feature of PSII from the thermophilic cyanobacterium, suggesting a possible correlation between binding of lipids and thermostability of PSII.									16	1	0	0	14	0	17			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000261577900040	18668340

In particular, the overpotential of the OER is relatively higher than the HER, and thus, it is considered that one of the important methods to enhance the performance of the electrocatalyst is to reduce the overpotential of the OER. We report effects of incorporation of metalloid into Ni(OH)(2) microcrystal on electrocatalytic activities. In this study, Te incorporated Ni(OH)(2) (chi Te-Ni(OH)(2)) were grown on three-dimensional porous NF by a facile solvothermal method with chi = 1, 3 and 5. Homogeneous microplate structure on the NF was clearly observed for the Ni(OH)(2)/NF and chi Te-Ni(OH)(2)/NF samples. However, irregular and collapsed nanostructures were found on the surface of nickel foam when Te precursor ratio is (chi) over 3. Electrocatalytic OER properties were analysed by Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The amount of Te incorporation used in the electrocatalytic reaction was found to play a crucial role in improving catalytic activity. The optimum Te amount (chi) introduced into the Ni(OH)(2)/NF was discussed with respect to their OER performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1225-1429	2234-5078		WOS:000668574100007

Herein, we report the in situ deposition of numerous ultrafine PdIr alloy nanowires (diameter of 1.8 nm) to predominately cover the entire surface of graphene (PdIr UNWs/WFG). The high density but low atom loading (8.6 at%) of PdIr nanowires gives rise to abundant edge atoms and a rough surface, which are beneficial for the full exposure of active sites. Meanwhile, the compact PdIr overlay provides strong surface tension to stretch the graphene wrinkles, thus averting the wrapping of active sites and ensuring structural uniformity. The PdIr UNWs/WFG are qualified as efficient and robust electrocatalysts in both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), affording 10 mA cm(-2) at an HER overpotential of 23 mV and 10 mA cm(-2) at an OER overpotential of 290 mV, respectively. The corresponding water electrolyzer requires a cell voltage of only 1.51 V to achieve a water-splitting current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This simple and novel approach for studying the coordinated form, dispersion state, and interfacial tension is promising to be a versatile method for improving the properties of graphene-based nanomaterials.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000484297400005	31259330

Carbonization and physical activation were applied to modify the textural properties, while nitrogen functionalities were incorporated via different N-doping methodologies (ball milling and conventional methods) using melamine. A direct relationship between the microporosity of the activated carbons and the limiting current density was found, with the increase of microporosity leading to interesting improvements of the limiting current density. Regardless of the doping method used, similar amounts of nitrogen were incorporated into the carbon structures. However, significant differences were observed in the nitrogen functionalities according to the doping method applied: ball milling appeared to originate preferentially quaternary and oxidized nitrogen groups, while the formation of pyridinic and pyrrolic groups was favoured by conventional doping. The onset potential was improved and the two-electron mechanism of the original activated sample was shifted closer to a four-electron pathway due to the presence of nitrogen. Interestingly, the high pyridinic content related to a high ratio of pyridinic/quaternary nitrogen results in an increase of the onset potential, while a decrease in the quaternary/pyrrolic nitrogen ratio favors an increase in the number of electrons. Accordingly, the electrocatalyst with the highest performance was obtained from the activated sample doped with nitrogen by the conventional method, which combined the most appropriate textural and chemical properties: high microporosity and adequate proportion of the nitrogen functionalities.									22	1	0	0	0	0	22			2190-4286			WOS:000468725800001	31165035

Transition-metal oxides (TMOs) have attracted much attention to OER catalysts because of their earth abundance, tunable electronic properties, and so forth. Defect engineering is a general and the most important strategy to tune the electronic structure and control size, and thus improve their intrinsic activities. Herein, OER performance on spinel CuCo2O4 was greatly enhanced through cation substitution and size reduction. Ce-substituted spinel CuCe delta Co2-delta Ox (delta = 0.45, 0.5 and 0.55) nanoparticles in the quantum dot scale (2-8 nm) were synthesized using a simple and facile phase-transfer coprecipitation strategy. The as-prepared samples were highly dispersed and have displayed a low overpotential of 294 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 57.5 mV.dec(-1), which outperform commercial RuO2 and the most high-performance analogous catalysts reported. The experimental and calculated results all confirm that Ce substitution with an appropriate content can produce rich oxygen vacancies, tune intermediate absorption, consequently lower the energy barrier of the determining step, and greatly enhance the OER activity of the catalysts. This work not only provides advanced OER catalysts but also opens a general avenue to understand the structure-activity relationship of pristine TMO catalysts deeply in the quantum dot scale and the rational design of more efficient OER catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000753447800063	34839658

The active site cycles among five oxidation states, which are called the S-n states. PSII purification procedures include the use of the cosolvents, sucrose and/or glycerol, to stabilize water splitting activity and for cryoprotection. In this study, the effects of sucrose and glycerol on PSII were investigated. Sucrose addition was observed to stimulate the steady-state rate of oxygen evolution in the range from 0 to 1.35 M. Glycerol addition was observed to stimulate oxygen evolution in the range from 0 to 30%. Both cosolvents were observed to be inhibitory at higher concentrations. Sucrose addition was shown to have no effect on the rate of Q(A)(-) oxidation or on the K-M for exogenous acceptor. PSII was then treated to remove extrinsic proteins. In these samples, sucrose addition stimulated activity, but glycerol addition was inhibitory at concentrations higher than similar to0.5 M. This inhibitory effect of glycerol at relatively low concentrations is attributed to glycerol binding to the active site, when extrinsic subunits are not present. Reaction induced FTIR spectra, associated with the S-1 to S-2 transition of the water-oxidizing complex, exhibited significant differences throughout the 1,800 - 1,200 cm(-1) region, when glycerol- and sucrose-containing samples were compared. These measurements suggest a cosolvent-induced shift in the pK(A) of an aspartic or glutamic acid side chain, as well as structural changes at the active site. These structural alterations are attributed to a change in preferential hydration of the oxygen-evolving complex.									19	0	1	0	12	0	20			0006-3495			WOS:000184428300056	12885674

However, for some semiconductor materials, e.g. tin dioxide (SnO2) and tungsten oxide (WO3), the water oxidation process generally proceeds following the two-electron pathway with rather high driving potential for the generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2 or HO2-). In this work, efficient electronic configuration modulation of SnO2 nanoparticles was realized by non-metallic phosphorus (P) doping, giving rise to the considerable transformation into a four-electron transfer-governed water oxidation reaction with the electrocatalytic activity even comparable to the benchmark RuO2 nanoparticles. These results validate the great potential in remarkably tuning the electrocatalytic performance of transition metal compound electrocatalysts with non-metallic element dopants.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2052-1553			WOS:000719434500001

Herein, a polarization engineering strategy is demonstrated by grafting (thio)urea functional groups onto covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs), giving rise to significantly promoted charge separation/transport and obviously enhanced proton transfer. The thiourea-functionalized CTF (Bpt-CTF) presents a substantial improvement in the photocatalytic H2O2 production rate to 3268.1 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) with no sacrificial agents or cocatalysts that is over an order of magnitude higher than unfunctionalized CTF (Dc-CTF), and a remarkable quantum efficiency of 8.6% at 400 nm. Mechanistic studies reveal the photocatalytic performance is attributed to the prominently enhanced two-electron oxygen reduction reaction by forming endoperoxide at the triazine unit and highly concentrated holes at the thiourea site. The generated O-2 from water oxidation is subsequently consumed by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), thereby boosting overall reaction kinetics. The findings suggest a powerful functional-groups-mediated polarization engineering method for the development of highly efficient metal-free polymer-based photocatalysts.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000806008000001	35524761

We now report the preparation of three conceptually different (oxo)molybdenum(V) corroles for testing if proton-assisted 2-electron reduction will lead to hyper-reactive molybdenum(III) capable of converting protons to hydrogen gas. The upto 670 mV differences in the [(oxo)Mo(IV)]/[(oxo)Mo(III)](-2) redox potentials of the dissolved complexes came into effect by the catalytic onset potential for proton reduction thereby, significantly earlier than their reduction process in the absence of acids, but the two more promising complexes were not stable at practical conditions. Under heterogeneous conditions, the smallest and most electron-withdrawing catalyst did excel by all relevant criteria, including a 97% Faradaic efficiency for catalyzing HER from acidic water. This suggests complexes based on molybdenum, the only sustainable heavy transition metal, as catalysts for other yet unexplored green-energy-relevant processes.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2589-0042		WOS:000686897200108	34430813

Fong, Dillon/0000-0001-5930-8243			Defect-Driven Oxide Transformations and the Electrochemical Interphase								ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH				54	15			3039	3049		10.1021/acs.accounts.1c00248		JUL 2021		AUG 3 2021	2021	The redox reaction pathway is crucial to the sustainable production of the fuels and chemicals required for a carbon-neutral society. Our society is becoming increasingly dependent on devices using batteries and electrolyzers, all of which rely on a series of redox reactions. The overall properties of oxide materials make them very well suited for such electrochemical and catalytic applications due to their associated cationic redox properties and the static site-adsorbate interactions. As these technologies have matured, it has become apparent that defect-driven redox reactions, defect-coupled diffusion, and structural transformations that are both time- and rate-dependent are also critical materials processes. This change in focus, considering not only redox properties but also more complex, dynamic behaviors, represents a new research frontier in the molecular sciences as they are strongly linked to device operation and degradation and lie at the heart of various phenomena that take place at electrochemical interfaces. Fundamental studies of the structural, electronic, and chemical transformation mechanisms are key to the advancement of materials and technological innovations that could be implemented in various electrochemical systems.In this Account, we focus on recent studies and advances in characterizing and understanding the dynamic redox evolution and structural transformations that take place in model perovskites and layered oxides under reactive conditions and correlate them with degradation mechanisms and operations in electrolyzers and batteries. We show that the dynamic evolution of oxygen vacancies and cationic migration in the surface or bulk occurs at the solid-liquid interface, using a combination of different synchrotron-based Xray spectroscopies and scattering probes. Detailed redox-structure-reactivity correlation studies show how defects and diffusion processes can be tailored to drive various physical and chemical transformations in electrolyzers and batteries. We also highlight a strong correlation between oxygen redox reactivity and structural reorganization in both model thin films and particles, helping to bridge the gap between fundamental studies of the reaction mechanism and device applications. On the basis of these findings, we discuss strategies to probe and tune the redox reactivity and structural stability of the redox-active oxide interphase toward devising efficient pathways for energy and chemical harvesting.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000683355900004	34297550

All available evidence supports the hypothesis that the photosynthetic reaction center (RC)the pigment-protein complex in which electromagnetic energy (i.e., photons of visible or near-infrared light) is converted to chemical energy usable by an organismarose once in Earth's history. This event took place over 3billion years ago and the basic architecture of the RC has diversified into the distinct versions that now exist. Using our recent 2.2-angstrom X-ray crystal structure of the homodimeric photosynthetic RC from heliobacteria, we have performed a robust comparison of all known RC types with available structural data. These comparisons have allowed us to generate hypotheses about structural and functional aspects of the common ancestors of extant RCs and to expand upon existing evolutionary schemes. Since the heliobacterial RC is homodimeric and loosely binds (and reduces) quinones, we support the view that it retains more ancestral features than its homologs from other groups. In the evolutionary scenario we propose, the ancestral RC predating the division between Type I and Type II RCs was homodimeric, loosely bound two mobilequinones, and performed an inefficient disproportionation reaction to reduce quinone to quinol. The changes leading to the diversification into Type I and Type II RCs were separate responses to the need to optimize this reaction: the Type I lineage added a [4Fe-4S] cluster to facilitate double reduction of a quinone, while the Type II lineage heterodimerized and specialized the two cofactor branches, fixing the quinone in the Q(A) site. After the Type I/II split, an ancestor to photosystem I fixed its quinone sites and then heterodimerized to bind PsaC as a new subunit, as responses to rising O-2 after the appearance of the oxygen-evolving complex in an ancestor of photosystem II. These pivotal events thus gave rise to the diversity that we observe today.									31	0	2	0	24	0	33			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000447767200002	29603081

Tafel analysis is widely used to gain mechanistic insights, and in some cases, has been used to determine the reaction mechanism. In this Perspective, we discuss the mechanistic insights that can be gained from Tafel analysis and its limitations using the simplest two-electron CO2 reduction reaction to CO on Au and Ag surfaces as an example. By comparing and analyzing existing as well as additional kinetic data, we show that the Tafel slopes obtained on Au and Ag surfaces in the kinetically controlled region (low overpotential) are consistently similar to 59 mV dec(-1), regardless of whether catalysts are polycrystalline or nanostructured in nature, suggesting that the initial electron transfer (CO2 + e(-) -> CO2-) is unlikely to be the rate-limiting step. In addition, we demonstrate how initial mechanistic assumptions can dictate experimental design, the result of which could in turn bias mechanistic interpretations. Therefore, as informative as Tafel analysis is, independent experimental and computational techniques are necessary to support a proposed mechanism of multielectron electrocatalytic reactions, such as CO2 reduction.									120	2	0	0	12	0	119			2155-5435			WOS:000444364800042		
J	Xu, Shuai; Tong, Jinlin; Liu, Yuan; Hu, Wei; Zhang, Ganbing; Xia, Qinghua								Hydrothermal synthesis of Co3O4 nanowire electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction								JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY				8	4					044703	10.1063/1.4961432				JUL 2016	2016	Herein, we reported a well-controlled hydrothermal synthesis of Co3O4 nanowires using CoSO4 as a cobalt precursor and glycerol as a morphological directing agent. Scanning electron microscopy was employed to observe the growth of nanowires. As an important synthetic parameter, reaction time is spanned from 4 to 24 h, which played an important role in the morphology and properties of materials. When the reaction time was 4 h, the resulting Co3O4 nanoparticles assembled into some short nanorods. While increasing the reaction time, the nanorods grew into long nanowires with large aspect ratio, and then attached into bundles when the reaction time was extended up to 24 h. Electrochemical characterization shows that Co3O4 nanowires prepared by hydrothermal reaction for 12 h exhibited the highest catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) among all synthesized nanowires and nanoparticles using the similar method. The enhanced OER activity of the 12 h-prepared Co3O4 nanowires should be attributed to the increased electroactive surface area because observed from the cyclic voltammogram, the 12 h-prepared Co3O4 nanowires possessed the highest surface area among all tested samples. It was also illustrated that there existed a close correlation of the OER catalytic activity with the transition of oxidation state and the density of activity sites of the catalyst exposing to the electrolyte solution during the electrolysis. Though both Co3O4 nanowires and nanoparticles exhibited a considerable loss in OER activity during the stability testing, after polarization for 4 h at 1.7V (versus a reversible hydrogen electrode), the Co3O4 nanowires still produced the higher catalytic current than that of the Co3O4 nanoparticles showing a slightly higher stability than the particles because of the nanowire structure.

Herein, a cost-effective approach to synthesize nitrogen-and sulfur-codoped carbon nanowire aerogels using a hard templating method is proposed. The aerogels prepared using a combination of hydrothermal treatment and carbonization exhibit good catalytic activity for the ORR in alkaline solution. At the optimal annealing temperature and mass ratio between the nitrogen and sulfur precursors, the resultant aerogels show comparable electrocatalytic activity to that of a commercial Pt/C catalyst for the ORR. Importantly, the optimized catalyst shows much better long-term stability and satisfactory tolerance for the methanol crossover effect. These codoped aerogels are expected to have potential applications in fuel cells.									18	2	0	0	0	0	18			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000401320700004

Reasonable design of seawater electrolysis catalysts should integrate high activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)/ oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and enhanced physical/electro-chemical stability in seawater. Herein, we demonstrate the development of a Ni foam (NF) supported interfacial heterogeneous nickel phosphide/sulfide (Ni2P/NiS2) microsphere electrocatalyst (NiPS/NF) through a facile electrodeposition and subsequent phosphorization/sulfuration process. After NiS2 mod-ification, a charge redistribution on the heterointerface is demonstrated and a more advantageous cova-lent nature of the Ni-P bond is obtained for more easily adsorption of H* and H2O. The NiPS/NF thus yields an impressive electrocatalytic performance in 1.0 M KOH, requiring small overpotentials of 169 and 320 mV for HER and OER to obtain a high current density of 100 mA cm-2, respectively. The NiPS/NF can also work efficiently in alkaline seawater with negligible activity degradation, requiring overpoten-tials of only 188 and 344 mV for a current density of 100 mA cm-2 for HER and OER, respectively. A syn-ergistically enhanced physical/electrochemical long-term stability NiPS/NF in saline water is also demonstrated.

However, the practical implication of this technology is hindered by the lack of efficient earth abundant catalyst capable of accelerating both half reaction of water electrolysis. In this regards, herein; we have prepared a highly active composite electrode by depositing hierarchical spinel iron cobalt oxide on the surface of nickel foam. The layered morphology of iron cobalt oxide is ideal for effective transfer of electrolyte and facile dissipation of gaseous product. Moreover, intimate contact between the catalyst and the current collector caused a significant reduction in charge transfer resistance. Consequently, composite electrode displayed enhanced catalytic activity for HER and OER, achieving the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 205 mV and 244 mV respectively. In addition, a two-electrode alkaline water electrolyzer constructed by employing the composite electrode as anode and cathode yielded a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an applied potential of only 1.62 V. The long-lasting stability of iron cobalt oxide-Ni foam electrode along with its exceptional catalytic activity makes it a promising alternative to substitute the precious metal catalyst used in commercial water electrolyzer.

Treatment with reductants, such as hydroxylamine, leads to release of manganese and loss of oxygen evolution. The manganese cluster can be reassembled through a process called photoactivation. The first step of photoactivation consists of binding of Mn2+, which is then photooxidized to form Mn3+. We have used difference Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to study the oxidation of a partially assembled manganese cluster; this partially assembled cluster may represent an intermediate in photoassembly and contains, on average, one manganese per reaction center, Difference infrared spectra, associated with the photooxidation of this partially assembled cluster at 200 K, are similar to difference infrared spectra associated with the formation of the S-2 multiline state. In particular, spectral features in the 1500-1200 cm(-1) region, previously assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of aspartate and/or glutamate residues, are observed in both cases and are essentially identical, These data indicate that the first, high-affinity binding site for manganese in photosystem ll has the same coordination as the manganese atom, which is oxidized upon formation of the S-2 multiline state.									12	0	0	0	10	0	14			1520-6106			WOS:000071322200002

The isotope data of hydrogen and oxygen indicated that most of the seismic observation wells in the study area were originated from the atmospheric precipitation,and there were slightly different in the recharge modes.

The crystal structure, electronic structure, and electrocatalytic activity of BFTO compounds were evaluated. The processing temperature induced phase transformations and structural quality influences the electronic structure and electrocatalytic activity of BFTO compounds. At T-s = 1200 degrees C, Ba(Fe0.7Ta0.3)O3-delta stabilizes as a mixture of the orthorhombic + rhombohedral phase (Amm2 + R3m). With increasing T-s (>= 1250 degrees C), Ba(Fe0.7Ta0.3)O3-delta ceramics stabilize in tetragonal + rhombohedral [P4mm + R3m] mixed phase with a variation in the number of respective phases. High-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of constituent elements, namely, Ba 3d, Fe 2p, Ta 4f, and O 1s levels reveals the electronic structure changes due to changes in the chemical environment resulted from structural transformation. The XPS analyses indicate that the processing temperature significantly influences the chemical environment of Fe and Ta cations in BFTO. The Ba 3d5/ 2 core-level XPS spectra indicate that the perovskite phase gradually increases with increasing sintering temperature. The presence of absorption bands that are exclusively due to MO6 stretching vibration that is connected to Ba ion as well as stretching of M-O bonds in infrared spectroscopy data indicate the structural and chemical quality of the BFTO compounds. The electrocatalytic activity of BFTO was evaluated toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Though all of the samples demonstrated appreciable electrocatalytic properties, the best electrochemical catalytic activity was shown by BFTO samples sintered at 1350 degrees C. BFTO-1350 degrees C showed an onset potential of -0.690 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for HER and an onset potential of 0.73 V vs RHE for ORR indicating its significant electrocatalytic performance. A general increase in activity with sintering temperature is potentially due to the improved structural quality of the BFTO ceramics. In addition to offering the fundamental insights into perovskite materials based on co-doped BaTiO3 for electrocatalysis, the present work may contribute to the design and development of materials using co-doping of different chemical valence cations for other energy-related applications.									5	0	0	0	0	0	4			2574-0962			WOS:000621660800030

Herein, we report the hydrothermal synthesis of a NiTe2 nanosheet array anchored on Ti mesh (NiTe2/TM) through the topotactic transformation from a Ni(OH)(2) nanoarray on the basis of an anion exchange reaction. As a robust non-noble-metal catalyst electrode for alkaline water oxidation, NiTe2/TM exhibits high activity and delivers a small overpotential of 315mV to realize an anodic geometrical current density of 10mAcm(-2), with superior long-term durability. It is suggested that the NiOOH species is evolved as the active phase for water oxidation.

Among them, bismuth-based ultrathin materials display intriguing photocatalytic performance due to the unique structural and electronic properties, strong light response and appealing energy band structure. This critical review summarizes recent progress in the design and tailoring of diversified Bi-based ultrathin materials for various photocatalytic applications. We start with the introduction from the crystal structure, materials design and synthesis of various Bi-based ultrathin photocatalysts, such as bismuth oxide, bismuth oxyhalides, Bi2WO6, Bi2MoO6, BiVO4 and so on. Then, strategies for local atomic arrangement, electronic structure, and carrier concentration tuning, so as to boost the performance, are summarized, such as crystal facet control, bismuth-enrichment strategy, surface adjustment, heteroatom doping, defect engineering, co-catalyst modification, and utilization of solid solutions, single atoms, and heterojunctions. Furthermore, advancements of versatile photocatalytic applications over Bi-based ultrathin materials are discussed, including oxygen evolution, hydrogen evolution, organic syntheses, CO2 reduction, N-2 reduction, and pollutant removal, with an emphasis on the structure-activity relationship. Finally, the existing challenges and future research opportunities are also presented.									64	8	0	0	5	0	66			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000498556500002

Electrocatalytic water splitting is one of the promising strategies for producing hydrogen energy. In this study, the non-noble nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) catalyst is deposited on the electrochemically intercalated graphite/graphene (G/GE) substrate and directly used as the self-supported and binder-free electrode for electrocatalytic water oxidation. The Ni2Fe1-LDH@G/GE catalyst shows a low overpotential of 194 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is better than the noble metal catalyst IrO2 (314 mV)( )and RuO2 (330 mV) and many other related works. This research provides a facile way to directly prepare the catalyst electrode with high performance and low cost.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0934-0866	1521-4117		WOS:000708521800001

In this communication, we report the development of a Mn-doped Ni3S2 nanosheet array on Ni foam (Mn-Ni3S2/NF) as a superior and durable catalyst for alkaline hydrogen evolution. Such Mn-Ni3S2/NF demands an overpotential of 152 mV to afford 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, 46 mV less than that for Ni3S2/NF. Furthermore, this catalyst also shows high long-term electrochemical durability. This work provides important guidance for exploring optimal HER catalysts.									66	3	0	0	6	0	66			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000443956300015	30124709

Here, a porous carbon (PC) catalyst is prepared as a low-cost catalyst from grapefruit peel biowaste using a facile hydrothermal carbonization combined with a chemical activation process. When examined as an OER/ORR catalyst in seawater, the PC exhibits an unexpected, highly efficient catalytic activity. From density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we found that sp(3)-bonded carbon atoms, zigzag edges with or without -COOH and -OH, and armchair edges with -O- are responsible for its superior OER/ORR activity. The suitability of the PC as a catalyst is tested in the half-cell of a Na/seawater battery, which exhibits a decreased voltage gap of similar to 0.47 V between charge and discharge voltage curves. This value is even lower than those of Pt/C (similar to 0.68 V), IrO2 (similar to 0.66 V) and MnO2 (similar to 0.73). Also, a full cell of the metal-free seawater battery is assembled using hard carbon and PC as an anode and a catalyst, respectively. The full cell shows a lower voltage gap (similar to 0.65 V) with the voltage efficiency of similar to 83-84% and excellent cycle life over 100 cycles. Our results confirm PC derived from grapefruit peels as an alternative to expensive Pt/C and IrO2 catalysts for the OER/ORR activities in seawater batteries.									42	3	0	0	1	0	43			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000405190000029

The films were deposited on titanium plates by painting the substrate with a sonocatalysed sol containing varying amounts of ruthenium and iridium acetylacetonates. This was followed by a heat-treatment at 400 degrees C for 1 h. The redox processes occurring on those films were characterised by cyclic voltammetry:at 20 mV s(-1) in 0.5 M aqueous H2SO4. The measured voltammetric charges are related to the active areas of the electrodes and increase with the iridium content going through a maximum at x = 0.5. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was studied through polarisation curves recorded under galvanostatic control from 10 mu A cm(-2) up to 100 mu A cm(-2). Tafel plots normalised by the voltammetric charges revealed the true catalytic effect of cm the RuO2 for the OER. The combination of electrocatalytic and roughness effects made the Ru0.7Ir0.3O2 coating the most effective for the OER. The Tafel slope values changed from 40 mV dec(-1) for pure RuO2 coatings to 60 mV dec(-1) for pure IrO2. These variations indicate a strong dependence of the Fraction pathway with the nature of the coating. Accelerated tests performed at 700 mA cm(-2) in 30% aqueous H2SO4 and 80 degrees C showed that the limiting factor in:the operational life of these electrodes is the dissolution of the active layer and that the Ru0.1Ir0.9O2 coating has the longer life-time under those conditions.

In our work, different from traditional methods of transition metal sulfide cocatalyst synthesis, an NiFeSx-decorated Ti-Fe2O3 photoanode is synthesized through a simple one-step electrodeposition method, which benefits the interface between Ti-Fe2O3 and NiFeSx. With the help of this excellent OER electrocatalyst, the photocurrent density of the NiFeSx-Ti-Fe2O3 photoanode rises to 3 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is 2.5 times greater than the photocurrent of Ti-Fe2O3. Moreover, the onset potential of NiFeSx-Ti-Fe2O3 shifts negatively by 170 mV compared with that of pure Ti-Fe2O3. Furthermore, surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPV) and transient photovoltage (TPV) techniques and photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS) were used to analyze the true effects of NiFeSx as an efficient cocatalyst for enhancing the PEC performance of the NiFeSx-Ti-Fe2O3 photoanode. This work provides a simple method for loading a low-cost and efficient cocatalyst to modify a Ti-Fe2O3 photoanode for the PEC water oxidation reaction.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000708595400001	34665188

However, a key disadvantage of carbon electrodes lies in the fact that carbon may react with Li2O2 and electrolyte to form irreversible side products (e.g. Li2CO3) at the active surfaces, leading to a high charge voltage and a short cycling life. In this work, we address this issue by decorating NiO and RuO2 nano particles onto carbon surfaces. It is demonstrated that the NiO-RuO2 nanoparticle-decorated carbon electrode not only catalyzes both the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, but also promotes the decomposition of side products. As a result, the battery fitted with the novel carbon cathode delivers a capacity of 3653 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 400 mA g(-1), with a charge plateau of 4.01 V. This performance is 440 mV lower than that of the battery fitted with a pristine carbon cathode. The present cathode is also able to operate for 50 cycles without capacity decay at a fixed capacity of 1000 mAh g(-1) which is more than twice the cycle number of that of the pristine carbon cathode.

Discoveries pertaining to the oxygen reduction reaction catalyst helped enable the commercialization of fuel-cell-based electric vehicles. However, a closely related technology, the metal-air battery, has yet to find commercial application. Much like the Li-ion battery, metal-air batteries can potentially utilize the electrical grid network for charging, bypassing the need for establishing a hydrogen infrastructure. Among the metal-air batteries, Li-air and Zn-air batteries have drawn much interest in the past decade. Unfortunately, state-of-the art metal-air batteries still produce performances that are well below practical levels. In this brief perspective, we hope to bridge some of the ideas from fuel cell to that of metal-air batteries with the aim of inspiring new ideas and directions for future research.									62	2	0	0	5	0	62			2590-2393	2590-2385		WOS:000519849300013

The time-course of changes in PSII photochemistry in response to high salinity (0.8 M NaCl) incubated in the dark and at 30, 50 and 100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) was composed of two phases. The first phase, which was independent of light, was characterized by a rapid decrease (20-50%) in the maximal efficiency of PSII photochemistry (F-v/F-m), the efficiency of excitation energy capture by open PSII reaction centres (F'(v)/F'(m)), photochemical quenching (q(p)), and the quantum yield of PSII electron transport (Phi(PSII)) in the first 15 min, followed by a recovery of up to about 86-92% of their initial levels after 4 h of incubation. The second phase took place after 4 h, in which a further decline in the above parameters occurred only in the light but not in the dark, reaching levels as low as 32-56% of their initial levels after 12 h. Moreover, the higher incubation light intensity, the greater the decrease in the above parameters. At the same time, Q(B)-non-reducing PSII reaction centres increased significantly in the first 15 min and then recovered to the initial level during the first phase, but increased again in the light in the second phase. Photosynthetic oxygen evolution activity decreased sharply by 70% in the first 5 min, and then kept largely constant until 12 h. The changes in oxygen evolution activity were independent of light intensity during both phases.									33	11	0	0	35	1	50			0022-0957			WOS:000087353300010	10948217

Herein, the correlation between the morphological evolution of the Li anode and the overall cell electrochemical performance of cycled LOBs has been revealed for the first time by complementary X-ray and neutron tomography, together with further postmortem scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transfrom infrared spectroscopy characterizations. It has been disclosed with solid evidence that the irreversible transformation of anode Li associated with chemical/electrochemical side reactions does link intimately to the observed electrochemical performance decay. The current discoveries not only fundamentally enrich our knowledge of the underlying degradation and failure mechanisms of LOBs but also provide direction for future promising research activities aimed at further enhancing their performance.									39	6	0	0	1	0	41			2380-8195			WOS:000456493100043

Small-size Ni nanoparticles, obtained by partial reduction from NiAl2O4 spinel in NixAl1O2-delta catalysts with low Ni contents at high temperature, can effectively inhibit the carbon formation from kinetics, while the irreducible NiAl2O4 counterpart can participate in elimination of carbon deposition. The constructed structure of Ni-0-NiAl2O4 interfaces, produced by exsolution of Ni from NiAl2O4 spinel, is responsible for its high long-term stability and excellent resistance to coking and sintering for dry reforming of methane (DRM) reaction. The structure sensitivity and kinetic compensation effect of CH4 dissociation on Ni-0 active sites are observed. DRM reaction proceeds via a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism accompanied by an additional redox mechanism. It is noteworthy that the active oxygen species generated by filling the oxygen vacancies of NiAl2O4 spinel by CO2 provide another rapid redox route to eliminate carbon species.									32	1	0	0	1	0	33			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000651114800005

Electrochemical hydrogen gas evolution on the electrode surface will occupy the limited active sites thus significantly increasing the reaction overpotential. It is crucial to study and optimize the bubble behavior on the electrode surface to improve reaction efficiency and lower the energy loss. Herein, a microfluidic electrochemical reactor (MER) has been constructed to optimize the surface gas-liquid two-phase flow behavior during the gas evolution process. The obtained results demonstrate the feasibility of microfluidic design in manipulating the bubble behavior at the electrode interface accompanied with the self -generated gas-liquid two-phase flow, which can directly reduce the overpotentials by facilitating the mass transfer and refreshing catalytic active sites. Compared with conventional H-cell, state-of-the-art efficient and stable performance of hydrogen evolution has been achieved, where the increase in current density was more than 5 times. This work reveals a new strategy for guiding the design of the electrochemical reactor for water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0306-2619	1872-9118		WOS:000860025700001

The hypertrophy of lower lip, forming a ''shovel'' that serves for the intake of thin surface water film layer, appears within 24-48 hours of oxygen depletion. Conversely, 24 hours are enough for disappearence of this adaptation provided that normal oxygen conditions are renewed. These rapid changes are possible by strong oedematous infiltration of the corium.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0139-7893	1573-1189		WOS:A1993LV01200008

Here, we report an electrocatalytic strategy for dehydrogenative [4 + 2] cycloaddition of N,N-dialkylanilines with maleimides via dual functionalization of both C(sp(3))-H and C(sp(2))-H bonds, by using an electrochemically activated cobalt carbonate hydroxide hydrate supported on carbon cloth (CCHH-A/CC), affording various tetrahydroquinolines with high yields. This electrochemical transformation proceeds with high activity and stability, as well as good substrate compatibility. Mechanism study shows that alpha-aminoalkyl radical exists in the electrooxidation reaction. This strategy shows significant potential for the synthesis of valuable chemicals by using an electrocatalytic strategy.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1001-604X	1614-7065		WOS:000851452400001

Using concepts of nanoemulsification, an oil-water stable nanodroplets were formed. This emulsion was treated at different temperatures in an oil-based medium. This is an advantage to obtain well dispersed hydrophilic nanoparticles, considering that using water as solvent promotes their agglomeration. The cluster of hydrate titanium is formed inside the water dispersed graphene oxide nanodroplet in the oil medium. This aspect assures a close connection between graphene layers and titanium ions, originating dispersed quantum dots of minimum size. Temperature and time of oleothermal reaction influence the degree of functionalization of the graphene layers and thus the photoluminescence characteristics. For the water splitting characterization, a transparent thin film was obtained using the electrophoresis. It was possible to correlate the degree of oxygen functionalization of the graphene layers with the oleothermal conditions and the generated photocurrents.									13	0	0	0	3	0	13			2452-2627			WOS:000461239900004

However, the current research has been focused on the construction of novel OER electrocatalysts themselves, little attention has been paid to the modification of the substrates. In this work, a different strategy is proposed via laser ablation to fabricate the Cu foams with rich micro/nano-structures as OER substrates. Later, the precipitation conversion method was utilized to grow cobalt hydroxide on the laser fabricated Cu foams. The as-produced Cu/Cu oxides/Co(OH)(2) electrocatalysts exhibit high OER activity in 1 M KOH, requiring an overpotential of only 259 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) with excellent mild-term durability. The improved catalytic performance of the prepared samples can be attributed to the increased surface area, rich active sites, and the superhydrophilicity of the laser produced micro/nano-structures.									6	1	0	0	0	0	7			2296-2646			WOS:000509229200001	31998691

It is well established that hydrogen starvation during normal operation leads to carbon corrosion and anode catalyst layer degradation. However, hydrogen starvation damage to PEFCs in freezing conditions has not been well studied. The amount of anode damage strongly depends on the anode potential. However, during freezing conditions both electrodes experience significant potential changes and thus a reference electrode is needed. Here, a reference electrode was developed and used to investigate hydrogen starvation and cell reversal at -15 degrees C. Based on anode potential change, an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) potential plateau was observed with the potential value shifted to a higher value due to the temperature effect.

Herein, an advanced CO2 electrolysis system constructed by replacing OER with selective methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) is reported as a proof-of-concept, which achieves the yielding of value-added products in both cathode and anode. Notably, the MOR over a self-supported NiCo-based metal-organic framework-derived anode (NiCo-NF-ET) only needs 1.291 V to reach a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2), which is about 346 mV lower than that of OER. Simultaneously, formate can also be produced with the Faradaic efficiencies approaching to 100%. Consequently, in comparison with the conventional CO2 electrolysis system, integrating cathodic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) with anodic MOR can lead to the reduction of about 880 mV to deliver the current density of 30 mA cm(-2), while without compromising the selectivity of the products in both electrodes. Herein, the great potential to increase the economic benefits of CO2 electrolysis via the rational design of nonprecious electrocatalysts and participated anodic oxidation reactions is shown.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2688-4062		WOS:000706876400001

The controllable synthesis of targeted bimetallic core-shell nanostructures is an important yet challenging task. Herein, bimetallic nanoparticles comprising a gold multipod nanoparticle (GMN) core and distinctive Pd shell (GMN@Pd NPs) are successfully synthesized in a facile and controllable manner. Epitaxial or islanded growth of Pd on the GMNs can be readily achieved using appropriate stabilizing agents. The controllable growth mode of the Pd layers, coupled with the unique topologies of GMNs, are advantageous for enhancing the density of active interfacial surfaces in the composites. Particularly, I-GMN@Pd NPs show substantially enhanced ORR activity compared with monometallic counterparts and excellent durability and better tolerance to the crossover effect than that of Pt/C, rendering the materials highly desirable for practical use.

CeO2 is of particular interest because its reducibility affects the redox of organic molecules. In this work, the adsorption and thermal evolution of formic acid and formate on highly ordered films of fully oxidized CeO2(111) and highly reduced CeOx(111) surfaces have been studied using reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) under ultra-high vacuum conditions, and the experimental results are combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to probe the identity, symmetry, and bonding of the surface intermediates. Disordered ice, ordered alpha-polymorph and molecular formic acid bonded through the carbonyl are observed at low temperatures. By 250 K, desorption and deprotonation lead to formate coexisting with hydroxyl on CeO2(111), identified to be a bridging bidentate formate species that is coordinated to Ce cations in nearly C-2v symmetry and interacting strongly with neighboring H. Changes in the spectra at higher temperatures are consistent with additional tilting of the formate, resulting in C-s(2) or lower symmetry. This change in bonding is caused primarily by interaction with oxygen vacancies introduced by water desorption at 300 K. On reduced CeOx, multiple low-symmetry formate states exist likewise due to interactions with oxygen vacancies. Isotopic studies demonstrate that the formyl hydrogen does not contribute to H incorporated in hydroxyl on the surface, and that both formate oxygen atoms may exchange with lattice oxygen at 400 K. The combined experimental and theoretical results thus provide important insights on the surface reaction pathways of formic acid on ceria.									48	1	0	0	3	0	48			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000272193800013	20024386

We present operando surface X-ray diffraction studies of two structurally well-defined epitaxial cobalt oxide thin films: Co3O4(111) and CoOOH(001) electrodeposited on Au(111). The potential-dependent structural changes during cyclic voltammograms were monitored with high time resolution up to OER current densities as high as 150 mA cm(-2). The CoOOH(001) film is found to be smooth and perfectly stable over a wide potential range. In the case of Co3O4(111), fast and fully reversible structural changes are observed. Specifically, the surface region of Co3O4(111) starts restructuring at potentials 300 mV negative of the onset of the OER, indicating that the process is related to the thermodynamically predicted Co3O4/CoOOH(001) transition rather than to the catalytic reaction. The formed skin layer is of defined thickness, which changes linearly with applied potential, and is the OER active phase. Surprisingly, the catalytic activity of the skin layer covered Co3O4 film and that of the smooth CoOOH(001) are almost identical, if the true microscopic surface area is taken into account. This indicates that the number of OER active sites on the two oxides is similar, despite the very different defect density, and is at variance with previous suggestions that di-kt-oxo bridged Co cations are exclusively responsible for the OER activity of Co oxides. For the smooth CoOOH(001), a turnover frequency of 4.2 s(-1) per surface atom is determined at an overpotential of 400 mV. Furthermore, our studies demonstrate that the pseudocapacitive charging current in the pre-OER potential range must be assigned to a bulk process that is accompanied by potential-dependent changes of the unit cell volume in the Co3O4 bulk.									54	1	0	0	3	0	54			2155-5435			WOS:000467335600006

In this study, trimetallic nitrogen-incorporated CoNiFe (N-CoNiFe) was produced to solve the low OER efficiency using a facile co-precipitation method in the presence of ethanolamine (EA) ligands. A series of CoNiFe catalysts at different EA concentrations were also investigated to determine the effects of the ligand in the co-precipitation of a trimetallic system. The introduction of an optimized EA concentration (20 mM) improved the electrocatalytic performance of N-CoNiFe dramatically, with an overpotential of 318 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH and a Tafel slope of 72.2 mV dec(-1). In addition, N-CoNiFe shows high durability in the OER process with little change in the overpotential (ca. 16.0 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2) after 2000 cycles, which was smaller than that for commercial Ir/C (38.0 mV).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2046-2069		WOS:000787857400001	35496332

Ir-based materials are among the best catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media, but their degradation mechanisms are not completely understood. Here, through first-principles calculations we investigate iridium dissolution at the IrO2(110)/water interface. Simulations reveal that the surface-bound IrO2OH species formed upon iridium dissolution should be thermodynamically stable in a relatively wide potential window undergoing transformations into IrVI (as IrO3) at high anodic potentials and IrIII (as Ir(OH)(3)) at low anodic potentials. The identified high-valence surface-bound dissolution intermediates of Ir are determined to display greater OER activities than the pristine IrO2(110) surface in agreement with the experimentally observed high activity of an amorphous hydrated IrOx surface layer. Combined with recent experimental results, our simulations illuminate the mechanistic details of the degradation mechanism of IrO2 and how it couples to electrocatalytic OER.									31	0	0	0	1	0	31			1948-7185			WOS:000526348400043	32188249

One of the requirements for effective battery operation is an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) that needs to be generated in a highly alkaline electrolyte. The A(2)BB'O-5 brownmillerite-type Ca2FeCoO5 electrocatalyst having a 57 Pbcm symmetry exhibits very high electrocatalytic activity toward OER in 4 mol dm(-3) KOH. Our studies show that the electrocatalyst undergoes bulk amorphization upon OER and adequately activates catalytically active domains. The synchrotron radiation studies using the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) technique show that the central structural unit found in the polarized Ca2FeCoO5 is a cluster of edge-sharing CoO6 octahedra. The OER preferentially takes place on the edge-sharing CoO6 octahedra catalytic centers reconstructed in the brownmillerite-type electrocatalyst. The EXAFS second shell peaks at an interatomic distance of 2.8 angstrom are the fingerprints of the catalytically active domains.									20	1	0	0	0	0	21			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000481567100025	31339683

Our LixNi1-xO (0.04 <= x <= 0.2) samples have an f.c.c crystal structure, are in an anti-ferromagnetic phase, and exhibit a substantial conductivity due to a hole-hopping process with a characteristic rate which is essentially independent of composition. Several processes of reduction and oxidation occur in the voltage region between the hydrogen (HER) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions, which are compared with related phenomena observed in pure Ni electrodes (Ni(OH)(2) and NiO). Repeated cycles of reduction and oxidation yield electrodes with a somewhat improved OER activity, and a high charge-storage capacity. Heavy anodic treatments cause irreversible changes of these properties, particularly when coupled with months-long storage in air. The complex behavior of these electrodes is interpreted in terms of formation of a topotactic surface layer with hydrogenated species.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000269400500019	19950507

The specific properties of graphene edge sites, such as the high available density of states and extended unpaired pi-bonding, make it a promising candidate to tune the electronic properties of metal catalysts. However, to date, understanding and leveraging graphene edge-metal catalysts for improved electrocatalytic performance remains largely elusive. Herein, edge-rich vertical graphene (er-VG) was synthesized and used as a catalyst support for Ni-Fe hydroxides for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The hybrid Ni-Fe/er-VG catalyst exhibits excellent OER performance with a mass current of 4051 A g(-1) (at overpotential eta = 300 mV) and turnover frequency (TOF) of 4.8 s(-1) (eta = 400 mV), outperforming Ni-Fe deposited on pristine VG and other metal foam supports. Angle-dependent X-ray absorption spectroscopy shows that the edge-rich VG support can preferentially template Fe-O units with a specific valence orbital alignment interacting with the unoccupied density of states on the graphene edges. This graphene edge-metal interaction was shown to facilitate the formation of undersaturated and strained Fe-sites with high valence states, while promoting the formation of redox-activated Ni species, thus improving OER performance. These findings demonstrate rational design of the graphene edge-metal interface in electrocatalysts which can be used for various energy conversion and chemical synthesis reactions.									28	0	0	0	2	0	28			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000576958900023	32790322

In 0. 1 mol/L KOH solution, the voltage was only increased by 3. 6% with continuously measured for 6 h ( constant current = 10 mA/cm2 ) , which showed fine electrochemical stability.									0	1	0	0	0	0	1			1001-1579			INSPEC:20615295

In this work, we demonstrated that, by introducing Fe2O3 particles into solution, the incident light energy-restriction for the photo-catalyzed hydrolysis could be broken and the hydrolysis occurred at the Fe2O3/solution interface. The photo-generated holes on the Fe2O3 surface played a key role in oxidizing Ir(III) to Ir(IV) species and triggered the deposition of IrOx. We showed that this photo-catalyzed surface hydrolysis is a universal phenomenon that takes place on the surface of many n-type semiconductors such as Fe2O3, TiO2, and Ag3PO4. As IrOx is an efficient catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction, surface hydrolysis is a general, facile and efficient strategy to prepare semiconductor/IrOx composites, which can be used as anodic materials for photoelectrochemical water splitting.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000391725300015	27918021

Herein, we developed a facile synthesis method of 3d transition-metal-doped alpha-Co(OH)(2) nanomaterials mediated with ammonia in water-methanol at room temperature. The doping of Cu2+ and Ni2+ leads to flower-like nanostructures similar to pure alpha-Co(OH)(2) whereas the doping of Fe2+ produces nanoparticles with more than 2 times larger surface area in comparison with the Cu2+ and Ni2+-doped nanoflowers. The obtained dispersion with the addition of Nafion can be used directly as an electrocatalyst for OER with excellent catalytic activity, especially that the overpotential of Fe2+ doped is as low as 290 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). and the turnover frequency is improved by 3 times as compared with that of alpha-Co(OH)(2). Furthermore, the catalyst can be loaded onto foam nickel, which presents excellent durability with the current density unchanged under continuous chronoamperometry reaction for as long as 12 h and almost quantitative faradaic efficiency. The superior electrocatalytic properties combined with the simple synthesis without the tedious purification procedure is very promising for OER.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			2470-1343			WOS:000490421100041	31616843

The thermochemical reactor consists of a vertical-axis cavity-type receiver in which the reactant is injected from the bottom in the form of an ascending rod made of a stack of zinc oxide compressed pellets undergoing thermal dissociation. A transient heat transfer model allows the simulation of the thermal behavior under real conditions for the rod of reacting particles exposed to concentrated solar radiation. The developed numerical model couples radiation, conduction and convection heat transfers to the kinetic of the reaction. The incident solar irradiation on the reactant surface is obtained using the Monte-Carlo ray tracing technique applied first to the solar concentrator and second to the reactor cavity. The model is used to predict the temperature profile from the irradiated front surface of the compressed reactant, the evolution of outlet oxygen molar flow-rate during the reduction reaction and the instantaneous thermochemical efficiency, as a function of time. The calculated results are compared with the experimentally obtained data. The agreement between experimental data and simulation related to both the temperature and the oxygen progress is fairly good with E-a=380 kJ mol(-1) and k(0)=246 x 10(6) mol m(2) s(-1) for the kinetics of the ZnO dissociation reaction.

However, the overall conversion efficiency is significantly limited by the inefficient charge separation and sluggish interfacial reaction dynamics, which resulted from a lack of sufficient active sites. Herein, Bi12O17Cl2 superfine nanotubes with a bilayer thickness of the tube wall are designed to achieve structural distortion for the creation of surface oxygen defects, thus accelerating the carrier migration and facilitating CO2 activation. Without cocatalyst and sacrificing reagent, Bi12O17Cl2 nanotubes deliver high selectivity CO evolution rate of 48.6molg(-1)h(-1) in water (16.8 times than of bulk Bi12O17Cl2), while maintaining stability even after 12h of testing. This paves the way to design efficient photocatalysts with collaborative optimizing charge separation and CO2 activation towards CO2 photoreduction.									227	12	0	0	25	0	230			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000452234400028	30178910

Correlations were sought between gasification rates and reactive surface areas (RSA) of the chars. In addition, the results allowed some speculation on recently proposed mechanisms of catalysis. An excellent correlation was found in the case of K catalysis, suggesting the rate-determining step in the overall mechanism to be the same as in the uncatalyzed reaction, i.e., desorption of the reactive C(O) intermediate. For the Ca-catalyzed reaction, the quality of the correlation depended on catalyst dispersion, suggesting that an additional process, besides the direct decomposition of the reactive C(O) intermediate, contributed to the transient evolution of CO (e.g., oxygen spillover). No correlation was found for Ni-catalyzed gasification; an oxygen-transfer mechanism is proposed to explain these findings. Mixed catalyst systems (Ca/K, K/Ni, Ca/Ni) were also studied. An excellent correlation between reactivity and RSA was observed in cases where the K-catalyzed reaction was dominant.									50	2	0	0	3	0	52			0888-5885			WOS:A1991GA57200009

This methodology can be used to study reaction kinetics under vacuum condition, identify all the species involved in the solid-state reaction and establish their evolution. When LaSrCoO4 is heated under low partial pressure of O-2, oxygen vacancy ordering occurs at T > 400 degrees C. Further heating results in decomposition to La2O3, SrO and Co which is observed at temperatures higher than 710 degrees C. We obtained the activation energies of these stages by non-isothermal treatments using two different models: Starink and Ozawa. Energies of 202 and 35 kJ/mol were calculated for the ordering stage and the decomposition stage (for alpha > 0.7), respectively. A reaction model for the decomposition of LaSrCoO4 was determined applying the Coats- Redfern equation to the experimental data. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here we report a facile method for synthesizing two-dimensional nickel disulfide (NiS2) by using Ni(OH)(2) on nickel foam as substrate. The as-synthesized NiS2 displayed an activation period during HER with a remarkable structural and compositional change under alkaline conditions. Electrochemical in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed that metallic Ni acted as catalytic active species with superior activity of 67 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2). The in situ generated metallic Ni were easily oxidized to large-area ultrathin Ni(OH)(2) when exposed to air. The overall water splitting device was fabricated by using NiS2-derived metallic Ni and Fe doped NiS2-derived hydroxide as HER and OER electrode with a potential of 1.52 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2).									130	11	0	0	6	0	132			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000415302600016

Herein, we propose a coordination environment regulation strategy to modulate the d-band center of Ni by introducing different heteroatoms, such as N, N-B, N-P, N-S, into porous carbon nanofibers (CNFs), which enables to optimize the geometrical and electronic structures of isolated Ni atoms, thus tunes the interaction between Ni center and intermediates for effective water splitting. The experimental and theoretical results indicate the d-band center of Ni atoms coupled with three N atoms and one P atom is tailored to moderate position to create favorable binding with H/O-containing intermediates, thus leading to benefitting thermodynamics and kinetics for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution. As a proof, the designed Ni-N,P/CNFs with Ni-N3-P moiety shows extraordinary overall water splitting ability, superior to other coordination configurations. Notably, the acidic hydrogen evolution reaction upon Ni-N,P/CNFs present ultralow overpotential of 38 mV to afford 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 24 mV dec(-1), placed at the top of reported single-atom-based catalysts. Such concept of modulating d-band center could provide in-depth insight into the design and performance optimization of SACs.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000793650800003

In this study, RP was decorated by trace amount of WO3 to greatly enhance the photocarriers separation and photocatalytic activity for overall water splitting under visible light. The 2.5% WO3/RP composite achieved the highest activity to produce H2 and O2, and the activity was 7.0 times that of pure RP under visible light (lambda >= 420 nm). The significantly increased photocarriers separation of WO3/RP was ensured by transient photocurrent, electrochemical impendence, photoluminescence, and time-resolved photoluminescence characterizations. More importantly, WO3/RP maintained high stability when it was persistently used for 20 cycles. Based on the reactive oxygen species (center dot O-2(-) and center dot OH) detected during the photocatalytic process, an S-scheme mechanism was proposed for WO3/RP composites to efficiently separate the photocarriers. This work provides a notion for improving the overall water splitting activity of RP via an S-scheme photocarriers separation mode.									25	1	0	0	2	0	25			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000652631200001

Herein, well-defined P- and B-codoped NiFe alloy mesoporous nanospheres (NiFeB-P MNs) with an adjustable Ni/Fe ratio and large mesopores (11 nm) are synthesized via soft-template-based chemical reduction and a subsequent phosphine-vapor-based phosphidation process. Earth-abundant NiFe-based materials are considered promising electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) because of their low cost and high intrinsic catalytic activity. The resulting NiFeB-P MNs exhibit a low OER overpotential of 252 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which is significantly smaller than that of B-doped NiFe MNs (274 mV) and commercial RuO2 (269 mV) in alkaline electrolytes. Thus, this work highlights the practicality of designing mesoporous nonnoble metal structures and the importance of incorporating P in metallic-B-based alloys to modify their electronic structure for enhancing their intrinsic activity.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000829773700001	35863911

The development of earth-abundant transition metal phosphides (TMPs) to catalyze the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and TMP-derived oxy-hydroxides to catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has recently drawn considerable attention. However, most monolithically integrated metal phosphide electrodes are prepared by laborious multi-step methods and their operational stability at high current densities has been rarely studied. Herein, we report a novel vapor-solid synthesis of single-crystalline cobalt phosphide nanowires (CoP NWs) on a porous Co foam and demonstrate their use in overall water splitting. The CoP NWs grown on the entire surface of the porous Co foam ligaments have a large aspect ratio, and hence are able to provide a large catalytically accessible surface over a given geometrical area. Comprehensive investigation shows that under the OER conditions CoP NWs are progressively and conformally converted to CoOOH through electrochemical in situ oxidation/dephosphorization; the latter serving as an active species to catalyze the OER. The in situ oxidized electrode shows exceptional electrocatalytic performance for the OER in 1.0 M KOH, delivering 100 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential (eta) of merely 300 mV and a small Tafel slope of 78 mV dec(-1) as well as excellent stability at various current densities. Meanwhile, the CoP NW electrode exhibits superior catalytic activity for the HER in the same electrolyte, affording -100 mA cm(-2) at eta = 244 mV and showing outstanding stability. An alkaline electrolyzer composed of two symmetrical CoP NW electrodes can deliver 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) at low cell voltages of 1.56 and 1.78 V, respectively. The CoP NW electrolyzer demonstrates exceptional long-term stability for overall water splitting, capable of working at 20 and 100 mA cm(-2) for 1000 h without obvious degradation.									131	8	0	0	3	0	132			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000397560500056	28451361

For high energy density and better safety, it is desirable but challenging to reversibly intercalate chloride in a graphite cathode because either the oxygen or chlorine evolution reaction can prevail over chloride insertion. The primary barrier is the lack of suitable aqueous electrolytes that suppress these parasitic reactions. Herein, we report an aqueous deep eutectic solvent gel electrolyte that allows reversible chloride storage for graphite based on a chloride-based electrolyte via the formation of iodine-chloride interhalogens. The results suggest three reversible steps: iodine plating on the host surface, oxidation to form I-Cl interhalides, and then intercalation into graphite. As a result, the graphite cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 291 mAh g(-1) with stable cycling performance. Facilitated by the same mechanism, a porous graphenic carbon delivered a record-high capacity of over 1100 mAh g(-1).									22	1	0	0	0	0	22			2380-8195			WOS:000619803400020

However, the high cost and low stability of useable materials remain a considerable challenge for the widespread adoption of fuel cell energy conversion devices. The electrochemical performance of fuel cells is still largely hindered by the high loading of noble metal catalyst (Pt/Pt alloy) at the cathode, which is necessary to facilitate the inherently sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Under these circumstances, the exploration of alternatives to replace expensive Pt-alloy for constructing highly efficient non-noble metal catalysts has been studied intensively and received great interest. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) a novel type of porous crystalline materials, have revealed potential application in the field of clean energy and demonstrated a number of advantages owing to their accessible high surface area, permanent porosity, and abundant metal/organic species. Recently, newly emerging MOFs materials have been used as templates and/or precursors to fabricate porous carbon and related functional nanomaterials, which exhibit excellent catalytic activities toward ORR or oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this review, recent advances in the use of MOF-derived functional nanomaterials as efficient electrocatalysts in fuel cells are summarized. Particularly, we focus on the rational design and synthesis of highly active and stable porous carbon-based electrocatalysts with various nanostructures by using the advantages of MOFs precursors. Finally, further understanding and development, future trends, and prospects of advanced MOF-derived nanomaterials for more promising applications of clean energy are presented.									84	3	0	0	2	0	83				2073-4344		WOS:000382475200007

Each method is well documented in the literature, and this paper provides a direct comparison under identical experimental conditions of electrochemical measurements and in identical units. In the first method, based on classical engineering, the bimetallic catalyst is deposited by dip-coating in a precursor solution of the salts followed by their thermal decomposition. In the alternative method, more academic in nature, atomic layer deposition (ALD) is applied to the felts after anodization. ALD allows for a controlled coating with ultralow noble-metal loadings in narrow pores. In acidic electrolyte, the ALD approach yields improved mass activity (557 A.g(-1) as compared to 80 A.g(-1) at 0.39 V overpotential) on the basis of the noble-metal loading, as well as improved stability.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2190-4286			WOS:000541725000001	32647594	
J	Li, Yanyan; Zhang, Xinyu; Zheng, Zhiping								CeO2 Functionalized Cobalt Layered Double Hydroxide for Efficient Catalytic Oxygen-Evolving Reaction								SMALL				18	17					2107594	10.1002/smll.202107594		MAR 2022		APR 2022	2022	Water splitting to produce hydrogen is an effective means to alleviate the energy crisis. The anodic oxygen-evolving reaction (OER) limits the overall efficiency due to its high energy barrier. To address this, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with high catalytic activities have been widely studied, especially those modified with CeO2, either bound to the surface or doped into interior. However, experimental evidence for the atomic-level understanding of the mechanism for the enhanced catalytic performance is conspicuously missing. Herein, anchoring CeO2 nanoparticles onto Co LDH, based on the thoughts of loading capacity and size effect to regulate the properties of the interface and to optimize the performance, is attempted. The electronic interactions are studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), revealing electron transfer from Co2+ to Ce4+ that leads to an increase in Co3+. The strong Lewis acidity of Co3+ helps the binding of OH-, which is conducive to the formation and transformation of oxygen-containing intermediates. Providing evidence is the formation of one of the key intermediates Co-OOH at a sizably reduced potential as monitored by in situ Raman spectroscopy. With this work, the atomic level correlation of site-specific electronic interactions with the enhanced catalytic performance is clearly established.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000780428300001	35344284

We report here on the remarkably low 3.2 V potential for Li2O2 oxidation on a passivated nanostructured metallic carbide (Mo2C), carbon-free cathode host. Online mass spectrometry coupled with X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy unequivocally demonstrates that lithium peroxide is simultaneously oxidized together with the LixMoO3-passivated conductive interface formed on the carbide, owing to their close redox potentials. The process rejuvenates the surface on each cycle upon electrochemical charge by releasing LixMoO3 into the electrolyte, explaining the low charging potential.									96	8	0	0	7	0	99			1948-7185			WOS:000356758100017	26266600

In this study, N-doped graphene (NG) and carbon nanotubes (CNT) were grown in-situ on Co-containing carbon nanofibers (CNF) to form three-dimensional (3D) interconnected networks. The NG and CNT bound the interlaced CNF together, facilitating electron transfer and providing additional active sites. The 3D interconnected fiber networks exhibited excellent ORR catalytic behavior with an onset potential of 0.924 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) and a higher current density than Pt/C beyond 0.720 V. In addition, the hybrid system exhibited superior stability and methanol tolerance to Pt/C in alkaline media. This method can be extended to the design of other 3D interconnected network architectures for energy storage and conversion applications.									67	14	0	0	3	0	68			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000371798800005

However, the OER involves a complex four-electron process and suffers from intrinsically sluggish kinetics, which greatly impairs the efficiency of electrochemical systems. In addition, state-of-the-art -RuO2-based OER electrocatalysts are too expensive and scarce for practical applications. The development of highly active, cost-effective, and durable electrocatalysts that can improve OER performance (activity and durability) is of significant importance in realizing the widespread application of these advanced technologies. To date, considerable progress has been made in the development of alternative, noble metal-free OER electrocatalysts. Among these alternative catalysts, transition metal compounds have received particular attention and have shown activities comparable to or even higher than those of their precious metal counterparts. In contrast to many other electrocatalysts, such as carbon-based materials, transition metal compounds often exhibit a surface reconstruction phenomenon that is accompanied by the transformation of valence states during electrochemical OER processes. This surface reconstruction results in changes to the true active sites and an improvement or reduction in OER catalytic performance. Therefore, understanding the self-reconstruction process and precisely identifying the true active sites on electrocatalyst surfaces will help us to finely tune the properties and activities of OER catalysts. This review provides a comprehensive summary of recent progress made in understanding the surface reconstruction phenomena of various transition metal-based OER electrocatalysts, focusing on uncovering the correlations among structure, surface reconstruction and intrinsic activity. Recent advances in OER electrocatalysts that exhibit a surface self-reconstruction capability are also discussed. We identify possible challenges and perspectives for the development of OER electrocatalysts based on surface reconstruction. We hope this review will provide readers with some guidance on the rational design of catalysts for various electrochemical reactions.									31	1	0	0	0	0	30			2520-8489	2520-8136		WOS:000661583200001

Herein, highly dispersed Co atoms are successfully prepared by using an ultrathin g-C3N4@carbon sphere as the support, and subsequently the well-defined Co-N and Co-O bonds on the atomic level are controllably constructed by adjusting the calcination atmosphere. Results show that highly dispersed Co with Co-O and Co-N bonds exhibits excellent oxygen evolution reaction performance in alkaline media at low and high overpotentials, respectively, and outperform most single-atom catalysts reported to date. DFT calculation, coupled with high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectrometry techniques, reveals that the high activities mainly originate from the precise O-Co-N and N-Co-N coordination in the ultrathin g-C3N4@carbon sphere support. The enhancement mechanism of chemical bonding provides guidance for the atomic exploration and design of electrocatalysts.									14	3	0	0	0	0	14			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000482173300042	31361470

More than just enhancing the adsorption of NOx on heterojunction interfaces, it is demonstrated here that surface oxygen vacancies also present the possibility of activating NO and O-2 toward improved photocatalytic oxidation of NO through a changed photocatalytic oxidation reaction pathway. Selecting the BiOI-ZnO heterojunction as a model system, we demonstrate that the dissociatively adsorbed NO on the oxygen vacancies of the heterojunction interface shows a higher tendency to be oxidized than molecularly adsorbed NO. The introduction of oxygen vacancies restrains the recombination of the photoexcited carriers and raises the quantum yield. This promotes the production of reactive oxygen species, leading to the dramatic promotion of visible-light photocatalytic oxidation of NO. These findings highlight the indispensable function of defective hierarchical heterojunction interface structures in the photocatalytic oxidation of NOx and may open up avenues for the rational design of highly efficient photocatalysts via surface engineering.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000649761200001

This study reports on carbon-incorporated Ni2P-Fe2P hollow nanorods ((Ni,Fe)(2)P/C HNRs) derived from a self-template approach as efficient electrocatalysts. Initially, a Ni-2(BDC)(2)(DABCO)-MOF (Ni-MOF) is converted to NiFe-PBA hollow nanorods (HNRs) through facile ion exchange which was further converted to (Ni,Fe)(2)P/C HNRs via a subsequent phosphidation process. The resulting (Ni,Fe)(2)P/C HNRs exhibit remarkable activity for the oxygen evolution reaction in an alkaline solution requiring a small overpotential of 258 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and long-term stability with little deactivation after 40 h. (Ni,Fe)(2)P/C HNRs outperform (Ni,Fe)(2)P/C NPs and commercial RuO2. The unique hollow morphology and interfacial electronic structure substantially increase the active site and charge transfer rate of our electrocatalyst, resulting in excellent OER activity and stability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000872140200001	36285840

In this study, Fe2Ni MIL-88 (denoted FeNi) was composited by reduced graphene oxide (rGO, denoted R). Owing to the high porosity and abundant active sites of bimetallic MOF, proper conductivity of rGO, and the synergistic impact of Ni and Fe, the optimal composite (R@FeNi (1:1)) offered remarkable OER activity in alkaline environments. The obtained composite was employed in the OER, which led to a low overpotential of 264 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 62 mV dec(-1). Also, the bimetallic Fe2Ni MIL-88 nanorods grown on rGO led to a reduction in the onset potential of the OER These findings exceeded the results of standard IrO2 -based catalysts; they are also comparable or even better than the previously reported MOF-based catalysts.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000790015500006	35157424

This report describes a study of palladium-alloyed electrocatalysts (PdNi) with different bimetallic compositions, aiming at establishing the relationship between catalyst's composition, atomic structure, and activity for ORR taking place at the cathode of an operating PEMFC. Ex-situ and in-situ synchrotron high-energy X-ray diffraction (HE-XRD) coupled to atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis are employed to probe the structural evolution of the catalysts under PEMFC operation conditions. The study reveals an intriguing composition-activity synergy manifested by its strong dependence on the fuel cell operation induced leaching process of base metals from the catalysts. In particular, the synergy sustains during electrochemical potential cycling in the ORR operation potential window. The alloy with Pd:Ni ratio of 50:50 atomic ratio is shown to exhibit the highest possible surface Pd-Pd and Pd-Ni coordination numbers, near which an activity is observed. The analysis of the Ni-leaching process in terms of atomic-scale structure evolution sheds further light on the activity-composition-structure correlation. The results not only show a sustainable alloy characteristic upon leaching of Ni consistent with catalytic synergy but also reveal a persistent fluctuation pattern of interatomic distances along with an atomic-level reconstruction under the ORR and fuel cell operation conditions. The understanding of this type of interatomic distance fluctuation in the catalysts in correlation with the base metal leaching and realloying mechanisms under the electrocatalytic operation conditions may have important implications in the design and preparation of catalysts with controlled activity and stability.									35	2	0	0	1	0	37			2155-5435			WOS:000361089700039

Hydrogen and oxygen nanobubbles were generated from water electrolysis on the surface of a Au/Pd alloy modified ITO electrode. The formation of single H-2 and O-2 nanobubbles was imaged in real time during a potential scan using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy. Our results show that while O-2 nanobubbles can be detected at an early stage in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the formation of H-2 nanobubbles requires a significant overpotential.

The X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy investigations reveal that structural evolutions from an orthorhombic BaTiO3 to a hexagonal Ba(Ti1-xTMx)O3-delta, a hexagonal to a rhombohedral in Ba(Ti1-xMnx)O3-delta, and a hexagonal to a pseudo-cubic transition in (Ba1-ySry)(Ti1/3Fe2/3)O3-delta are induced by increasing the doping concentration. Due to the oxygen vacancies derived from acceptor doping, nanoscale domains of incommensurate modulation (ICM) resultant are commonly observed in the hexagonal Ba(Ti1-xTMx)O3-delta compounds. The newly discovered rhombohedral Ba(Ti1/3Mn2/3)O3-delta having characteristic of face-sharing prism corner-connected by oxygen atoms is a typical example in searching for novel multiferroics. Discrepancies between the ionic radii of the B- and A-site dopants and that of Ti and Ba as a function of the doping concentrations, i.e., the effects of oxygen vacancies and the electronic configurations of the dopants, are concluded to be the driving forces for the structural transitions.

The effects of the calcination temperature on the structure and properties of nanoparticles, and the ambient temperature on the photocatalytic reaction are discussed. The cubic structure of Co3O4 nanoparticles was obtained, and the grain size was between 14 and 19 nm at different calcination temperatures. Co3O4 calcined at 500 degrees C shows good photocatalytic performance. Without adding any sacrificial agent and cocatalyst, the amount of hydrogen and oxygen released in 5 h were 259.4 and 135.7 mu molg(-1), respectively. The results show that, with the increase of ambient temperature, the evolution rate of hydrogen and oxygen is accelerated, and the atomic ratio of hydrogen to oxygen is close to 2:1. In addition, the Co3O4 photocatalyst has good stability. Our study provides an environmentally friendly, low-cost, and efficient method for the preparation of cobalt oxide photocatalysts with excellent performance.

Its definite site configuration is favorable for exploring the actual active centers and corresponding reaction mechanism. At the atomic scale, the tunable site configuration, from central metal atoms, coordinated heteroatoms, peripheral dopants, and feasible polymetallic centers to the synergetic intrinsic carbon defects, can effectively augment the intrinsic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). From a practical viewpoint, the propagation strategies of single-atom sites, the loading-activity relation and the structural retention during practical tests are crucial for the industrial applications. Furthermore, the activity contribution of multiple additional active centers including the active carbon sites and the pony-size well-wrapped metal species should be acknowledged.

Microstructural evolution and self-healing mechanism of a 2D C/SiC-BCx composite under constant load in static wet oxygen and dynamic combustion atmosphere								MATERIALS AND CORROSION-WERKSTOFFE UND KORROSION				66	2			128	136		10.1002/maco.201307218				FEB 2015	2015	A 2D C/SiC-BCx composite was tested under static load in both wet oxygen and dynamic combustion atmospheres. The microstructural evolution and self-healing mechanisms of the composites were investigated by a scanning electron microscope. The results indicated that the multi-scale deflection of cracks played an important role in improving the performance of 2D C/SiC-BCx in both atmospheres. The glass phase could seal the matrix cracks and flow into the fiber bundles through the cracks. As a result, the fibers and fiber/matrix interface within 2D C/SiC-BCx were protected from oxidation. The retention rate of high-temperature tensile strength of 2D C/SiC-BCx got a significant improvement in wet oxygen atmosphere at 700 degrees C, compared with 2D C/SiC. The damage rate of 2D C/SiC-BCx remained in a smaller scope in dynamic combustion atmosphere. The damage rates of the 2D C/SiC-BCx were about 80% and 90% lower than that of 2D C/SiC, respectively at 700 and 900 degrees C.									7	1	0	0	0	0	8			0947-5117	1521-4176		WOS:000348731800005

Amorphous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with low-cost transition metals have attracted increasing attention in the catalytic field, yet metal atoms that are the main active sites are still ambiguous. Here, we synthesized a series of amorphous ternary Fe-x(NiCu)(3-x)-MOFs via an ultrasonic method. The optimal amorphous FeNiCu-MOF is found to be able to supply a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) merely at a low overpotential of 260 mV with a small Tafel slope of 61 mV dec(-1) and exhibits high durability over 24 h. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the Fe atoms are the main active sites for the OER in the FeNiCu-MOF. This work shows that amorphous ternary MOFs have great potential for application in OER electrocatalysts due to the multiple synergistic effects and amorphous MOF structures.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000850534300001	36069318

Herein, nanoframes of transition metal phosphides (TMPs) with the 3D framework carved open have been demonstrated as highly potent bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting, reaching the benchmark performance of the Pt/CRuO2 couple, and are much superior to their nanocubic counterparts. This excellent water splitting behavior can be attributed to the enlarged active surface area, less obstructed electrolyte infiltration, promoted charge transfer, and facilitated gas release. Further through in-depth activity analysis and post-electrocatalysis characterization, special attention has been paid to the fate and role of phosphorus in the electrocatalytic process, suggesting that despite the chemical instability of the TMPs (especially under OER conditions), excellent electrocatalytic stability can still be achieved through the amorphous bimetallic hydroxides/oxides formed in situ.									179	6	0	0	11	0	179			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000454938900011	30713644

Constructing a high density of interfaces is essential in maximizing synergistic interactions. Here, we demonstrate that Cu-ceria interfaces made by sintering nanocrystals facilitate C-C coupling reactions in electrochemical reduction of CO2. The Cu/ceria catalyst enhances the selectivity of ethylene and ethanol production with the suppression of H-2 evolution in comparison with Cu catalysts. The intrinsic activity for ethylene production is enhanced by decreasing the atomic ratio of Cu/Ce, revealing the Cu atoms near ceria are an active site for C-C coupling reactions. The ceria is proposed to weaken the hydrogen binding energy of adjacent Cu sites and stabilize an *OCCO intermediate via an additional chemical interaction with an oxygen atom of the *OCCO. This work offers new insights into the role of the metal-oxide interface in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to high-value chemicals.									39	6	0	0	3	0	38			2380-8195			WOS:000486361500028

Two extreme situations are described, characterized by a "consolidated rust layer" (at relatively low atmospheric salinities), formed by a diffusion-controlled corrosion mechanism in which the reduction of dissolved oxygen in the aqueous film deposited on the metal is the predominant cathodic reaction, and an "exfoliated rust layer" (at high atmospheric salinities), where the cathodic reaction of hydrogen evolution becomes important, notably accelerating the corrosion process. The research has employed a range of near-surface and bulk sensitive analytical techniques (SEM/EDS, mu XRD, and SEM/mu Raman) to characterize the corrosion products and rust layers formed.									40	0	0	0	0	0	40			0947-5117	1521-4176		WOS:000372014400001

Here, we report on the photoelectrochemical properties of plate-structured tungsten trioxide (WO3) thin films prepared from facet-controlled rectangular platelets of hydrotungstite (WO3 center dot 2H(2)O) and tungstite (WO3 center dot H2O), which are directly grown on tungsten substrates. The WO3 thin films, prepared via WO3 center dot 2H(2)O platelets, show relatively stable current for photoelectrochemical water splitting and methanol oxidation. On the other hand, the photocurrent of the WO3 thin films prepared via WO3 center dot H2O platelets was significantly decreased during the photoelectrochemical oxidation of water, which is likely due to the accumulation of partially oxidized intermediates such as peroxo species on the surface. These results indicate that the surface nanostructures of WO3 may have a significant influence on photoelectrode efficiency and selectivity for the catalytic oxygen evolution reaction.

However, the long-standing issue regarding the chlorine evolution reaction (CER) that deteriorates the performance of electrocatalysts and other components of electrolyzers has been impeding the market adoption of direct seawater electrolyzers. Herein, we demonstrate that coupling the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) taking place at the anode enables the alkaline-saline water electrolysis to occur at a high current density without the unfavorable, interfering CER. Using bifunctional carbon paper supported Co-Ni-P nanowires (Co-Ni-P/CP) as the cathode and anode, we have accomplished hydrogen production in the alkaline-saline-hydrazine electrolyte at 500 mA cm(-2) with a small cell voltage of only 0.533 V and outstanding stability of 80 hours with minimal degradation.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000701815800001

Herein, we use a needle-shaped iridium atom probe specimen as a nanosized working electrode to ascertain the role of the surface orientations in the formation of oxide species during OER. At the beginning of electrolysis, the top 2-3 nm of (024), (026), (113), and (115) planes are covered by IrO-OH, which activates all surfaces towards OER. A thick subsurface oxide layer consisting of sub-stoichiometric Ir-O species is formed on the open (024) planes as OER proceeds. Such metastable Ir-O species are thought to provide an additional contribution to the OER activity. Overall, this study sheds light on the importance of the morphological effects of iridium electrocatalysts for OER. It also provides an innovative approach that can directly reveal surface species on electrocatalysts at atomic scale.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000687954500001	34343398

Herein, we constructed NiO/NiS2 and Fe-NiO/NiS2 as catalyst models to study the effect of Fe doping. As expected, Fe-NiO/NiS2 exhibits a low overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The accumulation of hydroxyl groups on the surface of materials after Fe doping can promote the formation of highly active NiOOH at a lower OER potential. Moreover, we investigated the level of corrosion of M-S bonds and compared the stability variation of M-S bonds with Fe at different locations. Interestingly, Fe bonded with S in the bulk as the sacrificial agent can alleviate the oxidation corrosion of partial Ni-S bonds and thus endow Fe-NiO/NiS2 long-term durability. This work could motivate the community to focus more on resolving the corrosion of sulfur-containing materials.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000827291500001	35730933

Herein, facile and novel three dimensional (3D) needle grass-like CoHPO4 center dot H2O on Ni foam (CoHPO/NF) has been prepared as an effective and robust OER electrocatalyst for the first time. The unique 3D topological structure of CoHPO exposes more electrocatalytic active sites and facilitates mass transport. The coordinated HPO42- anions work as OH- traps to synergistically enhance the process of the OER. Because of these advantages, it exhibits an extraordinary OER performance with a low overpotential of only 350 mV at 50 mA cm(-2). Notably, it also exhibits excellent long-term stability. According to the theoretical calculations, the electron structure of the Co was significantly influenced by the coupled HPO42- species, which leads to superior activity for the OER. All the findings imply that CoHPO/NF is a promising material to substitute for noble metals in overall water splitting.									23	0	0	0	1	0	23			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000479314800030	31355384

WO3 photoanodes have been reported to produce peroxo species as well as O-2 during photooxidation reactions, and the accumulation of peroxo species on the surface is known to cause a gradual loss of photoactivity of WO3. The photocurrent to O-2 conversion efficiencies of the WO3 and WO3/Co-Pi OEC electrodes were obtained by simultaneously measuring the photocurrent and O-2 gas generated during illumination at 0.8 V vs Ag/AgCl. The result shows that the presence of OEC increases the photocurrent to O-2 conversion efficiency from approximately 61% to approximately 100%. The complete suppression of peroxo formation provided the WO3/Co-Pi OEC photoelectrode with long-term photostability. The photocurrent-potential characteristics show that the presence of OEC effectively reduces the electron-hole recombination near the flat band potential region and shifts the onset potential of photocurrent by 0.17 V to the negative direction. However, when the applied potential became more positive than approximately 0.35 V vs Ag/AgCl, the WO3/Co-Pi OEC electrode produced less initial photocurrent than the bare WO3 electrode. Mott-Schottky plots reveal the presence of interface states at the WO3/OEC junction that induce more electron hole recombination when the Fermi level moves below these states. Regardless of the adverse effect on recombination present at 0.8 V vs Ag/AgCl, the WO3/Co-Pi OEC achieved a more efficient and sustainable solar to O-2 conversion owing to the ability of Co-Pi OEC to significantly increase the photocurrent to O-2 conversion efficiency and prevent the photocurrent decay of the WO3 electrode.									484	19	0	0	33	0	487			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000287767200007

The electrodes were prepared by brush painting of iron substrates with a suspension of the respective oxide, prepared by solid-state reaction. The influence of the substituent on the electrodes electrocatalytic activity towards the OER is analysed in terms of the kinetic parameters obtained by steady state measurements and the cationic distribution proposed for the oxides. The data show that the introduction of Ni brings about the presence of Co3+ tetrahedrally coordinated in addition to the Co3+/Co2+ couple in octahedral sites, giving rise to a better electrocatalyst for the OER. In contrast the presence of Mn produces electrodes with lower catalytic activity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.									70	4	0	0	3	0	73			0013-4686			WOS:000178638400003

In this study, we synthesize nitrogen-doped, carbon-supported CoO catalysts (denoted as CoO/NCs) with high stability and activity. The CoO/NC is prepared by one-pot spray pyrolysis, which is simple and has an easily scalable synthetic route. In an effort to find a better catalyst composition for ORR activity, several catalysts are synthesized by controlling the concentrations of the solutions that contain carbon, urea as the nitrogen source, and a cobalt precursor. The catalysts are then characterized using various methods to comprehensively study their properties coupled with ORR kinetics and stability. The CoO/NC2 catalyst shows higher catalytic activity towards ORR than the other in-house prepared catalysts. It is comparable to commercial Pt/C and has very high stability for 80h in an alkaline medium. Systematic analyses clarify that the superior electrocatalytic performance of CoO/NC2 stems mainly from its enhanced electron density and pathway by heteroatom doping and its modified carbon nature during spray pyrolysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2196-0216			WOS:000440546600007

The electrocatalytic activity for the ORR with an onset and half-wave potential of 0.87 and 0.79 V, respectively, vs. RHE approaches that of commercial Pt/C catalyst. The durability and methanol tolerance are better than those of the commercial catalyst. The good performance could be attributed to the coupling effect between Co9S8/CoS and the bio-carbon substrate, as well as the robust submicron sphere morphology. Benefiting from the structural diversity of bacteria, this method can be extended to the synthesis of sulfide catalysts with other elaborate architectures.									16	4	0	0	0	0	16			2196-0216			WOS:000485947800029

Energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy (LRS) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to characterize these coatings. The results showed that both pH values favored the production of Ni-Co oxide phases, independent of the electrochemical technique used. The EDS analysis indicated that it was possible to produce of oxides coating presenting different Ni:Co ratios using electrodeposition process. However, the morphology, the microstructure and the electrocatalytic ability of the coatings depended on both the pH and on the electrochemical technique used to produce them. The coatings produced using pH 10.5 were suitable to be used as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1516-1439	1980-5373		WOS:000430187600108

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging as attractive candidates for OER electrocatalysts. Herein, a two-dimensional Fe-Ni MOF of Fe(py)(2)Ni(CN)(4) (py = pyridine) is synthesized controllably to generate various nanostructures, including nano-boxes, nanocubes, nanoplates, and nanosheets. Since different morphologies expose different active crystal planes and generate disparate intrinsic active sites, these nanostructures exhibit obviously different electrocatalytic activities. Particularly, the nanoboxes with a hollow structure display superior electrocatalytic activity and stability for OER due to greater active surface area and higher intrinsic activity of the exposed crystal planes, delivering a low overpotential of 285 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel value of 50.9 mV dec(-1) in a 1.0 M KOH solution.

However, its practical application hinges on significant cost reduction by using novel synthetic methods and further improvement of the catalytic activity by increasing the density of catalytically active site. Here we report a low-cost, scalable, synthetic method for preparation of NG via pyrolysis of graphene oxide with a rationally selected N source polypyrrole. Because of the large number of N atoms in pyrrole ring, polypyrrole can facilitate the formation of graphitic N, which is considered vital for high catalytic activity. The resulting 3D porous structure of NG has an N doping level of 2-3 at%, of which as high as 44% are graphitic N. Electrochemical characterizations show that NG has high catalytic activity toward ORR in an alkaline electrolyte via a favorable four-electron pathway for the formation of water, leading to high performance and low polarization loss. The NG also displays excellent long-term stability and resistance to methanol crossover, offering performance characteristics superior to those of a commercial Pt/C catalyst. The effect of pyrolysis temperature on the structure and property of NG are revealed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemical measurements, providing important insights into the rational optimization of electrocatalytic activity for ORR. In addition, the NG also shows high catalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER), rendering its potential application as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for both ORR and OER.

In this study, we elucidate the sensitivity of the Hubbard U correction in the PBE+U functional and the amount of exact exchange, alpha, in the hybrid HSE functional on the structural stability, catalytic activity, and electronic conductivity of pure and doped perovskite oxides, ABO(3) (A = La, Ca, Sr, and Ba; B = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) for oxygen evolution electrocatalysis. We find a strong dependence of heat of formations and reaction overpotentials for a range of U = 0, 3, and 5 eV and alpha = 0, 0.15, 0.25, and 0.35 values investigated in this study, which we attribute primarily to changes in the oxidation state of B cations. If the valence of B cations in the perovskite and reference oxide is the same, then the U and alpha dependences are very small. However, if the valences are different then heat of formations can change by as much as 1 eV. As the oxidation state of a surface metal ion depends on adsorbed intermediate and nature of the element, similar differences in energies appear in the calculated reaction overpotentials for oxygen evolution. The large U and alpha dependences set serious constraints on the use of DFT+U and HSE methods for assessing stabilities and catalytic activities of perovskite oxides. In addition, the large alpha dependence raises the question whether HSE calculations can improve sufficiently the accuracy of DFT+U results for multistep electrochemical reactions to justify the excess computational cost. Although we have investigated only one particular class of catalysts and one electrochemical reaction, the results of this study can expectantly be generalized to other strongly correlated systems in which the oxidation state of the surface changes during reaction. The influence of U on the electronic conductivity is significant only in cases where it qualitatively changes the electronic structure, by, e.g., opening the band gap. From a combinatorial analysis on pure and doped La perovskites, we identify electronically conductive catalysts classified according to different electron conduction types: intrinsic conductivity (Fe4+, Co3+ (intermediate spin, IS), and Ni3+), electron polaron hopping (along Mn3+-O-Mn4+ chains), and charge transport through holes in the valence band.									40	2	0	0	0	0	41			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000423140500016

Gale-silicate rocks and marbles, occurring as minor lithologies in the Kerala Khondalite Belt, show different mineral assemblages and reaction histories of which indicate a metamorphic P-T- fluid history dominated by internal fluid buffering during the peak metamorphism, followed by external fluid influx during decompression. The carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions of calcite from three representative metacarbonate localities show contrasting evolutionary trends. The Ambasamudram marbles exhibit carbon and oxygen isotope ratios (delta C-13 similar to 0 parts per thousand and delta O-18 similar to 20 parts per thousand) typical of middle to late Proterozoic marine carbonate sediments with minor variation ascribed to the isotopic exchange due to the devolatilization reactions. The delta C-13 and delta O-18 values of similar to -9 parts per thousand and 11 parts per thousand, respectively, for calcite from calc-silicate rocks at Nuliyam are considerably low and heterogeneous. The wollastonite formation here, possibly corresponds to an earlier event of fluid infiltration during prograde to peak metamorphism, which resulted in decarbonation and isotope resetting. Further, petrologic evidence supports a model of late carbonic fluid infiltration that has partially affected the calc-silicate rocks, with subsequent isotope resetting, more towards the contact between calc-silicate rock and charnockite. At Korani, only oxygen isotopes have been significantly lowered (delta O-18 similar to 13 parts per thousand) and the process involved might be a combination of metamorphic devolatilization accompanied by an aqueous fluid influx, supported by petrologic evidence. The stable isotope signatures obtained from the individual localities, thus indicate heterogeneous patterns of fluid evolution history within the same crustal segment.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1342-937X	1878-0571		WOS:000169593300010

Structural stability, catalytic activity, and electronic conductivity of pure and doped alpha-MnO2 for the OER are studied using density functional theory calculations. As model surfaces, we investigate the (110) and (100) facets, on which three possible active sites are identified: a coordination unsaturated, a bridge, and a bulk site. For pure and Cr-, Fe-, Co-, Ni-, Cu-, Zn-, Cd-, Mg-, Al-, Ga-, In-, Sc-, Ru-, Rh-, Ir-, Pd-, Pt-, Ti-, Zr-, Nb-, and Sn-doped -MnO2, the preferred valence at each site is imposed by adding/subtracting electron donors (hydrogen atoms) and electron acceptors (hydroxy groups). From a subset of stable dopants, Pd-doped alpha-MnO2 is identified as the best catalyst and the only material that can outperform pristine alpha-MnO2. Different approaches to increase the bulk electron conductivity of semiconducting alpha-MnO2 are discussed.									29	1	0	0	3	0	30			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000424762600016	29194999

Herein, we report an acid-alkali asymmetric-electrolyte electrolyzer (AAAE) that can achieve substantial energy saving for electrolysis hydrogen generation, thanks to the assistance of electrochemical neutralization energy (ENE) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). To this end, free-standing Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets on carbon cloth (Ni(OH)(2)-NSs/CC) is fabricated as catalytic anode for alkaline UOR, which manifests impressively high catalytic activity with delivering 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.32 V and long-term durability. The as-developed AAAE only requires an applied voltage of 0.66 V to release the electrolysis current of 10 mA cm(-2), yielding the H-2 Faraday efficiency close to 100 % along with H-2 production rate of 183.8 mu mol h(-1).									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			2196-0216			WOS:000501380700016

NiCo2S4 core-shell nanorods supported on nickel foam (NF) have been fabricated by a facile hydrothermal method. The electrochemical performance of NiCo2S4@NiCo2S4 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is studied. NiCo2S4@NiCo2S4/NF exhibits a significantly improved OER and HER performance with an overpotential of 200 mV at 40 mA/cm(2) and an overpotential of 190 mV at 10 mA/cm(2).

Herein, MgO/Co3O4/CeO2 was prepared for catalytic ozonation of ammonia in an aqueous solution. The influence of various reaction conditions was systematically investigated and optimized, in which the reaction kinetics was also analyzed. After doping Ce, the catalyst with Mg-Co-Ce molar ratio of 4:1:1 and calcined at 700 C for 3 h, has abundant surface oxygen vacancies and exhibited excellent performance for the selective catalytic oxidation of ammonia to gaseous nitrogen by ozone. It was found that the catalytic activity of catalysts was positively related to oxygen vacancies concentration on the composites surface, which might play a vital role in selective catalytic ozonation. Under the optimal conditions, the ammonia removal rate in MgO/Co3O4/CeO2 catalytic system was 0.03328 min(-1) (R-2 = 0.99942), about 2.1 times greater than that of MgO/Co3O4 (0.01597 min(-1), R-2 = 0.99813), and the selectivity was further enhanced from 73.57% to 86.94%. Moreover, the evolution of nitrogen and chlorine species was determined to discuss the mechanism of selective oxidation of ammonia in the low chlorine-containing solution. This study might promote the understanding of catalytic ozonation of ammonia to gaseous nitrogen selectively.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000799036000002	35526341

However, to date, the solar conversion efficiency using the established photocatalysts is still low. Herein, we report a new strategy for making a class of three-dimensional (3D) BiVO4/Fe-based (Ni1-xFex and Co1-xFex) layered double hydroxide (LDH) interface heterostructures for boosting the photoelectrocatalytic water oxidation performance. Compared with the BiVO4, the BiVO4/Ni0.5Fe0.5-LDH interface photoanode exhibits about 4-fold photocurrent enhancement at 1.23 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode and remarkable negative shift (320 mV) of the onset potential for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Theoretical calculations reveal that the enhanced photocatalysis for the OER is mainly attributed to the optimal light absorption and the acceleration of electron-hole separation enabled by the strong electronic coupling at the BiVO4/NiFe-LDH interface. The present work first highlights the importance of tuning the light absorption and the separation of carriers using interface engineering in enhancing the solar photocatalytic performance.									121	7	0	0	11	0	123			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000401930100056

Li4FeSbO6 is a new Li-rich layered oxide material with antiferro-magnet honeycomb structure. In this work, the electrochemical behavior, charging process and oxygen stability of LixFeSbO6 (0 <= x < 4) material are investigated by using the spin-polarized density functional theory. Moreover, climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method is used to calculate the Li ion migration properties. The results show that Li4FeSbO6 exhibits poor inherent conductivity with the band gap of 2.45 eV. During charging process, the structure presents the excellent volume stability. When Li is extracted, the charge compensation is mainly contributed by the oxygen atoms through analyzing the Bader charges of each element. In addition, oxygen evolution reactions will occur in LixFeSbO6 (x <= 1.5), which will decay the capacities during cycling process. Finally, we calculated that the lithium ion can diffuse in a three-dimensional pathway with the activation barriers from 0.36 eV to 0.67 eV.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000408181800019

Li2O2 growth can occur first by 1e(-) transfer to O-2, forming Li+-O-2(-) and then either chemical disproportionation of Li+-O-2(-) , or a second electron transfer to Li+-O-2(-) . We demonstrate that Li2O2 growth is governed primarily by disproportionation of Li+-O-2(-) at low overpotential, and surface-mediated electron transfer at high overpotential. We obtain evidence supporting this trend using the rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) technique, which shows that the fraction of oxygen reduction reaction charge attributable to soluble Li+-O-2(-)-based intermediates increases as the discharge overpotential reduces. Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) measurements of oxygen reduction support this picture, and show that the dependence of the reaction mechanism on the applied potential explains the difference in Li2O2 morphologies observed at different discharge overpotentials: formation of large (similar to 250 nm-1 mu m) toroids, and conformal coatings (<50 nm) at higher overpotentials. These results highlight that RRDE and EQCM can be used as complementary tools to gain new insights into the role of soluble and solid reaction intermediates in the growth of reaction products in metal-O-2 batteries.									77	2	0	0	6	0	77			1948-7185			WOS:000373867600020	26949979

The electrooxidation of bio-based HMF to furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), a crucial bio-based precursor of polyethylene furanoate (PEF), which would probably replace petroleum-based polyethylene terephthalate (PET), has recently attracted increasing attention. Here, we review the HMF electrochemical oxidation, from reaction pathway/mechanism to catalysts and coupling reactions. First, a pH-dependent reaction pathway is proposed, and the reaction mechanism (direct oxidation and indirect oxidation) is summarized systematically, which is also suitable for electrochemical oxidation of other small organic molecules containing aldehyde/alcohol groups (e.g., methanol, ethanol, glycerol, and glucose) to some extent. Then, the progress, advantages and disadvantages of HMF electrooxidation catalysts of noble metals, non-noble metals, and non-metals are reviewed, particularly on non-noble metal catalysts. Furthermore, for more efficient energy utilization, HMF electrooxidation coupled with H-2 evolution, CO2 reduction, N-2 reduction, and organic reduction are discussed. Finally, a few unique insights into reaction mechanism, an assessment about catalyst performance and an outlook for further development of this topic are provided. This review can offer a guideline for the in-depth understanding of electrochemical oxidation of small organic molecules as well as the design of advanced anodic electrocatalysts towards the utilization and production of renewable resources.									57	1	0	0	3	0	57			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000654372800001

We applied porous cobalt manganese oxide (CMO) nanocubes as the cathode electrocatalyst in rechargeable seawater batteries, which are a hybrid-type Na-air battery with an open-structured cathode and a seawater catholyte. The porous CMO nanocubes were synthesized by the pyrolysis of a Prussian blue analogue, Mn-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)center dot nH(2)O, during air anneal ing, which generated numerous pores between the final spinel-type CMO nanoparticles. The porous CMO electrocatalyst improved the redox reactions, such as the oxygen evolution/reduction reactions, at the cathode in the seawater batteries. The battery that used CMO displayed a voltage gap of similar to 0.53 V, relatively small compared to that of the batteries employing commercial Pt/C (similar to 0.64 V) and Ir/C (similar to 0.73 V) nanoparticles and without any catalyst (similar to 1.05 V) at the initial cycle. This improved performance was due to the large surface area (catalytically active sites) and the high oxidation states of the randomly distributed Co and Mn cations in the CMO. Using a hard carbon anode, the Na-metal-free seawater battery exhibited a good cycle performance with an average discharge voltage of similar to 2.7 V and a discharge capacity of similar to 190 mAh g(hard carbon)(-1) during 100 cycles (energy efficiencies of 74-79%).									58	4	0	0	2	0	60			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000389624600018	27934150

However, the high cost and limited supplies of Pt limit its broad use in commercial applications. Designing highly efficient Pt electrocatalysts can reduce material cost and enable commercial success for a wide variety of electrochemical technologies. Herein, we prepared Pt/MnOx and Pt/MnO electrocatalysts via deposition-precipitation and H-2-reduction approaches. The Pt mass activities towards the ORR at 0.7 V for the Pt/MnOx, and Pt/MnO catalysts were 4.0 and 3.7 A mg(Pt)(-1), respectively, which were 20, and 18.5 times as commercial 20% Pt/C catalyst. The transferred electron numbers (n) were 3.6 and 4.0 for Pt/MnOx and Pt/MnO, respectively. Moreover, Pt/MnO catalyst exhibited a good ORR stability after 500 cycles compared to Pt/MnOx catalyst in 0.1 M KOH.					8th Japan-China Workshop on Environmental Catalysis and Eco-Materials8th Japan-China Workshop on Environmental Catalysis and Eco-Materials	DEC 05-06, 2017DEC 05-06, 2017		Tsukuba, JAPANTsukuba, JAPAN	24	4	0	0	1	0	25			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000468158600016		
J	Rajbala; Sharma, Abhishek; Bhatia, Divesh								Use of crystallite-scale features to predict the reactor-scale performance of a three-way catalyst								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE				186				240	250		10.1016/j.ces.2018.04.030				AUG 31 2018	2018	A model incorporating the geometry features, transport, and reactions at the crystallite scale is developed to predict the features of a three-way catalyst during cyclic lean and rich conditions. The reactions on the metal crystallite, metal-ceria interface, and ceria surface are considered and the coupling between these reactions and the spillover processes is incorporated. The crystallite-scale model is integrated with the reactor-scale model to predict the experimental concentration profiles for CO oxidation. It is shown that the dependence of oxygen surface diffusivity on temperature can be used to predict the experimental data. It is quantitatively shown that in addition to the active surface area, the interfacial perimeter plays a key role in the spillover and reverse spillover processes. In agreement with the reported trends, the model predicts that the incomplete regeneration of the catalyst at low temperatures is responsible for the low values of oxygen storage capacity. A low but consistent evolution of CO2 occurs for low dispersions in contrast to the high amount of CO2 during the initial few seconds of the rich phase for a high dispersion catalyst. Fundamental insights obtained in the present work are expected to be applicable to other catalysts which involve the spillover effects. To the best of our knowledge, a model which incorporates the geometry features, transport phenomenon and reactions at the crystallite scale and its integration to predict the reactor-scale data under flow conditions for a three-way catalyst has not been reported elsewhere.

The refining process primarily consists of removal of impurities from the hot metal to a permissible level. The impact of oxygen jet on the surface of the hot metal bath results in ejection of droplets, which mix with slag and form emulsion. The formed emulsion plays an important role in refining reactions kinetics and understanding of this process is required todevelopimproved process control model for the steel industry. In this paper, cellular automata technique has been explored to simulate decarburization in emulsion caused by interfacial reactions between the metal droplets and slag. In the course of the work, a framework has also been developed to quantify the contribution of carbon monoxide, generated by decarburization, in bloating of metal droplets and formation of halo around the droplets. The model has incorporated diffusion and decarburization reaction based on probabilities to study the evolution of the system. Simulations with varying parameters have been performed and decarburization trends obtained are comparable with the experimentally determined data reported in literatures.					5th National Conference on Processing and Characterization of Materials (NCPCM)5th National Conference on Processing and Characterization of Materials (NCPCM)	DEC 12-13, 2015DEC 12-13, 2015	NIT, Dept Met & Mat Engn; Board Res Nucl Sci; Govt India, Dept Sci & Technol, Sci & Engn Res Board; OCL India LtdNIT, Dept Met & Mat Engn; Board Res Nucl Sci; Govt India, Dept Sci & Technol, Sci & Engn Res Board; OCL India Ltd	Rourkela, INDIARourkela, INDIA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1757-8981		*****************	WOS:000461151900001		
J	Li, Weimo; Wang, Ce; Lu, Xiaofeng								Integrated transition metal and compounds with carbon nanomaterials for electrochemical water splitting								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				9	7			3786	3827		10.1039/d0ta09495a				FEB 21 2021	2021	The development of highly efficient, low-cost and robust electrocatalysts for water splitting is urgently necessary to approach the energy crisis and environmental problems. In recent years, transition metal-based materials are commonly used as outstanding electrode materials for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to their tunable electrocatalytic activity and earth-abundance. However, they are restrained from the disadvantages of low conductivity, easy agglomeration and poor stability. Therefore, it is a good choice to integrate transition metal compounds with carbon materials to address the aforementioned issues. In this review, we focus on the recent progress of the fabrication of a variety of transition metal-based materials integrated with carbon matrices for HER, OER and overall water splitting. First, the fundamentals of the water splitting process and the introduction of parameters to determine the water splitting performance are given. Then, the advantages of the integration of transition metals and compounds with carbon for electrolytic water splitting as well as the influence of the architecture, composition, electronic structure and interface engineering of the hybrid materials on their electrocatalytic activities are discussed. The experimental and theoretical simulation are complementary to investigate the mechanism of the enhanced HER, OER and overall water splitting processes. Finally, challenges, perspectives and opportunities for developing new transition metals and carbon-based electrocatalysts in water splitting are featured.									39	1	0	0	2	0	39			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000621407000004

The pursuit of generating low-cost and effective catalyst for such purposes has motivated the material scientists and researchers to design and study the novel nanostructured materials both theoretically and experimentally. We have utilized the well-established state-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT) for envisaging the HER activity of the two-dimensionally confined Gallium Phosphide (GaP). The effect of substitutional defect caused by foreign atoms like boron and nitrogen on the structural, electronic and adsorption properties of the GaP nanowire is analyzed by incorporating the van der Waals dispersion correction. The energy differences and the contributions of the individual atomic species to the electronic energy states have been observed by computing the electronic density of states. Introduction of the defect in the system significantly modifies the electronic and adsorption properties of the system. The results suggest GaP to be highly active for hydrogen adsorption which further gets pronounced by introducing boron defect in the system. The results on adsorption energy and Gibbs free energy stipulating better adsorptive nature for hydrogen give confidence to utilize GaP as an HER catalyst by further tuning the adsorption response by means of defect engineering. In a nut-shell, we assert the dependence of material properties that are very sensitive to defects and the cause root beneath this response can serve as a blueprint for designing prominent materials for HER based applications.

Their applications as catalysts for H-2 evolution upon visible light were investigated. The oxygen insertion was accompanied by partial oxidation of Cu+. For CuYO2.25, the chemical analyses revealed the presence of mixed valent states containing at least formally an equal number of Cu+ and Cu2+. The thermal analysis (TGA) under reducing atmosphere indicates that oxygen is inserted in different crystallographic sites, for CuYO2.25 it exhibits a two-step reduction mechanism with restoration of the parent oxide. In air, CuYO2+x, is thermally stable up to 500 degrees C above which it undergoes irreversible conversion into Cu2Y2O5. They display p-type behavior ascribed to oxygen insertion and the conduction occurs by hopping mechanism between mixed copper valences. Under illumination, the oxides are stabilized by hole consumption reactions involving SO32- and S2- as holes scavengers. The flat-band potentials, lying between 0.17 and 0.26 V-SCE, allow a spontaneous H-2-photo formation. The rate of H-2-evolution is altered by the oxygen insertion and the best photo activity (1.33 mu mol h(-1) mg(-1)) was obtained over CuYO2.25 immersed in S2- solution (0.025 M); CuYO2 is also reported for a comparison goal. Over time, the photoactivity is slowed down because of the competitive reduction of H2O with the final products namely S2O62- and S-n(2-). (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we present systematic evaluation of Pt, Pd, and Ru nanopartides supported on rGO as OER electrocatalysts in Li-air cell cathodes with LiCF3SO3-tetra(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether (TEGDME) salt-electrolyte system. All of the noble metals explored could lower the charge overpotentials, and among them, Ru-rGO hybrids exhibited the most stable cycling performance and the lowest charge overpotentials. Role of Ru nanopartides in boosting oxidation kinetics of the discharge products were investigated. Apparent behavior of Ru nanoparticles was different from the conventional electrocatalysts that lower activation barrier through electron transfer, because the major contribution of Ru nanopartides in lowering charge overpotential is to control the nature of the discharge products. Ru nanopartides facilitated thin film-like or nanoparticulate Li2O2 formation during oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which decomposes at lower potentials during charge, although the conventional role as electrocatalysts during OER cannot be ruled out. Pt-and Pd-rGO hybrids showed fluctuating potential profiles during the cycling. Although Pt- and Pd-rGO decomposed the electrolyte after electrochemical cycling, no electrolyte instability was observed with Ru-rGO hybrids. This study provides the possibility of screening selective electrocatalysts for Li-air cells while maintaining electrolyte stability.									128	8	0	0	10	0	129			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000357964100004	26115340

The CN "shell" matrix embeds PdCoNi alloy NPs and covers homogeneously the carbon "core". The chemical composition of the materials is determined by inductively-coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and microanalysis; the structure is studied by powder X-ray diffraction (powder XRD); the morphology is investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). The surface activity and structure are probed by CO stripping. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics, reaction mechanism, and tolerance towards contamination from chloride anions are evaluated by cyclic voltammetry with the thin-film rotating ring-disk electrode (CV-TF-RRDE) method. The effect of N concentration in the matrix (which forms "coordination nests" for the Pd-based alloy NPs bearing the active sites) on the ORR performance of the electrocatalysts is described. Results show that N atoms: 1) influence the evolution of the structure of the materials during the preparation processes, and 2) interact with alloy NPs, affecting the bifunctional and electronic ORR mechanisms of active sites and the adsorption/desorption processes of oxygen molecules and contaminants. Finally, the best PdCoNi electrocatalyst shows a higher surface activity in the ORR at 0.9 V vs. RHE with respect to the Pt-based reference (388 mu Acm(Pd)(-2) vs. 153 mu Acm(Pt)(-2)).									80	1	0	0	4	0	80			2196-0216			WOS:000340523300014

Transition metals with empty d-orbitals achieve NRR activity via a "pi back-donation" process. However, the problem in overcoming hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) competition makes the exploration of transition metal-based catalysts with relatively inferior HER activity worthwhile. The challenges lie in designing a rational structure for efficient NRR. Herein, Ni3+ and oxygen vacancies were synergistically integrated on NiO@TiO2 by magnetron sputtering, which provide this transition-metal oxide-based (TMO-based) material with "pi back-donation" behavior. Accordingly, NiO@TiO2 exhibited NH3 yield (similar to 10.75 mu g h(-1) cm(cat.)(-2)) and faradaic efficiency (similar to 9.83%), which are nearly 10-fold higher relative to those of TiO2 in neutral media. This work provides an efficient strategy for engineering "pi back-donation" sites, and holds great potential in exploring new TMO-based electrocatalysts.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000744600400001

Here, the carbon quantum dots (CQDs) modified anatase/rutile TiO2 photoanode (CQDs/A/R-TiO2) was designed by growth of anatase TiO2 nanothorns on ruffle TiO2 nanorods and further surface modification of CQDs. The results revealed that the A/R-TiO2 heterojunction significantly suppressed the bulk recombination of photogenerated carriers. With further incorporation of CQDs into A/R-TiO2, dramatical improvement of OER kinetics and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) light harvesting were obtained. The bulk charge separation efficiency (eta(bulk)) and surface charge injection efficiency (eta(surface)) of CQDs/A/R-TiO2 are 1.69 and 5.74 times higher than that of the pristine TiO2 at 0.6 V vs. RHE, respectively. Meanwhile, the photocurrent is increased by 11.72 times and the onset potential is negatively shifted by 240 mV for CQDs/A/R-TiO2.									69	5	0	0	12	0	70			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000532683200034

The metallic MoO2 core facilitates electron transfer, and the interfaces between MoS2 nanosheets and Ni2P nanoparticles enhance catalytic activity both for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Due to this unique structure, the obtained NiMoO-SP/Ti showed an enhanced OER performance in alkaline solution with a small Tafel slope of 85 mV dec(-1) and a low overpotential of 280 and 360 mV to achieve 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. The catalyst also exhibited an excellent stability in 1.0 M KOH, with just 12 mV shift after electrolysis at 10 mA cm(-2) for 16 h and 27 mV shift after electrolysis at 20 mA cm(-2) for another 24 h. In addition, the NiMoO-SP/Ti also displayed high catalytic properties towards HER with a small Tafel slope of 77 mV dec(-1) and a low overpotential of 159 mV to obtain 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. After electrolysis at -10 mA cm(-2) for 40 h, the overpotential increased by just 25 mV, which demonstrated its high stability for HER in 1.0 M KOH. This work provides an effective route to designing a high-performance catalyst with a favorable structure for the development of electro-catalysts for water splitting.									39	3	0	0	0	0	39			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000415666500025	29095460

Here, we show that acidic oxygen functional groups are developed on activated carbon fiber cloth during carbon-catalyzed NO oxidation. Reaction and thermal desorption cycle experiments demonstrate the continuous addition of oxygen to carbon as carbonyl and carboxyl functional groups. After four cycles, the oxygen content of carbon increased by 280%. There is also a 65% reduction in the time required to release NO2 from the carbon surface, allowing the reaction to achieve steady-state NO conversion 45% faster. The steady-state NO oxidation rate remains constant during the four cycles (48.5 +/- 1.6 mu mol/h), which is attributed to stable physical properties of carbon during the cycles. Oxygen groups added during the cycles, therefore, have no detectable impact on the overall conversion of NO over carbon, but control the pathway to achieving stable conditions. Carbon catalysts prepared with acidic oxygen functionalities are promising as NO oxidation catalysts, as confirmed with NO2 and nitric acid treatments. It is proposed that carbon's chemical properties impact NO oxidation kinetics while carbon's physical properties impact the steady-state NO oxidation rate. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we develop a facile and melamine-assisted-pyrolysis (MAP) strategy for the synthesis of core-shell Co-based electrocatalysts@N-doped carbon nanotubes (Co@CNTs) derived from metal-organic frameworks. The Co@CNTs exhibited excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic performance for both oxygen evolution and reduction. DFT calculations demonstrated that the Gibbs free energy of the rate-determining step was small enough to improve ORR activities. As a result, a Zn-air battery assembled with Co@CNTs proves a lager power density, low voltage gap between charge-discharge and excellent stability. Thus, this work offers a facile strategy to realize the synthesis of non-noble metal electrocatalyst for Zn-air battery materials with high electrochemical performance.

Herein, we report on the crafting of heterostructured electrocatalysts that integrate semiconducting two-dimensional (2D) bimetallic metal-organic framework nanoplatelets (i.e., MOF-Fe/Co, where Fe/Co = 1/2) and ferroelectric nanoparticles (NPs) with high dielectric constant (kappa similar to 270 for BaTiO3 NPs) for high-efficiency oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The OER activity of the BaTiO3@MOF-Fe/Co heterostructures was tested under a basic condition (1.0 M KOH), demonstrating an overpotential of 247 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 38.4 mV dec(-1), and a double-layer capacitance (C-dl) of 85.6 mF cm(-2), which outperformed the neat MOF-Fe/Co (i.e., 281 mV, 72.1 mV dec(-1), and 37.3 mF cm(-2), respectively). The density functional theory (DFT) calculation revealed that the effective electronic modulation between tetragonal BaTiO3 NP and MOF-Fe/Co nanoplatelets induced an apparent reduction in the free energy barrier for the transformation from O* to OOH* and desorption of O-2. More importantly, both experimental and DFT results corroborated that the self-polarizing ferroelectric BaTiO3 NPs with a high dielectric constant generated a favorable local electric field and enhanced the charge conductivity of the MOF-Fe/Co moieties in the heterostructure, leading to a superior OER catalytic activity. This work not only presents a simple yet robust route to creating heterojunctioned nanostructures for highly efficient OER, but also provides a unique platform for designing superior, noble metal-free OER electrocatalysts via judiciously incorporating ferroelectric, high-kappa nanomaterials.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000754753600001

In nature, photon energy is converted to the chemical energy in the Oxygen Evolving Center (OEC) of Photosystem II. Inspired by the cubane structure of OEC, several molecular complexes have been demonstrated for the effective water oxidation in homogeneous medium. In addition, a large number of transition metal based molecular complexes have been explored for the hydrogen evolution reaction. In all these cases, synthesis of the new molecular complexes largely depends on the ligand designing. Generally, three different types of ligands have been explored: (i) spectator ligands (ii) redox active ligands and (iii) redox non-innocent ligands. Redox active and redox non-innocent ligands play an important role in controlling the electron transfer properties of the metal centers and hence the metal bound substrates. As a result, the water oxidation and hydrogen evolution activity is largely affected by the redox properties of the ligands. In this review, we have highlighted the designing of redox active and redox non-innocent ligands, their redox properties and control over the electron transfer from the metal center. The major developments in this field and potentiality for the future progress with the redox active and redox non-innocent ligands derived molecular complexes have been described. In addition, comparison between the natural and artificial photosystem has been described for a better understanding of this subject and future development.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			0020-1693	1873-3255		WOS:000522645200030

Facile preparation was realized by dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) microplasma, which owns a great chemical reactivity to obtain 3D open structures. The prepared 3D CoO@NiFe LDH/NF emerges a superior catalytic activity for oxygen evolving reaction (OER) in alkaline media, which only demands an overpotential of 225 mV at 20 mA cm(-2). The asprepared electrocatalyst provides excellent long-term durability (>80 h) and a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.59 mol O-2 s(-1) at 350 mV. Compared to the 2D NiFe LDH/NF, the overpotential of CoO@NiFe LDH/NF can be directly reduced 52 mV at 20 mA cm(-2). The intermediate products of hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) were identified and the possible synthesis mechanism was tentatively proposed. We believe the present work could provide new insight for the rational design of other efficient OER electrocatalysts by DBD microplasma.									22	0	0	0	3	0	22			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000621660200004		
J	Jiang, Minxia; Tan, Zhi; Cao, Minhua								A robust bifunctional electrocatalyst for rechargeable zinc-air batteries: NiFe nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				46	29						10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.02.079		APR 2021		APR 26 2021	2021	Developing high-efficiency, low-cost, and stable bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts is essential for the commercialization of rechargeable metal-air batteries. Herein, threedimensional self-assembled microspheres via in situ encapsulation of NiFe alloy nano particles (NPs) into N-doping carbon nanotubes (NiFe@NCNTs) have been achieved through pyrolyzing a mixture of nickel-iron alkoxide and melamine. The as-prepared electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance with a half wave potential of 0.79 V and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with a low over potential of 330 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The eminent activity of NiFe@NCNTs is ascribed to high dispersion of active sites (zero-dimensional core-shell structure of NiFe@NC) and onedimensional conductive network (NCNTs). Accordingly, the zinc-air battery assembled with NiFe@NCNTs as the air cathode exhibits a long cycling life of 200 h with a high energy efficiency of 65.6%. This work may shed new light on the design of advanced bifunctional electrocatalysts toward metal-air batteries. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

With the advantages of cost-effectiveness and feasibility of synthesis at room temperature, zeolite imidazole frameworks (ZIFs) are regarded as advanced precursors. But a majority of ZIF-derived catalysts show only one catalytic activity, which limits their performance in ZABs as well as the cycling stability. In addition, molybdenum carbide (MoC) is recognized as an excellent candidate for renewable energy conversion due to its good chemical resistance and thermal stability. Herein, we report a ZIF-67-derived Co/MoC-NC multiphase doped carbon bifunctional ORR/OER catalyst with multiple active sites for the cathode of ZABs. The synergistic catalysis of Co nanoparticles and MoC nanoparticles in Co/MoC-NC which are embedded in a thin layer of N-doped graphitic carbon and immobilized on N-doped graphitic carbon, respectively, demonstrates superior ORR catalytic performance and durability both under alkaline and acidic conditions (E-1/2 = 0.87 V in 1.0 M KOH and E-1/2 = 0.76 V in 0.5 M H2SO4). Simultaneously, Co/MoC-NC also exhibits favorable OER performance (10 mA cm(-2), eta = 320 mV) in 1 M KOH. Furthermore, a remarkable peak-power density of 215.36 mW cm(-2) and great cycling stability could be achieved while applying Co/MoC-NC in the cathode of ZABs (over 300 h). This work will provide a viable design concept for designing and synthesizing multifunctional catalysts to construct rechargeable ZABs.									2	0	0	0	0	0	1			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000849056500001	36047468

Herein, we report a Cl-anion-doped CuO (Cl-CuO) preparation method using deep eutectic solvents (DESs) as a green solvent, and the Cl-CuO/g-C3N4 heterostructure was successfully prepared in various weight ratios via a simple ultrasonication and mixing method for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media and the photocatalytic degradation of 4-nitrophenol. Cl- was doped into the CuO crystal lattice, as revealed by the XRD and XPS studies. The as-prepared Cl-CuO/g-C3N4 (1 : 2) exhibited a low overpotential of 0.77 V on the glassy carbon electrode with a current density of 33 mA cm(-2) at 2.4 V for OER in an acidic solution. Also, about 92% degradation of 20 ppm of 4-nitrophenol was achieved for Cl-CuO/g-C3N4 (1 : 2) in 100 minutes under the irradiation of a 35 W Xe arc lamp. We also evaluated the effect of thermal energy on degradation kinetics by tuning the temperature, which led us to the quantification of various thermodynamic parameters. To the best of knowledge, this is one of the new methods of green synthesis to fabricate photocatalysts for energy and environmental studies.									29	2	0	0	4	0	30			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000471911200048	30994137

Specifically, Y2CoMnO6 and Y2NiMnO6 nanorods with average diameters of 300 nm were prepared by a two-step hydrothermal method, in which the individual effects of synthetic parameters, such as the pH, annealing temperature, and precursor ratios on both the composition and morphology, were systematically investigated. When used as supports for Pt nanoparticles, Y2CoMnO6/Pt catalysts exhibited an electrocatalytic activity for the methanol oxidation reaction, which is 2.1 and 1.3 times higher than that measured for commercial Pt/C and Y2NiMnO6/Pt, respectively. Similarly, the Co-based catalyst support material displayed an ethanol oxidation activity, which is 2.3 times higher than both Pt/C and Y2NiMnO6/Pt. This clear enhancement in the activity for Y2CoMnO6 can largely be attributed to strong metal-support interactions, as evidenced by a downshift in the binding energy of the Pt 4f bands, measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which is often correlated not only with a downshift in the d-band center but also to a decreased adsorption of poisoning adsorbates. Moreover, when used as catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction, Y2CoMnO6 displayed a much greater activity as compared with Y2NiMnO6. This behavior can largely be attributed not only to a preponderance of comparatively more favorable oxidation states and electronic configurations but also to the formation of an active layer on the surface of the Y2CoMnO6 catalyst, which collectively gives rise to improved performance metrics and greater stability as compared with both IrO2 and Y2NiMnO6. Overall, these results highlight the importance of both the chemical composition and the electronic structure of double perovskites, especially when utilized in multifunctional roles as either supports or catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000821892500001	35759361

For many applications, the most desirable electrochemical characterization requires a three-electrode cell under potentiostat control. In high throughput screening, a material library is explored by either employing an array of such cells, or rastering a single cell over the library. To attain this latter capability with unprecedented throughput, we have developed a highly integrated, compact scanning droplet cell that is optimized for rapid electrochemical and photoeletrochemical measurements. Using this cell, we screened a quaternary oxide library as (photo)electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution (water splitting) reaction. High quality electrochemical measurements were carried out and key electrocatalytic properties were identified for each of 5456 samples with a throughput of 4 s per sample.

Here, by selecting appreciate precursors of dopamine and a Co-containing metal-organic framework of ZIF-67, we subtly couple their reaction processes to develop a facile approach for the synthesis of a hollow CoP nanostructure with N-doped carbon skeleton (H-CoP@NC). Benefiting from the highly porous nanostructure and conductive carbon skeleton, H-CoP@NC is capable of working as highly active and durable bifunctional electrocatalyst for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction. When further used as the electrocatalyst for overall water splitting, H-CoP@NC delivers excellent activity (cell voltage of 1.72 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)), close to that of the noble-metal-based benchmark catalyst couple of Pt/C parallel to RuO2. Our work thus provides new insights into the development of transitional metal phosphides based hollow hybrid nanostructures, particularly those with multiple functionalities in sustainable energy conversion technologies and systems.									32	4	0	0	1	0	32			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000494894400040	31603662

Herein, by using simple hydrothermal and nitridation methods, we realize the synthesis of novel three-dimensional (3D) flower-like CoN (CoN-F), CoN porous spheres (CoN-S), and polyhedral CoN (CoN-P) via utilizing various weak bases. Benefiting from a much larger surface area and a unique 3D flower-like architecture (consisting of 2D porous CoN nanosheets), the CoN-F catalyst shows highly exposed active sites and superior mass/electron transfer abilities. Naturally, the CoN-F catalyst exhibits more outstanding hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performance than either CoN-P or CoN-S. In order to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), 3D flower-like CoN-F needs only low overpotentials of 191.7 mV and 276.2 mV for the HER and OER, respectively. Furthermore, upon using the 3D flower-like CoN-F catalyst as both the anode and cathode material in a two-electrode overall water-splitting cell, the corresponding (-)CoN-F||CoN-F(+) cell achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.613 V in 1.0 M KOH, which is just 10 mV larger than a (-)Pt/C||RuO2(+) cell (1.592 V). It outperforms most existing non-precious-metal electrocatalysts, demonstrating superior water-splitting efficiency. In addition, the 3D flower-like CoN-F catalyst shows excellent stability during the alkaline HER and OER, and full water splitting. This work successfully opens a new pathway for boosting the HER/OER electrocatalytic abilities of CoN catalysts through structural design, which may promote the efficient utilization of metal nitrides in various energy storage and conversion devices.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2398-4902			WOS:000661589300001

IRnGs are prepared by a simple acid-catalyzed dehydration reaction between graphene oxide and aniline derivatives. Various electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents are introduced in the para-position of aniline to afford diverse IRnG electrocatalysts. Cyclic voltammetry and rotating ring disk electrode measurements show that the electrocatalytic activity of IRnGs for ORR is highly sensitive to the electronic characteristics of functionalities present in their chemical structures. Thus, the above ORR activities are significantly improved by increasing the electron-withdrawing capability of substituents, since this promotes the beneficial polarization of electrocatalytically active imine bond (-C=N-) in IRnGs. In addition, metal-free IRnGs electrocatalysts offer additional advantages of high selectivity, good long-term stability and excellent tolerance to methanol crossover for ORR in alkaline solution.

Major changes in the development of Earth's geochemical system were taking place at a critical time coinciding with the Archean-Proterozoic transition when Earth's atmosphere became oxygenated, thus triggering a whole new set of chemical weathering reactions. A paleoweathering crust on basalts of the Kuksha Volcanic Formation in the Paleoproterozoic Imandra-Varzuga Greenstone Belt, northwestern Russia developed between 2.5 and 2.44 Ga, just before the Great Oxidation Event and can potentially shed light on the paleoatmosphere composition and weathering modes of this time. The 3 m-thick Kuksha paleoweathering profile is characterized by Al-phyllosilicate clay minerals that are typical products of strong chemical weathering of igneous rocks. The mineralogy of the uppermost part of Kuksha weathering crust confirms formation under high CO2 partial pressures, consistent with previous estimates of pCO(2) exceeding 0.1 atm during that time interval. That is in agreement with the geochemical and mineralogical proxies thereby also suggesting an intense acidic weathering under low-oxygen conditions.									7	1	0	0	2	0	8			0301-9268	1872-7433		WOS:000471358100005		
J	Levine, J S								The early atmosphere:  a new picture.								Science activities				23	1			6	16						1986 Feb-Mar	1986	Over the last several years, many of the fundamental ideas concerning the composition and chemical evolution of the Earth's early atmosphere have changed. While many aspects of this subject are clouded--either uncertain or unknown, a new picture is emerging. We are just beginning to understand how astronomical, geochemical, and atmospheric processes each contributed to the development of the gaseous envelope around the third planet from the sun some 4.6 billion years ago and how that envelope chemically evolved over the history of our planet. Simple compounds in that gaseous envelope, energized by atmospheric lightning and/or solar ultraviolet radiation, formed molecules of increasing complexity that eventually evolved into the first living systems on our planet. This process is called "chemical evolution" and immediately preceded biological evolution; once life developed and evolved, it began to alter the chemical composition of the atmosphere that provided the very essence of its creation. Photosynthetic organisms which have the ability to biochemically transform carbon dioxide and water to carbohydrates, which they use for food, produce large amounts of molecular oxygen (O2) as a by-product of the reaction. Atmospheric oxygen photochemically formed ozone, which absorbs ultraviolet radiation from the sun and shields the Earth's surface from this biologically lethal radiation. Once atmospheric ozone levels increased sufficiently, life could leave the safety of the oceans and go ashore for the first time. Throughout the history of our planet, there has been strong interaction between life and the atmosphere. Understanding our cosmic roots is particularly relevant as we embark on a search for life outside the Earth. At this very moment, several radio telescopes around the world are searching for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0036-8121			MEDLINE:11542093	11542093

The self-assembled porous morphology associated with the metal/metal oxide active sites makes the whole surface of the electrode conducive toward catalyzing hydrogen and oxygen evolution in alkaline media at a low onset potential. The liquid-crystal-mediated free-standing electrocatalyst shows oxygen evolution at the onset potential of 1.38 V and at the potential of 1.66 V for a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). These potentials are comparable to the corresponding values for Ru/C (1.46 and 1.62 V, respectively). In addition, the promising hydrogen evolution performance of our composite compared to Pt/C in alkaline media makes it an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for comprehensive water splitting, as well as provides guidance for future electrochemical energy material technologies.									12	1	0	0	0	0	13			0934-0866	1521-4117		WOS:000411530200004

Whilst the majority of research has focused on the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER), herein we explore the use of 2D-MoS2 as a potential electrocatalyst for the much less researched Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR). We stray from literature conventions and perform experiments in 0.1 M H2SO4 acidic electrolyte for the first time, evaluating the electrochemical performance of the ORR with 2D-MoS2 electrically wired/immobilised upon several carbon based electrodes (namely; Boron Doped Diamond (BDD), Edge Plane Pyrolytic Graphite (EPPG), Glassy Carbon (GC) and Screen-Printed Electrodes (SPE)) whilst exploring a range of 2D-MoS2 coverages/masses. Consequently, the findings of this study are highly applicable to real world fuel cell applications. We show that significant improvements in ORR activity can be achieved through the careful selection of the underlying/supporting carbon materials that electrically wire the 2D-MoS2 and utilisation of an optimal mass of 2D-MoS2. The ORR onset is observed to be reduced to ca. +0.10 V for EPPG, GC and SPEs at 2D-MoS2 (1524 ng cm(-2) modification), which is far closer to Pt at +0.46 V compared to bare/unmodified EPPG, GC and SPE counterparts. This report is the first to demonstrate such beneficial electrochemical responses in acidic conditions using a 2D-MoS2 based electrocatalyst material on a carbon-based substrate (SPEs in this case). Investigation of the beneficial reaction mechanism reveals the ORR to occur via a 4 electron process in specific conditions; elsewhere a 2 electron process is observed. This work offers valuable insights for those wishing to design, fabricate and/or electrochemically test 2D-nanosheet materials towards the ORR.									73	2	0	0	7	0	73			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000381442500009	27448174

However, a facile synthetic method for realizing large-scale and low-cost supported noble metal catalyst is strictly indispensable. To this end, by making use of the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) and mechanochemical reaction, we introduce an efficient synthetic route to obtain ultrafine Pt and Ir nanoclusters immobilized on diverse substrates by wet chemical milling. We further demonstrate the scaling-up effect of our approach by large-scale ball-milling production of Pt nanoclusters immobilized on TiO2 substrate. The synthesized Pt/Ir@Co3O4 catalysts exhibit superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with only 230 and 290 mV overpotential to achieve current density of 10 and 100 mA.cm(-2), beating the catalytic performance of Co3O4 supported Pt or Ir clusters and commercial Ir/C. It is envisioned that the present work strategically directs facile ways for fabricating supported noble metal heterogeneous catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000729361200006

These production quality electrodes came from different backgrounds in terms of number of charge/discharge cycles, cycling temperature, electrolyte concentration, and cobalt level in the active material. The results of the matrix of tests using the flooded utilization (FU) technique demonstrated that capacity gains are available when cycling at lower temperatures and when higher concentrations of KOH are used as the electrolyte. Electrochemical voltage spectroscopy (EVS) scans were also taken for the complete matrix of tests. Since the cycling conditions used in the FU technique are much closer to those in actual cell cycling tests, they will be emphasized in this study in regard to the capacity trends. Comparative EVS scans were helpful in displaying the shifting potentials of the charging peaks of the active material relative to the oxygen evolution characteristics of these electrodes. The voltage span between the potential at which the active material is charged and the potential at which the co-evolution of oxygen becomes a significant parallel reaction determines the charging efficiency for the recharge step and is the root cause of the differences in useable electrode capacity.

J	Paffett, M.T.; Kelly, D.								The essential elements of modeling gas generation from well defined plutonium materials								5th Topical DOE Spent Nuclear Fuel and Fissile Materials Management								7 pp.	7 pp.						2002	2002	Processing of excess plutonium oxide (and related) materials intended for long-term storage is addressed in DOE Standard 3013-2000. The essential elements addressed by this standard are eliminating or reducing to an acceptable level the entities that lead to gas evolution and consequent pressurization of the intended storage container system. Based upon the need to adequately understand and quantify these relevant parameters we briefly describe the current scientific knowledge of gas evolution from such systems. These associated research efforts have included fundamental kinetic and thermodynamic studies of water interactions at actinide oxide surfaces, radiolytic reactions of adsorbed water, interfacial reactions of hydrogen and oxygen, and radiolytic helium production. Utilizing, where possible, experimental parameters for many of the aforementioned processes we have developed a mathematical model with a minimum number of essential components that successfully models gas generation from well-defined PuO2 materials with known amounts of deliberately added water. In this work we verify this model against real pressure versus time data (described at greater length in another manuscript in these conference proceedings) and subsequently assure the safety envelope of design criteria for both short- and long-term storage and transportation of these material classes. These modeling results predict pressures and gas phase mole fractions over well-defined DOE 3013 container test cases well in advance of actual long-term surveillance information and provide confidence in safe storage of plutonium oxide material classes.

It serves as a parent material for the development of functional derivatives for electrochemical applications including oxygen separation membranes, solid electrolyte cell electrodes and electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction. The present study is focused on the determination of the precise stability boundaries of cubic perovskite BSCF employing a coulometric titration technique in combination with thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray and neutron diffraction, and molecular dynamics simulations. Both the low-p(O-2) and high-p(O-2) stability boundaries at 700-950 degrees C were found to correspond to a fixed value of oxygen content in the perovskite lattice of 3 - delta = similar to 2.13 and similar to 2.515, respectively. The stability limits in this temperature range are expressed by the following equations: high-p(O-2) boundary: log p(O-2) (atm) (+/- 0.1) = -10 150/T (K) + 8.055; low-p(O-2) boundary: log p(O-2) (atm) (+/- 0.03) = -20 750/T (K) + 4.681. The p(O-2)-T phase diagram of the BSCF system under oxidizing conditions is addressed in a wider temperature range and is shown to include a region of precipitation of a "low-temperature'' phase occurring at 400-500 degrees C. The fraction of the low-temperature precipitate, which co-exists with the cubic perovskite phase and is stable up to 790-820 degrees C, increases upon increasing p(O-2) in the range 0.21-1.0 atm.									10	0	1	0	0	0	11			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000424357100062	29372747

Modulus mapping by Nano-indentation showed heterogeneous modulus distribution in the fibres treated in air, while no variation in modulus was observed in fibres processed in vacuum. Raman spectroscopy and elemental analysis revealed that the temperature dependent oxygen diffusion from skin to core of the fibres assisted in the evolution of higher extent of sp(2)-hybridized carbons in the skin compared to core of the air treated samples. Conversely, no radial structure variations were observed in the vacuum treated fibres. Higher modulus in the skin of air-treated fibres was due to the formation of compact structures which was associated with the enhanced intermolecular interactions facilitated by the formation of C=C bonds within the polymer backbone, promoted by oxidative-dehydrogenation reaction. Supporting these observations, the fracture morphology examined by SEM showed a brittle fracture in the skin and ductile fracture in the core. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

To achieve this goal, we have developed a bifunctional nanowire-structured FeP-CoP array catalyst on carbon cloth with uniform distribution through in-situ hydrothermal growth and phosphating treatment. The unique nanowire array structure and the strong electronic interaction between FeP and CoP species have been confirmed. Electrochemical studies have found that the designed Fe0.14Co0.86-P/CC catalyst appears excellent HER (130 mV@10 mA cm(-2))/OER (270 mV@10 mA cm(-2)) activity and stability. Moreover, the bifunctional Fe0.14Co0.86-P/CC(+/-) catalyst is also used in simulated industrial water splitting system, where the pair catalyst requires about 1.95 and 2.14 V to reach 500 and 1000 mA cm(-2), even superior to the control RuO2(+)parallel to Pt/C(-) catalyst, showing good industrial application prospects. These excellent electrocatalytic properties are attributed to the synergy between FeP and CoP species as well as the unique microstructure, which can accelerate charge transfer, expose more active sites and enhance electrolyte diffusion and gas emissions.

However, the mechanism behind capacity and voltage fading still needs further understanding. In this work, based on intensive analysis on crystalline phase and interface of the classical Li-rich cathode material, Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2 during charge-discharge processes, especially in the initial charge process, evolution mechanism of oxygen loss-induced phase transformation is illustrated in details. The irreversible anionic redox contributes to the large voltage plateau at 4.5 V during initial charging. As a result, oxygen vacancies forming on the surface reduce the barrier of the migration of transition metal ions into Li layer, causing severe cation mixing and initiating the phase transformation from a layered structure to a spinel structure. Meanwhile, the removal of Li+ and O2- from Li2MnO3 component brings about changes in lattice parameters. The evolution mechanism can be described in stages: starting from the first charge as the initiation stage; Li/transition metal cations mixing will continue to increase due to the existence of oxygen vacancies in the next few cycles, accompanying with accelerated phase transformation process; then it becomes relatively moderate under the protection of CEI film while still with inevitable structural changes over long cycling, reaching the accumulation stage.

J	Wu Dao-xin; Chen Qi-yuan; Li Jie; Yin Zhou-Ian; Xia Chang-bin								Photocatalytic oxidation of water to O2 over W-dopant of rutile TiO2								Chinese Journal of Nonferrous Metals				20	4			730	5						April 2010	2010	W doped rutile TiO2 powders with different W doping concentrations were prepared by low temperature ultrasonic hydrolysis using tetrabutyl titanate(C16H36O4Ti) as raw material. The powders were characterized by XRD, PL, DRS and BET. Using Fe3+ as electron acceptor, under condition of pH=2.0, UV irradiation and visible radiation, the effect of W doping concentration on the photocatalytic oxidation activity of rutile TiO2 particles was investigated. The results show that when W doping concentration is 1.0%-4.0%, W doping does not cause any change in rutile TiO2 crystal structure. Therefore, surface oxygen vacancies and the donor energy level near the bottom of the conduction band lead to easier departure of photoinduced electrons from holes to achieve stronger photocatalytic activity. The highest photocatalytic oxygen evolution and PL spectra intensity are achieved when the concentration of W is 2.0% , the O2 evolution speeds are 148.8 mumol/(L.h) and 102.9 mumol/(L-h) under UV irradiation and visible radiation, which are 30.6% and 65.7% higher than those before being doped.									0	3	0		0	0	3			1004-0609			INSPEC:11826264

An efficient water splitting electrocatalyst is considered an ideal future energy source. Well-aligned high-surface-area electrospun polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIM-1)-based nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers were prepared as a free-standing flexible electrode. A non-noble-metal catalyst NiOOH/Ni(OH)(2) was precisely deposited over flexible free-standing carbon nanofibers by using atomic layer deposition (ALD). The morphology, high surface area, nitrogen doping, and Ni states synergistically showed a low onset potential ((HER)=-40 and (OER)=290mV vs. reversible hydrogen electrode), small overpotential at (10) [oxygen evolution reaction (OER)=390.5mV and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)=-147mV], excellent kinetics (Tafel slopes for OER=50mVdec(-1) and HER=41mVdec(-1)), and high stability (>16h) towards water splitting in an alkaline medium (0.1m KOH). The performance was comparable with that of state-of-the-art noble-metal catalysts (e.g., Ir/C, Ru/C for OER, and Pt/C for HER). Post-catalytic characterization with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy further proved the durability of the electrode. This study provides insight into the design of 1D-aligned N-doped PIM-1 electrospun carbon nanofibers as a flexible and free-standing NiOOH/Ni(OH)(2) decorated electrode as a highly stable nanocatalyst for water splitting in an alkaline medium.									40	2	0	0	1	0	40			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000467235500022	30637965

Thus, the prepared Ru-pCo@NC catalyst with a low Ru loading of 3.13 wt% exhibits impressive HER catalytic behavior in 1 M KOH, with an overpotential of only 30 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), Tafel slope as low as 32.1 mV dec(-1), and superior stability for long-time running with a commercial 20 wt% Pt/C. The excellent electrocatalytic properties are primarily by virtue of the highly specific surface area and porosity of carbon support, uniformly dispersed Ru active species, and rapid reaction kinetics of the interaction between Ru and O.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2				2079-4991		WOS:000657007800001	34066561

Herein, we successfully engineered BiVO4 photoanode with Fe-doped CoP oxygen evolution catalysts (BiVO4-Fe/CoP) for the first time. Fe/CoP catalysts could significantly break the kinetic limitations of BiVO4, contributing to the enhanced charge injection efficiencies and charge carrier density. The rational heterostructure has boosted the photocurrent density and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) to 2.16 mA/cm(2) and 43% (7 times than that of the bare BiVO4), respectively. Meanwhile, the BiVO4-Fe/CoP photoanode also exhibited the desirable long-term stability during PEC water oxidation for 4 h.

Upon specific chemical reductions, this dielectric material can be turned into an oxygen solid electrolyte, a mixed conductor, or an electride. We followed the thermal evolution of the piezoelectric performances of as-grown samples and compared it with oxygen and hydrogen annealed ones. The structure of Ca12Al14O33 crystal was studied by powder x ray diffraction patterns, and the chemical processing efficiency was checked by optical transmittance measurements. The dielectric permittivity epsilon(11) and piezoelectric coefficient d(15) were found to be on the orders of 8-12 and 16-20 pC/N, respectively. This material exhibits good bulk shear wave coupling factor k(14) about 0.34 and promising surface acoustic wave (SAW) velocities of 3500 m/s that render it suitable for SAW devices as a substrate. The piezoelectric response of crystals before and after annealing under H-2 and O-2 is maintained. The observed evolutions may be related to the conductivity of the material or the electrical transport properties, which are known to be sensitive to the oxygen and the hydrogen content.

Developing robust HER and OER technologies necessitates a molecular picture of reaction mechanism, yet the reactants for water splitting reactions are unfortunately not fully understood. Here we utilize magnetic field to understand proton transport in HER, and hydroxide ion transport in OER, to discuss the possible implications on understanding the reactants for HER and OER. Magnetic field is a known tool for changing the movement of charged species like ions, e.g. the magnetic-field-improved Cu2+ transportation near the electrode in Cu electrodeposition. However, applying a magnetic field does not affect the HER or OER rate across various pH, which challenges the traditional opinion that charged species (i.e. proton and hydroxide ion) act as the reactant. This anomalous response of HER and OER to magnetic field, and the fact that the transport of proton and hydroxide ion follow Grotthuss mechanism, collectively indicate water may act as the universal reactant for HER and OER across various pH. With the aid of magnetic field, this work serves as an understanding of water might be the reactant in HER and OER, and possibly in other electrocatalysis reactions involving protonation and deprotonation step. A model that simply focuses on the charged species but overlooking the complexity of the whole electrolyte phase where water is the dominant species, may not reasonably reflect the electrochemistry of HER and OER in aqueous electrolyte.

Herein, a hierarchicalheterostructure was constructed on three-dimensional (3D) Nifoam, which contains Ni3S2nanorods decorated with both Co9S8and amorphous MoSxnanosheets and Ni3S2nanowires decoratedwith amorphous MoSxnanosheets, namely, MoSx@Co9S8@Ni3S2/NF. The synergistic effects from the strong interactions of theheterointerface and unique hierarchical heterostructure endow theMoSx@Co9S8@Ni3S2/NF with abundant active sites and effectivemass and electron transport pathways, resulting in excellent activitytoward both HER and OER in 1 M KOH. It only gives a lowoverpotential of 76.5 mV to achieve 10 mA cm-2for HER and a low overpotential of 310 mV to achieve 100 mA cm-2for OER.Based on the superior catalytic activity of MoSx@Co9S8@Ni3S2/NF for OER and HER, we demonstrated the activity of overall watersplitting using MoSx@Co9S8@Ni3S2/NF as both the anode and cathode. It shows a higher catalytic activity for overall water splittingwith a low cell voltage of 1.52 V at 10 mA cm-2than commercial Pt/C/NF||IrO2/NF (1.61 V) and superior stability.

Nevertheless compared to the two-electron process of HER, OER, a four-electron process, is of the inherently kinetic hysteresis step, which can dramatically diminish the overall energy conversion efficiency. The highly active noble-metal-based catalyst RuO2 is considered to be one of the most efficient state-of-the-art OER catalysts. However the high cost and element scarcity significantly hinder their practical applications. Thus it is particularly urgent to develop highly-active but low-cost non-noble-metal alternatives. Iron/nickel alloy based catalysts have been widely studied owing to their promising performances. In this work, we prepared iron/nickel alloy nanoparticles embedded in N-doped hierarchically porous carbon (Fe0.64Ni0.36@NC), by simultaneously adsorbing metal precursors and dopamine on surface of SiO2 macroporous hard templates, and then annealing the system and etching the templates. In electrochemical measurements, Fe0.64Ni0.36@NC shows a superior OER activity in alkaline solution, which only needs an overpotential as low as 286 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2), being significantly lower than the value of 380 mV for RuO2. Besides, the catalyst displays no obvious activity decrease after 2000 cycles of continuous CV scanning, corresponding to an excellent durability. The observed nice performances of the alloy catalyst in alkaline solution can be ascribed to two critical structural features: (1) the macroporous structures made by stacking of SiO2 microspheres own relatively thin layer of carbon framework, thus the embedded iron/nickel alloy particles can well activate the surrounding carbon layer to expose copious active sites; (2) the graphitized N-doped carbon layers well protect the alloy nanoparticles from corrosion, thus improving the durability of the catalysts. This work gave a nice design for the highly efficient non-noble-metal OER catalysts.									5	5	0	0	0	0	5			0567-7351			WOS:000466287100009

Some of these effects can be alleviated by the development of efficient devices that are capable of producing hydrogen gas in an environmentally acceptable manner, which in turn can be employed as a clean fuel. In this context, the splitting of water is especially attractive. However, this technology requires the design of new cost-effective electrocatalytic materials. In this review, the progress made in the development of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and their composites as electrocatalysts for both acidic and alkaline electrolysis cells and as photocatalysts for the formation of hydrogen is described and discussed. Following a short introduction to the mechanisms of the electrochemical hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions and the photoelectrochemical generation of hydrogen, an introduction to TMDs, their relevant general properties and the methods used in their synthesis are described. Then, the performance of various TMD-based materials in the electrochemical splitting of water is discussed, with a final brief overview of the application of TMDs in photoelectrochemical devices. Although challenges clearly remain, TMD-based materials are emerging as promising electrocatalysts and photoelectrocatalysts for the production of hydrogen.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000806541800001

In this work, a nanostructure of 2D Fe-doped NiO nanosheets (NiFexO) with grain boundary defects was designed and applied in the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction. This nanomaterial was synthesized through a solvothermal strategy followed by a thermally driven conversion process. In general, NiFexO electrocatalysts were fabricated with gradual morphological variation depending on the atomic ratio of Ni : Fe. It is surprising that the Fe content determines the electrocatalytic performance and the overpotential of water oxidation exhibits an inverted volcanic pattern. As expected, the as-prepared 2D NiFe0.1O nanosheets with grain boundary defects exhibit enhanced OER activity (274 mV@10 mA cm(-2)) compared with the oxide electrocatalyst reported in 1.0 M KOH owing to the advantages of abundant active sites. This work will shed light on the design and fabrication of novel-structured nanocatalysts.									20	2	0	0	0	0	20			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000536730100016	32347227

Nanometer size Ru(0.7)Ir(0.3)O(2) and Pt/C were employed as anode and cathode catalysts respectively. The catalyst coated on membrane (CCM) method was used to fabricate the membrane electrode assemblies. The membrane, oxygen evolution catalysts and MEAs were characterized with SEM, XRD and TEM. The influence of high temperature and pressure was investigated using in situ electrochemical measurements. Increasing temperature and pressure produced higher current densities for oxygen evolution, and smaller terminal voltages. The high temperature PEMWE achieved a voltage of 1.51 V at a current density of 1 A cm(-2), at 130 degrees C and 4 bar pressure. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Highly nonwettable carbon nanoparticle cathode/electrolyte interface with a freely diffusing electron acceptor kinetically muted water decomposition due to reduced contact between water and the electrode, expanding the working voltage far beyond 1.23 V. Zn battery equipped with hydrophobic carbon nanoparticle cathode delivered an open-circuit voltage (OCV) of 2.6 V with capacity (similar to 930 mAh/g), energy (similar to 2420 Wh/kg @ 50 mA/cm(2)), and power densities (similar to 83 W/kg) remarkably higher than conventional Pt-based aqueous Zn-air batteries (OCV = 1.5 V,similar to 650 mAh/g, similar to 1161 Wh/kg, and similar to 43 W/kg). When probed with in situ and ex situ FTIR spectroelectrochemistry and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, wettable carbon particles (contact angle =similar to 20 degrees) are found to catalyze parasitic oxygen evolution reaction, while their nonwettable counterpart (contact angle = similar to 117 degrees) dominantly catalyzed electron acceptor's redox reaction by inhibiting any such parasitic chemistry. Zn batteries equipped with carbon cathode contribute to a Pt-free battery having a closed cathode, addressing the complexity of carbonate clogging and electrolyte evaporation often encountered in open-air batteries, and could be used to power electrical appliances.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1932-7447			WOS:000394924800005

The electrocatalytic enhancement is explained by the formation of new crystalline phases, such as NiOOH and Ni(OH)2.

By adjusting the content of iron in Fe-Ni2P, optimal OER performance is achieved (Ni/Fe = 1.67). rGO@Fe-Ni2P displays pronounced alkaline OER activity with a small overpotential (260 mV vs RHE) at a current density of 10 mA cm(2), and a low Tafel slope (35.7 mV dec(-1)) with long-term durability (17 h). The superior catalytic performance of rGO@Fe-Ni2P is attributed to the rational incorporation of iron into Ni2P, leading to a higher valence of nickel with more oxidation ability and inducing faster OER process. In addition, highly conductive graphene promotes electron transfer for oxygen generation, improves the stability of the catalyst, and provides more active sites facilitating the OER process.

Exploring highly efficient, stable and cost-effective electrocatalysts is of crucial significance for sustainable HER. Here, we report the design of a coupled ruthenium/cobalt oxide (Ru/CoO) hybrid electrocatalyst for alkaline HER. In this hybrid metal/oxide system, the complicated alkaline HER pathways are overall facilitated; oxygen (O)-vacancy-abundant oxide enhances water splitting and Ru promotes successive hydrogen intermediates to generate hydrogen. The resulting Ru/CoO hybrid electrocatalyst exhibits significantly promoted catalytic activity compared with benchmark Ru catalyst, displaying an overpotential of 55 mV to generate a HER current density of 10 mA cm(-2), comparable with the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst and the most efficient alkaline HER electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the strong interaction of Ru nanoparticles with oxide support and the in-situ growth of oxide support on conductive substrate guarantee the long-term stability of as-fabricated Ru/CoO hybrid electrocatalyst. This newly designed hybrid catalyst with abundant metal/oxide interfaces may pave a new pathway for exploring efficient and stable HER electrocatalysts.

The as-prepared NWs have been characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. The intrinsic activities of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) over the obtained composite NWs are studied using a rotating-disk electrode technique. The RuO2/Co3O4 NWs exhibit superior bifunctional electrocatalytic activities for both the ORR and the OER if compared to the activities of the Co3O4 NWs and only Ketjenblack (KB). If the RuO2/Co3O4 NWs are employed as cathode catalysts in Li-O-2 cells, great improvements in terms of the discharge capacity, coulombic efficiency, and cycle stability with low discharge-charge overpotentials are achieved. These can be attributed to the high bifunctional catalytic activities of the RuO2/Co3O4 composite NWs.									19	2	0	0	0	0	19			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000411499300015

Developing a photoanode for the water oxidation reaction (oxygen evolving reaction, OER) is considered more challenging than designing a photocathode for the water reduction reaction (hydrogen evolving reaction, HER) because the OER requires a higher overpotential and displays a higher activation barrier. Since the work of Fujishima and Honda in 1972, intense research has been devoted to the development of photoelectrodes solely based on inorganic semiconductor materials. Nevertheless, the large majority of photoanodes using inorganic semiconductors weakly absorb in the visible spectrum and present poor long-term stability. An alternative design, more recently explored, is to decouple the light absorption and the catalytic function by adsorbing a molecular photosensitizer on an n-type semiconducting electrode (generally TiO2), to promote visible light absorption, and an oxygen-evolving catalyst to promote the OER. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review of such hybrid photoanodes that associate with a molecular photosensitizer and an oxygen-evolving catalyst based on metal oxide nanoparticles. For these hybrid photoanodes, tris(bipyridine) ruthenium complexes and organic dyes such as perylenes, free-base porphyrins, polyheptazine and pi-conjugated naphthalene benzimidazole polymers have been employed as molecular photosensitizers in combination with IrOx or CoOx OER catalysts. The preparation of these photoanodes, the evaluation of their photocatalytic performance for the OER, and the key factors that govern their efficiency and stability are highlighted.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			2398-4902			WOS:000503876500002

The oxide films were prepared, on stainless steel supports, using the thermal decomposition method at 400 degrees C. The EIS study was carried out to investigate the effect of the partial substitution of Co by Fe, in the oxide lattice, on the catatalytic performance towards the OER and also on the oxide film/1M KOH interface. The observed results have been compared with those reported in literature for similar oxide film electrodes, obtained by cyclic and steady-state voltammetries under similar experimental conditions. The EIS measurements were fitted, using an electrical equivalent circuit L (R(1)Q(1)) (R(2)Q(2)), in the oxidative process, from 0 V to 0.700 V vs. SCE. At each potential, a good correlation between experimental and simulated data is found, validating thereby the proposed equivalent circuit model.									21	0	0	0	0	1	21			1452-3981			WOS:000272246400003

Three surface-oxidized cobalt borides of Co-B-O@CoxB (x = 0.5, 1 and 2) have been synthesized that can functionalize as active catalysts in both alkaline water electrolysis and the hydrolysis of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) solution. It is discovered that oxidation layer and low boron content favor the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of Co-B-O@CoxB in alkaline water electrolysis. And surface-oxidized cobalt boride with low boron content is more active toward hydrolysis of NaBH4 solution. An alkaline electrolyzer fabricated using the optimized electrodes of Co-B-O@CoB2/Ni as cathode and Co-B-O@Co2B/Ni as anode can deliver current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.54 V for overall water splitting with satisfactory stability.

Poor electrocatalytic activities of the cathode catalysts toward both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are still two major challenges facing Li-O-2 batteries. Here, we report ultralong porous perovskite La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Mn0.2O3 nanofibers (LSCM NFs) loaded with RuO2 nanosheets (RuO2@LSCM NFs) used as a promising catalyst for Li-O-2 batteries. The LSCM nanofibers were synthesized via an electrospinning technique followed by heat treatment. RuO2 nanosheets were loaded by a wet impregnation method. In comparison with that of the pristine LSCM NFs, the cell with RuO2@LSCM NFs catalyst exhibits good performances toward the ORR and OER with a higher specific discharge capacity (12741.7 mA h g(-1)), improved cyclability, and rate capability as well as low voltage gap. Moreover, the results of LSV indicate that LSCM NFs can efficiently catalyze the decomposition of the reaction side product Li2CO3 while RuO2@LSCM NFs are capable of decomposing LiOH.

The chemo- and stereoisomeric reaction paths involving the two C-C double bonds of R-carvone 8 have been studied. DFT calculations account for the high chemoselectivity involving the C-C double bond of the isopropenyl group and the low diastereoselectivity, in complete agreement with the experimental outcomes. The Baeyer-Villiger reaction involving the carbonyl group of R-carvone 8 has also been analysed. A bonding evolution theory analysis of the epoxidation reaction shows the complexity of the bonding changes taking place along this reaction. Formation of the oxirane ring takes place asynchronously at the end of the reaction by attack of anionic oxygen on the two carbons of the isopropenyl C-C double bond.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6				2046-2069		WOS:000486208200020	35529642

On the other hand, copper compounds are among themost interesting OER catalysts. In this study, water oxidation of a Cu foil in the presence ofK2FeO4, a soluble Fe source, under alkaline conditions (pH approximate to 13) is investigated usingelectrochemical methods, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in situvisible spectroelectrochemistry, Raman spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy.After the reaction of the Fe salt with the Cu foil, a remarkable improvement for OER isrecorded, which indicates that either the Fe ions on the copper foil directly participate inOER or these ions are critical for activating copper ions on the surface toward OER.Indeed, a remarkable decrease (130 mV) in the overpotential is recorded for the Cu foil inthe presence of [FeO4]2-. Tafel slopes for the Cu foil in the absence and presence ofK2FeO4are 113.2 and 46.4 mV/decade, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopyshows that there is a strong interaction between Cu(II) and Fe(III) on the surface of the Cu foil. During OER in the presence ofCu(II) (hydr)oxide, Cu(III) is detected. In situ visible spectroelectrochemistry shows that Cu and Fe ions are dynamically active andprecipitate on the surface of the counter electrode during cyclic voltammetry (CV). The isotopic experimental data using H218Obased on Raman spectroscopy show that there is no change in the lattice oxygen. All of these experiments adopt a new perspectiveon the role of Fe in OER in the presence of a Cu foil under alkaline conditions									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000789034200024	35357139

Here, we report the astonishing performance of CuCr2O4(CCO)/anatase-TiO2 nanocomposite as a Fenton like catalyst with potential impact for sustainable design and environmental protection. All the materials were thoroughly characterized by several physico chemical techniques. CCO/TiO2 nanocomposite obtained by heat-treatment at 400 degrees C is found to exhibit high performance towards degradation of azo dyes like methylene blue (MB), rhodamine B (RhB) and methyl orange (MO), antibiotics like tetracycline hydrochloride and norfloxacine, and a promising Pt-free candidate for photoelectrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction under domestic light emitting diode (LED) light irradiation. CCO/TiO2 shows high recycling activity and chemical stability. Under domestic visible LED light irradiation, the electrons are photoexcited from the conduction band of CCO to that of TiO2 resulting in enhanced charge separation eventually facilitating the catalytic performance of the nanocomposite. TiO2 plays two primordial roles, firstly, it acts as an electron receiver to improve the charge separation in the nanocomposite and secondly, it participates in the Fenton like reaction.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000728528700005

Herein, we proposed that taking a core-shell structure of Mo/Te as an example, its stability can be largely improved by the facile Fe-doping approach. A performance decay of 70% at 1.65 V was observed in the initial 20 cycles for the Mo/Te alone resulting from the high activity but unstable active Mo species, while very stable catalytic ability was found on the Fe doped Mo/Te catalyst in terms of the initial activation process, dynamic and steady-state stability. The Fedoped Mo/Te catalyst required an overpotential of ca. 300 mV to reach the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm-2 when drop-casting on the glass carbon electrode. A Tafel slope of 45.6 mV dec-1 and the Faraday efficiency close to 100% were demonstrated on this electrode. As revealed by the spectroscopic analysis and the electrochemical kinetics measurement, the improved activity and stability could be attributed to the Fe-doped Mo/Te structure that has increased electrochemical surface area, the high valence state of Mo species formation, faster catalytic kinetics, rapid charge transfer ability as well as the strong electronic state modification. The current study reveals an effective approach to stabilizing the active Mo-based catalysts for OER via the synergistic effect of Fe and Mo.									21	0	0	0	6	0	21			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000683024400001

The study of the complexes by FTIR, XRD, EDS, XPS, MS, as well as H-1, C-13 and P-31 NMR shows that they preserve the nuclearity of the iridium cluster used as precursor (Ir-4(CO)(12)), while several of the carbonyl groups were substituted by the corresponding phosphine-type ligands and solvent (o-dichlorobenzene) molecules. The electrochemical characterization by rotating disk electrode measurements in an acid medium (0.5 mol L-1 H2SO4), from which the kinetic parameters could be obtained, indicates that both clusters exhibit an important catalytic activity for the oxygen electroreduction, even in the presence of methanol in concentrations as high as 2.0 mol L-1. According to these results, the new electrocatalysts are good potential candidates to be evaluated as cathodes in PEMFCs and DMFCs.& nbsp;(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts will be easily deactivated for severe seawater Cl- permeation and corrosion. Herein, a structural buffer engineering strategy is reported to endow the Co-2(OH)(3)Cl with long-term operation stability and a high OER selectivity of approximate to 99.6% in seawater splitting. The lattice Cl- of Co-2(OH)(3)Cl can act as the structural buffer, whose continuous leaching during OER can leave vacancies for seawater Cl- invasion, so as to avoid catalyst deactivation. Accordingly, Co-2(OH)(3)Cl can maintain 99.9% of its initial current density after 60 000 s operation, while that of Co(OH)(2) decays by 52.7% in 7 000 s. Meanwhile, the lattice Cl- of Co-2(OH)(3)Cl can optimize the binding energy of reaction intermediates on the neighboring O-Co-O site. Thus, Co-2(OH)(3)Cl exhibits a current density of 330.5 mA cm(-2) at the potential of 1.63 V versus RHE, 45.9 times higher than that of Co(OH)(2). The structural buffer strategy may be applied to incorporate other metal oxides with suitable anions, and effectively boost their OER activity and stability in alkaline seawater.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000769482600001

In our recent study, quadruple perovskite oxides (e.g., CaCu3Fe4O12 and LaMn7O12) displayed catalytic activity that was higher than that of simple perovskites (e.g., LaMnO3), but the reason has not yet been unveiled. We have conducted first-principles calculations of the several surface energies of LaMn7O12 and adsorption energies of OER intermediates on LaMn7O12 using slab models to clarify the reaction mechanism. The Mn-rich surfaces, i.e., the (001) with BO2 termination and (220) surfaces, are found to be more stable for LaMn7O12. It is found that all intermediates are preferentially adsorbed on the A ' B-bridge site on the LaMn7O12 (220) surface, although only the B-top site was a stable adsorption site on the (001) surface of LaMn7O12 and LaMnO3. The difference between theoretical overpotentials on the (220) surface of LaMn7O12 and the (001) surface with BO2 termination of LaMnO3 is in good agreement with the experimental overpotential for OER. We propose a new design principle in which OER is enhanced via adsorption on the A ' B-bridge site consisting of two adjacent Mn sites {coordination-unsaturated pyramid [coordination number (CN) = 5] and coordination-saturated pseudosquare (CN = 4)}, where the adsorbates are strongly bound to the former and weakly bound to the latter.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000419263500021

The oxygen content decreased significantly after torrefaction, leading to the increase of high heating value. Two-dimensional perturbation correlation analysis based on diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was performed to characterize the structural evolutions. It was found the dehydration of hydroxyls and the dissociation of branches were the main reactions at low torrefaction temperature. When the temperature further increased, the depolymerization of hemicellulose and the fragmentation of monosaccharide residues occurred. The distributed activation energy model with double Gaussian functions based on reaction-order model was used to investigate the pyrolysis kinetics. The results showed that torrefaction enhanced the activation energy for degradation reactions while lowered that for condensation reactions, and increased the devolatilization contribution of condensation reactions. Besides, torrefaction decreased the yields of typical pyrolytic products, such as acids, furans, alicyclic ketones and so on. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, DMMP surface chemistry is studied on an iron oxide surface in a very well-defined environment using temperature-programmed reaction, isotopic labeling, scanning tunneling microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory. DMMP, (CH3O)(2)P(O)(CH3), dissociates to yield methoxy and methyl methylphosphonate, (CH3O)-P(O)(2)(CH3), on the surface at room temperature. At higher temperatures, dimethyl ether is formed via intramolecular reaction, followed by the formation of formaldehyde and methanol from adsorbed methoxy decomposition during temperature-programmed reaction. Ultimately, stochiometric combustion at 870 K produces CO, H2C=O, and CO2 via reaction with lattice oxygen, with POx remaining on the surface. Excess oxygen from the bulk is required to drive these higher temperature pathways. Neither hydrolysis nor a photoreaction is observed, when exposing the adsorbed DMMP to water or light above the band gap, respectively. No evolution of P-containing species is detected, indicating efficient trapping of this contaminant. The activity for DMMP decomposition at room temperature is reduced by the accumulation of POx. However, a significant amount of reaction persists after multiple temperature-programmed reaction experiments.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000541745800028

Herein, we report the rational design of a core/shell nanostructured photoanode with a TiO2 nanorod (NR) array as the core and a highly active Earth-abundant NiFe oxyhydroxide ((Ni1-xFex) OOH, NiFeOOH) oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) as the shell for PEC water oxidation. Specifically, the NiFeOOH nanosheets were prepared via a facile, one-step electroless deposition method for a short reaction time of 10 min at room temperature. The TiO2/NiFeOOH core/shell nanostructured photoanode exhibits an unprecedented enhancement in photocurrent density (3.85 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode, (RHE)), no decay in photocurrent density over 24 h, and an obvious cathodic onset potential shift of 133 mV compared to the TiO2 NRs (0.73 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE). The electron transfer mechanism is discussed through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies and calculated band alignments via ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy characterization. This work not only suggests a simple, room temperature el(e)ctroless strategy for integrating Earth-abundant catalysts with photoanodes, but also accelerates the development of rationally designed core/shell photoanodes for efficient and durable solar water oxidation.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000451600200009

Developing low-cost and high-performance OER catalysts is significant for scale-up application of this technique. In this work, we report a facile electrochemical approach to synthesize thin iridium hydroxide nanosheets (denoted as HxIrO(3) NSs), which possess a unique honeycomb structure on the surface, as inherited from the parent alpha-Li2IrO3 material. The obtained HxIrO(3) NSs show an average thickness of approximately 1.6 nm as measured using an atomic force microscope. Owing to the abundant exposed Ir active sites, the nanosheet catalyst demonstrates excellent OER activity with a low overpotential of 277 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) and maintaines a current density of 12.6 mA cm(-2) (at a potential of 1.55 V vs RHE) for over 12 h in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. In addition, fast proton dynamics is observed on catalyst-electrolyte interfaces, which is further correlated with the stable OER performance of HxIrO(3) NSs. Overall, results of this work provide valuable information on the design and development of low content iridium catalysts for achieving high mass activity and stability for water oxidation in acid.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000818933900001

This water-splitting reaction is carried out by a manganese cluster/tyrosine radical ensemble, the oxygen-evolving complex. Although conventional continuous-wave, perpendicular-polarization electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy has significantly advanced our knowledge of the structure and function of the oxygen-evolving complex, significant additional information can be obtained with the application of additional EPR methodologies. Specifically, parallel-polarization EPR spectroscopy can be used to obtain highly resolved EPR spectra of integer spin Mn species, and pulsed EPR spectroscopy with electron spin echo-based sequences, such as electron spin echo envelope modulation and electron spin echo-electron nuclear double resonance, can be used to measure weak interactions obscured in continuous-wave spectroscopy by inhomogeneous broadening.									99	2	0	0	47	0	102			1056-8700			WOS:000088492300016	10940256

The obtained Mo-doped CuWO4 NF array films retained the network structure of crosslinked CuWO4 NEs when the Mo-to-W atomic ratio in precursor solution is lower than 2 : 3. Mo doping not only narrowed the bandgap of CuWO4 but also significantly improved its electron density, both benefiting the photoelectrochemial (PEC) performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The Mo-doped CuWO4 NF array films exhibited a high catalytic activity toward PEC OER, and the activity varied as a function of the Mo doping concentration. The highest activity was obtained on 32 at.% Mo-doped samples, with photocurrent densities of 0.62 mA cm(-2) and 1.23 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V and 1.60 V vs RHE, respectively, which are the highest values among those reported in literature. Moreover, even at high OER overpotentials, the Mo-doped CuWO4 NF array films showed an excellent stability in weak alkaline solution. This work indicates that cation doping is an effective strategy to prepare highly efficient CuWO4-based photoanodes for PEC OER. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

To improve the activity and stability of these catalysts, a deeper understanding about the active site, the underlying reaction mechanism, and possible side reactions is necessary. We chose smooth epitaxial (100)-oriented La0.6Sr0.4.MnO3 (LSMO) films grown on Nb:SrTiO3 (STNO) as a model electrode to investigate OER activity and stability using the rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) method. Careful electrochemical characterization of various films in the thickness range between 10 and 200 nm yields an OER activity of the epitaxial LSMO surface of 100 mu A/cm(ox)(2) at 1.65 V vs RHE, which is among the highest reported for LSMO and close to (110)-oriented IrO2. Detailed post-mortem analysis using XPS, XRD, and AFM revealed the high structural and morphological stability of LSMO after OER. The observed correlation between activity and Mn vacancies on the surface suggested Mn as the active site for the OER in (100)-oriented LSMO, in contrast to similar perovskite manganites, such as Pr1-xCaxMnO3. The observed Tafel slope of about 60 mV/dec matches the theoretical prediction for a chemical rate limiting step that follows an electrochemical pre-equilibrium, probably O-O bond formation. Our study established LSMO as an atomically flat oxide with high intrinsic activity and high stability.									69	1	0	0	4	0	69			1932-7447			WOS:000390072100003

Herein, we managed the synthesis of atomically dispersed binary NixFe100-x-NC (x = 0-100) materials with tunable Ni/Fe ratios and investigated their underneath synergy effects for the enhancement of oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER). EXAFS revealed the abundant presence of Ni(N-3)-Fe(N-3)-C-n moieties in Ni66Fe34-NC sample. XPS fine scans indicated deep synergy of dual-site Ni/Fe that favored more charge localized over Ni/Fe sites. Electrochemical measurments showed that the Ni66Fe34-NC delivered a very high ORR half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.85 V and a low OER overpotential of 467 mV at similar to 10 mA cm(-2) (Ej =10). The Fe site with Ni neighboring, as suggested by DFT simulations and in-situ Raman, was the responsible site for both ORR and OER. Furthermore, the Ni66Fe34-NC-assembled Zn-air battery afforded large specific power density and extraordinary cycling stability.									72	3	0	0	5	0	72			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000541147500012

Herein, a nitrogenous organic modified bimetal layered hydroxide salts (LHS) precursor is used to prepare CoNi alloy and CoO coupled nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) hybrids on carbon paper (CP) via a one-step pyrolysis at only 500 degrees C. Through adjusting the metal molar ratio in LHS precursor and the pyrolysis temperature, CoO is in situ produced during pyrolysis. Since both alloy and metal oxide possess potential oxygen evolution reaction activity, the resulting CoNi-CoO@NC/CP exhibits enriched electrochemical active surface area, small overpotential (309 mV) at current density of 10 mA cm(-2), low Tafel slope (67.7 mV dec(-1)), and good durability for 64 h at similar to 20 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. Furthermore, a zinc-air battery based on this catalyst shows a high specific power of 96.2 W g(cat)(-1), which exceeds that of conventional RuO2+Pt/C catalyst (66.8 W g(cat)(-1)). This work provides an appealing approach for the development of highly efficient alloy/metal oxide electrocatalysts for rechargeable metal-air battery. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The materials so obtained, are characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron micrographs and IR data. Preliminary study shows the formation of spinel phase of the material along with some impurity. Cyclic voltammetry and anodic polarization of each oxide have been carried out in the form of electrode on Ni-substrate. The CV curve of each oxide electrode exhibits redox peaks (E-Pa = 480+/-12 mV and E-Pc = 362 +/- 6) prior to the oxygen evolution reaction. The anodic polarization curve of each oxide electrode has been recorded in 1 M KOH at 25 degrees C for the determination of electrocatalytic activity. Among the prepared oxides, the activity is highest with 1.0 mol Co-substitution in Fe3O4 matrix. The most active oxide electrode shows overpotential 503 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) current density. Tafel slope values range from 47-59 mV decade(-1). The activation energy has also been estimated by recording the anodic polarization curve at different temperatures.									6	0	0	0	0	0	7			0376-4710	0975-0975		WOS:000363357600007

However, several challenges need to be addressed before scaling-up MES systems. In this review, recent advances in electrode materials, microbe-catalyzed CO2 reduction and MES energy consumption are discussed in detail. Anode materials are briefly reviewed first, with several strategies proposed to reduce the energy input for electron generation and enhance MES bioeconomy. This was followed by discussions on MES cathode materials and configurations for enhanced chemolithoautotroph growth and CO2 reduction. Various chemolithoautotrophs, effective for CO2 reduction and diverse bioproduct formation, on MES cathode were also discussed. Finally, research efforts on developing cost-effective process for bioproduct extraction from MES are presented. Future perspectives to improve product formation and reduce energy cost are discussed to realize the application of the MES as a chemical production platform in the context of building a circular economy.									100	2	0	0	45	0	102			0960-8524	1873-2976		WOS:000513868000049	32019708

The catalytically active sites of MoS2 are along the edges, whereas thermodynamically MoS2 favors the presence of a two-dimensional (2-D) basal plane and the catalytically active atoms only constitute a small portion of the material. The lack of catalytically active sites and low catalytic efficiency impede its massive application. To address the issue, we have activated the basal plane of monolayer 2H MoS2 through an ultrathin alumina mask (UTAM)-assisted nanopore arrays patterning, creating a high edge density. The introduced catalytically active sites are identified by Cu electrochemical deposition, and the hydrogen generation properties are assessed in detail. We demonstrate a remarkably improved HER performance as well as the identical catalysis of the artificial edges and the pristine metallic edges of monolayer MoS2. Such a porous monolayer nanostructure can achieve a much higher edge atom ratio than the pristine monolayer MoS2 flakes, which can lead to a much improved catalytic efficiency. This controllable edge engineering can also be extended to the basal plane modifications of other 2-D materials, for improving their edge-related properties.									40	2	0	0	1	0	41			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000427204100054	29405056

We report a simple method for the fabrication of a low Pt loading electrode, using an electrochemical method named self-terminated electrodeposition, at room temperature and under ambient pressure. Controlling the deposition conditions enables the quenching deposition of Pt on a C-coated gas diffusion layer by H passivation at a highly negative potential. Repeating deposition pulses facilitate the facile control of the Pt surface composition and electrochemical surface area, which significantly affects their catalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction. The results presented show that the aforementioned Pt electrode can be a promising cathode for use in membrane-based water electrolyzers.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0256-1115	1975-7220		WOS:000557498200006

Herein the development of nitrogen-doped carbon supported fewer-layer MoSe2 (FL-MoSe2/NC) through calcining the hydrothermal product of the Se and Mo precursors in the presence of ammonium citrate is reported. This FL-MoSe2/NC is highly efficient for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and exhibits a remarkably low onset potential of 15.2 mV, an extremely small overpotential of 74.6 mV (vs. RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2), a greatly reduced Tafel slope of 45.2 mV dec(-1), and a higher exchange current density of 0.266 mA cm(-2). The performance of the FL-MoSe2/NC is much higher than that of most Mo-based HER electrocatalysts reported to date and even comparable to that of other most active non-precious metal based catalysts, suggesting the great potential of using the FL-MoSe2/NC as an efficient catalyst for the HER. The NC is believed to play an important role in the high performance of the FL-MoSe2/NC. It does not only promote a strong interaction between MoSe2 and the NC, but facilitates the formation of MoSe2 with few layers and shorter lattice fringe lengths, which expose more active sites accessible to the HER.

Herein, we synthesize the Cu single atom embedded on nitrogen-doped graphene-like matrix electrocatalyst (abbreviated as SA-Cu/NG). The results show that SA-Cu/NG possesses a higher ORR capability than 20% Pt/C at alkaline solution while the inferior activity to 20% Pt/C at acidic medium. Based on the experiment and simulation calculation, we identify the atomic structure of Cu-N2C2 in SA-Cu/NG and for the first time unravels that the oxygen-reconstituted Cu-N2C2-O structure is really the active species of alkaline ORR, while the oxygen reconstitution does not happen at acidic medium. The finding of oxygen-reconstituted active species of SA-Cu/NG at alkaline media successfully unveils the bottleneck puzzle of why the performance of ORR catalysts at alkaline solution is better than that at acidic media, which provides new physical insight into the development of new ORR catalysts.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13				2639-5274		WOS:000574831200001	33094289

Carbon support structures increase the surface area, stability and activity of electrocatalysts in most cases, and can be used to overcome the delamination of thin films. In an attempt to (i) obtain surface structures and areas on SiO2 wafer pads, for combinatorial high-throughput sputtering and screening, that are comparable to glassy carbon (GC), (ii) eliminate delamination of the electrocatalyst and (iii) increase activity and stability, this study focused on VC:Nafion support preparation techniques. Four VC inks were prepared and used as carbon support on GC electrode inserts to analyse their effect on the activity of sputtered Ni thin films (40 nm) towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chronopotentiometry (CP) were employed to compare the catalytic activity and stability of these sputtered Ni thin films on the various VC supports. Results suggest that similar activity compared with IrO2 and RuO2 could be achieved by sputtered Ni on VC:Nafion support, indicating improved Ni utilisation as well as improved short-term stability of the Ni thin films. These results validate the use of VC:Nafion support as substrate for sputtered electrocatalysts.Graphical .									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000492662400002

We have updated the nuclear reaction network by including both new and improved experimental and theoretical determinations of the nuclear reaction rates. We have also incorporated the carbon-rich OPAL opacity tables. Our results show that the changes in the reaction rates and opacities that we have introduced produce important changes with respect to our previous studies. For example, a smaller amount of Al-26 is produced, while the abundances of P-31 and S-32 increase by factors of more than 2. This change is attributed to the increased proton-capture reaction rates for some of the intermediate-mass nuclei near Al-26 and beyond, such that nuclear fusion to higher mass nuclei is enhanced. We also find that our predicted values for the amount of mass ejected in the outburst are at least a factor of 10 less than observed. The low values for the amount of ejected mass is a consequence of the fact that the OPAL opacities are larger than those we previously used, which results in more heat being trapped in the nuclear-burning regions and, therefore, less mass being accreted onto the white dwarf.					2nd International Workshop on Laboratory Astrophysics with Intense Lasers2nd International Workshop on Laboratory Astrophysics with Intense Lasers	MAR 19-21, 1998MAR 19-21, 1998		TUCSON, ARIZONATUCSON, ARIZONA	63	1	0	0	0	0	63			0067-0049			WOS:000088346900045

Herein, bimetallic cobalt/iron nitrides in situ embedded into nitrogen, sulfur-codoped carbon nanotubes (CoN/FeN@N,S-C-800) was firstly developed by pyrolysis of a Fe-glucosamine coated tetrazole energetic metal - organic framework. Due to the significant nitrogen (5.38at%) dopant content, the synergistic effect between bimetallic nitrides, and interconnected N, S-codoped carbon nanotubes, the as-prepared CoN/FeN@N,S-C-800 exhibits an ultra-high half-wave potential (0.865 V) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and a low overpotential (385 mV) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

Impressively, an all-solid-state ZAB catalyzed by CoN/FeN@N,S-C-800 affords a high OCV of 1.354 V, and three all-solid-state ZABs in series can successfully light LED (similar to 2.2 V), displaying tremendous potentials in portable devices.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000724687900006

However, designing highly active catalysts with high electronic conductivities to kinetically accelerate the sluggish oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER) is still a big challenge. This work was dedicated to developing two-dimensional (2D) trigonal phase MoS2 (1T-MoS2) nanosheets as a highly active electrocatalyst for LOBs for the first time. Metallic 1T-MoS2 prepared via in situ liquid-redox intercalation and exfoliation was hybridized with functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to form freestanding, binder-free oxygen electrodes. The 1T-MoS2/CNT electrode exhibited excellent electrochemical performances with a high reversible capacity of 500 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 200 mA g(-1) for more than 100 cycles owing to the catalytically active surfaces of 1T-MoS2 accessible by Li+ ions and O-2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations identified the catalytically active basal planes in 1T-MoS2 during the ORR as well as the initial ORR path during LOB cycles. The results based on the rotational ring disk electrode (RRDE) experiments also supported the findings from the DFT calculations, where the 1T-MoS2 basal planes are active for both the ORR and OER, not the semiconducting hexagonal MoS2 (2H-MoS2) whose edges are only electrocatalytically active.

Electrolysis of water is one of the basic methods for the production of hydrogen energy. However, the high overpotential of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolysis has hindered the effective production of hydrogen using this method. Thus, the development of high-efficiency non-precious metal-based electrocatalysts for OER is extremely significant. In this study, we adopted a one-step hydrothermal method to fabricate Ni-based catalysts with N/S-dual doped graphene oxide/carbon nanotube (GO/CNT) supports using thiourea (CH4N2S) and urea as the S source and the N source. It was observed that the amount of thiourea utilized in the synthesis of the catalyst affected the morphology, composition, and the electrochemical properties of the catalyst. For a GO/CNT-to-thiourea mass ratio of 1:10, the catalyst exhibited the highest activity, where the OER overpotential was 320 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). This was attributed to the high specific surface area, high conductivity, and fast electron transport channels of the N/S-dual doped GO/CNT composite. Furthermore, sulfurization of the Ni particles to form nickel sulfide played a significant role in enhancing the catalytic performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1976-4251	2233-4998		WOS:000864954000002

Owing to their abundant misaligned atoms and sub-nanometer sizes, metal oxide/oxyhydroxide clusters supported by good electric conductors are supposed to have superior electrocatalytic activity toward the OER. Herein, highly efficient oxygen evolution catalysis is achieved using NiFe oxyhydroxide clusters anchored on carbon black (NiFe-oxyhydroxide/C). To reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the NiFe-oxyhydroxide/C sample with a Ni/Fe molar ratio of 1 : 1 (Ni0.5Fe0.5/C) only needs an overpotential of 269.6 mV, which is much smaller than those of amorphous NiFe-oxyhydroxide particles (347.9 mV) and commercial RuO2 (423.3 mV). In particular, the mass activity of Ni0.5Fe0.5/C can reach 593.1 A g(-1) at a very low overpotential of 320 mV. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that the existence of Ni-O-Fe structures in NiFe-oxyhydroxide/C accounts for its excellent OER activity. Our findings not only provide a novel avenue for the preparation of excellent OER electrocatalysts but they also deepen our understanding of the catalytic mechanisms of NiFe-based OER electrocatalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000792326600001

In the present work, P and Cu dual-doped cobalt selenide nanoarrays with hierarchical structure were fabricated via a facile hydrothermal method, involving in-situ growth on a selfsupported conductive Ni foam substrate (P,Cu-Co0.85Se/NF). The overall water splitting (OWS) performance of the catalysts was systematically studied in alkaline solution. Compared to single-ion-doped or pure Co0.85Se, dual incorporation of the anion and cation can contort the lattice and induce powerful electronic interactions, thereby exposing abundant catalytic sites and optimizing the adsorption energy of the reaction intermediates. Benefiting from the merits of P, the Cu-co-doped Co0.85Se/NF electrode exhibited outstanding catalytic activity towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), generating a 10 mA cm-2 current density at the overpotential of 96.8 mV in 1 M KOH, and the overpotential is 300 mV towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the current density of 100 mA cm-2. Furthermore, when applied it to fabricate OWS cell, the cell voltage is as low as 1.57 V at the current density of 10 mA cm-2.

The results show that Al can markedly change the composition, morphology and reaction path of spinel phase within Al_2O_3-MgO refractories. Without Al addition, MgO reacts with Al_2O_3 to form spinel, and then spinel reacts with Al_2O_3 encompassed by itself to form once-rich-Al_2O_3 spinel. When the oxygen partial pressure by C-O2 consumed oxygen reaction decreases, MgO becomes unstable and decomposes into Mg(g) and O2; Mg(g) diffuses and transfers along pores or gaps in the materials, reacting with rich-Al_2O_3 spinel to generate new rich-Al_2O_3 spinel and Al(g), Al(g) is nitrided as AlN and then AlN dissolves into rich-Al_2O_3 spinel to form MgAlON. Al(g) and Al2O(g) diffuse and transfer along pores or gaps in the materials after introduction of Al into Al_2O_3-MgO refractory. Al(g) and Al2O(g) change into AlN and further dissolve into rich-Al_2O_3 spinel, enhancing N content of MgAlON. Also, in the gas-gas reaction system, Al(g)/Al2O(g), Mg(g), N2 and O2 react with each other to form flake MgAlON.			探究了在1 600 ℃氮气气氛下金属Al对Al_2O_3-MgO耐火材料中尖晶石物相演变的影响。结果表明,金属Al显著改变了尖晶石物相的组成、形貌和反应路径。未添加金属Al时,氧化镁与氧化铝反应生成镁铝尖晶石;镁铝尖晶石与其包裹的氧化铝颗粒发生固溶体反应形成一次富氧化铝的镁铝尖晶石。C-O2反应使体系氧分压持续降低,氧化镁分解产生的Mg(g)与周围的氧化铝和一次富氧化铝的镁铝尖晶石发生置换反应,形成二次富氧化铝的镁铝尖晶石和金属Al(l/g)。在高温氮气下,金属Al(l/g)氮化形成氮化铝后,与上述一次或二次富氧化铝的镁铝尖晶石反应形成镁阿隆尖晶石(MgAlON)尖晶石。将金属铝引入到Al_2O_3-MgO耐火材料后,含铝气相物质Al(g)和Al2O(g),沿耐火材料中的气孔或孔隙扩散传质。一方面,Al(g)和Al2O(g)氮化反应形成氮化铝,固溶强化并提升MgAlON尖晶石中氮元素的含量;另一方面,Al(g)、Al2O(g)、Mg(g)、N2和O2发生气-气化学反应,形成片状形貌的MgAlON尖晶石。						0	1	0	0	0	0	1			0454-5648			CSCD:6862142

Using anodization, electroplating, and sequential electrodeposition, we herein realized a universal approach to vertically assemble 2D Fe-Ni hydroxide nanosheets on nickel foam surface as catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The electrode exhibited OER onset overpotentials (eta) of similar to 190 mV and a low eta of similar to 270 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm-2 in KOH electrolyte, making it one of the most active OER catalysts reported so far. The FeNi films deposited via sequential deposition are highly ordered, and electrode is stable even under long term or large current density operation. Based on the results of theoretical calculation, dielectric force microscopy (DFM) analysis, and capacitance measurements, we found that 2D Fe-Ni hydroxide-loaded electrode with enhanced conductivity facilitates the sufficiently conversion of active sites and ensures optimal adsorption energies for intermediates of OER, as a result of structural effects as well as introduction of optimal amount of Fe on surface.									42	4	0	0	3	0	43			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000419832100042

In this study, a hybrid catalyst with specific surface area and manganese valence controlled alpha-MnO2 nanotube decorated by silver nanoparticles (Ag/MnO2-3) is successful synthesized. A facile hydrothermal method was used, followed by liquid phase reducing treatment. The Ag/MnO2-3 showed not only superior catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction with more positive onset potential (0.996 V vs. RHE) and comparable half-wave potential (0.870 V vs. RHE) to the commercial Pt/C catalyst but also a higher discharge voltage plateau (similar to 1.1 V at discharge current density of 50 mA cm(-2)) with superior stability in the primary Al-air battery test. The high electrocatalytic activity of the Ag/MnO2-3 nanohybrid is attributed to the larger specific surface area of MnO2 nanotubes and its ultrahigh atomic ratios of Mn3+/Mn4+ on the surface. This results in a strong synergistic effect between manganese dioxide nanotube and Ag nanoparticles to inhibit the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide. This material is promising for applications in Al-air batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									24	2	0	0	3	0	25			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000462774000039

Thus far, Pt has been regarded as a highly reactive catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER); however, the high cost and rarity of Pt significantly hinder its commercial use. Herein, we successfully developed an HER catalyst composed of NiSx (x = 1 or 2) on stainless steel (NiSx/SUS) using electrodeposition and sulfurization techniques. Notably, the electrochemical active surface area(ECSA) of NiSx/SUS was improved more than two orders of magnitude, resulting in a considerable improvement in the electrochemical charge transfer and HER activity in comparison with stainless steel (SUS). The long-term HER examination by linear scan voltammetry (LSV) confirmed that NiSx/SUS was stable up to 2000 cycles.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5				2073-4344		WOS:000592765100001

However, their poor charge separation and transfer properties, together with slow water-oxidation kinetics, have resulted in low PEC activity and instability, which strongly impede their further development. In this work, these limitations are addressed by optimizing the charge separation and transfer process. To this end, a nickel-iron based metal-organic framework, Ni/Fe-MIL-53, is deposited, that acts as an oxygen evolution pre-catalyst within the CN layer and incorporate reduced graphene oxide as an electron acceptor. Upon electrochemical activation, a uniform distribution of highly active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts is obtained on the porous CN surface. Detailed mechanistic studies reveal excellent hole extraction properties with high OER catalytic activity (83% faradaic efficiency) and long-term stability, up to 35 h. These results indicate that the decrease in performance is mainly due to the slow leaching of the catalyst from the CN layer. The CN photoanode exhibits a reproducible photocurrent density of 472 +/- 20 mu A cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 0.1 m KOH, an exceptionally low onset potential of approximate to 0.034 V versus RHE, and high external quantum yield.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000638662900001

The electrochemical kinetic analyses of these processes are based on quasi-steady-state polarisation and impedance data. The good agreement between the two sets of measurements allows some basic conclusions to be drawn. In particular, the O-2 evolution process is always inhibited at F-doped PbO2 electrodes, and impedance results suggest possible changes in the mechanism, with electrodesorption of intermediates becoming more important as the concentration of the doping element increases. The interpretation of the data for the less positive potentials region invokes the specific adsorption of SO2-4 as a factor influencing the kinetics of O-2 evolution. The current efficiency for O-3 formation as a function of the amount of NaF added to the PbO2 growth solution reaches a maximum for a concentration of 0.01 mol dm(-3). A plausible cause for the decrease on the higher concentration side is the discharge of adsorbed SO2-4 (or HSO-4 eventually yielding persulphate. This reaction is known to be favoured in the presence of a relatively high amount of fluoride in the electrolyte. An analysis of the results of modified neglect of diatomic differential overlap (MNDO) calculations on Pb cluster models and of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data suggests that the coverage by weakly adsorbed oxygen species (OH and H2O) is an important parameter that is influenced by F-doping.

It appears to be an unavoidable alternative to significantly reduce the dependence on conventional energy sources based on fossil fuels without increasing the atmospheric CO2 levels. Among the different power-to-X scenarios to access high purity H-2, the electrochemical approach based on electrolysis looks to be a promising sustainable solution at both the small and large industrial scales. However, the practical realization of this important opportunity faces several challenges, including the efficient design of cost-effective catalytic materials to be used as a cathode with improved intrinsic and durable activity. In this contribution, we report the design and development of efficient nanostructured catalysts for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in aqueous media, whereby noble metal-free elements are embedded in a matrix of a conducting polymer, polyaniline (PANI). To increase the electrical conductivity and further the electrocatalytic ability toward HER of the chemically polymerized PANI in the presence of nickel (II) salt (nitrate), the PANI-based materials have first been stabilized at a mild temperature of 250-350 degrees C in air and then carbonized at 800-1,000 degrees C under nitrogen gas to convert the chemical species into nitrogen, sulfur, nickel, and carbon nanostructured networks (CNNs). Different physicochemical (TGA-DSC, Raman spectroscopy, XRD, SEM, EDX, ICP, CHNS, BET, and XPS) and electrochemical (voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectrometry) methods have been integrated to characterize the as-synthesized CNNs materials and interrogate the relationship of material-to-performance. It has been found that those synthesis conditions allow for the substantial increase of the electrocatalytic performance toward HER and OER in alkaline media in terms of the onset potential and charge transfer resistance and overpotential at the specific activity of 10 milliamps per square centimeter, thus ranking the present materials among the most efficient noble metal-free catalysts and making them possible candidates for integration in practical low-energy consumption alkaline electrolyzers.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2296-2646			WOS:000539213600001	32509726

Mercury underpotential deposition (Hg-UPD) on Ir and IrOx in perchloric acid has been reported to be useful for ECSA evaluation. However, previous methods need to be carefully evaluated for reproducibility due to the presence of Hg(II)/Hg(I) redox reactions, and differences in UPD potentials between studies. Here, the electrochemical behavior of an Ir electrode in a mercury nitrate containing solution was investigated using the electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance method. We confirmed that a Hg adatom is reversibly adsorbed and desorbed on an Ir surface at potentials over 0.7 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode in both perchloric acid and sulfuric acid. These results contribute to the establishment of a reproducible method for ECSA calculations for Ir-based catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1040-0397	1521-4109		WOS:000772892600001

Since cation substitution allows to finely tailor the atomic arrangement, structural distortion, and electrocatalytic performance of transition metal oxides, a relationship between local structural order and electrocatalytic activity in crystalline manganese oxide can be systematically investigated by in situ X-ray absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic analyses for unsubstituted and Fe-substituted -Mn1-xFexO2 during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The substitution of Mn with Fe is quite effective in improving the OER activity of -MnO2 to reach a small overpotential of 0.40 V at 10 mA cm(-2). Under OER conditions, the Fe substitution improves the local structural order of MnO6 octahedra in the -MnO2 lattice, thus leading to a significant enhancement of charge transport kinetics. Since the Fe substitution induces only a limited alteration of the electronic structure and the substituted Fe ion itself shows only a negligible contribution to the OER activity, the excellent OER functionality of Fe-substituted -Mn1-xFexO2 is attributable mainly to the improvement of local structural ordering upon Fe substitution. The present study underscores the crucial role of local structural order in optimizing the electrocatalytic functionality of crystalline transition metal oxides.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000437469300040

The valence state of Pd that was loaded onto the Pd/Fe3C@NCNTs surface is in the Pd-0 and Pd2+ forms and Pd-0 is the main form. The electrochemical measurement results imply that the Fe3C@NCNT catalyst exhibits an electrocatalytic property in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The Pd/Fe3C@NCNT electrocatalyst has a good catalytic property toward ORR and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) in an alkaline solution. The half-wave potential (E-1/2) on the Pd/Fe3C@NCNT electrocatalyst toward the ORR can reach 0.904 V, which is higher than that on commercial 20 wt% Pt/C (0.856 V). The forward oxidation peak current density (j(f)) on the Pd/Fe3C@NCNT electrocatalyst for ethanol oxidation is 1.655 A mg(-1), which is larger than that on commercial 10 wt% Pd/C (0.430 A mg(-1)). The excellent electrocatalytic property of the Pd/Fe3C@NCNT electrocatalyst is contributed to the many active sites and synergistic effects between Pd and Fe3C@NCNTs. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation result implies that the electron mobility increases in the recombination area for Pd and Fe3C@NCNTs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000802885700005

No.99TH8371)								341	8		10.1109/BCAA.1999.796016				1999	1999	The effect of high surface area, filamentary Inco nickel powders Type 210 and 210H, and of standard battery grade Ni powder Type 255, on the internal pressure of Ni/metal hydride (MH) cells was studied in starved cells. When used as additive to the Teflon bonded AB5 metal hydride electrode in a range of 2.5 to 5 wt%, the high surface area powders were found highly effective in accelerating oxygen recombination and suppressing hydrogen evolution and accumulating during overcharge. This led to significantly lower internal pressure in Ni/MeH cells during cycling. The pressure reduction, as well as the MH electrode capacity improvement, was found directly proportional to the specific surface area of the added nickel powder rather than to their ability to improve conductivity. The benefit of the nickel addition is believed to relate to their catalysis to the electrode reactions InNi/MH cell.					Fourteenth Annual Battery Conference on Applications and Advances.

An alternative mechanism for amino acidsynthesis called the ammonia-involved formose-like reaction usesaldehydes and ammonia, and it has been demonstrated to explainthe amino acid distributions in carbonaceous meteorites. In thisstudy, experiments were performed to synthesize amino acids from13C-labeled aldehydes and ammonia and to investigate the detailedformation pathways of the formose-like reaction. The effects of theinitial aldehyde compositions and free oxygen on the reaction werealso examined. The production of amino acids, including glycine,significantly increased in the air compared to in a nitrogenatmosphere, which indicates that oxygen in the air promotes aminoacid synthesis. A precursor compound of glycine was identified asN-oxalylglycine, and it can be synthesized from ammonia andglyoxylic acid produced by the oxidation of glycolaldehyde. This formation mechanism indicates that the oxidation of aldehydes iscrucial for amino acid synthesis by the formose-like reaction. Based on the formation pathway of glycine viaN-oxalylglycine,alpha-,beta-,and gamma-oxo acids can be hypothesized to react with ammonia to produce the various structural isomers of amino acids found incarbonaceous chondrites, including alpha-,beta-, and gamma-hydroxy amino acids									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2472-3452			WOS:000806001000014

The first peak at the measured Ag Kedge of Ag-16@TiO2 is more prominent in air than in carbon monoxide environment, but no variation was found between the spectra of Ag-4@TiO2 in air and in carbon monoxide environments. Density functional theory calculations show a preference for molecular oxygen adsorption for Ag-4@TiO2 and that for a dissociative one on Ag-16@TiO2, while carbon monoxide reactions with adsorbed oxygen reduced the Ag-16@TiO2 cluster. The dissociated oxygen atoms increased the oxidation state of Ag-16 cluster and resulted in the prominent first peak in Ag K-edge spectrum in quasi-particle theory calculations, with the subsequent carbon monoxide oxidation reversing the character of Ag Kedge spectrum associated with the reduction of the cluster. The results provide insight into the size selectivity of supported subnanometer silver clusters in their interactions with oxygen and carbon monoxide, with implications on the cluster catalytic properties in oxidative reactions.									16	0	0	0	3	0	16			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000398247500023

Its implementation requires the development of stable and efficient photocathodes, NdFeO3 being a suitable candidate among ternary oxides. In this study, transparent NdFeO3 thin-film photocathodes have been successfully prepared by a citric acid-based sol-gel procedure, followed by thermal treatment in air at 640 degrees C. These electrodes show photocurrents for both the hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions. Doping with Mg2+ and Zn2+ has been observed to significantly enhance the photoelectrocatalytic performance of NdFeO3 toward oxygen reduction. Magnesium is slightly more efficient as a dopant than Zn, leading to a multiplication of the photocurrent by a factor of 4-5 for a doping level of 5 at % (with respect to iron atoms). This same trend is observed for hydrogen evolution. The beneficial effect of doping is primarily attributed to an increase in the density and a change in the nature of the majority charge carriers. DFT calculations help to rationalize the behavior of NdFeO3 by pointing to the importance of nanostructuring and doping. All in all, NdFeO3 has the potential to be used as a photocathode in photoelectrochemical applications, although efforts should be directed to limit surface recombination.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000636686200023	33728897

Herein, a wood-derived N-doped hierarchically porous monolithic carbon (N-HPMC) matrix embedded with Co nanoparticles (Co@N-HPMC) is fabricated by direct two-step carbonization of natural wood (NW) loaded with Co/CoOx. The monolithic N-HPMC matrix has numerous aligned and open microchannels, abundant porosity, and high conductivity, which afford rapid electron transfer and mass transport, while the embedded Co nanoparticles (Co NPs) have high dispersion and a strong synergistic interaction with the N-HPMC matrix, which offer an abundance of highly active sites. As a result, the monolithic Co@N-HPMC electrode exhibits excellent electrocatalytic water splitting performance in 1.0 M KOH, and it requires overpotentials of 128 and 297 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. More notably, an alkaline electrolyzer for overall water splitting (OWS) assembled by employing Co@N-HPMC as both the cathode and anode achieves current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm(-2) at cell voltages of 1.77 and 2.16 V, respectively. This study provides an effective strategy to fabricate noble-metal-free high-performance monolithic electrocatalysts for commercial applications.									12	1	0	0	1	0	12			2398-4902			WOS:000487670300019

Oxygen evolution reaction, which is a bottleneck of the overall water splitting, faces the problems of complicated reconstruction and deficiency in rational design of active sites. Herein, we report a series of transition metal chalcogenides for alkaline OER. Among them, FeCoNi(S) displayed a low overpotential of 293 mV to deliver a current density of 500 mA cm(-2), which is in the top level of non-precious metal based OER electrocatalysts. A combination of (ex) in situ characterizations and DFT calculation shows that Ni(Fe,Co) trimetallic oxyhydroxides were the active sites for highly-efficient OER. Furthermore, for FeCoNi(S), when used as a bifunctional catalyst for water splitting, it only required a cell voltage of 1.84 V to deliver similar to 500 mA cm(-2) with extraordinary long-term stability over 2000 h. This work provides the comprehension of high-efficiency, robust catalysts for OER and overall water splitting at large current densities in alkaline media.

A defective catalyst was modeled by a tetragonal ZrO2 (101) slab introduced with oxygen vacancies and nitrogen dopants, and the structure of the ORR intermediates was exhaustively computed from first principles. As is typical of oxides, various adsorption structures with slightly different energies were obtained. Therefore, we obtained the free energy profile for the ORR and established that the energy barrier of the rate-determining step, or the removal of OH*, is comparable to (or only slightly lower than) that of the pristine surfaces, indicating that defects play only a minor role in enhancing the ORR activity. The measured enhancement in the ORR current could be ascribed to the enhanced carrier supply, which may be attributed to the formation of a gap state or change in the potential profile, or to other factors so far overlooked. The results of the first-principles study provide a significant insight for experimentalists to develop optimal cathode materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000853609000001

Various techniques involving XRD, FESEM, TEM/EDS, BET and XPS were used to characterize the microstructure, morphology and surface chemical composition belonging to as-synthesized Co2PNC-NF. The electrochemical measurements revealed that the active carbon cathode modified by Co2PNC-NF got reduced resistance and optimized catalytic behavior in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process. The optimized MFC had a high maximum power density reaching 2001 mW m(-2), increasing by 123% compared with the bare active carbon cathode MFC. This result showed that combination between transition-metals phosphide and heteroatom-doped carbon matrices was beneficial to the improvement of MFC performance. Moreover, density functional theory calculations indicated that the special structure of double Co site of 001 face of Co2P can accelerate the ORR by boosting the cracking of OOH* group. Therefore, the Co2PNC-NF could be applied as an economical and efficient electrocatalyst in MFC to replace noble metal catalyst.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000682406300013

Herein, NiFe-LDH is activated for HER and overall water splitting by depositing Ni(OH)2 nanoparticle to form NiFe-LDH/Ni(OH)2 composite electrocatalyst using two-step electrodeposition method. The electrocatalytic performance of NiFe-LDH/Ni(OH)2 in alkaline condition greatly improves as compared to that with single-phase NiFe-LDH or Ni(OH)2. At a higher overpotential of - 0.3 V, NiFe-LDH/Ni(OH)2 composite could reach a current density of 180 mA/cm2 which increases 3-fold as compared to a single-phase NiFe-LDH (60 mA/ cm2). More importantly, NiFe-LDH/Ni(OH)2 composite can act as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. The cell voltages at current densities of 10 and 100 mA/cm2 are 1.6 and 1.8 VRHE, respectively during the water splitting process. The great improvement of electrocatalytic activities after the formation of composite catalysts is due to the synergetic effect between NiFeLDH and Ni(OH)2 to efficiently accelerate the water dissociation step and electron transfer through Ni(OH)2 layer. This work provides simple and robust electrodeposition technique to prepare NiFe-LDH/Ni(OH)2 composite for activating HER and overall water splitting.									29	0	0	0	2	0	29			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000663788400005

Herein, unique hierarchical peanut-like Co and N codoped porous carbon (Co/N-PC) had been synthesized by using inexpensive melamine, formaldehyde and cobalt acetate as raw materials via a simple template-free hydrothermal reaction followed by heat treatment. The formation process of the peanut-like precursor was discussed in-depth, indicating that the morphological evolution with time followed a pathway of: solid microspheres -> wrinkled and ultrathin shells wrapped microspheres -> the peanut-like precursor formation. Furthermore, the unique structure combines the advantageous features of high surface area, sufficient active sites, easy access to medium and rapid mass transport. As a result, the peanut-like Co/N-PC showed high catalytic activity, superior methanol crossover resistance and excellent catalytic stability towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline medium. Notably, the peanut-like Co/N-PC possessed a comparable ORR half-wave potential to commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst. Therefore, it can be expected that the peanut-like Co/N-PC will be a promising alternative to commercial Pt/C catalyst for fuel cells. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, MXene/bacterial cellulose fiber (BCF) hybrid films with effectively expanded interlayer spacing between re-stacked few-layered MXene sheets via homogeneous intercalation of BCF nanospacer were designed and prepared. The electrochemical testing and molecular dynamics simulation demonstrated the consequently widened ions-transport-channels between few-layered MXene sheets can effectively reduce the diffusion barrier of Zn2+ within the MXene/BCF host electrodes compared to pure MXene film electrodes without BCF nanospacer. Further in-situ Raman and ex-situ XPS spectroscopy characterizations suggest: the consequently accelerated Zn2+ diffusion involved adsorption/desorption featured charge storage, and followed electrochemical reaction of Zn2+ with oxygen terminal groups on the MXene flakes induced additional pseudocapacitance within the MXene/BCF host electrodes simultaneously contribute to the acquired superior areal capacitance of the fabricated symmetrical aqueous Zn-ions MSCs (ZMSCs) based on the MXene/BCF host electrodes and Zn(CF3SO3)(2)/polyacrylamide hydrogel electrolyte. Meanwhile, combined with doubled voltage window (1.2 V) benefiting from the cocurrently suppressed kinetics of hydrogen/oxygen evolution within the MXene/BCF host electrodes, a tremendously increased areal energy density (34.0 mu Wh cm(-2)) in comparison with that employing conventional H2SO4/polyacrylamide hydrogel electrolyte (0.6 V/8.6 mu Wh cm(-2)) is finally realized. The work demonstrates a simple and effective strategy to synchronously boost bivalent Zn2+ diffusion and depress hydrogen/oxygen evolution within MXene host electrodes toward symmetric ZMSCs of high areal energy density.									24	2	0	0	1	0	24			2405-8297	2405-8289		WOS:000667459600002

The multiple metal centers trigger a cooperative catalytic effect that decreases the reaction energy barrier. However, it remains a grand chal-lenge in mimicking the metalloenzymes in heterogeneous catalysts. C2N is an emerging 2D material with a predictive regular holey framework. Its large hole with a diameter of similar to 8.35 A contains three pairs of pyridinic nitrogen, allowing the capture of transition metals from single to triple atoms. Based on quantum chemistry calculations, we find that the introduction of double (Co-2@C2N) and triple cobalt (Co-3@C2N) atom clusters turns C2N nanosheet from semiconducting into a nearly metallic state. The confined double or triple atoms can work cooperatively toward oxygen reduction and evolution reaction (ORR and OER). Impressively, with the activation barrier of 0.57 eV, Co-3@C2N is a competitive novel candidature that can substitute bulk Pt catalyst (similar to 0.80 eV). In-depth analysis indicates that the formation of an oxo-doped field environment is the key to realize efficient oxygen electrocatalysis. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

However, due to the sluggish oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reaction (ORR and OER) kinetics and incidental side reactions in Li-O-2 battery, cycle life is much shorter than that of lithium ion battery. Here, in-situ growth of branched MnO2 nanosheets on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were generated and applied as cathode catalyst in Li-O-2 battery. The MnO2 with the morphology of petal-like nanosheets were homogeneously coated outside the CNTs to form core-shell nanowires. This structure can effectively prevent direct contact between the CNTs and Li2O2, thus avoiding or reducing the decomposition of CNTs and the formation of Li2CO3 during charge process, which can also improve the conductivity of the cathode and increase the cycling performance. As a promising cathode catalyst in Li-O-2 batteries, the branched CNT@ MnO2 nanocomposite cathode exhibits a stable deep discharge and charge cycling performance over 50 cycles, and more than 200 cycles with a fixed capacity of 500 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 200 mA g(-1).									8	2	0	0	0	0	9			2365-6549			WOS:000395433600017

It was found that Delta psbO mutant cells of C. reinhardtii grown under heterotrophic conditions (dark + acetate) were capable of assembling stable, photochemically-competent reaction centers of PSII (that was confirmed by immunological analysis of D1 protein level, pigment contents and photoinduced changes of PSII chlorophyll fluorescence yield), while the O-2-evolution activity was not revealed. The ratio F-v/F-m, for the dark grown Delta psbO mutant C. reinhardtii was 0.37, or 66% of this ratio for the dark grown wild type cells (0.56). Analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence induction curve indicated that the absence of oxygen-evolving activity could be due to some defects in the organization of the PSII catalytic manganese cluster. Decrease of the rate of the electron donation from water-oxidizing complex to the PSII reaction center as well as the appearance of an additional transient fluorescence peak during the dblark relaxation of F-v support the conclusion on damages at the PSII donor side. The data obtained testify that the dark grown PsbO-deficient cells of C. reinhardtii are able to form stable, photochemically active PSII reaction center, unable to oxidize water due to defects in the assembly of the manganese cluster.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0233-4755			WOS:000264151700004

Understanding the electrochemical reaction processes is fundamental for battery design and performance enhancement of Na-CO2 batteries. Using in-situ environmental transmission electron microscopy in CO2 gas, we directly probed the morphology evolution and phase transformations of the charge and discharge products with single Pt atom and nitride doped carbon nanotube (Pt@NCNT) cathode in a Na-CO2 nanobattery. The discharge reaction produces Na2CO3 and carbon, which subsequently decomposed into Na ions and CO2 during charge. The discharge rate was boosted with the help of the single-atom Pt catalyst. Our work provides a fundamental insight into the governing principles on Na-CO2 battery design for better energy storage devices.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2405-8297			WOS:000598789700010

Crystallite nature, phase purity and thermal analysis of the prepared compounds were investigated by PXRD, FT-IR and TGA techniques. Structural analyses were performed by the FullProf program employing profile matching with constant scale factors. The results showed that the patterns had a main cubic structure with space group of Fd3m. The cell parameter data calculated by rietveld analysis showed that the cell parameters were nearly constant. The morphological and structural properties of the obtained materials were examined by FESEM and TEM images. Besides, the magnetic measurements of Co3O4 and Co3-xDyxO4 nanoparticles were performed by vibration sampling magnetometer (VSM). Coercivity (Hc) and remanent magnetization (Mr) were found to be reduced in Dy3+ doped Co3O4 while saturation magnetization (Ms) was increased moderately. The effect of dysprosium ion addition was also studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV) for the oxygen evolution reaction in an alkaline environment. The obtained data showed that the presence of Dy3+ exhibited a much higher oxygen evolution activity and lower over potential compared to Co3O4.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			2251-7871	2251-788X		WOS:000457692400009

The orr is strongly inhibited on the (100) surface modified by adsorbed Cl- (Cl-ad), and it occurs as a 3.5e(-) reduction via, solution phase peroxide formation. In the hydrogen adsorption (H-upd) potential region, the orr is even more inhibited, and corresponds only to a 2 e(-) reduction at the negative potential limit where the electrode is covered by one monolayer of H-upd and some (unknown) amount of Cl-ad. On the Pt(111)-Cl-ad surface, the orr is inhibited relatively little tin addition to that caused by strong bisulfate anion adsorption on this surface), and the reaction pathway is the same as in Cl- free solution. The kinetics of the hor on Pt(111) are the same in pure solution and in a solution containing Cl-, since Cl-ad does not affect platinum sites required for the breaking of the H-H bond. A relatively large inhibition of the hor is observed on the (100) surface, implying that strongly adsorbed Cl-ad is present on the surface even near 0 V. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this work, we design and synthesize ultrafine metal oxides nanoparticles (NPs) homogenously distributed on cobalt-based MOF (Co-MOF) nanosheets for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by a facile solvothermal reaction and subsequent partially controlled pyrolysis. The ultrafine Co3O4 NPs with a particle size of about 1.5 nm can be obtained from the dispersed elemental Co in Co-MOF and uniformly generated on the surface of the MOF, which is crucial for the for-mation of the unique heterostructure. The well-designed Co-MOF-350 exhibits an efficient electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential of 239 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 63 mV dec(-1), and an outstanding catalytic stability for OER, much superior to the pure Co-MOF and Co3O4 electrocatalyst. The intriguing OER performance mainly originates from the desirable combination of the abundant active sites, the extended electron transport channel between ultrafine metal oxides and Co-MOF nanosheets. More importantly, the work will help to design novel heteroarchitectured MOFs-based composites as efficient and robust electrocatalysts for practical applications. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

In this article, we report on a facile method to control concentration of oxygen vacancies inside ZnO nanostructures and related physical properties based on adjustment of thermal transformation conditions from ZnO2 to ZnO, including annealing atmosphere and temperature. ZnO2 spheres assembled with nanoparticles were formed through the reaction between zinc nitrate and hydrogen peroxide. Significantly, it was found that the adopted temperature and atmosphere have remarkable impact on the concentration of oxygen vacancies, which was revealed by the variations of featured Raman scattering peaks at 584 cm(-1). Furthermore, with the increase of oxygen vacancies inside ZnO, the optical band-gap was found to red-shift 350 meV and the room-temperature ferromagnetism became stronger up to 1.6 emu/mg. The defect formation and evolution were discussed according to the chemical equilibrium of decomposition reaction under special local heating environment. This work demonstrated that ZnO2 decomposition is an effective process to control the defect states inside ZnO and related properties. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, the challenge remains due to the complex synthesis process and insufficient stability. A sustainable approach is applied to synthesizing SACs through laser irradiation and gaining mesoporous graphene oxide (MGO). The surface dangling bonds of nitrogen-doped MGO (NMGO) extract metal atoms species from Co or Fe metal foams and convert them to SAC via an appropriate synthesis approach. Notably, the Co-NMGO electrocatalyst requires low potentials of 146 mV to convey a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) towards HER. Similarly, the Fe-NMGO electrocatalyst offers an onset of 0.79 V towards ORR in acidic solution. The individual metal atoms are confirmed via aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray absorption near-edge structure and extended X-ray absorption fine structure. Density functional theory calculations by applying the grand canonical potential kinetics model revealed that Co-NMGO shows the optimum free reaction energy of -0.17 eV at -0.1 V for HER, and Fe-NMGO has less limiting potential than that of Co-NMGO for ORR case. This work opens a new approach towards the synthesis of SAC and its mechanistic understandings.									14	1	0	0	0	0	13			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000695857400001

We attempt to address these technical challenges through the synthesis of cobalt-chromiumlayered double hydroxide nanosheets (CoCr LDH) on oxidizedcarbon nanotube (O-CNT) backbones as efficient OER electrocatalysts. Microscopic and elemental distribution analysis suggests that interconnected sheets of CoCr LDH masks over O-CNTs. We tested various compositions of the CoCr LDH_O-CNT hybrid (by varying the molar ratios of Co and Cr) along with the weight adjustment between CoCr LDH and O-CNTs to obtain an optimal OER activity. Due to the synergistic effect, the CoCr-LDH(3:1)_O-CNT (2:1) exhibits the lowest overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with a corresponding smaller Tafel slope of 42 mV dec(-1), which outperforms the other tested materials. The catalytically active site of Co2+ is boosted by Cr3+ as a charge transfer site owing to the spin-spin coupling between 3d(7) of Co and 3d(3) of Cr3+, which is evidenced by electron paramagnetic resonance results. Furthermore, the mildly oxidized carbon nanotubes offer the conducting channels to CoCr-LDH for faster charge transfer during OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2574-0970		WOS:000800286500096

It includes geometrical parameters of the cathode, e.g., the internal surface area and the electrode thickness, and also material parameters, e.g., the surface reaction rate and the vacancy diffusion coefficient. The model is successfully applied to a total of 42 impedance spectra, obtained in the temperature range 555 degrees C-852 degrees C and in the oxygen partial pressure range 0.028 atm-1.00 atm for a cathode consisting of a 50/50 wt% mixture of (La0.6Sr0.4)(0.99)CoO3-delta and Ce0.9Gd0 1O1.95-delta. The surface exchange coefficient in oxygen for T = 802 degrees C and po(2) = 1.00 atm is found to be k(EX) = 1.42 x 10(-4) m s(-1) and with an activation energy of E-a = 107 kJ mol(-1), in fair agreement with literature. A parameter variation and a steady state analysis is performed, verifying the soundness of the model and providing both qualitative and quantitative information on the evolution of the impedance spectra of cathodes with changing parameters.

Herein, the rational synthesis of bimetallic phosphide nanoparticles anchored onto N-doped carbon of CoNiP/ NC-X (X = 1, 2, 3 represent the molar ratio between Co and Ni of 1:1, 1:2, 2:1 in crystalline precursors, respectively) nanocomposites as high-performance electrocatalysts, which are calcined from a series of Co/Ni-based isostructural coordination polymers as the precursors. After pyrolysis, the as-obtained CoNiP/NC-1 nanostrips are intrinsically endowed with favorable nanostructure, large specific surface area, suitable heteroatom doping, abundant catalytic active sites and highly graphitic carbon network. Therefore, it exhibits a decent quasi-4-electron OER performance with a small overpotential of 330 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 80.5 mV dec(-1) and a 94.27% current retention after 10 hours in alkaline solution. The hierarchical nanostructures of CoNiP/NC-X series and their positive response to electrocatalytic properties have shed light on the preparation of other non-noble metal based carbon nanomaterials for efficient energy-related applications.

In this work, a type of microsized Cu-based metal-organic framework (MOF) of Cu BTB has been successfully synthesized by a rapid reaction within half an hour. During the subsequent pyrolysis, a large number of N-containing carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) are grown on the entire surface of hierarchically porous MOF-derived nanosized carbons through the introduction of ethylene and ammonia, denoted as NCNT/Cu/C. After oxidation, NCNT-supported nanosized copper oxide embedded in a carbon matrix (NCNT/CuO/C) is finally obtained to show the preserved morphology and high graphitization degree. The high specific surface area and conductivity of NCNTs for NCNT/CuO/C further enable the electrolyte to make better contact with the active materials during the OER. Finally, the optimal nanosized NCNT/CuO/C exhibits a high degree of improvement in OER performance, in which it attains an overpotential of only 369 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and its Tafel slope is calculated to be 87.4 mV dec(-1), indicating fast reaction kinetics. The demonstrated work proves that the method of doping NCNTs with nanosized copper oxides can effectively enhance the efficacy of water oxidation, which can be further used in future energy applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2574-0970		WOS:000752894100074

Generally, the catalytic performance of nanocrystals (NCs) toward ORR and OER depends on both composition and shape. Herein, we report the synthesis of polyhedral Au NCs enclosed by a variety of index facets: cubic gold (Au) NCs enclosed by {100} facets; truncated octahedral Au NCs enclosed by {100} and {110} facets; and trisoctahedral (TOH) Au NCs enclosed by 24 high-index {441} facets, as effective cathode catalysts for Li-O-2 batteries. All Au NCs can significantly reduce the charge potential and have high reversible capacities. In particular, TOH Au NC catalysts demonstrated the lowest charge-discharge overpotential and the highest capacity of similar to 20 298 mA h g(-1). The correlation between the different Au NC crystal planes and their electrochemical catalytic performances was revealed: high-index facets exhibit much higher catalytic activity than the low-index planes, as the high-index planes have a high surface energy because of their large density of atomic steps, ledges and kinks, which can provide a high density of reactive sites for catalytic reactions.									50	6	0	0	5	0	52			1884-4049	1884-4057		WOS:000349158400008

Herein, we proposed a method through spray-drying coupling high-temperature reduction, which had simple, efficient, and wide-scale applications compared with the traditional synthetic process, and a RuCo NPs/CNTs hydrogen evolution catalyst was fabricated successfully. Zero-dimensional (0D) RuCo nanoparticles (<10 nm) embedded on one-dimensional (1D) CNTs uniformly and CNTs involving each other could offer numerous mass transfer pore canals and a large active specific surface area; on the other hand, Ru would possess an enhanced HER activity with the incorporation of Co for optimizing the adsorption energy of intermediates by the synergistic effect, which was verified through DFT calculation. Benefitting from the porous structure and metallic nanostructure, the RuCo NPs/CNTs-400 degrees C prepared in this paper showed excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance, with low overpotentials of 39 and 27 mV at the current density of 10 mA.cm(-2), small Tafel slopes of 32 and 27 mV.dec(-1), and superior durability for 24 h in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH solutions, respectively.

However, a large overpotential is required for the water oxidation reaction due to its sluggish kinetics, which leads to high energy consumption and low hydrogen production efficiency. Herein, copper hydroxide@nickel-iron hydroxide (Cu(OH)(2)@FeNi(OH)(x)) core-shell nanotube electrocatalysts are developed for an alternative methanol oxidation reaction to replace the conventional water oxidation reaction for boosting hydrogen evolution with less energy consumption. The average diameter of the Cu(OH)(2)@FeNi(OH)(x) nanotube is about 250 nm, and the surface is covered with FeNi(OH)(x) nanoflakes. The Cu(OH)(2)@FeNi(OH)(x) electrocatalysts demonstrate remarkable activity toward methanol oxidation, which require an anodic potential of only 1.32 V vs RHE to deliver a current density of 60 mA cm(-2), being 160 mV lower than that of water oxidation. The lower potential of anodic reaction coupled with cathodic hydrogen evolution showcases the energy-saving capability in hydrogen production from water splitting. Moreover, methanol is exclusively converted into value-added formate with high selectivity and high Faradaic efficiency close to 100% in a wide potential range. The Cu(OH)(2)@FeNi(OH)(x) electrocatalysts also exhibit excellent stability for methanol-water coelectrolysis to produce pure hydrogen fuel and formate value-added chemicals.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2574-0970		WOS:000702079900009

Transition metal hydroxide has been wildly utilized as a promising candidate, but practical implementation is impeded by insufficient catalytic activity, easy agglomeration, and poor conductivity. Here, we report that both phosphorization and combination with MXnene can improve the catalysts' intrinsic activity and conductivity. Besides, MXene also prevents the agglomeration of the nanoparticles, resulting in the enhanced exposure of active sites. Experimental characterizing and density functional theory simulations revealed that P species can attract electrons to promote the formation of high-valence states of adjacent metal atoms, and coupling MXene support can effectively modulate the electronic structure and optimize the d -band center, which boosts the OER performance. Consequently, the optimized NiFeCoP/Mxene catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 240 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm -2 , a small Tafel slope of 55 mV dec -1 , and superior long-term stability of 40 h in 1 M KOH electrolyte, which is superior to other counterparts.

Herein, we report the synthesis of unique trimetallic PtPdNi mesoporous-truncated octahedral nanocages (PtPdNi MTONs), which is simply performed by first constructing Pd@PtPdNi core-shell mesoporous truncated octahedra (Pd@PtPdNi MTOs) and further selective etching of the Pd cores using concentrated nitric acid. The rational combinations of polyhedral shape, mesoporous surface, and hollow structure provide sufficiently exposed active sites and efficient reactant permeability. With these unique properties, the PtPdNi MTONs show improved catalytic activity and stability toward the oxygen reduction reaction.									48	0	0	0	2	0	48			1944-8244			WOS:000457816900065	30649857

These mixtures were characterized by XRD and SEM. The anode catalyst powders were sprayed onto Nafion 117 membrane (catalyst coated membrane, CCM), using Pt catalyst at the cathode. The CCM procedure was extended to different in-house prepared catalyst formulations to evaluate if such a method could be applied to electrolyzers containing durable titanium backings. The catalyst loading at the anode was about 6 mg cm(-2), whereas 1 mg cm(-2) Pt was used at the cathode. The electrochemical activity for water electrolysis was investigated in a single cell SPE electrolyzer at 80 A degrees C. It was found that the terminal voltage obtained with Ir-Ta oxide was slightly lower than that obtained with IrO2-Pt and IrO2-RuO2 at low current density (lower than 0.15 A cm(-2)). At higher current density, the IrO2-Pt and IrO2-RuO2 catalysts performed better than Ir-Ta oxide.									107	5	0	0	4	0	109			0021-891X			WOS:000262586500006

The design and synthesis of highly effective catalysts toward hydrogen production from aqueous AB is of paramount significance. Here, the facile synthesis of Rh nanoparticles (NPs) immobilized on nanodiamond (nano-DA) and concomitant AB hydrolysis to produce hydrogen was successfully achieved. The in situ generated Rh/nano-DA exhibited excellent catalytic activity toward AB hydrolysis, with a high turnover frequency (TOF) value of 729.4 min(-1)at 25 degrees C and a low activation energy of 25.6 kJ mol(-1). Moreover, the catalyst could be reused four times. The unique properties of DA with abundant oxygen-containing groups enable the homogeneous distribution of small and surface-clean Rh NPs on the nano-DA surface, which can supply abundant accessible active sites for hydrogen evolution from AB hydrolysis. This study demonstrated that nano-DA can be applied as an ideal matrix to deposit efficient Rh nanocatalyst toward hydrogen evolution reaction.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				2073-4344		WOS:000580113800001

Mo2C and Ti3C2 exhibited faradaic efficiencies of 90% (250 mV overpotential) and 65% (650 mV overpotential), respectively, for the reduction of CO2 to CO in acetonitrile using an ionic liquid electrolyte. The use of ionic liquid 1-ethyl-2-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate as an electrolyte in organic solvent suppressed the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested that the catalytic active sites are oxygen vacancy sites on both MXene surfaces. Also, a spontaneous dissociation of adsorbed COOH species to a water molecule and adsorbed CO on Mo2C promote the CO2RR.									17	1	0	0	2	0	17			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000618825200023	33465209

Herein, a method to stabilize the charge redistribution on catalysts by constructing Pt-RuO2@KB heterostructures with strong metal-support interactions is proposed first to achieve remarkable water splitting performance in acidic media. By performing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) before and after a 150 h long-time v-t test, it is found that the electron transfer from Pt to RuO2 could form a stable charge redistribution. Benefiting from the Pt-RuO2 heterostructures, the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between Pt-RuO2 and KB as well as the stable charge redistribution between Pt and RuO2, Pt-RuO2@KB exhibits ultrahigh intrinsic activity (the turnover frequency (TOF) value is 34.5 s(-1) @ 300 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 20.2 s(-1) @ 100 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively) and outstanding overall water splitting performance (only needs 1.54 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)). Notably, Pt-RuO2@KB with the stable charge redistribution exhibits striking stability for overall water splitting; during a 150 h continuous v-t test, the voltage is maintained well without noticeable degradation in 0.1 M HClO4. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations verify that the charge redistribution between Pt and RuO2 can dramatically lower the water splitting barrier and raise the vacancy formation energy of atoms in the catalyst, which could effectively inhibit the dissolution of atoms in Pt-RuO2@KB in an acidic medium and achieve superior water electrolysis performance.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000813011700001

Action spectra and the mechanism of photoinduced formation of hydrogen and oxygen on potassium niobates								HIGH ENERGY CHEMISTRY				43	1			34	37		10.1134/S0018143909010056				JAN 2009	2009	Powdered samples of complex oxides-potassium niobates with a layered structure were prepared via high-temperature synthesis followed by grinding. The action spectra of photoinduced processes on potassium niobates with different phase compositions in aqueous and aquo-organic systems were determined. It was shown that the evolution of oxygen was due to its photodesorption and occurred upon illumination with light at an energy near the edge of intrinsic niobate absorption. The formation of hydrogen in aqueous systems is due to the photocatalytic dehydrogenation of trace organic compounds adsorbed on potassium niobate, rather than to the photodecomposition of water. The quantum efficiency of the photocatalytic dehydrogenation increased by an order of magnitude when hydrogen-containing organic compounds were added to the reaction mixture.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0018-1439	1608-3148		WOS:000263160400005

To promote ORR activity, intensive effort has been made to engineer manganese dioxides with either abundant defects or high electrical conductivity. In this work, a balance in engineering between defects and electrical conductivity in controllable engineering of alpha-MnO2 is successfully demonstrated. By controlling the reaction temperature (60, 80, and 140 degrees C), three-dimensional (3D) dandelion-like alpha-MnO2 microspheres were synthesized with different degrees of defects and electrical conductivities. The alpha-MnO2 with either more defects or higher electrical conductivity should possess better ORR performance. However, with increasing synthesis temperature, the defects in the as-prepared samples decreased, while the electrical conductivity increased. Therefore, the preparation alpha-MnO2 at 60 degrees C or 140 degrees C for the best ORR performance remains unclear. As determined by electrochemical measurement, the alpha-MnO2 prepared at 80 degrees C with moderate defects and electrical conductivity exhibits superior ORR performance with a potential of 0.79 V at a current density of -3mA cm(-2), which is considered outstanding for manganese oxides. This work shed new light on the strategy to simultaneously regulate the defect and electrical conductivity, and a balance between them should produce an effective catalyst for ORR.

J	Karfa, Paramita; Majhi, Kartick C.; Madhuri, Rashmi								Shape-Dependent Electrocatalytic Activity of Iridium Oxide Decorated Erbium Pyrosilicate toward the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction over the Entire pH Range								ACS CATALYSIS				8	9			8830	8843		10.1021/acscatal.8b01363				SEP 2018	2018	The synthesis of iridium oxide decorated erbium pyrosilicate (Er2Si2O7:IrO2) was performed by a simple sol-gel technique. By simple alteration of the reaction parameters, different shapes (i.e., cubes, rods, large spheres, small spheres, and sheets) of Er2Si2O7:IrO2 were obtained and their catalytic activities were tested toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Among the different morphologies of Er2Si2O7:IrO2, cube-shaped nanoparticles (Er2Si2O7:IrO2-5) with sharp edges provided promising HER activity over a wide pH range from 0 to 14 in acidic, neutral, and basic media. Er2Si2O7:IrO2-5 exhibited an onset potential of -0.076 V with a very high current density of 252 mA cm(-2) (at -0.54 V). The overpotential and Tafel slope for the HER using Er2Si2O7:IrO2-5 were found to be 130 mV and 49 mV/dec, 170 mV and 59 mV/dec, and 190 mV and 67 mV/dec in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1.0 M KOH, and 2.0 M PBS, respectively. The low cost, highly active electrocatalyst shows robust durability over acidic medium for nearly 250 min. Such a superior catalytic activity can be attributed to the synergistic effect between IrO2 and erbium pyrosilicate, in which the 4f orbital (not fully occupied) of rare-earth elements may have occupied the 5d orbital and become valence electrons, resulting in the improved HER activity.									28	2	0	0	2	0	28			2155-5435			WOS:000444364800115

The latter feature is fully out of the window in an electrochemical context, where only the few catalytic species that are sufficiently close to the electrode undergo redox reactions. Especially in the water oxidation reaction where harsh reaction conditions are employed, a clear picture of what is the active species, what products are formed, how one can steer this, and how it all depends on the exact reaction conditions is important to be able to fully unravel the key reaction paths. The combination of electrochemical experiments with on-line detection of the catalytic species and reaction products is a powerful approach to successfully address these questions. Recently, a significant progress has been made in on-line studies on molecular water oxidation catalysts during electrochemical experiments. These are reviewed here.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000411863400001	28894861

Herein, we report that 2D nanosheet-shaped cobalt-iron-layered double hydroxide (CoFe-LDH) is a highly active and stable oxygen evolution catalyst. The Fe3+ is capable of tailoring the component ranging from hydroxides to LDH and broadening the interlayer space of as-made 2D materials. Benefiting from the synergistic effects between Co and Fe species and the LDH-layered structure, the shortened ion transport distance in the nanoscale dimension, and the broader interlayer space, an enhanced mass transfer behavior for OER is demonstrated. The as-made CoFe-LDH shows high electrocatalytic activity, which is superior to those of corresponding Co(OH)(2) and the mixed phase samples of Co(OH)(2) and FeOOH, as well as RuO2 and commercial Pt/C catalysts. Assembling CoFe-LDH on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to configure the 2D sheet-on-sheet binary architectures (CoFe-LDH/rGO) can further create well-interconnected conductive networks within the electrode matrix, leading to the lowest overpotential of 325 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Collectively, such integrated characteristics with alternated components will endow the as-made 2D-structured catalysts with a potential and superb superiority as low-cost earth-abundance catalysts for water oxidation.									155	11	0	0	6	0	157			2196-7350			WOS:000374153000010

We present a combinatorial approach based on an optical scanning droplet cell for simultaneous deposition and systematic characterization of co-catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on Mo-doped BiVO4 (Mo-BiVO4) photoanodes electrochemically pre-deposited on transparent conductive FTO substrates. The loading and photoelectrochemical characterization of 10 different OER co-catalysts deposited by three different deposition techniques on FTO-supported Mo-BiVO4 were investigated aiming at determination of the suitable deposition parameters affording the highest enhancement of photoelectrochemical oxygen evolution for the different OER/Mo-BiVO4 films. A comparison of the photoelectrochemical performance of films of various OER co-catalyst deposited on FTO-supported Mo-BiVO4 by electrodeposition, photo-assisted electrodeposition and photodeposition revealed the necessity of a material specific optimization with respect to co-catalyst loading and deposition technique to achieve optimal IPCE for each co-catalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1040-0397	1521-4109		WOS:000479081100013

As a classic carbon material, graphene has many excellent properties and thus may be a good support to stabilize the isolated metal atoms. However, the oxygen evolution activity of a single cobalt atom supported on graphene is still very low. To improve its performance, support modification has been carried out based on a density functional theory framework for the design predication. In our theoretical study, two nitrogen formats are incorporated to the graphene substrates, including graphitic nitrogen and pyridine-like nitrogen, which are usually observed in experiment. The oxygen evolution process has been envisaged on these single cobalt atom catalysts via gas phase adsorption calculation. The electronic structure on the single Co active site can be effectively regulated by the support modification, which will contribute to its enhanced performance. Henceforth, free energy change diagrams, partial density of states, Raman spectra, and charge density difference are discussed. It is suggested that incorporating pyridine-like nitrogen on graphene is an ideal approach for the supported Co atom to achieve high OER activity, opening up new opportunity for the preparation and application of highly active and stable single atomic catalysts.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000447680400064	30285437

The effect of calcination temperature on the physical-chemical properties and the electrochemical performance of IrO2 were examined to obtain a low loading and a high catalytic activity of oxygen evolution at the electrode. The physical-chemical properties were studied via thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The electrochemical activity was investigated by using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and chronopotentiometry in 0.1 mol L-1 H2SO4 at room temperature. The optimum condition was found to be at the calcination temperature of 500 degrees C, where the total polarization reached a minimum at high current densities (>200 mA cm(-2)). The optimized catalyst was also applied to a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and stationary current-potential relationships were investigated. With an optimized catalytic IrO2 loading of 1.5 mg cm(-2) and a 40% Pt/C loading of 0.5 mg cm(-2), the terminal applied potential difference was 1.72 V at 2 A cm(-2) and 80 degrees C in a SPE water electrolysis cell.

Engineering an electrocatalyst with a regulated electronic structure and abundant active sites is an effective way to enhance the electrocatalytic activity. Herein, N-doped C-encapsulated Ni nanoparticles (Ni@N-C) are synthesized through a traditional hydrothermal reaction, followed by pyrolyzing under an Ar/H-2 atmosphere. The electrochemical measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the electron transfer between the Ni core and the N-C shell induces the electron density redistribution on Ni@N-C, which directly promotes the adsorption and desorption of H* on the N-doped carbon (N-C) layer and thus dramatically enhances hydrogen production. Taking advantage of the porous spherical structure and the synergistic effects between Ni and N-doped carbon (N-C) layer, we obtain a Ni@N-C electrocatalyst that exhibits remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with low overpotentials of 117 and 325 mV, respectively. Impressively, the assembled cell using Ni@N-C as both anode and cathode exhibits excellent activity as well as stable cyclability for over 12 h.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000648429200068	33835778

The development of highly efficient, stable, and noble-metal-free bifunctional electrocatalysts has sparked a huge surge in investigation in the field of electrocatalytic (EC) water splitting. Herein, an original 1D core@2D branch CdS@Co9S8/Ni3S2 electrode is prepared in situ on Co/Ni alloy foam through a simple one-pot hydrothermal process. The binder-free, self-supported CdS@Co9S8/Ni3S2 is demonstrated to be a low-cost and highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solution. The optimal CdS@Co9S8/Ni3S2 electrode exhibits excellent bifunctional HER and OER properties with quite low overpotentials of 69.6 and 285 mV required to reach EC currents of -10 and 20 mA cm(-2), respectively. Moreover, using the CdS@Co9S8/Ni3S2 electrode as both the anode and cathode, the assembled electrolyzer only required a 1.56 V cell voltage to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Significantly, it was also found that such a metal foam-supported photocatalyst/electrocatalyst electrode can effectively realize dual model incorporated photo-assisted electrocatalytic overall water splitting, which delivers a 174.1% higher H-2 production rate than that of electrocatalysis only. This work may open a new avenue for the synergistic use of solar energy and electric energy in the production of hydrogen from water splitting.									45	1	0	0	3	0	45			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000521938400013

Nevertheless, it is still challenging to exploit low-cost and stable Z-scheme photocatalysts with highly-efficient H-2 evolution from solar water-splitting so far. Herein, we report a novel all-solid-state Z-scheme photocatalyst Cd1-xZnxS@WO3-x consisting of Cd1-xZnxS nanorods coated with oxygen-deficient WO3-x amorphous layers. The Cd1-xZnxS@WO3-x exhibits an outstanding H-2 evolution reaction (HER) activity as compared with Pt-loaded Cd1-xZnxS and most WO3- and CdS-based photocatalysts, due to the generation of stronger reducing electrons through the appropriate Zn-doping in Cd1-xZnxS and the enhanced charge transfer by introducing oxygen vacancies (W5+/OVs) into the ultrathin WO3-x amorphous coatings. The optimal HER rate of Cd1-xZnxS@WO3-x is determined to be 21.68 mmol h(-1) g(-1), which is further raised up to 28.25 mmol h(-1) g(-1) (about 12 times more than that of Pt/Cd1-xZnxS) when Cd1-xZnxS@WO3-x is hybridized by CoOx and NiOx dual cocatalysts (Cd1-xZnxS@WO3-x/CoOx/NiOx) through in-situ photo-deposition. Moreover, the corresponding apparent quantum yield (AQY) at 420 nm is significantly increased from 34.6% for Cd1-xZnxS@WO3-x to 60.8% for Cd1-xZnxS@WO3-x/CoOx/NiOx. In addition, both Cd1-xZn--S@WO3-x and Cd1-xZnxS@WO3-x/CoOx/NiOx demonstrate good stability towards HER. The results displayed in this work will inspire the rational design and synthesis of high-performance nanostructures for photocatalytic applications.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000511708400009		
J	Cheng, Yu; Pang, Kanglei; Xu, Xiaohui; Yuan, Pengfei; Zhang, Zhiguo; Wu, Xiao; Zheng, Lirong; Zhang, Jianan; Song, Rui								Borate crosslinking synthesis of structure tailored carbon-based bifunctional electrocatalysts directly from guar gum hydrogels for efficient overall water splitting								CARBON				157				153	163		10.1016/j.carbon.2019.10.024				FEB 2020	2020	Given the efficiency, stability and sustainability, the carbon-based materials have become one of promising bifunctional electrocatalysts to the electrochemical water splitting, involving hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, there are still many challenges about the design and mechanism study of the carbon-based electrocatalysts. In this paper, we reported B, N co-doping carbon nanosheets which were synthesized via cationic intercalation stripping guar gum carbon aerogels pre-crosslinked by borate, B(OH)(4)(-). This facile strategy not only realizes the structure tailoring, but also concurrently improves the doping efficiency and the stability of the hetero atoms. Specifically, the cost-efficient carbon-based bifunctional catalyst (B5/GCS) shows an outstanding HER and OER performance displaying a remarkable activity both in acidic and alkaline media, low onset potentials for both HER (39.12 mV) and OER (1.38 V) in the same electrolyte (0.5 M H2SO4). Notably, when employed as the bifunctional electrocatalysts with a two-electrode electrolyzer for water splitting, the B5/GCS generated a cell voltage of 1.45 V to attain 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4. Furthermore, a series of experiments combining density functional theory calculations revealed that the observed superb water splitting activity could be attributed to a synergistic effect of N, B co-doping and the formation of fragmented nanosheets with topological defects, which collaboratively promotes the proton adsorption and catalytic kinetics.

Inspired by natural photosynthesis, Z-scheme imparts a unique vectorial electron transfer from the ingenious arrangement of PS I-PS II coupling connected by an electron mediator. This allows Z-scheme to confer efficient charge isolation and split water into its constituent components, hydrogen (H-2) and oxygen (O-2), at two different positions with strong redox ability. More recently, particulate Z-scheme photocatalyst sheets have been worth noting as potentially scalable approach for solar water splitting. In this contribution, particulate Z-scheme photocatalyst sheets were developed using P-doped twinned Zn0.5Cd0.5S1-x (d-ZCS-P) as hydrogen evolution photocatalysts (HEP) and Bi4NbO8Cl as oxygen evolution photocatalysts (OEP), which both embedded on N-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) as carbon conductive film. Further surface modification on photocatalyst sheets through concerted deposition of co-catalyst and protective shell warrants an efficient overall water splitting from pure water, with a solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency (STH) of 0.15% under ambient condition. The rational Z-scheme configuration of photocatalyst sheets alleviates the effect of H+ and OH- concentration overpotentials which in turn bolstering the photocatalytic performance and paves a promising way of solar energy augmentation.									17	3	0	0	1	0	18			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000607583700004

The SO4.- radical produced by the electron transfer quenching of Ru(bipy)3(2+*) by S2O8(2-) reacts rapidly with both acetate buffer and chloride ions. These side reactions result in a reduction in the overall quantum yield of Ru(bipy)3(3+) production and reduced reaction selectivity when Ru(bipy)3(2+*) is quenched by persulphate.

On the clean Fe(100) surface upon adsorption at 100 K, the S-H and C-S bonds of the neopentyl thiol cleave, resulting in adsorbed S, H, and neopentyl alkyl fragments, in contrast to the formation of the alkyl thiolate observed on the adsorption of n-alkane thiols on this surface. Upon heating, some neopentyl alkyl fragments react with adsorbed surface hydrogen to evolve neopentane at 260 K. On the oxygen-modified surface, only S-H bond cleavage is observed, and a neopentyl thiolate surface species is formed. No initial neopentane evolution from the oxygen-modified surface is observed upon heating. However, on both surfaces, isobutene and trace amounts of neopentane are seen to desorb at 380 K as a result of an elimination reaction pathway for the majority of the remaining neopentyl hydrocarbon species. Small hydrocarbon fragments remain on the surface until they finally decompose to leave atomic carbon and sulfur on the iron surface at 500 K.									7	1	0	0	0	0	8			1089-5647			WOS:000086599700041

Their catalytic performance is compared to stoichiometric Degussa P25 TiO2. On mere decreasing O/Ti ratio, native titania turns from a photoelectrocatalyst to electrocatalyst for improved water splitting. At a stoichiometric composition of TiO1.81, titania acts as an absolute photoanode for an oxygen evolution reaction and generates a photocurrent of 0.62 mA cm(-2) at 0 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode under AM1.5 simulated solar illumination while acting as a poor electrocatalyst with high onset potential of 650 mV for a hydrogen evolution reaction. On increasing the oxygen vacancies in titania, relatively higher electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution is observed for defect-rich TiO1.54 and affords a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at just an overpotential of 610 mV, despite its negligible photoelectrocatalytic activity. Since defect concentration in titania is mainly responsible for the trade-off between electrocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic water-splitting behavior, systematic attempts have also been made to understand the interplay between defects and catalysis of titania. The different intrinsic characteristics of defect-rich titania ranging from microscopic structural evolution (X-ray diffraction and microscopic imaging) to chemical speciation (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance, and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy) to kinetics of electro/photoelectrochemical water splitting [intensity-modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, open-circuit photovoltage decay, depth of trap states (DOS) measurement] are extensively studied in this work. Unequivocally, the higher photoelectrocatalytic water-splitting activity of TiO1.81 is due to its large microstrain (1.9%) associated optimum defect-induced lattice distortion index (0.006), which facilitates high charge transfer efficiency (82%) with a low recombination rate constant (1.98 s(-1)) of photogenerated electron-hole pair by favorable DOS. On the other hand, high density of oxygen vacancy in TiO1.54 induces a magnanimous distortion index (0.035) in TiO6 octahedra with a small microstrain of 0.4%, which provides a high donor density (10.2 x 10(18) cm(-3)) and favors efficient electrocatalytic water-splitting activity. Overall, this work highlights the overlooked and unexploited facets of defect engineering.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000626769200074

To get high purity MoSe2 nanoflakes, the reaction parameters are optimized. The TEM and Raman analysis confirmed the formation of few-layered MoSe2 nanoflakes consisting of 2 to 3 layers. The influence of Se content on the OER and capacitive performance of MoSe2 are studied in detail. The catalyst with optimal electrochemical performance (MS1.8) shows outstanding OER activity and capacitive performance. It requires a low overpotential of only 320 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a low Tafel slope of 45.3 mV dec(-1). Also, it exhibited a specific capacity of 25 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1). The excellent OER activity of the MoSe2 nanoflakes can be attributed to the few-layered structure, which provides a high electrochemical surface area. Moreover, the prepared MoSe2 nanoflakes show excellent cyclic stability up to 5000 CV cycles. Our findings indicate that the amount of Se in MoSe2 plays a significant role in achieving maximum electrochemical performance from MoSe2. The method used in this study may provide a low-cost and simple technique to synthesize non-noble MoSe2 for a wide-scale application.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000779067400004

Herein, a hierarchical hollow (Co,Ni)Se-2@NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanocage was synthesized by deriving from the metal-organic framework (MOF) of ZIF-67. Concretely, it involves first fabrication of hollow rhombic (Co,Ni)Se-2 nanocages and then deposition of NiFe LDH nanosheets on the surface of nanocages. Notably, the incorporation of Ni into Co-based ZIF-67 (via ion-exchange) could tail the atomic arrangement of the MOF, exposing more additional active sites in the following selenization treatment. The as-synthesized (Co,Ni)Se-2@NiFe LDH demonstrates splendid OER performance with a small overpotential of 277 mV (to launch a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)), a small Tafel slope of 75 mV dec(-1), and robust durability (a slight stability decay of 5.1% after 17 h of continuous test), not only surpassing the commercial RuO2 but also being comparable/superior to most reported nonprevious metal-based catalysts. Upon analysis, the outstanding OER performance is attributed to the optimized adsorption/desorption nature of iron and nickel/cobalt toward the oxygenated species and partial delocalization of spin status at the interface via the bridging O2-. This work represents a solid step toward exploration of advanced catalysts with deliberate experimental design and/or atom tailoring.									137	8	0	0	5	0	137			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000460365300049	30702854

Replacing OER with low-thermodynamic oxidation process of benzylamine oxidation reaction (BOR) will significantly reduce energy consumption and produce economically beneficial chemicals simultaneously. Here we constructed self-supported 2D Fe-doped Ni-MOF nansheets on nickel foam (NiFe-MOF/NF) with precise control over Ni/Fe atomic ratios via a simple solvothermal method. When used as electrocatalysts for BOR, NiFe-MOF/NF shows an optimal performance with ultralow potential of 1.30 and 1.35 V at current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) as well as accelerated electron transfer kinetics with an ultrasmall Tafel slope of 24.3 mV dec(-1), which ranks among the top of BOR catalysts reported so far. The benzenitrile yield and Faraday efficiency reaches as high as 0.181 mmol mg(-1)h(-1) and 99% with excellent stability. Such outstanding catalytic performances can be ascribed to the self-supported 2D nanosheets on 3D NF, hierarchical porous structure, abundant surface metallic sites, enhanced electrical conductivity and boosted synergy between metals after Fe doping. Our result suggests that such MOF catalysts are attractive for energy-saving water splitting and benzonitrile production.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000809661700003

The effect was investigated by UL-94 test, limiting oxygen index, mechanical test, torque rheometer measurement, differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic mechanical analysis, and heat distortion temperature. An obvious increase in torque evolution of the PBT/AlPi composite during processing was associated with chain-extending, branching, and cross-linking reaction by the combination of EPM. The addition of 0.6 wt% EPM remarkably enhanced not only the mechanical properties but also the flame retardancy and heat resistance of the PBT/AlPi composite. A high-performance PBT/AlPi composite was developed by virtue of EPM.									8	1	0	0	0	0	9			0954-0083	1361-6412		WOS:000359918000007

The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) excitation of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) can dramatically improve the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of Li-O-2 batteries. The photoelectrons generated via LSPR can be transferred to the conduction band (CB) of SnO2 for facilitating the reduction of O-2 to form Li2O2 through the ORR, in a discharge process with illumination. Conversely, the holes left in Au NPs can promote Li2O2 oxidation in a charging process with illumination. With illumination, a 2.36 times higher discharge capacity of up to 10705.2 mA h g(-1) is observed and the discharged product (Li2O2) can be decomposed completely due to LSPR. The discharge voltage can be obviously enhanced to 3.10 V, significantly exceeding the equilibrium voltage of 2.96 V, and the charge voltage is decreased to 3.59 V. This work provides a new strategy for the decomposition of Li2O2 by improving the efficiency of charge transfer dynamics and the mechanism of LSPR in the photo-assisted (Li-O-2) battery.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000713783600001

Herein, we focus on the adsorbed hydroxyl (OHad) transfer process (OHad + e(-) reversible arrow OH-) and reveal its crucial role in promoting the overall kinetics of alkaline HER based on Ni/Co-modified MoSe2 model catalysts (Ni-MoSe2 and Co-MoSe2) that feature almost identical water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption energies, but evidently different activity trends in alkaline (Ni-MoSe2 >> Co-MoSe2) and acidic (Co-MoSe2 >= Ni-MoSe2) media. Experimental and theoretical calculation results demonstrate that tailoring MoSe2 with Ni not only optimizes the hydroxyl adsorption, but also promotes the desorption of OH- and the electron-involved conversion of OHad to OH-, all of which synergistically accelerate the kinetics of OHad + e(-) reversible arrow OH- and thereby the overall kinetics of the alkaline HER.									51	2	0	0	5	0	51			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000538860800001	32402132

Over the past years, there is a rapid rise in noble-metal-free electrocatalysts. Among them, transition metal carbides (TMCs) are highlighted due to their structural and electronic merits, e.g., high conductivity, metallic band states, tunable surface/bulk architectures, etc. Herein, representative efforts and progress made on TMCs are comprehensively reviewed, focusing on the noble-metal-like electronic configuration and the relevant structural/electronic modulation. Briefly, specific nanostructures and carbon-based hybrids are introduced to increase active-site abundance and to promote mass transportation, and heteroatom doping and heterointerface engineering are encouraged to optimize the chemical configurations of active sites toward intrinsically boosted HER kinetics.

To alleviate these problems, Cu2O nanoparticles with different crystal planes have been synthesized via a simple solution reaction and characterized as a bi-functional catalyst for non-aqueous Li-O-2 battery. In this work, catalytic behaviour of Cu2O nanoparticles with different crystal planes are initially explored and it is found that the Cu2O nanoparticles exposing {111} crystal planes exhibit the most catalytic performance compared with other crystal planes, which is further confirmed by using first-principles computations. Inspired by selectively catalytic behaviour of crystal plane, porous Cu2O nanoframes exposed with eight {111} crystal planes and higher surface area derives from all-corner-truncated rhombic dodecahedron Cu2O nanoparticles are synthesized, which can act as highly activity three-dimensional cathode in a typical Li-O-2 battery after being directly combined with carbon nanotubes by electrostatic interaction. Thanks to the excellent catalytic activity of carbon nanotubes-Cu2O nanoframes and unique cathode structure, batteries with this cathode display an enhanced electrochemical performance including superior round-trip efficiency, excellent cycling performance and high specific capacity.(C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, we prepared rutile TiO2 modified with nanoclusters of alkaline-earth metal oxides for the OER. Photocatalytic OER was performed over rutile TiO2 surface-modified with alkaline-earth oxide nanoclusters, namely, CaO and MgO. The O-2 evolution activity is notably enhanced for MgO-modified systems at low loadings and a combination of characterization and first-principles simulations allows interpretation of the role of the nanocluster modification in improving the photocatalytic performance of alkaline-earth-modified rutile TiO2. At such low loadings, the nanocluster modifiers would be small, and this facilitates a close correlation with theoretical models. Structural and surface characterizations of the modified systems indicate that the integrity of the rutile phase is maintained after modification. However, charge-carrier separation is strongly affected by the presence of surface nanoclusters. This improved performance is related to surface features such as higher ion dispersion and surface hydroxylation, which are also discussed with first-principles simulations. The modified systems are reducible so that Ti3+ ions will be present. Water dissociation is favorable at cluster and interfacial sites of the stoichiometric and reduced modified surfaces. Pathways to water oxidation at interfacial sites of reduced MgO-modified rutile TiO2 are identified, requiring an overpotential of 0.68 V. In contrast, CaO-modified systems required overpotentials in excess of 0.85 V for the reaction to proceed.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2574-0970			WOS:000545689000110

The microstructure and electrochemical properties of the electrodes were studied with scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), potentiodynamic polarization and accelerated life test. Experimental results showed that the Ti/IrOx-TiO2/IrO2 electrode has better electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution and higher stability, compared with the Ti/IrO2-Ta2O5 electrode under the same conditions. The high electrocatalytic activity of Ti/IrOx-TiO2/IrO2 electrode could be correlated with a large number of IrO2 particles on coating surface. The Ti/IrOx-TO2/IrO2 electrode exhibits a three times longer service life than that of Ti/IrO2-Ta2O5, its superior stability was attributed to the IrOx-TiO2 interlayer, which contributes to form a metastable solid solution between IrOx and thin titanium oxide layer on titanium substrate during calcination and the improvement of the bonding of IrO2 layer with the substrate.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0255-5476			INSPEC:12989701

The stoichiometry of the photocatalytic reactions usually includes the simultaneous gain or loss of electrons and protons. However, not enough emphasis has been placed on the effect of proton transfer on the photocatalytic reactions, particularly on the kinetics of interfacial redox steps. In this article, we highlight the effects of proton on the interfacial electron transfer during the photocatalytic redox reactions. We try to emphasize that the proton transfer can largely determine the energetic profile and reaction pathway by participating in the interfacial redox reactions. Better understanding on the roles and the detailed mechanisms of proton transfer in the photocatalytic surface reactions is required for the further improvement of photocatalytic efficiency.									26	2	0	0	5	0	27			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000350473500001

A truncated mutant of OEC23 (OEC23 Delta19) revealed that 19 residues of the N-terminus of OEC23 were necessary for Ca2+ retention but not for its proper interaction with OEC17, the extrinsic 17-kDa protein in photosystem II. The lost ability of OEC23 Delta19 to reconstitute the oxygen-evolving activity was partially restored by OEC17 binding, suggesting the involvement of OEC17 in Ca2+ retention in photosystem II.									31	2	0	0	30	0	32			0032-0781	1471-9053		WOS:000178848100020	12407205

In this work, galvanic displacement reaction was employed to prepare Pt<^>Ni-P/CNT catalysts using electrolessly-plated Ni-P/CNT. These catalysts were extensively characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Catalytic activities towards methanol oxidation and hydrogen evolution reactions were evaluated and benchmarked with a commercial Pt/C catalyst. Uniform dispersion of Pt on Ni-P particles led to high Pt utilization, and the electrochemical surface area of Pt<^>Ni-P/CNT with 12.1% Pt loading was found to be 126 m(2) g(-1), higher than that of a commercial Pt/C (77.9 m(2) g(-1)). The Tafel slopes for the Pt<^>Ni-P/ CNT catalysts were also found to be smaller than that of Pt/C indicating faster kinetics for hydrogen evolution reaction.

Possible candidates include Li-O2 batteries, which are the subject of rapidly increasing focus worldwide despite being in their infancy of understanding. This excitement owes to the high energy density of Li-O2 (up to 2-3 kWh kg-1), theoretically much higher compared to that of other rechargeable systems, and the open semi-fuel cell battery configuration that uses oxygen as the positive electrode material. To bring Li-O2 batteries closer to reality as viable energy storage devices, and to attain suitable power delivery, understanding of the underlying chemistry is essential. Several concepts have been proposed in the last year to account for the function and target future design of Li-O2 batteries and these are reviewed. An overview is given of the efforts to understand oxygen reduction/evolution and capacity limitations in these systems, and of electrode and electrolyte materials that are suitable for non-aqueous and hybrid (nonaqueous/aqueous) cells.									415	13	0	0	24	0	420			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000306311100007

With DMSO as solvent one high-potential reduction process leads to the formation of crystalline lithium peroxide (Li2O2) particles on the cathode surface area. SEM imaging of GDE cross-sections depicts that the (non-crystalline) product film formation at lower potentials during discharge with the TEGDME-based electrolyte results in a GDE pore clogging close to the O-2 inlet, so that gas transport is hindered and the discharge ends at an earlier point. The higher cycling stability with LiTFSI/TEGDME, however, is attributed to (i) the apparently complete recovery of the GDE active surface by recharge and (ii) different parasitic reactions resulting in the formation of side product particles rather than films.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000458709900015

Electronic state regulation plays a key role in promising higher electrocatalytic efficiencies. Herein, we highlighted a vibronic superexchange in double perovskite to synergistically optimize e(g) electron filling state and increase the formation of active species on the surface of catalysts. Vibronic superexchange of Ni3+-O-Mn3+ in La2NiMnO6 nanoparticles brings the optimal e(g) electron filling state of Mn and Ni ions toward unity. Moreover, a vibronic superexchange interaction of Ni3+-O-Mn3+ induces strong Jahn-Teller distortion of MnO6 and NiO6 octahedra, elongating metal-O bonds, which helps to form the active species of Mn/Ni hydroxide/oxide on the surface of catalysts. Surprisingly, La2NiMnO6 nano particles exhibit superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performance with higher current density and lower Tafel slope than its bulk counterpart. Our finding will be a promising pathway to develop advanced precious-metal-free catalysts.									93	5	0	0	5	0	93			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000444793400005	30132327

The simulations are compared against experimental data obtained in pulsed DC glow and radio-frequency discharges, operated with currents of about 40 mA and powers of 40 W, sustained under low gas pressures (< 600 Pa). The model is used to analyse the experimental trends associated with different pulsed configurations, namely different combinations of pulse duration and delay between pulses. The results validate the chemical module used in this work and reveal the importance of electronically excited states, in particular CO(a(3)Pi), to describe the evolution of CO2(X-1 Sigma(+)) and CO(X-1 Sigma(+)(g)) densities. In particular, it is shown that CO(a(3)Pi) can promote CO2 formation for increasing concentrations of O-2 due to bimolecular reactions such as CO(a(3)Pi) + O-2(X-3 Sigma(-)(g)) -> CO2(X-1 Sigma(+)) + O(P-3). At the same time, for low concentration of O-2 the CO2 dissociation fraction can be stimulated through CO(a(3)Pi) + CO2(X-1 Sigma(+)) -> 2CO(X-1 Sigma(+)(g)) + O(P-3). It is also found that the pulse parameters influence the concentration of O-2(X-3 Sigma(-)(g)) by favouring or limiting oxygen atomic recombination during the afterglow. Overall, this work addresses reaction mechanisms often overlooked in the CO2 plasma-based reforming literature, while confirming that electronically excited states play a key role in describing the dissociation fraction in CO2 plasmas operated under low pressure conditions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2212-9820	2212-9839		WOS:000707262000003

Herein, metallic nickel nanoparticles (NPs)/semiconductive nickel molybdate nanowires (NWs) (Ni/Ni2Mo3O8/CC) are constructed for overall water splitting. Experiment results show that the electrons can transfer from metallic Ni to semiconductive Ni2Mo3O8 through the NP/NW interfaces due to the heterojunction effect, endowing Ni2Mo3O8 and Ni with significantly enhanced activities for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the synergistic effect between metallic Ni and Ni2Mo3O8 not only increases the electrical conductivity of the Ni2Mo3O8 but also optimizes adsorption energies of hydrogen (Delta G(H*)) and water (Delta E-H2O), effectively improving the HER and OER activities in alkaline electrolyte. To drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline electrolyte, the Ni/Ni2Mo3O8/CC only needs 47 and 208 mV overpotentials for HER and OER, respectively, much lower than most of the reported non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts. Importantly, a two-electrode electrolyzer using Ni/Ni2Mo3O8/CC as bifunctional catalysts only needs a cell voltage of 1.51 V to get 10 mA cm(-2), superior to the benchmark Pt/C and IrO2 couple. Our findings provide a promising way for the design of heterojunction-based materials for water electrolysis. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

However, a complex interplay between the catalyst crystal structures and material morphologies as well as the surface reactions hampers a comprehensive understanding of the electrocatalytic OER at those materials. Here, we investigate the amount and reactivity of specific surface sites of a mesostructured cobalt oxide spinel powder by surface interrogation mode of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SI-SECM). The powder material was supplied in cavity microelectrodes and efficiently titrated with an Fe(II)-triethanolamine redox mediator generated at a gold microelectrode in an alkaline electrolyte. Thus, quantification of different surface sites was achieved, and their reactivity showed dependence on the cobalt oxidation state. Titration experiments after adjustable time delays with respect to the generation of the different surface sites indicated that these surface sites are active for the OER. Kinetic analysis revealed two pseudo-first-order decay constants that were related to fast and slow surface sites for the OER. Rate constants were determined for potentials where predominantly a mixed-valence Co-III/IV state might be present as the most active species. These results expand the great potential of the surface interrogation mode on studying the reaction kinetics of distinct surface sites for practically relevant powdered, nonprecious metal catalysts to address a highly relevant challenge in electrocatalysis.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000526331500017

The FeOOH surface is expected to act as an efficient electrochemical catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), because it is based on iron, an element of the fourth highest Clarke number. Experimentally, the OER activity of beta-FeOOH is known to be higher than that of gamma-FeOOH. However, the details of the OER mechanism and the surface reactivities of the FeOOH polymorphs have not yet been fully understood. We performed first-principles calculations of bulk and surfaces of beta-FeOOH and gamma-FeOOH using density functional theory, to investigate their electronic structures and catalytic activities. The calculations suggest that depending on the surface indices, several surfaces may be favored for catalytic activities.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000483701200035	31155617

Although the concentrations of the light elements are small, they nevertheless affect the Earth's core: its rate of cooling, the growth of the inner core, the dynamics of core convection, and the evolution of the geodynamo(3,4). Several light elements-including sulphur, oxygen, silicon, carbon and hydrogen-have been suggested(2), but the precise identity of the light elements in the Earth's core is still unclear. Oxygen has been proposed as a major light element in the core on the basis of cosmochemical arguments and chemical reactions during accretion(5,6). Its presence in the core has direct implications for Earth accretion conditions of oxidation state, pressure and temperature. Here we report new shockwave data in the Fe-S-O system that are directly applicable to the outer core. The data include both density and sound velocity measurements, which we compare with the observed density and velocity profiles of the liquid outer core. The results show that we can rule out oxygen as a major light element in the liquid outer core because adding oxygen into liquid iron would not reproduce simultaneously the observed density and sound velocity profiles of the outer core. An oxygen-depleted core would imply a more reduced environment during early Earth accretion.									81	13	2	0	9	0	91			0028-0836	1476-4687		WOS:000297285600047	22113693	
J	Randall, DJ; Brauner, C								Interactions between ion and gas transfer in freshwater teleost fish								COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR AND INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY				119	1			3	8		10.1016/S1095-6433(97)00412-1				JAN 1998	1998	Carbonic anhydrase and proton ATPase are co-distributed, being restricted to the apical regions of the gill epithelium of freshwater teleosts. Carbonic anhydrase supplies protons to the apical proton ATPase. Carbonic anhydrase is absent from the basal regions of the gill epithelium. Plasma flowing through the gills has no available carbonic anhydrase activity and plasma CO2/bicarbonate reactions are uncatalyzed. Thus, bicarbonate dehydration in plasma is negligible, and catalyzed bicarbonate dehydration occurs in erythrocytes in blood flowing through the gills. This results in tight coupling of carbon dioxide excretion to oxygen uptake and the evolution of hemoglobins with large Haldane effects but low buffering capacities, typical of many freshwater teleosts. Tight coupling of carbon dioxide and oxygen transfer in these fish also ensures that the Root shift does not impair oxygen uptake at the gills. Under these conditions, there is a selective advantage for hemoglobins with a Root shift. The presence of a Root shift augments oxygen transfer of the tissues in general and the eye and swimbladder in particular. COMP BIOCHEM PHYSIOL 119A;1:3-8, 1998. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.

However, its fundamental mechanism remains elusive and controversial. Here, the P25 TiO2 photocatalyst, which is optimized kinetically and thermodynamically under 36 x sun irradiation (1 x sun = 1 kW m(2)), exhibits ultrahigh co-catalyst-free H-2 evolution rate (235.8 lmol h(-1)), which is 1212 times of that in the conventional photocatalysis (PC) under 1 x sun irradiation as the benchmark. Moreover, hydrogen evolution has been identified to be exponentially correlated to reaction time (throughout the growing and stable temperature stages) and irradiance under Xe lamp and sunlight, respectively. These attractively superlinear characteristics of hydrogen evolution can be attributed to the uni-source photo-thermal synergism of accelerated carrier transfer rate by the high-density heat flux and broadened carrier transfer channel by the high-density photon flux. This work highlights the novel reaction characteristics and mechanisms for enhanced hydrogen evolution in CPC, thus provides new guidance to the performance improvement for conventional PC.

The effects of the support on the physicochemical properties of the Cu1:Ce3 catalysts were characterized by using SEM, TEM, N-2 adsorption-desorption, FTIR spectroscopy, XRD, XPS, CO-TPD, and NO-TPD techniques. The highest activity in the presence of oxygen was observed for the Cu1:Ce3/Al2O3 catalyst, and the NO conversion of 71.8% was obtained at 420 degrees C in the presence of 5% oxygen. The catalytic activity of the catalysts was significantly related to the synergistic interactions between surface oxygen vacancies and Cu+ species in the catalysts, as well as the electron transfer and metal/support interface. The high activity of the Al2O3 supported catalyst in the presence of oxygen is attributed to the presence of catalytically active centers on the support as well as on the surface of the supported crystallites. The NO conversion slightly increased after increasing the O-2 concentration from 2% to 5%, due to the adsorption of more O-2 on the surface, thus providing more adsorbed O, which reacted with adsorbed CO to form CO2 and provide oxygen vacancy for NO adsorption and dissociation. The adsorbed O can react with NO and form NO2, which quickly reacts with CO to form N-2 and CO2. A possible reaction mechanism was proposed for the reaction in the presence of excess oxygen.									10	1	0	0	1	0	10			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000509327200009

An activated carbon was obtained from olive stone by physical activation. A portion of this activated carbon was oxidized with ammonium peroxydisulfate in order to introduce different oxygen surface complexes. Subsequently, different portions of this oxidized activated carbon were heat treated in nitrogen flow at various temperatures to partially remove the oxygen surface complexes. In this way, activated carbons with different amounts of oxygen surface complexes were obtained, which were then used as supports for the tungsten oxide catalysts. Both the supports and the supported catalysts were pre-treated either in He, dry air or wet air flow at 623 K for 6 h. They were then characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, measurements of the pH of the point of zero charge, and activity in the decomposition reaction of isopropanol. Turnover frequencies for the formation of propene were obtained. According to these results, the oxygen surface complexes of the support have a major influence on the total acidity of the tungsten oxide supported catalysts. In some supported catalysts, W(VI) was reduced to W(V) during the decomposition reaction of isopropanot as a consequence of the hydrogen evolution. The results indicate that oxygen surface complexes of the support may play an important role in this reduction process, which was inhibited when the support had high surface oxygen content.

However, LLOs generally suffer from high first cycle irreversible capacity (IRC) loss, poor rate capability, and a substantial voltage decay over prolonged cycling. These major challenges are closely dependent on the surface structure and chemistry of LLO cathodes and, thus, different surfaces induce different irreversible reactions resulting in various levels of battery performance. This review presents the current understanding, as well as recent highlights, on the roles and fundamentals of surface structure in LLO cathodes, from a materials science perspective, concerning surface structural disorder in pristine LLO (antisites, composition segregation and crystallographic facets), the roles of surface structures on redox processes (oxygen evolution, cation activation and reversible anion redox reactions), surface structural evolution during the first cycle and long-term electrochemical operation, and surface modification strategies to stabilize the surface structure and to mitigate the performance degradation of LLOs. However, some fundamental problems remain yet ambiguous, especially with regard to characterization and understanding of the surface structure and chemistry in relation to synthesis conditions and composition, and charge transfer and ionic transport of the interfacial processes within LLOs. In order to exploit the potential of LLO cathodes, a clear understanding of these fundamental questions are essential to optimize the synthesis parameters and material properties.									50	7	0	0	2	0	52			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000390636100069

Here, we report an electrochemical method for the synthesis of core-shell nanoparticles directly on electrodes, free of surfactants. By implementation of selective electrodeposition on gold cores, 1(st)-row transition metal shells were constructed with facile and precise thickness control. This type of metal-on-metal core-shell synthesis by purely electrochemical means is the first of its kind. The applicability of the nanoparticle decorated electrodes was demonstrated by alkaline oxygen evolution catalysis, during which the Au-Ni example displayed stable catalysis with low overpotential.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000700588900001	34777775

The isotopic compositions of B39 and two other Al2O3 grains previously reported from the Orgueil and Murchison meteorites show that these grains formed directly from the ejecta of low-mass AGB stars with C/O < 1. A simple theoretical analysis is presented showing that the oxygen systematics of the grains are a natural consequence of main-sequence evolution followed by first dredge-up. Al-26 is the result of third dredge-up. Circumstellar Al2O3 grains provide very precise isotopic data for stellar ejecta that complement spectroscopic observations of oxygen-rich stars. Isotopic differences indicate that the Al2O3 grains come from separate stars of different mass and initial oxygen composition that originated in molecular clouds different from the one in which the solar system formed.									106	1	0	0	0	0	107			0004-637X			WOS:A1994NW51400021

Chemical degradation of the Nafion (R) membrane is described through a combination of OH radical formation via Fenton's reaction and a radical mechanism of side chain decomposition. At the electrodes, the model is coupled to a description of the hydrogen oxidation reaction, the oxygen reduction reaction, and the hydrogen peroxide formation reaction at the anodic side. We establish a first feedback between the evolution of structural properties of the membrane and its transport parameters (i.e., proton conductivity) for a fully humidified fuel cell. We assess the influence of the chemical membrane degradation on the cell performance and on macroscopic properties of the membrane (i.e., sulfonate site concentration).

As a possible alternative method, electrochemical treatment was tested using solutions containing a mixture of phenol and formaldehyde simulating an industrial effluent. The anode used was a dimensionally stable anode (DSAA (R)) of nominal composition Ti/Ru0.3Ti0.7O2, and the solution composition during the degradation process was analyzed by liquid chromatography and the removal of total organic carbon. From cyclic voltammetry, it is observed that for formaldehyde, a small offset of the beginning of the oxygen evolution reaction occurs, but for phenol, the reaction is inhibited and the current density decreases. From the electrochemical degradations, it was determined that 40 mA cm(-2) is the most efficient current density and the comparison of different supporting electrolytes (Na2SO4, NaNO3, and NaCl) indicated a higher removal of total organic carbon in NaCl medium.									31	2	0	0	6	2	33			0049-6979			WOS:000308875600022

Due to controversies concerning the stoichiometry of this protein [Miyao, M., Bi Murata, N. (1989) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 977, 315-321, versus Xu, Q., & Bricker, T. M. (1992) J. Biol. Chern. 267, 25816-25821] we have examined the rebinding of this protein to PS II membrane preparations which contain four, two, or zero manganese per photosystem II reaction center. After rebinding, immunoquantification of the 33 kDa extrinsic protein demonstrated that each of these photosystem II membrane preparations strongly bound two copies of the 33 kDa extrinsic protein per photosystem II reaction center. The first and second stoichiometric binding constants (K-a1 and K-a2) for the binding of the 33 kDa protein to PS II centers containing four manganese were 0.42 and 0.67 nM(-1), respectively. Disruption of the manganese cluster either by removal of the chloride-sensitive manganese or extraction of the manganese cluster by alkaline Tris led to a 5-6-fold decrease in K-a1 and about a 3-fold decrease in K-a2 In all cases the binding of the two copies of the 33 kDa extrinsic protein exhibited positive cooperativity with Hill coefficients ranging from 1.6 to 2.2. These findings demonstrate that damage to the manganese cluster alters the binding affinity of the 33 kDa extrinsic protein to photosystem II but does not alter the molecularity of the binding reaction.									45	0	0	0	41	0	45			0006-2960			WOS:A1996UE61200033	8605205

However, all of the systems perform with no consideration of the surface wettability of GDY. Herein, for the first time, the fabrication of superhydrophilic GDY electrode via air-plasma for oxygen evolution is described. As a representative catalyst, ultrathin CoAl-LDH (CO32-) nanosheets have been successfully assembled onto the superhydrophilic GDY electrostatically. The resulting superhydrophilic CoAl-LDH/GDY electrode exhibites superior activity with an overpotential of approximate to 258 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2). The turnover frequency (TOF) is calculated to be approximate to 0.60 s(-1) at eta = 300 mV, which is the best record in both CoAl-based and GDY-based layered double hydroxides (LDH) electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that superhydrophilic GDY has stronger interactions with catalysts and attracts H2O molecules around catalysts, thus facilitating interfacial mass/electron transportation. Further, the fabrication is capable of improving the photoelectrochemical oxygen evolution activity remarkably.

Herein, we report a facile approach to generate uniformly dispersed Pt sites with outstanding HER performance via a photochemical reduction method using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) molecules as the key additive to significantly simplify the synthesis and enhance the catalytic performance. The as-prepared catalyst displays remarkable kinetic activities (20 times higher current density than the commercially available Pt/C) with excellent stability (76.3 % of its initial activity after 5000 cycles) for HER. EXAFS measurements and DFT calculations demonstrate a synergetic effect, where the PVP ligands and the support together modulate the electronic structure of the Pt atoms, which optimize the hydrogen adsorption energy, resulting in a considerably improved HER activity.									40	3	0	0	2	0	40			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000543763500001	32436325

Herein, highly porous carbon nanocubes with a specific surface area up to 1600 m(2) g(-1) are synthesized and utilized to tightly anchor Ru nanoparticles for using as the oxygen-cathode catalyst in LOBs, achieving a low charge/discharge potential gap of only 0.75 V, a high total discharge capacity of 17,632 mA h g(-1), and a superb cycling performance of 550 cycles at 1000 mA g(-1). Comprehensive ex situ and operando characterizations unravel that the outstanding LOB performance is ascribed to the highly porous catalyst structure embedding rich active sites that synergistically function in reducing overpotentials, suppressing parasitic reactions, accommodating reaction products, and promoting mass and charge transportation.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000667982100053	34102061

Here we report a hybrid nanomaterial comprising of one-dimensional ultrathin platinum nanowires grown on two-dimensional single-layered nickel hydroxide. Judicious surface chemistry to generate the fully exfoliated nickel hydroxide single layers is explored to be the key for controllable growth of ultrathin platinum nanowires with diameters of about 1.8 nm. Impressively, this hybrid nanomaterial exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline solution, which outperforms currently reported catalysts, and the obviously improved catalytic stability. We believe that this work may lead towards the development of single-layered metal hydroxide-based hybrid materials for applications in catalysis and energy conversion.									735	51	1	0	53	0	744			2041-1723			WOS:000352633900014	25728293

The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), as the cornerstone of exploring the mechanism of water electrolysis, has attracted extensive interest in the past decades. Carbon-based materials with significant merits such as abundance, low cost, high conductivity, and tunable molecular structures, are considered as promising candidates for replacing the commercial noble metal electrocatalysts. To date, activity origins of these carbon-based electrocatalysts are mainly attributed to the dopants (e.g., N, B, P or S), whereas the contribution of intrinsic/induced carbon defects has recently been a hot research topic. In this Review, besides the development of heteroatoms doping strategies, the latest studies on defective carbon-based materials for HER electrocatalysis are summarized, especially for various approaches to prepare defective carbons and the detailed introduction regarding the defect catalysis mechanism. Finally, an outlook into the development of future defective carbon-based HER electrocatalysts is presented.									51	1	0	0	8	0	52			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000436408800004	29726095

High conductivity, highly porous structure and high concentration of dopants are essential for efficient metal-free carbon-based electrocatalysts. Herein, a facile method was utilized to fabricate nitrogen-rich holey graphene monoliths (Nr-HGM) from cheap molecules and ammonium sulfate with the nitrogen content close to the upper limit of nitrogen-doped carbons.

Herein, ultrafine CoOx was selectively immobilized on the surface of BiVO4/WO3 photoanode by using the photogenerated holes to in-situ oxidize Co4O4 cubane. The composited photoanode (CoOx/BiVO4/WO3) displayed an enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation performance, with a photocurrent density of 2.3 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V-RHE under the simulated sunlight irradiation, which was 2 times higher than that of bare BiVO4/WO3. The characterization results for the morphological, optical and electrochemical properties of the photoelectrodes revealed that, the enhanced PEC performances could be attributed to the improved charge carrier separation/transport behaviors and the promoted water oxidation kinetics when the photoelectrodes were loaded with CoOx.

The bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution response (HER) with high catalytic performance and steadiness in the equal electrolyte are extra treasured and meaningful. Herein, a unique three-dimensional (3D) structure electrocatalyst for NiCo2S4 growing on the flower-like NiFeP was designed and synthesized in this study. The results show that the flower-like NiCo2S4/NiFeP/NF composite electrocatalyst has large specific surface area, appropriate electrical conductivity, and greater lively websites uncovered in the three-dimensional structure, and affords extraordinary electrocatalytic overall performance for the ordinary water splitting. In alkaline solution, the OER and HER overpotentials of NiCo2S4/NiFeP/NF only need 293 mV and 205 mV overpotential to provide the current densities of 100 mA/cm(2) and 50 mA/cm(2), respectively. This high electrocatalytic activity exceeds the catalytic activity of most nickel-iron based electrocatalysts for OER and HER process. Accordingly, the optimized NiCo2S4/NiFeP/NF sample has higher stability (24 h) at 1.560 and 10 mA/cm(2), which extensively speeds up the overall water splitting process. In view of the above performance, this work offers a fine approach for the further improvement of low fee and excessive effectivity electrocatalyst.

Acid-base properties depend on the covalent/ionic character of the metal-oxygen bonds and are involved in some steps of the oxidation reactions, such as the activation of the C-H hydrocarbon bonds, the step associated with the evolution of alkoxide species and the desorption/overoxidation of the partial oxidation products. Thus they participate with the cation redox properties in determining the selective/unselective catalyst behavior.					5th European Workshop Meeting on Selective Oxidation by Heterogeneous Catalysis5th European Workshop Meeting on Selective Oxidation by Heterogeneous Catalysis	NOV 06-07, 1995NOV 06-07, 1995		BERLIN, GERMANYBERLIN, GERMANY	112	3	0	0	3	1	114			0920-5861			WOS:A1996WD79700017

While methodology for evaluating reaction thermodynamics is established, simulation techniques for the corresponding kinetics is still a major challenge owing to a lack of potential control, finite cell size effects, or computational expense. In this work, we develop a model that allows for computing electrochemical activation energies from just a handful of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The sole input into the model are the atom-centered forces obtained from DFT calculations performed on a homogeneous grid composed of varying field strengths. We show that the activation energies as a function of the potential obtained from our model are consistent for different supercell sizes and proton concentrations for a range of electrochemical reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1948-7185			WOS:000819347600001	35713626

M.; Guerra-Balcazar, Minerva; Alvarez-Contreras, Lorena; Arjona, Noe								Defected NiFe layered double hydroxides on N-doped carbon nanotubes as efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for rechargeable zinc-air batteries								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				601						154253	10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.154253				NOV 1 2022	2022	Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are highly active materials for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER); however, they have low activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The surface modification by the defects engineering is a great strategy to boost their bifunctionality for rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZABs). In this work, NiFe LDHs were synthesized varying the composition (Ni:Fe compositions of 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1), and BET surface areas of 262.3, 165.9 and 79.5 m2 g-1 were found. Despite the differences in BET surface areas, the NiFe LDH 3:1 presented higher activity for the OER, and thus, oxygen vacancies (Ov)-type surface defects were introduced to this LDH. This surface engineering decreased the oxygen atomic percentage from 75.25 to 57.4 %, and as result, the resistance to charge transfer drastically decreased due to electronic modifications, which can be rationalized in terms of the theoretical density of states obtained by density functional theory for a model system including oxygen vacancies. The combination between defected NiFe LDH with N-doped carbon nanotubes allowed to obtain the same current density for ORR than benchmarked Pt/C with a potential difference of 95 mV, and better activity for OER (1.46 V @ 10 mA cm-2). In the ZAB, a cell voltage of 1.44 V was achieved with a power density close to 36 mW cm-2, being this power similar to that of Pt/C.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000849972800004

The X-ray absorption spectra at both Co K-edge and L-edge reveals the coordination environment and valence state of the Co single atom, and density functional theory calculations confirm that the active sites are S atoms bonding with Co single atoms.

In this work, two-dimensional (2D) nitrogen-doped leaf-like carbon matrix arrays functionalized with multi-valence-state transition metal (cobalt) hybrids were successfully prepared by in situ calcination of the corresponding bimetallic leaf-like zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-L) in an inert atmosphere. The 2D morphology of the matrix along with the particle size and surface valence state of the anchored particles has been successfully controlled via precisely adjusting the Co2+/(Zn2+ + Co2+) ratio in the bimetallic ZIF-L precursor. Electrochemical measurements show that the kinetics of and stability towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are highly dependent on the particle size as well as the valence states. It was found that the particles with sizes less than 60 nm exhibit mixed Co-0/Co2+ valence states, and therefore demonstrate bi-functional electrocatalytic performance. The theoretical simulations revealed that the bi-functional electrocatalytic activity should be attributed to the synergetic effect of mixed Co-0/Co2+ and electronic coupling in the hybrids, which are of benefit to the catalytic kinetics and dynamics. High HER and OER activities of the hybrids have been verified, in which overpotentials of 171 and 280 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER and OER, respectively, were achieved. The obtained correlation between non-noble-metal-based carbon composites and HER/OER activities may be exploited as a rational guideline in the design and engineering of electrocatalysts.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			2398-4902			WOS:000472980200011

Also there are emerging requirements to develop OER electrocatalysts under various pH conditions in order to couple with different reduction reactions. Herein, we studied the effect of pH on the electroactivation of IrNi alloy nanoparticles supported on carbon (IrNi/C) and evaluated the electrocatalytic activities of the activated IrNiOx/C for water oxidation under neutral conditions. In addition, their electronic structures and atomic arrangement were analyzed byin situ/operandoX-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and identical location transmission electron microscopy techniques, showing the reconstruction of the metal elements during electroactivation due to their different stabilities depending on the electrolyte pH. IrNiOx/C activated under neutral pH conditions showed a mildly oxidized thin IrO(x)shell. Meanwhile, IrNiOx/C activated in acidic and alkaline electrolytes showed Ni-leached IrO(x)and Ni-rich IrNiO(x)surfaces, respectively. Particularly, the surface of IrNiOx/C activated under alkaline conditions shows IrO(x)with a high d-band hole and NiO(x)with a high oxidation state leading to excellent OER catalytic activity in neutral media (eta= 384 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) whereas much lower OER activity was reported under alkaline or acid conditions. Our results, which showed that electrochemically activated catalysts under different pH conditions exhibit a unique electronic structure by modifying the initial alloy catalyst, can be applied for the design of catalysts suitable for various electrochemical reactions.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000549588900052	32638785

The introduction of RB5 in anode chamber increased the voltage generation in the system since degradation of RB5 might produce electrons which also would transfer through external circuit to the cathode chamber. The removal efficiency of RB5 with open and closed circuit was 8.5% and 13.6%, respectively and removal efficiency for open circuit was low due to the fact that recombination of electron-hole pairs might happen in anode chamber since without connection to the cathode, electron cannot be transferred. The degradation of RB5 in cathode chamber with absence of oxygen showed that electrons from anode chamber was accepted by dye molecules to break its azo bond. The presence of oxygen in cathode chamber would improve the oxygen reduction rate which occurred at Platinum-loaded carbon (Pt/C) cathode electrode. The V-oc, J(sc) and P-max for different condition of ultrapure water at cathode chamber also affected their fill factor. The transportation of protons to cathode chamber through Nafion membrane could decrease the pH of ultrapure water in cathode chamber and undergo hydrogen evolution reaction in the absence of oxygen which then increased degradation rate of RB5 as well as its electricity generation.

The synthesized RGO-Co3O4 was calcined at a temperature from 300 degrees C to 500 degrees C to examine the effect of calcination on its HER activity. The 500 degrees C-calcined 3D-crumpled RGO-Co3O4 exhibited the highest photocurrent density under UV illumination due to the improved interfacial hole transfer and suppressed electron recombination. In addition, it also showed excellent durability even after 1000 cycles in acidic solution. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This calls for rational screening of targeted ORR/OER components and precise control of their atomic and electronic structures to produce synergistic effects. Here, we report a Mn-doped RuO2 (Mn-RuO2) bimetallic oxide with atomic-scale dispersion of Mn atoms into the RuO2 lattice, which exhibits remarkable activity and super durability for both the ORR and OER, with a very low potential difference (Delta E) of 0.64 V between the half-wave potential of ORR (E-1/2) and the OER potential at 10 mA cm(-2) (E-j10) and a negligible decay of E-1/2 and E-j10 after 250 000 and 30 000 CV cycles for ORR and OER, respectively. Moreover, Zn-air batteries using the Mn-RuO2 catalysts exhibit a high power density of 181 mW cm(-2), low charge/discharge voltage gaps of 0.69/0.96/1.38 V, and ultralong lifespans of 15 000/2800/1800 cycles (corresponding to 2500/467/300 h operation time) at a current density of 10/50/100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Theoretical calculations reveal that the excellent performances of Mn-RuO2 is mainly due to the precise optimization of valence state and d-band center for appropriate adsorption energy of the oxygenated intermediates.									18	1	0	0	1	0	19			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000763125900031	35104401

The electrolyte is used as a mixture of sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid to stabilize the vanadium ion. Antimony has quasi-reversible reactions prior to the electrochemical reactions of vanadium ion pairs. In general, as shown by the results of scanning electron microscopy, metallic antimony is decorated on the surface of graphite felt during charge-discharge cycles. The results of full-window cyclic voltammetry indicate an increase in the cyclic stability of samples containing antimony, especially at a concentration of 7.5 mM. This is due to the electrocatalytic properties of antimony and the facilitation of vanadium electrochemical reactions. Ease of reactions is also closely related to the improvement of vanadium ion diffusion coefficients in samples containing antimony. The reduction peak of V3+ to V2+ in the bare sample practically disappears after a few cycles, which is due to the superiority of hydrogen gas evolution. Linear sweep voltammograms confirm the effectiveness of antimony in shifting the potential position of hydrogen and oxygen evolution. Wettability and contact angle tests show more water adsorption by antimony-decorated graphite felts compared to the bare one which has a direct effect on improving the performance of the electrodes. Although antimony is added to anolyte in VRFB and has the most beneficial effect on the negative electrode, antimony cross-contamination does not have a bad effect on positive electrode performance and even it also stabilizes the reduction-oxidation currents ratio on positive electrode based on cyclic voltammetry results. In general, the presence of antimony increases all three types of coulombic, voltage, and energy efficiency in VRFB.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000767865600003

The evolution of the pigment concentration, the changes in color, and the accumulation of a volatile compound (beta-ionone) were monitored during storage. The kinetics of degradation were mathematically modeled to compare the effects of lighting conditions and oxygen partial pressures. Lighting was also a critical variable in the presence of a low oxygen partial pressure (5 kPa), and in these conditions, the beta-carotene degraded completely during storage, even if more slowly than at 20 kPa of O-2. The pigment degradation was correlated to illuminance and UVA irradiance values, but the different decay rates of the fluorescent lamps were explained by the differences in the blue region of the energy emission spectra. A halogen lamp gave minor negative effects on beta-carotene degradation.									20	0	0	0	12	0	21			0021-8561	1520-5118		WOS:000247366500048	17539657

In this work, we synthesized an efficient Ce-doped NiFe-layered double hydroxide (LDH) electrocatalyst directly on a nickel foam (NF) substrate at room temperature using an electrodeposition technique. A well-connected nanosheet array forming a three-dimensional (3D) network on the substrate provided a large electrochemical surface area with abundant catalytically active sites. Ce doping in the NiFe-LDH electrocatalyst was vital to enhancing its catalytic performance for the OER and HER. The optimized Ce-doped NiFe-LDH required overpotentials of 175 and 147 mV for the OER and HER, respectively, to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. The Ce-doped electrocatalyst outperformed bare NiFe-LDH, which required overpotentials of 197 and 175 mV for the OER and HER, respectively. However, when Ce-doped NiFe-LDH was used as a bifunctional catalyst for full water splitting, it needed only 1.59 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and exhibited excellent stability over 40 hours at 20 mA cm(-2). The enhanced electrochemical performance of Ce-doped NiFe-LDH was ascribed primarily to its unique 3D network, which increased the electrochemical surface area, and to the number of active sites created with Ce doping. The route used in the present study to enhance the catalytic activity of NiFe-LDH can be used to develop various electrocatalysts for water splitting and other catalytic applications.									58	2	0	0	2	0	58			2398-4902			WOS:000503876500025

Herein, by coupling liquid-exfoliated and mildly oxidized black phosphorus nanosheets (BP-NSs) with wet-chemically synthesized 2D nickel Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets (NH-NSs), 2D/2D heterostructured nanosheets (BNHNSs) are rationally constructed with a favorable transition of electron structure and desired intermediate adsorptions for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis. When used as an OER catalyst, to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the overpotential of 2D/2D BNHNSs is only 297 mV, corresponding to a considerable decrease of 22% and 34% compared with the individual 2D NH-NSs and 2D BP-NSs, respectively. The structural tracking at the initial reconstruction stage via time-dependent Raman spectra confirms that the phosphorus oxidization into the P-OH and the phase transformation into oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) significantly promote the electron transfer and electrocatalytic efficiency and thus endow the 2D/2D BNHNSs with much enhanced OER catalytic activity. This work offers new insights on the electron structure modulation of 2D-based heterostructures and opens new avenues for regulating the adsorption of emerging phosphorene-based materials for electrocatalysis.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000803019900001

Herein, we report the interesting observations on this phenomenon in electrocatalytic systems of the cobalt tungstate (CoWO4) nanostructures and demonstrate the in situ oxidation and self-activation-induced amorphous reactive state determine their OER performances. The CoWO4 nanoflakes (NFs) with poor crystallinity are easily oxidized to composite-type CoOx/WOx and exhibit the best OER performance. To obtain a catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the CoWO4 NFs afford an overpotential as low as 436 my in an alkaline medium, which compare favorably to most previously reported Co-containing OER elecrocatalysts; Whereas the catalytic current density of the crystalline CoWO4 nanorods (NRs) and CoWO4 nanocuboids (NCs) cannot reach 10 mA cm(-2) even at the high potential of 1.90 V (vs. RHE). The in-depth mechanistic investigations demonstrate the excellent electrochemical OER behaviors of CoWO4 NFs are mainly originated from the in situ oxidation induced local structure change and amorphization.

Herein, a defectenriched and pyridinic-N (PN) dominated bifunctional electrocatalyst with novel core-shell architecture (DN-CP@G) is successfully fabricated by in situ exfoliating graphene from carbon paper followed by high temperature ammonia treatment. Benefitting from its strongly coupled core-shell structure, abundant defective sites and high-content PN dopants, the DN-CP@G displays an excellent electrocatalytic (ORR and OER) activity and stability in alkaline media, which are comparable to commercial Pt/C and Ir/C catalysts. The experiment, and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the electrocatalytic activities of carbon materials strongly depend on their defective sites and PN dopants. By directly using DN-CP@G as a self-standing electrode, the assembled zinc-air battery demonstrates a high discharge performance and outstanding long-term cycle stability with at least 250 cycles, which is much superior to the mixed Pt/C and Ir/C electrodes. Remarkably, the DNCP@G based all-solid-state battery also reveals a good discharge and cycle performance. A facile and cost-efficient approach to prepare highly effective bifunctional self-standing electrode is provided by in situ generation of active sites on carbon support for metal-air batteries.									104	8	0	0	4	0	104			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000435724600025

This is in contrast to the situation met in aqueous electrolytes, where the reactions occur at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Thus, modified concepts are required to describe the reaction rates of such reactions on mixed conducting oxides. Here, it is discussed how overpotential and gas partial pressure affect reaction rates. A rate equation is suggested that also includes defects and the meaning of the empirical reaction orders is illustrated. Three experiments are presented that emphasize different aspects required for a mechanistic understanding of such reactions: A simultaneous variation of overpotential and partial pressure reveals the role of defects in oxygen evolution on (La,Sr)FeO3-delta electrodes. Bias dependent impedance measurements with an analysis of the chemical capacitance gives information on the concentration of minority defects in Sr(Ti,Fe)O3-delta. Modification of (La,Sr)CoO3-delta thin film surfaces by Sr or Co and impedance measurements in the pulsed laser deposition chamber help understanding catalytically active sites.

CeO2 with different morphologies (i.e. rod, particle, and cube) were prepared by a hydrothermal method and characterized by the X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Among the three CeO2 morphologies, CeO2 rod catalyst had the most amount of oxygen vacancy. All the catalysts were tested for methanol oxidation in plasma, and the results showed that CeO2 rod catalyst exhibited the highest methanol conversion (94.1%), CO2 selectivity (90.1%) and ozone suppression. In situ Raman spectroscopy experiments proved that the performance of ozone decomposition was related to the amount of oxygen vacancy in CeO2. Surface oxygen vacancies in CeO2 rod catalyst acted as active sites for ozone decomposition, resulting in more reactive oxygen species that could effectively oxidize methanol and increase CO2 selectivity in the plasma-catalytic system. Finally, the evolution of adsorbed intermediate species and some key steps of methanol oxidation were discussed based on the results of plasma-catalytic in situ Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) experiments.									35	5	1	0	10	0	39			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000463344800024

Herein, we reported a magnetic field-enhanced, bifunctional Ni3Fe/wood carbon electrode (Ni3Fe-CW) for efficient overall water splitting. Wood with numerous porous channels allows high loading of metal ions via the hydrothermal method, while the following high-temperature calcination leads to well-dispersed and uniform Ni3Fe nanoparticles, which are both electrocatalytically and magnetically active. As a result, the Ni3Fe-CW shows low overpotentials of 237 mV and 76 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for both oxygen and hydrogen evolutions under magnetic field (300 mT by a permanent magnet). Density functional theory calcu-lations demonstrate that the Ni3Fe exhibits strong spin polarization under magnetic field with accelerated electron transfer, leading to lower reaction energy barrier and enhanced catalytic activities. Importantly, the electrolytic cell constructed by the bifunctional Ni3Fe-CWs as both cathode and anode displays a low cell voltage of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm(-2) with an appropriate stability over 50 h (with a passive magnet). Considering the ubiquitous application of magnetic Fe, Co, Ni in catalytic reactions and the passive-radiation role of magnet, our strategy is promising for many energy conversion technologies toward highly efficient catalysis.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000783213700003

Owing to their tunable structural properties, these materials are found to be useful for gas storage and separation technologies, as well as for catalytic applications. A cost-effective zinc-based MOF ([Zn(bpcda)(bdc)](n)) is prepared by using N,N-bis(pyridin-4-ylmethylene)cyclohexane-1,4-diamine [N,N-bis(pyridin-4-ylmethylene)cyclohexane-1,4-diamine] and benzenedicarboxylic acid (bdc) linkers. This new material exhibits remarkable photoelectrochemical (PEC) catalytic activity in water splitting for the evolution of oxygen. Notably, this non-noble metal-based MOF, without requiring immobilization on other supports or containing metal particles, produced a highest photocurrent density of 31 mu A cm(-2) at 0.9V, with appreciable stability and negligible photocorrosion. Advantageously for the oxygen evolution process, no external reagents or sacrificial agents are required in the aqueous electrolyte solution.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000424762600005	29250932

Here we report for the first time an in situ electrochemical process to synthesize Pt-MoO3-x nanoflakes (NFs) overgrown on commercial bulk MoS2 by employing a facile and simple electrochemical method without using any expensive precious metal salts. The overgrowth of Pt-MoO3-x NFs on the bulk MoS2 surface is conducted by applying electrical energy to the bulkMoS(2) and using Pt counter electrode dissolution in an acidic solution. In spite of their 10 times lower Pt loadings compared to commercial Pt black (Alfa Aesar), the synthesized Pt-MoO3-x NFs demonstrate excellent catalytic performance with a Ptmass activity of 2.83 A/mg(Pt) at the overpotential of 100 mV for electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), an approximately 4 times higher value than the value of 0.76 A/mg(Pt) at the overpotential of 100 mVfor commercial Pt black. We hypothesize that the outstanding HER characteristics of Pt-MoO3-x NFs are related to the existence and increase of Pt-MoO3 interfacial sites and oxygen vacancy sites such as Mo5+ in the Pt-MoO3-x NF structures. In addition, our density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that Pt and O sites at Pt and MoO3 interfaces and O sites at defective MoO3-x in the Pt-MoO3-x NFs contribute to accelerate the HER.

Herein, we report a 3D porous sponge-like Ni material, prepared by a facile hydrothermal method and consisting of cross-linked micro/nanofibers, as an integrated binder-free OER electrocatalyst. To further enhance the electrocatalytic performance, an N-doping strategy is applied to obtain N-doped sponge Ni (N-SN) for the first time, via NH3 annealing. Due to the combination of the unique conductive sponge structure and N doping, the as-obtained N-SN material shows improved conductivity and a higher number of active sites, resulting in enhanced OER performance and excellent stability. Remarkably, N-SN exhibits a low overpotential of 365mV at 100mAcm(-2) and an extremely small Tafel slope of 33mVdec(-1), as well as superior long-term stability, outperforming unmodified sponge Ni. Importantly, the combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and near-edge X-ray adsorption fine structure analyses shows that -NiOOH is the surface-active phase for OER. Therefore, the combination of conductive sponge structure and N-doping modification opens a new avenue for fabricating new types of high-performance electrodes with application in electrochemical energy conversion devices.									65	5	0	0	5	0	65			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000460782200002	34137962

In general, irreversible lattice oxygen loss and associated structural distortion are considered to be a threat to the practical application of the ARRs process. Herein, the anionic redox behavior in an O3-type layered NaMg0.67Ru0.33O2 (Ru5+) cathode has been systematically investigated by various in/ex situ spectroscopic characterization techniques. Unexpectedly, compared to the complex phase transitions (O3/O ' 3/P3) and sluggish dynamic processes observed within ARR-free O3-type NaMg0.5Ru0.5O2 (Ru4+), the distorted structure induced by initial oxygen loss within the NaMg0.67Ru0.33O2 (Ru5+) cathode reveals a simple phase transition (O3/O ' 3) and better structural stability during cycling. This anomaly triggers us to make a fair assessment of the distorted structure induced by loss of lattice oxygen. Furthermore, based on the abnormal phenomenon referred to above, to restrain redundant oxygen loss, appropriate lattice oxygen loss can be rationally considered as a structural modification method for moderate phase transition processes during long-term cycling.									12	2	0	0	1	0	12			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000489686400034

On freshly polished titanium, spontaneous deposition of platinum takes place through a displacement reaction between Ti(O) and dissolved Pt(TV). At very short times of deposition, fine dispersions of platinum crystals were formed on titanium. At longer deposition times, the size of the platinum crystals increases whereas their number decreases due to coalescence and agglomeration processes. On titanium covered by a thin oxide film, the rate of deposition is very low and photocatalytic deposition of Pt on the TiO2 surface occurs simultaneously with the displacement reaction. The hydrogen evolution reaction (her) was used as a probe reaction for testing both the catalytic activity and deposition conditions. There is evidence that the catalytic activity of the Pt crystals for the her increases with decreasing crystal size. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

A total of 36 samples were collected from surface water and groundwater in the study area where water pollution risk is high due to the fertilizer use for farmland and the waste drainage from a nearby silicon industry site. The results show that the surface water bodies have been badly polluted and are characterized by low pH values (minimum 2.85) and high concentrations of chemical compounds such as Cl-, Na+, NH4-N, NO3-N and TDS. Groundwater has also been polluted with the similar specific contaminates, as both surface water and groundwater may have similar contamination sources, and groundwater is recharged from the precipitation infiltration and surface water leakage as indicated by oxygen-18 and deuterium compositions due to the thin unsaturated zone in the area. The acidification and the intrusion of contamination further lead to hydrogeo-chemical reactions and changed hydrochemical type of groundwater from Ca-Mg-HCO3 to Ca-Mg-Na-Cl. The data evaluation methods and results of this study could be useful to the water sustainable usage management in this area and other environmental-vulnerable areas.									17	0	0	0	6	0	17			1866-6280	1866-6299		WOS:000370241400006

The architectures were mainly characterized by using a series of characterization techniques, demonstrating the enlarged electrochemically active surface area of 28.27 m(2)g(-1), much enhanced mass activity and specific activity for oxygen reduction reaction (279.14 mAmg(Pt)(-1) and 0.89 mAcm(-2)) and glycerol oxidation reaction (1422.56 mAmg(Pt)(-1), 4.58 mAcm(-2)) comparable with commercial Pt black, along with the superior durability.

However, the interfacial reaction dynamic behaviors, especially the quantitative analysis, are still far from deep understanding. Using the method of laser confocal microscopy combined with differential interference contrast microscopy (LCM-DIM), we monitored the Li-O-2 interfacial reaction and in situ traced the Li2O2 migration processes promoted by the solution catalyst. Different dynamic behaviors exist when regulating the concentration of the redox mediator. Quantitative analysis of the discharged Li2O2 particles shows high mobility at the early discharge stage and decayed motion in the subsequent process, indicating the solution-mediated pathway participating Li2O2 formation in the low-concentration redox mediator addition, while particles/aggregates confined into the amorphous film demonstrate simultaneous solution and surface route-mediated pathway participation in the high-concentration case. These distinctive observations of Li2O2 formation and decomposition processes present the advantage of LCM-DIM to fundamentally understand the dynamic evolution in Li-O-2 batteries.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000757873100001	35068138

However, economical earth-abundant catalysts based on first-row transition-metal oxides suffer from low electrochemical stability, which is difficult to improve without compromising their activity. Here, using density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that noble-metal supports lead to bifunctional enhancement of both the stability and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of metal (oxy-hydro) oxide nanoislands. We observe a significant stabilization of supported nanoislands beyond the intrinsic stability limits of bulk phases, which originates from a favorable lattice mismatch and reductive charge transfer from oxophilic supports. We discover that interfacial active sites (located between the nanoisland and the support) reinforce the binding strength of reaction intermediates, hence boosting ORR activity. Considering that both stability and activity lead to discovery of CoOOH vertical bar Pt, NiOOH vertical bar Ag, and FeO2 vertical bar Ag as viable systems for alkaline ORR, we then use a multivariant linear regression method to identify elementary descriptors for efficient screening of promising cost-effective nanoisland vertical bar support catalysts.									18	1	0	0	1	0	18			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000456351100030	30582334

However, it remains a challenge to establish a competent solar to fuel conversion system. We present here the first example of a nanoscale nanoporous Pd-derived benchmark material used as a highly stable and low overpotential electrocatalyst for water oxidation. The Pd electrocatalyst executes water oxidation at an onset potential of just 1.43 V vs. RHE; = 200 mV. The catalyst also exhibits remarkable performance for OER, reaching a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.47 V ( = 240 mV), and with a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) achieved at only 1.63 V ( = 400 mV), which represents better OER activity than that of the benchmark IrO2 electrocatalyst (301 mV and 313 mV required to drive a current density of 10 mAcm(-2)). Furthermore, the catalyst demonstrates a Tafel slope of 40 mV dec(-1), a high mass activity of 560 mA mg(-1) (MA) and a large TOF value of 0.2 s(-1), and exhibits remarkable long-term stability for use in oxygen evolution experiments. A thin-film Pd electrocatalyst was obtained via the Aerosol-Assisted Chemical Vapor Deposition (AACVD) method on conducting surfaces. XRD and XPS analyses showed a phase-pure crystalline metallic Pd deposit. A surface morphology study revealed a nanoparticulate highly porous nanostructure. Our study reveals a straightforward method for the development of the first example of a Pd-derived nanoporous electrocatalyst for high-efficiency water oxidation and for chemical energy conversion.									50	0	0	0	1	0	50			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000465152700045

Using Praxair's improved hot-oxygen burner (HOB) technology, CWS can be ignited directly in the ambient atmosphere. Moreover, the spectral emissions in methane and CWS diffusion flames are obtained by a fiberoptic spectrometer and a high-spatial-resolution ultraviolet imaging system, respectively. The results indicate that the spectral emission lines of the excited radicals in CWS flames can be used to evaluate whether the coal has been ignited. Besides, the peak intensity evolutions of several main radicals under different conditions were analyzed. Based on the two-dimensional OH* distributions, the axial and radial:OH* intensity distribution in CH4 and CWS flames were discussed. Moreover, the areas of the flames and reaction regions show the proportions of the reaction region in the flame. Additionally, for the CWS diffusion flames, the OH* radicals can be considered as a good indicator of heat release rate. The OH*/CH* and OH*/C-2* intensity ratios can be used to estimate the O/C or CWS flow rate. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The conversion process is achieved through a two-step solvothermal method in the presence of phosphoric acid (H3PO4) as a phosphorus source and promoter of the self-weaving process. The formation of such nanotube-assembled architectures is promoted by the "peeling-self-weaving" mechanism, in which the bimetallic Ni-Co hydrogen phosphate nanotubes initially grow on the surface of the Ni-Co glycerate spheres due to the reactions between Ni and Co metals bonded to the glycerate anions with hydrogen phosphate anions present in the solution. This is followed by the peeling of the overgrown nanotubes from the etched glycerate spheres and their self-weaving into 1D or 2D architectures depending on the Ni/Co molar ratio. The electrocatalytic test results reveal the superior activity of the Ni-rich Ni-Co hydrogen phosphate electrode for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) compared to its Co-rich and equimolar counterparts, leading to smaller overpotential of 320 mV and lower Tafel slope of 84 mV dec(-1). Post-OER analysis of this sample reveals that the high OER activity is derived from the formation of active Ni-Co oxyhydroxide phase on its surface.									36	2	0	0	1	0	36			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000521938400009

Here we constructed puffed quaternary FexCoyNi1-x-yP nanoarrays as bifunctional electrodes for robust overall water splitting. The iron was used as the modulator to manipulate the electron density of NiCoP nanoarray, which could increase the positive charges of metal (Ni and Co) and P sites. The resultant electronic structure of FexCoyNi1-x-yP was supposed to balance the adsorption and desorption of H and accelerate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics. Moreover, the morphological structure of FexCoyNi1-x-yP was modulated through the kinetically controlled alkaline etching by using the amphoteric features of initial FeCoNi hydroxide nanowires. The resultant puffed structure has rich porosity, cavity and defects, which benefit the exposure of more active sites and the transport of mass/ charge. As a result, the cell integrated with the puffed quaternary FexCoyNi1-x-yP nanoarrays as both the cathode and anode only requires the overpotentials of 25 and 230 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and OER at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media and a cell voltage of 1.48 V to drive the overall water splitting. Moreover, the puffed FexCoyNi1-x-yP demonstrates remarkable durability for continuous electrolysis even at a large current density of 240 mA cm(-2).									27	6	0	0	0	0	27			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000522915800003

Manipulating the spin configuration ofthe water oxidation intermediates allows us to overcome these constraints. Cobalthexacyanoferrate (CoFe-PB) is an efficient and robust water oxidation catalyst andfurther known as a magnetic switch. Its versatile electronic structure renders it a potentialcandidate for magnetic tuning of the OER. Herein, we usedfirst-principles densityfunctional theory calculations to describe the OER on two different CoFe-PB modelsystems and evaluated the possibility for spin-crossover (SCO) of their resting states. Weshow that SCO during OER can significantly lower the overpotential by 0.7 V, leading toan overpotential of around 0.3 V, which is in agreement with the experimentallymeasured value.

Transition-metal phosphates and phosphonates have shown remarkable performances for these reactions based on their unique physicochemical properties. Compared with transition-metal oxides, phosphate groups in transition-metal phosphates and phosphonates show flexible coordination with diverse orientations, making them an ideal platform for designing active electrocatalysts. Although numerous efforts have been spent on the development of transition-metal phosphate and phosphonate electrocatalysts, some urgent issues, such as low intrinsic catalytic efficiency and low electronic conductivity, have to be resolved in accordance with their applications. In this Review, we focus on the design strategies of highly efficient transition-metal phosphate and phosphonate electrocatalysts, with special emphasis on the tuning of transition-metal-center coordination environment, optimization of electronic structures, increase of catalytically active site densities, and construction of heterostructures. Guided by these strategies, recently developed transition-metal phosphate and phosphonate materials have exhibited excellent activity, selectivity, and stability for various energy-related electrocatalytic reactions, showing great potential for replacing noble-metal-based catalysts in next-generation advanced energy techniques. The existing challenges and prospects regarding these materials are also presented.									20	1	0	0	1	0	20			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000579127700001	33030810

Despite numerous efforts, the strategies to prepare durable and effective electrocatalysts via scalable methods still remain a great challenge. In this work, we fabricated Fe-doped Ni(OH)(2) ultrathin nanosheets (Fe-Ni-OH/Ni) via autologous growing of Ni(OH)(2) from Ni foam, and in situ electrochemical-assisted doping Fe into Ni(OH)(2). Benefiting from the unique structure with large surface areas and strong coupling effects between Fe and Ni, the optimal Fe-Ni-OH electrodes exhibit remarkable catalytic performance toward OER, which requires an overpotential of 220 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 48.3 mV dec(-2). The Fe-Ni-OH electrodes also possess high stability even under a high current density of 500 mA cm(-2) for 600 h with an ultralow overpotential of 290 mV. Using Ni-Fe-OH electrodes as both anode and cathode for overall water splitting, only a small overpotential of 1.57 V is required to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the high catalytic performance and scalable preparation method can meet the emergency needs for the practical application. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Designing elaborate structures and favorable phase composition is regarded as effective to improve the activity in electrocatalysis. Herein, three kinds of layered cobalt hydroxide nanocones (NCs) with tunable interlayer spacing determined by the intercalated anion species were prepared. Because of the larger interlayer spacing which might be beneficial for faster mass transfer, dodecyl sulfate (DS-) ion-intercalated layered cobalt hydroxide NCs yielded current densities of 5 and 10.65 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 0.50 and 0.57 V, respectively, in the electrolytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in a neutral phosphate buffer solution (PBS); thus, they surpassed their counterparts with decreased layer distances induced by intercalated acetate (CH3COO-) or nitrate (NO3-) anions. When a further phosphidation treatment was adopted on NO3--intercalated cobalt hydroxide NCs, a cobalt phosphide (CoP) product with well-maintained conical morphology was obtained, which reduced the overpotential of similar to 20 mV to reach the anodic exchange current density of 5 mA cm(-2). The activity enhancement induced by the tuning of interlayer spacing and phosphidation offers great promise for developing high-activity catalysts by rationally designing phase structure and composition for electrochemical energy conversion.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2052-1553			WOS:000475394700013

Herein, we prepared a polyaniline-coated NiCo-layered double hydroxide intercalated with MoO42- (M-LDH@PANI) composite electrode using a two-step method. As the amount of MoO42- in the LDH increases, acicular microspheres steadily evolve into flaky microspheres with a high surface area, providing more active electrochemical sites. Moreover, the amorphous PANI coating of M-LDH boosts the electronic conductivity of the composite electrode. Accordingly, the M-LDH@PANI at an appropriate level of MoO42- exhibits significantly enhanced energy storage and catalytic performance. Experimental analyses and theoretical calculations reveal that a small amount of MoO42- is conducive to the expansion of LDH interlayer spacing, while an excessive amount of MoO42- combines with the H atoms of LDH, thus competing with OH-, resulting in reduced electrochemical performance. Moreover, M-LDH flaky microspheres can efficiently modulate deprotonation energy, greatly accelerating surface redox reactions. This study provides an explanation for an unconventional mechanism, and a method for the modification of LDH-based materials for anion intercalation.

Properties of the electrode were investigated by XRD, SEM and electrochemical measurements. The results showed that the Nb2O5 doping led to transformation of crystalline form, and alpha-PbO2 was formed in the surface of the anode, which improved the binding degree between the coating and substrate as well as efficiency of electron-transfer. It also led to the increase of the crystallite size and the particles were arranged regularly and uniformly. When the optimum doping content of Nb2O5 was 3.5 g/L, oxygen evolution potential increased to 1.523 V, step current was 0. 1559 A, and strengthening lifetime reached 702 min. Compared with PbO2 electrode, Nb2O5/PbO2 electrode significantly enhanced electrocatalytic performance and stability. The modified electrode was effective in degradation of disperse blue B. The best degradation conditions were: pH = 2; concentration of electrolyte c (NaCl) = 0.7 moVL; current density was 40 mA/cm2. After 1 h, the decoloration rate of disperse blue B reached up to 89%.

In this study, cobalt-nickel phosphide/N-doped porous carbon polyhedron electrocatalysts (CoNiP/NC) were prepared by a facile two-step carbonization method and subsequent phosphorization calcination in an Ar atmosphere using cobalt-based zeo-litic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) as precursors. Among the electrocatalysts obtained by controlling the carbonization and phosphorization temperature, the CoNiP/NC700 catalyst, where 700 refers to the calcination temperature (degrees C), exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity for the OER with an onset overpotential of approximate 220 mV and an overpotential of approximate 300 mV in alkaline solution at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). The CoNi/NC and Co/NC Samples were also tested for comparison and CoNiP/NC exhibited the better electrocatalytic activity at all the temperatures tested. The superior electrocatalytic activity of the phosphorization hybrid material can be attributed to the superior synergistic effect of Co, Ni, P and C due to their strong electron coupling interactions. The interconnected amorphous carbon anchored the active Co compounds to avoid aggregation and maintained conducting channels for electron transfer. The composite electrocatalyst prepared herein is a promising candidate for use in electrocatalytic OERs. (C) 2018, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Cao, A. Wieckowski, J. Inukai, N. Alonso-Vante, J. Electrochem. Soc. 153 (2006) A869]. The chalcogenide samples - as well as the starting chalcogens-free Ru nanoparticle material - were immobilized on a gold disk for X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) characterization. While we found oxygen in most of the samples, predominantly from Ru oxides, we conclude that the oxygen on Ru/S may be located in subsurface sites: the subsurface oxygen. We also found that the transformation of the oxidized Ru black to metallic Ru required intensive electrochemical treatment, including hydrogen evolution. In contrast, five cyclic voltammetric scans in the potential range from 0.00 and 0.75 V versus RHE were sufficient to remove the oxygen forms from Ru/Se and, to a large extent, from Ru/S. We therefore conclude that Ru metal is protected against oxidation to Ru oxides by the chalcogens additives. The voltammetric treatment in the 0.00 and 0.75 V range also removed the SeO2 or SOx forms leaving anionic/elemental Se or S on the surface. Upon larger amplitude voltammetric cycling, from 0.00 to 1.20 V versus RHE, both Se and S were dissolved and the dissolution process was coincidental with the oxygen growth in/on the Ru samples.

However, the severe stacking of 2D nanosheets and large intrinsic bandgaps significantly impair their catalytic performance. Here, we report coaxial one-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures (1D vdWHs) comprised of a carbon nanotube (CNT) core and a thickness tunable thienothiophene-pyrene COF shell using a solution-based in situ wrapping method. Density functional theory calculations and operando and ex situ spectroscopic analysis indicate that carbon-sulfur regions in thienothiophene groups in the COF serve as an active catalytic site for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. The coaxial structure enables n-doping from the CNT core to the COF shell, which is controllable by varying COF shell thickness. The charge transfer from CNTs lowers COF's bandgap and work function, which reduces the charge transfer barrier between the active catalytic sites and adsorbed oxygen intermediates, resulting in dramatically enhanced catalytic activity. The 1D vdWHs were applied as a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst in rechargeable zinc-air batteries, delivering a high specific capacity of 696 mAh gZn(-1) under a high current density of 40 mA cm(-2) and excellent cycling stability. The 1D vdWHs based on the coaxial structure of 2D COF wrapped around CNT cores may be further used as versatile building units to create multidimensional vdWHs for exploring fundamental physics and chemistry as well as practical applications in electrochemistry, electronics, photonics, and beyond.									37	4	0	0	1	0	38			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000623061800110	33491450

During the pyrolysis reaction, the strong chelated interaction between Fe and N atoms serves as the pivotal role for achieving Fe single clusters via inhibiting the superabundant aggregation of Fe atoms. Compared to the Fe-based nanoparticles and commercial Pt-C, the synthesized single Fe cluster catalyst (C/TP-Fe700) owns a superior catalytic performance in alkaline medium, which is confirmed by the more positive half-wave potential (0.865 V, 28 mV higher than Pt-C), high mass activity (0.60 A mg(Fe)(-1), 10 times larger than Pt-C), the excellent durability and remarkable methanol tolerance. Additionally, it likewise presents satisfactory oxygen reduction reaction activity in acidic medium compared with Pt-C. This single metal cluster (metal cluster with subnanometer) catalyst with trace-metal contents displays double advantages from metal and metal-free oxygen reduction catalysts, such as high activity, ultralight mass, and environmental friendliness. Insight into this successful paradigm can provide a novel concept for constructing and understanding oxygen reduction catalysts at an approximate atomic scale.									16	2	0	0	1	0	16			2196-7350			WOS:000430164300006

In particular, the dissolutions of Fe and Cr were suppressed, with decreasing Fe/Ni ratios of the starting SS substrate, and they were the smallest in SS310S. Surface cross-sectional observations conducted by scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy indicated that such a dependence of the dissolution on the constituent elements can be explained by the difference in microstructure of the surface (hydro)oxides generated by the application of PCs. The results suggest that the Fe/Ni ratio of the starting SS electrodes is one of the key parameters that determine the dissolution behavior of the elements, that is, its corrosion resistance against the potential fluctuations in austenitic SS-made oxygen evolution electrodes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0360-3199	1879-3487		WOS:000870160600001		
C	Ye, Changpeng; Zhang, Mengcheng						Zhao, J; Iranpour, R; Li, X; Jin, B		Allelopathic inhibitory effects of the dried macroalga Ulva pertusa on the photosynthetic activities of red tide-causing microalga Skeletonema costatum								ADVANCES IN ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGIES, PTS 1-6		Advanced Materials Research		726-731				29	34		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.726-731.29				2013	2013	Allelopathic effects of dried macroalga Ulva pertusa (Chlorophyta) on photosynthesis of the microalgae Skeletonema costatum (Bacillariophyta) were evaluated using coexistence culture systems. S. costatum was cultured with different biomass of dried U pertusa under controlled laboratory conditions for three days. The chlorophyll a (Chl a) fluorescence transient O-J-I-P curve coupled with its specific parameters in S. costatum was established. The oxygen evolution rate was measured, the Chi a fluorescence transients were recorded in vivo at high time resolution and analyzed according to the JIP-test which can quantify photosystem II activity. A clear dose-dependent relationships were observed between the dried biomass of U pertusa and its inhibitory effect on S. costatum. The rate of light-saturated maximum photosynthetic oxygen evolution (P-max) was markedly decreased by different biomass of dried U pertusa, while dark respiration rate (R-d) was increased. A decrease in the O-J-I-P curve expressed as Chl a fluorescence intensity along with its specific parameters were observed, which was also time-dependent. The main photosynthetic inhibitory targets of the macroalga on the microalga, according to oxygen evolution rate and the JIP-test, can be expressed as, the damage to the oxygen-evolving complex, a decrease in the number of active reaction centers and the blocking of the electron transport chain. The results of the present study suggest that dried fragments of U pertusa effectively inhibit photosynthesis in S. costatum.					2nd International Conference on Energy and Environmental Protection (ICEEP 2013)2nd International Conference on Energy and Environmental Protection (ICEEP 2013)	APR 19-21, 2013APR 19-21, 2013	Inner Mongolia Univ; Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Eco Environm Sci, Key Lab Environm BiotechnolInner Mongolia Univ; Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Eco Environm Sci, Key Lab Environm Biotechnol	Guilin, PEOPLES R CHINAGuilin, PEOPLES R CHINA	4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1022-6680		978-3-03785-742-7	WOS:000333767500007

The O-2 in solution drove the open-circuit potential of the electrode to >0.4 V, which is positive of the Si passivation potential. The elevated electrochemical potential of the surface promoted formation of passive oxides on exposed Si regions of Si/Ni electrodes. Catalytic passivation of Si extended the durability of an np(+)-Si(100)/NiOx photoanode to >400 h while operating under simulated day/night cycles. In contrast, electrodes without a Ni(O-x) layer and/or without O-2 in solution displayed direct etching of the Si and corrosion pitting during non-illuminated, simulated nighttime episodes of day/night cycling. The O-2-derived catalyzed passivation of Si using thin films can be generalized to multiple phases of NiOx as well as to materials other than Ni. Relative to operation in aqueous alkaline conditions, decreasing the pH of the electrolyte decreased the dissolution rate of the protective oxide layer formed by the catalyzed passivation process, and consequently increased the durability of the photoanode, but yielded lower photoelectrode fill factors for water oxidation due to the relatively large kinetic overpotentials for the electrocatalyzed oxygen-evolution reaction at near-neutral pH.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000728258100001

Kinetic cell (KC) experiments were conducted under different ambient pressure conditions and temperature ranges, and the oxidation products were characterized using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). The results indicate that the oxygen addition and cracking reactions typically occur in the temperature intervals of 140-170 degrees C and 180-220 degrees C, respectively, at the given heating rate of 3.83 degrees C/min. Components with the mass-to-charge ratio in the region of 250-450 Da mainly evaporate in the temperature regions of 25-150 degrees C, which results in losses from the fraction. Considering the gas-liquid multi-phase reaction, the pseudo-components with low boiling range distributed on the surface of the liquid film are prone to generate high molecular weight compounds through oxygen addition. In contrast, the high boiling point range fractions increase in molecular weight through oxygen addition and are then subject to further cracking processes that generate lower molecular weights in the region of 200-400 Da. N1O3- and N1O4- containing compounds were determined by high resolution mass spectra, and these compounds were generated through oxygen addition of basic N-1-containing compounds. On the basis of these reactions and the experimental results obtained, some insights related to the LTO of heavy oil, which are highly valuable for ISC field applications, are summarized.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1996-1073		WOS:000833083200001

Considering [Fe-v(bpbp)(OH)-(O)](+2) as the active catalytic species, we explored each step of the catalytic process. To begin with, we set up the simulation with one active catalytic intermediate, 191 water molecules, and one manganese ion as the electron acceptor. Prior to performing the metadynamics simulation, we equilibrated the system through both classical and quantum mechanical levels. Post that, we first computed the free energy of oxygen-oxygen bond formation using the metadynamic process by [Fe-v(bpbp)(OH)(O)](+2). We observed that the release of dioxygen took place in the successive steps of the formation of the peroxide and superoxide complexes. We then studied the regeneration of the Fe-v=O complex with three subsequent proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions. We computed the Lowdin and Mulliken spin moments for each step of the mechanism. We performed Wannier center analysis to get formal charges of the atoms involved in the PCET steps; this analysis confirmed the occurrence of electron transfer during the proton migration to the water molecule. The free-energy barrier obtained from the metadynamics process was used to calculate the redox potentials of these reactions. Comparing each step of the catalytic process, the oxygen-oxygen bond formation step was found to be the rate-determining step. The proton transfer to the cis-OH was identified as the rate-determining microkinetic step.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000613198200015

The turbid anolyte can be avoid by using coated titanium anodes compared to conventional Pb anodes, and the generation of manganese dioxide (MnO2) on anode can be also reduced. The deposited manganese dioxide layer on coated titanium anodes are uniform and compact after electrolysis by using Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which is totally different from that on Pb anodes. The possible mechanism involving permanganate ion is proposed and confirmed by Square wave voltammetry (SWV) and in-situ ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry (UV-VIS). Moreover, the cell voltage for coated titanium anodes is about 270 mV lower than that of traditional Pb anodes, exhibiting well energy saving effect. Linear sweep voltammetry and Tafel curves show that coated titanium anodes have lower Tafel slope and possess a better catalytic property for oxygen evolution reaction. Finally X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis manifests the Ru element can be oxidized to a higher valence state and has a blocking effect for active oxygen. Our results here offer some basic electrochemical data for the anode in electrolytic manganese system, and provide a promising path for replacing Pb anodes in electrolytic manganese industry.

Benefiting from the abundant pore-structure (average pore-size approximate to 25nm) and unique electronic-properties of the Co9S8 and N, S-C layer, the as-prepared Co9S8@N, S-C exhibits rapid oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics with high electron transfer number of approximate to 3.998 and demonstrates a low overpotential of 304 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It exhibits a small potential difference of 0.647V for overall ORR/OER activity, outperforming most of the non-precious metal-catalysts previously reported. The rechargeable Zn-Air battery test further demonstrates its excellent activity and stability, in which the battery delivers a maximum power density output of 259 mW cm(-2), a specific capacity of 862 mAh g(Zn)(-1), and after continuous 110 h operation the charge-discharge round-trip efficiency only reduces by 4.83%. Theoretical calculation studies show that the surface N, S-C layers and Co9S8 can adjust each other's Fermi levels, so that the adsorption energy of Co9S8@N, S-C on O intermediate is more favorable than using Co9S8 and N, S-C alone. This study reveals the structure-function relationship of coated-nanostructures with multifunctional electrocatalytic properties, and provides a feasible strategy for the design of non-noble metal-catalysts.									35	0	0	0	1	0	35			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000659731100001

Herein, hierarchical nanosheets-based ternary CoNiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) thin films are prepared via an inexpensive and facile electrodeposition method. The structural, morphological, and electrochemical properties of films are systematically studied and compared with their binary counterparts. As prepared CoNiFe LDH shows a maximum specific capacity of 360 C g(-1) at the current density of 0.4 A g(-1) with a capacity retention of 51% even at the higher current density of 10 A g(-1). Moreover, it shows excellent cyclic stability of 84% after 2000 cycles. As an electrocatalyst, CoNiFe LDH demonstrates an excellent performance in OER, affording an overpotential of 196 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope value of 49 mV dec(-1). Also, it depicts excellent catalytic stability with stable operation for over 10 h. Thus, ternary CoNiFe LDH thin film can be used as a promising electrode material for both electrochemical energy storage and catalysis. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

With this model electrode together with the dedicated in situ synchrotron based techniques (SXRD, XRR) and ex situ characterization techniques (SEM, ToF-SIMS, XPS), the corrosion process of IrO2(110) in an acidic environment (pH 0.4) is studied on different length scales. Potential-induced pitting corrosion starts at 1.48 V vs SHE and is initiated at so-called surface grain boundaries, where three rotational domains of IrO2(110) meet. The most surprising result is, however, that even when the electrode potential is increased to 1.94 V vs SHE 60-70% of the IrO2 film still stays intact down to the mesoscale and atomic scale and no uniform thinning of the IrO2(110) layer is encountered. Neither flat IrO2(110) terraces nor single steps are attacked. Ultrathin single crystalline IrO2(110) layers seem to be much more stable to anodic corrosion than hitherto expected.									23	0	0	0	1	0	23			2155-5435			WOS:000474812400072

The intermediate discharge product in a Liair battery, LiO2, is found to be less stable on all rutile surfaces and will be further reduced to Li2O2 through disproportionation reaction. For the first and second layers of deposited Li(2)O2, the adsorption energy is comparable to the cohesive energy of bulk Li2O2, suggesting Li2O2 will likely wet the oxide surfaces and grow into thin films rather than particles. Electronic structure analyses of interfaces demonstrate Li2O2/TiO2(110) is metallic and Li2O2/SnO2(110) is semiconducting with a bandgap of 0.2 eV, substantially smaller than in bulk Li2O2. The large lattice mismatch at these interfaces could create amorphousness of Li2O2 and grain boundaries might form abundantly thereafter, both of which can provide charge and ion transport channels needed for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in Liair batteries. Therefore, coating nanostructured carbon cathode with thin films of TiO2 or employing mesoporous TiO2 nanostructures as cathode could possibly lead to the formation of low-resistance Li2O2 thin films and thereby enhance the rate capacity of Liair batteries.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000348094000018

In particular, at current densities below 10 mA cm(-2), Ni0.3Fe0.07Co0.2Ce0.43Ox exhibits superior activity compared to the corresponding transition metal oxides, despite the relative inactivity of ceria. To elucidate the enhanced activity and underlying catalytic mechanism, detailed structural characterization of this quinary oxide electrocatalyst is reported. Transmission electron microscopy imaging of cross-section films as-prepared and after electrochemical testing reveals a stable two-phase nanostructure composed of 3-5 nm diameter crystallites of fluorite CeO2 intimately mixed with 3-5 nm crystallites of transition metal oxides alloyed in the rock salt NiO structure. Dosing experiments demonstrate that an electron flux greater than approximate to 1000 e angstrom(-2) s(-1) causes the inherently crystalline material to become amorphous. A very low dose rate of 130 e angstrom(-2) s(-1) is employed for atomic resolution imaging using inline holography techniques to reveal a nanostructure in which the transition metal oxide nanocrystals form atomically sharp boundaries with the ceria nanocrystals, and these results are corroborated with extensive synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements. Ceria is a well-studied cocatalyst for other heterogeneous and electrochemical reactions, and our discovery introduces biphasic cocatalysis as a design concept for improved OER electrocatalysts.									60	2	0	0	4	0	62			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000354810400009

Herein, a versatile coupling strategy was developed to engineer atomically dispersed Ni-N-4 sites coordinated with an axial direction oxygen atom (Ni-N-4-O) incorporated between oxygen evolution cocatalyst (OEC) and semiconductor photoanode, boosting the photogenerated electron-hole separation and thus improving PEC activity. This state-ofthe-art OEC/Ni-N-4-O/BiVO4 photoanode exhibits a record high photo-current density of 6.0 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs RHE), over approximately 3.97 times larger than that of BiVO4, achieving outstanding long-term photostability. From X- ray absorption fine structure analysis and density functional theory calculations, the enhanced PEC performance is attributed to the construction of single-atomic Ni-N-4-O moiety in OEC/BiVO4, facilitating the holes transfer, decreasing the free energy barriers, and accelerating the reaction kinetics. This work enables us to develop an effective pathway to design and fabricate efficient and stable photoanodes for feasible PEC water splitting application.									24	0	0	0	4	0	24			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000750799000003	34783534

The results are compared with those at a Pt electrode. Benzene was observed to be oxidized to benzoquinone presumably by active oxygen that was adsorbed on the GC electrode in the oxygen evolution region. It is concluded that oxidation at glassy carbon can produce benzoquinone or quinone-like compounds from an aqueous benzene solution. The applied potential for benzene oxidation should be less than 2.1 V vs RHE in order to prevent glassy carbon electrode damage by oxidation during long operation.									32	6	0	0	6	0	35			0021-891X			WOS:000087171000003

Hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) is a photoanode typically used because of advantages such as its abundance, low cost, multiple convenient deposition methods, and an attractive bandgap energy; however, poor electrical properties prevent high solar energy to hydrogen conversion efficiencies. In this work, we evaluate and compare several strategies to address this issue, using a nanorod array morphology and incorporation of overlayers of one or more materials that favor the charge carrier transfer kinetics and reduce surface recombination. We use intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) to evaluate these systems, and demonstrate that the presence of TiO2 and MoO x overlayers successfully suppresses surface recombination through passivation of hematite interfacial recombination sites. However, the hole transfer process at the overlayers occurs at more positive potentials due to the location of the new surface states at the overlayer-electrolyte interface. We show that the deposition of the CoPi oxygen evolution reaction co-catalyst partially addresses this disadvantage. The best efficiencies were obtained for the CoPi-TiO2/alpha-Fe2O3 and CoPi-MoO x /TiO2/alpha-Fe2O3 photoelectrodes, with internal quantum efficiencies of 0.42-0.44 under 455 nm irradiation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000801291500001

In contrast to catalysts with other morphologies, nanowire catalysts show great potential in electrocatalysis due to their large surface area, abundant high-index facet sites for catalysis, quick electron and mass transport for better conductivity, promotion for recycling and 3D structure construction, and good prohibition for vulnerability to dissolution, Ostwald ripening, and aggregation. Yet, it is challenging to endow PG nanowires with a precise control on size, shape, and composition. Here, the recently available strategies for designing PG-based nanowire electrocatalysts with enhanced activity and stability are highlighted. A summary of the synthetic methods for generating different kinds of nanowires with detailed experimental parameters is also provided, with particular emphases on the recent progress of PG-based nanowires for boosting the electrocatalytic reactions, including fuel cell reactions, hydrogen evolution reaction, and oxygen evolution reaction. In the final section, available perspectives on the future development of PG-based nanowires for enhanced catalytic performances are discussed separately.									37	4	0	0	0	0	37			2366-9608			WOS:000471814300009

The outside Ag3PO4 layer acted as a light-absorbing material to generate electron-hole pairs, while the inside Ag NPs acted as both the framework and the electrical connector between Ag3PO4 and the conducting substrate. The obtained composite photoanodes showed a high catalytic activity toward photoelectrochemical (PEC) oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The photoinduced holes reacted with water to generate oxygen on the Ag3PO4 surface, while the photoinduced electrons were efficiently transported to the counter electrode by highly conductive Ag NPs. The Ag/Ag3PO4 composite photoanode exhibited a photocurrent density of 0.25 mA cm(-2) at 0.500 V vs. SCE, which is the highest among reported values obtained under conditions similar to this work. The amount of evolved oxygen was monitored to evaluate the percentage of the photocurrent involved in PEC OER, and the Faraday efficiency for PEC OER was obtained to be ca. 95.6%, indicating that most of the photoinduced holes were engaged in OER. The in situ PEC oxidation of Ag to Ag3PO4, which compensated the loss of Ag3PO4 during PEC OER, makes the Ag/Ag3PO4 composite a self-healing system for OER in phosphate solution.									32	3	0	0	2	0	34			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000361553100024

Alternatively, rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries have the potential to practically provide 3-5 times the gravimetric energy density of conventional Li-ion batteries. However, the lack of advanced electrode design and efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction-evolution reactions remains as one of the grand challenges before this technology can be commercialized. Among various catalyst formulations, nanocarbon composite materials have been recognized as the most promising ones for Li-O2 batteries because of their reasonable balance among catalytic activity, durability, and cost. In this perspective, the recent progress in the development of nanostructured carbon-based electrocatalysts for nonaqueous Li-O-2 batteries is discussed, including metal-free carbon catalysts, transition-metal-nitrogen-carbon composite catalysts, and transition-metal-compounds/nanocarbon catalysts. The morphology-performance correlations of these catalysts are highlighted, aiming to provide guidance for rationally designing advanced catalysts.									96	6	0	0	4	0	99			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000338116700002	24715024

Herein, an advanced bifunctional electrocatalyst is presented, composed of Fe2P encapsulated in carbon nanowalls decorated with well-dispersed Fe3C nanodots (denoted as Fe2P@Fe3C/CNTs), which is achieved by a novel "inside-out" gas-solid reaction protocol. When functioning as a cathodic catalyst for water splitting, the Fe2P@Fe3C/CNT catalyst needs an ultralow overpotential of 83 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), shows a small Tafel slope of 53 mV dec(-1) and ensures long-term stability for over 200 h in an alkaline electrolyte. Notably, the Fe2P@Fe3C/CNT catalyst exhibits an extremely impressive ORR performance with an onset potential (E-onset) of 1.060 V and a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.930 V, excellent stability (approximate to 94% activity retention after 36 000 s), and a strong methanol resistance ability, even far outperforming commercial Pt/C (E-onset = 0.955 V, E-1/2 = 0.825 V, approximate to 75% activity retention after less than 3500 s). Such outstanding HER and ORR performances are mainly ascribed to the improved corrosion resistance of the unique Fe2P@C core-shell structures, the abundant catalytically active sites of ultrasmall Fe3C nanodots incorporated in carbon nanowalls, and the good electrical conductivity of 2D graphitic carbon nanotubes used as a support.									3	1	0	0	0	0	4			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000709945800001	34679151

Using solution-phase arrested-precipitation reactions, crystalline Ni2-xRuxP particles could be realized for compositions up to x <= 1, whereas more Ru-rich compositions, including Ru2P, were amorphous. For x <= 1, particles are spherical, of sizes that vary between 5 and 10 nm in diameter (with a clear decreasing trend as the Ru amount is increased), and samples exhibit narrow size distributions (polydispersity < 15%). In contrast, amorphous Ru-rich phases exhibit worm-like morphologies. ICP-MS data indicate the actual metal ratio closely follows the target ratio employed in the synthesis. OER electrocatalytic activity was evaluated for selected compositions over the entire synthesis range (0 <= x <= 2). Intriguingly, Ru2P proved to be the least active phase (overpotential of 0.56 V at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH) with the best performance observed for the bimetallic Ni1.25Ru0.75P phase (overpotential of 0.34 V). The augmented activity at x = 0.75 is attributed, at least in part, to electronic activation of Ni by Ru, facilitating Ni oxidation and thus decreasing the kinetic barrier for OER.									39	1	0	0	2	0	39			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000408267300051

Here, a COF is prepared using building units with highly flexible tetrahedral sp(3) nitrogens. This flexibility gives rise to structural changes which generate mesopores capable of confining very small (<2 nm sized) non-noble-metal-based nanoparticles (NPs). This nanocomposite shows exceptional activity toward the oxygen-evolution reaction from alkaline water with an overpotential of 258 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The overpotential observed in the COF-nanoparticle system is the best in class, and is close to the current record of approximate to 200 mV for any noble-metalfree electrocatalytic water splitting system-the Fe-Co-Ni metal-oxide-film system. Also, it possesses outstanding kinetics (Tafel slope of 38.9 mV dec(-1)) for the reaction. The COF is able to stabilize such small-sized NP in the absence of any capping agent because of the COF-Ni(OH)(2) interactions arising from the N-rich backbone of the COF. Density-functional-theory modeling of the interaction between the hexagonal Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets and the COF shows that in the most favorable configuration the Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets are sandwiched between the sp(3) nitrogens of the adjacent COF layers and this can be crucial to maximizing their synergistic interactions.									86	5	0	0	7	0	87			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000379314700006

However, the structure evolution of porous graphene under high temperature is poorly understood. In this contribution, 3D double-layer templated graphene (DTG) composed of two non-stacked graphene layers with interlayer spacing around 15 nm and separated by a large quantity of protuberances, was employed as a special case to track the structure evolution of 3D porous graphene at high temperature. Compared with thermally reduced graphene oxide with easy graphitized nature, the unique non-stacked DTG structure was well preserved after a high-temperature annealing at 1600 degrees C. With limited self-healing of defects for graphene layers, and with preservation of mesosized protuberances that prevent graphene layers stacking during annealing, DTG is regarded as 'hard carbon' ('non-graphitizable carbon'). The electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, gravimetric elemental analysis, nitrogen/water physisorption, and probe reactions of electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction were employed to reveal the graphitization degree and surface chemistry of non-stacked DTG after high-temperature treatment.

PCC 6803 with large deletions in the D-E loop of the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center polypeptide D1 were subjected to high light to investigate the role of this hydrophilic loop in the photoinhibition cascade of PSII. The tolerance of PSII to photoinhibition in the autotrophic mutant Delta R225-F239 (PD), when oxygen evolution was monitored with 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone and the equal susceptibility compared with control when monitored with bicarbonate, suggested an inactivation of the Q(B)-binding niche as the first event in the photoinhibition cascade in vivo. This step in PD was largely reversible at low light without the need for protein synthesis. Only the next event, inactivation of Q(A) reduction, was irreversible and gave a signal for D1 polypeptide degradation. The heterotrophic deletion mutants Delta G240-V249 and Delta R225-V249 had severely modified Q(B) pockets, yet exhibited high rates of 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone-mediated oxygen evolution and less tolerance to photoinhibition than PD. Moreover, the protein-synthesis-dependent recovery of PSII from photoinhibition was impaired in the Delta G240-V249 and Delta R225-V249 mutants because of the effects of the mutations on the expression of the psbA-2 gene. No specific sequences in the D-E loop were found to be essential for high rates of D1 polypeptide degradation.									40	2	1	0	37	0	43			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000074182400015	9625701

Herein, we present a facile route to synthesize low Pt-content ternary PtNiCu nanostructures with hollow interior and accessible surfaces (H-PtNiCu-AAT NPs) as enhanced multifunctional electrocatalysts. The galvanic replacement reaction and atomic diffusion between in situ preformed CuNi nanocrystals and Pt species should be responsible for the formation of hollow PtNiCu NPs. Continuous activation by acid picking and annealing treatments were performed to leach out the excessive Cu and Ni on the surfaces and to enrich Pt-content on the surface. H-PtNiCu-AAT NPs exhibit excellent activity and durability toward HER, ORR, and MOR due to the rational integration of multiple structural advantages. Strikingly, the mass activity and specific activity of H-PtNiCu-AAT NPs (0.977 A mg(Pt)(-1) and 1.458 mA cm(-2)) is 7.1 and 6.9 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C (0.138 A mg(Pt)(-1) and 0.212 mA cm(-2)) toward ORR at 0.9 V (vs RHE), respectively. This present work provides an efficient strategy for the design of low Pt-content trimetallic electrocatalysts with excellent activity and durability.									32	3	0	0	1	0	32			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000517360000067	32027803	
J	Takahashi, Misa; Morikawa, Hiromichi								A novel role for PsbO1 in photosynthetic electron transport as suggested by its light-triggered selective nitration in Arabidopsis thaliana								PLANT SIGNALING & BEHAVIOR				13	9					e1513298	10.1080/15592324.2018.1513298				2018	2018	Exposure of Arabidopsis leaves to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) results in the selective nitration of specific proteins, such as PsbO1. The 9th tyrosine residue ((9)Tyr) of PsbO1 has been identified as the nitration site. This nitration is triggered by light and inhibited by photosynthetic electron transport inhibitors. During protein nitration, tyrosyl and NO2 radicals are formed concurrently and combine rapidly to form 3-nitrotyrosine. A selective oxidation mechanism for (9)Tyr of PsbO1 is required. We postulated that, similar to (161)Tyr of D1, (9)Tyr of PsbO1 is selectively photo-oxidized by photosynthetic electron transport in response to illumination to a tyrosyl radical. In corroboration, after reappraising our oxygen evolution analysis, the nitration of PsbO1 proved responsible for decreased oxygen evolution from the thylakoid membranes. NO2 is reportedly taken into cells as nitrous acid, which dissociates to form NO2-. NO2- may be oxidized into NO2 by the oxygen-evolving complex. Light may synchronize this reaction with tyrosyl radical formation. These findings suggest a novel role for PsbO1 in photosynthetic electron transport.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1559-2316	1559-2324		WOS:000445877700006	30230951

It is thus of importance to explore the influence of different factors on the behavior of copper in deoxygenated aqueous solutions. In the present work, we focus on the role of the surface film and associated cuprous species. Electrochemical impedance measurements, in-situ detection of free soluble cupric ion and dissolved hydrogen are employed. The obtained results are quantitatively described by a kinetic model, its main feature being the formation of a CuOH intermediate at the cuprous oxide film/electrolyte interface both by oxidation of Cu and reduction of free soluble Cu2+. This intermediate is assumed to play a pivotal role in a sequential surface reaction generating hydrogen gas by reduction of water. The model is successfully parameterized using regression of the model equations to in-situ experimental data, and conclusions on the effect of oxide films are reached based on the evolution of kinetic parameters with time and temperature.

The slowly cooled areas (SCA) have a coarser microstructure than that of the remaining part (called "the general zone"). The effect of anode microstructure on the electrochemical behavior was investigated using galvanostatic, potentiodynamic and electrochemical impedance techniques, The results show that the resistances for the two steps of the oxygen evolution reaction on the slowly cooled areas of Pb-Ag anodes are higher than that on the general zone. The double layer capacitance for the first step of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the pseudocapacitance of the second step of OER on SCA are smaller than those on the general zone. The potentiodynamic results show that the amount of lead dioxide formed on the SCA is greater than that of the general zone of the anode. The potential decay curves after 30 minutes of galvanostatic polarization at 45 mA/cm(2) show that the corrosion potential of the SCA is 200 mV lower than that of the general zone. This can lead to perforation because of the formation of a galvanic cell with a small anode and a large cathode.

Norin No. 8) and the chlorophyll (Chl) b-deficient mutant derived from Norin No. 8 (chlorina 11), the present study monitored the oxygen evolution, contents of Chl a and b, beta-carotene, and lutein in leaf and the contents of cytochrome f, and the reaction centres of photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII) in thylakoids. The oxygen evolution, maximal quantum yield of PSII (F-v/F-m) and Chl concentration remained constant in both Norin No. 8 and chlorina 11 under 5 and 2% of full sunlight for six days. On the other hand, on the thylakoid level, the PSII reaction centre of chlorina 11 was more stable even under high irradiance, while approximately 40% decrease in levels of the PSII reaction centre occurred under 2% of full sunlight for six days. However, under such conditions, by regulating the stoichiometry of active PSII and PSI centres, the light absorption balance in both rice types was adjusted between the two photosystems. The present study attempted to examine whether the light absorption balance between PSII and PSI is altered to effectively conduct photosynthesis in the wild-type and Chl b-deficient mutant rice seedlings.									9	0	0	0	6	0	9			0300-3604	1573-9058		WOS:000286115100006

Herein, we established a novel strategy to construct CoNi@CN composites with open structure through template-modulating thermal transformation of Co-NRs@Co-Ni-MOF. The internal elongated Co-NRs will convert into carbon nanotubes to create an open channel to the metal active sites needed for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) processes, thereby increasing the O-containing intermediates transmission and boosting the ORR/ OER performances. Surprisingly, the optimal Co3Ni1@CN-900 composites deliver excellent ORR/OER activities, affording a high half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.869 V for ORR and a low overpotential of 366 mV for OER, as well as a narrow potential gap between ORR and OER of 0.727 V.

The successful introduction of nitrogen dopants afforded N-GMT more active sites for significantly enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity, achieving a current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2) at overpotentials of 0.464 and 0.426 V vs. RHE in 0.1 and 6 M KOH solution, respectively. This HER performance surpassed that of the best metal-free catalyst reported in basic solution, further illustrating the great potential of N-GMT as an efficient HER catalyst for real applications in water splitting and chlor-alkali processes.									76	6	0	0	4	0	76			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000382882200009

MIGRATION OF ISOTOPIC AND REACTION FRONTS AROUND COOLING PLUTONS								EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS				114	1			131	148		10.1016/0012-821X(92)90156-P				DEC 1992	1992	Intrusion of felsic plutons of Permian age into Lower Paleozoic shale-carbonate sequences caused extensive contact metamorphism in the Oslo Rift. Oxygen and carbon isotope data from both carbonates and shales are presented to demonstrate that the progress of metamorphic reactions in the contact aureole around the Drammen granite was, to a large extent, controlled by the infiltration of water-rich fluids of a magmatic oxygen and with a carbon isotope signature. Highly integrated fluid fluxes were confined to shale-rich lithologies; massive limestones were relatively impermeable to fluid flow. The spatial distribution of isotopic and reaction fronts in the aureole and coupled O-18-C-13 isotope variations of carbonates from interlayered shale-carbonate units fits well to a 1-D transport model, with fluid flow away from the intrusive contact; whereas the same isotope variations in limestones containing thin shale intercalations do not. The high fluid fluxes estimated from 1-D models (> 2000 m3/m2) require either focused flow of magmatic fluids in the study area or large-scale convective flow, possibly involving fluids of meteoric origin. Limited kinetic broadening of the oxygen isotopic front indicates fluid fluxes of < 10(-8) m/s. Fluid flow must have persisted for > 10(4) yr to have moved the oxygen front 1000 m from the intrusive contact.Simple 2-D transport models, involving dominant fluid flow along aquifers or fractures and involving diffusion as well as advection, explain most of the coupled O-18-C-13 trends reported for carbonates from contact aureoles.									36	2	0	0	0	0	37			0012-821X			WOS:A1992KG34500009

Currently, iron-doped nickel-LDHs (NF-LDHs) are regarded as the benchmark electrocatalyst for alkaline OER, primarily owing to the physicochemical synergetic effects between Ni and Fe. Here, the third element addition into NF-LDHs is designed to further enhance the electrocatalytic performance through the modulation of electronic property. Cu-doped NF-LDHs (NFC-LDHs) are developed with the self-supported structure on porous supports. NFC-LDHs can be grown on carbon cloth (CC) in an intriguing 2D nanosheet structure, wherein the surface electronic configuration is suitably modulated by interactions among Ni-Fe-Cu. Importantly, activation energy for OER can be lowered by adding Cu into NF-LDHs. Thereby, the NFC-LDHs exhibited enhanced OER activity and improved stability than those of nickel-LDHs (Ni-LDHs) and NF-LDHs. For NFC-LDHs, small overpotentials of only 230 and 250 mV yield current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. In addition, excellent electrochemical stability is demonstrated during long-term OER tests without any degradation demonstrating no dissolution of active metals water electrolysis due to synergetic effects among Ni-Fe-Cu.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000644884900001

Herein, a facile and cost effective way for the synthesis of a highly complex and efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, formed solely by self-assembly in solution, is presented. Without the need for any instrumentation except for a glass beaker, highly active nickel-iron-copper multi-shell nanotube arrays are produced by immersion of a copper plate in three different solutions. Cu(OH)(2) nanowires are first self-grown on a copper substrate in a basic solution and subsequently converted to novel iron-copper hydroxide nanotubes by immersion in an Fe3+ solution by a sacrificial template-accelerated hydrolysis mechanism. Finally, an additional layer of nickel nanosheets is added by treating in a nickel chemical bath. The resulting electrode shows a current density as high as 100 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 320 mV with a Tafel slope of 32 mV dec(-1), while also exhibiting long time stability. The use of inexpensive first-row transition metals, simple preparation methods with no energy consumption, the unique hierarchical structure of the nanosheet covered nanotubes, and the high catalytic performance are remarkable, and this study may therefore lead to more convenient and competitive routes for water splitting.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000424694400026	29367976

Herein, we report the in situ surface enrichment of Ir on IrRu alloy during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The surface enrichment of Ir was probed by ex situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and electrochemical Cu stripping, leading to complementary characterizations of the dynamic reconstruction of the IrRu alloy during OER. Guided by the density functional theory (DFT), an IrRu alloy with low Ir content (20 wt%) was constructed, which displayed a low overpotential of only 230 mV to deliver an OER current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M HClO4 solution and maintained stable performance for over 20 h. To investigate the practical application potential, a proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzer using the IrRu alloy as the anode catalyst was assembled, which required a low cell voltage of only 1.48 V to generate a current density of 1 A cm(-2).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000865532500001

Nevertheless, its performance as a photoanode is considerably lower than what is theoretically achievable. In particular, the high electrochemical potential usually needed to initiate water oxidation is detrimental to the prospect of using hematite for practical devices. In this review we elucidate the appealing, as well as the challenging, aspects of using hematite for PEC water splitting and focus on the recent efforts towards lowering the onset potential of water oxidation. We examine and rationalize several strategies pursued to achieve this goal involving manipulation of the hematite/electrolyte interface, as well as improving relevant properties of hematite itself.									178	6	0	0	8	1	182			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000359459900001

However, realizing both good battery performance and portability for batteries is still a challenge to such integration application. Herein, a novel cathode material of flexible zinc-air battery is developed, i.e., NiFe-based metal-organic frameworks nanoflakes assembled on the carbon frameworks with nitrogen-heteroatom dopant (NiFe NF/NCFs). Benefiting from the unique interfacial interaction of 2D materials, as well as the rational integration of multifunctional electrocatalytic components in a flexible and compressible skeleton, the prepared NiFe NF/NCFs exhibits excellent activities for oxygen evolution/reduction reactions. Moreover, it achieves high peak power density (107.2 mW cm(-2)) and specific capacity (814.2 mAh g(-1)) when served as the cathode of zinc-air batteries. Importantly, serving as both battery cathode and sensing unit, a strain sensor-battery integration device is also demonstrated based on the NiFe NF/NCFs, which displays a favorable strain sensitivity toward detecting human motions. This work provides a new pathway to the development of energy storage device for flexible electronics.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2699-9412			WOS:000778973400001

This work reported NiFe-LDH nanosheets with an ultra-thin structure through an in situ surface-conversion derived from Ni-BDC. The unique structure and characteristic morphology were confirmed using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy, and the OER activities of the catalysts were systematically studied. The obtained results indicated that the synthesized Ni-BDC@NiFe-LDH-2 showed excellent OER activity, with a low overpotential of 272 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 45 mV dec(-1), and excellent stability, owing to the addition of abundant metal sites and the expansion of the electron transport channels during the conversion process to form the ultra-thin layer structure.

Developing electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with high efficiency and low cost is crucial for hydrogen energy systems due to the sluggish kinetics of OER. Herein, we have synthesized binary NiFeOH, NiFeO and NiFeP two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets on carbon cloth (CC) via a facile hydrothermal method combined with phosphorization and oxidation treatments. The porous binary NiFeP nanosheets exhibit an OER overpotential of 281 mV to achieve 20 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 74 mV dec(-1), which are lower than those of NiFeO (336 mV and 81 mV dec(-1)). After the continuous OER operation for 50 h, the NiFeP-32/CC exhibits a small degradation of the current density (88% remains). The results indicate that large amounts of NiO and NiOOH phases formed on the NiFeP nanosheets during the OER process. The electrocatalytic activity for oxidized NiFeP with NiO and NiOOH phases is higher than that of pure NiFeO and NiFeOH, indicating that the synergistic effects among the NiFeP, NiO and NiOOH phases could improve the OER activity.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2398-4902			WOS:000498612600027

Compared with individual element doping, doping carbon materials with multiple heteroelements has more advantages for enhancing the OER performance. However, doped sites for the different atoms are highly uncontrollable under the reported methods, which hinder the deeper understanding on the relationship between structure and property, and also limit the enhancement of catalytic activity. Our latest research has reported a method to site-controlled introducing a new form of nitrogen atoms, i.e. sp-hybridized nitrogen (sp-N), into graphdiyne, showing its potential advantages in OER catalysis. Since the sites of sp-N atoms are defined in graphdiyne, and the doping sites for S atoms are well understood, the relative position between N and S can be further defined. It gives us a chance to understand deeply the mechanism in the N, S heteroelements doped metal-free catalyst. Experimental results present that the codoping of sp-N and S atoms brought an excellent OER performance with low overpotential and high current density owning to the effectively synergistic effect of the stereodefined heteroatoms.									126	17	0	0	6	0	125			0002-7863			WOS:000467781600004	31002756

However, the activity of oxygen electrocatalysis and the pseudocapacitive performance of cobalt oxide (Co3O4) in the reported works are usually inconsistent. To explore this issue, a series of Co3O4 nanoplates are fabricated using different calcination temperatures, and their morphologies, microstructures, and electrochemical behaviors in alkaline solutions are systemically characterized. It is found that the high calcination temperature destroys the hexagonal nanoplate morphology and leads to decreased surface areas and pore volumes. In addition, the activity of Co3O4 nanoplates toward the ORR and OER and the capacitance values decrease with an increase of the calcination temperature. From the ORR/OER activity and the specific capacitance normalized by the specific and electrochemical surface area, the intrinsic electrochemical performance may be correlated to the surface oxidation states of Co and O. The high calcination temperature leads to the high amounts of adsorbed oxygen species and Co3+ atoms on the surface, which may be the key for the high intrinsic ORR and OER activity based on the electrochemical surface area. However, the apparent performance is insufficient due to the greatly reduced surface area. For the pseudocapacitive performance, on the contrary, the greater amount of Co2+ on the surface is favorable. Hence, the inconsistent electrochemical performance of Co3O4 may originate from different geometries and surface oxidation states on the surface, which are affected by the calcination temperature in the synthesis process. This work provides insights into the design and optimization of non-precious materials in electrochemical systems, and offers a feasible strategy to improve the performance by using a low-temperature calcination method.

Graphite carbon nitride (GCN) is a promising pho-tocatalyst to drive OWS reaction owing to its suitable band structure, variable structural modulation, visible-light absorption, and chemical stability. Evolving from sacrificial-agent-assisted OWS half-reaction to the non-sacrificial OWS in the past decades, GCN-based Z-scheme structure serves as one of the critical milestones in recent advances of OWS. Through reviewing critical specific examples, this mini-review discusses the configuration, construction approaches, and characteristics of various GCN-based indirect and direct Z-schemes and explains how they regulate the interfacial charge transfer and redox kinetics of GCN to achieve OWS without sacrificing agents. Finally, we propose some existing problems and challenges in the GCN-based Z-scheme system, which may provide some inspirations for future development of efficient photocatalysts for OWS.

In this work, we synthesized ultrathin and porous 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets with a controllable concentration of carbon vacancies and oxygen doping. Water vapor opens the heptazine units, introduces carbon vacancies, and acts as an oxygen source for oxygen doping under high temperatures. The synergistic effect of controllable carbon vacancies and oxygen doping can continuously regulate band structures and significantly improves the separation efficiency of photoexcited charges. As a result, the prepared g-C3N4 with vigoroso reduction potential exhibits a very high photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate of 2.414 mmol g(-1) h(-1) under visible light and 7.414 mmol g(-1) h(-1) under ultraviolet-visible light, respectively, which outperforms the majority of the previously reported g-C3N4 with well-tuned band structure.

Analyses were performed using a combination of mass spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography. Thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis techniques show that the temperature at which transformation of amorphous chromia to the alpha-Cr2O3 phase occurs is dependent on the gaseous atmosphere during the heat-treatment process, and increases in the order oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen. When heating the catalyst precursor in hydrogen, the chromia material remains amorphous for temperatures below about 420 degrees C. Samples heated above ca. 470 degrees C are highly crystalline. The crystallinity of the chromia materials is the most significant factor in determining the activity, and selectivity, of the resulting catalysts for the NO/NH3 reaction. Amorphous chromia catalysts prepared with a two order-of-magnitude difference in ammonia addition rate show similar performances. Kinetic orders in oxygen to produce both nitrogen and nitrous oxide have been determined. Amorphous chromia shows a much higher order in oxygen for nitrogen formation than does alpha-Cr2O3. However, for nitrous oxide formation, the orders are approximately the same for both morphologies. Addition of 1.5% H2O vapour decreases nitric oxide and ammonia conversions over amorphous chromia for all temperatures below 275 degrees C, whereas for alpha-Cr2O3, the effect varies with reaction temperature.

The surface properties were investigated ex situ by SEM and EDX, and in situ by cyclic voltammetry in 1 mol dm(-3) HClO4 solutions. The morphology changes at about 30 mol% Pt; at lower Pt contents the surface is enriched with Ir; at higher contents it is enriched with Pt. Cyclic voltammetry showed that the surface concentration of active sites decreases with increasing Pt content O-2 evolution was studied by means of current-potential curves and reaction order determinations. The mechanism was found to change going from Ir to Pt surface sites. The electrocatalytic properties were separated from surface area effects by normalizing the current to unit surface charge. The specific activity turned out to decrease by a factor of 10 as Ti is replaced by Pt, which in turn displaces Ir from the surface of the active mixed oxides.

The CoSe2 arrays obtained have excellent electrical conductivity, larger electrochemical active surface areas, and can directly serve as a binder-free electrode for supercapacitors and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). When tested as a supercapacitor electrode, the CoSe2 delivers a higher specific capacitance (544.6 F g(-1) at current density of 1 mA cm(-2)) compared with CoO (308.2 F g(-1)) or Co3O4 (201.4 F g(-1)). In addition, the CoSe2 electrode possesses excellent cycling stability. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is also assembled based on bamboo-like CoSe2 as a positive electrode and active carbon as a negative electrode in a 3.0 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. Owing to the unique stucture and good electrochemical performance of bamboo-like CoSe2, the as-assembled ACS can achieve a maximum operating voltage window of 1.7 V, a high energy density of 20.2 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 144.1W kg(-1), and an outstanding cyclic stability. As the catalyst for the OER, the CoSe2 exhibits a lower potential of 1.55 V (versus RHE) at current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a smaller Tafel slope of 62.5 mV dec(-1) and an also outstanding stability.									63	2	0	0	0	0	63			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000427876600001	29469814

Manipulating the crystal facets of photocatalysts to expose OER active facets is of great significance for increasing the overall efficiency of solar water splitting. McBirneyite (gamma-Cu3V2O8) has been characterized as a potential photocatalyst, but there is no experimental or density functional theory (DFT) calculation report on the controlled crystal faces of gamma-Cu3V2O8 so far. Therefore, the OER kinetics on the (100), (120), (021), and (002) facets which are the characteristic facets of gamma-Cu3V2O8 are studied using the DFT calculations. Our calculations show that the rate-limiting step for OER on these four facets is the dehydrogenation of the *OH species. The dehydrogenation of *OOH is kinetically and thermodynamically favorable on all investigated facets. The V terminals on the surfaces of gamma-Cu3V2O8 are found to be superior active sites for the dehydrogenation of H2O. In addition, the product O2 is more easily desorbed from the (100) facets compared to other facets. Our results show that the (100) facet is the most active for OER in all investigated facets of gamma-Cu3V2O8.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2468-8231			WOS:000829496600002

In this study, a convenient synthetic pathway is proposed to fabricate di-cobalt phosphide (Co2P) nanoparticles anchored on a multi-element doped carbon nanosheet. Initially, a ligand exchange combined with an ionic-bonding-assisted assembly strategy was developed to synthesize a new type of metal-organic framework (MOF)/polymer composite. Surface ligands of the leaf-like zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-L) are exchanged with multi-nitrogen-containing ligands of polyethylenimine (PEI). Renewable phosphorus-containing ligands of phytic acid (PA) are then incorporated via electrostatic interactions, generating ZIF-L/PEI/PA nanocomposites. Continuously, via a facile one-step carbonization of ZIF-L/PEI/PA, Co2P nanoparticles hybridized with Co, N and P co-doped carbon nanoleaves (Co2P@CoNPC) can be obtained. The well-defined Co2P@CoNPC hybrids exhibited good electro-catalytic performance in oxygen evolution reactions (OERs), which afford low overpotential in 1.0 M KOH on a glass carbon electrode (eta@10 mA cm(-2) = 311 mV) with a Tafel slope of 78 mV dec(-1), attributing to the synergistic effects of stabilized Co2P and heteroatom-doped two-dimensional carbon nanosheets.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000644989300001

The carbon-supported LaMn0.6Fe0.4O3 nanoparticle was prepared via a reverse homogeneous precipitation method, and fabricated to air electrode. Li-air cell was constructed using air electrode, Li metal foil and 1.0 M LiPF6 in propylene carbonate as a cathode, anode and electrolyte, respectively. As the result, the carbon-supported LaMn0.6Fe0.4O3 nanoparticle exhibited both the oxygen evolution activity and the oxygen reduction activity in the non-aqueous electrolyte. The investigation about the presence and absence of the catalytic layer and the gas diffusion layer revealed that each layer is indispensable for the excellent electrode performance, and that the catalytic layer and the gas diffusion layer has a important role to supply the electrolyte and the oxygen gas, respectively. The investigation about the amount of the catalytic layer and the effect of the oxygen concentration revealed that the oxygen diffusability into the air electrode strongly affects to the discharge capacity of Li-air cells.

In particular, the cation exchange reaction is considered as an effective method to alter the composition of the starting nanostructures while maintaining the initial structural characteristics. Herein, we report the synthesis of highly crystalline Pd13Cu3S7 nanoplates (NPs) via partial cation exchange of the Cu1.81S phase by Pd cations, with Cu1.94S NPs and Pd13Cu3S2/Cu2-xS janus heterostructure as the intermediate phases. The highly crystalline Pd13Cu3S2 ternary NPs exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under acidic conditions. The HER activity of Pd13Cu3S2 NPs with its overpotential as low as 64 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) is superior to those of amorphous PdCuS and commercial Pd/C catalysts, demonstrating the importance of nanocrystal crystallinity in boosting the HER activity. They also exhibit excellent stability as compared to commercial Pt/C and Pd/C under strongly acidic conditions.									27	0	0	0	0	0	27			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000447237800032

Previously, we have predicted with DFT calculations that some TMNs form ammonia under electrochemical conditions, while others become poisoned or react to give ammonia and its parental metal. The TMNs of Sc, Ti, Y, Hf, Ta, and Mo, however, become fully covered with H adatoms without forming any ammonia. These TMNs are investigated further here, where we focus on the (100) facet of the rocksalt structure. We calculate the H coverage as a function of the applied potential. Activation energies of H-2 formation via the Tafel reaction are also calculated at varying applied potentials. The results nominate a few nitrides (TaN, HfN, MoN, and ScN) capable of catalyzing HER at low overpotentials of -0.09 to -0.34 V vs a reversible hydrogen electrode, with the activation energies of the Tafel reaction being found relatively similar to those reported on Pt(111).									74	3	0	0	2	0	77			1932-7447			WOS:000414724300021

Classical novae: the thermonuclear runaway model								Progress in Particle and Nuclear Physics				6				177	90		10.1016/0146-6410(81)90031-4				1981	1981	The thermonuclear runaway model for the classical nova outburst provides a superb example of the manner in which nuclear physics so often plays a fundamental and defining role in diverse astrophysical phenomena. The detailed characteristics of the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle hydrogen-burning reactions serve, in this instance, to impose severe restrictions on the energetics of the critical stages of these runaways and thereby afford a physical basis for distinguishing `fast' and `slow' novae. The author identifies and elaborates upon these critical dependences on the governing nuclear physics. Discussions of the properties of nova systems are limited to matters which are essential to an understanding of the nuclear behavior. A brief overview of the evolution of a classical nova system through outburst is presented. The critical role played by the properties of the CNO cycle nuclear reaction sequences is elaborated.

Here we demonstrate a facile poly(o-methylaniline)-derived fabrication of bifunctional microporous nitrogen-doped carbon micro spheres (NCMSs) with high electrocatalytic activity and stability for ORR and energy storage in supercapacitors. At a pyrolysis temperature of 900 degrees C, the highly dispersed NCMSs present a high surface area (727.1 m(2) g(-1)), proper total content of doping N, and high concentration of quaternary N, which exhibit superior electrocatalytic activities for ORR to the commercial Pt/C catalysts, high specific capacitance (414 F g(-1)), and excellent durability, making them very promising for advanced energy conversion and storage. The presented conducting polymer-derived strategy may provide a new way for the fabrication of heteroatom-doped carbon materials for energy device applications.									73	3	0	0	2	0	75			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000370583100007	26479459

In this work, carbon quantum dot (CQD) decoration and oxygen atom doping were applied to CN by a facile one-step hydrothermal method. The incorporated CQDs not only facilitate charge transfer and separation, but also provide alternative CO2 adsorption and activation sites. Further, the oxygen-atom-doped CN (OCN), in which oxygen doping is accompanied by the formation of nitrogen defects, proves to be a sustainable H+ provider by facilitating the water dissociation and oxidation half-reactions. Because of the synergistic effect of the hybridized binary CQDs/OCN addressing the three challenging issues of the CN based materials, the performance of CO2 photocatalytic conversion to CH4 over CQDs/OCN-x (x represents the volume ratio of laboratory-used H2O2 (30 wt.%) in the mixed solution) is dramatically improved by 11 times at least. The hybrid photocatalyst design and mechanism proposed in this work could inspire more rational design and fabrication of effective photocatalysts for CO2 photocatalytic conversion with a high CH4 selectivity.									70	5	0	0	8	0	71			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000494681100009

The maximum concentrations of 1Py adsorbed on saponite suggests that 1Py is adsorbed on saponite or mica as a pentavalence cation, like [1Py2H](5+) with protonation of Py groups on Py-terpy ligands. Water oxidation catalyses by 1Py were examined in homogenous solution and heterogeneous saponite or mica adsorbate systems. O-2 was evolved in a reaction of 1Py with a Ce(IV) oxidant in an aqueous solution. However, the maximum turnover number (TN) of 1Py for O-2 evolution was 0.63 for 4 days, showing that 1Py does not work as a catalyst for water oxidation in solution. The reactions of the 1Py/saponite or mica adsorbate with a Ce-IV oxidant in water catalytically produced the significant amount of O-2. The maximum TNs of 1Py on saponite and mica for O-2 evolution are 5.6 and 16 for 4 days, respectively. The kinetic analysis of O-2 evolution suggested that the unimolecular decomposition reaction of 1Py involving O-2 evolution competes with the cooperative catalysis by two equivalents of 1Py on saponite or mica. The k(2) values of 1Py adsorbates were lower than those of 1 adsorbates for saponite and mica systems, in contradiction to the magnitude relationship predicted from the E-1/2 values of 1Py and 1 based on our previous work (Yamazaki et al., 2012 [29]) The lower k(2) values could be explained most possibly by electrostatic repulsion between a pentavalent [1Py2H](5+) cation on saponite and mica, compared with a trivalent 1 cation.

Here, we propose a general strategy based on electron injection to manipulate the work function of electrocatalysts to obtain an extraordinary performance beyond precious catalysts. Based on the density functional theory calculation, the NiOOH/Ni hybrid reveals the smallest overpotential compared to NiOOH. A novel hybrid catalyst is designed to grow Fe-doped NiOOH on graphene-encapsulated FeNi3 nanodots (FeNi3@GR@Fe-NiOOH). Accordingly, the catalyst exhibits excellent OER activity and superior durability, affording a low onset potential of 1.45 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a stable current density of 11.0 mA cm(-2) at 1.6 V (vs. RHE) for over 12 h. The achieved turnover frequency of 1.16 s(-1) at an overpotential of 300 mV is the best performance among the reported similar catalysts, and even better than that of the state-of-the-art noble-metal catalysts (RuO2 and IrO2). The high electrocatalytic efficiency and robust durability are essential conditions for a superior air electrode material for Zn-air batteries. Our catalyst cycled stably for 360 cycles at 1 mA cm(-2) in 20 h with no obvious attenuation over 100 cycles for 100 h.									56	1	0	0	0	0	56			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000376091600031

Highly active OER catalysts were reported in Fe-Co mixed oxides such as perovskite-type Bao(0.5)Sr(0.5)Co(0.8)Fe(0.2)O(3-delta) (BSCF) and brownmillerite-type Ca2FeCoO5. The synergistic effects of Fe-Co mixing on the OER activity are expected in these oxides. However, the details have not been discussed yet because of their structure randomness. In this study, we examine Fe-Co mixing effects on OER catalytic activity for several perovskite and brownmillerite oxides with trivalent and tetravalent Fe and Co ions. Regardless of crystal structures and valence states, the Fe-Co mixing enhances the OER activities compared to the parent compounds. In particular, CaFe0.5Co0.5O3, a perovskite oxide consisting of Fe4+ and Co4+ ions, displays a significant increase in OER activity, which is comparable to BSCF, together with the enhancement of stability. The electronic state of CaFe0.5Co0.5O3 obtained by density-functional theory calculation with the special quasirandom structure model exhibits the existence of active sites with smaller charge-transfer energies than the parent compounds, CaFeO3 and CaCoO3. This finding proposes that the various structural and electronic environments around transition metal ions induced by random distributions of constituent metals contributes to dispersed electronic band structures, leading to highly active sites.									20	0	0	0	0	0	19			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000535241800024

Tuning the morphology and particle size is a crucial aspect in designing a highly efficient nanomaterials-based electrocatalyst for water splitting. Herein, green synthesis of nickel oxide nanoparticles using phytochemicals from three different sources was employed to synthesize nickel oxide nanoparticles (NiOx NPs). Nickel (II) acetate tetrahydrate was reacted in presence of aloe vera leaves extract, papaya peel extract and dragon fruit peel extract, respectively, and the physicochemical properties of the biosynthesized NPs were compared to sodium hydroxide (NaOH)-mediated NiOx. Based on the average particle size calculation from Scherrer's equation, using X-ray diffractograms and field-emission scanning electron microscope analysis revealed that all three biosynthesized NiOx NPs have smaller particle size than that synthesized using the base. Aloe-vera-mediated NiOx NPs exhibited the best electrocatalytic performance with an overpotential of 413 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 95 mV dec(-1). Electrochemical surface area (ECSA) measurement and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic analysis verified that the high surface area, efficient charge-transfer kinetics and higher conductivity of aloe-vera-mediated NiOx NPs contribute to its low overpotential values.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2073-4344		WOS:000736235900001

This study is continuation of our previous objective about the use of polyvinyl pyrrolidone as surface stabilizer and growth modifier during nanoparticles synthesis. The resulting products were analyzed by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron micrographs (FE-SEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET). The calculated overpotential for ZnCo2O4 NPs is as low as 0.282 V while for NiCo2O4 NPs is 0.298 V. Additionally, ZnCo2O4 NPs had obtained a low Tafel slope of 79.90 mv dec (1) while 92.28 mV dec (1) Tafel slope for NiCo2O4 NPs. Lastly, the current density was almost retained during 24 h electrochemical running and obtained 97.74% and 96.18% efficiency, for ZnCo2O4 and NiCo2O4 NPs respectively. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, a facile and scalable strategy was developed to synthesize both rod-like Co(OH) F and Co-P nanoarrays supported on Ni-foam, denoted as Co(OH) F/NF and Co-P/NF, respectively. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that Co-P/NF exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), delivering a low overpotential of 70 mV and 43 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline and acid media, respectively. Furthermore, the as-prepared Co(OH) F/NF contributes to an outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with a low oxidation potential of about 1.5 V at 10 mA cm(-2). In addition, the Co(OH) F/NF also can enable highly efficient urea oxidation reaction (UOR) electrocatalysis, which can be utilized to substitute OER to lower the overpotential and thus reduce electrical energy consumption during H2-production. As a proof of concept, full water-splitting measurements were performed with Co-P/NF and Co(OH) F/NF as cathode and anode, respectively, in 1 M KOH with 0.7 M urea. The Co-P/NFkCo(OH) F/NF electrode is capable of producing a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) at a cell potential of only 1.42 V, which is 230 mV less than that for the urea-free counterpart, demonstrating its potential feasibility in practical applications of energy-efficient hydrogen production.									156	3	0	0	6	0	156			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000459331600021

With increasing carbonization temperature and time, solid gamma-Fe2O3 cores are formed and then transformed into Fe@gamma-Fe2O3 yolk-shell-structured particles via Ostwald ripening under nitrogen gas flow. The composition variations are studied, and the formation mechanism is proposed for the generation of the hollow and yolk-shell-structured metal and metal oxides. Moreover, highly graphitic carbons can be obtained by etching the metal and metal oxide nanoparticles through an acid treatment. The electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction is investigated on Cu/gamma-Fe2O3@C, Cu/Fe@gamma-Fe2O3@C, and graphitic carbons, indicating comparable or even superior performance to other Fe-based nanocatalysts.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			0934-0866	1521-4117		WOS:000413568400010

A high-temperature reaction approach that is Co nanocrystals on carbon support (XC-72R) and selenylation to synthetize CoSe2/C nanocrystals is used, and the effect of temperature on CoSe2/C nanocrystals is studied. The morphology and catalytic properties of CoSe2/C nanocrystals annealed at different temperatures are compared in 0.5 M H2SO4. The results indicated the corallinelike CoSe2/C-650 nanocrystals have a high performance for HER with Tafel slopes of 45.73 mV.dec(-1) and onset potential of -196 mV vs. RHE. The stability maintained for at least 40 h and the Faraday Efficiency (FE) of H-2 is nearly 98%. The outstanding HER performance of CoSe2/C-650 is due to its characteristic cora-like frame CoSe2 nanocrystals embedded into supernal conductive XC-72R, which not only offer affluent active reaction sites, but also boost the capacity of charge transportation in HER process.

The considerable overpotential demanded for sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), however, prevents broad adoption of this approach. Herein, CoFe2O4/PPY hybrid is synthesized with a polypyrrole layered on the top of the CoFe2O4 via facile hydrothermal treatment. CoFe2O4/PPY is a highly efficient electrocatalyst, because it outperforms than pure CoFe2O4, PPY in terms of OER. CoFe2O4/PPY OER activities are comparable to those of commercial electrocatalysts. It's worth noting that the CoFe2O4/PPY hybrid is significantly more stable than the individuals, due to surface coated with PPY, responsible for good conduction of fast-moving electrons. The CoFe2O4/PPY coupling increases the OER by promoting electron exchange between the PPY layer and the CoFe2O4 reducing the over potential of (274 mV) and also lower the Tafel slope (47 mV/dec) with lower charge transfer resistance (3.15 ohm). According to the findings, on the top of CoFe2O4, a layer of PPY is applied for the surface modification using a conducting polymer can improve spinel oxides activity for future applications such as photoelectrocatalytic study, for stabilizing the material activity, etc.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000791663600002

Mechanically stable alpha-Mn2O3 electrodes are prepared by annealing of galvanostatically deposited MnOOHx layers on F: SnO2-coated glass. The overpotential eta to achieve a current density of j = 10 mAcm(-2) decreases from 590 to 340 mV with increasing layer thickness. Differential capacitance measurements reveal that this high OER activity can be attributed to the large electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), which scales linearly with the thickness of these highly porous and electrolyte-permeable films. The oxide layers exhibit a reversible oxidation behavior from Mn(III). Mn(IV). Although the intrinsic activity is small compared to that of other OER catalysts, such as NiFeOx, the combination of high ECSA and good electrical conductivity of these alpha-Mn2O3 films ensures that high OER activities can be obtained. The films are found to be stable for > 2 h in alkaline conditions, as long as the potential does not exceed the corrosion potential of 1.7 V vs. RHE. These findings show that alpha-Mn2O3 is a promising OER catalyst for water splitting devices.									43	0	0	0	0	0	43			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000402706700002

By introducing Cu into the 2nd surface layer of a Pt(111) single crystal, the surface reactivity was tuned. In both 0.1(M) NaOH and 0.1(M) KOH, the optimal catalyst should exhibit OH binding circa 0.1 eV weaker than Pt(111), via a Sabatier volcano; this observation suggests that the reaction is mediated via the same surface bound intermediates as in acid, in contrast to previous reports. In 0.1(M) KOH, the alloy catalyst at the peak of the volcano exhibits a maximum activity of 101 +/- 8 mAcm(-2) at 0.9 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).

However, the purification of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and the removal of internally confined metal impurities, without compromising the CNT structural integrity, have proved to be a great challenge. The presence of inherent metal impurities has increased the complexity and health risks associated with the use of MWCNTs. In this study, we developed a low-cost purification strategy to effectively remove encapsulated metal impurities. MWCNTs synthesized by Ni-catalyzed chemical vapor deposition (CVD), were annealed in the presence of melamine under Ar-atmosphere protection at 1000 degrees C. Electron microscopy indicated that the pyrolysis of MWCNTs in the presence of melamine induces the leaching of encapsulated Ni particles via the tube open-end or the defect sites found along the MWCNTs. With this method, the leached impurities were shown to be more susceptible and accessible to acid purification. Upon acid treatment, ultrapure MWCNTs with trace amounts of metallic impurities (< 0.01 wt%) can be achieved. Alternatively, the leached metal nanoparticles could serve as highly efficient electrocatalytically active sites for oxygen evolution reactions with a turn over frequency (TOF) of 0.61 s(-1).									21	0	0	0	1	1	21			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000428848400014

Kongoli, F; Reddy, RG		Thermodynamic and kinetic properties of copper-sulfur-oxygen melt								SOHN INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ADVANCED PROCESSING OF METALS AND MATERIALS, VOL 1: THERMO AND PHYSICOCHEMICAL PRINCIPLES: NON-FERROUS HIGH-TEMPERATURE PROCESSING								273	+						2006	2006	A characteristic feature of the macrokinetics of the interaction process is the presence of two specifically defined areas of oxidation which had a linear time dependence. The effect of variables, such as residual sulphur content of the melt, temperature and the oxidation potential of the gas phase, on the macrokinetics of oxidation arc investigated. Phase composition and structure of products of solidification of partially oxidised melts and thermodynamic properties pentaining to Cu-S-O melts are used to analyze the macrokinetic behaviour and mechanisms of the interaction.The process of interaction of sulfide copper melts with oxygen may be considered as a disproportional absorption process and its mechanism is based on localized interaction on the surface and inside the melt volume.Superficial processes include also the process of primary chemisorption of oxygen by melts at place of metal-metal donor bonds proceeding with formation of oxysulfide liquid solutions and volumetric decomposition of the latte accompanied by evolution of sulfur dioxide and metallization of sulfide melts. It is the degree of dynamic balance of such interaction processes that determines specific individual features of the macro-kinetics and mechanism of oxidation of sulfide copper solutions with oxygen in the gas phase.

In this work, IrOx nanoparticles uniformly deposited on niobium-doped TiO2 (IrOx/Nb0.1Ti0.9O2) by a sol-gel method are employed as reversal tolerant anodes (RTAs) for PEMFCs. The membrane electrode assembly (MEA) with this RTA possesses a reversal tolerance time of 29.1 min, which is the best result among all the as-prepared MEAs. Meanwhile, the decrease in the cell voltage of this MEA after reversal testing is only 61 mV at a current density of 1.2 A cm(-2) with a degradation rate of 11.1%. The improved reversal tolerance is attributed, in part, to the uniformly distributed IrOx nanoparticles, boosting the oxygen evolution reaction and, in part, to avoid the carbon oxidation reaction by the application of a noncarbon support. This result can lay a fundamental basis for the application of RTA based on a noncarbon support to improve the anode reversal tolerance for PEMFCs.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2574-0962			WOS:000812972000001

X-ray diffraction analysis confirms the formation of two distinct crystalline structures, NiMnO3 and NiMn2O4. The Transmission electron microscope analysis reveals that the as-prepared NiMnO3 exhibits an average size in the range of 50-100 nm. X-ray photoelectron microscope results show that the metal oxides (Mn and Ni) exhibit different oxidation states in the composite. The NiMnO3 exhibits higher electrochemical performance than NiMn2O4 owing to the higher surface area. In a three-electrode configuration, NiMnO3 delivers a capacitance of 230 F g(-1) at 1.0 A g(-1) and withstands 67% of its initial charge storage capability up to 2000 cycles. The asymmetric aqueous two-electrode (NiMnO3/RGO) set-up delivers a capacitance of 33 F g(-1) with an energy density of 8.4 Wh Kg(-1) and power density of 675 W Kg(-1 )at 1 A g(-1). Besides, the NiMnO3 is a good electro-catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction with a low over-potential of 256 mV vs RHE at 10 mA cm(-2) and stable up to 20 h.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000582503700011		
J	Costentin, Cyrille								Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer Catalyst: Heterogeneous Catalysis. Application to an Oxygen Evolution Catalyst								ACS CATALYSIS				10	14			7958	7967		10.1021/acscatal.0c02532				JUL 17 2020	2020	Proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) catalysts are investigated in the framework of cyclic voltammetry (CV). We analyze heterogeneous catalysts and provide a detailed kinetic analysis of the various responses expected in the case of a PCET catalyst following either stepwise or concerted pathways. Both buffered solution and nonbuffered aqueous media are considered. In the first case, we show that, besides possible limitation by buffer diffusion, the PCET sequence may be rate-limiting. CV wave shape, position, and intensity are discussed in terms of thermodynamic and kinetic penalties associated with each mechanism. When water is the proton acceptor in aqueous solution, diffusion of hydronium ions away from the electrode surface is a key parameter, and we show that, for stepwise processes, the equilibrated PCET is not the optimal catalytic response. Finally, we illustrate this formal analysis with an electrodeposited cobalt oxide behaving as a PCET catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction in phosphate buffer. The PCET is at equilibrium, and the rate-determining step is a chemical step, presumably O-O bond formation, but the CV is controlled by buffer diffusion in the investigated conditions.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800049

However, due to the slow kinetics of electrochemical oxygen reactions, the charge and discharge processes of a rechargeable metal-air battery must be catalyzed by using bi-functional catalysts that are active towards both the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions. This review focuses on recent developments in bi-functional catalysts and their catalytic activity in relation to materials composition, morphology, and crystal structure obtained through various synthetic techniques. The discussion is divided into sections based on the main types of recent bi-functional catalysts such as transition metal-and carbon-based materials, and hybrids which consist of the two. The subsections are then divided based on the metal substituents, types of dopant, degree of doping, and defect densities, discussing the effects of composition. In parallel, morphological effects on the catalytic activity, such as unique nanostructured design, surface area enhancements, and porosity, are also discussed. Currently, bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst research is heading in the direction of reducing the loading of precious metals, and developing cost-competitive non-precious metal-and carbon-based catalysts to enable commercialization of rechargeable metal-air batteries for various applications including electric-drive vehicles and smart-grid energy storage. To understand the origin of bi-functional catalytic activity, future catalyst research should be conducted in combination with in situ characterizations, and computational studies, which will allow exploitation of active sites to maximize the efficacy of bi-functional catalysts.									338	24	0	0	10	1	347			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000376035300002

At 0.7 g/L of LCO and 2 mM of PMS, more than 96 % of bisphenol A (BPA) was removed within 60 mM over a wide pH range of 3.1 - 9.1. The cycle of surface Cu(II)/Cu (I) redox couple and lattice oxygen (O2-)/O-2 were responsible for PMS activation. Besides, the OVs with localized electrons may directly activate PMS through single electron transfer pathway to generate surface-bound hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) and sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-), as well as less singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) for BPA degradation. The evolution of center dot OH, SO4 center dot and O-1(2) were revealed by EPR tests. Briefly, this study provides the mechanistic understanding of A(2)BO(4)-type perovskite in activation of PMS for water treatment.									45	1	0	0	21	0	46			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000623588500003

However, their structure flexibility under working conditions remains a great challenge for identifying their active structures. In this work, OER performances of manganese oxide electrocatalysts with representative phase compositions (birnessite, bixbyite) were examined using operando-Raman spectroscopy. The results indicate that catalysts containing birnessite composition do not exhibit apparent OER activity before an charging activation process. Shifting of Raman peaks around similar to 640 cm(-1) can serve as an indicator for predicting their OER onset potentials. The amorphization of mixed-phase catalyst is in favor of this activation and reduces the OER onset potential by 120 mV. Moreover, the coexistence of bixbyite-like Mn(III) center and amorphized birnessite composition combines their abilities of catalyzing both electrochemical and chemical steps, creating a more bias-efficient reaction channel. This leads to the lowest Tafel slope and improved activity in the high overpotential region, suggesting that amorphous OER catalysts with structural flexibility can facilitate the OER kinetics.

In this paper, we have performed, for the first time, an assessment of the bifunctional catalytic activity of C-doped BN nanoflakes for oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions (ORR and HER) using quantum chemical calculations. A comparison between single and double C-doped systems, which in turn have one and two unpaired electrons, has been carefully carried out. 'While single and double C-doped systems are both catalytically active for ORR, the latter with multiple active sites is more efficient for ORR than the former with only one active site. However, the former is more efficient for HER than the latter on which hydrogen too strongly adsorbs. To explore the catalytic performance of our systems, we discuss the results in comparison with many functionalized materials reported recently. We believe that our study reveals new possibilities for the development of ORR/HER bifunctional catalysts using metal-free C-doped BN-based materials.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			1932-7447			WOS:000445711100005

Herein, a Pb-Sn-Ca/alpha-PbO2/8-PbO2-Mn2O3 (PSC/PbO2-Mn2O3) composite electrode is fabricated via a simple two-step process. First, porous Mn2O3 microspheres are synthesized by the solvothermal method. Then, a PSC/PbO2-Mn2O3 composite electrode with a special embedded structure is prepared through the introduction of Mn2O3 by composite electrodeposition. The low OER overpotential (621 mV) of the PSC/PbO2-Mn2O3 (12 g L-1) composite electrode is reduced by 445 mV compared with that of the industrial Pb-(0.76 wt%) Ag electrode at a current density of 50 mA cm-2. In addition, it shows a service life of up to 91 h at a high operation current density of 1.5 A cm-2 in acidic media (3.06 g L-1H+), which indicates its excellent stability. Therefore, this work not only demonstrates a design for a durable and high-efficiency electrocatalyst for acidic water oxidation but also provides strategies for the synthesis of advanced electrocatalytic electrodes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000868934200004

Various Ir1-yNiyOx electrocatalyst combinations were prepared by reactive sputtering and subjected to high-throughput electrochemical screening using a Au/SiO2 wafer. The best performing electrocatalysts were identified and subjected to single electrode electrochemical and physical characterisation using glassy carbon disk electrodes as the substrate. Rotating disk electrode (RDE) analysis included linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) before and after short term chronopotentiometry (CP). Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the controlled synthesis of thin film electrocatalysts by utilising reactive sputtering, and confirmed Ir dissolution which occurred during CP measurements. Overall, the Ir1-yNiyOx electrocatalyst combinations containing higher amounts of Ir (Ir92Ni8Ox, Ir68Ni32Ox and Ir62Ni38Ox) performed the best of the evaluated mixed metal oxide electrocatalysts. However, evident from this study was that excellent mass-specific activity (current per mass of noble metal) was not exhibited by the mixed metal oxides when compared to Ni.

The construction of heterostructure electrocatalysts with efficient catalytic activity by combining 2D nanosheet metal organic frameworks (MOFs) with other earth-rich transition metal oxide materials is a compelling study. Herein, a novel (Fe2O3)(0.36)@Ni-MOF heterostructure nanosheets has been synthesized by a rapid one-pot hydrothermal procedure as an efficient OER catalyst. (Fe2O3)(0.36)@Ni-MOF exhibited prominent OER property with the overpotential of 230 mV at10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 66.7 mV dec(-1) and ignorable activity decay after 20 h long-term test at 10 mA cm(-2). The excellent properties of (Fe2O3)(0.36)@Ni-MOF nanocomposite could be attribute to the vast amounts of active sites exposed by the nanosheets and ultrasmall size nanoparticles, and the electronic interaction between Fe2O3 and Ni-MOF in the heterostructure. This work presents an attractive tactics for the preparation of heterostructure catalysts with good OER catalytic performance.

However, such surface modifications should also be designed to not interfere with the bandgap photoexcitation of the light-absorbing materials. In the present study, cobalt-phosphate-loaded TiO2 (CoPi/TiO2) nanoparticles were used to modify a particulate BaTaO2N (BTON) photoanode, resulting in an improvement in the photoanode PEC OER performance. The TiO2 nanoparticles functioned as a transparent and conductive support with a high specific surface area to immobilize CoPi on the photoanode surface. Electrochemical measurements revealed that the CoPi/TiO2 modification led to improved reaction kinetics and that the electrochemically active surface area of the CoPi cocatalysts deposited on the electrode surface substantially increased by a factor of 7.45 as a result of the TiO2 modification. The CoPi/TiO2 modification increased the number of active sites on the surface of the particulate BTON photoanode and minimized the harmful influence of light shielding, thereby accelerating the OER kinetics.

Electrocatalytic experiments reveal that synthesized 1 wt% RuO2 loaded CeO2 (1-RuO2/CeO2) showed superior OER activity. A quite low over-potential of 350 mV is required to attain a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) (eta(10)), with a Tafel slope of 74 mVdec(-1) for OER in 1 M KOH solution.

However, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the air electrode of Zn-air batteries both suffer from slow kinetics, limiting their commercialization development. Herein, we prepared Co, N, and S co-doped hollow carbon nanoboxes (Co-N/S-CNBs) rich in topological defects using polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) as a sulfur-rich carbon source. Critically, by utilizing the self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS), PPS can avoid melting, while simultaneously enabling the catalyst to take on a unique hollow structure. Additional post-treatment to introduce Co and N atoms as active centers further increases the defect sites and microporous structures of the catalyst. Under alkaline electrolytes, the Co-N/S-CNBs enabled Zn-air batteries to exhibit excellent bifunctional catalytic activity for both ORR and OER, surpassing commercial catalysts. Chemical analysis showed that the cracking loss of small molecules from PPS during pyrolysis is the main reason for the formation of topological defects, where the defect sites act as active centers to enhance the catalytic performance. Overall, this work provides new insights into the mechanism of how defects are formed in such a catalyst, as well as shows how a high-performance bifunctional electrocatalyst can be utilized for practical Zn-air batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000809986700001	35621374

The density-functional theory studies suggest that the oxidation process could proceed with several nonelectrochemical (spontaneous) intermediate steps, following the initial electrochemical hydroxyl-to-oxo conversion. More specifically, the single oxo sites Co-IV=O can hop (via surface proton/electron hopping) to form oxo pair Co-IV(=O)-O-Co-IV=O, which will undergo nucleophilic attack by a water molecule and form the hydroperoxide Co-III-OOH. Encounter with another oxo would generate a superoxo Co-III-OO, followed by the O-2 release. Finally the addition and deprotonation of a fresh water molecule will restart the catalytic cycle by forming the hydroxyl Co-III-OH at this active site. Our theoretical investigations indicate that all nonelectrochemical reactions are kinetically fast and thermodynamically downhill. This hypothesis is supported by recent in situ spectroscopic observations of surface superoxo that is stabilized by hydrogen bonding to adjacent hydroxyl group as an intermediate on fast-kinetics Co catalytic site.									63	1	0	0	8	0	63			2155-5435			WOS:000381236700092

Nanostructures are widely used as electrocatalysts, but the location and structure of the active sites within the nanostructure are often unknown. This information is hidden in conventional bulk measurements due to ensemble averaging, hindering direct structure-activity correlation. Herein, we use a single-entity electrochemical approach to reveal the heterogeneity in electrocatalysts via scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM). Using hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) nanorods as the model catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the electrocatalytic activity is measured at individual nanorods. Finer mapping within a single nanorod shows that the OER activity is consistently higher at the body portion vs the tip of the nanorod. Our results directly suggest the benefit of synthesizing longer hematite nanorods for better OER performance. The origin of the enhanced local activity is explained by the larger fraction of {001} facet exposed on the body compared to the tip. The finding goes beyond OER on hematite nanorods, highlighting the critical role of single-entity activity mapping and colocalized structural characterization in revealing active sites in electrocatalysis.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000799109400007	35298886

The physical composition of synthesized solid phase was analysed through particle size distribution (PSD), whereas the coating was investigated for its capacitive response and activity in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The oxide phase was found highly polydisperse, with overlapped fractions within rather narrow particle size range and clear tendency toward agglomeration. The smallest particles and their best resolved fractions were synthesized at the temperature just above the boiling point of the reaction medium, and quite below the chloride-to-oxide conversion temperature. Consequently, the highest OER activity was registered for RuO2/Ti anodes prepared from this sample, with strong indication of different oxide structure, with respect to the electrodes prepared from samples synthesized at higher temperatures. However, the coatings from high temperature samples have considerably higher capacitance than those synthesized at lower temperatures. These findings can be rather correlated to the MW temperature-dependent oxide structure than to different morphology analysed through PSD.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0352-5139			WOS:000408085700007

However, in addition to the fact that the onset potential is an undefined physico-chemical value which is dependent on the sensitivity of the used potentiostat its determination using voltammetry at the catalyst-modified electrode surface may be superimposed by additional Faradaic reactions e.g. from redox conversions of the catalyst material or corrosion processes. Gas-evolving electrodes suffer additionally from the dynamics of gas bubble formation and departure leading to inherent limitations of voltammetric studies directly performed at the catalyst-modified electrode. Nanometer-sized electrodes accurately positioned by means of shearforce-based constant-distance mode SECM are proposed for the highly sensitive determination of the onset potential of microcavity electrodes filled with different perovskites as oxygen evolution catalysts. Double barrel microcavity electrodes are additionally suggested for the simultaneous investigation of two catalysts. They enable direct referencing of a catalyst with a benchmark catalyst material in a single experiment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, the integration of a six-electron involved anodic half-reaction-selective electrooxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural into 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) on a hierarchically layered double hydroxide (CoFe@NiFe) with a cathodic HER in a two-chamber system is reported. The overall reaction reaches 38 mA cm(-2) at 1.40 V and exhibits 100% selectivity to yield FDCA and a nearly 100% Faraday efficiency with hydrogen production of 901 mu mol cm(-2). Several operando techniques confirm that the trivalent nickel species in the CoFe@NiFe catalyst are mainly responsible for this 100%-selective oxidation reaction. This integrated overall reaction is thus a new strategy to utilize cheap catalysts and biomass derivatives to simultaneously produce value-added chemicals and sustainable energy materials, and eventually to solve current challenges of energy depletion and environmental pollution.									27	0	0	0	0	0	27			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000651559400001

Replacing the OER with the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) process with a low thermodynamic potential would significantly reduce energy consumption. Here we developed porous V-doped Ni3N nanosheets arrays grown on nickel foam (labeled V-Ni3N/NF) by a hydrothermal and subsequent nitridation process. As a bifunctional electrocatalyst, the V-Ni3N/NF shows striking catalytic performances for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and UOR, which require low potentials of -83 mV and 1.361 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Furthermore, when applying V-Ni3N/NF as both the cathode and anode for the HER and UOR, the assembled electrolyzer needs small cell voltages of 1.416 and 1.543 V to achieve 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), which are 180 and 243 mV lower than that in traditional water electrolysis, as well as displaying remarkable stability over 200 h. The excellent catalytic performances can be attributed to the self-supported porous nanosheet arrays on 3D NF, the intrinsic conductivity of V-Ni3N, and the optimized Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption after V doping. Our result suggests that this attractive material has promising applications in energy-saving H-2 production and urea-related waste water treatment.									30	0	0	0	3	0	30			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000621407000033

A poor solar-to-hydrogen efficiency is usually related to a mismatch between the internal quantum efficiency of photon-induced hole generation and the apparent quantum yield of hydrogen. This waste of photogenerated holes is unwanted yet unavoidable. Although great progress has been made, we are still far away from the required level of dexterity to deal with the associated challenges of wasted holes and its consequential chemical effects that have placed one of the greatest bottlenecks in attaining high solar-to-hydrogen efficiency. A critical assessment of the hole and its related phenomena in solar hydrogen production would, therefore, pave the way moving forward. In this regard, we focus on the contextual and conceptual understanding of the dynamics and kinetics of photogenerated holes and its critical role in driving redox reactions, with the objective of guiding future research. The main reasons behind and consequences of unused holes are examined and different approaches to improve overall efficiency are outlined. We also highlight yet unsolved research questions related to holes in solar fuel production.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6				2397-3358		WOS:000750272900001

Efficient oxygen reduction is achieved following four electron pathway by CuPcMoS2 whereas partial reduction is done through two electron process by CuPc and MoS2 separately. Long-time durability test reveals almost 97.6% retention after 8000s that eventually dictate us that CuPc-MoS2 heterostructure can be the efficient cathode electrocatalyst for future generation fuel cell.

However, the sluggish kinetics of OER catalysts seriously impedes the efficiency of these aforementioned clean devices. Herein, a series of bimetallic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with tunable electronegativity (metal ionic electronegativity [MIE]) are prepared by precisely controlling the metal composition for efficient OER. Moreover, an experimental result-derived volcano plot is first unveiled by presenting the correlation of the MIE and OER kinetic rate (Tafel slope) on the surface of the MOFs-based electrocatalysts. Remarkably, a Ni0.9Fe0.1 MOF fabricated and based on the proposed electronegative equilibrium rationales, delivers a low overpotential of 206mV at 10mAcm(-2) and 270mV at 50mAcm(-2) along with a long-term stability in 1m KOH, superior than the previous reported catalysts. The excellent performance is ascribed to the MIE-induced interface charge transfer resistance and intermediate adsorption resistance adjustment. The second metal introduction causes the formation of unsaturated metal sites during the electronegative equilibrium process, leading to adjustable OER kinetic rate. These findings pave the way to designing highly active MOF-based OER catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2699-9412			WOS:000783862200003

However, the detailed catalytic reaction steps and adsorbate-driven interactions on the surface morphology under practical operating conditions are still unclear. Here, we report the water-assisted surface reconstruction of the bimetallic Pt3Co(111) surface using near-ambient pressure scanning tunneling microscopy (NAP-STM) in a humid O-2 environment. The segregated CoOx clusters are selectively transferred to the Co(II) oxide/hydroxide layer at 0.1 Torr of H2O/O-2 gas mixture at elevated temperature. In contrast, this drastic phase transition is limited and dependent on the partial pressure of water because the nanoscale CoO islands are formed with 0.1 Torr of the N-2/O-2 gas mixture. Synchrotron radiation in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements also support the water-assisted evolution of the Co(OH)(2) species. These morphologic modulations not only explain the surface degradation process of the bimetallic Pt-Co catalysts but also indicate the active formation of CoOx/CoOOH intermediates during energy conversion.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2574-0962			WOS:000504953500027

Here, we performed compositional engineering of BVO-varying Bi/V ratio and inclusion of different concentrations of Mo dopants. Through physical and chemical analyses, we found that the materials properties of BiVO4 and its PEC performance were highly sensitive to the chemical composition. Our optimized BiVO4-based photoanode exhibited the highest photocurrent density among the state-of-the-art SnO2/BiVO4 heterojunction photoanodes reported in the literature: 2.62 and 4.20 mA cm(-2) measured at 1.23 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode for the oxygen evolution reaction and sulfite oxidation reaction, respectively. A complete picture explaining various PEC performances with different chemical compositions via the band structure of BiVO4 has emerged. This work points to the importance of specific control of the chemical composition in achieving highly efficient BiVO4-based photoanodes, which will guide future research directions in the fabrication of other high performance photoelectrodes.									42	2	0	0	0	0	43			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000419832100029

Employing semiconducting P3HT as a stabilizing agent produced well dispersed P3HT@NiO NPs with uniform size distribution (2.5 +/- 1.2 nm). For comparison, NiO NPs stabilized with the small molecule 3-hexylthiophene (3HT@NiO NPs) were also synthesized and characterized as reference material. The physiochemical properties of the developed hybrid P3HT@NiO were fully characterized using UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The electrocatalytic activities of the developed semiconducting polymer-stabilized NPs were evaluated for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of water splitting. Our work reveals the electronic communication between P3HT and NiO NPs and demonstrates that P3HT@NiO NPs exhibit superior catalytic activity with an overpotential of 310 mV when compared to the reference 3HT@NiO NPs which exhibited an overpotential 560 mV. These results suggest that the heteroatom-containing pi-conjugated semiconducting polymers can be employed as electrocatalytic performance enhancing and stabilizing ligands for the synthesis of ultrafine metal-based NPs as efficient electrocatalytic platforms.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-8995	1097-4628		WOS:000800562700001

Here, we propose a feasible strategy of changing the local coordination chemical environment of the active cations via introducing hetero-polyatomic anions based on the crystal field theory. A new type of two-dimensional Co-NO3-OAC[x:y]-hexamine (HMT) catalyst is first prepared in a water bath (OAC= CH3COO-). It is discovered that adding OAC- into nanosheets containing NO3- can regulate both the morphologies and the electronic structure of as-prepared Co-based catalysts. As a result, the optimized Co-NO3-OAC[6:4]-HMT nanosheet aggregates exhibits an overpotential as low as 307 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope (62 mV/dec). Moreover, the voltage attenuation of electrolysis in the 1 M KOH alkaline medium for 10 h is only 8 mV. This superior electrochemical performance can be attributed to the induction effect of heteroepolyatomic anions. Our discovery provides a new insight into understanding the design of electrocatalysis based on anionic coordination chemistry. (C)& nbsp;2021 Elsevier Ltd.

By combining the scaling and Bronsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) relationships that are determined for these sites, it is shown that the activity of a site is controlled by the redox potential for oxidation of the site. On the basis of this, a kinetics-based design strategy is presented for identifying the optimal active site at a given electrode potential. This design strategy is shown to be valid regardless of whether the rate-limiting water addition step occurs electrochemically or nonelectrochemically, as long as certain conditions are met. Another finding is that the BEP relations are sensitive to the structure of the active site, with sites reacting through mu(3)-oxo species having the most favorable relations. Finally, the kinetics-based design strategy is compared with the commonly used thermodynamics-based design strategy, and it is shown that the former is able to identify a site with equal or greater activity than the latter at the same computational cost.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000463844500078

Although chemically simple, this reaction is difficult to implement due to the problem of the multiple valence states of iron and to an operating temperature above 1811 K. Thermal, chemical, and electrical conditions have been identified based on thermodynamic considerations to carry out this reaction in a laboratory device. Experiments were undertaken to determine the contribution of the thermal level to the decomposition of iron oxide and to estimate the electronic current resulting from iron multiple valence states. The production of liquid iron was obtained resulting in recoverable samples produced at liquid state and from a faradaic process checked in real time by its accompanying anodic oxygen evolution.									26	1	0	0	1	0	27			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000419985800011

Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have been used as a green sustainable media to act as both solvent and structure-inducing agent in the synthesis of hierarchical nanomaterials. In this work, the DESs-assisted synthesis of flower-structured BiOCl/BiVO4 (BOC/BVO) with g-C3N4 (BOC/BVO/g-CN) ternary heterojunctions was achieved by using a simple wet-chemical method, providing good acidic and alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. BOC/BVO/g-CN-15 achieved an enhanced photocatalytic activity for OER with an overpotential of 570 mV in 1 m H2SO4 and 220 mV in 1 m KOH electrolyte at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with excellent stability and extraordinary durability of the catalyst. The ternary heterojunctions displayed extended lifetimes for photogenerated charges and enhanced the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, which is helpful to enhance the photocatalytic OER. Furthermore, the photocatalytic performance of the ternary heterojunctions in aqueous solution was demonstrated through photocatalytic dye degradation of methyl orange (MO) as a model pollutant, resulting in 95 % degradation of 20 ppm of MO in 210 min under the irradiation of a 35 W Xe arc lamp. This work not only provides new insight into the design of catalysts by using green solvents but also into the design of highly efficient metal-free OER photocatalysts for applications in acidic and alkaline media.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000535041700027	32103631

While a variety of chemical modifications have thus been attempted in many complex oxides to induce a change of electronic states at catalytically active sites, few studies to clarify the influence of local crystal structures on the electronic states under the same composition have been reported. Here we compare the electrocatalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) between amorphous and crystalline perovskite nickelates in a thin-film form, when Fe is added as an active site. We identify that the improvement of the OER activity by Fe in amorphous films, where the atom arrangement is random, is insensitive to the method of Fe doping. In contrast, an order of magnitude difference in OER activity is induced in crystalline films, strongly depending on the resulting structure variation during doping. Theoretical calculations also consistently show a notable increase in the density of Fe 3d states beneath the Fermi level for exceptionally high activity. Our study demonstrates that the atomic-scale structure in crystalline oxide catalysts should not be overlooked as a key parameter for understanding the enhancement of OER catalysis.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000717072900001

Herein, we study the interfacial properties of copper-palladium core-shell nanostructures in a phosphate buffer solution under two different conditions. At low potentials, we show that selective interaction with dopamine over ascorbic acid and uric acid enabled selective analysis of dopamine. At high applied potentials, oxygen evolution reactions were inhibited by the adsorption of histamine at the interface. The adsorption was demonstrated to be influenced by the concentration, enabling the highly sensitive detection of histamine by the electrochemical impedimetric method. Both analytes exhibited excellent sensitivity with linear ranges at low concentrations. Using this strategy, dopamine could be estimated in a linear range of 100 nM to 3 mM with a limit of detection as low as 12 nM while histamine provided a linear range from 1 pM to 1 mu M. These insights of adsorption of the analytes at the interface provide an opportunity for the fabrication of advanced sensor development and achieving unexplored horizons of interfacial electrochemistry.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2574-0970		WOS:000657373800078

The electrolyte exhibits unique vibrational signatures from stimulated Raman spectroscopy. Such an electrolyte exhibits unique characteristics compared to aqueous acidic electrolytes: 1) higher (de)protonation potential for a lower desolvation energy of protons, 2) better cycling stability by dissolution suppression, and 3) higher Coulombic efficiency owing to the lack of oxygen evolution reaction. Two non-aqueous proton full cells exhibit better cycling stability, higher Coulombic efficiency, and less self-discharge compared to the aqueous counterpart.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000571863600001	32805079

Low-cost and efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have been studied to overcome the sluggish kinetics of OER, which is considered to be a bottleneck that affects the overall efficiency of water splitting. However, the atomic-level understanding and control of the catalyst surface still remains elusive. Here, we show that methylamine treatment of manganese oxide nanoparticles can effectively control their surface charge and enhance their OER catalytic activity under neutral condition. Methylamine treatment can reduce the overpotential for OER by nearly 100 mV at the current density 5 mA cm(-2). Through spectroscopic studies, potentiometric titration, and zeta potential analysis, we discovered that methylamine does not exist on the surface after methylamine treatment but deprotonates the surface of nano-particles and induce additional negative charge on the surface. Surprisingly, treatment with not only methylamine but other amines can also improve the OER performance and the catalytic activity of the amine treated nanoparticles is influenced by the pK(a) values of amines.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000463960000014

The time dependence of the electron density during plasma decay is measured using microwave interferometry. The time evolution of the charged particle density, ion composition, and electron temperature is simulated numerically. It is shown that, under the given conditions, the discharge plasma is dominated for the most time by O (2) (+) ions and plasma decay is determined by dissociative and three-body electron-ion recombination. As in the previous studies performed for air and oxygen plasmas, agreement between measurements and calculations is achieved only under the assumption that the rate of three-body recombination of molecular ions is much greater than that for atomic ions. The values of the rate constant of three-body recombination of electrons with D-2 (+) ions in a wide range of electron temperatures (500-5500 K), as well as for thermal (300 K) electrons, are obtained by processing the experimental results.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			1063-780X	1562-6938		WOS:000369017100008

However, objective comparisons of the performance of heteroelement-doped catalysts are complicated by the lack of standardization both in the electrochemical tests and physicochemical analysis. Herein, we use a unified protocol for evaluating the catalytic activities of heteroelement-doped NiFe-LDHs and explore the reasons for the differences in their catalytic performance. Some regular results are found from comparing the properties of the heteroelement-doped catalysts: (1) the introduction of P/S/Se can optimize the redox behaviors of Ni species, which is conducive to regulating adsorption energy of intermediates and the formation of high-valent active sites; (2) the specific area of catalysts was expanded after heteroelements doping, ensuring a more favorable structure for heterogeneous catalysis; (3) All P/S/Se-doped catalysts showed better activities when compared to the original NiFe LDHs in alkaline solutions, and the catalysts doped with S showed the best performance (Se < P < S).

After pyrolyzing, the flower like and hollow spherical like morphology of NiO nanoparticles was successfully inherited from the initial MOF-based templates. The electrochemical studies demonstrated that the porous NiO hallow spheres unveiled a better supercapacitive performance (specific capacitance (C-s) = 1058 F g(-1) at current density (j) = 2 A g(-1)) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activity (overpotential (eta) = 323 mV) compared to porous NiO flowers (C-s = 857 F g(-1) at j = 2 A g(-1) and eta = 346 mV). Moreover, excellent capacity retention of over 93% was obtained in porous NiO-hs nanoparticles even after 5000 cycles. The fabricated NiO//Fe2O3 asymmetric supercapacitor delivered an energy density (E) of 35.75 W h Kg(-1) under power density (P) of 780 W kg(-1) and showed promising stability over 3000 cycles. Considering the ease of preparation and high catalytic activity and supercapacitive performance, these prous NiO hallow structures can be considered as a potential electrode material for next generation energy storage devices and OER catalysts.									23	1	0	0	0	0	23			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000602995100002

SnO2 supported IrO2 nanocatalyst and its analogue with platinum enhancement were firstly synthesized for the oxygen evolution reaction. The effect of the introduction of Pt on the properties of the composites was explored by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electrochemical test. Interaction between the introduced Pt nanoparticles and the bulk IrO2/SnO2 was evidenced in XRD. Electrochemical characterization showed the enhanced activitiy for the Pt activated IrO2/SnO2, which was attributed to the cooperative effects of improved electric conductivity and synergistic effect of Pt and IrO2/SnO2. Furthermore, catalyst layers based on IrO2/SnO2 catalysts were optimized with respect to microstructures, pore volume and pore size distribution. The performance was obviously improved due to the appropriate porosity and pore size distribution.

A novel core-shell heterostructure composed of Cu3P nanowires with supported CoO nanosheets was synthesized. Owing to numerous active sites and synergistic effect, the as-prepared Cu3P@CoO was highly efficient for hydrogen evolution and outperformed the single component. The theoretical calculations demonstrate that Cu3P@CoO had a zero bandgap for the incorporation of metallic Cu3P, which can greatly accelerate the charge transfer. Besides, the adsorption free energy of intermediates on Cu3P@CoO can also be optimized, leading to a small energy barrier in the reaction pathway, and thereby an increased intrinsic activity. This work highlights the significance of exploiting the synergistic effect of the heterostructure on the charge transfer and intrinsic activity when designing highly efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000719506500001	34787156

Herein, a simple approach based on a metal-organic framework sacrificial template to preparing cobalt molybdenum nitride supported on nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets is reported. The porous structure of produced composite enables fast reaction kinetics, enhanced stability, and high corrosion resistance in critical seawater conditions. The cobalt molybdenum nitride-based electrocatalyst is tested toward both oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction half-reactions using the seawater electrolyte, providing excellent performances that are rationalized using density functional theory. Subsequently, the nitride composite is tested as a bifunctional catalyst for the overall splitting of KOH-treated seawater from the Mediterranean Sea.

The calculation of the total electronic energies and thermodynamic functions of the compounds involved in the reactions was performed by the density functional method with the hybrid exchange-correlation functional of Becke, Lee, Yang and Parr DFT B3LYP/6-311G** using the NWChem software package. The effect of the magnetic field on the individual stages of chain oxidation is associated with the evolution of radical pairs. It is assumed that the dipole-dipole interaction in a radical pair is not averaged by the diffusion of radicals and should be taken into account. To a large extent, the magnetic field effect (MFE) value is influenced by the ratio between the relaxation time of the oscillatory-excited state in the radical pair (t(vib)) and the relaxation time of the inter-combination transitions (t(st)). Although the developed technique refers to liquid-phase reactions, it can be used to study the MFE for oxidation of biologically significant compounds in multiphase systems, such as micelles, liposomes and membranes.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2312-7481		WOS:000786214600001

The results show a high oxygen evolution reaction catalytic activity of nickel-cobalt sulfide nanosheet arrays grown on carbon cloth (NiCo2S4 NS/CC) over the commercial benchmarking catalyst under both pH conditions. In particular, the NiCo2S4 NS/CC air cathode shows high discharge capacity, a narrow potential gap between discharge and charge, and superior cycle durability with reversibility, which exceeds that of commercial precious metal-based electrodes. The excellent performance of NiCo2S4 NS/CC in water electrolyzers and zinc-air batteries is mainly due to highly exposed electroactive sites with a rough surface, morphology-based advantages of nanosheet arrays, good adhesion between NiCo2S4 and the conducting carbon cloth, and the active layer formed of nickel-cobalt (oxy)hydroxides during water splitting. These results suggest that NiCo2S4 NS/CC could be a promising candidate as an efficient electrode for high-performance water electrolyzers and rechargeable zinc-air batteries.									34	1	0	0	2	0	34			2470-1343			WOS:000440617900020	31458992

All of them can electrolyze the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Among them, the optimum sample La-doped FeS2/NC-0.33 shows a low overpotential (eta) of 217/239 mV at 30/50 mA cm(-2), which is comparable and even superior to commercial RuO2 and many iron sulfide-based catalysts reported previously. Furthermore, La-doped FeS2/NC-0.33 exhibits long-term OER activity with the transformation of FeS2 -> FeOOH over 60 h electrolysis at 20 mA cm(-2). In addition, density functional theory (DFT) simulations reveal that the rate-determining steps on La-doped FeS2 and FeS2 (200) surfaces are the formation of O-2 and Fe*-OH, respectively, and La-doped FeS2 exhibits a less Delta G(max) value of 1.585 eV with a smaller eta value of 0.355 V, which is attributed to their different d-band centers before and after La-doping.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1466-8033		WOS:000797583200001

However, Proton-exchange membrane-based URFCs usually employ a significant amount of precious metal catalysts, e.g., up to 4 mg((Pt+IrO2)) cm(-2), to achieve high efficiency in round-trip operations. Here, we present a PEM-URFC electrode that uses only 0.8 mg((Pt+Ir)) cm(-2) without compromising the performance of URFC. IrO2-shells (70 nm) layered upon hemispherical Pt particles (Pt@IrO2) are formed using sequential electrodeposition over Ti-felt electrodes. A 100 % improvement in WE compared to performance without Pt supports and superior mass activity (44 A mg(Ir)(-1) at 2 V-cell) with an insignificant degradation rate of 155 mu V h(-1) at 0.4 A cm(-2) are demonstrated. In addition, high round-trip efficiency of 49 % at 0.4 A cm(-2) in URFC is achieved.									24	1	0	0	0	0	25			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000533148700035

It is also well documented that metal sites in high valence states are beneficial to the OER process. Herein, we combine the advantages of the above three methods to fabricate extraordinary catalysts just by facile adjusting the Fe content. The catalysts with different Fe contents exhibit excellent activity and outstanding stability beyond the yardstick material (RuO2) in alkaline condition. The resultant FeCoNi (oxy)hydroxide nanosheets is one of the most active trimetal-based oxygen evolution catalysts to date. Specifically, the resultant Fe-1.25(Co2Ni1)(2.5) (oxy)hydroxide can deliver a minimum overpotential of 212 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 52 mV dec(-1) and a negligible activity attenuation after excess 72h long-term test at 100 mA cm(-2). Most importantly, when use Fe-1.25(Co2Ni1)(2.5) (oxy)hydroxide as a water splitting anode, an electrolyzer delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a very low cell voltage of 1.51 V. This excellent performance is attributed to the large number of active sites exposed by the nanosheets, the active center of the catalyst to the higher valence state and the large number of oxygen defects produced. This work can provide more valuable insights to promote the development of the highly efficient oxygen evolution for applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000653229500032

The determined values were compared with the conductivity values calculated by a pH & Conductivity Calculator software. The results showed that when the temperature of the solution is increased the magnitude of the R-sol and therefore ohmic drop of the system decrease and after a defined temperature (150 degrees C for EIS and 180 degrees C for current interrupt) increase. The variations in the conductivity of the solution versus temperature calculated by the pH & Conductivity Calculator software were in more agreement with the impedance based R-sol values determined in this study. While investigation of the oxygen reduction reaction on platinum versus temperature showed that exactly at 180 degrees C (the temperature corresponding to minimum R-sol and ohmic drop values determined using the current interrupt technique) the oxygen reduction reaction reached its maximum rate and by further increasing the temperature the oxygen reduction rate decreased and the reaction mechanism switched from a mixed mass-charge transfer controlled process to a charge transfer controlled process. The experiment results revealed that the R-sol values determined by the current interrupt technique are more accurate than the values obtained by EIS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, cost-effective Bi2O3-x with oxygen vacancies was formed in situ on commercial bismuth powder by calcination at 453.15 K in atmosphere. Interestingly, defects introduced into Bi2O3-x simultaneously induced a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in the wavelength range of 600-1400 nm and enhanced the adsorption for CO2 molecules, which enabled efficient photocatalysis of CO2-to-CO (ca. 100 % selectivity) even under low-intensity near-IR light irradiation. Significantly, the apparent quantum yield for CO evolution at 940 nm reached 0.113 %, which is approximately 4 times that found at 450 nm. We also showed that the unique LSPR allows for the realization of a nearly linear dependence of photocatalytic CO production rate on light intensity and operating temperature. Finally, based on an IR spectroscopy study, an oxygen-vacancy induced Mars-van Krevlen mechanism was proposed to understand the CO2 reduction reactions.									82	5	0	0	9	0	82			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000587484500001	32939926

In this study, we constructed a self-supported electrode with ordered mesoporous carbon film coated carbon fibers as a substrate and Co doped FeS2 nanoparticles as catalytically active phase for the HER. The ordered mesoporous carbon served as nanoreactor to restrict the growth of sulfide particles and prevent them from agglomeration, leading to the formation of ultrafine and highly dispersed sulfide of similar to 5 nm, which enables the exposure of abundant active sites. Meanwhile, the Co atom doping enhanced the adsorption of the catalyst towards hydrogen, thereby improving its intrinsic activity. As a result, the electrode exhibited outstanding catalytic activity for the HER in acid electrolyte, manifesting a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 92 mV and a small Tafel slope of 59 mV dec(-1).									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000500415400001

Herein, a 3D NiO nanobelt electrode was synthesized by direct oxidation of nickel foam using the hydrothermal method. Electrochemical studies reveal that the 3D NiO nanobelt electrode exhibits excellent electro-catalytic activities for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with low onset overpotential, small Tafel slope, and very eminent electrochemical stability in the standard aqueous solution of 1.0 M KOH. More importantly, the OER activity of 3D NiO nanobelt can be enhanced by the wrapping of N-doped carbon (NiO@C), which can achieve an overpotential of 500 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 92 mV dec(-1), and distinguished electrochemical stability. This strategy provides a general route to prepare 3D nanostructured catalyst for water splitting by directly using transition-metal foam as metal source and substrate.									16	3	0	0	0	0	16			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000388437100011

This report systematically investigates the effect of nickel doping on the crystal structure, optical properties, and photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of the ZnInOS/In(OH)(3) nanocomposite (denoted as ZI-50). It is found that nickel doping could transform the phase of ZI-50 from two phases of ZnInOS and In(OH)(3) into a single phase with a ZnIn2S4 spinel structure. More importantly, all Ni-doped ZI-50 catalysts are nonstoichiometric and highly defective with a Zn(Zn,Ni,In)(2)(O,S)(4-x) spinel structure. 10% nickel precursor-doped ZI-50 as the best catalyst can achieve the highest hydrogen evolution reaction rate of 1700 mu mol/g.h, which is much higher than those of Ni-free ZI-50 (340 mu mol/g.h) and stoichiometric ZnIn2S4 (110 mu mol/g.h). A kinetic mechanism for enhancing photocatalytic hydrogen evolution based upon the cationic antisite defects and anionic oxygen vacancy was proposed and explained.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2574-0962			WOS:000745950700001

In this work, we have successfully synthesized a new heterostructured material in form of Ni nanoparticles modified V doped MoO2 supported by Ni foam (Ni/V-MoO2/NF) and applied it as an excellent HER electrocatalyst under alkaline conditions. The introduction of V can tune the morphology of material to be further regular, which is conducive to the exposure of active sites and mass transport. Meanwhile, the V doping and its resulting abundant oxygen vacancies can modulate the electronic structure and boost the conductivity, which benefits the improvement of electrocatalytic HER performance. Thus, compared with the non-V-doped contrast sample, the as-prepared Ni/V-MoO2/ NF has shown excellent and stable HER activity with a low overpotential of 13.1 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm-2 and Tafel slope of 34.8 mV dec-1.

However, the unsmooth mass transport channel, the collapse of the structure and insufficient intrinsic activities limits their potential for OER performance. In respond, the dense Fe-doped Co9S8 nanoparticles encapsulated by S, N co-incorporated carbon nanosheets (Fe-Co9S8@SNC) was proposed and synthesized via fast thermal treatment from ultrathin metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) nanosheets. In designed catalysts, the nanosheet configuration connected by nanoparticles retained rich access for permeation of electrolyte and precipitation of O-2 bubbles during OER process. Meanwhile, the outer carbon layer of Co9S8 provided additional catalytic activity while acting as armor to keep the structure stability. At the atomic scale, the doped Fe regulated the local charge density and the d-band center for facilitating desorption of oxygen intermediates. Benefiting from this multi-scale regulation strategy, the Fe-Co9S8@SNC displays an ultralow overpotential of 273 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) and small Tafel slope of 55.8 mV.dec(-1), which is even close to the benchmark RuO2 catalyst. This concept could provide valuable insights into the design of other catalysts for OER and beyond.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000662127100005

In this work, a new type of CoAl LDH doped with Ce and MoS2 was designed and prepared. The catalyst first prepared Ce-doped CoAl LDH (Ce-CoAl LDH) by co-precipitation and one-step hydrothermal method. Then, MoS2 was introduced between Ce-CoAl LDH layers by hydrothermal method. The double doping of Ce and MoS2 could significantly improve the electrocatalytic activity of CoAl LDH. At the current density of 10 mA/cm2, the potential of 5% Ce-CoAl LDH@MoS2 is 1.508 V, which is much lower than the 1.733 V of CoAl LDH. And the ECSA of 5% Ce-CoAL LDH@MoS2 (23.4 mF/cm2) is nearly 8 times that of CoAl LDH (7.9 mF/cm2). Its excellent OER performance benefits from the increase of active sites and the enhancement of conductivity.

In this work, a new 3D flower-like a-Co(OH)2 catalyst with high Co-NH2 active sites (referred to as a-Co(OH)2-NH2) is prepared. The Co-NH2 active sites are formed through the interactions between Co2} and-NH2 groups and exhibit higher electrocatalytic performance for OER in alkaline mediums, with a lower overpotential (300 mV at 10 mA cm-2), a flatter Tafel slope (75 mV dec-1) and a longer stability. Moreover, water splitting catalyzed by a-Co(OH)2-NH2 delivers 1.62 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm-2. The mechanism studies show that the OER electrocatalytic activity is closely related to the content of-NH2.

We present here density functional theory calculations with on-site Coulomb repulsion of the energetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on selected surfaces of pure and mixed Ni-Fe oxides that are possible candidates for the catalyst's active phase. The investigated surfaces are pure beta-NiOOH(01 (1) over bar5) and gamma-NiOOH(101), Fe-doped beta-NiOOH(01 (1) over bar5) and gamma-NiOOH(101), NiFe2O4(001), and Fe3O4(001). We find that Fe-doped beta-NiOOH(01 (1) over bar5) has by far the lowest overpotential (eta = 0.26 V), followed by NiFe2O4(001) (eta = 0.42 V). Our results indicate that Fe-doped beta-NiOOH and, to a lesser extent, NiFe2O4 could be the phases responsible for the enhanced OER activity of NiOx when it is doped with Fe.									328	8	0	0	22	0	329			2155-5435			WOS:000338807100015

We here report a rapid synthesis of spinel-type CoMn2O4 nanodots (NDs, below 3 nm) monodispersed on graphene for highly-efficient,electrocatalytic,ORR/OER in Oil M KOH solution. The preparation of the composite involves the reaction of manganese and cobalt salts in mixed surfactant solvent water solution at mild temperature (120 degrees C) and air. CoMn2O4 NDs homogeneously distributed on carbonaceous substrates show strong coupling and facile charge transfer. Remarkably, graphene-supported CoMn2O4 NDs,showed 20 mV higher ORR half-wave potential, twice the kinetic current, and better catalytic durability compared to the benchmark carbon-supported Pt nanoparticles (Pt/C). Moreover, CoMn2O4/reduced graphene oxide afforded electrocatalytic OER with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low potential-of 1.54 V and a small Tafel slope of similar to 56 mV/dec. This indicates that the composite of CoMn(2)Q(4) nanodots monodispersed on graphene is promising as highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts of ORR and OER that can be used in the areas of fuel Cells and rechargeable metal air batteries.									96	7	0	0	1	0	99			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000355638100052	25989252

The photochemical production of H(2)O(2)was achieved at a millimolar level per hour under visible-light irradiation along with 100 % apparent quantum yield (in 360-450 nm region) and 96 % selectivity in an electrochemical system (0.1 V vs. RHE). Spectroscopic analysis in spatiotemporal resolution and theoretical calculations revealed that the synergistic association of alkali and sulfur dopants in the polymeric matrix promoted the interlayer charge separation and polarization of trapped electrons for preferable oxygen capture and reduction in ORR kinetics. This work highlights the key features that are responsible for controlling the photocatalytic activity and selectivity toward the two-electron ORR, which should be the basis of further development of solar H(2)O(2)production.									112	4	0	0	15	0	113			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000543767400001	32430972

For the practical applications, the inexpensive non-noble metals catalysts with highly activity and stable need to be explored and utilized. Herein, a strategy for the preparation of a bi-functional rambutan shaped oxygen electrocatalyst is presented. The novel electrocatalyst is formed in situ with N doped carbon nanotubes grown on metal encapsulated hollow-mesoporous carbon sphere (Me@N-CNT/HMCS). The Me@N-CNT/HMCS oxygen electrocatalysts show high catalytic activities towards ORR, comparable to commercial Pt/C catalyst. The optimized performance of Fe@N-CNT/HMCS was achieved with a positive onset potential of 1.012 V and half-wave potential of 0.833 V. It is emphasized that Me@N-CNT/HMCS shows high stability and enhanced tolerance against methanol in alkaline medium. The Fe@N-CNT/HMCS electrocatalyst possessed a high OER activity with a low overpotential of 0.35 V at 10 mA cm(-2) current density. The excellent performance could be attributed to the synergistic effect involving chemical composition, high conductivity, good porosity and unique rambutan-like structure. In addition, the theoretical calculation study suggests that metallic Fe cluster can promote the O-2 adsorption strength in such chemical environment.									58	5	0	0	0	0	58			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000453616800016

However, the high energy barriers for the water dissociation step for breaking the strong H-O-H covalent bond results in sluggish hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics at the cathode. Herein, we present a strategy to optimize the morphology and surface properties of WO2.7 by introducing oxygen vacancies and doping with various transition metals. The experimental analysis demonstrates that the developed Co-WO2.7-x and Ni-WO2.7-x with ultrafine nanorods structure provide a larger electrochemical surface area than the other synthesized catalysts. Furthermore, theoretical analysis reveals that Co-WO2.7-x has the lowest energy barrier (0.65 eV) for the water dissociation step, which is much lower than that of WO2.7 (2.61 eV). Consequently, the Co-WO2.7-x delivers a current of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small overpotential of 59 mV for alkaline HER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000862926900002

In this study, we constructed experimental equipment and an electrochemical flow cell, which simulated a linear-type seawater MHD power generator, and investigated the effect of magnetic field on seawater electrolysis. Under magnetic field under solution flow conditions, we clarified that the strength of the magnetic field affected the current value of seawater electrolysis, which indicates that the MHD power generation was successfully simulated by the developed experimental equipment and electrochemical flow cell. Our electrochemical measurement results suggested that magnetic field was correctly applied to the cell and that the Lorentz force acted on the ions in the electrolyte solution, showing improvement in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) efficiency under the MHD power generation conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0366-7022	1348-0715		WOS:000813951000008

TiO2-RuO2 anodes can be promoted by Mn, resulting in increased activity and stability. The most active composition displayed an overpotential of 386 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and a Tafel slope of 50 mV dec(-1). This anode only included 17 at% Ru out of the total amount of metals included in the film. We investigated the influence of Mn addition to TiO2-RuO2 on the structure, morphology, and surface area, and related differences to catalytic activity and stability. We found that increased porosity of the anode film by Mn addition and Mn inclusion in the TiO2-RuO2 lattice can explain the enhanced catalytic activity. A detailed characterization of fresh and used anodes provided insight into structural modifications induced by electrochemical treatment.									38	0	0	0	3	0	38			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000496897000014

In this article a Mn-based bifunctional electrocatalyst, MnSe, has been identified which shows efficient OER and ORR activity in alkaline medium. The catalytic activity could be further enhanced by using multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) which increases the charge transfer and electronic conductivity of the catalyst composite. This MnSe@MWCNT catalyst composite exhibits a very low overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which outperforms state-of-the-art RuO2 as well as other oxide based electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the composite's facile OER kinetics was evidenced by its small Tafel slope of 54.76 mV dec(-1) and low charge transfer resistance, indicating quick transport of the reactant species at the electrode interface. The MnSe@MWCNT also exhibited efficient electrocatalytic activity for ORR with an E-onset of 0.94 V, which is among the best reported to date for chalcogenide based ORR electrocatalysts. More importantly, this MnSe-based ORR electrocatalyst exhibits high degree of methanol tolerance, showing no degradation of catalyst performance in the presence of copious quantities of methanol, thereby out-performing the state-of-the-art Pt electrocatalyst. The catalyst composite also exhibited exceptional functional and compositional stability for OER and ORR after a prolonged period of continuous operation in alkaline medium. The surface Raman analysis after OER revealed the retention of manganese selenide surface with evidence of oxo coordination, confirming the formation of an (oxy)selenide as the active surface for OER. Such efficient bifunctional OER and ORR activity makes this MnSe based catalyst attractive for overall electrolysis in regenerative as well as direct methanol fuel cells.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000760402100001

Herein, we describe 8 task-specific reactive DESs (RDESs) composed of amino acids and nickel chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2 center dot 6H(2)O) that support the desired reactive function for fabricating Ni-based materials, preserving the cost-effectiveness and energy-efficiency properties of the one-step annealing process. The structure of amino acids in the hydrogen bonded network was studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Then, the effects of chain length, functional group substitution and molar ratios on the thermodynamic stability of DESs were also explored. Finally, taking serine-NiCl2 center dot 6H(2)O and threonine-NiCl2 center dot 6H(2)O systems as examples, which were equipped with or without a methyl group, Ni and Ni@Ni(OH)(2) samples were prepared by a one-step annealing process, respectively. Notably, the obtained Ni@Ni(OH)(2) materials exhibited considerable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in an alkaline environment. Therefore, our proposed RDESs with versatile types and functionalities will open new avenues for potential development in energy and environmental applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000856040900001

Herein, the Ni0.85Se/Ni3S2 heterostructure grown on nickel foam (NF) is synthesized via successive wet-chemical processes. The obtained Ni0.85Se/Ni3S2 heterostructure is firstly investigated as an HER electrocatalyst in alkaline media and exhibits more excellent electrochemical properties over Ni3S2. And it delivers a low overpotential of 145 mV at a current density of -10 mA cm(-2), and superior stability. Based on the analysis of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), the enhanced HER activity is due to the modulation of surface electronic structure, ascribing from the construction of heterointerface between Ni0.85Se and Ni3S2. Meanwhile, the Ni0.85Se/Ni3S2 heterostructure prepared in this work is also verified to be employed as a promising alternative to noble metal catalysts in HER.

Their thermal catalytic performances were evaluated by toluene degradation. The physicochemical properties of the samples were characterized using a series of characterization methods. The catalytic activity of catalysts remained essentially unchanged in the high weight hourly space velocity, stability and water resistance test, which also indicated good catalytic performance. In the reusability test, the catalytic performance was found to be enhanced after the reaction, because of the catalyst might follow a Pt-0-PtO synergistic catalytic mechanism (similar to Mars-van Krevelen mechanism) and there was a phase transition between Pt-0 and PtO during the reaction. Firstly, the toluene adsorbed on the catalyst surface was oxidized by the activated lattice oxygen of the PtO. Then, consumption of oxygen atoms led to formation of oxygen vacancies, and finally the molecular oxygen adsorbed by Pt-0 was activated and passed to the PtO to supplement the oxygen vacancies, forming a redox cycle. In addition, the possible catalytic oxidation mechanism of toluene was also revealed. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Several efforts are reported on the designing and developing stand-alone PEC cells that efficiently produce H-2 and O-2 from water and minimize atmospheric CO2 via conversion to fuels under only sunlight. However, in reality, high overpotential, poor product-selectivity, competitive side-reactions, and self-reduction of a catalyst limit the performance of the PEC cells, thereby requiring high power inputs. The choice of electrode materials and architectures of PEC cells are very important for designing stand-alone and durable PEC cells with high solar-to-fuels conversion efficiency (Eff(STF)) and high selectivity. The present review provides a complete account of recent published works on stand-alone PEC systems with different architectures; development of electrode materials for high Eff(STF), selectivity, and stability; and the current challenges. Furthermore, this review describes the future outlook on stand-alone PEC systems for future production of clean solar fuels and mitigation of atmospheric CO2 levels by utilizing only solar energy.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2367-198X			WOS:000609203400001

Herein, we report a structural engineering strategy of Fe-doped Ni2P nanosheets arrays supported on Ni foam for enhancing electrocatalytic performance of both oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution (HER) reactions. Benefitting from the increased electrochemical active sites caused by structural engineering and the strong electronic effect derived from Fe-doping, the Fe-doped Ni2P nanosheets arrays with slightly rough surface can achieve the highest OER activity with a low overpotential of 213 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 50.7 mV dec(-1), better than the other catalysts with different surface structures. Moreover, the enhanced HER performance can also be obtained based on this distinct structure. Finally, a two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer, applying this optimized bifunctional catalyst as both the cathode and anode, can be driven with a low cell voltage of 1.54 V to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), as well as excellent stability. The present study bridges the gap between structural engineering and bifunctional electrocatalytic activity towards overall water splitting, and opens up a new avenue for the material designs of high-performance nanoarrays electrocatalysts.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000580627000092

Herein, we report the synthesis of ultrafine IrRu alloy nanoparticles (1.6 ± 0.3 nm) by coprecipitation of IrCl3, RuCl3, and HCOONa in water to allow Ir3+ and Ru3+ to be well dispersed and enclosed in the matrix of crystalline HCOONa, followed by heat treatment of HCOONa to reduce Ir3+ and Ru3+. Remarkably, the overpotential of IrRu toward acidic OER at 10 mA cm-2 is merely 230 and 194 mV at 51 and 204 mugIrRu cm-2, respectively. The high electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of 577.1 m2 g-1 and high specific activity (SA) of 22.7 muA cm-2 at 1.45 V vs RHE would contribute to the exceptional OER activity. In addition, the electron transfer from Ir to Ru in IrRu should significantly boost the OER activity according to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). IrRu also shows an excellent stability during 10 h of a chronopotentiometry (CP) test at 10 mA cm-2. Eventually, the high OER activity of IrRu was verified in a PEMWE.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1520-510X		MEDLINE:36264684	36264684

This, however, is not possible without the understanding of structure-stability interrelations and underlying mechanisms. When pursuing the reduction of Ir amount by its dispersion on ceramic materials, the interactions between the catalytically active sites and their support further complicate the already understood processes. In the present study, we use our unique approach, where we employ an Ir/TiON-based TEM grid and use it as a support system for the investi-gation of structural transformations of Ir nanoparticles. This was achieved by utilizing both the modified floating electrode (MFE) apparatus, which enables efficient bubble management during electrochemical experiments and identical-location scanning transmission electron microscopy (IL-STEM) approach. The analysis of obtained high -resolution images with in-house developed computer algorithms for image analysis reveals several processes with surface roughening being the predominant degradation mechanism.

Both reduction (mainly carbon monoxide and hydrogen) and oxidation products (oxygen) were simultaneously detected in the absence of cocatalysts, sacrificial reagents and electrical bias. KTaO3 (KTO) samples were synthesized by solid-state reaction (SSR-KTO) and solvothermal methods in a hexane-water mixture (Hex-KTO) and pure ethanol (Eth-KTO). The different synthesis methods were used to control particle sizes and morphologies of KTaO3 and their correlation towards photocatalytic activity has been further investigated. Strikingly, KTO prepared in a hexane-water mixture solvent represents a nanoflake-like structure, resulting in a seven fold increase in CO2 reduction and hydrogen evolution activities in comparison to conventional cubic structure KTO under UV light irradiation. CO with trace amounts of CH4 is produced from CO2 photoreduction. Upon addition of a silver cocatatyst on KTO, the reduction selectivity has been controlled to favour CO2 photoreduction, and the CO2 to CO yield has been doubled compared to bare KTaO3.									66	2	0	0	4	0	66			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000340217900053	25007379

In this work, we present the rational design and controllable synthesis of nanosized spinel manganese-cobalt oxide strongly coupled with ultrathin Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets (MnCo2O4/Ti3C2Tx) through a facile and cost-effective strategy. The effective combination of spinel MnCo2O4 with Ti3C2Tx nanosheets generates a number of attractive structural features with strong synergistic effects, such as highly accessible surface areas, intimate 0D/2D interfacial connection, full exposure of abundant active sites, optimized electronic structure, and excellent electron conductivity, all of which are very desirable for the HER process. Consequently, the resulting MnCo2O4/Ti3C2Tx electrocatalyst possesses an unusual HER ability with a low onset potential of only 51 mV, a small Tafel slope of 79 mV dec- 1 and exceptional long-term stability, markedly outperforming the bare MnCo2O4 and Ti3C2Tx electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000860666500005

Here, we demonstrate a modular design strategy to engineer an efficient heterostructured electrocatalyst FeS2/TiO2 (S-FTO) via a sulfidation process on natural ilmenites (FTO), which integrates high OER activity, good conductivity, and high stability. The modular catalyst, S-FTO catalyst, shows a low overpotential of 230 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2), as well as excellent stability in alkaline solution. Typically, S-FTO exhibits OER activity 19 times higher than FTO at an overpotential of 300 mV. In-depth investigations indicate that the high OER activity of S-FTO mainly originates from accelerated surface self-reconstruction induced by lattice S etching within the OER potential region, and the newly formed FeOOH on the outer layer acts as the active species for the OER. The remaining FeS2 regulates the surface electronic properties and enhances the conductivity, while TiO2 improves the stability. The modular design strategy demonstrated here will enable the design of low-cost heterostructures as high-efficiency catalysts for challenging energy storage/conversion reactions in an eco-friendly and sustainable manner.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000714138400001

The surface morphology was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis. The electrochemical behavior was investigated using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and accelerated life test (ALT). The results showed that the compositions of the coatings are rutile IrO2 and RuO2. ZrO2 is present as an amorphous phase in the coatings. The coating with Ru content of 21 mol% shows a compact structure with needle-like crystals dispersed. With the increase in Ru content, the porous and cracked structure of the ternary oxide coating of increased active surface area is obtained. Increasing Ru content improves the electrocatalytic activity, but worsens the stability of the coating in OER. The coating with Ru content of 21 mol% shows good electrocatalytic activity and the longest service lifetime in OER. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The conditions of synthesis of highly branched polymers with a high yield-the ratio between monovinyl and divinyl comonomers and the rate of oxygen bubbling-are determined. The kinetics of formation of branched polystyrenes and the features of their molecular-mass distribution are studied. Elemental-analysis data show that the polymeric product contains 22-24 wt % oxygen, which, according to the IR data, enters into the composition of carbonyl, hydroxyl, and peroxide groups. The thermal decomposition of polymeric products is investigated via the TGA-DSC method. The main exothermal peak at similar to 145A degrees C is associated with the decomposition of peroxide groups, which is accompanied by the evolution of formaldehyde.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			1560-0904			WOS:000303357200013

Once in the diffuse gas, this material is mixed with the existing gases and then incorporated into young stars and planetary systems during star formation. Infrared observations have confirmed the presence of carbon, SiC, hydrocarbons, and oxygen-rich silicate grains in nova ejecta, suggesting that some fraction of the pre-solar grains identified in meteoritic material come from novae. The mean mass returned by a nova outburst to the ISM probably exceeds similar to 2 x 10(-4) M-circle dot. Using the observed nova rate of 35 +/- 11 per year in our Galaxy, it follows that novae introduce more than similar to 7 x 10(-3) M-circle dot yr(-1) of processed matter into the ISM. Novae are expected to be the major source of N-15 and O-17 in the Galaxy and to contribute to the abundances of other isotopes in this atomic mass range. Here, we report on how changes in the nuclear reaction rates affect the properties of the outburst and alter the predictions of the contributions of novae to Galactic chemical evolution.

Moreover, both the proton reduction and oxygen reduction reactions strongly depend on the electrode potential, which should be carefully considered and distinguished for polarization curve analysis of Cu in an acidic solution.

Improving the bifunctional catalytic ability of NiFe-TMO is essential for the further performance improvement of Li-O-2 batteries. Herein, we regulated the electronic structure of free-standing NiFe LDO nanosheets array via introducing foreign Co ion to improve its bifunctional catalytic activity in Li-O-2 batteries. Combined with well-designed electrode architecture and the deliberately modified surface electronic structure, this strategy markedly alleviates polarization problem in terms of low overpotential (0.98 V), and the discharge voltage within 110 cycles remains stable at 2.89 V without significant attenuation. This study illustrates an intimate connection between electronic structure engineering and catalytic activity optimization that is critical for the rational design of Li-O-2 batteries.									26	3	0	0	2	0	26			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000482546000039	31356043

This study develops a high-performance, durable non-precious metal electrocatalyst for AEMWE, which show improved activity and durability. First, Ni/C was alloyed with Co and supported on carbon cloth coated with microporous carbon layer to improve the electrocatalytic activity of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst; then, oxide (Ni/Co-O) was locally formed on the synthesized NiCo/C to increase its activity and durability. Specifically, this oxide increased the coverage of OH- ions, formed hydrogen spillover channels, and promoted the HER. Further, its improved electrochemical durability was attributed to the high bond dissociation energy of the metal oxide. The electrocatalyst was also evaluated as the cathode in single-cell (1-cell) and stack cell (5-cell) AEMWE systems to demonstrate that this superior performance would translate to the commercial scale.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000663214700003

The introduction of GO is found not only to control the aggregation and the growth of Ni3S2 nanosheets, but also to increase the number of active sites and improve conductivity of composite. The heterogeneous Ni3S2-rGO@NF electrode as electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) exhibits significantly enhanced catalytic activity in alkaline media. The onset potential of Ni3S2-rGO@NF can be as low as approximate to 0 mV, which is comparable to platinum, and only a small overpotential of approximate to 44 mV is needed to reach a benchmark current density of 10 mA/cm(2). Moreover, it demonstrates a good stability. All evidences suggest that the in situ surfurization can be considered as an effective way to prepare metal sulfides as electrocatalysts for hydrogen generation.									18	1	0	0	1	0	18			0884-2914	2044-5326		WOS:000427606100002

Low-temperature synthesis and electrocatalytic application of large-area PtTe2 thin films [arXiv]								arXiv								37 pp.	37 pp.						7 April 2020	2020	The synthesis of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has been a primary focus for 2D nanomaterial research over the last 10 years, however, only a small fraction of this research has been concentrated on transition metal ditellurides. In particular, nanoscale platinum ditelluride (PtTe2) has rarely been investigated, despite its potential applications in catalysis, photonics and spintronics. Of the reports published, the majority examine mechanically-exfoliated flakes from chemical vapor transport (CVT) grown crystals. While this production method is ideal for fundamental studies, it is very resource intensive therefore rendering this process unsuitable for large scale applications. In this report, the synthesis of thin films of PtTe2 through the reaction of solid-phase precursor films is described. This offers a production method for large-area, thickness-controlled PtTe2, suitable for a range of applications. These polycrystalline PtTe2 films were grown at temperatures as low as 450 degC, significantly below the typical temperatures used in the CVT synthesis methods. To investigate their potential applicability, these films were examined as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The films showed promising catalytic behavior, however, the PtTe2 was found to undergo chemical transformation to a substoichiometric chalcogenide compound under ORR conditions. This study shows while PtTe2 is stable and highly useful for HER, this property does not apply to ORR, which undergoes a fundamentally different mechanism. This study broadens our knowledge of the electrocatalysis of TMDs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0						INSPEC:19824215

In this work, porous nickel-cobalt nitride-oxide (NiCo-N-O) nanosheet hybrids in a networked configuration are synthesized on carbon cloth through in situ plasma treatment of nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors. The self-supported NiCo-N-O electrodes exhibit the outstanding catalytic activity of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a low overpotential of 50 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline conditions. The synergistic effects of the morphology, microstructure, and electron transfer between nickel-cobalt nitride and oxide and the favorable role of introducing bimetallic Ni and Co sites on the enhanced electrocatalytic activities are discussed.

However, current strategies are usually restricted to monofunctional electrocatalysts owing to the opposite redox process at cathode and anode. Herein, we present a photo generated-carrier-driven strategy to enhance the electrocatalytic HER and OER activities of transition-metal/semiconductor bifunctional electrocatalysts. The Ni/NiO heterostructured ultrathin nanosheet array supported on Ni foam (denoted as Ni/NiO-NF) is chosen as the model metal/semiconductor bifunctional electrocatalyst and exhibits 10- and 2.6-fold enhancement of mass activity for HER and OER, respectively, after exposure to light irradiation. The increase in water-splitting activities can be attributed to the transfer of photogenerated electrons from excited NiO to HER-active Ni and the accelerating formation of OER-active Ni-III/IV, respectively.									45	2	0	0	2	0	45			2155-5435			WOS:000412795700010

In situ monitoring of atomic dissolution and physicochemical analysis in conjunction with theoretical calculations reveal that the atomic-level stability of Au@Pt nanoparticle is attributed to the low surface coverage of OH and oxide on Pt, balancing between strain and ligand effect of Au at the interface. Considering the relationships in activity-stability-oxophilicity, the functional links between activity and stability in the ORR are discussed, and the regulation of oxophilicity is suggested as a guideline for designing highly active and durable electrocatalysts for fuel cell applications.									24	1	0	0	3	0	24			2380-8195			WOS:000571642600006

However, the efficient nitrogen doping is still restricted by their low content and poor conversion efficiency. In this study, self-nitrogen-doped biomass-based carbon materials with high content of nitrogen (27.8% pyridinic-N and 40.3% graphitic-N) and hierarchical pore structure were prepared via lipid extraction pretreatment. The obtained microalgae residue carbon (MRC) catalyst exhibits superior oxygen reduction reaction performance, in terms of more preferable electrode performance and better stability, higher power density in the microbial fuel cells system compared to that of microalgae carbon (MAC). The onset potential of the MRC is 60 mV higher than that of MAC, and the maximum power density of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) with MRC as cathode catalyst reache 412.85 mW m(-2). This can be attributed to the fact of that the lipid extraction was not only beneficial to the nitrogen enhancement and oriented conversion but also be conductive to the structure construction. The synergistic effect between active sites and hierarchical structure endows the catalyst excellent ORR performance and good stability in the MFCs system.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0048-9697	1879-1026		WOS:000764884100007	35077784

The development of highly efficient, active electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction is important for clean-energy devices, including fuel cells and energy storage applications. In this study, Ag deposited on the surface of two-dimensional molybdenum disulfide by a simple microwave method is used as an electrocatalyst. Because of its heterostructure and the increased specific surface area of the Ag/MoS2 nanohybrid, the Ag/MoS2 nanohybrid exhibits improved oxygen reduction reaction activity and similar stability with respect to pure MoS2 and commercial Pt/C in an alkaline solution. Because of the robust heterojunction between Ag and MoS2, the Ag/MoS2 nanohybrid exhibits excellent stability even after 2000 cycles. A four-electron transfer is observed for the synthesized Ag/MoS2 nanohybrid, which has potential applications in clean-energy devices.									24	1	0	0	2	0	24			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000566975200007

Role of dissolved oxygen reduction in improvement inhibition performance of ascorbic acid during copper corrosion in 0.50 mol/L sulphuric acid								CHINESE CHEMICAL LETTERS				21	3			341	345		10.1016/j.cclet.2009.10.026				MAR 2010	2010	The kinetics of dissolved O(2) reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions on copper surface was studied in naturally aerated and air and O(2)-saturated 0.50 mol/L H(2)SO(4) solutions using polarization measurements combined with the rotating disc electrode (RDE). The Koutecky Levich plot indicated that the dissolved O(2) reduction at the copper electrode was an apparent four-electron process. A correlation between the presence of dissolved O(2) and the formation of Cu(2)O, confirmed from XRD, was discussed. Ascorbic acid (AA) was tested as a safe inhibitor for copper corrosion in H(2)SO(4) solutions at 25 degrees C. Measurements were carried out as a function of dissolved oxygen concentration using Tafel polarization measurements. The addition of AA slowed down the reduction reaction of dissolved O(2) more effectively than the anodic reaction. Dissolved O(2) was found to enhance the inhibition performance of AA. Adsorption via hydrogen bonding was considered. (C) 2009 Mohammed A. Amin Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Chinese Chemical Society.

The intramolecular proton transfer occurs in a five-member atom arrangement, between two oxygen atoms separated by a carbon-carbon bond. The chosen systems serve as models for alpha-hydroxyalkoxide molecules where the carbon-carbon bond varies from a single bond (the glycolate anion or alpha-hydroxyethanoxide anion) to a part of an aromatic ring (the alpha-hydroxyphenoxide anion), and finally to a double bond (the alpha-hydroxyethenoxide anion). Particular attention was given to the evolution along the intrinsic reaction coordinate of such properties as energies, relevant structural parameters, Mulliken charges, dipole moments, and H-1-NMR chemical shifts to reveal the similarities and differences for the proton transfer in the model systems.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0021-9606	1089-7690		WOS:000228287900025	15836387

Herein, a novel (110) high-index faceted binary-metal selenide (FeNiSe) nanosheet array grown on electrochemically exfoliated graphene foil (FeNiSe-NS/EG) is developed from its vertically-oriented NiFe-LDH nanosheet/EG precursor through a low-temperature selenization reaction. Benefiting from its unique 3D configuration and enhanced electrical conductivity, the obtained FeNiSe-NS/EG electrode exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity toward the HER with small overpotentials of -187 and -222 mV at current densities of 10 and 20 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 65 mV dec(-1), and remarkable long term stability in alkaline media, outperforming the recently reported NiFe-based non-precious metal HER catalysts. Theoretical calculations and experimental results reveal that the synergistic effects of the exposed (110) high-index facets and Fe dopants give rise to a greatly enhanced HER performance.									23	1	0	0	1	0	23			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000489646900004	31553015

The success of Li-O-2 batteries could efficiently reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the consumption of non-renewable fossil fuels. How to achieve high round-trip efficiency, high capacity, and satisfactory cycling performance, however, is still a great challenge for the lithium oxygen battery. Thus, this report will point out what factors will affect the electrochemical performance and will aim to describe how to increase the electrochemical performance by air electrode optimization. Based on recent achievements, several approaches to solving this problem, such as synthesizing electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity and designing appropriate air electrode structures, are described in details.

Here, to improve the performance of catalyst layer for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an acidic medium, vertical aligned IrOx nanoarrays (IrOx NAs) were synthesized by electrodeposition with TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTA) as template. By tuning the scan rate in the electrodeposition process, IrOx open-end nanotube arrays with tunable length ranged from 500 nm to 1400 nm and hollow nanorod arrays were obtained due to a diffusion-controlled deposition process. By constructing 3-D electrode of 1-D catalyst with enhanced ion transfer, IrOx NAs performed almost the same current density of OER with 1/20 Ir loading amount compared with commercial IrO2 nanoparticles, which could significantly reduce the cost of catalyst in PEM water electrolyser. Moreover, no apparent current decrease was observed even after 10 h' anodic polarization under 1.55 V, which exhibit excellent OER durability.

Herein, a Ni-based metal organic frameworks (MOFs) (marked as Ni-BDC, BDC stands for 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid) nanosheet is successfully fabricated on hydroxyl iron oxide (FeOOH) array with carbon fiber cloth (CFC) as substrate. Benefit from the coordination tuning synergistic effect of the distinct chemical composition and the hierarchical structure for fast mass transportation, the as-obtained FeOOH@Ni-BDC illustrates excellent catalytic ability for electrochemical water oxidation with low over-potential of 270 mV to reach 10 mA/cm(2) current and good durability in alkaline electrolyte. The novelty of this work lies in the modulation of electronic structure of THE FeOOH with Ni-BDC through coordination effect to enhance the activity of the hierarchical composite electrocatalyst.

Herein, a hybrid of three-dimensional (3D) porous reduced graphene oxide supported CoP-RuP2 heterostructures (CoP-RuP2/rGO) is first reported by a facile sol-gel-assisted approach. The elaborate design can provide a 3D porous carbon matrix with a large surface area, enabling CoP-RuP2 nanoparticles to disperse uniformly on graphene and constructing an interface-rich CoP/RuP2 heterojunction. Benefiting from the synergistic contribution of its merits, the designed CoP-RuP2/rGO shows significantly enhanced catalytic HER performance as well as long-term stability over all pH ranges. Furthermore, the as-fabricated full water-splitting cell employing CoP-RuP2/rGO as the cathode needs a low voltage of only 1.62 V at 10 mA cm(-2) with remarkable durability in 1.0 M KOH solution, which outperforms a precious metal-based Pt/C||IrO2 driven water electrolyzer, endowing it with potential applications in energy-relevant electrocatalysis fields.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1528-7483	1528-7505		WOS:000841103400001

However, the surface reconstruction has seldom been observed from hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts. Here, we report the surface reconstruction with enhancement of catalysis activity in the HER catalyst of NiMoO4-CoO nanosheets on carbon cloth. Mo species dissolve from NiMoO4-CoO by activating the pristine catalyst at certain potential, which enables the formation of K2Mo3O10 on the catalyst surface. The surface reconstruction not only brings large numbers of active sites and enhanced charge transfer, but also boosts the intrinsic activity per catalysis site. Together with the above advantages and the benefits of nanosheet structure, the activated catalyst exhibits high HER activity with the ultralow overpotentials of 130 and 192 mV at high current densities of 100 and 400 mA cm(-2). This finding provides new insight for the exploration on surface reconstruction of transition metal-based HER catalysts and may enable further understanding on the origin of catalysis activity improvement.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2052-1553			WOS:000792413500001

To achieve this goal, it is highly desirable to employ photosensitizers and catalysts that are both derived from earth-abundant materials. Herein, we report an efficient noble-metal-free system by integrating the above two components. We found that functional MoSx nanoparticles can be obtained with an in situ photoreduction manner during photocatalytic reactions in the presence of inexpensive organic sensitizers. The thus-obtained MoSx catalysts demonstrated quite high efficiency for catalyzing H-2 evolution under visible light. The factors influencing the performance of the photocatalytic system was investigated and a two-step reaction mechanism was proposed. The concept of in situ formation of hydrogen evolution catalyst paves the way for investigating biomimetic molybdenum sulfide catalysts for photocatalytic H-2 production in systems without the presence of noble metals.

Therefore, exploring a bifunctional catalyst with excellent electrochemical performance, high durability, and low cost is essential for rechargeable ZAB. In this work, amino functionalized carbon nanotubes supported core/shell nanoparticles composed of CoNi alloy core and CoO-NiO shell (CoNi@CoOeNiO/NH2-CNTs-1) is synthesized through a simple and efficient hydrothermal reaction and calcination method, which shows higher ORR/ OER bifunctional catalytic performance than the single metal-based catalyst, such as Ni@NiO/NH2-CNTs and Co@CoO/NH2-CNTs. The fabricated bimetallic alloy based catalyst CoNi@CoO-NiO/NH2CNTs-3 with the optimized loading content of CoNi@CoO-NiO core/shell nanoparticles, presents the best bifunctional catalytic performance for ORR/OER. Experimental studies reveal that CoNi@CoOeNiO/NH2-CNTs-3 exhibits the onset potential of 0.956 V and 1.423 V vs. RHE for ORR and OER, respectively. It also exhibits a low overpotential of 377 mV to achieve a 10 mA cm(-2) current density for OER, and positive half-wave potentials of 0.794 V for ORR. And the potential difference between half-wave potential of ORR (E1/2) and the potential at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER (Ej(10)) is 0.813 V. In addition, when CoNi@CoOeNiO/NH2CNTs-3 is used as an air electrode catalyst of rechargeable ZAB, its maximum power density and open circuit voltage (OCV) can reach 128.7 mW cm(-2) and 1.458 V (The commercially available catalyst of Pt/CeRuO2 is 88.1 mW cm(-)2), which strongly demonstrates that the fabricated catalyst CoNi@CoOeNiO/NH2-CNTs-3 can be used as a highly efficient bifunctional catalyst for ZABs, and is expected to replace those expensive precious metal electrocatalysts to meet the growing demand for new energy devices.

Herein, by means of computational screening based on the density functional theory (DFT), we studied a wide range of transition metal (TM) atoms embedded into the double carbon vacancy of C3N monolayers (V-CC), denoted as TM-V-CC (TM = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir and Pt), as efficient single-atom catalysts (SACs) for OER and ORR. The calculated results showed that all the considered TM-V-CC composites exhibited a metallic feature that ensured efficient charge transfer during reactions. The interaction strength between intermediates and TM-V-CC has direct correlation with the d-band center of TM, which can be tuned by changing the TM atoms with different numbers of d electrons. The best catalyst for OER was Rh-V-CC with an overpotential ((OER)) of 0.35 V, followed by Co-V-CC (0.43 V). For the ORR process, Rh-V-CC exhibited the lowest ORR overpotential ((ORR)) of 0.27 V, followed by Co-V-CC (0.42 V). The results suggested that the performances of the newly predicted Rh-V-CC and Co-V-CC SACs are comparable to those of the noble-metal benchmark catalysts for OER and ORR. Ab initio molecular dynamic simulations indicated that Rh-V-CC and Co-V-CC SACs could remain stable under 300 K and possessed high energy barriers to prevent the isolated Rh and Co atoms from clustering.

We compare electrochemistry of undoped, Fe and Al-doped alpha-Mn2O3 with bixbyite structure and braunite Mn7SiO12 having bixbyite-related crystal structure, using the rotating disk electrode (RDE), the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE), and cyclic voltammetry (CV) techniques. All manganese oxides under study are stable in the potential range between the ORR onset and ca. 0.7 V vs. Reversible Hydrogen Electrode (RHE). It is found that any changes introduced in the bixbyite structure and/or composition of alpha-Mn2O3 lead to an activity drop in both the oxygen reduction and hydrogen peroxide reactions in this potential interval. For the hydrogen peroxide reduction reaction these modifications also result in a change in the nature of the rate-determining step. The obtained results confirm that due to its unique crystalline structure undoped alpha-Mn2O3 is the most ORR active (among currently available) Mn oxide catalyst and favor the assumption of the key role of the (111) surface of alpha-Mn2O3 in the very high activity of this material towards the ORR.

J	Laughlin, LT; Bernat, BA; Armstrong, RN								Mechanistic imperative for the evolution of a metalloglutathione transferase of the vicinal oxygen chelate superfamily								CHEMICO-BIOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS				112				41	50		10.1016/S0009-2797(97)00150-6				APR 24 1998	1998	A number of glutathione (GSH) transferases are now known in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The enzymes appear to be primarily involved in the metabolism of foreign compounds. At least six distinct classes of soluble GSH transferases have been identified in eukaryotes and named alpha, mu, pi, sigma, theta and kappa. Sequences and the known three-dimensional structures of the soluble enzymes suggest that these proteins share a common ancestry, though the precise details of their evolution remain obscure. A second distinct family of GSH transferases are the microsomal or membrane-bound enzymes that include leukotriene C4 synthase. A third family is represented by a bacterial GSH transferase (FosA) responsible for conferring resistance to the antibiotic fosfomycin, reported some years ago by Suarez and co-workers (Arca et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 34 (1990) 1552-1556). The enzyme is quite specific for fosfomycin, which contains a very stable epoxide moiety. Evidence is presented that FosA is a metalloprotein related to iron- and manganese-dependent dioxygenases and to glyoxalase I. These enzymes are members of a previously unrecognized group of enzymes; the vicinal oxygen chelate superfamily. The mechanistic imperative driving the evolution of FosA and its relatives, which are enzymes catalyzing quite diverse chemical reactions, is proposed to be the electrophilic assistance provided by the metal through chelation of a substrate or intermediate.

Revista clinica espanola				191	3			137	40						1992-Jul	1992	We present our experience with oxygen-therapy with transtracheal catheter in the period between January 1990 and December 1991. This procedure was offered to 130 patients who met criteria of home oxygen-therapy being accepted only by twelve. Ten patients maintained oxygen-therapy with transtracheal catheter with excellent results and a notable improve in their quality of life. One patient died twenty-three days after beginning the procedure, due to evolution of main disease finding no role of the catheter in the disease. Another patient showed a vagal reaction after placement of the catheter, which forced to perform resuscitation with connection to mechanical ventilation taking the catheter off because familiar request. Patients who benefit this type of oxygen-therapy the trans-tracheal catheter has showed its usefulness. With few complications and showing no problems in its home handling. Oxygen savings with this technique have been of 55%. Trans-tracheal catheter was much more effective than face mask to correct desaturation after exercise (p less than 0.001).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0014-2565			MEDLINE:1502403	1502403

Herein, N, P co-doped hollow carbon spheres (N,P-HCS) are prepared through a simple pyrolysis method, using hollow carbon spheres (HCS), melamine, and phytic acid (PA) as the C, N, and P sources, respectively. Compared to the N-doped HCS (N-HCS) and P-doped HCS (P-HCS), the N, P co-doped sample exhibited much higher ORR catalytic activity. Moreover, in comparison with commercial Pt/C, the as-prepared N,P-HCS showed comparable ORR activity, but stronger endurance to methanol and higher durability in alkaline solution. The high performance of N,P-HCS can be primarily ascribed to the large surface area, high conductivity, porous carbon structure, and high content of heteroatoms (N and P). Considering the excellent catalytic activity and durability, after further structural optimization, N,P-HCS could be a promising metal-free catalyst candidate for the ORR in fuel cells.									32	2	0	0	4	0	33			2196-0216			WOS:000438339200019

Here, SiNWs served as the carrier with vast surface area. It is interesting to note that Pd-SiNW nanocomposites were more stable for hydrogen evolution reaction than the commercial Pt/C catalysts, which might be attributed to the three-dimensional crisscrossing structure of the composites and the strong interaction between Pd and Si. The strong interaction is due to the low lattice mismatch in the epitaxial growth of Pd particles on the surface of Si. Such special structure and interaction help to tightly hold Pd nanoparticles, which could avoid the loss of catalysts and keep the catalyst from being agglomerated and growing large.

However, single- component monatomic catalysts are rarely reported for the overall photocatalytic water splitting reaction (OWS). Herein, a two-component synergistic photocatalyst was designed that contained a dispersion of single-atom Co (Co-SAs) centers and PtCo alloy nanoparticles (Nps), which were supported over C3N4 nanosheets. Among these components, Co-SAs centers act as highly active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and PtCo alloys act as highly active sites for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A synergistic effect between them occurs when the two different reactive centers are combined, indicating that there may be a spillover phenomenon of protons or hydroxyl groups between the Co-SAs, centers and PtCo alloy NPs. The synergistic promotion of Co-SAs centers and PtCo alloys bridges the gap between achieving maximum atom utilization and optimal bifunctional activities for OWS reactions. This combination provides a promising model for the development of OWS by atomically dispersed catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000813897700001

The catalysts were prepared by a colloidal method in aqueous solution and a subsequent thermal treatment. An iridium hydroxide hydrate precursor was obtained at similar to 100 A degrees C, which was, successively, calcined at different temperatures from 200 to 500 A degrees C. The physico-chemical characterization was carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). IrO2 catalysts were sprayed onto a Nafion 115 membrane up to a loading of 3 mg cm(-2). A Pt catalyst was used at the cathode compartment with a loading of 0.6 mg cm(-2). The electrochemical activity for water electrolysis of the membrane-electrode assemblies (MEAs) was investigated in a single cell SPE electrolyzer by steady-state polarization curves, impedance spectroscopy and chrono-amperometric measurements. A maximum current density of 1.3 A cm(-2) was obtained at 1.8 V and 80 A degrees C for the IrO2 catalyst calcined at 400 A degrees C for 1 h. A stable performance was recorded in single cell for this anode catalyst at 80 A degrees C. The suitable catalytic activity and stability of the most performing catalyst were interpreted in terms of proper combination between nanostructure and suitable morphology.									86	9	0	0	4	0	94			1388-0764			WOS:000289735400027

The results of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) manifest that Mo element was triumphantly introduced into Ni3S2. The Mo-doped Ni3S2/Ni foam composite possesses three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical structure with column type characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The diameter of the column is similar to 300 nm. Each of these columns is made up of many nanopetals. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) test results exhibit that the products have outstanding HER performance. The Tafel slope of the optimal Mo-doped Ni3S2/Ni foam composite is 131.7 mV dec(-1). The overpotentials are 97.1 mV and 392.1 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Moreover, the products show good stability.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2365-6549			WOS:000498739900018

Due to the synergetic effects of Ni, NiO and graphene, Ni/NiO@C/GR-t-w all exhibited the electrocatalytic performance to HER in acidic medium. When the GO content was 8% and the carbonization temperature was 900 degrees C, the composites (Ni/NiO@C/GR-900-8) showed the best electrocatalytic properties with an lower over-potential of 108mV (vs. RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2), a smaller Tafel slope of 44 mV dec(-1) and a good stability in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The excellent electrocatalytic performance enabled Ni/NiO@C/GR composites to be a favorable HER catalyst to replace the expensive Pt-based materials in the applications of the hydrogen production.

It is found that Fe3O4 microbeads played a pivotal role in boosting photocatalytic activity and apparent quantum efficiency of C-60@Pt for visible-light-driven HER, as the weak local magnetic field it induced around C-60@Pt contributed to facilitating the separation of photo electrons from electron-donor in reaction system.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1566-7367	1873-3905		WOS:000862749900004

Herein, a piezoelectric catalytic H-2 evolution reaction (HER), using a sheet-like BiOCl as the catalyst, can convert mechanical energy into clean hydrogen energy. A high yield of HER (975.4 mu mol g(-1)h(- 1)) was reached by the ultrasound-based piezoelectric catalysis, exhibiting the excellent piezoelectric catalytic activity of as-synthesized BiOCl. Under mechanical vibration of ultrasound, sheet-like BiOCl would deform, inducing piezoelectric polarization and generation of abundant free polarized-electrons on the surface for redox reactions. BiOCl with continued ultrasonic vibration not only achieves durability HER, but also simultaneously utilizes electrons and holes to form reactive oxygen species (ROS) for a high-efficient degradation rate (98%) of organic antibiotic pollutants (sulfamethazine) removal in 120 min. This work provides a new idea for promoting environmental purification and developing clean hydrogen energy.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2468-0230			WOS:000807752900004

However, a question of the possible involvement of Fe3+ as a valence band hole acceptor has been raised. Herein, we demonstrate that the PEC water oxidation using oxide semiconductor (WO3, TiO2, and BiVO4; primarily WO3) films can proceed via the formation of high-valent iron species in the presence of aqueous Fe3+ ions at pH 1-3. The presence of Fe3+ (1-100 mM) enhances the photocurrent generation, O-2 evolution, and the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of similar to 90% with a biased WO3 electrode (1.23-1.88 V-RHE), whereas the formation of Fe2+ is significantly inhibited. An in situ transient absorption spectroscopic analysis reveals the formation of high-valent iron species. The selective oxidation of dimethyl sulfoxide to dimethyl sulfone using in situ high-valent iron species is achieved with an FE of similar to 98% in the PEC reaction with Fe3+. The proposed reaction mechanism should call for attention to the conventional role of Fe3+ in the PEC reaction.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2380-8195			WOS:000769973900009

Herein, we reported a P-doped Ni-Mo bimetal aerogel (Ni-Mo-P) through facile Ni-Mo aerogel gelation followed by in-situ P doping with NaH2PO4. The optimized Ni-Mo-P catalyst demonstrated impressively low overpotentials of 69 mV and 235 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at a current density of 10 mA cm-2. The excellent HER and OER performance was attributed to the electron redistribution triggered by Mo alloying and P doping as well as the optimal bond strength between H* and the active sites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that Ni-Mo-P exhibited a reduced energy barrier and much easier water dissociation originated from the electron redistribution by P doping. Benefiting from these advantages, Ni-Mo-P required a low cell voltage of 1.46 V to achieve an overall water splitting current density of 10 mA cm-2.									38	0	0	0	2	0	38			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000696929300007

In this work, we have successfully synthesized a versatile hybrid photocatalysts, i.e.; CdMoO4/g-C3N4 (CMO/CN) by a facile and simple one pot in-situ hydrothermal method. Here CdMoO4 (CMO) microspheres were deposited on the g-C3N4 (CN) sheets. Fabricated CN, CMO, and CMO/CN composite photocatalysts were analyzed with various characterization techniques like UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-Vis DRS), photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL), time-resolved fluorescence lifetime (TRFL), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDX), transmission electron microscope (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET). The results reveal that the formation of a strong heterojunction between two semiconductors leads to the formation of active photocatalyst. Furthermore, as-synthesized materials were tested for the photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) in acidic medium, and photocatalytic (PC) degradation of methylene blue (MB) under light irradiation. Among all tested samples, CMO/CN-10 has shown the highest current density 52.74 mA cm(-2) at 1.95 V with lowest over potential of 0.70 mV on glassy carbon electrode for OER in acidic medium under the light irradiation. The PC degradation rate constant of CMO/CN-10 composite in MB solution is k = 2.0 x 10(-2) min(-1), whereas for the pure CMO and CN degradation rate constant is k = 5.7 x 10(-3) min(-1) and k = 1.2 x 10(-2) min(-1), respectively. This enhancement in PEC and PC properties is due to the fast migration of photo-induced electrons in the case of CMO/CN-10 nanocomposite. Trapping experiment results reveal the major reactive species for PC degradation of MB is .OH (hydroxyl radicals) and h+ (holes), respectively, and suitable PC reaction mechanism also proposed for CMO/CN-10 composites. Based on the above remarkable results, it would be a potential nanocomposite for the PEC oxygen evolution and PC degradation of MB under light illumination. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The electrodes were synthesized from an electrolytic bath varying the temperature (25 to 70 degrees C) and rotating cathode (30 to 100 rpm) by the potentiostatic method. The results of capacities in the Li-O-2 cell and catalytic activity measurements showed that the Zn-Co alloy is a promising catalyst for the O-2 evolution reaction (OER). Sharp surfaces composed for nanoflakes and heterogeneous surfaces with whitish agglomerates which may have increased the surface area for the housing of the discharge products was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). X-ray diffraction (XRD) evidenced Zn21Co5 composition and Raman spectra evidenced discharge product Li2O2.

In this study, a general chemical vapor deposition process and a gentle cation-exchange method were combined to assemble Z-scheme photocatalysts between CdS and MnS. As a result of the well-defined heterojunction interfaces and distinctive structural benefits, without cocatalysts, the 1 D CdS/MnS hybrid photocatalyst exhibited a significantly increased photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate of 1595 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) (apparent quantum efficiency of 22.6 % at lambda=420 nm), which is over 10.5 times higher than that of CdS. Moreover, a better photocatalytic stability is demonstrated over particulate (42 h cycling measurement) and photoelectrochemical (3000 min continuous measurement) systems. Overall, this work provides a unique experimental insight into high-quality heterojunction interface design and new Z-scheme photocatalyst synthesis.									50	2	0	0	2	0	50			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000527833300001	32189466

In this study, a facile pyrolyzation method is proposed for synthesizing the Ru nanoclusters (NCs) anchored on B/N-doped graphene (BNG) (denoted as Ru NCs/BNG). During the pyrolyzation, boron was doped into graphene and facilitated the formation of ultra small Ru NCs with a diameter of 0.5-1 nm. The electronic interaction between B and Ru NCs accelerated the cleavage of H-OH, altering the HER mechanism and lowering the activation energy of H-2 formation, endowing Ru NCs/BNG with excellent alkaline HER activity, even surpassing that of Pt/C. This study reveals the importance of water dissociation barriers for alkaline HER activity and provides a new strategy for improving the HER catalytic activity.									74	4	0	0	3	0	74			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000513811800015

Three different alloys (Ni-Co, Ni-Zn and Ni-W) at different composition were studied in order to determine the optimum condition. Nanostructured electrodes were obtained by template electrodeposition into a nanoporous membrane, starting from aqueous solution containing the two elements of the alloy at different concentrations. Composition of alloys can be tuned by electrolyte composition and also depends on the difference of the redox potential of elements and on the presence of complexing agents in deposition bath. Electrochemical and electrocatalytic tests, aimed at establishing the best alloy composition, were carried out for hydrogen evolution reaction. Then, test conducted at a constant current density in potassium hydroxide (30% w/w) aqueous solution were also performed. For all investigated alloys, very encouraging results were obtained and in particular Ni-Co alloys richer in Co showed the best performance.					15th International Symposium on HYdrogen POwer THeoretical and Engineering Solutions (HYPOTHESIS)15th International Symposium on HYdrogen POwer THeoretical and Engineering Solutions (HYPOTHESIS)	JUN 03-05, 2020JUN 03-05, 2020		ELECTR NETWORKELECTR NETWORK	5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0360-3199	1879-3487		WOS:000706475100006

Here we report the synthesis of rhodium phosphide electrocatalyst with low metal loading in the form of nanocubes (NCs) dispersed in high-surface-area carbon (Rh2P/C) by a facile solvo-thermal approach. The Rh2P/C NCs exhibit remarkable performance for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction compared to Rh/C and Pt/C catalysts. The atomic structure of the Rh2P NCs was directly observed by annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy, which revealed a phosphorus-rich outermost atomic layer. Combined experimental and computational studies suggest that surface phosphorus plays a crucial role in determining the robust catalyst properties.									271	11	0	0	10	0	273			0002-7863			WOS:000399966000032	28343390

The evolution of the Raman spectra of bulk and alumina supported palladium under NO reflects the ability of Pd to dissociate adsorbed NO molecules. The subsequent accumulation of oxygen atoms leads to the ultimate formation of subsurface oxygen species and/or PdO islands. Successive NO and CO adsorptions on 1 wt% Pd/Al2O3 lead to an oxidised or reduced palladium surface, respectively. On the other hand when CO and NO are simultaneously introduced, the competitive adsorptions between these two reactants, more in favour of NO, lead to an irreversible formation of PdO. These observations have been discussed in the light of mechanistic aspects obtained from previous kinetic investigations. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Herein, we report a series of carbon-based catalysts with varied structural features, specifically the graphitic degree of carbon, porosity, and the configuration of active sites, and their effects on bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic reactions. Through the synergistic tuning of these structural factors, the well-tailored Co-N-C catalyst exhibits a high bifunctional electrocatalytic activity, as revealed by a half-wave potential of 0.84 V for ORR and a low overpotential of 420 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) for OER. More impressively, the Zn-air battery using the optimum catalyst delivers excellent performance including a peak power density of 125.2 mW center dot cm(-2) and a specific capacity of 790.8 mAh.g(Zn)(-1), as well as stable cycling durability, outperforming the noble metals-based catalysts. The first-principles calculations reveal that the interlayer interaction between the pyridinic N-doped graphene and the confined Co nanoparticles increases the electronic states of the active C atoms near the Fermi level, thus enhancing the adsorption of the HOO* intermediate and generating superior catalytic activity for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis. By comprehensively studying the structural factors of catalysts, the bifunctional catalytic behaviors, the use in a practical Zn-air device, and theoretical simulations, this work may also give inspirations to the design, use, and understanding of other kinds of catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000803799000017

Li-O-2 batteries are one of the most promising devices because of their ultra-high energy density. To overcome their practical difficulties including low specific capacities, high overpotentials, limited rate capability and poor cycle stability, an intensive search for highly efficient electrocatalysts has been performed. Recently, it has been reported that heterostructured catalysts exhibit significantly enhanced activities toward the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, and their excellent performance is not only related to the catalyst materials themselves but also the special hetero-interfaces. Herein, an overview focused on the electrocatalytic functions of heterostructured catalysts for non-aqueous Li-O-2 batteries is presented by summarizing recent research progress. Reduction mechanisms of Li-O-2 batteries are first introduced, followed by a detailed discussion on the typical performance enhancement mechanisms of the heterostructured catalysts with different phases and heterointerfaces, and the various heterostructured catalysts applied in Li-O-2 batteries are also intensively discussed.

For Zn-air battery, the activity of air cathode plays an important role in its performance. Here, we report the fabrication of Co3O4 based bulky electrode with three-dimensional mesoporous carbon as matrix, which originates from cheap filter paper precursor. This electrode exhibits excellent activity and durability in oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process, which possesses small half-wave potential (ORR1/2 = 0.811 V) and low overpotential (OER10 = 1.518 V) for ORR and OER, respectively. With this electrode as air cathode directly, a rechargeable Zn-air battery is assembled successfully. During discharge process, the maximum power density of this Zn-air battery achieves 71 mW cm(-2). Furthermore, it also exhibits high specific capacity (828 mAh g(-1) at 20 mA cm(-2), 544 mAh g(-1) at 50 mA cm(-2)) and small voltage gap (0.91 V at 10 mA cm(-2)) in charge and discharge process. As a rechargeable battery, it also shows promising stability after long time charge-discharge experiments. Thus, we find out a simple and convenient method to fabricate cheap and effective bi-functional air cathode for rechargeable Zn-air battery.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000458344900070

However, the engineering and synthesis of Rh-based electrocatalysts to achieve Platinum-like HER performance under a comprehensive pH range still remains a challenge. In this work, we report an effective tactics to promote the HER performance of Rh mesoporous nanoparticles (Rh MNs) by co-doping of transition metal (e.g., Ni, Co, Fe) and phosphorus (P) elements. Such a metal-nonmetal co-doping could effectively regulate the electronic structure, increase the active sites, and induce lattice strain, which jointly contributes to a superior HER performance. With these merits, the optimized RhNiP mesoporous nanoparticles (RhNiP MNs) exhibited superior HER activity in a comprehensive pH scope, requiring overpotentials of only 15 mV, 36 mV and 44 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1 M KOH and 1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS), respectively, at the cathodic current density for 10 mA cm-2.									10	1	0	0	1	0	10			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000724300000004

The unique hollow core-shell structure formed a homogeneous surface heterojunction, which caused the composite photocatalytic material to exhibit better photocatalytic HER activity and stability than the initial NiCo2S4 in the dye-sensitized system. The photocatalytic HER rate of the optimal photocatalytic material, NiCo2S4@Ni2P 10%, reached 77.97 mu mol h(-1)via the optimization of the photocatalytic H-2 evolution performance.

However, the contribution of atomic clusters, which exist in SACs as well, to the overall catalytic performance is always overlooked, thus limiting further enhancement of the performance of Pt-catalyzed HER. Herein, we report anchoring Pt atomic clusters on N-doped graphene for ultrahigh performance of the HER Benefiting from optimized electron transfer and larger binding energy between active centers and the substrate, Pt atomic cluster catalysts (ACCs) exhibit higher catalytic activity than their single atomic counterparts after 4000 cycles and more than 16 h for HER in an acid solution. These findings reveal a vast opportunity to enhance the catalytic performance of chemical reactions with noble-metal-based ACCs in the near future.									41	4	0	0	0	0	42			2155-5435			WOS:000485090400057

An excellent electrocatalytic efficiency of hydrogen evolution reaction with a remarkably small overpotential of 195 mV and a Tafel slope of 47 mV/decade is easily accessible for our hybridized catalyst in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution, much superior to that of pure 2H MoS2 and threonic acid intercalating MoS2 nanomaterials. Moreover, the detailed electrochemical activity surface area and electrochemical impedance suggest that the face-to-face stacking of unilaminar 2H MoS2 and graphitic nanocarbon at an alternating sequence accelerates the mass transport and electron transfer and, thus, enhances the efficiency for electrocatalytic water splitting. This work paves a neoteric and straightforward pathway for the fabrication of superlattice MoS2 and unilaminar graphitic nanocarbon hybrid, further improving the electrocatalytic efficiency of 2H MoS2 nanosheets via a synergistic modulation strategy.									30	2	0	0	1	0	30			2168-0485			WOS:000449577200092

Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) were used to characterize the composition and main functional groups of the heavy oil. Strong interaction among cellulose and lignin was revealed, which promoted the generation of lipids and unsaturated hydrocarbons while inhibiting the generation of the condensed aromatic hydrocarbons, phenolic species and sugars in the heavy components.

Herein, using a metal-organic framework (MOF) as a precursor, a NiSe2/NiS2@NC electrocatalyst with abundant heterogeneous interfaces was designed and synthesized through a simultaneous selenization/sulfurization process. The heterojunction could provide more catalytic sites, accelerate the transfer of ions/gas, and optimize the electronic structure of the interface, and then exhibit overpotentials of 188 mV and 211 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic and alkaline media. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation results showed that the heterogeneous interface can optimize the electronic structure. Meanwhile, the Gibbs free-energy for H* adsorption was reduced to -0.35 eV, which means that the interface can effectively accelerate the HER kinetics.

The new photocatalysts, Bi2MNbO7 (M = Fe3+,In3+), were synthesized by the solid-state reaction and characterized by powder X-ray diffraction and Rietveld structure refinement. Bi2MNbO7 (M = Fe3+, In3+) crystallize in the same pyrochlore structure, but the lattice parameters decrease with In3+ being substituted by Fe3+. The formation rates of H-2 and O-2 evolutions from an aqueous methanol and a cerium sulfate solution, respectively, increase significantly with In3+ being substituted by Fe3+ under UV irradiation. The H-2 evolution was obtained from pure H2O under UV irradiation with the Bi2MNbO7 (M = Fe3+, In3+) catalyst without co-catalyst such as Pt. The formation rate of H-2 evolution increases with In3+ being substituted by Fe3+. The Bi2FeNbO7 photocatalyst exhibits much higher photocatalytic activity than the well-known TiO2 photocatalyst in pure water.

The catalytic activity is strongly affected by the molybdenum and oxygen content in the alloys. The optimized compositions are between 10 and 20 at.% molybdenum and 5 and 10 at.% oxygen, giving a hydrogen overpotential of less than 100 mV at 4 x 10(3) A m(-2). Furthermore, the cathodes exhibit excellent stability compared with the currently used nickel-sulphur cathode. The decrease in the overpotential by the oxygen addition is attributed to the increase in effective surface area and the enhancement of the rate determining electrochemical desorption of adsorbed hydrogen.

The research focus of lithium-oxygen batteries lies in the development of catalytic materials with excellent cycling stability and high bifunctional catalytic activity in oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions. Here, a hierarchically porous flower-like cobalt-titanium layered double oxide on nickel foam with intercalated anions of bistrifluoromethane sulfonamide (TFSI) is designed and prepared. When used as a binder-free cathode for lithium-oxygen batteries, this material exhibits low polarization (initial polarization of 0.45 V) and superior cycling stability (80 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g(-1) at full discharge/charge). The high electrochemical performance of the cathode material is attributed to the good dispersion of binary elements in its host layer and good compatibility with lithium bistrifluoromethane sulfonamide electrolyte induced by intercalated guest anions of TFSI within its interlayer. This work provides a novel strategy for the fabrication of binder-free cathodes based on layered double oxides for high-performance lithium-oxygen batteries.									60	4	0	0	3	0	60			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000372179100007

Solar energy based photo-thermochemical reaction is a promising method for the CO2 splitting. To further study the photo-thermochemical reaction mechanism and explore the non-titanium-based catalytic materials, the ZnO/Zn2GeO4 composite material (Z/ZGO) was prepared by solution precipitation method and used for photo-thermochemical CO2 splitting. Composite semiconductor combined the advantages of the two components which made CO production reach 5.55 times that of pure ZnO. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to illustrate the crystal structure and chemical composition of the samples. The XRD pattern found that the samples crystallized well, and no obvious crystal form changes occurred after the reaction. Using SEM to observe the samples before and after the reaction, the particle size did not increase significantly and no obvious sintering phenomenon was found, which indicated that the material has good reaction stability. Photoluminescence (PL), UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-visible DRS) and Mott-Schottky plots were used to evaluate the material's light absorption characteristics and energy band position. The band gap of ZnO and Zn2GeO4 samples were 3.27 eV and 4.56 eV, respectively, and the heterojunction was formed in the Z/ZGO sample. The presence of ZnO extended the spectral response range of Zn2GeO4, and due to the migration of photogenerated electron-hole pairs (EHPs) to ZnO, the recombination of EHPs w as reduced. XPS analyses were also used to investigate change of oxygen vacancies during the reaction. The O is XPS spectra of the samples in the three cases (Case A: before light irradiation, Case B: after light irradiation and Case C: after reaction) were analyzed and found that the signal of the oxygen near the vacancies increased after light irradiation and decreased after reaction, which may indicate that oxygen vacancies were formed after light irradiation then consumed by CO2 in the reaction. The Zn2GeO4 sample showed the largest increase in oxygen vacancies signal after light irradiation, indicating that Zn2GeO4 had a strong ability to form oxygen vacancies. Zn2GeO4 improves the capacity of oxygen vacancies formation in the sample. and further improved the yield of photo-thermochemical CO2 splitting reaction. As a result, Z/ZGO combined the advantages of ZnO in light response and Zn2GeO4 in oxygen vacancies formation and improved the CO2 splitting yield. This research has a positive effect on expanding the photo-thermochemical material system and further deepening the photo-thermochemical reaction mechanism.									1	1	0	0	0	0	1			0567-7351			WOS:000589508100013		
J	Yang, Chih-Ping; Fang, Sheng-Uei; Yang, Kuang-Hsuan; Tsai, Hui-Yen; Liu, Yu-Chuan								Effectively reducing reagent concentrations for electrochemical reactions in aqueous solutions using plasmon-activated water								JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				818				44	50		10.1016/j.jelechem.2018.04.027				JUN 1 2018	2018	Most of chemical reactions are performed in aqueous solutions, which are conventionally prepared using laboratory -ready and environmentally friendly deionized (DI) water. Water is generally considered as a passive reactant or as a spectator solvent. In this work, we demonstrate the added reagents for reactions in aqueous solutions can be effectively reduced by utilizing plasmon-activated water (PAW) with reduced hydrogen-bonded (HB) structure instead of conventional DI water with strong HB structure. For electrochemical reactions performing the similar currents the electrolytes used in PAW-based systems are ca. 90% concentrations compared to those used in DI water-based systems. Moreover, these concentrations used in PAW in situ-based systems can be further reduced to ca. 80% of magnitudes for maintaining the similar current levels. More interestingly, the recorded current of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on a catalytic Pt electrode in the PAW-based system (0.09 M KOH) is significantly higher than that in the DI water-based system (0.1 M KOH). That means that the efficiency of the OER performed in a low-electrolyte-concentration alkaline solution can be markedly enhanced by utilizing PAW in spite of the electrolyte concentration is reduced by 10% of magnitude compared to the DI water-based system. These interesting findings promise the PAW for the effective and green reactants and solvents.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000434001200006		
C	Ono, R; Oda, T			IEEE; IEEE; IEEE					Measurement of hydroxyl radicals in an atmospheric pressure discharge plasma by using laser-induced fluorescence								CONFERENCE RECORD OF THE 1998 IEEE INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-3		IEEE INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS SOCIETY ANNUAL MEETING						1777	1783						1998	1998	Hydroxyl radicals were measured by laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) using a tunable KrF excimer laser in an atmospheric pressure discharge plasma. In that LIF, all of the OH (A(2)Sigma-X(2)Pi I(3,0)) branches were identified within a tunable range of the laser. A time evolution of OH density showed that OH density increased with humidity and oxygen concentration. This results indicates OH radicals were mainly produced by chemical reactions of H2O with O radicals. There could be another OH production process other than H2O + O --> 2OH. OH generated by the another reaction reached a peak at about 5 mu s after discharge. It may have been a collisional dissociation of H2O with electrons. OH density augmented after 0.6-mu s pulsed discharge for several tens mu s, then decreasing exponentially. The OH lifetime shortened with increasing pressure. This result implies OH were mainly decreased by a reaction with NO2 generated from O-2 and N-2. Two-dimensional OH distribution was also measured using two-dimensional LIF (2-D LIF) technique. They showed OH radicals proceeded uniformly along a discharge path, then decreasing with horizontal diffusion.

Active and stable catalysts in the photoelectrode are the key component in PEC devices. Although most hydrogen evolution catalysts exhibit excellent performance in acid solutions, earth abundant oxygen evolution catalysts are generally unstable. Therefore, the elaborate design of highly active and stable photocathodes possessing great onset potential in non-acid environments is imperative. Here, we report that magnetron sputtering and electrochemical-deposition preparation methods are compatible with photo-absorbers for depositing titanium (Ti)/cobalt-sulfide (Co-S) catalyst on amorphous silicon/amorphous silicon (a-Si/a-Si) tandem solar cells, realizing a stable, low-cost, and efficient photocathode for water splitting in non-acid solutions. This photocathode exhibits a high photocurrent onset potential of 1.78 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in alkaline and neutral electrolyte, with a photocurrent of 6.34 mA cm(-2) at 0 V vs. RHE. The facile preparation of this highly active a-Si/a-Si/Ti/Co-S photocathode paves the way to integrate them into various oxygen evolution catalysts to develop highly efficient, low-cost, and monolithic PEC solar water splitting devices.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000422949700006

This paper presents a detailed study on synthesis of low cost and efficient nitrogen doped reduced graphene oxide nickle-silver (N-rGO-Ni/Ag) and nickel-cobalt (N-rGO-Ni/Co) nanocomposites as electrocatalysts in fuel cell using one-pot blended reflux condensation route. An admirable correlation in the structures and properties of the synthesized nanocomposites was observed. The Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) values for N-rGO-Ni/Ag and N-rGO-Ni/Co calculated from the onset potential, using Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV), were found to be 1.096 and 1.146. While the half wave potential were determined to be 1.046 and 1.106, respectively, N-rGO-Ni/Ag and N-rGO-Ni/Co. The Tafel and bi-functional (ORR/OER) values were calculated as 76 and 35 mV/decade and 1.23 and 1.12 V, respectively, for N-rGO-Ni/Ag and N-rGO-Ni/Co. The lower onset and half wave potential, low charge transfer resistance (R-ct = 1.20 ohm/cm(2)) and internal solution resistance (R-s = 8.84 x 10(-1) ohm/cm(2)), lower Tafel values (35 mV), satisfactory LSV measurements and mass activity (24.5 at 1.056 V for ORR and 54.9 at 1.056 for OER) demonstrate the remarkable electrocatalytic activity of N-rGO-Ni/Co for both ORR and OER. The chronamperometric stability for synthesized nanocomposites was found satisfactory up to 10 h.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2079-4991		WOS:000764424500001	35214913

Recent developments in bifunctional air electrodes for unitized regenerative proton exchange membrane fuel cells - A review								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				43	46			21478	21501		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.09.152				NOV 15 2018	2018	Unitized regenerative proton exchange membrane fuel cell (UR-PEMFC) technology has progressed in the recent past and has started appearing towards few applications. However, the UR-PEMFC viability is limited by its lower round-trip efficiency mainly due to several reasons such as sluggish air electrode reactions, lower performance/stability, higher materials cost etc. In this context, many approaches are being implemented for efficiency enhancement including design and development of effective bifunctional air electrodes (oxygen reduction and evolution reactions) materials both for fuel cell and electrolyzer modes as well as for optimization of operating condition for performance stability in real life applications. This review focusses on the recent developments of air electrode active materials design/development for performance improvement in UR-PEMFC. Among all developed electrode materials, the catalysts with Pt- and Ir-based metals still provided the maximum round-trip efficiency of about 50% at 500 mA cm(-2) in the unit cell.

This review highlights the structural features essential to satisfy the design of the cathode compartment of ZABs and presents the associated factors that drive the oxygen reactions in the air electrode based on the relationship between the intrinsic activities of bifunctional O-2 catalysts and the collective strategies employed to modify the electronic structure of such electrocatalysts. The first part describes the fundamentals of an ideal air electrode with its corresponding oxygen electrochemical reactions and typical bifunctional O-2 catalysts. In-depth discussion of O-2 catalysts for air electrodes and progress of binder-free air electrodes for ZABs are presented in the following based on three major modification strategies: defect engineering, cation/anion regulation in multi-components transition metal compounds, and single or multi-heteroatom doping in carbon materials (metal-free and metal-based material). The final part summarizes the properties of air electrodes needed to fulfill the requirements of electrically rechargeable ZABs and provides ideas for the future designs of air electrodes.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2166-532X			WOS:000536888200001

We studied the laser processing-induced surface morphology, the elemental composition of the surface, the specific surface increase, the wetting behavior as well as the activity of the hydrogen evolution reaction. It is demonstrated that ultrashort-pulse laser structuring in combination with thin layer catalyst deposition can dramatically boost the performance of cathodes for the hydrogen evolution reaction due to the enormous increase in specific surface in combination with superhydrophilic and superwetting properties leading to a rapid gas bubble detachment.

J	Jeerage, Kavita M.; Candelaria, Stephanie L.; Stavis, Samuel M.								Rapid Synthesis and Correlative Measurements of Electrocatalytic Nickel/Iron Oxide Nanoparticles								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				8						4584	10.1038/s41598-018-22609-x				MAR 15 2018	2018	Electrocatalytic core-shell nanoparticles, such as nickel/iron oxides for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolytes, require rapid synthesis and measurement for practical use. To meet this challenge, we investigated a novel process of adding Ni(II) species to Fe nanoparticles immediately after synthesis, which we expected to yield Ni-rich shells around Fe-rich cores. Cyclic voltammetry showed that the overpotential decreased as the molar ratio of Ni to Fe in the synthesis vessel increased from 0.2 mol Ni:1 mol Fe to 1.5 mol Ni:1 mol Fe, consistent with an increase of Ni composition. Unexpectedly, the overpotential increased abruptly at 2.0 mol Ni:1 mol Fe. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that this synthesis ratio resulted in less Ni at the nanoparticle surfaces than lower synthesis ratios. These results demonstrate the sensitivity of rapid electrochemical measurements to surface composition, and the limits of Ni(II) adsorption and reduction to rapidly form Ni-rich shells around Fe-rich cores. Cyclic voltammetry also showed that the onset of the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) correlates with the oxidation of Ni(OH)(2) to NiOOH. Therefore, tuning materials to improve performance as OER catalysts also improves their performance as MOR catalysts.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			2045-2322			WOS:000427461900002	29545519

Therefore, design and development of low cost, stable and active catalyst for OER process is a challenging issue. In this study we have used cone-shaped pencil graphite (PG), which is commonly used for writing purpose, as anode followed by modification by two-dimensional (2D) nickel sulphide flakes for electrochemical OER in alkaline medium. The dispersed flakes gradually attached to the cone-shaped graphite pencil surface via interaction with exposed graphite sheets along with formation of porous network around the electrode surface via assembly of the flakes. The modified electrocatalyst were well characterized using X-ray diffraction, Raman, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and electrochemical techniques. We have observed that the electrocatalytic activity and stability of the newly designed anode is far greater than standard IrO2 catalyst-modified PG in alkaline medium and comparable with newly reported Ni-based catalysts modified electrode in literature. The unique shape and porous network facilitate mass diffusion process preventing larger bubble formation. Overall, the approach is very simple and cost effective.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0250-4707	0973-7669		WOS:000685132900001

The amorphous borides exhibit activities much higher than the corresponding crystalline (spinel, layered double hydroxide and perovskite) metal oxides containing the identical metal compositions, which have already been regarded as promising OER catalysts. The amorphous Ni/Fe borides showed the best mass normalized OER current density of 50 A g(-1) at an overpotential of 0.35 V, transcending the performance of the state-of-the-art OER catalyst, RuO2. Amorphous transition-metal borides demonstrated extremely high active OER catalytic activity. The outstanding catalytic activity can be attributed to the amorphous structure, the large specific surface areas (above 110 m(2) g(-1)) and the electron-enriched transition metal sites stemming from boron doping. The stoichiometry of the catalysts can be controlled precisely even for the synthesis of quaternary metal boride catalysts, which made it feasible to further optimize the catalytic activity. These results indicated that it is facile to prepare highly active OER catalysts by the one-step chemical reduction process at room temperature.									23	2	0	0	0	0	23			2046-2069			WOS:000404609800061

Here, amorphous NiO 2D layers decorated with Ni and rare earth oxide (REOx) nanoparticles, which possess multiple heterostructures (Ni-NiO and REOx-NiO), have been synthesized by the sequential electrodeposition on carbon cloth. The electrocatalytic performances for the prepared Er2O3/Ni-NiO and CeO2/Ni-NiO have been evaluated, exhibiting improved HER (39 mV@10 mA cm(-2)) and OER (318 mV@50 mA cm(-2)) activities in contrast to the single component, respectively. Additionally, the two-electrode system (Er2O3/Ni-NiO//CeO2/Ni-NiO) presents an excellent OWS property which displays a low potential of 1.58 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2). This work helps to deepen the understanding of the synergetic interaction between dissimilar materials in heterostructured catalyst, and provides guidance for the further exploration and evolution of nanomaterials in green energy conversion technology.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000790854300001

It was found that the addition of Ni nanoparticles could improve the activity of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by a synergistic effect within the Mo2C-modified N-CNFs. As we expected, the as-synthesized Mo2C-Ni@N-CNF with a Ni/Mo ratio of 0.046 was nearly the most efficient non-noble-metal catalyst for the HER with acidic media at present, and has a low overpotential and a small Tafel slope of 65 mV vs. RHE (at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)) and 72 mV dec(-1) respectively, as well as satisfactory stability. Besides, it also has relatively good HER performance in alkaline electrolyte. Hence, this work confirmed that 3d transition metals, which are cheap and abundant, could easily achieve high activity and durability by reasonable design.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000413526200067

Yet, there is very little information on the optimal ratio between platinum and the transition metal used in the alloy and its impact on the electronic properties. Here, we have employed spin-polarised density functional simulations with long-range dispersion corrections [DFT-D3-(BJ)], to investigate the thermodynamics of mixing, as well as the electronic and magnetic properties of the Pt1-xNix solid solution. The Ni incorporation is an exothermic process and the alloy composition Pt0.5Ni0.5 is the most thermodynamically stable. The Pt0.5Ni0.5 solid solution is highly ordered as it is composed mainly of two symmetrically inequivalent configurations of homogeneously distributed atoms.

NiFe-based oxides have promising activity towards the oxygen evolution (OER). However, they usually show unsatisfactory performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), due to their large particle size with limited active sites and poor conductivity. Herein, we report the synthesis of sulfur-incorporated NiFe2O4 nanosheets on nickel foam (S-NiFe2O4/NF), composed of ultra-small nanoparticles (similar to 2 nm), by a facile confined growth strategy with the assistance of thiourea. Due to the favorable 3D hierarchical structure, the self-supported electrocatalyst endows abundant active sites, high electrical conductivity and rapid mass transfer, thereby achieving remarkable catalytic performance for overall water splitting under alkaline and neutral conditions. Specifically, the optimal S-NiFe2O4/NF electrode requires only 1.65 and 1.95 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH and 1.0 M PBS, respectively, outperforming that of the commercial Pt/C as well as its counterparts (i.e. S-NiO/NF, S-Fe3O4/NF and pure NiFe2O4/NF). In addition, the synthesis strategy developed here can be applied to other mixed transition metal oxides with similar morphology and structure for various applications, such as supercapacitors, metal-air batteries, and photocatalysis.									258	13	0	0	16	0	259			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000411687800030

An equimolar mixture of triglyme (G3) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide (Li[TFSA]), and a G3/Li[TFSA] mixture containing excess glyme were chosen as the SIL and the conventional electrolyte, respectively. Charge behavior and accompanying gas evolution of the two electrolytes was investigated by electrochemical mass spectrometry (ECMS). From the linear sweep voltammetry performed on an as-prepared cell, we demonstrate that the SIL has a higher oxidative stability than the conventional electrolyte and, furthermore, offers the advantage of lower volatility, which would benefit an open-type lithium-O-2 cell design. Moreover, CO2 evolution during galvanostatic charge was less in the SIL, which implies less side reaction. However, O-2 evolution during charge did not reach the theoretical value in either of the two electrolytes. Several mass spectral fragments were generated during the charge process, which provided evidence for side reactions of glyme-based electrolytes. We further relate the difference in observed discharge product morphology for these electrolytes to the solubility of the superoxide intermediate, determined by rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) measurements.									43	2	0	0	3	0	43			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000394829800040	28121136

The catalyst for the VRFB positive electrode discharge reaction, i.e., the dioxovanadium ion reduction, was formed by coating the surface of cup-stack carbon nanotubes with a carbonaceous thin film with the Fe-N-4 site generated by the sublimation, deposition, and pyrolysis of iron phthalocyanine. In this study, the influence of the physical properties of the catalyst on the electrochemical reactions was investigated to optimize the coating. With an increase in the coating, the specific surface area increased, whereas the pore size decreased. The surface Fe concentration was increased in spite of the Fe aggregation inside the carbon matrix. The catalytic activity enhancement was achieved due to the increase in the specific surface area and the surface Fe concentration, but was lowered due to the decrease in the pore size, which was disadvantageous for the penetration of the electrolyte and the mass transfer.

Herein, we provide an earth-abundant, low-cost, and highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst composed of cobalt sulfide (Co9S8) and molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) nanoparticles anchored to metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-derived nitrogen, sulfur-codoped graphitic carbon (Co9S8-NSC@Mo2C). The new composite mode of the electrocatalyst was realized through simple pyrolysis processes. The composite electrocatalyst shows outstanding hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance and excellent stability over the entire pH range. For example, it has a lower overpotential of 74, 89, and 121 mV with the Tafel slopes of 69.3, 86.7, and 106.4 mV dec(-1) to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1.0 M KOH, and 1.0 M phosphate-buffered saline solutions, respectively. Moreover, it shows a small overpotential of 293 mV with a Tafel slope of 59.7 mV dec(-1) to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1.0 M KOH. The significantly enhanced HER and OER activities of Co9S8-NSC@Mo2C are mainly attributable to the electron transfer from Co to Mo2C, resulting in a lower Mo valence and a higher Co valence in Co9S8-NSC@Mo2C. Furthermore, using the Co9S8-NSC@Mo2C bifunctional electrocatalyst as both the anode for the OER and the cathode for the HER for overall water splitting, a cell voltage of only 1.61 V is needed to derive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This interesting work offers a general method for designing and fabricating highly efficient and stable non-noble electrocatalysts for promising energy conversion.									71	2	0	0	3	0	72			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000438179000057	29882412

The effects of adsorption time length, gas phase composition (H-2 or O-2 addition), temperature and contact time were investigated. Results showed that the high surface and the large availability of labile oxygen allows CO oxidation and CO2 release even at room temperature. Moreover, tests under transient conditions showed that i) interfacial copper/ceria sites re-oxidation can benefit of oxygen transfer from ceria depending on the operating conditions (O-2 partial pressure, temperature, etc.), hydroxyl groups, boosting CO2 production rate, can be formed over the catalyst surface by reaction with molecular H-2 at temperature above 80 degrees C, and iii) several CO and CO2 adsorbed species must be taken into account, covering not only copper but also ceria sites, some of them being spectators in the reaction pathway. Finally a novel strategy for CO removal based on CO trap is proposed. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, novel MOF-derived nickel nitride on nickel foam catalysts were successfully synthesized at different temperatures (300, 350, 400 degrees C) (denoted as C-T, T = 300, 350, 400). C-350 was demonstrated to be a highly active and durable 3D catalyst toward urea oxidation reaction (UOR), with a required potential of 1.337 V at 10 mA/cm(2). At the same time, C-350 has higher catalytic performance toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) than other materials with a low overpotential of 47 mV at 10 mA/cm(2). Furthermore, its two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer only needs a voltage of 1.503 V to obtain 100 mA/cm(2), which is 0.160 V lower than that of pure water splitting. Also, the current density can be maintained for at least 24 h, showing its potential for practical applications.									54	0	0	0	0	0	54			2168-0485			WOS:000535305600018

Although an enhanced photocurrent in photoanodes upon functionalization with metallic nanostructures has been observed in several studies, to the best of our knowledge no measurements of the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have been reported for such systems. This work characterizes the FE on a model system consisting of ultra-thin films of hematite (Fe2O3) sensitized with Ti/Au nanodisks. Compared to bare hematite references, sensitized samples showed significantly enhanced photocurrents as well as O-2 evolution. Experimental evidence suggests that the observed enhancement was not due to photocatalytic activity of the nanodisks. The FE has been determined to be 100%, within the experimental errors, for both sensitized and reference samples. Also, this work demonstrates that the sensitized samples were stable for at least 16 hours photocurrent testing. The concepts shown in this work are generally applicable to any situation in which a semiconductor has its water splitting performance enhanced by metallic nanostructures.									26	2	0	0	1	0	26			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000328643900051	24297250

Therefore, rapid discrimination of adsorbed oxygen and lattice oxygen is highly desired. Herein, a direct correlation between cataluminescence (CTL) kinetic curve and oxygen species was discovered. The adsorbed oxygen-catalyzed CTL only lasted for a few minutes, whereas the lattice oxygen-catalyzed CTL could exhibit hours of continuous luminescence. The long-term CTL was attributed to the slow migration of lattice oxygen in a slow and continuous catalytic oxidation reaction. In addition to the discrimination between the adsorbed oxygen and lattice oxygen by the CTL kinetic processes, the corresponding CTL intensity was positively proportional to their amounts. Accordingly, the developed catalytic oxidation-related CTL can be used as an indicator for rapid discrimination and determination of adsorbed oxygen and lattice oxygen in catalysts. Oxygen species detected by the proposed CTL method not only matched well with those obtained by conventional X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and O-2-temperature programmed methods but also offered some distinguished advantages, such as convenient operation, fast response, and low cost. It can be expected that the established oxygen-responsive CTL probe has great potential in distinguishing adsorbed oxygen and lattice oxygen in various catalysts.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000742120000001	34985873

The compatibility of this drum for the storage of a mixture of thionyl chloride and ethyl acetate was investigated by thermochemical studies, condensed phase and off gas analysis. The chemical incompatibility of the ternary mixtures (thionyl chloride/ethyl acetate/zinc) resulted in an exothermic runaway reaction with extensive gas evolution, which has not been heretofore described in the literature. Storage in a drum was simulated in a half-liter, high pressure containment vessel. Adiabatic calorimeter data are also presented to illustrate the mass transfer process involved in the induction period and the runaway reaction characteristics. Ethyl acetate is inert with thionyl chloride. However, in the presence of metallic zinc, an equimolar amount of each component are consumed by the reaction to generate ethyl chloride (g), sulfur dioxide (g), acetyl chloride (1) and sulfur (s). It was also found that the rate of gas evolution is highly dependent on the molar ratio of the thionyl chloride or ethyl acetate to metallic zinc in the solution. Based on the semi-batch process experiments, the reaction mechanism is proposed. A potential hazard indication based on the oxygen balance for the reaction mixture is also discussed. Data on similar ternary mixtures are presented.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1066-8527			WOS:A1994NZ07300007

However, inevitable aggregation during the fabrication and electrochemical processes result in unfavorable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities as well as poor stability and durability. Herein, novel ultrafine metallic Co nanodots 2.2 nm in diameter are embedded in the wall of N-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) grafted on VN to form the hybrid structure of Co/N-CNT/VN by a simple process. Owing to the abundant active sites on the Co nanodots, high electron/mass transfer ability, and good structural and electrochemical durability, Co/N-CNT/VN has outstanding OER and HER properties such as low overpotentials of 240 mV and 63.4 mV at 10 mV cm(-2), respectively. For demonstration, the overall water splitting cell composed of the bifunctional Co/N-CNT/VN catalyst as both electrodes can be driven by a standard 1.5 V AAA battery. The novel concept and materials can be extended to the preparation of CNTs embedded with other ultrafine metal nanoparticles such as Fe, Co, and Ni for energy applications.									53	2	0	0	1	0	53			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000560077100001

Herein, a facile and controllable synthesis strategy for nickel-cobalt bimetal phosphide nanotubes as highly efficient electrocatalysts for overall water splitting via low-temperature phosphorization from a bimetallic metal-organic framework (MOF-74) precursor is reported. By optimizing the molar ratio of Co/Ni atoms in MOF-74, a series of CoxNi gamma P catalysts are synthesized, and the obtained Co4Ni1P has a rare form of nanotubes that possess similar morphology to the MOF precursor and exhibit perfect dispersal of the active sites. The nanotubes show remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performance in an alkaline electrolyte, affording a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 129 mV for HER and 245 mV for OER, respectively. An electrolyzer with Co4Ni1P nanotubes as both the cathode and anode catalyst in alkaline solutions achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.59 V, which is comparable to the integrated Pt/C and RuO2 counterparts and ranks among the best of the metal-phosphide electrocatalysts reported to date.									522	24	0	0	18	0	527			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000413756000013

The amount of the radicals was about 70% greater under photoinhibitory conditions than under moderate light intensity. Superoxide production was inhibited by DCMU and enhanced 4-5 times by methyl viologen. These observations suggest that the superoxide in illuminated thylakoids is from the Mehler reaction occurring in Photosystem I, and its formation is not primarily due to electron transport modifications brought about by photoinhibition,Artificial generation of superoxide from riboflavin accelerated slightly the photoinduced degradation of the Photosystem II reaction centre protein D1 but did not accelerate the loss of oxygen evolution supported by a Photosystem II electron acceptor. However, analysis of the protein breakdown products demonstrated that this added superoxide did not increase the amount of fragments brought about by photoinhibition but introduced an additional pathway of damage.On the basis of the above observations we propose that superoxide radicals are not the main promoters of acceptor-side-induced photoinhibition of Photosystem II.									24	1	0	0	18	0	25			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:A1995UB05000003	24301634

The ethylenediamine-cobalt complex was synthesized by solid state reaction. Two sample systems of the complex, separately exposuring dioxygen for 10 minutes and continuously adsorbing oxygen for 6 clays, were selected as investigated objects. Under the electrospray positive ion detection mode, the oxygenated ethylenediamine-cobalt complex dissociated readily to various characteristic fragment ions of the oxygenated complexes. One of the fragment ions (m/z 150.86) of the oxygenated complexes were confirmed by its daughter fragmen ion (m/z 118.85) which just lost a neutral fragment of dioxygen (M=32) by further scan fragmentizing. The experimental results indicated that the uptaking of dioxygen is an ageing process, and the structure of the oxygenated complex was changed from dinuclear peroxo-bridged complex to dinuclear peroxo-hydroxo dibridge complex in the evolution of oxygenation. Based on these results, the possible structures, corresponding fragmentation mechanism and the form of dioxygen existed in the oxygenated complex were proposed. ESI-MS method was confirmed to be an effective technique for characterizing oxygenated complexes and researching the oxygenation.									6	4	0	0	1	0	6			1001-4861			WOS:000297033000021

Herein, a salt-templated strategy is proposed to construct novel multicomponent Co/CoxMy (M = P, N) hybrids with outstanding electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The obtained Co/CoxMy hybrids present porous sheet-like architecture consisting of many hierarchical secondary building-units. The synthetic strategy depends on a facile and effective dissolution-recrystallization-pyrolysis process under NH3 atmosphere of the precursors, which does not involve any surfactant or long-time hydrothermal pretreatment. That is different from the conventional methods for the synthesis of hierarchical nitrides/phosphides. Benefitting from unique composition/structure-dependent merits, the Co/CoxMy hybrids as a typical Mott-Schottky electrocatalyst exhibit good OER performance in an alkaline medium compared with their counterparts, as evidenced by a low overpotential of 334 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 79.2 mV dec(-1), as well as superior long-term stability.

P dopant dosage is tailored to adjust active sites and crystalline phases of Co2P/CoP@NPGC. The active Co2P and CoP NPs and the synergistic effect from the Co-Nx/C and Co-P/C active sites and porous NPGC make the dominant contributions to the ORR/OER. For ORR, the half-wave potential of Co2P/CoP@NPGC-1 is 0.93 V, which is superior to that of Pt/C (E-1/2 = 0.875 V). As for OER, Co2P/CoP@NPGC-1 displays a lower overpotential (eta = 340 mV) compared to RuO2 (eta = 380 mV, at 10 mA cm(-2)). The Co2P@CoOOH heterojunction guarantees intrinsic conductivity. Furthermore, doping with N and P can modify the surface electronic structure of catalyst to lower the energy of oxygen adsorption and dissociation, which are beneficial to enhance the ORR and OER activity. Additionally, its bifunctional activity parameter (Delta E) for ORR and OER is only 0.64 V, which is lower than that of Pt/C and RuO2 (0.76 V). Therefore, this work proposes a new sight into constructing a competitive core-shell MOFs derived electrocatalyst for ORR/OER. (C) 2021 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.

Results indicate that the combination of antiferromagnetic superexchange interactions of the spinel lattice determines the Curie temperature (T-c) value. The AB interaction dominates over the sublattice interactions, and Fe3+ occupies A sites, and Cr3+ and Co2+ ions occupy octahedral sites because of large crystal field stabilization energy. The saturation magnetization (as) coercivity (He), remnant field (Hr) and electrical resistivity are observed to decrease with the progressive replacement of Fe3+ ions (d(5), five unpaired electrons) by Cr3+ ions (d(3), three unpaired electrons). However, the electrocatalytic activity of the oxides towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M KOH at 25 degrees C increases with the increase in x; the optimum improvement in the apparent electrocatalytic activity being with 1.0 mol Cr. At low overpotentials, the OER on substituted compounds displayed a Tafel slope of b = 50 +/- 5 mV decade(-1) and the reaction order with respect to OH- concentration as unity, regardless of the composition of the oxide catalyst. It seems that the electrocatalytic activity and saturation magnetization/Curie temperature for the oxide are inversely related. (c) 2005 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

Although the fluorite structure of Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 (Ce2Zr2O8) exhibits good oxygen storage and release properties, its reduced counterpart Ce2Zr2O7 in the pyrochlore structure derived from the fluorite structure does, not. Here, we present an analysis of the structural evolution of Ce2Zr2O7+z from pyrochlore-Ce2Zr2O7 (z = 0) to fluorite-Ce2Zr2O8 (z = 1) using first-principles density functional theoretical calculations and bond-valence theory and correlate the consequent activation of oxygen to the observed oxygen storage capacity. The gradual addition of oxygen atoms to the otherwise ordered vacant tetrahedral sites for anions in pyrochlore-Ce2Zr2O7 structure will lead to a transition to fluorite-Ce2Zr2O8 structure, and we demonstrate,that this transition involves an increase in the number of weakly bonded, activated oxygen sites that areliertinent to higher OSC observed for the fluorite-Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 structure. The structural descriptors of OSC demonstrated:here will facilitate the understanding and rational design of oxide materials with improved OSC, which is key to catalyzing a number of reactions for Various applications.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1932-7447			WOS:000393008900048

However, few works have been reported to enhance the intrinsic catalytic activity of 1T-oS(2) in basic solutions, which is more applicable for water splitting in large-scale applications. Here, we report a hydrothermal process for synthesizing cobalt-doped 1T-MoS2 nanosheets. The cobalt-doped 1T-MoS2 exhibits an overpotential of 240 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH aqueous solutions and a small Tafel slope of 68 mV dec(-1), which is much better than that of the pristine 1T-MoS2 and even superior to other MoS2-based catalysts operated in acid solutions. Moreover, the cobalt-doped 1T-MoS2 nanosheets show high stability, and remain metallic phase after being reserved in water for one month. Calculations based on density functional theory reveal that Co doping does not transform the pristine 1T-MoS2 into its semiconducting counterpart. In addition, the reduction of energy barrier of the initial water dissociation step is responsible for the facilitated HER process.									27	1	0	0	0	0	27			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000519657100001

The NixCo10-x/C (0 <= x <= 10) nano-catalysts were synthesized by a water-in-oil microemulsion method and were then characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The control of a metal loading of ca. 30 wt% on carbon was confirmed for all catalysts from TGA, while TEM images and XRD patterns revealed the formation of nickel cobalt hydroxide nano-flakes with a preferential growth along the (1 0 0) and (0 1 0) directions. The electrochemical investigations in 0.1 M NaOH confirmed the interaction between nickel and cobalt in the catalytic materials, and their activity towards the HER. The catalytic activity increased regularly with the increase of the cobalt content in the NixCo10-x/C materials. The short term stability measurements performed by chrono-amperometry revealed that dissolution of cobalt occurred. Hence, amongst the nickel cobalt hydroxides synthesized, Ni5Co5/C and Ni7Co3/C catalysts were found to present a good compromise between catalytic activity for the HER and stability.

In this work, a novel vanadium doped nickel cobalt phosphide catalyst supported on carbon cloth (V-NiCoP/CC) is fabricated by a facile hydrothermal and phosphate method. Remarkably, V-NiCoP/CC only need the overpotential of 52 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution, which is superior to many state-of-art transition monometallic phosphides electrocatalysts. Meanwhile, V-NiCoP/CC exhibits a low tafel slope of 51.2 mV dec(-1) and superior stability in 2000 CV cycles and 40 h of long-term stability test.

Metallic 1T phase of MoS2 with good electronic conductivity and abundant electrocatalytic active sites is favorable for electrocatalysis. In addition, bridging S22- has been verified as the major active sites for HER. However, there is a lack of in-depth understanding for the coexistence of 1T phase and bridging S22- of MoS2. Herein, a facile hydrazine hydrate-assisted method is reported to synthesize sulfurrich MoS2. Specifically, when higher ratio of 1T to 2H phase was obtained, a higher proportion of bridging S22- to terminal S22- was produced simultaneously. With an optimum amount of hydrazine hydrate, MoS2 exhibits a low overpotential of 173 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2, a small Tafel slope of 56.6 mV dec-1, and long-term stability in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. This work provides a new insight for improving the electrocatalytic activity of MoS2 via a simple method. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

A Ni oxyhydroxide nanosheet (NiNS) is among the most widely studied OER catalysts but still suffers from low activity, sluggish kinetics, and poor stability. Herein, we incorporate MoO3 patches into NiNS to form a nanosheet with an intimate Ni-Mo interface (NiMoNS) for the OER The overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope on NiMoNS (260 mV, 54.7 mV dec(-1)) are lower than those on NiNS (296 mV, 89.3 mV dec(-1)), implying that higher activity and faster kinetics are achieved on NiMoNS. There is no change in electrocatalytic efficiency of NiMoNS after 18 h of OER, but the electrocatalytic efficiency of NiNS decreases by 56% after only 8 h of OER. Thus, NiMoNS has better stability. The intimate Ni-Mo interface promotes two-dimensional lateral growth of NiMoNS to form a surface area 1.5 times larger than that of NiNS, and facilitates electron transfer from Ni to Mo. This makes the Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio on the NiMoNS surface (1.32) higher than that on the NiNS surface (0.68). Moreover, the Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio on NiMoNS surface increases to 1.81 after 18 h of OER but the Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio on the NiNS surface decreases to 0.51 after 8 h of OER. Therefore, the NiMoNS surface has more abundant and stable Ni3+ sites which are catalytically active toward OER This could be the reason for the enhanced activity, kinetics, and stability of NiMoNS. The results are very valuable for fabricating more efficient catalysts for electrocatalysis.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000662086600046	34038083

Hence, the production and utilization of clean energy such as hydrogen are crucial. As significant electrochemical reactions in energy conversion devices, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) have garnered considerable attention. However, the sluggish kinetics of these reactions, especially of the OER and ORR because of the multiple electron transfer steps, and the inevitable usage of noble metal catalysts (such as those based on Pt for HER/ORR and Ru/Ir for HER/OER) are the bottlenecks to realizing energy conversion devices, including overall water-splitting electrolyzers, fuel cells, and metal-air batteries. Therefore, the development of efficient non-precious metal catalysts is imperative. Transition metal nitrides (TMNs) have been recently studied and shown to exhibit high catalytic activity because of their ability to alter the electronic structure of host metals, specifically the downshift of the d-band center, the contraction of the filled state, and the broadening of the unfilled state. This high activity is attributed to the optimization of the adsorption energy between metals and adsorbates. In addition, metallic bonding in TMNs increases the conductivity of the catalysts. Thus, in this review, we focus on the latest developments in TMNs and their application as high-activity and high-stability electrocatalysts for water splitting and in fuel cells and zinc-air batteries. First, the origin of the high activity of TMNs is explained with the help of the d-band theory. The effect of nitrogen on TMNs, such as in terms of the location in the crystal structure, is briefly discussed. The preparation strategies for TMNs, including physical and chemical methods as well as the modification techniques such as doping, changing carrier properties, and defect construction, are outlined. Next, we summarize the applications of TMNs as an electrocatalyst for the HER, OER, and ORR. At the same time, to explain the bifunctional catalytic activity of TMNs, we discuss the modification strategies for single-metal-based nitrides, such as doping with other highly active atoms to adjust the electronic structure and increase the catalytic activities as well as using coupling materials with different catalytic selectivities to construct heterostructures. Finally, we discuss the challenges and development approaches for realizing the electrocatalytic applications of TMNs, such as through further improvement in catalytic activity, and for facilitating in-depth understanding of electrocatalytic processes through in situ characterization to reveal the electrocatalytic mechanism of TMNs. Undoubtedly, this review will promote the application of TMNs in the field of electrocatalysis.									19	1	0	0	1	0	20			1000-6818			WOS:000616616500018

It is critical to tailor the metal/oxide heterostructure and find out the structureactivity relationship. Herein, the tuning of the Ni/NiO interfacial structure and its influence on the HER activity were systematically studied. Ni/NiO-cp was prepared by controlling the nucleation rate and orientational growth of NiO. Plentiful wormlike NiO nanoflakes were produced on interlaced Ni nanosheets. Ni/NiO-cp possessed abundant oxygen vacancies, a high content of surface hydroxyl species, and numerous metal/oxide interfaces. Not only the adsorption of H2O molecules was accelerated but also the electrolyte penetration and proton transport were both facilitated. As a result, the HER overpotential to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) was significantly reduced by 124 mV as compared with that of the unmodified counterpart (asdeposited Ni). The performance of Ni/NiO-cp was superior to that of Pt/C at high currents (>100 mA cm(-2)). The facile regulation technique and the structure-activity relationship reported here are helpful for the discovery of low-cost and efficient HER catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2574-0962			WOS:000823259900001

Due to the low efficiency of water splitting, innovative breakthroughs are desirable to improve efficiency significantly. Nowadays, the rational design of non-precious metal-based robust bifunctional catalysts is considered to be a feasible way to promote both the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we proposed a vanadium doped CoP nanorods array catalyst grown on carbon cloth (V-CoP NRs/CC) as a bifunctional electrode material. When V-CoP NRs/CC employed as both anode and cathode materials, it only demands low cell voltages of 1.491 V and 1.606 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (j(10)) and 50 mA cm(-2) (j(50)) in 1 M KOH alkaline electrolyte. Especially, V-CoP NRs/CC can maintain its outstanding electrocatalytic performance for more than 40 h at j(50) in overall water splitting. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Herein, different tungsten-inert gas (TIG) welding electrodes, namely, pure tungsten (W), zirconiated tungsten (W-Zr), ceriated tungsten (W-Ce) and lanthanated tungsten (W-La) electrodes, are introduced as low-cost, green and pH-universal electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The morphology, microstructure and composition of these electrodes have been investigated using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and elemental mapping techniques. The electrocatalytic activity of the electrodes has been studied under acidic, basic and neutral conditions using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), open circuit potential (OCP) measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and the values of the onset potential (E-onset), overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(10)), Tafel slope, OCP and charge transfer resistance (R-ct) have been obtained for each electrode.

Here, we report that the core-shell structured Ni12P5/Ni-3(PO4)(2) hollow spheres (Ni12P5/Ni-3(PO4)(2)-HS) exhibits high activity and stability towards both HER and OER in strong alkaline media. A current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is generated at an overpotential of 0.114V and 0318 V in 1 M KOH for HER and OER, respectively. The high activity is attributed to the hollow core-shell (Ni12P5/Ni-3(PO4)(2)) structure that the material adopts under catalytic conditions. The Ni12P5/Ni-3(PO4)(2)-HS can serve as both cathode and anode catalysts for a real water electrolysis cell, which generates a current density of 357.6mA cm(-2) at 1.8V and stable at 300mA cm(-2) for at least 100h, the potential catalytic degradation mechanism has been systematically studied and discussed.

However, most progress focused on developing mono-metal phosphide nanostructures. In this work, a facile template-based method and low-temperature phosphorization process are proposed to fabricate self-supported Ni-based bimetallic phosphide encapsulated in amorphous carbon by using metal-organic framework (MOF) as the precursor and three-dimensional nickel foam (NF) as the support, which is termed as Ni2P-Co2P@C/NF. This composite demonstrates remarkable electrocatalytic activities towards both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline electrolyte (1 M KOH, pH 13.6), affording low overpotentials of 290 and 167 mV to deliver the current density of 50 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER, respectively, preceding the majority of recently reported MOFs-derived TMPs. This excellent performance is considered as the results of its large catalytic surface area, concerted synergy from composited structure as well as the increased electrical conductivity.

Therefore, perovskite-type oxides as functional materials have attracted considerable research interest in energy conversion and storage systems. Advancing energy devices requires a fundamental and deep understanding of precatalysts and corresponding reaction mechanisms, such as the key intermediates and the real active species under working conditions. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) supported by synchrotron radiation is a powerful tool used to capture the electronic structures and local environments of electrocatalysts. In this review, recent advances regarding the application of XAS for the characterization of perovskite-type oxide electrocatalysts are summarized. Special attention is given to the recently developed advanced operando XAS techniques to uncover the reaction mechanism on the surface. The collected information reveals not only the dynamic nature of perovskite oxides and structural and chemical changes during the reactions but also the important role of perovskite-type oxides as promising candidates for electrocatalysts. Finally, emerging opportunities and some current challenges facing the development of high-performance perovskite oxides and perspectives on future techniques are discussed.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000636902800013

The ultrafast Joule heating procedure simultaneously enables the reduction of graphene oxide and the incorporation of metal and nitrogen atoms into the graphene matrix within 2-second period. Meanwhile, the transient quenching avoids the extended heating-induced atom aggregation, ensuring the rapid and stable dispersion of atomic-scale CoNx active sites in graphene. Additionally, the interconnected macropores and nanopores formed by the self-assembly of graphene sheets facilitate the unimpeded ion and gas transport during the catalytic process. When used as an electrode for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the fabricated freestanding CoNG-JH exhibits high catalytic activity and durability with a low overpotential of 106 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 66 mV.dec(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The presented synthesis and design strategy open up a rapid and facile route for the manufacturing of single atom catalysts.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000736419000002

The surface morphology, chemical composition and electrochemical characteristics of these electrodes were studied by various physico-chemical techniques such as X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical properties of the electrodes were examined by steady-state polarization curves. First, the influence of features such as Ni/Fe composition and type of substrate for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were determined by electrochemical techniques in a conventional 3-electrodes cell. The overpotential for the OER is lower for the electrodes with the higher concentrations of Ni. The electrodes with a Ni/Fe composition of 75/25 wt.% electrodeposited on steel mesh and/or 75/25 and 50/50 wt.% on nickel foam result in the most active configurations for the OER. These electrodes were further tested as anodes for alkaline water electrolysis during at least 70 h. In order to understand their activity and stability, the used electrodes were also characterized by SEM and compared to the fresh electrodes. Among the compositions and substrates examined, the Ni50Fe50-Nf electrode exhibited the lowest overpotential (2.1 V) for the OER and the higher stability as anode in an alkaline water electrolysis cell.

J	SHIMADA, S								A KINETIC AND THERMOANALYTICAL STUDY ON OXIDATION OF POWDER AND SINGLE-CRYSTAL SAMPLES OF NIOBIUM CARBIDE								OXIDATION OF METALS				42	5-6			357	373						DEC 1994	1994	The oxidation of two kinds of NbC, powder and single-crystal samples, was carried out isothermally at temperatures of 390 to 610 degrees C at an oxygen partial pressure of 8 kPa using an electromicrobalance. The kinetics results suggested that the oxidation of both powder and crystal samples proceeds essentially by a phase-boundary-controlled reaction. It was found that cracking of grains or particles in the powder samples, which occurs in the later stage, accelerates oxidation below 485 degrees C, and extremely rapid reaction proceeds above that temperature. Simultaneous TG-DTA-MS measurement showed that the reaction above 485 degrees C is due to a large heat evolution resulting from rapid oxidation of bare NbC surfaces produced by cracking of grains or particles, which was partly caused by immediate release of CO2 accumulated in them. Scanning electron microscopy of the crystals showed that columnar, porous grains with the major axis normal to the surface formed, which were responsible for the phase-boundary-controlled reaction of the oxidation of both powder and crystal samples.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0030-770X			WOS:A1994PZ23600002

Silicon carbide was investigated computationally as a metal-free, surface-derived catalyst for the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction. As demonstrated by first-principle calculations, Si-terminated and C-terminated surfaces, with the Si and C as active sites, are all reactive for dinitrogen capture and activation, resembling the catalytic behavior of popular B-based electrocatalysts, but the latter (C-terminated) offers an ultralow over-potential of 0.39 V, which is lower than most metals and alloys, while retarding hydrogen evolution. This research enriches the design of catalysts for dinitrogen fixation under ambient conditions, and also highlights a new direction for Si-based materials for nitrogen reduction.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000576194400012	32959820

TG results showed that the oxidation of ZrC and HfC begins at a fixed temperature of 380 and 400 degreesC, respectively, independent of P-O2 and the type of sample. The degree of reaction, defined for the complete carbide oxide transformation, reached a maximum of 103-160%, then gradually returning to 100% at higher temperatures. For the oxidation of ZrC, a sharp exothermic DTA peak appeared at P-O2 greater than or equal to 10 kPa with the corresponding CO2 evolution but broad DTA and CO2 evolution peaks occurred at P-O2 less than or equal to 5 kPa. The oxidation of HfC gave two exothermic DTA peaks at all pressures, the higher temperature peak agreeing with the CO2 evolution. Oxidation exceeding 100%, related with the formation of carbon, is discussed from the results of TG, DTA, MS and X-ray analysis. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Towards addressing this issue, we designed and sequentially synthesized Fe2O3 and FeP nanoparticles encapsulated on a carbonaceous matrix nanoarchitecture (Fe2O3@C and FeP@C) from an Fe-based 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate framework (Fe-MIL-88B) through high-temperature pyrolysis followed by a solid-/gas-phase low-temperature phosphidation process. These nanoparticles were employed as bifunctional electrocatalysts deposited onto a Si photoelectrode assembly. The changes in morphological and electronic properties of the as-prepared catalysts were investigated after controlled heat treatment. As-synthesized Fe2O3@C/Si and FeP@C/Si were found to be superior bifunctional photoelectrodes in a neutral aqueous medium under simulated solar irradiation of 100 mWcm(-2). Fe2O3@C/Si exhibited high activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), providing a photoanodic current density of 2.5 mAcm(-2) at 1.65 V (vs. RHE), which was driven by the type-II heterojunction model in the Fe2O3@C/Si system. In parallel, the FeP@C/Si materials exhibited noticeable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity, generating 10 mAcm(-2) cathodic current at -0.07 V (vs. RHE). The varied performance could be attributed to the bulk size dependency of the crystalline Fe2O3 phase on the conductive sp(2)-hybridized carbon framework and an intrinsic synergetic effect in the FeP@C, which originates from electronic interactions between Fe and P with high porosity, and which permits easy diffusion of the electrolyte and efficient electron transfer during hydrogen generation.									22	1	0	0	0	0	22			2196-0216			WOS:000446066100018

Here, we report a facile self-catalyzed growth strategy for in situ encapsulation of Co nanoparticles with N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) on Ni foam (NF) (Co/NCNTs-NF-T; Trepresents the pyrolysis temperature). The zeolite imidazole framework (ZIF-67) pre-cursor, which was used as a structure inducer, provided a Co source for catalyzing melamine graphitization and promoted in situ growth of NCNTs on the NF surface. This encapsulation structure and self-supporting system enhance the HER and OER activities of Co/NCNTs-NF-900 (low overpotentials of 66.98 mV for the HER and 240.32 mV for the OER at 10 mA cm(-2)). This binder-free catalyst for overall water splitting, i.e., Co/NCNTs-NF-900, has excellent catalytic activity and durability. This method offers a facile and green strategy for designing highly active bifunctional electrocatalysts and paves the way for the future development of energy conversion/storage systems.

In this work, successful results have been obtained with considerations of internal oxygen cycle and gas phase in the valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) cells. The success is first attributed to the satisfactory validation of a mathematical model that has been able to simulate discharge regimes with various rates consistently. The model has been subsequently used to simulate a galvanostatic charge regime performed at C/10. The results give a better understanding of the role each electrode played in the polarization, the nature of the polarization (constituted by reaction kinetics and mass transport), and the charging efficiency. We were able to extrapolate the simulation results to rates beyond what the model has been validated for, and the results are still consistent, confirming some experimental observations, notably the maximum charging rate specified by most LAB manufacturers.

Herein, Co-Fe-P-Se nanoparticles supported on two-dimensional nitrogen-doped carbon (Co-Fe-P-Se/NC) to construct a three-dimensional nanostructure were obtained under the assistance of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The two-dimensional nanosheet facilitated the electron transfer rate and exposed abundant active sites. The three-dimensional morphology composed of nanosheets was favorable for electrolyte transport and provided abundant channels for gas diffusion during the catalytic process. Moreover, the coexistence of Co and Fe had important effects on promoting the catalytic performances. Lastly, the catalytic performances for OER and ORR could be promoted effectively after the introduction of selenium and phosphorous in the designed electrocatalyst. Benefiting from the above merits, the prepared Co-Fe-P-Se/NC exhibited excellent catalytic performances for OER (overpotential of 0.27 V at 10 mA cm(-2)), ORR (half-wave potential of 0.76 V) and rechargeable batteries (a low voltage gap of 0.719 V, high power density of 104 mW cm(-2) at 200 mA cm(-2) and high energy density of 805 W h Kg(Zn)(-1)). Moreover, the prepared electrocatalyst possessed more stable long-term stability in all the conducted experiments. This work provides a novel approach to develop and construct high-performance bifunctional nanocatalysts for metal-air batteries.									59	10	0	0	3	0	63			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000498838100048	31613298

The edge site chemistry of Co-OEC has been probed by using a dinuclear cobalt complex. O-17 NMR spectroscopy shows that ligand exchange of OH/OH2 at Co(III) edge sites is slow, which is also confirmed by DEMS experiments of Co-OEC. In borate (B-i) and phosphate (P-i) buffers, anions must be displaced to allow water to access the edge sites for an O-O bond coupling to occur. Anion exchange in P-i is slow, taking days to equilibrate at room temperature. Conversely, anion exchange in B-i is rapid (k(assoc) = 13.1 +/- 0.4 M-1 s(-1) at 25 degrees C), enabled by facile changes in boron coordination. These results are consistent with the OER activity of Co-OEC in B-i and P-i. The Pi binding kinetics are too slow to establish a pre-equilibrium sufficiently fast to influence the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), consistent with the zero-order dependence of P-i on the OER current density; in contrast, B-i exchange is sufficiently facile such that B-i has an inhibitory effect on OER. These complementary studies on Co-OEC and the dicobalt edge site mimic allow for a direct connection, at a molecular level, to be made between the mechanisms of heterogeneous and homogeneous OER.									135	2	0	0	30	0	135			0002-7863			WOS:000373518800043	26910289

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) can be used to create electrocatalysts meeting these criteria; however, the lack of high-quality electrode materials for the hydrogen evolution reaction impedes their adoption. In this study, a hollow-structured Co/Co3O4/C composite was prepared using a Co-based MOF precursor through a two-step pyrolysis-oxidation process. This composite outperformed nonhollow Co/Co3O4/C structures as well as hollow Co/C and Co3O4/C composites as a catalyst for hydrogen production in alkaline media. It had a low overvoltage of 169 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a moderate Tafel slope of 60.7 mV dec-(1). Moreover, it exhibited remarkable durability with 2000 cycles and 12 h of testing. This can be attributed to the synergistic effect of Co, Co3O4, and the hollow morphological architecture, which promote the dissociation of HO-H bonds, recombination of hydrogen intermediates, and efficient electron transfer. The results of this study are highly promising for the fabrication of cost-effective electrode materials for water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000861027900005

GCE/RGO-N-3 electrode was constructed with the electrochemical reduction of GO-N-3 coated on a glassy carbon electrode. Decoration of GCE/RGO-N-3 and GCE/GO-N-3 electrodes were performed with a new electrode modification technique, "click electrochemistry (CEC)", with which TA-CoPc complex was bonded to azido functional groups of GO-N-3 and RGO-N-3 on the electrodes. The modified GCE/RGO-N-3/TA-CoPc and GCE/GO-N-3/TA-CoPc electrodes were characterized with square wave voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and then tested as heterogeneous electrocatalysts for HER. GCE/RGO-N-3/TA-CoPc electrode illustrates well electrocatalytic activity by decreasing the over-potential of the bare electrode about 340 mV and increasing the current density of the electrode about 15 fold at low pHs with absolutely high stability and reproducibility.

The K adsorption at temperature above 450 K leads to consecutive (1 x 4), (1 x 3), and (1 x 2) missing-row reconstructions for coverage up to 0.12 ML, which revert back to (1 x 3) and (1 x 4) with increasing coverage up to 0.21 ML. The coadsorption of different oxygen amount at T > 450 K and eventually following reduction-reoxidation cycles led to a wealth of coadsorbate structures, all involving substrate missing-row-type reconstructions, some including segmentation of Rh rows along the [110] direction. The presence of K stabilizes the (1 x 2) missing-row reconstruction, which facilitates the formation of a great variety of very open (10 x 2)-type reconstructions at high oxygen coverage, not observed in the single adsorbate systems.

It was observed that under acidic conditions (HClO4) and at high water contents (80% (v/v)) the reaction is slow, but its rate increases as the water content decreases, reaching a maximum at approximately equimolar proportions (approximate to 25% H2O (v/v)). The results can be rationalized based on the structure of water in water-acetonitrile mixtures. At high water fractions, water is present in highly hydrogen-bonded arrangements and is less reactive. As the water content decreases, water clustering gives rise to the formation of water-rich micro-domains, and the number of bonded water molecules decreases monotonically. The results presented herein indicate that non-bonded water present in the water micro-domains is considerably more reactive towards oxygen production. Finally, long term electrolysis of water-acetonitrile mixtures containing [Ru-II(bpy)(3)](2+) and IrO2 NPs in solution show that the amount of oxygen produced is constant with time demonstrating that the redox mediator is stable under these experimental conditions.									30	0	0	0	1	0	30			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000349832600019	29163875

The present work reports the anchoring effects of initial V-O for further loading modifications and the reducing capacity of photoinduced V-O for pure water splitting. Herein, we propose Ni-loaded Cu-doped TiO2 (NCT) materials by successive doping and loading. The continuously added Ni ions should accumulate around the V(O)s and gradually grow into complete nickel oxide crystals, achieving a higher average valence state of the Ni species. NiO crystals can be detected on a 0.5% NCT sample, while the structure of Ni2O3 has been confirmed with a higher nickel mass ratio. Moreover, the introduction of nickel oxide effectively improves the photochemical and electrochemical performance by the interface charge separation, finally reaching an H-2 yield of 30.6 mu mol/g-cat on 0.5% NCT for V-O-based photo-thermal coupling reaction, which consists of V-O generation in photo and V-O consumption in thermal environment. In situ infrared spectroscopy further indicated that the presence of high valence state nickel oxide hindered the H-2 formation but effectively promoted the conventional oxidizing reaction, with an H-2 yield of 20.6 mmol/g-cat in a methanol-water reaction on the 2.0% NCT material. In summary, V-O controls the morphological structure of Ni loading and produces diverse effects for reactions with dissimilar mechanisms, which provides a novel way to design modifications for promoting various chemical reactions.

The high carrier density of Ni3N NCs combined with the faceted morphology is shown to render a broadband absorption in the infrared range attributed to the energy-dispersed localized surface plasmon excitation. The Ni3N NCs show an efficient electrocatalytic activity with impressively low overpotentials of similar to 74 and 142 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 190 and 270 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with current densities of 10 and 100 mA/cm(2), respectively. The Tafel slopes for HER and OER are 49 and 56 mV/dec, respectively, which are quite small. Furthermore, these Ni3N NCs require a small voltage of 1.48 V to produce a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) for overall water splitting conducted in an alkaline electrolyzer when they are used both as a cathode and an anode.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2574-0962			WOS:000636714000017

Herein, Cu/CuCN with heterointerfaces is the first synthesized case through a simple epitaxial-like growth method, displaying superior activity and stability under pH-universal media. Associated with high electron transport and transfer of the epitaxial interfacial area, the Cu/CuCN pre-catalyst is applied to deliver the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with lower overpotentials of 250 mV (forward scan) and 380 mV (backward scan) at 10 mA cm(-2) and demonstrates better intrinsic activity (jECSA of 1.0 mA cm(-2) at 420 mV) and impressive stability (136 h) in 1.0 M KOH, which exceeds most previous catalysts. Even using a nominal voltage of 1.5 V of a AA battery can drive the overall water-splitting setup. Experiments combined with theoretical simulations further uncover the existence of CuO species at the heterointerface during basic OER, which is evidence of better OER performance with abundant active sites that accelerate the conversion kinetics.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000659315800108	34019374	
J	Danjuan Liu; Wei He								Study on Oxygen Reduction Method of Phosphorus-doped Hydrogenated Nano-silicon								Journal of Physics: Conference Series				1885				022063 (6 pp.)	022063 (6 pp.)		10.1088/1742-6596/1885/2/022063				2021	2021	In recent years, hydrogenated nano-silicon has attracted much attention due to its high specific energy density. However, the slow kinetic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (ORE) reduce the efficiency of hydrogenation of nano-silicon and hinder its practical application. The development of non-precious catalysts with excellent performance and low price is of great significance to the development of hydrogenated nano-silicon. Among many hydrogenation nano-silicon catalysts, cobalt-based compounds have good ORR and ORE catalytic performance, and are rich in Co reserves and low in price. Especially doped compounds have excellent stability. In the thesis, three series of hydrogenated nano-silicon composite materials of Co-SrCO3/NC, Co-Nd/NC and Co-Ce/NC were successfully synthesized through heating reflow method and subsequent high-temperature calcination. XRD, Raman, XPS, TEM, nitrogen isothermal adsorption and desorption and other analytical methods were used to characterize the structure of the above composite materials. Through chemical tests, the composite materials were evaluated for the catalytic performance of ORR and ERR, and their structure-activity relationship was analyzed. The Co_SrC03/NC series composite materials were calcined at different temperatures. The results showed that the generated SrCO3 nanorods were embedded in the graphite shell and contacted with hydrogenated nano-silicon. In an oxygen-saturated 0.1MKOH solution, Co-SrCO3/NC series composites have excellent ORR/ORE catalytic activity, especially Co-SrCO3/NC-600 has more stable activity than precious metal catalysts of 20wt% Pt/C and Ir02. Sex. The air prepared with Co-SrCO3/NC-600 has better performance. During the in-depth study of 10mA_cnT2, Co-SrC03/NC-600 was used as the air to maintain a stable platform of 1.10V, and the platform of 20wt%Pt/C under the same conditions was 1.17V.					2021 7th International Conference on Manufacturing Technology and Applied Materials (ICAMMT 2021)2021 7th International Conference on Manufacturing Technology and Applied Materials (ICAMMT 2021)	12-14 March 202112-14 March 2021		Sanya, ChinaSanya, China	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1742-6596			INSPEC:20846638

Reasonable engineering of heterointerfaces can effectively create more active sites and promote electron transfer resulting in improvement in the catalytic activity. In this work, we synthesize the well-defined molybdenum carbides and tungsten carbides nano-heterostructure (Mo2C/W2C) by carbonization with CH4/H-2 at 800 degrees C showing excellent HER activity, fast kinetics and electrochemical stability in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes. Mo2C/W2C requires only 140 and 132 mV over-potentials to reach catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH electrolyte, respectively. Tafel slope is as low as 51 and 76 mV dec(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH comparable to the benchmarked Pt/C. Moreover, Mo2C/W2C exhibits a superior stability with slight deterioration in HER performance after 5000 potential cycles. This work elucidates that the rational construction of heterointerfaces is favorable for design of efficient non-noble metal electrocatalyst for HER catalysis.

However, the low ratio of electrolyteaccessible active sites suppresses the OER performance of pure CoSe2. Engineering CoSe2 into a two-dimensional ultrathin nanomesh structure with abundant seleniumvacancies is expected to increase its number of active sites and hence improve the OER activity, but, its synthesis is highly challenging. In this work, CoSe2 ultrathin nanomeshes with abundant selenium vacancies (CoSe2 UNMvac) were prepared through plasma treatment on CoSe2-diethylenetriamine (DETA) layered hybrids. The as-obtained CoSe2 UNMvac exhibited an excellent OER performance with a low overpotential of 284 mV at 10 mAcm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 46.3mV dec(-1), good stability over 20 h and a large mass activity of 789.1 A g(-1) at an overpotential of 300 mV. The greatly enhanced OER activity could be ascribed to the large number of highly active sites on the surface, which are exposed to the electrolyte.									67	4	0	0	2	0	68			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000457893400010

As a result, considerable efforts have been made to activate the MoS2 basal plane for improving the HER activity. Herein, we first employed laser ablation in liquid to create plentiful sulfur (S)-vacancies in the basal plane of 2H-MoS2 nanosheets under ambient conditions. The experimental measurements and theoretical calculations prove that S vacancies in the basal plane can serve as the additional active sites and optimize the free energy change for hydrogen adsorption (Delta G(H center dot)) at the same time. As a result, in comparison with pristine MoS2 (P-MoS2), laser treated MoS2 (L-MoS2) realizes a significant improvement in the HER activity. Our work represents a facile method to enhance the catalytic performance of 2H-MoS2 nanosheets and may help to guide the synthesis of other efficient two-dimensional metal chalcogenide catalysts.									36	2	0	0	2	0	37			2168-0485			WOS:000463462100059

Benefiting from the porous NF substrate, large catalytic activity area, numerous lattice defects generated in selenization process as well as superwetting and superaerophobic properties of electrode surfaces, the obtained self-supported hybrids, especially the NiMoSe@Ni0.33Mo0.67O4 electrode presented excellent hydrogen generation performance that merely requires small overpotentials of 82.1 mV and 120.3 mV at a low and high current density of 10 mA center dot cm-2 and 50 mA center dot cm-2 in alkaline electrolyte, respectively, which is also competitive with other transition metal selenides reported literatures. Besides, the low Tafel slope of 35.23 mV center dot dec-1 and long term stability for 20 h suggesting the fast hydrogen evolution reaction kinetics and outstanding durability of electrode.

Amorphization and heterointerface engineering have played significant roles in the rational design of electrocatalysts and modulation of their electrocatalytic activities. However, the synergistic effect between amorphization and heterointerfaces has been scarcely reported. As a proof-of-concept attempt, we develop amorphous FeMo (a-FeMo) electrocatalysts with an abundance of heterointerfaces that are composed of amorphous components and evaluate their electrocatalytic performances toward the nitrogen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Benefitting from the synergistic effect between the amorphous nature of the a-FeMo electrocatalysts, which offer a high density of active sites, and significant electron redistribution at the heterointerfaces, the electrocatalysts exhibit a high Faradaic efficiency of 29.15%, an elevated yield rate of 71.78 mu g(NH3) mg(cat).

The existence of ZIF-67 and Mo ensure the even distribution of Co and Mo elements and the formation of N doped carbon layer in Mo, Co-NiS/NF. Mo, Co co-doping and NF support greatly improved the electrocatalytic performance of NiS bulks, because metal element doping could improve the intrinsic activity and electrical conductivity. Moreover, the Ni foam could act as a substrate to avoid aggregation and provide nickel source to form the bimetallic sulfide. The product Mo,Co-NiS/NF-400 showed outstanding electrochemical properties, with ultralow overpotential (92 mV vs. RHE) for HER and ultralow overpotential (117.2 mV vs. RHE) for OER to achieve 10 mA cm(-2), as well as the ultralow cell voltage (1.36 V) to achieve 20 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting.

A common development strategy for OER catalysts is to search for facile routes for the synthesis of new catalytic materials with optimized chemical compositions and structures. Here, nickel hydroxide Ni(OH)(2) 2D nanosheets pillared with 0D polyoxovanadate (POV) nanoclusters as an OER catalyst that can operate in alkaline media are reported. The intercalation of POV nanoclusters into Ni(OH)(2) induces the formation of a nanoporous layer-by-layer stacking architecture of 2D Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets and 0D POV with a tunable chemical composition.

Herein, a facile strategy is utilized by pyrolyzing the mixture containing ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate and zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 to achieve a product with Co nanoparticles as core and beta-Mo2C embedded in N-doped carbon as a shell (Co@ beta-Mo2C-NC). The Co@ beta-Mo2C-NC-0.115 (quantity of Mo precursor) composite illustrates an overpotential (eta(10)) of 188 and 330 mV for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively, and a cell voltage of 1.72 V is required for overall water splitting to attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media. Remarkably, the Co@ beta-Mo2C-NC-0.115 catalyst exhibits excellent stability for continuous operation of 15 h chronopotentiometry and 25 h chronoamperometry measurements. The satisfactory electrocatalytic performance can be ascribed to the unique core-shell nanostructure, especially the synergistic effect between Co, beta-Mo2C and N-doped carbon. These research findings speculate a straightforward strategy to fabricate MOF derived heterostructures with robust catalytic performance and wide applications in electrocatalysis.

It has recently been shown that it is possible to stabilize octahedral Pt-Ni nanoparticles by doping them with a small amount of Mo. Using ab initio calculations and a quaternary cluster expansion, we provide atomic-scale explanations for the enhanced stability of Mo-doped Pt-Ni nanoparticles. We predict that for Mo-doped Pt3Ni nanoparticles with only a small amount of Mo doping (around 1.6% mole fraction) the equilibrium concentration of Ni atoms on the particle surface is greatly reduced, limiting the rate at which Ni atoms dissolve from the particles. Mo doping also increases Pt/Ni vacancy formation energies hi the surface layer, which further stabilizes the nanoparticles against Ni dissolution and helps preserve the nanoparticle shape. Our calculations also reveal insights into the shape evolution of Pt-Ni nanoparticles: the preferential oxidation of edges can make (111) face sites more vulnerable to dissolution than edge sites, which may contribute to the observed formation of Pt-Ni nanoframes and nanoparticles with concave surfaces.									55	1	0	0	3	0	56			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000389963200064	27797520

In this work, rhodium phosphide nanoparticles are attached on a nitrogen/phosphorus-doped carbon cloth matrix (Rh2P-N/P-CC) with an ultralow Rh loading of 39.2 mu g cm(-2) to be used as an excellent bifunctional electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By rationally integrating the merits of its two components, as-reported Rh2P-N/P-CC exhibits impressive HER catalytic performance, outperforming benchmark Pt/C catalysts at only 7.85% equivalent of Pt; meanwhile, Rh2P-N/P-CC largely surpasses the RuO2 catalyst during OER catalysis in alkaline media. As a bifunctional electrocatalyst, Rh2P-N/P-CC catalyzes stable electrochemical water splitting of 200 mA cm(-1) under 1.7 V. This work reports a feasible strategy to integrate three-dimensional electrodes for high performance water electrolysis.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2574-0970		WOS:000644473900010

One of the crucial challenges for industrial applications of water electrolysis is the manufacture of electrocatalysts which can reduce the kinetic energy barrier of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Loading transition metal (TM) nanoparticles (NPs) or single atoms (SAs) into heteroatom-doped carbon materials (HCMs) is an effective method to improve electrochemical activity and stability. To this end, we synthesized N-doped porous carbon (NC) encapsulated Co NPs and isolated Co SA nanocatalysts (denoted as Co NPs@SAs-NC) using metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as sacrificial precursors. The Co NPs@SAs-NC nanocatalysts displayed outstanding HER activity with a 110 mV overpotential in 1 M KOH, 47 mV overpotential in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 171 mV in 0.5 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to reach a current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2). In addition, the mechanism of the synergistic effect of Co NPs, Co SAs and N species was investigated in-depth using in situ shielding experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000803799000009

Therefore, the direct implementation of hydrogen electroreduction in an alkaline environment with stable, high electrochemical rate, and cost-effective catalysts are among critical research areas and must be further developed to address the energy crisis. Herein, we have presented a high-performance Bismuth-Copper electrocatalyst through an easy in-situ reaction between Bismuth (Bi) and Copper (Cu). The SEM images showed ultra-tiny needle-like Bi growth on Cu foam. The porous structure of the Bi-Cu configuration possesses a high surface area which has accelerated mass and charge transport phenomena. It resulted in a large surface area and high electrochemical reduction of water at a current density of 1000 mA cm(-2) at low overpotential and small onset potential. We propose that the unique porous morphology and specific surface morphology of the Bi/Cu foam catalyst are beneficial to the in situ generation of Hydrogen intermediates, which might play a significant role in enhancing the H-2 electrocatalysis performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0366-6352	2585-7290		WOS:000864580800003

Herein, an efficient P-doped molybdenum disulfide/nickel subsulfide (abbreviated as P-MoS2/Ni3S2/NF hereafter) catalyst was rationally prepared through a facile one-step hydrothermal process. The heterogeneous structure formed by the combination of MoS2 and Ni3S2 can improve the electrolytic performance of water in an alkaline medium. The addition of a P source in the reaction reduces the agglomeration of the catalyst, and the electronic structure of MoS2/Ni3S2 is simultaneously optimized by the doped P atoms in MoS2, thus promoting conductivity and increasing the valence state of the Ni species. Low overpotentials of only 136 mV and 95 mV are required to generate 10 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. Most significantly, when P-MoS2/Ni3S2/NF is used as the cathode and anode for the electrolysis of water, a voltage of 1.48 V is required to produce 10 mA cm(-2). This work provides feasible ideas for the rational construction of bifunctional catalysts with outstanding performance, which may offer a reference for designing non-precious electrocatalysts for water splitting.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1466-8033		WOS:000797092200001

The synthesized CoSe2/SDGC composites were characterized to have mesoporous structure distributed on the carbon matrix covered with the sphere like aggregates of CoSe2. Their electrocatalytic performances were evaluated by hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 0.5 M H2SO4. The results have shown that the as-prepared catalysts exhibited highly improved electrocatalytic activities for HER compared with the pristine CoSe2 and SDGC. Especially, the composite CoSe2/SDGC-60 with the optimized ratio of CoSe2 to SDGC has exhibited the highest electrocatalytic activity. The catalyst has obtained the lowest overpotential and Tafel slope of 203 mV (at 10 mA/cm(2)) and 58 mV/dec, respectively. It also showed impressive durability against 0.5 M H2SO4 and the electrocatalytic activity hardly decreased even after 5000 cycles. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The neutron diffraction experiments were performed twice, using two different wavelengths (lambda = 1.2921(2) and 4.74 angstrom) in order to better discriminate structural and magnetic changes as functions of the charge transfer. From the neutron diffraction experiments, two intermediate phases, SrCoO2.75 and SrCoO2.82 +/- 0.07, were characterized. No superstructure reflections were observed for the corresponding SrCoO2.75 phase. Instead we observed here, for the first time, 3D oxygen ordering during an oxygen intercalation reaction, as established for SrCoO2.82 +/- 0.07, which can be described as a tetragonal unit cell, related to the perovskite cell by a approximate to 2(a root 2) and c approximate to 2a. The structure of this intermediate phase confirms the strongly topotactic character of the oxygen intercalation reaction. We were also able to prove, from in situ XAFS spectroscopy at the Co absorption edge, that the evolution of the Co valence state from formally +3 for SrCoO2.5 to +4 for the final reaction product (SrCoO3.0) does not proceed continuously but gives evidence for the formation of O- species for stoichiometries corresponding to SrCoO2.82 +/- 0.07. The use of neutrons (vs X-rays) in the diffraction experiments and the choice of the transmission (vs fluorescence) mode in the XAFS experiment guarantee that the obtained data well represent bulk and not just surface properties.									148	1	1	0	7	0	149			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000241030500033	17017796

Room-temperature synthesis of cost-effective Cu electrodes to replace precious catalysts remains a great challenge. Herein, CuO with Ni modulation (Ni-CuO) nanosheet arrays were obtained at room-temperature via a feasible two-step strategy, with the chloride counterpart as the precatalyst. HCI plays a key role in the preparation, which facilitates Cu precipitation and corrodes the nickel foam surface to supply a Ni element. Theoretical simulations reveal that Ni modulation can activate the CuO substrate, with Cu rather than Ni as the active site, ascribed to the induced, more delocalized electrons, higher carrier concentration, and increased d-band center. In the alkaline electrolyte, Ni-CuO exhibits a low overpotential of 367 mV to achieve a current density of 200 mA cm(-2) toward oxygen generation. Moreover, subsequent room-temperature sulfurization leads to the formation of Ni-CuO-S, which requires a 54 mV overpotential to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen production. Benefiting from the nanosheet array structure, these two room-temperature obtained electrodes are assembled into an all Cu-based water splitting electrolyzer, which exhibited 10 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.55 V with a Faraday efficiency of similar to 100%, and a sustainable stability of more than 30 h, suggesting Cu-based electrodes via the room-temperature preparation strategy have the potential for energy conversion and storage applications.									11	0	0	0	0	0	10			2574-0970			WOS:000488423900073

Enhanced energy density and cycling stability are key in the optimization of functional cathode materials such as P2-type layered transition metal oxides. High operating voltage can be achieved by enabling anionic reactions, but irreversibility of O2-/O-2(n-)/O-2 evolution still limits this chance, leading to extra capacity at first cycle that is not fully recovered. Here, we dissect this intriguing oxygen redox activity in Mn-deficient NaxNi0.25Mn0.68O2 from first-principles, by analyzing the formation of oxygen vacancies and dioxygen complexes at different stages of sodiation. We identify low-energy intermediates that release molecular O-2 at high voltage, and we show how to improve the overall cathode stability by partial substitution of Ni with Fe. These new atomistic insights on O-2 formation mechanism set solid scientific foundations for inhibition and control of this process toward the rational design of new anionic redox-active cathode materials.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2380-8195			WOS:000672746800014

The rate of the decay of the 560-nm absorption appears to be independent of the oxygen concentration even under conditions where reaction 1 becomes rate-limiting, which indicates that a pathway for the removal of RS./RSOO. must exist in addition to reactions 1, 2, 3, and 7. This may be a tautomerism involving the thiyl radical which in the presence of oxygen already at relatively small concentrations (the effect starting to overwhelm the equilibrium 22/23 near 5 x 10(-5) mol dm(-3) O-2) leads to an irreversible bleeding-off of thiyl radicals. At higher oxygen concentrations, the rate of RS. (HOCH2CH2S.) removal on account of steps 22 and 26 remains small compared to that of step 1 followed by 3 and 7. It is hypothesized that the species HOCH2CH(OO.)HSH through elimination of HO2. forms the thiocarbonyl compound HOCH2CH=S which upon thiophilic addition of thiolate gives rise to the disulfide, a product which is not specific to the route through reactions 22 and 26 because it is also formed as a consequence of reaction 3 from sulfenic acid and thiolate: reaction 1/2, RS. + O-2 reversible arrow RSOO.; reaction 3, RSOO. + RSH --> RSO. + RSOH; reaction 7, RSOO. --> RS(O)O.; reaction 22/23, RS. reversible arrow HO-CH2-CH-SH; and reaction 26, HO-CH2-CH-SH + O-2 --> HO-CH2-CH(OO.)-SH. The room temperature rate constants of these reactions have been determined: k(1) = 2.2 +/- 0.1 x 10(9) dm(3) mol(-1) s(-1), k(2) = 6.2 +/- 0.3 x 10(5) s(-1), k(3) = 2 x 10(6) dm(3) mol(-1) s(-1), k(7) = 2 x 10(3) s(-1), k(22) approximate to 10(3) s(-1), and k(23) approximate to 3 x 10(4) s(-1). In this system, it has been possible to determine the stability constant K-1/2 = [RSOO.]/([RS.][O-2]) also from the dependence of the maximal absorbance at 560 nm on the oxygen concentration. The value thus obtained is 3.3 X 10(3) mol(-1) dm(3), in good agreement with the value determined from the kinetics, k(1)/k(2) = 3.5 +/- 0.4 X 10(3) mol(-1) dm(3).									99	0	0	0	38	0	99			0022-3654			WOS:A1994NU80000020

The obtained results were compared to a non-catalysed Watts nickel reference sample and the electrochemical measurements confirmed that the coating decreased the OER overpotential by 70 mV. XRD furthermore revealed that a LaNiO3 + Ni composite structure was obtained. Conventional alkaline water electrolysis was carried out at a temperature of 120 degrees C and a current densities of 0.2 and 0.8 A cm(-2).

With a view to taking advantage of these properties, we subjected the Agrocybe aegerita UPO1-encoding gene to directed evolution in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To promote functional expression, several different signal peptides were fused to the mature protein, and the resulting products were tested. Over 9,000 clones were screened using an ad hoc dual-colorimetric assay that assessed both peroxidative and oxygen transfer activities. After 5 generations of directed evolution combined with hybrid approaches, 9 mutations were introduced that resulted in a 3,250-fold total activity improvement with no alteration in protein stability. A breakdown between secretion and catalytic activity was performed by replacing the native signal peptide of the original parental type with that of the evolved mutant; the evolved leader increased functional expression 27-fold, whereas an 18-fold improvement in the k(cat)/K-m value for oxygen transfer activity was obtained. The evolved UPO1 was active and highly stable in the presence of organic cosolvents. Mutations in the hydrophobic core of the signal peptide contributed to enhance functional expression up to 8 mg/liter, while catalytic efficiencies for peroxidative and oxygen transfer reactions were increased by several mutations in the vicinity of the heme access channel. Overall, the directed-evolution platform described is a valuable point of departure for the development of customized UPOs with improved features and for the study of structure-function relationships.									108	1	0	0	53	0	113			0099-2240	1098-5336		WOS:000336035200025	24682297

However, the practical application of Ir-based catalysts is significantly limited owing to their high cost in addition to the scarcity of the metal. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the efficiency of the utilization of such catalysts. In this study, IrO2-coated Ti felt (IrO2/Ti) electrodes were prepared as high-efficiency catalysts for the OER under acidic conditions. By controlling the surface roughness of the Ti substrate via wet etching, the optimum Ti substrate surface area for application in the IrO2/Ti electrode was determined. Additionally, the IrO2 film that was electrodeposited on the 30 min etched Ti felt had a large surface area and a uniform morphology. Furthermore, there were no micro-cracks and the electrode obtained (IrO2/Ti-30) exhibited superior catalytic performance with respect to the OER, with a mass activity of 362.3 A gIr-1 at a potential of 2.0 V (vs. RHE) despite the low Ir loading (0.2 mg cm(-2)). Therefore, this proposed strategy for the development of IrO2/Ti electrodes with substrate surface control via wet etching has potential for application in the improvement of the efficiency of catalyst utilization with respect to the OER.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2296-2646			WOS:000585939800001	33195098	
J	Gugtapeh, Hamed Shooshtari; Rezaei, Milad								Preparation of a superhydrophilic and amorphous Ni-Sb-P nanostructure: A highly performance and durable bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting								JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS				927						167035	10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.167035				DEC 15 2022	2022	The quest for highly active and durable catalysts to simultaneously accelerate hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is inevitable for the universal exploitation of electrochemical water splitting to store renewable energy. Herein, a facile and versatile procedure for preparing super -hydrophilic and amorphous Ni-Sb-P nanostructure on graphite is developed. The newly designed nanos-tructure provides distinctive advantages, such as more active sites, strong electronic interaction, and the ability to maintain microstructure, which endow the resulting bifunctional Ni-Sb-P/graphite catalyst with extraordinary HER and OER properties in alkaline media. The as-fabricated electrode needs only low overpotentials of 77 and 348 mV at 10 mA.cm-2 toward HER and OER, respectively. It sustains at least 80 h working at 100 mA.cm-2 with degradation of less than 5%. Noteworthy, the strong interaction of P atoms with Ni and Sb on the graphite not only makes an amorphous structure to expose abundant active sites but also dramatically enhances the electronic structure of the catalyst to simplify charge transfer.

In this study, flexible polyacrylonitrile-based carbon fiber mat with nitrogen doping and oxygen-containing functional group carbon structure was selected as the flexible substrate, and binder-free flexible Sb2Se3/polyacrylonitrile-based carbon fiber mat composite electrode was successfully prepared within 120 s using microwave synthesis. The electrode not only has a capacitance of 478.0C g(-1) and retains 97.4% of the initial capacitance after 50,000 charge-discharge tests but also exhibits good HER activity of low overpotential (152 mV) and Tafel slope (78.4 mV/dec) in alkaline electrolyte. The performance of the assembled flexible asymmetric supercapacitor is almost unaffected by bending up to 180?degrees. The device has an energy density of 21.3 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 800.0 W kg(-1), indicating that the electrode has good prospects for portable energy storage applications.

This bind-free three-dimensional (3D) architecture possesses the huge specific surface area and facilitates ion transport and charge transfer, leading to a superior performance in water splitting as a bifunctional catalyst for both H-2 and O-2 evolution reaction (HER and OER). The as-prepared NiCo diselenide/CC composites show a high HER capability in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution with a Tafel slope as small as 31.6 mV.dec(1) . They offer a HER current of 10 mA.cm(2) at a low overpotential of 108 mV. Their OER efficiency is also remarkable in 1 M KOH solution with a small Tafel slope of 42.3 mV.dec(1) and a low overpotential of 258 mV at 10 mA.cm(2).

A series of heterogeneous electrocatalysts based on graphene coupled mixed-metal (oxy)hydroxides containing specific concentrations of nickel, cobalt, and iron were synthesized to investigate the influence of metal composition on the structure, properties, and activities for OER. The addition of iron led to isolated metal (oxy)hydroxide sheets from a few hundred nanometers to less than 5 nm, leading to a high surface area. The increased d-spacing between layers of hydroxide and abundant hydroxyl groups adsorbed on the surface of the electrocatalysts contribute to better catalytic performance as displayed by the remarkable improvement in Tafel slopes. In addition, the presence of cobalt and nickel can aid in lowering the onset potential of OER. Small amounts of iron in NiFe and NiCoFe systems were found to significantly decrease the overpotential. The best OER electrocatalysts of the series were obtained for the ternary metal hydroxide of composition Ni0.33Co0.34Fe0.33, which generates a low overpotential of 0.332 V in reaching 10 mA cm(-1) in 0.1 M KOH and the Tafel slope is as low as 51 mV dec(-1). Density functional theory calculations demonstrate the improvements of electronic structure and free energy changes of the ternary metal oxyhydroxide for more efficient OER electrocatalysis. Overall, this work provides a solid foundation for further development of high-efficiency, scalable, and cost-effective mixed-metal (oxy)hydroxide electrocatalysts. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The current study reports on the oxidation kinetics of PVD grown Cu thin films (20-150 nm thick) and the oxide phase evolution from Cu2O to CuO upon thermal oxidation in the temperature range of 100-450 degrees C. XRD investigations in the laboratory and at the synchrotron show that the oxide phase formation critically depends on the oxidation conditions such as temperature and oxygen partial pressure. The real-time synchrotron XRD measurements reveal that the formation of the CuO phase only starts after complete oxidation of the Cu films to Cu2O films. In situ resistance measurements were performed to follow the oxide growth rate of Cu2O on Cu films in the temperature range of 100-300 degrees C in air and in 10 mbar pO(2). It is found that the oxidation kinetics of Cu films to Cu2O films follows the linear rate law, which is attributed to surface reaction controlled oxidation. The oxygen dissociation rate at the gas-solid interface is the rate-limiting process. A dramatic decrease in the linear oxidation rate is observed at low oxygen partial pressures. The fundamental differences between the oxidation rate-limiting processes of Cu as compared to other transition metal films are discussed.

In the present work, the ceria-modified iron oxide is investigated as an oxygen carrier for hydrogen production via chemical-looping water splitting process (CLWS). To identify the role of CeO2, the performance evolution and element migration of the mixed oxides during redox cycling were discussed in detail. Comparing the obvious deactivation of pure iron oxide sample, ceria-modified iron oxide shows relative constant production of hydrogen during the successive recycling water splitting. FeCe20 sample with a CeO2 mole percent of 20% shows the highest average yield of hydrogen (8651 mu mol/g) with a Fe average oxygen recovery rate of 67.7% among Fe-Ce mixed oxides with different Ce molar percentage (x = 0, 10, 20 and 40%). In spite of materials sintering, the oxygen releasing/acquiring capacity and reactivity of Fe-Ce mixed oxides are three times higher than that of pure iron oxide after redox treatment. This can be ascribed to the preferable dispersion of Ce-based sub-micro particles (CeO2 and CeFeO3) and enhanced Fe-Ce interactions generated from active sites at the contact interface between iron oxides (mainly Fe3O4 particles) and Ce-based sub-micro particles (CeO2 and CeFeO3) after cycling.

Among all the samples, SrTi0.1CoxFe0.9-xO3-delta (donated as STCF-154) shows wonderful OER activity with an overpotential of 0.37 V, a current density of 33.65 mA cm(-2) at 1.71 V, and a Tafel slope of 94.82 mV dec(-1). Besides, the potential of STCF-154 remained nearly unchanged for at least 8 h at a fixed current density of 10 mA cm(disk)(-2) on GC electrode. The improved activity and stability are likely originating from the highly oxidative oxygen species O-2(2-)/O- formed in STCf-154, which can easily migrate from bulk STCF-154 and "spillover" to the surface of the catalyst during OER process. The Fe doping in Co-based perovskites had synergetically enhanced activity and can be considered as a good candidate for the OER in alkaline solution. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Amorphous manganese oxide catalysts were prepared via photochemical metal-organic deposition (PMOD). Through XRD, SEM-EDS, Raman spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, HRTEM-EDS, and XPS, we confirmed that amorphous manganese oxide catalysts were successfully prepared. Amorphous catalysts prepared with different photolysis times were compared in terms of their performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and catalyst MnOx-PMOD48 showed the best performance because of its high Mn3+ proportion and electrochemically active surface area. MnOx-PMOD48 showed better ORR/OER performance than the crystalline MnOx and MnOx/Ti4O7 catalysts from our previous work. Following our previous work on crystalline manganese oxide catalysts, we added Ti4O7 during the PMOD process with 48 h of treatment and obtained the amorphous catalyst MnOx/Ti4O7-PMOD. MnOx/Ti4O7-PMOD was supported by Ti4O7 particles, which led to improved stability. The ORR/OER catalytic activity of MnOx/Ti4O7-PMOD was better than that of crystalline catalyst MnOx/Ti4O7-300, which was the best crystalline catalyst in our previous work. We also compared lithium-oxygen batteries assembled with MnOx/Ti4O7-PMOD and MnOx/Ti4O7-300. The battery performance tests confirmed that the amorphous manganese catalyst had better ORR/OER bifunctional catalytic performance than the crystalline manganese catalyst because of its high defect state with more abundant edge active sites and more surface-exposed catalytic active sites.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2046-2069		WOS:000743595400001	35425262

Herein, we report the preparation of a single-crystalline NiS2 nanostructure film of similar to 50 nm thickness grown directly on a carbon fiber cloth (NiS2/CFC) by a facile vapor-phase hydrothermal (VPH) method. NiS2/CFC as an electrocatalyst exhibits activity for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. Furthermore, a series of alcohols (2-propanol, 2-butanol, 2-pentanol, and cyclohexanol) were electrocatalytically converted to the corresponding ketones with high selectivity, efficiency, and durability using the NiS2/CFC electrode in alkaline media. In the presence of 0.45 M alcohol, a remarkably decreased overpotential (similar to 150 mV, vs. RHE) at the NiS2/CFC anode compared with that for water oxidation to generate O-2, i.e., the OER, in alkaline media leads to significantly improved H-2 generation. For instance, the H-2 generation rate in the presence of 0.45 M 2-propanol is almost 1.2-times of that obtained for pure water splitting, but in a system that employs an applied voltage at least 280 mV lower than that required for water splitting to achieve the same current density (20 mA.cm(-2)). Thus, our results demonstrate the applicability of our bifunctional non-precious-metal electrocatalyst for organic synthesis and simultaneous H-2 production.									41	2	0	0	0	0	42			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000419959500038

Herein, we present a metal-organic framework-derived route for the synthesis of N-doped carbon encapsulated CoxFe1-xP nanoparticles (CoxFe1-xP/NC), which show remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. The optimized Co0.17Fe0.79P/NC shows low over-potentials at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (139 and 299 mV) and small Tafel slopes (57 and 44 mV dec(-1)) for HER and OER, respectively. The water electrolyzer using Co0.17Fe0.79P/NC as both anode and cathode reaches the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.66 V, and exhibits excellent long-term stability for 35 h. These excellent catalytic performances are mainly ascribed to the facile NC scaffold and slight Co incorporation, which provide large surface contact area between catalyst and electrolyte, fast charge and mass transport pathways, and abundant and stable active sites.									38	0	0	0	0	0	38			2574-0962			WOS:000465644600048

Herein, we developed an N-coordination strategy to design Fe-N-5 sites distributed on N-doped porous nanofibers (Fe SA/PNCNFs-0.1) as an efficient HER catalyst by the wet impregnation method. The results show that Fe species exist in the form of dispersed single atoms. The binding between the Fe atom and N atom is strong, forming the coordination structure of Fe-N-5. In the acidic HER, Fe SA/PNCNFs-0.1 improves the catalytic performance toward the HER with a small overpotential of 44.3 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) current density and a low Tafel slope of 45.4 mV dec(-1), which are superior to those of Fe single atoms with less Fe contents (Fe SA/PNCNFs-0.4) and Fe nanoparticles (Fe NP/PNCNFs). Fe SA/PNCNFs-0.1 also has excellent HER activity and durability in alkaline media, highlighting the potential application of Fe single atoms for hydrogen production.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-0485			WOS:000861736000001

In this strategy, cubic NaCl particles play a critical template role in not only directing the formation of a 3D porous scaffold-like architecture but also creating a 2D-finite space to obtain Mo2C/C nanosheet hybrids. More importantly, the presence of NaCl will increase the content of amorphous carbon residue, reducing the charge transfer resistance. As a result, in this unique structure, the 3D porous scaffold can effectively avoid aggregation and expose more active sites, facilitating mass transportation, while the sheet-like Mo2C/C hybrids can achieve a relatively high density of catalytic sites with excellent charge transfer ability. Moreover, the effects of the mass ratio on the HER activity were also investigated. And the final optimized Mo2C/C electrocatalyst manifests an outstanding HER performance in both acidic and alkaline media with small Tafel slopes of 56 and 48 mV dec(-1), respectively.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			2168-0485			WOS:000449577200043

The NiS/MoS2 complex grown in situ on carbon paper (NiS/MoS2/CP) by a one-step hydrothermal method was successfully constructed as an effi-cient electrocatalyst. The synergetic effects of the superhydrophilic/aerophobic surface, hierarchical na-nostructure and strong mechanical adhesion to a highly conductive substrate give the NiS/MoS2/CP complex outstanding catalytic activity and durability. Specifically, it exhibits relatively low overpotentials of 119 mV (at a current density of 10 mA cm-2) and 314 mV (at a current density of 100 mA cm-2) for the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively.

However, exploiting this increased reactivity to anchor and tune the electronic states of single atom catalysts (SACs) remains elusive. To investigate this, a method to anchor Pt SACs with ultra-low mass loadings at the edges of edge-rich vertically aligned graphene (as low as 0.71 mu g Pt cm(-2)) is developed. Angle-dependent X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density-functional theory calculations reveal that edge-anchored Pt SACs has a robust coupling with the pi-electrons of graphene. This interaction results in a higher occupancy of the Pt 5d orbital, shifting the d-band center toward the Fermi level, improving the adsorption of *H for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Pt primarily coordinated to the graphene edge shows improved alkaline HER performance compared to Pt coordinated in mixed environments (turnover frequencies of 22.6 and 10.9 s(-1) at an overpotential of 150 mV, respectively). This work demonstrates an effective route to engineering the coordination environment of Pt SACs by using the graphene edge for enhanced energy conversion reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000822536100001

As a typical TMP, CoP-based materials are widely adopted as electrocatalysts in electrochemical water splitting owing to their unique physical properties, such as a P-rich component and superior charge transferability. Very recently, the research efforts focus on using various effective strategies to further enhance the electrocatalytic performance of CoP-based catalysts. However, no guideline for systematically improving their electrocatalytic activity exists currently. Hence, this review summarizes recent advances in optimizing the electrocatalytic performance of CoP-based materials from four aspects, namely, morphology design, construction of heterointerface, defect engineering, and atomic doping. Finally, this study briefly proposes the existing challenges and the future working directions for designing advanced CoP-based electrocatalysts and other non-previous metal electrocatalysts.

Herein, we investigate commercial tungsten carbide (WC), a potential substitute for Pt, as a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst in PEMWE. We adopted two sizes of WC, 400 nm and 1 mu m, optimized the electrode fabrication method and running conditions. The results show that the smaller WC does not provide stable performance and operating at high current density and low temperature is more competitive with Ptbased electrolysis. In addition, the most serious drawback is the increased cell voltage on restart after long-term power-off due to considerable WC oxidation, which leads to a decrease in the catalytic carbide carbon. Luckily, this can be offset by effective O-2 isolation in the cathode, such as H2O sealing or pumping with H-2. WC is an economic alternative as a HER electrocatalyst in PEMWE with optimized conditions and an O-2 isolation strategy during an interrupted operation. We provide a practical method to reduce the cost of the HER electrocatalyst.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1452-3981			WOS:000532357500027

Here, leaf-like cobalt-embedded nitrogen-doped porous carbon sheet (Co-NC) for the HER is obtained by simple pyrolysis of a two-dimensional metal organic framework. The Co-NC annealed at 800 degrees C exhibits large surface area and the active metallic cobalt species embedded in the N-doped carbon layers, which leads to the lower overpotential, higher current density, and superior durability in alkaline media. However, the Co-NC annealed at 600 degrees C shows abundant nitrogen-coordinated cobalt species, which favors the high HER activity under acidic condition. These structural properties of the Co-NC enable the efficient HER activity by increasing the active sites and enhancing mass transfer of water molecules or protons at the interface where the reaction takes place.

NP mean diameter could be varied in the range of 20-80 nm by playing with the applied current density (-j = 0.5-2 mA cm(-2)) and deposition times (t = 200-3200 s). NPs were very well adhered to the substrate and became progressively enriched in Fe as the absolute value of the current density increased. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses revealed that the NPs are mostly metallic. The oxygen signal detected at surface level is relatively high but reduces down to less than 1 at% after 1 min Ar ions sputtering. The as-deposited Rh-Fe NPs are active toward hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline medium. Different values of the onset potential for water reduction have been observed depending on the j and t values applied for NPs growth. Cycling stability tests reveal that NPs do not suffer from excessive deterioration of their electrocatalytic activity with time. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In spite of this, application of Ti3C2Tx as co-catalyst in photo-catalysis is rarely explored, probably because of its metallic nature and hydrophilic surface. Given that Ti3C2Tx with different surface terminations exhibits large differences in catalytic, electrochemical and chemical properties, we demonstrate an improvement of the photocatalytic activity of Ti3C2Tx as a co-catalyst by annealing a composite of carbon nitride and Ti3C2Tx. Ti3C2Tx with an oxygen terminated surface improved the separation of electron-hole pairs and resulted in a 105% enhancement in the production ratio of hydrogen evolution compared to control samples. The best hydrogen production performance reached as high as 88 mu mol h(-1) g(cat)(-1). The apparent quantum yield (AQY) reached as high as 1.27%. The DFT calculations also demonstrate a better hydrogen evolution on Ti3C2 with oxygen surface termination.									172	13	0	0	20	0	176			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000434625200038

Here, using Se doped phosphides inside nitrogen doped carbon (skin-core structure) as catalysts, the HER performance in alkaline electrolyte was improved. The overpotential of 261 mV at 400 mA cm(-2) was among the top level reported so far. Based on the combination of experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the interior CoSe phase generated by Se modification provides faster charge transfer from the inner to carbon layer, facilitating the rate-determining step (Volmer). Also, the needle-like nanowire array facilitates the H-2 desorption at a large current density. Furthermore, a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency up to 10.2% was demonstrated. This work may provide an effective strategy to boost the reaction kinetics via accelerating interfacial charge transfer ability of electrocatalysts.									77	16	0	0	1	0	78			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000639191300023

PBMNC-0.1 NSs demonstrate the best ORR/OER bifunctional activity among all PBMNC-x samples with a bifunctionality index (BI) of 1.36 V, which is the combined OER and ORR overpotential (eta) at 10 and-3 mA/cm(2) current density, respectively. To promote the OER performance, chemically attached 2D heterojunctions of PBMNC-0.1 NS and ymol % of NiFe (3 : 1) layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) were hydrothermally synthesized. Among the PBMNC/LDH-y heterojunctions, PBMNC/LDH-20 shows the lowest BI of 1.06 V because of an electronic reorganization at the heterojunction as evidenced from Mott-Schottky analysis. Proof of concept rechargeable zinc-air battery (r-ZAB) with PBMNC/LDH-20 cathode exhibits a specific capacity of 695.6 mA.h/g(Zn) and roundtrip charge-discharge stability for 100 h at 5 mA/cm(2), surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art Pt/C-RuO2 couple.									10	1	0	0	0	0	9			2196-0216			WOS:000605216400023

However, these heterogeneous reactions exhibit sluggish kinetics due to multistep electron transfer and only occur at triple-phase boundary regions. Up to now, tremendous attention has been attracted to develop cost-effective and high-performance electrocatalysts to boost the electrocatalytic activities as promising alternatives to noble metal counterparts. In addition to the prolific achievements in materials science, the advances in interface chemistry are also very critical in consideration of the complex phenomena proceeded at triple-phase boundary regions, such as mass diffusion, electron transfer, and surface reaction. Therefore, insightful principles and effective strategies for a comprehensive optimization, ranging from active sites to electrochemical interface, are necessary to fully enhance the electrocatalytic performance aiming at practical device applications.& para;& para;In this Account, we give an overview of our recent attempts toward efficient gas-involving electrocatalysis with multiscale principles from the respect of electronic structure, hierarchical morphology, and electrode interface step by step. It is widely accepted that the intrinsic activity of individual active sites is directly influenced by their electronic structure. Heteroatom doping and topological defects are demonstrated to be the most effective strategies for metal-free nanocarbon materials, while the cationic (e.g., Ni, Fe, Co, Sn) and anionic (e.g., O, S, OH) regulation is revealed to be a promising method for transition metal compounds, to alter the electronic structure and generate high activity. Additionally, the apparent activity of the whole electrocatalyst is significantly impacted by its hierarchical morphology. The active sites of nanocarbon materials are expected to be enriched on the surface for a full exposure and utilization; the hybridization of other active components with nanocarbon materials should achieve a uniform dispersion in nanoscale and a strongly coupled interface, thereby ensuring the electron transfer and boosting the activity. Furthermore, steady and favorable electrochemical interfaces are strongly anticipated in working electrodes for optimal reaction conditions. The powdery electrocatalysts are suggested to be constructed into self-supported electrodes for more efficient and stable catalysis integrally, while the local microenvironment can be versatilely modified by ionic liquids with more beneficial gas solubility and hydrophobicity.& para;& para;Collectively, with the all-round regulation of the electronic structure, hierarchical morphology, and electrode interface, the electrocatalytic performances are demonstrated to be comprehensively facilitated. Such multiscale principles stemmed from the in-depth insights on the structure-activity relationship and heterogeneous reaction characteristics will no doubt pave the way for the future development of gas-involving energy electrocatalysis, and also afford constructive inspirations in a broad range of research including CO2 reduction reaction, hydrogen peroxide production, nitrogen reduction reaction, and other important electrocatalytic activation of small molecules.									346	54	0	0	14	0	350			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000430515100006	29384364

First, we found that the light-response curves of oxygen evolution are well fitted with a hyperbolic function, the shape of which is not affected by the beta-CD concentration. Second, we showed that under conditions of irradiation with white light of saturating intensity (similar to 5000 mu mol of photons/m(2.)s) beta-CD enhances the oxygen evolution in the thylakoid membranes according to a sigmoid function displaying a sharp inflection point, or transition. Unexpectedely, this beta-CD effect is not observed at irradiances of less than similar to 300 mu mol of photons/m(2.)s. We attempted a theoretical analysis of the combined effect of irradiance and beta-CD concentration on oxygen evolution (OEth). For this purpose, the effect of irradiance (I) was modeled with a hyperbola (i) and the beta-CD concentration (C) contribution with a Hill equation, that is, a sigmoid function (ii). The mathematical simulations generated the following general expressions: (i) OEth = [OEmax(0) G(1)(C)]I/[L-1/2(0) G(2)(C) + I] and (ii) G(i)(C) = 1 + p[C-n/(K-1/2(n) + C-n)], where OEmax(0) is the OE maximum (OEmax) in the absence of beta-CD, L-1/2(0) is the photon flux density giving OEmax/2 in the absence of beta-CD, G(1)(C) or G(2)(C) is obtained from G(i)(C) where i is 1 or 2, n is the Hill coefficient, p is a parameter to account for the beta-CD-mediated maximum OE increase, and K-1/2 is the beta-CD concentration giving half-maximal OE activity. The results of the calculations yielded the expression (iii) OEth = 151[1 + 3.3C(4.8)/(13.1(4.8) + C-4.8)]I/{97.5[1 + 5.2C(7.8)/ (14.8(7.8) + C-7.8)] + I} which agrees well with the experimental data for a broad range of I and C. Note that, for C = 0, eq iii reverts to the light-response curve of oxygen evolution in the absence of beta-CD. We conclude that eq iii is a good approximation of the combined effect of irradiance and beta-CD concentration, meaning that the model has a significant value for predicting the outcome of associated photochemical and biochemical reactions.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			1520-6106			WOS:000230896500067	16852855

Herein, we proposed maximizing interface integration and surface reconstructing engineer strategy to improve the CO2RR activity and selectivity of heterojunction photocatalyst. A surface-reconstructed ZnO/CuOx catalysts are uniformly anchored on the porous carbon nanosheet arrays that are supported by carbon nanofibers (ZnO/CuOx-C CNFs). Downsizing ZnO/CuOx maximizes the interface integration of components to promote electron-hole pairs separation and increase surface active site density. Moreover, the surface reconstruction (the formation of the hydroxyl groups on ZnO via facile light irradiation) promotes the kinetic of CO2RR to CH4 and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), while depressing the competing HER and CO generation. All these advantages contribute to the excellent catalytic performance: a high CH4 generation rate of 241.6 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) with the selectivity of similar to 96 % for ZnO/CuOx-C CNFs under full light irradiation. The insight into the modification of photocatalyst structure and mechanism investigation pave the way for a new design strategy to advance solar photocatalytic technology for CO2 reduction.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000621624900006

However, due to the competition of anode chlorine evolution and the phenomenon of cathode fouling, direct seawater electrolysis faces great challenges. Alkali treatment of seawater is the treatment method for most work at present, but there is currently no uniform standard for the amount of alkali. Obviously, excessive alkali treatment will increase operating costs. Here, the NiFe LDH material, which is considered to have the best catalytic OER performance, is grown on carbon cloth, and the optimal amount of alkali treatment seawater is explored. By determining the amount of alkali by the amount of precipitation, it can reduce the operating cost of industrial production. It can also prevent the impact of sedimentation on the life of the equipment. We believe that this treatment method will make a great contribution to the future standard seawater pretreatment method.(c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The Ni-Co-Fe-S/rGO possesses ultrafast electron transfer and ion diffusion, benefiting from its unique morphology of one-dimensional (1D) sulfide nanowires wrapped into two-dimensional (2D) rGO nanosheets. Furthermore, the charge re-balancing after electron transfer among Ni, Co and Fe in the unit system leads to the overlap of the electron cloud and the change of band structures. Consequently, it delivers excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances with a low Tafel slope of 56.4 mV dec(-1), an overpotential of 251 mV@10 mA cm(-2)and excellent stability over 36 h. Moreover, it shows a high photocatalytic degradation (POD) efficiency of 96.06% for rhodamine B dye with excellent cyclic degradation stability. This work presents a novel approach for the controllable synthesis of low-cost bifunctional catalysts with boosted OER and POD performances.									39	4	0	0	4	0	39			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000548452100011

Herein, we have designed and developed a low cost electrocatalyst by a ligand-assisted synthetic strategy in an aqueous medium. An oxalate ligand-assisted non-oxide electrocatalyst was developed by a simple wet-chemical technique for alkaline water oxidation application. The synthetic parameters for the preparation of nickel-cobalt oxalate (Ni2.5Co5C2O4) were optimized, such as the metal precursor (Ni/Co) ratio, oxalic acid amount, reaction temperature, and time. Microstructural analysis revealed a mesoporous block-like architecture for nickel-cobalt oxalate (Ni2.5Co5C2O4). The required overpotential of Ni2.5Co5C2O4 for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was found to be 330 mV for achieving 10 mA cm(geo)(-2), which is superior to that of NiC2O4, CoC2O4, NiCo2O4 and the state-of-the-art RuO2. The splendid performance of Ni2.5Co5C2O4 was further verified by its low charge transfer resistance, impressive stability performance, and 87% faradaic efficiency in alkaline medium (pH = 14). The improved electrochemical activity was further attributed to double layer capacitance (C-dl), which indefinitely divulged the inferiority of NiCo2O4 compared to Ni2.5Co5C2O4 for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The obtained proton reaction order (rho(RHE)) was about 0.80, thus indicating the proton decoupled electron transfer (PDET) mechanism for OER in alkaline medium. Post-catalytic investigation revealed the formation of a flake-like porous nanostructure, indicating distinct transformation in morphology during the alkaline OER process. Further, XPS analysis demonstrated complete oxidation of Ni2+ and Co2+ centres into Ni3+ and Co3+, respectively under high oxidation potential, thereby indicating active site formation throughout the microstructural network. Additionally, from BET-normalised LSV investigation, the intrinsic activity of Ni2.5Co5C2O4 was also found to be higher than that of NiCo2O4. Finally, Ni2.5Co5C2O4 delivered a TOF value of around 3.28 x 10(-3) s(-1), which is 5.56 fold that of NiCo2O4 for the alkaline OER process. This report highlights the unique benefit of Ni2.5Co5C2O4 over NiCo2O4 for the alkaline OER. The structure-catalytic property relationship was further elucidated using density functional theory (DFT) study. To the best of our knowledge, nickel-cobalt oxalate (Ni2.5Co5C2O4) was introduced for the first time as a non-precious non-oxide electrocatalyst for alkaline OER application.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2516-0230			WOS:000649421200001	36133027

Five samples, varying in thickness from 4.5 nm to 255 nm, were electrodeposited from the solution containing K3IrCl6 + Na2SO4. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were applied for morphology and chemical composition analysis. Metallic iridium was detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The HER was investigated by polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. Polarization curves were characterized with the low Tafel slopes -18 mV dec(-1), while at higher current densities increased up to -56 mV dec(-1). The overpotential at j = -0.1 A cm(-2) was-45 mV, while at j = -0.01 A cm(-2) varied from 25.1 mV to 36.1 mV. These novel catalysts exhibited excellent activity, especially under industrial conditions of hydrogen production (j = -0.3 A cm(-2)) the determined overpotentials were between 66 and 69 mV only.

Driven by the different electrochemical potentials between Ni and Fe, the dissolution of surface Fe occurs with electroless plating of Ni on iron foam with no need to access instrumentation and input energy. A facile cyclic voltammetry treatment is subsequently applied to convert the metallic NiFe to NiFeOx. A series of analytical methods indicates formation of a NiFeOx film of nanosheets on the iron foam surface. This hierarchically structured three dimensional electrode displays high activity and durability against water oxidation. In 1 M KOH, a current density of 1000 mA cm(-2) is achieved at an overpotential of only 300 mV. This method is readily extended to fabricate CoFe or NiCoFe-based integrated electrodes for water oxidation. Phosphorization of the bimetallic oxide (NiFeOx) generates the bimetallic phosphide (NiFe-P), which can act as an excellent electrocatalyst for hydrogen production in 1 M KOH. An alkaline electrolyzer is constructed using NiFeOx and NiFe-P coated iron foams as anode and cathode, which can realize overall water splitting with a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 630 mV.									110	7	0	0	4	0	111			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000405839400026

To develop efficient Pt catalysts in nonacidic media, Pt electrocatalysts with a Rh core and a shell of a few Pt atomic layers (Rh@Pt-nL, n = 1, 2, 2.6) are designed. Ultrathin Pt atomic layers on a Rh core modulate electronic structures of Rh@Pt-nL electrocatalysts, generating a combined effect of ligand, compressive strain, and electron transfer. The Rh@Pt-nL electrocatalysts thus offer significantly higher HER activity in alkaline and neutral media than the RhPt alloy, Rh/C, and commercial Pt/C catalysts. The overpotential of a Rh@Pt-2L electrocatalyst is only 5 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. The density functional theory calculations confirm that the excellent HER activity of this Rh@Pt-2L electrocatalyst in nonacidic media is attributed to an enhanced hydrogen desorption and a decreased energetic barrier during the hydrogen generating process. These Rh@Pt-nL electrocatalysts shed the light on the design of advanced catalysts to efficiently produce green hydrogen in nonacidic media.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000854883300001

Herein, CozNiySxPPy composites with three-dimensional (3D) cauliflower-like were firstly prepared on carbon fiber paper (CFP) via a simple and efficient electrochemical reduction of elemental sulfur in the precursor of S@PPy composite coated on CFP to react with Co and Ni ions in the electrolyte. The optimum electrode, i.e., CozNiySx@PPy/CFP-6 (A-6) prepared by using an electrolyte with a Co/Ni molar ratio of 0/6, showed excellent catalytic activity (with an overpotential of 185 mV@10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 78.13 mV dec(-1)) as well as long-term stability (at least 100 h) in 1 M KOH solutions.

When the resultant electrodes act as an electrocatalyst for alkaline water splitting, the Co-Pi/CoP/Ti exhibits the superior activity for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The Co-Pi/CoP/Ti requires only 310 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER catalysis, which is competitive with state-of-the-art RuO2 and superior to most of cobalt-based phosphides. Mechanistic study suggests that the Co-Pi/CoP undergoes composition and structure conversion during OER catalysis, which endows this electrode with the synergetically improved electrocatalytic OER activity. Serving as a robust bifunctional electrode in a two-electrode configuration for alkaline water electrolyzer, the Co-Pi/CoP/Ti affords current density of 10 mA cm(-2) by a cell voltage of only about 1.60 V and maintains its stable performance for at least 24 h. Even the overall water-splitting device based on Co-Pi/CoP/Ti electrodes can be powered by a 1.5 V AAA battery. The present finding offers an attractive electrode for cost-effective and energy-efficient water electrolysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, a high dispersion of RuNi alloy nanoparticles on an N-doped carbon layer (RuNi@CN) were synthesized by calcining a solid mixture of D-glucosamine hydrochloride (GAH), melamine, RuCl3 and Ni(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O in an inert atmosphere. The calcination temperature was an important factor that affected the electrocatalytic performance of RuNi@CN. The RuNi@CN electrocatalyst obtained under optimized conditions showed high efficiency and stable activity for the HER over a wide range of pH values, especially under alkaline conditions. The overpotentials of RuNi@CN-700 at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) were 76.26 and 213.69 mV, respectively, with a Tafel slope of 66.35 mV dec(-1). Ruthenium is the cheapest platinum group metal, and its content in the catalyst was only 0.1209 wt%.

Metal-doping and construction of heterogeneous structure are two start-of-the-art strategies to increase the OER activity of transition metal materials. In this work, we exhibit the design and construction of a unique coral-like 3D hierarchical Mn-doped Ni2P-Ni5P4/NF (Mn-Ni-P/NF) OER catalyst. The Mn-doped Ni2P-Ni5P4/NF hybrid catalyst is synthesized on Ni foam by hydrothermal and followed in situ phosphidation, which exhibits superior OER catalytic performance with an overpotential of 230 mV (vs. RHE) at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) and 70 mV lower than Ni2P-Ni5P4/NF (300 mV). Furthermore, it also exhibits good long-term stability for 20 h. This work provides a good thought named metal-doping transition metal phosphide complexes to improve the catalytic activity for OER. Such a superior OER performance is main attributed to the unique morphology, the doping of metal Mn regulating the metal phosphide Ni2P-Ni5P4 nanosheet structure to be a 3D rough high-active-sites nanorod structure with the in situ formed oxidized Ni species on the surface and effective composite nanostructures.

Although LaMnO3 perovskite oxide presents excellent ORR catalytic activity, its OER activity is inadequate to serve as a dual-functional catalyst for ZABs. To enhance the OER activity of LaMnO3 perovskite, this work used a simple and easy-to-operate ultrasonic mixing technique to prepare the LaMnO3-CoO composite. The enhancement of OER and ORR catalytic activity of LaMnO3 perovskite by CoO was investigated. Meanwhile, the cycling stability and polarization behavior of the assembled ZABs using LaMnO3-CoO composite as an air electrode were further evaluated. The battery delivered a maximum power density of 101.48 mW cm(-2) and a high energy efficiency of up to 58.6% after 150 cycles. The LaMnO3-CoO composite exhibited better cycling stability than commercial Pt/C catalyst, which indicates that the LaMnO3-CoO composite is a promising dual-functional catalyst and can be applied in commercial Zn-air battery with an effective electrocatalytic activity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000739930000001

Herein, a facile and conventional strategy is developed to fabricate ultrafine Mo-based nanoparticles (MoP, Mo2C and MoS2) dispersed on hierarchically porous carbon nanosheets. The involved polymer-confinement pyrolysis process can not only efficiently alleviate the aggregation of Mo-based nanoparticles, but also in situ achieve different Mo-based components on various heteroatoms-doped carbon nanosheets without further post-modification. The hierarchical nanostructure and synergistic effect between carbon substrates and Mo-based nanoparticles enhance the electrochemical performance of the fabricated materials. For instance, the developed MoP@NPCS exhibits outstanding hydrogen evolution performance with high Faradaic efficiency in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes, being one of the impressive catalysts reported to date for hydrogen evolution reaction.

The hydrothermally synthesized Ni3S2 has a hierarchical structure with abundant active sites exposed, and intimate interfacial contact can be formed during the in situ synthesis process. Moreover, the intercalated GF has a large surface area and good electric conductivity, which can create a new short route to facilitate electron transfer onto the active surface of Ni3S2. The Ni3S2@GF@NF electrode exhibits an excellent hydrogen evolution reaction performance with an early overpotential of 99 mV vs reversible hydrogen electrode at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 98.2 mV dec(-1) in alkaline solutions. However, the overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope for the oxygen evolution reaction are 240 mV and 62.4 mV dec(-1) in alkaline solutions. Using Ni3S2@GF@NF as both anode and cathode, only a small cell voltage of 1.63 V is needed to obtain 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting, comparable with the best free-standing materials. Moreover, it exhibits a good stability due to the protection of GF. The free-standing Ni3S2@GF@NF electrode contains no noble metals and should have a great potential in electrochemical water splitting.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000474269800007

The microstructure characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that surface oxygen vacancies (VO) at FeOOH NSs provide preferential deposition sites not only for CdS NCs to grow high-quality interface and form the heterostructure, but also for inert molecule adsorption. Owing to the synergistic effects of the VO-assisted interfacial charge transfer and surface reactions, the optimized FeOOH/CdS heterostructures display a single-carbon compound production rate of 18.43 mu mol g-1 h-1 (5.88 mu mol g- 1 h- 1 for CH4, 12.55 mu mol g- 1 h- 1 for CO), about 6.2 and 8.5 times higher than their separated counterparts, and an O2 evolution rate of 676.50 mu mol g-1 h-1 under visible-light irradiation.

Consequently, an appropriate analytical procedure becomes mandatory to detect and quantify the produced hydrogen in different photocatalytic systems so that the quantification, as well as the photocatalytic experiment is reliable and repeatable. Herein, this work represents a first-of-the-kind approach proposing guidelines for a robust detection and quantification of hydrogen evolved from photocatalytic reaction systems together with standard operation procedures to consider when performing photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions. Gas chromatography with thermal conductivity detector (GC-TCD) was chosen as the analytical tool for the detection and quantification through the preparation of calibration curves carried out emulating the reaction conditions i.e. introducing hydrogen into a reactor containing electrolyte solution and sealed with a silicon septum for gas tight assurance. Validation parameters were calculated and linearity of the calibration curves obtained with the proposed methodology was proved. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The investigated aspects reveal that alpha-MoO3/Ni hybrid exhibits a remarkable performance in HER showing +6 mV onset potential and 37 mV overpotential at 10 mA/cm(2) current density along with Tafel slope of 47 mV/dec. The single crystalline-stepped CVD-grown MoO3 microflakes having the advantage of higher hydrogen binding energy of Ni exhibits the enhanced catalytic performance due to strong electronic coupling at the metal-oxide interface and hydrogen spill over effect. Similar hybrid material composed of Cu-MoO3 does show improvement but not as good as Ni-MoO3. A decrease of similar to 36% is observed in the overpotential for Ni-coated MoO3 compared to pure MoO3 crystals indicating the positive contribution of Ni-coating. The hybrid Ni-MoO3 shows the new route to develop alternate transition metal oxide-based hybrid catalyst towards production of hydrogen fuel. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Here, we report a brand-new, low-cost phosphated Zn-doped bimetallic (Fe/Mn) skeleton (Zn-Fe/Mn@Mn-FeP, FMZP4) with genuine potential as a highly effective water-splitting electrocatalyst. Benefiting from heterogeneous atom doping as well as a self-supported electrode composed of a porous Zn-Fe/Mn skeleton and in situ grown phosphides (Mn-FeP) with a hierarchical ultrathin nanosheet structure, which provide rapid electron transport and efficient mass transport channels, the optimized FMZP4 exhibits low overpotentials of 53 mV and 184 mV to reach current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(10)) and 20 mA cm(-2) (eta(20)) for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively, revealing good stability in a long potential cycling test (1000 cycles) and remaining completely stable over an 80 h galvanostatic measurement at 10/50 mA cm(-2). More impressively, it needs just 1.79 V to achieve eta(50) for full water splitting in an alkaline electrolyte and exhibits superior electrochemical durability. The excellent electrocatalytic activity makes it a candidate material for a low-cost electrocatalyst with broad applicability in water splitting.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000788169200001

Particularly, the single crystalline feature of Co3O4 nanosheets with a predominant high reactivity {112} exposed crystal plane and hierarchical porous nanostructure displayed better catalytic performance for both oxygen reduction reaction (during discharge process) and oxygen evolution reaction (during charge process). Li-O-2 battery with Co3O4 nanosheets cathode exhibited a higher discharge specific capacity (965 mAh g(-1)), lower discharge/charge over-potential and better cycling performance over 63 cycles at 100 mA g(-1) with the specific capacity limited at 300 mAh g(-1). The superior catalytic performance of Co3O4 nanosheets cathode is ascribed to the enlarging specific area and increasing the exposed Co(3+)catalytic active sites within predominant {112} crystal plane which plays the key role in determining the adsorption energy for the reactants, enabling high round-trip efficiency and cyclic life.

Cell ageing is however markedly pronounced at elevated voltages and results in accelerated overall performance fade and increased safety concerns. Online electrochemical mass spectrometry, combined with cell pressure analysis, is for the first time shown to provide a powerful means for in situ investigation of degradation mechanisms in aqueous electrolyte/carbon based supercapacitors. The activated carbon electrodes possess high specific surface area and oxygen-based surface functionalities (mainly phenol, lactone and anhydride groups), which are oxidized already at a cell voltage of 0.6 V to provoke the evolution of minor amounts of CO and CO2. Noticeable water decomposition starts at a high voltage of 1.6 V with the evolution of H-2 on the negative electrode and carbon corrosion on the positive electrode with the generation of predominantly CO. In this paper we also report that short-term cycling leads to partly reversible gas evolution/consumption side-reactions giving negligible capacitance. On the other hand, long-term cycling causes irreversible side-reactions, deteriorates the electrochemical performance, and increases the internal pressure of the cell. Repeated cycling (U < 2 V) is confirmed as a more harmful technique for the electrode integrity compared to the voltage holding in a floating test. In situ gas analysis is shown to provide valuable insights into the electrochemical cell ageing aspects, such as the nature and potential onsets of side-reactions, hence paving the way for fundamental understanding and mitigating the performance and safety loss of high-energy aqueous supercapacitors.									166	5	0	0	4	0	168			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000369744500027		
J	Jatoi, Yasmeen Faizi; Fiaz, Muhammad; Athar, Muhammad								Synthesis of efficient TiO2/Al2O3@Cu(BDC) composite for water splitting and photodegradation of methylene blue								JOURNAL OF THE AUSTRALIAN CERAMIC SOCIETY				57	2			489	496		10.1007/s41779-020-00548-z		JAN 2021		APR 2021	2021	Development of an efficient photocatalyst for the water splitting to fulfill the increasing energy demands of world and degradation of organic pollutant in water especially methylene blue to make it safe for aquatic life is a great challenge. In this reported article, an efficient and novel photocatalyst TiO2/Al2O3@Cu(BDC) has been synthesized by in situ incorporation of pre-synthesized precursors into Cu(BDC). It shows maximum activity towards water splitting for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Similarly, it shows maximum activity for photodegradation of methylene blue as compared to all other synthesized samples. Results showed that this novel TiO2/Al2O3@Cu(BDC) composite exhibits increase charge separation and better photocatalytic activity as compared to precursors. It is observed that maximum photocatalytic activity of TiO2/Al2O3@Cu(BDC) is mainly due to successful formation of hetro-junction between TiO2/Al2O3 and Cu(BDC) and reduce of electron-hole pair recombination. Under irradiation of visible light, photoexcited electrons are transferred from conduction band of Cu(BDC) to conduction band of TiO2/Al2O3 and further these photoexcited electrons form the O2(center dot-) and center dot OH radicals at surface of photocatalyst, which directly degrade the methylene blue. On the other side at valance band of Cu(BDC), positive hole (h(+)) forms the center dot OH radicals and degraded the methylene blue. This study encourages the development of more efficient MOFs based photocatalyst and used in photocatalytic applications.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2510-1560	2510-1579		WOS:000605897800007

Here we develop a direct deep eutectic solvent (DES) calcining method to prepare low-dimensional and highly active TMOs for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Glucose monohydrate and urea can form a glucose-urea DES, which was calcined under a N-2 atmosphere to produce 2D N,O-doped graphene. When metal precursors were introduced into the glucose-urea DES and calcined together, the TMOs were templated by graphene flakes and exhibited low-dimensional morphologies. With this method, 2D nanonet-shaped La0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3 (LSCF), Co3O4, NiCo2O4, and RuO2 and 1D nanowire-shaped Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3 (BSCF) were readily synthesized, and their thickness and porosity can be conveniently tuned by adjusting the concentrations of metal salts. Our nanostructured TMOs were further applied for the OER, and they showed quite competitive activities over their counterparts obtained from other methods. The 2D porous LSCF20-DES exhibited the largest specific surface area (28.9 m(2) g(-1)) and the highest OER electrocatalytic activities (0.304 V overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)). These results demonstrate that the DES calcining method is a comprehensive approach to synthesize hierarchical TMOs as highly active OER catalysts.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000581650100014	33029600

The effects of the near surface deformed layer (NSDL) and its removal by polishing on the electrochemical activities of the alloy surface were evaluated and compared by the use of different modes of SECM. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were also employed to characterize the morphology of the surfaces. The surface chemistry was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The surface generation/tip collection (SG/TC) and competition modes of the SECM were used to study hydrogen gas (H-2) evolution and oxygen reduction reactions, respectively. H-2 evolution and oxygen reduction were more pronounced on the polished surfaces. The feedback mode of SECM was adopted to characterize the electrochemical activity of the polished surface that was previously corroded by immersion in a chloride-containing solution, in order to investigate the influence of the products formed on the active/passive domains. The precorroded surface and as-received surfaces revealed lower electrochemical activities compared with the polished surface showing that either the NSDL or corrosion products largely decreased the local electrochemical activities at the AA2098-T351 surfaces.									10	1	0	0	0	1	10			0142-2421	1096-9918		WOS:000479330900001

Heterogeneous catalysis can help cope with such demand, provided that rational, accurate and affordable design methods lead to the discovery of cost-effective and efficient catalysts. Here we derive a simple descriptor to simultaneously capture two parameters commonly used in catalytic materials design: strain and coordination. We test the descriptor with four different adsorbates on four active sites of two metals, and applying strain in the range of +/- 3%, usually observed experimentally at catalytic metal surfaces. Furthermore, we use the descriptor to illustrate catalyst design availing strain and nearest-neighbor effects simultaneously for the oxygen reduction reaction, a reaction of high importance in fuel cells. The connection between coordination and strain helps in the search for robust yet rapid catalyst design methodologies.									40	1	0	0	0	0	40			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000434961400012	29701917

Herein, an innovative hammer-shaped structure has been well developed by in situ assembly of ZIF-67 nanocubes on the surface of one-dimensional (1D) NiMoO4 nanorods. After doping with an ultralow amount of Ir, the NiMoO4-ZIF hammers are demonstrated to be highly active toward the OER, delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with an ultralow overpotential of 235 mV. On the basis of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and surface valence band spectra, it is revealed that the ultralow Ir doping can effectively modify the electronic structure of the metal center, leading to optimization of the binding strength with O* and OOH*. Moreover, the hammer-like architecture and intimate interface between NiMoO4 and in situ formed CoOOH also contribute to the substantial improvement in OER performance. This work manifests the significance of an electronic and architecture engineering strategy for an improvement in electrocatalytic performance and presents an advanced OER electrocatalyst.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10				1466-8033		WOS:000841169200001

Porous deposits attract great interest due to their wide range of possible applications in electrocatalysis. In addition, an advanced porous electrode should have both, micro and nanoscaled features. We report the synthesis of a multiscale open porous foam of NiCoFe and its excellent electrocatalytic performance. At a current density of 1 A cm(-2) a 3D dendritic structure with open pores is obtained with pore walls having a morphology that consists of 'cauliflower-like' particles containing open multiscaled dendritic structures. Cyclic voltammograms of a smooth NiCoFe electrode are compared with those of the achieved nanodendritic NiCoFe foam electrode. The catalytic activity of the NiCoFe foam is strongly enhanced for both, the cathodic reduction of oxygen and the anodic evolution of oxygen and shows a good reversibility. Therefore the presented new material is promising as bifunctional catalyst in electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, a novel method involving the adjustment of pH and use of a surfactant is used to synthesize Sr2FeMoO6 having more oxygen vacancies. The synthesized photocatalyst (Sr2FeMoO6) is used to study the relationship between oxygen vacancies and photodegradation of methyl blue (MB) solution. Sr2FeMoO6 samples were prepared using sol-gel (S1 sample), hydrothermal (S2 sample), and thermal decomposition of a metal-organic salt using organic solvent methods (S3 sample). The photocatalytic activities of synthesized samples fell in the descending order of: S3 > S1 > S2. Similarly, the surface oxygen vacancies of synthesized photocatalysts (S1, S2 and S3) were found to be in the descending order of: S3 > S1 > S2. Based upon the comparison and analysis of S1 and S4, the effect of pH value under similar synthesis conditions was studied. Furthermore, EDTA (surfactant) was used to synthesize Sr2FeMoO6 (herein, referred to as S5) having the same pH as that of S3. The comparison of S4 and S5 samples was used to probe the effect of Sr2FeMoO6 photocatalyst, synthesized using a surfactant-assisted route. Excellent photocatalytic activity was found for sample S5, where the pH of 8 was the optimum for sol-gel preparation method. The MB solution can be degraded completely (100%) in 35 min for S5 sample. The results indicate that the lattice oxygen vacancies can promote the harvesting of visible light and narrow the band gap, while the surface oxygen vacancies can increase the separation efficiency of charge-carriers. Beside their critical role in the evolution of photocatalytic oxygen, the surface oxygen vacancies also proved helpful in separating electrons and holes.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000463008200031

However, if direct seawater electrolysis can be realized, it would revolutionize the energy and environmental sectors. In this review, the current effective strategies are summarized, including electronic modulation, oxygen vacancies creation, amorphous and porous structure design, corrosion-resistant passive layer decoration, and creating strong catalyst-support interactions. The review also provides insights for seawater electrolysis on rational design of the OER catalyst with high selectivity, activity, corrosion resistance, chemical, and mechanical durability. Beyond the progress made to date, a perspective in the fabrication of high-performance anodes for direct seawater electrolysis is also proposed. Collectively, this review will shed light on the rational design of a viable anode for massive and sustainable hydrogen fuel production from immense seawater.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2688-4046			WOS:000840900100001

The overpotentials at 100 mA cm(-2) of Sn-Ni(OH)(2) are 312 mV (OER) and 298 mV (HER), which are lower than the corresponding 396 and 427 mV of Ni(OH)(2), respectively. In addition, Sn-Ni(OH)(2) can deliver stable large current densities (at approximate to 500 and approximate to 1000 mA cm(-2)) for the long-term (>100 h) chronoamperometry testing. Moreover, Sn-Ni(OH)(2) illustrates catalytic activity comparable to that of a commercial Pt/C parallel to RuO2 electrode pair during the overall water splitting course. Both experimental phenomena and relevant computed theoretical data confirm that the enhanced water splitting activity is mainly due to the introduced Sn4+ site, which acts as the active center activates the nearby Ni sites during the OER, while acting as the most active reaction site that participates in the HER. Although the doped Sn4+ has two different effects on OER and HER proceedings, water splitting performance of Sn-Ni(OH)(2) has been conspicuously improved.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000697282300049	34473469

Herein, we smartly develop a universal, green, and sustainable low-temperature oxidative thermal redispersion strategy to fabricate metal oxide precursors and subsequently well dispersing and stabilizing MNPs (M = Rh, Ru, Ir) over oxygenated carbons (Mesoporous carbon, Ketjen black, and Vulcan carbon), which can be utilized as efficient catalysts for hydrogen production from ammonia borane (AB) hydrolysis and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Such flexible modulation strategy enables the formation of oxidized metal species on oxygenated carbons, which is the key to synthesize ultrasmall MNPs against sintering and agglomeration during the reduction process. Attributing to the innately structural/componential/surficial superiorities, the optimal Rh/C-300A-350H exhibits the highest catalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution from AB hydrolysis and HER with turnover frequencies of 3308/5040 min(-1) in aqueous/basic solutions and an overpotential of 29 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. With the similar activation mechanism for dissociation of O-H bond in H2O, the highly dispersed Rh NPs with ultrafine sizes and electronic metal-support interaction are responsible for the excellent catalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reactions. This study presents an extremely facile and sustainable modulation strategy for increasing the adhesion of MNP catalysts on oxygenated carbons for catalytic applications.									20	0	0	0	6	0	20			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000780376000003

Herein, a bimetallic core-shell structure with open cages of Fe-doped CoP (Fe-CoP cage) has been synthesized using CoFe-PBA cage-4 as precursor through a facile hydrothermal method and following phosphating process. Interestingly, there is an open hole in each face center of Fe-CoP cage, which suggests the more exposure of active sites for OER. Electrochemical measurements show that Fe-CoP cage can afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential (300 mV), which is better than that of RuO2. The excellent performance can be attributed to Fe doping composition and unique open-cage core-shell structure. The synergistic effect derived from bimetallic active for OER has been discussed. And its great catalytic stability has been evaluated via 1000 cycles of CV and chronoamperometry measurement. This work provides a potential method to design multiple transitional metal-doping electrocatalysts with complex framework derived from PBAs for water splitting.

However, the application of strain engineering in electrocatalysis has been limited by the strain relaxation caused by structural instability such as dissolution and destruction, leading to insufficient durability towards the ORR/OER. Herein, we propose a doping strategy to modulate the phase transition and formation of self-supported cobalt fluoride-sulfide (CoFS) nanoporous films using a low amount of copper (Cu) as a dopant. This well-defined Cu-CoFS heterostructure overcomes the obstacle of structural instability. Our study of the proposed Cu-CoFS also helps establish the structure-property relationship of strained electrocatalysts by unraveling the role of local strain in regulating the electronic structure of the catalyst. As a proof-of-concept, the Cu-CoFS electrocatalyst with doping-modulated strain exhibited superior onset potentials of 0.91 V and 1.49 V for the ORR and OER, respectively, surpassing commercial Pt/C@RuO2 and benchmarking non-platinum group metal (non-PGM) catalysts. ZABs with the Cu-CoFS catalyst delivered excellent charge/discharge cycling performance with an extremely low voltage gap of 0.5 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and successively 0.93 V at a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2) and afforded an outstanding peak power density of 255 mW cm(-2).									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000683772000001

Developing highly efficient catalysts to improve catalytic activity and alleviate oxidation-reduction overpotential of Li-O-2 batteries is of great challenge and importance. Herein, a CO2-assisted thermal-reaction strategy is developed to fabricate isolated semi-metallic selenium single-atom-doped Ti3C2 MXene catalyst (SASe-Ti3C2) as cathodes for high-performance Li-O-2 batteries. The isolated moieties of single Se atom catalysis centers can function as active catalytic centers to drastically enhance the intrinsic LiO2-absorption ability and thus fundamentally modulate the formation/decomposition mechanism of lithium peroxide (Li2O2) discharge product, thus demonstrating greatly enhanced redox kinetics and efficiently ameliorated overpotentials. Theoretical simulations reveal that the interaction between Se-involved moieties and Ti3C2 substrate greatly enhances the intrinsic LiO2-absorption ability and fundamentally promotes the charge transfer between electrode and Li2O2 product, deeply ameliorating the round-trip overpotential. The well-designed SASe-Ti3C2 electrode exhibits decreased charge/discharge polarization (1.10 V vs Li/Li+), ultrahigh discharge capacity (17 260 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1)), and superior durability (170 cycles at 200 mA g(-1)) as cathode for Li-O-2 batteries. The promising results will shed light on the design of highly efficient catalysts for oxygen-involved systems of future investigation.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000649313700001

Herein, a green and comprehensive recycling method based on the direct current (DC) electric field driven de-lithiation is developed and the feasibility of the strategy is systematically investigated. The results demonstrate that during the recycling process, the lithium ions can be effectively recovered with simultaneous H-2 production. Meanwhile, the de-lithiated electrode materials exhibit a remarkable electrocatalytic activity, which is proved to be related to their high specific surface area as well as their large amount of lattice oxygen. Based on the Daedalian combination of efficient lithium recycling and applications of the de-lithiated cathode materials for oxygen evolution reaction, this study provides an effective strategy for recycling and making maximum use of the spent lithium-ion battery electrode materials based on the DC electric field driven de-lithiation process.									23	1	0	0	5	0	23			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000600016600005

However, proper verification of the stability of these materials is still pending. Here we introduce a metric to explore the dissolution processes of various iridium-based oxides, defined as the ratio between the amounts of evolved oxygen and dissolved iridium. The so-called stability number is independent of loading, surface area or involved active sites and provides a reasonable comparison of diverse materials with respect to stability. The case study on iridium-based perovskites shows that leaching of the non-noble elements in mixed oxides leads to the formation of highly active amorphous iridium oxide, the instability of which is explained by the generation of short-lived vacancies that favour dissolution. These insights are meant to guide further research, which should be devoted to increasing the utilization of highly durable pure crystalline iridium oxide and finding solutions to stabilize amorphous iridium oxides.									288	18	0	0	20	0	292			2520-1158			WOS:000446621500010

We prepare the five catalysts by electrodepositing MnOx on polished glassy carbon electrodes and heat treating them under different conditions: no heat treatment ("no ht"), 250 degrees C, 350 degrees C, 450 degrees C, and 500 degrees C. We find that "no ht" catalyst, despite having the lowest (pseudo) capacitive current, is capable of the largest changes in Mn oxidation state, as the applied potential switches from an ORR to an OER relevant value. Heat treatment at 450 degrees C or 500 degrees C, leading to a significant increase in (pseudo) capacitance, is on the other hand associated with only minor changes in the surface oxidation state. Investigation of (pseudo) capacitive behavior of the same MnOx thin films electrodeposited on a high surface area rather than polished carbon support reveals that the observed differences in pseudocapactive current can be explained by changes in the surface area of the electrocatalysts. Characterization of the electrocatalytic activity of the thin films demonstrates that the catalysts exposed to the two highest temperatures are associated with enhanced bifunctional activity for the ORR and the OER. The enhancement in the ORR activity is attributed to the formation of a Mn2O3 phase, while the enhancement in the OER activity is primarily explained by the increase in the electrochemical surface area of the catalyst.					13th Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell Symposium (PEFC)13th Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell Symposium (PEFC)	OCT 27-NOV 01, 2013OCT 27-NOV 01, 2013	Electrochem Soc; Electrochem Soc, Ind Electrochemistry & Electrochem Engn Div; Electrochem Soc, Battery Div; Electrochem Soc, Corros Div; Electrochem Soc, Energy Technol Div; Electrochem Soc, Phys & Analyt Electrochemistry Div; N E Chemcat CorpElectrochem Soc; Electrochem Soc, Ind Electrochemistry & Electrochem Engn Div; Electrochem Soc, Battery Div; Electrochem Soc, Corros Div; Electrochem Soc, Energy Technol Div; Electrochem Soc, Phys & Analyt Electrochemistry Div; N E Chemcat Corp	San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA	17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1938-5862		978-1-60768-446-6; 978-1-60768-445-9	WOS:000354475600073

Currently in academia, many of these studies are carried out in conventional three-electrode cell set-ups; however, this configuration may not accurately represent conditions experienced under practical electrolyser conditions. Herein, a range of transition metal oxide (TMO) catalysts are evaluated and compared in a three-electrode cell and in an electrolyser. We show that the same catalyst significantly underperforms in a three-electrode cell. Hence, many OER catalysts in academic labs may have been erroneously omitted from further optimisation processes due to showing 'poor' performance in conventional three-electrode cells. Herein, we wish to show this discrepancy experimentally and suggest a solution to scientists wanting to find active OER catalysts by using 3D-printing to inexpensively manufacture electrolyser devices for OER catalyst evaluation.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000632140300001

Surface morphology and microstructure of the coatings were investigated by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Systematic study of electrochemical properties of these coatings was performed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and polarization measurements. The corrosion behavior of the coatings was evaluated under accelerated conditions (j = 2 A cm(-2)) in acidic electrolyte. The role of iridium oxide admixture in the change of electrocatalytic activity and stability of Ru0.6Ti0.4O2 coating was discussed. Small addition of IrO2 can improve the stability of the RuO2 + TiO2 mixed oxide, while the electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is decreased. The shift of redox potentials for Ru0.6Ti0.4O2 electrode that is slightly activated with IrO2 and improvement in the stability can be attributed to the synergetic effect of mixed oxide formation.

Ni-(Ebonex-supported Ir) coatings were electro-deposited from a nickel Watts bath containing different concentrations of suspended Ebonex/Ir particles (0-2 g dm(-3)) onto a Ni 40 mesh substrate. The surface morphology of the coatings was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the surface composition by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), whereas the electrochemical properties were studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), polarization measurements and cyclic voltammetry (CV). It was shown that the roughness factor of Ni-(Ebonex/Ir) composite coatings calculated relative to the surface area of the pure Ni sample increased with the increasing content of Ebonex/Ir particles in the bath to a maximum value of 40.6. All samples displayed a Tafel slope of about 60 mV dec(-1) in the potential range corresponding to lower current densities for the OER. The increase of the apparent activity for the OER at Ni-(Ebonex/Ir) coatings compared with the pure Ni coating was attributed only to the increase of the electrochemically active surface area. Although the pure Ni coating initially exhibited higher intrinsic catalytic activity for the OER than the composite coatings, it also showed a drastic loss of activity after subjecting to continuous oxygen evolution at j = 50 mA cm(-2) for 24 h (Delta E = 395 mV). At the same time, the OER overpotential at Ni-(Ebonex/Ir) coatings only negligibly increased after the stability test (Delta E = 22 mV). The improved retention of catalytic activity observed with Ni-(Ebonex/Ir) coatings was ascribed to the presence of IrO2 which inhibited the formation of the inactive gamma-NiOOH phase.

Here, a novel Ni/NiO monolithic electrode was developed by a facile and cost-effective acid promoted activation of Ni foam. After the treatment, this obtained monolithic electrode with a layer of NiO on its surface demonstrates rough and sheet-like morphology, which not only possesses larger accessible surface area but also provides more reactive active sites. Compared with powder catalysts, this monolithic electrode can achieve intimate contact between the electrocatalyst and the current collector, which will alleviate the problem of pulverization and enable the stable function of the electrode. It can be served as an efficient bi-functional electrocatalyst with an overpotential of 160 mV for HER and 290 mV for OER to produce current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) in the alkaline medium. And it maintains benign stability after 5,000 cycles, which rivals many recent reported noble-metal free catalysts in 1.0 mol L-1 KOH solution. Attributed to the easy, scalable methodology and high catalytic efficiency, this work not only offers a promising monolithic catalyst but also inspires us to exploit other inexpensive, highly efficient and self-standing noble metalfree electrocatalysts for scale-up electrochemical water-splitting technology.									20	3	0	0	1	0	20			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000416928000002

It is significant to decrease their usage and increase the active sites in the catalysis. Herein, Rh nanocrystals were grown on the surface of silicon quantum dots with the help of Si-H bonds to obtain Rh-Si composites, which combined with carbon quantum dots to fabricate Rh-Si-C nanocomposites. The silicon quantum dots limited the size of Rh and prevented the aggregation. The addition of carbon quantum dots greatly increased the electron transportation during the catalytic process. When the Rh-Si-C nanocomposites were applied as electro-catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the optimal one exhibits Pt-like HER performance (low Tafel slope of 26 mV.dec(-1) and long-term stability) with the content of noble metal less than half of that in 20 wt% Pt/C.

Herein, a novel highly active and stable oxygen electrode catalyst is designed based on in situ construction of FeCo alloy nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (FeCo/N-CNTs-800) with a bamboo-like structure. The unique architecture of bamboo-like nanotubes, the large surface area with abundant mesoporous structure, and the strong coupling interactions between the encapsulated alloy nanoparticle core and the nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon shell synergistically enhance the electrocatalytic activity. As a result, FeCo/N-CNTs-800 exhibits remarkable ORR (with a half-wave potential of 0.891 V in 0.1 M KOH) and OER (with an overpotential of 359 mV to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH) performance, respectively. More impressively, an assembled zinc-air battery with the bifunctional FeCo/N-CNTs-800 catalyst as the air electrode demonstrates a large power density of 200.4 mW cm(-2) and robust cycling performance over 445 h compared to precious-metal catalysts Pt/C parallel to IrO2. Thus, the electrocatalyst presented in this work holds great potential as an air cathode for practical applications of zinc-air batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000850596000001	36069863

Here, a distinct multifunctional binder-free flexible electrode is developed by arrays of flower-like beta-NiS nanostructures over flexible carbon cloth (beta-NiS@CC) by the in situ hydrothermal method. It unveils an ultimate areal capacity of 1.654 C cm(-2) (827 C g(-1)) at 1 mA cm(-2), which seems to be the highest among the reported NiS so far. The fabricated flexible supercapattery gadget delivers a remarkable energy density of 38 mu Wh cm(-2) at a power density of 800 mu W cm(-2). Due to immense mechanical strength and resilience of 3D flower-like morphology, it is further exposed as an economical bifunctional electrocatalyst. Both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) exhibit a significant burst of the enormous quantity of gas bubbles at the low overpotentials of 320 and 278 mV, respectively, to achieve a current density of 20 mA cm(-2). Further, the developed laboratory scale water electrolyzer offers a low cell voltage of 1.65 V to accomplish a water-splitting current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Henceforth, the multifunctional 3D flower-like beta-NiS electrode is demonstrated by defining its potential use in real-world appliances.									41	2	0	0	2	0	41			2196-7350			WOS:000425729300006		
J	Wu, Chuchu; Zhang, Xiaoming; Li, Huanqiao; Xia, Zhangxun; Yu, Shansheng; Wang, Suli; Sun, Gongquan				Xia, Zhangxun/GNP-3137-2022				Iron-based binary metal-organic framework nanorods as an efficient catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction								CHINESE JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				42	4			637	647		10.1016/S1872-2067(20)63686-5				APR 2021	2021	First-row transition metal compounds have been widely explored as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts due to their impressive performance in this application. However, the activity trends of these electrocatalysts remain elusive due to the effect of inevitable iron impurities in alkaline electrolytes on the OER; the inhomogeneous structure of iron-based (oxy)hydroxides further complicates this situation. Bimetallic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have the advantages of well-defined and uniform atomic structures and the tunable coordination environments, allowing the structure-activity relationships of bimetallic sites to be precisely explored. Therefore, we prepared a series of iron-based bimetallic MOFs (denoted as Fe2M-MIL-88B, M = Mn, Co, or Ni) and systematically compared their electrocatalytic performance in the OER in this work. All the bimetallic MOFs exhibited higher OER activity than their monometallic iron-based counterpart, with their activity following the order FeNi > FeCo > FeMn. In an alkaline electrolyte, Fe2Ni-MIL-88B showed the lowest overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (307 mV) and the smallest Tafel slope (38 mV dec(-1)). The experimental and calculated results demonstrated that iron and nickel exhibited the strongest coupling effect in the series, leading to modification of the electronic structure, which is crucial for tuning the electrocatalytic activity.

The scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy results show that the P-Co0.9Ni0.9Fe1.2 NCs maintain a cubic structure with a rough surface, implying the rich surface defects as exposed active sites. The thermal phosphorization of the ternary PBA precursor not only provids carbon doping but also leads to the in situ construction of surface defects on the NCs. The carbon doping from the PBA precursor lowers the charge transfer resistance and optimizes the electronic transformation. The synergistic effect among the ternary metal ions and rich defects contributes to the enhanced electrocatalytic performance. The P-Co0.9Ni0.9Fe1.2 NCs achieve low overpotentials of -200.7 and 273.1 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the hydrogen evolution reaction and the oxygen evolution reaction, respectively. The potential of overall water splitting reaches 1.52 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The long-term stability of the electrocatalysts was also evaluated. This work provides a facile method to design efficient transition-metal-based bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									47	7	0	0	0	0	47			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000485550400006

The resulted data provided confirmation of the destructive role of Pt surface-electrosorbed acetonitrile on the kinetics of underpotentially deposited hydrogen, as well as cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction. The above was exclusively elucidated through evaluation of the associated charge-transfer resistance and capacitance (and complementary exchange current-density and Tafel slope) parameters, derived comparatively on Pt for pure and acetonitrile-modified acidic and alkaline electrolytes.									2	1	0	0	0	0	2				2073-4344		WOS:000551869300001

Particle size effects of tetrahedron-shaped Ag3PO4 photocatalyst on water-oxidation activity and carrier recombination dynamics								Chemical Physics Letters: X				2				100023 (5 pp.)	100023 (5 pp.)		10.1016/j.cpletx.2019.100023				April 2019	2019	We investigated photocatalytic water-oxidation performance of tetrahedron-shaped silver phosphate (Ag3PO4) crystals with various particle sizes. The performance was clearly influenced by the particle size. The maximum activity was found for the particle with a tetrahedron edge with 1.5 mum length, which showed the highest rate of oxygen evolution. A series of analysis against time-resolved diffuse reflection spectra of the powder samples reveals that not only carrier recombination dynamic but also photoexcited carrier density can play important roles in the water oxidation. Our finding should contribute to give one of the basic ideas when designing semiconductor photocatalysts for water splitting.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			2590-1419			INSPEC:21247058

Here, a novel and rational strategy for the fabrication of ultra-small quasi-core/shell Ru-RuO2 nanostructures (similar to 4 nm) through graphdiyne (GDY) in-situ thermal reduction is reported. The as-prepared GDY supported ultra-small quasi-core/shell Ru-RuO2 (RuO2-Ru/GDY) exhibits an excellent OER performance in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte, with an extremely low overpotential of 163 mV to attain 10 mA cm(-2) as well as an over 75 h stability without significant increase in overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2). The enhanced activity and stability of the catalyst can be attributed to the interaction between Ru core and RuO2 shell, where the former can effectively regulate the electron density of Ru in RuO2 shell, resulting in the optimal binding energy between Ru active sites and the oxygen intermediate for boosting the acidic OER ultimately.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2053-1583			WOS:000702057600001

In contrast, on semiconductors such as BiVO4, deposition of classic Co-based oxygen evolution catalysts (e.g. Co3O4, CoOOH) leads to a relatively low improvement of the photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance. This illustrates that even though a species may be an excellent electrocatalyst, it may not be an effective co-catalyst for PEC reactions. Clearly, for different semiconductors there is a need to directly identify and prepare specific, highly active and low-cost cocatalysts for promoting PEC water oxidation. Co(CO3)(0.5)(OH)center dot 0.11H(2)O (or in general Co(CO3)(x)OHy) is usually used as a precursor to synthesize a range of Co-based efficient electrocatalysts. Herein, we for the first time show that Co(CO3)(x)OHy on BiVO4 provides an excellent oxygen evolution reaction activity, even close to the so far most efficient dual-layer FeOOH/NiOOH cocatalysts. Decoration of BiVO4 with Co(CO3)(x)OHy and the resulting photoanode shows a remarkable enhancement of photocurrent, achieving a photocurrent density of 5.0 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE with an onset potential of 0.3 V-RHE, which is one of the highest PEC activities of BiVO4 reported up to now. The outstanding PEC performance can be attributed to the improvement of charge separation and transfer efficiency caused by a uniform thin coating of Co(CO3)(x)OHy. The Co(CO3)(x)OHy exhibits the highest density of active sites, the highest surface area, and the best OER activity among the investigated cobalt-based cocatalysts. Remarkably, the Co(CO3)(x)OHy also displays a self-healing function in borate buffered electrolytes. Therefore, this work not only describes low-cost but highly active cobalt-based catalysts for PEC solar water oxidation, but additionally shows a self-repair function of this system.									30	4	0	0	1	0	30			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000521200000029

Herein, a urea-bridge method has been exploited to fabricate stable metallic single atom dispersed on nitrogen-doped carbon tubes. The preparation involved a facile pyrolysis of ellagic acid (EA)-metal coordination compound mediated through the usage of urea. During the synthesis process, urea acted as a bridge to drive the formation of hollow carbon tube as well as to provide N sites to immobilize SA in a space-confined environment. The active SA sites together with the accessibility and rapid mass transport from the hollow substrate endowed the obtained EA-SAs (e.g. EA-Co-900, EA-Ni-900) outstanding performances in oxygen reduction/evolution reactions. Furthermore, EA-Co-900 showed a high power density (e.g. 73 mW cm(-2), at 65 mA cm(-2)) and excellent durability of 110 h at 20 mA cm(-2) when assembled into rechargeable zinc-air batteries.									55	0	0	0	1	0	55			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000483451200002

As such, understanding how it promotes the evolution of hydrogen and oxygen is of high importance. In this study, we employ scanning tunneling microscopy to study the adsorption and reaction of hydrogen on a model RuO2(110) surface. We find that at low coverages H-2 dissociates heterolytically to hydride-hydroxyl pairs even at 5 K. The onset temperature for the low coverage H-2 dissociation is surprising as it is not expected based on prior temperature programmed desorption studies. At higher coverages, H-2 chemisorbs molecularly on bare ruthenium sites that are neighboring the hydride-hydroxyl pairs. Upon annealing, the chemisorbed H-2 disappears by 120 K, primarily due to H-2 desorption from the surface. Further annealing between 120 and 295 K leads to the conversion of hydride species to bridging hydroxyls. The bridging hydroxyls ultimately recombine between 450 and 600 K to form water, yielding clean RuO2(110) with oxygen vacancies.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0039-6028	1879-2758		WOS:000447478700035

The prepared catalyst of Ir/C-1 with Ir cluster (d = 3 +/- 0.1 nm) highly dispersed and closely attached to pore carbon through Ir-O-C bonds shows both excellent OER and HER performance. At a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the catalyst shows overpotentials of only 50.4 mV for HER and 359 mV for OER in 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively, which are better than commercial Ir/C and Pt/C catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further revealed that the exposure of Ir (110) in Ir/C-1 can facilitate the thermodynamic process of HER and OER. This paper also gives a detailed discussion about the enhancement mechanism. To validate the catalyst, a single electrolysis cell is assembled using the prepared Ir/C-1 catalyst as both the anode and cathode catalysts. The result shows that the cell only needs a cell voltage of 1.653 V to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is better than commercial Ir/C and Pt/C catalysts.

Remarkably, the OER activity of the polymorphs strongly depends on the atomic configurations in the crystals, and shorter Fe-O bond lengths are more beneficial for the OER. DFT calculations reveal that the trend of Fe-O bond length on the Fe2O3 polymorphs exhibits a positive correlation with their energy gaps between the occupied oxygen 2p and the unoccupied iron 3d orbitals, i. e., charge-transfer energy, which promotes the OER activities of metal oxides. Surprisingly, the relationship between the Fe-O bond length and the OER activity can also be applied to a wide range of previously reported Fe-based multimetal oxide OER catalysts, regardless of their chemical compositions and categories of crystal structures, including perovskite, spinel, brownmillerite, and other types of oxides. The discovered descriptor is an important guideline for the rational design of Fe-based oxides with excellent catalytic properties for the OER and contributes to the establishment of a hydrogen society.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2196-0216			WOS:000707395700001

Complex B was found to be kinetically and thermodynamically more active than complex A. The overpotential and Tafel slope of complex B are lower than those of complex A by 30 mV and around 45 mV/decade, respectively, which supports the higher activity of B. Moreover, stability tests endorse the sustainability of both samples under alkaline conditions. It has been found that the 3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl substituent in B plays a decisive role in achieving a better OER onset potential and current than that obtained with A, which is a result of the modulation of the structural parameters of B. Furthermore, the measured OER activities of A and B have been correlated with their molecular arrangement as well as differences in their bonding characteristics and dipole moments. For further insight, the obtained results have been confirmed by a theoretical study.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1434-1948	1099-0682		WOS:000430285700001

The unique 3D self-branched nanostructure anchored on flexible carbon textiles (CTs) can offer short ion diffusion length, fast and continuous electron transport pathway, and abundant reaction active sites. More importantly, the rational incorporation of Zn2+ generates hollow structure as well as reduces the intrinsic band gap, which further enhance the ion transportation efficiency and electronic conductivity. The above superiorities endow the 3D self-branched ZnCo2O4@NC/CTs electrodes with remarkable performances in terms of flexible asymmetric supercapacitor and oxygen electrocatalysis. When evaluated as a flexible cathode for asymmetric supercapacitor, the as-fabricated ZnCo2O4@NC/CTs electrode exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance with a wide work voltage up to 2.0 V, high areal energy density of 0.278 mWh cm(-2) (or volumetric energy density of 2.32 mWh cm(-3)) and long-term cycling stability (similar to 85.89% capacitance retention over 6000 cycles).

HTT and/or calcination of home-made and commercial H2WO4 solids of tungstite structure also produced WO3. These WO3 powders with various physical properties were used as photocatalysts for evolution of oxygen (O-2) from an aqueous silver sulfate solution, and the correlation between their physical properties and photocatalytic activity was examined. WO3 powders of high crystallinity, e.g., IE-HTT-WO3 synthesized at 573 K, gave the highest O-2 yield, suggesting that the crystallinity of WO3 is a key factor in its high activity for this reaction system. Calcination at < 1073 K improved the crystallinity of some WO3 powders, resulting in increases in their activities; however, calcination at a higher temperature reduced the activity, presumably due to formation of oxygen vacancies acting as recombination centers.									56	2	0	0	4	0	57			0959-9428	1364-5501		WOS:000172664200068

In this study, cobalt (Co) and iron (Fe) doped nickel (Ni) hydroxide nanosheets directly formed onto the surface of Ni foam are synthesized and developed for use as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. When Co-doped nickel hydroxide is used as HER catalyst, it exhibited a high HER activity with a durability better than Pt/C. The as-prepared Fe-doped nickel hydroxide show an OER activity, which is even higher than that of RuO2. When Fe-doped nickel hydroxide and Co-doped nickel hydroxide are both used as HER and OER catalysts in a water electrolyser cell, a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.59 V is observed, a similar value than that obtained for a water electrolyser based on state-of-the-art RuO2 and Pt/C catalysts. Moreover, the as-prepared Fe, Co doped nickel hydroxide also exhibit a good durability when compared to RuO2 and Pt/C under water electrolyser conditions.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000576738900003

General methods that tackle this challenge are highly sought after as multicomponent metal nanoparticles display favorable properties in applications such as catalysis, biomedicine, and imaging. Herein, we report a practical and versatile approach for the synthesis of nanoparticles composed of up to four different metals. This method relies on the thermal decomposition of nanostructured composite materials assembled from platinum nanoparticles, a metal organic framework (ZIF-8), and a tannic acid coordination polymer. The controlled integration of multiple metal cations (Ni, Co, Cu, Mn, Fe, and/or Tb) into the tannic acid shell of the precursor material dictates the composition of the final multicomponent metal nanoparticles. Upon thermolysis, the platinum nanoparticles seed the growth of the multicomponent metal nanoparticles via coalescence with the metallic constituents of the tannic acid coordination polymer. The nanoparticles are supported in the walls of hollow nitrogen-doped porous carbon capsules created by the decomposition of the organic components of the precursor. The capsules prevent sintering and detachment of the nanoparticles, and their porosity allows for efficient mass transport. To demonstrate the utility of producing a broad library of supported multicomponent metal nanoparticles, we tested their electrocatalytic performance toward the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. We discovered functional relationships between the composition of the nanoparticles and their electrochemical activity and identified the PtNiCu and PtNiCuFe nanoparticles as particularly efficient catalysts. This highlights how to generate diverse libraries of multicomponent metal nanoparticles that can be synthesized and subsequently screened to identify high-performance materials for target applications.									52	2	0	0	5	0	52			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000433404500056	29667838

Herein, we show the influence of electrochemical activation of carbon cloth substrate on the morphology and electrocatalytic properties of bifunctional electrodes for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A simple one-step electrodeposition technique was applied to directly grow mixed Co-based films on electrochemically activated carbon cloth (EACC) surface. The produced films are composed of metallic Co, and largely amorphous CoO/Co(OH)(2) phases. Variation of Co2+ concentration in the solution for electrode position enabled tuning the composition of mixed films in order to achieve the optimal HER and OER electrocatalytic performance in 0.1 M KOH. The synthesized electrodes require the overpotentials of 195 mV for HER and 340 mV for OER to deliver the current density of 10 mA/cm(2). The results indicate that the facile oxidation of carbon cloth prior to the electrodeposition decreases the overpotential at 10 mA/cm(2) by 150 and 60 mV for HER and OER respectively, thus opening the perspective of improving the activity of carbon-based self-supported composite electrocatalytic electrodes for advanced energy conversion processes.

Activation energy and analysis of possible pathways of photosynthetic evolution of oxygen								Biophysics				34	6			1098	104						1989	1989	From analysis of the main contributions to the activation energy of a series of stages of oxidation of water to O2 the following conclusions are drawn: the barrier set up by the repulsion of unbound O atoms on their convergence is partially overcome through the energy of binding of the water molecules by manganese ions. Concerted electron and proton transfer with the participation of bases stronger than water greatly improves the energetics of the process; the most probable pathway of the reaction is the rate-determining two-electron oxidation of water to hydrogen peroxide (the possibility of this process taking place in two successive single-electron stages is not clear) with two subsequent fast stages of oxidation of H2O2 to HO2 and then to O2.									2	0	0		0	0	2			0006-3509			INSPEC:4001747

Double-layer electrochemical structure of Ti based IrO_2 + Ta_2O_5 anodes was deduced, with the low-frequency region corresponding to the impedance behaviors of the interface between outer surface and electrolyte, and the high-frequency to those of inner surface. A general equivalent circuit R_s(R_1Q_1) (R_2Q_2)L was suitable over a wild potential region. It was showed that after oxygen evolution the total reaction area on electrode surface intended to increase compared with that at double-layer potential for oxygen evolution. The modification of surface by evolving oxygen was greatly affected by the surface morphologies. The surface modification, resulting from the finest grains existed on surface, appeared to be most significant for the electrodes corresponding to a IrO_2 content of 70% (mole fraction). With the increasing of preparation temperature, the double-layer structure became less obvious, compactness increases and active surface area decreases.			测量了Ti基IrO_2 + Ta_2O_5混合氧化物涂层的电化学阻抗谱(EIS)，研究了Ti基IrO_2 + Ta_2O_5混合氧化物涂层阳极度在H_2SO_4溶液中的电化学表面结构以及电化学行为。这种涂层阳极度具有多层电化学结构，低频段的阻抗行为对应电极外表面/溶液界面的阻抗特性，高频段对应内表面/溶液界面的电化学特性和电极度的物理阻抗。在析氧电位下，由于析出氧气的冲击，电极表面的总反应面积增大，而且析出的氧气对电极表面的改性受表面涂层的组织形态影响很大。由于晶粒的最细化，这种改性作用在IrO_2含量为70%时最为明显。制备温度的升高使氧化物电极的多孔结构变得不明显、致密度上升以及活性表面积下降。						2	9	0	0	0	0	10			1005-3093			CSCD:981131

Here, we report a well-integrated and stable beta-NiMoO4 that was fabricated on three dimensional (3D) nickel foam (NF) by a simple hydrothermal approach. The obtained beta-NiMoO4 with interesting honeycomb like interconnected nanosheet microstructure leads to excellent electrochemical activity. As an electrode for Supercapatteries, beta-NiMoO4-NF showed a high specific capacity of 178.2 mA h g(-1) (916.4 F g(-1)) at 5 mA cm(-2) current density. Most importantly, the fabricated symmetric device exhibits a maximum specific energy of 35.8 W h kg(-1) with the power output of 981.56 W kg(-1) and excellent cyclic stability. In methanol electro-oxidation, the beta-NiMoO4-NF catalyst deliver the high current density of 41.8 mA cm(-2) and much lower onset potential of 0.29 V with admirable long term stability. Apart from the above electrochemical activity, the beta-NiMoO4-NF honeycomb microstructure demonstrates a promising non-noble electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and showed a considerable overpotential of 351 mV (OER) and 238 mV (HER). The attractive multifunctional electrochemical activity of beta-NiMoO4-NF could be originates from their unique honeycomb micro/nano structure which can acts as an "ion reservoir" and thus leads to superior energy storage and conversion processes.

We herein report the high photocatalytic OER and HER activities of Bi2WO6 nanoplates (BWO NPs) which are synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method, and the switchable OER and HER performances controlled by the pH value of the precursor solvent. In the pH range from 4 to 9, the thickness of BWO NPs along the [001] direction exhibits interesting dependence on the pH value, which decreases as the pH value increases. Correspondingly, the BWO NPs obtained at the pH value of 7 (BWO-7) show the highest photocatalytic OER activity, while the BWO NPs synthesized at the pH value of 9 (BWO-9) exhibit the highest photoactivity towards HER. The electronic band structure analysis indicates that the highest photocatalytic OER activity is related to the band alignment of the valence band maximum of Bi2WO6, which determines the efficient separation of photogenerated electrons and holes as well as the fast charge transfer kinetics. The crystal facet evolution resulting from thickness reduction promotes the exposure of {001} facets for HER and decreases the exposure of {100} and {010} facets for OER. This work provides new insights into the combined effects of crystal facets and electronic band structures on photocatalysis.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			0021-9797	1095-7103		WOS:000692120400015	34175635

The inhibitory effect of these effecters on photosynthesis was confirmed by Hill reaction as well as by EPR and fluorescence spectroscopies. The results of the EPR study showed that the sites of action of the studied effecters are Z(+) and Y+ intermediates at the donor side of the photosystem (PS) 2. The EPR study also showed that another site of action is the oxygen evolving complex, namely its manganese cluster. The above suggestions were supported by the results of the fluorescence study as well. Based on the restoring of the photosynthetic electron transport to 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol in chloroplasts inhibited by the studied Cu(II) complexes using sym-diphenylcarbazide it can be assumed that the own core of PS2 (P680) and a part of the electron transport chain - at least up to plastoquinone remain intact.									16	0	0	0	12	1	17			0231-5882			WOS:A1994QR15900004	7797055

However, their practical applications are severely hindered by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the air cathode. Herein, a porphyrin covalent organic framework (POF) was innovatively designed and applied as a cathode electrocatalyst for flexible Zn-air batteries. Porphyrin active sites were periodically constructed into well-defined two-dimensional (2D) frameworks precisely controlled at the atomic level, and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) served as scaffolds for further morphology regulation. Interwoven into a free-standing, robust, and flexible film, the as-fabricated CNT@POF hybrid demonstrates impressive performance in rechargeable liquid and flexible all-solid-state Zn-air batteries. Specifically, the liquid Zn-air battery with the CNT@POF cathode exhibits a small voltage gap of 0.71 V and outstanding stability for 200 cycles, even better than the noble-metal-based cathode. Flexible all-solid-state Zn-air batteries demonstrate a high energy efficiency of 61.6% at 1.0 mA cm(-2) and the flexibility to stably light a red light-emitting diode (LED, 2.0 V) when bent to different degrees. This contribution demonstrates versatile and ingenious strategies for the multiscale regulation of advanced materials for energy electrocatalysis and thereby facilitates their applications in flexible and safe energy storage and conversion.									220	20	0	0	11	0	223			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000438392400006

The experimental results indicate that the elaborate architectural superiority and composi-tional synergy of this hybrid electrode give rise to the boosted HER performance.

NiOOH phase, as shown from XRD data, participates in the OER mechanism in such a way to facilitate the charge transfer during various steps in the reaction mechanism through a reversible transformation of NiOOH to NiO2. Optimizing the loading level and the operating pH of the proposed catalyst has been carried out. Copyright (C) 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In situ XAFS and DRIFTS were used to study the dynamic evolution of the metal active sites in bimetallic AgxAu25-x nanoclusters supported on ITQ2 zeolite during CO catalytic oxidation. The activity of the bimetallic nanocluster catalyst in this reaction was significantly higher than those of supported monometallic Ag-25 and Au-25 nanoclusters. These results were explained by the formation of AgAu alloyed nanoparticles, which favoured reactant adsorption and reaction. Furthermore, the initial activity depended on the catalyst pretreatment, obtaining better conversion, at lower temperatures, with the catalyst pretreated with hydrogen than with the catalyst pretreated with oxygen. This was also associated with an easier formation of a AgAu alloy under hydrogen pretreatment at 150 degrees C. However, the alloying process seemed to be completed after reaction in both cases, i.e. for the catalyst pretreated with oxygen and with hydrogen, obtaining the same catalytic performance with both catalysts upon reuse. The activity is constant in successive reaction runs, indicating high stability of the active species formed under reaction conditions. The results have shown that the combination of catalytic studies with in situ characterization techniques provides insight into the structural dynamics of the catalysts during activation and reaction.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000729855600007

We determine that the geometric current densities, especially at higher loadings, were greatly enhanced on Au substrates: NiCeOOH/Au reached 10 mA/cm(2) at 259 mV overpotential, and NiFeOOH/Au achieved 140 mA/cm(2) at 300 mV overpotential, which were much greater than those of the analogous catalysts on graphitic carbon (GC) substrates. By performing a loading quantification using both inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry and integration of the Ni2+/3+ redox peak, we show that the enhanced activity is predominantly caused by the stronger physical adhesion of catalysts on Au. Further characterizations using impedance spectroscopy and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed that the catalysts on Au exhibited lower film resistances and higher number of electrochemically active metal sites. We attribute this enhanced activity to a more homogeneous electrodeposition on Au, yielding catalyst films with very high geometric current densities on flat substrates. By investigating the mass and site specific activities as a function of loading, we bridge the practical geometric activity to the fundamental intrinsic activity.									88	3	0	0	3	0	89			2155-5435			WOS:000407309100055		
J	SHEN, JR; BURNAP, RL; INOUE, Y				Shen, Jian-Ren/B-2558-2011				AN INDEPENDENT ROLE OF CYTOCHROME C-550 IN CYANOBACTERIAL PHOTOSYSTEM-II AS REVEALED BY DOUBLE-DELETION MUTAGENESIS OF THE PSBO AND PSBV GENES IN SYNECHOCYSTIS SP PCC-6803								BIOCHEMISTRY				34	39			12661	12668		10.1021/bi00039a023				OCT 3 1995	1995	Cytochrome (cyt) c-550 and the 33 kDa protein are two extrinsic components that function in maintaining oxygen evolution in cyanobacterial cells. Deletion of either of the two components has been shown to result in cyanobacterial phenotypes that are still capable of photoautotrophic growth albeit with a reduced rate. In order to study the function of cyt c-550 in cyanobacterial photosystem II (PSII) and its possible interaction with the 33 kDa extrinsic protein, we constructed a mutant lacking both cyt c-550 and the 33 kDa protein by inactivating the psbV and psbO genes simultaneously in a cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The resultant double-deletion mutant was unable to grow photoautotrophically and showed almost no oxygen-evolving activity (less than 10% of the wild type). This residual activity was also lost rapidly upon illumination, suggesting an increased sensitivity of the mutant cells toward photoinhibition. Thermoluminescence measurements indicated that the mutant virtually cannot undergo normal charge accumulation (S-state transitions) leading to oxygen evolution. Herbicide-binding and Western blot analyses showed that the mutant accumulates the PSII complex to an extent of only 20% of that in wild-type cells. Combined with previous results, the present results indicated that cyt c-550 supported oxygen evolution in the single-deletion mutant lacking the 33 kDa protein alone and vice versa. Thus, both cyt c-550 and the 33 kDa protein function independently in maintaining cyanobacterial oxygen-evolving activity in vivo, and both of them are required for the optimal activity. This not only provides another conclusive Line of evidence for the concept that cyt c-550 functions in cyanobacterial PSII oxygen evolution but also reveals a functional difference between this extrinsic cyt in cyanobacterial PSII and the extrinsic 23 kDa protein in higher plant PSII, as the 23 kDa protein alone cannot support oxygen evolution in the absence of the 33 kDa protein.									68	0	0	0	61	0	69			0006-2960			WOS:A1995RY46000023	7548017

As switching from acidic proton exchange membrane to alkaline hydroxide one, it is highly promising to completely replace platinum group metal (PGM)-based ORR electrocatalysts with PGM-free counterparts. However, anodic hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), with a fast kinetics in PEMFCs even at a low Pt loading of 50 mu g(Pt) cm(-2) or less, becomes two orders of magnitude slower in alkaline media and thus requires a high loading of PGM-based electrocatalysts to accelerate the reaction rate. Alkaline HOR has drawn a great number of recent attentions, yet a comprehensive review is missing. Herein, this review covers diverse possible alkaline HOR mechanisms, hardly comparable electrocatalysts evaluation methods, two seemingly contradictive activity descriptors, as well as design and synthesis of PGM-based and PGM-free electrocatalysts with controlled structural parameters. Wherever is appropriate, this review describes our own point of view on certain subjects. Finally, future research directions are suggested. This review will provide knowledge and insights on fundamental and practical issues for the development of advanced alkaline HOR electrocatalysts and mechanism.									127	14	0	0	6	0	128			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000419833900034		
J	Campbell, TJ; Aral, G; Ogata, S; Kalia, RK; Nakano, A; Vashishta, P								Oxidation of aluminum nanoclusters								PHYSICAL REVIEW B				71	20					205413	10.1103/PhysRevB.71.205413				MAY 2005	2005	The dynamics of oxidation of aluminum nanoclusters (20 nm diameter) is investigated using a parallel molecular dynamics approach based on variable charge interatomic interactions due to Streitz and Mintmire that include both ionic and covalent effects. Simulations are performed for both canonical ensembles for molecular oxygen (O-2) environments and microcanonical ensembles for molecular (O-2) and atomic (O-1) oxygen environments. Structural and dynamic correlations in the oxide region are calculated, as well as the evolution of charges, surface oxide thickness, diffusivities of atoms, and local stresses. In the microcanonical ensemble, the oxidizing reaction becomes explosive in both molecular and atomic oxygen environments due to the enormous energy release associated with Al-O bonding. Local stresses in the oxide scale cause rapid diffusion of aluminum and oxygen atoms. Analyses of the oxide scale reveal significant charge transfer and a variation of local structures from the metal-oxide interface to the oxide-environment interface. In the canonical ensemble, oxide depth grows linearly in time until similar to 30 ps, followed by saturation of oxide depth as a function of time. An amorphous oxide layer of thickness similar to 40 angstrom is formed after 466 ps, in good agreement with experiments. The average mass density in the oxide scale is 75% of the bulk alumina density. Evolution of structural correlation in the oxide is analyzed through radial distribution and bond angles. Through detailed analyses of the trajectories of O atoms and their formation of OAln structures, we propose a three-step process of oxidative percolation that explains deceleration of oxide growth in the canonical ensemble.									74	4	1	0	0	0	78			2469-9950	2469-9969		WOS:000230244300091

Ni-based compounds have attracted substantial attention for achieving efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts. Here, we show superior electrocatalysts based on NiFe alloy electroformed by a roll-to-roll process. NiFe (oxy)hydroxide synthesized by an anodization method for the OER catalyst shows an overpotential of 250 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which is dramatically smaller than that of bare NiFe alloy with an over-potential of 380 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Electrodeposited NiMo films for the HER catalyst also exhibit a small over-potential of 100 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) compared with that of bare NiFe alloy (550 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)). A combined spectroscopic and electrochemical analysis reveals a clear relationship between the surface chemistry of NiFe (oxy)hydroxide and the water splitting properties. These outstanding fully solution-processed catalysts facilitate superb overall water splitting properties due to enlarged active surfaces and highly active catalytic properties. We combined a solution-processed monolithic perovskite/Si tandem solar cell with MAPb(I0.85Br0.15)(3) for the direct conversion of solar energy into hydrogen energy, leading to the high solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 17.52%. Based on the cost-effective solution processes, our photovoltaic-electrocatalysis (PV-EC) system has advantages over latest high-performance solar water splitting systems.									39	3	0	0	0	0	40			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000487179900032	31436403

Herein, we developed CoP-nitrogen-doped carbon@NiFeP nanoflakes (CoP-NC@NFP), derived from MOF enriched with multiple active sites, for multifunctional water splitting and zinc-air battery applications. The experimental results revealed that the multiple active catalytic sites of CoP-NC@NFP were responsible for the excellent chargetransfer kinetics and electrocatalytic performance with respect to water splitting. This performance is comparable to that of precious metal catalysts in alkaline electrolytes (OER: overpotential of 270 mV; HER: overpotential of 162 mV; ORR: Tafel slope of 46 mV dec- 1; overall water splitting device: cell voltage of 1.57 V at 10 mA cm- 2) with excellent electrochemical durability. Additionally, the structural stability of the OER and the HER durability of the CoP-NC@NFP electrocatalyst were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies. Most impressively, zinc-air batteries (ZABs) assembled with CoP-NC@NFP as the air-cathode exhibit exceptionally high power density of 93 mW cm-2 and prolonged operational stability over 200 h compared with a ZAB equipped with a benchmark air-cathode. The outcome of this study opens a practical possibility for the preparation of efficient multifunctional catalysts free of noble metals for clean energy production and storage.									58	2	0	0	3	0	59			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000718409100004

Li2O2 growth process on the cathode relies on the surrounding chemical environment of electrolytes. Low conductivity and strong reactivity of Li2O2 discharge products can cause overpotential and induce side reactions in LABs, respectively, eventually leading to poor cyclability. The capacity and reversibility of LABs are highly susceptible to the morphology of the Li2O2 discharge products. Here, we identify for the first time that a seed layer formed by the combination of a cathode and an electrolyte determines the morphology of Li2O2 discharge products. This seed layer led to its high reversibility with a large areal capacity (up to 10 mAh/cm(2)). Excellent OER (oxygen evolution reaction) was achieved by the formation of a favorable interface between the carbon electrode and electrolyte, minimizing the decomposition of the electrolyte. These remarkable improvements in LAB performance demonstrate critical progress toward advancing LAB into practical uses, which would exploit good reversibility of LABs in pouch-type cell arrangements with 1.34 Ah.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000634759500056	33710866

Here, we report a novel Polypyrrole (PPy) and Tannic acid (TA) modified hollow MIL-88(FeCoNi) (HMIL-88@PPy-TA) on Ni foam. HMIL-88@PPy-TA exhibits outstanding activity in alkaline salty water, showing an extremely low overpotential of 244 and 309 mV at 100 and 500 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH + NaCl, respectively, and long-term durability of at least 100 h. Combing a variety of structural characterization results, the excellent performance could be attributed to modified PPy-TA which would optimize the local electronic structure and induce reconstruction. This discovery not only provides a new way to design efficient OER electrocatalysts for seawater electrocatalysis, but also represents a novel strategy for inducing structural transformation during OER.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000729769700008

It was found that the Ni-Cd system could only consume oxygen, while the Ni-MH system possesses the additional ability to adsorb hydrogen and to catalyze the recombination reaction of hydrogen and oxygen. The internal pressure within both sealed Ni-Cd cells and sealed Ni-MH cells can be kept well under control during the charge/overcharge processes if the rate of overcharge is not too high and if there is sufficient surplus of charging capacity at the negative electrodes. However, the internal pressure can rise to dangerously high levels if the rate of overcharge is too high or there is a deficiency of the charging capacity at the negative electrodes. The various factors that may affect the surplus of charging capacity of the negative electrodes are also discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we report an in situ growth strategy for synthesizing Ti3C2-TiO2 nanoflowers by simultaneous oxidation and alkalization, followed by ion exchange and calcination processes of Ti3C2 MXene as photocatalysts for H-2 and O-2 evolution from water splitting. The effect of the calcination temperature on the photocatalytic performance of the obtained Ti3C2-TiO2 nanoflowers is elucidated. With an optimized calcination temperature of 500 degrees C, the Ti3C2-TiO2 nanoflower shows a remarkable enhancement in the photocatalytic H-2 and O-2 evolution reaction compared with that of pure TiO2. Upon further removing the sacrificial reagent, overall water splitting is accomplished with the Ti3C2-TiO2 nanoflowers (without the use of any noble metal). We further show that the Ti3C2-TiO2 nanoflower has high stability and good reproducibility. The superior performance originated from the 3D porous nanoflower-like structure, which provides more reactive sites, a greater ability to reflect and scatter light, and reduce the diffusion length of photogenerated holes and electrons. Moreover, intimate contact between Ti3C2-TiO2 MXene and TiO2 generates synergetic effect and Schottky junction, enhancing the charge separation and effectively inhibiting recombination, leading to more electrons participating in photoreduction for H-2 evolution and more holes participating in photooxidation for O-2 evolution.

OER activity is expected to depend on the coordination of the surface atoms. In this study, we theoretically investigate the stability of low-index surfaces of TM-doped rutile, (110), (100), (101) and (001), with 50 % of the Ti atoms substituted by Sc, Y, V, Nb or Ta. For Sc and Y, we also consider models with O vacancies providing the most stable oxidation state of Sc and Y. Surface energies are calculated with DFT(+U). Based on the Gibbs-Wulff theorem, the shape of the single crystals is predicted. It is observed that p-doping leads to spontaneous oxygen loss and O vacancies cause surface reconstruction. The Wulff shapes of n-doped TiO2 have smaller contributions of the (110) facet and, for Nb and Ta, larger contributions of other facets. Given the higher coordinative unsaturation of the TM atoms in the latter, a higher catalytic activity is expected.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2191-1363			WOS:000803821900001	35642133

X-ray absorption/photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical calculation results indicate that Fe-O-Ni-O-Fe bonding can facilitate the distorted coordinated structure of the Ni site with a short nickel-oxygen bond and low coordination number, and can promote the redistribution of Ni/Fe charge density to efficiently regulate the adsorption behavior of key intermediates with a near-optimal d-band center. Here the Fe-doped-(Ni-MOFs)/FeOOH with interfacial Fe-O-Ni-O-Fe bonding shows superior catalytic performance for OER with a low overpotential of 210 mV at 15 mA cm(-2) and excellent stability with approximate to 3 % attenuation after a 12 h cycle test.

Herein, we report 2D hybrid nanostructures consisting of 1T ' phase MoS2 and Fe-phthalocyanine (FePc) molecules that exhibit excellent catalytic activity toward both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). X-ray absorption spectra revealed an increased Fe-N distance (2.04 angstrom) in the hybrid complex relative to the isolated FePc. Spin-polarized density functional theory calculations predicted that the Fe center moves toward the MoS2 layer and induces a non-planar structure with an increased Fe-N distance of 2.05 angstrom, which supports the experimental results. The experiments and calculations consistently show a significant charge transfer from FePc to stabilize the hybrid complex. The excellent HER catalytic performance of FePc-MoS2 is characterized by a low Tafel slope of 32 mV dec(-1) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and an overpotential of 0.123 V. The ORR catalytic activity is superior to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst in pH 13 electrolyte, with a more positive half-wave potential (0.89 vs. 0.84 V), a smaller Tafel slope (35 vs. 87 mV center dot dec(-1)), and a much better durability (9.3% vs. 40% degradation after 20 h). Such remarkable catalytic activity is ascribed to the HER-active 1T ' phase MoS2 and the ORR-active nonplanar Fe-N-4 site of FePc.									21	3	0	0	0	0	21			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000484234700022	31317997

While current technologies are sufficient to support commercial deployment of fresh water electrolyzers, there remain a few well-defined challenges in the path of commercializing direct seawater electrolyzers, predominantly related to the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics and the competing chlorine evolution reaction (CER) at the anode. Herein, we report the facile and swift fabrication of an S,B-codoped CoFe oxyhydroxide via solution combustion synthesis for the OER with apparent CER suppression abilities. The as-prepared S,B-(CoFe)OOH-H attained ultralow overpotentials of 161 and 278 mV for achieving current densities of 10 and 1000 mA cm(-2), respectively, in an alkaline saline (1 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl) electrolyte, with a low Tafel slope of 46.7 mV dec(-1). Chronoamperometry testing of the codoped bimetallic oxyhydroxides showed very stable behavior in harsh alkaline saline and in neutral pH saline environments. S,B-(CoFe)OOH-H oxyhydroxide showed a notable decrease in CER production in comparison to the other S,B-codoped counterparts. Selectivity measurements through online FE calculations showed high OER selectivity in alkaline (FE similar to 97%) and neutral (FE similar to 91%) pH saline conditions under standard 10 mA cm(-2) operation. Moreover, systematic testing in electrolytes at pH values of 14 to 7 yielded promising results, thus bringing direct seawater electrolysis at near-neutral pH conditions closer to realization.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2470-1343			WOS:000768149400001	35187367

Herein, a one-pot hydrothermal synthesis method is proposed to grow a series of bimetallic sulfides on carbon cloth (M-Mo-S/CC, M = Co, Ni, Fe) using Anderson-type polyoxometalates (POMs) as bimetallic sources for the first time. An ideal model of M-Mo-S/CC was used to study the growth process through the nucleation- doping competition mechanism. It is proved for the first time that M-Mo-S/CC possess certain compositions of bimetallic sulfides rather than metal doped MoS2 structures because the nucleation reaction is predominant in the nucleation-doping competition. Moreover, the nucleation rates of different metals can be compared to study the different morphologies of M-Mo-S/CC because Anderson-type POMs have fixed bimetal proportions and precise structures. Co-Mo-S and Ni-Mo-S show spherical heterostructures with CoS2 or NiS mainly inside and interconnected MoS2 nanosheets outside, while Fe-Mo-S exhibits uniform nanosheet morphology without stacking. As electrodes for alkaline water electrolysis, M-Mo-S/CC with different compositions and morphologies exhibit a variety of activities. Particularly, among the M-Mo-S/CC samples, Co-Mo-S/CC achieves the best performance for hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction and overall water splitting. This study presents a facile strategy of using POMs as bimetallic precursors for studying the growth mechanism as well as the water electrolysis performances of MoS2-based bimetallic sulfides.									52	6	0	0	3	0	53			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000432096400008	29714389

Among these M4O4 clusters, however, copper-based molecular catalysts are poorly understood. Now, bio-inspired Cu4O4 cubanes are presented as effective molecular catalysts for electrocatalytic water oxidation in aqueous solution (pH 12). The exceptional catalytic activity is manifested with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 267 s(-1) for [(L-Gly-Cu)(4)] at 1.70 V and 105 s(-1) for [(L-Glu -Cu)(4)] at 1.56 V. Electrochemical and spectroscopic study revealed a successive two-electron transfer process in the Cu4 O4 cubanes to form high-valent Cu-III and (CuO center dot)-O-III intermediates during the catalysis.									59	4	0	0	2	0	60			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000435766800048	29701323

Regulating the critical steps to precisely design electrode materials to selectively synthesize targeted compounds is highly desirable. Here, inspired by the surfaced adsorbed SeOx2- promoting OER, NiSe is demonstrated to be an efficient anode enabling alpha-nitrotoluene electrooxidation to E-nitroethene with up to 99 % E selectivity, 89 % Faradaic efficiency, and the reaction rate of 0.25 mmol cm(-2) h(-1) via inhibiting side reactions for energy-saving hydrogen generation. The high performance can be associated with its in situ formed NiOOH surface layer and absorbed SeOx2- via Se leaching-oxidation during electrooxidation, and the preferential adsorption of two -NO2 groups of intermediate on NiOOH. A self-coupling of alpha-carbon radicals and subsequent elimination of a nitrite molecule pathway is proposed. Wide substrate scope, scale-up synthesis of E-nitroethene, and paired productions of E-nitroethene and hydrogen or N-protected aminoarenes over a bifunctional NiSe electrode highlight the promising potential. Gold also displays a similar promoting effect for alpha-nitrotoluene transformation like SeOx2-, rationalizing the strategy of designing materials to suppress side reactions.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000691416600001	34318964

The water-dispersible porous particles contain about 20 wt % poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP), which was added for colloidal stabilization. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy confirms the presence of both iridium and iridium dioxide primary particles (1-2 nm) in each porous superstructure. The internal porosity (approximate to 58 vol%) is demonstrated by electron tomography. In situ transmission electron microscopy up to 1000 degrees C under oxygen, nitrogen, argon/hydrogen (all at 1 bar), and vacuum shows that the porous particles undergo sintering and subsequent compaction upon heating, a process that starts at around 250 degrees C and is completed at around 800 degrees C. Finally, well-crystalline iridium dioxide is obtained under all four environments. The catalytic activity of the as-prepared porous superstructures in electrochemical water splitting (oxygen evolution reaction; OER) is reduced considerably upon heating owing to sintering of the pores and loss of internal surface area.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000479852000001	31140211

In particular, the abundant availability along with improved electrochemical performance is crucial for fuel cell applications when it comes to large scale commercialization. In this work, we report the synthesis of a trimetallic metal-organic framework based on Ni, Co and Zn using BTC as a linker and the preparation of its metal oxide - carbon composites at different temperatures, 600, 700 and 800 degrees C (TM-MOF-600, TM-MOF-700, and TM-MOF-800) by carbonization under an inert atmosphere. The PXRD pattern of TM-MOF complemented well with the simulated XRD patterns of Co-Ni-BTC MOF as well as Zn-BTC MOF, whereas the PXRD pattern of the carbonized samples indicated the presence of three types of metal oxides i.e., CoO, NiO, and ZnO. TEM indicated spherical morphology of TM-MOF, upon calcination, an irregular agglomeration occurred and the average particle size was found to be 60-110 nm. The as-prepared TM-MOF and its carbon composites were tested for their electrocatalytic as well as catalytic activities towards oxygen evolution, urea oxidation and 4-nitrophenol reduction reactions. Electrochemical results indicate the better performance of TM-MOF-800 in both OER and UOR reactions with an onset potential of 1.66 V (OER) and 1.37 V (UOR) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The long-term stability of these catalysts under alkaline conditions indicates excellent stability. Besides, the urea electrolyzed products were analyzed by gas chromatography to get clear insights on the formed products. Catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol in the presence of excess NaBH4 showed excellent conversion to 4-amino phenol in short duration. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, we have studied the aqueous photocatalytic mineralization of benzene in anaerobic conditions using (TiO2)-O-18 as the photocatalyst. The reaction evolution has been followed by analysis of the concentration and the isotopic composition of CO2, the final product of benzene photooxidation. The unique features of this experimental system provide the opportunity for in situ tracing of the fate of >O-s(2-) or >OHs- species during the photocatalytic reaction. Experimental evidence shows that those oxygen atoms are incorporated into CO2. Participation of surface-trapped holes (-OHs center dot/-O-s(center dot-)) and the incorporation of surface oxygens into the oxidation products prove the main role played by those species in TiO2-assisted photocatalytic processes.

J	Antil, Bindu; Kumar, Lakshya; Das, Manash R.; Deka, Sasanka								Incorporating NiCoP Cocatalyst into Hollow Rings of ZnCo-Metal-Organic Frameworks to Deliver Pt Cocatalyst like Visible Light Driven Hydrogen Evolution Activity								ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS											10.1021/acsaem.2c01716		AUG 2022			2022	In the field of photocatalysis, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as potential photocatalysts owing to their well-defined and tailorable porous structures, high surface areas, and inherent semiconductor-like behavior. However, their photocatalytic H-2 evolution reaction is still limited due to the higher charge recombination rates. Precious metal cocatalysts, such as Pt and Au, are used to suppress electron-hole recombination effects by forming a Schottky junction, but the high cost and scarcity of these metals limit their large-scale applications. Herein, for the first time, we have developed novel ZnCo-MOF hollow rings at room temperature and loaded it with monodispersed transition-metal phosphide (TMPs; NiCoP, FeCoP, Ni2P, CoP) nanoparticles as non-noble-metal cocatalysts for efficient visible light driven H-2 evolution reaction. The as-obtained NiCoP@ZnCo-MOF composite displays significantly improved H-2 production rates as compared to the parent MOF and their physical mixture and offers similar photocatalytic H-2 evolution activity as compared to that of Pt@ZnCo-MOF. This is attributed to efficient n-n heterojunction charge separation and transfer, and rapid H-2 evolution reaction dynamics by the reduction of activation energy by NiCoP cocatalyst. The H-2 production rate of NiCoP@ZnCo-MOF is 8583.4 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), 16 times higher than parent ZCM, and the apparent quantum yield (AQY) is 20.1% at 590 nm, which remained constant for a minimum of 18 h of repeated cycling in the H-2 production without any degradation of the catalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000874854400001

Herein, we reported a well-defined nanostructured catalyst of highly dispersed CuAg@Ag coreshell nanoparticle (NP)-encapsulated nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets (CuAg@Ag/N-GNS) exhibiting a superior catalytic activity toward ORR in alkaline medium. The synergistic effects produced from the unique properties of CuAg@Ag core-shell NPs and N-GNS made such a novel nanohybrid display a catalytic behavior comparable to that of the commercial Pt/C product. In particular, it demonstrated a much better stability and methanol tolerance than Pt/C under the same conditions. Because of its outstanding electrochemical performance and ease of synthesis, CuAg@Ag/N-GNS material was expected to be a promising low-cost catalyst for ORR in alkaline fuel cell applications.									57	0	0	0	3	0	57			1944-8244			WOS:000424851600033	29336546

Meanwhile, the excellent properties oxidation resistance, creep strength and tensile strength at the elevated temperature make the high Nb containing TiAl alloys be one of the promising development directions of future TiAl alloys. During the studies about alloying which is an efficient way to improve the performance of TiAl alloys, researchers have found that interstitial atoms B, C and N notably refine the grains and then improve mechanical properties including yield strength, micro-hardness, and tensile ductility of TiAl alloys. During the melting, casting, forging and the application environment, the TiAl alloys also are always inevitable to be contaminated by the O. In this work, the high Nb containing Ti-46Al-8Nb-xO alloys (atomic fraction) were prepared by non-consumable vacuum arc remelting under the protection of Ar atmosphere. The aim of the present work is to study the influence and the corresponding mechanism of oxygen atoms on the microstructure evolution and phase transformation of high Nb-TiAl alloys. The results indicate that oxygen atoms in Ti-46Al-8Nb-xO alloys remarkably increase the amount of alpha(2) phase. The increasing oxygen content leads to the grain refinement. Meanwhile, the duplex microstructures translate into fully lamellar. It indicates that the interstitial oxygen essentially reduces the kinetics of alpha -> gamma. Consequently, the fully lamellar is easier formation than the duplex microstructures. It is found that interstitial oxygen atoms preserve significantly influence on the microstructure of Ti-46Al-8Nb-xO alloys. With the increase of oxygen content, the beta solidification translates into alpha solidification and the peritectic reaction alpha+L -> gamma moves to a lower Al content. At the same time, the eutectoid reaction alpha -> alpha(2)+gamma shifts to a higher Al content which extends the area of alpha phase. The DSC results show the effect of oxygen on the phase transformation of Ti-46Al-8Nb. The DSC curves indicate that the addition of oxygen increases the eutectoid reaction temperature of Ti-46Al-8Nb-xO alloys, but this effect can be gradually reduced with the further increase of oxygen content.									1	2	0	0	0	0	2			0412-1961			WOS:000327105300015

Rotating disk electrode (RDE) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used for electrochemical characterization, and the results of the analysis were compared with pure nickel catalysts. Three different deposition times were used to obtain different ruthenium loads and to analyze their impact on the electrocatalytic activity. Kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the reaction were obtained for freshly synthesized catalysts, and also for catalysts aged using a short chronoamperometric procedure. The presence of ruthenium was found to shift the reaction onset potential up to about 160 mV to lower overpotentials comparing with pure nickel, which not increases after ageing, showing a substantial improvement in catalytic activity. Results of Tafel and Koutecky-Levich (K-L) analysis have shown that the HER rate determining step is the Volmer reaction with Langmuir type adsorption for both, Ni/Ru fresh and aged catalysts.

First, we studied the effect of carbon (C) and tin (Sn) isovalent dopants on the aggregation kinetics of oxygen. It is determined that the reduction rate of oxygen is described by the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami equation in accordance with previous reports. The activation energy related with the reaction rate constant of the process is calculated to increase from Cz-Si, to C-doped Cz-Si (CCz-Si), to Sn-doped Cz-Si contained C (SnCz-Si). This is attributed to the presence of the isovalent dopants that may impact both the kinetics of the oxygen atoms and also may lead to the formation of other oxygen-related clusters. Second, we studied the effect of Sn on the formation and evolution of carbon-oxygen (C-O) defects. It was determined that the presence of Sn suppresses the formation of the C-O defects as indicated by the reduction in the strength of the 683, 626, and 586 cm(-1) well-known bands of CsOi defect. The phenomenon is attributed to the association of Sn with C atoms that may prevent the pairing of O with C. Third, we investigated the effect of C and Sn on the formation of thermal donors (TDs). Regarding carbon our results verified previous reports that carbon suppresses the formation of TDs. Interestingly, when both C and Sn are present in Si, very weak bands of TDs were observed, although it is known that Sn alone suppress their formation. This may be attributed to the competing strains of C and Sn in the Si lattice. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0021-8979	1089-7550		WOS:000357873100038

Polymerization with L-cysteine as an additional organic precursor produces an ACP sheath around the carbon nanotube (CNT)-graphene (GR) hybrid support made of a small domain size with abundant edge sites and doped with sulfur. A few-minute-long microwave pyrolysis anchors strongly the single-atomic M-N moiety on the ACP while suppressing its agglomeration during the high-temperature synthesis and makes the ACP highly graphitized. As a typical example, the edge-hosted single-atomic catalytic sites in Fe-N/S-CNT-GR provide superior pH-independent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity to previously reported Fe-N-C catalysts and commercial Pt/C while demonstrating oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity in basic conditions similar to known state-of-the-art catalysts. In particular, the Fe-N/S-CNT-GR catalyst is much more stable than commercial Pt/C and Ir/C catalysts during ORR and OER in both base and acid solutions. Inferior stability is a common problem of this type of single-atom heterogeneous catalyst (SAC). An aqueous Zn-air battery with our Fe-N/S-CNT-GR catalyst operates as effectively as the device with the commercial Pt/C-Ir/C catalysts. We believe that our protocol based on the molecularly engineered ACP and microwave pyrolysis can provide a new concept to synthesize a new generation of durable SACs, which could have broad applications in electrochemical energy conversion and storage.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000819486300001

A stable semi-transparent ITO/Au/ITO hole conducting oxide layer, sandwiched between the OER catalyst and the Si photoanode, is used to protect the Si from corrosion in an alkaline working environment, enhance the hole transportation, and provide a preactivation contact to the NiOx catalyst. The NiOx catalyzed Si photoanode generates a photocurrent of 1.98 mA cm(-2) at the equilibrium water oxidation potential (E-OER = 0.415 V vs. NHE in 1 M NaOH solution). A thermodynamic solar-to-oxygen conversion efficiency (SOCE) of 0.07% under 0.51-sun illumination is observed. The successful development of a low cost, highly efficient, and stable photoelectrochemical electrode based on earth abundant elements is essential for the realization of a large-scale practical solar fuel conversion.									49	1	0	0	5	0	49			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000332393200021	24458088

By sodium dodecy sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide analyses assisted by immuno-detection, we demonstrated the degradation of PSII proteins under hydrogen-producing conditions, which first gives rise to the loss of oxygen evolution followed by the loss of the reaction center in PSII. It was also found by fluorescence analyses that these changes are preceded by functional dissociation of PSI from PSII as expressed by the loss of excitation energy transfer between the two photosystems. These results are sustained by the action spectrum for hydrogen production, the major contribution of PSI as the photoreceptor for light-dependent hydrogen production by Lynbya cells.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0002-1369			WOS:A1991FA19000001

The as-fabricated SnS/SnS2 film achieves high efficiency toward UOR with a lower potential of 1.38 V vs RHE to deliver 50 mA cm(-2), which is approximately 200 mV less than the potential demanded for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). More importantly, the electrolyzer consisting of two identical electrodes with the SnS/SnS2/NF || SnS/SnS2/NF vs RHE assembly oxidizes urea at a lower potential of 1.36, 1.38, and 1.39 V vs RHE to deliver a current density of 10, 50, and 100 mAcm(-2), respectively. The superior UOR performance of the SnS/SnS2-based electrode is attributed to the combined merits of the SnS and SnS2 phases in the heterostructure, enhancing the catalytic active sites and providing the easy charge transport between the electrode and electrolyte.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000807306300001

Thus, enhancing the OER performance and understanding the mechanism are critically important. Herein, we report a strategy for OER enhancement by utilizing gold nanoclusters to form cluster/CoSe2 composites; the latter exhibit largely enhanced OER activity in alkaline solutions. The Au-25/CoSe2 composite affords a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at small overpotential of, similar to 0.43 V (cf. CoSe2: similar to 0.52 V). The ligand and gold cluster size can also tune the catalytic performance of the composites. Based upon XPS analysis and DFT simulations, we attribute the activity enhancement to electronic interactions between nanocluster and CoSe2, which favors the formation of the important intermediate (OOH) as well as the desorption of oxygen molecules over Au-11/CoSe2 composites in the process of water oxidation. Such an atomic level understanding may provide some guidelines for design of OER catalysts.									218	13	0	0	15	0	222			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000393541000014	28068082

Herein, a typical supported gold-based catalyst (Au@TiO2-x/ZnO) was obtained via a structural topotactic transformation from hydrotalcite precursors, exhibiting an extremely high catalytic performance towards LT-WGSR. A series of experimental measurements involving in situ/operando DRIFTS, in situ Pulse-MASS and in situ/operando EXAFS as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to monitor the dynamic evolution of active sites, detect reaction intermediates and identify the reaction route. A new redox reaction route derived from the interfacial synergistic catalysis was verified: one H2O molecule undergoes dissociation at an Au delta--O-v-Ti3+ (O-v: oxygen vacancy) interfacial active site, accompanied with the production of one H-2 molecule and the oxidation of the interfacial structure to Au-0-O-r-Ti4+ (O-r: the interfacial reactive oxygen species). Subsequently, one chemisorbed CO molecule captures O-r to produce CO2 with the recovery of Au delta--O-v-Ti3+. The present understanding and identification of the reaction mechanism of LT-WGSR would offer inspiration for further material exploration and catalyst design in gold-based heterogeneous catalysis.									5	1	0	0	0	0	6			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000514293400014

Replacing noble metal-based electrocatalysts by highly efficient and inexpensive non-noble metal based catalysts is critical for the practical application of these technologies. Here we report a novel hybrid of nitrogen-doped carbon shell coated CoP nanocrystals encapsulated in porous nitrogen-doped carbon substrate (CoP/PNC), which is synthesized through sol-gel and consequent pyrolysis-oxidation-phosphorization method. The obtained CoP/PNC exhibits promising electrocatalytic performance toward HER and OER due to the synergistic effect between N-doped carbon and CoP nanocrystals. When the CoP/PNC catalyst is applied in a two-electrode water splitting device, the cell potential at 10 mA cm(-2) could be as low as 1.68 V. Besides, it still remains current retention of 78.7% after continuous run for 24 h. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									79	2	0	0	3	0	80			0008-6223	1873-3891		WOS:000459991900052

Alteration of the lipid phase fluidity was achieved by incorporation of the plant sterol stigmasterol. Incorporation of stigmasterol in the lipid bilayer of thylakoid membranes results in rigidization of the hydrophobic phase of thylakoid membranes and decreases the degree of packing of the lipid head groups. These changes of lipid order are accompanied by a reduction of oxygen evolution, measured with 1,4-benzoquinone as an electron acceptor, and by a more pronounced inhibition of PSI-mediated electron transport. By analysis of the parameters of oxygen flash yields and oxygen burst under continuous illumination it was shown that after treatment with stigmasterol: 1.) the number of active oxygen-evolving centres decreased; 2.) the remaining active oxygen-evolving centres were not affected in respect to the oscillation pattern; 3.) the contribution of the slow oxygen-evolving centres in oxygen burst yield was increased. The effect of stigmasterol was compared with the well-studied effect of cholesterol. Results were discussed in terms of determining the role of lipid order for the organization and functioning of the photosynthetic machinery.									12	0	0	0	12	0	13			0939-5075	1865-7125		WOS:000246139000016	17542493

The oxygen reduction reaction is the cornerstone of both fuel cells and zinc-air batteries (ZABs). Herein, as a proof-of-concept application, the activated CTP (ACTP) first used as carbon source through cobalt/nitrogen reengineering is demonstrated to be an effective and straightforward strategy for fabrication of high-performing hierarchical porous carbons (Co/N-HPCs). The as-prepared Co/N-HPC150/800 with a large specific surface area of 2076.58 m(2) g(-1) exhibits superior electrocatalytic properties for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in terms of a half-wave potential of 0.85 V (vs RHE) for ORR and an onset potential of 1.42 V (vs RHE) for OER, respectively, in 0.1 M KOH, superior to commercial Pt/C catalyst. Notably, we have experimentally shown that Co/N-HP150/800 as the air electrode for zinc-air battery demonstrates a high discharge peak power density achieving 425 mW cm(-2), a current density of 291 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1 V, and a long cycling stability beyond 250 h at 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the obtained rechargeable Zn-air battery exhibits a low discharge-charge voltage gap and long cycle life (2100 cycles with 10 min per cycle). The outstanding electrocatalytic properties are attributed to the unique hierarchical pore structures as well as coupling effects originated from cobalt doping and trace nitrogen-containing active sites from aqueous ammonia, which largely facilitates the charge transfer and enhances the stability of rechargeable ZABs. It opens a new and viable way for realizing the high value-added utilization of CTP.									23	6	0	0	0	0	24			2168-0485			WOS:000467351200061

Potential relaxation transients, following anodic current interruptions, and a.c. frequency response measurements have been used to derive information on the adsorption behaviour of the intermediates in relation to the steady-state polarization behaviour of the two ''allotropic'' forms of PbO2. Significant differences in the kinetic behaviour of 02 evolution and of the adsorbed intermediate species are found. The characterization of 02 evolution behaviour on lead dioxides is of practical relevance to the anodic processes that take place during overcharge of the positive plates of lead-acid batteries.									69	13	0	0	3	2	72			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:A1994NC47200016

The resulting HO-nps can be used directly, or washed and isolated without loss of activity. The Ni1xFex HO-nps are outstandingly active and stable toward the water oxidation reaction (WOR) in base. The Ni0.75Fe0.25 HO-np was the most active mass-normalized WOR catalyst in the series, with onset overpotential = 190 mV, Tafel slope = 24 mV dec(1), overpotential at 10 mA cm(2) = 234 mV, and loadings Ni + Fe = 0.135 mg cm(2). The catalysts were robust under long-term galvanostatic and duty-cycle testing. The Ni0.75Fe0.25 HO-np catalyst has a layered double hydroxide structure, and it appears that Fe enhances the activity of Ni toward the WOR by decreasing its electron density.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			2168-0485			WOS:000391246000126

Reactive dispersion is illustrated with a one-dimensional finite difference model for coupled heat flow, fluid flow, mineral reaction, and oxygen isotopic exchange during contact metamorphism of siliceous dolomite. Infiltration-driven decarbonation reactions impart isotopic heterogeneity to an initially homogeneous system. The effect on fluid composition is explored using a breakthrough curve that tracks fluid composition through time. The corresponding effects on rock composition an illustrated with plots of isotopic alteration vs, distance. Reactive dispersion is especially efficient during infiltration of H2O into carbonate racks because O-18 is strongly fractionated between CO2 and H2O and because mineral reactions may buffer the CO2-H2O content of fluid. The spatially heterogeneous isotopic alteration predicted to develop during decarbonation reactions in a homogeneous protolith is similar in magnitude and distribution to that observed downstream of the isotopic depletion front in contact metamorphic aureoles.

Results show that the standard formation Gibbs free energy of bulk Li3O4 is marginally higher than that of Li2O2, but the surface energy of Li3O4 is much lower. Low surface energy results in both lowered nucleation energy and formation Gibbs free energy in the nanometer regime, allowing the Li3O4 nano particles to nucleate ahead of Li2O2 during the discharge process and to exist stably when particle sizes are smaller than about 40 nm. The scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image of Li3O4 crystals is simulated and compared with the measured STEM image of the discharge product particles. The consistency between the simulated and measured STEM images suggests that the Li3O4 phase can exist stably as a discharge product. The energy profile of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring on the most abundant surfaces of Li3O4 is also calculated. The predicted overpotential for the OER on the {0001} surface (0.30 V) shows a good agreement with experimental data. The presence of more electronically conductive Li3O4 nano particles in the primary discharge product Li2O2 tends to decrease the charge overvoltage of the batteries, explaining why the lower voltage area (<3.5 V) was widely observed during the charging of the batteries. An increase in the oxygen pressure or a decrease in temperature enhances the stability of the Li3O4 phase and increase the proportion of the Li3O4 phase in the discharge products, consequently leading to a lower overall charge overvoltage.									22	1	0	0	2	0	23			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000364639700047	26486991

Herein, we present a combined experimental and theoretical study on water oxidation catalysis of mononuclear Co catalysts with CoN4Cl, CoCN3Cl, and CoC4Cl motifs incorporated into a graphene matrix. We found that the catalyst with the CoCN3Cl structure exhibits an overpotential of 359 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), much lower than those of catalysts with CoC4Cl (396 mV) and CoN4Cl structure (>500 mV). By introducing the binding strength between the Co site and reaction intermediates (OH*, O* and OOH*) as the reaction descriptor, we revealed that the binding strength for Co = O* in these structures is getting stronger when N is replaced by the C atom, which plays a crucial role in the rate-determining step (RDS) and water oxidation performance. The Co site distinctively coordinated with the CN3Cl structure gives rise to the most suitable binding strength of Co = O* and consequently the highest OER performance (RDS: Co-OH* -> Co = O*), much better than that coordinated by C4Cl with a strong binding strength (RDS: Co = O* -> Co-OOH*) and N4Cl with a weak binding strength (RDS: Co-OH* -> Co = O*). This work further demonstrates the importance of the coordination environment of the metal nucleus in catalysts for RDS manipulation and activity optimization in OER through modulating the binding strength between active site and reaction intermediates.									7	1	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000734041800001

Herein, we show that Co,N-codoped porous vanadium nitride (VCoN) nanoplates are successfully synthesized via a simple one-step pyrolysis protocol without the use of NH3 gas. We also demonstrate that the crystallization, surface chemical state and porosity of vanadium nitride are well modulated by inventively using Co dopants as structural inducers. The resulting VCoN material exhibits an excellent catalytic activity towards the HER in alkaline media, with an extremely low onset potential of -0.03 V, an overpotential of 179 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and a remarkable durability for over 100 h. Moreover, it shows a superior ORR performance, which compares favorably with commercial 20% Pt/C, exhibiting an onset potential of similar to 1.02 V, a half-wave potential of similar to 0.91 V and a weak potential shift (-5 mV) after 2000 cycles at 1600 rpm in 0.1 M KOH. Such excellent electrocatalytic performance primarily contributes to the unique structural features of the heteroatom N (pyrrolic and graphitic N) and Co codoping in favor of improving the electrical conductivity and the high porosity contributing to exposing numerous catalytic active sites.									33	3	0	0	1	0	35			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000472559800012	31165119

Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) with low-cost and high efficiency have been considered as one of the most promising non-noble-metal cocatalysts. Herein, a novel multiphase phosphide nanosheet, Fe2P/Ni3P cocatalyst, was target designed and in-situ incorporated with Cu2O nanocubes via a phosphorization method for photocatalytic H-2 evolution under visible light irradiation. The optimal Cu2O/Fe2P/Ni3P sample provided 10-folds higher photocatalytic activity of H-2 evolution rate (108.68 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) than that of single Cu2O (18.6 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)), which could be ascribed to fast charge transfer from the Cu2O to multiphase phosphide Fe2P/Ni3P cocatalyst and efficient separation of the light-induced charge carriers. Moreover, the Fe2P/Ni3P cocatalyst also improved the photo-corrosion of Cu2O caused by the disproportionation reaction, leading the Cu2O/Fe2P/Ni3P hybrid possessed robust stability. Additionally, this work guarantees useful insights in employing novel TMPs-based cocatalysts to construct visible-light-responsive photocatalysts, which manifests promising applications in the dwindling supply of energy.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000589646100001

New processes achieve higher yields with lower investment by operating in a net reducing environment where the oxygen concentration is lower than that required stoichiometrically to react all of the butane. In this paper, we examined a wide range of operating conditions to quantify the effect of a reducing environment on maleic anhydride selectivity, byproduct acid productivity, and reaction rates. The experiments were carried out with a vanadium phosphorus oxide catalyst in a fluidized-bed reactor and a novel feed gas manifold. Oxygen, carbon monoxide, butane, and acid concentrations were measured online at a frequency of about 1 Hz. Acetic and acrylic acids were the predominant byproduct acids, but fumaric, methacrylic, and phthalic acids were also detected. Under reducing conditions, carbon adsorbed on the catalyst surface, byproduct acid yields increased, and both the selectivity and reaction rates decreased. A redox kinetic model was developed to account for the experimental observations and included both V5+ and V4+ oxidation states and a "V-C4" complex, which represented carbon adsorption.									39	0	0	0	1	1	39			0888-5885			WOS:000187442400008

Herein, a nickel-iron-chromium compound/stainless steel foil (NICC/SSF) electrocatalyst with a novel flower-like nanostructure is synthesized by a one-step cathodic electrodeposition method with a sacrificial anode. The as-fabricated NICC/SSF electrode as an earth-abundant and high-efficiency bifunctional electrocatalyst exhibits favorable electrocatalytic performance toward the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline solutions and specifically requires only small overpotentials of 85 mV and 274 mV for attaining a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. The particular vegetative flower-like nanostructures with highly conductive flocculent clusters could promote sufficient exposure of active sites and optimize the electronic configuration, which is beneficial to facilitate the catalytic performance. In consideration of the well-defined bifunctionality, a full alkaline electrolyzer is constructed with two identical NICC/SSF electrodes. Notably, the NICC/SSF two-electrode electrolyzer for water splitting requires a low onset potential of similar to 1.56 V and a cell voltage of 1.60 to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is ascribed to the synergistic interactions between the metal species by metal-metal charge transfer. The presented strategy offers a facile approach for developing efficient, stable, and low-cost electrocatalysts for realizing large-scale water splitting.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2398-4902			WOS:000642591200001

Herein, we report, for the first time, heterostructural Co/CeO2/Co2P/CoP@NC dodecahedrons as bifunctional electrocatalyst, in which abundant interfaces are formed between different components. Typical ZIF-67 (ZIF = zeolitic imidazolate framework) dodecahedrons with pre-inserted CeO2 nanowires were selected as precursors to synthesize Co/CeO2/Co2P/CoP@NC via a direct carbonization process followed by phosphidation, simultaneously generating the strong coupled heterojunction interfaces through interactions between CeO2 and CoxP species. Abundant porous structure leads to the exposure of more active sites and the carbon encapsulation of nanodomains sustains the high robustness and conductivity and the synergistic effect between the multi-components heterostructure. Benefiting from the above collective advantages, the Co/CeO2/Co2P/CoP@NC electrocatalysts exhibit small overpotentials of 307 and 195 mV to derive 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER, respectively. Furthermore, an alkaline electrolyzer assembled by using Co/CeO2/Co2P/CoP@NC as both cathode and anode can achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low voltage of 1.76 V and work continuously for over 15 h. This work would provide a rational protocol for fabrication multi-phase interface enriched electrocatalysts toward highly efficient energy conversion. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

In these interactions, plants, as the stationary party, have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to sense, signal and respond to the presence of external stress agents. Chloroplasts are metabolically versatile organelles that carry out fundamental functions in determining appropriate immune reactions in plants. Besides photosynthesis, chloroplasts host key steps in the biosynthesis of amino acids, stress hormones and secondary metabolites, which have a great impact on resistance against pathogens and insect herbivores. Changes in chloroplast redox signalling pathways and reactive oxygen species metabolism also mediate local and systemic signals, which modulate plant resistance to light stress and disease. Moreover, interplay among chloroplastic signalling networks and plasma membrane receptor kinases is emerging as a key mechanism that modulates stress responses in plants. This review highlights the central role of chloroplasts in the signalling crosstalk that essentially determines the outcome of plant-pathogen interactions in plants.									46	0	1	0	40	0	47			0962-8436	1471-2970		WOS:000332468400014	24591720

In recent times, Pt-free electrocatalysts have been greatly attractive in electrochemical hydrogen evolution re-actions for the replacement of fossil fuels and development of sustainable energy carriers. Chemical vapor deposition method was used as an efficient way to synthesize CNTs directly. The as prepared free-standing and multifunctional CNT electrodes are used for overall water splitting applications. In this work, we have designed CNT as electrode material as well as current collector using Ni-foil and Ni-foam substrate and their fundamental characterizations confirm the structural, morphological behaviors of CNTs. Moreover, the well-ordered growth of CNT was obtained in Ni-foam CNTs 1 and 2, whereas in the Ni foil CNTs 1 and 2 less growth of CNT and amorphous carbon sponge was exceeded, which was further confirmed by the SEM images. The achieved elec-trochemical HER results displayed that the Ni-foam-CNT-2 exhibited lower overpotential, smallest Tafel slope and lower resistance value of 110 mV, 240 mV/dec and 0.24 omega respectively. Moreover, Ni-foam-CNT-2 revealed excellent stability with 86.6 % retention over 20 h. Hence, it is one of the cost-effective and reliable materials for electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000861213400005

In real operating conditions, the active sites could be subjected to various structural/chemical evolutions, as revealed recently by post-catalysis/in-situ characterizations. Insightful understanding suggests that multiple interactions between electric field, electrolyte, reactant/intermediate/resultant, and electrocatalyst increase the mutability of the electrocatalyst surfaces, triggering the surface evolution. Hence, the surface evolution causes the deviation of the initial design of active sites from the real ones. It calls for re-identification of active sites responsible for the observed activity and further provides more accurate guidelines for rational electrocatalytic design. This review reveals the origin of surface evolution, summarizes the general forms involving composition leaching, phase transformation, atom rearrangement, and metastable intermediate from typical electrocatalysts. It also proposes control strategies toward the formation or reservation of stable highly-active sites by atomic/defective modulation, interfacial coupling, structural optimization of presynthesis, and forming a protective layer. The active sites of typical electrocatalysts are identified and elucidated before and after the surface evolution. The current challenges in developing electrocatalysts addressing the definite structure-performance relationship, advanced characterization techniques, and strategies for more rigorous identification of real active sites after surface evolution are presented.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000634239600002

Control of the exposed crystallographic facets of catalysts is an efficient way of tailoring their activity, but the practicability and the investigation of the underlying mechanisms of this protocol still present challenges for Ni and its alloys. Herein, we succeeded in preparing Ni-Fe alloy nanoparticles (NPs) with different exposed facets via pyrolysis of Fe-substituted Ni-bispyrazolate metal-organic frameworks. Fe-doping induces divergent growth in the two kinds of NPs to afford separate (111)- and (200)-faceted NPs with distinguishable diameters. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to simulate the ORR process on the two facets of the Ni-Fe NPs, revealing that the (200)-faceted NPs show the highest activity due to their large compressive strain effect. The experimental results confirm the enhanced ORR activity of the derived catalysts and superior performance of assembled Zn-air batteries.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000670228000001

Perovskite-structured Ir-containing oxides (e.g., SrIrO3) are a family of striking electrocatalysts due to their high specific activity, but this excellent quality is difficultly transferred to a nano-electrocatalyst with large active surface and good structural stability. Here, we present a synthesis method that produces a 2D ultrathin {001}-faceted SrIrO3 perovskite (2D-SIO) with a thickness of similar to 5 nm and high surface area (57.6 m(2) g (1)). We show that 2D-SIO can serve as a highly active and stable electrocatalytic nanomaterial for OER under acidic conditions. This perovskite nanomaterial produces 10 mA cm (2) current density at a low overpotential (eta, 243 mV), and maintains its catalytic activity after 5000 continuous cyclic measurements. Besides ultrathin structure and large surface area, the exposed {001} facets are found to be the most crucial and unique structural factor for achieving high catalytic activity and structural stability. Our joint experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that these advantageous microstructural features of 2D-SIO endow it with a strong capability to generate the key O* intermediates, and thereby facilitate O-O bond formation and the OER.

In this work, platinum was used as a model catalyst, deposited on porous membranes with different pore size and shape. The O-2 evolution rate was monitored at the gaseous side of these breathable electrodes. We show that the hydrophobic Goretex (R) membrane electrodes provide a highly efficient removal of the gases, breathing out 92% of expected O-2 during water splitting, and thereby also largely avoiding the well known migration of oxygen to the cathode in the absence of a separator in the cell. The breathable structure is also shown to operate as a hydrogen electrode. The ability to separate the two gases, without the need for a separator, decreases gas cross-over and thereby enhances the coloumbic efficiency. Merging this approach with catalysts and photocatalysts of a variety of types e.g. non-precious metal and metal oxides will allow fabrication of cost efficient and straightforward water splitting devices.

J	Teng, Yun; Wen, Xishan; Hu, Shangmao; Cai, Hansheng; Lan, Lei; Lu, Hailiang					Teng, Yun/0000-0002-6674-5529			Effect of DC Deep-Well Ground Electrode Materials on gas Evolution								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY				37	3			1578	1587		10.1109/TPWRD.2021.3092637				JUN 2022	2022	The uniqueness of DC deep-well ground electrodes (DWGEs) lies in their low area requirements. However, the gas produced by DWGEs during electrolysis may cause more severe exhaust problems than those caused by conventional electrodes. To investigate the influence of different electrode materials on the gas evolution of DWGEs, an innovative U-shaped experimental platform is proposed for the separate collection of cathode and anode gases. The metal-electrolyte contact interface in a DWGE project was simulated, and gas evolution experiments were performed on three typical ground electrode materials. The gas evolution rates of the electrode materials when operate as cathodes and anodes were obtained. Polarization curves were used to compare the corrosion rates of the three materials and evaluate the effects of these rates on the gas evolution rates of the materials. The results revealed that when operated as anodes, mixed metal oxide (MMO) and high-silicon cast iron produced oxygen, whereas carbon steel did not. Furthermore, the evolution of O-2 in MMO was faster than that in high-silicon cast iron. When operated as cathodes, the three materials generated hydrogen, and carbon steel exhibited the slowest H-2 evolution rate. The current distribution in the different gas evolution processes was summarized. The supplied current was used as the reaction current of metal corrosion and for gas generation. Under the same current, quicker corrosion corresponded to a lower amount of gas evolution for a material.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0885-8977	1937-4208		WOS:000800228100026

Herein, carbon supported Co3Mo2OxN6-x was synthesized via a simple two-step approach wherein the reactants undergo refluxing and heat treatment in NH3. For the as-prepared Co3Mo2OxN6-x , catalyst, uniformly dispersed on XC-72, with the particle size averaged at 5 nm, the catalytic activities toward oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline media are related to the commercial Pt/C, such as the comparable onset potential (0.9 V vs RHE), half-wave potential (0.8 V vs RHE), and even higher specific activity (82.7 mA cm(-2) at 0.7 V). Significantly, the Co3Mo2OxN6-x catalyst was highly stable in terms of 95% current retention after 12 h chronoamperometry measurement, indicative of favorable prospect for the non-noble cathodic catalyst in alkaline fuel cell.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			1944-8244			WOS:000387095300040	27731631

Oxygen feeding strategies for methane ATR								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				47	21			11417	11427		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.12.252				MAR 8 2022	2022	The performance of different reactor designs for methane autothermal reforming (ATR) with diverse options of O-2 feeding is comparatively explored. The designs under consideration include a single bed reactor with O-2 feed at the inlet, multibed reactors in series with inter-bed oxygen injection, and a multitubular membrane reactor with O-2 feeding through the porous wall.The distribution of O-2 leads to low O-2 concentrations in the reaction mixture and less severe thermal conditions. The evolution of methane reforming and combustion reactions proceeds in parallel due to a suitable degree of reduction of the Ni catalyst. Particularly, the membrane reactor can produce H-2 in a more distributed way along the reactor. The leakage of O-2 at the membrane reactor outlet can be prevented with a final section of a non-porous wall. The modified membrane reactor demonstrates flexibility to carry out the methane ATR with lower temperatures without deterioration of H-2 yield.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

A NiCo-modified biomass carbon (milk as the carbon source)-based catalyst with a 3D structure is synthesized by using salt templates. The results show that 3D-C-NiCo (1:1) exhibits excellent MOR and UOR properties with a potential of 1.33 V vs. RHE and 1.35 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. MOR and UOR reactions not only can replace the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in consumption of electrolytic water but also can effectively degrade wastewater pollution rich in methanol and urea.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2073-4344		WOS:000677375400001

It is shown that self-ignition is of non-thermal nature, and the reaction begins on the reactor surface with generation of adsorbed chain carriers which subsequently escape into the volume with a velocity of similar to 50 m/s (20%SiH2O2+80%O-2, T=373 K, p(1)=6 Torr). Ignition ends with formation of inhomogeneities - clouds of SiO2 aerosol - in the volume. SF6 additions to the combustible mixture inhibit self-ignition and cause the concentration of SiO2 aerosol to decrease dramatically SF6 molecules presumably partake in a competing reaction of chain termination involving also charged species.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1074-1550			WOS:000075943200010

Currently, CO2 reduction to CO is relatively mature, whereas the deep reduction and further conversion of CO into multi-carbon products, such as ethylene (C2H4) and ethanol (C2H5OH), are highly challenging. Based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we explored the possibility of CO reduction reaction (CORR), to obtain C-2 products, with defective MXenes in which the defect is created by removing two neighboring oxygen atoms on the surface. Our results revealed that the dual-oxygen vacancy in defective Mo2TiC2O2 (labeled as Mo2TiC2O2-2O(V)) can offer a unique environment that confines and enriches the active *COH species, significantly promoting the reduction process as well as C-C bond coupling. The thermodynamic barrier of the potential-determining step (PDS) for Mo2TiC2O2-2O(V) is 0.32 eV with promising selectivity of C-2 products over the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This work provides a feasible strategy for designing MXene-based electrocatalysts for highly efficient CO2/CO reduction to C-2 products.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000653658800001	34031677

Contrary to popular belief, pristine g-C3N4 shows negligible, if any, enhancement in its electrochemical behaviour in this comprehensive study. Voltammetric analysis reveals g-C3N4 to display similar catalytic efficiency to the unmodified glassy carbon electrode surface on which the bulk material was deposited. This highlights the non-catalytic nature of the pristine material and challenges the feasibility of using g-C3N4 as a heterogeneous catalyst to deliver numerous promised applications.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000371145100007	26774082

Electrosynthesis is an economical and environmentally-friendly strategy to directly produce H2O2. Its practical production is hindered, however, by the lack of highly efficient and selective as well as low-cost electrocatalysts. Transition metal chalcogenide materials have been proved to be good catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction, but their selectivity towards conversion of O-2 to H2O2 remains unsatisfactory. In this work, 3 atomic-layer defect-rich CoSe2 nanosheets have been successfully grown on carbon cloth as a high performance electrocatalyst. The morphology of CoSe2 can be tuned by regulating the wettability of the growth substrate. The atomic-layer CoSe2 nanosheets showed unprecedented 92% selectivity towards H2O2 production in alkaline solutions, and the yields of H2O2 in alkaline and acidic solutions were 1227.7 mg L-1 h(-1) and 894 mg L-1 h(-1), respectively. The high efficiency and selectivity originate from the rich defects in the atomic-layer CoSe2 nanosheets, which can accelerate the adsorption of OOH by the exposed Co defect sites.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000693681100001

This study builds on the promising concept of oxide/metal nanocomposites, namely NiO/Ni, by incorporating another metal (in this case, Mo) into NiO to tune the adsorption energy of hydrogen (H). Theoretical and experimental approaches are combined to design Mo-NiO/Ni nano composites for efficient HER in alkaline media. The incorporation of Mo into NiO weakens the adsorption of H, favoring its transfer to nearby Ni active sites to accelerate the Volmer reaction, and also stabilizes the crystal structure of NiO. The Mo-NiO/Ni catalyst exhibits a 50 mV overpotential at a current density of -10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 86 mV dec(-1), indicating that it is one of the most promising alkaline HER electrocatalysts reported to date. These findings suggest design principles for inexpensive, efficient, and high-performance Earth-abundant HER catalysts.									76	5	0	0	8	0	76			2380-8195			WOS:000503114500031

Now, cobalt-nitrogen-doped chiral carbonaceous nanotubes (L/D-CCNTs-Co) are presented as efficient electrocatalysts for ORR. The chiral template, N-stearyl-L/D-glutamic acid, induces the self-assembly of well-arranged polypyrrole and the formation of ordered graphene carbon with helical structures at the molecular level after the pyrolysis process. Co was subsequently introduced through the post-synthesis method. The obtained L/D-CCNTs-Co exhibits superior ORR performance, including long-term stability and better methanol tolerance compared to achiral Co-doped carbon materials and commercial Pt/C. DFT calculations demonstrate that the charges on the twisted surface of L/D-CCNTs are widely separated; as a result the Co atoms are more exposed on the chiral CCNTs.

It is revealed that the highest overall catalytic activity is obtained with a suitable level of nonhomogeneity that is commensurate with the average property. The evolution of the binding energy distribution is described by the Fokker-Planck theory. Exponential decay of the catalytic activity is predicted theoretically and confirmed experimentally. The exponential decay shows one- or two stages, depending on the initial distribution properties.

Whereas, amorphous phases usually occurred on grain boundaries, which greatly hinders electron transfer and reduces the catalytic performance. Herein, a NiWSe@NF acicular nanowire electrode was fabricated by a simple hydrothermal strategy, affording outstanding activity and durability, requiring overpotentials of only 103 mV (HER) and 203 mV (OER) under 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Experimental studies and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the excellent catalytic activity is attributed to the interpenetrate structure, which eliminates the formation of amorphous phase and provides a high-speed channel for electron transmission. The crystal interpenetration on grain boundaries adjusts the electronic, promotes the intermediates adsorption and reduce reaction energy barrier. The super-hydrophilic arisen from crystal interpenetration would also reduce the adhesion of generated bubbles and avoid performance attenuation. This work provides a new perspective for the development of high-efficiency composite catalysts. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We herein propose adopting a solar-driven WGS process instead of traditional thermal catalysis, with the aim of greatly decreasing the energy consumption. Under light irradiation, the CuOx/Al2O3 delivers excellent catalytic activity (122 mu molg(cat)(-1)s(-1) of H-2 evolution and >95% of CO conversion) which is even more efficient than noble-metal-based catalysts (Au/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3). Importantly, this solar-driven WGS process costs no electric/thermal power but attains 1.1% of light-to-energy storage. The attractive performance of the solar-driven WGS reaction over CuOx/Al2O3 can be attributed to the combined photothermocatalysis and photocatalysis.									59	5	0	0	2	0	59			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000474804800026	30942941

ABPBI possesses abundant nitrogen, and pyrolysis of ABPBI is helpful to form graphene structure. CaCO(3)and its decomposition products CO(2)can promote the formation of interconnected hierarchical porous three-dimensional graphene, which possesses more defects and exposed active sites. Benefiting from the defective catalysis mechanism, rich defect catalysts are applied as electrode materials to enhance the catalytic performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Electrochemically, the half-wave potential (E-1/2) of Fe-3D-NG#800 is 0.84 V (vs. RHE), and the accelerated durability tests shows the E(1/2)of Fe-3D-NG#800 shifted by a 21 mV drop after cyclic voltammetry scanning for 5000 cycles.

Herein, a well-dispersed and superhydrophilic/superaerophobic MoS2 catalyst with uniform three-dimensional conductive networks have been prepared assisted with cellulose nanofiber (CNF) and carboxylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (cMWCNT). The resulted CNF/cMWCNT/MoS2 catalysts present a superhydrophilic/superaerophobic state with contact angles for water and bubble of 0 degrees and 154.1 degrees respectively. This structure effectively disperses MoS2 nanoparticles through uniform embeddedness and promotes gas-liquid mass transfer via wettability. Benefiting from these optimizations, the CNF/cMWCNT/MoS2 exhibits better HER performance and a low overpotential (154 mV @ 10 mA/cm2). Encourangingly, CNF/cMWCNT/MoS2 catalysts have a slight decay of 6.99 % at 10 mA/cm2 after 100 h, while the cMWCNT/MoS2 shows a decay of 35.83 %. This approach using natural CNF for well-dispersed catalysts provides a potential for high-performance HER electrode design.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0144-8617	1879-1344		WOS:000827278400007	35868744

Heteroatoms-doped carbon materials have attracted many interests, because the resulted dopants synergistic effect always brings about extraordinary electrocatalytic activities. Herein, a simple pyrolysis strategy of thiourea, phytic acid and graphene oxide was developed to prepare N, P and S tri-doped carbon nanosheets, featuring sheet structure with specific surface area of 479 m2 g-1 and sufficient dopants (3.78 at% N, 7.97 at% P, and 1.36 at% S). Benefiting from the dominated graphitic and pyridinic N moieties, as well as abundant P-C and S-C functional groups, all of which are desired active species for oxygen electrochemistry, the synthesized tri-doped carbon nanosheets exhibit superior oxygen reduction performance and enhanced oxygen evolution activity in alkaline electrolyte. As the air cathode electrocatalysts for rechargeable Zn-air batteries, the decreased charge-discharge potential gaps and robust cycling stability are observed, even superior to those of noble-metal Pt/C benchmarks. The interconnected porous architecture with high surface area, multiple active species, and significant electric conductivity capability are considered as main factors for the enhanced electrochemical activities of this tridoped carbon material.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0921-5107	1873-4944		WOS:000702850700001

Herein, directed electronic modulation of NiO nanoparticles was achieved by simple surface molecular modification with small organic molecules. By adjusting the electronic properties of modifying molecules, the local electronic structure was rationally tailored and a close electronic structure-activity relationship was discovered: the increasing electron-withdrawing modification readily decreased the electron density around surface Ni sites, accelerating the reaction kinetics and improving OER activity, and vice versa. Detailed investigation by operando Raman spectroelectrochemistry revealed that the electron-withdrawing modification facilitates the charge-transfer kinetics, stimulates the catalyst reconstruction, and promotes abundant high-valent gamma-NiOOH reactive species generation. The NiO-C(6)F(5)catalyst, with the optimized electronic environment, exhibited superior performance towards water oxidation. This work provides a well-designed and effective approach for heterogeneous catalyst fabrication under the molecular level.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000572174300001	32896049

Herein, a "trimurti" heterostructured cobalt-based hybrid is designed by a facile, one-step phosphorization of layered Co-hexamine metal-organic frameworks. The synergistic effect between cobalt phosphides (Co2P and CoP) and cobalt oxide significantly boosts the electrocatalytic activity of the oxygen redox reaction. Besides, the hierarchically porous structure promotes the accessibility of active species and smooth electron/reactant transportation. Due to these attributes, the as-developed electrocatalyst outperforms the state-of-art non-noble metal catalysts and even noble metal benchmarks with a half-wave potential of 0.86 V for the ORR and an overpotential of 0.37 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER. Furthermore, an appealing catalytic performance is also demonstrated in an assembled Zn-air battery, which displays a lower voltage gap of 0.86 V and improved cyclability of 202 h. This work not only affords a competitive bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst for Zn-air batteries but also highlights the synergetic effect from heterointerfaces in electrocatalysis.									50	4	0	0	2	0	53			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000536095500037

Taking the photooxidation of isopropanol (IPA) as a model reaction, the newly developed Fe@PCN-224 exhibits significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity, which is equivalent to an 8.9-fold improvement in acetone evolution rate and 9.3-fold enhancements in CO2 generation rate compared with the PCN-224. Mechanism investigation reveals that the presence of Fe(III) sites in the PCN-224 can not only greatly boost the electron-hole separation efficiency, but also effectively convert the in-situ photogenerated inactive H2O2 into reactive oxygen-related radicals via Fenton reactions to participate in the photocatalytic IPA oxidation. The enhanced photocatalytic activity for IPA oxidation is also observed over another Fe(111) implanted porphyrinic metal organic framework (Fe@PCN-222), suggesting the generality of this strategy.									77	5	0	0	12	0	79			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000424960700008

The growth and functionalization of the catalysts are done in a single thermal plasma reactor. The GNFs are first grown through the decomposition of methane in the thermal plasma volume followed by homogeneous nucleation of the nanoparticles in the well-controlled recombining plasma stream allowing the 2-dimensional evolution of the nanoparticle morphology. The precursor feeding conditions are then changed to liquid carbon disulphide in order to generate sulphur-based functional groups on the nanoparticles. The plasma conditions and carbon disulphide injection are varied, and samples with tuneable amount of sulphur between 4 and 28 at% are obtained. The functional groups generated include polythiophene polymer partly covering the GNFs, sulphur functionalities implemented directly on the graphitic structure, and traces of orthorhombic sulphur. The S-GNFs exhibit higher electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline medium for the samples containing the highest amounts of sulphur.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0272-4324	1572-8986		WOS:000399165200017

Their applications still suffer, however, from lack of effective air cathodes to achieve a stable and long cycle life. Herein, we report a nitrogen-doped carbon nanofiber (NCF) material derived from polypyrrole as air cathode for the non-aqueous Na-O-2 electrochemical system. Notably, Na-O-2 batteries with NCF as air cathode could achieve a low overpotential gap of 500 mV, a high specific capacity of 8554.7 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1), and excellent cyclic stability over 90 cycles with NaO2 as the discharge product. These excellent performances can be attributed to the combination of their highly conductive three-dimensional network structure, large surface area, and superior catalytic activity, obtained by incorporating nitrogen atoms into the carbon matrix, which can facilitate electron transportation, oxygen and electrolyte diffusion, and discharge product deposition and decomposition. Besides, density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that pyrrolic and pyridinic-N doping can effectively optimize the surface adsorption energy of the reactants and intermediate, which facilitate to achieve excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The results reported here can point the way to the rational design of electrocatalytic air cathodes for rechargeable Na-O-2 batteries.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000620328800001

Herein, we select two structurally well-defined polyoxometalates Na-5[(H3PtW6O24)-W-(IV)] (PtW6O24) and Na3K5[Pt-2((II))(W5O18)(2)] (Pt-2(W5O18)(2)) as the platinum oxide model to investigate the HER performance. Electrocatalytic experiments show the mass activities of PtW6O24/C and Pt-2(W5O18)(2)/C are 20.175Amg(-1) and 10.976Amg(-1) at 77mV, respectively, which are better than that of commercial 20% Pt/C (0.398Amg(-1)). The in situ synchrotron radiation experiments and DFT calculations suggest that the elongated Pt-O bond acts as the active site during the HER process, which can accelerate the coupling of proton and electron and the rapid release of H-2. This work complements the knowledge boundary of Pt-based electrocatalytic HER, and suggests another way to update the state-of-the-art electrocatalyst. While converting water to H-2 with a catalyst offers a renewable means to produce carbon-neutral fuels, understanding the catalytic active sites has proven challenging. Here, authors show a structurally well-defined model complex with Pt-O bonding to enable efficient H-2 evolution electrocatalysis.									106	10	0	0	10	0	109			2041-1723			WOS:000543967000013	31980657

Sr incorporation in the BaCoO3-delta lattice in the form of 2H-type Ba1-xSrxCoO3-delta (0 <= x <= 0.5) perovskites enhances both ORR and OER activities. A relatively low overpotential of 395 mV at 10 mA/cm(2), lower Tafel slope of 64.95 mV dec(-1), and good stability up to 500 cycles (10% reduction of current density and overpotential shift to a 0.04 V higher value) in a 0.1 M KOH electrolyte were obtained for the Ba0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta electrode. Incorporation of Sr in the BaCoO3-delta lattice decreases the Co-O-Co bond angle that results in a superior orbital overlap between Co(3d) and O(2p) orbitals and a decrease in lattice parameters that generates lower surface oxygen separation pathways and a large number of active sites on the (011) planes, making Ba0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta a superior catalyst with increased OER/ORR activity. The formation of oxygen-vacant CoO5 octahedra containing surface oxygen vacancies, the presence of Co(3+/4+ )valence states, and the superior overlap between O(2p)-Co(3d) bands (covalency increases) result in a higher electronic conductivity, a lower flat band potential, and improved OER and ORR activities. The key highlight of this work is the matching of the onset potential with the calculated flat band (E-fb) potential from the Mott-Schottky plot. The Mott-Schottky plot was utilized to calculate the flat band potential (E-fb) that indicates the basic information about the electrochemical interface potential between the electrode and the electrolyte, and in the case of Ba0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta, it matches very well with the onset potential for the OER activity of the catalyst.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000797931600022

The effective charge separation is attributed to the facet junction at the interface between two arbitrary anisotropic crystal planes. Theoretical estimation of the built-in potential at the facet junction can greatly improve understanding of the mechanism. This work employs density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate such potential at the (110)/(100) facet junction in SrTiO3 crystals. The formation of the facet junction is verified by a calculated work function difference between the (110) and (100) planes, which form p-type and n-type segments of the junction, respectively. The built-in potential is estimated at about 2.9 V. As a result, with the ultra high built-in potential, electrons and holes can effectively transfer to different anisotropic planes to complete both photo-oxidative and photo-reductive reactions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2046-2069		WOS:000654041100044	35480943

This paper reports the synthesis of a pair of novel cobalt-iron chalcogenides [Co0.8Fe0.2S2 and Co0.8Fe0.2Se2] with enhanced electro catalytic activities. These ternary metal chalcogenides were synthesized by a one-step template-free approach via a hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS)-assisted synthetic method. Transient photocurrent (TPC) studies and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of these materials showed free electron mobility. Their bifunctional activities were verified in both the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and in the electrochemical reduction of toxic inorganic heavy metal ions [Cr(vi)] in polluted water. The materials showed robust catalytic ability in the oxygen evolution reaction with minimum possible over potential (345 and 350 mV @ eta 10) as determined by linear sweep voltammetry and the lower Tafel values (52.4 and 84.5 mV dec(-1)) for Co0.8Fe0.2Se2 and Co0.8Fe0.2S2 respectively. Surprisingly, both the materials also showed an excellent activity towards electrochemical Cr(vi) reduction to Cr(iii). Besides the maximum current achieved for Co0.8Fe0.2S2, a minimum value for the Limit of detection (LOD) was obtained for Co0.8Fe0.2S2 (0.159 mu g L-1) compared to Co0.8Fe0.2Se2 (0.196 mu g L-1). We tested the durability of catalysts, the critical factor for the prolonged use of catalysts, through the recyclability measurements of these materials as catalysts. Both the catalysts presented outstanding durability and balanced electro catalytic activities for up to 1500 CV cycles, and chronoamperometry studies also confirmed exceptional stability. The enhanced catalytic activities of these materials are ascribed to the free electron movement, evidenced by the increased TPC measured and EIS. Therefore, the template-free synthesis of these electro catalysts containing non-noble metal illustrates the practical approach to develop such types of catalysts for multiple functions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2046-2069		WOS:000766255200001	35424756

Hydrolysis technology is one of the promising factors to generate clean energy production. Especially, electrochemical water splitting involves two half reactions, i.e., hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). OER is a four electron process and it possessed a slow kinetics and high overpotential. The aim of this study is to overcome the difficulties of energy consumption, and enhances its kinetic activity and also reduces its overpotential by doping agent. In this study, pristine and 5, 10% Ag-doped CdS nanostructures were synthesized via co-precipitation method. Interestingly, 10% Ag-doped CdS nanostructure exhibits 868.7 F/g specific capacitance at 10 mV/s scan rate. Its OER activity, ion diffusion process, and stability were investigated under the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and chronoamperometry (CA) studies. Ag plays a vital role to overcome the difficulties and it is noteworthy for water splitting applications.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2190-5509	2190-5517		WOS:000568499100001

ChemSusChem											10.1002/cssc.202201689				2022-Oct-24	2022	Solar water splitting by photovoltaic (PV)-electrolysis is a promising route for sustainable hydrogen production. However, multiple PV cells connected in series are generally required to fulfil the practical electrolytic voltages, which inevitably increases the system complexity and resistance. Decoupled water electrolysis for separate hydrogen and oxygen evolution needs smaller voltage to drive each half-reaction, which provides a feasibility to achieve the single PV cell driven water electrolysis. Herein, by introducing sodium nickelhexacyanoferrate (NaNiHCF) as the redox mediator, decoupled acid water electrolyzer and amphoteric water electrolyzer were respectively constructed. The required voltages for the hydrogen or oxygen evolution steps matched with the output voltages of the perovskite solar cell (PSC). Impressively, by combining one FAPbI 3 -based PSC (efficiency: 18.77%) with the decoupled amphoteric water electrolyzer, a solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of 14.4% was achieved, which outperformed previously reported PSCs driven water electrolysis cells.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1864-564X		MEDLINE:36279197	36279197

The structural confirmation of bimetal oxide formation was acquired by X-ray powder diffraction and Raman studies. The formation of microspheres combined via irregular nanosheets was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. Highly oriented NiCo2O4 microspheres yielded a high current density (258 mA/g) at 10 mV/s and low overpotential (224 V). The highly active electrode showed efficient electron transportation towards oxygen evolution reaction. Long-term stability over 16 h was achieved by the fabricated high-performance NiCo2O4 electrode. It is recommended that NiCo2O4 micro spheres obtained from 3:1 stoichiometry ratio of Ni and Co would lead to new electrocatalysts that give best performance than expensive catalysts used currently in the water oxidation process.

The aim of this experiment was to evaluate Ni2+-doped BaFe12O19 (BHF) as an OER electrocatalyst in an alkaline medium. BHF and Ni-doped BHF was synthesized through a low temperature coprecipitation technique followed by a calcination process at 750 degrees C for 4 h. Diffractograms of the BHF and the Ni-doped BHF indicated a single phase on the synthesized BHF and formed Fe2O3 impurities on the Ni-doped BHF. SEM images showed a homogenous plate-shaped particles in the BHF, while the Ni-doped BHF had larger inhomogeneous particles. Ni dopant increased OER electrocatalytic activity of BHF based on overpotential on specific current density. The Ni-doped BHF had comparable activity to some metallic oxides based on their overpotential values at specific current density value.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2391-5420			WOS:000515157300004

To obtain the high-performance electrocatalysts, a series of porous Co(3)O(4)samples derived from zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) are prepared by one-step annealing process at different temperature (350, 450, and 550 degrees C) under air atmosphere. Compared with the commercial Co3O4, the optimized sample Co(3)O(4)prepared at 450 degrees C (CO3O4/C-450) exhibits the lowest overpotential of 1.68 V and the highest half-wave potential of - 0.56 V because the porosity of as-prepared Co(3)O(4)provides abundant reactive sites. Moreover, the high discharge potential of 1.33 V and long cycle life of more than 100 h at 20 mA cm(-2)are achieved in ZABs with CO3O4/C-450 electrocatalyst, which are attributed to the better stability provided by the carbon coating.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1388-0764	1572-896X		WOS:000573260800001

When adding appreciate dose of thiourea in the electrospinning precursor, the average grain size of CoNi nanoparticles reduces from 19.4 to 10.2 nm by the steric barrier effect of thiourea. Meanwhile, thiourea controls the favorable growth of CoNi on the surface of CoNi@CNFs. The surface CoNi alloy content increases from 25.1 to 34.6 wt %. The refining and well-dispersed CoNi nanoparticles improve the graphitization degree of carbon sub-strates. Furthermore, Thiourea provides S doping in CoNi alloy as well as the S, N doping in carbon substrates. The evolution of the structure and composition of CoNi@CNFs catalyst boosts the electronical performances by effectively modulating the electronic structure of the active sites, enlarge the exposure of active sites, and facilitate the electron transfer and mass diffusion. As a result, the optimized CoNi@CNFs (Thu-1.0) shows remarkable low overpotential (116 mV, 10 mA cm-2@1.0 mol KOH), outstanding hydrogen production rate (24.5 mmol/h, 20 mA cm-2@1.0 mol KOH), and superior stability (7.8% overpotential enlargement after 5000 continuous linear voltammetric cycles), when used as a catalyst material for HER application.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Herein, PtNi nanodentrites (PtNi NDs) were facilely synthesized in oleylamine (OAm) by a one-pot solvothermal method, using melamine and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) as co-structure-directing agents. The obtained catalyst showed superior catalytic activity and enhanced durability for HER relative to commercial Pt/C, home-made PtNi3 nanocrystals (NCs) and Pt3Ni NCs both in alkaline and acidic media. The enhanced HER activities are attributed to bimetallic synergies and interface structures in PtNi NDs. This work provides an effective strategy to prepare highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts for HER. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We also controlled parameters such as oven temperature, air flow direction, velocity, thermal residence time, and tow size to optimize stabilization process for large tow carbon fibers. FTIR, elemental analyzer, density column, X-ray diffractometer were used to evaluate stabilization degree and chemical structural evolution during thermal stabilization. The oxidation process of PAN fibers makes cross-linking reaction more easier between intermolecular chains and enduces cyclization reaction of acrylonitrile. In addition, the degree of air diffusion into fibers affects the mechanical properties of the final carbon fiber. The carbon fiber with ca. 10% of oxygen content and 1.40 g/cm(3) of density showed the best mechanical properties with 2.5 GPa tensile strength and 214 GPa tensile modulus.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0379-153X			WOS:000389393600020

Here, we take the photocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as a case study and demonstrate the significance of subtle surface structures in altering the photooxidation functions of anatase and rutile TiO2 under aqueous environments. On the basis of our recent progresses in developing a solution simulation method and clarifying the photocatalytic OER process at rutile TiO2 (Nat. Catal. 2018, 1, 291-299), we successfully identified a complete OER mechanism at the water/anatase-TiO2(101) interface with an explicit involvement of photoholes/radicals and lattice oxygens. Kinetic analysis further revealed the leading reaction pathway varying with the concentration of surface-reaching photoholes (Ch+), as well as the most efficient way to boost the OER via enriching the Ch+ rather than lowering the reaction barriers (of water dissociation or O/O coupling). Anatase TiO2(101) generally shows poorer OER activity relative to the rutile TiO2(110) but much higher surface coverage of O-t(-) radicals under experimental conditions, rationalizing its good activity for photodegradation of organics. Such varied catalytic functions were found to be simply decided by the distance between two vicinal under-coordinated Ti cations on the surface that promotes or prohibits the key step of O/O coupling. These results not only provide essential understandings on the structure-function principles governing the photooxidation behaviors but also offer strategies to achieve efficient catalysis via matching proper surface structures with targeted reaction characteristics.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000821851900001

The results obtained were verified by batch electrolyses. Pure NaOH, KOH, and mixtures thereof were used as an anolyte. The motivation for this study is to understand in more detail the electrolysis process at which ferrate(VI) is electrochemically produced in situ in the solid form which is more suitable for practical utilization. A significant impact of the anolyte composition on the system behavior was indicated. It is related to the solubility of the anode dissolution products in the anolyte. It was concluded that the fast reaction kinetics in the transpassive potential region is connected with a deterioration of the ferrate(VI) synthesis efficiency. This is explained by the kinetic enhancement corresponding to the intensification of oxygen evolution as a parasitic reaction.					8th European Symposium on Electrochemical Engineering8th European Symposium on Electrochemical Engineering	AUG 24-28, 2008AUG 24-28, 2008		Prague, CZECH REPUBLICPrague, CZECH REPUBLIC	29	0	0	0	2	0	29			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000276505900015

However, the sluggish oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in air cathodes are obstacles to its flexible and rechargeable application. Herein, a strategy called MOF-on-MOF (MOF, metal-organic framework) is presented for the structural design of air cathodes, which creatively develops an efficient oxygen catalyst comprising hierarchical Co(3)O(4 )nanoparticles anchored in nitrogen-doped carbon nano-micro arrays on flexible carbon cloth (Co3O4@N-CNMAs/CC). This hierarchical and free-standing structure design guarantees high catalyst loading on air cathodes with multiple electrocatalytic activity sites, undoubtedly boosting reaction kinetics, and energy density of an all-solid-state zinc-air battery. The integrated Co3O4@N-CNMAs/CC cathode in an all-solid-state zinc-air battery exhibits a high open circuit potential of 1.461 V, a high capacity of 815 mAh g(-1) Zn at 1 mA cm(-2), a high energy density of 1010 Wh kg(-1) Zn, excellent cycling stability as well as outstanding mechanical flexibility, significantly outperforming the Pt/C-based cathode.

However, their unsatisfactory performance of crucial materials such as electrodes, catalysts and electrolytes are still the challenges hindering the technology's practical applications.

In this paper, the state-of-the-art development in lithium-CO2 battery key materials, components and device assembling along with functional and degradation mechanisms and mitigation strategies are comprehensively reviewed.

The fluctuation of steel chemistry gave rise to the transient evolution of inclusions during the mixing process. The formed Al2O3 in the steel can be hardly influenced by the addition of FeTi, while adding Al can effectively modify the TiOx-containing oxides to solid Al2O3. The formation of Al2O3-TiOx inclusions can be suppressed by increasing Al and lowering Ti in the steel. The alloying sequence of adding Ti after the Al addition is beneficial to improve the recovery of Ti. The one-point strong air absorption may cause the formation of the unwanted Al2O3-TiOx inclusions in Al-Ti-killed steels. The critical oxygen contents in the molten steel with varying Al and Ti concentrations were predicted to avoid the formation of Al2O3-TiOx inclusions and Ti loss.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			0301-9233	1743-2812		WOS:000442080500001

In the Li-free DMSO solution, O-2 is efficiently reduced to the superoxide, which forms an ion-pair with the tetrabutylammonium (TBA) cation and shows an excellent stability in DMSO. The adsorption of the superoxide on the gold electrode surface has been observed by an in situ SERS measurement. When the Li-ion is included in the DMSO, O-2 can be further electrochemically reduced to lithium peroxide (Li2O2) and deposited on the electrode surface, although a large amount of superoxide is still produced in the solution. The latter oxide shows a UV-vis absorption spectrum similar to that polarized in the Li-free DMSO solution, implying that Li-ions solvated by DMSO make ion-pairs with superoxide (denoted as LiO2) in solution. No evidence for the disproportionation reaction of LiO2 to Li2O2, one of the known reaction mechanisms proposed before, has been obtained in the bulk solution and on the electrode surface in the present study. The formation of Li2O2 is controlled by reaction kinetics and Li-ion diffusion. The Li2O2 thin-film is terminated at a certain film thickness on the electrode surface. On the basis of the quantitative analyses of the in situ spectroscopic observations, the partial yields for LiO2 and Li2O2 have been estimated to elucidate the mechanism for the ORR/OER processes. The present results are discussed in comparison to previous observations on porous carbon cathodes regarding the surface area, morphology, and three-phase interface on the electrode and solution interface.									107	3	0	0	4	0	107			1932-7447			WOS:000355891600016

Here, the novel polar SnO/BiOX (X = CI, Br, and I) bilayers are constructed with the advantages of narrow band gaps and photogenerated carriers' separations. The band gap of the bilayers can be tuned from 1.09 to 1.84 eV, remarkably improving the utilization of solar energy. The large difference in the effective masses and built-in electric field effectively hampers the fast recombination of photogenerated carriers, which greatly enhances the photocatalytic efficiency. Also, the type-II band alignment guarantees that the two half-reactions could occur at different surfaces. Moreover, the visible light optical absorption and suitable band alignment further confirm that the SnO/BiOX (X = Cl and Br) bilayer is a promising candidate for photocatalytic overall water splitting.									14	2	0	0	1	0	13			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000535175400008

However, it is severely limited by the undesirable chlorine oxidation reaction (ClOR) on the anode and the releasing toxic chlorine species, inducing anode corrosion and multiple pollutions to reduce the efficiency and sustainability of this technology. The effective way is to limit the overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) below 480 mV and thus suppress the ClOR. Herein, we demonstrate that nitrogen-doped carbon dots strongly coupled NiFe layered double hydroxide nanosheet arrays on Ni foam (N-CDs/NiFe-LDH/NF) can efficiently facilitate OER with an ultralow overpotential of 260 mV to deliver the geometric current density of 100 mA center dot cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of as low as 43.4 mV center dot dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH. More importantly, the N-CDs/NiFe-LDH/NF electrode at 100 mA center dot cm(-2) shows overpotentials of 285 and 273 mV, respectively, by utilizing 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M NaCl and 1.0 M KOH with 1.0 M NaCl as the simulated seawater, well avoid triggering ClOR. Notably, despite the complex environment of real seawater, N-CDs/NiFe-LDH/NF still effectively promotes alkaline seawater (1.0 M KOH + seawater) electrolysis with a lifetime longer than 50 and 20 h, respectively, in 1.0 M KOH and alkaline seawater electrolytes. The investigation result reveals that M-N-C bonding generated between N-CDs and NiFe-LDH intrinsically optimizes the charge transfer efficiency, further promoting the OER kinetics.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000803799000019

The NiFeMo prepared by simple one-step electrodeposition exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performances for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Meanwhile, the excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of NiFeMo can ensure the smooth progress of hydrogen production in the wastewater of varying urea concentration. The results show that Mo dopant has significant effects on HER performance of the NiFeMo. The excellent OER and UOR performance of the NiFeMo is derived from synergism of these three metals and the formation of active intermediates. This work provides a facile method to synthesize low-cost and high-performance electrocatalysts for urea electrolysis and water splitting, which may open up new opportunities for hydrogen production.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000639702900003

Herein we report the designed sytithesis of novel box-in-box nanocages (NCs) with different shell Compositions, namely, Co3O4/NiCo2O4 double-shelled nanocages (DSNCs). Uniform zeolitic imidazolate framework-67/Ni-Co layered double hydroxides yolk shelled structures are first synthesized and then transformed: into:). Co3O4/NiCO2O4 DSNCs by thermal annealing, in air. Importantly, this strategy can be easily extended to prepare other complex DSNCs. When,evaluated as electrodes for pseudocapacitors, the Co3O4/NiCo2O4 DSNCs show a high specific capacitance of 972 F g(-1) at a current density of 5 A g(-1) and excellent Stability with 92.5% capacitance retention after 12 000 cycles, superior to that of Co3O4 NCs with simple configuration and Co3O4/Co3O4 DSNCs. Besides, the Co3O4/NiCo2O4 DSNCs also exhibit much better electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction than Co3O4 NCs. The greatly improved electrochemical performance of Co3O4/NiCo2O4 DSNCs demonstrates the importance of rational design and synthesis of hollow structures with higher complexity.									890	33	0	0	47	0	906			0002-7863			WOS:000353931500054	25874888

Recently, introducing a nitrogen anion into 3d TMSs (N-TMSs) has been demonstrated as an effective common strategy to further improve their catalytic activity by precisely manipulating their electronic structure. However, the enhancement in the activity of the N-TMS catalysts sacrifices their stability. Herein, we present a novel strategy of dual tuning to simultaneously improve the activity and stability of TMS catalysts through nitrogen doping and carbon coating, using 3D nitrogen-doped and carbon-coated Ni3S2 nanoflake arrays grown on nickel foam (N-Ni3S2@C/NF) as a typical material. The as-prepared catalyst exhibited excellent activity for both HER and OER in 1 M KOH, as well as distinguished long-term durability (up to 140 h) even at a large current density of similar to 300 mA cm(-2). The systematic experimental results reveal that the introduction of a N dopant would be beneficial for accelerating charge transfer, increasing active sites and improving intrinsic activity, whereas the amorphous carbon shell is primarily responsible for the corrosion resistance and structure stability. Finally, the electrolytic cell which consisted of N-Ni3S2@C/NF as both the cathode and anode only needs a very low voltage of 1.57 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is comparable to that of its Pt/C||IrO2 counterpart. This work provides a new strategy to design a high-performance bifunctional water-splitting electrocatalyst with both excellent catalytic activity and stability.									24	1	0	0	1	0	24			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000471908600007

This has motivated us to explore the performance of carbon functionalized with metal and electropositive phosphorous. Herein, we present the first report on the synthesis of a new class of electroactive Fe-and P-functionalized graphene (GPFe) and its electrocatalytic properties in alkaline and acidic media. The introduction of Fe causes remarkable synergistic effects on P-doped reduced graphene oxide by increasing surface area, enhancing the P doping level due to the interaction between Fe and P and generating electrochemically active Fe-P species. N-oxides are known to be in-active for ORR in Fe-N systems, whereas in present Fe-P systems, oxides of Fe and P are found to be beneficial for ORR. Interestingly, after the introduction of Fe, mostly inactive P-doped carbon becomes active in acidic medium. We propose that this study will surely provide renewed insights into active sites for ORR in metal and heteroatom-doped carbon systems.									78	4	0	0	5	0	80			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000354395400051

Insight into the roles of reactive sites in nanomaterials is significant for understanding and implementing the design principles of nanocatalysts. Recently, the essential role of defects, including vacancies, reconstructed defects, and doped non-metal (or metal)-defect-based motifs, have been widely demonstrated to promote the diverse electrochemical processes (e.g., O-2 [or CO2] reduction reactions and H-2 [or O-2] evolution reactions). Nevertheless, the in-depth exploration of the underlying defect electrocatalytic mechanism is still in its infancy. This review summarizes the state-of-the-art defect engineering strategies for designing highly efficient electrochemical nanocatalysts with special emphasis on the correlation between defect structures and electrocatalytic properties. Finally, some perspectives on the challenges and future research directions in this promising area are presented.									172	21	0	0	14	0	175			2451-9294			WOS:000476610100009

Desalinating seawater generally produces brine as a by-product that cannot be purified economically with current technologies and which is instead released to the environment. In this Perspective, we discuss direct electrosynthesis of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) from sea-water desalination brine as an emerging alternative solution. In this direct electrosynthesis (DE) process, the water splitting reaction is used to produce H+ and OH-, which combine with the brine stream to produce NaOH and HCl. After introducing the scope of the process, we describe developments in earth-abundant catalysts for water splitting and the competing chlorine evolution reaction (CER), as well as challenges in inefficiency and productivity associated with these processes. Finally, we discuss the economic impact and feasibility of direct electrosynthesis.									40	0	0	0	7	0	40			2520-1158			WOS:000458554800005

As well-known, the whole water-splitting process consists of two parts, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for water oxidation and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for proton reduction, occurring at (photo)anode and (photo)cathode, respectively. Water oxidation reaction is the key rate-determining step in water splitting for its four electrons transfer period. So the assembly of efficient and stable photoanode is an essential part of DS-PECs. Herein, we summarize the recent developments of photoanodes based dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells (PA-DS-PECs) with a focus on their design, assembly, and performance. Based on the results discussed, the current challenges are briefly presented and several future opportunities are proposed.

However, the mechanism of the photoprotection still remains to be further elucidated. In this work, we cloned a point mutated gene reported to encode a CRTISO which is responsible for the accumulation of lutein in rice mutant zel1 by a map-based cloning approach. The mutant phenotype was rescued by transformation with the corresponding gene of the wild type (WT). The activity of photosynthetic oxygen evolution was evidently suppressed in zel1. The amount of the core protein of PS II CP47 was much lower in all the PS II complexes especially in the LHCII-PS II supercomplexes and CP43-free PS II of zel1 than that of WT. On the other hand, the amount of another core protein of PS II CP43 of zel1 was decreased in the higher supercomplexes, whereas it was increased in the lower ones and PS II monomer. The immunodetection displayed that CP43, CP47, and the oxygen-evolving extrinsic proteins PsbO and PsbP were reduced, but the amount of reaction center protein D1 did not show significant change in zel1. Northern blot analysis showed that the transcriptional level of CP43 was down-regulated but not that of CP47 or D1 in zel1. In addition, the plastoquinone (PQ) Q(A) was in a reduced state in zel1. On the basis of the results, we suggest that CRTISO might function in regulating the transcription of CP43 and the translation of CP47 by affecting the redox state of the PQ to stabilize the extrinsic proteins of oxygen evolution complexes in the rice plant.									17	2	0	0	17	0	18			1672-9145	1745-7270		WOS:000279475200004	20705584

Geometric engineering has been proven effective for improving the MOR and ORR activities. Thus, by modulating the Pt precursor and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) dosages, different porous PtCu nanotubes constructed by hollow nanospheres, solid alloy, and Pt-rich skinned nanoparticles, respectively, are successfully synthesized. Among them, the solid PtCu alloy nanoparticle coherent nanotubes exhibit the specific activity 9.42 times higher than Pt/C toward MOR, while the hollow PtCu alloy nanosphere coherent nanotubes show the specific activity 4.85 times higher than Pt/C toward ORR. The different Pt:Cu ratios of hollow nanospheres, solid alloy, and Pt-rich skinned nanoparticles cause the differences in electron transfer from Cu to Pt as well as electronic structures of Pt. As a result, the binding energies of intermediates can be regulated, leading to the enhancement in MOR and ORR.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000772493500001	35324075

Strong illumination at 20 degrees C under aerobiosis induced a strong decrease in the absorbance of the cyt b559 alpha-band in the two preparations. This absorbance decline was observed only in non-oxygen-evolving PSII samples when illumination was performed under aerobiosis but at 4 degrees C, or under anaerobiosis at 20 degrees C. These results suggest that acceptor-side photoinhibition induces the degradation of cyt b559 by a mechanism related to an enzymatic reaction mediated by singlet oxygen. Donor-side photoinhibition may induce, however, a nonenzymatic photocleavage of the protein.

Our results show that H-2 dissociation occurs efficiently on O-rich IrO2 (110) at low temperature and initiates from an adsorbed H-2 sigma-complex on the coordinatively-unsaturated Ir atoms (Ir-cus). We find that on-top oxygen atoms (O-ot), adsorbed on the Ir-cus sites, promote the desorption-limited evolution of H2O during subsequent oxidation of the adsorbed hydrogen on IrO2(110) while suppressing reaction-limited production of H2O via the recombination of bridging HO groups (HObr) (similar to 500 to 750 K) during TPRS. The desorption-limited TPRS peak of H2O shifts from similar to 490 to 550 K with increasing O-ot coverage, demonstrating that O-ot atoms stabilize adsorbed OH and H2O species. DFT predicts that molecularly-adsorbed H-2 dissociates on O-rich IrO2(110) at low temperature and that the resulting H-atoms redistribute to produce a mixture of HObr and HOot groups, with equilibrium favouring HOot groups. Our calculations further predict that subsequent H2O evolution occurs through the recombination of HObr/HOot and HOot/HOot pairs, and that these reactions represent desorption-limited pathways because the dissociative chemisorption of H2O is favoured over molecular adsorption on IrO2(110). The higher stability of HO ot groups and their preferred formation causes the higher-barrier HOot /HOot recombination reaction to become the dominant pathway for H2O formation with increasing O-ot coverage, consistent with the experimentally-observed upshift in the H2O TPRS peak temperature.[GRAPHICS].									32	2	0	0	1	0	32			2055-0758	2055-074X		WOS:000469833800001

We show that the ball milling process can significantly enhance the BSCF OER activity. This higher activity is associated with the formation of an amorphous surface layer produced during the ball milling process, as identified by XRD and TEM. The addition of carbon followed by ultrasonication confirms that carbon acts as a reducing agent to functionalize BSCF but is not necessarily needed during the OER, as identified by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Our work thus demonstrates that there are at least two different physicochemical methods to enhance the OER activity of BSCF: (i) generating a surface layer with a short range order and/or (ii) modifying the BSCF electronic structure. Further study shows that these two methods can be superimposed to furthermore improve the OER activity of BSCF. The processed BSCF delivers higher mass activity than a benchmark commercial IrTiO2 catalyst, demonstrating the importance of catalyst processing parameters to functionalize highly active OER catalysts.									24	0	0	0	1	0	24			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000404571500055

Herein, we report a novel wire-on-flake heterostructured ternary Co0.5Ni0.5P electrocatalyst grown on carbon cloth (CC) through a hydrothermal reaction and a low-temperature phosphorization process which exhibits satisfactory results for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media, producing cathodic current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm (-2) at overpotentials of 47 and 96 mV, respectively, and a Tafel slope as small as 34.1 mV dec (-1). On the other hand, a long-time durability test of the electrocatalyst shows its promising prospect for practical applications. Such an excellent HER activity may stem from the wire-on-flake heterostructure and the synergistic effect between cobalt (Co) and nickel (Ni) atoms.									45	6	0	0	2	0	47			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000394430800015

They catalyze the reversible transfer of reducing equivalents between the two nicotinamide cofactors. The soluble transhydrogenase from Escherichia coli (SthA) has found wide use in both in vivo and in vitro applications to steer reducing equivalents toward NADPH-requiring reactions. However, mechanistic insight into SthA function is still lacking. In this work, we present a biochemical characterization of SthA, focusing for the first time on the reactivity of the flavoenzyme with molecular oxygen. We report on oxidase activity of SthA that takes place both during transhydrogenation and in the absence of an oxidized nicotinamide cofactor as an electron acceptor. We find that this reaction produces the reactive oxygen species hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion. Furthermore, we explore the evolutionary significance of the well-conserved CXXXXT motif that distinguishes STHs from the related family of flavoprotein disulfide reductases in which a CXXXXC motif is conserved. Our mutational analysis revealed the cysteine and threonine combination in SthAleads to better coupling efficiency of transhydrogenation and reduced reactive oxygen species release compared to enzyme variants with mutated motifs. These results expand our mechanistic understanding of SthA by high-lighting reactivity with molecular oxygen and the importance of the evolutionarily conserved sequence motif.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1083-351X		WOS:000863182500011	35933012

Benefiting from their spatially and locally separated branches and tri-metallic compositions, the PtPdCu TPs exhibit superior activity and durability for the oxygen reduction reaction. The newly designed PtPdCu TPs are quite different from previous tripods in their branched exteriors. The developed one-step method is very feasible for the preparation of Pt-based multi-metallic tripods with designed compositions and desired performances.									97	6	0	0	5	0	97			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000434624800058

Here, we present that by designing the core-shell distribution of Prussian blue analogues, NiFe-P@CoFe-P nanocubes with various shell-thickness are obtained to unlock the synergy of metal phosphides. The NiFe-P@CoFe-P nanocubes display a low overpotential of 248 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and great stability that outperform commercial RuO2 catalyst towards OER. We find that the OER and HER activity of NiFe-P@CoFe-P are dependent on the shell thickness, suggesting both the surface and sublayers determine the catalytic performance. Moreover, we demonstrate the water splitting under alkaline condition in an H-cell powered by commercial photovoltaics using NiFe-P@CoFe-P catalyst, which is a promising approach for the conversion of solar energy.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000796267400001

XPS and EDS mapping reveal the presence of Ir and Ru on the finished material, while TEM, SEM and XRD suggest that no changes in morphology occurred. A blank sample under the same conditions was prepared without a fixed potential and spontaneously deposited ruthenium was detected in XPS and mappings. Finally, (IrRu)/Pt black was subjected to thermal treatment at 400 degrees C and the prepared catalysts were painted onto carbon paper and used for potentiodynamic scans to test for their activity for the oxygen evolution reaction. When compared to as-received Pt black our (IrRu)/Pt black performed better due to the Ir and Ru modification and a loss in performance was apparent after the heat treatment, this can be a result of the loss of active sites.

International Conference on Nuclear Data for Science and Technology								1548	52 vol.2						1997	1997	Helium-induced reactions play a crucial role in stellar nucleosynthesis. Carbon and oxygen are produced mainly during the helium-burning phase by the chain of reactions 8Be(alpha,gamma+e+e-)12C(alpha,gamma)16O. The first step, often called ldquotriple-alphardquo capture, was proposed by Hoyle to bypass the mass stability gap at 8Be. The second step gives rise to the largest uncertainty in most of the calculated stellar abundances. Later alpha-captures on 13C are believed to be a major source of s-process neutrons. The status of each of these important reactions is reviewed in the following sections.					Conference Proceedings.
