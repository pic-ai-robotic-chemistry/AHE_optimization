Herein we demonstrated a 'polymerization-dissolution' method to prepare a highly stable Fe, N, S tri-heteroatom doped core-shell carbon (HCSC) nanostructural ORR catalyst. The unique advantages, including the uniformly dispersed N, S and Fe-N active sites, and the special leaf-like core-shell nanostructure, endow the optimized HCSC catalyst (HCSC-IV-H) owning high-efficient ORR activity. Moreover, a Zn-air battery assembled with HCSC-IV-H exhibits a higher open potential (1.430 V) and lower discharge overpotential, comparing with the commercial IrO2 + 20% Pt/C catalyst. The present work highlights a novel strategy to construct highly efficient heteroatom doped nano-carbon materials for renewable energy storage and conversion devices. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the high density of surface defects and slow kinetics for oxygen evolution have restricted the PEC performance of hematite photoelectrodes, mainly their low photovoltage. This study provides the hematite surface modification combining two strategies, annealing at high temperatures (800 degrees C) and coating with RuO2 and IrO2/RuO2 co-catalysts. IrO2/RuO2-coated hematite thin film exhibited a low turn-on potential of 0.48 V-RHE and a final photovoltage of 1.20 V, which is the highest photovoltage reported for hematite-based photoelectrodes. A photocurrent density of ca. 1.52 mA cm(-2) was obtained at 1.23 V-RHE, corresponding to ca. 140% increase compared to bare hematite; the photocurrent obtained at 0.60 V-RHE was 0.34 mA cm(-2), the highest value ever reported. The IrO2/RuO2-coated hematite photoelectrode showed a quite stable performance at 0.80 V-RHE for over 72 h. The water oxidation efficiency was therefore enhanced with values above 90% for potentials higher than 1.00 V-RHE due to faster charge transfer and reduced electron-hole recombination at its surface.									64	0	0	0	3	0	64			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000405202800026

Extensive research on metal sulfides has indicated that, amongst other factors, the electrochemical properties of the materials are strongly influenced by the synthetic protocol employed. Herein, we report the electrochemical performance of uncapped NiCo2S4 and CuCo2S4 ternary systems prepared via solventless thermolysis of the respective metal ethyl xanthate precursors at 200 and 300 degrees C. The structural, morphological and compositional properties of the synthesized nanoparticles were examined by powder X-ray diffraction (p-XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) techniques. Electrochemical studies indicate that NiCo2S4 nanoparticles synthesized at 300 degrees C exhibit superior energy storage characteristics with a high specific capacitance of ca. 2650 F g(-1) at 1 mV s(-1), as compared to CuCo2S4 nanoparticles, which showcased a specific capacitance of ca. 1700 F g(-1) at the same scan rate. At a current density of 0.5 A g(-1), NiCo2S4 and CuCo2S4 nanoparticles displayed specific capacitances of 1201 and 475 F g(-1), respectively. In contrast, CuCo2S4 nanoparticles presented a higher electrocatalytic activity with low overpotentials of 269 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and 224 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), at 10 mA cm(-2). The stability of the catalysts was examined for 2000 cycles in which a negligible change in both OER and HER activities was observed.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2046-2069		WOS:000716050500001	35496864

Cyclic voltammetry attests that the presence of the iridium oxide intermediary layer promotes methanol oxidation and provides a more efficient reactivation of Pt particles. Linear sweep voltammetric experiments performed in methanol-free solution indicated that, at Pt/IrO2/BDDP, oxygen evolution is preceded by the formation, within the potential range of CH3OH oxidation, of adsorbed oxygenated species. As expected, the presence in close proximity of Pt particles of such species and of an important amount of IrOx(OH)(y) (evidenced by XPS) assists in the oxidative desorption of CO species adsorbed on Pt active sites. Steady-state polarization measurements carried out in a floating configuration with Pt/IrO2/BDDP gas-diffusion-type electrodes yielded for methanol oxidation overall process Tafel slope values of ca. 120 mVdecade(-1), which compare well with those reported for traditional electrocatalysts.									16	1	0	0	2	0	16			2196-0216			WOS:000410498700016

Possible reasons for this pointed to grain surface chemistry. However, organic molecules and water, which are both ice constituents, do not enjoy the same deuteration. For example, deuterated formaldehyde is very abundant in comets and star-forming regions, while deuterated water rarely is. In this paper, we explain this selective deuteration by following the formation of ices (using the rate equation method) in translucent clouds, as well as their evolution as the cloud collapses to form a star. Ices start with the deposition of gas-phase CO and O onto dust grains. While reaction of oxygen with atoms (H or D) or molecules (H-2) yields H2O (HDO), CO only reacts with atoms (H and D) to form H2CO (HDCO, D2CO). As a result, the deuteration of formaldehyde is sensitive to the gas D/H ratio as the cloud undergoes gravitational collapse, while the deuteration of water strongly depends on the dust temperature at the time of ice formation. These results reproduce well the deuterium fractionation of formaldehyde observed in comets and star-forming regions and can explain the wide spread of deuterium fractionation of water observed in these environments.									54	0	0	0	0	0	54			2041-8205			WOS:000296753100010

It is desirable to design transition metal molecular catalysts inspired by enzymatic oxygen activation/reduction processes as an alternative to noble-metal-Pt-based ORR electrocatalysts, especially in view point of fuel cell commercialization. We have fabricated bio-inspired molecular catalysts electrografted onto multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in which 5,10,15,20-tetra(pentafluorophenyl) iron porphyrin (iron porphyrin FeF20TPP) is coordinated with covalently electrografted axial ligands varying from thiophene to imidazole on the MWCNTs' surface. The catalysts' electrocatalytic activity varied with the axial coordination environment (i. e., S-thiophene, N-imidazole, and O-carboxylate); the imidazole-coordinated catalyst MWCNTs-Im-FeF20TPP exhibited the highest ORR activity among the prepared catalysts. When MWCNT-Im-FeF20TPP was loaded onto the cathode of a zinc-air battery, an open-cell voltage (OCV) of 1.35 V and a maximum power density (P-max) of 110 mW cm(-2) were achieved; this was higher than those of MWCNTs-Thi-FeF20TPP (OCV=1.30 V, P-max=100 mW cm(-2)) and MWCNTs-Ox-FeF20TPP (OCV=1.28 V, P-max=86 mW cm(-2)) and comparable with a commercial Pt/C catalyst (OCV=1.45 V, P-max=120 mW cm(-2)) under similar experimental conditions. This study provides a time-saving method to prepare covalently immobilized molecular electrocatalysts on carbon-based materials with structure-performance correlation that is also applicable to the design of other electrografted catalysts for energy conversion.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000654458900001	33876876

However, their ORR catalytic activities still need to be further improved. Herein, fibrous CaMnO3 catalysts with hierarchical mesoporous/macroporous structures for the ORR were prepared through a simple ion exchange process with biomass derivative calcium alginate as a precursor. Optimization of the synthesis conditions, in particular, the La doping content, is conducted. The as prepared CaMnO3 shows superior ORR performance in alkaline media with a limited diffusion density of 6.13 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the ORR performance was further promoted by La-doping. The optimal La-doped CaMnO3 sample exhibits the most positive onset potential of -0.01 V, the most positive half-wave potential of -0.28 V (VS. Ag/AgCl), and a greatly enhanced limited diffusion density of 6.76 mA cm(-2). The improvement of catalytic activity for ORR can be attributed to the porous structure, the rich surface chemisorbed oxygen and the redox couple Mn3+/Mn4+. The as-prepared perovskite fibers have potential as low cost and efficient ORR catalysts. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The kinetic diagrams for the homopolymerization of F and P were obtained following the evolution of the heat of reaction by DSC, and revealed the autoacceleration and the vitrification effects on the polymerization rate. The influence of oxygen in the photoinitiated polymerization was analyzed by determining the steady-state concentration of oxygen from the kinetic data obtained for polymerizations performed out in the presence and absence of oxygen. The results obtained indicate that P is more sensitive than F to the presence of oxygen in free radical polymerization. The photoinitiated copolymerization process is little affected by the concentration of monomers, giving similar R(p) and Phi(m) values for both systems. However, at low polymerization temperature 0 degrees C non-crosslinked copolymers are obtained, whereas at a temperature of 40 degrees C, the copolymers prepared at conversion higher than 20 mol % become crosslinked as a result of the active participation of the furfuryl ring in the polymerization process at this temperature.

Here, we report highly efficient catalysts ternary NiCoMn-layered double hydroxides (NiCoMn-LDHs) nanosheets which are oxygen vacancy-rich, produced under controllable conditions for the electrooxidation of both 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and furfural to furoic acid (FurAc) under mild conditions, respectively. Electrochemical tests showed that the oxidation of HMF and furfural occurred prior to the oxidation of water at lower applied potentials with NiCoMn-LDHs catalysts. High yields of FDCA (91.7%) and FurAc (92.4%) were achieved in 2.5 h using 1.15 nm thick NiCoMn-LDHs nanosheets under the optimal conditions. The mechanism for the superior performance, high durability, and good faradaic efficiency has been elucidated by comprehensive characterization, which confirmed that ultrathin nanosheets expose more Co-NiOOH active sites with oxygen vacancies, facilitating the synergistic effect between HMF and furfural oxidation reaction on Co-Ni and Mn2+ states. The oxygen vacancy-rich NiCoMn-LDHs nanosheet catalysts present a novel and energy-efficient solution to obtain upgraded biochemicals.									42	0	0	0	3	0	43			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000649465800001

Under electrochemical water-oxidation reaction (WOR) conditions at pH = 1, blue films were observed to deposit on the electrode surfaces for all of the complexes, without the detection of oxygen. For chemically driven WORs, three oxidants with different overpotentials and electron-transfer kinetics led to very different behaviors. [Ru(bpy)(3)] (3+) was shown to slowly oxidize the ligands without generating oxygen at pH = 3.7. With NaIO4 as the oxidant at neutral pH, oxygen generation was observed, but ligand oxidation was also seen for the complexes with electron-donating substituents such as -OMe or -OH groups. With Ce4+ as the oxidant at pH = 1, a competition between water oxidation and ligand decomposition existed; less ligand decomposition was observed for catalysts that are more active for WOR. These results indicate the intricate nature of molecule water-oxidation catalysts and their complex behaviors that are highly sensitive to water-oxidation conditions.									26	0	0	0	3	0	26			1434-1948	1099-0682		WOS:000336741600013

The values obtained for the Na excess after the first dredge-up phase are in close agreement with recent observations suggesting a moderate Na excess in F-type supergiants. We also found a positive correlation between the overabundance factors [N/H] and [Na/H] which seems to indicate that Na enrichment originates from the Ne-Na cycle operating simultaneously with the CNO tri-cycle in these stars.

The reasons for the higher electroactivity of amorphous iridium oxides compared to their crystalline counterpart is still the matter of an intense debate in the literature and, a comprehensive understanding is needed to optimize its use and allow for the development of water electrolysis. By producing iridium-based mixed oxides using aerosol, we are able to decouple the electronic processes from the structural transformation, i.e. Ir oxidation from IrO2 crystallization, occurring upon calcination. Full characterization using in situ and ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy allows to unambiguously attribute their high electrochemical activity to structural features and rules out the iridium oxidation state as a critical parameter. This study indicates that short-range ordering, corresponding to sub-2nm crystal size for our samples, drives the activity independently of the initial oxidation state and composition of the calcined iridium oxides. The origins of the superior catalytic activity of poorly crystallized Ir-based oxide material for the OER in acid is still under debate. Here, authors synthesize porous IrMo oxides to deconvolute the effect of Ir oxidation state from short-range ordering and show the latter to be a key factor.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2041-1723			WOS:000669487700012	34168129

In our study the parallel decreases in the effective rate constant for photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry, the variable fluorescence yield of a dark-adapted sample, and light-limited O-2 evolution rates after short (0-10 min) exposures to photoinhibitory conditions could not be attributed to damage or down-regulation of PSII reaction centers. Instead, these changes were consistent with the presence of nonphotochemical quenching of PSII excitation energy in the antennae. This quenching was analogous to that component of nonphotochemical quenching studied in higher plants that is associated with photoinhibition of photosynthesis and/or processes protecting against photoinhibition in that it did not relax readily in the dark and persisted in the absence of a bulk transthylakoid proton gradient. The quenching was most likely associated with photoprotective processes in the PSII antenna that reduced the extent of photoinhibitory damage, particularly after longer exposures. Our results suggest that a large population of damaged, slowly recovering PSII centers did not form in Phaedactylum even after 60 min of exposure to excess actinic light.									48	2	0	0	44	0	50			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:A1994PM92100042	12232368

The critical dosage is about 3 mol photons m(-2) for medium and high light-grown leaves and 0.36 mol photons m(-2) for low light-grown leaves. Photoinactivation is a one-hit process with an effective cross-section of 0.045 m(2) mol(-1) photons which does not vary with growth irradiance, unlike the cross-section for oxygen evolution which increases with decreasing growth irradiance. The cross-section for oxygen evolution increased by about 20% following exposure to 6.8 mol photons m(-2) which may be due to energy transfer from photoinactivated units to functional Photosystem II units. We propose that the photoinactivation of PS II begins when a small group of PS II pigment molecules whose structure is uninfluenced by growth irradiance, becomes uncoupled energetically from the rest of the photosynthetic unit and thus no longer transfers excitons to P680. De-excitation of this group of pigment molecules provides the energy which leads to the damage of Photosystem II. Treatment of pea leaves with dithiothreitol, an inhibitor of the xanthophyll cycle, decreases the critical dosage i.e. decreases photoprotection but has no effect on the PS II photoinactivation cross-section. Treatment with 1 mu M nigericin increased the photoinactivation cross-section of PS II as did exposure to lincomycin which inhibits D1 protein synthesis and thus the repair of PS II reaction centres.									34	2	0	0	27	0	36			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:A1996WD34300005	24271820

Photosynthetic water oxidation vs. mitochondrial oxygen reduction: distinct mechanistic parallels								JOURNAL OF BIOENERGETICS AND BIOMEMBRANES				43	4			437	446		10.1007/s10863-011-9370-7				AUG 2011	2011	The photosynthetic oxygen evolving complex (PSII-OEC) and the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) not only catalyze anti-parallel reactions (the OEC oxidizes water to dioxygen, whereas CcO reduces dioxygen to water), they also share a number of uncanny molecular and mechanistic similarities. Both feature a redox-active polymetallic cluster that includes a key tyrosine, and both utilize a two-phase mechanism. In one phase the polymetallic cluster undergoes four sequential one-electron transfers: In the PSII-OEC, four successive photooxidations of the photosystem II reaction center P680 (to P680(+)) allows acceptance of 4x1e-from the Mn4Ca cluster; in CcO, four reduced cytochrome c Fe2+ cations donate 4x1e- to the bimetallic center. In the second phase for each enzyme, the polymetallic cluster undergoes a single four-electron transfer with the O-2/2 H2O redox couple. Intriguing mechanistic similarities between these two complex redox enzymes first delineated over a decade ago by Hoganson/Proshlyakov/Babcock et al. are updated and expanded in this article.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0145-479X	1573-6881		WOS:000298009700011	21766199	
J	Ji, Yuan; Li, Zhenlong; Liu, Yundan; Wu, Xianghua; Ren, Long								Design and Synthesis of Cobalt-Based Hollow Nanoparticles through the Liquid Metal Template								MICROMACHINES				13	8					1292	10.3390/mi13081292				AUG 2022	2022	Co-based compounds have attracted much attention due to their competitive catalytic activities. To enhance their intrinsic electrocatalytic activity, morphology engineering is one of the effective strategies. Hollow structures have fascinating properties due to their low density and high loading capacity. In this work, we introduce a Ga-based liquid alloy as a reactive template for the synthesis of varying Co-based hollow nanoparticles. The fluidity character of the Ga-based liquid alloy facilitates the large-scale production of nanoparticles via a top-down shearing process. The pre-installed active species (here is Zn) in the liquid alloy serve as a sacrificial source to quantitatively reduce Co2+ ions and form Co-based compounds. Well-structured Ga/CoOOH core-shell nanospheres are thus successfully prepared, and more varied Co-based hollow nanoparticles can be obtained by post-treatment and reaction. Hollow structures can offer enhanced interfacial area and increased active sites, benefiting the catalytic performance. Among the prepared Co-based catalysts, CoSe2 hollow nanoparticles exhibited the best oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with an overpotential of 340 mV at the current density of 10 mA/cm(2). This work provides a novel strategy for the rational design and simple preparation of hollow nanoparticles.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2072-666X		WOS:000846555200001	36014214

However, as a result of poor stability during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), Si still remains unsuitable for any extended use. Ultra-thin titanium dioxide (TiO2) films have been used as protective coatings and are shown to enhance Si photoanode lifetime with added solar to hydrogen performance improvements through distancing the oxidation reaction away from the Si photoanode surface and improved charge transport through the anode. This study details the nucleation, growth chemistry, and performance of TiO2 thin films prepared via thermal and plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (ALD) using both titanium isopropoxide and tetrakis(dimethylamido)titanium as the precursor material. The effect of post ALD treatments of plasma and air annealing was also studied. Films were investigated using photoelectrochemical cell testing to evaluate photoelectrochemical performance, and in-vacuum cycle-by-cycle x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used as the primary characterisation technique to study nucleation mechanisms and film properties contributing to improvements in cell performance. TiO2 grown by plasma enhanced ALD results in cleaner films with reduced carbon incorporation. However, despite increased carbon incorporation, thermally grown films showed improved photocurrent as a result of oxygen vacancies in these films. Post deposition annealing in a H-2 ambient is shown to further improve photocurrent in all cases, while annealing in atmosphere leads to uniform film chemistry and enhanced photocurrent stability in all cases.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000719106700001		
J	Trindell, J.; Sugar, J.; McDaniel, A.								Measuring Electronic and Structural Transformations in Solar Thermochemical Water Splitting Materials with Aberration-Corrected STEM-EELS								Microscopy and Microanalysis				27	suppl.1			2428	9		10.1017/S1431927621008680				2021	2021	Solar thermochemical hydrogen (STCH) production is currently being investigated inthe push towards a clean energy infrastructure.1, 2The STCH process uses solar energy to drive the necessary redox reactions for water-splitting. A STCH cycle consists of a thermal reduction step, releasing O2, and an oxidation or water-splitting step, releasing H2. In order to understand the rate-limiting and mechanistic details of this process, it is necessary to investigate (1) how the electrons are being transported through the active material during redox cycling and (2) the effects of any structural rearrangements, including defect formations or phase changes, on water-splitting activity. Transition-metal-based perovskites are frequently reported as active STCH cycle materials.Atomic substitution enables the composition of these perovskites to bevaried, resulting in a range of compositions to be explored and discovered as increasingly active STCH materials. The electronic and structural changes of novel ABO3-type perovskites during STCH cycling are examined here. We combine STEM-EELS, electron diffraction analysis, and atomic-resolution STEM imaging to understand the effects of STCH cycling on perovskite structural stability and long-term activity. We apply STEM-EELS to both the oxidized and reduced states of these materials to determine the valence state changes of the A-and B-site ions during the redox reactions.In addition, in situ heating in the microscope column vacuum allows us to view the progressive, temperature-dependent chemical changes during reduction, providing mechanistic insight into the redox chemistry of these materials. During the thermal reduction, or activation step, oxygen gas is spontaneously released from the crystalline lattice, forming oxygen vacancies. The resulting strain can lead to the formation of crystalline defects or even complete phase transitions.3The combination of diffraction analysis and atomic resolution imaging allows us to correlate the crystalline defect formations with the electronic changes that are measured with EELS. Here, we will compare the water-splitting activity of different perovskite-based STCH materials in correlation with the corresponding microstructural and electronic structure evolution observed during redox cycling. The combination of multiple electron-microscopy based techniques provides valuable nanoscale insight into mechanistic details of the redox reactions that are not obvious when bulk techniques that average measurements over larger volumes are used. This paper describes objective technical results and analysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1431-9276			INSPEC:21023782

The resistance of the ceramic core as a function of the heating temperature was measured in situ. The pO(2) of the outlet gas in the heating process was also monitored continuously. By comparing the heating process with the X-ray diffraction and T-c measurements taken from samples quenched at different temperatures, we have identified that the heating process could be divided into the following regions: (1) the oxygen diffusion (OD) region, which is mainly influenced by OD; (2) the Pb-rich phase evolution (PbE) region, in which the formation and decomposition of the Pb-rich phases occur; (3) the liquid phase formation (LF) region, in which resistance increased rapidly with increasing temperature.

The wise integration of transition metal compounds with macroscale current collectors is a promising strategy to achieve OER catalysts with high utilization efficiency. Herein, graphene with superior electron pathways, high surface area, excellent conductive and mechanical properties, and conjugate planes to anchor other phases with good dispersion was employed as the barrier between 3D Ni foam and NiFe-LDHs for 3D monolith electrodes. The as-obtained electrode exhibited a remarkably low onset overpotential of 240 mV, a small overpotential of 325 mV for 10 mA cm(-2) and a substantially decreased Tafel slope of 44 mV dec(-1) in 0.1 M KOH. The graphene barrier herein not only provides a novel hydrophobic substrate to modulate the growth of 3D NiFe-LDHs with good dispersion, but also delivers a strongly coupled interface between the active phase and current collectors. Consequently, the as-obtained graphene mediated 3D monolith electrode exhibited a very high electrochemically active surface area, an optimal interfacial junction, as well as superior OER performance. This work provides a novel catalyst for OER and more importantly, it reveals the role of graphene in modulating the interfacial features of various composites, which is general and can be employed in many material systems for satisfactory applications in heterogeneous catalysis, energy conversion and storage, sensors and so on.									48	8	0	0	0	0	51			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000358722200047

It has been found that the compound has prolonged stability in 6 M KOH solution and can be used as the positive electrode material in rechargeable alkaline batteries. The structure, morphology and composition of the compound have been investigated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and infrared spectroscopy. The electrode comprising the aluminium-substituted nickel hydroxide has greater discharge capacity and higher utilization of active material than the beta-Ni(OH)(2) electrode. Cyclic voltammetry suggest that the aluminium-substituted nickel hydroxide has better reversibility of the Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH redox couple and higher oxygen evolution overpotential than beta-Ni(OH)(2). The mechanism of the electrode reaction has also been discussed and the proton diffusion coefficient in the compound has been determined.									71	10	0	0	0	0	76			0021-891X			WOS:000081035600010

However, the slow dynamics of the ORR and OER are the key challenges limiting their efficiencies. Transition metals (TMs) and their alloys are promising catalysts for the ORR and OER. Herein, we develop a facile and robust method to prepare TM alloy nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers as efficient bifunctional catalysts for both the OER and ORR. We find that this method can benefit the catalyst design in several ways. Firstly, the compositions of alloys (binary, ternary and quaternary alloys) can be well controlled. Secondly, alloy nanoparticles could be formed and uniformly distributed along the supporting carbon nanofibers which could avoid their aggregation. Additionally, the alloy nanoparticles are encapsulated by carbon layers and nitrogen atoms could be introduced easily into the carbon nanofibers and layers causing changes of their electronic structure, which can then improve the catalytic activity of metal alloy cores. Using this method, we prepared N-doped carbon encapsulating nickel, cobalt and iron alloys with a ratio of 1 : 1 : 1 as a bifunctional catalyst with remarkable activities for both the OER and ORR. d-Band theory calculations were used to explain the superior activities of the alloys. The assembled rechargeable Zn-air battery with the as-synthesized NiCoFe@N-CNFs shows a high specific capacity of similar to 845 mA h g(Zn)(-1) with superior charge-discharge cycling durability. This work can provide an ideal platform to study the fundamental mechanism of catalytic processes involving complex metal alloy catalysts and to modify their catalytic activity at the atomic level.									37	3	0	0	1	0	37			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000526936600021

Herein, we report a single-step fabrication of nickel-yttria stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ) 3D micro-pattern through atmospheric plasma spray as a dual-functional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. This 3D micro-pattern strategy improves the mass diffusion pathway and active surface area, resulting in good electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER). Although YSZ alone shows little catalytic activity, Ni decorations enhances the activity towards OER and HER in alkaline solution. Using NiYSZ as a dual-functional electrocatalyst, it reaches a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at the potential of 1.70 V, 1.65 V, and 1.67 V after 0 h, 100 h, and 200 h of durability tests. Besides, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra analyzed by genetic programming is monitoring the resistance contributed by several relaxations and provides the information about its changes with durability tests and Ni contents. This study opens a new strategy to enhance the water-splitting performance and to analyze the EIS data of electrocatalytic systems.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000564496500004

Oxygen producing photosynthesis uniquely employs manganese ions as rapid electron donors. Introducing this attribute to anoxygenic photosynthesis may identify evolutionary intermediates and provide insights to the energetics of biological water oxidation. This work presents effective environmental methods that substantially and simultaneously tune the redox potentials of manganese ions and the cofactors of a photosynthetic enzyme from native anoxygenic bacteria without the necessity of genetic modification or synthesis. A spontaneous coordination with bis-tris propane lowered the redox potential of the manganese (II) to manganese (III) transition to an unusually low value (similar to 400 mV) at pH 9.4 and allowed its binding to the bacterial reaction center. Binding to a novel buried binding site elevated the redox potential of the primary electron donor, a dimer of bacteriochlorophylls, by up to 92 mV also at pH 9.4 and facilitated the electron transfer that is able to compete with the wasteful charge recombination. These events impaired the function of the natural electron donor and made BTP-coordinated manganese a viable model for an evolutionary alternative.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			0005-2728	1879-2650		WOS:000430755600001	29355486

As extant representatives of microbial communities where free oxygen may have first been available on a changing planet, they offer an ecosystem within which to study the evolution of biogeochemical cycles requiring and inhibited by oxygen. Here, we report the distribution of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism across a vertical oxygen gradient at 1 mm resolution in a microbial mat using quantitative PCR (qPCR), retro-transcribed qPCR (RT-qPCR) and metagenome sequencing. Vertical patterns in the presence and expression of nitrogen cycling genes, corresponding to oxygen requiring and non-oxygen requiring nitrogen metabolism, could be seen across gradients of dissolved oxygen and ammonium. Metagenome analysis revealed that genes annotated as hydroxylamine dehydrogenase (proper enzyme designation EC 1.7.2.6, hao) and hydroxylamine reductase (hcp) were the most abundant nitrogen metabolism genes in the mat. The recovered hao genes encode hydroxylamine dehydrogenase EC 1.7.2.6 (HAO) proteins lacking the tyrosine residue present in aerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB). Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that those proteins were more closely related to eHao protein present in Campylobacterota lineages (previously known as Epsilonproteobacteria) rather than oxidative HAO of AOB. BLAST analysis of some transcribed proteins indicated that they likely functioned as a nitrate reductase. The presence of hao sequences related with eHao protein, as well as numerous hcp genes encoding a prismane protein, suggest the presence of a nitrogen cycling pathway previously described in Nautilia profundicola as ancestral to the most commonly studied present day nitrogen cycling pathways.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1751-7362	1751-7370		WOS:000725944500001	34862473

Herein, atomically dispersed Ni single atoms are supported by sub-10 nm Pd nanocrystals embedded in N-doped carbon frameworks (Ni SAs-Pd@NC), in an effort to achieve superior bifunctional activity in both the ORR and OER. The key synthetic point depends on the protection mechanism of 1-naphthylamine, which could provide a carbon source for Ni SAs and restrict the Pd size under sub-10 nm during 600 degrees C pyrolysis, simultaneously. The synergistic effect of sub-10 nm Pd with superior ORR activity and Ni-N-4 SAs with favourable OER activity leads to bifunctional catalytic performance, meanwhile the rod-like carbon frameworks with ultrathin, porous and N-doped features contribute to accelerated electron transfer and structural robustness. As a proof-of-concept application, Ni SAs-Pd@NC demonstrates ultrahigh ORR activity with a positive half-wave potential of 0.84 V and a low OER overpotential of 380 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), in an alkaline medium. For a rechargeable Zn-air battery, the Ni SAs-Pd@NC cathode delivers a low charge-discharge voltage gap of 0.87 V, a high energy density of 884.6 W h kg(Zn)(-1), a high power density of 134.2 mW cm(-2) and remarkable long-term cyclability for operation over 700 cycles, outperforming commercial Pt/C + RuO2 benchmarks. This work successfully integrates single atom sites with small-sized noble metals to break out their incompatibility in synthesis and to improve their thermostability, which offers a versatile approach to develop single atom-based bifunctional catalysts for energy devices.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000719957800001

Superior stability towards photo-corrosion, appropriate band energy levels driving most photocatalytic reactions, and lowcost production are promising features of TiO2. However, a primary limitation with TiO2 is that it only absorbs ultraviolet light constituting less than 5% of the solar spectrum. In this work, we use a facile, low temperature, vacuum-free, and solution-route synthesis approach to rationally induce oxygen vacancy/Ti3+ defects to reduce the bandgap of TiO2 to 2.0 eV (3.2 eV for pristine white TiO2) to form brown TiO2 with enhanced visible-light absorption. The mechanism of defect formation is systematically deduced from the detailed investigation through Raman spectroscopy, spin-sensitive technique, high-resolution microscopy, and surface analysis. The brown TiO2 yielded 8.1 mmol h(-1)g(cat)(-1) H-2 evolution without any cocatalyst under natural sunlight, which is a factor two higher than pristine (white) TiO2. To the best of our knowledge, the observed H-2 evolution rate is the highest reported value under natural sunlight for any TiO2-based photocatalyst. This work demonstrates the applicability of brown TiO2 to fabricate large-area photocatalyst panels for the cost-effective production of solar H-2.									6	0	0	0	3	0	6			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000635577400004

In this article, we report a solution-based bottom-up synthesis of wafer-scale nanometer-thick CoO nanosheets using ionic layer epitaxy (ILE). In ILE, a monolayer of ionized oleyl sulfate surfactants at the water-air interface served as a flexible template for direct CoO crystallization underneath. The as-synthesized CoO nanosheet is polycrystalline and could be grown as large as the entire solution surface in the reactor (>cm(2)) with a uniform 2.8 nm thickness across the entire sheet. The nanosheet is free-standing on the water surface and can be readily transported to arbitrary substrate surfaces for device fabrication. As a demonstration, centimeter-sized CoO nanosheets were directly transferred to Si wafers for electrochemical electrode applications. The nanometer thick CoO nanosheet exhibited higher catalytic properties towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) compared to bulk CoO. It also showed excellent stability at high photocurrent density when used as a photoelectrochemical (PEC) photoanode in corrosive alkaline electrolytes. This work evidenced the effectiveness of the ILE technique in synthesizing 2D nanomaterials from a broad range of functional oxides with enhanced physical properties.									21	1	0	0	1	0	21			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000401316100027

Its position and width lead to an identification with the C-H stretching mode of solid organic material. A possible mechanism for the production of organic solids in the interstellar medium is UV photoprocessing of icy mantles which accrete on dust grains in dense clouds. Furthermore, thermally induced reactions involving formaldehyde molecules in the mantles could be an important source of organics. Laboratory simulation of these processes shows that a large variety of oxygen- and nitrogen-rich species may be produced. It is shown that the occurrence of periodic transient heating events plays an important role in the production of organic material in the ice mantles. Finally, it is pointed out how future missions like the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) as well as analysis of comet material by Rosetta may be able to clarify the nature and evolution of interstellar organics.

J	PHILBRICK, JB; DINER, BA; ZILINSKAS, BA								CONSTRUCTION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF CYANOBACTERIAL MUTANTS LACKING THE MANGANESE-STABILIZING POLYPEPTIDE OF PHOTOSYSTEM-II								JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY				266	20			13370	13376						JUL 15 1991	1991	Mutants of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. Pasteur Culture Collection (PCC) 6803 that specifically lack the extrinsic 33-kDa manganese-stabilizing polypeptide of the photosystem II oxygen-evolving complex have been constructed by two independent methods. Cartridge mutagenesis was used to insertionally inactivate the psbO gene of one mutant and completely delete the psbO gene of the other mutant. These mutants have no detectable manganese-stabilizing polypeptide, but they do accumulate steady-state levels of the intrinsic photosystem II polypeptides D1, D2, and CP-43 that are comparable to wild-type, as determined by immunoblot analysis. Measurement of the evolution of the relative quantum yields of chlorophyll fluorescence following actinic flash excitation indicates that though the concentration of reaction centers in mutant cells is comparable to that of wild-type cells, approximately 40% of these centers harbor a fluorescence-quenching species other than P680+. The mutants are capable of photoautotrophic growth at a slower rate than that of wild-type. Under conditions of Ca2+ depletion where wild-type growth is unaffected, the mutants are unable to grow at all. The manganese-stabilizing protein, therefore, enhances the binding of Ca2+ or protects the reaction center at low Ca2+ concentrations. The mutants evolve oxygen at approximately 70% of the wild-type rate, but are completely photoinactivated by high light intensities. Our results indicate that the manganese-stabilizing polypeptide is not absolutely required for photosystem II assembly or function in cyanobacteria, but its absence does lead to an enhanced sensitivity to photoinhibition.									146	1	1	0	134	0	148			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:A1991FX13200089	1712783

This is in many cases both time and resource consuming due to methodological difficulties of in situ detection of centers of this kind. In this work, we use the recently developed approach based on the analysis of the tunneling current noise recorded by electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (n-ECSTM) to compare the nature of the most active hydrogen evolution catalytic sites in a system consisting of sub-monolayers of platinum on a Au substrate to the one of palladium on Au. Our n-ECSTM measurements performed under reaction conditions show that in striking contrast to Pd islands on gold, where the most active centers are located close to the boundary between Au and palladium atoms, all Pt ad-atoms contribute to the overall activity rather equally at pH 1. Methodological aspects related to the use of n-ECSTM in electrocatalytic research are also discussed.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000463843900034	30864772

The new stellar models for the three clusters match the observed effective temperatures on the giant branches, the oxygen-rich to carbon-rich transition luminosities, and the AGB-tip luminosities. A major finding is that a large amount of convective overshoot (up to 3 pressure scale heights) is required at the base of the convective envelope during third dredge-up in order to get the correct oxygen-rich to carbon-rich transition luminosity. The stellar evolution sequences are used as input for detailed nucleosynthesis calculations. For NGC 1978 and NGC 1846 we compare our model results to the observationally derived abundances of carbon and oxygen. We find that additional mixing processes (extra mixing) are required to explain the observed abundance patterns. For NGC 1846 we conclude that non-convective extra mixing processes are required on both the red giant branch and the AGB, in agreement with previous studies. For NGC 1978 it is possible to explain the C/O and C-12/C-13 abundances of both the O-rich and the C-rich AGB stars by assuming that the material in the intershell region contains high abundances of both C and O. This may occur during a thermal pulse when convective overshoot at the inner edge of the flash-driven convective pocket dredges C and O from the core to the intershell. For NGC 419 we provide our predicted model abundance values although there are currently no published observed abundance studies for the AGB stars in this cluster.									37	0	0	0	0	1	37			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000302861300020

In the present communication a numerical model is presented that describes the interactive development of the TGO morphology and the fracture processes in TBC systems in a mesh-independent way. The evolution of the TGO-BC mixture zone is described by an oxygen diffusion-reaction model. The partition-of-unity method is employed for the simulation of discrete cracking, where cracks can nucleate and propagate across finite elements at arbitrary locations and orientations. The validity of the model is demonstrated through the analysis of a representative TBC system subjected to a specific thermal cycling process. A parametric analysis demonstrates the sensitivity of the response of the TBC system to the fracture strength of the top coat. The simulation results indicate that cracks appear primarily at the current location of the BC-TGO interface and may nucleate at early stages of thermal cycling. These results are in good agreement with recent experimental observations reported in the literature. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) play an important role in energy conversion and storage systems, such as fuel cells and metal air batteries. Herein, it is critical important to develop high efficient and stable electrocatalysts for ORRs to replace platinum-based catalytic materials. In this work, nickel-cobalt bimetallic metal-organic framework (NiCo-MOF-74) and its derivatives (oxide, phosphide and sulfide) were synthesized and their electrochemical performances for ORRs were evaluated. The series of NiCo-MOF-74 products with rod-like structure show excellent electrochemical performance, especially phosphide. The phosphide exhibits higher current density, excellent methanol tolerance and long-term stability compared with the Pt/C catalyst. Therefore, the series of NiCo-MOF-74 derivatives have great potential in ORRs as highly active, stable and low-cost catalysts.

Various concentrations of As(III) did not show significant effects on growth and total carotenoids content within 24 h of treatment. After 48 h of treatment, 10 mg L-1 As(III) significantly inhibited the growth and synthesis of carotenoids of M. aeruginosa, while As(III) at concentrations ranging from 0 to 1 mg L-1 showed no significant inhibition. Chlorophyll a synthesis, oxygen evolution and chlorophyll fluorescence were more sensitive to As(III) exposure than carotenoid synthesis and growth. Chlorophyll a content, fast fluorescence rise transients and fluorescence decay kinetics appeared to be affected after the cells were exposed to 1 and 10 mg L-1 As(III) for more than 24 h. Treatment with 10 mg L-1 As(III) for 24 h or longer led to flattening of the fluorescence transient and drastic decrease of amplitude of fast phase of Q(A)(-) reoxidation kinetics. Exposure to As(III) mainly inhibited the quantum yield for primary photochemistry, density of reaction centers and photosynthesis performance index, and increased the dissipated energy. The decrease in amplitude of the fast and middle phases further revealed that once electron transfer from Q(A)(-) to Q(B) was inhibited by As(III), more Q(A)(-) was reoxidized via S-2(Q(A)Q(B))(-) charge recombination. As(IlI) stress may result in an increased stability of the S(2)QB(-) and S(2)QA(-) recombination. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Experimentally, the best performance was identified with NPC-1000 which possessed the highest BET specific surface area of 1117.2 m(2) g(-1). This NPC-1000 showed a half-wave potential of 50 mV difference with commercial Pt/C, better tolerance to methanol and a superior stability comparable to commercial Pt/C catalyst. The results suggest that it is a simple, feasible, and economical route to synthesis of hierarchical porous carbon which can be used as metal-free catalysts for oxygen reduction.

C	Biswas, R; Lvov, SN; Ahmad, Z; Macdonald, DD						McBreen, J; Mukerjee, S; Srinivasan, S		Electrode-kinetic and corrosion measurements in high temperature aqueous environments								PROCEEDINGS OF THE SYMPOSIUM ON ELECTRODE MATERIALS AND PROCESSES FOR ENERGY CONVERSION AND STORAGE IV		ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY SERIES		97	13			340	353						1997	1997	A thorough understanding of the kinetics and mechanisms of electrochemical reactions, including corrosion phenomena, requires the measurement of appropriate kinetic parameters (the exchange current density and the anodic and cathodic transfer coefficients). Because electrode reactions are heterogeneous processes, their kinetics reflect both mass transfer and charge transfer phenomena. However, the parameters that we seek, in this work, are strictly charge transfer ire nature, so that it is necessary to delineate these phenomena in any experiment that is designed to acquire the data of interest. The most effective way of doing this is to carry out polarization studies at very high mass transfer rates under well-defined hydrodynamic conditions. A controlled hydrodynamic electrochemical cell has been developed for experimental measurements in high temperature aqueous environments. This instrument is capable of operating at temperatures up to 300 degrees C, and of developing linear flow velocities up to 3.5 m/sec with a corresponding Reynolds number of 10(5). Polarization curves for the oxidation and evolution of hydrogen on a platinized Ni electrode in high temperature 0.1 m NaOH aqueous solution have been measured over a wide range of temperature from 25 degrees C to 300 degrees C. Also polarization curves for the same reaction were measured on 304 Stainless Steel. In addition, polarization curves for the reduction and evolution of oxygen on 304 stainless steel in high. temperature aqueous solutions have been measured. Non-linear regression analysis was applied to the polarization data to extract kinetic parameters using the generalized Butler-Volmer equation. The exchange current densities, as well as the anodic and cathodic Tafel coefficients, have been derived for the reactions studied. A new formulation for the exchange current density for the reduction/evolution of oxygen on Type 304 SS, as a function of temperature (25-300 degrees C), pH (7-13), and oxygen concentration (7-35 ppm), was obtained. Excellent agreement was found between these new data and those previously employed by Song and Macdonald in modeling corrosion processes in water-cooled nuclear reactors. Equations describing the exchange current density of the oxidation/evolution of hydrogen on platinized Nickel and 304 SS were also derived.

Herein, the low-content Pt (0.8 wt%)/tungsten oxide/reduced graphene oxide aerogel (LPWGA) electrocatalyst with excellent HER activity and durability is developed by employing a tungsten oxide/reduced graphene oxide aerogel (WGA) obtained from a facile solvothermal process as a support, followed by electrochemical deposition of Pt nanoparticles. The WGA support with abundant oxygen vacancies and hierarchical pores plays the roles of anchoring the Pt nanoparticles, supplying continuous mass transport and electron transfer channels, and modulating the surface electronic state of Pt, which endow the LPWGA with both high HER activity and durability. Even under a low loading of 0.81 mu g(Pt) cm(-2), the LPWGA exhibits a high HER activity with an overpotential of 42 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), an excellent stability under 10000-cycle cyclic voltammetry and 40 h chronopotentiometry at 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope (30 mV dec(-1)), and a high turnover frequency of 29.05 s(-1) at eta = 50 mV, which is much superior to the commercial Pt/C and the low-content Pt/reduced graphene oxide aerogel. This work provides a new strategy to design high-performance Pt-based electrocatalysts with greatly reduced use of Pt.									9	0	0	0	0	0	8			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000679561400001	34331402

The nucleoside main absorption band in the UV-Vis range, centered at 337 nm, was monitored at several reaction times, confirming the S-4-TdR reactivity with a process leading to thymidine (TdR), as the main reaction product, detected through its absorption at 270 nm. Actually, the generation of at least another by-product, absorbing at slightly higher wavelengths compared to S-4-TdR, was inferred from UV-Vis spectra. FTIR-ATR and ESI-MS, MS/MS and MS3 measurements were then performed to unveil the nature of these reaction products, evidencing the presence of a hydroxylated S-4-TdR as important intermediate reaction product. In particular, ESI-MS analyses suggested that the latter was generated as a couple of isomeric compounds, with the OH linked either to the SH group arising from C-4=S tautomerization or to the methyl carbon (C-7) of S-4-TdR. Interestingly, the generation of a covalent dimer of S-4-TdR, characterized by the presence of a disulfide (S-S) bond, was also clearly inferred. The evolution of the cited products with reaction time was also be monitored using ESI-MS, confirming the role of hydroxylated S-4-TdR as an intermediate towards the generation of the ultimate product, TdR. The described processes make S-4-TdR a promising candidate as a molecular probe for the detection of H2O2 in PDT-related systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Because of the high cost of noble platinum-group metal (PGM) catalysts (Ir, Ru, Pt, etc.) that are widely used in water splitting, a PEMEC with low catalyst loadings and high catalyst utilizations is strongly desired for its wide commercialization. In this study, the ultrafast and multiscale hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) phenomena in an operating PEMEC is in-situ observed for the first time. The visualization results reveal that the HER and hydrogen bubble nucleation mainly occur on catalyst layers at the rim of the pores of the thin/tunable liquid/gas diffusion layers (TT-LGDLs). This indicates that the catalyst material of the conventional catalyst-coated membrane (CCM) that is located in the middle area of the LGDL pore is underutilized/inactive. Based on this discovery, a novel thin and tunable gas diffusion electrode (GDE) with a Pt catalyst thickness of 15 nm and a total thickness of about 25 mu m has been proposed and developed by taking advantage of advanced micro/nano manufacturing. The novel thin GDEs are comprehensively characterized both ex-situ and in-situ, and exhibit excellent PEMEC performance. More importantly, they achieve catalyst mass activity of up to 58 times higher than conventional CCM at 1.6 V under the operating conditions of 80 degrees C and 1 atm. This study demonstrates a promising concept for PEMEC electrode development, and provides a direction of future catalyst designs and fabrications for electrochemical devices.									79	1	0	0	2	0	79			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000430057000046

Numerous recent examples show that seemingly inert electrolyte components drastically influence the performance of catalytic centers. Even alkali metal cations in aqueous electrolytes at high pH values can change the reaction turnover frequency by orders of magnitude, depending on their nature, from Li+ to Cs+ Here, we use several electrodes, namely Pt(polycrystalline), Pt(111), Pt(221), Ir(111), Au(111), and Ag(poly-crystalline), in different alkali metal cation-containing electrolytes to reveal their role in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The HER activity trends of various Pt electrodes, irrespective of their surface structure, correlate with the hydration energy of the corresponding alkali metal cations present in the electrolyte (Li+> Na+ > K+ > Rb+ > Cs+). The trend remains the same for the Ir(111), however, it is reversed for Au(111) and Ag(pc) electrocatalysts.									61	3	0	0	3	0	61			2196-0216			WOS:000443381900002

MoS2 perpendicular to Ti3C2 offers a unique inorganic hybrid structure that allows increased exposure of catalytically active edge sites of MoS2, compared to pure MoS2 with a platelet-like morphology. The vertically aligned few-layer MoS2 sheets have an expanded interlayer spacing of 9.4 angstrom. The MoS2 perpendicular to Ti3C2 catalyst exhibited a low onset potential (-95 mV vs. RHE) for the HER and a low Tafel slope (approximate to 40 mV dec(-1)). This catalyst maintained a steady catalytic activity for the HER for over 20 hours.									99	9	0	0	4	0	101			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000445218000016

In this work, the well-arranged core/shell PSS-PPy/Ni-Co-P growing on Cu foil, in which Ni-Co-P is the core and the mixed polymer of pyrrole and sodium polystyrene sulfonate is the shell, has been demonstrated to be a highly efficient electrocatalyst for HER in neutral-pH electrolyte. The PSS-PPy/Ni-Co-P/CF self-supporting electrode was easily synthesized by electrodeposition and chemical deposition at room temperature. According to the experiment and DFT calculation results, PSS-PPy not only improves the conductivity and hydrophilicity of Ni-Co-P, but also optimizes the electronic structure of Ni-Co-P. Thus, the PSSPPy/Ni-Co-P shows remarkable HER activity with only overpotential of 106 and 67 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in neutral-pH and alkaline electrolytes, respectively. Furthermore, PSS-PPy/Ni-Co-P has excellent stability in neutral-pH, alkaline electrolytes and even seawater. The current surface modification method directs us to design more low-cost, high-efficiency and stable electrocatalysts for HER in neutral-pH electrolyte.									42	0	0	0	6	0	42			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000653229500227

FeP is a kind of highly effective and inexpensive non-noble-based HER catalyst but suffers from agglomeration and unstabilization during reaction. To solve these problems, we design a simple metal-organic-framework-derived method to synthesis N/P Co-doped carbon encapsulated ultrafine FeP nanoparticles (FeP@NPC), which exhibits outstanding activity and stability during HER. The optimized FeP@NPC presents excellent HER activity with an overpotential of 75 mV and 109 mV under the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH, separately, it also exhibits outstanding stability with negligible degradation for 70 h in both acid and alkaline solution. Such impressive HER performance of FeP@NPC is mainly ascribed to the ultrafine FeP nanoparticles and the N/P co-doped carbon, which provide more active sites during reaction. Moreover, the combination of FeP nanoparticles with N/P co-doped carbon protect the FeP nanoparticles from surface oxidization, making them highly stable under HER operation. The outcome of this research opens a versatile method for preparing highly active and stable noble-metal-free electrocatalysts for hydrogen production.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000807340600002

Its philosophy is that creative designs of high performance catalysts can be obtained from advanced understanding of catalysts selected by nature after billions of years of evolution, such as enzyme. A typical demonstration of such strategy is the developing of catalysts for large-scale hydrogen production. Hydrogenases due to their impressive performance in catalyzing hydrogen oxidation/production, have been selected as a prototype for human being's learning to achieve better design. Fully understand the structures of hydrogenases and their catalysis mechanisms are essential to reproduce and even outperform this prototype. This article reviews the computational efforts in recent years, focusing on density functional theory calculations on [NiFe] hydrogenases. It summarizes the current knowledge regarding the identification of active sites in [NiFe] hydrogenases and reaction cycles of hydrogen oxidation, followed with a brief collection and discussion of bio-inspired molecular catalysts derived from [NiFe] hydrogenase model. The capacity of computational calculations for the clarification of catalyst geometries and reaction mechanisms has been highlighted.This article is categorized under:Structure and Mechanism > Computational Biochemistry and BiophysicsStructure and Mechanism > Computational Materials ScienceStructure and Mechanism > Reaction Mechanisms and Catalysis									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1759-0876	1759-0884		WOS:000527394400003

The nanocrystalline alloys, prepared by melt spinning, were investigated towards the HER in 1 M KOH solution at 298 K. An electrochemical activation procedure (cyclic reduction-oxidation pre-treatment) was used to enhance the apparent HER activity. In case of the crystalline Ni-Mo-B master alloys the origin of the activity can mainly be attributed to an increase of the real surface area (roughening) caused by a dissolution of Mo-containing phases. Interestingly, a roughening of nanocrystalline Ni-Mo-B alloys did not occur, probably, because of the very homogenous and fine microstructure of these materials. The higher HER activity of the nanocrystalline Ni-Mo-B alloys is obviously caused by a higher intrinsic activity of the nanocrystalline Ni-Mo-B alloys and a synergistic effect of Mo.

In particular, using PEC cells to drive the water splitting reaction to obtain H-2 could provide a clean and sustainable route to convert solar energy into chemical fuels. Since the discovery of catalytic water splitting on TiO2 photoelectrodes by Fujishima and Honda, significant efforts have been directed toward developing high efficiency metal oxides to use as photocatalysts for this reaction. Improving the efficiency of PEC cells requires developing chemically stable, and highly catalytic anodes for the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER). This water oxidation half reaction requires four protons and four electrons coupling in two bond making steps to form O-2, which limits the rate.Our group has accelerated efforts in CuWO4 as a candidate for PEC OER chemistry. Its small band gap of 2.3 eV allows for using visible light to drive OER, and the reaction proceeds with a high degree of chemoselectivity, even in the presence of more kinetically accessible anions such as chloride, which is common to seawater. Furthermore, CuWO4 is a chemically robust material when subjected to the highly oxidizing conditions of PEC OER. The next steps for accelerating research using this (and other), ternary phase oxides, is to move beyond reporting the basic PEC measurements to understanding fundamental chemical reaction mechanisms operative during OER on semiconductor surfaces. In this Account, we outline the process for PEC OER on CuWO4 thin films with emphasis on the chemistry of this reaction, the reaction rate and selectivity (determined by controlled-potential coulometry and oxygen-detection experiments). We discuss key challenges with CuWO4 such as slow kinetics and the presence of an OER-mediating mid-gap state, probed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. We propose that this mid-gap state imparts the observed chemoselectivity of OER on CuWO4. We introduce insights into the chemical mechanism of PEC OER on CuWO4 using Tafel analysis of electrochemical polarization. We measure Tafel slopes of similar to 161 mV/dec, showing that PEC OER proceeds at a slower rate on CuWO4 than on common electrocatalysts for this reaction. Moreover, the observed photocurrent is independent of the borate buffer concentration, signaling that the buffer plays no role in the rate-determining elementary step of the reaction. Finally, we explore some recent developments in doping this material with Co (a known electrocatalytically active metal) and in coupling it with a transparent manganese phosphate (MnPO) electrocatalyst. We find that introducing Co into the wolframite structure leads to detrimental recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. However, coupling CuWO4 with MnPO increases the photocurrent density. Despite some of these challenges, CuWO4 proves to be a robust, visible light absorbing photoanode that can oxidize water with a high degree of selectivity and is therefore worthy of further exploration. Even if new compositions emerge that show better reactivity, this material serves as an excellent proving ground for the common challenges in developing ternary-phase oxides and other compositionally complex materials.									85	3	0	0	2	0	85			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000378470300006	27227377

(1982) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 682, 436]. The experiments reported here examine whether two subunits of PsbO, the manganese-stabilizing protein, bound to eukaryotic PSII play a role in protecting the OEC against OH- inhibition. The data show that the PSII binding properties of PsbO affect the pH optimum for O-2 evolution activity as well as the Cl- affinity of the OEC that decreases with an increasing pH. These results suggest that PsbO functions as a barrier against inhibition of the OEC by OH-. Through facilitation of efficient retention of Cl- in PSII [Popelkova, H., et al. (2008) Biochemistry 47, 12593], PsbO influences the ability of Cl- to resist OH--induced release from its site in the OEC. Preventing inhibition by OH- allows for normal (short) lifetimes of the S-2 and S-3 states in darkness [Roose, J. L., et al. (2011) Biochemistry 50, 5988] and for maximal steady-state activity by PSII. The data presented here indicate that activation of H2O oxidation occurs with a pK(a) of similar to 6.5, which could be a function of deprotonation of one or more amino acid residues that reside near the OEC active site on the D1 and CP43 intrinsic subunits of the PSII reaction center.									12	0	0	0	10	0	12			0006-2960			WOS:000303628200012	22512418

Using the faceted C/Re(11 (2) over bar1) surface as a template, we have successfully fabricated a nanostructured Pt monolayer (ML) electrocatalyst. The Pt ML supported on the C/Re nanotemplate exhibits higher activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction than Pt(111). This is the first application of faceted metal surfaces as templates for synthesis of nanoscale model electrocatalyst with well-defined (facet) surface structure and controlled (facet) size on the nanometer scale, illustrating the potential for future studies of nanostructured bimetallic systems relevant to electrocatalytic reactions.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000300757900048	22264090

ATCC 51142 temporary separates N-2 fixation from photosynthesis. To better understand the processes by which photosynthesis is regulated, we have analyzed Photosystem (PS) II O-2 evolution and the PSII lumenal proteins, especially the Mn stabilizing protein (MSP). We describe a procedure using glycine betaine to isolate photosynthetic membranes from Cyanothece sp, that have high rates of PSI and PSII activity. Analysis with these membranes demonstrated similar patterns of O-2 evolution in vivo and in vitro, with a trough at the time of maximal N-2 fixation and with a peak in the late light period. The pattern of PSI activity was also similar in vivo and in vitro. We cloned the genes for MSP (psbO) and the 12 kDa protein (psbU) and analyzed their transcriptional properties throughout the diurnal cycle. We suggest that the changes in PSII activity in Cyanothece sp. were due to conformational changes in a highly flexible MSP, a suggestion which can now be studied in a chimera. The Cyanothece sp. psbO gene has been transformed into Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803; MSP and O-2 evolution in the resulting transformant had properties that were similar to those in Cyanothece sp., providing additional confirmation for the properties of Cyanothece sp. MSP.

In the current study, we report cost-effective and easily synthesizable 2-thioureidobenzothiazole (BTT) metal complexes (M = Pd, Co, Ni) as dual and efficient electrocatalysts for HER and OER applications in acidic and alkaline conditions, respectively. The hybrid molecular catalysts were synthesized by integrating transition metal complexes with graphitized carbon cloth (GrCC) as the carbon support. The pristine Pd(ii)BTT complex exhibited enhanced hydrogen evolution activity with an applied overpotential value of 178 mV (vs. RHE) and a significantly lower Tafel slope value of 73.74 mV per decade in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The high catalytic activity of the Pd(ii)BTT complex can be ascribed to the strong affinity of the Pd metal ion towards H-2. The Ni(ii)BTT/GrCC hybrid catalyst for the HER exhibited an overpotential of 335 mV (vs. RHE) to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and was found to be superior vis-a-vis the pristine nickel complex. The enhanced catalytic activity of the hybrid catalyst is due to the conducting and porous nature of the graphitized carbon cloth. For OER activity, the pristine Ni(ii)BTT complex exhibited a very low overpotential value of 250 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and gave a low Tafel slope value of 93 mV per decade. The cost-effective and robust nickel complex as a novel electrocatalyst was found to be very effective for both HER and OER applications. This work paves the way for a new avenue to combine molecular catalysts with effective carbon supports for energy storage applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2633-5409		WOS:000851576500001

Herein, a novel designing strategy involving unique two-step chemical modifications on carbon support is proposed and examined for HER catalysis employing the metallic platinum as active species. The physicochemical characterization results shows that the carbon support suffering from oxidation pretreatment prior to adsorption of N-containing ligand molecules enables the highly uniform dispersion of Pt NPs and faster kinetics of electron transfer in comparison to the counterpart with reduction pretreatment. More importantly, the oxidation modification-involving carbon supported platinum catalyst (Pt/Ox-U-AB) displays a quite smaller difference of overpotentials (Delta eta similar to 24 mV) between in alkaline and acidic media at 10 mA cm(-2) than Pt/Red-U-AB (95 mV) and commercial 20% Pt /C (58 mV) under an equivalent amount of Pt loading (4 mu g Pt cm(geo)(-2)), implying much higher HER performance toward HER in alkaline media. Furthermore, the excellent HER performance of Pt/Ox-U-AB is also revealed by the higher ECSA value (2.51 cm(Pt)(2) mu g(Pt)(-1)) and mass activity (3.98 mA mu g(Pt)(-1)) than others. The superior HER performance of Pt/Ox-U-AB in alkaline media can be rationally attributed to the substantial exposure of electrochemically accessible active sites and favorable chemical environment on the catalyst surface endowed by the unique two-step modification involving oxidation pretreatment. The architecting strategy in this work offers a feasible way to design high-performance and cost-effective catalysts toward hydrogen evolution catalysis in alkaline media. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Nanoarray structures electrocatalysts have attracted increasing research interests due to its structural advantages. Herein, Ni3S2/Fe9S10 with two dimensions (2D) nanosheet arrays in-situ growth on three dimensions (3D) nickel foam (Ni3S2/Fe9S10@NF) was prepared by step-wise hydrothermal method. Ni3S2/Fe9S10@NF was derived from NiFe layered double hydroxides, and the as-prepared Ni3S2/Fe9S10@NF electrode was directly served as a bifunctional catalyst for electrolysis of water. Benefiting from the directly contact with conductive Ni foam substrate, the positive synergy effect between Ni and Fe in the Ni3S2/Fe9S10@NF catalyst and its open 3D porous structure, the binder-free and integrated Ni3S2/Fe9S10@NF electrode displayed excellent catalytic activities towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the overpotential for HER and OER are only 56 and 147 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Particularly, when the prepared Ni3S2/Fe9S10@NF further employed as both the cathode and anode electrocatalysts a symmetric cell Ni3S2/Fe9S10@NF vertical bar vertical bar Ni3S2/Fe9S10@NF, a low cell voltage of 1.43 V was achieved at 10 mA cm(-2), with good stability. This work not only illustrated that non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts have tremendous potential applications for electrocatalytic electrolysis of water but also provided a feasible strategy to prepare high-efficiency and stable non- precious metal catalysts.

Two critical issues involved in electrochem-ical reaction mechanism are investigated: 1) competing concerted and sequential proton-electron trans-fer pathways, 2) competing thermodynamics-controlled and kinetics-controlled pathways. Our results show that the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO and HCOOH adopts a thermodynamics-controlled CPET mechanism at low pH, while follows a kinetics-controlled SPET mechanism at high pH. The electrocatalytic activity and selectivity can be effectively modulated by manipulating of solution pH and electrode potential. It is demonstrated that HCOOH is the main product at low overpotential while CO becomes the main product at high overpotential. In addition, increasing pH is conducive to improving the Faradic efficiency of HCOOH production and suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

This reaction is energetically driven by sunlight and the active centre contains relatively cheap and abundant metals: manganese and calcium. This biological system therefore forms the paradigm for all man-made attempts for direct solar fuel production, and several studies are underway to determine the electronic and geometric structures of this catalyst. In this report we briefly summarize the problems and the current status of these efforts and propose a density functional theory-based strategy for obtaining a reliable high-resolution structure of this unique catalyst that includes both the inorganic core and the first ligand sphere.									54	0	0	0	24	0	55			0962-8436	1471-2970		WOS:000253117000010	17989003

For large-scale hydrogen production, it is great urgent to develop efficient and low-cost OER electrocatalyst candidates from commercial noble metal-based materials. Herein, a facile template method was proposed for the preparation of a series of hierarchical NiFeV hydroxide nanotubes. With the combined advantages of a hierarchical nanostructure and the synergistic effect among multi-metal elements, the ternary hydroxides delivered outstanding OER performance. In particular, a low overpotential of 256.5 mV delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 52.4 mV dec(-1) was achieved by hierarchical NiFeV hydroxide nanotubes with an initial Ni/Fe/V feed ratio of 8 : 1 : 1. After a subsequent topotactic transformation, ternary phosphide (denoted as NiFeVP) was obtained with the hierarchical nanostructure well maintained, and it achieved further performance enhancement where an overpotential of only 209.5 mV was required to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) with a lower Tafel slope of 30.3 mV dec(-1) and excellent durability for 50 h for chronopotentiometry even at 50 mA cm(-2), demonstrating an admirable OER electrocatalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000821544400001	35796250

But the synthesis of high-quality TMCs usually needs high energy consumption, long reaction times, or dangerous chemical reagents, limiting their practical application. Here, a microwave combustion method is developed to rapidly (similar to 2 min) produce transition metal carbides under ambient conditions. The as-synthesized TMCs (W2C, VC, Fe3C, NbC, TaC, and Mo2C) and rGO composites exhibit outstanding catalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) over a broad range of pH values. This work highlights a novel strategy for the design and synthesis of transition metal carbides.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000558928800024	32716470

In this study, a novel Er3+-CdS/MoS2 (ECMS) composite was synthesized, and the synergetic degradation effects for 17 beta-estradiol (17 beta-E2) during the sonophotocatalytic (SPC) process were investigated. The contribution of ROSs for eliminating 17 beta-E2 during the SPC process through quenching ex-periments was generally ranked in the following order: superoxide radical (center dot O-2(-)) approximate to hole (h(+)) > hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) > H2O2 > singlet oxygen (O-1(2)). center dot OH plays a crucial role in 17 beta-E2 removal by ECMS under sonocatalysis and photocatalysis conditions. The transformation process among ROSs was further analyzed and elucidated in the light of the probe measurement results with positive or negative correlation among ROSs. Besides, we observed a phenomenon that the generated concentration of center dot O-2(-) rises first and then falls during the SPC process, which might be attributed to the formation of O-1(2) via the oxidation of h(+) or recombination with center dot OH. This work clarifies the underlying mechanisms of sonophotocatalytic generation and transformation of ROSs in depth.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0959-6526	1879-1786		WOS:000771528300004

The main challenge arises from the serious partial loading issue when intermittent and unstable renewable energy is coupled to water electrolyzers. An energy storage device can mitigate this incompatibility between water electrolyzer and renewable energy sources. Herein, an AWE device driven by solar photovoltaic (PV) through a full cell of lithium-ion battery (LIB) as an energy reservoir is demonstrated (PV-LIB-AWE). Stable power output from LIB drives the water electrolyzer for steady hydrogen production, and thus overcomes the partial loading issue of AWE. Moreover, a multifunctional hierarchical material, porous nickel oxide decorated nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) support, with excellent electrochemical performances for LIBs, oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for the PV-LIB-AWE system is developed. Density functional theory calculations show that the strong interaction between metal oxide and NC tailors the electronic structure and then optimizes activation energy of OER process. PV-LIB-AWE integrated system demonstrated here offers an alternative approach to drive water electrolysis with intermittent renewable energy for a truly sustainable energy future.									29	1	0	0	2	0	30			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000530558200001

Constructing a hybrid system could lead to further improvement in electrocatalytic activity. Interface engineering in composite catalysts is thus critical to determine the performance, and the phase-junction interface should improve the catalytic activity. Here, we show that nickel diphosphide phase junction (c-NiP2/m-NiP2) is an effective electrocatalyst for hydrogen production in alkaline media. The overpotential (at 10 mA cm(-2)) for NiP2-650 (c/m) in alkaline media could be significantly reduced by 26 % and 96 % compared with c-NiP2 and m-NiP2, respectively. The enhancement of catalytic activity should be attributed to the strong water dissociation ability and the rearrangement of electrons around the phase junction, which markedly improved the Volmer step and benefited the reduction process of adsorbed protons.									47	1	0	0	2	0	47			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000588037600001	32964599

The mechanistic details of water oxidation have been investigated by the combined use of spectroscopy, electrochemistry, kinetic analysis, and computational studies. It was found that water oxidation proceeds via formal high-valent Ru-VII species. The capability of accessing such a high-valent state is derived from the non-innocent behavior of the anionic tridentate ligand frame which helps in accumulation of oxidative equivalents in cooperation with metal center. This metal-ligand cooperation facilitates the multi-electron-transfer reaction such as water oxidation. Kinetic analysis suggests water oxidation at a single site of Ru where O-O bond formation occurs via radical-radical coupling pathway between the oxygen atom of ruthenium-oxo species and the oxygen atom of the hydroxocerium(IV) ion.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000509420100057	31877037

The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a key process, still if conducted in alkaline media, its kinetics is slow thus requiring high amount of Pt based catalysts. Extensive research has been focused on reducing Pt utilization by pursuing careful electrode investigation. Here, a low-cost chemical methodology is reported to obtain large amount of microflowers made of interconnected NiO nanowalls (20 nm thick) wisely decorated with ultralow amounts of Pt nanoparticles. These decorated micro -flowers, dispersed onto graphene paper by drop casting, build a high performance HER electrode exhibiting an overpotential of only 66 mV at current density of 10 mA cm -2 under alkaline conditions. Intrinsic activity of catalyst was evaluated by measuring the Tafel plot (as low as 82 mV/dec) and turnover frequencies (2.07 s-1 for a Pt loading of 11.2 mg cm -2). The effect of Pt decoration has been modelled through energy band bending supported by electrochemical analyses. A full cell for alkaline electrochemical water splitting has been built, composed of Pt decorated NiO microflowers as cathode and bare NiO microflowers as anode, showing a low potential of 1.57 V to afford a current density of 10 mA cm -2 and a good long-term stability. The reported results pave the way towards an extensive utiliza-tion of Ni based nanostructures with ultralow Pt content for efficient electrochemical water splitting.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

J	Taylor, PR; Wang, W								A laboratory investigation of the reduction of chromium oxide by a reverse-polarity DC plasma-driven molten oxide electrolysis process								PLASMA CHEMISTRY AND PLASMA PROCESSING				22	3			387	400		10.1023/A:1015317116090				SEP 2002	2002	A method for producing chromium metal/chromium alloys using a reverse-polarity DC plasma-driven molten oxide electrolysis process was investigated. A laboratory-scale 50 kW DC plasma-crucible system was designed and built to investigate the feasibility of this process. Experiments on molten oxide electrolysis were successfully conducted to produce chromium metal from chromic oxide. Two starting slag systems, SiO2-CaO-Al2O3-Cr2O3-Na2O and SiO2-CaO-Cr2O3-Na2O, were used in this study. It was found that in each case chromic oxide was successfully reduced to metallic chromium. Aluminum was also reduced with the presence of alumina in the starting slag. Small amounts of carbon monoxide gas were introduced to the electrolysis system to study oxygen evolution rates from the plasma/slag interface. For the SiO2-CaO-Al2O3-Cr2O3-Na2O system, the oxygen evolution rate showed a maximum during the electrolysis process. For the SiO2-CaO-Cr2O3-Na2O system, the oxygen evolution rates displayed a declining trend with processing time. These two reduction behaviors were apparently controlled by different mechanisms. The significance of this process is that it might be used to produce carbon-free chromium metal/chromium alloys without carbon containing reducing agent and since no carbon based reactants are used for heating or reduction there are no carbon dioxide emissions.									6	0	0	0	0	0	7			0272-4324			WOS:000175366800004

Among various transition metal chalcogenides, tungsten disulfide (WS2) is a distinguishable candidate due to abundant active sites and good electrical properties. Herein, we report a facile and selective synthetic method to synthesize WS2 with an intriguing two-dimensional nanostructure by using cysteine (C3H7NO2S) as a chemical agent. In addition, nitrogen can be incorporated during chemical synthesis from cysteine, which may be helpful for enhancing the HER. The electrocatalytic activity of N-doped WS2 exhibits a promising HER in acidic conditions, which are not only higher than W18O49 nanowires and hex-WO3 nanowires, but also comparable to the benchmark Pt/C. Moreover, excellent electrocatalytic stability is also demonstrated for acidic HER during long-term tests, thus highlighting its potential use of practical applications as an electrolyzer.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6				2073-4344		WOS:000593529000001

A nanolayer of amorphous molybdenum sulfide (MoSx similar to 3), which has high catalytic activity in the electrochemical reaction of hydrogen evolution, is applied onto the surface of the obtained WSe2 films by pulsed laser deposition. It is shown that the composition of the WOy thin-film precursor has a significant effect on the morphology of the WSe2 nanolayers, and this characteristic largely determines the efficiency of hydrogen evolution by the MoS3/WSe2 heterostructure upon photoactivated water splitting. The most efficient hydrogen evolution is found for the MoS3/WSe2 photocathode heterostructure containing WSe2 in the form of crystal petals of similar to 50 nm in thickness, with these crystals oriented perpendicular to the substrate surface. A theoretical analysis of the possible effect of synergistic interaction at the MoS3/WSe2 interface on the efficiency of hydrogen evolution is carried out. Density functional theory calculations have shown that MoS3 clusters can increase the efficiency of the hydrogen evolution reaction upon contact with surface regions of WSe2 nanocrystals different in atomic packing.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2075-1133	2075-115X		WOS:000703969700001

It is generally recognized that catalysts with multi-transfer channels and varied active sites can energetically facilitate the ORR-relevant species transfer to improve the oxygen reduction rate. In this study, N-doped carbon nanotubes-crossed MoS2/carbon (N-MoS2/CNTs/C) catalysts are synthesized at temperatures of 600-900 degrees C using an in-situ reduction self-assembly method. In both acid (0.5 M H2SO4) and alkaline (0.1 M KOH) media, N-MoS2/CNTs/C (800 degrees C) catalyst exhibits a promising ORR activity and favors a four-electron reduction pathway. The highly-maintained tubular CNTs in N-MoS2/CNTs/C (800 degrees C) can supply the multidimensional pathways for transferring the ORR-relevant species. N atoms doping can not only increase the structural defects of MoS2 lattice (Mo-N-x) to expose more Mo-S-x sites, but also induce various N functional groups into the carbon matrix (CNTs and porous carbon), which are favorable to improve the activation, adsorption and reduction of oxygen. Therefore, the distinct structures endow the N-MoS2/CNTs/C catalysts with high activity towards ORR. Furthermore, the N-MoS2/CNTs/C (800 degrees C) also exhibits a promising ORR activity in neutral medium (microbial fuel cells (MFCs)). MFCs with the N-MoS2/CNTs/C (800 degrees C) cathode exhibits the maximum power density of 987.4 mW m(-2), which is much higher than that of commercial Pt/C (601.96 mW m(-2)). These results indicate that N-MoS2/CNTs/C catalysts can be considered as a promising alternative to Pt/C for ORR. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In sharp contrast, several forms of secondary defects consisting of dislocations, dislocation loops and precipitates were induced upon annealing at different temperatures in the 4.5 MeV implanted (100)Si sample. The isothermal evolution of the defects and reactions between dopants and defects were studied.

In this study, we designed a series of single molybdenum (Mo) atom-anchored porous two-dimensional Mo porphyrin (2D Mo-Pp) monolayers modified by B, C, O, P and S as efficient NRR catalysts to improve the catalytic performance. We introduced two key parameters, theta (p(z) orbital filling of heteroatoms) and phi (Bader charge of central Mo atoms). It shows that theta and phi play important roles in nitrogen absorption by analyzing the regression models. In particular, the theoretical results suggested that the 2D Mo-Pp monolayer modified by B has an ultralow limiting potential of 0.35 V and can suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction, making the 2D Mo-Pp monolayer modified by B a promising NRR electrocatalyst with high efficiency and selectivity. This work provides insights into the rational design of the elaborate structure of single-atom catalysts with tunable electrocatalytic activities.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000621595300013	33586741

In this study, the Prussian blue analogue-derived nitrogen-doped nanocarbon (NC) layer-trapped, cobalt-rich, core-shell nanostructured electrocatalysts (core-shell Co@NC) are reported. The electrode exhibits an improved oxygen evolution activity and stability compared to that of the commercial noble electrodes. The core-shell Co@ NC-loaded nickel foam exhibits a lower overpotential of 330 mV than that of IrO2 on nickel foam at 10 mA cm(-2) and has a durability of over 400 h. The commercial Pt/C cathode-assisted, core-shell Co@ NC-anode water electrolyzer delivers 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.59 V, which is 70 mV lower than that of the IrO2-anode water electrolyzer. Over the long-term chronopotentiometry durability testing, the IrO2-anode water electrolyzer shows a cell voltage loss of 230 mV (14%) at 95 h, but the loss of the core-shell Co@ NC-anode electrolyzer is only 60 mV (4%) even after 350 h cell-operation. The findings indicate that the Prussian blue analogue is a class of inorganic nanoporous materials that can be used to derive metal-rich, core-shell electrocatalysts with enriched active centers.									104	4	0	0	8	0	104			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000435713600012

Bimetallic alloying could modify the binding energy of metals at the alloy surface for optimum adsorption/desorption of reaction intermediates and an ultimately fast rate of the HER process. Here, a series of PdNi alloy film electrodes of varying thickness was prepared on a graphite substrate by directing the deposition time following a single-step aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition method. The structure and morphology of the deposited alloy films were characterized using X-ray, spectroscopic, and microscopy-based techniques. The results confirm the formation of a highly pure PdNi alloyed nanostructure. The electrocatalytic efficiency of the developed films was tested by monitoring the hydrogen evolution reaction under acidic conditions. The PdNi alloy film obtained after a 2 h deposition time demonstrated the best catalytic activity with an overpotential of only 20 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel value of 50.2 mV/dec, a small charge transfer resistance of just 1.2 Omega, and a high turnover frequency and J(exc) of 0.83 s(-1)@0.2 V and 10.69 mA cm(-2), respectively. The developed electrodes also demonstrated good chemical and mechanical stability for 22 h in a durability test operating at 100 and 200 mA cm(-2). The results are comparable to the state-of-the-art Pt-based HER catalyst investigated under similar circumstances. The remarkably increased electroactive sites on the bimetallic alloy with reasonable binding energies and synergistic interactions between the nanostructured PdNi alloy and the graphite support could cumulatively enhance the electrochemical activity for HER under employed conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000819248900001

RuO2 and IrO2 are known for their capabilities to catalyze the CER. Until now, the CER measurements have only been reported on well-defined RuO2 surfaces and only at high Cl- concentrations. We present the CER measurement and the role of Cl- at lower concentration on single-orientation RuO2(110) and IrO2(110) films. We find that RuO2(110) is two orders of magnitude more active than IrO2(110). Moreover, we observe the correlation between the CER activity and the O-ad formation potential on RuO2 and IrO2, supporting the prior suggestion that the O-ad is the active site for the CER. We further use the reaction order analysis to support the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism of the CER, which was previously suggested from the Tafel slope analysis. Our finding highlights the importance of the surface O-ad species on oxides for the CER electrocatalysis and suggests the electrochemical formation of Cl-ad on O-ad (for example, Cl- + O-ad <-> OClad + e(-)) as the crucial step in the CER electrocatalysis.

Even the most promising Li-O-2 cells are unsuitable for practical applications, owing to a limited areal mass loading below 1 mg cm(-2), resulting in low areal capacity. Here, we demonstrate air cathodes of unprecedentedly high areal capacity at a high rate with sufficient cycle life for pragmatic operation of Li-O-2 batteries. A separator-carbon nanotube (CNT) monolith-type cathode of massive loading is prepared to achieve high areal capacity, but the cycle life and round-trip efficiency of CNT-only separator monolith cathodes are limited. The reversible and energy-efficient operation at high areal capacity and a high rate is enabled by adopting RuO2/MnO2 solid catalysts on the CNT (RMCNT). RMCNTs show a bifunctional catalytic effect in both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and also completely decompose LiOH and Li2CO3 byproducts that may exist in discharged electrodes. This separator-RMCNT monolith offers beneficial features such as high mass loading, binder-free, intimate contact with the separator, and most importantly, catalysts for reversibility. Together, these features provide a remarkably long cycle life at unprecedentedly high capacity and high rate: 315, 45, and 40 cycles, with areal capacity limits of 1.5, 3.0, and 4.5 mAh cm(-2), respectively, at a rate of 1.5 mA cm(-2). Cycling is possible even at the curtailing capacity of 10 mAh cm(-2).									36	1	0	0	0	0	36			2155-5435			WOS:000430154100039

The shape of nickel structures is definitely dependent on the deposition potential, leading to different electrochemical surface area and edge facets. The nickel particle which has a polycrystalline center and edge is obtained at high negative potential. On the other hand, the nickel dendrite deposited by relatively low negative potential exhibits large electrochemical surface area and a particularly active facet for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline water electrolysis. In fact the nickel dendrite shows the highest catalytic activity and stability for HER among the various nickel structures.									123	4	0	0	2	0	124			0959-9428	1364-5501		WOS:000306215900050

However, the sluggish reaction kinetics make it essential to explore precious-metal-free electrocatalysts with superior activity and long-term stability. Tremendous efforts have been made in exploring electrocatalysts to reduce the energy barriers and improve catalytic efficiency.

The design strategies for optimizing the electronic and geometric structures of electrocatalysts with enhanced catalytic performance are discussed, including composition modulation, defect engineering, and structural engineering. Particularly, the advancement of operando/in situ characterization techniques toward the understanding of structural evolution, reaction intermediates, and active sites during the water splitting process are summarized. Finally, current challenges and future perspectives toward achieving efficient catalyst systems for industrial applications are proposed.

This paper outlines a new approach to synthesize Ni-Fe layered double hydroxides (Ni-Fe LDHs) for oxygen-evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we show that a dendrimer with carboxylate surface groups (generation 3.5) could react with Ni(II) ions to form a precatalyst for OER. During electrochemical OER, this precatalyst converted to Ni-Fe LDH, which is an efficient catalyst toward OER in the presence of Fe(III) ions. The catalyst was characterized by a number of methods and applied for OER using fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), Au, Pt, Ni foam, and glassy carbon electrodes. The catalyst shows a current density of 100 mA/cm(2) on the surface of the Ni foam, using only 297 mV overpotential and with the Tafel slope of 60.8 mV/decade. A current density of 50 mA/cm(2) on the surface of Au or Pt requires 333 and 317 mV overpotentials, respectively. The slopes of the Tafel plots for the catalyst on Au, GC, and Pt are 52.5, 47.1, and 37.4 mV/decade, respectively. The dendrimer resulted in a large dispersibility and an increase in active sites of Ni-Fe LDH, as well as the formation of Ni-Fe LDH.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000642344900069	33779157

In particular, Fe-based LDHs are distinguished candidates due to their high efficiency as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Herein, we have selected MgFe-based LDH phases as model systems in order to decipher whether Fe-clustering exerts an effect on the OER performance. For that, we have optimized hydrothermal synthesis by using triethanolamine (TEA) as the chelating agent. The magnetic characterisation allows us to identify the Fe-clustering degree by following both magnetic susceptibility as well as magnetization values at 2 K. Thanks to this, we demonstrated that TEA induces an increment in Fe-clustering. Electrochemical OER measurements show that both samples behave identically by using glassy carbon electrodes. Interestingly, when the samples are tested in the most commonly employed electrode, nickel foam, striking differences arise. The sample exhibiting a lower Fe-clustering behaves as a better electrocatalyst with a reduction of the overpotential values of more than 50 mV to reach 100 mA cm(-2), as a consequence of a favoured surface transformation of MgFe-LDHs phases into more reactive oxyhydroxide NiFe-based phases during the electrochemical tests. Hence, this work alerts about the importance of the electrocatalyst-electrode collector interactions which can induce misinterpretations in the OER performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000761277100001	35212688

In this paper, we will show that by preparing BDD as a composite, a new electrode material may be produced. To preparing such a composite, BDD and titanium (Ti) powders have been selected as the electrochemically active material and the matrix, respectively, and spark plasma sintering has been used as the fabrication procedure. Electrochemical tests proved that after an appropriate passivation, surface of the Ti matrix would acquire an insulating property, and the Ti-BDD composite as a whole would possess characteristics of a BDD material, including wide potential window, high oxygen evolution potential and low background current. Degradation tests conducted with glucose solution showed that the composite possessed also good electrochemical oxidation performance and chemical oxygen demand removal capability. Very importantly, accelerated life test proved that the composite as an anode material may have much longer lifetime than that of a BDD coating electrode produced by conventional chemical vapor deposition processes. All these preliminary experimental results suggested that Ti-BDD composite as a new anode material may have bright prospect in electrochemical applications.									10	3	0	0	1	0	12			0925-9635	1879-0062		WOS:000488305000018

J	Du, Yunmei; Li, Zijian; Liu, Yanru; Yang, Yu; Wang, Lei								Nickel-iron phosphides nanorods derived from bimetallic-organic frameworks for hydrogen evolution reaction								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				457				1081	1086		10.1016/j.apsusc.2018.06.167				NOV 1 2018	2018	It is impending but still a big challenge to design and synthesize electrocatalyst with typical nanostructure and efficient catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we report a low-temperature phosphorization process to synthesize nickel-iron bimetallic phosphides (NiFeP) using MIL-88-Fe2Ni MOF (metalorganic framework) as precursor. The as-synthesized NiFeP shows superior electrocatalytic performance with lower onset overpotential, smaller Tafel slope, bigger exchange current density and lower overpotential to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) than both NiP2 and FeP for HER in alkaline solution. The enhanced electrochemical activity may be attributed to the existence of the synergistic effect between NiP2 and FeP. SEM and TEM images show that the obtained NiFeP bimetallic phosphides preserve the size and morphology of the parent MIL-88-Fe2Ni MOF. And the prominent and stable performance of NiFeP nanorods for HER may also ascribes to the typical rod-like nanostructure with large specific surface area.									70	3	0	0	3	0	71			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000441872300126

Herein, we report manganese based layered double hydroxide (LDH) catalysts with different average oxidation states (AOS) of Mn. MgMnAl-LDH catalysts show large specific surface area, abundant oxygen vacancies, stable structure and excellent catalytic ozone decomposition performance. The valence state of Mn can be tuned by adjusting the metallic element ratio in the LDH matrix, and a catalyst with AOS of only 2.3 is acquired. The impacts of the valence states of Mn on the catalytic ozone decomposition process were further studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It is found that the Mn(2+)facilitates the desorption of generated oxygen on the surface of LDHs, while Mn(3+)and Mn(4+)contribute to the dissociation of adsorbed ozone.									7	1	0	0	2	0	8			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000545599900011	32538395

Among them, Fenton-type metal peroxide nanoparticles are exciting nanomaterials with intriguing physiochemical properties, yet the study of this antimicrobial agent is still in its infancy. Herein, a robust pH-responsive Fenton nanosystem is constructed by the assembly of copper peroxide nanodots in pomegranate-like mesoporous silica nanoshells (CuO2@SiO2) that are capable of self-supplying H2O2 and sustainably generating O-2. The enhanced antimicrobial performance is attributed to the pH responsiveness and excellent Fenton catalytic activity through either the Cu2+-catalyzed conversion of H2O2 to detrimental ROS under acid treatment or in situ O-2 evolution in neutral media. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo investigations demonstrate that this nanocomposite can exhibit boosted antimicrobial capabilities and can significantly accelerate skin wound closure, while retaining outstanding cytocompatibility and hemocompatibility. Given its excellent physicochemical and antimicrobial properties, the broad application of this nanocomposite in bacteria-associated wound management is anticipated.									14	0	0	0	6	0	14			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000655027500009	33973462

The presence of oxygen promotes the observed semiconductor powder oxidation of the substrate. Degradation of ASS in aerated dispersions of TiO2 needed about 24 h at 60 degrees C. Added H2O2 enhances the degradation rate considerably. As the pH increases, the H2O2 produced also increases. Also, peroxide production was observed as the concentration of TiO2 is increased owing to the availability of more surface states for the reaction. The Langmuir adsorption isotherm of ASS on TiO2 Degussa P-25 shows that ASS adsorbs readily on the TiO2 particles. The observed rate for H2O2 production decreased as the concentration of isopropanol (hole scavenger) is increased, suggesting an oxidative pathway as the main reaction responsible for H2O2 photoproduction. The degradation of ASS is a result of indirect action due to light mainly absorbed by TiO2. The experiments described here demonstrate the feasibility of dyestuff decomposition via semiconductor powders.									15	1	0	0	4	0	16			0730-7268	1552-8618		WOS:A1994PH80300004

Here, a mild hydrothermal-electrodeposition two-step route is designed for the preparation of Ce-doped Ni-S@NiMoO4 micropillar composites on nickel foam (CeNiS@NiMoO4/NF). The as-constructed CeNiS@NiMoO4/NF electrode shows an ultralow overpotential, fast kinetics, superb intrinsic activity and excellent long-term stability for the OER. In 1 M KOH solution, 187 mV overpotential is required to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 35.28 mV dec(-1), and in a saline-alkaline solution of 1 M KOH and 0.5 M NaCl, only 260 mV overpotential is needed to reach 100 mA cm(-2), demonstrating its excellent OER performance. The above outstanding electrocatalytic activity is attributed to the influence of CeNiS nanosheets on the surface microstructure of NiMoO4 micropillars, which not only improves the conductivity of the catalyst, but also increases the surface area, as well as accelerates the escape of gases produced. Compared with other non-precious metal OER electrocatalysts, the as-prepared CeNiS@NiMoO4/NF presents stronger or close electrocatalytic activity and better durability, which provides a new electrocatalyst selection in practical applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000721887300001	34816851

But its discharge product Li2O2 is difficult to be oxidized back in the charge process, which causes high charge overpotential, serious electrolyte decomposition and poor cyclability. An effective way to solve this problem is adding redox mediator (RM) in the electrolyte to catalyze the charge reaction via redox shuttle process. However, the reaction kinetics between the oxidized BM and Li2O2 is seldom reported. Here, taking iodine species as the model RM, we find that the efficiency of the solution phase catalysis is limited by the reaction rate between the oxidized RM and Li2O2, which is largely dependent on the electrolyte solvent. Protic solvents, such as water and alcohols lead to high reaction rate because of the hydrogen bond-assisted solvation of Li2O2. However, too high proton activity may also bring unwanted peroxide disproportionation. Among a series of alcohols, n-butanol is found to show proper proton activity and significantly promote the efficiency of the redox shuttle process. To prove the electrochemical mechanisms, this paper also introduces a Li2O2-graphite cell to evaluate the reversibility of cathodic reaction. Comparing with conventional cycling tests with excess lithium metal anode, the Li2O2-graphite configuration can eliminate the "fake reversible capacity" caused by parasitic cathodic reactions, and thus is more reliable.									71	8	0	0	5	0	75			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000390636100006

Although these processes are crucial for achieving high energy densities, their structural origins are not yet fully understood. Here, we explore the use of annular bright-field (ABF) imaging in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) to measure oxygen distortions in charged Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2. We show that ABF STEM data can provide positional accuracies below 20 pm but this is restricted to cases where no specimen mistilt is present, and only for a range of thicknesses above 3.5 nm. The reliability of these measurements is compromised even when the experimental and post-processing designs are optimised for accuracy and precision, indicating that extreme care must be taken when attempting to quantify distortions in these materials.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			0304-3991	1879-2723		WOS:000522150200011	31811959

Reduction of a dicobalt(III, III) core ligated by the polypyridyl ligand dipyridylethane naphthyridine (DPEN) by two electrons and subsequent protonation result in the release of one water moiety to furnish a dicobalt(II, II) center with an open binding site. This reduced core may be independently isolated by chemical reduction. Variable-temperature H-1 NMR and SQUID magnetometry reveal the reduced dicobalt(II, II) intermediate to consist of two low spin Co(II) centers coupled antiferromagnetically. Binding of O-2 to the open coordination site of the dicobalt(II, II) core results in the production of an oxygen adduct, which is proposed to be a dicobalt(III, III) peroxo. Electrochemical studies show that the addition of two electrons results in cleavage of the O-O bond.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000443172000019	29942938

The SCIEC interface affects the composite photoelectrode behavior but is poorly understood. We uncover the role of EC activity and SCIEC interface properties using a range of metal (Ni, Fe, Ni Fe, Co, Ir) oxide or (oxy)hydroxide ECs deposited on model single-crystal n-TiO2 photoanodes. The impedance and photoelectrochemical response of the system was nearly independent of EC oxygen evolution activity if the catalyst was deposited electrochemically as an ion-permeable (oxy)hydroxide or hydrous oxide. When dense oxides (e.g., ion-impermeable) ECs were used, the response depended strongly on the EC. These data demonstrate that the EC and SC interface structures are more important than the EC activity in determining the composite photoanode response, confirming recent SCIEC interface simulations for ion-permeable ECs. These results thus inform the design of high-performance water-oxidizing photoanodes with direct SCIEC interfaces.									52	0	0	0	2	0	52			1948-7185			WOS:000357626700004	26266713

This studyexamined photonic and catalytic effects in bismuth vanadatephotoanodes coupled with a photonic crystal and oxygen evolutioncatalyst to enhance light energy conversion. A bilayer photoanodewas fabricated by depositing a TiO2inverse opal (i-TiO2-o) withvarious stopbands, replicated from polystyrene opals assembledfrom 227, 282, and 305 nm spheres, on top of a thin Mo-dopedBiVO4film. To assess photonic effects, the photoelectrochemicalbehavior was examined in the presence of sulfite sacrificial holescavenger. An average gain in excess of twofold in the visible photon-to-current conversion efficiency was measured with i-TiO2-ohaving a stopband to the red of or coinciding with BiVO4absorbance. The effects of a heterojunction with TiO2and of disorder andthe open structure were interrogated using a non-scattering nc-TiO2layer or a disordered TiO2inverse photonic glass (i-TiO2-g282)having the same air hole size as i-TiO2-o282, and neither was found to cause the gain. The periodicity was found to be key to enhancethe photocurrent, and the gain is attributed to light trapping in different parts of the structure, increasing absorbance of bismuthvanadate coupled to the inverse opal. i-TiO2-o282on top of Mo:BiVO4also enhanced water photooxidation in borate buffer but to alesser extent than with sulfite as the kinetics of oxygen evolution remains the predominant limitation. After modification withNi(Fe)-oxo/hydroxo complex in borate (termed NiBi), the gain in the photon-to-current conversion efficiency reached twofold atthe bilayer relative to the parent Mo:BiVO4. Photocurrents increased at low and high bias, which may be caused by reducedrecombination and catalytic reactivity after hole transfer to the co-catalyst. Improved light harvesting upon coupling to the photoniccrystal with a hole scavenger in solution or the oxygen evolution reaction catalyst on the surface was the highest for bismuthvanadatefilms that exhibited initially low light-to-current conversion efficiency, presenting a unique promise for thinphotoelectrodes.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000797817500006

The coating consisted of MnO, Mn5C2, Mn15C4 and Mn23C6 was formed on the surface of CNTs by heating a mixture of Mn particles and CNTs at 600 degrees C for 40 min under vacuum, Then after heated MnO/MnCx/CNTs in air at 350 degrees C for 2 h, MnO nanoparticles were partially converted to Mn3O4 nanosheets. Then Mn3O4-MnCx coated carbon nanotubes (Mn3O4/MnCx/CNTs) composed of interconnected nanosheets structure were successfully synthesized by a two-step method of one-pot deposition and heat posttreatment. The Mn3O4/MnCx/CNTs showed better oxygen reduction reaction performance in alkaline condition than MnO/MnCx/CNTs and pristine CNTs. Besides, the formed MnCx (Mn5C2 and Mn23C6) by one-pot deposition method provided a strong interface bonding between Mn3O4 and CNTs, leading to improved stability of Mn3O4/MnCx/CNTs as an electrode material.

The optimized sulfurated catalyst demonstrates excellent electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in both acid and alkaline media. The sulfurization process under optimized conditions can lower the ORR over-potential by ca. 170 mV at 3 mA cm(-2), giving a non-precious metal catalyst with an onset ORR potential of 0.90 V (vs. RHE, similarly hereinafter)/half-wave potential of 0.78 V in 0.1 M HClO4 and an onset ORR potential of 0.98 V/half-wave potential of 0.88 V in 0.1 M KOH. Furthermore, the S-doped porous carbon materials perform better in the long-term durability test than the non-S-doped samples and standard commercially available Pt/C. We also discuss different sulfuration methods for the ZIF system, morphologies of pyrolyzed samples, and catalytically active sites.									50	2	0	0	1	0	50			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000372190800017

Therefore, it is essential to develop a non-precious, stable and highly efficient electrocatalyst. Nickel and cobalt sulphide have gained much attention as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts due to their pH stability, low cost and high activity. But the application of these sulphides is limited due to high over-potentials, low surface area and less catalytic active sites available for HER. Furthermore, Nickel and cobalt sulphide can be coupled with different functional components to enhance their catalytic activity. This comprehensive review focuses on the progress made so far to enhance the electrochemical properties of nickel and cobalt sulphides and their composites with various active mate- rials.

The main discharge pulse dissociates molecular oxygen and the second pulse, shorter than the main one, excites atoms during the stationary afterglow. The recombination probability is determined from the atomic oxygen density decay during the stationary afterglow of the main pulse (MP). The oxygen atoms are detected by time-resolved optical emission spectroscopy. In order to correlate the oxygen emission lines with the oxygen atom density, argon is used as an actinometer. To scan the whole afterglow of the main discharge pulse, the delay of the probe pulse is uniformly increased in every period following the MP. The evolution of the relative 0 atom density is deduced from the 0 emission lines at 777 and 844 nm and from the Ar actinometry line at 750 nm. The wall recombination probability gamma on a Pyrex surface ranges from 4.0 x 10(-4) to 1.6 x 10(-2) for wall temperatures from 77 to 460 K.									83	0	0	0	0	0	83			0963-0252			WOS:000222016700009

This modulation can also be achieved through stabilization of metastable or non-native polymorphs of the electrocatalyst. Non-native (NN) crystal structures differ in their discrete translational symmetry from the bulk native (N) crystal. The variable oxygen evolution reactivity in a basic medium of different polymorphs is demonstrated by synthesizing beta/N-, gamma/N-NN1-, r/NN1-, alpha/NN2-, and delta/NN3-MnO2 polymorphs of MnO2 which show different active site densities on the surface, XPS-derived oxidation state of Mn, and bulk electronic conductivity. The specific OER activity [activity per electrochemical surface area (ECSA)] of MnO2 is co-dependent on the oxidation state of Mn and electronic conductivity. A volcano-based relationship is observed for the specific OER activity of MnO2 polymorphs with the universal descriptor Delta G(O)* - Delta G(HO)*, computed from density functional theory (DFT). Both delta/NN3-MnO2 and alpha/NN2-MnO2 lie closer to the volcano peak but on opposite legs of the volcano. delta/NN3-MnO2 shows higher specific activity due to its low oxidation state (+3.5) of Mn, which is confirmed through the calculated average oxidation states (AOS) from XPS and Bader charge from DFT studies. alpha/NN2-MnO2 shows higher specific activity due to higher electronic conductivity, which is correlated with its low oxygen vacancy formation energy. Further, the electronic origin of high OER activity in two of the most non-native polymorphs (delta/NN3-MnO2 and alpha/NN2-MnO2) is ascribed to a shift in the valence Mn-d band closer to the Fermi level leading to stronger O adsorption. The present study demonstrates the efficacy of utilizing non-native polymorphs for OER and unfolds the correlation between OER and variable oxidation states and electronic conductivities, thereby providing directions toward the generalization of these effects to other polymorphic compounds.									24	1	0	0	2	0	24			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000486360900053

As the electrochemical oxidation progressed, the Ni and Cr atoms in the Fe medium moved via the synergetic effect of electromigration and drag force, creating a Ni-rich surface on the electrodes with fast kinetics for the hydrogen evolution reaction. This study investigated the optimal duration of electrochemical oxidation affecting the cation contribution of Cr, which forms a passivation layer with high charge transfer resistance on the electrode. Electrochemical oxidation for 60 min induced a significant enhancement in the electrochemical catalytic activity as the cation contribution of Cr decreased.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000552618700005

Nanosheet arrays of cobalt (II) hydroxide were firstly formed on nickel foam via electrodeposition which is further phosphatized to form defect-rich porous CoP nano sheets. The as-prepared CoP nanosheets exhibit high activity as a catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction, and the overpotentials of generating a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) are 79.5 mV and 86.6 mV in acidic and basic electrolytes, respectively. In addition, the as prepared CoP nanosheet catalyst shows excellent stability in acidic electrolyte, and no obvious degradation was observed at 10 mA cm(-2) for 50 h. The high activity is attributed to the unique three dimensional structure of the material as well as the metalloid characteristics of CoP. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Bottles were stored at room temperature (20 degrees C) under artificial light. Volatile compounds in orange juice samples and corresponding packaging materials were analysed at zero time and after 2, 3 and 5 months of storage. After 5 months of storage, from 0.2 to 0.3% of the initial amounts of limonene and beta-myrcene in the orange juice had been absorbed by the plastic packaging materials. Statistical analyses showed that the evolution of aroma compounds was strongly correlated to the duration of storage, but not to the type of packaging material. Indeed, whatever the stored orange juice samples, the same evolutions were observed, with a decrease in aldehydes and ketones, esters, aliphatic alcohols, sesquiterpene and monoterpene alcohols, and an increase in two aliphatic and monoterpene alcohols (i.e. furfural and 4-vinylguaicol). The results suggest that the losses of aroma compounds from the juice could be attributed to the high acidity of the matrix, implying acid-catalysed reactions. Finally, PET packaging materials and their corresponding oxygen permeabilities showed no correlation with the loss of aroma compounds.									27	5	0	0	16	0	32			1944-0049			WOS:000228182200013	15824008

In this study, the MoNx thin layer is synthesized on to a high-surface area three-dimensional (3D) nickel foam (NF) substrate using atomic layer deposition (ALD) for HER catalysis. MoNx is grown on NF by the sequential exposure of Mo(CO)(6) and NH3 at 225 degrees C. The thickness of the thin film is controlled by varying the number of ALD cycles to maximize the HER performance of the MoNx/NF composite catalyst. The scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of MoNx/NF highlight that ALD facilitates uniform and conformal coating. TEM analysis highlights that the MoNx film is predominantly amorphous with the nanocrystalline MoN grains (4 nm) dispersed throughout it. Moreover, the high-resolution (HR)-TEM analysis shows a rough surface of the MoNx film with an overall composition of Mo0.59N0.41. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth-profile analysis reveals that oxygen contamination is concentrated at the surface because of surface oxidation of the MoN film under ambient conditions. The HER activity of MoNx is evaluated under acidic (0.5 M H2SO4) and alkaline (0.1 M KOH) conditions. In an acidic electrolyte, the sample prepared with 700 ALD cycles exhibits significant HER activity and a low overpotential (eta) of 148 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Under an alkaline condition, it achieves 10 mA cm(-2) with eta of 125 mV for MoNx/NF (700 cycles). In both electrolytes, the MoNx thin film exhibits enhanced activity and stability because of the uniform and conformal coating on NF. Thus, this study facilitates the development of a large-area 3D freestanding catalyst for efficient electrochemical water-splitting, which may have commercial applicability.									31	3	0	0	1	0	32			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000468364500021	31012567

Especially, OER in acidic solutions is crucial since it produces high current densities and avoids precipitation of carbonates. However, even the acid stable iridates undergo severe dissolution during the OER. BaIrO3 has the strongest IrO6 connectivity and stable surface structure, yet it suffers from lattice collapse after OER cycling, making it difficult to improve the OER durability. In the present study, we have successfully developed an OER catalyst with both high intrinsic activity and stability under acidic conditions by preventing the lattice collapse after repeated OER cycling. Specifically, we find that the substitution of Ir-site with Mn for BaIrO3 in combination with OER cycling leads to a remarkable activity enhancement by a factor of 28 and an overall improvement in stability. This dual enhancement of OER performance was accomplished by the novel strategy of slightly increasing the Ir-dissolution and balancing the elemental dissolution in BaIr1-xMnxO3 to reconstruct a rigid surface with BaIrO3-type structure. More importantly, the mass activity for BaIr0.8Mn0.2O3 reached similar to 73 times of that for IrO2, making it a sustainable and promising OER catalyst for energy conversion technologies.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2046-2069		WOS:000844802100001	36128544

However, in alkaline electrolytes, the slow kinetics of water splitting leads to poor HER activities. In this study, we describe the preparation of a hybrid material consisting of cobalt oxide (CoO) decorated on nitrogen-doped MoS2 supported on carbon fibers (CoO/N-MoS2/CF) through a two-step process combining hydrothermal technique and electrochemical deposition. The electrochemical properties of the CoO/N-MoS2/CF electrocatalyst were assessed in alkaline medium. The results revealed that CoO/N-MoS2/CF exhibits excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for the HER and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The CoO/N-MoS2/CF delivered a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of only 78 mV for the HER and a current density of 50 mA/cm(2) at 458 mV for the OER in 1.0 M KOH, performing better than many noble metal-free electrocatalysts. The enhanced catalytic properties of the hybrid nanomaterial could be ascribed to its hierarchical structure, and increased number of active sites, as well as the synergetic cooperation between its different components. Additionally, the CoO/N-MoS2/CF nanomaterial was investigated as both cathode and anode for full water splitting in 1.0 M KOH. The water electrolyzer delivered a maximum current density of 53 mA cm(-2) at an applied cell voltage of 1.5 V, which is very favorable for overall water-splitting applications.									41	2	0	0	1	0	42			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000484831100033	31402641

Herein, a green, facile, and time-efficient Ru doping synergistic with air-plasma treatment strategy is reported to boost the HER performance of CoNi-layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanotube arrays (NTAs) derived from zeolitic imidazolate framework nanorods. The Ru doping and air-plasma treatment not only regulate the oxygen vacancy to optimize the electron structure but also increase the surface roughness to improve the hydrophilicity and hydrogen spillover efficiency. Therefore, the air plasma treated Ru doped CoNi-LDH (P-Ru-CoNi-LDH) nanotube arrays display superior HER performance with an overpotential of 29 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, by assembling P-Ru-CoNi-LDH as both cathode and anode for two-electrode urea-assisted water electrolysis, a small cell voltage of 1.36 V is needed at 10 mA cm(-2) and can last for 100 h without any obvious activity attenuation that showing outstanding durability. In general, the P-Ru-CoNi-LDH can improve the HER performance from intrinsic electronic structure regulation cooperated with extrinsic surface wettability modification. These findings provide an effective intrinsic and extrinsic synergistic effect avenue to develop high performance HER electrocatalysts, which is potential to be applied to other research fields.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000714598700001	34738715

Herein, hierarchical urchin-like NiCoO2@N-C nanospheres assembled with mesoporous nanorods are reported as high-energy cathode materials to simultaneously satisfy the requirements of supercapacitors and zinc-ion batteries. Results show that the optimisation of annealing temperature in NiCoO2@N-C products can significantly adjust the composition, electronic structure and generate abundant oxygen vacancies. Benefiting from these merits, the as-synthesised NiCoO2@N-C electrode delivers excellent capacity (418 C g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)) and long cycle performance (81% after 5000 cycles). Moreover, our fabricated NiCoO2@N-C//Zn battery presents an impressive specific capacity of 323 mAh g(-1) and energy density of 226.1 Wh kg(-1). The energy storage and conversion mechanisms are also explored using the X-ray Absorption Fine Structure, in-situ Raman spectroscopy and ex-situ X-ray diffraction, probing subtle structural evolution of electrode materials during charge and discharge processes. This work may open a new avenue to design the nanomaterials with adjustable surface defects to accelerate various electrochemical reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000762843200003

Usually, expensive, complex, time-consuming methods are applied to prepared suitable electrocatalysts for the OER. In contrast, a single-step thermal method is simple and inexpensive. Nickel and iron-based composite materials are potential candidates as OER catalysts. Accordingly, herein, Se-doped Fe2O3-decorated Ni/NiO particles on carbon cloth (Se-Fe2O3@Ni/NiO/CC) were synthesized via a facile and scalable one-step thermal method. The individual Se-Fe2O3@Ni/NiO particles were accommodated in holes in the carbon fibers of CC. The optimized Se-Fe2O3@Ni/NiO/CC-2 sample exhibited an outstanding OER performance with an overpotential of 205 mV at the current density 10 mA cm(-2), small Tafel slope of 36 mV dec(-1), and good stability in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. The outstanding catalytic performance was mainly attributed to the heterointerfaces between Se-Fe2O3 and Se-Ni/NiO. Moreover, the accommodation of the Se-Fe2O3@Ni/NiO particles in the holes of CC restricted the aggregation of the particles, and CC provided a conductive substrate for the OER process. Thus, this work provides a simple, scalable and effective strategy for designing and engineering of outstanding electrocatalysts for the OER.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000590136500013	33124630

Being highly abundant and cost-effective, 3d transition-metal-based catalysts show promising activities in alkaline conditions. In this work, bimetallic nickel-cobalt carbonate hydroxide hydrate (NiCo-CHH) was prepared by a co-precipitation method with varying molar ratios of Ni/Co of 0.5:1, 1:1, and 1.5:1, which were analyzed for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) study in both alkaline (1 M KOH) and near-neutral (1 M NaHCO3) media. For OER in 1 M KOH, NiCoCHH 1:1 required overpotential of just 238 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) current density compared to other ratios of 0.5:1 and 1.5:1, which required 290 and 308 mV, respectively. Similarly, in 1 M NaHCO3, NiCoCHH 1:1 required an overpotential of 623 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2). A post-OER study confirmed the formation of NiOOH during OER The observed faradaic efficiency was nearly 95.21% for the NiCoCHH 1:1 catalyst. A two-electrode setup with NiCoCHH 1:1 parallel to Pt required just 312 mV as an overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2). These kinds of comparative studies can be used in other 3d transition-metal-based catalysts for OER in the future.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000592794400057	33103426

Here, Ni-Fe-W hydroxide complex by incorporation of tungsten into nickel-iron layered double hydroxide was proposed and investigated. As-formed Ni-Fe-W hydroxide nanosheets are highly porous and self-supported on the carbon fiber substrates, which promote the exposure of the active metal sites for significantly enhanced OER activity. Moreover, the as-introduced tungsten is evidenced to be in a W6+ oxidation state which can facilitate charge transfer and electron capture and thereby decrease the critical conversion barrier of the absorbed OH- to O radical in OER. A series of Ni-Fe-W hydroxides were prepared, with the best molar ratio of Ni-Fe-W sources being 6:2:1. The optimal Ni6Fe2W-LDH@carbon fiber electrode delivers a low overpotential of 264 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and high stability (only 1.6% of the potential increase after 10 h) in alkaline electrolyte. Moreover, the structure of the constructed Ni-Fe-W hydroxide is evidenced to be stable and important for the electrocatalytically stable. The study is expected to open a new avenue in developing multiple hydroxides for low-cost and efficient electrocatalysts.									20	2	0	0	0	0	20			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000489676400065	31507157

RDE experiments often make use of or require collection and, quantification of gaseous products. The combination of rotating parts and gaseous analytes makes the design of RDE cells that allow for heaclspace analysis, challenging due to gas leaks at the interface of the tell body and the rotator. In this manuscript we describe a new, hermetically sealed electrochemical cell that allows for electrode rotation while-simultaneously providing a gastight environment. Electrode rotation in this new cell design is controlled by magnetically coupling the working electrode to a rotating magnetic driver. Calibration of the RDE using a tachometer, shows that the rotation speed of the,electrode is the same as that of the magnetic driver: To, validate the performance of this cell for hydrodynamic measurements, limiting currents from the reduction of a potassium ferrocyanide (K-4[Fe(CN)(6)]center dot 3H(2)O) were measured and shown to compare favorably with calculated values from the Levich equation and, with data obtained using more typical, nongastight RDE cells. Faradaioefficiencies of similar to 95% were measured in the gas phase for oxygen evolution in alkaline media at an Inconel 625 alloy electrocatalyst during rotation at 1600 rpm. These data verify that a gastight environment is maintained even during rotation.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000391346600040	28105829

In this context, SACs for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a rapidly emerging field, and intense research has been devoted to rationally develop low-cost, high-performing, and durable SACs for HER. In the meantime, consistent efforts have also been made to gather insights on the geometric and electronic structures of SACs when anchored on appropriate support for HER and their subsequent structural transformation, active sites, and reaction mechanisms. Herein, we present a comprehensive and critical review that starts with an in-depth discussion on the three key aspects of SACs (stabilization, metal-support interaction, and coordination environment) and focuses on the significant contribution of support to favorably influence net HER efficiency. Further, we describe the importance of numerous support modification techniques along with concrete examples of the most frequently and widely used supports. We elaborate on various synthetic and in-situ (ex-situ) characterization techniques adapted in the field of HER electrocatalysis, discuss their activity trend, and highlight their understanding in terms of structure-activity-property relationships. Finally, the key challenges and prospects in employing SACs for electrocatalytic HER as well as guiding principles for fabricating intriguing SACs to acquire exceptional reactivity and stability have been underlined.

Herein, the syntheses of the known 2D alpha- and beta-PdSeO3 were improved. The bulk materials were exfoliated into nanosheets using an ultrasonic-assisted liquid-phase exfoliation similar to that of preparing graphene nanosheets. Their band-gaps, valence band maximums (VBMs) and conduction band minimums (CBMs) were determined using MottSchottky plots and the linear potential scan method in acidic aqueous solution, 0.2 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution and non-aqueous solution. Their transient photocurrent properties were also examined, along with their Electrochemical Impedance Spectra (EIS). The bulk materials are stable in pH = 0-14 value water solution for at least 48 h. alpha- and beta-PdSeO3 nanosheets exhibit moderate catalytic activities for hydrogen evolution reactions in 0.5 M H2SO4 (.10 (overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2): 185 and 209 mV, respectively; catalyst loading: 0.28 mg cm(-2)), much better than the performances of the bulk materials. In addition, beta-PdSeO3 bulk and nanosheets materials show good and similar OER catalytic activities in 0.5 M H2SO4 (eta(10): 381 and 405 mV, respectively; catalyst loading: 0.28 mg cm(-2)). Thus, beta-PdSeO3 nanosheets were found to be a good overall water splitting catalyst in acidic solution. The above catalysts all show long-term stability. In contrast, alpha-PdSeO3 does not have OER catalytic property. To our knowledge, Pd-based acidic overall water splitting catalysts are very rare.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000637295600006

The as-prepared Ni-Se/NF samples demonstrate different phase, composition and surface morphology through physical characterization. XRD and SEM indicate that Ni-Se growing in water demonstrates mixed crystal phases of NiSe and Ni3Se2 with nanorod-like nanostructures, whereas samples Ni-Se prepared in DMF and ethanol are pure NiSe phase with nanoneedle-like nanostructures. Electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of all samples has been evaluated in alkaline solution. NiSe/NF (ethanol) demonstrates the smallest overpotential (170.5 mV) to reach j = -10 mA cm(-2) for HER and excellent long-term stability. The enhancement of electrocatalytic activity in alkaline solution may be ascribed to its good conductivity and large electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, phase-controlled cobalt phosphide nanoparticles encapsulated in a nitrogen-doped graphitized carbon shell (termed CoxP@NC) were prepared by hydrogen reduction of organic-inorganic cobalt phosphonate hybrid materials with different Co/P molar ratios. Compared with the synthesized pure-phase CoP@NC and Co-2 P@NC, the hybrid-phase CoP/Co2P@NC exhibits enhanced HER activity at all-pH values, affording low overpotentials of 126 mV (0.5 M H2SO4, pH = 0), 198 mV (1.0 M KOH, pH = 14), and 459 mV (1.0 M PBS, pH = 7) to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The high activity is ascribed to the doping of the N atom, enough accessible electrocatalytic active boundary sites, and synergistic interaction among the components, especially the electronic effect of CoP and Co2P. Additionally, the unique core-shell structure of CoP/Co2P@NC efficiently prevents the agglomeration and corrosion of metallic cores during the HER and consequently endows it high stability and durability. This study not only offers us an efficient electrocatalyst for HER at all-pH but also opens a novel strategy to synthesize core-shell catalysts for various applications.									57	5	0	0	1	0	57			2168-0485			WOS:000467351200105

This work presents a bifunctional electrocatalyst consisting of RuFe nanoparticles embedded in high-surface-area nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon (RuFe@NC). The RuFe@NC-900 catalyst exhibits a specific surface area (677 m(2) g(-1)), pore diameter (9.52 nm), and high pore volume (0.3 cm(3) g(-1)). The catalyst displays high oxygen reduction and evolution reaction activity and exhibited excellent bifunctional activity (Delta E) of 0.73 V vs RHE compared to the benchmark catalyst, 40 wt % Pt/C + RuO2 substantiates the excellent catalytic activity as an oxygen electrode. The excellent bifunctional activity is attributed to the synergistic effect arising from RuFe@NC type sites, and the high electrical conductivity of the support material was key to tuning the catalytic activity. The potential practical application is further demonstrated by using it as an air cathode for rechargeable metal-air batteries. The Li-O-2 battery constructed with the optimized RuFe@NC-900(5h) cathode exhibited robust reversibility with negligible discharge voltage loss. As a result, the discharge-specific capacity of 11,129 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 100 mA g(-1) shows a practical approach to explore the high-rate capability by constructing optimal cathode electrodes. In addition, the rechargeable zinc-air battery with RuFe@NC-900(5h) as a bifunctional catalyst exhibits high activity and stability during battery discharge, charge, and cycling processes. Therefore, RuFe@NC can be a potential air cathode for non-aqueous and aqueous rechargeable metal-air batteries.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000753081900012

The micrograph, element composition and phase structure of the coating were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, energy disperse X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffractometry, respectively. The electrocatalytic activity and electrochemical stability of the coating for O2 evolution reaction were also characterized by linear sweep voltammetry, chronopotentiometry and accelerating life test, respectively. The effects of the thickness of the under-layer and the thickness ration of the various gradient coatings on the accelerated life of the anodes for O2 evolution reaction were investigated. The results show that, for the same loading mass of IrO2, the IrO2+Ta2O5/Ti gradient coating anodes exhibit higher electrocatalytic activity and electrochemical stability comparing with the IrO2+Ta2O5/Ti anodes prepared by the traditional method.									0	0	0		0	0	0			1004-0609			INSPEC:18428297

In this work, a in-situ two-step thermal polymerization method was used to introduce carbon quantum dots (CQDs) into oxygen doped graphitic carbon nitride (CNO) to obtain modified products CNOC with different content of CQDs. The as prepared samples were characterized by XRD, TEM, BET, PL, Electrochemical experiments and so on and photocatalytic H-2 production from water was used to evaluate the performance of the catalyst. Relative to CNO, the porosity and specific surface areas of CNOC-1.0 significantly increased; the visible light absorption range was extended, and the separation efficiency of photo-generated charge carriers was improved. As a result, CNOC-1.0 decorated with 1.0 wt. % of CQDs shows the best photocatalytic activity. The corresponding H-2 evolution rate (HER) is 316.6 mu mol.h(-1), which is 2.1 times of CNO nanosheets (154.5 mu mol.h(-1)). (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Hydrogen as the product of water electrolysis is a flexible and clean energy carrier, since it not only offers the prospect of large green elec-tricity storage capacities for weeks or months but also a broad spectrum of other options for industry decarbonization. NiCoP bimetallic phosphide nanoparticles incorporated into the carbon fibres (CF) were evaluated in this work as the most active materials within the investigated trinity NiCoP CF, FeNiP CF and FeCoP CF. Electrospinning was implemented as low cost, large-scale and versatile production technology. NiCoP CF as breakthrough bifunctional catalyst was studied in 1 M KOH as well as 0.5 M H2SO4 solutions simulating environments of alkaline and proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis, respectively. High electrocatalytic activity was detected for material prepared in both environments, resulting in cell voltage at the current density of 10 mA/cm-2 as low as 1.71 V and 1.51 V in KOH and H2SO4 solution, respectively. Corresponding overvoltage has reached 257 mV for HER and 300 mV for OER, whereby the respective Tafel slopes acquire the values of 38.6 mV/dec for HER and 81 mV/dec for OER, respectively.

These films, however, have a critical problem: a high processing temperature (> 700 degrees C) is required for the crystallization of the perovskite phase. The thermal evolution of the SBT films prepared by Chemical Solution Deposition (CSD) techniques showed the formation of an intermediate oxygen-deficient fluorite phase at similar to 55CPC. The SBT perovskite phase crystallizes at higher temperatures. To favor an earlier perovskite crystallization, SBT thin films were implanted with oxygen ions pulses produced by a Plasma Focus (I kJ). The samples were annealed at different temperatures in oxygen atmosphere and characterized by GI-XRD and Atomic Force Microscopy techniques. It was found that oxygen addition into the SBT structure promotes a better crystallization of the perovskite phase.					12th Latin American Congress of Surface Science and Its Applications (CLACSA-12)12th Latin American Congress of Surface Science and Its Applications (CLACSA-12)	DEC 05-09, 2005DEC 05-09, 2005		Rio de Janeiro, BRAZILRio de Janeiro, BRAZIL	3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0103-9733	1678-4448		WOS:000242535600055

High surface to volume ratio and luxuriant 3D porous framework of aerogel enabled fast multi-dimensional ion-phase transport. Ti3C2 MXene@Graphene composite aerogel act as flexible skeleton to facilitate strain release and restrained the pulverization of NCSe during electrochemical tests. As a result, NCSe@MGA exhibited high specific capacity of 352.4 mAh g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) with 99.6% initial coulombic efficiency, and maintained capacity retention rate to 91.5% after 5000 consecutive cycles at 12 A g(-1). In case of electrocatalytic water splitting, NCSe@MGA realized 10 mA cm(-2) current at significantly low overpotentials of 78 and 201 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. The value of Tafel slope was as low as 55 mV dec(-1) (HER) and 79 mV dec(-1) (OER), demonstrating fast kinetics. For both half reactions, no significant decay of current density was observed during 10 h electrolysis test. The synergistic effects stemming from intimate contact among NCSe, MXene and Graphene ultimately boosted the electrochemical activity of NCSe@MGA in comparison to NCSe and NCSe@GA. This study proposes a feasible strategy to design 3D electrode materials with optimal properties for multi-range technological applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000858460800002

The mechanisms of galvanic replacement were investigated by monitoring the potential variations versus time, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The electrocatalytic activities of the prepared catalysts were evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and formic acid oxidation in 0.5 M H2SO4 + 0.5 M HCOOH. In addition, the effect of the Ni loading amount on the final morphology, chemical composition and electrocatalytic activity of the galvanically replaced Pd/(Ni) catalysts was studied. The results indicated that the morphology of the Pd/(Ni) changes from thin film to nano/micro dendrite depending on the amounts of electrodeposited Ni loading. The sharp and relatively symmetric peaks that were observed in the voltammograms indicated the reversibility of electrochemical hydrogen absorption/extraction. The same Tafel slopes estimated for all Pd/(Ni) suggested the predomination of Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanisms in catalyzing the hydrogen evolution reaction. In addition, the Pd/(Ni) thin film catalyst exhibited superior electrocatalytic mass activity towards the oxidation of formic acid (1.39 A mg(-1) at the peak potential). Moreover, comparison of the Pd/(Ni) thin film activity with some other palladium-based catalysts in some recent studies with relatively good results showed that the galvanically replaced Pd/(Ni) thin film has great potential as a fast, easily prepared, and active electrocatalyst for formic acid oxidation.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			2046-2069			WOS:000371716300034

Further investigations revealed that the ultra-small Co/CoOx nanoparticles distributed on N-doped carbon template contribute significantly towards OER electrocatalysis through enlarging the activity surface areas and enhancing the intrinsic electrochemical activity due to the presence of metallic Co.

Many techniques such as linear and cyclic sweep voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) have been employed. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) are both used for characterization of the electrocatalysts. Effect of loading amount of both NiOx and Fe3O4 and the order of deposition on the OER was studied. A significant improvement of the electrocatalytic properties of the Fe3O4/NiOx binary catalyst modified GC is obtained when NiOx is electrodeposited on GC/Fe3O4 (i.e. GC/Fe3O4/NiOx) compared to GC/NiOx/Fe3O4 (where NiOx is deposited first on the GC then Fe3O4). The use of GC/Fe3O4/NiOx (where Fe3O4 is deposited first on the GC then NiOx) for OER in alkaline solution support higher currents and consequently negative shifts of the onset potential of OER compared to that of GC/NiOx or GC/Fe3O4. The obtained electrochemical impedance parameters confirmed the above conclusions. Tafel parameters confirm the superior activity of GC/Fe3O4/NiOx and give insight into the mechanism of the OER on the above electrodes.									16	1	0	0	2	0	16			0256-1115	1975-7220		WOS:000494049200019

Inactivation of anaerobic bacteria in wastewater was also investigated. Sulphide oxidation was effective during the experiments, and the best efficiency was achieved by the smallest current density used. One of the main oxidants of sulphides during the experiments was oxygen. Anaerobic bacteria were better inactivated with higher initial chloride concentration in wastewater because of electrochemically generated chlorine/hypochlorite. Dissolved oxygen, redox potential and pH values of the wastewater increased because of electrochemically generated oxygen-based oxidants and oxidation reactions occurring on the anode. In general, it can be said that sulphide removal was successful in the present study.									20	0	0	0	10	0	20			0959-3330			WOS:000268757800003	19803327

Palladium (Pd) catalysts show great potential due to their high intrinsic activity towards ORR but suffer from inferior durability. Here, we aim to employ tin oxide (SnO2) supports to tailor the lattice strain and electron density of Pd catalysts to enhance their ORR performance. By using electrospinning and solvothermal techniques, a hierarchical Pd/SnO2 hybrid catalyst was facilely synthesized with Pd nanoparticles anchored onto both the inside and outside walls of nanotube-like SnO2 supports. Owing to the SnO2 supports and the endowing metal-support interactions, tensile-strain and electron-rich features were both verified for the Pd nanoparticles in the Pd/SnO2 catalyst. In comparison, no such features were found for the Pd nanoparticles in the Pd/C catalyst. As a consequence, the Pd/SnO2 hybrid catalyst exhibits 2.5-times higher mass activity than the Pd/C catalyst and greatly improved durability with a current decay of 4% loss over 50 h compared with that (18%) of the Pd/C catalyst.

Exploring suitable materials for use as cathode catalysts can be challenging because the materials should be chemically active yet must be stable in an extremely corrosive environment in fuel cells. Since the successful introduction of graphene, 2-dimensional (2D) materials have received extensive research interest regarding their use as support materials for cathode catalysts due to their large surface area for catalyst dispersion. Recently, research on 2D MXene-based catalyst supports has started to increase. Excellent electronic properties, electrical conductivity, hydrophilicity and chemical and thermal stability are the key properties of potential MXenes used as catalyst supports. Therefore, in this review, the properties and performance of 2D MXene-based catalyst supports in the ORR are comprehensively discussed. This finding provides the groundwork for the exploration of MXenes in electrocatalysis, especially in the ORR. Challenges and future research directions are also discussed in this review.									19	1	0	0	2	0	20			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000657521100001

The compound is an efficient and stable catalyst for alcohol oxidation, organic sulfide oxidation, and epoxidation of alkenes in the presence of H2O2. The electrochemical oxygen-evolution reaction of the iron oxide hydroxide is also tested under acidic, neutral, and alkaline conditions. In the presence of the iron oxide hydroxide, excellent conversions (75-100%) and selectivities of substrates (92-97%), depending on the nature of the sulfide, were obtained. Benzylalcohols having electron-donating and-withdrawing substituents in the aromatic ring were oxidized to produce the corresponding aldehydes with excellent conversion (65-89%) and selectivity (96-100%) using this iron oxide hydroxide. The conversion of styrene and cyclooctene toward the epoxidation in the presence of this catalyst are 60 and 53%, respectively. Water oxidation for the catalysts was investigated at pH 2, 6.7, 12, and 14. The onset of OER at pH 14 is observed with a 475 mV overpotential. At 585 mV overpotential, a current density of more than 0.18 mA/cm(2) and a turnover frequency of 1.5/h is observed. Operando high-resolution visible spectroscopy at pH 14, similar to previously reported investigations, shows that Fe(IV)=O is an intermediate for water oxidation.									5	0	0	0	1	1	6			2045-2322			WOS:000634966100001	33758240

Here, we report considerable improvement on the catalytic activity of RuO2 particles for OER in both alkali and acid environments. The RuO2 nanoparticles were treated with a method of pulse laser ablation. Numerous Ru and RuO2 clusters were generated at the surface of RuO2 nanoparticles after the laser ablation, forming a lychee-shaped morphology. The larger pulse energy RuO2 nanoparticles are treated with, the better the OER activity can be. DFT calculations shows that the surface tension induced by the lychee-shaped morphology benefits the OER performance. Our best sample gives an overpotential of 172 mV (at 10 mA cm(-2)) and a Tafel slope of 53.5 mV dec(-1) in KOH, while an overpotential of 219 mV and a Tafel slope of 44.9 mV dec(-1) in H2SO4, which are of top-class results. This work may inspire a new way to develop high-performance electrocatalysts for OER. (C) 2020 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

These perovskites have a tetragonal symmetry with a 1 : 1 ordering of Cu and W at the B site. The elongation of the CuO6 octahedrons along the c direction due to the Jahn-Teller effect lowered their structure symmetry from cubic to tetragonal. Both perovskites have stronger visible light absorption than CuWO4 as well as a more hydrophilic surface. Photocatalytic oxygen evolution under visible light illumination (lambda >= 420 nm) was achieved for Sr2CuWO6 and Ba2CuWO6, which clearly outperformed CuWO4. The photoelectrochemical analysis suggests a p-type semiconductivity for these double perovskite compounds as compared to the case of CuWO4, which has a n-type semiconductivity. Similar to that of CuWO4, their conduction band edge is located more positively than the water reduction potential, which is inapplicable for photocatalytic hydrogen production.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2052-1553			WOS:000479129600020

In particular, alpha-MnO2 shows superior rate capability with silver stabilizing ions at the center of tunnels that improve electrical conductivity. In this work, we directly compare structural transformation of silver-containing alpha-MnO2 nanorods (Ag1.22Mn8O16-x or L-Ag-HOL and Ag1.66Mn8O16-y or H-Ag-HOL), containing higher and lower concentrations of oxygen vacancies respectively, by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The elaborate comparative and statistical TEM studies eliminate concerns regarding generalization errors and facilitate rational structural development of nanorods with improved functionality. It is found that sodium ions favorably diffuse through the area where oxygen vacancies are concentrated, and the samples with more silver ions and fewer oxygen vacancies (H-Ag-HOL) show more significant structural deformation with more inhomogeneous sodiation. The difference in functional electrochemistry coupled with the observed difference in inter- and intra-nanorod inhomogeneous structural evolution emphasizes the significance of the uniform electrical conductivity of the electrode. This work helps to improve the alpha-MnO2 electrode material for sodium-ion batteries as well as suggesting the importance of delicate statistical approaches for TEM investigations.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000482496300007

The photocurrent densities of as-treated and untreated alpha-Fe2O3 are 0.6, and 0.08 mA/cm(2), respectively at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl in the electrolyte of 1 M NaOH aqueous solution under 500 W xenon illumination. The IPCE (incident photon to current efficiency) of the as-treated alpha-Fe2O3 is 5.2% at 365 nm, 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. A plausible explanation is proposed for the enhanced alpha-Fe2O3 photoelectrochemical responses.

This paper reports on a titanium-nitride-ceramic-membrane electrode modified by MoS2 nanoflakes. Porous TiN-ceramic membranes were fabricated by phase-inversion tape-casting, followed by pressureless sintering. The as-prepared TiN membranes contained straight finger-like pores with an average diameter of 80 mu m and smaller pores with an average diameter of 1-3 mu m. Then, MoS2 nanoflakes were perpendicularly, densely, and uniformly grown on the surface of the TiN grains through the one-pot hydrothermal method. The optimized MoS2/TiN membrane electrode displayed a low overpotential of 113 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 78 mV dec(-1), a small charge transfer resistance of 1.44 Omega, and a high double-layer capacitance of 504 mF cm(-2). It also exhibited excellent stability with slight degradation after 80 h testing at an overpotential of 150 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4. The high conductivity of the TiN substrate, the similar chemical bonds, which favored the rapid electron transfer between MoS2 and TiN, the abundant exposed active sites of MoS2 nanoflakes, and the unique dual-pore structure resulted in the above superior electrocatalytic activity. The proposed successful utilization of conventional ceramic-membrane technology to prepare electrocatalysts based on membrane electrodes has potential for large-scale application in industrial hydrogen production.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2574-0962			WOS:000678382900037		
J	Gao, Zhi; Liu, Feng-qing; Wang, Li; Luo, Feng								Hierarchical Ni2P@NiFeAlOx Nanosheet Arrays as Bifunctional Catalysts for Superior Overall Water Splitting								INORGANIC CHEMISTRY				58	5			3247	3255		10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b03327				MAR 4 2019	2019	Bifunctional electrocatalysts based on transition-metal phosphides are appealing for overall water splitting owing to their excellent electrical conductivity, low cost, and high stability. However, these specials are often restricted by some serious drawbacks such as its relatively poor activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and its manufacture, which usually requires one to add additional large numbers of P sources and, consequently, inevitably leads to the release of flammable and detrimental PH3. Herein, we show an effective avenue to overcome these issues. For the first time, the in situ topological transformation of PO43--intercalated NiFeAl-layered double hydroxide nanosheet arrays upon calcination under a H-2 atmosphere is developed to fabricate supported nickel phosphide without any additional P source. The resulting phase affords unique Ni2P@NiFeAlOx core-shell nanosheet arrays, which exhibit an excellent performance for OER and hydrogen evolution reaction in 1.0 M KOH, with low overpotentials of 210 and 105 mV at 10 mA cm(-2,) respectively. Impressively, it can also serve as both a cathode and an anode to drive water splitting in alkaline media, giving 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) at cell voltages of only 1.52 and 1.62 V, respectively. This value is better than the commercial criterion of the Pt/C//IrO2 counterpart and also ranks at the top level in all established bifunctional electrocatalysts. The outstanding performance of Ni2P@NiFeAlOx is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect from a highly dispersed Ni2P core and a thin NiFeAlOx shell, as well as the efficient mass transport of a hierarchical nanoarray framework.									40	2	0	0	1	0	40			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000460600300039	30747528

The process is based on the plasma ionic liquid reduction strategy. A combination of PXRD, HRTEM, XPS, and EDX analyses confirms that the application of the developed wet plasma reduction method yields the IrPdPtRhRu HEA-NPs. HEA-NPs approximate to 5 nm in size are synthesized under a mild temperature condition at atmospheric pressure and without support assistance. All elements constituting the as-prepared IrPdPtRhRu HEA-NPs are uniformly distributed in the FCC single-phase nanostructure. The valence band emission suggests the hybridization of the metal orbitals in the IrPdPtRhRu HEA-NPs. The work function (WF) of 4.63 eV for the HEA is determined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. The WF value is lower than those of the metals constituting the HEA, suggesting higher catalytic activity. The IrPdPtRhRu/C electrocatalyst shows excellent catalytic performance toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with an overpotential of 60 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). A Tafel slope of 42 mV dec(-1) is recorded in the alkaline electrolyte. The HEA electrocatalyst exhibits good long-term stability for 6 h without significant decay under a high constant current density of 100 mA cm(-2). The findings in this study contribute to our basic scientific understanding of catalysts and provide a platform for the further development of HEA-NPs electrocatalysts for large-scale applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000853276300004

However, the undesirable chlorine ion oxidation reactions occurring simultaneously with seawater electrolysis greatly hinder the overall performance of seawater electrolysis. To tackle this problem, electrocatalysts of high activity and selectivity with purposely modulated coordination and an alkaline environment are urgently required. Herein, it is demonstrated that atomically dispersed Ni with triple nitrogen coordination (Ni-N-3) can achieve efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance in alkaline media. The atomically dispersed Ni electrocatalysts exhibit overpotentials as low as 102 and 139 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline freshwater and seawater electrolytes, respectively, which compare favorably with those previously reported. They also deliver large current densities beyond 200 mA cm(-2) at lower overpotentials than Pt/C, as well as show negligible current attenuation over 14 h. The X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) experimental analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations verify that the Ni-N-3 coordination, which exhibits a lower coordination number than Ni-N-4, facilitates water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption, and hence enhances the HER activity.									91	7	0	0	6	0	94			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000600644800001	33349991

With the easy self-igniting long flame coal as the research object, the inhibitory performances of coal samples treated with different inhibitors were studied by using the inhibition performance test, the characterization of reactive functional group and thermal analysis experiments. Based on the correlations among CO emission,evolution of functional groups,and mass change trend during coal spontaneous combustion, the inhibition mechanism of composite inhibitors was discussed combining with the thermodynamic characteristics of oxidation reaction. The experimental results show that the compound inhibitor has a coordinate inhibitory effect during the whole process of coal spontaneous combustion,with physical and chemical double inhibition effect. Compared with the raw coal, the amount of CO released from coal sample treated by the compound inhibitor was reduced by 88.7% at 128 ℃,and the inhibition rate reached 82.5% at 100 ℃. The inhibition ratio is higher than 80% during the initial weight loss stage and the oxygen absorption and weight increase stage. The compound inhibitor plays an inhibitory role by reducing the contents of hydroxyl,methyl,methylene groups and active components containing carbonyl groups in the coal,wherein, the relative content of a carbonyl compounds decreased obviously. The coal-oxygen chemisorption time for coal sample with the addition of composite inhibitor becomes short accompanied by the least adsorption quantity, a nd the weight gain rate decreased by 0.29%. The activation energy is increased with the development of coal spontaneous com-bustion,especially for the oxygen absorption and weight gain stages,with the activation energy increased by 53.2%. In the initial weight loss stage, the compound inhibitor exhibits physical inhibiting effects by the water retention due to inorganic salt. In weight gain stage, the compound inhibitor exhibits chemical inhibiting effects through the recombination of covalent bonds between free radical scavenger and the oxygen-containing active free radicals in the coal. DBHA releases free H~+and provides N and O atoms that do not share electrons. N,N-dibenzylhydroxylamine ( DBHA) molecular structure contains multiple absorption sites,which can simulta-neously capture multiple free radicals in coal. Butylated hydroxyl toluene ( BHT) reacts with free oxygen-containing functional groups to form stable compounds. Meanwhile, the formation paths for ketones and aldehydes are interrupted. Therefore, the compound inhibitor can control the process of coal spontaneous coal combustion via a chemical reaction pathway.			从隔氧降温和终止自由基链式反应角度出发,将无机盐类阻化剂氯化镁和氯化钙与自由基捕获剂N,N-二苄基羟胺( DBHA)和2,6-二叔丁基-4-甲基苯酚( BHT)结合形成一种持续高效抑制煤自燃的复合阻化剂。以易自燃长焰煤为研究对象,采用阻化性能测定实验、活性官能团以及热分析表征实验研究复合阻化剂的阻化性能;以煤自燃过程中CO释放、煤中活性官能团的转化以及煤体质量的变化规律3者之间的关联性为基础,结合氧化反应热动力学特性,探讨复合阻化剂的阻化机理。实验结果表明:复合阻化剂对煤自燃过程起到协同抑制作用,具有物理化学双重阻化效果。与原煤相比,经复合阻化剂处理煤样,CO释放量在128 ℃时减少88.7%,在初始失重阶段和吸氧增重阶段抑制率均在80%以上,100 ℃时抑制率达到82.5%。复合阻化剂通过降低煤中羟基、甲基和亚甲基以及含羰基类活性组分的含量发挥阻化作用,其中芳香酮类化合物相对含量下降明显。添加复合阻化剂的煤体氧气吸附过程变短,吸附量减少,并且随着煤自燃进程发展活化能呈现出增加的趋势,特别在吸氧增重阶段活化能增加53.2%。在初始失重阶段,无机盐的保水作用对煤自燃起到物理隔氧和降温作用;在吸氧增重阶段,自由基捕获剂与煤中含氧活性自由基进行共价键重组,从而起到化学阻化效果。DBHA会释放出游离的H~+,并提供未共用电子的氮、氧原子,从而形成多个吸收位点,可以同时对氧自由基和碳自由基等进行捕获; BHT与游离的含氧官能团发生反应,生成稳定的化合物,使得酮类、醌类和醛类化合物的生成途径被打断,阻断煤的自由基链式反应,从化学反应途径抑制煤自燃过程。						2	3	0	0	0	0	5			0253-9993			CSCD:6876113

Herein, a biomass chitin-derived carbon material with high ORR activities has been prepared and applied as electrocatalysts in Al-air batteries. The obtained cobalt, nitrogen co-doped carbon material (CoNC) exhibits the positive onset potential 0.86 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) and high-limiting current density 5.94 mA cm(-2). Additionally, the durability of the CoNC material in alkaline electrolyte shows better stability when compared to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Furthermore, the Al-air battery using CoNC as an air cathode catalyst provides the power density of 32.24 mW cm(-2) and remains the constant discharge voltage of 1.17 V at 20 mA cm(-2). This work not only provides a facile method to synthesize low-cost and efficient ORR electrocatalysts for Al-air batteries, but also paves a new way to explore and utilize high-valued biomass materials.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11				2073-4344		WOS:000502278800080

The citrate method was used for preparing the material. The electrochemical study of ORR was carried out in a 0.5-M NaOH solution at 25 degrees C with a rotating disk electrode. XRD and SEM analysis were performed to characterize the crystallinity of the material. XPS analysis is used to evaluate the surface state of the material. Electrochemical studies were followed by linear voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy measurements. The electrocatalyst composite Nd1.9Sr0.1Ni0.9Co0.1O4 +/-delta/C, consisting of oxide nickelate and carbon (Vulcan XC-72), was mixed and deposited as a layer on a glassy carbon substrate.

H1504+65 is the hottest known white dwarf (T (eff)=200 000 K) and has an atmosphere mainly composed by carbon and oxygen, augmented with high amounts of neon and magnesium. This object is unique and the origin of its surface chemistry is completely unclear. We probably see the naked core of either a C-O white dwarf or even a O-Ne-Mg white dwarf. In the latter case, this would be the first proof that such white dwarfs can be the outcome of single-star evolution.

The technique decreased the oxygen impurities in the plasma and the O% on the Plasma Facing Components (PFC) as measured with an in-vacuo probe. Samples were extracted from tiles removed from the tokamak for post-mortem and controlled studies. Ex-vessel low energy and fluence D-2(+) and Ar+ irradiations were characterized in-situ to elucidate surface evolution of a cored graphite sample with an intrinsic concentration of boron from a tokamak environment. In addition, quadrupole mass spectrometer measurements of emitted D-containing species during irradiation, indicate potential retention of D by the boronized graphite interface and correlated back to the surface chemistry evolution. Classical Molecular Dynamics (CMD) simulations were used to investigate the chemistry of the B-C-O-D system. The results suggest that boron coatings retain oxygen by forming oxidized boron states in the presence of deuterium plasmas and corroborate empirical findings. A four times increase in the O% of the boron coatings was observed following in-situ deuterium exposures, in contrast with a reduction of equal magnitude observed after Ar irradiations. These results illustrate the complex chemistry driven by energetic ions at the edge of tokamaks plasmas on the PFCs.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2045-2322			WOS:000459281500005	30792416

The approach differs from existing electrochemical synthesis methods in that it predominantly results in bulk precipitation of nanoparticles, without significant film growth on either of the electrodes. Heat treatment of the as-synthesized beta-Ni(OH) 2 afforded NiO with mostly preserved nanostructure and very high specific surface area (<= 100 m(2) g(-1), depending on calcination temperature). The as-synthesized beta-Ni(OH)(2) was found to be an excellent catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the technologically important water electrolysis process, apparently contradicting recent reports that the alpha polymorph is required for such high activity. With catalyst loadings < 0.1 mg cm(-2), OER current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) were sustained at overpotentials as low as 340 mV, with Tafel slopes of only similar to 38 mV/decade. The catalyst was highly stable in alkaline media over the course of electrolysis experiments lasting for several hours. This performance surpasses that of many previously reported earth-abundant OER catalysts and is comparable to that obtained with stateof- the-art RuO2 and IrO2 catalysts.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000377493700014	27233104

Herein, we report a simple and straightforward template-free strategy for preparing nitrogen, sulfur dual-doped HMCSs (N/S-HMCSs) as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts. The unique hollow spherical and mesoporous structure was in situ formed via a thermally initiated hollowing pathway from an elaborately engineered covalent triazine framework. Regulation of pyrolysis temperatures contributed to precisely tailoring of the shell thickness of HMCSs. The resulting N/S-HMCS900 (pyrolyzed at 900 degrees C) possessed high N and S contents, large specific surface areas, rich and uniform mesopores distribution. Consequently, as a metal-free ORR electrocatalyst, N/S-HMCS900 exhibits a high half-wave potential, excellent methanol tolerance and great long-term durability. Additionally, density functional theory calculations demonstrate that N, S-dual dopant can create extra active sites with higher catalytic activity than the isolated N-dopant. This strategy provides new insights into the construction of hollow and mesoporous multi-heteroatom-doped carbon materials with tunable nanoarchitecture for various electrochemical applications.

Despite the decades-long progress, the commercialization of water electrolysis remains fraught with difficulties owing to its high electricity consumption. We couple the hydrogen evolution reaction with the electrooxidation of xylose obtained from regenerated hemicellulose to organic acids, utilizing a bifunctional electrode consisting of Co9S8/Ni3S2. The electrochemically activated anodic sites, including Co2+/Co3+, Co3+/Co4+, Ni2+/Ni3+, and Ni3+/Ni4+ redox species, are responsible for xylose electrooxidation, with the required potential reduced by 290 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) compared with water oxidation. Moreover, the process yields over 60% towards formic acid at the anode, is accompanied by the production of hydrogen at the cathode. Xylose oxidation is kinetically and thermodynamically more favorable than water oxidation, significantly reducing the overall energy consumption relative to conventional water electrolysis. This study provides a promising strategy for the scalable and energy-efficient process of biomass electrooxidation coupled with hydrogen production.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000803693200004

Results demonstrated that the cyclization degree and dehydrogenation index of fibers reached 84.13% and 1.361, respectively after stabilization at 265 degrees C. The oxygen reaction was enhanced after stabilized at 245 degrees C. Refinement of the microcrystalline structure took effect during stabilization and low temperature carbonization, while growth of microcrystalline dominated during high temperature carbonization. The results of surface topography study not only provided the evolution characteristics of surface microstructure under the influence of chemical reaction, but also further complements the internal aggregation structural rearrangement process from the side. Additionally, the temperature zone from 245 to 265 degrees C was the key stage of the formation of the skin-core structure, which would be transmitted to the resultant carbon fiber. Tensile strength and tensile modulus decreased during stabilization stage, reaching 4.273 GPa and 221.132 GPa, respectively after high temperature carbonization. The elongation at break which first increased and then decreased proved a toughness failure to brittleness failure. The investigation elucidated the relationship between the mechanical property with chemical and physical microstructure. And the possible rearrangement process of the aggregation structure was proposed.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0021-8995	1097-4628		WOS:000736039700001

TEM, XRD, FTIR, XPS, and thermogravimetric analyses indicate that gold nanoparticles (Au NPs, d approximate to 2.9nm) protected with the tris(hydroxymethyl)oxide (THPO) ligand were deposited on the MWNTs, where no Oswald ripening was observed for the Au NPs after 3000 voltammetric cycling. The Au/MWNTs hybrid with THPO ligand exhibits an impressive catalytic activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), following a direct four-electron mechanism in alkaline solution, and it also manifests excellent long-term cycling durability and tolerance to the possible crossover methanol. This demonstrates prospective for the hybrid to serve as a stable ORR catalyst for direct methanol fuel cells.									8	1	0	0	0	0	9			2196-0216			WOS:000429413700011

In this experiment, partial shading was defined as the shading of 2(nd) leaves with shade cloths, and the whole treatment was defined as the covering of the whole individuals with shade cloths. In the leaf level responses, oxygen evolution, LMA, Chl concentrations and Rubisco contents decreased in all shade treatments administered for six days. F-v/F-m remained constant irrespective of the shade treatments. On the other hand, in the thylakoid-level responses, the concentrations of the thylakoid components per unit Chl and the stoichiometry of the two photosystems showed no statistical difference among the shade treatments. The data obtained from the present study indicate that the partial shading affected the leaf-level responses rather than the thylakoid-level responses. The light received at the lower leaves might serve as a factor in the regulation of the leaf properties of the upper leaves due to the whole plant photosynthesis, while this factor did not have an effect at the thylakoid level.									12	6	0	0	15	0	17			0300-3604	1573-9058		WOS:000315094400002

However, the exact formation mechanism of POSS, especially, an evolution process in the reaction still remains unclear. In this work, a real-time FTIR was carried out to trace the synthesis process of POSS. It was found that linear siloxanes, cyclic siloxanes, and cage-like polysiloxanes were formed during the reaction. With the help of generalized two-dimensional (2D) correlation analysis, we obtained exact sequential change among the three siolxanes, with the linear silicons formed initially. Following this was the emergence of cyclic siloxanes, and finally the cage-like polysiloxanes. Consequently, we not only proved the existence of the linear and cyclic siloxanes but also accurately detected the sequential change of the siloxanes in the process, which exhibited an intact and visual evolution process of POSS formation. Based on this, the reaction mechanism is presented. Finally, the chemical structure of cage-like products was further characterized by 29Si-NMR and GPC measurements. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The CeO2 additions (0, 2, and 5 wt.%) were made to the manganese dioxide (MnO2) cathode of a cell comprising zinc as an anode and an aqueous saturated lithium hydroxide solution as the electrolyte. The CeO2 enhances the performance of the cell in terms of capacity and resistance to capacity fade with cycling. This effect is only evident after the first charge cycle. The mechanism by which this occurs may be due to suppression of the oxygen evolution reaction during charging. This results in full reversion of the products of discharge (principally LixMnO2) to MnO2 during charging, and suppresses the formation of non-rechargeable oxyhydroxides. CeO2 additions of 2 wt.% were found to be most effective, since additions at the 5 wt.% level caused a decrease in capacity during long-term cycling. This could be due to a synchronizing effect. The effect of additions of a rare earth oxide (CeO2) and an alkaline earth oxide (CaO) on the electrochemical behavior of the cell is also compared and discussed. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

By modifying the preparation process via a colloidal iridium hydroxide hydrate precursor, which permitted a lower heat treatment temperature, its performance was enhanced, corresponding to a terminal voltage of 1.63 V at 1 A/cm(2).

We demonstrate that s-350 has excellent urea oxidation reaction (UOR) activity, with a demanded potential of 1.342 V to reach 10 mA/cm(2) and bears high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. It provides a low overpotential of 124 mV at 10 mA/cm(2), which enables the successful construction of its two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer (s-350||s-350) for water-urea splitting. It merely requires a voltage of 1.518 V to obtain 100 mA/cm(2) and is 0.145 V lower than that of pure water splitting. This noble metal-free bifunctional electrode is regarded as an inexpensive and effective water-urea electrolysis assisted hydrogen production technology, which is commercially viable.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11				2079-4991		WOS:000502271700078	31717362

However, when it comes to economic viability, it is critical to reduce production costs while improving the specific performance and stability of the electrocatalyst towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). To address these issues, we have synthesized Pd2-Co1-Ir1 alloy nanoparticles which were then assembled onto graphene-carbon nanotubes (G-CNTs) through the chemical reduction method. The electro-catalytic activity of the developed electrocatalyst for HER was evaluated through CV, LSV and EIS techniques in an acidic medium. The Pd2-Co1-Ir1/G-CNTs hybrid catalyst showed excellent electrocatalytic activity with high electrochemical surface area (160 m2 g-1), small Tafel slope value (31 mV dec- 1), low charge transfer resistance (9 omega) and long-term stability. Pd2-Co1-Ir1/G-CNTs electrocatalyst showed superior performance at 60 degrees C cell temperature with a cell voltage and current density of 0.60 V and 250 mA cm-2, respectively, in single ECMR cell as compared to commercially available Pt/C catalyst and other control catalysts in a single ECMR cell. The improvement in electrocatalytic activity could be attributed to the use of G-CNTs as hybrid carbon support and alloying Pd with Co and Ir, which in turn enhanced the electrocatalytic activity of Pd metal.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000870325500004

Here, we report the NiIrx/carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrid nanostructures in situ grown on carbon fiber paper (CFP) substrate for efficient OER in wide pH ranges. In 0.5 M H2SO4 the resulting NiIrx/CNT/CFP electrode only demands 196 mV overpotential to achieve 10 mA cm(-2), which is significantly superior to those of the Ni/CNTs, Ir/CNTs, and NiIrx, samples. Meanwhile, it also shows high performance in alkaline solution with a low overpotential of 220 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The in situ grown approach guarantees the intimate contact between the substrate and the catalyst, and the CNTs provide high conductivity and high exposed surface area for active sites. Furthermore, the introduction of Ni triggered electronic coupling between Ir and Ni that regulates the adsorption energy for the OER intermediates, as indicated by density functional theory calculations. This work demonstrates the cooperative effect not only between the noble metals and the support but also between noble metals and the non-noble metals for the OER.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000752810100007

This study reports a class of highly porous Ir-Cu nanocrystals (P-IrCux NCs) through a facile chemical dealloying strategy. Featuring the increased active surface area and plenty of defects, the newly generated P-IrCux NCs are highly active and stable toward OER in acidic conditions. The optimized P-IrCu1.4 NCs exhibit the current density of 12.8 mA cm(-2) at the potential of 1.55 V (vs RHE), presenting 3.5-fold improvement in mass activity and 1.8-fold improvement in specific activity over the pristine solid IrCu1.4 NCs (S-IrCu1.4 NCs). Moreover, the obtained P-IrCu1.4 NCs also show excellent OER stability with negligible potential shift after continuous electrolysis in 0.05 M H2SO4 for 10 h. Further analysis reveals that the coordinatively unsaturated atoms at defects result in the higher oxidation state of iridium, which promotes the optimized intrinsic activity of P-IrCux NCs. This work highlights a promising strategy to create three-dimensional porous Ir-based catalysts for enhancing OER electrocatalysis.									55	0	0	0	0	0	55			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000453489300020

In this work, we have systematically investigated the HER catalytic activities for a series of different curvature CNT (n,n) (n = 5-9), doped with atomic N or N and Co via the first-principle computation. The computed results indicate that H binding capability increases with the curvature increase for the CNTs and N-CNTs. Through manipulating the number of N atoms and the curvature, the N-CNTs can exhibit the optimal considerable Delta G(H*) values and can be used as an HER catalyst comparable to metal Pt. Moreover, the hydrogen adsorption/desorption can be balanced through the Co atom doped inside the mN(y)-CNT (n,n) systems because of the charge transfer. The Co/1N- CNT (8,8), Co/1N-CNT (9,9), Co/2N(o)-CNT (9,9), and Co/2N(p)-CNT (9,9) revealed the ideal HER activity, which could be a promising catalyst for hydrogen production. Meanwhile, the strength of the H adsorption energy of the systems can be correlated to the C p(z) band center. Thus, the HER catalytic activity of CNT (n,n) (n = 5-9) can be reasonably regulated through doping atoms and designing low-cost and high-performance carbon-based electrocatalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2574-0970		WOS:000613246600066

Here, we design and synthesize Co-Fe alloy nanoparticles (NPs) modified nitrogen-doped cubic carbon box (NC) supported MoS2 nanosheets (NC@ MoS2@Co-Fe) as a bi-functional electrocatalytic electrode material, which possesses excellent electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance. The NC@ MoS2@Co-Fe exhibits remarkable bifunctional electrocatalytic activities with an ORR half-wave potential of 0.73 V in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte and an OER overpotential of 400 mV, driving a current density of 10 mA cm-2. The advanced catalytic performance can be attributed to the unique heterojunction structure of the catalyst. The size of the Co-Fe alloy NPs supported on MoS2 can be tuned to avoid the excessive growth of alloy NPs and to expose more catalytic active sites. Meanwhile, the loaded Co-Fe alloy NPs should be covered with a calcined carbon layer derived from the organic ligand to prevent oxidation passivation and particle aggregation. The structure formed by Co-Fe alloy NPs and NC@MoS2 optimizes the electronic structure of the active center and accelerates the electrocatalytic reaction rate, thus synergistically improving the bi-functional electrocatalytic activity of the NC@MoS2@Co-Fe catalyst and can be applied to rechargeable zinc air batteries.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0925-8388	1873-4669		WOS:000816897700002

The current benchmark electrocatalyst for OER is based on iridium oxide (IrOx) due to its superior performance and excellent stability. However, large scale applications using IrOx are impractical due to its low abundance and high cost. Herein, we report a highly active hafnium-modified iridium oxide (IrHfxOy) electrocatalyst for OER. The IrHfxOy electrocatalyst demonstrated ten times higher activity in alkaline conditions (pH = 11) and four times higher activity in acid conditions (pH = 1) than a IrOx electrocatalyst. The highest intrinsic mass activity of the IrHfxOy catalyst in acid conditions was calculated as 6950 A g(IrOx)(-1) at an overpotential (eta) of 0.3 V. Combined studies utilizing operando surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and DFT calculations revealed that the active sites for OER are the Ir-0 species for both IrOx and IrHfxO3 catalysts. The presence of Hf sites leads to more negative charge states on nearby O sites, shortening of the bond lengths of Ir-O, and lowers free energies for OER intermediates that accelerate the OER process.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000703999100016	34469132

Mitrofanovite represents a very promising electrocatalyst candidate for energy-related applications, with a reduction of costs by 47% compared to pure Pt and superior robustness to CO poisoning. We show that Pt3Te4 is a weak topological metal with the Z(2) invariant, exhibiting electrical conductivity (similar to 4 x 10(6) S/m) comparable with pure Pt. In hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the electrode based on bulk Pt3Te4 shows a very small overpotential of 46 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 36-49 mV dec(-1) associated with the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. The outstanding ambient stability of Pt3Te4 also provides durability of the electrode and long-term stability of its efficient catalytic performances.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1948-7185			WOS:000696175700025	34472339

However, the approach is severely hindered by the sluggish anodic OER, poor reactivity of electrocatalysts, and low-value-added byproducts at the anode. Herein, formaldehyde was added as an anode sacrificial agent, and a bifunctional Co-N-x-C@Co catalyst containing abundant Co-N-4 sites and Co nanoparticles was successfully fabricated and evaluated as both a cathodic and an anodic material for the HER and formaldehyde selective oxidation reaction (FSOR), respectively. Co-N-x-C@Co displayed a remarkable electrocatalytic performance simultaneously for both HER and FSOR with high hydrogen (H-2) and carbon monoxide (CO) selectivity. Density functional theory calculations combined with experiments identified that Co-N-4 and Co nanoparticles were dominating active sites for CO and H-2 generation, respectively. The coupling tactic of FSOR at the anode not only expedites the reaction rate of HER but also offers a high-efficiency and energy-saving means for the generation of valuable H-2/CO syngas.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000687172000030	34342991

Results showed that with the increase of bending strains, the Gibbs free energy for hydrogen adsorption on the MoS2 monolayer was decreased from 0.18 to - 0.04 eV and to 0.13 eV for the bend strains applied along the zigzag and armchair directions, respectively. The mechanism for the enhanced catalytic activity comes from the changes of density of electronic states near the Fermi energy level, which are induced by the changes of the Mo-S and Mo-Mo bonds upon bending. This report provides a new design methodology to improve the catalytic activity of catalysts based on two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides through a simple mechanical bending.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			1388-0764	1572-896X		WOS:000410882300002

Herein, the application of the organometallic approach as synthetic method allows obtaining very small, ligand-capped but also highly active ruthenium nanoparticles (RuNPs) for the HER in both acidic and basic media. When deposited onto glassy carbon, the catalytic activity of this nanomaterial in 1 M H2SO4 solution is highly dependent on the oxidation state of the NPs surface, with metallic Ru sites being clearly more active than RuO2 ones. In sharp contrast, in 1 M NaOH as electrolyte, the original Ru/RuO2 mixture is maintained even under reductive conditions. Estimation of surface active sites and electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) allowed benchmarking this catalytic system, confirming its leading performance among HER electrocatalysts reported at both acidic and basic pH. Thus, in 1 M NaOH condition, it displays lower overpotentials (eta(0) approximate to 0 mV, eta(10) = 25 mV) than those of commercial Pt/C and Ruthenium black (Rub), and also fairly outperforms them in short- and long-term stability tests. In 1 M H2SO4 solution, it clearly outdoes commercial Rub and is competitive or even superior to commercial Pt/C, working at very low overpotentials (eta(0) approximate to 0 mV, eta(10) = 20 mV) with a Tafel slope of 29 mV.dec(-1), achieving TOFs as high as 17 s(-1) at eta = 100 mV and reaching a current density of ljl = 10 mA.cm(-2) for at least 12 h without any sign of deactivation.									52	0	0	0	3	0	52			2155-5435			WOS:000453491100015

However, it is a major challenge to design efficient catalysts to use in the photoelectochemical process. Recently, research has focused on carbon-based catalysts, as they are nonprecious and environmentally benign. Interesting advances have also been made in controlling nanostructure interfaces and in introducing new materials as catalysts in the photoelectrochemical cell. However, these catalysts have as yet unresolved issues involving kinetics and light-transmittance. In this work, we introduce high-transmittance graphene onto a planar p-Si photocathode to produce a hydrogen evolution reaction to dramatically enhance photon-to-current efficiency. Interestingly, double-layer graphene/Si exhibits noticeably improved photon-to-current efficiency and modifies the band structure of the graphene/Si photocathode. On the basis of in-depth electrochemical and electrical analyses, the band structure of graphene/Si was shown to result in a much lower work function than Si, accelerating the electron-to-hydrogen production potential. Specifically, plasma-treated double-layer graphene exhibited the best performance and the lowest work function. We electrochemically analyzed the mechanism at work in the graphene-assisted photoelectrode. Atomistic calculations based on the density functional theory were also carried out to more fully understand our experimental observations. We believe that investigation of the underlying mechanism in this high-performance electrode is an important contribution to efforts to develop high-efficiency metal-free carbon-based catalysts for photoelectrochemical cell hydrogen production.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000393355900037	28075553

To address the pertinent stability problems and insufficiently understood structure-activity relations, we investigate the influence of moderate annealing (100-300 degrees C for 20 min) for two types of electrodeposited Mn oxide films with contrasting properties. Upon annealing, the originally inactive and structurally well-ordered Oxide 1 of birnessite type became as OER active as the non-heated Oxide 2, which has a highly disordered atomic structure. Oxide 2 also improved its activity upon heating, but more important is the stability improvement: the operation time increased by about two orders of magnitude (in 0.1 M KPi at pH 7). Aiming at atomistic understanding, electrochemical methods including quantitative analysis of impedance spectra, X-ray spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS), and adapted optical spectroscopies (infrared, UV-vis and Raman) identified structure-reactivity relations. Oxide structures featuring both di-mu-oxo bridged Mn ions and (close to) linear mono-mu-oxo Mn3+-O-Mn4+ connectivity seem to be a prerequisite for OER activity. The latter motif likely stabilizes Mn3+ ions at higher potentials and promotes electron/hole hopping, a feature related to electrical conductivity and reflected in the strongly accelerated rates of Mn oxidation and O-2 formation. Poor charge mobility, which may result from a low level of Mn3+ ions at high potentials, likely promotes inactivation after prolonged operation. Oxide structures related to the perovskite-like zeta-Mn2O3 were formed after the heating of Oxide 2 and could favour stabilization of Mn ions in oxidation states lower than +4. This rare phase was previously found only at high pressure (20 GPa) and temperature (1200 degrees C) and this is the first report where it was stable under ambient conditions.									18	1	0	0	1	0	18			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000476599900043

One reason for the high reactivity is an increase in contact surface between the components occurring after mechanoactivation. Two methods for determination of area of contact surface S (C) between the components are used, and the values of S (C) for all the systems are estimated. Considerable attention is paid to the role of highly reactive defects (grain sizes, dislocations and stacking faults, paramagnetic centers, "weakly bound" oxygen in MoO3, etc.), formed in the components under mechanical stress. For the Me/MeO3 systems, the formation of point defects in the oxide is an important factor. It was found that, after mechanoactivation, the evolution of O-2 from MoO3 occurs at 230-450 degrees C. It is argued that this process is associated with the thermal destruction of "weak" Mo-O bonds in the "bridge" oxygen. It was suggested that the formation of defect structure in MoO3 and increasing of the oxygen mobility under heating give rise to a low-temperature peak in DSC curves and initiated self-ignition on the fuel-air mixture. For composites Mg/MoO3, self-ignition occurs at temperature 100 degrees C lower than that for Al/MoO3: The decreasing of temperature can be connected with larger S (C) in the first system. In the Mg/(-C2F4-) (n) system, the reactions of magnesium defects with (-C2F4-) (n) are accompanied by a weak heat evolution, too low to initiate ignition. In this case, the reaction is initiated by the thermal depolymerization of (-C2F4-) (n) , while a high values of S (C) provide a complete conversion. In the case of shock-wave initiation, defects in the components play only a minor role in the conversion, whereas the value of S (C) remains to be highly important.

At present, most theoretical descriptors focus on estimating the catalytic activity and understanding the enhancement mechanism of catalysts, while it is also quite important to find a factor to correlate the descriptors with preparation methods. In this work, a correlation factor, the d electron density of transition metal ions, was developed to correlate the d band center values of transition metal ions with the preparation methods of amorphization and Al introduction. According to the results of theoretical simulations, the correlation factor not only exhibited favorable linear relationships with the theoretical overpotentials of (CoFeAlx)(3)O-4 and (CoFeAlx)(3)O-4 + (CoFeAlx)OOH systems but also correlated with two preparation methods by altering the volume of systems. Based on theoretical guidance, the electrocatalytic activities of the prepared (CoFeAlx)(3)O-4 specimens were gradually improved by the preparation methods of amorphization and Al introduction, and the Am-CoFeAl-2-10h specimen exhibited a low kinetic barrier of 268 mV, fast charge transfer rate, and stable electrocatalytic activity. This strategy could be applied to design highly efficient catalysts by adjusting the correlation factor of the active site with suitable preparation methods.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000672492800026	34165294

Whereas, it remains a mystery that they show advantageous activity over prototypical hydroxides when they are directly acted as OER catalysts. Herein, we propose for the first time that the steric hindrance effect of Nafion can induce enhanced catalytic activity of such MOFs. Different from conventional catalysts without AHP, the Nafion with 3D structure weakens the AHP of Co-MOF nanoribbons, thus forming small size and low crystallinity species (cobalt hydroxide) with more active sites. And the existence of Nafion also optimizes its electronic structure, which is confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), in-situ UV absorption spectra, in-situ Raman spectroscopy and so on. Compared with Co-MOF-K obtained by directly immersing the Co-MOF nanoribbons in 1.0 M KOH, the Co-MOF-NK obtained by AHP of Co-MOF mixed with Nafion shows better catalytic activity. Based on the above inspiration, we realized the low overpotential of 268 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) by preparing CoFe-MOF-NK. This work provides a new understanding of the structural reconstruction of MOFs in the field of electrocatalysis.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000640148200003

However, its intrinsic catalytic activity is still not comparable with those noble-metal-based ones while its surface species is easily oxidized to amorphous phosphate in air. Herein, abundant edge dislocations were successfully generated on the Mn doped CoP material with an electrochemical reduction process, leading to the formation of P vacancies, and lattice distortion, resulting in the modification of the electronic structure and the improvement of the whole catalysis performance. Based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is found that the P vacancies on the edge dislocation could change the Gibbs free energy, enhancing the intrinsic catalytic activity of Mn-CoP. Furthermore, the surface of Mn-CoP was in-situ converted to Mn-CoOOH with a nanosheet structure by an electrochemical oxidization, resulting in a Mn-CoP nanowire @ Mn-CoOOH nanosheet core@shell structure. The formed Mn-CoOOH nanosheet shell not only effectively prevented the continuous oxidation of Mn-CoP but also provided additional catalytic active sites for OER. Besides, the Mn-CoOOH was reduced to Mn-Co(OH)2 as the real active species during HER, which effectively promoted the decompsition of water to proton. As a result, such a defect-activated Mn-CoP nanowire @ Mn-CoOOH nanosheet electrocatalyst needed low overpotentials of 110 and 251 mV to support a current density of 10 mA cm-2 for HER and OER with high stability, respectively.									32	0	0	0	3	0	32			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000663215600002		
J	Luo, Qingyu; Xu, Wei; Tang, Shaolong								Fabricating high-loading ultra-small PtCu3/rGO via a traceless protectant and spray-freeze-drying method								APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL				312						121433	10.1016/j.apcatb.2022.121433				SEP 5 2022	2022	Exploring excellent catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with a facile and cost-effective method is desirable but remains challenging. Herein, ultra-small PtCu3 nanoparticles (ca. 2.7 nm), immobilized on reduced graphene oxide (rGO), were synthesized via a novel and general strategy. Traceless protectant, NH4OH, was used to resist the aggregation of graphene oxide (GO), and the spray-freeze-drying method ensures excellent dispersion of the Pt and Cu precursors, which could not be achieved by other reported drying methods. After annealing, the nanoparticles with the highest mass loading, 52%, among reported ordered Pt-based catalysts were obtained. The PtCu3/rGO shows a remarkable electrocatalytic performance. Density functional theory calculations elucidate that PtCu3 possess a lowered energy barrier of the rate-determining step, contributing to significantly improved ORR kinetics. This strategy was extended to the synthesis of other binary- and quaternarymetallic Pt-based nanoparticles, which proved its generality and applicability towards the potential commercialization of fuel cell technologies.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000798993700003

Defect engineering with electronic structure modulation has been expected to be an effective strategy to enhance the electrocatalytic activity. Herein, Ni-Co bimetallic sulfide (NiCo2S4) nanosheet arrays with controlled sulfur vacancies have been developed by multiple vulcanization treatment of the Ni-Co hydroxide precursor for HER catalysis at all pH values. The presence of S vacancies has been identified by various characterization means, and their effects on the HER performance are well investigated. The obtained NiCo2S4 nanosheet arrays with optimal sulfur vacancy content exhibit the best HER performance in alkaline medium, only requiring an overpotential of 150 mA at -10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 82.5 mV dec(-1), as well as excellent durability. Experimental results confirm that the high HER activity could be ascribed to the accelerated electron transfer and good intrinsic activity for the electrocatalyst with optimal S vacancies. These findings should provide a new vacancy modulation for traditional transition metal chalcogenides for the purpose of boosting the HER performance at all pH values.									19	1	0	0	2	0	20			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000518579100012

We have collected EXAFS data at the Ca K-edge using active PS 11 membrane samples that contain approximately 2 Ca per 4 Mn. These samples are much less perturbed than previously investigated Sr-substituted samples, which were prepared after Ca depletion. The new Ca EXAFS clearly shows backscattering from Mn at 3.4 Angstrom, a distance that agrees with that surmised from previously recorded Mn EXAFS. This result is also consistent with earlier related experiments at the Sr K-edge, using samples that contained functional Sr, that show Mn is similar to3.5 Angstrom distant from Sr. The totality of the evidence clearly advances the notion that the catalytic center of oxygen evolution is a Mn-Ca heteronuclear cluster.									119	0	0	0	44	0	119			0006-2960			WOS:000178793100005	12390018

Reported herein is a novel three-dimensional hierarchical architectured electrocatalyst, consisting of platinum copper nickel nanoparticles-decorated carbon nanofiber arrays, which are conformally assembled on carbon felt fabrics (PtCuNi/CNF@CF) by an ambient-pressure chemical vapor deposition coupled with a spontaneous galvanic replacement reaction. The free-standing PtCuNi/CNF@CF monolith exhibits high porosities, a well-defined geometry shape, outstanding electron conductivity, and a unique characteristic of localizing platinum copper nickel nanoparticles in the tips of carbon nanofibers. Such features render PtCuNi/CNF@CF as an ideal binder-free HER electrode for hydrogen production. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that the PtCuNi/CNF@CF possesses superior intrinsic activity as well as mass-specific activity in comparison with the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts, both in acidic and alkaline solutions. With well-tuned composition of active nanoparticles, Pt42Cu57Ni1/CNF@CF showed excellent durability. The synthesis strategy reported in this work is likely to pave a new route for fabricating free-standing hierarchical electrodes for electrochemical devices.									70	4	0	0	2	0	69			1944-8244			WOS:000370211400066	26784023

Herein, the cuboid-like platinum nanocrystals (Pt-CNSs) are achieved through a facile L-lysine-assisted hydrothermal reduction method. Then, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) supported Pt-CNSs (Pt-CNSs/RGO) nanohybrids are obtained through the self-assemble of Pt-CNSs on graphene oxide (GO) and followed by NaBH4 reduction. The resulting Pt-CNSs/RGO nanohybrids are characterized by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and Raman, showing that the well-defined Pt-CNSs with 5.8 nm length and 3.0 nm width are uniformly and firmly attached on the RGO surface. Electrochemical tests demonstrate that Pt-CNSs/RGO nanohybrids have superior electrocatalytic activity and stability for the HER than pure Pt-CNSs, demonstrating RGO is an excellent cathode support materials for Pt-CNSs. Meanwhile, the present results indicate that the as-prepared Pt-CNSs/RGO nanohybrids have great potential application in HER. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Here a composite material derived from a combination of bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (denoted as BMZIFs) and Fe/N/C framework was reported as an efficient bifunctional catalyst. Although BMZIF or Fe/N/C alone exhibits undesirable oxygen reaction activity, a combination of these materials shows unprecedented ORR (half-wave potential of 0.85 V as well as comparatively superior OER activities (potential@10 mA cm(-2) of 1.64 V), outperforming not only a commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst but also most reported bifunctional electrocatalysts. We then tested its practical application in Znair batteries. The primary batteries exhibit a high peak power density of 235 mW cm(-2), and the batteries are able to be operated smoothly for 100 cycles at a curent density of 10 mA cm(-2). The unprecedented catalytic activity can be attritued to chemical coupling effects between Fe/N/C and BMZIF and will aid the development of highly active electrocatalysts and applications for electrochemical energy devices.									101	2	0	0	3	0	102			1944-8244			WOS:000394481800019	28106376

By varying the electrolyte composition for electrodeposition, the atomic concentration of the CuxMO100-x electrocatalysts could be controlled, and the Mo content ranged between 0.8 and 6.9%. In the first cyclic voltammetry scan in a 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte, the recorded HER current densities of the CuxMo100-x, electrocatalysts at-0.50 V-RHE increased on increasing the Mo content to 3.8%; then, a further increase in Mo to 6.9% led to a saturation in the HER activity. The maximum value of the normalized current density with respect to the electrochemical surface area and the loading mass was found for the Cu99.2MOo.8 electrocatalyst. Characterization of the prepared catalysts revealed that the enhancement of catalytic activity originates from changes in the grain size and electronic structure. To operate a single cell of the proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE), we electrode posited CuMo catalyst on carbon paper, and this was used as the cathode, while IrO2 electrodeposited on carbon paper was used as the anode. The cell performance was normalized with respect to the metal mass loading and was found to be 3.4 A/mg(metal) at 1.9 V, a 2.2-10.8 times better catalyst cost-activity relationship compared to that of currently reported PEMWEs using Pt-based cathodes. Consequently, the results presented here show that non-noble metal cathodes can be used for PEMWE operation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Tunable band gap as a function of number of layers, ease of passivation and high carrier mobility of PQDs have attracted considerable attention in catalysis research due to which spectacular progress has been made in PQD research over the last few years. PQDs are now considered as promising catalytic materials for electrocatalytic water splitting and nitrogen reduction, lithium-sulfur batteries, solar light-driven energy devices and biocatalysis, either in pristine form or as an active component for constructing heterostructures with other 2D materials. In the light of these recent advances, it is worthwhile to review and consolidate PQD research in catalytic applications to understand the challenges ahead and suggest possible solutions. In this review, we systematically summarize various synthetic strategies including ultrasonic and electrochemical exfoliation, solvothermal treatment, blender breaking, milling, crushing and pulsed laser irradiation. Furthermore, the physiochemical properties of PQDs are discussed based on both experimental and theoretical perspectives. The potential applications of PQDs in catalysis with special emphasis on photocatalysis (solar light-driven energy devices) and electrocatalysis (oxygen evolution reactions and hydrogen evolution reactions) -are critically discussed along with the present status, challenges and future perspectives									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000739941200001	34994751

Herein, we report a nanohybrids of copper sulfides supported on nickel-incorporated graphitic carbon nitride (Ni/g-C3N4@CuS) sheets for enhanced activity towards PEC water oxidation. The TEM images confirm the presence of intimate contact between nickel doped graphitic carbon nitride and CuS, forming an interface which is favorable for an effective separation of charge-carriers. The electrochemical properties of the prepared samples are investigated through linear sweep voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, Mott-Schottky analysis, and chopped photo-current measurements. The Ni/g-C3N4@CuS nanohybrids depicts almost three-fold enhancement in current density under light illumination reaching to 15.5 mA cm(-2) at an over potential of ca. 600 mV than in the dark and almost fifteen-fold enhancement as compared to its parent materials, CuS and g-C3N4. The enhanced activity towards PEC water splitting is assigned to the larger extent of band bending as illustrated by larger space charge region width, formation of p-n junction between CuS and g-C3N4, lowering of effective band gap of the resulting hetero-structures, and facile charge transfer kinetics due to Ni-incorporation into the g-C3N4 matrix.

The compositional segregation near the alloyed PtNi nanoparticle surface was achieved by controlling the reaction kinetics and site-dependent compositional segregation in the facet centers of the shaped PtxNi1-x nanoparticles was controlled by the bulk Pt/Ni composition ratio, respectively. Based on this unique compositional segregation, we study their atomic-scale evolution of surface microstructure and composition by using high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy with high angle annular dark field and electron energy loss spectroscopy line scans and investigate their structural and compositional behaviors under reactive environments. The surface evolution of these materials helps ones understand the reactivity and degradation of a catalyst and understand the interactions between reactants and catalysts by introducing environmental impact factors.					13th Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell Symposium (PEFC)13th Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell Symposium (PEFC)	OCT 27-NOV 01, 2013OCT 27-NOV 01, 2013	Electrochem Soc; Electrochem Soc, Ind Electrochemistry & Electrochem Engn Div; Electrochem Soc, Battery Div; Electrochem Soc, Corros Div; Electrochem Soc, Energy Technol Div; Electrochem Soc, Phys & Analyt Electrochemistry Div; N E Chemcat CorpElectrochem Soc; Electrochem Soc, Ind Electrochemistry & Electrochem Engn Div; Electrochem Soc, Battery Div; Electrochem Soc, Corros Div; Electrochem Soc, Energy Technol Div; Electrochem Soc, Phys & Analyt Electrochemistry Div; N E Chemcat Corp	San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1938-5862		978-1-60768-446-6; 978-1-60768-445-9	WOS:000354475600057

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) from aqueous solutions is the half reaction of different energy related reaction schemes, most importantly stoichiometric water splitting (H-2 generation) or CO2 reduction. In this paper, we present PEC water oxidation (OER) on nanoporous WO3 films, decorated with RuO2 nanoparticles. The morphology and the composition of these nanostructured assemblies were characterized by high-resolution scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry while their photo-electrochemical behavior was evaluated by photovoltammetry and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements. The O-2 evolution capability was directly assessed by determining the amount of evolved O-2 gas during PEC oxidation of water. The RuO2 electrocatalyst substantially increased photoanodic current flow through facile transfer of photogenerated holes from WO3 to the solution, thereby improving interfacial charge transfer kinetics. Both absolute and relative enhancement of photocurrents was analyzed as a function of the applied external bias potential giving important insight into the mechanistic details. Furthermore, the decisive roles of the amount of RuO2 cocatalyst and thermal pretreatment were established by synthesizing hybrid assemblies with different RuO2 coverage, and applying subsequent thermal treatment, respectively. Through careful optimization of the composition of the hybrid material, the IPCE value doubled at lower bias potentials and was increased close to the theoretical 100 % limit at higher positive potential values. These results demonstrate the synergy gained by combining the excellent photoanodic properties of nanoporous WO3 with the robust O-2 evolution capabilities of RuO2.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000328166300026

A one-electron reaction occurs resulting in initial formation of the oxidized (MnMnIV)-Mn-III(2-OHsalpn)(2)OH species 2 and a tert-butoxy radical. The (MnMnIV)-Mn-III(2-OHsalpn)(2)OH complex can be readily protonated to yield (MnMnIV)-Mn-III(2-OHsalpn)(2)(+). Upon addition of excess tert-butyl hydroperoxide, singlet dioxygen is evolved in an exothermic reaction indicative of radical-induced disproportionation of the hydroperoxide. In the presence of a radical scavenger, the oxygen evolution is strongly attenuated. This system was observed to oxygenate cyclohexene to yield 2-cyclohexen-1-one, 2-cyclohexen-1-ol, and traces of cyclohexene oxide. Cumene is oxygenated to 2-phenyl-2-propanol and acetophenone, and cyclohexane is oxygenated to cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol. However, O-18-labeling experiments show that the oxygen in the products results exclusively from reactions with aerobic dioxygen and not from the tert-butyl hydroperoxide oxidant. These results indicate that oxygenation occurs by radical-initiated aerobic autoxidation and not via oxo transfer from a high-valent manganese oxo species. 2 was studied by UV-vis, IR, NMR, EXAFS, XANES, and EPR spectroscopies, which support the assignment of a dinuclear manganese(III/IV) terminal hydroxo structure. 2 was also formed by the direct reaction of (MnMnIV)-Mn-III(2-OHsalpn)(2)(+) with OH-, further supporting the description of 2 as having a terminal hydroxide ligand. The kinetics of its formation from 1 and tert-butyl hydroperoxide were examined and found to be first-order in peroxide. Titration experiments confirm that 1 equiv of peroxide is required to convert 1 to 2, supporting the conclusion that the peroxide undergoes a one-electron reduction. This system demonstrates that oxy radicals formed from homolytic one-electron cleavage of a peroxide by a manganese(III) complex can give small amounts of olefin oxidation species (i.e. epoxides) normally considered evidence for high-valent manganese oxo-transfer chemistry. It therefore underscores the need to test any system for which high-valent metal oxo transfer is proposed to occur using rigorous oxygen-labeling experiments to determine the source of oxygen.									55	0	0	0	9	0	56			0020-1669			WOS:A1996UP86700023

Herein, a novel phosphorous doped cobalt -copper aerogel (P-CoCu) with three-dimensional interconnected structure was prepared via spontaneous gelation and in-situ P doping process. The electronic structure and charge density of Co could be modulated upon alloying with Cu, resulting in optimized charge transfer efficiency and proton adsorption energy. The hydro-philicity and the bond strength of H* were further optimized through P doping, which promoted the reaction efficiency on the surface of P-CoCu. Besides, the unique porous morphology of aerogel endowed the catalyst with efficient mass transfer pathways and abundant active sites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further revealed the electron redistribution and the optimization of H2 desorption performance through Cu alloying and P doping. Based on the outstanding features, the optimized P-CoCu sample achieved extremely low over -potentials of 74/224 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) / oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Additionally, a two-electrode electrolytic cell assembled with P-CoCu only required an operating voltage of 1.57 V at 10 mA.cm(-2) with decent stability, which was comparable to commercial noble-metal catalysts (Pt/C//RuO2/C) and superior to recently published electrocatalyst. This work provides an anticipated perspective of non-noble metal-based bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000863278000003

Here, we describe a simple "cyclic voltammetry thorn ageing" protocol at room temperature to activate Ni electrode (AC-Ni/NF) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), by which Ni/Ni(OH)(2) heterostructure is formed at the surface. In situ Raman spectroscopy reveals the gradual growth of Ni/Ni(OH)(2) heterostructure during the first 30 min of the aging treatment and combined with polarization measurements, it suggests a positive relation between the Ni/Ni(OH)(2) amount and HER performance of the electrode. The obtained AC-Ni/NF catalyst, with plentiful Ni-Ni(OH)(2) interfaces, exhibits remarkable performance towards HER, with the low overpotential of only 30 mV at a H-2-evolving current density of 10 mA/cm(2) and 153 mV at 100 mA/cm(2), as well as a small Tafel slope of 46.8 mV/dec in 1 M KOH electrolyte at ambient temperature. The excellent HER performance of the AC-Ni/NF could be maintained for at least 24 h without obvious decay. Ex situ experiments and in situ electrochemical-Raman spectroscopy along with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Ni/Ni(OH)(2) heterostructure, although partially reduced, can still persist during HER catalysis and it is the Ni-Ni(OH)(2) interface reducing the energy barrier of H* adsorption thus promoting the HER performance.

Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of prepared electrocatalysts is evaluated by various electrochemical techniques and performance in alkaline anion exchange membrane (AAEM) electrolyzer. Among the prepared NiM/rGO series, NiCo/rGO electrocatalsyt with Ni/Co mol ratio of 3/1 exhibits the highest HER activity. The measured overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) for a low catalyst loading electrode of NiCo/rGO is as much as 137 mV less than Ni/rGO. The potential of electrolytic cell with Co3O4/rGO and NiCo/rGO electrodes as the anode and cathode, at 0.1 A cm(-2) is 1.9 V, lower than that of cell with the same anode but Ni/rGO as the cathode (2.2 V). The differences in NiM/rGO series HER activities are interpreted by various theories such as hypo-hyper-d-electronic combinations, M-H band strength and metals locations in volcano plot. Density functional theory results are also applied along with the experimental data for the explanation of NiM/rGO series HER activity trend. The results confirm the competency of employed procedure for assembling nickel alloys electrodes for alkaline water electrolysis. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the relationship between the Ni dopant concentration and HER activity remains to be explored. Herein, we prepare self-sanding Mo2C electrodes with different Ni concentrations, and employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations along with electrochemical tests to investigate the effect of the Ni dopant concentration on HER activity. The Mo and C come from the co-deposition of MoO(4)(2-)and CO(3)(2-)on a Ni substrate that supplies Ni dopant. The concentration of Ni dopant can be tuned by adjusting the temperature. The HER performance of the Mo2C electrodes with various Ni dopant concentrations is in line with DFT calculations that the optimized Ni-Mo2C-0.67 electrode has a lowest delta G(H*) value of -0.13 eV. Altogether, this work sheds light on controllably designing Ni-doped Mo2C electrodes for splitting water.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000787901200003

Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) which have some heterostructure were used to improve the exposure of active sites, revealed an excellent catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and continue to attract many studies. In this study, we design a unique flowerlike WS2/WSe2 heterostructure by heterojunction engineering. This multiscale morphology control design combines the compositional and structural advantages of WS2/WSe2 heterojunction into a hierarchical architecture, which can modulate electronic structure, remarkably facilitating the exposure of the more electrochemical active sites. As expected, the heterostructured WS2/WSe2 catalyst displays remarkable HER property with a low overpotential of 121 mV at 10 mA cm-2, and a small Tafel slope of 74.08 mV dec-1 with significant durability. We introduce the first example of flowerlike WS2/WSe2 heterostructure as a HER electrochemical catalyst. This work is expected to open a new door for the discovery of other 2D heterostructure as effective catalysts for renewable energy.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000800008800002

Here, ultrafine and ligand-free Rh nanoparticles (NPs) (2.19 nm in diameter) were in-situ decorated on porous phosphorus-functionalized carbon (PPC) prepared by pyrolyzing hyper-cross-linked networks of triphenylphosphine and benzene. The resultant Rh/PPC showed excellent hydrogen production activity from AB hydrolysis (Turnover frequency: 806 min(-1)). Kinetic investigations indicated that AB hydrolysis using Rh/PPC exhibited first-order and zero-order reactions with Rh and AB concentrations, respectively. Activation energy (E-a) toward hydrogen generation from AB with Rh/PPC is as low as 22.7 kJ/mol. The Rh/PPC catalyst was recyclable and reusable for at least four times. The oxygen- and phosphorus-functional groups are beneficial for the affinity of Rh complex on the PPC surface, resulting in ultrafine and ligand-free Rh NPs with high dispersity and ability to supply abundant surface accessibility to catalytically active sites for AB hydrolysis. This study proposes a feasible approach for the synthesis of ultrafine and ligand-free metal NPs supported on heteroatom-doped carbon by using hyper-cross-linked networks.

The three reaction zones (i) jet impact zone, (ii) slag-bulk metal zone, (iii) slag-metal-gas emulsion zone were considered for the calculation of overall refining kinetics. In the rate equations, the transient rate parameters were mathematically described as a function of process variables. A micro and macroscopic rate calculation methodology (micro-kinetics and macro-kinetics) were developed to estimate the total refining contributed by the recirculating metal droplets through the slag-metal emulsion zone. The micro-kinetics involves developing the rate equation for individual droplets in the emulsion. The mathematical models for the size distribution of initial droplets, kinetics of simultaneous refining of elements, the residence time in the emulsion, and dynamic interfacial area change were established in the micro-kinetic model. In the macro-kinetics calculation, a droplet generation model was employed and the total amount of refining by emulsion was calculated by summing the refining from the entire population of returning droplets. A dynamic FetO generation model based on oxygen mass balance was developed and coupled with the multi-zone kinetic model. The effect of post-combustion on the evolution of slag and metal composition was investigated. The model was applied to a 200-ton top blowing converter and the simulated value of metal and slag was found to be in good agreement with the measured data. The post-combustion ratio was found to be an important factor in controlling FetO content in the slag and the kinetics of Mn and P in a BOF process.									29	0	0	0	0	0	29			1073-5615	1543-1916		WOS:000426808500009

For the successful application of hydrogen-based renewable energy such as fuel cells, highly active and cost-saving metallic electro-catalysts for H2 fuel production are vital. The goal of this study is to look into the effects of alloyed molybdenum, chromium, and iron on the electrocatalytic activity of Ni-based alloys in an alkaline electrolyte for HER. SEM with an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) unit was used to determine the chemical composition of alloys. The electrocatalytic effectiveness of the explored cathodes on HER was evaluated in alkaline solutions employing open circuit potential measurements, linear polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The impact of KOH concentrations on HER rate was also investigated. Tafel curves were used to calculate the HER's kinetic parameters, and the mechanisms of the HER were discovered. EIS observations at HER's cathodic potential have been explored and compared to a theoretical model. The Ni-Cr-Mo-Fe alloy has a low over-potential of 232 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 57.7 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH media, resulting in an efficient HER. These findings indicate that the addition of Mo and Fe to Ni-Cr improves the catalytic efficiency of HER significantly. The Ni-Cr-Mo-Fe cathode is an economical and practical material for alkaline HER production. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, preparation of such catalysts is still highly challenging so far. In this work, the Mo2C-carbon nanomaterials have been prepared by controlled thermal technique. By controlling concentration of the reactants in the experimental condition, the Mo2C-carbon nanomaterials have been fabricated, which leads to decreases in contact resistance b/w Mo2C-carbon nanomaterials and graphitic carbon atoms.

Morphology and composition of Fe3N nanoparticles and alkalized Fe3N nanoparticles were characterized by XRD, TEM, EDX, XPS, Raman spectra, and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy. Electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance of Fe3N nanoparticles and alkalized Fe3N nanoparticles was analyzed by time-current curve, linear sweep voltammetry, Tafel slope, AC impedance method, and CV curve. It was found that, for alkalized Fe3N nanoparticles, their average grain sizes decreased from (80 +/- 10) nm to (70 +/- 10) nm. Their morphology changed from broken chain structure to elliptical structure, while their the phase changed partly from epsilon-Fe3N to alpha-Fe2O3, which brought about more exposed electrocatalytic activity sites when compared with the Fe3N before alkalization.

Low opening voltage, small Tafel slope, low over-potential, small AC impedance and larg chemically active surface area were achieved by the alkalized Fe3N nanoparticles, demonstrating that alkalized Fe3N is a promising excellent electrocatalyst for water splitting.									2	1	0	0	0	0	2			1000-324X			WOS:000439101800011

The morphology shows that the surface of CFP is uniformly covered by the abundant nanosheets. Benefitting from the hydrophilic, the nano-catalysts on the MoSe2/CoSe2@CFP can fully contact with water molecules and accelerate the electron transfer, therefore promoting the water splitting. The electrochemical measurement suggests that on condition that current density of 10 mA cm(-2), this nanometer electrocatalytic material has only an overpotential of 137 mV (vs. the RHE), which is lower as compared to CoSe2 (398 mV), MoSe 2 (461 mV) and CFP (595 mV). The Tafel slope of the nanocomposite is 55.9 mV dec(-1), which is lower than CoSe2 (138.1 mV dec(-1)) and MoSe2 (175.9 mV dec(-1)). Furthermore, the self-supporting nanocomposite exhibits outstanding stability in alkaline solution.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000644702700015

This method enables the analysis of the input-output relationships of a complex model containing a high dimensional input space focusing on the parameters that could be used in the control of a perfusion bioreactor process. The model used in this work is a comprehensive mathematical model for diffusion and convection for a perfusion bioreactor, which is combined with cell growth kinetics that describes the spatio-temporal glucose concentration, oxygen concentration, lactate concentration and cell density evolution in a 3D polymeric scaffold. To investigate the important features of the perfusion bioreactor process as well as possible factors underlying qualitative discrepancies a quantitative analysis of the complex kinetic mechanisms using recent development of advanced mathematical approaches to global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis through HDMR is used.

The delta D and delta O-18 indicated that groundwater was recharged by evaporated river water and unevaporated rain. The river water and shallow (<10 m) groundwater are Ca-Na-HCO3 type and the deep (>= 10 m) groundwater is Na-K-HCO3 to HCO3-Cl-SO4 to Cl-SO4-HCO3. Compared to river water, the mean DIC concentrations were 2 times higher in shallow groundwater, 7 times higher in deep groundwater and 24 times higher in island groundwater. The delta C-13(DIC) indicate that DIC production in groundwater is from organic matter oxidation and in island groundwater from organic matter oxidation and dissolution of sodium carbonate salts. The ionic and isotopic evolution of the groundwater relative to evaporated river water indicates two independent pools of DIC.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0262-6667	2150-3435		WOS:000458977900008

We investigate OER on Co3O4(001) and beta-CoOOH (01 (1) over bar2) surfaces using density functional theory calculations (DFT). We construct surface Pourbaix diagrams and investigate the theoretical overpotential for the elementary steps involved in OER on these surfaces. We show that inclusion of the Hubbard-U correction to DFT (DFT+U) is necessary to recover experimentally observed trends in the activity for the strongly correlated cobalt oxides. We find that the inclusion of the Hubbard-U correction lowers the activity of both Co3O4(001) and beta-CoOOH(01 (1) over bar2) when compared to results from pure DFT. In addition, the Hubbard-U correction shifts the location of Co3O4 and beta-CoOOH from the strong binding leg to the weak binding leg of the OER volcano plot. The calculations also suggest that the theoretical overpotentials for Co3O4 and beta-CoOOH are very nearly the same. We ascribe this to a similar local coordination environment of the active Co site in CO3O4 and CoOOH under OER conditions.									248	3	0	0	16	0	251			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000309375700054

Currently, how to prepare the stable metallic phase TMDs nanomaterials to achieve an endurable HER is one of the main challenges for practical applications. In this study, we present a reliable and tunable 1 T-phase TMDs-based synthetic strategy to atomically engineer non-metal doping sites onto metallic 1 T-WS2. Benefiting from engineering phosphorus atoms, the optimized electrocatalyst shows great enhancement in the HER. We reveal that P doped WS2 will produce 1 T-phase enriched WS2|P catalyst, which is beneficial to expose more active sites and improve the conductivity of the material. More interestingly, the HER activities of 1 T-WS2|P-5 electrocatalyst outperforms 2H-WS2, demonstrating a low overpotential (eta HER = 125 mV @ 10 mA cm-2), a small Tafel slope (HER = 73.73 mV dec- 1), and significant durability under acidic conditions. Simultaneously, the 1 TWS2|P-5 catalyst also presents an overpotential of 190 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and a low Tafel slope of 92.11 mV dec- 1 under alkaline conditions. Moreover, the catalyst has excellent catalytic stability under acidic and alkaline conditions. We introduce the first example of 1 T phase enrichment P doped WS2 as a HER electrochemical catalyst, and this work is expected to open a new door for the discovery of other 1 T-phase TMDs as effective catalysts for renewable energy.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000728401400003

The experimental design seeks to dilute rhodium with earth-abundant cobalt as a means to lower the cost of the material and achieve catalytic synergism, as reported for related bimetallic phosphides. The HER activity of Co2-xRhxP is found to be composition-dependent, with the rhodium-rich compositions being more active as compared to their cobalt-rich counterparts, with overpotentials (eta) at 10 mA/cm(geometric)(2) of 58.1-63.9 mV vs. 82.1-188.1 mV, respectively. In contrast, Co-rich Co2-xRhxP nanoparticles are active for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process in basic media, with eta= 290 mV for x=0.25. A full water electrolysis cell was created using the most active compositions for OER and HER as the anode and cathode, respectively, generating an overall eta= 390 mV. Notably, the cell became more active over a 50 h stability test, increasing by 2 mV/cm(geometric)(2) at a constant applied voltage of 1.62 V vs NHE. This enhanced activity correlates with nanoscale phase segregation of Rh in the anode. Thus, the lower overpotential achieved for Co1.75Rh0.25P relative to Co2P, and the augmented activity over time in the former, may be a consequence of restructuring of the anode driven by Rh phase-segregation. The augmentation in activity at the anode more than compensates for small losses at the cathode.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000685862600001

Herein, we have prepared nickel orthoborate (NOB) via simultaneous oxidation and reduction of nickel precursors and studied their role in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for water electrolysis. In addition, the specific role of microwave irradiation and conventional stirring in the formation of NOB was also investigated with comparative assessment of their catalytic ability in electrochemical water splitting. It was found that NOB nanoflowers prepared via microwave irradiation exhibited better OER electrocatalyst than the ones prepared by conventional heating. Interestingly, the NOB nanoflowers outperformed the commercial NiO nanopowder under the identical experimental conditions in catalyzing OER Morphological hierarchy and high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller specific surface area were attributed for their enhanced OER activity. A long run of 6 h chronopotentiometry analysis showed a negligible degradation in activity signified the high stability and endurance of NOB nanoflowers. The numbers of merits from the electrochemical characterizations revealed that NOB nanoflowers could be an alternate, efficient, and abundant OER electrocatalyst for bulk water electrolysis.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000432754700058

For the first time, the feasibility for heteroatom-doped graphene to be effectively used for decomposing NO was experimentally confirmed. The activity of different heteroatom-doped graphene follows the order: N-doped graphene > S-doped graphene > B-doped graphene. The electronegativity difference, specific area, and unique functional groups (pyridinic N and thiophene S) of the heteroatom-doped graphene play a crucial role in the catalytic performance. Furthermore, the effect of pyridinic N and thiophene S on the reaction mechanism was proposed. Pyridinic N and thiophene S can transfer extra electrons into pi-antibonding orbit of NO, thus weakening N-O bond.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000448754500058	30259742

The results are compared with the hydrolysis promoted by conventional acid (H2SO4) and OH. (from Fentons reaction) and supported by product analysis by using online HPLC (for soluble products) and online electrochemical mass spectrometry (for CO2). Cellobiose hydrolysis follows a first-order reaction, which obeys Arrhenius law over the temperature range from 2580?degrees C with different activation energies for the acid- and radical-promoted reaction, that is, approximately 118 +/- 8 and 55 +/- 1 kJ?mol-1, respectively. The high local acidity with electrochemically generated H+ on the Pt electrode increases the rate of glucose formation, however, the active electrode (PtOx) interacts with glucose and decomposes it further to smaller organic acids. In addition, O2 formed during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) lowers the selectivity of glucose by forming side-products. OH. generated on a BDD electrode first hydrolyzes the cellobiose to glucose, but rapidly attacks the aldehyde on glucose, which is further decomposed to smaller aldoses and finally formaldehyde, which is subsequently oxidized electrochemically to formic acid.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000310074200010	22907780

Here, we report the controlled synthesis of hollow CoSe2 nanocubes decorated with ultrathin MoSe2 nanosheets (CoSe2@MoSe2) as an efficient and robust bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting in a wide pH range. It is found that integrating ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets with hollow CoSe2 nanocubes can provide abundant active sites, promote electron/mass transfer and bubble release and facilitate the migration of charge carriers. Additionally, the surface electron coupling in the heterostructures enables it to serve as a source of sites for H+ and/or OH- adsorption, thus reducing the activation barrier for water molecules adsorption and dissociation. As a result, the title compound, CoSe2@MoSe2 hollow heterostructures, exhibits an overpotential of 183 mV and 309 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) toward hydrogen evolution reactions and oxygen evolution reactions in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. When applied as both cathode and anode for overall water splitting, a low battery voltage of 1.524 V is achieved along with excellent stability for at least 12 h.

Nonetheless, the influence of crystallographic surface on the HER activity of CoPS and other nonmetallic electrocatalysts remains an important open question in the design of high-performance catalysts. Herein, the HER activities of the (100) and (111) facets of CoPS single crystals were studied using complementary experimental and computational approaches. Natural (111) and polished (100) facets of CoPS single crystals were selectively exposed to reveal that the HER behaviors on these two facets are quite different, with current density-potential curves crossing near 0.35 V vs RHE. Computational analysis can explain this phenomenon in terms of strongly differing H atom adsorption free energies and H-H recombination barriers on the facets, in conjunction with a simple kinetic model. At low potential (0-0.35 V), H adsorption (Volmer step) is rate limiting due to the endergonic adsorption on the (111) facet vs exergonic adsorption on the (100) facet, yielding a faster HER rate for the latter. However, at high potential (> 0.35 V), H-2 recombination/desorption becomes limiting and thus the (111) facet, with lower associated barriers, shows better HER activity. Explicit consideration of both steps and their interplay allows for a comprehensive description of the overpotential-dependence of the HER activity. This integrated study yields additional insight into the factors which govern the facet-dependence of catalytic activity on nonmetallic electrocatalysts and can further improve the design of advanced nanostructured HER catalysts.									48	0	0	0	1	0	48			2155-5435			WOS:000424735000050

Among them, the ACE type N-prGO (negative)/NiCo2S4-AB (positive) electrode combination showed the highest specific capacitance of 321.75 Fg-1 at 2 mVs- 1 high energy density of 59.7 WhKg-1 along with good power density of 450 WKg-1 and time constant of 345 s. Furthermore, the N-prGO/NiCo2S4-AB composite studied as the electrode for HER, showed the lowest overpotential (198 mV) and Tafel slope (98 mV dec-1) values, thus indicating a potential electrode for hydrogen production. The synergetic effect between morphology and mesoporosity of the N-prGO/NiCo2S4-AB composite plays a vital role in improving charge transfer which ultimately showed the superior performance of the N-prGO/ NiCo2S4-AB composite towards dual applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000869052300001

Herein, two-dimensional oxygen-modified single layer g-C3N4 (2D O-g-C3N4) has been prepared and used as photocatalyst for degradation of environmental pollutants. The as-prepared 2D O-g-C3N4 exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity for degradation of the organic dyes and 4-chlorophenol (4-CP).

With the width of similar to 80 nm and intrinsic wide light absorption, these NCs exhibit the high activity of photocatalytic oxygen evolution (POE) with Fe(NO3)(3) as electron acceptor under visible light (lambda > 420 nm). The optimal POE rate may reach up to 27,000 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), which is the highest value so far, even at acidic condition (pH = 2.6). The systematical experiments reveal the synergistic effect of 1D Co-PDI and in-situformation of iron oxy-hydroxide (alpha-FeOOH) as cocatalyst on POE, and confirm that the fast electron-hole separation (tau(CS) = 0.07 ps) and long recombination time (tau(CR) = 106.1 ps) between adjacent +/- (01 (1) over bar) and +/- (002) side facets of Co-PDI NCs are critical.

In this work, infinite-layered SrFeO2 thin films were produced from brownmillerite SrFeO2.5 via low-temperature hydro-reduction. After the structural transition, their out-of-plane lattice constants dramatically shrank by similar to 12%; tensilely strained samples exhibited metallic character, whereas the compressively strained ones maintained the insulating behavior of their bulk form. According to X-ray linear dichroism results, this strain-mediated electronic anisotropy may be attributed to electron redistribution within degenerated orbitals. This suggests a possible mechanism for the metallic conductivity of infinite-layered SrFeO2, giving a hint for understanding emergent quantum phenomena, such as the recently discovered superconductivity in nickelates, and stimulating various applications, including in ionic conductivity and oxygen catalysis.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			1674-7348	1869-1927		WOS:000662894700001

Herein, we develop Ni3S2 nanorods growing directly on Ni foam, which act as multifunctional additive-free Ni3S2@Ni electrode for supercapacitor and overall water splitting. Based on PVA-KOH gel electrolyte, the assembled all-solid-state Ni3S2@Ni//AC asymmetric supercapacitor delivers a high areal energy density of 0.52 mWh cm(-2) at an areal power density of 9.02 mW cm(-2), and exhibits an excellent cycling stability with a capacitance retention ratio of 89% after 10000 GCD cycles at a current density of 30 mA cm(-2). For hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction in 1 M KOH, Ni3S2@Ni electrode achieves a benchmark of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 82 mV and 310 mV, respectively. Furthermore, the assembled Ni3S2@Ni parallel to Ni3S2@Ni electrolyzer for overall water splitting attains a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.61 V. The in-situ synthesis of Ni3S2@Ni electrode enriches the applications of additive-free transition metal compounds in high-performance energy storage devices and efficient electrocatalysis.									73	6	0	0	3	0	73			2095-4956			WOS:000529341200020

MoS2 is reported as a promising catalyst without noble metallic elements to accelerate the rate of the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. However, there is a real need and strong demand for further improvement of the MoS2-based catalyst. In the present study, a novel amorphous phosphorus-doped MoS2 nanocomposite (P-MoS2) is prepared by a facile hydrothermal method. Compared with crystalline molybdenum disulfide, the amorphous P-doped MoS2 catalyst exhibits much better activity with a smaller Tafel slope of 39 mV dec(-1). Moreover, good stability is also demonstrated over the P-MoS2 catalyst in acidic electrolyte. This highly active amorphous P-doped MoS2 catalyst is a promising candidate to facilitate the development of economical hydrogen production systems.									26	3	0	0	0	0	26			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000461214400001	30658349

Here, we report our findings in exploring a simple strategy for low-cost fabrication of multifunctional composites with enhanced properties. In particular, we have successfully prepared FeO(OH) nanoflake/graphene and nano-Fe3O4/graphene composites from commercially available Fe powders and graphite oxides using a simple and low-cost solid-state process, where the metallic Fe is converted to FeO(OH) nanoflake and graphite oxide is reduced/exfoliated to graphene. The resultant nano-Fe3O4/graphene composite is multifunctional, demonstrates specific capacities of 802 and 629 mA h g(-1) respectively, at 1000 and 2000 mA as an electrode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), and also displays efficient catalytic activity for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER); the nominal overpotentials are lower than those for previously reported metal-based catalysts (e.g., IrO2, RuO2, and Pt/C). The dramatically enhanced properties are attributed to the synergistic mechanochemical coupling effects between iron oxide and graphene introduced by the facile process, which is well suited for large-scale cost-effective fabrication.									66	4	0	0	2	0	66			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000357963700032	26083395

The hydrogen generation by electrochemical water splitting has received widespread attention, but it is still challenging to fabricate high-efficient electrocatalysts to decrease the kinetic energy barrier of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Loading transition metal (TM) nanoparticles (NPs) into heteroatom-doped carbon materials (HCM) has been reported as a capable scheme to increase the electrochemical activity and stability, but the synergic effect between TM surface and HCM is still worth exploring. Ascertaining that, we used metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as the sacrificial precursor to synthesis a series of Co NPs encapsulated in N-doped microporous carbon (NMPC) nanocatalysts (denoted as Co@NMPC) with different N species (such as pyrrolic, pyridinic and graphitic N). The nanocatalyst prepared at an appropriate condition displayed an outstanding HER activity with an overpotential of 193 mV in 1 M KOH solution and 132 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution to reach 10 mA cm(-2) current density. Furthermore, the results of in situ shielding tests indicate that the synergy of pyridinic NeCo site owing to the intimate contact between Co surface and NMPC play the pivotal role in boosting HER performance. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to obtain an in-depth mechanism of synergic effect between Co and NMPC. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Herein, Ru doped three dimensional (3D) porous Ni3N spheres, with tannic acid (TA) and urea as the carbon and nitrogen resources, is synthesized via hydrothermal and low-temperature treated process (Ru-Ni3N@NC). The porous nanostructure of Ni3N and the nickel foam provide abundant active sites andchannel during catalytic process. Moreover, Ru doping and rich defects favor to boost thereaction kinetics by optimizing the adsorption/desorption or dissociation of intermediatesand reactants. The above advantages enable RueNi(3)N@NC to have good bifunctional catalytic performance in alkaline media. Only 43 and 270 mV overpotentials are required forhydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions to drive a current of10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, it also showed good electrocatalytic performance in neutral andalkaline seawater electrolytes for HER with 134 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2 )and 83 mV to drive100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Remarkably, the as-designed RueNi3N@NC also ownsextraordinary catalytic activity and stability toward UOR. Moreover, using the synthesizedRueNi(3)N@NC nanomaterial as the anode and cathode of urea assisted water decomposition, a small potential of 1.41 V was required to reach 10 mA cm(-2). It can also be powered by sustainable energy sources such as wind, solar and thermal energies. In order to make better use of the earth's abundant resources, this work provides a new way to develop multifunctional green electrocatalysts. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) in animal cells: relevance to aging and normal physiology								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY				92	7			603	613		10.1139/cjz-2013-0131				JUL 2014	2014	In animal mitochondria, the four electron reduction of molecular oxygen to produce water at respiratory complex IV is the terminal step in substrate oxidation. However, respiratory complexes I, II, and III can participate in the single electron reduction of oxygen to produce the radical species superoxide. This progenitor reactive oxygen species (ROS) participates in a number of reactions that generate other ROS. These molecules may react with, and damage, intracellular macromolecules, leading to cellular dysfunction. Mitochondrial ROS production is often considered from this perspective of macromolecular damage and is central to the "oxidative damage theory of aging", which suggests the accumulation of oxidative damage in animal cells underlies the aging phenotype and limits lifespan. In this review, we discuss some experimental results accumulated over the past decade that are inconsistent with this theory. A limitation of the theory is that it presupposes mitochondrial ROS are inherently harmful. However, it is increasingly apparent that some basic cellular functions are physiologically regulated by normal levels of mitochondrial ROS. For example, cell growth and division, the apoptotic pathway, and mitochondrial fusion-fission dynamics all appear to be redox-regulated by mitochondrial ROS and perhaps the matrix manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). Therefore, it is less clear how the balance between ROS regulation of normal cellular activities and ROS-mediated macromolecular damage is maintained and how this relates to aging and longevity in animals.									6	0	0	0	5	0	6			0008-4301	1480-3283		WOS:000344954300005

Herein, a novel strategy of electron delocalization modulation for transition metal sulfides has been developed by anion hybridization. P-modified CoS2 (CoS2 divide P) nanocrystals were firstly fabricated via a gas-solid reaction and coupled with CdS nanorods to construct a composite catalyst for solar H-2 evolution reaction (HER). The CdS/CoS2 divide P catalyst shows an HER rate of 57.8 mu mol center dot h(-1), which is 18 times that of the bare CdS, 8 times that of the CdS/CoS2, and twice that of Pt/CdS. The reduced energy barrier and suppressed reverse reaction for HER on the catalyst have been predicted and explained by density functional theory (DFT) calculation. The underlying design strategy of novel cocatalysts by electron delocalization modulation may shed light on the rational development of other advanced catalysts for energy conversion.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000642046200002

Layered double hydroxide (LDH)-based nanomaterials are considered as promising electrocatalysts for OER. However, the stacking structure of LDHs limits the exposure of the active sites. Therefore, the exfoliation is necessary to expose more active sites. In addition, the defect engineering is proved to be an efficient strategy to enhance the performance of OER electrocatalysts. For the first time, this study prepares ultrathin CoFe LDHs nanosheets with multivacancies as OER electrocatalysts by water-plasma-enabled exfoliation. The water plasma can destroy the electrostatic interactions between the host metal layers and the interlayer cations, resulting in the fast exfoliation. On the other hand, the etching effect of plasma can simultaneously and effectively produce multivacancies in the as-exfoliated ultrathin LDHs nanosheets. The increased active sites and the multivacancies significantly contribute to the enhanced electrocatalytic activity for OER. Compared to pristine CoFe LDHs, the as-exfoliated ultrathin CoFe LDHs nanosheets exhibit excellent catalytic activity for OER with a ultralow overpotential of only 232 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and possesses outstanding kinetics (the Tafel slope of 36 mV dec(-1)). This work provides a novel strategy to exfoliate LDHs and to produce multivacancies simultaneously as highly efficient electrocatalysts for OER.									449	39	0	0	25	0	454			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000407048800019	28589657

Developing highly efficient OER electrocatalysts with low Ir-loading in acid is still a great challenge. Herein, we fabricated a hollow IrCoOx nanosphere via in-situ electrochemistry reconstruction strategy. The developed hollow Ir0.16Co0.84Ox electrocatalyst with low Ir-loading (51.91 mu g cm(-2)) exhibits 71-fold and 42-fold improvement in OER mass activity and TOF value compared with commercial IrO2 (1032.16 vs 14.44 A gIr(-1), 0.754 vs 0.018 s(-1)) in 0.1M HClO4, respectively. Combining with the analysis of the IrCoOx structure, the electrochemical performance reveals that the superior activity ascribes to the favorable hollow structure, the abundant crystalline/amorphous heterostructure in the IrOx-enriched shell and the atomic heterointerfaces between Co and Ir oxides, which increase the electrochemical active area, accelerate the OER kinetics and lower the charge transfer resistance (2.8 omega cm(2)). This work is anticipated to aid the design of novel low Ir-loading electrocatalysts with outstanding catalytic activity for water splitting in acidic environments.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000861254300002

Moreover, a cost-effective strategy to stabilize the highly active but unstable Ru species is desirable. Herein, we report a stable electrocatalyst for acidic OER by dispersing the Ru oxychloride active species into a manganese oxide support (RuOCl@MnOx) to form highly dispersed Ru-O-Mn without the alteration of vibrational modes and bond parameters of the MnO6 group, as suggested by Raman and synchrotron radiation characterization studies. The catalyst is stable for continuous operation over 280 h with an overpotential of 228 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and over 200 h at 100 mA cm(-2), among the most stable low-mass-loading Ru-based OER electrocatalysts in acidic media. Complementary theoretical calculations ascribe the excellent stability to its high oxidation potential and low formation/surface energies, consistent with experimental observations. The enhanced activity is attributed to the four-coordinated Ru site that bears a low overpotential determined by the formation of O* from OH*. Our work thus offers a new strategy for synthesizing robust OER electrocatalysts of PEM electrolyzers with superior activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000853777300001

First, the AWE model is experimentally validated against a polarization curve corresponding to a wide range of currents as high as 2.0 A$cm-2. In general, the simulation results compare well with the measured data and further reveal the operating characteristics of AWE cells, showing key distributions of solid/electrolyte potentials and multidimensional contours of reactant and product concentrations at various current densities. In particular, the contribution of hydroxide ion (OH-) diffusion to the ohmic losses through porous electrodes and a porous separator are quantitatively examined at low and high electrolyte flow rates. The present full 3-D AWE model provides a basic understanding of the electrochemical and transport phenomena and can be further applied to practical large-scale AWE cell and stack geometries for gridscale hydrogen production.(c)& nbsp;2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

We have judiciously designed a polyaniline (PANI)-mediated protocol for the synthesis of nickel-cobalt nitride (NCN) heterostructures on carbon cloth (CC) to be applied as catalysts for full electrochemical splitting of water. Controlled pyrolyzation of the nickel-cobalt precursor on PANI-coated CC generates assembled grass-like nanostructures of cobalt nitride (CoN) and nickel nitride (Ni3N) along with beneficial, conductive nitrogen-doped carbon layers on CC for improved electrochemical activity. The generation of numerous catalytically active centers with expeditious charge and mass transportation due to the incorporated nickel and high mechanical stability owing to the self-supporting nature of the designed material result in excellent and stable electrocatalytic performance. The designed NCN/CC electrode requires low overpotentials (eta(10)) of 247 and 68 mV to attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) during oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions, respectively, with appreciable stability (> 90% retention of the initial current density) over a 24 h long electrochemical test in 1.0 M KOH. Finally, the NCN/CC electrocatalyst is utilized to demonstrate full alkaline water splitting at a cell voltage of 1.56 V to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with tremendous stability over 240 h. Moreover, NCN/CC could afford a stable current density of 10 mA cm(-2) towards full water splitting at 1.59 V cell voltage in acidic electrolyte with 100 h long-term stability. These results suggest its prospects as a substitute for expensive noble-metal-based water splitting electrocatalysts in practical applications.									108	5	0	0	5	0	109			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000428847300026

A great deal of effort was put on the characterizations by physisorption, chemisorption and photoemission spectroscopy to describe in detail the surface states of these catalytic materials used as references for the studies of the contact reactions of hydrocarbons. The identification of the bulk phases was done by X-ray diffraction. The catalytic activity and product distribution for hexanes were determined by using 2-methylpentane as a test molecule. The results obtained with these reference materials can be used for comparison with those appearing in the literature and sometimes debated. It is worthwhile to underline the importance of the evolution and versatility of these active surfaces under the reacting mixtures due to possible decarburization and to selective surface oxidations.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0021-7689			WOS:A1996UT42000006

The two examples discussed are H-1(n,gamma)H-2 and C-12(alpha,gamma)O-16. Th, first reaction is important in Big-Bang nucleosynthesis at energies well up into hundreds of keV. The second reaction is crucial for determining the relative abundances of carbon and oxygen at the end of the helium-burning phase, but at energies below the range of current measurements. In both cases, the direct measurements are rather sparse and sometimes difficult to interpret because of level-structure uncertainties. However, the analyses we will describe make use of auxiliary data to determine the cross sections over wide ranges of energies, including those of astrophysical interest.					10th International Symposium on Capture Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy and Related Topics10th International Symposium on Capture Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy and Related Topics	AUG 30-SEP 03, 1999AUG 30-SEP 03, 1999	Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos Neutron Sci CtrLos Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos Neutron Sci Ctr	SANTA FE, NMSANTA FE, NM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0094-243X		1-56396-952-1	WOS:000089403100054

Here, we engineer the interstitial space between MoS2 nanosheets via the introduction of "spacers" to construct two-dimensional (2D) channels for favorable mass transport. The nano-sized spacers effectively separate MoS2 nanosheets, generating open and connective channels to fulfill timely reactant supply and rapid gas release. Besides, the spacer served as the physical support can prevent the collapse of 2D channels. Because of the engineering of nanostructured channels, a reduction in overpotential by approximately 100 and 360 mV at -10 and -100 mA cm(-1), respectively, a decrease in the Tafel slope from 66.7 to 39.4 mV dec(-1), and a more stable operation can be achieved. After being integrated by carbon paper, a further improved performance of 198 mV at -200 mA cm(-2) and 36 mV dec(-1) can be obtained. This work emphasizes the importance of mass-transport channels and paves a way to enhance the hydrogen evolution reaction performance.									19	5	0	0	0	0	20			1944-8244			WOS:000440956000050	29979016

Herein we report that nano-sized Mn oxide/carbon aerogel is an active and low-density catalyst toward water oxidation. The composite was synthesized by a simple, low-cost procedure with different ratio of carbon aerogel to Mn oxide and characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, electronic spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and atomic absorption spectroscopy. Then, the water-oxidizing activity of this composite was considered in the presence of cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate. The composites with a high ratio of Mn oxide to carbon aerogel are good Mn-based catalysts with turnover frequencies of similar to 0.33 (mmol O-2/(mol Mn.s)). In addition to the water-oxidizing activities of these composites under different conditions, their self-healing reaction in the presence of cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate was studied. We also compare the composite with graphene quantum dots/Mn oxide, which is not stable under these conditions. Using hydrogen to store sustainable energies is a promising strategy in the near future and our results show that nanosized Mn oxide/carbon aerogel is a promising catalyst for water-splitting systems toward hydrogen evolution.

In this review, the synthesis approaches, HER reaction mechanism, photocatalytic activity, approaches to improve the activity of transition metal phosphides were reviewed and discussed. It was showed that the transition metal phosphides have great potential to reduce the cost of photocatalyst and promising application on water splitting. The stability problem and participation of poisonous reactant and product in its synthesis reaction limit its application and developing in a certain extent, but with the continuous efforts on the development and improvement of the synthesis methods, transition metal phosphides will find wide application in water splitting.

Herein, we presented the fast microwave synthesis of the solid nanorods of Co(OH)(2) and their conversion into interconnected porous nanorods of Co3O4 by high-temperature calcination for exposing active sites, which offered a high surface area; this resulted in faster exchange of intermediates and more efficient electron transfer for enhanced OER activities in alkaline solutions. The as-synthesized solid Co(OH)(2) and calcined porous Co3O4 nanorod catalysts were characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopies (SEM and TEM), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS); finally, the OER performance was investigated for water oxidation. FE-SEM and HR-TEM images revealed the formation of solid nanorods of as-synthesized Co(OH)(2), which were broken and converted into porous interconnected nanorods after calcination at a high temperature. In 0.1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte, solid Co(OH)(2) @ 120 degrees C nanorods did not have favorable OER activity, while the Co3O4 @ 600 degrees C electrocatalyst exhibited a low onset potential (1.55 V vs. RHE) and Tafel slope (49 mV dec(-1)), maintaining robust stability for more than 18 h with negligible fading. This is mainly because the interconnected porous nanorod Co3O4 @ 600 degrees C catalyst possessed rich active boundary sites and short paths for charge/mass transport (higher reactivity of active sites) than Co3O4 @ 400 degrees C and Co(OH)(2) @ 120 degrees C. Such high catalytic activity was attributed to the sufficient exposure of the accessible active sites of porous Co3O4 electrocatalysts.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2398-4902			WOS:000472980200006

In this perspective, we discuss key aspects for the identification of active centers at the surface of electrocatalysts and important factors that influence them. The role of the surface structure, nanoparticle shape/size and the electrolyte composition in the resulting catalytic performance is of particular interest in this work.

Steam and CO(2) were used as the gasifying agents. Differences and similarities between kinetics of steam gasification and CO(2) gasification have been discussed. Comparison was conducted in terms of gasification duration, evolution of reaction rate with time and/or conversion, and effect of partial pressure on reaction rate. Reactor temperature was maintained at 900 degrees C. Partial pressure of gasifying agents varied from 1.5 bars to 0.6 bars in intervals of 0.3 bars. Steam and CO(2) flow rates were chosen so that both gasifying agents had equal amount of oxygen content. CO(2) gasification lasted for about 60 min while steam gasification lasted for about 22 min. The average reaction rate for steam gasification was almost twice that of CO(2). Both reaction rate curves showed a peak value at certain degree of conversion. For steam gasification, the reaction rate peak was found to be at a degree of conversion of about 0.3. However, for CO(2) gasification the reaction rate peak was found to be at a conversion degree of about 0.1. Reaction rates have been fitted using the random pore model (RPM). Average structural parameter, psi for steam gasification and CO(2) gasification was determined to be 9 and 2.1, respectively. Average rate constant at 900 degrees C was 0.065 min(-1) for steam gasification and 0.031 min(-1) for CO(2) gasification. Change in partial pressure of gasifying agents did not affect the reaction rate for both steam and CO(2) gasification. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to its unique layered structure and excellent stability, NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) is considered as one of the most promising electrocatalysts for OER in an alkaline environment. The further improvement of the OER performance of NiFe LDH still plagues its development. Herein, we directly applied the external magnetic field to improve the electrocatalytic activity of NiFe LDH toward OER. The overpotential of the NiFe LDH could achieve at only similar to 207 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) when the external magnetic field of 200 mT was applied. The Tafel slope of the NiFe LDH is also reduced to 41.7 mV dec(-1) under the action of a magnetic field of 200 mT. For the paramagnetic NiFe LDH, the OER magnetic field enhancing effect on the NiFe LDH probably mainly originated from the magnetohydrodynamic effect and charge transfer effect at the electrode/electrolyte interface induced by the magnetic field. The alignment of magnetic moments of NiFe LDH raised from the magnetization may also have a positive effect.[GRAPHICS].									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1011-372X	1572-879X		WOS:000795515800001

The high price of noble metals limits their further application in industry. Herein, for the first time, we report that thiophene, rhodamine B (RhB) and methyl orange (MO) can be efficiently oxidized on BiVO4 co-loaded with Ni and CuO cocatalysts (denoted as NiCuO/BiVO4) under visible light irradiation with molecular oxygen as the oxidant. Moreover, 0.05 wt% Ni-0.5 wt% CuO/BiVO4 possesses high photocatalytic activity (over 94% conversion of thiophene), which is close to Pt-RuO2/BiVO4 (99% conversion of thiophene). XPS and ESR measurements showed that the activation of molecular oxygen and oxidation of pollutant molecules simultaneously take place on BiVO4 co-loaded with Ni/Cu and CuO/Cu2O cocatalysts. The considerable enhancement of photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the simultaneous presence of the reduction cocatalyst Ni/Cu and oxidation cocatalyst CuO/Cu2O, which are beneficial for the efficient separation and transfer of the photo-generated electrons and holes. Such visible-light-responsive semiconductor loaded with earth-abundant dual cocatalysts has great potential in both solar energy conversion and further industrial applications.									23	0	0	0	3	0	23			2046-2069			WOS:000396290400011

Of late, Co oxides loaded on various carbon supports have been reported as a way to outperform Ir or Ru catalysts by improving the utilization efficiency. In this study, we introduce Co and Fe nanoparticles embedded carbon nanofibers (CoFe-CNFs), fabricated through electrospinning and pyrolysis of a polymer mixed with Co and Fe precursors. This method is a facile route for simultaneously making Co and Fe nanoparticles as well as the stable accommodation of the CoFe nanoparticles in the carbon support. We demonstrate the potential of the CoFe-CNFs as active and stable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. We conducted detailed physico-chemical characterizations to elucidate the effect of the CNFs on the OER activity and stability of the CoFe-CNFs. It is suggested that the CNFs are a medium in which OER-active CoFe alloy nanoparticles are formed homogeneously, and that carbon layers surrounding the nanoparticles are beneficial to the stability of the CoFe-CNFs in the OER.									33	2	0	0	1	0	33			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000338116700030	24879319

To solve this problem, the method of an external magnetic field was used to improve the OER catalytic performance of the alloy catalyst. In this paper, FeCo alloys with different composition ratios were prepared by an arc melting method, and OER catalysts with different compositions were obtained by annealing treatment. Under the action of a magnetic field, all three groups of catalysts showed a better catalytic performance than those without a magnetic field. The overpotentials of Fe35Co65, Fe22Co78 and Fe15Co85 at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) were reduced by 12 mV, 6 mV and 2 mV, respectively. It is found that, due to the magnetostrictive properties of FeCo alloys, the catalyst itself will generate strain under the action of a magnetic field, and the existence of strain may be the main reason for the enhanced OER performance of the magnetic field. Therefore, this work provides a new idea for the development of magnetic material catalysts and a magnetic field to improve the performance of catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2075-4701		WOS:000801726100001

For this, we calculate acidity constants at surface sites through ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and a Grand Canonical formulation of adsorbates. The resulting pH values at the point of zero charge show excellent agreement with experiment and thereby support the validity of our approach. By combining information concerning the surface coverage with the alignment of the band edges with respect to the relevant redox levels, we scrutinize the potential of the considered semiconductors as photocatalysts and identify the corresponding optimal pH ranges for hydrogen and oxygen evolution. More specifically, our results indicate that GaN stands out among these semiconductors as the most promising candidate for the overall water splitting, with the potential of further improvement through alloying. With the surface coverage, our computational analysis brings a new descriptor that is currently beyond experimental reach.									12	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900005

Water molecules serve as an electron source in photocurrent generation, and oxygen evolution occurs due to water oxidation from a gold nanostructured TiO2 photoelectrode as a half reaction of water splitting. On the basis of this property, the photocurrent generation system was applied to the plasmon-induced water-splitting system using both sides of the same strontium titanate (SrTiO3) single-crystal substrate without an electrochemical apparatus. The chamber on the side of the gold nanoparticles was the anode side, whereas the chamber on the side of the platinum plate was the cathode side. Platinum was used as a co-catalyst for hydrogen evolution. Hydrogen and oxygen were separately evolved from the anode and cathode chambers, respectively. Water splitting was induced with a relatively low chemical bias of 0.23 V due to plasmonic effects based on efficient water oxidation. Similar to the artificial photosynthesis system, we have also demonstrated ammonia formation via nitrogen fixation using ruthenium as a co-catalyst via an analogous setup of the water-splitting system.					25th IUPAC Symposium on Photochemistry25th IUPAC Symposium on Photochemistry	JUL 13-18, 2014JUL 13-18, 2014	IUPACIUPAC	Bordeaux, FRANCEBordeaux, FRANCE	1	1	0	0	0	0	2			0033-4545	1365-3075		WOS:000358056500005

It is based on the use of the cavity-microelectrode (C-ME), a tool that hosts a known amount of powder and can be filled and emptied quickly, thus allowing the quantitative, rapid, fine characterization of different materials. Here, C-MEs are used for selecting a suitable material to be used as electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction ( water oxidation) in acidic environment, a key process for the majority of the industrial electrolytic applications including the production of high purity hydrogen. A matrix of materials, each having the same low iridium oxide content, is quantitatively screened for finding the most promising one. C-MEs allowed us to measure the effective number of active Ir sites and their surface concentration. The success of this strategy is proven by the good performance of the "best'' material when tested in a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer, that allowed high hydrogen fluxes at a low cell potential (similar to 4000 dm(3) h(-1) m(-2) at less than 1.9 V).									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			0959-9428	1364-5501		WOS:000302634800024

Structure evolution of the polymorphic MnCO3 took place with the morphology obviously transforming from an initial flower-microstructure to fan-like, then to hedgehog-like hemispheres and finally to flake-spheres as the Co2+ theoretical content (Co/(Co + Mn)) increased from 0 to 20% in the solvothermal process. Cobalt ion modulated reaction-limited aggregation (RLA) is proposed in the growth mechanism. The mechanism of Co2+-induced acceleration and full growth is further investigated. The Co2+ doped manganese carbonate displays wonderful catalytic performance towards CO oxidation.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15				2046-2069		WOS:000353166700090

The anodic behaviour of a Mn5Si3 electrode in solutions of (0.5-3.0) M NaOH in the region from the E corrosion potential up to the E oxygen evolution potential was studied using the methods of polarization and impedance measurements. Results. The anodic polarization curves of Mn5Si3 have a weakly expressed region of active dissolution, regions of primary and secondary passivation, separated by a peak at a potential of ap 0.2 V (relative to the standard hydrogen electrode), and an area of oxygen evolution. In the first passive region, passivation of silicide is achieved due to the formation of Mn(OH)2 on its surface. In the second passive region it is achieved due to the formation of MnO2. Oxygen evolution is accompanied by the formation of MnO4--ions. Silicon is selectively (chemically and electrochemically) dissolved from the surface layer of silicide. The composition of the films on Mn5Si3 may include small amounts of silicon dioxide and silicates along with the products of metal oxidation. The impedance spectra of Mn5Si3 at the potentials of the first passive region consist of a capacitive semicircle with an offset centre at high frequencies and an almost vertical straight line at low frequencies. Using the capacitance values corresponding to the low-frequency line of the impedance spectra, we can calculate the magnitude of the change in the thickness of the passivating film with the potential ddelta/dE depending on the potential and the concentration of NaOH. The derivative ddelta/dE varies in the range of 2.1-17.5 nm/V and decreases with increasing electrode polarization and increasing electrolyte concentration. At the potentials of the second passive region, the slope of the low-frequency line on the impedance spectra is ~45deg, which corresponds to the diffusion impedance. The formation of MnO2 is accompanied by diffusion control over the mass transfer of the implanted OH--ions into the surface passivating film Mn(OH)2 towards the silicide/film interface. Conclusion. The process of oxygen evolution on the Mn5Si3 electrode reveals kinetic features that are characteristic for the Mn electrode. The Tafel slope of the E, lgicurves for silicide is (0.15-0.17) V, the reaction order for OH-ions is 0.76, and the dependence of the electrode potential on the solution concentration is -0.12 V. The process rate depends on the discharge rate of OH-ions.									1	0	1	0	0	0	1			1606-867X			INSPEC:19199246

In this work, we have developed a novel hierarchical heterostructure of CuxS nanosheets/Co nanowire arrays supported on three-dimensional Ni foam (Co@CuxS NWs/3D-NF) as highly active bifunctional electrocatalysts for both the hydrogen (HER) and oxygen (OER) evolution reactions. Inheriting from the advantage of core-shell heterostructure, mesoporous characteristic and chemical coupling effect between Co core and CuxS shell layer, the as-synthesized Co@CuxS NWs/3D-NF exhibits high catalytic activity toward HER and OER with requiring small overpotential of 104.6 and 292.2 mV to reach current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Furthermore, assembled Co@CuxS NWs/3D-NF-based electrolyzer shows remarkable performance with a low operating voltage of 1.55 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and high long-term stability, which offers a favorable evidence for potential of our catalyst in practical application.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000606528900001

Herein, for the first time, a coaxial ultrathin Co1-yFeyOx nanosheet coating on carbon nanotubes (denoted as Co1-yFeyOx/CNTs) is prepared by a one-step pyrolysis method. The fabrication procedure is ultrafast and uncomplicated, furthermore, it does not need any reducing agent, alkali, or surfactant. In 1.0 M KOH, the obtained optimal hybrids Co0.8Fe0.2Ox/CNTs25 (wt%) catalyze oxygen evolution reactions (OER) with a very sharp onset potential (similar to 1.45 V) and an exceptional over-potential (0.28 V, at 10 mA cm(-2)) for more than 14 h, benefiting from the abundant active sites of ultrathin Co0.8Fe0.2Ox nanosheets, the hierarchical tubular architecture, and the strong cooperative effect among Co, Fe and CNTs. Remarkably, the excellent activity and durability of Co0.8Fe0.2Ox/CNTs25 (wt%) for the OER is superior to commercial RuO2 and many other highly active precious-metal/transition-metal catalysts reported to date. The design concept for tubular iron-group binary metal nanosheet hybrids creates new pathways for energy technologies.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13				2046-2069		WOS:000383903500028

In this regard, Hybrids composed of transition metals and MOF materials are an attractive possibility to be explored. Such hybrid materials show modified structures along with improved electrocatalytic performance due to the synergistic effects of the two materials. In this paper, we report UiO-66/MoS2 hybrid catalyst synthesized via two different synthesis routes. Their comparative characteristics and activity for overall water-splitting are also discussed. It was observed that Hybrid-2 showed better electrocatalytic performance with Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) overpotential of 129 mV (at n10) and Tafel slope of 51 mV/dec. For Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), it showed an overpotential of 180 mV (at n10) and Tafel slope of 64 mV/dec. Moreover, the catalyst was stable for longer periods with very slight loss of activity. The improved results can be attributed to the interaction of the key characteristics of two materials which led to unique architecture of the hybrid and improved electrical connectivity with an increased exposed active surface area that assists in the transportation of charge carriers to the electrode and electrolyte interface. The results suggest that UiO-66/MoS2 hybrids are promising as active and non-expensive electrocatalytic catalyst for overall water-splitting catalyst. The findings also speculate an insight on the effect of the synthesis route on the structure and activity of MOF hybrids with robust catalytic performance.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2468-8231			WOS:000780758400006

In this paper, we investigated how an ultrafast carbothermal shock treatment can be used to convert spent cathodes of LIBs (LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2) into Ni/Ni-Mn-Co-O (N/NMCO) composites with a remarkable electrocatalytic performance toward oxygen evolution, oxygen reduction, and hydrogen evolution reactions. The converted spent cathodes can be employed as cathodes and anodes in an overall water-splitting system, and they displayed a low overpotential of 1.61 V and remarkable stability at different current densities. Moreover, N/NMCO electrodes can be used as cathodes in rechargeable Zn-air batteries, which displayed long-term stability (>30 h), high specific capacity (781 mA h g(-1)) and peak power density (137 mW cm(-2)), as well as a small charge/discharge voltage gap of 0.71 V. Thus, our study offers a "waste-to-treasure" strategy for the regeneration of spent cathodes of LIBs and their applications in other advanced energy storage and conversion technologies.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000781732900003

Analysis of the results of theoretical and experimental studies of hydrogen accumulation in graphene materials confirms the possibility of creating on their basis systems for reversible hydrogen storage, which combine high capacity, stability, and the possibility of rapid hydrogen evolution under conditions acceptable for practical use. Recent advances in the development of chemically and heat-resistant graphene-based membrane materials make it possible to create new gas separation membranes that provide high permeability and selectivity and are promising for hydrogen purification in processes of its production from natural gas. The characteristics of polymer membranes that are currently used in industry for the most part can be significantly improved with small additions of graphene materials. The use of graphene-like materials as a support of nanoparticles or as functional additives in the composition of the electrocatalytic layer in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells makes it possible to improve their characteristics and to increase the activity and stability of the electrocatalyst in the reaction of oxygen evolution.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			1995-0780	1995-0799		WOS:000603308200003	33391617

It was found that the voltage between the cathode and the anode would increase during the long time electrolysis process, for this reason the electrolytic process would be unsustainable. After the experimental investigations carried out by constant potential electrolysis, constant current electrolysis, pH test and KHCO_3 concentration analysis of anode electrolyte before and after the electrolysis, the increase in cell voltage might be caused by the following process: H~+, that was generated from the anodic oxygen evolution reaction, reacted with HCO_3~- to form water and CO_2, and the HCO_3~- in the anode chamber was consumed; then K~+ in the anode chamber was forced to spread into the cathode chamber which led to the decrease of the electrolyte concentration in the anode chamber. Therefore, the conductivity of the electrolyte solution in the anode chamber decreased, resulting in the rise of the anode potential. This phenomenon may happen in the alkaline electrolyte in an anode cell, therefore, in order to ensure the electrolysis process sustainable and keep high energy conversion efficiency, the anode electrolyte cannot be any alkaline substance.			采用自制的H 型电解池开展了KHCO_3溶液中电化学还原CO_2制甲酸的研究. 研究发现,在电解池中长时间电解时阴阳两极间的电压(槽电压)会持续升高,导致电解过程不可持续. 经过恒电位电解、恒电流电解、pH 测试以及电解前后阳极室KHCO_3浓度分析等实验研究,作者发现,这是由以下过程引起的:阳极上的析氧反应产生的H+ 与电解液中的HCO_3~- 反应生成水和CO_2,导致阳极室的HCO_3~- 的消耗,之后阳极室的K~+ 被迫扩散进入阴极室而导致阳极室电解质浓度下降. 因此,阳极室电解液导电性下降,进而引起阳极电位的升高. 研究发现,阳极电解液具有碱性时,都可能发生此种现象. 因此,为保证电解过程可持续且保持高的能量转换效率,阳极液的电解质不能含任何具有碱性的物质.						1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1006-3471			CSCD:5947180

Herein, we report that PEC water splitting output performance of undoped ZnO nanorods (NRs) is firstly enhanced by p-type Sb doping on oxygen evolution reaction (OER), grown by a facile chemical bath deposition. The specimen with 2 at% Sb-doped ZnO NRs (2 at% Sb-ZnO NRs) yields the highest photocurrent density of 1.07 mA/cm(2) under a Xe lamp with a power of 100 mW/cm(2), two times that of the undoped ZnO NRs (0.54 mA/cm(2)). Additionally, piezotronic effect is applied to further enhance PEC output performance using an in-house fabricated device. When the sample of 2 at% Sb-ZnO NRs is subject to a strain varying from a compressive strain of epsilon = - 0.15% to a tensile strain of epsilon = 0.15%, the photocurrent density varies from 0.71 mA/cm(2) to 1.37 mA/cm(2) accordingly caused by the change of the piezopotential-induced Schottky barrier height. Therefore, compared to the strain-free condition of the undoped ZnO NRs, the PEC photocurrent density gained an enhancement of 98% by p-type Sb doping and a further enhancement of 28% by piezotronic effect through tensile strain, leading to 154% overall enhancement. In this work, we propose a feasible scheme to develop high-performance ZnO-based photoelectrodes for PEC water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2329-2229	2329-2237		WOS:000761849900001

However, the very negative reduction potential of ETMs has posed great challenges for the synthesis of the desired alloy catalysts, not to mention the structure-controlled synthesis. Here an autocatalytic surface reduction-assisted strategy is reported to realize the controllable synthesis of ultrathin PtW alloy nanowires (NWs). The experimental evidence and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the preformed Pt NWs in the synthesis serve as the catalyst to facilitate the reduction of W-x(+) species through the autocatalytic surface reduction mechanism. Using the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as a model reaction, the as-synthesized PtW NWs/C catalyst shows an ultralow overpotential of 18 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a high mass activity of 6.13 A mg(Pt)(-1) at an overpotential of 100 mV, ranking it among the most active catalysts. The dual roles of alloyed W atoms are further uncovered by theoretical simulations, involving the ensemble effect for accelerating H2O dissociation and a ligand effect for optimizing the hydrogen adsorption strength.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000748353200001

Meteoritic aqueous fluid inclusions are not rare, but they are very tiny and their characterization is at the state of the art for most analytical techniques. Meteoritic fluid inclusions offer us a unique opportunity to study early Solar System brines in the laboratory. Inclusion-by-inclusion analyses of the trapped fluids in carefully selected samples will, in the immediate future, provide us detailed information on the evolution of fluids as they interacted with anhydrous solid materials. Thus, real data can replace calculated fluid compositions in thermochemical calculations of the evolution of water and aqueous reactions in comets, asteroids, moons and the terrestrial planets.This article is part of the themed issue 'The origin, history and role of water in the evolution of the inner Solar System'.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1364-503X	1471-2962		WOS:000399292900003	28416725

In this work, Fe-doped NiS2 with different doping contents was successfully prepared through a one-pot solvothermal process utilizing a PEGylated deep eutectic solvent. The morphology, microstructure, electronic structure and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activity of the synthesized samples are systematically investigated. The sample with an Fe content of similar to 16% possesses the best electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 257 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 41 mV dec(-1) and a superior stability for 60 h at similar to 20 mA cm(-2). Stable and homogenous Ni(Fe) oxide porous nanostructures with residual S, including pores of several nanometers, were found after the long-term OER test. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy mapping indicate that the enhanced OER property may be attributed to the local composition variation of Fe at the nanoscale and the synergic effect of Fe and Ni. This study provides insights into the rational design and synthesis of superior transition-metal based water splitting electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2633-5409		WOS:000835749300001

Electrochemical and corrosion characteristics of these electrodes were determined in [Fe(CN)(6)](3-)/[Fe(CN)(6)](4-) system and Na2SO4 solution with the application of cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The electrode active surface area and the activity towards oxygen evolution were evaluated. Moreover, corrosion resistance of the tested electrodes was estimated by determination of basic corrosion parameters. The introduction of WO3 into the oxide layer of the electrodes resulted in a decrease in electrode active surface area and in the number of active sites. The modified electrodes revealed lower activity towards OER but higher activity in organic oxidation. However, their stability was significantly higher in comparison with the non-modified electrode. Corrosion characteristics of the tested electrodes proved the highest corrosion resistance in the case of the electrode modified with 3% WO3. The modification of TiO2-RuO2/Ti with WO3 seems to be advantageous in the application in electrochemical and photoelectrochemical degradation of organic pollutants.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000486206000005

High activity toward NO reduction can be achieved on an AC/Ni catalyst obtained by thermal decomposition of the precursor nitrate at 200 degrees C. The role of active carbon in the catalytic reduction of NO with CO at different temperatures has been discussed. At low temperatures (below 200 degrees C), when there is no substantial gasification of the carbon, dissociative adsorption of NO along with Nz evolution and oxygen accumulation on the carbon surface has been observed, The active sites occupied by the oxygen evolved during the NO decomposition are regenerated by the CO reducing agent. At high temperatures the C-O complexes evolved from the carbon surface participate in NO reduction as a second reducing agent. The effect of the oxygen-containing functional groups and the available nitrate groups on catalyst activity has been discussed.

The highest film charge densities can be reached by using higher withdrawal rates of the substrate electrode from the Ir-containing sol solution, as well as by applying multiple successive coats. Allowing films to dry at cn. 100 degreesC also yields higher charge densities. The kinetics of the lr(III)/(IV) redox process are excellent, significantly higher, on a mole or mass IrOx basis, than for IrOx films formed by potential cycling/pulsing of standard bulk Ir electrodes in acidic solutions. The SG-derived Films are electrochromic. highly capacitive, appear to be particularly catalytic toward the oxygen evolution reaction, and have excellent adhesive properties at Au. It appears that small area planar substrates are preferred over curved (e.g., wire) electrodes in terms of SG-formed IrOx film uniformity and the maximum achievable charge density. The measurement of the mass of fresh SG-formed Ir films and the maximum IrOx charge density which can be obtained indicates that one out of every 2 to 3 Ir atoms are used in IrOx formation.

Herein, different surface structures of CoO in the form of chemically deposited films were fabricated via AACVD technique, directly over the transparent fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrodes just by varying the deposition times. The as-prepared films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As the deposition time is varied, the surface structure of the CoO changes from nanoparticles that are formed just in 15 min to nanobuds at 30-min deposition, and finally to a homogeneously distributed dense population of nanoflowers in 45 min. The evolution of these structures was also accompanied by a preferential exposure of (111) facets and an increasing number of oxygen defects which resulted in an enhancement of electrocatalytic activity towards water oxidation. The CoO nanoflowers (CoO-NFs) with highest number of these active oxygen vacancies showed the best performance with an overpotential of 325 mV vs RHE for a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) while having a Taefl slope of 98 mV/dec, a mass activity of 35.2 A/g, and the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of 1069 mu F. However, more importantly, the current density for CoO-NF jumped sharply to the values above 200 mA/cm(2) with potential less than 1.8 V vs RHE, thereby meeting the commercialization standards while still providing high stabilities of oxygen generation, current densities, and repeated cycling. Such a performance can be considered remarkable for a material fabricated via a rapid and facile synthetic route and is directly deposited on a low cost and relatively less conductive FTO substrate which can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the larger specific surface area of 3D structure and the high distribution of oxygen defects.[GRAPHICS].									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000515858100001

Combining experiments and theoretical calculations, we demonstrated that F dopants could activate the Co and S sites of CoS2 in CoS2@NF composites prepared via one-step hydrothermal method and contribute to enhance the intrinsic electrical conductivity, achieving a significantly improved activity of water splitting. The improved surface wettability in F-doped CoS2@NF composites ensures rapid electrolyte penetration and accelerates migration of hydroxyl as well as oxygen release. Furthermore, the F-doped CoS2@NF composites exhibit remarkable electrocatalytic activity and excellent long-term operational stability for overall water splitting in alkaline and neutral media. Predominantly, our work could be explored to enhance and understand the catalytic properties of other transition metal sulfides, and be also expected for further progress achieved with other nonmetal element dopants.

Here, a class of perovskite cathode catalyst with a micro-tubular structure has been developed by controlling bi-functionality from different Ru and Ni dopant ratios. A micro-tubular structure is achieved by the activated carbon fiber (ACF) templating method, which provides uniform size and shape. At the perovskite formula of LaCrO3 , the dual dopant system is successfully synthesized with a perfect incorporation into the single perovskite structure. The chemical oxidation states for each Ni and Ru also confirm the partial substitution to Bsite of Cr without any changes in the major perovskite structure. From the electrochemical measurements, the microtubular feature reveals much more efficient catalytic activity on ORR and OER, comparing to the grain catalyst with same perovskite composition. By changing the Ru and Ni ratio, the LaCr0.8Ru0.1Ni0.1O3 micro-tubular catalyst exhibits great bi-functionality, especially on ORR, with low metal loading, which is comparable to the commercial catalyst of Pt and Ir. This advanced catalytic property on the micro-tubular structure and Ru/Ni synergy effect at the perovskite material may provide a new direction for the next-generation cathode catalyst in metal-air battery system.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0304-128X	2233-9558		WOS:000470096700018

Instability in photocurrent during water oxidation applications has previously been attributed to formation of destructive peroxide intermediates. Under constant illumination, repeated cycles of poising WO3 electrodes at 0.98 V vs Ag/AgCl in pH 1 sulfate solution followed by measuring the open-circuit potential for several hours show reversibility in the photocurrent decay. This behavior is attributed to photochromic HXWO3 generated at low concentration within the electrode, which serves to increase the donor density. The Mott-Schottky analysis of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements on WO3 electrodes before and after performing the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) exhibits a decrease in donor density from 2.8 X 10(22) to 6.0 X 10(21) cm(-3) with a corresponding 110 mV positive shift in the flat-band potential, indicative of tungsten oxidation during the OER. Tungsten oxidation is corroborated by a decrease in W5+ signal in the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data. Measuring the OER rate by gas chromatography during water oxidation shows concurrent recovery of catalytic activity after resting at open circuit under illumination, illustrating the key role of HxWO3 during photoelectrocatalysis.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			1932-7447			WOS:000456350600018

By performing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we revealed the detailed reaction mechanism and the key reaction sites on surface of P-doped MoS2 for ORR catalysis. The double P-doped MoS2 (2P-MoS2) is calculated to be more stable than the single P-doped MoS2 (P-MoS2), and the configuration with two P atoms in neighboring sites exhibits the highest stability. The surface of P-doped MoS2 is found highly active for dissociation of O-2. Comparative calculations reveal that P-MoS2 is unsuitable as ORR catalyst due to the high dissociation barrier of H2O (1.19 and 2.06 eV for the first and second adsorbed H2O), while the 2P-MoS2 shows good ORR catalytic activity with much lower dissociation barrier of H2O (0.62 eV). Furthermore, we elucidated that the ORR catalytic activity in 2P-MoS2 originates from the activated S2 atom, which provides an extra adsorption site for the first H2O and the following OH group benefited from the enhanced hydrogen bond interaction. Our results illustrate the mechanisms of doped MoS2 based catalysts and provide rational way for designing ORR catalysts with high activity.									21	2	0	0	3	0	22			2045-2322			WOS:000443746600012	30185985

Herein, for the first time, CePO4 is successfully introduced to the CoP/CePO4 heterostructures with rich interfaces as electrocatalysts toward the OER. The hybrid precursors containing typical ZIF-67 and CePO4 nanowires have been transformed to the heterostructural CoP/CePO4 materials, where different phases of CePO4 are regulated by temperature-controlled carbonization and subsequent phosphidation treatment. Through the elaborate design route, the strongly coupled heterojunction interfaces between CoP and CePO4 entities can be produced. The carbon coating with a high defect, the phase regulation of CePO4, and the interfacial interaction would enhance the intrinsic activity of the active site and facilitate charge transport, thereby leading to the excellent OER performance. As a consequence, the CoP/CePO4-900 electrocatalyst can drive a 10 mA cm(-2) current density at an overpotential of 318 mV for OER with favorable kinetics and good durability. This study may open up a reasonable scheme to promote the efficient energy conversion of an electrocatalyst through different phase-related interfaces and phase engineering.									3	0	0	0	0	0	2			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000711024500035

The modified electrodes contained CNT, Bi, or a combination of the two. Their microstructure and electrochemical properties were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction, linear sweep voltammetry and cyclic voltammetry. Further, their electrochemical active surface area was determined, and their capacity to generate hydroxyl radicals and induce electrochemical degradation of methyl orange was studied. Compared with pure PbO2, electrodes with CNT-PbO2, Bi-PbO2, and the Bi-CNT combination had PbO2 films with educed crystal sizes, which increased their specific surface area and active sites for electrochemical reactions. The Bi-CNT-PbO2 electrode had the highest oxygen evolution over potential, while the generation of hydroxyl radical (.OH) and the electrocatalytic degradation of methyl orange were significantly increased with the Bi-CNT electrode. It was demonstrated that this modification can significantly enhance performance in electro-oxidation processes, including degradation compounds. Such improvements can be of importance for the removal of organic pollutants from effluents.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			1203-8407			WOS:000394869900004

However, obtaining fundamental information on this buried interface has proven extremely difficult using modem surface and interfacial characterization methods. Using copper oxide growth over copper metal, examined between RT and 250degreesC, as a model system, we have delineated the fundamental physical chemical processes that determine the oxide growth and instabilities at the metal-oxide interface. Application of controlled thermal growth studies in combination with linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) has allowed experimental access to the metal-oxide interface with surprising characterization capabilities. The methodologies involved and the physical chemical phenomena will be discussed in context of the application of modem surface characterization methods including pulsed field desorption mass spectrometry, XPS combined with depth profiling and angular resolved methods. The evolution and alteration of the precursor oxide that develops at low temperatures <75degreesC will be explained on the basis of previously observed metal oxide interfacial phenomena involving coupled bulk and surface reactions. The nature of the interfacial zone will be discussed with electron transfer and oxygen absorption models that are applicable to oxide growth and instabilities in general.

Its surfaces are often covered by hydrophilic O and OH mixed groups. To find the effect of the O and OH mixed groups on HER, we studied the HER activity for M2XO2-2x(OH)(2x) (M = Ti, V; X = C, N) by first-principle calculations. Results indicate that HER activity is closely related to OH-occupied coverage (x). For Ti2CO2-2x(OH)(2x), excellent HER activity could be maintained when the OH-occupied coverage was not larger than 1/3. For Ti2NO2-2x(OH)(2x), V2CO2-2x(OH)(2x), and V2NO2-2x(OH)(2x), high HER activity was obtained when OH-occupied coverage reached 4/9, 1/3, and 5/9, respectively. Next, we analyzed the charge-transfer density and found that the charges on the oxygen groups were strongly affected by the OH-occupied coverage. Finally, we revealed the variation of HER activity that oxidizability of O groups is weakened with increasing OH-occupied coverage. In this paper, we propose a new method to obtain the optimal HER activity for M2XO2-2x(OH)(2x) by adjusting the OH-occupied coverage of the surfaces, which is useful in industrial hydrogen production.									8	3	0	0	0	0	10			1000-6818			WOS:000408671800015

Among these are the transition metal dichalcogenides, layered double hydroxides, metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) and the black phosphorus family of monoelemental compounds. In this Review, we discuss the similarities of these 2D materials and highlight differences in their electrochemical and electrocatalytic properties.

Test results of viscosity, strength and gelling time tests showed that viscosity was increased with increasing PVA content and increased significantly when the content was over 0.0050%. Gel strength was enhanced and gelling time was prolonged when adding PVA of 0.0025% and 0.0050%, and gel performance was improved. However, physical properties of the electrolyte could not be improved, when the content of PVA was further increased. Cyclic voltammetry and AC impedance spectroscopy test results showed that adding PVA of 0.0050% could improve the reaction current and power of electrode, increase the utilization of active material and oxygen evolution potential, suppress self-discharge and lower impedance of electrolyte,electrochemical reaction charge transfer resistance and capacitance.			为改善胶体电解质的物理性质，提高电化学性能，制备了不同聚乙烯醇(PVA)含量的胶体电解质，黏度、强度和胶凝时间测试结果表明，黏度随PVA含量的提高而增加，在含量0.0050%之后增加显著；加入0.0025%和0.0050% PVA,凝胶强度增大，胶凝时间延长，凝胶性能得到改善，但继续提高PVA含量对改善电解质的物理性质不利。循环伏安和交流阻抗测试结果表明，加入0.0050% PVA可提高电极的反应电流和电量，有利于提高活性物质的利用率、析氧过电位，抑制自放电，降低电解质的阻抗、电化学反应的电荷转移电阻和电容。						0	0	0		0	0	0			1000-6613			CSCD:5209745

It has the advantage of being able to produce hydrogen using only renewable energy. To expand the use of water electrolysis, it is mandatory to reduce energy consumption, cost, and maintenance of current electrolyzers, and, on the other hand, to increase their efficiency, durability, and safety. In this study, modern technologies for hydrogen production by water electrolysis have been investigated. In this article, the electrochemical fundamentals of alkaline water electrolysis are explained and the main process constraints (e.g., electrical, reaction, and transport) are analyzed. The historical background of water electrolysis is described, different technologies are compared, and main research needs for the development of water electrolysis technologies are discussed.									219	5	0	0	7	1	227			0100-4042	1678-7064		WOS:000325694900017

The redox properties of photoexcited molecules and the operating mechanism of light-driven systems are first considered. The mechanism of water oxidation carried out by higher plants and green algae - which is actually one of the most important biochemical reactions - as well as that of artificial photosystems, up-to-now designed trying to simulate the natural process with higher efficiency and simplicity, are likewise discussed.

The electrocatalysts (IrOx, Pt, Co3O4) were prepared on a drop cast film of BiVW-O on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) with a picoliter solution dispenser or photodeposition with light irradiation through an optical fiber. The prepared arrays were tested for PEC water oxidation in 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) using scanning electrochemical microscopy modified with an optical fiber. Pt and Co oxide electrocatalysts showed an enhanced photocurrent for PEC water oxidation, while the other metal oxide catalysts including IrOx, which is known as an excellent water oxidation electrocatalyst on a metal substrate, were not effective. These results were confirmed with bulk film studies. A cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) electrocatalyst was also tested as a bulk film on BiVW-O and showed improvement for PEC water oxidation. Preliminary characterization (X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) was also performed for these catalysts. The results:indicate that considerations of the semiconductor photocatalyst/electrocatalyst interface are important in determining the effectiveness of materials for the photodriven OER.									217	10	0	0	25	0	223			1932-7447			WOS:000291896000030

During oxidation, which switches the conductivity of the polymer from an insulating state to metallic conduction, anions are intercalated in the polymer to neutralize the positive charge on the polymer backbone. The electrochemical quartz micro balance allows comparison of the coulometric data with the mass of anions intercalated during this process. A small amount of solvent is additionally incorporated during this process. Mechanical stress within the film causes a visible bending of the electrode. Ionic and electronic resistances are parallel and the lower value determines the reaction site. The polymer films have a high ionic conductivity necessary for hydrogen and oxygen evolution at the substrate surface underneath the polymer film. Electron transfer reactions yield data of the resistance and the pore size of the polymer.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are applied in the field of OER electrocatalysis because of their unique structure, but the high impedance and unstable framework during pyrolysis remain unresolved. Here, MIL-88A (iron-based MOF) was modified by hydrolysis and loading Co(OH)(2) to improve the catalytic activity. The electrochemical results showed that the Co(OH)(2)/MIL-88A achieved the optimized performance with the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 278 mV (vs RHE). Density functional calculations (DFT) combined with characterization tests suggest that electrons transfer from Co(OH)(2) to MIL-88A at the interface of the heterostructure, leading to a larger hole electron pair density. D-band theory calculations demonstrated that the synergistic effect of MIL-88A and Co(OH)(2) in heterostructure strengthens the adsorption between active sites and adsorbate. The above proofs are the source of the excellent OER performance of the Co(OH)(2)/MIL-88A. The finding has certain reference significance for the heterogeneous treatment of iron-based MOF catalysts.

Herein, we report a high-performance OER electrocatalyst consisting of bimetallic FeNi3 nanoparticles encapsulated in hierarchical carbon nanomaterial, denoted as FeNi3@NCNT. Through a stepwise strategy, hollow carbon nanorods with abundant carbon nanotubes can be successfully calcined from rod-like NiOF-1-Fe, which are hydrolyzed to the initial NiOE-1 by Fe(iii) ions. The optimal FeNi3@NCNT catalyst exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance with a low overpotential of 264 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 58.5 mV dec(-1), and a robust stability over 10 hours compared to the control samples. This enhanced OER arises from the unique hollow nanorod modified with a nanotube structure, a large surface area, a rich nitrogen content, and the synergistic effect between Ni and Fe species. Indeed, it is catalyzed by in situ generated Fe coupling with NiOOH in carbon nanotubes, which is validated by the subsequent theoretical calculations. This work enables insights into the mechanism of Fe-doped Ni oxyhydroxides for efficient OER and adds to the increasing understanding of the design and synthesis of novel catalysts for efficient energy conversion and storage.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000826554700001

Unlike traditional nanocatalysts, the catalytic performance of SACs is highly dependent on the scale of catalysts, low-coordination nature, and interaction between the catalysts and support materials. The size of metal particles is a key factor in determining the performance of the catalysts as the specific activity per metal atom usually increases with decreasing size of metal particles; the small size of metal particles serves as the catalytically active sites. Furthermore, the support materials should have not only an extremely large surface area to host a lot of catalysts in their structures, but also the ability to capture the catalysts appropriately. 2D materials, which have a high specific surface-to-volume ratio and van der Waals forces to capture catalysts, have been considered good support materials. A detailed discussion on the preparation, characterization, and catalytic performance, especially for water splitting and carbon dioxide utilization reactions using SACs supported on 2D materials, is provided; the main advantages of SACs and the associated challenges for improving their catalytic performance are highlighted.									52	2	0	0	3	0	52			2366-9608			WOS:000485927700007

The effects of various plasma operational conditions and fiber moisture content on free radical products are evaluated. It demonstrates that both free radical formation reaction and coupling reaction occur and compete with each other on the fiber surface during the plasma treatment and the final free radical outcomes are determined by the competition results, depending on treatment conditions. Fiber moisture content not only has a tremendous influence on the concentration of the trapped free radicals but also affect their evolution. Radicals trapped in moistened fibers show poorer stability than those trapped in dry fibers during storage in nitrogen. However, when the plasma treated samples are stored in a dry environment allowing oxygen access to the fiber surface, free radicals trapped in dry fibers decay rapidly while those in moistened fibers increase within the chosen storage period.

We have demonstrated conditions that provide negligible amount of FEL induced damage of the sample.

Here we report a series of microporous organic polymers containing photoactive conjugated organic semiconductor units as heterogeneous photocatalysts for a visible-light-promoted, highly selective bromination reaction of electron-rich aromatic compounds using HBr as a bromine source and molecular oxygen as a clean oxidant. Via a simple Friedel Crafts alkylation reaction, the microporous organic polymers were obtained by cross-linking of organic semiconductor compounds with defined valence and conduction band positions. The utilization of the simply prepared porous polymer-based photocatalytic systems opens new opportunities toward a sustainable and efficient material design for catalysis.									103	5	0	0	10	0	103			2155-5435			WOS:000369774900072

These rocks oxidize and produce long-term expansive reactions that damage concrete structures, leading to important economic and risk related repercussions. The present study analyses several aspects that affect the oxidation process of the aggregate such as the existence of preferential paths for the entrance of the oxidizing agent and the conversion process of the chemical elements involved in the reaction. For that, host rock samples containing pyrrhotite were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. The results shows that the pyrrhotite appears in bands that create planes of weakness and present cracks that serve as preferential paths for the entrance of oxygen. Furthermore, a new representation is proposed for the oxidation process.									7	0	0	0	0	1	7			0465-2746	1988-3226		WOS:000345866800009

The catalytic activity is enhanced in presence of complexes adsorbed on alumina. An increase in the amount of catalyst and pH increase the rate of the reaction. The variation of [H2O2] at a constant pH shows that the values of k are nearly constant irrespective of [H2O2]. The effect of steric hindrance due to secondary ligand on the kinetics of decomposition of hydrogen peroxide has also been studied. Various thermodynamic parameters have been calculated. The probable reaction mechanisms have been suggested in which an intermediate surface complex is thought to be responsible for the enhancement of the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0376-4710	0975-0975		WOS:000235495600007

These short-lived radicals transfer one unpaired electron to arene diazonium salts, resulting in the homolytic dediazotization products nitrogen and the corresponding aromatic hydrocarbon. In addition, the singlet excited state of some ketones (F, TX, MAc) and the triplet state of all ketones react with the diazonium salts in the same manner. Using a kinetic scheme, relevant kinetic equations can be derived, which describes the role of each pathway in the overall process.

The nanostructure can enhance the electrochemical performance of perovskite oxides by enlarging the catalytic active sites. In this study, nano-size Nd0.67Sr0.33CoO3-delta (NSC) perovskite particles with a particle size of 20-50 nm and a specific surface area of 12.759m(2) g(-1) were successfully synthesized by a microemulsion method. The NSC perovskite particles exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity particularly in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a high limiting current density of 33.68 mA m(-2) at 0.9 V vs. (Hg/HgO). This excellent catalytic activity can be ascribed to the existence of Co3+ and the enlarged surface area. Co3+ provides catalytically active site by forming Co3+/(4+) redox couple and the enlarged surface increases active sites for reactants and catalyst particles.

Chimia				69	12			789	798		10.2533/chimia.2015.789				2015	2015	Utilizing renewable sources of energy is very attractive to provide the growing population on earth in the future but demands the development of efficient storage to mitigate their intermittent nature. Chemical storage, with energy stored in the bonds of chemical compounds such as hydrogen or carbon-containing molecules, is promising as these energy vectors can be reserved and transported easily. In this review, we aim to present the advantages and drawbacks of the main water electrolysis technologies available today: alkaline and PEM electrolysis. The choice of electrode materials for utilization in very basic and very acid conditions is discussed, with specific focus on anodes for the oxygen evolution reaction, considered as the most demanding and energy consuming reaction in an electrolyzer. State-of-the-art performance of materials academically developed for two alternative technologies: electrolysis in neutral or seawater, and the direct electrochemical conversion from solar to hydrogen are also introduced.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0009-4293			MEDLINE:26842332	26842332

The addition of a small amount of calcium into BaFeO3-delta resulted in easy oxygen evolution at 200-300-degrees-C. A large amount of carbon dioxide, a small amount of C2 hydrocarbons and a large amount of carbon monoxide were formed at 300, 400 and 700-degrees-C, respectively. On Ba0.95Ca0.05CoyFe1-yO3-delta with y greater-than-or-equal-to 0.8, the production of carbon dioxide was retarded and almost 100% seleCtivitY to C2 hydrocarbons was obtained by the reaction with methane at 550-750-degrees-C. These oxides were found to be prominent catalysts for the oxidative coupling of methane.					13TH IBEROAMERICAN SYMP13TH IBEROAMERICAN SYMP	JUL 06-10, 1992JUL 06-10, 1992		SEGOVIA, SPAINSEGOVIA, SPAIN	28	0	1	0	1	0	31			0926-860X			WOS:A1993LP80000007

At the astrophysical energies, the presence of many resonances dominates the rate. The LUNA Collaboration measured for the first time three of them: E-p = 156.2, 189.5, and 259.7 keV. Recently, by using a high-efficiency setup, the uncertainties related to those three states have been lowered drastically and the direct component of the cross section was also measured. As a result, at a temperature of 0.1 GK, the error bar of the Ne-22(p, gamma)Na-23 reaction rate is now reduced by three orders of magnitude. The new high-efficiency setup provides also a possibility to investigate the branching cascades, despite the limited resolution of the BGO detector.					36th Mazurian Lakes Conference on Physics36th Mazurian Lakes Conference on Physics	SEP 01-07, 2019SEP 01-07, 2019		Piaski, POLANDPiaski, POLAND	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0587-4254	1509-5770		WOS:000521823800013

In particular, using in operando high-energy X-ray diffraction (HE-XRD) we tracked the evolution of the atomic structure and activity of noble metal-transition metal (NM-TM) nanocatalysts for ORR as they function at the cathode of a fully operational proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). Experimental HE-XRD data were analysed in terms of atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) and compared to the current output of the PEMFC, which was also recorded during the experiments. The comparison revealed that under actual operating conditions, NM-TM nanocatalysts can undergo structural changes that differ significantly in both length-scale and dynamics and so can suffer losses in their ORR activity that differ significantly in both character and magnitude. Therefore we argue that strategies for reducing ORR activity losses should implement steps for achieving control not only over the length but also over the time-scale of the structural changes of NM-TM NPs that indeed occur during PEMFC operation. Moreover, we demonstrate how such a control can be achieved and thereby the performance of PEMFCs improved considerably. Last but not least, we argue that the unique capabilities of in operando HE-XRD coupled to atomic PDF analysis to characterize active nanocatalysts inside operating fuel cells both in a time-resolved manner and with atomic level resolution, i.e. in 4D, can serve well the ongoing search for nanocatalysts that deliver more with less platinum.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000377140700031	27160891

In the past half a century, the dimensionally stable anode (DSA) made of RuO2 and TiO2 coated on the Ti substrate is the most widely used catalytic electrode for chlorine oxidation. However, the drawbacks of the DSA such as high cost, inferior selectivity and detrimental effects on the environment cannot meet the demand of modern industries. Recently, tremendous progress has been achieved in developing low-cost and efficient electrocatalysts for the chlorine evolution reaction (CER). Herein, a concise, but comprehensive and critical review is provided to summarize the recent advances in the field of electrocatalytic CER. First, the history of the chlor-alkali process and the catalytic mechanism of CER are summarized and presented. Then, three categories, namely, noble metal-based, earth-abundant transition-metal-based, and carbon-based metal-free electrocatalysts, are reviewed together with strategies for improving the CER catalytic performance. Lastly, future opportunities in this exciting field are outlined in terms of materials design, structure-performance relationship, technical improvements for the reactor and application scenarios extension.									13	1	0	0	2	0	14			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000661593100001

In particular, the strengths of the 20 keV and 65 keV resonances in the O-18(p, alpha)N-15 and O-17(p, alpha)N-14 reactions, respectively, have been extracted, as well as the contribution of the tail of the broad 656 keV resonance in the O-18(p, alpha)N-15 reaction inside the Gamow window. The strength of the 65 keV resonance in the O-17(p, alpha)N-14 reaction, measured by means of the THM, has been used to renormalize the corresponding resonance strength in the O-17 + p radiative capture channel. As a result, more accurate reaction rates for the O-18(p, alpha)N-15, O-17(p, alpha)N-14, and O-17(p, gamma)F-18 processes have been deduced, devoid of systematic errors due to extrapolation or the electron screening effect. Such rates have been introduced into state-of-the-art red giant branch and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) models for proton-capture nucleosynthesis coupled with extra-mixing episodes. The predicted abundances have been compared with isotopic compositions provided by geochemical analysis of presolar grains. As a result, an improved agreement is found between the models and the isotopic mix of oxide grains of AGB origins, whose composition is the signature of low-temperature proton-capture nucleosynthesis. The low N-14/N-15 found in SiC grains cannot be explained by the revised nuclear reaction rates and remains a serious problem that has not been satisfactorily addressed.									54	0	0	0	1	0	54			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000314812600016

In the current study, the kinetics of decarburization reaction is investigated. The jet impact and slag-metal emulsion zones were identified to be primary zones for carbon oxidation. The dynamic parameters in the rate equation of decarburization such as residence time of metal drops in the emulsion, interfacial area evolution, initial size, and the effects of surface-active oxides have been included in the kinetic rate equation of the metal droplet. A modified mass-transfer coefficient based on the ideal Langmuir adsorption equilibrium has been proposed to take into account the surface blockage effects of SiO2 and P2O5 in slag on the decarburization kinetics of a metal droplet in the emulsion. Further, a size distribution function has been included in the rate equation to evaluate the effect of droplet size on reaction kinetics. The mathematical simulation indicates that decarburization of the droplet in the emulsion is a strong function of the initial size and residence time. A modified droplet generation rate proposed previously by the authors has been used to estimate the total decarburization rate by slag-metal emulsion. The model's prediction shows that about 76 pct of total carbon is removed by reactions in the emulsion, and the remaining is removed by reactions at the jet impact zone. The predicted bath carbon by the model has been found to be in good agreement with the industrially measured data.									17	2	0	0	0	0	19			1073-5615	1543-1916		WOS:000431318100020

In this study, we have designed a graphene nano-sheet anchored NiS2/MoS2 heterostructure through a facile two-step method and have employed them towards HER. To evaluate the performance of the NiS2/MoS2 @GNS, The crystalline phase, morphology and material purity are evaluated by XRD, SEM, high resolution transmission microscopy HR-TEM and EDS. In addition, the electrochemical performance of the as-synthesized NiS2/MoS2 @GNS composites and other electrocatalysts are tested towards the HER in 1 M KOH electrolyte. It is noted that the graphene nano-sheet (GNS) anchored NiS2/MoS2 composite shows an excellent electrocatalytic activity with a less overpotential of 130 mV at current density (vertical bar j vertical bar) of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 40 mV dec(-1) compared with pristine NiS2/MoS2 material (141 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 48 mV dec(-1)). Furthermore, it possessed good stability for 1000 cycles and performed time-dependant current density for 10 h at a limited overpotential of 130 mV. The high synergistic effect between NiS2/MoS2 and GNS in promotion of hydrogen (H-2) generation efficiency is ascribed to more active sites, low charge transfer resistance and great electrochemical kinetics which justified the use of NiS2/MoS2@GNS hybrid material as a best alternative to replace noble metal for efficient HER.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000767362000004

These phases are of great interest to the electrocatalysis community, especially when formed by a sustainable chemistry method. This is successfully achieved by first forming a complex five element amorphous FeNiCoCrMn high-entropy oxide (HEO) phase via electrodeposition from a nanodroplet emulsion solution of the metal salt reactants. The amorphous oxide phase is then thermally treated and reduced at 570-600 degrees C to form the crystalline FeNiCo alloy with a separate CrMnOx cophase. The FeNiCo alloy is fully characterized by scanning transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy elemental analysis and is identified as a face-centered cubic crystal with the lattice constant a = 3.52 angstrom. The unoptimized, ligand-free FeNiCo NPs activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction is evaluated in alkaline solution and found to have an similar to 185 mV more cathodic onset potential than the Pt metal. Beyond being able to synthesize highly crystalline, ligand-free FeNiCo nanoparticles, the demonstrated and relatively simple two-step process is ideal for the synthesis of tailor-made nanoparticles where the desired composition is not easily achieved with classical solution-based chemistries.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0743-7463			WOS:000763586100029	35084862

Access to reliable and affordable hydrogen economy, however, requires cost-effective and highly efficient electrocatalytic materials that replace noble metals (e.g., Pt, Ir, Ru) to negotiate electrode processes such as oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Although substantial advances in the development of inexpensive catalysts, successful deployment of these materials in fuel cells and electrolyzers will depend on their improved activity and robustness. Recent research has demonstrated that the nanostructuring of Earth-abundant minerals provides access to newly advanced energy materials, particularly for nanostructured pyrites, which are attracting great interest. Crystalline pyrites commonly contain the characteristic dianion units and have cations occurring in octahedral coordination whose generalized formula is MX2, where M can be transition metal of groups 8-12 and X is a chalcogen. The diversity of pyrites that are accessible and their versatile and tunable properties make them attractive for a wide range of applications from photovoltaics to energy storage and electrocatalysis. Pyrite-type structures can be further extended to their ternary analogues, for example, CoAsS (cobaltite), NiAsS (gersdorffite), NiSbS (ullmannite), CoPS, and many others. Moreover, improved properties of pyrites can be realized through grafting them with promoter objects (e.g., metal oxides, metal chalcogenides, noble metals, and carbons), which bring favorable interfaces and structural and electronic modulations, thus leading to performance gains. In recent years, research on the synthesis of pyrite nanomaterials and on related structure understanding has dramatically advanced their applications, which offers new perspectives in the search for efficient and robust electrocatalysts, yet a focused review that concentrates the critical developments is still missing.In this Account, we describe our recent progress on the discoveries and applications of nanostructured pyrite-type materials in the area of electrocatalysis. We first briefly highlight some interesting properties of pyrite-type materials and why they are attractive for modern electrocatalysis. Some recent advances on their synthesis that allows access to highly nanostructured pyrite type materials are reviewed, along with the grafting of resultant pyrites with foreign materials (e.g., metal oxides, metal chalcogenides, noble metals, and carbons) to enable improved catalytic performances. We finally spotlight the exciting examples where pyrite nanostructures were used as efficient electrocatalysts to drive the OER, HER, and methanol-tolerant ORR. It is reasonable to assume that, with significant efforts and focus, the next few years will bring new advances on the pyrites and other minerals for electrocatalysis.									100	5	0	0	11	0	102			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000411548800015	28825788

In this chapter we will discuss about some multifunctional magnetic nanostructure, especially focusing on the Au-Fe3O4 nanostructures and their potential application biomedical fields.

The effects of heat treatment process and corrosion time on the polarization curves were analyzed. The results show that the change of microstructure by annealing treatment accelerates the corrosion of X80 steel, which is worse than that of original state, the corrosion rate increases first and then reduces. The cathodic reactions are dominated by oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reaction. The corrosion products consist of FeOOH (surface layer) and Fe_3O_4 (inner layer). The integrality and compactness of corrosion product films influence the corrosion process, and increase the corrosion damage of X80 steel surface. The content of Cl~- dominates the corrosion severity.			采用电化学测试、扫描电镜观察、表而能谱分析及X射线衍射等方法,研究了原始态与退火处理态的X80管线钢在东南酸性土壤模拟溶液中的电化学腐蚀特征与机理,分析了热处理工艺和腐蚀时间等因素对X80钢极化曲线的影响.结果表明,退火态X80钢耐蚀性低于原始态,这主要与X80钢组织因热处理发生改变有关;随着浸泡时间的延长,原始态与退火态的X80钢在东南酸性土壤模拟溶液中腐蚀趋势均减小,而腐蚀速率先增大后减小;其阴极过程受析氢腐蚀和吸氧腐蚀联合控制;腐蚀产生的锈层主要由FeOOH(表层)和Fe_3O_4(内层)组成,而腐蚀产物膜的完整性和致密性影响了X80钢表面的腐蚀过程,使管线钢表面的腐蚀破坏程度增加.研究还发现,氯离子含量是影响腐蚀的主导因素.						2	9	0	0	0	0	11			1001-3814			CSCD:3800203

It has been established that the rate of oxygen absorption is lower when the deuterium is introduced into the carboxyl group of CH3COOH, and the rate of carbon dioxide evolution is increased when deuterium is introduced into the methyl group of the acid. The results prove that the decarboxylation of acetic acid under the reaction conditions in the present work cannot be explained through a mechanism including the formation of a carboxylate radical under the influence of peroxide radicals. Consideration is given to participation of acetic acid in formation of an active catalytic complex, and also to the mechanism of its decarboxylation under the influence of the catalyst.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0023-1584			WOS:A1991HG56300009

The process is studied by cyclic voltammetry, steady-state measurements and potential step measurements. The overall oxidation reaction is a two-electron process where the first step involves a reversible charge transfer: NO2- double left right arrow NO2 + e(-) The one-electron oxidation of nitrite yields adsorbed NO2 which is further oxidized to adsorbed (NO2)(+) and subsequently desorbed via a chemical reaction. In the general case, fit of experimental data is obtained with adsorption described by a Temkin isotherm unless the electrode is pre-treated at a cathodic potential where the (NO2)(ads) is removed.

The platinum electrode was found to be active for electro-oxidation as well as for electroreduction. Above 0.3 V vs. Hg/Hg2SO4, azide is oxidized to give N-2, NO, NO2, and N2O. Reduction of azide takes place below -0.9 V forming N-2, N2H4, and possibly NH3. In contrast to platinum, gold showed only activity for the electro-oxidation of azide leading to the formation of N-2, NO, NO2, and N2O above 0.5 V. Evidence for a reaction without evolution of volatile products was also found taking place above 0.1 V. A reaction mechanism is discussed emphasizing the role of adsorbed hydrogen and oxygen.									12	1	0	0	2	0	13			0013-4651			WOS:A1995TD93300027		
J	Mobius, A.; Werner, C.								Methods for Selective Purification of Electrolytes								Galvanotechnik				105	1			54	5						Jan. 2014	2014	Electrolytes (electroplating baths) become contaminated during operation. The causes of this include contamination from air, from the components being plated, from rack contacts/stop-off lacquers as well as finely divided solid particles transferred from upstream processes, or oils, greases, breakdown products of bath additives or electrolyte components. At both anodes and cathodes, organics present in solution can be oxidised or reduced respectively. Additionally, chlorine or oxygen evolution can take place at insoluble anodes as a side reaction at passive sites. Use of inert anodes may result in additional undesired side reactions.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0016-4232			INSPEC:14781959

During the anneal, the 827 cm(-1) VO defect band decreases, and another band at 885 cm(-1) of VO2 centres increases. The kinetics of the evolution of these two defects was investigated. The decay of VO is dominated by a second order reaction (VO + Si-i --> O-i) with an activation energy 1.70 eV. The growth of VO2 exhibits two stages. Below 360 degrees C, a first order reaction (VO + O-i --> VO2) with an activation energy of 1.46 eV is more likely to occur. Above 360 degrees C, the growth of VO2 seems to be correlated with mechanisms which do not involve VO centres. This behaviour may become explicable, at least qualitatively, in terms of a mechanism that involves the formation of oxygen dimers.

These transformations are reflected in their evolving catalytic activity, and a fundamental understanding of the changing nature of active sites is vital for the rational design of solid materials for applications. Beyond thermal catalysis, both photocatalysis and electrocatalysis are topical because they can harness renewable energy to drive uphill reactions that afford commodity chemicals and fuels. Although structural transformations of photocatalysts and electrocatalysts have been observed in operando, the resulting implications for catalytic behaviour are not fully understood. In this Review, we summarize and compare the structural evolution of solid thermal catalysts, electrocatalysts and photocatalysts. We suggest that well-established knowledge of thermal catalysis offers a good basis to understand emerging photocatalysis and electrocatalysis research.									36	1	0	0	2	0	36				2397-3358		WOS:000619398400001

The use of the I-/I-3(-) redox couple to mediate the LiOH-based oxygen reduction and oxidation reactions has proven challenging due to the multiple reaction paths induced by the oxidation of I- on cell charging. In this work, we introduce an ionic liquid to a glyme-based electrolyte containing Lil and water and demonstrate a reversible LiOH-based Li-O-2 battery cycling that operates via a 4 e(-)/O-2 process with a low charging overpotential (below 3.5 V versus Li/Li+). The addition of the ionic liquid increases the oxidizing power of I-3(-), shifting the charging mechanism from IO-/IO3- formation to O-2 evolution.									18	0	0	0	1	0	17			2542-4351			WOS:000592226000022

Adjusting porous media properties to enhance the gas-phase OER for PEM water electrolysis in 3D simulations								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				424						140625	10.1016/j.electacta.2022.140625				AUG 20 2022	2022	A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics study was employed to investigate the extent of the gas-phase contribution to the oxygen evolution reaction. The model was parametrized via comparison with experimental data. It was concluded from comparing non-isothermal and isothermal models that evaporation likely plays a key role in cell performance, along with heat generation. Porous transport layer (PTL) properties were adjusted in the model to compute the impact of such properties on cell performance. Current density increased as a result of reducing PTL permeability, increasing the liquid/gas interfacial area, and increasing porosity. Effects of the flow field plate were investigated as well. It was found that high in-plane permeability in the PTL may lead to redirection of flow in the channels, causing non-uniformity in anode conditions. Utilizing the insight from these investigations, the anode PTL properties were adjusted in an attempt to improve cell performance by regulating liquid water transport while maintaining uniformity. The simulation suggests that current can be increased by about 5-10% under constant operating conditions via changes in PTL properties.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000809856000001

In this work, cobalt-doped nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (Fe-Ni3Co2 LDH) assembled from one-dimensional (1D) nanoneedle subunits and FeSe2/C is synthesized via a facile, one-pot self-template method. FeNi3Co2 LDH exhibits remarkable activity for catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction with a low onset overpotential of 224 mV and a low Tafel slope of 73 mV dec(-1), much better than those of FeNi LDH. Significantly, the Fe-Ni3Co2 LDH//FeSe2/C asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) delivers an ultra-high energy density (22.3 mu W h cm(-2)), high power density (2.07 mW cm(-2)), and outstanding cycling stability (84.8% capacitance retention after 5000 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles at 0.3 mA). The density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that the high electrochemical activity of Fe-NiCo LDHs is mainly attributed to cobalt doping which can modify the electronic structure and narrow the bandgap, thereby bringing enhanced conductivity, facile electron transfer, and abundant active sites. Our work could provide new insight into the synthesis of novel multifunctional nanomaterials.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2633-5409		WOS:000743637400001

Its furnace and equipment design is implemented so that the reaction enthalpy released in the suspension oxidation is fully used for melting the reactive and non-reactive particles of the feed mixture. Since the first industrial application in 1940s, flash smelting has been developed for other applications than copper matte smelting, including the oxygen enriched smelting, continuous converting to blister copper with low sulphur concentration, and direct-to-blister smelting. Along with actual evolution in the processing equipment, the basic metallurgy has been under careful evaluation and development. In spite of many favourable features of iron silicate slags, they become problematic in the direct-to-blister copper smelting environments, at oxygen partial pressures higher than in matte smelting. These conditions typically locate beyond thermodynamic stability range of the homogeneous, fully molten iron silicate slags, which are more or less fully degraded `internally', precipitating their solid constituents, silica and/or magnetite.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0371-9553			INSPEC:12840326

Here a facile synthesis of trimetallic carbon nanoflower electrocatalysts is reported which are derived from Co2+/Fe2+/Ni2+ ratio adjustable metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The unique nanosheet-assembled multiscale nanoflower morphology can enlarge the catalyst/electrolyte contact area, and the synergistic electronic effects between trimetallic components endow the trimetallic carbon nanoflower electrocatalysts with more oxygen vacancies and a higher degree of graphitization of carbon, thus showing excellent activity. The optimized Co0.2Fe0.8Ni-OCNF reaches a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpotential of 291 mV with a very small Tafel slope of 36.1 mV dec(-1) and 1.65 V@10 mA cm(-2) for a two-electrode water electrolysis in an alkaline solution, outperforming the commercial IrO2 electrocatalysts. The results may pave the way to the development of more efficient multicomponent nanosheet-assembled multiscale nanomaterials for various catalytic applications.									67	3	0	0	3	0	69			2196-7350			WOS:000477979500021

The synthesized composites, with different loading of TiO2 on MoS2 were examined by XRD, XPS, SEM and TEM for structural, chemical and morphological details. The electrocatalytic measurement shows the significant current density for hydrogen evolution reaction from these hybrid series recording the best one as 40mA/cm(2) at overpotential of 0.64 V vs. RHE.

They are also key reactions to understand exotic systems such as R-Coronae Borealis stars and novae. Thus, the measurement of their cross sections in the low energy region can be crucial to reduce the nuclear uncertainty on theoretical predictions, because the resonance parameters are poorly determined. The Trojan Horse Method, in its newly developed form particularly suited to investigate low-energy resonances, has been applied to the H-2(O-18, alpha N-l5)n and H-2(O-17, alpha N-14)n reactions to deduce the O-18(p, alpha)N-15 and O-17(p, alpha)N-14 cross sections at low energies.

A possible promoting effect of chloride ions toward oxirane formation was explored. Online differential electrochemical mass spectrometry combined with electrochemical polarization techniques were used to monitor the potential dependence of organic products resulting from ethene oxidation as well as the reaction solution decomposition products. Quantum chemical modeling by means of density functional theory was employed to study key reaction steps. The ethene oxidation in acid media led to CO2, whereas oxirane was formed in the presence of 0.3 M Cl-. In the Cl- promoted oxidation on RuO2, oxirane and a small amount of CO2 were the only detected electro-oxidation products at potentials below the onset of Cl-2 and O-2 evolution, resulting from Cl and water oxidation. It is demonstrated here that the epoxidation is a surface-related electrocatalytic process that depends on the surface properties. Cl acts as the epoxidation promoter that switches off the combustion pathway toward CO2 and enables the epoxidation reaction channel by surface reactive sites blocking. The proposed epoxidation mechanism implies binuclear (recombination) mechanism for O-2 evolution reaction on considered surfaces.									37	0	0	0	4	0	37			0002-7863			WOS:000290358200059	21438526

On the basis of the experimental results, the pyrolysis/combustion kinetic parameters were calculated. In the fast pyrolysis process, the apparent activation energy of Loy Yang brown coal, Wara brown coal and Usibelli brown coal was 36.9, 33.1 and 28.1 kJ/mol respectively, which was far lower than that obtained under the slow pyrolysis process. The main light hydrocarbon gases evolved from brow coal fast pyrolysis were CH4, C2H6 and C3H8. At the same time, it was found that the reaction rate of brown coal fast pyrolysis was strongly influenced by the oxygen content of the raw coal. The high oxygen content of the raw coal was beneficial to pyrolytic reaction. The combustion process of the brown coal could be divided two stages: in the first stage, the evolution and combustion of volatile matter occurred simultaneously. In the secondary stage, only char combustion occurred. The apparent activation energy of char combustion was 2.3-20.8 kJ/mol.									21	2	0	0	2	0	22			0378-3820	1873-7188		WOS:000435062600003

The combination of improved conductivity, mesopores architecture retained with the ZIF-67 template, which result the reduced internal resistance, enhanced charge transportation as well as large electrochemical double-layer capacitance. This work provides an effective and synergistic strategy for fabricating NiCo2S4-based catalysts toward electrochemical water splitting.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0360-3199	1879-3487		WOS:000768763300013

Herein, we report a micro-flowers (MFs) cobalt (Co) based material with a three-dimensional (3D) open structure consisting of two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets. The MFs were synthesized by using HMTA to adjust the microscopic environment of the Co ions, which consist of Co3O4 and Co(OH)(2). Electrochemical evaluation reveals that the MFs electrocatalysts exhibit a low overpotential of = 295 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a long-term stability in a 1.0 M KOH solution. The excellent OER performance is attributed to the hierarchical structure, which combines the fast charge transfer ability of low-dimensional structures and the fast mass transfer ability of high-dimensional structures.									11	3	0	0	1	0	11			1466-8033			WOS:000444554400020

Here, we found that the performance and efficiency of the electrocatalyst for OER can be improved by designing the defect structure of the nanocatalyst and heteroatom doping. In this study, we have successfully prepared defect-rich metal Fe-doped CoP nanosheets (noted as Fe-CoP NSs) as an efficient electrocatalyst for OER through an etching-cooperative strategy. The doping rate of the Fe element is about 0.18%. Surprisingly, Fe-CoP NSs possess a smaller overpotential (312 mV) and Tafel slope (56.1 mV dec(-1)) than commercial RuO2 (344 mV and 62.4 mV dec(-1)) to drive the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. In addition, Fe-CoP NSs have great stability and robustness, which was demonstrated by 20 h of chronoamperometry test and 2000 cyclic voltammetry cycles. The reasons for the excellent catalytic performance and robustness of Fe-CoP NSs may be ascribed to the facts that defect-rich NSs can expose more active sites and the heteroatom doping adjusts the electronic structure of the catalyst, thereby promoting the OER performance.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000670646600045

The experiments were designed in such a way that the evolution of the state of the catalyst surface and of the catalytic performance along the bed could be followed and related to each other. The results obtained indicate that a marked pattern of catalyst reduction exists in the reactor used under butane-rich conditions, leading to the appearance of V3+ phases.

The surface atomic structure of the electrode materials, if appropriately designed, will provide an energetically affordable pathway with individual reaction intermediates that not only reduce the thermodynamic energy barrier but also allow an acceptably fast kinetic rate of the overall redox reaction. As one of the most abundant and stable forms, oxides of transitional metals demonstrated promising electrocatalytic activities towards multiple important chemical reactions. In this topical review, we attempt to discuss the possible avenues to construct the electrocatalytic active surface for this important class of materials for two essential chemical reactions for water splitting. A general introduction of the electrochemical water splitting process on the electrocatalyst surface with applied potential will be provided, followed by a discussion on the fundamental charge transfers and the mechanism. As the generally perceived active sites are chemical reaction dependent, we offer a general overview of the possible approaches to construct or create electrocatalytically active sites in the context of surface atomic structure engineering. The review concludes with perspectives that summarize challenges and opportunities in electrocatalysis and how these can be addressed to unlock the electrocatalytic potentials of the metal oxide materials.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000726971400001	34870672

With the deepening of practical application requirements,researchers are committed to developing new catalytic materials with larger specific surface area,more highly exposed reaction sites and shorter reactant/product diffusion pathways. Low-dimensional nanomaterials induce rich physical and chemical properties due to the reduction in dimensions. The two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials benefit from theirs ultra-thin layered structure,large specific surface area,high density of surface active sites,excellent photoelectric and mechanical properties,and easy interface transmission and shorter diffusion,which is suitable for being used as a catalyst. In recent years,researchers have been working on the development of new 2D materials,actively researching the unique advantages of 2D materials in the field of catalysis,and optimizing their synthesis methods in order to achieve large-scale applications as early as possible. At present,various 2D materials such as graphene,black phosphorus (BP), transition metal sulfides (TMDs), transition metal oxides (TMOs), and layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been discovered. Top-down peeling method (micromechanical cleavage,oxidation/reduction- based intercalation-assisted exfoliation,mechanical force-assisted exfoliation,ion exchange-assisted exfoliation,and etching-assisted exfoliation) and bottom-up controllable synthesis strategies (chemical vapor deposition and wet chemical methods) were applied to prepare higher quality ultra-thin 2D nanomaterials according to whether the bulk materials have a layered structure. However,the research on 2D materials is still not mature enough. The yield and quality are far away from industrialization and commercialization. At the same time,micro-fine control of 2D material properties is needed to further optimize its catalytic performance. Due to their highly exposed surface atoms,excellent electronic properties and mechanical properties,in energy catalytic reactions such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO_2RR), etc.,and environmental catalytic reactions such as selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and catalytic conversion of volatile organic compounds (VOC) exhibit excellent catalytic performance. And the micro-fine control of 2D material properties can be carried out through surface modification/functionalization and phase engineering strategies to further optimize its catalytic performance. Based on the classification,characteristics and application fields of 2D materials,this paper focuses on the structural characteristics and synthesis methods of 2D materials,summarizes their research hotspots and progress in the field of catalysis,and proposes prospects for the research and application of 2D materials in the field of catalysis.			催化技术作为能源转化和环境污染治理领域的重要手段之一,对人类生存环境的改善发挥了巨大作用。随着实际应用需求的不断深化,研究人员致力于研发具有更大比表面积、更多高暴露反应位点和更短反应物/产物扩散途径等特性的新型催化材料。低维纳米材料由于维度低,具有更丰富、特殊的物理和化学性质。其中二维(2D)纳米材料得益于其超薄的层状结构,具有较大的比表面积、高密度的表面活性位点、优异的光电和力学性能,以及易于界面传输和更短的扩散路径,非常适合被用作催化剂。近年来,研究者们致力于开发新型2D材料,积极研究2D材料在催化领域的独特优势,并优化其合成方法,以期尽早实现规模化应用。目前,多种2D材料如石墨烯、黑磷(BP) 、过渡金属硫化物(TMDs) 、层状双金属氢氧化物(LDHs)等相继被发现。根据2D材料母体是否具有分层结构,选择自上而下的剥离法(微机械剥离法、氧化/还原剂插层辅助剥离法、机械力辅助剥离法、离子交换辅助剥离法及刻蚀辅助剥离法)或自下而上的可控合成策略(化学气相沉积法和湿化学法)应用于制备较高质量的超薄2D纳米材料。它们由于具有高度暴露的表面原子、优异的电子特性和力学性能,在能源催化反应如析氢反应(HER) 、析氧反应(OER) 、氧还原反应(ORR) 、二氧化碳还原反应(CO_2RR)等,以及环境催化反应如选择性催化还原反应(SCR)和对挥发性有机物(VOCs)的催化转化中展示出优异的催化性能。可通过表面修饰/功能化、相位工程等策略对2D材料性能进行微观精细调控,进一步优化其催化性能。本文基于2D材料的分类、特性和应用领域,重点概述2D材料的结构特性和合成方法,详细总结其在催化领域的研究热点与进展并提出展望,以期为2D材料在催化领域的研究及应用提供借鉴。						2	1	0	0	1	0	2			1005-023X			CSCD:6757721

ACS Materials Au				2	4			489	504		10.1021/acsmaterialsau.1c00079				2022-Jul-13	2022	Metal borides have long-standing uses due to their desirable chemical and physical properties such as high melting points, hardness, electrical conductivity, and chemical stability. Typical metal boride preparations utilize high-energy and/or slow thermal heating processes. This report details a facile, solvent-free single-step synthesis of several crystalline metal monoborides containing earth-abundant transition metals. Rapid and exothermic self-propagating solid-state metathesis (SSM) reactions between metal halides and MgB2 form crystalline FeB, CoB, and NiB in seconds without sustained external heating and with high isolated product yields (80%). The metal borides are formed using a well-studied MgB2 precursor and compared to reactions using separate Mg and B reactants, which also produce self-propagating reactions and form crystalline metal borides. These SSM reactions are sufficiently exothermic to theoretically raise reaction temperatures to the boiling point of the MgCl2 byproduct (1412 °C). The chemically robust monoborides were examined for their ability to perform electrocatalytic water oxidation and reduction. Crystalline CoB and NiB embedded on carbon wax electrodes exhibit moderate and stable bifunctional electrocatalytic water splitting activity, while FeB only shows appreciable hydrogen evolution activity. Analysis of catalyst particles after extended electrocatalytic experiments shows that the bulk crystalline metal borides remain intact during electrochemical water-splitting reactions though surface oxygen species may impact electrocatalytic activity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2694-2461		MEDLINE:35875344	35875344

Organic molecules on early Earth might have been modified or decomposed by such pathways, thus affecting the total organic inventory for prebiotic synthesis reactions. Specifically, we evaluated several common oxide minerals under a range of environmental conditions and combinations of conditions (pH, O-2 level, UV-wavelength, and particle loading), for formation of highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the oxide surfaces by quantifying the generated [OH center dot] and [H2O2]. We identified anatase/rutile (beta-TiO2/alpha-TiO2) and hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) as active in ROS production and, importantly, found different dominant pathways for ROS formation on anatase/rutile versus hematite. Hydroxyl radicals (OH center dot) in anatase and rutile suspensions were generated mainly through the oxidation of OH- by photo-generated holes and H2O2 was generated through the combination of an OH center dot radical with an OH- and a hole. This pathway for the TiO2 phases did not require the presence of O-2, and was not shut down under anaerobic conditions. In contrast, formation of H2O2 and OH center dot in hematite suspensions involved reduction of O-2 by electrons, which was inhibited under anaerobic conditions. The surface ROS as well as free radicals formed by reactions with other gases on early Earth atmosphere were capable of destroying molecules such as lipids and pre-RNA or RNA essential to assembly of protocells and survival of the earliest cells. At the same time, surface associated ROS and other free radicals may also have promoted aminoamide formation. Thus, the surface ROS would have affected prebiotic organic compound inventory and protocell/early life evolution. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) are the current end of this downscaling road, offering the potential of 100% metal atom utilization and excellent catalytic behavior compared with traditional nanoparticle catalysts. However, most development of SACs still relies on trial-and-error experiments because of the insufficient understanding of the distinctive properties of SACs and their structure-activity relationships. This Perspective discusses the path forward toward the rational design of SACs through a summary of understanding regarding the distinctive properties of single-atom active sites, their dynamic changes during the reactions, and the corresponding reaction mechanisms. Major challenges and opportunities for future research on SACs are identified in precisely controlled synthesis, advanced operando characterizations, and discovering the unconventional catalytic mechanisms.									21	0	0	0	0	0	20			1948-7185			WOS:000635441500019	33720722

The generation of new singlemetal-site catalysts, with isolated metal atoms dispersed on the surface of substrates, offers maximum atom-utilization efficiency, high specific activity, and novel properties. The unique structure of single-site catalysts also enables their potential to bridge the gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. This field is at an early stage, characterized by important discoveries and novel demonstrations of catalytic properties associated with the fine structure of single metal sites; however, specific applications, especially catalytic hydrogenation reactions, are still lacking. The focus of this short review is on applications of single-site catalysts in the hydrogen economy based on our studies of hydrogen generation/storage via single-metal-site catalysts.

However, the usually harsh reaction conditions using toxic metal catalysts or corrosive reagents lead to undesired side products and wastes. Environmentally friendly and mild reaction conditions using metal-free catalysts remain a huge challenge. Herein, we report the use of a thiophene-based covalent triazine framework (CTF) as pure organic and visible-light-active photocatalyst for the selective oxidation of alcohols at room temperature. Molecular oxygen was activated as a clean and selective oxidant. The high selectivity and efficiency of the pure organic photocatalyst could be demonstrated and were comparable to those of the state-of-art metal or nonmetal catalytic systems reported.									196	11	0	0	18	0	197			2155-5435			WOS:000407309100059

In this work, a hybrid electrocatalyst composed of cobalt (Co/CoOx) nanoparticles encapsulated in Co/N-doped mesoporous graphene (Co/CoOx@Co/N-graphene) is reported for efficient ORR catalysis. The catalyst is rationally designed and synthesized via a facile combination of spontaneous one-pot polymerization of dopamine in the presence of graphene oxide (GO) and Co2+ ions and the subsequent carbonization process. The morphology, doping nature and ORR activity of the as-prepared catalyst are systematically investigated. It is found that there are abundant Co/N active sites and Co/CoOx nanoparticles in this hybrid catalyst, leading to a synergistic enhancement effect for improved ORR activity. In an alkaline environment, this Co/CoOx@Co/N-graphene catalyst displays Pt/C-comparable ORR activity in terms of half-wave potential and four-electron reduction selectivity, and higher limiting current density, better methanol tolerant ability and long-term durability. When being evaluated in a Zn-air battery, it demonstrates superior performance to the commercial Pt/C catalyst.									60	4	0	0	2	0	61			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000406374000011	28696462

In particular, since alpha,alpha fusion reactions can produce Li-6 and Li-7 whereas Be and B require CNO nuclei as spallation targets, the Pop II ratios of Li to Be and/or B are vastly different from their Pop I counterparts. Current data on Pop II Be do not exclude the possibility that significant amounts of lithium have been produced via this mechanism. The observed increase in the Pop II abundance of beryllium with increasing metallicity points to synthesis during the early Galaxy. The boron to beryllium ratio is relatively insensitive to model-dependent, evolutionary uncertainties and could provide a signature for cosmic ray nucleosynthesis during the early Galaxy.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0370-1573			WOS:A1993LH20600019

Merging heterogeneous organocatalysis and photocatalysis, C-H functionalization has been achieved by selective C-2 oxidation of N-aryl glycines to afford the electrophilic imine followed by Friedel-Crafts alkylation with indole. The sustainability of the process has been taken into account in the reaction design through the implementation of a metal-free recyclable heterogeneous photocatalyst and a green reaction medium. Scale-up of the benchmark reaction (gram scale, yield of 69%) and recycling experiments (over seven runs without a loss of efficiency) have been performed to prove the robustness of the protocol. Finally, mechanistic studies were conducted employing electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to unveil the roles of the photocatalyst and oxygen in the formation of odd-electron species.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0022-3263	1520-6904		WOS:000813533500001	35621232

Herein, an electrocatalyst with ultra-small PtRu singe atom alloy species evenly dispersed on nitrogen doped ultra-thin carbon nanosheets (PtRu SAA/NC) was designed, and its structure was confirmed by synchrotron-radiation-based X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy. Compared with pure Ru clusters and nitrogen doped carbon sheets, the PtRu SAA/ NC possesses higher hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic activity and exceptional stability, which exhibits a small Tafel slope of 43 mV/dec and a low overpotential of 54 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) during HER in 0.5 mol/L H2SO4 solution.

Theoretical calculations revealed that the high NRR selectivity of Sb(2)S(3)originated from the Janus role of active Sb centers: on one hand, Sb exhibited a strong Sb5p-N2p hybridization upon initial N(2)protonation, capable of effectively activating the NRR with a low reaction barrier. On the other hand, Sb could concurrently impede the hydrogen evolution by hindering the H(+)adsorption.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000565803300017	32760985	
J	Shi, Zhaoping; Li, Xin; Li, Tongfei; Chen, Yifan; Tang, Yawen								Evolution of composition and structure of PtRh/C in the acidic methanol electrooxidation process								ELECTROCHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS				113						106690	10.1016/j.elecom.2020.106690				APR 2020	2020	PtRh alloys are highly active in the anodic methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) but few studies have looked at their evolution in the composition and structure during the catalytic process. Herein, a uniformly dispersed carbon-supported PtRh (PtRh/C) catalyst with Rh-enriched surface was synthesized via a facial hydrothermal method. By recording the performance of different cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles during electrocatalytic MOR process in acid, the evolution of PtRh/C in composition and structure was elucidated. During the first 80 CV cycles, the rapid dissolution of the surface Rh atoms and the exposure of active Pt sites lead to the dramatic enhancement of the current density. When further continue the CV cycling, Pt atoms on the surface have aggregated and recombined to form a tightly aligned Pt-enriched surface. But Rh tends to be stable and catalytic performance reaches a relatively stable status with slightly decreased activity. Compared with the performance of PtRu/C catalyst, it can be concluded that PtRh/C has better stability and higher activity based on the less soluble property of Rh than Ru.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000525333700003

In the presence of water and oxygen, such compounds generate expansive reactions that may have severe structural damages. This is especially critical in concrete dams, given the large volume of material used and the restrictions in movement imposed by the surroundings. In these cases, the definition of adequate rehabilitation programs depends on the prediction of the expansive reaction evolution and the future behavior of the structure. Although models that describe solid particle-gas reactions may be used with this purpose, none were specifically developed to simulate this phenomenon in dams. This paper introduces a new kinetic model based on the unreacted-core model for pyrrhotite oxidation. The comparison of the results obtained with this new model and with the direct application of the unreacted-core model show significant differences. Following an extensive parametric study, a simplified constitutive equation is proposed to estimate the pyrrhotite oxidation kinetics in concrete dams. The estimations performed with this constitutive equation agree with the experimental data obtained in the tests of different particle sizes. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0000531.

It is desirable to explore more efficient electro-catalysts with earth-abundant elements. Herein, we employed a high-temperature polymerization method to develop a structure consisting of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanopatch enveloped carbon nanotubes (CNTs), where isolated Ni and Fe atoms were embedded into the tri-s-triazine units of g-C3N4 by forming a metal-N-x structure. The designed dual-metal catalyst exhibited remarkable OER performance with an extremely low overpotential (similar to 326 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and a small Tafel slope (67 mV per decade), which is superior to those of state-of-the-art electrocatalysts with metal-Nx coordination and the benchmark IrO2/C catalyst. In combination with atomic microscopy observations, our synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy results revealed that, as compared to single-metal (Fe or Ni) doped hybrids, the electronic structures of both Ni and Fe atoms were reconfigured in the obtained dual-metal samples. Notably, increase of the oxidative state in Ni sites after multi-metal doping directly contributed to more active sites and favored the OER process, assisted by the porous structure and good electrical contacts between CNTs and g-C3N4. This investigation clearly demonstrated a unique synergistic effect in atomically dual-metal doped catalysts, thus it may provide a versatile route to regulate the electronic structures of single atomic catalysts through engineering of neighboring elements and coordination number.									77	3	0	0	3	0	78			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000431003600012		
J	Gong, Jinfeng; Meng, Fanming; Fan, Zhenghua; Li, Huijie								Controlled Synthesis of CeO2 Microstructures from 1D Rod-Like to 3D Lotus-Like and Their Morphology-Dependent Properties								ELECTRONIC MATERIALS LETTERS				12	6			846	855		10.1007/s13391-016-6126-x				NOV 2016	2016	Monodisperse 3D lotus-like CeO2 microstructures have been successfully synthesized via controlling the morphology of CeCO3OH precursors under hydrothermal condition as well as subsequent calcination. The reaction time was systematically investigated. XRD, FT-IR, SEM, TEM, XPS, Raman scattering and Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were employed to characterize the samples. The lotus-like CeO2 hierarchical structures with an average of 4-6 mu m are composed of many nanoplates of 100-200 nm in thickness as the petals stacking together to form open flowers and have a fluorite cubic structure. Based on the time-dependent morphology evolution evidences, a nucleation-dissolution-recrystallization mechanism has been proposed to explain the transformation from rod-like structures to lotus-like CeO2 hierarchical structures with the increase of reaction time. It is found that there are Ce3+ ions and oxygen vacancies in surface of samples. The magnetic and photoluminescence measurements indicated that all CeO2 samples exhibit excellent ferromagnetism and optical properties at room temperature, and while increasing the reaction time, the ferromagnetism and optical properties increase more, which can be reasonably explained for the influences of the different morphology of the particles and the concentration of oxygen vacancies and Ce3+ ions.									15	1	0	0	0	0	16			1738-8090	2093-6788		WOS:000387440400019

Here, the effects of metal morphologies are investigated by focusing on Au NWs and NPs using density functional theory calculations. It is revealed that activity of two key under coordinated active sites, namely, edge and corner sites, varies delicately with different local coordination environments of various NWs and NPs, and the observed activity trend is remarkably well-rationalized with a generalized coordination number. Furthermore, it is identified that the type of planes and the dihedral angle of the constituent planes are two key factors determining the catalytic activity. A general activity trend for CO2 reduction and H-2 evolution with the consideration of the density of each type of sites explains why Au NWs exhibit better catalytic performance than Au NPs, as in experiments. On the basis of the theoretical understandings, atomic-level insights and design principles are provided toward efficiently catalyzing CO2 reduction using nanostructured metal catalysts.									27	2	0	0	5	0	27			1932-7447			WOS:000426802500019

Herein, mononuclear and binuclear cobalt phthalocyanine (mono-CoPc and bi-CoPc) with a well-defined molecular structure are selected as model electrocatalysts to study the water oxidation mechanism. We found that bi-CoPc on a carbon support (bi-CoPc/carbon) shows an overpotential of 357 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), much lower than that of mono-CoPc/carbon (>450 mV). Kinetic analysis reveals that the rate-determining step (RDS) of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) over both electrocatalysts is a nucleophilic attack process involving a hydroxy anion (OH-). However, the substrate nucleophilically attacked by OH- for bi-CoPc is the phthalocyanine cation-radical species (Co-II-Pc-Pc+-Co-II-OH) that is formed from the oxidation of the phthalocyanine ring, while cobalt oxidized species (Pc-Co-III-OH) is involved in mono-CoPc as evidenced by the operando UV-vis spectroelectrochemistry technique. DFT calculations show that the reaction barrier for the nucleophilic attack of OH- on Co-II-Pc-Pc+-Co-II-OH is 1.67 eV, lower than that of mono-CoPc with Pc-Co-III-OH nucleophilically attacked by OH- (1.78 eV). The good agreement between the experimental and theoretical results suggests that bi-CoPc can effectively stabilize the accumulated oxidative charges in the phthalocyanine ring, and is thus bestowed with a higher OER performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000825691800001	35975146

According to the obtained thermal profiles, the orange peel degradation occurred in at least three steps associated with its three main components (hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin). The volatiles compounds evolved out at 150-400 A degrees C and the gas products were mainly CO2, CO, and CH4. A mixture of acids, aldehydes or ketones C=O, alkanes C-C, ethers C-O-C and H2O was also detected. The E (alpha) on alpha dependence reveled the existence of different and simultaneous processes suggesting that the combustion reaction is controlled by oxygen accessibility, motivated by the high evolution low-molecular-mass gases and volatile organic compounds. These results could explain the non-autocatalytic character of the reactions during the decomposition process.									86	2	0	0	13	1	89			1388-6150	1588-2926		WOS:000271282000041

Screening low-cost and highly active catalysts efficiently, however, is still a grand challenge. Herein, we symbolize a highly efficient guiding principle to govern the electrocatalytic activity of single-atom catalysts (SACs) based on AX (A = Al, Ga, In, and Tl; X = S and Se), BX2 (B = Mo and W) and ZrS2 monolayer substrates for the HER. Our results reveal that the catalytic performance of SACs for the HER is highly correlated with the electronegativity of the active site and its neighboring atoms as well as the distance between them. The descriptor was introduced to determine the activity of SACs for the HER, where the generalized principle can help to predict and design efficient electrochemical catalysts for hydrogen generation. More importantly, the identified descriptor can be acquired only from initial structures of the materials without considering other complicated processes involved in the HER, which is beneficial for screening catalysts more conveniently and quickly. Such an efficient descriptor, whose reliability has been demonstrated by more than 100 cases, may have potential applications in constructing efficient and low-cost SACs both theoretically and experimentally.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000536095500040

Its degradation has previously been reported to be associated with environmental changes and human activities, while there has been a limited number of studies on its inherent characteristics. In this study, both the physiological and molecular biological data indicated that the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of P. iwatensis is prone to photoinactivation, which exhibits the light-dependent trait. When exposed to laboratory light intensities similar to typical midday conditions, <10% of the OEC was photoinactivated, and the remaining active OEC was sufficient to maintain normal photosynthetic activity. Moreover, the photoinactivated OEC could fully recover within the same day. However, under harsh light conditions, e.g., light intensities that simulate cloudless sunny neap tide days and continual sunny days, the OEC suffered irreversible photoinactivation, which subsequently resulted in damage to the photosystem II reaction centers and a reduction in the rate of O-2 evolution. Furthermore, in situ measurements on a cloudless sunny neap tide day revealed both poor resilience and irreversible photoinactivation of the OEC. Based on these findings, we postulated that the OEC dysfunction induced by ambient harsh light conditions could be an important inherent reason for the degradation of P. iwatensis.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1664-462X			WOS:000767545300001	35283899

It is shown that oxidation rate of experimental alloys obeys the parabolic kinetics. Ti-22Al-26Nb-1Zr alloy demonstrates more excellent oxidation resistance than the other two alloys. The main oxidation products are TiO2, Al2O3 and AlNbO4 phases for all these alloys. For the Ti-22Al-26Nb-1Zr alloy, Zr addition can modify the growth mechanism of oxide scale, which can effectively hinder the diffusion of oxygen. Whereas, reaction of Zr with oxygen leads to the formation of ZrO2 precipitates for the Ti-22Al-21Nb-6Zr alloy, which promotes the oxygen ingress into the substrate. Meanwhile, oxidation affected zones, including internal-oxidation layer and oxygen-enriched zone, are present beneath the outmost oxide scale. The difference in these zones is derived from the phase constitution in the starting Ti-22Al-(27-x) Nb-xZr (x=0, 1, 6) alloys.									14	6	0	0	0	0	16			1003-6326	2210-3384		WOS:000352451700013

Among these methods, the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is one of the most promising ways for low-cost hydrogen production in the future. In this work, a simple redox hydrothermal method has been developed to fabricate a noble-metal-free MoO2/rGO composite for a highly efficient HER. GO nanosheets provide oxygen-containing functional groups for precursor attachment, and restrict growth of MoO2 nanoparticles (NPs) with a small size due to the space confinement effect among GO layers as well. Benefitting from a synergistic effect between metallic MoO2 NPs and graphene, the obtained MoO2/rGO composite exhibits excellent HER activity with a small onset overpotential of 190 mV, a large cathodic current density, and a small Tafel slope of 49 mV per decade, while MoO2 NPs or rGO itself is not a very efficient HER catalyst. Additionally, the MoO2/rGO composite displays good stability after 1000 potential cycles under both acidic and alkaline conditions. Dramatically improved HER activity and excellent stability are attributed to small size, more active sites, high conductivity and a synergistic effect of MoO2 NPs and graphene. The development of the MoO2/rGO composite as an enhanced active HER catalyst broadens the members of Mo-based HER catalysts and provides an insight into the design and synthesis of other noble-metal-free materials for the cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalyst in electrochemical hydrogen production.									72	6	0	0	1	0	73			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000352441100047

The very small size and high dispersibility of the Co3O4 nanoparticles allow for their homogeneous deposition on mesoporous hematite layers serving as the photoactive absorber in the light-driven water splitting reaction. This surface treatment leads to a striking photocurrent increase. While the enhancement of hematite photoanode performance by cobalt oxides is known, the preformation and subsequent application of well-defined cobalt oxide nanoparticles are novel and allow for the treatment of arbitrarily complex hematite morphologies. Photo-electrochemical and transient absorption spectroscopy studies show that this enhanced performance is due to the suppression of surface electron-hole recombination on time scales of milliseconds to seconds.									28	3	0	0	1	0	28			2196-7350			WOS:000368915800009

The reactor uses nitrogen carrier gas to which various amounts of oxidizer (from 6%-30% by volume) are added. Carbon loading (spherical 60/80 mesh spherocarb particles) is kept low so that the reactor remains nearly isothermal overall. A procedure for a non-intrusive approximation of average particle temperature rise was developed and indicated that particle temperatures do not nse more than 20 K above the bed temperature. Oxidation rates are determined by measuring the bed temperature and the time dependent formation of gas-phase carbon oxides. Assuming a first order dependence on oxidizer concentration, overall rates of oxidation for various pure oxidizers in nitrogen are determined. The overall activation energy for O-2 (37 +/- 2 kcal/mole) corresponds well with previously published values. Overall activation energies for CO2 (61 +/- 9 kcal/mole), and H2O (82 +/- 8 kcal/mole) are considerably larger than those for oxygen, and overall rats were found to be the same order of magnitude as those for oxygen at 1500 K and 1380 K respectively The overall activation energy for N2O (33 +/- 3 kcal/mole) is similar to that for oxygen with a rate about 75% slower.The surface reaction product distribution generated by surface reactions with oxygen was determined as a function of temperature below about 960 K (above which temperature the gas phase oxidation of CO to CO2 becomes significant). As temperatures decrease from 960 K-760 K the fraction of carbon oxides produced as CO2 increases exponentially, in agreement with the literature. However, the CO2/CO ratio reaches a maximum at about 760 K and then decreases significantly with further decreases in temperature.The active particle surface area evolved as a function of the extent of burnout in oxygen was found to increase initially, reaching a maximum (75% greater than the initial area) at about 25% conversion. With the exception of the decreasing CO2/CO ratio at low surface temperatures, FBR results are quantitatively consistent with published data obtained from oxidation studies on individual, levitated Spherocarb particles. The FBR technique described here is therefore an accurate means of determining an ''average'' burning behavior of individual particles of varying size and morphological properties.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0010-2202			WOS:A1995UQ62500007

Previous experiments have found that 3d transition metals Fe, Co, and Ni incorporated with inert carbon templates or carbon-nitrogen materials exhibit long-term durability and high HER activity in acidic electrolytes. To clarify the underlying mechanism determining the HER activity, here we report a theoretical investigation of the HER on a series of defective carbon nanotubes (CNTs), doped with atomic Co (CoCNT(n,n), n = 3, 5, 7, and 9) and codoped with Co and double N (CoN2CNT(5,5)), based on the first-principle density functional calculations. Our calculations indicate that the HER on these Co- and Co, N-(co)doped CNTs occurs via the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism, and the primary active sites are the C atoms adjacent to the metal center. The enhancement of the HER activity is due to uplifting of the p-band center (er) of the active C atoms induced by using a CNT with appropriate curvature, Co doping, and Co and N codoping. The HER activity of CoCNT(n,n)s follows a volcano dependence with surface curvature, showing nearly six orders of magnitude difference in exchange currents, peaked at CoCNT(5,5), with the activity comparable with Pt-catalysts. Doped with double N atoms in CoCNT(5,5), the exchange current could be further substantially enhanced (by 30 times), even one order of magnitude higher than that of Pt(111). The fact that CoN2CNT(5,5) has an e, (-4.16 eV) very close to the optimum value for the maximum exchange current (-4.14 eV) justifies the advance in improving the HER activity of CNTs.									23	2	0	0	2	0	23			2574-0970			WOS:000461401200032

Here, taking cobalt phosphide (CoP) as a model material, we establish the alkaline HER activity trends as a function of a fundamental property, the proportion of the unoccupied 3d orbital (P-un). By doping CoP with a range of 3d and 4d transition metals with different P-un, we show that the intrinsic alkaline HER kinetics increases with P-un. DFT calculations indicate that the transition metals with higher P-un not only act as the oxophilic sites for enhanced water activation but also modulate the electronic structure of CoP to endow an optimized H adsorption (Delta G*(H)), Moreover, by further comparing the correlation between water adsorption and dissociation or Delta G*(H) and experimental alkaline HER activities, we find that water dissociation is the rate-determining step for alkaline HER.									33	2	0	0	3	0	33				2666-3864		WOS:000658750600003

However, it operates at an overpotential significantly above the thermodynamic requirement. Here we present a facile one-step electrochemical reduction approach to incorporate fcc NiCo alloy with VIB group transition metals (M-NiCo, M = chromium (Cr), molybdenum (Mo), or tungsten (W)). This method enables to control the induction time of protrusion growth (tau) to produce hierarchical structure by imposing high current density (-0.6 A cm(-2)) and strong electric field on the cathode. Herein, W-NiCo holey nanotower arrays show tremendously enhanced HER activity compared with pristine NiCo alloy, which provides an overpotential of 109.2 mV (reduced by 58.7%) to achieve a current density of -10 mA cm(-2), with a Tafel slope of 110.3 mV dec(-1) in alkaline medium. The same law applies to the acid electrolyte with an overpotential of 78.5 mV (reduced by 66.1%) and low Tafel slop of 56.6 mV dec(-1). Based on the experimental and theory analysis, We find W-doping can promote more active sites exposed, tune the electron configuration, moderate the gibbs free energy of the H intermediate, and accelerate the desorption of H-2. It makes the rate-determining step change from Volmer to Heyrovsky reaction and finally surmount the limit of sluggish dynamics. The novel mute provides an efficient doping control on Ni-based hierarchical alloys via 4f-orbital electronic and geometric structure engineering, which suggests an environmentally friendly method for energy-related process in practical applications.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000730117900003

Electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) driven by renewable-derived electricity (e.g., wind and solar) is a promising pathway for fine chemicals production. In an electrochemical cell, GOR can be coupled with various cathodic reactions, including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR); in this manner, different benefits of either energy effectiveness or additional value-added products can be obtained depending on the cathode reduction reaction selected. Comprehensively understanding of electrocatalytic GOR and the associated processes is of great significance to promote its industrial application. Herein, recent progress of GOR is focused on. The background of biomass-derived glycerol valorization to energy and value-added chemicals as well as the electrochemical conversion techniques via GOR is introduced. Then, the electrocatalytic reaction pathways, the potential application of GOR, and the measurement method for products are also discussed and summarized. Special emphasis is put on the design and the development of high-selectivity and high-activity electrocatalysts for GOR. Finally, the challenges and the future prospects in the fields of GOR are highlighted.									32	0	0	0	4	0	32			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000599078600001

Here, a core-shell nanostructure composed of ZIF-67 core and Co (OH)(2) shell (ZIF-67@Co(OH)(2)) has been obtained by subjecting ZIF-67 nanocube to the optimal high temperature etching process. After refluxing and etching in ethanol/water mixed solution, the loose Co(OH)(2) shell can be constructed based on the surface of etched ZIF nanocube, which provides the obviously abundant active cobalt sites and better contact for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Compared to the whole hollow Co(OH)(2) nanocube, the solid ZIF-67 core in ZIF-67@Co(OH)(2) can be favorable for charge transfer and provide the stable structure. The synergistic effect between Co(OH)(2) shell and ZIF-67 core under suitable etching regulation can realize the optimized electrocatalysis for OER. The performance measurements show that Co(OH)(2)-1 after refluxing 1 h demonstrates the excellent activity requiring 354 mV overpotential at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and the good stability. The enhanced mechanism may be due to the formation of loose Co(OH)(2) as shell with fully exposed active sites, as well as the synergistic effect between ZIF-67 core and Co(OH)(2) shell. Therefore, the surface construction of active composites based on ZIF precursor may be a new strategy for efficient electrocatalysis for water splitting. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Investigation of the Alkaline Electrochemical Interface and Development of Composite Metal/Metal-Oxides for Hydrogen and Oxygen Electrodes								Investigation of the Alkaline Electrochemical Interface and Development of Composite Metal/Metal-Oxides for Hydrogen and Oxygen Electrodes								175 pp	175 pp						2015	2015	Understanding the fundamentals of electrochemical interfaces will undoubtedly reveal a path forward towards a society based on clean and renewable energy. In particular, it has been proposed that hydrogen can play a major role as an energy carrier of the future. To fully utilize the clean energy potential of a hydrogen economy, it is vital to produce hydrogen via water electrolysis, thus avoiding co-production of CO2 inherent to reformate hydrogen. While significant research efforts elsewhere are focused on photo-chemical hydrogen production from water, the inherent low efficiency of this method would require a massive land-use footprint to achieve sufficient hydrogen production rates to integrate hydrogen into energy markets. Thus, this research has primarily focused on the water splitting reactions on base-metal catalysts in the alkaline environment. Development of high-performance base-metal catalysts will help move alkaline water electrolysis to the forefront of hydrogen production methods, and when paired with solar and wind energy production, represents a clean and renewable energy economy. In addition to the water electrolysis reactions, research was conducted to understand the de-activation of reversible hydrogen electrodes in the corrosive environment of the hydrogen-bromine redox flow battery. Redox flow batteries represent a promising energy storage option to overcome the intermittency challenge of wind and solar energy production methods. Optimization of modular and scalable energy storage technology will allow higher penetration of renewable wind and solar energy into the grid. In Chapter 1, an overview of renewable energy production methods and energy storage options is presented. In addition, the fundamentals of electrochemical analysis and physical characterization of the catalysts are discussed. Chapter 2 reports the development of a Ni-Cr/C electrocatalyst with unprecedented mass-activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline electrolyte. The HER kinetics of numerous binary & ternary Ni-alloys and composite Ni/metal-oxide/C samples were evaluated in aqueous 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. Furthermore a model of the double layer interface is proposed, which helps explain the observed ensemble effect in the presence of AEI. In Chapter 3, Ni-Fe and Ni-Fe-Co mixed-metal-oxide (MMO) films were investigated for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity in 0.1M KOH on high surface area Raney-Nickel supports. During investigations of MMO activity, aniline was identified as a useful "capping agent" for synthesis of high-surface area MMO-polyaniline (PANI) composite materials. A Ni-Fe-Co/PANI-Raney-Ni catalyst was developed which exhibits enhanced mass-activity compared to state-of-the-art Ni-Fe OER electrocatalysts reported to date. The morphology of the MMO catalyst film on PANI/Raney-Ni support provides excellent dispersion of active-sites and should maintain high active-site utilization for catalyst loading on gas-diffusion electrodes. In Chapter 4, the de-activation of reversible-hydrogen electrode catalysts was investigated and the development of a Pt-Ir-Nx/C catalyst is reported, which exhibits significantly increased stability in the HBr/Br 2 electrolyte. In contrast a Pt-Ir/C catalyst exhibited increased tolerance to high-voltage cycling and in particular showed recovery of electrocatalytic activity after reversible de-activation (presumably from bromide adsorption and subsequent oxidative bromide stripping). Under the harshest testing conditions of highvoltage cycling or exposure to Br2 the Pt-based catalyst showed a trend in stability: Pt < Pt-Ir < Pt-Ir-Nx.

Herein, hierarchical microspheres assembled by in situ generated Co4N nanoparticles (Co4N Nps)-embedded nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (Co4N@NCNTs) are constructed by a facile urea acid (UA)-assisted pyrolysis of zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF)-67. In this strategy, the UA sharply decomposes at 440 degrees C to carbonaceous gases, which facilitate the nucleation of Co4N Nps for the catalytic growth of the NCNT microspheres structure from the intermediate ZIF-67 polyhedrons. The as-prepared Co4N@NCNTs exhibit high N content, abundant Co4N active species, high electron conductivity, and large specific area on a hierarchical micro-mesoporous structure. Therefore, the Co4N@NCNTs not only exceed Pt/C in terms of ORR half wave potential (0.85 vs 0.83 V) and limiting current density (5.50 vs 5.20 mA cm(-2)), but also manifest comparable OER activity with Ru/C. In the rechargeable zinc-air battery test, the bifunctional Co4N@NCNTs show excellent performance with high discharge and low charge potentials and relatively stable voltage gap as long as 500 cycles, which greatly outperform those of commercial Pt-Ru/C.									7	2	0	0	0	0	8			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000555451800001

Using flow through electrolytic reactors equipped with Ti/IrO2 Ta2O5 mesh electrodes, we show that combining electrochemical oxidation with aerobic biodegradation produces an overadditive treatment effect for degrading 1,4-dioxane. In reactors bioaugmented by Pseudonocardia dioxanivorans CB1190 with 3.0 V applied, 1,4-dioxane was oxidized 2.5 times faster than in bioaugmented control reactors without an applied potential, and 12 times faster than by abiotic electrolysis only. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses of CB1190 abundance, oxidation reduction potential, and dissolved oxygen measurements indicated that microbial growth was promoted by anodic oxygen generating reactions. At a higher potential of 8.0 V, however, the cell abundance near the anode was diminished, likely due to unfavorable pH and/or redox conditions. When coupled to electrolysis, biodegradation of 1,4-dioxane was sustained even in the presence of the common co-contaminant trichloroethene in the influent. Our findings demonstrate that combining electrolytic treatment with aerobic biodegradation may be a promising synergistic approach for the treatment of mixed contaminants.									23	3	0	0	16	0	25			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000414887200064	29023103

Herein, a hierarchical CoO-Co4N@NiFe-LDH (layered-double-hydroxides) heterostructure electrode anchored on nickel foam (NF) is prepared via a developed three-step hydrothermal-nitridation-electrodeposition pathway. The fabricated CoO-Co4N@NiFe-LDH/NF electrode needs low overpotential values of 66 and 231 mV to supply a current density value of 10 mA cm(-2) in aqueous solution of KOH (1 M) for HER and OER, respectively. The Tafel slopes and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results display favorable reaction kinetics throughout the electrolysis process. Subsequently, an alkaline electrolyzer is assembled with CoO-Co4N@NiFeLDH/NF, which serves both as the anode and cathode, yielding 10 mA cm(-2) with a small voltage of 1.529 V and showing a robust stability for 28 h. Impressively, a urine-mediated electrolysis cell shows efficient catalytic activity as well, allowing to mount the sluggish OER during water splitting. To drive the urine-mediated electrolysis cell containing 0.33 M urea, a low voltage of 1.393 V is required, which is about 136 mV lower compared to the urea-free electrolysis cell. This work presents a solid step for the electrocatalytic generation of hydrogen through water splitting by harvesting low energy.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2168-0485			WOS:000711203000020

Herein, we developed an efficient cobalt-vanadium spinel-type electrocatalyst with an extremely high concentration of Co3+ ions by tuning the balanced vanadium ions' concentration in crystallinity-modulated Co2-xVxO4 nanoplates. This resulted in the lowest overpotential of 240 mV at 10 mA/cm(2), the smallest Tafel slope of 45 mV dec(-1), and a current density of 100 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of 280 mV for water oxidation, which is remarkably 20 times better than that of the benchmark RuO2 catalyst, along with excellent stability. Such excellent performance is due to the very high Co3+/Co2+ ratio of 2.84 achieved in situ in the lowcrystallinity Co2-xVxO4 (LC-Co2-xVxO4) sample, which is 40% higher than that of the widely reported Co3O4, as evidenced by both operando X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy and in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These findings stimulate the opportunities to explore Co2-xVxO4 as a class of nonprecious-metal-based efficient OER electrocatalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000751835200019

The as-prepared catalysts were characterized and their composite nature was confirmed. The Zn(O,S)/Ga2O3 catalysts were examined for their ability to evolve hydrogen under low UV light illumination (0.088 mW cm(-2)) and to provide hydrogen for 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) reduction. Gas chromatography measurements revealed that hydrogen was produced at a rate of 280 mmol g(-1) h(-1) W-1, while UV-vis absorption and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) measurements confirmed the formation of 4-aminophenol (4-AP) as a product of 4-NP reduction. The heterojunction formation between the Zn(O, S) and Ga2O3 phases enhanced the photocatalytic activity, compared to the single Zn(O, S) and Ga2O3 phases. Surface oxygen anions and oxygen vacancies played important roles in the photocatalytic mechanism to evolve hydrogen and to utilize hydrogen ions in 4-NP reduction. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction and its utilization for 4-NP reduction to 4-AP were evaluated and elucidated in this work.									32	1	0	0	2	0	32			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000413526200008

Here, with O-17 NMR as a direct probe of O activities, it is demonstrated that stacking faults enhance O redox participation compared with Li2MnO3 domains without stacking faults. This work is concluded by combining both ex situ and in situ O-17 NMR to investigate the evolution of O at 4i, 8j sites from monoclinic C2/m and 6c(1), 6c(2), 6c(3) sites from the stacking faults (P3(1)12). These measurements are further corroborated and explained by first-principles calculations finding a stabilization effect of stacking faults in delithiated Li2MnO3. In situ O-17 NMR tracks O activities with temporal resolution and provides a quantitative determination of reversible O redox versus irreversible processes that form short covalent O-O bonds. This work provides valuable insights into the O redox reactions in Li-excess layered cathodes, which may inspire new material design for cathodes with high specific capacity.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000769633200001

Aqueous solutions of RuCl3 and NaBH4 were used as reagents for the synthesis. It is shown that the thin films synthesized as a result of 10-60 SILD cycles are formed by flat globules of a hydrated Ru (IV) oxide with a planar size of about 100 nm and Ru-0 nanoparticles with a size of 5-9 nm. Based on the experimental data obtained, schemes are designed of the sequence of chemical reactions occurring on the surface of the substrate during synthesis. A study of the electrochemical properties of the thin films showed that nickel foam electrodes with Ru-x(0)-RuO2 center dot nH(2)O layers synthesized as a result of 10, 20, 40 and 60 SILD cycles exhibited overpotential values equal to 49, 36, 32 and 31 mV at 10 mA/ cm(2) and Tafel slope values equal to 75.4, 65.2, 54.5 and 53.9 mV/dec, respectively, in hydrogen evolution reaction during water electrolysis in alkaline medium. A comparison of these values indicates that the values of the overpotential and Tafel slope for the samples synthesized after 40 and 60 SILD cycles are approximately equal, but the sample obtained after 40 SILD cycles contains a smaller amount of the electrocatalyst, which makes it possible to choose the latter sample as optimal in terms of composition and electrocatalytic properties. It is important that the overpotential value for the sample increased only by 4 mV after 500 potential cycling, which indicates a relatively high stability of its properties.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000782104100001		
J	Li, Xue; Fan, Mingli; Wei, Danan; Wang, Xiaolong; Wang, Yinling								Core-Shell NiO/C@NiFe-LDH Nanocomposite as an Efficient Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Evolution Reaction								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				167	2					024501	10.1149/1945-7111/ab61eb				JAN 2 2020	2020	Highly efficient and low-cost oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts have been urgently needed for the development of renewable hydrogen energy via water electrolysis. Herein, a core-shell NiO nanoparticles decorated carbon sphere (NiO/C) and NiFe-layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) nanocomposite (NiO/C@NiFe-LDH) was prepared by a calcination-hydrothermal synthesis approach. In this nanocomposite, NiO/C as the core were derived from Ni based metal organic frameworks (Ni-MOFs), which not only provide a porous and conductive carbon support for NiFe-LDH nanosheets to expose active sites, but also offer a synergistic active site for NiFe-LDH nanosheets. The structure and morphology of NiO/C@NiFe-LDH were mainly characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and nitrogen adsorption-desorption test. The OER catalytic activity of NiO/C@NiFe-LDH was optimized by adjusting the ratio between NiO/C and NiFe-LDH and adding bridging agents. Under the optimum conditions, the overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) for NiO/C@NiFe-LDHs is only 299 mV(vs RHE), lower than that of commercial RuO2 (330 mV). Besides, the NiO/C@NiFe-LDH exhibits a good stability in 10-hour testing. These results show that the ingenious combination of different OER catalysts may be an effective strategy to prepare low-cost OER catalysts with good performance.

The work presented here has been applied to the particular case of the Pb,PbSO4 vertical bar H2SO4 (aq)vertical bar PbO2,Pb cell, which forms the basis of the lead-acid batteries so widely used in the automotive industry and as traction batteries in electric or hybrid vehicles.Each half-cell is considered independently in the model. For each half-cell, in addition to the main electrode reaction, a secondary reaction is considered: the hydrogen evolution reaction in the negative electrode and the oxygen evolution reaction in the positive.The equilibrium potential is calculated with the Nernst equation, in which the activity coefficients are fitted to an exponential function using experimental data. On the other hand, the two main mechanisms that produce the overpotential are considered, that is the activation or charge transfer and the diffusion mechanisms.First, an isothermal model has been studied in order to show the behavior of the main phenomena. A more complex model has also been studied including thermal behavior. This model is very useful in the case of traction batteries in electric and hybrid vehicles where high current intensities appear.Some simulation results are also presented in order to show the accuracy of the proposed models.

Compared with CoOx and CoSx, CoSe2 is superior for improving the photocatalytic water oxidation activity due to the lower anionic electronegativity, which leads to dense adhesion and enables fast interfacial charge transfer for the water oxidation reaction.									87	7	0	0	3	0	87			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000360117600004

Alloying Pt with other metals is an alternate idea, however, as a promising catalyst should be synthesized on a large scale, one important goal is that the morphologies and electrocatalytic activities of the as-obtained electrocatalysts can maintain the same, even when the precursor ratio is varied. In addition, according to the Le Chatellier's principle as more earth-abundant precursors were used can accelerate the transforming efficiency of noble metal during the synthesis. Unfortunately, no current research has reached this goal, we herein report a facile two-step method for the synthesis of three-dimensional CuPt alloys via galvanic replacement between the noble Pt precursor and pre-synthesized copper (Cu) nanocubes in a liquid system free of capping agent. Further investigation proved that the morphologies can be regulated via changing the reaction temperature, while the composition of precursors does not affect the morphologies evolutions match well with the industrial demand. The CuPt alloys obtained at 80 degrees C (denoted as CuPt-80) exhibited superior activities towards both HER and MOR reaction when compared with CuPt-60, CuPt-100, Pt nanocrystals (Pt NCs) and 20% Pt/C. This work enriched the application of Le Chatellier's principle and provides a promising way for the rational design and synthesis of efficient and robust catalysts for sustainable energy conversion.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2199-692X			WOS:000695992100001		
J	MIYAKE, C; ASADA, K								THYLAKOID-BOUND ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE IN SPINACH-CHLOROPLASTS AND PHOTOREDUCTION OF ITS PRIMARY OXIDATION-PRODUCT MONODEHYDROASCORBATE RADICALS IN THYLAKOIDS								PLANT AND CELL PHYSIOLOGY				33	5			541	553						JUL 1992	1992	Ascorbate peroxidase, a key enzyme for the scavenging of hydrogen peroxide in chloroplasts, was found in a thylakoid-bound form in spinach chloroplasts at comparable activity to that in the stroma. The activity of peroxidase was detectable in the thylakoids only when prepared by an ascorbate-containing medium, and enriched in the stroma thylakoids. The thylakoid enzyme was not released from the membranes by either 2 mM EDTA, 1 M KCl, 2 M NaBr or 2 M NaSCN, but was solubilized by detergents. Enzymatic properties of the thylakoid-bound ascorbate peroxidase were very similar to those of the stromal ascorbate peroxidase.Thylakoid-bound ascorbate peroxidase could scavenge the hydrogen peroxide either added or photoproduced by the thylakoids. No photoreduction of hydrogen peroxide was observed, however, in the thylakoids whose ascorbate peroxidase was inhibited by KCN and thiol reagents or inactivated by the treatment with ascorbate-depletion. The primary oxidation product of ascorbate in a reaction of ascorbate peroxidase, monodehydroascorbate (MDA) radical, was photoreduced in the thylakoids, as detected by the quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence, disappearance of EPR signals of the MDA radicals and the MDA radical-induced oxygen evolution. Thus, ascorbate is photoregenerated in the thylakoids from the MDA radicals produced in a reaction of ascorbate peroxidase for the scavenging of hydrogen peroxide.									412	36	1	0	385	2	456			0032-0781	1471-9053		WOS:A1992JH08300005

The effect of reaction time and metal precursor ions on the morphology of synthesized nanostructures was studied in detail with the aid of a scanning electron microscope. By systematic optimization of the synthesis parameters, Co oxide nanostructures with single dimensionality were obtained in the form of 0D nanoparticles (NPs), 1D nanowires (NWs), 2D nanosheets (NSs) and 3D nanocrystals (NCs). The effectiveness of the developed nanostructures towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was studied and a promising OER activity was recorded for all the samples. Amongst all the developed catalysts, Co(OH)(2) NPs showed the lowest overpotential of 339 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is even lower than that of noble-metal oxides such as the commercial RuO2 catalyst (370 mV). The specific effect of different parameters such as BET surface area, phase, crystallographic orientation of surface lattice planes, electroactive surface area and surface active species on the OER performance was studied. It was found that the Co3O4 phase is more active for the OER, compared to the Co(OH)(2) phase. However, Co(OH)(2) NPs showed the best OER performance owing to their higher BET surface area, thereby underlining the significance of the catalyst surface area. The effect of the number of active surface atoms was demonstrated by estimating the electroactive surface area of all Co3O4 nanostructures. It was also shown that the formation of CoO2 species (Co-(IV)) on the surface is more beneficial for the OER as compared to the formation of CoOOH species (Co-(III)). Finally, the robustness of the developed Co3O4 nanostructures was established by performing a recycling test for the OER (1000 cycles) and the observed change in the catalytic activity was correlated with morphological variation.									44	2	0	0	1	0	44			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000432096400050	29713706

Herein, we report a core-shell structured chainmail catalyst composed of Ni2P nanoparticles wrapped by ultrathin phosphorous-doped carbon shells on the graphene network. Benefiting from the unique architecture, this hybrid catalyst needed overpotentials of only 110 mV and 150 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) hydrogen evolution current density in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH for more than 24 h, respectively. Theoretical analysis revealed that the strong electronic interactions between ultrathin carbon shell and inner Ni2P core, phosphorus dopant and neighboring carbon in the shell were responsible for the enhanced electrochemical activity. This study offers not only an effective method to prepare the efficient chainmail catalysts, but also valuable insights for future design of core-shell structures through electronic modulation to enhance the activity and stability of such catalysts.									29	0	0	0	1	0	29			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000452482900015

The MEB micrographs are shown of the spherical grains and uniform agglomeration of the grains. The oxide powders were used as the films to form a support on Ni/oxides. Oxygen evolution on each oxide catalyst was signed in the cyclic voltammetry with +/- 15 V range and the electrochemical impedance in the equivalent of 100 kHz.

The hydrogen atoms of the "clustered" monohydride groups are located close to each other. The "clustered" monohydride groups are inaccessible to the ambient because they are embedded in the amorphous network. The "dilute" monohydride groups are relatively isolated from each other. The majority of "dilute" monohydride groups are open to the ambient. They are located on the surface of preferentially interconnected microchannels and microvoids.Interaction between the "dilute" SiH groups and atmospheric oxygen results in formation of OSiH groups in which hydrogen and oxygen are bonded to a common silicon atom. Evidently, the interaction occurs throw the oxygen reaction with weak bonds associated with "dilute" monohydride groups. There is no interaction between oxygen and both "clustered" SiH groups and {SiH2}(n) chains because the former are inaccessible to atmospheric oxygen and the latter has presumably no weak bonds in the chains.

In the present study, the cavity formation in UCG has been simulated using experiments carried out in three configurations: (i) sublimation experiments in camphor simulating primarily the heat transfer aspects, (ii) bore hole combustion in Acacia nilotica wood bringing in chemical reaction into play, and (iii) bore hole combustion a coal block bringing into consideration the effect of ash on the cavity formation. In all the three cases, the time-evolution of the cavity shape has been monitored under constant oxygen flow rate conditions by measuring the cavity shape and size at periodic intervals. Results show that the cavity formation rates as well as the shape of the cavity are significantly affected by the oxidant flow rate. The importance of the ash present in the coal on the cavity growth has also been brought out. A fair amount of gasification leading to the formation of H(2), CO and CH(4) was observed; this is shown to depend both on the inherent moisture as well as on the reaction zone temperature.

Known for more than two centuries, the HER still receives great attention in fundamental and applied science in view of its apparent simplicity (only two electrons are transferred), fast kinetics in acidic media, and promising technological applications in electrolyzers. However, the exact nature of active catalytic sites for this reaction is often uncertain, especially at nonuniform metal electrodes. Identification of such centers is important, as the HER will probably be central in future energy provision schemes, and it is simultaneously a convenient model reaction to study structurecomposition-activity relations in catalysis. In this work, using simple coordination-activity considerations, we outline the location and geometric configuration of the active sites at various model Pt single-crystal electrodes. We show that when the coordination of such surface sites is optimized and their density at the surface is maximized, the experimentalspecific HER activities are among the highest reported in the literature for pure platinum with a well-defined surface structure under similar conditions.									30	1	0	0	0	0	30			2470-1343			WOS:000418744100074	31457359

Using dynamic electro-chemo-mechanical analysis, we study zeta(E) simultaneously with cyclic voltammetry. The study covers extended potential intervals on Au, Pt, and Pd, including the electrosorption of oxygen species and of hydrogen. The magnitude and sign of zeta vary during the scans, and quite generally the graphs of zeta(E) emphasize details which are less obvious or missing in the cyclic voltammograms (CVs). Capacitive processes on the clean electrode surfaces exhibit zeta < 0, whereas capacitive processes on oxygen-covered surfaces are characterized by zeta < 0 on Au but zeta > 0 on Pt and Pd. The findings of zeta < 0 during the initial stages of oxygen species adsorption and zeta > 0 for hydrogen electrosorption agree with the trend that tensile strain makes surfaces more binding for adsorbates. However, the large hysteresis of oxygen electrosorption on all electrodes raises the question: is the exchange current associated with that process sufficient for its measurement by potential response during small cyclic strain?									21	1	0	0	0	0	22			0743-7463			WOS:000341230100045	25142913

Great advancements in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) have been achieved, but the progress on driving HER in seawater is still limited. Herein, Fe-doped MoS2 nanoshseets array supported by 3D carbon fibers was explored to be an efficient HER electrocatalyst operating in seawater. Strikingly, it exhibited small overpotentials of 119 and 300 mV to reach the current densities of 10 and 250 mA cm(-2) in buffered seawater, respectively, both of them are comparable to the best-reported values under similar conditions. Meantime, the catalyst could keep the stable HER activity for 30 h without notable loss. Theoretical calculations revealed that Fe doping increases the S-edge activity. Our work provides a new avenue for designing MoS2-based HER electrocatalysts for industry application.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000675617200001	34229303

Herein, we report nitrogen/sulfur-codoped carbon nanosheets (NSC) decorated with dense Co9S8/Co1-xS heterostructures (Co9S8/Co1-xS@NSC), prepared by a one-pot salt template-assisted pyrolysis procedure. The population of the Co9S8/Co1-xS heterostructure can be effectively controlled by tuning the precursor components. Salt templates constructed hierarchical porosity for the wide-open carbon nanosheets, which maximized the N functional groups to anchor highly dispersive Co9S8/Co1-xS species. Experiments and theoretical simulations revealed notable electronic interactions within Co9S8/Co1-xS interfaces, which can effectively optimize the adsorption/desorption behaviors of intermediates in ORR/OER, thus promoting the bifunctional electrocatalytic performance. The half-wave potential for the ORR of 0.86 V and the OER electrocatalytic potential of 1.52 V at 10 mA cm(-2) were obtained. Benefiting from the strong coupling effect between the Co9S8/Co1-xS species and the carbon substrate, superior durability was obtained for 2000 ORR/OER cycles. The practical zinc-air battery based on the Co9S8/Co1-xS@NSC cathode manifested a high open-circuit voltage, small voltage gap and robust reversibility. Our study revealed the great potential of the bi-elemental (Co and S) heterostructure in enhancing the ORR/OER activity, which suggests a logical extension to other electrocatalysis systems.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000660068500001

Here we report the engineering of a cytochrome P450 enzyme by directed evolution to catalyze metal-oxo-mediated anti-Markovnikov oxidation of styrenes with high efficiency. The enzyme uses dioxygen as the terminal oxidant and achieves selectivity for anti-Markovnikov oxidation over the kinetically favored alkene epoxidation by trapping high-energy intermediates and catalyzing an oxo transfer, including an enantioselective 1,2-hydride migration. The anti-Markovnikov oxygenase can be combined with other catalysts in synthetic metabolic pathways to access a variety of challenging anti-Markovnikov functionalization reactions.									105	9	0	0	39	0	112			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000412841500046	29026041

Electrocatalysts can promote the water splitting performance at the both ends. Therefore, the design of cost-effective, high-performance electrocatalysis is a key factor in promoting water decomposition and renewable energy conversion. Among candidates, layered molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is considered as a most promising electrocatalyst to replace Pt for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Surface atomic engineering and interface engineering can induce new physicochemical properties for MoS2 to greatly enhance HER activity. In this report, we summarize the latest improvement strategies and research progress to improve the catalytic activity of MoS2-based material catalysts through the surface and interface atomic and molecular engineering, thus effectively improving HER process. In addition, some unsolved problems in the large-scale application of modified MoS2 catalyst are also discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000790423100001	35438831

In this work we demonstrate a proof of principle approach whereby exposing the liquid metal alloyed with the required metal to acidic conditions circumvents preferential formation of Ga(2)O(3)and allows for the formation of the required 2D transition metal oxide nanosheets. The synthesis procedure is straightforward in that it only requires bubbling oxygen gas through the liquid metal alloy into a solution of 10 mM HCl. We show that the formation of thin nanosheets ofca.1 nm in thickness of CoO is possible. The material is characterised using transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, X-ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopy. The electrocatalytic activity of the CoO nanosheets was investigated for the oxygen evolution reaction where the nanosheet thickness was found to be a factor influencing the activity. This proof of principle offers a route to the possible formation of many other 2D transition metal oxides from metals that are less readily oxidised than Ga by taking advantage of the interesting properties of room temperature liquid metals.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11				2046-2069		WOS:000560694000018	35521128

Doped zirconia nanoparticles were synthesized by a sol-gel liquid-phase route and characterized by different techniques, including X-ray diffraction powder pattern, ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Gels annealed at around 400 A degrees C yielded tetragonal Pr (x) Zr1-x O-2 phases. The monoclinic forms of Pr-doped ZrO2 were obtained by annealing at temperatures higher than 1,100 A degrees C. TEM micrographs proved that the size of the nanoparticles produced was dependent on their crystalline form, around 15 and 60 nm for tetragonal and monoclinic, respectively. The electrochemical study confirmed that a relatively high content of praseodymium cation was in the chemical state (IV), i.e., as Pr4+, in both zirconia host lattices. The catalytic and photocatalytic effects of Pr4+ centers located in the monoclinic zirconia lattice on nitrite reduction and oxygen evolution reaction were studied.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			1432-8488			WOS:000301041000017

In this work, we rationally designed and synthesized a metal-free 2D/2D boron/g-C3N4 nanosheet heterojunction (B-CN) through an electrostatic self assembly thermal induction combined with ultrasound-assisted technology. The optimized photocatalyst 3.0B-CN possesses a hydrogen generation rate 35 times that of g-C3N4, which provided an impressive H-2 evolution photocatalytic activity. The tight heterojunction architecture via the coupling of two-dimensional boron nanosheets and g-C3N4 nanosheets realizes the enhanced visible light absorption, the increasing carrier concentration, and the rapid transfer of interfacial charge and thus hinders the electron-hole recombination. The coupling of two 2D metal-free nanosheet materials for constructing a 2D/2D layered heterojunction in our work offers pioneering tactics for the design and synthesis of green nonmetal 2D photocatalytic HER materials in the future.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000844547700001

Here, we report the synthesis of N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNT) with confined FeCo nanoclusters and Pt nanoparticles (Pt/FeCo@NCNT). This hybrid material allows synergy between an active structure and a strong electronic interaction. The catalyst requires only 0.3 wt % Pt, and it can achieve a low overpotential of 14 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Its Tafel slope of 31 mV dec(-1) and a high mass activity of 47 A mg(Pt)(-1) at 50 mV are superior to those of commercial Pt/C catalyst with 67 times higher Pt loading. The predominant HER performance of the Pt/FeCo@NCNT is mainly ascribed to the strong mutual electronic structure of FeCo and Pt coupled to the NCNT.

The kinetic data related respectively to Mn3+ anodic formation and O-2 anodic evolution at Pt and Pb\PbO2 anodes in mixed H2SO4-MnSO4 solutions were measured by resolving the steady-state polarization curves. The Tafel slope of steady-state phi-lgi relationships for Mn3+ anodic formation reaction is close to 2 X 2.303RT/beta F, whereas for O-2 anodic evolution it is close to 2.303RT/beta F (with beta = 0.5), The influence of Ag+ ions on the kinetics of evolution and Mn3+ anodic formation at Pt and Pb\PbO2 electrodes was compared as a function of Ag+ ions concentration. The O-2 evolution and Mn3+ formation rate increased uniformly with increasing Ag+ ions concentration in the electrolytes. The kinetic data show that Mn3+ anodic formation (i(Mn3+)) and O-2 anodic evolution (i(O-2)) increased by Ag+ ions. Since the effect on i (Mn3+) was larger than that an i(O-2) at the Pt electrode and smaller than that on i(O-2) at the Pb\PbO2 electrode, the current efficiency of Mn3+ formation increased at the Pt electrode and decreased at the Pb\PbO2 electrode.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0251-0790			WOS:A1995RC03700031

J	Zakharov, D. O.; Tanaka, R.; Butterfield, D. A.; Nakamura, E.								A New Insight Into Seawater-Basalt Exchange Reactions Based on Combined delta O-18-Delta ' O-17-Sr-87/Sr-86 Values of Hydrothermal Fluids From the Axial Seamount Volcano, Pacific Ocean								FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE				9						691699	10.3389/feart.2021.691699				SEP 9 2021	2021	The delta O-18 values of submarine vent fluids are controlled by seawater-basalt exchange reactions, temperature of exchange, and to a lesser extent, by phase separation. These variations are translated into the delta O-18 values of submarine hydrothermal fluids between ca. 0 and + 4 parts per thousand, a range defined by pristine seawater and equilibrium with basalt. Triple oxygen isotope systematics of submarine fluids remains underexplored. Knowing how delta O-17 and delta O-18 change simultaneously during seawater-basalt reaction has a potential to improve i) our understanding of sub-seafloor processes and ii) the rock-based reconstructions of ancient seawater. In this paper, we introduce the first combined delta O-17-delta O-18-Sr-87/Sr-86 dataset measured in fluids collected from several high-temperature smoker- and anhydrite-type vent sites at the Axial Seamount volcano in the eastern Pacific Ocean. This dataset is supplemented by measurements of major, trace element concentrations and pH indicating that the fluids have reacted extensively with basalt. The salinities of these fluids range between 30 and 110% of seawater indicating that phase separation is an important process, potentially affecting their delta O-18. The Sr-87/Sr-86 endmember values range between 0.7033 and 0.7039. The zero-Mg endmember delta O-18 values span from -0.9 to + 0.8 parts per thousand, accompanied by the Delta ' O-17(0.528) values ranging from around 0 to -0.04 parts per thousand. However, the trajectory at individual site varies. The endmember values of fluids from focused vents exhibit moderate isotope shifts in delta ' O-18 up to +0.8 parts per thousand, and the shifts in Delta ' O-17 are small, about -0.01 parts per thousand. The diffuse anhydrite-type vent sites produce fluids that are significantly more scattered in delta ' O-18-Delta ' O-17 space and cannot be explained by simple isothermal seawater-basalt reactions. To explain the observed variations and to provide constraints on more evolved fluids, we compute triple O isotope compositions of fluids using equilibrium calculations of seawater-basalt reaction, including a non-isothermal reaction that exemplifies complex alteration of oceanic crust. Using a Monte-Carlo simulation of the dual-porosity model, we show a range of possible simultaneous triple O and Sr isotope shifts experienced by seawater upon reaction with basalt. We show the possible variability of fluid values, and the causal effects that would normally be undetected with conventional delta O-18 measurements.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2296-6463		WOS:000703481200001

The results indicated that the incorporation of black TiO2 nanoparticles facilitated the formation of porous PbO2 architecture, improved the oriented growth of [101] and [301] planes, and inhibited the oxygen evolution reaction. The degradation experiment of anthraquinone dye (reactive brilliant blue KN-R) indicated that black TiO2 embedded Ti/PbO2 electrode has higher photo-electrocatalytic activity than that of Ti/PbO2 electrode. Furthermore, the accelerated life test showed that the service life of black TiO2 embedded Ti/PbO2 electrode was much longer than that of Ti/PbO2 electrode. The enhancement of decolorization efficiency and stability for black TiO2 embedded Ti/PbO2 electrodes can be attributed to the formation of porous PbO2 architecture, the existence of photoelectric synergy, inhibition of the oxygen evolution reaction, and weakening of internal stress in PbO2 coatings. The black TiO2 embedded Ti/PbO2 electrode is considered as a promising anode for the treatment of organic pollutants.The black TiO2 embedded Ti/PbO2 electrode showed significant photoelectric synergy in PEC process for degradation of anthraquinone dye aqueous solution (reactive brilliant blue KN-R) owing to introduction of black TiO2.[GRAPHICS].									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000407386000006

Herein, unique N-doped carbon nanotubes encapsulated with FeNi nanoparticles (FeNi/N-CNT) derived from defect-rich, molecule-doped 3D g-C3N4 are reported as effective bifunctional catalysts for high efficiency ZABs. FeNi/N-CNT is produced via thermal polycondensation of malazide and melamine, followed by the coordination of Fe- and Ni-containing precursors and subsequent pyrolysis. The as-synthesized FeNi/N-CNT exhibits excellent bifunctional oxygen reduction and evolution activity and stability. A primary ZAB assembled with FeNi/N-CNT presented a high peak power density and large specific capacity. Prominently, a rechargeable ZAB based on FeNi/N-CNT delivers outstanding stability in a charging/discharging cycle test (over 800 h at 5 mA cm(-2)), which places it at the forefront of various reported ZABs. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the synergistic coupling between FeNi nanoparticles and N doped CNTs facilitated the production of a satisfactory surface electronic environment, thus enhancing the bifunctional ORR/OER performance.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000778336600001

To date, the most stable Si photocathode in alkaline media is protected by the atomic layer deposited (ALD) dense TiO2 layer and catalyzed by noble metal-based catalysts on top. However, the ALD process is difficult to scale up, and the noble metals are expensive. Herein, we report the first demonstration of using a scalable hydrothermal method to deposit earth-abundant NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) to simultaneously protect and catalyze Si photocathodes in alkaline solutions. The NiFe LDH-protected/catalyzed p-type Si photocathode shows a current density of 7 mA/cm(2) at 0 V vs RHE, an onset potential of similar to 0.3 V vs RHE that is comparable to that of the reported pn(+) Si photocathodes, and durability of 24 h at 10 mA/cm(2) in 1 M KOH electrolyte.									49	6	0	0	2	0	49			2380-8195			WOS:000410600500001

The precursors included N-doped dodecahedron-like graphene nanosheets (GNS), in which the NiCo-MOF was encompassed within the inner cavities of the GNS (NiCo-MOF@GNS) at the end or middle portion of the tubular furnace with several graphene layers. Volatile imidazolate N-x species were trapped by the NiCo-MOF nanosheets during the pyrolysis process, simultaneously inserting N atoms into carbon matrix to achieve the defect-rich porous nanosheets and the abundantly porous cavity structure. With high durability, the as-prepared nanomaterials displayed simultaneously improved performance in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and photocatalysis. In particular, our material NiCo-MOF@GNS-700 exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity, including a half-wave potential of 0.83 V (E-ORR,E- (1/2)), a low operating voltage of 1.53 V (E-OER,E- (10)) at 10 mA cm(-2), a potential difference (Delta E) of 1.02 V between E-OER,E- 10 and E-ORR,E- (1/2) in 0.1 M KOH, and a low band gap of 2.61 eV. This remarkable behavior was due to the structure of the defect-rich porous carbon nanosheets and the synergistic impact of the NPs in the NiCo-MOF, the N-doped carbon, and NiCo-N-x. Furthermore, the hollow structure enhanced the conductivity and stability. This useful archetypal template allows the construction of effective and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts, with potential for practical viability for energy conversion and storage.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2470-1343			WOS:000665649000053	34179648

The modern electrocatalytic VRs are generally based on the kinetic models with the maximum free energy (Delta G(max)(0)) of reaction steps as the rate-determining term (RDT), in which some important factors that crucially impact the reaction kinetics are missed, for examples, the surface structures and coverages of reaction intermediates and spectators, other free energy demanding steps than that associated with the Delta G(max)(0), and so on. In this perspective, we first give a brief introduction of the theoretical framework of current electrocatalytic VRs and the underlying problems in the oversimplified Delta G(max)(0)-based kinetic models, and then provide an account of our effort in constructing more rational VRs for electrocatalytic reactions. We introduce a new theoretical framework of electrocatalytic VRs based on kinetic model with the so-called energetic span (delta E) serving as RDT. Since the surface-coverage effects and multiple free energy-demanding steps are considered, the VRs thus obtained show several new features such as strong potential dependence, asymmetric ascending and descending branches, relatively flat tops, and so on. The effectiveness of the delta E-based VRs is verified for hydrogen and oxygen electrocatalytic reactions. Finally, research directions to further rationalize the electrocatalytic VRs are discussed.

The most promising way to reduce the precious metal loading is to design and develop highly active Ir-based catalysts. In this study, a versatile approach is reported to prepare a hybrid in the form of a catalyst-support structure (Fe-IrOx@a-Fe2O3, abbreviated Ir@Fe-MF) by utilizing the self-dissolving properties of Fe-MIL-101 under aqueous conditions. The formation of this hybrid is mainly due to the Ir4+ and released Fe3+ ions coprecipitated to assemble into Fe-IrOx nanoparticles, and the Fe3+ released from the inward collapse of the metal-organic framework (MOF) spontaneously forms alpha-Fe2O3. The prepared Ir@Fe-MF-2 hybrid exhibits enhanced catalytic activity toward OER with a lower onset potential and Tafel slop, and only 260 mV overpotential is required to drive the current density to reach 10 mA cm(-2). The performed characterizations clearly indicate that the IrO6 coordination structure is changed significantly by Fe incorporated into the IrO2 lattice. The performed X-ray adsorption spectra (XAS) provides evidence that Ir 5d orbital degeneracy is eliminated because of multiple orbitals being semi-occupied in the presence of Fe, which is mainly responsible for the enhancement of OER activity. These findings open an opportunity for the design and preparation of more efficient OER catalysts of transition metal oxides by utilization of the MOF materials. It should be highlighted that a long-term stability of this catalyst run at a high current density in acidic conditions still faces great challenges.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000546698600050	32496754

However, solar light mediated N-2 photoreduction through a semiconductor photocatalyst is a green and sustainable route, which could help to suppress global warming and serve as an attractive hydrogen fuel storage medium. Herein, we have synthesized a phosphide protected FeS2-FeP-CeO2NS ternary nanohybrid through a simple hydrothermal method followed by a sulfidation-phosphidation technique. The physicochemical and morphological properties of the synthesized materials were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The optimum CPS3 nanohybrid exhibits a remarkable ammonia evolution rate of up to 5.6 mmol h(-1) g(-1) under mild reaction conditions and without using any precious noble metal or organic scavengers. The obtained results were superior to those obtained from recently reported hybrid materials. The main reason for the high photofixation may be because: (i) the O-v/Ce3+ and Fe-P act as active sites for nitrogen adsorption and activation; and (ii) the photoelectrons are well separated and transfer to the activated N-2 and the overall kinetic study reveals the two electron proton coupled reduction reaction. This work gives some insightful and significant information about the construction and selection of earth abundant photocatalysts for use in the ideal solar driven nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR).									54	4	0	0	4	0	55			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000465152700046

In this paper, a kinetic model of corona discharges is presented to simulate the evolution process of charged particles and neutral species in humid air. To investigate the effect of humidity, our model consists of 69 species and 393 chemical reactions which consider important reactions containing H2O molecules and hydrates. In addition, CO2 molecules are also included to improve the integrity of reaction database. A temporal evolution of reduced electric field strengths E/N, which are typical experimental values of corona discharges, is used as input. The simulation results show that H3O+ is one of the dominant positive ions which is in qualitative agreement with previous experimental results. The effect of humidity and pulse width on the plasma chemistry is also discussed. It is found that the humidity affects the maximum density and life time of the specific species. Meanwhile, the plasma chemistry could be affected by different pulse widths of the input electric field.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			0272-4324	1572-8986		WOS:000477907500010

Functional materials have specific properties that are useful for the fabrication of active devices such as sensors, electronic components, catalytic reactors, etc. It is shown here that the combination of standard 3D-printing technologies with easy-to-use electrochemical surface modification can facilitate the tuning of catalytic properties of printed metallic electrodes to be used as electrocatalysts for water splitting applications. A self-contained electrochemical system, consisting of electrodes and an electrochemical cell, is built via 3D metal and polymer printing. Stainless-steel electrodes are first obtained by selective laser melting additive manufacturing according to an established design; then electrochemical surface modification is performed to alter the electrode surface composition and therefore tune its catalytic properties toward the electrogeneration of hydrogen and oxygen. After surface characterization by means of scanning electron microscopy in combination with energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis to evaluate the efficiency of the electrochemical functionalization, electrochemical testing is carried out to evaluate the catalytic properties of the electrodes. A simple, proof-of-concept water electrolyzer is finally assembled with the best performing electrodes and tested in alkaline solution for water splitting capabilities.									72	2	0	0	9	3	72			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000436929400024

Herein, N-doped mesoporous carbon-supported CoO@Co nanoparticles are prepared in situ using the ionic liquid (IL) 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrachlorocobalt ([BMIm](2)[CoCl4]) as the precursor with silica as the hard template. The material was characterized by TGA, BET, XRD, TEM, XPS, and H-2-TPR. After exposure to air, the species on the surface of the Co is CoO, as verified by XPS. The pore size is about 2 nm, and the CoO@Co nanoparticles were irregularly shaped and sized in the range of 20-300 nm, which may have been due to the aggregation of ultrafine nanoparticles. The existence of an interaction between the CoO@Co nanoparticles and the N-doped support is confirmed by XPS and H2-TPR. The catalyst shows superior activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) manifested in its lower charge potential (3.75 V at the current density of 100 mA g(-1)). Enhanced performances in coulombic efficiency, rate capability, and cycling stability (55 cycles) are also realized. Finally, these improvements, with the exception of the catalytic activity of CoO, may benefit from the interaction between the carbon supporter and the CoO@Co nanoparticles.									43	1	0	0	5	0	43			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000376091600029

Herein, zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) polyhedrons are first in situ grown on the fibrils of commercial melamine foam at room temperature, and then phosphided and carbonized to obtain the free-standing 3D hierarchical CoP@N-doped carbon composite foam (CoP@NC/CF) with interconnected architecture. The 3D interconnected carbon networks provide efficient and fast channels for the rapid transfer of ions and electrons, and inhibit the agglomeration of CoP nanoparticles. The unique structure of CoP@NC/CF thus allows for delivering the remarkable HER performance with a low overpotential of 151.3 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), small Tafel slope of 64.8 mV dec(-1), and excellent long-term stability. This research provides a new strategy for the rational design and facile synthesis of the free-standing 3D CoP-based catalysts for high-performance HER.									19	1	0	0	1	0	19			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000510846500066

Though the importance of electron and mass transport has been studied using low surface area catalysts under low current densities (similar to tens of mA/cm(2)), the transport properties of large surface area catalysts under high operating current densities (similar to 500 mA/cm(2)) for practical OER catalysis have rarely been explored. Herein, three-dimensional (3D) hierarchically porous anodized nickel foams (ANFs) with large and variable surface areas were synthesized via electrochemical anodization of 3D nickel foam and applied as OER electrocatalysts in Fe-free and unpurified KOH electrolytes. Using Fe-free and in situ Fe-doped ANF that were prepared in Fe-free and unpurified electrolytes, respectively, we investigated the interdependent effects of active surface area and transport properties on OER activity under practically high current densities. While activity increased linearly with active surface area for Fe-free ANF, the activity of Fe-doped ANF showed a nonlinear increase with active surface area due to lower electrocatalytic activity enhancement. Detailed investigations on the possible factors (Fe incorporation, mass transport, and electron transport) identified that electron transport limitations played the major role in restricting the activity enhancement with increasing active surface area for Fe-doped ANF, although Fe-doped ANF has electron transport properties better than those of Fe-free ANF. This study exemplifies the growing significance of electron transport properties in large surface area catalysts, especially those with superb intrinsic catalytic activity and high operating current density.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000623061800124	33512156

Here, we report a rational design and simple preparation method of MoS2-based bifunctional electrocatalyst on carbon cloth (CC). The optimized P-doped MoS2@CoP/CC catalyst presents low overpotentials for the hydrogen (HER) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) of 64 and 282 mV in alkaline solution as well as 72 mV HER overpotential in H2SO4 at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, P-MoS2@CoP/CC as a bifunctional catalyst delivered relatively low cell voltages of 1.83 and 1.97 V at high current densities of 500 and mA cm(-2) in 30 % KOH. The two-electrode system showed a remarkable stability for 30 h, even outperformed the benchmark RuO2||Pt/C catalyst. The excellent electrochemical performance can be credited to the unique microstructure, high surface area, and the synergy between metal species.

However, compared to the excellent stability, a relatively low catalytic activity of metal-metalloids often limits their practical application as high-performance water oxidation catalysts. Here, for the first time, disclosed is a novel self-templating strategy combined with atomic layer deposition (ALD) to design the electrochemically active and stable quaternary metal boride (vanadium-doped cobalt nickel boride, VCNB), hollow nanoprism by inducing electronic double layers on the surface. The incorporation of V in a double-layered structure can substantially increase the number of surface active sites with unsaturated electronic structure. Furthermore, the induced electronic double layers of V can effectively protect the dissolution of the surface active sites. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the impressive water oxidation properties of VCNB originate from the synergetic physicochemical effects of the different metal elements, Co and B as active sites, Ni as a surface electronic structure modifier, and V as a charge carrier transporter and supplier.									68	2	0	0	3	0	67			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000467131300010

The catalyst was a mixture of unsupported Pt black and Ir black catalysts in varying proportions. The performance of the unsupported PtIr catalyst was studied by using a rotating ring disc electrode (RRDE) and linear sweet) voltammetry (LSV). In addition, a unit cell lest was performed simultaneously in the electrolyzer and in the fuel cell mode to evaluate the performance and durability of PtIr catalysts. The catalyst composition consisting of 85 wt.% Pt and 15 wt.% Ir showed high oxygen evolution reactivity and comparable electrochemical activity compared to the unsupported Pt black catalyst. The URFC using Pt85Ir15 catalyst showed the highest round-trip efficiency when estimated at different current densities. The cycle performance of URFC Pt85Ir15 catalyst was stable for 120 h at an applied cut rent density of 0.5 A cm(-2). (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that the In2SeS/g-C3N4 heterostructure with a bandgap (E-g) of 2.03 eV is a typical type II semiconductor, which guarantees that the generated electrons and holes can be effectively separated. The potential of the conduction band minimum (CBM) and the valence band maximum (VBM) satisfies the requirements for photocatalytic water splitting. Meanwhile, the In2SeS/g-C3N4 heterostructure has a strong light-absorption ability, and mainly absorbs purple and blue light. In addition, the changes of Gibbs free energy (Delta G) are calculated to understand the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process of water splitting. Under neutral conditions (pH = 7), the Gibbs free energy continuously decreases during the OER process, verifying the thermodynamic feasibility of water splitting through the In2SeS/g-C3N4 heterostructure. Hence, the In2SeS/g-C3N4 heterostructure is a kind of photocatalyst with excellent performance in the area of photocatalytic water splitting.									40	4	0	0	0	0	41			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000538108200032

Here, we prepare such a catalyst by growing a layer of Mo2N over a layer of CeO2 deposited on nickel foam (NF) [hereafter, Mo2N/CeO2@NF] and show that the activity of this self-supported catalyst for hydrogen evolution in 1.0 M KOH is more efficient than that of the Pt/C electrode, achieving a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at a fairly low overpotential of 26 mV. Furthermore, after a long-time electrochemical stability test for 24 h at a fixed current density, the overpotential needed to attain a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) is increased only by 6 mV, implying the huge potential of this method to prepare a super HER activity electrode for water splitting.									32	2	0	0	0	0	33			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000546698600023	32510189

This is done by evolving white dwarf progenitors from the zero-age main sequence, through the core hydrogen-burning phase, the helium-burning phase, and the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase to the white dwarf stage. Complete evolutionary sequences are computed for a wide range of stellar masses and for two different metallicities, Z = 0.01, which is representative of the solar neighborhood, and Z = 0.001, which is appropriate for the study of old stellar systems, like globular clusters. During the white dwarf cooling stage, we self-consistently compute the phase in which nuclear reactions are still important, the diffusive evolution of the elements in the outer layers and, finally, we also take into account all the relevant energy sources in the deep interior of the white dwarf, such as the release of latent heat and the release of gravitational energy due to carbon-oxygen phase separation upon crystallization. We also provide colors and magnitudes for these sequences, based on a new set of improved non-gray white dwarf model atmospheres, which include the most up-to-date physical inputs like the Ly alpha quasi-molecular opacity. The calculations are extended down to an effective temperature of 2500 K. Our calculations provide a homogeneous set of evolutionary cooling tracks appropriate for mass and age determinations of old DA white dwarfs and for white dwarf cosmochronology of the different Galactic populations.									194	2	0	0	2	0	196			0004-637X			WOS:000278777900015

The electrochemical activity of the electrode in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV) techniques. The performance of catalyst as the cathode was investigated in an AAEM electrolyzer single cell by separating of the anode and cathode polarizations. PdNiFeCo/C-Ceria-NF exhibited a high catalytic activity toward HER and AAEM cathode reaction. PdNiFeCo/C-Ceria-NF showed a low Tafel slope (-79 mV dec(-1)), and low overpotential at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (-14 mV) in HER. Also, PdNiFeCo/C-Ceria-NF electrode showed an excellent stability performance in alkaline media during 30 h. The membrane electrode assembly (MEA) which was equipped with PdNiFeCo/C-Ceria-NF exhibited the cell voltage of 2.31 V compared to 2.22 V for Pt/C on Ni foam (Pt/C-NF) at the current density of 300 mA cm(-2).

The coatings remain nanocrystalline during annealing, but co-deposited carbon and oxygen result in temperature-induced phase transformations. Energy-dispersive synchrotron diffraction revealed that carbides and oxides form during annealing of the as-deposited coating, which consisted mainly of carbon-free ferrite.

However, low defect content and poor oxygen mobility of the spinel structure make it difficult to efficiently activate C-H bonds of propane at low-temperature. Herein, novel amorphous Co-Mn binary oxides with enhanced defect were fabricated by a facile self-redox approach. Highly defective amorphous Co-Mn binary oxides with low-temperature reducibility, weak Mn-O bond strength and good mobility of the surface lattice oxygen remarkably improved the catalytic activity for propane oxidation. Highly defective amorphous Co1Mn3Ox catalyst showed the best catalytic activity for propane mineralization and the T-90 was 207 degrees C under high space velocity (18 000 mL.g(-1) h(-1)). Moreover, in situ spectroscopy technologies were utilized to explore the structure-activity relationship and the degradation mechanism of propane oxidation under real reaction condition. Significantly, as an effective defect engineering strategy, amorphous binary oxides exhibit excellent activity and can provide some enlightenments for developing efficient VOCs catalysts.									49	0	0	0	4	0	49			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000591690300004

As a HER electrocatalyst, (220) preferred orientation nickel nanowire arrays exhibited higher catalytic activity and stability in alkaline solution, and the hydrogen evolution overpotential was as low as 128 mV at the current density of 10 mA.cm(-2). The performance is attributed to the higher surface energy of the (220) lattice plane of nickel nanowire arrays as the exposed surface and more active sites participate in HER process, which is beneficial to charge transfer and decrease of activation energy of reactions. Simultaneously, the activation energy of exposed surface evaluated directly by calculating with First-principles correspond to the trend of the experimental results, catalytic activity (220) > (200) > (111) lattice plane in the hydrogen evolution process. The strategy of using crystal anisotropy to improve catalytic performance can be extended to the synthesis of other nanocrystals with higher activity and high-energy surface catalysts.

Herein, a melamine-bridged self-construction strategy is proposed to in situ embed Co-based bimetallic nanoparticles in the body of N-doped porous carbon spheres (CoM-e-PNC), and achieve the controllable tailoring of the d-band center position by alloying of Co and another transition metal M (M = Ni, Fe, Mn, and Cu). The enrichment and exposure of the active sites in the body interior of porous carbon spheres, and the best balance between the adsorption of OH species and the desorption of O-2 induced by optimizing the d-band center position, collectively enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Meanwhile, the relationship of d-band center position and OER activity is found to exhibit the volcano curve rule, where the CoNi-e-PNC catalyst shows optimal OER performance with an overpotential of 0.24 V at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media, outperforming those of the ever-reported CoNi-based catalysts. Besides, CoNi-e-PNC catalyst also demonstrates high OER stability with slight current decrease after 100 h.									60	5	0	0	2	0	60			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000486130300001	31502762

Here, we report the in situ synthesis of mononuclear manganese(III) pincer complexes [Mn(OAc)(L)(cbpy)] (1) and [Mn(OAc)(L-1)(cbpy)] (2) on a gold electrode surface through a self-assembly process (where OAc = acetate, cbpy = 2,2'-bipyridine-4-carboxylic acid anion, L = N,N'-(2,6-dimethyIphenyl)-2,6-pyridinedicarboxamidate (2-) and L-1 = N,N'-(diphenyl)-2,6-pyridinedicarboxamidate (2-)) and explore their activity for the eIectrocataIytic OER (2H(2)O = 4H(+) + 4e(-) + O-2) in neutral pH medium. The modified electrode was characterized by using microscopic (FE-SEM), spectroscopic (EDX, ATR-FTIR, SERS), and electrochemical (CV and EIS) methods. The newly developed heterogenized molecular catalysts 1 and 2 can catalyze the OER exceptionally well with a Low overpotential of 260 mV at J = 3.2 mA cm(-2) and 275 mV at J = 2.46 mA cm(-2) , respectively. The TafeI slopes were found to be 68 and 77 mV decade(-1) for the catalysts 1 and 2, respectively. These results support the higher OER activity of complex 1 than complex 2 under similar conditions and this may be due to more electron donating power of pincer ligand L than L-1, which in turn stabilizes the high valent manganese complex intermediates. Furthermore, after Long-term controlled potential electrolysis (similar to 6 h), the surface-immobilized manganese complex does not decompose into manganese oxide and preserves the molecular identity as evident from electrochemical, spectroscopic and microscopic results.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000849051700001

In this work, we develop a simple theory to optimize the electrocatalytic PCET reactions, in which electron and proton transfer take place in sequential steps, by combining an energy level diagram and micro-kinetic theories. Our theory suggests matching conditions on PCET energetics (redox potentials and pK(a)'s) and reaction environments (potential and pH) in order to achieve maximum kinetics. Consequently, a descriptor representing deviation from the ideal condition, i.e. vertical bar Delta U-re vertical bar+ 2.30k(B)T/e vertical bar Delta pK(a)vertical bar, is proposed to measure catalyst (in)activity. To test our theory, we further investigate CO2 electroreduction on a model catalyst both computationally and experimentally, and show that the activity for CO2 reduction on FePc (Iron Phthalocyanine) molecule is higher than H-2 evolution at near neutral condition. Our theory not only identifies the individual contribution of electron and proton transfer to overpotentials but also provides simple guidelines for optimizing the experimental conditions and searching for efficient catalysts.

The pattern of changes in both the heat evolution and the conversion of hydrogen observed in the H-2/O-2 reaction seem to reflect the effect of water formation on the activity/deactivation of the studied catalysts. The catalysts have been prepared using the colloid-based reverse "water-in-oil" microemulsion method and characterized by XRD, XPS, SEM, EDS techniques. The recombination reaction of hydrogen and oxygen has been monitored using Microscal gas-flow through microcalorimeter as well as a laboratory flow microreactor. The humidity present in the reaction mixture and the water molecules formed in the recombination reaction both inhibited the activity of the tested catalysts. The nature of support and the type of metal played a role in such water-poisoning effect. Deactivation of alumina supported catalysts was stronger than silica supported counterparts and Pt was more prone to the water inhibition compared to Pd. The most promising catalysts exhibiting the lowest amount of evolved heat accompanied by high and stable activity are silica supported Pd-rich bimetallic Pd-Pt particles whereas alumina wash-coat-Pt is the catalyst of chose in the PAR reactors. The observed activity/water-poisoning relations found confirmation in the DFT calculations concerning the interactions between water molecules and mono-(Pd, Pt) as well as bi (Pd-Pt) metallic clusters as a function of cluster size and Pd/Pt compositions.

Due to its small size, large surface area and high conductivity, this electrocatalyst shows excellent activity in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

To meet this requirement, herein, for the first time, we present a novel bifunctional CoSnS@CNT hybrid via a simple one-pot surfactant-free hydrothermal method. The CoSnS@CNT hybrid has a unique three-dimensional (3D) porous nanoarchitecture, which is constructed by ultrathin CoSnS homogenously and compactly anchored on a highly conductive CNT skeleton. The porous nanoarchitecture of CoSnS@CNT provides abundant catalytic sites and facilitates ion diffusion, and the CNT skeleton accelerates electron transfer. Benefitting from these merits, the CoSnS@CNT hybrid acted as a bifunctional catalyst with boosted electrocatalytic and photocatalytic performance, where it delivered a tremendous oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with a low overpotential of 330 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent outstanding stability. Moreover, it showed 91.72% photocatalytic degradation for Rhodamine B dye, which is 2-times higher than that of bare CoSnS. This study presents a systematic approach to judiciously design nanostructures and simply synthesize non-noble metal-based bifunctional catalysts with boosted electrocatalytic and photocatalytic activities.									20	1	0	0	1	0	20			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000515391000031	31998917

Ferromagnetic Prussian blue (PB) in contact with titanium dioxide (TiO2) can be reduced to paramagnetic Prussian white (PW) upon UV band gap excitation of TiO2. This process is promoted by the presence of a hole scavenger, such as water, fundamental to ensure the overall charge balance and the continuity of the process. In order to clarify the photoinduced reduction mechanism and the role of water, an innovative system of graphene nanobubbles (GNBs) filled with a PB aqueous solution was developed, enabling the application of electron spectroscopies to the liquid phase, up to now limited by the vacuum required to overcome the short electron inelastic mean free path in dense medium. In this work GNBs formed on the photocatalytic substrate are able to act as "nanoreactors", and they can control and take part in the reaction. The evolution of Fe L-2,L-3 edge X-ray absorption spectra measured in total electron yield through the graphene membrane revealed the electron reduction from PB (Fe-III-CN-Fe-II) to PW (Fe-II-CN-Fe-II) upon UV irradiation, shedding light on the photoinduced electron transfer mechanism in liquid phase. The results, confirmed also by Raman spectroscopy, unequivocally demonstrate that the reaction occurs preferentially in aqueous solution, where water acts as hole scavenger.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1932-7447			WOS:000413131700050

Therefore, searching for highly efficient catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is particularly important. In this work, by tuning the molar ratio of Co/Fe, we produced a series of ultra-thin two-dimensional (2D) Co-x-Fe-y-P nanosheets on carbon cloth (Co-x-Fe-y-P/CC) as HER electrocatalysts. The structure of Co-x-Fe-y-P nanosheets directly depends on the amounts of iron incorporation in the Co-x-Fe-y-P, while the optimal amount of incorporated iron motivates the electrocatalytic performance of Co-x-Fe-y-P for HER, i.e. the Co-0.515-Fe-0.168-P exhibits excellent catalytic performance with a small overpotential of 41 mV at a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2), and a Tafel slope as low as 31.5 mV dec(-1) in 0.5M H2SO4. Detailed investigation reveals the obviously increased electrochemically active surface area, faster electrons transfer, and the strong electronic interaction between the heterogeneous elements after incorporating Fe might boost the excellent HER performance.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000461150400012

A fraction of CoCl2 can be reduced to Co nanoparticles and wrapped by the nitrogen doped carbon. Meanwhile, the ratio of MF resin to CoCl2 is an important parameter determining the mesoporous structures of the final products. The surface area of the obtained material decreases with the increase in the ratio of MF resin to CoCl2. Electrocatalytic tests show that the obtained catalysts are highly active for hydrogen evolution reaction in both acidic and basic media, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 171 and 186 mV under acidic and alkaline conditions, respectively. Additionally, these catalysts also show good long-term stabilities. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.									11	1	0	0	0	0	12			0021-9797	1095-7103		WOS:000427808900046	29408131

The obtained Ag/OMMC catalyst displays smaller Ag particle size, higher Ag dispersion, and enhanced catalytic activity and durability compared with the carbon black Vulcan XC-72R supported Ag (Ag/XC-72R). The sizes of Ag particles supported on the OMMC and XC-72R are 4.3 and 6.5 nm, respectively. The prepared Ag/OMMC catalyst shows a positive half-wave potential of 0.79 V vs. RHE and a large diffusion-limited current of 5.6 mA cm(-2) at 0.4 V, superior to Ag/XC-72R catalyst. The better ORR performance of the Ag/OMMC is probably ascribed to the unique 3D ordered interconnected macro-/mesoporous structure, which contributes to facilitating the mass/charge transport, improving the Ag particle dispersion, and preventing the Ag particle growth and aggregation.

In its active form, the enzyme contains an iron-sulfur center and an oxygen-sensitive glycyl radical (Gly-681). The radical is generated in the inactive protein from S-adenosylmethionine by an auxiliary enzyme system present in E. coli. By modification of the previous purification procedure, we now prepared a glycyl radical-containing reductase, active in the absence of the auxiliary reducing enzyme system. This reductase uses formate as hydrogen donor in the reaction. During catalysis, formate is stoichiometrically oxidized to CO2, and isotope from [H-3] formate appears in water. Thus E. coli uses completely different hydrogen donors for the reduction of ribonucleotides during anaerobic and aerobic growth. The aerobic class I reductase employs redox-active thiols from thioredoxin or glutaredoxin to this purpose. The present results strengthen speculations that class III enzymes arose early during the evolution of DNA.									79	0	0	0	61	0	82			0027-8424			WOS:A1995RU75900046	7568012

The O-17(p, gamma)F-18 reaction plays a critical role in the synthesis of both oxygen and fluorine isotopes, but its reaction rate is not well determined because of the lack of experimental data at energies relevant to novae explosions. In this study, the reaction cross section has been measured directly for the first time in a wide energy range E-c.m. similar or equal to 200-370 keV appropriate to hydrogen burning in classical novae. In addition, the E-c.m. = 183 keV resonance strength, omega gamma = 1.67 +/- 0.12 mu eV, has been measured with the highest precision to date. The uncertainty on the O-17(p, gamma)F-18 reaction rate has been reduced by a factor of 4, thus leading to firmer constraints on accurate models of novae nucleosynthesis.									54	0	0	0	0	0	54			0031-9007	1079-7114		WOS:000310991700006	23215474

It is demonstrated that CO2 can be effectively captured by molten carbonates, and subsequently electrochemically split into amorphous carbon on the cathode, and oxygen gas at the anode. The carbon materials generated at the cathode exhibit high BET surface areas of more than 400 m(2) g(-1) and as such, represent value-added products for a variety of applications such as energy storage and pollutant adsorption. In the carbonate eutectic (500 degrees C), the presence of Li2CO3 is shown to be required for the deposition of carbon from the melt, wherein O-2(-) or Li2O serves as the intermediate for CO2 capture and electrochemical conversion. SnO2 proved to be an effective anode for the electrochemical evolution of oxygen. Electrochemical reactions were found to proceed at relatively high current efficiencies, even though the current densities exceed 50 mA cm(-2). The intrinsic nature of alkaline oxides for CO2 capture, the conversion of CO2 to value-added products, and the ability to drive the process with renewable energy sources such as solar power, enables the technology to be engineered for high flux capture and utilization of CO2.									200	18	0	0	14	0	213			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000317984700018

Enhancement of oxygen evolution reaction by X-doped (X 1/4 Se, S, P) holey graphitic carbon shell encapsulating NiCoFe nanoparticles: a combined experimental and theoretical study								MATERIALS TODAY CHEMISTRY				23						100706	10.1016/j.mtchem.2021.100706		DEC 2021		MAR 2022	2022	Among the two half-reactions of the electrochemical water splitting, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a kinetically sluggish process and usually requires noble metal oxide catalysts. Therefore, the development of highly active, noble metal-free, and durable catalysts for OER is an urgent need for sustainable applications. The encapsulation of transition-metal alloyed nanoparticles in graphitic carbon layers, with core-shell features, is a viable approach for establishing an undegradable and highly efficient catalyst toward OER. Furthermore, the reactivity of the carbon shell surface can be further improved by the electron transfers between the core alloy and carbon shell, through a control of the alloyed nanoparticle compositions, or through a chemical doping. Nevertheless, it is still not clear whether the incorporation of a chemical dopant directly into the carbon shells systematically promotes the catalytic activities toward OER. To clarify this point, we synthetize trimetallic (CoNiFe) nanoparticles encapsulated in graphitic carbon shells by pyrolysis of metal-organic frameworks. We then investigate the effect of a doped graphitic carbon shell by incorporating non-metallic elements such as sulfur, phosphorus, and selenium. The main finding is that all doped CoNiFe@C core-shell catalysts exhibit an enhanced catalytic activity toward OER in the alkaline electrolyte with a low overpotential, a small Tafel slope, and long stability, which are all being comparable to those of RuO2 benchmark. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic, and Raman measurements collected at different applied potentials during the OER process indicate that the doping of graphitic carbon shell significantly improves the interfacial electron-transfer kinetics and facilitates the adsorption of OH- ion as well as promotes the formation of metal oxyhydroxide, which positively affect the OER performances. Moreover, this improvement in OER efficiency upon incorporating of a chemical doping is rationalized by the optimization of the Gibbs free energy of OER intermediates, thereby remarkably reducing the required energy input of rate-determining step, as elucidated by the density functional theory calculations.

Under the guidance of this concept, PtRh nanowires with Rh atom modification (PtRh0.02@Rh NWs), which exhibited excellent properties during the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and ethylene glycol evolution reaction (EGOR), were designed and synthesized by controlling the reduction rate of metal precursor through a simple one-step solvothermal reduction. The interface strain effect produced by the metal co-doping effectively adjusted the electronic structure, contributing to introducing the heteroatom active center and inducing lattice strain, thereby achieving excellent electrocatalytic performance. The obtained PtRh0.02@Rh NWs exhibited excellent HER property with an extremely low overpotential of 30.6 and 45.8 mV, and Tafel slope of 39.1 and 39.5 mV dec(-1) in alkaline water and seawater electrolytes, respectively, as well as outstanding EGOR properties with peak current density of 1.25 and 1.17 A mg(-1), respectively. Additionally, the PtRh0.02@Rh NWs showed superior stability compared to that of commercial platinum black obtained from Johnson Matthey Corporation (JM-Pt black). When using PtRh0.02@Rh NWs as biofunctional materials for the HER in the cathode and the EGOR in the anode, a cell voltage of only 0.66 V for PtRh0.02@Rh NWs (HER)||PtRh0.02@Rh NWs (EGOR) achieved a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which was much smaller than that of PtRh0.02@Rh NWs (HER)||PtRh0.02@Rh NWs (OER) at 1.57 V. The results of electrochemical in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy showed that the synthesized PtRh0.02@Rh NWs promoted the production of high-value glycolic acid when EG was dehydrogenated to form C2 intermediates. The Rh atoms modified on the surface of the Pt nanowires provided an effective strain effect to optimize the active sites, which creates a universal strategy for the design of highly efficient and durable bifunctional catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000852872800001

The morphology and composition of this catalyst are analyzed using scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The morphology characteristics reveal that flower-like Fe2O3 particles are highly dispersed on both MnO2 nanotubes and CNT surfaces, coupling all three components firmly. Electrochemical measurements indicate that the synergy of catalyst exhibit superior bifunctional catalytic activity for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as well as stability than Pt/C and IrO2 catalysts. Using these catalysts for air-cathodes, both primary and rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs) are assembled for performance validation. In a primary ZAB, this 3D-clamed catalyst shows a decent open circuit voltage (OCV, similar to 1.48 V) and a high discharge peak power density (349 mW cm(-2)), corresponding to a coulombic efficiency of 92%. In a rechargeable ZABs with this bifunctional catalyst, high OCV (> 1.3 V) and small charge-discharge voltage gap (< 1.1 V) are achieved along with high specific capacity (780 mAh g(-1) at 30 mA cm(-2)) and robust cycle-life (1,390 cycles at cycle profile of 20 mA/10 min).

Secondary electron microscope (SEM) imaging shows the open as well as close cup-shaped spheres and discs, while transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies confirmed the ultrafine NiCo alloy particles ' formation on nitrogen-doped multilayer graphitized carbon. Moreover, Raman spectroscopy revealed the I-D/I-G ratio to be about 1.57 for N-doped graphitic multilayer carbon, thereby suggesting the defective nature of graphitized carbon material, which may possibly be due to the incorporation of nitrogen atoms into graphitic carbon layers. The formation of extremely small NiCo alloy nanoparticles is attributed to the reducing carbonaceous environment of CVD constituted by ethanol and acetonitrile precursors, while carbon spheres/disks seem to be catalysed by silica substrate originated from an alcogel catalyst. In addition, synthesised hybrid nanocomposites materials were tested for OER electrocatalysis in alkaline conditions and it was found that synthesized NiCo alloy nanoparticles decorated on N-doped carbon spheres have an overpotential 310 mV at current density of 10 mA/cm(2) which is just 5 mV higher than that of benchmark Ir/C (20 wt % Ir) electrocatalyst. The multiphase components of synthesised material like; electrically conductive carbon, nitrogen-doped sites and well-separated ultrafine NiCo alloy nanoparticles synergistically contributed towards better OER activity in alkaline conditions.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2365-6549			WOS:000771566900027

We discovered that the choice of chlorides or nitrates for the metal salts results in different metal cluster stability in acetone and therefore controls the direction of nanomodification. Specifically, with metal chlorides, stable metal clusters are formed in acetone, which facilitates Ni dissolution from the nanosheets into the solution, resulting in the porous structures. With metal nitrates, however, metal cluster growth is unstable. Therefore, Ni dissolution from the nanosheets is suppressed, while the hydrolysis and decomposition of metal nitrates result in the deposition of the branched features.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1431-9276			INSPEC:20224326

The use of noble metal-based catalysts leads to an economic bottleneck because of the high cost associated with such materials. This article is an electrochemical investigation of an economically viable and advanced OER catalyst made of cobalt/graphene nanocomposite quantum dots (QDs). A series of characterization techniques, such as high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, and fluorescence measurements, were performed, and they confirmed the formation of graphene QDs as well as the formation of cobalt-based QDs. A very high current density of 43.16 mA cm(-2) was observed for the QD nanocomposite, whereas smaller current densities were seen for Co nanoparticles (21.1 mA cm(-2)) and a benchmark Pt/C commercial catalyst (5.99 mA cm(-2)). Furthermore, an overpotential of only 0.49 V is required for the composite material at 10 mA cm(-2), which is lower than the other two catalysts studied. Electrochemical impedance studies show that the composite material has the highest affinity toward OER of all of the materials investigated at several potentials. Chronoamperometric and chronopotentiometric investigations reveal short-term stability for the composite, where instability was observed for the comparison materials. This research is the first observation of transition-metal/graphene QD nanocomposites for electrocatalysis. These observations, along with high stability, serve as an exciting starting point for the foray into earth abundant transition-metal QD-based electrocatalysts for clean energy and environmental applications.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1932-7447			WOS:000464768600078

Electrocatalytic and photocatalytic water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen is a promising and emerging technology. Heterogeneous nanostructures based on semiconductor materials have attracted much attention to be used as catalysts, co-catalysts, photocatalysts and photoabsorbers. Development of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) semiconductors with two dimensional (2D) layered structures and peculiar physical and chemical properties are playing a pivotal role in the heterogeneous photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) reaction. The energy band gap tuning with the thickness of the layers and heterojunction interface formation have given an opportunity to design and develop combinations of both photocatalysts and co-catalysts using semiconductor TMDCs. This contribution summarizes the recent investigations on the 2D semiconductor TMDC (MoS2, WS2, MoSe2 and WSe2) based heterogeneous nanostructures as efficient materials for photocatalytic water splitting applications to produce hydrogen. The literature survey clearly shows that more than 80% of the researchers in this field have worked on MoS2-based heterogeneous nanocomposites, as it is the 2(nd) most studied material after graphene. It is also evident that among the materials used so far for the PC HER activity, MoS2-based heterogeneous nanocomposites are on top with the highest hydrogen evolution rate and stability. Since the physical and chemical properties of the members are identical, the future research and development would focus on the manipulation of the rest of the TMDC members to achieve the future needs of clean and sustainable energy production.									47	1	0	0	0	0	47			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000483593600001	31411204

Here, we report initially the synthesis of modified graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanorods via the calcination of intermediates obtained from the co-polymerization of precursors, and the in-situ hybridization of Ag3PO4 with as-prepared modified gC(3)N(4) to produce g-C3N4 nanorod/Ag3PO4 composite materials. The diameter of modified rod-like g-C3N4 materials is determined to be around 1 mu m. Subsequently the morphological features, crystal and chemical structures of the assembled g-C3N4 nanorod/Ag3PO4 composites were systematically investigated by SEM, XRD, XPS, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS). Furthermore, the use of as-prepared composite materials as the catalyst for photocatalytic oxygen evolution from water splitting was studied. The oxygen-generating results showed that the composite photocatalyst modified with 600 mg rod-like g-C3N4 demonstrates 2.5 times higher efficiency than that of bulk Ag3PO4. The mechanism behind the enhancement in the oxygen-evolving activity is proposed on the basis of in-situ electron spin resonance (ESR) measurement as well as theoretical analysis. The study provides new insights into the design and development of new photocatalytic composite materials for energy and environmental applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, O-2 evolution reaction (OER) may cause oxygen bubbles to be trapped in small-sized confined flow channels, and thus degrade long-term filterability and treatability of REM. In this study, ultrasound (ultrasonic vibrator, 28 kHz, 180 W) was applied to EO system (i. e. sonoelectrochemistry) containing titanium suboxide-REM (TiSO-REM) anode for enhanced oxidation of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) target pollutant. Both experimental and modeling results demonstrated that ultrasound could mitigate the retention of O-2 bubbles in the porous structures by destructing large-size bubbles, thus not only increasing permeate flux but also promoting local mass transfer. Meanwhile, oxidation rate of 4-CP for EO with ultrasound (EO-US, 0.0932 min(-1)) was 216% higher than that for EO without ultrasound (0.0258 min(-1)), due to enhanced mass transfer and center dot OH production under the cavitation effect of ultrasound. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed the most efficient pathway of 4-CP removal to be direct electron transfer of 4-CP to form [4-CP](center dot+), followed by subsequent oxidation mediated by center dot OH produced from anodic water oxidation on TiSO-REM anode. Last, the stability of TiSO-REM could be improved considerably by application of ultrasound, due to alleviation of electrode deactivation and fouling, indicated by cyclic test, scan electron microscopy (SEM) observation and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) characterization. This study provides a proof-of-concept demonstration of ultrasound for enhanced EO of recalcitrant organic pollutants by REM anode, making decentralized wastewater treatment more efficient and more reliable.									9	0	0	0	4	0	9			1350-4177	1873-2828		WOS:000567794500019	32652485

Based on swelling measurements, WAXS and DSC, a scenario of these mechanisms is proposed. Our results show that the crosslinking reactions are far from being complete at the end of the vulcanization process. During TO aging carried out at a moderate temperature 77 degrees C (350 K), the creation of long bridges first takes place via the consumption of residual sulfur; this mechanism is mainly responsible of the increase in the density of elastically active chains. The presence of residual antioxidants inhibits in the early stages of aging the chemical reactions involving oxygen. For longer aging time (here 7 days), these reactions can then occur and create "unidentified" bridges whose formation may also involves sulfur grafted onto the polymer chains. Finally, all these cross-linking reactions seem to enhance the heterogeneity of the spatial distribution of the crosslinks - already existing in the initial material - and to create highly crosslinked domains.

Here we employ SACs to address the fundamental catalytic challenge of generating well-defined active metal centers to elucidate their interactions with coordinating atoms, which define their catalytic performance. We introduce a soft-landing molecular strategy for tailored SACs based on metal phthalocyanines (MPcs, M = Ni, Co, Fe) on graphene oxide (GO) layers to generate well-defined model targets for mechanistic studies. The formation of electronic channels through pi-pi conjugation with the graphene sheets enhances the MPc-GO performance in both oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER and ORR). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations unravel that the outstanding ORR activity of FePc-GO among the series is due to the high affinity of Fe atoms toward O-2 species. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy and DFT studies demonstrate that the OER performance of the catalysts relates to thermodynamic or kinetic control at low- or high-potential ranges, respectively. We furthermore provide evidence that the participation of ligating N and C atoms around the metal centers provides a wider selection of active OER sites for both NiPc-GO and CoPc-GO. Our strategy promotes the understanding of coordination-activity relationships of high-performance SACs and their optimization for different processes through tailored combinations of metal centers and suitable ligand environments.									46	3	0	0	4	0	46			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000586793400079	33048543

After oxygen evolution, all of the Fe-Ni alloys formed a passivation film consisting of an outer Fe2O3 layer, an intermediate Fe3O4 layer, and an inner FeO layer. Because of the outward diffusions of nickel ions, a NiO layer formed in the passivation film when the 43Fe-57Ni alloy was passivated by O2. A solid-state reaction between Fe2O3 and NiO led to the formation of NiFe2O4 in the passivation film, which greatly promoted its corrosion resistance to the molten fluoride salts.

In this work, the self-supporting NiFe layered double hydroxides (NiFe LDHs) "nanoflower" cluster OER electrode directly grown on the surface of nickel fiber felt (Ni fiber) was synthesized by a one-step impregnation at ambient pressure and temperature. The self-supporting NiFe LDHs/Ni fiber electrode showed excellent activity and stability in a three-electrode system and as the anode of AEMWE. In a three-electrode system, the NiFe LDHs/Ni fiber electrode showed excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 208 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. The NiFe LDHs/Ni fiber electrode was used as the anode of the AEMWE, showing high cell performance with a current density of 0.5 A cm(-2) at 1.68 V and a stability test for 200 h in 1 M KOH at 70 degrees C. The electrocatalytic performance of NiFe LDHs/Ni fiber electrode is due to the special morphological structure of "nanoflower" cluster petals stretching outward to produce the "tip effect," which is beneficial for the exposure of active sites at the edge and mass transfer under high current density. The experimental results show that the NiFe LDHs/Ni fiber electrode synthesized by the one-step impregnation method has the advantages of good activity and low cost, and it is promising for industrial application.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1996-1073		WOS:000825640500001

Corrosion-induced structural and morphological changes of the IrO2 (110) model electrode can be followed on the atomic scale by operando XRR and SXRD that are supplemented with ex situ scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), whereas with ICP-MS, the corrosion rate can be quantified down to 1 pg.cm(-2).s(-1) with a time resolution on the second scale. The operando synchrotron-based X-ray scattering techniques are surprisingly sensitive to Ir corrosion of about 0.10 monolayer of IrO2 (110) in similar to 26 h, i.e., 0.4 pg.cm(-2).s(-1). The present study demonstrates that single-crystalline IrO2 (110) films are much more stable than hitherto expected. Although the dissolution rate is very small, ICP-MS experiments reveal a significantly higher dissolution rate than the operando high-energy XRR/SXRD experiments. These differences in dissolution rate are suggested to be due to the different modi operandi encountered in ICP-MS (dynamic) and operando XRR/ SXRD experiments (steady state), a fact that may need to be considered when hydrogen production is coupled to intermittent energy sources such as renewables.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000709692900021

Due to the presence of ozone in the stratosphere most of the hazardous irradiation is absorbed, nonetheless UVB, UVA, and visible light reach the earth's surface. The high abundance of proteins in most living organisms, and the presence of chromophores in the side chains of certain amino acids, explain why these macromolecules are principal targets when biological systems are illuminated. Light absorption triggers the formation of excited species that can initiate photo-modification of proteins. The major pathways involve modifications derived from direct irradiation and photo-sensitized reactions. In this review we explored the basic concepts behind these photochemical pathways, with special emphasis on the photosensitized mechanisms (type 1 and type 2) leading to protein oxidation, and how this affects protein structure and functions. Finally, a description of the photochemical reactions involved in some human diseases, and medical applications of protein oxidation are presented.									10	0	0	0	9	0	10			0071-1365	1744-1358	*****************	WOS:000537063700003	31845743

Herein we report a facile approach for the fabrication of low-cost and earth abundant metal catalysts, including iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), CoNi, and CoFe nanoparticles (NPs) on titanium (Ti) substrates through a one-step electrochemical deposition. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy(FE-SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrocopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electrochemical techniques were employed to characterize these nanoparticles. Our electrochemical results revealed that among the five synthesized nanomaterials, the Ti/Co electrode exhibited the highest electrocatalytic activity toward OER in 0.1 mol·L~(-1) KOH with a current density of 10.0 mA·cm~(-2) at 0.70 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The optimized Ti/Co electrode exhibited a small overpotential (eta) of 0.43 V at 10.0 mA·cm~(-2) and a high mass activity of 105.7 A·g~(-1) with a turnover frequency (TOF) value of 1.63 * 10~(-3) s~(-1),which are comparable to the values obtained with the state-of-the-art Pt/C and RuO_2 electrocatalysts.

In addition, thin alpha-Fe2O3 films (similar to 50 nm thick) were employed as a proof of concept to show the effect of our nanostructured scaffolds during photoelectrochemical water splitting. Double-layer capacitance measurements showed a drastic increase of the relative electrochemically active surface area for the nanostructured samples, in agreement with the observed photocurrent enhancement, whereas UV vis spectroscopy indicates full absorption of visible light at wavelengths below 600 nm.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000490357900021	31523952

Currently, metal-based catalysts are the most widely studied catalysts for electrocatalytic NRR. Unfortunately, the low selectivity and poor resistance to acids and bases, and the low Faradaic efficiency, production rate, and stability of metal-based catalysts for NRR make them uncompetitive for the synthesis of ammonia in comparison to the industrial Haber-Bosch process. Inspired by applications of carbon-based metal-free catalysts (CMFCs) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), the studies of these CMFCs in electrocatalytic NRR have attracted great attention in the past year. However, due to the differences in electrocatalytic NRR, there are several critical issues that need to be addressed in order to achieve rational design of advanced carbon-based metal-free electrocatalysts to improve activity, selectivity, and stability for NRR. Herein, the recent developments in the field of carbon-based metal-free NRR catalysts are presented, along with critical issues, challenges, and perspectives concerning metal-free catalysts for electrocatalytic reduction of nitrogen for synthesis of ammonia at ambient conditions.									180	16	0	0	7	0	184			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000463970200015	30648293

Wire samples fabricated by the oxide-powder-in-tube technique were heat-treated under a variety of conditions (time, temperature, and oxygen pressure). Backscattered images taken on polished but unetched transverse cross sections were subjected to computerized image processing, which allowed determination of the stoichiometry and quantification of microstructural characteristics (such as area fraction, size distribution, position, and orientation) of each nonsuperconducting particle. The dominant nonsuperconducting phases observed by SEM/EDX were CuO, (Ca, Sr)2CuO3 (2/1), and (Ca, Sr)14Cu24O41 (14/24) in amounts that varied depending on the annealing temperature, time, and oxygen partial pressure. Time evolution studies performed at 825-degrees-C in 0.075 atm O2 showed that the area fraction of 2/1 decreased with reaction time, while that for 14/24 increased. In all cases, a substantial amount (> 10% area fraction) of nonsuperconducting phases was detected even after all the Bi2Sr2CaCu2Oy (Bi-2212) in the as-rolled composite conductor was fully converted to Bi-2223, as determined by XRD. High aspect ratio nonsuperconducting particles were initially randomly oriented in the composite conductor core but gradually aligned parallel to the silver/(Bi,Pb)-Sr-Ca-Cu-O interface after extended annealing. They tended to segregate and exhibited a much broader size distribution when processing was carried out at temperatures and oxygen partial pressures on the high end of the normal processing range, most likely as a result of the occurrence of partial melting in the system.									32	0	0	0	0	0	32			0884-2914			WOS:A1994PW30500007

Here we further study the HER mechanisms for water splitting on typical 13-atoms clusters, Al12Ga and Al-13, by first-principles DFT calculations. We noted that the doping of a Ga atom into the Al-13 cluster could reduce the transition state barrier for H2O dissociation on the metal cluster. Furthermore, it is interesting that the second water molecule prefers to adsorb on the same metal site giving rise to both thermodynamically and kinetically favorable reaction pathways. Based on the well-established complementary active sites (CAS) mechanism for metal cluster reactivity, we provide insights into the reaction dynamics of such metal clusters with two water molecules, which also sheds light on the Eley-Rideal and Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanisms in surface science. Natural bond orbitals (NBO) analysis was conducted to evaluate the donor-acceptor charge-transfer interactions between the cluster and the nucleophilic reagent. These results gain a better understanding of the mechanism for water reacting with aluminum-based materials.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000457714700020	30489009

It is necessary to combine these electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. Unfortunately, these catalysts are usually synthesized by using completely different routes and reactant precursors, which increase the cost of manufacture with tedious procedures. Herein, we demonstrate a versatile gas-regulated strategy for the preparation of two kinds of graphene-based electrocatalysts for the HER and OER, respectively, by using the same procedure with the same precursor. Specifically, the hydrothermal treatment of graphene oxide solution in the presence of thiourea and desirable metal ions leads to the formation of a three-dimensional reduced graphene oxide (rGO) hydrogel. The subsequent pyrolysis is efficient in regulating the active sites for the OER and HER, respectively, by adjusting the gas atmosphere. The N-2-regulated formation of CoFeO@N/S-rGO (CoFe2O4 encapsulated 3D N, S-doped rGO aerogel) results in good catalytic performance for the OER while the formation of CoFe@N-rGO (amorphous bimetallic CoFe encapsulated 3D N-doped rGO aerogel) in NH3 results in good HER catalytic performance. The combination of CoFe@N-rGO with CoFeO@N/S-rGO for overall water splitting in alkaline solution exhibits good catalytic activity to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low potential of 1.63 V with outstanding stability for 100 h, outperforming most of the state-of-the-art catalysts. Therefore, our gas-regulated strategy provides a promising approach to synthesize efficient electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									48	3	0	0	1	0	48			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000442385800029		
J	Christensen, PA; Dilks, A; Egerton, TA; Lawson, EJ; Temperley, J								Photocatalytic oxidation of alkyd paint films measured by FTIR analysis of UV generated carbon dioxide								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE				37	22			4901	4909		10.1023/A:1020882701724				NOV 15 2002	2002	FTIR assay of UV generated gaseous CO(2) has been used to monitor the photo-degradation of alkyd paint films in oxygen of controlled humidity. The three contributions to CO(2) evolution from such paint films are (a) a dark reaction associated with the drying process, (b) direct photochemical reaction, and (c) photocatalysis by the TiO(2) opacifier. As this paper is focused on the photocatalysis by TiO(2), the dark reaction has been minimized by accelerated drying of the paint films and the photocatalytic component has been emphasised by studying films pigmented with TiO(2) that has not been surface treated. This methodology allows the UV stability of alkyd paints to be monitored rapidly by an FTIR measurement of the UV-generated carbon dioxide. CO(2) evolution was greater for films made with high (35%) than for low (15%) TiO(2) pigment volume concentration (p. v. c.) paints. This behaviour, which parallels weight losses from similar films exposed in conventional accelerated weathering equipment, shows that photocatalysis by the TiO(2) is dominant. The CO(2) evolution rates from films opacified with different grades of rutile pigment correlate with weight loss measurements made from identical paints exposed to glass-filtered carbon arc irradiation in conventional accelerated weathering equipment. These two comparisons confirm the relevance, to conventional accelerated testing, of paint durability of the FTIR assay of carbon dioxide evolution from alkyd paints. Because the experimental procedure allows the ready interposition of suitable optical filters, the method is well suited to studies of e. g., incident wavelength & intensity. In addition, deliberate variations in the humidity of the atmosphere in the FTIR cell were monitored by using the i.r. absorption of water vapour. Not only did the observed rates of carbon dioxide evolution decrease with decreasing humidity, they extrapolated to zero at zero humidity. This is consistent with mechanisms, derived from studies of model systems, that identify hydroxyl radicals as the key catalytic intermediate in photocatalytic oxidation of TiO(2) pigmented paint.

Therefore, we rationally designed and synthesized a unique 3-dimensional (3D) structure of flower-like NiFe-layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) growing on graphene oxide (GO) with large surface area, widely-exposed active sites and good electrical conductivity, of which the weight percentage of GO in NiFe-LDH/GO was about 27.37%. Consequently, compared with pure NiFe-LDH (0.71 V (vs RHE), 95 mV dec(-1)) in alkaline electrolyte, the NiFe-LDH/GO possesses a relatively high onset potential of 0.88 V (vs RHE) and a smaller Tafel slope of 82 mV dec(-1). Impressively, the prepared optimized NiFe-LDH/GO presents a highly stability than commercial Pt/C after stability testing due to strong interaction between graphene oxide and LDHs. In view of the above properties, these composite materials have better research prospects and open up a new opportunity for rational design. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

In S. protuberans, P. tricornutum, and E. huxleyi, light-dependent variability was observed in the ratio of Phi(O2) to Phi(P), i.e. in the number of oxygen molecules produced per electron generated by PSII. The ratio Phi(O2):Phi(P) was highly variable at low light intensities (E < 0.5E(k)), and at higher light intensities (E > 0.5E(k)) Phi(O2):Phi(P) showed a nonlinear decrease with increasing light intensity. In contrast, in P. globosa, a Vend in Phi(O2):Phi(P) could not be distinguished, and this species showed a decrease in Phi(O2):Phi(P) during the day, indicating a dependency of Phi(O2):Phi(P) on light history. Additionally, considerable interspecific quantitative differences in Phi(O2):Phi(P) were observed. Two possible interpretations to explain the variability in Phi(O2):Phi(P) are discussed. Assuming that Phi(P) is a reliable measure of the quantum yield for charge separation at PSII, one interpretation is that net oxygen production is influenced by processes that consume oxygen or affect linear electron transport (e.g. cyclic electron transport around PSII, pseudocyclic electron transport in the Mehler reaction, Rubisco oxygenase activity, and light-dependent mitochondrial respiration). A second interpretation, however, suggests that at saturating light, changes in photosynthesis turnover time occur, such that Phi(P) does not predict the steady-state O-2 yield.									119	0	0	0	109	1	119			0024-3590	1939-5590		WOS:000073951900011

Herein, the three dimensional core-branch CoP@NiFe-OH nanohybrids supported on surface-phosphatized Ni foam (CoP@ NiFe-OH/SPNF) are facilely fabricated as the high-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts for alkaline water electrolysis. Theoretical calculation and electrochemical tests manifest that hybridizing CoP with NiFe-OH engenders strong synergistic catalytic effects, leading to fast hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction kinetics. Meanwhile, hierarchical core-branch arrays and self-supported architecture also result in CoP@NiFe-OH/SPNF with multiple exposing active sites, faster ions, electron transport behavior and superior lifespan. Owing to these typical merits, the bifunctional CoP@NiFe-OH/SPNF electrode expedites overall water splitting with affording a current density of 10, 50 and 100 mA cm(-2) only at 1.53, 1.63 and 1.68 V respectively, surpassing the performance of noble ( + )IrO2/C//Pt/C( - ) and most bifunctional electrocatalysts. As a practical application, a portable solar energy-driven water electrolyzer equipped with the bifunctional CoP@NiFe-OH/SPNF electrode can produce hydrogen at room temperature with a high gas evolution rate of 20.83 mu L s(-1).									59	5	0	0	5	0	60			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000480422400004

Hydrogen, with zero carbon content, is a clean and renewable energy carrier having a large energy density. It is considered as one of the most desirable alternatives to fossil fuels. Electrochemical water splitting, unlike the steam reforming process accelerating fossil fuels depletion and CO2 emissions, can produce H-2 powered by renewable energy such as solar or wind. As a promising way to promote carbon neutralization, hydrogen production by electrolysis of water is meaningful both in terms of scientific research and practical application. In order to drive electrochemical water splitting with low power consumption, efficient, durable and affordable electrocatalysts with low overpotentials are in urgent need. Therefore, this mini-review briefly introduces the current development status and mainstream obstacles of carbon-based materials used in electrochemical water splitting.

When used as a positive intercalation electrode in a lithium cell, it can store charge of up to 120 mAhg(-1) at a rate of 100 mAg(-1). However, it converts to the defect spinel LiFe5O8 on cycling. By combining results from powder X-ray diffraction, differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, electrochemical cycling, and TG-MS, it is shown that such conversion, which involved oxygen loss, is not associated with direct O-2 gas evolution but instead reaction with the electrolyte. We suggest that intercalation/ deintercalation is accompanied by the exchange of Li+ by H+ in the material and subsequent loss of H2O, thus converting LiFeO2 to the defect spinel LiFe5O8 on cycling.									61	1	0	0	4	0	62			0002-7863			WOS:000253951900068	18284239

It remains a grand challenge to identify the evolution of active sites due to the small size and complex surrounding systems. Here we adopt the PtPdCu heterostructure with many Pt crystals on the surface (h-PdCu&Pt) as a model to investigate surface reconstruction during the ethylene glycol electrocatalytic oxidation. The mismatch between the surface free energy and Gibbs free energy drives the structure reconstruction from h-PdCu&Pt to single Pt active site-tailored PdPtCu nanoframes (SAPt-PdCu NFs) during catalysis. Density functional theory calculation results reveal that the adsorption energy of ethylene glycol on h-PdCu&Pt gradually improves with the surface evolution. Moreover, SAPt-PdCu NFs show better hydrogen evolution reaction activity than h-PdCu&Pt. This discovery promotes the recognition of active sites and facilitates the design of stable catalysts with high activity for heterogeneous catalysis.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000700917700001

Electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction results indicated that the hybrid was composed of W2N nanorods and reduced graphene oxide nanosheets. Surface chemical characteristics of the hybrid were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and its electrocatalytic activities were evaluated using a rotating disk electrode measurement system. Compared to the WO3 nanorods-GO hybrid, onset potential of the W2N nanorods-rGO hybrid for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was shifted from 0.6 V to 0.71 V, and the limiting current density increased by 1.4 times, exhibiting significantly enhanced electrocatalytic performance, which rendered the W2N-rGO hybrid as a potential non-precious-metal ORR catalyst in fuel cells and metal air battery applications.

Here, through first-principles calculations, a comprehensive study has been carried out to investigate the AV(2)M (where A = Zn, Zn-2, Zn-3, Zn-4, and M = O-4, O-6, O-7, O-8, O-9 respectively) electronic, photocatalytic, and optical properties. Formation energies with a negative sign express that the final compounds from the pure elements are possible and cohesive energies revealed that compounds are energetically stable. Spin-polarized calculations are also taken into account for better approximation of the electronic properties (band structure and density of states). All layered structures show indirect bandgap for spin-up calculations in range 0.3 eV-2.4 eV, while spin-down calculations show mix trends in range 2.3 eV-3.50 eV. An appropriate band edge with large enough kinetic over-potentials of the oxygen evolution reaction (DEV > 1.244 eV) makes them potential candidates as photoanode for water splitting. ZnV2O4 is more suitable for OER as it has small kinetic overpotential as compared to the oxidation potential of water. Interestingly, all ZnVOs display a dramatically large coefficient (similar to 10(5) cm(-1)) for optical absorption.

The addition of sulphurous acid to a copper sulphate electrolyte has been studied to avoid oxygen evolution at the anode which requires a potential in excess of 2 V. In particular, the effect of different anode materials, concentration of sulphurous acid, current density, copper and sulphuric acid concentrations in the electrolyte have been investigated. Measurements of anode potential, cell voltage, current efficiency and energy consumption during the electrowinning of copper have been made using a diaphragm cell. It was found that graphite and lead coated with Ir-O-2 are better electrode materials than lead and DSA anodes and sulphurous acid can be used as anodic depolarizer.									4	0	0	0	0	0	5			0021-891X			WOS:000085285500007

ZnO NRs were grown on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) by using a low-temperature chemical solution method and were functionalized with cobalt oxide by electrochemical deposition. The electrochemical water oxidation performance of cobalt oxide functionalized ZnO NRs was studied under alkaline (pH = 10) conditions. From these studies, it is noticed that cobalt oxide functionalized ZnO NRs show electrocatalytic activity toward water oxidation with current density on the order of several mA cm(-2). Further, 30 s CoO deposited ZnO nanorods exhibited excellent galvanostatic stability at a current density of 1 mA cm(2) and potentiostatic stability at 1.25 V vs Ag/AgCl over an electrolysis period of 1 h.									36	0	0	0	3	0	36			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000370211400039	26784675

Developing new mixed phthalocyanine-porphyrin-based CMP compounds towards exploring their new functionalities and application potential is therefore of significant importance. In the present case, four ethynyl-linked mixed phthalocyanine-porphyrin-based 2D CMPs, including FePcZnPor-CMP, ZnPcFePor-CMP, FePcFePor-CMP, and ZnPcZnPor-CMP, were fabricated by utilizing a Sonogashira-Hagihara coupling reaction. A series of spectroscopic and electron microscopy methods confirmed the successful fabrication of the as-prepared CMPs with alternate distribution of phthalocyanine and porphyrin chromophores. The electrocatalytic activity of these CMPs for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, rotating disk electrode, and rotating ring-disk electrode tests. In alkaline media, the two FePc-containing CMPs exhibit excellent ORR catalytic activity with an E-1/2 as high as 863-866 mV, making them significantly superior to FePor-containing catalyst ZnPcFePor-CMP and comparable to commercial Pt/C. On the basis of the experimental results and theoretical calculations, the significantly higher ORR performance of the two FePc-containing CMPs than the FePor-containing catalyst ZnPcFePor-CMP originates from the stronger coordination field of the phthalocyanine macrocyclic ligand than porphyrin, which is more favorable for stabilizing Fe2+ species.									51	4	1	0	1	0	51			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000451738200049

A kinetic approach to propagation and stability of detonation waves								AIP Conference Proceedings				1084				45	50		10.1063/1.3076522				2008	2008	The problem of the steady propagation and linear stability of a detonation wave is formulated in the kinetic frame for a quaternary gas mixture in which a reversible bimolecular reaction takes place. The reactive Euler equations and related Rankine-Hugoniot conditions are deduced from the mesoscopic description of the process. The steady propagation problem is solved for a Zeldovich, von Neuman and Doering (ZND) wave, providing the detonation profiles and the wave thickness for different overdrive degrees. The one-dimensional stability of such detonation wave is then studied in terms of an initial value problem coupled with an acoustic radiation condition at the equilibrium final state. The stability equations and their initial data are deduced from the linearized reactive Euler equations and related Rankine-Hugoniot conditions through a normal mode analysis referred to the complex disturbances of the steady state variables. Some numerical simulations for an elementary reaction of the hydrogen-oxygen chain are proposed in order to describe the time and space evolution of the instabilities induced by the shock front perturbation.

Water oxidation at BDD electrodes is known to produce reactive oxygen species, but the discharged and surface chemistries involved in these processes have not been studied in depth. Here, we present scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) studies of electrogenerated intermediates and products formed on sp(2) carbon-containing BDD electrodes that display stark differences in their reactivity as a function of electrolyte type and pH during water oxidation. The most reactive and abundant species discharged from the electrode were observed at pH 11 in sulfate electrolyte. With the surface interrogation mode of SECM, two kinetically distinct surface intermediates were clearly distinguished, with one forming two orders of magnitude faster than the other but displaying a slower desorption rate. The surface coverage of these species was estimated in the range of 4-7x10(-5) mol/cm(2) for the first, and 3-4.4x10(-5) mol/cm(2) for the second one. SECM imaging suggested that regions of increased product evolution have decreased electron transfer kinetics and limited surface sites for intermediate binding. This work establishes methods for studying highly reactive intermediates found in BDD and paves the way for the inspection of other interfaces where solvolysis impacts their reactivity and evolution.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2196-0216			WOS:000475512500035		
J	Zhang, Miao; Frei, Heinz								Towards a Molecular Level Understanding of the Multi-Electron Catalysis of Water Oxidation on Metal Oxide Surfaces								CATALYSIS LETTERS				145	1			420	435		10.1007/s10562-014-1437-8				JAN 2015	2015	Earth abundant metal oxides play a central role as catalysts in the essential chemical transformations of sunlight to fuel conversion, which are the oxidation of water and the reduction of carbon dioxide. The rapidly growing interest in renewable fuel generation by using the energy of the sun has recently led to substantial breakthroughs in the use of first row transition metal oxides as catalysts for oxygen evolution from water. Substantive improvements of rates and lowering of overpotentials have been achieved by exploiting materials properties on the nanoscale, or taking advantage of the synergy of multiple metals. Moreover, knowledge derived from mechanistic investigations with structure specific spectroscopy is accelerating efficiency improvements. Monitoring by time-resolved FT-infrared spectroscopy reveals the molecular nature of active sites, while in situ X-ray and optical spectroscopy under reaction conditions provides insights into the electronic structure of the surface metal centers participating in the catalysis. By combining the bond specificity of vibrational spectroscopy with the metal electronic structure specificity of optical, X-ray absorption or photoelectron spectroscopy, a complete understanding of active surface sites on metal oxides begins to emerge. Charge flow driving the chemical transformations probed by optical spectroscopy across time scales from ultrafast to very slow reveals the processes that control the productive use of charges delivered to the catalyst. Coupling of the water oxidation catalysis at a metal oxide catalyst with carbon dioxide reduction at a heterobinuclear chromophore, which is the goal of the artificial photosystem approach, is demonstrated by a well-defined all-inorganic polynuclear unit..									32	1	0	0	8	0	32			1011-372X	1572-879X		WOS:000347717000022

With the increase of working pressure the overpotential in 100 mA center dot cm(-2) changed from 780 mV at 1.0 Pa to 330 mV at 4.0 Pa. At the same time the Tafel slop also decreased dramatically from 71 mV center dot dec(-1) to 53 mV center dot dec(-1). Then by further analysis of EDX, XRD, XPS, SEM, we found that the crystallinity and the effective reactive surface area, especially the content of Ni3+, all can affect the catalytic properties. Lastly, we studied the transmittance of Fe:NiOx, film in the range of visible light. But as the anode catalytic film, the transmittance of Fe:NiOx, film is poor, especially with the increase of depth.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1000-6818			WOS:000236122300015

In order to reach the desired transition state and to overcome the kinetic barrier, elevated temperatures or electrical potentials are employed to increase the rate of reaction. Despite immense efforts in the last decades, research in thermo- and electrocatalysis has often preceded in isolation, even for similar reactions. Conceptually, any heterogeneous surface process that involves changes in oxidation states, redox processes, adsorption of charged species (even as spectators) or heterolytic cleavage of small molecules should be thought of as having parallels with electrochemical processes occurring at electrified interfaces. Herein, we compare current trends in thermo- and electrocatalysis and elaborate on the commonalities and differences between both research fields, with a specific focus on the production of hydrogen peroxide as case study. We hope that interlinking both fields will be inspiring and thought-provoking, eventually creating synergies and leverage towards more efficient decentralized chemical conversion processes.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2041-1723		WOS:000783759500011	35418132

BiVO4 thin films were successfully prepared through electrodeposition of Bi film on the FTO glass substrate from the aqueous bath containing Bi(NO3)(3) in presence of K-Na-tartrate and dextrose; followed by thermo-chemical reaction with an aqueous solution of vanadium acetylacetonate (VO(acac) 2). XRD & SEM-EDS analyses indicated the formation of scheelite monoclinic BiVO4 with seed-like morphology. UV-visible absorption spectra measured the band gap energy similar to 2.3 eV indicating visible-light activity of the photocatalyst and the Mott-Schottky analysis showed n-type nature of the semiconductor. Highest photocurrent of 1.3 mA cm(-2) (at similar to 1 V vs Ag/AgCl) for water oxidation and 2 mA cm(-2) (at similar to 0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl) for sacrificial (SO32-) oxidation were measured under 35 mW cm-2 illumination using the optimized thin film and the maximum incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of 42% was obtained. The enhanced photocurrent in solar-assisted water oxidation is attributed to the formation of well covered and compact film with improved electrical continuity, shown by minimum charge transfer resistance. Adsorption of an optimized amount of Co2+ over the BiVO4 improves its catalytic properties towards oxygen evolution reaction by approximately 2.5 times, with lowering of charge transfer resistance of the material as measured through impedance analysis.									13	0	0	0	3	0	13			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000477652900111

Herein, we report one-step synthesis of sulfur, nitrogen and Au-doped carbon quantum dots (Au-SCQDs) and strong enhancement of fluorescence intensity and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activity of amorphous Co(OH)(2) nanoparticles compared to pure Co(OH)(2) as well as commercial RuO2 and Pt/C catalysts. Au doping into sulfur and nitrogen co-doped CQDs showed over seventy times enhanced fluorescence. OER studies of amorphous-Co(OH)(2) incorporated Au-SCQDs produced current density of 178 mA cm(-2) at the applied potential of 2.07 V whereas un-doped Co(OH)(2) showed current density of 59 mA cm(-2). To produce geometric current density of 10 mA cm(-2), amorphous Co(OH)(2)-Au-SCQDs (CSA) required 388-456 mV overpotential depending on the Au ion concentration used for preparing the Au-SCQDs, which is equal to or lower than overpotential required by commercial electrocatalysts. The strongly enhanced OER activity of Co(OH)(2)-Au-SCQDs (CSA) was attributed to the presence of electronegative metallic conducting Au atoms along with the high catalytic surface area of amorphous Co(OH)(2). The present studies demonstrate a new method of exploiting amorphous Co(OH)(2)NPs electrocatalysts that could provide more catalytically active sites by integrating an electronegative conducting Au atom doped SCQDs matrix.									11	1	0	0	2	0	11			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000451074200033

Various NP shapes (cubes, cuboctahedra, and octahedra) in the 6-8 nm range were synthesized using colloidal methods with PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone) as a capping ligand and Ag+ for structure direction. Solid-state C-13 NMR of PVP-NP interactions, as well as electrochemical measurements of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, revealed that submonolayer levels of Ag significantly modify both the physical and electronic structure of the Pt NP surface. Octahedral NP catalysts with 0.5 monolayers of Ag were found to be highly selective for C2H2-to-C2H4 hydrogenation (C2H4/C2H6 >8) at reaction rates comparable to total hydrogenation on pure Pt. Traditionally prepared PtAg catalysts synthesized via incipient wetness showed analogously high selectivities but lower site time yields compared to NPs. In contrast, total hydrogenation was observed for Pt, Pd, and PdAg catalysts under the H-2-rich reaction conditions used. Surface Ag, rather than nanoparticle shape or faceting, was found to be responsible for high selectivity in the PtAg case. This work demonstrates that bimetallic systems with inherent phase segregation (e.g., PtAg) offer a unique route toward thermally stable surface compositions that can promote high activity and selectivity over a large operating window.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1932-7447			WOS:000305356200076

A novel functional lead-based anode (MnO2 pre-coated anode-MPA) was precisely fabricated and its long-term performances were studied compared with typical Pb-1%Ag anode (TPA). Results indicated that MPA posed excellent effects on synergistic inhibiting lead dissolution and reducing hazardous pollutants generation, and decreasing the lead content of zinc products by 81%. Further, the underlying mechanism of film growth and transformation in structure, composition and crystal phase, the migration and distribution of lead and anode slime during electrolytic, were clarified in-depth. Dynamic material flow analysis confirmed that MPA reduced the entire lead migration amount by over 92% compared with TPA. The compact multilayer structure of the MPA film and self-reparation effects of local structure provided better and persistent protection for the lead matrix, which greatly retarded the high-speed corrosion of lead anode. Compared with alpha-MnO2 in TPA, the formation and maintenance of gamma-MnO2 in MPA accelerated the oxygen evolution reaction and inhibited the anode slime generation. This finding provides new insights in pollution precaution and control by designing and tuning new functional anode in hydrometallurgy process.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000620460000001	33373954

In this work, we designed marigold flower-shaped Ni(3)V(2)O(8)structures by simple and facile thermal decay of Ni(ii) 8-hydroxyquinoline and VO(ii) 8-hydroxyquinoline molecular precursors using a universal and green solvent, water. The marigold flower-shaped structure of Ni(3)V(2)O(8)was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Finally, we tested these marigold flower-shaped Ni(3)V(2)O(8)structures for their electrochemical performance, such as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The results demonstrated that the marigold flower-shaped Ni(3)V(2)O(8)structure has superior catalytic activity (overpotential of 328 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)and a Tafel slope of 61 mV dec(-1)) compared with a physical mixture of V(2)O(5)and NiO (overpotential of 496 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)and a Tafel slope of 158 mV dec(-1)), pure NiO (overpotential of 553 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)and a Tafel slope of 205 mV dec(-1)) or V2O5(overpotential of 668 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)and a Tafel slope of 314 mV dec(-1)) in alkaline medium. This higher OER activity of the marigold flower-shaped Ni(3)V(2)O(8)structure strengthens its adoption as a potential candidate in the field of energy storage and conversion systems.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000550065200037

Herein, an investigation of multimetallic Ni0.6Co0.2Fe0.2 OER activity, coupled with in-situ Raman spectroscopy to track dynamic structure changes, was carried out and compared to other Ni catalysts. The effect of KOH concentration, KOH purity, ionomer type, and electrolyte with organic cations was evaluated. The Ni0.6Co0.2Fe0.2 catalyst achieved 10 mA/cm2 at 260 mV overpotential with stability over 50 h and 5000 cycles in 1 M KOH. In-situ Raman spectroscopy showed that Ni0.6Co0.2Fe0.2 activity originates from promoting Ni(OH)2/NiOOH transformation at low potentials compared to biand mono-metallic nickel-based catalysts. Fumion anion ionomer in the catalyst inks led to a lower OER activity than catalysts with inks containing Nafion ionomer.

J	Chen, Liangzhou; Qi, Xuyao; Tang, Jie; Xin, Haihui; Liang, Zhongqiu								Reaction pathways and cyclic chain model of free radicals during coal spontaneous combustion								FUEL				293						120436	10.1016/j.fuel.2021.120436		FEB 2021		JUN 1 2021	2021	Reactions of free radicals play essential roles in the evolution of the spontaneous combustion of coal. However, their elementary reaction pathways and details during this process have not been revealed by far. This paper established reaction pathways of free radicals during coal spontaneous combustion based on typical active free radicals by quantum chemistry method. The specific structural parameters and thermodynamic data for reactions (R1 similar to R9) are calculated to reveal the reaction process. The cyclic model of free radicals during coal self-heating has been proposed for the first time. The results indicate that most of the reactions involved in free radicals are exothermic reactions with heat release ranging from 7.568 similar to 167.113 kJ/mol. The initial reactions (R1 and R2) can accumulate heat and generate active peroxide free radical (R-O-O-center dot) as well as hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot). Both of them can occur easily at the normal temperature. The heat release increases the ambient temperature, which causes non-spontaneous reactions to proceed successively. The decomposition of peroxide free radicals triggers the reaction pathways of the cyclic model. The hydroxyl radical can lead to the reaction with active sites in coal, which can accumulate plenty of heat and supply the R-center dot for initiating reaction R(1) in the cycle. Both hydroxyl radicals and hydrocarbon radicals play vital roles in consuming active groups in coal and oxygen continuously. The results demonstrate that to fundamentally prevent coal spontaneous combustion, it is necessary to eliminate the key active free radicals (R-center dot, R-O-O-center dot, and (OH)-O-center dot) to terminate the cyclic chain reaction.									22	1	0	0	0	0	23			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000640515600053

In searching of non-noble and advanced electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), here we highlight a new and advanced catalyst, selenized Cu3Sn@Cu foam, with overwhelming activity for OER under both alkaline (1 M KOH) and near-neutral (1 M NaHCO3) conditions. The catalysts were prepared by a double hydrothermal treatment where Cu3Sn is first formed which further underwent for second hydrothermal condition for selenization. For comparison, Cu7Se4@Cu foam was prepared by a hydrothermal treatment under the same protocol. The as-formed Cu3Sn@Cu foam, selenized Cu3Sn@Cu foam, and Cu7Se4@Cu foam were utilized as electrocatalysts and showed their potentiality in terms of activity and stability. In 1 M KOH, for attaining the benchmarking current density of 50 mA cm-2, selenized Cu3Sn@Cu foam required a low overpotential of 384 mV and increased charge transfer kinetics with a lower Tafel slope value of 177 mV/dec comparing Cu3Sn@Cu foam, Cu7Se4@Cu foam, and pristine Cu foam. Furthermore, potentiostatic analysis (PSTAT) was carried out for 40 h for selenized Cu3Sn@Cu foam and with minimum degradation in activity assured the long-term application for hydrogen generation. Similarly, under neutral condition selenized Cu3Sn@Cu foam also delivered better activity trend at higher overpotentials in comparison with others. Therefore, the assistance of both Sn and Se in Cu foam ensured better activity and stability in comparison with only selenized Cu foam. With these possible outcomes, it can also be combined with other active, non-noble elements for enriched hydrogen generation in future.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000475838000068	31247824

The focus was on the evolution of internal-oxide volume fraction during the initial stage of oxidation. An equation to calculate f (v) (*) was developed by considering an effective diffusion coefficient of oxygen in the alloy (D (O) (eff) ) which takes into account the evolving blocking effect by forming internal oxide precipitates. Based on this physical process, three types of oxidation behavior can result, depending on the properties of the alloy and exposure atmosphere. Further discussions on the remaining discrepancy between predicted and experimentally-determined f (v) (*) values are provided for refinement on the theoretical prediction of this parameter.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			0030-770X	1573-4889		WOS:000350663900001

Highly active photocatalyst BixTiyVx O4x+2y (x ap y) for oxygen evolution under visible-light illumination								Physica Status Solidi B				245	9			1807	15		10.1002/pssb.200879535				Sept. 2008	2008	A coupled TiO2-BiVO4 system, BixTiyVx O4x+2y (x ap y), with modified TiO2 and BiVO4 crystals through their interaction, was prepared in the form of powder by solid-state reaction under the concept of combining properties of active photocatalysts. Experiments of photocatalytic oxygen evolution from an aqueous powder suspension under visible-light irradiation (lambda ges 420 nm) have shown that BixTiyVx O4x+2y (x ap y) exhibits activity much higher than that of BiVO4, which is known as one of the most active visible-light-responsive photocatalysts, indicating the effectiveness of the interaction and the modification of TiO2 and BiVO4. XRD experiments showed that BixTiyVx O4x+2y (x ap y) was composed of BiVO4 and TiO2 crystals slightly modified probably by partial exchange of V5+ and Ti4+ ions. Photocurrent vs. wavelength for a particulate BixTiyVx O4x+2y (x ap y) film electrode demonstrated several components, in agreement with the conclusion that BixTiyVx O4x+2y (x ap y) consisted of modified BiVO4 and TiO2 crystals. A possible band model was tentatively proposed to explain observed characteristics such as photocurrent density (j) vs. potential (U), j vs. illumination wavelength (lambda), the U dependence of j vs. lambda, and the effect of the addition of a reductant such as I-, MeOH, SCN- and Br- on j vs. U and j vs. lambda.

In a medium which is largely HClO4 the rate of reduction of Ce(IV) is diffusion-controlled, depends directly upon the catalyst concentration and has an activation energy of 11 +/- 2 kJ mol-1. Increasing the concentration of sulphate decreases the rate of catalysis and the kinetics appear to be neither simple first-order or second-order with respect to [Ce(IV)], and this also appears to be the case in a kinetic study carried out in 0. 5 mol dm-3 H2SO4. The kinetics of O2 catalysis in all the different acid media used are readily interpreted using an electrochemical model in which the catalyst particles are considered as acting as microelectrodes which mediate electron transfer between a Nernstian reduction reaction (Ce(IV) --> Ce(III)) and an irreversible oxidation reaction (H2O --> 2H+ + 1/2 O2). Using this electrochemical model to interpret the observed complex kinetics in 0.5 mol dm-3 H2SO4 it is possible to extract mechanistic information concerning the nature of the rate-determining step in the oxidation of water on Ru-Adams and, using data arising from a temperature variation study, to estimate a value of 49 +/- 1 kJ mol-1 for the activation energy for water oxidation with the microelectrodes of Ru-Adams poised at a calculated mixture potential of 1.40 V vs. nhe.

In the presence of glucose, NaCl-template can efficiently tune the porous structure of catalyst and help to improve the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. The optimized catalyst possesses a hierarchical mesopore size distribution, a high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area (up to 911.56 m(2) g(-1)) and homogeneous distribution of abundant active sites. As a result, the obtained catalyst shows a desirable ORR activity in alkaline medium (half-wave potential of 0.84 V and kinetic mass activity at 0.8 V of 24.95 A g(-1)), high selectivity (electron transfer number >3.92), excellent long term durability (only 16 mV negative shift of half-wave potential after 5000 potential cycles in O-2-saturated 0.1 M KOH) and good tolerance to methanol. The enhanced electrochemical performance enables the proposed catalyst to be the promising electrocatalyst candidate to commercial Pt/C towards ORR. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

In the present study, Ni<INF>x</INF>Fe<INF>y</INF>Mo<INF>z</INF> layered double hydroxide (LDH) electrocatalysts fabricated via a simple hydrothermal technique for overall water splitting in an alkaline medium are reported. The best-performing Ni<INF>x</INF>Fe<INF>y</INF>Mo<INF>z</INF> LDH catalysts require overpotentials of 200 and 86 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm<SUP>-2</SUP> for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. Theoretical analysis indicates that the Mo-rich O<INF>Mo<INF>2</INF>Fe</INF> and Fe-rich O<INF>Fe<INF>3</INF></INF> active sites strongly activate the HER and OER, respectively. More importantly, a water electrolyzer containing the best-performing Ni<INF>x</INF>Fe<INF>y</INF>Mo<INF>z</INF> LDH catalysts as the anode and cathode is able to reach an industrially relevant current density of 1000 mA cm<SUP>-2</SUP> at a cell voltage of only 2.1 V. The electrolyzer exhibits outstanding stability at very high current densities of 0.1, 0.5 and 1 A cm<SUP>-2</SUP> for overall water splitting over 90 hours of continuous operation, which is superior to state-of-the-art devices based on precious metals. The overall water-splitting activity presented here demonstrates the practical potential of the proposed electrocatalysts as inexpensive options for use in water electrolyzers.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000850523300001

Four compositions of RuO2-TiO2 coatings were applied to Ti substrates by three different wet coating methods-brush, dip and spin. Changing the coating technique resulted in different morphologies. Electrochemically active surface area of the coatings was related to the morphology. A shift in Ru(III)/Ru(IV) oxidation potential occurred upon changing the application technique. For lower ruthenium content coatings, this shift was related to coating lifetime. Anode stability in accelerated lifetesting showed that dip coated samples lasted up to three times longer than brush coated samples for lower ruthenium content.									25	2	1	0	3	0	26			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000268729700014

On the one hand, the BP QDs possess large surface areas and abundant active sites, offering fairly high electrocatalytic activity. On the other hand, the MXene nanosheets serve as a 2D substrate to confine the BP QDs, preventing them from aggregation and, thus, electrolyte inaccessibility. They can further provide excellent electronic conductivity and superior structural robustness. The BP QDs, in turn, act as a spacer to isolate the nanosheets from restacking, thus preserving the active sites from being lost. The resulting BP QDs/MXene nanohybrids, as a bifunctional electrocatalyst, exhibit remarkable synergy in both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER) in alkaline media. Specifically, an overpotential of 360 mV (vs. RHE) and a Tafel slope of 64.3 mV dec(-1) are achieved for the OER, and an overpotential of 190 mV (vs. RHE) and a Tafel slope of 83.0 mV dec(-1) for the HER in 1.0 M KOH solution are achieved. These values are significantly lower than those of their components (BP QDs and MXene nanosheets) and even approach those of commercialized RuO2 or Pt/C. When the BP QDs/MXene nanohybrids are employed as both the cathode and anode in a full cell for overall water splitting, a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is quickly reached at a potential of only 1.78 V. Additionally, the underlying mechanism of the superior electrocatalytic performance of the BP QDs/MXene nanohybrids is fundamentally explored by density functional theory calculations.									109	8	0	0	2	0	109			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000449701900002

Amorphous TiO2 deposited by atomic-layer deposition (ALD) onto various n-type semiconductors (Si, GaAs, GaP, and CdTe) and coated with thin films or islands of Ni produces efficient, stable photoanodes for water oxidation, with the TiO2 films protecting the underlying semiconductor from photocorrosion in pH = 14 KOH(aq). The links between the electronic properties of the TiO2 in these electrodes and the structure and energetic defect states of the material are not yet well-elucidated. We show herein that TiO2 films with a variety of crystal structures and midgap defect state distributions, deposited using both ALD and sputtering, form rectifying junctions with n-Si and are highly conductive toward photogenerated carriers in n-Si/TiO2/Ni photoanodes. Moreover, the photovoltage of these electrodes can be modified by annealing the TiO2 in reducing or oxidizing environments. All of the polycrystalline TiO2 films with compact grain boundaries investigated herein protected the n-Si photoanodes against photocorrosion in pH = 14 KOH(aq). Hence, in these devices, conduction through the TiO2 layer is neither specific to a particular amorphous or crystalline structure nor determined wholly by a particular extrinsic dopant impurity. The coupled structural and energetic properties of TiO2, and potentially other protective oxides, can therefore be controlled to yield optimized photoelectrode performance.									98	1	0	0	3	0	97			1944-8244			WOS:000358558300011	26083827

In this study, we investigated the photoaging behavior of polymeric colloidal photonic crystal films. As a consequence of photochemical reactions containing chain-scission, photoaging induced morphological changes in the film surface including changes in the size, surface roughness, shape, and packing structure of PS particles. These structural modifications came about the deterioration of optical properties (photonic bandgap) during photoaging. Based on our results and observations, a plausible correlation between the evolutions of the optical properties and the structural modifications during photoaging was established. Finally, the compositional modifications of the surface based on oxygen incorporation behavior caused by the photooxidation process are discussed based on the ATR-FTIR and XPS analyses.

During the first month, a decrease of dissolved oxygen was observed for both PET and glass bottles. A strong degradation of ascorbic acid was noted after 3 months of storage (up to 54 at 72% in glass and PET bottles respectively) and the beta-carotene content was virtually nil after 80 days. The ascorbic acid degradation was clearly stronger in PET comparing to glass bottles while no difference was observed for beta-carotene between both packaging. However, beta-carotene isomers (13-cis-beta-carotene and 9-cis-beta-carotene) were identified and their total concentrations were higher in glass bottles. The degradation reaction scheme of beta-carotene seems to be mainly oxidation in PET bottles and isomerisation and then oxidation in glass bottles. Concerning tocopherol, its limited oxidation may be explained by regenerative action of ascorbic acid.From a nutritional point of view, the juice packed in glass bottles is more interesting since beta-carotene isomers still have pro-vitamin activity.

Herein, a strategy for surface-mounting NP/NiCo MOF thin films on Carbon nanohorn (CNH) by controlled pyrolysis is developed. CNH is introduced to improve the conductivity and structure stability of MOF and polydopamine (PDA) is used to bond each other, resulting in CNH@PDA@MOF. Compared with CoMOF@PDA@CNH, the introduction of Ni helps to waken the bonding between the metal center (Co) and the coordination solvent and expose more unsaturated coordination centers and in turn the catalytic activity. As a result of synergistic effect on geometric and electronic structure of bimetallic center Ni and Co codes in MOF, Ni1Co4MOF@PDA@CNH shows the best catalytic activity and was further used as both the source of the framework structure and the precursor of active NP derivatives. By partial pyrolysis of MOF, the active NP/MOF/CNH can be successfully obtained at 400 degrees C. The hierarchically structured NP/MOF/CNH as a synergistic electrocatalyst shows excellent activity (216 mV/cm(2) at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2)), exceeding most previously reported bi-metallic catalysts. Obviously, the combination of NiCo NPs, partially degraded MOF and CNH makes an improvement in the increase of active species, promotion of water adsorption, and electron transfer. This universal and productive method grappling conductive active sites/porous MOF on CNH plays an important role in construction of synergistic electrocatalysts for OER. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Layered double hydroxide (LDH) has many properties such as memory effect, nice catalysis ability, anion exchange, acid-base and thermal stability, which has been widely concerned in various fields to solve the above problems. LDH has excellent performance for oxygen evolution electrocatalysis, low cost, adjustable structure. The intercalation reaction can be carried out between layers of LDH. However, the poor electron conductivity of LDH reduces its electrochemical performance. Moreover, the LDH layers are easy to agglomerate in the synthesis process, resulting low conductivity and low catalytic activity. These problems can be solved by improving the synthesis method of LDH and compounding LDH with various functional materials. In recent years, in order to improve the conductivity of LDH, researchers have in situ grown LDH on various conductive substrate, which can expose more active sites and as a result improve the catalytic activity of LDHs. By compounding LDH with graphene, the specific capacitance, conductivity and cycle stability of LDH/graphene composites can be enhanced, and the adsorption capacity of LDH for CO_2 can also be improved, making LDH widely used to solve energy crisis and environmental pollution problems. This article reviews the synthesis methods of LDH and LDH composites, and summarizes the applications of LDH and its composites in catalysis, energy storage, and environmental protection in recent years. First, the application of LDH in electrocatalytic water oxidation and photocatalysis is introduced, and then the application of LDH materials in supercapacitors and environmental problems such as water pollution treatment is described.			随着社会经济的发展,能源短缺和环境污染问题越来越显著,探索电解水获得氢能、超级电容器的研究和水中污染物离子的处理逐渐受到人们的广泛关注。电催化分解水制氢需要高效的电催化剂,超级电容器需要具有优异电化学性能的电极材料,水中有毒污染离子的去除也需要高效低廉的吸附剂。而层状双金属氢氧化物(LDH)体现出多方面的特性,如记忆效应、良好的催化性能、阴离子交换性、酸碱性以及热稳定性等,有望用于解决上述问题。 LDH具有优异的性能,而且成本较低,组成结构可调控,层间可以进行插层反应。然而,LDH的电子传输能力差,会降低其电化学性能;在合成时易团聚,电导率低且催化活性也不高。LDH的制备方法多种多样,可通过改进LDH的合成方法,将LDH和各种功能材料进行复合来解决这些问题。近年来,研究者们将LDH原位生长在各种导电载体上,以提高LDH的导电性;开发纳米合成技术,将合成的LDH剥离出纳米片或直接在导电基上垂直定向生长出二维LDH纳米片,使有利于催化反应的活性位点大量暴露在材料表面,从而提高其催化活性;将LDH与石墨烯复合,使超级电容器电极材料的比电容增大,导电性和循环稳定性增强,并且还可以提升LDH对CO_2的吸附能力,使LDH广泛用于解决能源危机和环境污染问题。本文综述了几种LDH的制备方法及其复合材料的合成方法,归纳了LDH及其复合材料近年来在催化、储能以及环境保护中的应用。对LDH在电催化水氧化和光催化方面的应用分别做了介绍,然后阐述了LDH材料在超级电容器和处理水体污染等环境问题方面的应用。						2	1	0	0	0	0	2			1005-023X			CSCD:7101515

By taking advantage of the enhanced conductivity, high dispersity, high surface area, and unique hollow morphology derived from the GO-wrapped protecting annealing strategy, the as-synthesized h-Co3O4@rGO composite not only exhibits a reversible capacity as high as 1154.2 mAh g(-1) at 500 mA g(-1) after 100 cycles and high rate performance (746 mAh g(-1) at 3000 mA g(-1)) but also displays superior OER performance with an overpotential of 300 mV to obtain 10 mA cm(-2).									25	0	0	0	1	0	25			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000443923700024	30137974

Hence, an uncomplicated vopor-polymerization strategy is used to obtain a novel sample of carbon-rich holey few-layer CN nanosheet with large domain size (S-ACN) using the oxygen in-situ regulation. Interestingly, the same preparation strategy synthesizes the carbonrich amorphous hollow-cubic CN materials (S-NCN) without the oxygen in-situ regulation. Consequently, the optimized S-ACN exhibits marked improvement in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, by nearly 21.8 times compared with the bulk CN (ACN). The carbon-rich S-ACN with few-layer structures and copious in-plane holes displays an excellent photocatalytic activity due to the unique structural advantages for the synergistic effect of light absorption, abundant active sites, and efficient separation of photoproduced electron-hole pairs. It is a green and facile strategy for the fabrication of large-size holey few-layer nanosheets for the other transformations including organic synthesis process, environmental remediation, and CO2 reduction.					3rd International Symposium on Energy and Environmental Photocatalytic Materials (EEPM3)3rd International Symposium on Energy and Environmental Photocatalytic Materials (EEPM3)	MAY 15-19, 2018MAY 15-19, 2018		Jagiellonian Univ, Fac Chem, Krakow, POLANDJagiellonian Univ, Fac Chem, Krakow, POLAND	17	2	0	0	4	0	17			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000447744200023

The as-prepared FeCo-LDH@CoSx microtubes were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and high-angle annular dark -field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM)-EDS elemental mapping. Experiments showed that the as-obtained hollow FeCo-LDH@CoSx electrocatalyst required low overpotentials of 229, 270, and 308 mV to deliver current densities of 10, 100, and 400 mA cm(-2) in a 1 M KOH distilled water solution, respectively. Also, the as-obtained catalyst exhibited good durability in various alkaline electrolytes, including distilled water, tap water, and natural river water. In a two electrode water-splitting device with nickel foams separately coated by FeCo-LDH@CoSx and 20% Pt/C as the anode and the cathode, respectively, using distilled water as the electrolyte, voltages of 1.495, 1.600, and 1.785 V were separately required for achieving current densities of 10, 100, and 400 mA cm(-2). Simultaneously, the present two-electrode system continuously worked for 50 h at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) in various alkaline electrolytes, including distilled water, tap water, and natural river water, and no obvious voltage fluctuation was detected, implying remarkable stability. Obviously, the present FeCo-LDH@CoSx microstructure provides a catalyst selection for the OER in practical applications.									7	1	0	0	0	0	8			2574-0962			WOS:000734173900006

To enhance the structural behavior, ultrathin carbon nanosheets, apart from the present effort, deals with the supportive features of ion and mass transportation. Herein, we report a cost-effective single-step approach for in-situ fabrication of Ni-Fe-Co-based mixed metal/metal-oxides nanoparticles encapsulated in ultrathin carbon nanosheets (NFC@CNSs) via a simple pyrolysis process. At optimum conditions, it reveals notable activity with a low overpotential of 213 and 256 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) of current density and a small tafel slope of 115.1 and 61.29 mV dec(-1), for HER and OER in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. Further, the hierarchical flower-like morphology of the NFC@CNSs-700 catalyst exhibits plentiful microspores along with a wide specific S-BET surface area of 145.39 m(2) g(-1), which advantages to superior catalytic efficiency. A two-electrode system in an alkaline media can attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a fairly low applied voltage of 1.590 V for overall water splitting. The result indicates that the strong coupling between tri-metallic mixed metal/metal oxides nanoparticles and carbon nanosheets is responsible for formulating such a remarkable electrochemical performance, electronic structure, and robust stability toward overall water splitting.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2468-0230			WOS:000701750900007

The intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of an individual well-defined Co3O4 nanoparticle supported on a carbon-based nanoelectrode is determined by employing an efficient SEM-controlled robotic technique for picking and placing a single catalyst particle onto a modified carbon nanoelectrode surface. The stable nanoassembly is microscopically investigated and subsequently electrochemically characterized. The hexagonal-shaped Co3O4 nanoparticles demonstrate size-dependent electrochemical activity and exhibit very high catalytic activity with a current density of up to 11.5 A cm(-2) at 1.92 V (vs. RHE), and a turnover frequency of 532 +/- 100 s(-1) at 1.92 V (vs. RHE) towards catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000598328800001	33210797

In the results of the cathodic polarization curve, the concentration polarization due to dissolved oxygen reduction reaction correspondeds to a protection potential of OCP similar to -1.55 V However, a potential of -1.2 V in the SSRT showed little effect of atomic hydrogen evolution. Potentials less than -1.6 V are affected by atomic and molecular hydrogen. We thus concluded that the effect of atomic hydrogen predominates. Overall, the optimum corrosion protection range for SCC and hydrogen embrittlement of 5083-H112 seems to be between -0.9V and -0.7V.									19	1	0	0	0	0	19			1598-9623	2005-4149		WOS:000255485200012

Electrochemical performance of composite LSCF-SDC cathode in contact with Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 (GDC) solid electrolyte under steady state polarisation was studied employing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in 3-electrode cell configuration. The evolution of elementary steps of oxygen reduction reaction was analysed under cathodic polarisation in potentiostatic mode (up to 0.8 V) in the temperature range 650-750 degrees C. The composite LSCF-SDC cathode prepared by one-step microwave combustion route demonstrated a lower overall polarisation resistance when compared to literature reports of similar cathodes produced by other synthesis routes.									25	1	0	0	0	0	26			0955-2219	1873-619X		WOS:000459950700013

However, the higher overpotential, less catalytic sites and lower catalytic rate of precious metal electrocatalysts affect their practical application, which needs to be optimized from the aspects of structural design (e.g., specific morphology/particle size, geometric/electronic structures). In this study, we reported a high topological tri-metal phosphide of CoP@FeNiP derived from the composite structure of ZIF-67 twined on a FeNi-LDH shelled with ultrathin carbon networks (ZIF-67/FeNi-LDH) grown on a nickel foam. In the synthesis process of FeNi-LDH, the addition of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) promoted the self-assembly of the topological structure of FeNi-LDH and further nucleation of the topological structure of the ZIF-67 precursor on FeNi-LDH. Besides, CoP@FeNiP inherits the topological structure of ZIF-67/FeNi-LDH. The obtained CoP@FeNiP/NF shows superior OER performance with a low overpotential of similar to 283 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of similar to 31.8 mV dec(-1) and a conservation rate of catalytic activity of similar to 98% after 110 h of continuous electrolysis at 10 mA cm(-2). The remarkable activity of CoP@FeNiP/NF can be attributed to its unique structural features, such as the hierarchical morphology, large surface area, ultrathin carbon networks and the feature of phosphide, all of which simultaneously promote the OER process. The extraordinary catalytic activities and stability of CoP@FeNiP/NF are significant to meet the industrial requirements for bulk water electrocatalysis.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000610368100077	33410846

Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposited (PECVD) and sputtered SiO2 was used to compare the characteristic morphology with different oxide layer. With increasing the annealing temperature, the blisters are observed at the temperature of 325 degrees C in O-2 atmosphere, while no blisters are formed even at 500 degrees C in N-2 and Ar atmosphere. Hydrogen evolution analysis from PECVD SiO2 layer shows a sharp peak near 320 degrees C. From these results, we could suggest that the high gaseous pressure developed by chemical reaction between oxygen and hydrogen cause the blister formation in PECVD SiO2/Pt/PZT/Pt capacitors.					11TH International Symposium on Integrated Ferroelectrics11TH International Symposium on Integrated Ferroelectrics	MAR 07-10, 1999MAR 07-10, 1999		COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADOCOLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1058-4587			WOS:000085692100031

In this manuscript, we present two novel observations made upon monitoring light-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in aqueous solutions by WST11, a water-soluble derivative of the photosynthetic pigment Bacteriochlorophyll a (Bchl). Using a host of complementary experimental techniques including time-resolved spectroscopy at the subpicosecond to the millisecond range, ESR spectroscopy, electrochemistry, spectroelectrochemistry, oximetry, and protein mass spectroscopy, we first show that in aqueous solutions WST11 generates only superoxide (O-2(-center dot)) and hydroxyl (OH center dot) radicals with no detectable traces of singlet oxygen. Second, we show that WST11 makes a noncovalent complex with human serum albumin (HSA) and that this complex functions as a photocatalytic oxidoreductase at biologically relevant concentrations enabling approximately 15 cycles of electron transfer from the associated HSA protein to molecular oxygen in the solution. These findings rule out the paradigm that porphyrin and chlorophyll based PDT is mainly mediated by formation of singlet oxygen, particularly in vascular targeted photodynamic therapy (VTP) with sensitizers that undergo photoactivation during circulation in the plasma, like [Pd]-Bacteriopheophorbide (WST09, Tookad). At the same time, our findings open the way for new design paradigms of novel sensitizers, since O2(-center dot) and OH center dot radicals are well-recognized precursors of important pathophysiological processes that can be activated for achieving tumor eradication. Moreover, the finding that promiscuous protein scaffolds become sinks for holes and electrons when holding light-activated pigments provides a new insight to the evolution and action mechanism of natural light activated oxidoreductases (such as photosynthetic reaction centers) and new guidelines for the preparation of synthetic-light converting machineries.									110	1	0	0	52	0	113			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000268138700007	19545111

In order to understand the mechanism of its inhibitory action, we have analyzed the interaction of this toxic cation with proteins subunits of PSII submembrane fractions isolated from spinach. Our results show that Al (3+), especially above 3 mM, strongly inhibits oxygen evolution and affects the advancement of the S states of the Mn4O5Ca cluster. This inhibition was due to the release of the extrinsic polypeptides and the disorganization of the Mn4O5Ca cluster associated with the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) of PSII. This fact was accompanied by a significant decline of maximum quantum yield of PSII (F-v/F-m) together with a strong damping of the chlorophyll a fluorescence induction. The energy transfer from light harvesting antenna to reaction centers of PSII was impaired following the alteration of the light harvesting complex of photosystem II (LHCII). The latter result was revealed by the drop of chlorophyll fluorescence emission spectra at low temperature (77 K), increase of F-0 and confirmed by the native green gel electrophoresis. FTIR measurements indicated that the interaction of Al (3+) with the intrinsic and extrinsic polypeptides of PSII induces major alterations of the protein secondary structure leading to conformational changes. This was reflected by a major reduction of alpha-helix with an increase of beta-sheet and random coil structures in Al (3+)-PSII complexes. These structural changes are closely related with the functional alteration of PSII activity revealed by the inhibition of the electron transport chain of PSII.									15	0	0	0	11	0	15			1932-6203			WOS:000351880000108	25806795

In this work, electronic reconfiguration and structural optimization are simultaneously conducted to enhance the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalytic activity of Co2P nanoparticles, which were doped with Cu and confined within 2D ultrathin N,P-codoped carbon (NPC) nanosheets. Density functional theory calculations reveal that Cu doping can lead to more positive sites at the neighbouring Co site and weaken the binding force between the surface active sites and the adsorbed intermediates, while the 2D ultrathin nanosheets with Cu doped Co2P nanoparticles tightly anchored can remarkably boost the surface exposure of actives sites endowing such an architecture with efficient mass and charge transport pathways. As expected, the optimized Cu doped Co2P on 2D ultrathin N,P-codoped carbon (Cu-Co2P@2D-NPC) with 7.1% Cu doping exhibits a higher half-wave potential of 0.835 V than Pt/C (0.830 V). Meanwhile, flexible solid state ZABs assembled based on the 7.1%Cu-Co2P@2D-NPC hybrid deliver a high power density of 52.5 mW cm(-2) and 32 h stability in the flat and folded states. This promising work holds significant potential to fabricate an efficient electrocatalyst for flexible solid state ZABs and further understand the relationship between the structure and activity.									31	0	0	0	1	0	31			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000489345300017

Here, we configure the facile and single-step growth of nickel sulfide nanorods on Ni mesh (NiS/Ni) via a template-free hydrothermal approach for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and supercapacitor applications. The surface morphology of NiS was strongly affected by changing the concentration of Ni and S precursors. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) revealed the presence of NiS in the samples. Under optimized conditions, the NiS/Ni electrode displayed superior OER performance, demanding 330 mV overpotential to oxidize water at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, with a Tafel slope of 67 mV dec(-1). The material also demonstrated excellent charge storage capabilities, including specific capacitances of 1097 and 869 F g(-1) at current densities of 2 and 20 mA cm(-2), respectively. Moreover, the fabricated NiS/Ni exhibited appreciable energy and power densities (484 W h kg(-1); 0.79 Wkg(-1)). The superior OER performance and energy storage properties can be attributed to the large electrode/electrolyte interfacial area of the NiS/Ni electrode owing to the desirable nanorod-like surface morphology. This study thus presents a simple synthesis route for the preparation of highly active NiS/Ni as a potential electrode material for electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000641201400039

Herein, (Fe0.33Ni0.67)S-2 and (Fe0.33Ni0.67)S-2/reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-x% (x = 10, 20) composites, which exhibited highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic activity under alkaline conditions, were synthesized via a hydrothermal approach and following thermal treatment with sulfur powders. Benefiting from the integrated structure of (Fe0.33Ni0.67)S-2 and support of conductive graphene backbones, (Fe0.33Ni0.67)S-2/rGO-20% electrocatalyst showed the best OER activity with an overpotential of 172 mV at 10 mA center dot cm(-2) and Tafel slopes of 45 mV center dot decade(-1). The composition, phase, and surface structure of the catalyst were characterized before and after OER reaction. The results indicated that crystal phase of the catalyst was reconstructed to the amorphous crystalline features after OER, with oxidation of iron-nickel sulfide and appearance of Ni-Fe oxo/hydroxide species, which may play a crucial role in the high OER performance as the catalytic-active. Moreover, in a two-electrode system towards overall water splitting with (Fe0.33Ni0.67)S-2/rGO-20%/NF and Pt/C/NF as the anode and cathode, respectively, the catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic performance with the voltage of only 1.42 V at 10 mA center dot cm(-2).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1001-0521	1867-7185		WOS:000865213900003

It shows outstanding advantages in the unconventional preparation, doping, defect and vacancy manufacture of nano-catalytic materials, so it is widely used in the preparation and modification of all kinds of catalysts. This paper mainly reviews the research progress of low temperature plasma in the preparation and modification of oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution, hydrogen evolution and fuel oxidation catalysts, and expounds the reasons for the performance improvement of these catalysts from different angles. The challenges of low temperature plasma in the preparation and modification of nanocatalysts are summarized, such as relatively high cost, reactor amplification, material controllable preparation and so on. Finally, the development trend of plasma preparation and modification of nanocatalysts is predicted.					2020 6th International Conference on Environmental Science and Material Application2020 6th International Conference on Environmental Science and Material Application	19-20 Dec. 202019-20 Dec. 2020		Xi'an, ChinaXi'an, China	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1755-1307			INSPEC:20513650

In this study, the effect of stoichiometric variation of metals in a thiospinel i.e. NixCo3-xS4, is examined on energy generation and storage properties. Nickel- or cobalt-rich NixCo3-xS4 nanosheets were prepared by the hot injection method using single molecular precursors. The nanosheets were characterized by p-XRD, TEM, HR-TEM, EDX and XPS techniques. Nickel-rich and cobalt-rich nanosheets were tested for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions and for supercapacitance performance. It was observed that the nickel-rich NixCo3-xS4 nanosheets have superior energy storage and energy generation properties.									22	0	0	0	2	0	22			2046-2069			WOS:000437475600063	35540292

Herein, we report the chemical transformations on the water-vapor/solid interface and catalytic performance of an OER catalyst consisting of Co3O4 nanoparticles on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (Co3O4-MINCNT). Using a specially constructed electrochemical cell incorporated to the lab-based ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) to mimic operando conditions, we obtained experimental evidence for the formation of CoO(OH) as the catalytically active phase on a Co3O4-MVVCNT OER catalyst. Under water and applied potential conditions, CoO(OH) is formed, enriching the surface of Co3O4 nanoparticles with subnanometer thickness, and oxidizing H2O into O-2. However, immediately after the removal of the applied potential, the CoO(OH) phase is converted back to Co3O4. This back-conversion from CoO(OH) to Co3O4 is likely driven by locally concentrated protons (H+) in water vapor, which shows the necessity of an electrochemical bias to preserve the catalytically active phase. These results reveal the surface chemical identities of the Co3O4-MWCNT OER catalyst, which are in agreement with those obtained from in-situ APXPS studies of liquid/solid interfaces consisting of Co3O4 catalyst and disagree with those obtained from ex-situ ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) XPS. Thus, our results demonstrate the possibility of performing surface chemical analysis in simplified electrochemical systems and further reinforce the importance of performing mechanistic studies of electrochemical devices under in-situ conditions.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			1932-7447			WOS:000437811500077

However, the construction of nanocomposites with tunable coupling effects to realize synergetic effects and optimal performance remains challenging. Herein, we develop a facile strategy for the synthesis of cobalt sulfide (Co9S8) nanoparticles encapsulated in the carbon matrix from a Prussian blue analogue (PBA) through a simultaneous sulfidation and carbonization process. With an increase in the degree of carbonization, the coordinated organic ligands (C N) liberated from the PBA can be evolved as N-doped amorphous carbon (N-AC), N-doped graphitic carbon (N-GC) and N-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs), respectively, generating the tunable electronic coupling between the Co9S8 and the carbon matrix. As an example, we show that the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of such nanocomposites can be made comparable to the state-of-the-art catalytic properties of precious catalysts by optimizing the electronic coupling between the components so that electron injection from the N-doped carbon to the catalytically active site is greatly facilitated. Furthermore, the in situ formation of cobalt hydroxides on the surface of Co9S8 is also confirmed during the OER process, which might induce the interfacial effect, i.e. electron interplay, thus altering the OER catalytic activity. The current work provides new insights into the rational design of advanced hybrid nanocomposites for energy and environmental applications.									68	3	0	0	2	0	68			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000437106300017

It also has potential applications in supercapacitors and solid oxide fuel cells. However, thermodynamic properties of the compound have not been reported in the literature. The standard Gibbs energy of formation has now been determined in the temperature range from 873 to 1123 K using a solid-state cell incorporating yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) as the electrolyte, a mixture of PbO + Pb2Ru2O6.5 + Ru as the measuring electrode, and Ru + RuO2 as the reference. The design of the measuring electrode is based on a study of phase relations in the ternary system Pb-Ru-O at 1123 K. For the reaction,2PbO (ortho) + 2RuO(2) (rut) + 1/4O(2)(g) = Pb2Ru2O6.5(pyro) Delta G(r)(o)/J mol(-1) (+/- 524) = -80224 + 75.763(T/K) - 5.873(T/K)ln(T/K),the standard enthalpy of formation and standard entropy at 298.15 K are estimated from the high-temperature measurements. An oxygen potential diagram for the system Pb-Ru-O is composed based on data obtained in this study and auxiliary information from the literature.									3	0	1	0	0	0	3			0884-2914	2044-5326		WOS:000246258300008

Here we report an interesting finding that turned the nature of surface-oxidized Cu upside down in electrochemical H-2 evolution. It is commonly known that the electrochemical reactivity of a metal ion is highly sensitive to the anion to which it is coordinated in the electrolyte. In the case of Cu, when it is in the form of copper oxide, the hydrogen overvoltage is huge. Nonetheless, we found that when Cu is in coordination with Se2- ions as Cu2Se, the hydrogen overvoltage was shrunken by similar to 1 V, imparting ultralow charge transfer resistance (R-CT) that varied from 0.32 to 0.61 Omega depending on the means by which selenization was carried out. Selenization was done by two different methods. In one method, conventional stirring was employed to selenize Cu foam in a preheated NaHSe solution at 90 degrees C for 20 min. In another method, hydrothermal treatment was employed to selenize Cu foam with NaHSe solution at 120 degrees C for 1 h. The wet chemical method yielded honeycomb-like hierarchical arrays of Cu2Se sheets on Cu foam (designated as Cu2Se-ch/Cu), and the hydrothermal method yielded a uniform array of spiky rods of Cu2Se (designated as Cu2Se-ht/Cu). The HER electrocatalytic studies carried out in 0.5 M H2SO4 showed that Cu2Se-ch/Cu and Cu2Se-ht/Cu had similar kinetics, with Tafel slopes of 32 to 35 mV dec(-1), which is closer to the state-of-the-art Pt/C. Interestingly, the Cu2Se-ch/Cu delivered a total kinetic current density of -1200 mA cm(-2) when polarized up to -0.85 V vs RHE, whereas Cu2Se-ht/Cu delivered a maximum of -780 mA cm(-2) only.									29	1	0	0	4	0	30			2155-5435			WOS:000438475100004

Herein, CoP- and CoN-based porous nanocatalysts, which were in situ transformed from Co-based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67), are reported as efficient co-catalysts for photoelectrochemical water splitting and CO2 reduction. The CoP wrapped with N-doped carbon (CoP/CN) nano-electrocatalysts, with high catalytic activity and stability for both the hydrogen (HER) and oxygen (OER) evolution reactions in situ coated with TiO2 nanowires (TiO2 NWs@CoP/CN), and the p-type Si nanowires (Si NWs@CoP/CN) strikingly promoted photoelectrochemical water splitting by serving as a photoanode and a photocathode, respectively, whereas CoN wrapped with N-doped carbon (CoN/CN) nanocatalysts presented excellent electrocatalytic activity towards CO2 reduction with a low onset potential, high selectivity, and good stability. It can be noted that CoN/CN catalysts-covered p-type Si nanowires (Si NWs@CoN/CN) also displayed high photoelectrochemical performance for CO2 reduction. The superior photoelectrochemical catalytic properties can be ascribed to the synergetic effect of the porous N-doped carbon network inherited from ZIF-67 and wrapped CoP or CoN nanoparticles as well as the superior interface achieved via the in situ growth method.									73	4	0	0	1	0	75			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000386310600011

However, there is no facile method to synthesize high-valence noble metal-based materials. Herein, we synthesized the different high valence noble metal M-incorporated PdCu nanoparticles (M = Ir, Ru, Rh) by the assistant of Fe3+ and exhibit excellent performance for water electrolysis. In 0.1 M KOH, the OER and HER mass activities of Ir-16-PdCu/C were 50.5 and 16.5 times as much as PdCu/C, and achieved a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.63 V when worked for overall water splitting. DFT calculation revealed that the incorporating of high valence Ir could optimize the binding energy of the intermediate products, and promote the evolution of oxygen and hydrogen. Ex situ XPS shows that the huge amount of oxidized Ir (V) formed in OER could promote the formation of O.O bonds.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000674354200044	34187162

Illumination caused changes in the absorption spectrum of the compound consistent with a one-electron reduction in the compound. Bromide appears to be the most probable electron donor in the reaction system. Chemical modification of the cluster appears to destabilize it, predisposing it to reductive degradation. UV light was more efficient than visible light in causing the changes. The data support the suggestion that the natural oxygen-evolving Mn complex is photosensitive and can oxidize components of the oxygen-evolving complex in its excited state causing photoinhibition, and that photostability is an important issue in designing Mn complexes for artificial photosynthesis. Furthermore, light-induced oxidation of bromide by [Mn4O6(bpea)(4)](4+) may suggest that oxidation of chloride is involved in natural water splitting or has been involved during the evolution of the water-splitting enzyme.									16	2	0	0	14	0	17			0031-8655	1751-1097		WOS:000265431300004	19192207

To develop a energy storage system is thus a promising way for further industrial applications.Methods: Metallic based silver catalysts were grown onto the carbon powders in the ethanol bath at the reaction temperature of 70 degrees C in10 min using a simple chemical synthesis method. Then Ag/carbon powders as the active materials on the nickel (Ni)-foam were applied in the zinc-based energy storage system.Significant findings: X-ray diffraction patterns of samples showed that the catalyst was the metallic silver with the prefer orientation of (1 1 1) crystal plane and the linear sweep voltammograms for samples in 6 M KOH elec-trolyte showed that the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and Ag+<-> Ag(s) re-action couples were taking place at sample surface. Our cell with the structure of Zn foil/6 M KOH/Ag@C (weight ratio of 3:1) on the Ni foam showed the charge and discharge voltage of 2.03 and 1.07 V at the charge/discharge current density of 10 mA/cm2, respectively and could be applied in the Zn-based energy storage system.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1876-1070	1876-1089		WOS:000868273300005

The concave low-crystallinity nanodisks were constructed by non-classical crystallization with particle attachment aid. Further, we propose the evolution mechanism from the Ga-MOF nanostructure to the gallium oxide nanostructure based on the outward contraction of nanoparticles. This synthesis method is highly straightforward and provides high yields. It is important to note that the beta-Ga2O3 nanorings exhibit good heterogeneous catalytic activity for epoxidation of alkenes. A new oxygen transfer pathway was illustrated to describe the catalytic process based on density functional theory.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000607307900018

This work reports on an excellent bifunctional electrocatalyst consisting of ultrathin N-doped carbon (1-3 graphitic carbon layers) coated Fe1.2Co nanoparticles and N-doped carbon nanotubes (Fe-1.2 Co@NC/NCNTs). The Fe1.2Co@NC/NCNTs have an extremely low Fe/Co content (6.7 wt %), but with highly efficient and durable bifunctionality for ORR and OER. Specifically, the Fe1.2 Co@NC/NCNT exhibits onset potential (E-onset = 0.842 V vs RHE) and half-wave potential (E-1/2 = 0.82 V vs RHE) for ORR and onset potential of 1.43 V vs RHE and overpotential of 355 mV at 10 mA cm(-2 )for OER. The potential gap (Delta E) between E-1/2 of ORR and E-OER at 10 mA cm(-2) (E-j=10) for the Fe1.2Co@NC/NCNTs is 0.765 V, which surpasses the commercial Pt/C and Ir/C catalysts and most state-of-the-art bifunctional catalysts previously reported. Most notably, when used in the Zn-air battery, the Fe1.2Co@NC/NCNT exhibits superior efficiency and durability to the Pt-Ir/C catalysts. This strongly suggests that the Fe1.2Co@NC/NCNT can be used as an efficient bifunctional catalyst with potential applications in the field of clean electrochemical energy storage and conversion technologies.									96	5	0	0	4	0	97			2168-0485			WOS:000467351200057

We report that CoTe2 exhibits optimized OER activity for the first time. Multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) is utilized to support CoTe2 in generating a synergistic effect to enhance OER activity and improve stability by tuning different loading amounts of CoTe2 on CNT. In 1.0 M KOH, bare CoTe2 needed overpotential of 323 mV to produce 10 mA/ cm(2) with Tafel slope of 85.1 mV/dec, but CoTe2/carbon nanotube (CNT) with optimized loading amount of CoTe2 required only 291 mV to produce10 mA/cm(2) with Tafel slope of 44.2 mV/dec. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) was applied to prove that an electron transfer from e(g) band of CoTe2 to CNT caused a synergistic effect. This electron transfer modulated the bond strength of oxygen-related intermediate species on the surface and optimized OER performance. In situ XANES was used to compare CoTe2/CNT and pristine CoTe2 during OER. It proved the transition state of CoOOH more easily existed by adding CNT in hybrid material during OER to enhance the efficiency of OER. Moreover, bare CoTe2 is unstable under OER, but the CoTe2/CNT hybrid materials exhibited improved and exceptional durability by time dependent potentiostatic electrochemical measurement for 24 h and continuous cyclic voltammetry for 1000 times. Our result suggests that this new OER electrocatalyst for OER can be applied in various water-splitting devices and can promote hydrogen economy.									30	0	0	0	0	0	30			1932-7447			WOS:000390072100038

From the voltage time responses and oxide thicknesses measurements after 30 min anodizing, addition of boric acid has negligible effects on the general anodizing behavior of the alloy. However, in the initial stages of anodizing, the presence of boric acid in the electrolyte strongly reduces the occurrence of secondary electrochemical reactions, consuming electrical charge, consequently increasing the initial efficiency for anodic oxide formation. The effect of boric acid in the initial stages of anodizing the alloy is attributed mainly to the inhibition of oxygen evolution on CuAl2 particles by precipitation of partially or, totally dehydrated boron oxide.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0366-1644			WOS:000173712000002

Metallic Ni, generally as the cathode of industrial alkali electrolyzer toward H-2 production, is affordable yet inactive for anodic OER process. Enabling Ni metal with high OER activity directly serving as the anode will be an exciting progress, and undoubtedly full of challenges. Here, unexpectedly, metallic Ni demonstrates OER vitality through a superficial morphological reconstruction of Nifoam (NF) via hydrothermal-etching. The surface morphological change achieves Ni hierarchical nanosheet@nanoparticle array structure (r-Ni-1), ensuring the realization of optimal electrolyte contact and more surface exposure. More importantly, such configuration benefits for further achievement of fast transformation(in several seconds) into metaloxides and/or(oxy) hydroxides during the catalysis which are believed as the real active species. Above mentioned in-situ transformation for conventional NF generally requires high-temperature treatment or long-term electrochemical activation for several hours. The catalytic performance of r-Ni-1 indeed outperforms most bimetallic catalysts with overpotential of 330 mV to yield 60 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 MKOH, and it shows no obvious decay after a 60 h test. Our findings not only present a high-performance OER electrocatalyst, but also offer a possibility toward the simple preparation of anode materials for scale-up alkali electrolyzers.

With the use of poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid), poly(vinyl pyrrolidone), poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride), and poly(vinyl alcohol) as bifunctional materials, PtPd-GNPs can be produced through a procedure that is far simpler than previously reported methods. The as-prepared nanocrystals on GNPs clearly exhibit uniform PtPd alloy structures of around 2nm in size, which are strongly anchored and well distributed on the GNP sheets. The Pt/Pd atomic ratio and loading density of the nanocrystals on the GNPs are controlled easily by changing the metal precursor feed ratio and the mass ratio of GNP to the metal precursor, respectively. As a result of the synergism between Pt and Pd, the as-prepared PtPd-GNPs exhibit markedly enhanced electrocatalytic performance during methanol electro-oxidation compared with monometallic Pt-GNP or commercially available Pt/C. Furthermore, the PtPd-GNP nanocatalysts also show greatly enhanced catalytic activity toward the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction in a lithium-oxygen (Li-O-2) process, resulting in greatly improved cycling stability of a Li-O-2 battery.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000418570000029	28981997

Particularly, the direct fabrication of electrocatalysts on an electrode surface can exhibit strong electronic coupling that results in increased catalytic activity. Herein, copper (Cu) and cuprous oxide (Cu2O) nanoparticles were directly deposited on a nickel foam (NF) substrate and the controlled calcination of the Cu produced mixed copper-copper oxides (CuO, Cu2O-CuO and Cu-Cu2O-CuO) that exhibited excellent composition-controlled bifunctional electrocatalytic (oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)) activity in an alkaline medium with good stability. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) studies confirmed the formation of pure and mixed copper-copper oxide nanomaterials on NF. Mixed copper oxide (Cu2O-CuO@NF) and pure CuO@NF exhibited excellent electrocatalytic OER and HER activity, respectively, in alkaline media. To the best of our knowledge, Cu2O-CuO@NF required an overpotential of 262 mV to achieve the lowest geometric current density (10 mA cm(-2)) among the pure copper-based electrocatalysts reported. Cu2O-CuO@NF also produced a high current density (130.9 mA cm(-2)) at a relatively low applied potential (1.56 V) compared to other catalysts. The low Tafel slope (45.8 mV dec(-1)) and charge-transfer resistance indicated that good electronic coupling and fast charge transport led to the higher activity. In the HER, pure CuO@NF required a much lower overpotential of 165 mV to produce geometric current density. It is worth noting that CuO@NF showed strong HER activity in the alkaline medium. The Tafel slope of 121.81 mV dec(-1)for CuO@NF suggests that the desorption process could be the rate-determining step in the HER process. Cu2O-CuO@NF and CuO@NF exhibited good stability in the alkaline medium. The highly enhanced current density and good stability of Cu2O-CuO@NF in 6.0 M KOH at 60 degrees C highlights its potential for practical applications. Overall, an earth-abundant copper-based electrocatalyst with excellent OER and HER activity in alkaline media has been developed by directly fabricating on a conducting substrate and controlling the copper oxides composition.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000550065200009

Dealloying is typically achieved using free corrosion in acid or electrochemical cycling. Here, we explore dealloying at constant electrode potentials of PtNi3 bimetallic alloy nanoparticles at 5-7 nm and >20 nm size ranges. We investigate how Ni dissolution at four distinct electrode potentials affects the composition, morphology, and surface roughness of the resulting dealloyed catalysts. The electrode potentials cover the hydrogen-adsorption, the double layer region, and the oxygenate adsorption region to examine whether adlayers affect the characteristics of the dealloyed catalysts. We show that large alloy nanoparticles invariably dealloy into porous nanoparticles with a relatively low Ni molar ratio of 0.4, while the smaller size particles show non-porous solid core-shell structures with a monotonic dependence between Ni at% and potential. We provide evidence that the dealloyed catalyst surface is strongly influenced by the presence/absence of adsorbed adlayers of hydrogen or oxygenates. In particular, data suggest that adsorbate adlayers modify the balance between Ni dissolution and Pt surface diffusion during the dealloying process resulting in rougher catalyst surfaces with enhanced surface area values.

How to prevent the aggregation and modulate activity of these species via metal-support interaction should be considered for practical applications. This work presents simple methods involving the creation of carbon- (on carbon nanotube (CNT)) or oxygen-vacancies (on TiO2) to stabilize nickel and ruthenium single atoms. The defective supports and the resulting catalysts are characterized by a large variety of techniques. These analyses show that this strategy is efficient for the preparation of ultra-dispersed catalysts. Comparison of the catalytic performances of these catalysts for the CO2 hydrogenation reaction is also reported. Catalysts supported on TiO2 are more active and sometimes more stable than those deposited on CNT. Nickel catalysts are very selective for the production of CO, and ruthenium catalysts are more selective for the production of methane. Most importantly, it is shown that, in the case of Ru, a direct correlation exists between the electronic density on the metal and the selectivity; electron-rich species produce selectively methane, while electron-deficient species orientate the selectivity toward CO. This work may figure a new way for the synthesis of ultra-dispersed catalysts for various applications.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2196-7350			WOS:000589548100001

However, practical application of the Li-O-2 battery system still faces significant challenges. In this work, we report a new approach for synthesis of ultrafine metal oxide nanocatalysts through an electrochemical prelithiation process. This process reduces the size of NiCo2O4 (NCO) particles from 20-30 nm to a uniformly distributed domain of similar to 2 nm and significantly improves their catalytic activity. Structurally, the prelithiated NCO nanowires feature ultrafine NiO/CoO nanoparticles that are highly stable during prolonged cycles in terms of morphology and particle size, thus maintaining an excellent catalytic effect to oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. A Li-O-2 battery using this catalyst demonstrated an initial capacity of 29 280 mAh g(-1) and retained a capacity of >1000 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles based on the weight of the NCO active material. Direct in situ transmission electron microscopy observations conclusively revealed the lithiation/delithiation process of as-prepared NCO nanowires and provided in-depth understanding for both catalyst and battery chemistries of transition-metal oxides. This unique electrochemical approach could also be used to form ultrafine nanoparticles of a broad range of materials for catalyst and other applications.									56	3	0	0	4	0	56			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000381331900028	27380300

The effects of reaction temperature and C/O molar ratio (content of O is defined as the oxygen in V2O5) on the quality of ferrovanadium nitride were investigated in detail. It was demonstrated that C/O molar ratio had a great influence on the residue carbon, as well as the nitrogen content in the final products. It was found that the nitrogen content of the final product achieved 11.52% when the C/O molar ratio was 90% of the stoichiometric value. However, the nitrogen contents of the final products decreased with the further increase of C/O molar ratio. For the temperature higher than 1773 K, Fe became liquid phase and surrounded the solid V(C, N, O) particles tightly. The formation of liquid Fe was beneficial for the further removal of oxygen atoms left in the V(C, N, O) lattice, since it provided a liquid tunnel for carbon diffusion which greatly enhanced the reaction kinetics. From the results of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermodynamic calculations, phase evolution sequence of V2O5 can be obtained as: V2O5 -> VO2 -> V2O3 -> V(C, N, O). Moreover, the kinetic process from V2O3 to VN was studied and the results shown that the reaction rate can be described by Jander diffusion model with the extracted activation energy of 188.173 kJ/mol.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			1450-5339			WOS:000417723500029

The water splitting reactions are catalyzed at a tetranuclear manganese cluster. The manganese stabilizing protein (MSP) of PSII stabilizes the manganese cluster and accelerates the rate of oxygen evolution. MSP can be removed from PSII, with an accompanying decrease in activity. Either an Escherichia coli expressed version of MSP or native, plant IMSP can be rebound to the PSII reaction center; MSP reconstitution reverses the deleterious effects associated with IMSP removal. We have employed Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and solution small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) techniques to investigate the structure of MSP in solution and to define the structural changes that occur before and after reconstitution to PSII. FTIR and SAXS are complementary, because FTIR spectroscopy detects changes in MSP secondary structure and SAXS detects changes in MSP size/shape. From the SAXS data, we conclude that the size/shape and domain structure of MSP do not change when IMSP binds to PSII. From FTIR data acquired before and after reconstitution, we conclude that the reconstitution-induced increase in beta-sheet content, which was previously reported, persists after IMSP is removed from the PSII reaction center, However, the secondary structural change in MSP is metastable after removal from PSII, which indicates that this form of MSP is not the lowest energy conformation in solution.									16	2	0	0	15	0	19			0006-3495	1542-0086		WOS:000189377400048	14990506

Improved photoactivity is attributed to localized surface plasmon relaxations such as direct electron injection and resonant energy transfer. However, the details on the plasmonic solar water splitting through near electromagnetic field enhancement have not been fully understood. Here, the authors report that shape-controlled gold nanoparticles on wide bandgap semiconductors improve the water-splitting photoactivity of the semiconductors with over-bandgap photon energies compared to sub-bandgap photon energies. It is revealed that hot hole injection into the oxygen evolution reaction potential is the rate-limiting step in plasmonic solar water splitting. The proposed concept of photooxidation catalysts derived from an ensemble of gold nanoparticles having sharp vertices is applicable to various photocatalytic semiconductors and provides a theoretical framework to explore new efficient plasmonic photoelectrodes.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			0934-0866	1521-4117		WOS:000393580600014

Tests were performed in an electrolytic bath whose composition was similar to that used in industrial electrowinning of zinc: 180 g/L H2SO4, 75 g/L Zn2+, with amounts of Mn(II) ranging from 2 to 12 g/L A constant oxidation current density of 300 A/m(2) was applied for 96 h to Pb-Ag electrodes in order to form the anodic films. These films are composed of manganese oxides, and lead sulfates and oxides, determined by SEM-EDX analysis. In order to associate the corresponding reactions involved with each corrosion product, the anodic films were also potentiostatically formed as a function of time, and characterized by polarization curves obtained immediately after the film formation. It is shown that alpha-MnO2, an electrocatalytic phase that favors both the reaction of oxygen evolution and Mn(II) oxidation, forms within the first 10 min, even at relatively low concentrations of Mn (2 g/L). After 1 h, the layer thickness increases and the catalytic effect tends towards its own inhibition; likewise, as the amount of Mn increases, the layers become more cracked and brittle, causing electrolyte penetration through the cracks of oxide layers, which results in the activation of the Pb-Ag surface anode.

PAW with special properties can be used in innovative applications and development of environmental protection science and sustainable energy management. PAW is a natural water solvent, but PAW subverts the public's idea that hydrophobic solutes are difficult to dissolve in water. PAW can dissolve more-hydrophobic solutes than ordinary water, and can also interact with water-soluble alcohol molecules to form stronger HBs. Moreover, in the application of certain reduction reactions, no chemical reducing agent is needed, and the catalytic reduction effect can be achieved using natural PAW. A characteristic application of PAW can also be extended to seawater desalination. Due to weak HBs among PAW molecules, high water evaporation rates can be produced, and a higher chemical potential can also be applied to the innovative development of solar energy storage. In electrochemical applications, PAW itself can promote water oxidation, oxygen reduction reactions, hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, and the efficient capacitor production of H2O2. Furthermore, PAW can delay the melting of sea ice in the habitat of polar bears, so it may be applied to the issue of saving polar bears.

In this study, hierarchically yolk-shell structured manganese oxide/manganese nitride composite powders comprising Co-nanoparticle-embedded N-doped carbon nanotubes (yCo-NCNT-Mn) are successfully fabricated as O-2-electrode catalysts for Li-O-2 batteries. The asprepared yCo-NCNT-Mn powders exhibit high electrocatalytic activities toward both oxygen reduction and evolution. The Li-O-2 battery with yCo-NCNT-Mn exhibits a high capacity (22,344 mA h g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1)), low charge overpotential (0.25 V), and long cycling life (227 cycles at 200 mA g(-1) and cut-off capacity of 500 mA h g(-1)). Experimental analyses reveal that the improved electrochemical performance can be attributed to the synergistic advantages of the electrically conductive NCNTs and excellent catalytic activity of the bifunctional catalyst as the composite form of Co, NCNT, MnO, and Mn4N. Moreover, the unique hierarchical yolk-shell structure increases the capacity by providing a sufficient space to accommodate Li2O2.									18	2	0	0	1	0	18			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000471682900008

Using systematic electrochemical measurements, representative RMs in Li-O-2 battery prototypes were thoroughly explored with respect to oxygen presence, voltage ranges and scan rates. By this comparative, multi-parameters study we reached valuable insights. We identified possible routes for RMs degradation in Li-O-2 batteries related to the cathode side, using bi-compartments cells with solid electrolyte that blocks the crossover between the cathode and the Li metal sides. Based on comparative electrochemical and spectroscopic analyses, we confirmed that degradation of the RMs activity was caused by intrinsic decomposition of the RMs in the electrolyte solution at the cathode part, even before further reactions with reduced oxygen species. This work provides a realistic view of the role of important RMs in Li-oxygen cells and suggests guidelines for effective screening and selecting suitable RMs, mandatory components in Li-O-2 batteries.

Mn-vacancy layered oxides deliver a high ARR-related capacity with small voltage hysteresis, however, they are limited by rapid capacity degradation and poor rate capability, which arise from inferior structure changes due to repeated redox of lattice oxygen. Herein, redox-inactive Ti4+ is introduced to substitute partial Mn4+ to form Na2Ti0.5Mn2.5O7 (Na-4/7[square 1/7Ti1/7Mn5/7]O-2, h for Mn vacancies), which can effectively restrain unfavorable interlayer gliding of Na2Mn3O7 at high charge voltages, as reflected by an ultralow-strain volume variation of 0.11%. There is no irreversible O-2 evolution observed in Na2Ti0.5Mn2.5O7 upon charging, which stabilizes the lattice oxygen and ensures the overall structural stability. It exhibits increased capacity retention of 79.1% after 60 cycles in Na2Ti0.5Mn2.5O7 (17.1% in Na2Mn3O7) and good rate capability (92.1 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1)). This investigation provides new insights into designing high-performance cathode materials with reversible ARR and structural stability for SIBs.

With the increasing of Na, microstructure exhibits the evolution of grains from club-shaped, square, needle-shaped and lamellate to rod-shaped. The temperature dependence of dielectric properties illustrates normal ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition with x = 0.01, 0.03, and 0.05 and the diffusion phase transition with x = 0.08, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2 and 0.3, which implies that B-site disorder caused by composition fluctuation of Na in A-site can also induce diffused phase transition. Also, the aging properties have been investigated with decreased dielectric constant and Curie temperature, as well as constricted P-E loops compared to fresh samples, which can be explained by the symmetry-conforming principle of point defects with defect dipoles in the form of oxygen vacancies surrounding a central Na+ in the distorted oxygen octahedron.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000344809500058

Palladium acetate and manganese acetate in molar ratio 1 : 4 were dissolved in water, and 10 ml of an aqueous solution of phyto-compounds was slowly added until completion of precipitation. The filtered and dried precipitates were then calcined at 450 degrees C to obtain a blackish brown colored mixture of PdO-2Mn(2)O(3)nanocomposite. These particles were analyzed by ultra violet visible spectrophotometry (UV-vis), infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for crystallinity, optical properties, and compositional and morphological makeup. Using Tauc's plot, the direct band gap (3.18 eV) was calculated from the absorption spectra. The average crystallite sizes, as calculated from the XRD, were found to be 15 and 14.55 nm for PdO and Mn2O3, respectively. A slurry of the phyto-fabricated PdO-2Mn(2)O(3)powder was deposited on Ni-foam and tested for electro-catalytic water splitting studies in 1 M KOH solution. The electrode showed excellent OER and HER performance with low over-potential (0.35 V and 121 mV) and Tafel slopes of 115 mV dec(-1)and 219 mV dec(-1), respectively. The outcomes obtained from this study provide a direction for the fabrication of a cost-effective mixed metal oxide based electro-catalystviaan environmentally benign synthesis approach for the generation of clean energy.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				2046-2069		WOS:000561946700040	35518230

This is particularly true in the field of electrochemistry, with a myriad of emerging applications ranging from catalysis to supercapacitors and solar cells. Despite this rise, current understanding of their electrochemical characteristics is especially lacking. We therefore examine the inherent electroactivities of various chemically exfoliated TMDs (MoSe2, WS2, WSe2) and their implications for sensing and catalysis of the hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). The TMDs studied are found to possess distinctive inherent electroactivities and together with their catalytic effects for the HER are revealed to strongly depend on the chemical exfoliation route and metal-to-chalcogen composition particularly in MoSe2. Despite its inherent activity exhibiting large variations depending on the exfoliation procedure, it is also the most efficient HER catalyst with a low overpotential of -0.36 V vs RHE (at 10 mA cm(-2) current density) and fairly low Tafel slope of similar to 65 mV/dec after BuLi exfoliation. In addition, it demonstrates a fast heterogeneous electron transfer rate with a k(obs)(0) of 9.17 x 10(-4) cm s(-1) toward ferrocyanide, better than that seen for conventional glassy carbon electrodes. Knowledge of TMD electrochemistry is essential for the rational development of future applications; inherent TMD activity may potentially limit certain purposes, but intended objectives can nonetheless be achieved by careful selection of TMD compositions and exfoliation methods.									233	7	0	0	10	0	234			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000347138000031	25453501

Herein, we combine ultrasonic impact nanocrystallization (UIN) technology with nital etching method to rapidly prepare highly efficient self-supporting Cu electrode with abundant low-angle grain boundaries. When used as a catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the as-prepared electrode exhibits an overpotential of 353 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2, which is about 200 mV lower than that of the blank Cu plate. Moreover, the overpotential decreased to 246 mV after the stability test of 100 h, indicating a self-optimizing property. This work paves a new way for the preparation of self-supporting electrode with high performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0925-8388	1873-4669		WOS:000807105100005		
J	Zhao, Wei; Zhong, Qin; Pan, Yanxiao; Zhang, Rui								Defect structure and evolution mechanism of O-2(-) radical in F-doped V2O5/TiO2 catalysts								COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS				436				1013	1020		10.1016/j.colsurfa.2013.08.047				SEP 5 2013	2013	Fluorine (F)-doped titania (TiO2) nanoparticles were synthesized by the sol-gel method, which could create more oxygen vacancies on the TiO2 support. The experiments of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated that F-doping could inhibit anatase-to-rutile transition and active component V2O5 had a good dispersion on the support. This paper illustrated the preparation process of the F-doped V2O5/TiO2 catalyst and the generation of stabled superoxide radical anion (O-2) on the surface of the F-doped V2O5/TiO2 catalyst. The characterization and stability of O-2(-) over V2O5/TiO2 was investigated by using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. F-doping could produce more oxygen vacancies on the surface of the catalyst and increase the Ti3+ concentration. UV-vis spectrophotometer was employed to characterize the effect of F-doping on the band gap of the samples. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra strongly confirmed the enhancement of oxygen vacancies by F-doping. The presence of Ti3+ and V4+ in the samples was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra. The following mechanism was proposed according to the results from EPR spectra and reaction stoichiometry studies of radical species. Metal oxide catalysts might be viewed as electron donors while the adsorbed oxygen molecules behaved as surface electron acceptors. Over the isolated tetrahedral Ti species, a [Ti3+-Ov(-)] radical pair was formed by F-doping. One possible explanation for the enhancement of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalytic activity was that the presence of Ti3+ and V4+ formed by charge compensation, and the subsequently Ov(-) moiety reacted with O-2 to form O-2(-), which could react with NO to yield NO2.

Here, the greenly synthesized rCoFe-PBA was established as durable and effective bifunctional electrocatalyst for HER and OER process. The rCoFe-PBA coated Nickel foam electrode exhibit overpotential of 311 mV (OER) and 100 mV (HER) @ 10 mA cm(-2) significantly lower than commercial IrO2 (381 mV) and near to Pt/C (36 mV). The rCoFe-PBA show smaller Tafel slope (OER: 57 mV dec(-1)) than IrO2 (78 mV dec(-1)) and exhibit Tafel slope of 131 mV dec(-1) (HER) which is near to Pt (90 mV dec(-1)). Turnover frequency (TOF) was estimated as 0.22 s(-1) (OER) and 0.26 s(-1) (HER) was found to be 5 and 10 times higher than IrO2 catalyst (0.040 s(-1)) and Pt/C catalyst (0.025 s(-1)), respectively. For solar water electrolysis, rCoFe-PBA/NF shows overpotential of 411 mV and durability over 180 h in 1.0 m KOH (4.1 % potential loss). The combination of non-precious electrolyzer, rCoFe-PBA with commercial solar cell produced H-2 gas in alkaline water under sunlight. This methodology proves that the greenly synthesized rCoFe-PBA electrolyzer can outperform the precious electrocatalysts, implying that the cost-effective large scale H-2 production without artificial current is possible with commercial solar cells.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2365-6549			WOS:000848261600001

A bifunctional nickel, iron-nanomesh array electrocatalyst has been developed characteristic of excellent structural features for favorable NRR and OER processes, including highly exposed active sites originated from sub-nanometer-thick nanomeshes, hierarchical porosity resulting from the array-arranged nanolayers, and binary nickel, iron active sites. The electrode demonstrates excellent NRR activity with an ammonia yield of 16.89 mu g h(-1) mg(cat)(-1) and a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 12.50% at -350 mV (vs RHE), in addition to OER activity with a small overpotential of 191 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2). Consequently, a full N-2 electrolysis system has been constructed that exhibits remarkable ammonia production performance with an ammonia yield of 2.07 mu g h(-1) mg(cat)(-1) at 1.9 V, an FE of 9.87% at 1.6 V, and good durability for 30 h. Further mechanism study through density function theory shows that the NRR proceeds via an associative distal pathway, whereas the free energies for the N-2* -> NNH* intermediate step in the NRR as well as the OH* + H2O -> O* + H2O intermediate step in the OER can be reduced by tuning the catalysts electronic structure by the strong synergistic effect between nickel and iron.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300043

Our DFT calculations reveal that the Ni2P (0001) surface is active toward adsorption of the DRM species, with the Ni hollow site being the most energetically stable site and Ni-P and P contributing as coadsorption sites in DRM reaction steps. Free-energy analysis at 1000 K found CH-O to be the main pathway for CO formation. The competition of DRM and reverse water gas shift (RWGS) is also evidenced with the latter becoming important at relatively low reforming temperatures. Very interestingly, oxygen seems to play a key role in making this surface resistant toward coking. From microkinetic analysis, we have found greater oxygen surface coverage than that of carbon at high temperatures, which may help to oxidize carbon deposits in continuous runs. The tolerance of Ni2P toward carbon deposition was further corroborated by DFT and microkinetic analysis. Along with the higher probability of C oxidation, we identify poor capacity of carbon diffusion on the Ni2P (0001) surface with very limited availability of C nucleation sites. Overall, this study opens avenues for research in metal-phosphide catalysis and expands the application of these materials to CO2 conversion reactions.									25	2	0	0	1	0	25			2155-5435			WOS:000464075700076

The nature products formed by the direct electrochemical oxidation depends on potential. The degradation of dihydroxy-acid is observed only at relatively high potentials, where radical oxygen species are formed ill a high amount by the oxidation of water. At relatively lower potentials the process shows stirring dependence and leads essentially to one oxidation product which is adsorbed on the electrode. A comparative examination of the results, considering also the requested amount of ozone as a parameter, shows that the external cell and cathodic oxidation are the most efficient methods. This confirms our previous data on the oxidation of phenolic compounds, and the cathodic oxidation with ozone emerges as a promising approach in the abatement of pollutants.

It has significant influences on the conversion efficiency of slurry-phase hydrocracking. The reactivity and structure changes of CT-asp in a slurry-phase process were investigated. Experimental results showed that the conversion of CT-asp reached 66.5 wt % with a significant decrease of sulfur and oxygen contents as the reaction time increased. The CT-asp obtained from the hydrocracking reaction carried out for different time has been analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and H-1/C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance. The chemical structural analysis results confirmed that CT-asp was mainly composed of more aromatic rings with oxygen functional groups and possessed a higher aromaticity and shorter aliphatic chains after hydrocracking. Moreover, the effective cracking of carbonyl groups, pyrrolic nitrogen, and alkyl sulfides in CT-asp was found during the slurry-phase hydrocracking. It was considered that a structure with an average of two aromatic rings per aromatic sheet existed in the average molecule of CT-asp, and the aromatic sheets were condensed with each other through diphenyl-like structures or oxo-bridged linkages. In addition, a free radical reaction pathway of CT-asp in slurry-phase hydrocracking was proposed on the basis of the main detected products and the molecular structural changes.									8	2	0	0	0	0	10			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000394560900088

Herein, a 3D hydrogen evolution cathode is designed and synthesized by in situ grafting MoS2 nanosheets on a 3D carbon fiber felt (CFF) framework. As a low-cost HER catalyst, MoS2 nanosheets have effective hydrogen atom adsorption activity due to their uniform distribution in the 3D CFF framework. Meanwhile, the 3D CFF framework facilitates the electrolyte to penetrate into the inner space and accelerate the electron transfer, which leads to a drastic increase in the HER activity. Electrochemical measurements show that the MoS2/CFF composite exhibit an excellent electrocatalytic activity with 101 mV overpotential, affording a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a high exchange current density of 3.3 x 10(-2) mA cm(-2). Therefore, this 3D material, which has splendid catalytic performance and stability, exhibits great potential in the electrocatalytic hydrogen production for water splitting.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000474269800019

In order to enhance the efficiency of photocatalytically active materials like the oxynitride LaTiO2N, cocatalysts are often used. Here, four different LaTiO2N particle morphologies are decorated with the oxygen evolution cocatalyst Co3O4. It is shown by transmission electron microscopy characterization that the four morphologies give rise to different Co3O4 cocatalyst particle size distributions. By studying the effect of the cocatalysts on both the photocatalytic and the photoelectrochemical performance, we find that the improvement depends on cocatalyst size, in different ways for both processes. In order to design efficient cocatalysts, not only their chemical composition is decisive, but also their size, as a function of the solar energy conversion process. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The morphology and chemical compositions of all NiSn samples were investigated by SEM and EDS techniques before and after the SLT. HER during the SLT has also been monitored by EIS technique. The chemical compositions of surfaces of all NiSn alloy samples, as well as EIS results, were found to depend on the number of cycles performed during the SLT. The decrease of their catalytic activity for the HER in 32 wt.% NaOH at 90 degrees C with increasing the number of cycles (about 20-25 mV after 25 cycles) was practically identical to that for DN cathode, while NiSn samples deposited at -30 mA cm(-2), -60 mA cm(-2) and -100 mA cm(-2) possessed lower overpotential for the HER before and after SLT in comparison with that for the DN cathode. It is confirmed by the SEM-EDS and EIS analysis of the NiSn samples that the minor loss of the catalytic activity for the HER is the consequence of the change of chemical composition of NiSn coatings and decrease of the active surface area. This decrease is ascribed to partially eroded NiSn coatings due to oxygen evolution during the SLT. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We took advantage of the high frequency of homologous DNA recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to develop a strategy for domain mutagenesis aimed at introducing and in vivo recombining random mutations in defined segments of DNA. Mutagenic Organized Recombination Process by Homologous IN vivo Grouping (MORPHING) is a one-pot random mutagenic method for short protein regions that harnesses the in vivo recombination apparatus of yeast. Using this approach, libraries can be prepared with different mutational loads in DNA segments of less than 30 amino acids so that they can be assembled into the remaining unaltered DNA regions in vivo with high fidelity. As a proof of concept, we present two eukaryotic-ligninolytic enzyme case studies: i) the enhancement of the oxidative stability of a H2O2-sensitive versatile peroxidase by independent evolution of three distinct protein segments (Leu28-Gly57, Leu149-Ala174 and Ile199-Leu268); and ii) the heterologous functional expression of an unspecific peroxygenase by exclusive evolution of its native 43-residue signal sequence.									39	4	0	0	24	0	44			1932-6203			WOS:000332839300054	24614282

The electrodes were prepared by magnetron sputtering (MS) in an oblique angle configuration and under various conditions aimed at preparing metallic, oxide, or oxyhydroxide films. Their electrochemical analysis has been complemented with a thorough physicochemical characterization to determine the effect of microstructure, chemical state, bilayer structure, and film thickness on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The maximum electrocatalytic activity was found for the metallic electrode, where analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) demonstrated that the active catalytic phase at the surface after its electrochemical conditioning is a kind of oxidized nickel oxide/hydroxide layer with the thickness of a few nanometers. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis of these steady-state working electrodes supports that the enhanced performance of the metallic nickel anode vs other chemical states resides in the easier electron transfer through the electrode films and the various interlayers built up during their fabrication and activation. The long-term steady-state operation of the anodes and their efficiency for water splitting was proved in a full-cell AEMWE setup incorporating magnetron-sputtered metallic nickel as the cathode. This work proves that MS is a suitable technique to prepare active, stable, and low-cost electrodes for AEMWE and the capacity of this technique to control the chemical state of the electrocatalytically active layers involved in the OER.									32	0	0	0	3	0	32			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900021

In this study, O2-Type Li-0.(78)[Li0.24Mn0.76]O-2 nanowires were synthesized by a solvothermal reaction to produce P2-type Na-5/6[Li1/4Mn3/4]O-2 nanowires, which were then subjected to molten salt Li-ion exchange. The resulting nanowires have diameters less than 20 nm and lengths of several micrometers. The full-Mn-based nanowires cathode material delivers a reversible capacity of 275 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and 200 mAh g(-1) at a high current rate of 15 C with a capacity retention of more than 80% and the voltage decay was dramatically suppressed after 100 cycles. This excellent performance is ascribed to the highly stable oxygen redox reaction and lack of layered-to-spinel phase transition in the O2-type structure during cycling.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000562935200027	32643943

Such fine-tuning is suggested by the unusually strong temperature dependence of the triple-alpha reaction rate at stellar temperatures. This sensitivity is due to the resonant character of the triple-alpha process, which proceeds through the so-called "Hoyle state" of C-12 with spin-parity 0(+). The question of fine-tuning can be studied within the ab initio framework of nuclear lattice effective field theory, which makes it possible to relate ad hoc changes in the energy of the Hoyle state to changes in the fundamental parameters of the nuclear Hamiltonian, which are the light quark mass m(q) and the electromagnetic fine-structure constant alpha(em). Here, we update the effective field theory calculation of the sensitivity of the triple-alpha process to small changes in the fundamental parameters. In particular, we consider recent high-precision lattice QCD calculations of the nucleon axial coupling g(A), as well as new and more comprehensive results from stellar simulations of the production of carbon and oxygen. While the updated stellar simulations allow for much larger ad hoc shifts in the Hoyle state energy than previously thought, recent lattice QCD results for the nucleon S-wave singlet and triplet scattering lengths now disfavor the "no fine-tuning scenario" for the light quark mass m(q).									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1434-6001	1434-601X		WOS:000522277200005

The nanocomposite is endowed with superior performance in Li-O-2 battery because of the synergistic reaction between nanosized manganese carbodiimide and N-doping carbon materials. Evaluated as the electrocatalyst, the MnNCN/NC nanocomposite delivers high specific capacity of 9960 mA h g(-1) with a discharge plateau of ca. 2.7 V, higher than those of bulk MnNCN/NC and NC individually. The MnNCN/NC nanocomposite also exhibits a lower overpotential in battery operation. Compared to the bulk-MnNCN/NC and NC electrodes, a superior cycling stability of 100 cycles is obtained based on the electrode with the electrocatalyst of MnNCN/NC nanocomposites. Combining the experimental research studies and the density functional theory calculations, it can be observed that the superior electrochemical performance resulted from the high electrocatalytic activity {Mn-N-6} moieties and the high conductivity of N-doping carbon material substrates, which could facilitate the mass transfer and electronic kinetics for the battery reactions. It also provides a new method of the manganese carbodiimide preparation and a new insight for the application of metal carbodiimide.									20	4	0	0	0	0	21			2168-0485			WOS:000492117200057

The key challenge in demonstrating the importance of twin defects for catalysis is the extreme difficulties in creating nanostructures with the same exposed facets but tunable twin defects that are suitable for catalytic investigations. Herein, we show an efficient synthetic strategy to selectively synthesize {111}-terminated Pt3Cu nanocrystals with controllable crystalline features. Two distinct {111}-bounded shapes, namely, multiply-twinned Pt3Cu icosahedra and single-crystalline Pt3Cu octahedra, are successfully prepared by simply changing the types of Cu precursors with the other growth parameters unchanged. Electrocatalytic studies show that the {111}-terminated Pt3Cu nanocrystals exhibit the very interesting crystalline nature-dependent electrocatalytic activities toward both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) with multiply-twinned Pt3Cu icosahedra demonstrating enhanced electrocatalytic activities compared to the single-crystalline Pt3Cu octahedra due to their additional yet important effect of twin defect. As a result, under the multiple tuning conditions (alloy, shape, and twin effects), the multiply-twinned Pt3Cu icosahedra exhibit much enhanced electrocatalytic activities in both ORR and MOR with respect to the Pt black. The present work highlights the importance of twin defects in enhancing electrocatalytic activities of metallic nanocrystals.									151	17	0	0	9	0	152			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000358823200100	26172056

Creating metal sites at composite interfaces as recombination centers of photo-generated electrons from conduction band (CB) of Ag3PO4 and holes from valence band (VB) of MoS2 is an effective strategy to enhance the charge separation efficiency and photocatalytic performance. Strong coupled MoS2/Ag dots/Ag3PO4 ternary heterojunction photocatalysts were fabricated by one-pot precipitation method, in which highly dispersed Ag dots are located at the MoS2/Ag3PO4 interfaces and MoS2 is bonded with PO(4)(3-)in the form of Mo-O-P. The fabricated MoS2/Ag dots/Ag3PO4 photocatalyst presents a 2.8-fold enhancement of photocatalytic activity of water oxidation compared to that of pristine Ag3PO4, which is achieved for the first time. The great enhancement of photocatalytic performance can be ascribed to the improved Z scheme mechanism with strongly coupled MoS2/Ag dots/Ag3PO4 ternary interfaces, in which highly dispersed Ag dots serve as efficient recombination centers resulting in the improved separation of photo-generated holes and electrons of Ag3PO4 as well as photocatalytic activity of oxygen evolution.

The active photocatalyst is synthesized by subjecting a CN sample to consecutive annealing and ammonia treatments. The CN sample is produced through urea condensation. The annealing treatment destroys the polymeric CN to form a defective polymeric layer framework incorporating 1,3,4,6,7,9,9b-Heptaazaphenalene-2,5,8-triamine (melem) oligomers. The annealed CN exhibits a wide absorption range in visible light because the distorted structure causes conjugation of the -orbital with a nitrogen nonbonding state. The subsequent ammonia treatment of the annealed CN repairs the nitrogen vacancies and bridges the polymeric framework and melem oligomers. The repaired and bridged sample (N-aCN) provides viable pathways for charge separation and transport, and active amino sites are introduced in the sample for electron injection in order to produce H-2. When Pt is deposited, the CN and N-aCN samples catalyze H-2 evolution from aqueous triethanolamine solution at quantum yields of 3.7 and 17%, respectively, under 420 nm monochromatic irradiation. The high activity of N-aCN demonstrates that the oligomer-incorporated polymeric layer framework effectively harvests light and mediates charge transport in CN materials for photoenergy conversion.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0934-0866	1521-4117		WOS:000423103600003

Multi-functional perovskites can well drive adsorption and photocatalytic reactions to remove water pollutants. There are many advantages of perovskites, such as abundant oxygen vacancies, easily tunable structural morphology, stable crystal state, highly active metal sites, and a wide photo response range. However, there are few reviews on the simultaneous application of perovskite to adsorption and photocatalytic removal of water pollutants. Thus, this paper discusses the preparation methods of perovskite, the factors affecting the adsorption of water environmental pollutants by perovskite, and the factors affecting perovskite photocatalytic water pollutants. The particle size, specific surface area, oxygen vacancies, electron-hole trapping agents, potentials of the valence band, and conduction band in perovskites are significant influencing factors for adsorption and photocatalysis. Strategies for improving the performance of perovskites in the fields of adsorption and photocatalysis are dis-cussed. The adsorption behaviors and catalytic mechanisms are also investigated, including adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics, electrostatic interaction, ion exchange, chemical bonding, and photocatalytic mechanism. It summarizes the removal of water pollutants by using perovskites. It provides the design of perovskites as high -efficiency adsorbents and catalysts for developing new technologies.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000867702500004	36155298

Using alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) techniques, the electrochemical kinetics of oxygen evolution and metal deposition was investigated in a pendant droplet of molten alumina (Al2O3) with three iridium (Ir) electrodes in a thermal imaging furnace. For the first time, the direct electrolytic decomposition of molten Al2O3 to oxygen gas and aluminum (Al) metal (alloyed with Ir) was observed, confirming the ionic nature of molten Al2O3. The decomposition potential of molten Al2O3 was measured with high precision using AC voltammetry, and the results demonstrated remarkable sensitivity to variation in temperature enabling measurement of chemical potential and entropy of Al at the Ir-rich solid-liquid phase boundary for the first time. The results were in remarkably close agreement with the most recent thermodynamic assessment of the Al-Ir system. (c) The Author(s) 2017. Published by ECS.

Electrochemical water splitting is regarded as one of the most economical and eco-friendly approaches for hydrogen evolution. Recently, emerging two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have demonstrated their potential as distinguished non-noble catalysts for hydrogen evolution. These ultrathin nanomaterials are dramatically different from their bulk counterparts. Abundant active sites are maximally exposed and the small diffusion paths of the ultrathin nanosheets can effectively facilitate charge transfer in the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Moreover, many tactics can be easily adopted in such an interesting and adjustable platform, which makes the 2D material an ideal object to explore the exciting catalytic activity and electronic transfer. Various inventive strategies regarding increasing active sites, improving intrinsic activity and enhancing electrical conductivity for enhancing catalytic performance are urgently pursued. Here, the primary criteria for evaluating catalysts in electrochemical HER is discussed, followed by a brief introduction of the superiorities of 2D nanomaterial catalysts for HER. Based on these, recent strategies for improving the catalytic activity of 2D nanomaterials are summarized. We believe this review will provide deep insights for understanding the 2D material catalysts for catalyzing HER, and aid in devising new catalysts with high catalytic activity.									181	9	0	0	7	0	181			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000400983400002

In this work, a multi-function electrocatalyst of cobalt oxyhydroxide decorating homogeneous porous hollow carbon sphere (CoOOH-PHCS) was designed and fabricated. The CoOOH-PHCS can not only be used as an electrocatalyst to inhibit the shuttle effect in Li-S batteries (LSBs), but also can effectively accelerate the reaction kinetics in oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER). Meanwhile, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to investigate the electrocatalytic activity of the CoOOH-PHCS. Benefiting from the synergy effect of CoOOH and PHCS, the CoOOH-HPC/S electrode exhibits a low capacity decay of 0.04% per cycle in 450 cycles at 1C. Meanwhile, the CoOOH-PHCS demonstrates excellent OER and ORR activity in the alkaline electrolyte. This work explores and reveals the application potential of CoOOH in electrocatalytic field.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000783147100001

Here, we applied a large-scale phylogenomic reconstruction approach in the model diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum to map the evolutionary origins of the eukaryotic RSP. The majority of P. tricornutum redoxsensitive cysteines (76%) is specific to eukaryotes, yet these are encoded in genes that are mostly of a prokaryotic origin (57%). Furthermore, we find a threefold enrichment in redox-sensitive cysteines in genes that were gained by endosymbiotic gene transfer during the primary plastid acquisition. The secondary endosymbiosis event coincides with frequent introduction of reactive cysteines into existing proteins. While the plastid acquisition imposed an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species, our results suggest that it was accompanied by significant expansion of the RSP, providing redox regulatory networks the ability to cope with fluctuating environmental conditions.									19	0	0	0	15	0	19			2055-026X	2055-0278		WOS:000406036800004	28504699

The effect of oxygen addition								JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY B				31	4					042201	10.1116/1.4810908				JUL 2013	2013	The effect of oxygen addition to chlorine plasma during shallow trench isolation etching is quantified in this work. Specifically, the electron density and the electron temperature in an electron cyclotron resonance reactor were characterized by a Langmuir probe and were found to remain relatively constant upon O-2 addition. The silicon etching rates were found to increase with the square root of the ion energy, suggesting the etching reaction is limited by the momentum transfer from ions to the surface. A relatively small amount of oxygen addition (<10%) to the chlorine plasma simultaneously changes the reactor wall conditions and surface kinetics, since oxygen becomes actively involved in the surface reactions. The change in the chamber wall conditions and surface kinetics leads to the change in both the amount of etch products and the etched feature profile. The incorporation of oxygen on the surface results in a significant change of the etched surface morphology and its composition. This work suggests a small amount of O-2 addition to Cl-2 plasmas in shallow trench isolation etching changes the etching behavior primarily through modifying the kinetics on etched surfaces.

J	BOICHENKO, VA; KLIMOV, VV; MAYES, SR; BARBER, J								CHARACTERIZATION OF THE LIGHT-INDUCED OXYGEN GAS-EXCHANGE FROM THE IC2 DELETION MUTANT OF SYNECHOCYSTIS PCC-6803 LACKING THE PHOTOSYSTEM-II 33 KDA EXTRINSIC PROTEIN								ZEITSCHRIFT FUR NATURFORSCHUNG SECTION C-A JOURNAL OF BIOSCIENCES				48	3-4			224	233						MAR-APR 1993	1993	We have performed analyses of the flash-induced oxygen exchange in the mutated cyanobacterium to clarify further the role of the 33 kDa protein. Under aerobic conditions, both the wild type and IC2 mutant show a relatively slow signal of oxygen rise on the first flash which is increased about twice by the addition of 10 muM DCMU and significantly diminished by lowering the oxygen concentration in the medium. According to action spectra measurements, this mode of apparent oxygen release is mediated by PS I and can be attributed to a light induced inhibition of respiratory activity. In contrast to the wild type, having the usual oxygen evolution flash pattern with a periodicity of four, the IC2 mutant shows a binary oscillation pattern of flash-induced respiratory oxygen exchange at a flash frequency 10 Hz, being dampened with DCMU or by a lower flash frequency (< 1 Hz). Oxygen evolution due to water splitting is clearly seen in the IC2 mutant when background far-red illumination is applied to saturate the signal due to respiratory inhibition, but a quadruple oscillatory component of flash-induced oxygen evolution appears only in the presence of artificial electron acceptors under partial aerobic conditions. The mutant possesses a higher PS I/PS II ratio compared to the wild type, as judged from both the flash-induced yields and quantum efficiencies of the steady-state rates of the oxygen exchange reactions. Estimates of antenna sizes indicate about a 20% decrease of optical cross-section at 675 nm of the PS II unit in IC2 mutants in comparison with the wild type. It is suggested that the absence of the 33 kDa protein leads to a modification of the PS II assembly and because of the slowing down of the S-state cycle, the rate of cyclic electron flow around PS II is enhanced. It seems that the absence of the 33 kDa protein in Synechocystis 6803 also disturbs energy transfer between adjacent PS II core complexes and may also alter their association with the phycobilisomes.									21	0	1	0	17	0	22			0939-5075	1865-7125		WOS:A1993LB47900018

However, the origin of their enhanced catalytic properties remains elusive. Furthermore, a robust synthetic strategy for well-defined intermetallic nanostructures represents a challenge. Here, we reveal by combining theoretical and experimental results that the activity enhancement in intermetallic structures for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) originates from an intensified ligand effect. We prepared well-defined model nanocatalysts via confined nanospace-directed synthesis using mesoporous silica templates, which allows precise control over the size and shape of nanostructures. Importantly, this method can transform disordered alloy nanostructures into intermetallic analogues without agglomeration, enabling decoupling of an atomic ordering effect in catalysis. The prepared ordered intermetallic Pt3Co nanowires (O-Pt3Co NWs) can benefit from an intensified ligand effect, Pt-skin layer, and agglomeration-tolerant contiguous structure, which led to their enhanced ORR activity and durability compared to disordered alloy Pt3Co nanowires (D-Pt3Co NWs) and Pt/C catalysts. The multifunctionality of O-Pt3Co NWs is demonstrated with their higher activity and durability in the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction and acidic methanol oxidation reaction than those of D-Pt3Co NWs and Pt/C catalysts. Furthermore, a proton exchange membrane fuel cell cathode based on O-Pt3Co NWs shows much better durability than a Pt/C-based one.									60	9	0	0	0	0	61			2155-5435			WOS:000502169900055

Herein, we report Fe-based MOFs (MIL-53 and NH2-MIL-53) which show photocatalytic activity for water oxidation under visible light. Compared with MIL-53 (Fe), NH2-MIL-53 (Fe) shows higher photocatalytic efficiency for water oxidation due to the narrower band gap and more efficient separation of the photo-excited electron-hole pairs. Furthermore, through active species trapping experiments and mechanism studies, we find that the photogenerated holes and hydroxyl radicals are possibly responsible for the photocatalytic water oxidation activity of the Fe-based MOFs.									23	1	0	0	1	0	23			2398-4902			WOS:000443282700019

Most physically relevant models used by engineers derive from various additions and corrections to enhance the earlier deoxygenation-reaeration model proposed by Streeter and Phelps in 1925, the unknowns being the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. The one we deal with includes Taylor's dispersion to account for the heterogeneity of the contamination in all space directions. The system we obtain is then composed of two reaction-dispersion equations. The particularity is that both Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions are available on the DO tracer while the BOD density is free of any conditions. In fact, for real-life concerns, measurements on the DO are easy to obtain and to save. On the contrary, collecting data on the BOD is a sensitive task and turns out to be a lengthy process. The global model pursues the reconstruction of the BOD density, and especially of its flux along the boundary. Not only is this problem plainly worth studying for its own interest but it could also be a mandatory step in other applications such as the identification of the location of pollution sources. The non-standard boundary conditions generate two difficulties in mathematical and computational grounds. They set up a severe coupling between both equations and they are the cause of the ill-posed data reconstruction problem. Existence and stability fail. Identifiability is therefore the only positive result one can search for; it is the central purpose of the paper. Finally, we have performed some computational experiments to assess the capability of the mixed finite element in missing data recovery.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0266-5611	1361-6420		WOS:000328861800003

Therefore, the design of highly efficient, stable, and noble-metal-free electrocatalysts for oxygen-related reactions (OER) is critical but challenging and is still worth improving. Herein, a facile and controllable synthesis strategy for bimetallic electrocatalysts for the OER from a two-dimensional iron-based metal-organic framework (HUST-8, HUST = Huazhong University of Science and Technology) precursor has been reported. The unoccupied porphyrin center has been disposed into the layer structure of HUST-8, which is very facile for the introduction of a second type of metal center via post-modification treatment. Guided by the synthesis strategy, Fe/Ni, Fe/Co, Fe/Zn, Fe/Mn and Fe/Fe species have been fabricated, and their electrocatalytic performance for the OER has been further characterized, among which the Fe/Ni type exhibits the best efficiency and conversion. For Fe/Ni species of HUST-8 (labeled as Ni@HUST-8), in 1 M KOH, the initial potential for OER activity performance is 170 mV (vs. RHE). At 10 mA cm(-2), the corresponding overpotential is 240 mV and the Tafel slope is simulated as 60.8 mV dec(-1). All of these experimental results of Ni@HUST-8 illustrate its better performance than commercial IrO2. Compared to the MOF parent and other bimetallic species, the higher electrocatalytic performance of Ni@HUST-8 should be ascribed to the special synergistic effect of Fe and Ni centers, which tends to greatly improve the reaction kinetics and charge transfer efficiency, while increasing the activity of the OER and achieving the best catalytic performances. The systematic investigation clearly manifests the important role of the synergistic effect of bimetallic centers in the OER and provides other insight into fabricating tailored electrocatalysts derived from MOF-based templates.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			2052-1553			WOS:000592314600008

This description combines the advantages of the cell method (the ability to describe phenomena of a stochastic nature) and the string method (parameterization of the model in terms of physically observable quantities). The consistency of the model for etching silicon and silicon oxide in a fluorine-containing plasma, as well as etching in a SF6/O2 mixture at different temperatures is demonstrated. Spontaneous etching of silicon under the action of fluorine radicals, ion-stimulated etching, surface passivation in plasma containing oxygen radicals are simulated. A model that describes the temperature dependence of the etching character is proposed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1063-7397			INSPEC:20784611

However, it has not received as much attention as other materials due to its tendency to oxidize very quickly in aqueous environments, particularly when it is employed as the anode where it drives the oxygen evolution reaction. In recent years, several works have appeared in the literature examining the suitability of thin transition metal oxide films grown on top of the silicon to act as a corrosion barrier. The film should be transparent to solar radiation, allow hole transport from the silicon surface to the electrolyte, and stop the diffusion of oxygen from the electrolyte back to the silicon. In this work, we compare Mn-oxide, Co-oxide, and Ni-oxide thin films grown using physical vapor deposition in order to evaluate which material offers the best combination of photocurrent and corrosion protection. In addition to the electrochemical data, we also present a detailed before-and-after study of the surface chemistry of the films using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. This approach allows for a comprehensive analysis of the mechanisms by which the corrosion barriers protect the underlying silicon, and how they degrade during the water oxidation reaction.

Herein, few-layered Mo(1-x)WxS2 hollow nano spheres-modified Ni3S2 heterostructures are prepared through a facile hydrothermal method to further enhance the electrocatalytic performance of MoS2. The doping of W element optimizes the electronic structure of MoS2@Ni3S2 thus improving the conductivity and charge-transfer ability of MoS2@Ni3S2. In addition, benefitting from the few-layered hollow structure of Mo(1-x)WxS2, the strong electronic interactions between Mo(1-x)WxS2 and Ni3S2 and the hierarchical structure of one-dimensional nanorods and three-dimensional Ni foam, massive active sites and fast ion and charge transportation are obtained. As a result, the optimized Mo(1-x)WxS2@Ni3S2 heterostructure (Mo-W-S-2@Ni3S2) achieves an extremely low overpotential of 98 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction and 285 mV for oxygen evolution reaction at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline electrolyte. Particularly, using Mo-W-S-2@Ni3S2 heterostructure as a bifunctional electrocatalyst, a cell voltage of 1.62 V is required to deliver a 10 mA cm(-2) water splitting current density. In addition, the electrode can be maintained at 10 mA cm(-2) for at least 50 h, indicating the excellent stability of Mo-W-S-2@Ni3S2 heterostructure. Therefore, this development demonstrates an effective and feasible strategy to prepare highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									79	2	1	0	5	0	80			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000407540400045	28731319

The beta-FeOOH nanorod was synthesized by coprecipitation, using an organic buffer of tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane. The beta-FeOOH nanorods dispersed in 1 M KOH aq. as an alkaline electrolyte were electrochemically deposited on a nickel electrode by a constant current electrolysis. The deposited beta-FeOOH nanorods formed bundled network on the surface of the electrode and exhibited high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, where the minimum OER overpotential was 285 mV at 100 mA cm(-2). The durability of the nickel electrode coated with beta-FeOOH nanorods were tested via shutdown-based accelerated durability test, where electrolysis at 600 mA cm(-2) for 1 min and the potential control at 0.5 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for 1 min are repeated in the presence of beta-FeOOH nanorod in the electrolyte. The catalyst coated electrode showed the low OER overpotential for 4000 cycles, whereas the OER overpotential of a bare nickel electrode increased within only 200 cycles. The beta-FeOOH nanorod efficiently suppressed the corrosion of the nickel substrate and the layer of beta-FeOOH nanorod was continuously repaired by accumulating the beta-FeOOH nanorod from the electrolyte. Therefore, the beta-FeOOH nanorod is useful as a self-repairing anode catalyst with high OER activity and durability.[GRAPHICS].									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0928-0707	1573-4846		WOS:000817021500002

A continuously increasing number of molecular catalysts of these reactions, mostly transition metal complexes, have been proposed, rendering necessary procedures for their rational benchmarking and fueling the quest for leading principles that could inspire the design of improved catalysts. The search of "volcano plots" correlating catalysis kinetics to the stability of the key intermediate is a popular approach to the question in catalysis by surface-active sites, with as foremost example the electrochemical reduction of aqueous proton on metal surfaces. We discussed here for the first time, on theoretical and experimental grounds, the pertinence of such an approach in the field of molecular catalysis. This is the occasion to insist on the virtue of careful mechanism assignments. Particular emphasis is put on the interest of expressing the catalysts' intrinsic kinetic properties by means of catalytic Tafel plots, which relate kinetics and overpotential. We also underscore that the principle and strategies put forward for the catalytic activation of the above-mentioned small molecules are general as illustrated by catalytic applications out of this particular field.									44	2	0	0	4	1	44			0002-7863			WOS:000404090100035	28460524

The reasonable design and construction of bifunctional electrocatalysts is the key to energy storage and energy conversion technologies. In this study, transition metal carbon nitrides were used as a substitute for the precious metal catalyst, the Ni-Co-BTC (metal organic framework (MOF)) mixed with polyacrylonitrile (PAN) using electrostatic spinning technology to prepare the bamboo-like nanofibers precursor (Ni-Co-BTC@PAN). A series of electrocatalytic materials (NiCo-X@N-CNFs-Ts, T = 700, 800, 900 degrees C) were synthesized with nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers coated with NiCo alloy nanoparticles using high temperature carbonization at different temperatures. We studied the effects of different calcination temperatures and different Ni/Co molar ratios of NiCo-X@N-CNFs-Ts (T = 700, 800, 900 degrees C) on the bifunctional catalytic performance of the ORR/OER. The composite, NiCo-0.8@N-CNFs-800, exhibited a highly doped-N level, uniform NiCo alloy nanoparticle dispersion and decentralized NiCo-N-x active sites, therefore affording an excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic performance. The ORR onset potential on NiCo-0.8@N-CNFs-800 was 0.91 V and the half-wave potential (E-1/2) was 0.82 V, the NiCo-0.8@N-CNFs-800 corresponded to the minimum potential of 1.61 V at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) among all of the NiCo-X@N-CNFs-Ts hybrids under the OER condition. The NiCo-0.8@N-CNFs-800 catalyst exhibited a low reversible overpotential of 0.79 V between the ORR (E-1/2) and OER (E-j = 10 mA cm(-2)) with excellent stability, durability and methanol tolerance, even surprisingly superior to the commercial Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts. This work provides a general strategy and useful guidance for the design and development of a variety of multifunctional non-noble metal catalysts for energy applications.									45	7	0	0	1	0	45			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000520487300018	32108837

Herein, the unique heterostructures composed of 1D NiMo cores and 2D C3N5 shells (NiMo@C3N5) are rationally designed and demonstrated as the robust HER catalysts in both alkaline electrolytes and natural seawater, where the carbon-based shell can effectively protect the catalyst core from seawater poisoning. Based on the experimental investigation and density functional theory calculation, multiple electronic transmission channels were found to establish at the interface between NiMo cores and C3N5 shells, thus providing efficiently optimized HER pathways to achieve minimized overpotential with a reduced energy barrier of the rate-determining step. More importantly, the NiMo@C3N5 hybrids exhibit stable HER performance with a high Faradaic efficiency of 94.8% in seawater, which is superior to that of commercial Pt/C. All these results can evidently highlight a feasible strategy to develop high-performance HER electrocatalysts via interface engineering.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000779681800001

Among various advanced technologies, electrocatalysis for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a key role and numerous new electrocatalysts have been developed to improve the efficiency of gas evolution. Along the way, enormous effort has been devoted to finding high-performance electrocatalysts, which has also stimulated the invention of new techniques to investigate the properties of materials or the fundamental mechanism of the OER. This accumulated knowledge not only establishes the foundation of the mechanism of the OER, but also points out the important criteria for a good electrocatalyst based on a variety of studies. Even though it may be difficult to include all cases, the aim of this review is to inspect the current progress and offer a comprehensive insight toward the OER. This review begins with examining the theoretical principles of electrode kinetics and some measurement criteria for achieving a fair evaluation among the catalysts. The second part of this review acquaints some materials for performing OER activity, in which the metal oxide materials build the basis of OER mechanism white non-oxide materials exhibit greatly promising performance toward overall water-splitting. Attention of this review is also paid to in situ approaches to electrocatalytic behavior during OER, and this information is crucial and can provide efficient strategies to design perfect electrocatalysts for OER. Finally, the OER mechanism from the perspective of both recent experimental and theoretical investigations is discussed, as well as probable strategies for improving OER performance with regards to future developments.									3191	159	1	0	115	1	3217			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000394561900003	28083578

The oxygen reduction reaction results indicate that Fe2N/NHPCS has the synergistic catalytic performance of higher onset potential (0.96 V), higher electron transfer number (similar to 4) and higher limited current density (1.4 times as high as that of commercial Pt/C). In addition, this material is implemented as the air catalyst for zinc-air battery that exhibits considerable specific capacity (795.1 mA.h/g) comparable to that of Pt/C, higher durability and maximum power density (173.1 mW/cm(2)).									2	1	0	0	0	0	3			1003-6326	2210-3384		WOS:000660035300006

Here, a highly active and stable electrocatalyst for ORR is fabricated by alloying Ni atoms with octahedral N-Pd nanocages with ultrathin walls and exposed (111) facets. The specific activity (3.8 mA/cm(2)) and mass activity (1.17 A/mg(Pt) ) of the octahedral N-Pd-Ni nanocages represent a performance enhancement by a factor of 25 and 10 compared to commercial Pt/C, respectively. In addition, the ORR activity of octahedral N-Pd-Ni nanocages significantly outperforms the octahedral N-Pd nanocages (1.89 mA/cm(2) and 0.73 A/mgp, in specific and mass activity). The ligand effect and compressive strain, confirmed by the X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, accounts for the enhanced activity by weakening the adsorption energy of hydroxyl groups. Particularly, it shows robust stability with only 16% decay in the mass activity after accelerating degradation tests (ADTs), rationalized by its structural stability and high vacancy formation energy. This work provides a new class of N based nanocatalysts with high activity and stability for ORR.									29	4	0	0	2	0	29			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000487931500067		
J	Herwig, F								Dredge-up and envelope burning in intermediate-mass giants of very low metallicity								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				605	1			425	435		10.1086/382200				APR 10 2004	2004	The evolution of intermediate-mass stars at very low metallicity during their final thermal pulse asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase is studied in detail. As representative examples, models with initial masses of 4 and 5 M. and with a metallicity of Z = 0.0001 ([Fe/H] similar to -2.3) are discussed. The one-dimensional stellar structure and evolution model includes time- and depth-dependent overshooting motivated by hydrodynamic simulations, as well as a full nuclear network and time-dependent mixing. Particular attention is given to high time and space resolution to avoid numerical artifacts related to third dredge-up and hot bottom burning predictions. The model calculations predict very efficient third dredge-up that mixes the envelope with the entire intershell layer or a large fraction thereof and in some cases penetrates into the C/O core below the He shell. In all cases primary oxygen is mixed into the envelope. The models predict efficient envelope burning during the interpulse phase. Depending on the envelope-burning temperature, oxygen is destroyed to varying degrees. The combined effect of dredge-up and envelope burning does not lead to any significant oxygen depletion in any of the cases considered in this study. The large dredge-up efficiency in our model is closely related to the particular properties of the H shell during the dredge-up phase in low-metallicity very metal-poor stars, which is followed here over many thermal pulses. During the dredge-up phase, the temperature just below the convective boundary is large enough for protons to burn vigorously when they are brought into the C-rich environment below the convection boundary by the time- and depth-dependent overshooting. H-burning luminosities of 10(5) to similar to2 x 10(6) L. are generated. C, and to lesser degree O, is transformed into N in this dredge-up overshooting layer and enters the envelope. The global effect on the CNO abundance is similar to that of hot bottom burning. If the overshoot efficiency is larger, then dredge-up H burning causes a further increase in the dredge-up efficiency. After some thermal pulses, the dredge-up proceeds through the He shell and into the CO core beneath. Then neutrons may not be released from C-13 in radiative conditions during the interpulse phase because of the scarcity of alpha-particles for the C-13(alpha, n)O-16 reactions. Conditions for the s-process are discussed qualitatively. The abundance evolution of H, He, C, N, O, and Na is described. Finally, the model predictions for sodium and oxygen are compared with observed abundances. The notion that massive AGB stars are the origin of the O-Na abundance anticorrelation in globular cluster giants is not consistent with the model predictions of this study. The abundance of the C-rich extremely metal-poor binaries LP 625-44, CS 29497-030, and HE 0024-2523 is discussed.									99	1	0	0	0	0	99			0004-637X			WOS:000220801700036

In the presence of rGO, the solid source of oxygen (i.e., CuO2) was decomposed (in response to environmental conditions such as pH and temperature) into O-2 NBs in a more controllable and long-lasting trend (from 60 to 144 h). In a neutral buffer, the O-2 NBs experienced growth and collapse evolutions, creating a dynamic micro- nanoenvironment around the nanocomposite. In addition to effective battling against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, the O-2 NBs demonstrated superior antibacterial properties on Gram-positive S. aureus to those on Gram-negative Escherichia coli bacteria, especially in the presence of rGO. In fact, the rGO contents could provide synergistic effects through harvesting some respiratory electrons (leading to striking interruption of the bacterial respiratory pathway) in one side and transferring them into the O-2 NBs, resulting in nanoscale reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in another side. Moreover, near-infrared laser irradiation induced more damage to the cell membrane due to the synergistic effects of local heat elevation and catalyzing the release/collapse of NBs imposing mechanical disruptions. Our results show that the O-2-containing nanoshuttles can effectively be used as intelligent and controllable anti-infection nanorobots in upcoming graphene-based nanobiomedical applications.									51	0	0	0	17	0	51			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000562182900004	32664715	
J	Liu, Guang-Hui; Zong, Zhi-Min; Liu, Fang-Jing; Zheng, Quan-Xi; Li, Ju-Xin; Wei, Xian-Yong								Changes in oxygen functionality of soluble portions and residues from bagasse sub- and supercritical alkanolyses: Identification of complex structural fragments								BIOMASS & BIOENERGY				127						105288	10.1016/j.biombioe.2019.105288				AUG 2019	2019	The changes in oxygen functionality of soluble portions and residues from the bagasse methanolysis (BM) and bagasse ethanolysis (BE) at 220, 240, 260, 280, and 300 degrees C were investigated. The highest yields of soluble portions, 40.8 wt% from BM and 48.1 wt% from BE, can be obtained at 280 degrees C for 0.5 h. The organic oxygen species evolution of the bagasse and residues were analyzed with Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, thermogravimetric analyzer, and X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The results show that the contents of oxygen functional moieties between bagasse and residues are significantly different. The cleavage of > C-al-X bonds (X denotes C-al < , O-, N < , and/or S-), especially > C-al-C-al < and > C-al-O- bonds, should be the major reactions during the bagasse alkanolyses. In addition, based on the analysis with a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer, oxygen-containing organic compounds produced from BM and BE can be divided into alkanols, alkenols, furans tetrahydrofurans, alkyl-substituted phenols & benzenepolyols, methoxy-substituted benzenes, alkoxy-substituted phenols, benzaldehydes, ketones, esters, carboxylic acids, and other oxygenates. The depolymerization of cellulose and/or hemicellulose to pentose/hexose and/or other small-molecule products could facilitate the formation of cyclopentanones and cyclopent-2-enones. The comparison of the specific methyl and ethyl esters obtained from BM and BE, respectively, confirmed that the 4-hydroxyphenyl, 4-methoxyphenyl, guaiacyl, and/or syringyl units are likely present in the bagasse skeleton. Comparing the organic oxygen transformation during the bagasse alkanolyses will facilitate the utilization of oxygenated chemicals in the biomass-derived oils.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0961-9534	1873-2909		WOS:000478564300009

Fe3+ ions are substitutionally doped into the Li sites in an antifluorite-type Li2O structure to create FDL. The FDL consists of (Li0.82Fe0.06)(2)O (d-FDL) and high -temperature form of Li5FeO4 (o-FDL), in which Fe3+ ions disorderly and orderly arranged, respectively. According to the Mossbauer spectra and quantitative peroxide species analysis, the FDL cathode operates principally based on the redox reaction between O-2(2-) and O2-. X-ray diffraction study reveals that the reversible formation of O-2(2-) proceeds mainly in the d-FDL. An irreversible side reaction involving the evolution of oxygen gas occurs when the cathode is charged to more than 250 mAh g(-1). The FDL (Fe/(Li + Fe) = 10 at%) cathode exhibits a reversible capacity of 200 mAh g(-1) over 200 cycles at a current density of 22.5 mA g(-1). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The Li-O-2 batteries on the basis of the La0.6Sr0.4Co1-x Ni (x) O-3 perovskite nanoparticles and non-aqueous electrolytes were also fabricated and measured. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of as-prepared electrodes were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves. The peak current increased in the order of pure Super P, La0.6Sr0.4CoO3, La0.6Sr0.4Co0.95Ni0.05O3, and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.9Ni0.1O3. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements revealed that La0.6Sr0.4Co1-x Ni (x) O-3 catalyst could restrain the increase of impedance during discharge process and promote the decomposition of discharge products during charge process. La0.6Sr0.4Co0.95Ni0.05O3 and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.9Ni0.1O3 catalysts displayed enhanced performances compared with La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 catalyst. The initial capacity of batteries using La0.6Sr0.4Co0.95Ni0.05O3 and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.9Ni0.1O3 as the cathode catalyst displayed enhanced performances compared with La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 catalyst, which was in agreement with the trend of CV curves.									18	3	0	0	0	0	19			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000376670700012

SeWO3 films were electrodeposited on fluorine doped tin oxide coated glass (FTO) support. Then photochemical deposition was employed to modify the surface of produced films with Co-Pi catalyst in order to increase their performance in photo(electrochemical) water splitting. Morphological and (photo)electrochemical properties were identified using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), as well as electrochemical techniques in order to determine photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) and photoconversion efficiency. The results indicated that the presence of cobalt-based catalyst effectively changes the activity of Se-WO3 films: the incident photon-to-current efficiency and photoconversion efficiency increased nearly twice and the onset potential for O-2 evolution in the dark was also shifted towards lower values.									4	1	0	0	0	0	5			0921-5107	1873-4944		WOS:000564521000001

Based on low-cost g-C3N4, finding an abundant co-catalyst with high-performance photocatalytic activity and good stability is one of the solutions to realize overall water splitting. We designed amorphous NiO modified g-C3N4 (NiO/g-C3N4) as a photocatalyst, which could achieve efficient visible-light-driven overall water splitting without a sacrificial agent. After adjusting NiO content and calcination temperature, NiO/g-C3N4 with 1.26 wt% NiO content obtained at 300 degrees C shows optimal overall water splitting performance, with a hydrogen evolution rate of 1.41 mol h(-1) and an oxygen evolution rate of 0.71 mol h(-1) ( 420 nm). NiO/g-C3N4 can be reused at least 7 times (24 h each time). The visible-light-driven overall water splitting performance of NiO/g-C3N4 should be attributed to amorphous NiO as the co-catalyst being able to promote photoinduced electron-hole pair separation, provide active sites and help to decompose generated H2O2.									60	4	0	0	8	0	61			2052-1553			WOS:000438238300019

The macroscopic characteristics of coal spontaneous combustion in relation to functional groups were also analyzed using the thermogravimetric/differential scanning calorimetry-FTIR coupling technique. The experimental results indicated that -OH was the most active groups of coal spontaneous combustion. It not only could react with the absorbed oxygen spontaneously but also found to be the main product of the chemisorption. Consequently, -OH was believed to contribute most both for the loss and increase of coal mass during the process of spontaneous combustion. Aliphatic hydrocarbons were the main components to form -C-O-O-center dot and could be further oxidized into C=O. However, reactions between aliphatic hydrocarbons and oxygen were nonspontaneous. EPR experiments suggested that the tendency of coal spontaneous combustion acutely depended on the stability and survival time of free radicals. The more the stable and longer survival time of free radicals are, the lower the tendency of coal spontaneous combustion is.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2470-1343			WOS:000634542300042	33778277

Herein, we designed a graphite carbon nitride with surface B-N bond (B-x-C3N4) to improve its efficiency. A series of characterizations and DFT calculations show that boron atom replaces carbon atom to form B-N bond, which increase the O-2 adsorption energy from -0.47 eV to -1.17 eV. Moreover, the doped boron atom can be used as the electron capture center to transfer electrons to the N atom, then to the surface adsorbed O-2 through the N-O bond, thus improving the photocatalytic generation of center dot O-2(-) and O-1(2). Finally, the photocatalytic degradation rates of RhB, tetracycline and o-nitrophenol by B-0.05-C3N4 are 12.3, 4.8 and 18.5 times that of pure g-C3N4, respectively. Moreover, the degradation pathway and toxicity prediction of intermediates of RhB are proposed based on the results of HPLC-MS and DFT calculations.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000820186800003		
J	Whatley, F R								Chloroplasts.								Ciba Foundation symposium					31			41	61						1975	1975	Illuminated chloroplast fragments, which can convert light into chemical energy (NADPH2 and ATP), contain a number of soluble and insoluble electron carriers that have been arranged, on the basis of their redox potentials and on kinetic and other evidence, in sequences (analogous to those in mitochondria) to describe the events involved in the light reactions of photosynthesis. Fractionation of chloroplasts allows separation of two light-dependent partial reactions: the evolution of oxygen and the reduction of pyridine nucleotide, accompanied by ATP synthesis. The stoichiometry of the latter reaction is still uncertain. Chloroplasts contain a directional proton-translocating ATPase (CF1) needed for the phosphorylation of ADP in the light. The CF1 also catalyses synthesis of ATP from ADP. When a pH gradient is applied in the dark across the phosphorylating membranes, the amount of ATP synthesized is related to both the change in pH and the electrical potential. During its catalytic activity, the CF1 protein undergoes reversible conformational changes, but this is not the source of the driving force for ATP synthesis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0300-5208			MEDLINE:238809	238809

The oxidation reaction path involves the conversion of the initial beta Hf-Ta BCC solid solution substrate phase into a two-phase monoclinic HfO2 and a Ta rich BCC solid solution reaction layer that undergoes a further reaction between HfO2 and Ta oxide to yield and outer Hf6Ta2O17 superstructure. The overall reactive diffusion pathway is consistent with the calculated Hf-Ta-O ternary phase diagram. The oxidation reaction rate exhibited a minimum at Hf 26.7 at.%Ta where the outer oxide was single phase Hf6Ta2O17. For other compositions the outer oxide was composed of Hf6Ta2O17 and either HfO2 (Hf-rich compositions) or Ta2O5 (Ta-rich compositions). The enhanced oxidation resistance for the Hf-26.7 at.%Ta alloy is attributed to the adherent Hf6Ta2O17 superstructure. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The nucleation and initial growth of inclusion in molten steel during deoxidation as well as the collision growth, motion, removal, and entrapment of inclusions in the molten steel in continuous casting (CC) tundish and strand were discussed. Moreover, the recent studies on the prediction of inclusion composition in CC semiproducts were introduced. Since the 1990s, the development of thermodynamic model and relevant databases for inclusion engineering has been initiated by the steel industry. Later, the commercial software FACTSAGE employing the FACT database was widely used to predict the gas (atmosphere/bubble)-liquid (steel/slag/inclusion)-solid (refractory/slag/steel/inclusion) multiphase equilibria. With the help of the comprehensive thermodynamic database and solution models in conjunction with the development of user-friendly computing packages, the kinetics of inclusion evolution in molten steel can be successfully predicted based on several kinetic models such as the coupled reaction (CR) model, reaction zone model, and tank series recirculation (TSR) model. However, some parameters are needed to represent the real processes according to the model employed at different operational or experimental conditions. The effect of reoxidation on the evolution of inclusions in the ladle and tundish, which was experimentally confirmed, can be simulated by the effective equilibrium reaction zone (EERZ) model. The complex slag-steel interfacial reaction phenomena have been successfully explained by the interfacial kinetic model based on the dynamic interfacial tension and oxygen adsorption/desorption characteristics at the slag-steel interface.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			1073-5615	1543-1916		WOS:000577232100002

Here we report a rapid gel auto-combustion approach for the synthesis of a perovskite/carbon hybrid at a low temperature of 180 A degrees C. The energy-saving synthetic strategy allows the formation of small and homogeneously dispersed La (x) MnO3 +/-delta/C nanocomposites. Remarkably, the synthesized La0.99MnO3.03/C nanocomposite exhibits comparable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity (with onset and peak potentials of 0.97 and 0.88 V, respectively) to the benchmark Pt/C due to the facilitated charge transfer, optimal e(g) electron filling of Mn, and coupled C-O-Mn bonding. Furthermore, the nanocomposite efficiently catalyzes a Zn-air battery that delivers a peak power density of 430 mW center dot cm(-2), an energy density of 837 W center dot h center dot kg(Zn) (-1) and 340 h stability at a current rate of 10 mA center dot cm(-2).									29	4	0	0	1	0	30			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000433048600030

X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis, and Mossbauer spectroscopy showed consistent trends in the structural evolution of these catalysts during reaction. The nearly complete formation of Fe carbides during initial activation in CO was followed by their gradual re-oxidation to form Fe3O4 with increasing time-on-stream. Fe3O4 became the only detectable Fe compound after 450 h. The observed correlation between FTS rates and Fe carbide concentration, and the unexpected re-oxidation of the catalysts as CO conversion decreased, suggest that the deactivation of Fe catalysts in FTS reactions parallels the conversion of Fe carbides to Fe3O4. It appears that the CO activation steps responsible for replenishing carbidic surface species and for removing chemisorbed oxygen are selectively inhibited by deactivation of surface sites, leading to the oxidation of Fe carbide even in the presence of a reducing reactant mixture.

Observational and theoretical studies of the nova outburst								Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference Series				137				352	67						1998	1998	A nova outburst is one consequence of the accretion of hydrogen rich material onto a white dwarf in a close binary system. The strong electron degeneracy of a massive white dwarf drives the temperatures in the nuclear burning region to values exceeding 108 K under all circumstances. As a result, a major fraction of the CNO nuclei in the envelope are transformed into e+-decay nuclei, which constrains the nuclear energy generation and yields non-solar CNO isotopic abundance ratios. In addition, the observations demonstrate that white dwarf core material is dredged up into the accreted layers and these nuclei are the catalysts for producing peak rates of energy generation that can exceed 1016 erg gm-1s-1. Observations show that there are two compositional classes of novae, one that occurs on a carbon-oxygen white dwarf and the other that occurs on an oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarf. The best observed ONeMg nova is V1974 Cyg. Analysis of ROSAT data implies that the mass of the white dwarf is about 1.25 Modot and we describe new hydrodynamic calculations of thermonuclear runaways on 1.25 Modot ONeMg white dwarfs using an upgraded nuclear reaction network and the OPAL opacities. While the characteristics of these simulations are in reasonable agreement with the observations of V1974 Cyg, the amount of mass ejected is at least a factor of 10 less than observed. We suggest a solution for this discrepancy.

Combining experimentation and characterization, it was discovered that Z-scheme heterojunction and the local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect to construct dual-channels for charge carrier transferring that not only accelerate the separation and transfer efficiency of electron-hole pairs, but also maintain high redox reaction capacity. Meanwhile, the unique 3D hierarchical structure can improve the adsorption capacity and widen the light response range. Moreover, comparative experiments prove that the coordination of Z-scheme heterojunction and oxygen vacancy promotes molecular oxygen activation to generate more ROS (center dot O-2(-) and center dot OH), which is further beneficial for the photocatalytic activity. As a result, BiOBr/BiOIO3 highest photocatalytic removal of heavy metal mercury under visible light can achieve 90.25%. This study provides a new direction to design efficient photocatalysts for promising solar utilization and environmental purification.									115	4	0	0	29	0	115			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000551969200083

However, the rational design of active catalysts has been hampered by the lack of understanding of the mechanism of water electrolysis on perovskite surfaces. Key parameters that have been overlooked include the role of oxygen vacancies, B-O bond covalency, and redox activity of lattice oxygen species. Here we present a series of cobaltite perovskites where the covalency of the Co-O bond and the concentration of oxygen vacancies are controlled through Sr2+ substitution into La1 - xSrxCoO3 - delta. We attempt to rationalize the high activities of La1 - xSrxCoO3 - delta through the electronic structure and participation of lattice oxygen in the mechanism of water electrolysis as revealed through ab initio modelling. Using this approach, we report a material, SrCoO2.7, with a high, room temperature-specific activity and mass activity towards alkaline water electrolysis.									557	20	0	0	48	0	565			2041-1723			WOS:000372721700001	27006166

The oxygen carrier (OC) was investigated under alternating oxidizing and reducing conditions in a fixed bed reactor simulating the cyclic conditions of CLC. The study of the operating temperature influence reveals that total reduction capacity increases with temperature, due to the reaction of the binder NiAl2O4. Regeneration step performed under low oxygen concentration (5 vol.%) shows that the decrease in total reduction capacity during multiple cycles is minimized and the purity of produced CO2 is higher. Therefore, carrying out the regeneration step at lower oxygen concentrations can increase oxygen carrier lifetime. Characterization studies revealed the formation of a nickel rich layer at the surface (up to 20 mu m thick at 900 degrees C) and a partial sintering of particles regenerated under 20 vol.% of oxygen. However, these phenomena are not observed on the particles regenerated under low oxygen concentration. The formation of this layer can be explained by the fact that nickel oxidation is carried out by migration of Ni2+ cations through the layer of NiO initially oxidized at the surface of the particle, the layer becomes thicker during cycles, because NiO does not return to its initial position. At higher temperature, the diffusion velocity increases and therefore the layer formed is thicker.Specific surface area of the oxygen carrier decreases as cycles number increases from 9.4 m(2)/g for the fresh material to 4.4 and 2.3 m(2)/g after thirty cycles at 750 degrees C and 900 degrees C respectively. The same trend is observed for porous volume. However, the decrease is lower when particles are regenerated under low oxygen concentration (6 m(2)/g). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It is very ingenious that DMF is selectively coordinated with Pt ions, thus greatly bridging the deposition potential gap between Pt and Co, and promoting the formation of alloy catalysts. The optimal Pt4Co alloy sample exhibits a remarkable specific activity as high as 1.52 mA . cm(-2) Pt at 0.9 V (vs. RHE) towards the ORR, 7 times of that for the commercial Pt/C catalyst. It is believed that the remarkable ORR electrocatalytic activity is mainly ascribed to the synergetic effect from two aspects dealing with a DMF selective coordination with Pt ions as well as the generation of highly porous Pt-rich surfaces.

As several hundred tons of catalysts are annually deactivated by deposition of carbon, herein, we came up with a en strategy to reutilize spent methane reforming catalysts that were deactivated by the formation of graphitic carbon (GC) land carbon nanofibers (CNF). An electrocatalyst was successfully synthesized by in situ deposition of noble metal-free MoS2 over spent catalysts via a hydrothermal method that showed exceptional performance regarding the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). At l 25 mA cm -2, phenomenal OER overpotentials (r/25) of 128 and 154 mV land modest HER overpotentials of 186 and 207 mV were achieved for MoS2@CNF and MoS2@GC, respectively. Moreover, OER Tafel slopes of 41 and 71 mV dec-1 and HER Tafel slopes of 99 and 107 mV dec-1 were obtained for IVIoS,@CNF and MoS2@GC, respectively. Furthermore, the synthesized catalysts exhibited, good long-term durability for about 18 h at 100 pA cm-2 with unnoticeable changes in the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve of the IHER after 1000 cycles. The carbon on the spent catalyst increased the conductivity, while IVIoS2 enhanced the electrocatalytic activity; hence, the synergistic effect of both materials resulted in enhanced electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. This work of synthesizing enhanced nanostructured electrocatalysts with minimal usage of inexpensive MoS, gives a rationale for engineering potent greener electrocatalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2470-1343			WOS:000691300900012	34471736

Gold and silver nanoparticles (AuNPs and AgNPs, respectively) formed in a chloroformic environment are used, as model synthetic systems, to study the phenomena of morphological change. The morphological evolution of NPs that follows their formation, is characterized by spectroscopy (UV-visible, Raman and FTIR) and TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy). The change of NP morphology involves the increase of the average NP size and the broadening of size distribution, in a close resemblance with the effect characteristically obtained from the Ostwald ripening. The effect of the poor solvating properties of chloroform in stabilizing small charged species (H+, Ag+, Au+) as well as the principle of electroneutrality of matter are analyzed in order to formulate a feasible reaction scheme consisting of a three-step process: the generation of soluble intermediary species by corrosion of nanoparticles, the diffusion of intermediary species from one nanoparticle to another, and the re-deposition process involving the reduction of intermediary species. This basic reaction scheme is used as a hypothesis to plan and perform experiments, which reveal that molecular oxygen dissolved in the dispersive medium can drive NP corrosion, however, protic species are also required as co-reactants. The polarity of the hydrogen bond and the ligand properties of the anions produced by de-protonation are features of the protic species that enable/disable corrosion and, in turn, the NP morphological evolution.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2				2046-2069		WOS:000365581700011	26889378

It is well known that the increase of SiH4/O-2 flow ratio R results in degradation of oxide quality. We have found that the critical flow ratio can be estimated from the analysis of the difference between gas pressures with and without plasma. The evolution of optical properties of the films shows that the critical value obtained from pressure measurements gives a good indication of the limits for the deposition of optical quality SiO2.

However, the high overpotential, sluggish reaction dynamics and low stability of electrode materials are the main barriers in developing an excellent catalyst for the anodic electro-oxidation process. To overcome such problems, we developed an easy synthesis root for the preparation of novel mesoporous (MP) Co3O4 and NiCo2O4 using a template-free hydrothermal and subsequent annealing method. In which, we used diethylenetriamine as a complexing agent, which was able to control crystal growth of corresponding metal hydroxide, leading to the formation of a mesoporous structure. Results show that the MP-NiCo2O4 exhibits a current density of 10.0 mA cm(-2) even at a lower potential (286 mV vs. Ag/AgCI) for methanol oxidation reaction compared to that of MP-Co3O4. On the other hand, both MP-Co3O4 and MP-Co3O4 display excellent electrocatalytic activity towards water oxidation with lower onset potential and overpotential (MP-Co3O4 eta(10)=302 mV and MP-Co3O4 eta(10)=322 mV). The excellent electrochemical performance suggests that this mesoporous MP-Co3O4 and MP-Co3O4 could be potential candidates for energy and environmentally related applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The supports were used to prepare Pt catalysts (Pt/XWC-C) for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) in alkaline solution. Prepared XWC-C revealed highly dispersed tungsten carbide species composed of WC and W2C phases. The tungsten carbide species proved to have a positive effect on the dispersion of Pt particles. Compared to the Pt catalyst supported on carbon (Pt/ C), Pt/XWC-C showed higher ORR performance. In addition, the catalytic performance of Pt/XWC-C was enhanced with increasing tungsten carbide content. The highest ORR activity was achieved for the Pt/30WC-C catalyst, which had a 2.9-fold enhanced performance (at 0.8V vs. RHE) compared to that of Pt/C. It is believed that the unique interaction between Pt and the tungsten carbide species was responsible for the enhanced ORR performance of the Pt/XWC-C catalysts.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			0256-1115	1975-7220		WOS:000406393800005

Two mechanisms have been proposed to interpret the formation of the planar defects. One is related to the diffusion of oxygen vacancies because of thermal-driven release of oxygen atoms in vacuum and the consequent crystallographic shear of alpha-MoO3. The other is associated with redox reactions of moisture and/or hydrocarbons that give rise to HxMoO3 precipitates. Here, we report that regularly spaced (302) planar defects can be introduced into alpha-MoO3 belt crystals by heating in liquid sulfur at 300 degrees C. These defects are undetectable by both atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy at the crystal surface. Raman scattering enhancement and weakening have been observed for different phonon modes of alpha-MoO3 at the (302) planar defects as probed from the (010) surface. Their comparisons with the Raman scattering enhancements at the edges and the argon-plasma-induced Raman spectral evolutions of the as-grown alpha-MoO3 belt crystals provide new insights into the planar defects with regard to their formation and characteristics.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0743-7463			WOS:000451245800023	30365315

Advanced catalysts can capture and accelerate the liquid-solid conversion of polysulfides. Herein, we try to make use of bismuth tantalum oxide with oxygen vacancies as an electrocatalyst to catalyze the conversion of LiPSs by reducing the sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) nucleation energy barrier. Oxygen vacancies in Bi4TaO7 nanoparticles alter the electron band structure to improve instinct electronic conductivity and catalytic activity. In addition, the defective surface could provide unsaturated bonds around the vacancies to enhance the chemisorption capability with LiPSs. Hence, a multidimensional carbon (super P/CNT/Graphene) standing sulfur cathode is prepared by coating oxygen vacancies Bi4TaO7-x nanoparticles, in which the multidimensional carbon (MC) with micropores structure can host sulfur and provide a fast electron/ion pathway, while the outer-coated oxygen vacancies with Bi4TaO7-x with improved electronic conductivity and strong affinities for polysulfides can work as an adsorptive and conductive protective layer to achieve the physical restriction and chemical immobilization of lithium polysulfides as well as speed up their catalytic conversion. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of different components, the S/C@Bi3TaO7-x coin cell cathode shows superior cycling and rate performance. Even under a high level of sulfur loading of 9.6 mg cm(-2), a relatively high initial areal capacity of 10.20 mAh cm(-2) and a specific energy density of 300 Wh kg(-1) are achieved with a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 3.3 mu L mg(-1). Combined with experimental results and theoretical calculations, the mechanism by which the Bi4TaO7 with oxygen vacancies promotes the kinetics of polysulfide conversion reactions has been revealed. The design of the multiple confined cathode structure provides physical and chemical adsorption, fast charge transfer, and catalytic conversion for polysulfides.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2079-4991		WOS:000874372700001	36296742

The as-prepared products were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), (high-resolution) transmission electron microscopy (TEM/HRTEM) and HAADF-STEM-EDS elemental mapping. Experiments showed that the as-obtained Fe-doped Co-Mo-S microtube catalyst demanded overpotentials of similar to 105 and 268 mV to afford the current density of -10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a durability of 60 h in 1.0 M KOH solution, respectively. In a two-electrode water-splitting device, the as-prepared Fe-doped Co-Mo-S microtubes acted as both anode and cathode simultaneously. To deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a cell voltage of 1.605 V was required in 1.0 M KOH solution. After continuously catalyzing the overall water splitting for 60 h, the overpotential hardly changed, implying remarkable long-term stability. Obviously, the present Fe-doped Co-Mo-S microtubes have potential applications as bifunctional catalysts for electrochemical water splitting.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000589506700029	33094763

The process entails an in situ assembly of 2D WSe2 nanosheets and NiFe-LDH nanosheets on a 3D N,S-codoped graphene framework, accomplished by a facile hydrothermal method and electrostatic self-assembly technology. The obtained nanocomposite architecture maximizes synergistic effects among its three 2D-layer components. To assess the performance of this hybrid material, we deployed it as an advanced electrode in overall water splitting and in a supercapacitor. Results in both scenarios attest to its excellent electrochemical properties. Specifically, serving as a catalyst in an oxygen evolution reaction, our nanocomposite requires overpotentials of 1.48 and 1.59 V to obtain current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. The hybrid material also efficiently electrocatalyzes hydrogen evolution reactions in base solution, necessitating overpotentials of 50 and 237 mV for current densities of 1.0 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. The 3D hybrid, when applied to a symmetric supercapacitor device, achieves 125.6 F g(-1) capacitance at 1 A g(-1) current density. In summary, our study elucidates a new strategy to maximize efficiency via synergetic effects that is likely applicable to other 2D materials.									48	3	0	0	0	0	48			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000412149800038	28880075

One of the key challenges to its industrialization is the lack of efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution at the anode, especially when the operating temperature is pushed to its lower limit. Here we present advances to tackle this challenge by taking the advantages of the charge transfer dynamics in the junction RuO2/perovskite, which enable the high SOEC performance at reduced temperatures. At 1.6 V and 600 degrees C, the modified SOEC delivers a current density of similar to 2.26 A cm(-2), and such high performance is maintained after 90 h. Most importantly, we substantially demonstrate the built-in charge transfer in the junction RuO2/perovskite and disclose the electron donation from the Co-O bonding orbitals to the RuO2 cluster. Overall, this work demonstrates a step change in the design of confined electrodes for reduced temperature SOEC, and it provides a general strategy for the functionalization of solid state material.									21	4	0	0	0	0	21			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000458419000018

However, the low activity and inferior selectivity of 2 e(-) ORR greatly restrict the H2O2 production efficiency. Herein, we develop a new strategy to synthesize hydrophilic, fragmented PCN photocatalyst by the terminating polymerization (TP-PCN) effect of iodide ions. The obtained TP-PCN with abundant edge active sites (AEASs), which can form quasi-homogeneous photocatalytic system, exhibits superior H2O2 generation rate (3265.4 mu M h(-1)), far surpassing PCN and other PCN-based photocatalysts. DFT calculations further indicate that TP-PCN is more favorable for electron transiting from beta spin-orbital to the pi* orbitals of O-2, which optimizes O-2 activation and reduces the energy barrier of H2O2 formation. This work provides a new concept for designing functional photocatalysts and understanding the mechanism of O-2 activation in ORR for H2O2 production.									75	8	0	0	12	0	78			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000709284900001	34535960

Tris-trifluoroacetylacetonate-rutheniumIII (Ru(tfa)(3)) served as the precursor. Film properties, such as resistivity, were improved by the addition of water to the reaction gas. The films were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and four-probe resistivity measurements. The growth mechanism was studied by in situ ellipsometry, and a model reaction mechanism is proposed. The electrochemical characterization by cyclic voltammetry revealed very small overpotentials for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution. Thee properties of the films, in particular the resistivity (rho as low as 72 mu Omega cm), are comparable to CVD and sputtered films deposited at much higher temperatures.									11	0	0	0	0	0	25			0948-1907			WOS:000088725200006

However, high overpotential (>1 V) is required for pristine TiB2 to drive water splitting, which is less than satisfactory in future hydrogen economy. Herein, conductive polypyrrole (PPy) encapsulating TiB2 (TiB2@PPy) has been developed via vapor phase polymerization, as the electrocatalyst for HER. Theoretically, the PPy shell serves both as electron-transfer channels to accelerate electron migration, and as Mott-Schottky centre to modify the electronic structure of TiB2. Beneficially, more improved HER performance has been achieved with the overpotential of 432 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), superior to that of pristine TiB2 (848 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)). Moreover, excellent stability is presented during 1000 CV cycles and 10 h constant evaluation. Our study provides a new avenue to create efficient HER electrocatalyst via conductive PPy engineering.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000493217800109

Exposure of plants growing outdoors to successive chilling nights caused light- and CO2 saturated photosynthetic O-2 evolution to decline to zero within 5 d. Plants recovered after four warm nights. These photosynthetic responses were confirmed in potted plants, even when roots were heated. The inhibitory effects of chilling were greater after a period of illumination, probably because transpiration induced higher water deficit. Stomatal closure only accounted for part of the inhibition of photosynthesis. Fluorescence measurements showed no evidence of photoinhibition, but nonphotochemical quenching increased in stressed plants. The most characteristic response to both stresses was an increase in the ratio of electron transport to net O-2 evolution, even at high external CO2 concentrations. Oxygen isotope exchange revealed that this imbalance was due to increased O-2 uptake, which probably has two components: photorespiration and the Mehler reaction. Chilling- and drought-induced water stress enhanced both O-2 uptake processes, and both processes maintained relatively high rates of electron flow as CO2 exchange approached zero in stressed leaves. Presumably, high electron transport associated with O-2 uptake processes also maintained a high Delta pH, thus affording photoprotection.									111	15	1	0	106	4	128			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000083134700039	10517860

Whereas, nickel phosphides (NixPy) possess more than ten stoichiometric compositions with different crystalline. Constructing NixPy with well crystalline and revealing their intrinsic catalytic mechanism at atomic/molecular levels remains a great challenge. Herein, an easy-to-follow phase-controllable phosphating strategy is first proposed to prepare well crystalline NixPy (Ni3P and Ni12P5) modified CdS@Ni3S2 heterojunction electrocatalysts. It is found that Ni3P modified CdS@Ni3S2 (CdS@Ni3S2/Ni3P) exhibits remarkable stability and bifunctional electrocatalytic activities in both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Density functional theory results suggest that P-Ni sites and P sites in CdS@Ni3S2/Ni3P, respectively, serve as OER and HER active sites during electrocatalytic water splitting processes. Moreover, benefiting from the advantageous photocatalyst@electrocatalyst core@shell structure, CdS@Ni3S2/Ni3P delivers an advantaged photoassisted electrocatalytic water splitting property. The champion electrical to hydrogen and solar to hydrogen energy conversion efficiencies of CdS@Ni3S2/Ni3P, respectively, reach 93.35% and 4.65%. This work will provide a general guidance for synergistically using solar energy and electric energy for large-scale H-2 production from water splitting.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			2366-9608			WOS:000703075700001	34927978

To overcome the extreme sensitivity of charge transport to catalyst thickness, we proposed the iron valence state regulating on hematite to negatively shift the surface defect state, thereby suppressing the severe OEC charging. In detail, a fluorine layer (FeOxFy) was inserted between Fe2O3 and OEC (ZIF-67) to reduce the oxidation state of iron atoms, forming a case where only part of Co(II) can be oxidized (build a rapid Co(II)/Co(III) cycle). Even in the case of thicker OEC (similar to 10 nm), Fe2O3@F@ZIF-67 exhibits increased photocurrent density of 2.56 mA cm 2 at 1.23V(RHE) (similar to 170% higher than Fe2O3@ZIF-67), accompanied by a rapid decrease in sensitivity to OEC loading. Above pretreatment not only relaxed the catalyst process requirements, but also provide new insights into interfacial catalysis process.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000595294100001

Herein, a systematic study of the structures of molybdenum carbides and the related HER mechanism have been carried out based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The electronic properties and surface energies of three typical crystals of molybdenum carbides, i.e., alpha-MoC, beta-MoC and gamma-Mo2C, have been analyzed. It is shown that all the systems considered exhibit metallic behavior, among which the beta-MoC (110) plane is the most active facet with the largest surface energy (3.159 J.m(-2)). By comparing the Gibbs free energies, Delta G(H), we find that the (111) surface of beta-MoC has the smallest Delta G(H) of 0.089 eV, which is even superior than Pt-like catalysts, V8C7 (-0.114 eV), VC (- 0.191 eV) or MoO2 (0.15 eV).									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0038-1098	1879-2766		WOS:000450122900006

Herein, a unique electrochemical corrosion engineering strategy is developed via electrochemically transforming metal solid substrates (iron foil and nickel foam) into a highly active NiFe oxide film for oxygen evolution, rather than directly utilizing metal ion precursors. This synthesis involves electrochemical corrosion of a Fe foil in an aqueous electrolyte along with electrochemical passivation of Ni foam (NF). The released trace Fe ions gradually incorporate into passivated NF surfaces to construct Ni-Fe oxide film and crucially improve composition distribution in the catalyst film. As a result, the resulted film with an ultralow mass loading (0.22 mg cm(-2)) delivers large current densities of 500 mA cm(-2) at overpotential of only 270 mV in 6.0 M KOH at 60 degrees C, outperforming many reported NiFe catalysts requiring much higher mass loadings. More interestingly, the as-prepared catalyst almost reaches the standard (500 mA cm(-2) within the overpotential of 300 mV) in commercial water electrolysis with long-term stability for at least 10 h. This work may provide a unique synthesis strategy for nonprecious transition-metal catalysts for desirable water splitting and can be expanded to many other electrocatalysis systems.									27	0	0	0	0	0	27			1944-8244			WOS:000453488900040	30403336

Herein, a facile strategy was developed to synthesize efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts, based on mononuclear iron phthalocyanine supported on commercially available multi-walled carbon nanotubes that contain electron-donating functional groups (FePc/CNT-R, with "R" being -NH2, -OH, or -COOH). These functional groups acted as axial ligands that coordinated to the Fe site, confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and synchrotron-radiation-based X-ray absorption fine structure. Experimental results showed that FePc/CNT-NH2, with the most electron-donating -NH2 axial ligand, exhibited the highest ORR activity with a positive onset potential (E-onset=1.0 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) and half-wave potential (E-1/2=0.92 V). This was better than the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst (E-onset=1.00 V and E-1/2=0.85 V) under the same conditions. Overall, the functionalized FePc/CNT-R assemblies showed enhanced ORR performance in comparison to the non-functionalized FePc/CNT assembly. The origin of this behavior was investigated using density functional theory calculations, which demonstrated that the coordination of electron-donating groups to FePc facilitated the adsorption and activation of oxygen. This study not only demonstrates a series of advanced ORR electrocatalysts, but also introduces a feasible strategy for the rational design of highly active electrocatalysts for other proton-coupled electron transfer reactions.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000741464400001	34904388

Conventional RFBs are charged and discharged electrochemically, with electricity stored as chemical energy in the electrolytes. In the RFB system reported here, the electrolytes are conventionally charged but are then chemically discharged over catalytic beds in separate external circuits. The catalytic reaction of particular interest generates hydrogen gas as secondary energy storage. For demonstration, indirect water electrolysis was performed generating hydrogen and oxygen in separate catalytic reactions. The electrolyte containing V(II) was chemically discharged through proton reduction to hydrogen on a molybdenum carbide catalyst, whereas the electrolyte comprising Ce(IV) was similarly discharged in the oxidation of water to oxygen on a ruthenium dioxide catalyst. This approach is designed to complement electrochemical energy storage and may circumvent the low energy density of RFBs especially as hydrogen can be produced continuously whilst the RFB is charging.									76	3	1	0	5	0	79			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000337977600027

Dealloying process is adopted to generate the geometric strain in Pt3Co/C alloy by preferential dissolution of non-noble metal (Co) from the alloy. The developed geometric strain has been estimated by different microstructural characterization techniques. Electrochemical studies showed that the highest current density for HER was obtained for Pt3Co/C dealloy catalyst and it was nearly 2 and 5 times higher than Pt3Co/C alloy and Pt/C respectively. Tafel slope for HER was improved from 49 (Pt/C) to 34 mV dec(-1) (Pt3Co/C dealloy), indicating that the surface strain plays important role in the improvement of the catalytic activity of Pt3Co catalyst. The chronoamperometry data, LSV curves and ECSA values before and after chronoamperometry confirmed that Pt3Co/C dealloy catalyst was a stable as well as a durable electrocatalyst for HER.									17	2	0	0	1	0	18			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000431387500030

The effects on reactivity for hydroquinone oxidation in aqueous phosphate buffer are shown to be linked to microporosity causing a slightly lower rate of mass transport without detrimental effects on electron transfer and reaction kinetics. Next, water-insoluble microcrystalline anthraquinone is immobilised directly into the PIM-7 film and shown to give a chemically reversible reduction process, which is enhanced in the presence of PIM-7, when compared to the case of anthraquinone immobilised directly onto bare glassy carbon. Electrodeposition of a film of nano-palladium is demonstrated to give catalytically active electrodes for the reduction/oxidation of protons/hydrogen, the reduction of oxygen, and for the oxidation of formic acid and methanol. With the PIM-7 film applied onto palladium, a mechanical stabilisation effect occurs. In addition, both the hydrogen insertion and the hydrogen evolution reactions as well as formic acid oxidation are enhanced.

J	Chhiti, Younes; Peyrot, Marine; Salvador, Sylvain								Soot formation and oxidation during bio-oil gasification: experiments and modeling								JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY				22	5			701	709		10.1016/S2095-4956(13)60093-5				SEP 2013	2013	A model is proposed to describe soot formation and oxidation during bio-oil gasification. It is based on the description of bio-oil heating, devolatilization, reforming of gases and conversion of both char and soot solids. Detailed chemistry (159 species and 773 reactions) is used in the gas phase. Soot production is described by a single reaction based on C2H2 species concentration and three heterogeneous soot oxidation reactions. To support the validation of the model, three sets of experiments were carried out in a lab-scale Entrained Flow Reactor (EFR) equipped with soot quantification device. The temperature was varied from 1000 to 1400 degrees C and three gaseous atmospheres were considered: default of steam, large excess of steam (H2O/C = 8), and the presence of oxygen in the O/C range of 0.075-0.5. The model is shown to accurately describe the evolution of the concentration of the main gas species and to satisfactorily describe the soot concentration under the three atmospheres using a single set of identified kinetic parameters. Thanks to this model the contribution of different mechanisms involved in soot formation and oxidation in various situations can be assessed.									23	6	0	0	1	0	25			2095-4956			WOS:000325595700004

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) can be defined as a class of isolated metal atoms that are either atomically dispersed or coordinated with neighboring surface atoms of an appropriate support. Unlike nanoparticles or bulk materials, SACs offer unique characteristics which turn them as superior candidate for various catalytic applications. This review aims to summarize recent advances in various synthetic approaches and characterization techniques used to design different SACs. After this overview, we focus our discussion on single atom-2D support interactions, followed by recent progress in single atom incorporated 2D catalysts for water splitting applications, which includes both electrocatalytic and photocatalytic hydrogen production. Finally, we summarize the current challenges and the future outlook exists for the rational design of single atom based new catalyst with high catalytic activity, better stability and selectivity for various sustainable energy conversion applications.

The anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is always coupled with these reactions in devices but suffers from large energy barriers. Thus, it is important for developing efficient OER catalysts with low overpotential. On the other hand, there are large amounts of metals in electronic waste (E-waste), especially various transition metals that are promising alternatives for catalyzing OER. Hence, this work, which focuses on upcycling Class II BaTiO3 Multilayer Ceramic Capacitors, of which two trillion were produced in 2011 alone. We achieved this by first using a green solvent extraction method that combined the ionic liquid Aliquat (R) 336 and hydrochloride acid to recover a mixed solution of Ni, Fe and Cu cations, and then using such a solution to synthesize high potential catalysts NiFe hydroxide and NiCu hydroxide for OER. NiFe-hydroxide has been demonstrated to have faster OER kinetics than the NiCu-hydroxide and commercial c-RuO2. In addition, it showed promising results after the chronopotentiometry tests that outperform c-RuO2.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2079-4991		WOS:000839699600001	35957128

The as-prepared catalyst was a highly porous structure with large active surface area, thereby effectively promoting the catalytic activities towards HER. The catalyst exhibited a small overpotential of 74 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH medium, lower than other synthesized materials. The catalyst also showed a small Tafel slope of 55 mV dec(-1) and long-term HER strength of 15 h at 20 mA cm(-2). The excellent electrochemical behavior was primarily derived from the enhanced charge transfer and intrinsic activities of phases after Pt being inserted into structure of zinc phosphides. This study could offer an efficient approach for the synthesis of HER electrocatalysts in water splitting application.									3	1	0	0	1	0	3			0025-5408	1873-4227		WOS:000581707700012

Despite decades of commercial maturity, however, alkaline water electrolyzers continue to suffer from limitations in electrocatalytic activity and stability, even with noble metal catalysts. In recent years, combining platinum with oxophilic materials, such as metal hydroxides, has shown great promise for improving performance potentially by enabling stronger water dissociation at the surface of electrocatalysts. In this work, we leveraged the nanoscopic proportions and surface programmability of the filamentous M13 bacteriophage in the design, synthesis, and exceptional performance of 3D nanostructured biotemplated electrocatalysts for alkaline hydrogen evolution. We developed a facile synthesis method for phage-templated, Pt-Ni(OH)(2) nanonetworks, relying on scalable techniques like electroless deposition. After optimization of the platinum content, our materials display -4.9 A mg(Pt)(-1) at -70 mV versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, the highest reported mass activity in 1M KOH to date, and undergo minimal changes in overpotential under galvanostatic operation at -10 mA cm(geo)(-2).Looking forward, the performance of these catalysts suggests that biotemplating nanostructures with M13 bacteriophage offers an interesting new route for developing high-performing electrocatalysts.									38	2	0	0	4	0	37			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000461433600021

The sintered ceramics showed a tetragonal perovskite structure, irrespective of the added graphite content. The added graphite formed the interstitial solid solutions with Ba0.999Sb0.001TiO3 and was distributed homogeneously in the sintered ceramics. The grain size of the as-sintered graphite-containing BaTiO3-based ceramics was much larger than that of the as-sintered graphite-free ones. This is mainly due to the exothermic reactions of the graphites and oxygen molecules in the ceramics. The porosity of the as-sintered ceramics increased with increasing graphite content due to an enhanced evolution of CO and CO2 gases associated with the exothermic reactions. It was found that the newly prepared porous graphite-containing BaTiO3-based PTC thermistors showed a large PTCR effect. (C) 2003 Ellsevier B.V.

As a highly efficient HER catalyst, Mo-based catalysts have attracted much attention. Annealing is an indispensable part of the preparation of molybdenum-based HER catalysts, but easy to polymerize during carbonization, resulting in lower HER performance of product. Herein, we report the synthesis of molybdenum carbide N&C-doped (Mo2C@CN) with layered mesoporous structure as HER electrocatalyst. This structure can solve the problem of HER performance due to polymerization. The Mo2C@CN is obtained simply by two steps. Benefiting from the structure and doped of N&C, Mo2C@CN exhibits abundant electrochemically active site and outstanding stability. To attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4, with overpotentials of 202 mV, Tafel slopes of 69 mV dec(-1). Little overpotential decay shows its striking stability (2000 cycles) in the acid media.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000474477800009

However, the mechanism of the catalytic effect on hydrogen evolution of NiO and Ni(OH)(2) needs further investigation because of the high risk in self-reduction with photo-induced electrons. In this work, the self-reduction of Ni2+ was confirmed during the photocatalytic H-2 evolution in the CdS/Ni(OH)(2) hybrid materials. Meanwhile, in situ formed metallic Ni plays an important role in the increase in the catalytic activity. Fortunately, only a few photo-induced electrons participate in the reduction of Ni2+ in CdS/Ni(OH)(2) hybrid materials. The existence of metallic Ni would prevent more Ni2+ from self-reduction. The synergistic effect of Ni(OH)(2) and metallic Ni contributes to the improvement of H-2 evolution of CdS nanorods.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0021-9606	1089-7690		WOS:000539392200001	32505154

The texture and morphology of CeO2 films were examined by X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy. Results show that CeO2 films with preferred (00l) orientation have been obtained in Ar-4%H-2 with flow rate greater than 1.95 x 10(-3) m/s. The crystalline degree and texture degree of CeO2 films are strongly dependent on flow rate of reducing gas. Moreover, the larger flow rate of reducing gas is helpful to the formation of single-phase CeO2 film and the decrease of RMS of CeO2 films. The texture and microstructure evolution of CeO2 thin film is related to the oxygen vacancies concentration in CeO2 lattice.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000342157500062

However, the sluggish water dissociation kinetics even on platinum-based electrocatalysts result in poor hydrogen-production activities. Here we report a structurally ordered Ir3V catalyst for efficiently catalyzing HER in alkaline media. The ordered Ir3V catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 9.0 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte with Ir loading of 19 mu g cm(-2), corresponding a mass activity of 1200 A g(Ir)(-1) at the overpotential of 20 mV, which is 6.7, 9.4, and 3.3 times greater than that of the commercial Pt/C, Ir/C, and disordered Ir3V catalysts. The enhanced HER kinetics is ascribed to the charge redistribution on the ordered Ir3V surface with the maximized number of neighboring bimetallic Ir/V sites compared to the disordered solid solution counterpart, which promotes the water dissociation on the electron-deficient V sites.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000639191300018

The following results were obtained: (a) In dark-adapted samples with a highly populated S1 state, NH2R leads via a dark reaction sequence to the formal redox state "S-1"; (b) the reaction mechanism is different between the NH2R species; NH2OH acts as a one-electron donor, whereas NH2NH2 mainly functions as a two-electron donor, regardless of the interacting redox state S(i) (i = 0, ..., 3). For NH2NH2, the modified oxygen oscillation patterns strictly depend upon the initial ratio [S0(0)]/[S1(0)] before the addition of the reductant; while due to kinetic reasons, for NH2OH this dependence largely disappears after a short transient period. (c) The existence of the recently postulated formal redox state "S-2" is confirmed not only in the presence of NH2NH2 [Renger, G., Messinger, J., & Hanssum, B. (1990) in Current Research in Photosynthesis (Baltscheffsky, M., Ed.) Vol. 1, pp 845-848, Kluwer, Dordrecht] but also in the presence of NH2OH. (d) Activation energies, E(A), of 50 kJ/mol were determined for the NH2R-induced reduction processes that alter the oxygen oscillation pattern from dark-adapted thylakoids. (e) Although marked differences exist between NH2OH and NH2NH2 in terms of the reduction mechanism and efficiency (which is about 20-fold in favor of NH2OH), both NH2R species exhibit the same order of rate constants as a function of the redox state S(i) in the nonperturbed water oxidase: kNH2R(S0) > kNH2R(S1) << kNH2R(S2) >> kNH2R(S3) The large difference between S2 and S3 in their reactivity toward NH2R is interpreted to indicate that a significant change in the electronic configuration and nuclear geometry occurs during the S2 --> S3 transition that makes the S3 state much less susceptible to NH2R. The implications of these findings are discussed with special emphasis on the possibility of complexed peroxide formation in redox state S3 postulated previously on the basis of theoretical considerations [Renger, G. (1978) in Photosynthetic Water Oxidation (Metzner, H., Ed.) pp 229-248, Academic Press, London].									94	1	0	0	71	0	94			0006-2960			WOS:A1991FZ96500027	1868061

N-doping in the felt was mainly in the form of pyrrolic and pyridinic nitrogen. Even though the amount of oxygen functional groups on the N-2-plasma-treated sample was very low, the felt showed enhanced electrochemical performance for both V3+/V2+ as well as V5+/V4+ redox reactions. The result is highly significant as the pristine electrode with the same amount of oxygen functional groups showed significantly less activity for the V3+/V2+ redox reaction. Overall, the single-flow cell experiments with N-2-plasma-treated felt showed superior performance compared to the pristine sample. Therefore, the enhanced performance observed for the N-2-plasma-treated sample should be attributed to the increase in defects and edge sites. Thus, from the present study, it can be concluded that an alternate way to increase the performance of the VRFBs is to introduce specific defects such as N-doping/substitution or to increase the edge sites. In other words, defects induced in the carbon felt such as heteroatom doping are as beneficial as the presence of oxygen functional groups for the improved performance of VRFBs. Therefore, for an optimum performance of VRFBs, defects such as N-substitution as well as oxygen functionality should be tuned.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2190-4286			WOS:000481503200001	31501741

RAPET procedure involves the utilization of reactive gases formed during the pyrolysis of unsupported cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) in a closed stainless steel vessel without the flow of any gases from external source, temperatures of 900 degrees C and estimated pressure of 2.5 x 10(7) Pa. X-ray diffraction patterns and XPS of CCoPc-900 (CoPc heat treated at 900 degrees C by RAPET) indicate the formation of metallic phases of cobalt. These materials are found to catalyze oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline solution. CCoPc-900 exhibited an improved electroactivity toward ORR in comparison to CCoPc-700 (CoPc heat treated at 700 degrees C by RAPET) and CCoPc-900-OV (CoPc heat treated at 900 degrees C in an open vessel under nitrogen flow). The oxygen reduction in the above-said carbonized materials proceeds through the formation of hydrogen peroxide followed by further reduction to water. Using RRDE (rotating ring disk electrode) experiments, we show that the ORR kinetics on CCoPc-900 is marginally better than CCoPc-900-OV. (C) 2016 The Electrochemical Society.

The morphology and Mo content were affected by varying the duty cycle between 70% and 30%, obtaining twice the Mo content and a more globular structure in the NiMo alloys prepared with a 30% duty cycle. The material presented a crystalline structure with peaks corresponding to the Ni (111) and (200) planes, which are independent of the duty cycle used. The cyclic voltammetry analysis showed a remarkable increment of the exchange current density when increasing the Mo content. This effect was attributed to changes in the electronic structure related to the nanostructure of the material. All the NiMo alloys analyzed showed activation to hydrogen evolution reaction after ageing, being that obtained at 30% duty cycle the one that showed the highest one. By analysis of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, we found for duty cycle 70% a behaviour similar to that of NiMo synthesized by direct current techniques. In that catalyst, two processes were observed at different potentials while the NiMo30% catalyst shows several electrochemical processes occurring. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, improving the sluggish kinetics for HER in alkaline media is crucial for advancing the performance of water-alkali electrolyzers. Here, we demonstrate a dramatic enhancement of HER kinetics in base by judiciously hybridizing vertical MoS2 sheets with another earth-abundant material, layered double hydroxide (LDH). The resultant MoS2/NiCo-LDH hybrid exhibits an extremely low HER overpotential of 78 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and a low Tafel slope of 76.6 mV/dec in 1 M KOH solution. At the current density of 20 mA/cm(2) or even higher, the MoS2/NiCo-LDH composite can operate without degradation for 48 hr. This work not only brought forth a cost-effective and robust electrocatalyst, but more generally opened up new vistas for developing high-performance electrocatalysts in unfavorable media recalcitrant to conventional catalyst design.									263	19	0	0	16	0	268			2542-4351			WOS:000425180300020

In this study, we developed the zero-valence iron based catalytic technique by synthesizing regular zero-valence iron microspheres (ZVI MPs), which could completely remove the CAP pollutant (20 mg L-1) within 15 min. When the CAP concentration increased to 50 mg L-1, the removal efficiency achieved to 95.5% after 15 min of reaction. The chemical evolutions of iron species on the catalyst surface and changes in components of the solution demonstrated the activation of molecular oxygen and hydrogen ion by ZVI MPs. The generation of( center dot)OH and H-center dot radicals as well as their contributions to CAP degradation were confirmed by electron spin resonance and trapping experiments during the reaction. Further experiments including the intermediates identification revealed a possible degradation pathway. To the best of our knowledge, the mechanism of CAP degradation by ZVI was proposed for the first time involving both reductive and oxidative transformations with a prerequisite of efficient reductive dechlorination. The complete dechlorination of CAP molecules was confirmed by the detection of inorganic Cl- concentration (0.124 mmol L-1 after reaction), which generally lowered the toxicity of the products. These findings not only provided an efficient and economic zero-valent iron technique for eliminating the antibiotic pollutants in water, but also made important contributions to better understand the removal mechanism.									33	2	0	0	12	0	34			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000483451200074

H is generated primarily by photolysis of water vapor and participates in a highly exothermic reaction with ozone. This reaction is a significant source of heat in the mesopause region and also creates highly vibrationally excited hydroxyl (OH) from which the Meinel band radiative emission features originate. Concentrations (cm(-3)) and volume mixing ratios of H are derived from observations of infrared emission from the OH (upsilon = 9+8, Delta upsilon = 2) vibration-rotation bands near 2.0 mu m made by the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument on the NASA Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics satellite. The algorithms for deriving day and night H are described herein. Day and night concentrations exhibit excellent agreement between 87 and 95 km. SABER H results also exhibit good agreement with observations from the Solar Mesosphere Explorer made nearly 30 years ago. An apparent inverse dependence on the solar cycle is observed in the SABER H concentrations, with the H increasing as solar activity decreases. This increase is shown to be primarily due to the temperature dependence of various reaction rate coefficients for H photochemistry. The SABER H data, coupled with SABER atomic oxygen, ozone, and temperature, enable tests of mesospheric photochemistry and energetics in atmospheric models, studies of formation of polar mesospheric clouds, and studies of atmospheric evolution via escape of hydrogen. These data and studies are made possible by the wide range of parameters measured simultaneously by the SABER instrument.									30	0	1	0	0	0	31			2169-897X	2169-8996		WOS:000336046600048

This study presents a facile defect-tailoring strategy for combined pollutants purification with BiVO4 photocatalysis in which the jointed synchronous reaction of oxidation and reduction is integrated instead of the sequential reaction in two individual systems. XPS and EPR reveal that BiVO4 with a suitable oxygen vacancies (OVs) concentration and distribution exhibits superior photocatalytic activity under the coexistence of TC-HCl and Cr(VI) with Cr(VI) reduction efficiency increased by 71 times compared with the individual Cr(VI) system along with TC-HCl removal efficiency comparable to a single TC-HCl system. The mechanism of synchronous redox reactions mediated by surface OVs is revealed by comprehensive characterization together with reaction kinetic analysis, and the electronic band structure adjustment induced by the OVs variation is confirmed. Active species identification tests and intermediate product analysis confirm that singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) accounts for the selective oxidation of TC-HCl, while electrons dominate the reduction of Cr(VI), under a coexistent environment. The influence of water quality parameters (e.g., pH, cations, anions, and organic substances) on the photocatalytic activity is investigated considering the complexity of the real aquatic environment. Importantly, toxicity assessment with Gram-negative strain E. coli as a model bacterium validates that the toxicity of the intermediates can be reduced to low or even ultralow levels. This work is dedicated to the mechanistic study of defect photocatalysis over BiVO4 and provides a jointed synchronous reaction system for combined pollutant purification.									17	0	0	0	9	0	17			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000643578300041	33847119

The complex hydrogeological system of this basin has been conceptualized. Multivariate statistical analysis of hydrochemical variables and water isotopes were used to study the rock-water interaction, geochemical reaction processes and the hydrological link between aquifers. Groundwaters from aquifers of the high-rainfall plateau bounding the rift are slightly mineralized, as well as depleted in delta O-18 and delta D, and contain H-3 above 0.8 TU. This suggests a low degree of rock-water interaction and that groundwater is under recharge from heavy rain that falls on surrounding highlands. On the other hand, groundwaters from aquifers of the rift floor are highly mineralized and show slight enrichment in delta O-18 and delta D with positive oxygen shift, but contain H-3 below 0.8 TU. The positive oxygen shift in rift floor groundwaters may be caused by the isotopic exchange of oxygen between groundwater and aquifer materials during rock-water interaction, whereas the low H-3 content could be due to the decay of tritium along relatively long flow paths. The approach utilized in this study may be applicable to understanding hydrogeochemical processes in other complex volcanic terrains.									27	0	0	0	11	1	27			1431-2174	1435-0157		WOS:000300584200012

However, the instability of the supported transition-metal (TM) atoms hampers their widespread applications. Exploration of an appropriate substrate to stabilize the supported single atom is crucial for the future implementation of SACs. In recent years, two-dimensional materials have been proposed as possible substrates due to their large specific surface areas, but their chemically inert surfaces are difficult to stabilize TM atoms without defecting or doping. Herein, by means of systematic first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the defect-free MoS2 monolayer in the unconventional phase (1T') can effectively immobilize single TM atoms owing to its unique electrophilic property as compared to the conventional 2H phase. As a prototype probe, we investigated oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyzed by a total of 21 single TM atoms stabilized on 1T'-MoS2 and successfully screened out two candidates, Cu and Pd@1T'-MoS2, which have a low overpotential of 0.41 and 0.32 V respectively, outperforming most of the previously reported ORR catalysts. Furthermore, we reveal that the adsorption energy of the ORR intermediate, *OH, provides an excellent descriptor to assess the ORR activity, which is further determined by the d-band center of the supported TM adatoms, thus being a great advantage for future design of stable and high-performance SACs.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000643578300024	33844514

Mass loading was controlled by changing the sputter deposition time. A cauliflower-like columnar microstructure was achieved by depositing the Pt-TFs onto a microporous layer (MPL)-like surface composed of carbon particles in order to mimic catalyst-coated gas diffusion electrodes. Microstructural evolution of HIPS Pt-TFs and their ORR activity were investigated. Electrochemical characterization of the nanocolumnar Pt-TFs was performed by cyclic voltammetry and rotating disk electrode measurements on Pt-TF/MPL-like-layer/glassy-carbon samples in an aqueous perchloric acid electrolyte. The electrochemically active surface area increased from 18 to 39 m(2)g(-1)as the Pt mass loading was decreased. Specific activity of the films was similar (similar to 600 mu A cm(-2)) for all Pt mass loadings, due to the similar nanoparticle sizes of similar to 5 nm as observed by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Mass activity of the films increased from 0.11 to 0.26 A mg(-1)as the Pt mass loading was decreased, which is an indication of the effective Pt utilization and better access through the catalyst layer at lower Pt mass loadings.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000578333200001

Here, we creatively report the first preparation of immiscible Ru-based alloys (RuRE-rGO NPs, RE=Gd, Er, Yb, La) with ~5 nm by solvent-free microwave reduction. Additionally, in alkaline electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), RuGd-rGO NPs performed admirable (eta = 12 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), TOF=30.6 H-2 s(- 1) at 0.1 V), which also can be stable for 500 h even if it provides industry-related current density of 500 mA cm(-2). Density functional theory further indicates that from initial to final state of the reaction, RuGd-rGO NPs have large exothermic energy (-1.34 eV), while the dissociation energy barrier of H2O is relatively low, causing the most likely occurrence of HER. This work provides sufficient space for the synthesis of ultra-small immiscible nano-alloy supported catalysts.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000787895000004

It was found that gas evolution and/or liquid film can play important roles in the oscillatory electrodissolution of gold, in addition to the solid film of gold oxides as previously recognized. Oscillatory electrodissolution of gold in bromide media is given here for the first time with two cases: (i) current oscillations only with lower concentrations of bromide (0.5 M, M = mol dm(-3)) and sulfuric acid (0.2 M) in the narrow potential range of active-passive transition and (ii) oscillations both in potential and in current with moderate concentrations of bromide (1 M) and sulfuric acid (1 M). The depletion and replenishment of Br- surface concentration by reactions under diffusion control and by convection through periodic oxygen evolution, respectively, account for the potential oscillations. Whereas the variation of available electrode surface area results in the irregular current oscillations due to the formation-removal of liquid bromine film rather than the periodic oxygen evolution. In addition, we first show both potential and current oscillations in concentrated HCl (8 M). The depletion and replenishment of the surface Cl- concentration involving also periodic gas evolution are the main reasons for the potential oscillations like case (ii) in the Br--containing solution. Two kinds of current oscillations were found relating the active-passive transitions (like case (i)) and the Cl- depletion-replenishment with periodic gas evolution, respectively. The current oscillations can transform from the former to the latter ones with a positive potential scan. Some preliminary explanations have been given on the mechanism of the oscillatory electrodissolution with the help of the crossed cyclic voltammagrams (CVs) and in situ Raman spectra.

The materials were characterized by PXRD, XPS, UV vis DRS, IR, PL, and Raman analysis. The photocatalytic activities of as synthesized samples were studied toward reduction of Cr(VI) and water splitting reaction to generate oxygen. The results reveal that Type II p-n heterojunction considerably enhance the photocatalytic activity as compared to neat n-type BiVO4 and p-type B-doped g-C3N4. 50% BiVO4/B-doped g-C3N4 heterostructure exhibited the best photocatalytic activity, which is 7.9-fold higher than that of BiVO4 and followed by a pseudo first order kinetics with apparent first order rate constant of 0.063 min(-1). Again the heterojunction is able to produce 4.2 times higher oxygen evolution value as related to pristine BiVO4. The superior photocatalytic activity is attributed to higher visible light utilization and lower recombination of electron-hole pairs by creating a p-n junction. PXRD and HRTEM data suggest the formation of mixed phase monoclinic and tetragonal BiVO4 thereby creating a heterojunction for the improvement of the photocatalytic performances. The formation of mixed-phase BiVO4 is attributed to the high temperature calcination as well as surface energy of B-doped g-C3N4. The oxygen vacancy in the system is confirmed through XPS and Raman analysis. Moreover, the excellent photocurrent response by the designed photocatalyst at lower overpotential and decrease in carrier recombination as compared to bulk one, studied from LSV and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, validate the unique photocatalytic activity of the catalyst. The formation of the p-n heterojunction is confirmed from a Mott-Schottky analysis. The work shed new light on the assembly of the p-n heterojunction, showing excellent photocatalytic properties in a simple way.									57	0	0	0	2	0	57			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000486565600068	31460751

Heating BBSC in air to over 800 degrees C produces a pure cubic phase with space group Fm (3) over barm (no. 225), and cooling down below 800 degrees C leads to a mixture of three noncubic phases including an unknown phase between 200 and 650 degrees C, a 2H hexagonal BaCoO3 with space group P63/mmc (no. 194) between 600 and 800 degrees C, and an intermediate phase at 800 degrees C. These three phases exist concurrently with the major cubic phase. The weight gain and loss between 300 and 900 degrees C suggest the occurrence of cobalt reduction, oxidation, and disproportion reactions with dominant reduction reaction at above 600 degrees C. The thermal expansion of BBSC was also examined by dilatometry. BBSC has a highly temperature-dependent thermal expansion coefficient which relates well with its structure evolution. Furthermore, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of BBSC was probed by symmetrical cell and three-electrode configurations. The presence of hexagonal phase at 700 degrees C rarely affects the ORR performance of BBSC as evidenced by a slight increase of its area-specific resistance (ASR) value following 48 h of testing in this three-electrode configuration. This observation is in contrast to the commonly held point of view that noncubic phase deteriorates performance of perovskite compounds (especially in oxygen transport applications). Moreover, cathodic polarization treatment, for example, current discharge from BBSC (tested in three-electrode configuration), can be utilized to recover the original ORR performance. The cubic structure seems to be retained on the cathodic polarization-the normal cathode operating mode in fuel cells. Stable 72-h performance of BBSC in cathodic polarization mode further confirms that despite the presence of phase impurities, BBSC still demonstrates good performance between 500 and 700 degrees C, the desired intermediate operating temperature in solid oxide fuel cells.									42	1	0	0	0	0	43			0897-4756			WOS:000288291400036

Experimental studies indicated that the formation of oxygen vacancies was highly dependent with the thermal treatment atmosphere. Vacuum treatment was favorable for the generation of surface hydroxyl groups, which contributed to the interfacial extraction of holes. In contrast, air calcinations benefited the formation of surface defects. The enhanced charge separation resulted in the remarkably improved photoactivity for SMX degradation.									10	1	0	0	3	0	11			1566-7367	1873-3905		WOS:000450376900008

Water electrolysis, is considered as one of the most promising ways to realize large-scaled hydrogen production. However, a big obstacle of it is to reduce the electric energy consumption for water oxidation in the anode. Engineering of hierarchical architectures on the electrocatalysts could provide abundant active sites and thus boost the sluggish reaction kinetics of water oxidation. Herein, a sequential synthesis method is developed for in-situ growth of ultrathin Co9S8 nanosheets vertically aligned on N and S co-doped reduced graphene oxide (Co9S8/N,S-rGO) as novel and efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting. This architecture with vertically aligned ultrathin Co9S8 nanosheets on N,S/rGO is adopted to facilitate the electron transport and exposure of active sites. Benefiting from the synergetic catalysis between Co9S8 nanosheets and N,S/rGO, Co9S8/N,S-rGO presents remarkable electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution with a low overpotential (266 mV to achieve current density of 10 mA cm(-2)), small Tafel slope of 75.5 mV dec(-1), and good durability in alkaline medium. This remarkable OER electrocatalytic activity is outperforms most of the known noble-metal-free electrocatalysts.									22	2	0	0	3	0	22			2045-2322			WOS:000458572500012	30760753

These changes are similar to those which take place in the course of progressive evolution of functions of the central nervous system, respiratory and cardio-vascular systems in onto- and phylogenesis. On the basis of this parallelism, it is concluded that the initial (pre-toxic) effect of hyperoxia results in the increase of the activity of evolutionary younger functional systems of the brain. During the continuous effect of hyperoxia, oxygen intoxication of the organism takes place, which include particularly dissolution phenomena in the activity of the brain. These phenomena are most evident during the development of pre-seizure and seizure periods.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0044-4529			MEDLINE:7124206	7124206

Herein the inhibition effect of positively charged substituents on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was reported. With the use of Cu porphyrins 1-5 containing different numbers and locations of positively charged substituents, it was demonstrated that their electrocatalytic HER activities significantly decreased when more cationic units were located close to the Cu ion: the i(cat)/i(p) (i(cat) is the catalytic peak current, i(p) is the one-electron reduction peak current) value decreased from 38 with zero cationic unit to 15 with four closely located cationic units. Inspired by this result, Cu porphyrin 6, with four meso-phenyl groups each bearing a negatively charged para-sulfonic substituent, was designed. With these anionic units, 6 outperformed the other Cu porphyrins for electrocatalytic HER under the same conditions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000760776900001	35156337

To be successful, cathode materials that are robust enough to overcome the sluggish kinetics of the charge-discharge reactions are essential. This work reports sonochemically synthesized porous MnCo2O4/graphene (MCO/G) as a hybrid cathode material in nonaqueous Li-O-2 batteries. The MCO/G hybrid is synthesized in less than four hours and offers a strong synergistic coupling between the MnCo2O4 nanospheres and graphene sheets. It catalyzes the oxygen reduction through a three-electron-transfer process and initiates the oxygen evolution at 1.55 V vs. RHE in basic medium. A small charge-discharge voltage hysteresis of 0.8 V and a cycle life of 250 cycles at a limited capacity of 1000 mAh g(-1) in a tetraglyme-based nonaqueous Li-O-2 battery is demonstrated. The porous channels created on the sonochemically synthesized cathode facilitates easy oxygen adsorption onto the active sites to accommodate more discharge products following its decomposition. It exhibits a better rate capability in comparison to the widely used Vulcan carbon and benchmark Pt/C catalysts. The excellent cyclability, rate capability, and low overpotential demonstrates MnCo2O4/graphene composite as a promising cathode candidate for Li-O-2 batteries. The porous nanosphere architecture with internal oxygen diffusion pathways and peripheral conductive graphene extensions fulfils the requirements that a robust cathode is expected to have to overcome the harsh Li-O-2 battery conditions and to serve as a high-rate-capable cathode for Li-O-2 batteries.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000451233400020	30176089

The comparison of morphology and electrochemical properties between Ti/SnO2-Sb-Ce and Ti/SnO2-Sb electrodes was conducted. It was found that the Ti/SnO2-Sb-Ce electrodes had smaller sizes of coating grains, higher overpotential for oxygen evolution, and better electrocatalytic activity than the Ti/SnO2-Sb electrodes. The current efficiency was only 25% for degradation of 500 mg L-1 Orange II on the Ti/SnO2-Sb electrode at a charge loading of 5.4 Ah L-1, but increased to 47% on the Ti/SnO2-Sb-Ce electrode under the same conditions.

The graphene is prepared by thermal decomposition of ethylene molecules pre-adsorbed on an Ru( 0001) surface in an ultra-high vacuum chamber. The graphene layer presents a periodically rippled structure that is dictated by the misfit between graphene and Ru(0001) lattice parameters. The periodic ripples produce spatial charge redistribution in the graphene and modifies its electronic structure around the Fermi level. In order to investigate the reactivity of graphene we expose graphene islands to a partial pressure of oxygen and following the evolution of the surface by STM during the exposure. For the exposure to air we removed the sample from the UHV chamber and we re-introduce it after several hours, taking STM images before and after. The surface areas not covered by the graphene islands present a dramatic change but the graphene structure, even the borders of the islands, remain intact. In the case of a complete graphene monolayer the exposure to oxygen or to air does not affect or destroy the rippled structure of the graphene monolayer.									40	1	0	0	3	0	40			0953-8984			WOS:000264118900003	21817477

In this study, we have designed an efficient method to produce ultrathin carbon nanosheets (similar to 2.2 nm) with multi-heteroatom (nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur) doping and a high surface area (up to 1198 m(2) g(-1)). This method employs poly(cyclotriphosphazene-co-4,4'-sulfonyldiphenol) (PZS) as the main carbon source and N,P,S-doping sources, while g-C3N4 nanosheets act as the morphology template, extra N doping source and porogen. The doped carbon nanosheets are an excellent metal-free carbocatalyst for selective oxidation of aromatic alkanes in aqueous solution and electrochemical catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction in an alkaline medium.									78	7	0	0	4	0	80			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000390083200031

The delicate architecture can efficiently accelerate the separation and migration of photo-excited electrons, make the surface potential more negative, enhance thermodynamic H-2 evolution reaction, and offer rich active planes for photo-catalytic redox reactions. Based on these highlighted photo-catalytic benefits, the optimal composite exhibits more prominent photo-catalytic hydrogen evolution performance compared with NiTiO3 or CoAl LDH materials alone under visible irradiation. In detail, the stereoscopic catalyst, constructed by phosphating CoAl LDH layers anchored on NiTiO3 hollow rods, exhibits a hydrogen evolution activity of about 594 mu mol 5 h(-1), which is 11.6 times and 14.8 times that of CoAl LDH (51 mu mol 5 h(-1)) and NiTiO3 (40 mu mol 5 h(-1)) alone, respectively. Also, the density functional theory results reveal the good conductivity, which is beneficial for charge migration in the hybrid sample. The results from the thoroughly conducted characterization studies such as TEM, SEM, XPS, XRD, UV-vis DRS, transient photocurrent, and FTIR spectroscopy have been well researched and they are in good agreement with each other.									35	1	0	0	1	0	36			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000534338900017

However, under hash electrochemical conditions, (1) supports' surfaces may experience structural change, which turn to be distinct from those at ambient conditions; (2) during catalysis, the dynamic responses of a single atom to the attack of reaction intermediates likely change the coordination environment of a single atom. These factors could alter the performance of SACs. Herein, we investigate these issues using Mo2C(100)-supported single transition-metal (TM) atoms as model SACs toward catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). It is found that the Mo2C(100) surface is oxidized under ORR turnover conditions, resulting in significantly weakened bonding between single TM atoms and the Mo2C(100) surface (TM@Mo2C(100)_O* term for SAC). While the intermediate in 2 e(-) ORR does not change the local structures of the active centers in these SACs, the O* intermediate emerging in 4 e(-) ORR can damage Rh@ and Cu@Mo2C(100)_O*. Furthermore, on the basis of these findings, we propose Pt@Mo2C(100)_O* as a qualified ORR catalyst, which exhibits extraordinary 4 e(-) ORR activity with an overpotential of only 0.33 V, surpassing the state-of-the-art Pt(111), and thus being identified as a promising alternative to the commercial Pt/C catalyst.									3	0	0	0	0	0	2			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000641156600109	33787216

Therefore, they are considered as suitable alternatives to Pt as catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction. Herein, self-supported amorphous CuMoS(x)and NiMoS(x)nanosheet arrays are prepared on copper foam (CF) and nickel foam (NF), respectively, through an anion-exchange strategy. CF and NF are first converted into CuTCNQ and NiTCNQ nanowire arrays (TCNQ = tetracyanoquinodimethane), which are then in situ reacted with (NH4)(2)MoS(4)solution to generate amorphous CuMoSx/CF and NiMoSx/NF nanosheets, respectively, as efficient electrocatalysts for H(2)generation. NiMoSx/NF exhibits a superior catalytic activity to CuMoSx/CF in 0.5 mH(2)SO(4)solution, as CuMoSx/CF requires overpotentials (eta) of 213 and 275 mV to obtain current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm(-2), respectively, whereas NiMoSx/NF only requires eta of 174 and 248 mV to receive the same current densities, respectively. Furthermore, these electrodes exhibit considerable long-term electrochemical durability. Herein, an effective and easy-to-operate strategy for the construction of self-supported metal-molybdenum sulfide nanosheet arrays films toward a highly efficient electrochemical hydrogen generation reaction is provided.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000562397300001

Electrodes were prepared using the thermal decomposition procedure (T-calc.=470degreesC; t(calc.)=1h), with x varied between 0 and 1, changed in 0.1 steps. Kinetics were studied recording quasi-stationary current-potential curves and reaction order determined with respect to H+ and Cl-. A constant Tafel slope of about 33 mV was found for the 0-80 mol% RuO2 concentration interval, increasing to 40 mV for higher RuO2 contents. Experimental data support the mechanism originally proposed by Erenburg et al. for the ClER. The edge effect exerts an influence on the electronic transfer coefficient values. Analysis of the electrocatalytic activity reveals an increase in the apparent electrocatalytic activity for the mixed oxides.									14	1	0	0	0	2	14			0103-5053			WOS:000183002000008

A detailed investigation of film morphology, structure, and chemical surface state using SEM, XRD, and XPS, respectively, was carried out to understand catalytic activity, which was assessed using cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry. Iron was seen to be fully incorporated into the parent rocksalt NiO lattice during microplasma deposition, and overpotentials (eta) decreased from 360 mV for NiO to 310 mV for Ni1-xFexO at 10 mA cm(-2). Interestingly, overpotential did not change significantly for Fe compositions from 5-19%. The Ni1-xFexO films displayed relatively low Tafel slopes of 20-30 mV dec(-1) at 0.01-1 mA cm(-2), demonstrating their high activity for (OER). Turn-over-frequency (TOF, i.e., O-2 molecules per Ni atom per s) at eta = 350 mV revealed a continuous improvement in activity of the NiO surface with increasing Fe content, where values of 0.07 and 0.48 s(-1) were measured for undoped NiO and Ni0.81Fe0.19O films, respectively. Chronopotentiometry measurements followed by SEM and XPS verified that the as-deposited Ni1-xFexO catalysts were mechanically and chemically stable for OER under alkaline conditions. This work highlights that microplasma-based deposition is a general approach to realize conformal coatings of nanostructured, doped oxides with high activity for OER.									43	0	0	0	1	0	43			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000412940000036	28967664

The degradation of the DI protein is preceded by photoinhibition of the electron transport in photosystem II. There are two distinct mechanisms for this: acceptor-side- and donor-side-induced photoinhibition. Here, donor-side-induced photoinhibition was studied in photosystem II membranes after Cl- depletion or washing with tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) which destroys water oxidation, reversibly or irreversibly, respectively. Photoinhibition after these treatments leads to fast degradation of the D1 protein, and the mechanism behind this was investigated, Illumination of Cl- depleted photosystem II membranes resulted in a rapid and simultaneous inhibition of Cl--reconstitutable oxygen evolution, loss of 2 Mn ions per photosystem II center, increase in the electron transfer between the electron donor diphenylcarbazide and electron acceptor 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol, and an increase in the EPR signal IIfast from tyrosine-Z(ox). The destruction of the Mn cluster leads to the loss of oxygen evolution and to an increased accessibility for diphenylcarbazide to donate electrons to Tyr-Z(ox). The increase in the EPR signal from Tyr-Z(ox) can be explained by slower reduction kinetics of Tyr-Z(ox) due to the Mn release. On a longer photoinhibition time scale, a decrease in the amplitude of Tyr-Z(ox) and inhibition of the electron transport from diphenylcarbazide to 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol occurred simultaneously in both Cl--depleted and Tris-washed photosystem II membranes. These slower photoinhibition reactions were then studied in detail in Tris-washed photosystem II membranes. Compared to photoinhibition of Tyr-Z(ox), the EPR signal from tyrosine-D-ox decreased much slower. Tyr-D-ox was photoinhibited in parallel with the EPRsignals from reduced Q(A), reduced pheophytin, and an oxidized chlorophyll radical (chlorophyll(Z)), This shows that the acceptor side components and the primary charge separation reaction (P680(+) pheophytin(-)) were operational although Tyr-Z was inactivated. The amount of the D1 protein also declined in parallel with Tyr-D-ox, which shows that the D1 protein is not damaged until long after the Mn complex and Tyr-Z have become inactivated. Instead, it is likely that the strongly oxidizing P680(+) is responsible for the damage to the D1 protein.									30	0	0	0	25	1	31			0006-2960			WOS:A1996UR90400020	8672480

It is composed of three main sections: electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen evolution catalysts, oxygen evolution catalysts, and semiconductor electrodes. The semiconductor section is divided into two parts: photoanodes and photocathodes. Photoanodes include n-type semiconductor electrodes that can perform water oxidation to O-2 using photogenerated holes, while photocathodes include p-type semiconductor electrodes that can reduce water to H-2 using photoexcited electrons. For each material type, deposition mechanisms were reviewed first followed by a brief discussion on its properties relevant to electrochemical and photoelectrochemical water splitting. Electrodeposition or electrochemical synthesis is an ideal method to produce individual components and integrated systems for PECs due to its various intrinsic advantages. This review will serve as a good resource or guideline for researchers who are currently utilizing electrochemical synthesis as well as for those who are interested in beginning to employ electrochemical synthesis for the construction of more efficient PECs.									401	17	1	0	24	0	405			0009-2665	1520-6890		WOS:000366339200007	26538328

It was shown that Sc2O3 was successfully composited with MPT. Compared with MPT electrode, Sc2O3-MPT composite electrode had less spherical particles and more pores. Linear scanning voltammetry indicated that Sc2O3-MPT composite electrode presented higher oxygen evolution overpotential than MPT electrode, suggesting that Sc2O3-MPT electrode was much more suitable for the degradation of MO. The electrocatalytic degradation of MO was evaluated under different parameters including current density, temperature, initial pH and electrolysis time. Under the optimal parameters (current density 10 mA cm(-2), temperature 25 degrees C, initial pH 3 and electrolysis time 120 min), the degradation efficiency of MO on Sc2O3-MPT composite electrode reached up to 90.16%. All these results demonstrated that Sc2O3-MPT composite electrode was effective for electrocatalytic degradation of MO and had a great potential application in the treatment of dyes wastewater.

The conclusion is that the central role of disrupted pancreatic glutathione status, as a result of 'xenobiotic stress', in the evolution of chronic pancreatitis cannot be overestimated. This position contrasts with that in acute pancreatitis, in which glutathione depletion has a pivotal role too, but occurs as a result of 'stress' from reactive oxygen species.

We provide (1) a brief review of how photosynthesis works, (2) an overview of the diversity of photosynthetic organisms, their light harvesting systems, and environmental ranges, (3) a synthesis of photosynthetic surface spectral signatures, and (4) evolutionary rationales for photosynthetic surface reflectance spectra with regard to utilization of photon energy and the planetary light environment. We found the "near-infrared (NIR) end" of the red edge to trend from blue-shifted to reddest for (in order) snow algae, temperate algae, lichens, mosses, aquatic plants, and finally terrestrial vascular plants. The red edge is weak or sloping in lichens. Purple bacteria exhibit possibly a sloping edge in the NIR. More studies are needed on pigment-protein complexes, membrane composition, and measurements of bacteria before firm conclusions can be drawn about the role of the NIR reflectance. Pigment absorbance features are strongly correlated with features of atmospheric spectral transmittance: P680 in Photosystem H with the peak surface incident photon flux density at similar to 685 nm, just before an oxygen band at 687.5 nm; the NIR end of the red edge with water absorbance bands and the oxygen A-band at 761 nm; and bacteriochlorophyll reaction center wavelengths with local maxima in atmospheric and water transmittance spectra. Given the surface incident photon flux density spectrum and resonance transfer in light harvesting, we propose some rules with regard to where photosynthetic pigments will peak in absorbance: (1) the wavelength of peak incident photon flux; (2) the longest available wavelength for core antenna or reaction center pigments; and (3) the shortest wavelengths within an atmospheric window for accessory pigments. That plants absorb less green light may not be an inefficient legacy of evolutionary history, but may actually satisfy the above criteria.									199	3	2	0	110	2	206			1531-1074	1557-8070		WOS:000245724900010	17407409

A series of Bi2Mo3O12/Bi2MoO6 heterostructures with different phase ratios were readily prepared by tuning the concentration of the molybdenum precursor while retaining the same bismuth precursor concentration. The Bi2Mo3O12/Bi2MoO6 heterojunction was found to substantially enhance the photocatalytic water oxidation capability relative to neat Bi2Mo3O12 and Bi2MoO6. The Bi2MoO6 and Bi2Mo3O12 were found to possess a complementary band alignment between which enabled the charge transfer process across the heterojunction interface. Ag and MnOx photodeposition was conducted on the heterostructures to affirm the charge transfer direction between the two crystal phases. Under visible light irradiation, photo-generated holes transfer from the active Bi2MoO6 phase to the inactive Bi2Mo3O12, suggesting efficient charge separation occurs between the two components, explaining the better photocatalytic performance.									37	4	0	0	3	0	37			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000441527900063

However, its high cost and limited availability demand that IrO2 is utilized as efficiently as possible. We report the synthesis and OER performance of highly active mesoporous IrO2 catalysts with optimized surface area, intrinsic activity, and pore accessibility. Catalytic layers with controlled pore size were obtained by soft-templating with micelles formed from amphiphilic block copolymers poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(butadiene)-b-poly(ethylene oxide). A systematic study on the influence of the calcination temperature and film thickness on the morphology, phase composition, accessible surface area, and OER activity reveals that the catalytic performance is controlled by at least two independent factors, that is, accessible surface area and intrinsic activity per accessible site. Catalysts with lower crystallinity show higher intrinsic activity. The catalyst surface area increases linearly with film thickness. As a result of the templated mesopores, the pore surface remains fully active and accessible even for thick IrO2 films. Even the most active multilayer catalyst does not show signs of transport limitations at current densities as high as 75mAcm(-2).									93	1	0	0	5	0	92			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000355839300012	25958795

Psb30 protein is found in cyanobacterial photosystem II (PSII) core complexes and is dispensable for PSII structure and function. The most recent three-dimensional structure of cyanobacterial PSII core complex has revealed that Psb30 is located in proximity of PsbJ, PsbK, and PsbZ. However Psb30 has not yet been detected in PSII complexes from eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms. Here we found the expression of the chloroplast psb30 gene in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by immunoblotting and Psb30 is exclusively co-purifies with PSII core complex and is significantly reduced in PSII-deficient mutants. Partial disintegration of PSII core complex and subsequent fractionation of the resulting subcomplexes revealed that Psb30 is exclusively associated with PSII reaction center. We have generated chloroplast transformants in which the psb30 gene is disrupted and the resulting Delta Psb30 cells showed decreased oxygen evolution activity by 15%, grew photosynthetically under moderate light, and displayed increased sensitivity to high light relative to wild type. We conclude that Psb30 is a PSII reaction center subunit and is required for optimal PSII function under high light environments. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, we developed a bubbling reactor along with its modelling, and we used it with the aforementioned photosystem to measure the actual rate of reaction (R-O2) over time. In the present work, the same method is employed to investigate the kinetics of the reaction occurring through several steps, i.e. not only water oxidation, but also parasitic reactions due to chemical instability of the intermediate [Ru(bpy)(3)](3+) species, which degrade over time finally decreasing the reaction rate. O-2 evolution as catalyzed by Mn2O3 is examined at three irradiance conditions, and for three different catalyst contents. Qualitatively, whereas the increase of catalyst amount yields the expected increase of O-2 production and evolution rate, the increase in irradiance enhances the degradation processes, thus giving a "paradoxical" effect of decreasing the chemical yields. Chemical kinetics are applied, and predictions are compared to experimental data derived from bubbling-reactor. The development of the kinetic model imposing steady state condition on transient species yields as expression of R-O2 a simple linear combination of two exponentials. It is found that the main activity indicators obtained from the bubbling reactor tests can be related in an expression that is independent of the amount catalytic sites, i.e. the ratio between the O-2 evolution rate and the total amount Of O-2 evolved during the reaction. Results show that the ratio between the kinetic constants of the desired (i.e. O-2 formation) and undesired path (Le. dye degradation) decreases at increasing irradiance, evidencing how the role of parasitic reactions, far from being negligible, tends to be overwhelming.

J	Guo, Xueyan; Zhu, Zhangping								CFD based modeling on chemical looping combustion in a packed bed reactor								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE				138				303	314		10.1016/j.ces.2015.08.006				DEC 22 2015	2015	Chemical looping combustion (CLC) with metal/metal-oxide oxygen carrier in a randomly packed bed reactor has been modeled and numerically simulated with a finite volume based CFD method with the help of the overset grid technique. The CLC reactor was modeled as a cylindrical fixed bed randomly packed with 450 porous spheres that represents the oxygen carrier particles. 3D transient incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and species transport equation were solved to obtain the flow, temperature and species fields in the interstitial spaces in the reactor. Inside the porous structure of particles, heterogenous reaction, species diffusion and heat conduction were modeled respectively with the changing grain size model (CGSM) and the effective parameter methods. The intra-particle transport processes were solved numerically and coupled through their surface flux with interstitial flow and scalar fields. As a numerical simulation of discrete particle methods, this CFD model provides very detailed fields of flow, temperature and species and their transient evolution in the interstitial void spaces of the reactor and inside the discrete particles. Internal diffusion resistance in large particles is the limiting factor to the overall reaction rate. Structured particles with egg-shell distribution of reactants were found to be helpful to improve the overall reaction rate for large particles. Sensitivity of the particle model to the prediction with the CFD model was also investigated and found to be a necessary concern for a successful CFD modeling for the packed bed CLC process.

To overcome the OER limitation, herein we propose the electrosynthesis of value-added acetic acid from ethanol as the anodic reaction using high activity catalyts. For this strategy to be cost-effective, we develop a bifunctional catalyst based on Pd2Ga nanorods. Such Pd2Ga/C-based catalyst presents outstanding activity, selectivity and also stability for the electrocatalytic ethanol-to-acetic acid conversion with a current density above 164 mA cm(-2) and a mass activity of 1.97 A mg(Pd)(-1). Besides, its activity for hydrogen production is comparable to that of commercial Pt/C catalysts. Using Pd2Ga/C as a bifunctional catalyst for both water reduction at the cathode and ethanol oxidation at the anode, these two coupled reactions are demonstrated to be an energy-efficient approach for the simultaneous production of high purity acetic acid and hydrogen. The assembled electrolyzer requires a small voltage input of 0.62 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), much lower than that of cells based on commercial Pt/C or Pd/C catalyst. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the high performance of the coupled system relies on a combination of an electronic and bifunctional effect of Ga, reducing the hydrogen-binding energy on the Pd site and at the same time actively participating in the reaction by providing OH- binding sites and reducing the energy barrier of the ethanol oxidation rate-determining step.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000826217900002

The emphasis is put on modulation of composition and morphology of g-C3N4 doped with oxygen, sulfur, phosphor, nitrogen, carbon as well as nitrogen and carbon vacancies. Typically, the various methods of non-metal elements introducing in g-C3N4 have been explored to simultaneously tune the textural and electronic properties of g-C3N4 for improving its response to the entire visible light range, facilitating a charge separation, and prolonging a charge carrier lifetime. The application fields of such doped graphitic carbon nitride are summarized into three categories: CO2 reduction, H-2-evolution, and organic contaminants degradation. This review shows some main directions and affords to design the g-C3N4 doping with non-metal elements for real photocatalytic applications.									43	0	0	0	4	0	43				2073-4344		WOS:000582657900001

We evaluate existing cross-section data that were obtained since 1958 and, if appropriate, correct published data for systematic errors that were not noticed previously, including the effects of coincidence summing and updated effective stopping powers. The data are interpreted by using two different models of nuclear reactions, that is, a potential model and R-matrix theory. A new astrophysical S factor and recommended thermonuclear reaction rates are presented. As a result of our work, the O-16(p, gamma)F-17 reaction has now the most precisely known rate involving any target nucleus in the mass A >= 12 range, with reaction rate errors of about 7% over the entire temperature region of astrophysical interest (T=0.01-2.5 GK). The impact of the present improved reaction rate with its significantly reduced uncertainties on the hot bottom burning in AGB stars is discussed. In contrast to earlier results we find now that there is not clear evidence to date for any stellar grain origin from massive AGB stars.									47	0	0	0	0	0	47			0556-2813	1089-490X		WOS:000255457700062

In particular, models including rotation can reproduce the primary nitrogen observed in halo extremely metal poor (EMP) stars. Additional exploratory models showed that rotation may enhance s-process production at low metallicity. Here we present a large grid of massive star models including rotation and a full s-process network to study the impact of rotation on the weak s-process. We explore the possibility of producing significant amounts of elements beyond the strontium peak, which is where the weak s-process usually stops. We used the Geneva stellar evolution code coupled to an enlarged reaction network with 737 nuclear species up to bismuth to calculate 15-40M(circle dot) models at four metallicities (Z = 0.014, 10(-3), 10(-5) and 10(-7)) from the main sequence up to the end of oxygen burning. We confirm that rotation-induced mixing between the convective H-shell and He-core enables an important production of primary N-14 and Ne-22 and s-process at low metallicity. At low metallicity, even though the production is still limited by the initial number of iron seeds, rotation enhances the s-process production, even for isotopes heavier than strontium, by increasing the neutron-to-seed ratio. The increase in this ratio is a direct consequence of the primary production of Ne-22. Despite nuclear uncertainties affecting the s-process production and stellar uncertainties affecting the rotation-induced mixing, our results show a robust production of s-process at low metallicity when rotation is taken into account. Considering models with a distribution of initial rotation rates enables us to reproduce the observed large range of the [ Sr/Ba] ratios in (carbon-enhanced and normal) EMP stars.									117	2	0	0	1	0	118			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000372264200048

Diffusion controlled reduction of Cr(VI) ions occurred between -0.22 V and -0.45 V vs. Ag/AgCl and appears to take place in a single, 3-electron step. The diffusion coefficient was 1.2 times 10-5 cm2 s-1, which agrees with data reported in the literature. Following a study in a three-electrode cell, the electrolysis of 2 times 10-3 mol dm-3 Cr(VI) in 0.1 mol dm-3 H2SO4 solution at -1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, on titanium and -0.65 V vs. Ag/AgCl on carbon electrodes were carried out. The area of the electrodes was 64 cm2 and the mean linear flow velocity of electrolyte past the cathode varied between 10 and 80 cm s-1 (630-5680 cm3 min-1). The parasitic reactions of oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution, which decreased the current efficiency, were observed during the reduction of Cr(VI) ions at titanium electrodes.

Some transition metal oxides have been recently used to catalyze the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), but their further applications are greatly impeded because of their questionable conductivity, poor dispersion, limited active sites, and so forth. Herein, three-dimensional Ni foam-supported urchin-like Al-doped Co3O4 nanospheres rich in surface oxygen vacancies (Al-Co3O4/NF) were prepared via a hydrothermal process and subsequent annealing treatment. It is shown that introducing Al atoms into Co3O4 effectively tunes the electronic properties of the catalyst, and the increased surface oxygen vacancies induced by Al doping facilitate the activation of nitrogen. What is more, this urchin-like nanostructure, demonstrating an ability to limit the coalescence of gas bubbles, enables the rapid removal of small gas bubbles and better exposure of active sites to N-2, thus yielding an impressive ammonia electrosynthesis activity (NH3 yield rate: 6.48 x 10(-11) mol s(-1) cm(-2); Faradaic efficiency: 6.25%) in 0.1 M KOH. Electrochemical-based in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was employed to study the mechanism of NRR, indicating an associative alternating pathway.									41	3	0	0	2	0	41			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000526330900035	32195559

To study the responses of the brown seaweed Sargassum horneri to temperature and light, S. horneri was cultured under three temperatures (20, 25 and 30 degrees C) and three light intensities (30, 60, and 120 mu mol photonsm(-2) s(-1)) for seven days. The growth rate, chlorophyll a (Chl a) and carotenoids (Car) contents, chlorophyll fluorescence, and photosynthetic oxygen evolution rate were measured. The results show that the highest relative growth rate (RGR), maximal electron transport rate (rETR(max)); the net photosynthetic rate (P-n) were observed at the lowest temperature (20 degrees C) and highest light intensity (120 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)); and the RGR and P-n were significantly inhibited by the highest temperature (30 degrees C), especially at the lowest light intensity (30 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) (P <0.05). Additionally, the highest light intensity enhanced the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) even under the highest temperature (30 degrees C), indicating that the higher light intensity could induce photo-protection reaction of thalli. These results suggest that the higher temperature and lower light intensity exerted negative influences on S. horneri.									2	1	0	0	2	0	3			1672-5182	1993-5021		WOS:000607404700011

Production of green jet fuel from furanics via hydroxyalkylation-alkylation over mesoporous MoO3-ZrO2 and hydrodeoxygenation over Co/gamma-Al2O3: Role of calcination temperature and MoO3 content in MoO3-ZrO2								FUEL				332						125977	10.1016/j.fuel.2022.125977				JAN 15 2023	2023	Green biofuels are equivalent to hydrocarbon-based motor fuels and compatible with existing refinery in-frastructures and combustion engines. Therefore, sustainable production of green biofuels is essential to circumvent the construction of expensive biorefinery infrastructures. This study thus presents the production of green jet fuel from biomass-derived furanic compounds via hydroxyalkylation-alkylation (HAA) reaction coupled with hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of the C15 biofuel precursor. MoO3-promoted ZrO2 is a promising solid acid catalyst with excellent thermal stability. The HAA reaction of 2-methylfuran with furfural was thus investigated over a novel MoO3-promoted mesoporous ZrO2 catalyst. This work elucidated the role of calcination temperature and MoO3 loading on the structural variation of MoO3-promoted mesoporous ZrO2 and the evolution of acid sites. The highest acid density and consequently best catalytic performance was observed at 873 K calcination temperature with 20 wt% MoO3 loading. About 85 % 2-methylfuran conversion was achieved over 1.25 g of this optimum catalyst at 2:1 2-methylfuran/furfural mole ratio, 323 K, and 5 h. The HAA reaction was further investigated at various reaction temperatures, catalyst loadings, and 2-methylfuran/furfural mole ratios to obtain optimum reaction conditions. HDO of biofuel precursor was examined over Co/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst at various re-action temperatures, initial hydrogen pressure, and Co metal loading on gamma-Al2O3 to understand the reaction mechanism and identify the optimum reaction conditions. HDO of biofuel precursor progressed through suc-cessive furan ring saturation and opening reactions, followed by a combination of HDO, decarbonylation, and cleavage of tertiary-carbon bonds. C9-C15 alkanes were observed as products, with C11 and C14 hydrocarbons being dominant at 573 K and 30 bar. The elevated hydrogen pressure and reaction temperature boosted the conversion of oxygen-containing intermediate compounds at the cost of C-C cracking reactions. The conversion of oxygen-containing intermediate compounds was enhanced with rising Co metal loading on gamma-Al2O3 up to 20 wt % due to the enhancement of metal dispersion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000874410600004

Herein, direct Z-scheme heterostructure photocatalysts composed of ultrathin Bi3O4Cl and BiOCl nanosheets are rationally fabricated via alkaline chemical etching and solvent exfoliation for O-2 evolution under visible light. With AgNO3 and FeCl3 as the electron scavenger, the optimized ultrathin Bi3O4Cl/BiOCl exhibits prominent photocatalytic activity for O-2 production under visible-light illumination and the production rate (Fe3+: 58.6 mu molg(-1)h(-1)) is much higher than the nanocrystal heterostructure (Fe3+: 28.5 mu molg(-1)h(-1)). This ultrathin heterostructure system can efficiently transfer the electrons, which leads to a considerable improvement in the photocatalytic performance. Due to the suitable band edge potentials and the intense electronic interaction between two-dimensional (2D) Bi3O4Cl and 2D BiOCl, as confirmed by theoretical computations, photoluminescence, and photoelectricity tests, the ultrathin heterojunction with an internal electric field has a highly remarkable charge transfer. The intimate interface contact and {0 0 1} facets effect promote the high photocatalytic performance of the ultrathin Bi3O4Cl/BiOCl heterostructure.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			2367-198X			WOS:000484089200016

The photoactivation process in CP47RC dimers proceeds by the same two-step mechanism as observed in PSII membranes and exhibits the same stoichiometry for Mn2+, but with a 10-fold lower affinity for Ca2+ and an increased susceptibility to photodamage. After the lower Ca2+ affinity and the 10-fold smaller absorption cross-section for photons in CP47 dimers is taken into account, the intrinsic rate constant for the rate-limiting calcium-dependent dark step is indistinguishable far the two systems. The monomeric form of CP47RC also showed capacity to photoactivate and catalyze water oxidation, but with lower activity than the dimeric form and increased susceptibility to photodamage. After optimization of the various parameters affecting the photoactivation process in dimeric CP47RC subcores, 18% of the complexes were functionally reconstituted and the quantum efficiency far oxygen production by reactivated centers approached 96% of that observed for reconstituted photosystem II-enriched membranes.									48	3	0	0	36	0	49			0027-8424			WOS:000084149700029	10588698

Understanding temperature-induced variations in body size is therefore of fundamental and applied interest, yet thermal responses of body size remain poorly understood. Temperature-size (T-S) responses tend to be negative (e.g. smaller body size at maturity when reared under warmer conditions), which has been termed the temperature-size rule (TSR). Explanations emphasize either physiological mechanisms (e.g. limitation of oxygen or other resources and temperature-dependent resource allocation) or the adaptive value of either a large body size (e.g. to increase fecundity) or a short development time (e.g. in response to increased mortality in warm conditions). Oxygen limitation could act as a proximate factor, but we suggest it more likely constitutes a selective pressure to reduce body size in the warm: risks of oxygen limitation will be reduced as a consequence of evolution eliminating genotypes more prone to oxygen limitation. Thus, T-S responses can be explained by the 'Ghost of Oxygen-limitation Past', whereby the resulting (evolved) T-S responses safeguard sufficient oxygen provisioning under warmer conditions, reflecting the balance between oxygen supply and demands experienced by ancestors. T-S responses vary considerably across species, but some of this variation is predictable. Body-size reductions with warming are stronger in aquatic taxa than in terrestrial taxa. We discuss whether larger aquatic taxa may especially face greater risks of oxygen limitation as they grow, which may be manifested at the cellular level, the level of the gills and the whole-organism level. In contrast to aquatic species, terrestrial ectotherms may be less prone to oxygen limitation and prioritize early maturity over large size, likely because overwintering is more challenging, with concomitant stronger end-of season time constraints. Mechanisms related to time constraints and oxygen limitation are not mutually exclusive explanations for the TSR. Rather, these and other mechanisms may operate in tandem. But their relative importance may vary depending on the ecology and physiology of the species in question, explaining not only the general tendency of negative T-S responses but also variation in T-S responses among animals differing in mode of respiration (e.g. water breathersversusair breathers), genome size, voltinism and thermally associated behaviour (e.g. heliotherms).									61	0	0	0	47	0	61			1464-7931	1469-185X		WOS:000571519900001	32959989

The MOF catalyst exhibited a single-site reaction pathway with kinetic behavior similar to that of a homogeneous Ru complex. The reaction was first order with respect to both the concentration of the Ru catalyst and ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN), with k(cat)=3(+/- 2)x10(-3)m(-1)s(-1) in HNO3 (pH0.5). The common degradation pathways of ligand dissociation and dimerization were precluded by MOF incorporation, which led to sustained catalysis and greater reusability as opposed to the molecular catalyst in homogeneous solution. Lastly, at the same loading (ca.97nmolmg(-1)), samples of different particle sizes generated the same amount of oxygen (ca.100nmol), indicative of in-MOF reactivity. The results suggest that the rate of redox-hopping charge transport is sufficient to promote chemistry throughout the MOF particulates.									25	0	0	0	3	0	24			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000423205200014	29197150

Anoxic photochemical reactions4-6 or a photobiological process involving two photosystems7-9 have also been discussed as mechanisms of ferrous iron oxidation. The knowledge of such processes has implications that bear on our understanding of the origin of Precambrian banded iron formations10-14. The reducing power of ferrous iron increases dramatically at pH values higher than 2-3 owing to the formation of ferric hydroxy and oxyhydroxy compounds1,2,15 (Fig. 1). The standard redox potential of Fe3+/Fe2+ (E0 = +0.77 V) is relevant only under acidic conditions. At pH 7.0, the couples Fe(OH)3/Fe2+ (E0' = -0.236 V) or Fe(OH)3 + HCO3-/FeCO3 (E0' = +0.200 V) prevail, matching redox potentials measured in natural sediments9,16,17. It should thus be possible for Fe(II) around pH 7.0 to function as an electron donor for anoxygenic photosynthesis. The midpoint potential of the reaction centre in purple bacteria is around +0.45 V (ref. 18). Here we describe purple, non-sulphur bacteria that can indeed oxidize colourless Fe(II) to brown Fe(III) and reduce CO2 to cell material, implying that oxygen-independent biological iron oxidation was possible before the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis.									499	37	3	0	276	0	544			0028-0836			WOS:A1993KZ56300054

The advent of high-resolution mapping of the O K-edge resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) provides an opportunity to revisit the onset and extent of oxygen participation. Combining RIXS with an array of structural and electronic probes for the family of Ni-rich LiNi0.8Co0.2-yAlyO2 cathodes, we identify common charge compensation regimes that are assigned to formal transition metal redox (<4.25 V) and oxygen participation through covalency (>4.25 V). From O K-edge RIXS maps, we find the emergence of a sharp RIXS feature in these systems when approaching full delithiation, which has previously been associated with lattice oxidized oxygen in alkali-rich systems. The lack of transition metal redox signatures and strong covalency at these high degrees of delithiation suggest this RIXS feature is similarly attributed to lattice oxygen charge compensation as in the alkali-rich systems. The RIXS feature's evolution with state of charge in conventional layered oxides is evidence that this feature reflects the depopulation of occupied O 2p states associated with oxygen participation.									45	1	0	0	1	0	45			2051-6347	2051-6355		WOS:000498631800013

Herein, a facile strategy of simultaneously engineering Pd cocatalyst and oxygen vacancies (V(O)s) on TiO2 to promote H-2 production coupled with selective oxidation of benzylamine is demonstrated. The optimized PdSA+C/TiO2-V-O photocatalyst containing Pd single atoms (SAs), clusters (C), and V(O)s exhibits much superior performance to those of TiO2-V-O and Pd-SA/TiO2-V-O counterparts. The production rates of H-2 and N-benzylidenebenzylamine over PdSA+C/TiO2-V-O are 52.7 and 1.5 times those over TiO2-V-O, respectively. Both experimental and theoretical studies have elucidated the synergistic effect of Pd SAs, clusters, and V(O)s on TiO2 in boosting the photocatalytic reaction. The presence of Pd SAs facilitates the generation and stabilization of abundant V(O)s by the formation of Pd-O-Ti3+ atomic interface, while Pd clusters promote the photogenerated charge separation and afford the optimum active sites for H-2 evolution. Surface V(O)s of TiO2 guarantee the efficient adsorption and dissociation/activation of reactant molecules. This study reveals the effect of active-site engineering on the photocatalysis and is expected to shed substantial light on future structure design and modulation of semiconductor photocatalysts.									57	4	0	0	3	0	58			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000598905700001	33325647

Herein, a facile strategy was developed to construct a multi-phase Ni3P-Co2P-(Ni-Co) film with self-supporting hierarchically micro/nano-porous structure by using bubble template method electrodeposition of self-supporting micro-porous NiCoP film, oxygen-free annealing for phase separation producing Ni3P-Ni-Co2P-Co structure, and acid etching for constructing surface nano-porous structure. The effective active sites for HER was significantly increased due to the hierarchically micro/nano-porous structure, which not only enlarged the surface roughness, but enhanced the bubble detachment by improving the hydrophilicity. Meanwhile, the HER electrolysis durability was improved benefiting from the Ni3P-Co2P phases with high corrosion resistance (especially in acid solution) and the self-supporting film structure without binder. Consequently, the NiCoP-OA-AE film exhibited high HER catalytic performance, which delivered a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 42.9 and 39.7 mV in 1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. It also possessed high long-term electrolysis durability, and the cell voltage of water electrolysis using self-supporting porous NiCoP-OA-AE parallel to IrO2-Ta2O5 electrolyzer at 500 mA cm(-2) for 250 h in 0.5 M H2SO4 is only 2.9 V.

Herein, the rational design of Cr-doped Co4N nanorod arrays grown on carbon cloth (Cr-Co4N/CC) that can efficiently catalyze the HER in alkaline media is reported. It displays outstanding performance, with the exceptionally small overpotential of 21 mV to obtain the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and good stability in 1.0 m KOH, which is even better than the commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst, and much lower than most of the reported transition metal nitride-based and other non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts toward the alkaline HER. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental results reveal that the Cr atoms not only act as oxophilic sites for boosting water adsorption and dissociation, but also modulate the electronic structure of Co4N to endow optimized hydrogen binding abilities on Co atoms, thereby leading to accelerating both the alkaline Volmer and Heyrovsky reaction kinetics. In addition, this strategy can be extended to other metals (such as Mo, Mn, and Fe) doped Co4N electrocatalysts, thus may open up a new avenue for the rational design of highly efficient transition metal nitride-based HER catalysts and beyond.									152	12	0	0	6	0	153			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000486871100001

Here, we demonstrate that novel S-coordinated ruthenium (Ru) nanoclusters anchored on N/S-codoped carbon nanosheets (Ru-S/N-C) can be successfully synthesized via the space-confinement pyrolysis of Ru complexes in the framework of polyaniline-ammonia persulfate supermolecules. X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies reveal the local coordination structure of Ru-S bonds, the surrounding N/S/C environments of Ru, and the synergistic electronic interactions among N, S, C and Ru atoms. Theoretical calculations further confirm that the coordination/surrounding environments could optimize the adsorption energies of intermediates on Ru through interfacial charge transfer and, thus, accelerate the reaction kinetics of hydrogen evolution. The fabricated Ru-S/N-C exhibits an ultra-small overpotential of 10 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and an extremely high turnover frequency (TOF) of 2.3 H-2 s(-1) at an overpotential of 50 mV for the HER, as well as a mass catalytic activity about 10 times higher than that of a commercial Pt/C catalyst.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000652863700001

Electrochemical water-salt splitting to generate useful chemicals is an ideal method to valorize wastewater from desalination and incentivize its collection, which can expand the adoption of desalination to inland regions. We designed a three-chamber electrochemical cell that splits brine to generate an acid (HCl) and a base (NaOH). The three chambers were separated by an anion exchange membrane (AEM) and a cation exchange membrane (CEM), and the reactor operated robustly in various realistic brine concentrations (13,000-35,000 ppm NaCl). Buffer species, including carbonate, borate, and phosphate, reduced proton leakage through the AEM and did not introduce other side reactions. By testing several anodes for stability and selectivity toward oxygen evolution, we found that graphite carbon exhibited a 25% higher acid generation than mixed-metal oxides (Ti-Ir and Ti-Pt) and a 69% selectivity toward oxygen evolution because of a lower chloride adsorption on its surface (44% less chloride oxidized). This study advances material development, reactor design, and mechanistic understanding for electrochemical salt-water splitting to produce commodity chemicals from desalination brine.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2168-0485			WOS:000541876900018

Desorption energy of oxygen adsorbed on un-intentionally doped low pressure chemical vapor deposited silicon films								Diffusion and Defect Data Part B (Solid State Phenomena)				37-38				151	6						1994	1994	The electrical conductivity of thin un-intentionally doped LPCVD polysilicon films is subjected to a large decrease after exposure to oxygen due to gas chemisorption: from 8 to 20 times depending on annealing conditions. Restoration of the electrical conductivity after adsorption/desorption experiments depends on fabrication process and post deposition treatments. Two parameters quantifying the binding between oxygen and film surface are deduced from the evolution of the conductivity during a thermal programmed desorption following an isothermal adsorption: desorption energy (W) and pre-exponential factor (nu). Films crystallized by an in-situ vacuum offer on a unique kind of site described by the couple: W=0.3+or-0.02 eV and 0.2<nu<0.4 s-1. This desorption energy is two times lower than for the plasma reactive etched film one. Observation of film resistance evolution during isothermal adsorption and desorption processes, allows to predict ageing of films stored in ambient atmosphere for a long time.

J	Weng, Sharon X.; Chen, Xiaobo				Chen, Xiaobo/AAC-5100-2019				A hybrid electrolyzer splits water at 0.8 V at room temperature								NANO ENERGY				19				138	144		10.1016/j.nanoen.2015.11.018				JAN 2016	2016	Electrochemical water splitting normally requires a voltage between 1.6 and 2.5 V, due to the thermodynamic requirement (1.23 V at 25 degrees C), ohmic resistance and overpotentials on the anode and cathode. Here, we demonstrate a new concept that successfully splits water into oxygen and hydrogen at a voltage as small as 0.8 V at room temperature (25 degrees C) with earth abundance catalysts. This concept breaks the thermodynamic requirement for water splitting and provides a bright future for the hydrogen economy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Fischer, Rebecca/0000-0001-7965-897X; Schaefer, Laura/0000-0003-2915-5025			Redox Evolution via Gravitational Differentiation on Low-mass Planets: Implications for Abiotic Oxygen, Water Loss, and Habitability								ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL				155	5					195	10.3847/1538-3881/aab608				MAY 2018	2018	The oxidation of rocky planet surfaces and atmospheres, which arises from the twin forces of stellar nucleosynthesis and gravitational differentiation, is a universal process of key importance to habitability and exoplanet biosignature detection. Here we take a generalized approach to this phenomenon. Using a single parameter to describe the redox state, we model the evolution of terrestrial planets around nearby M stars and the Sun. Our model includes atmospheric photochemistry, diffusion and escape, line-by-line climate calculations, and interior thermodynamics and chemistry. In most cases, we find abiotic atmospheric O-2 buildup around M stars during the pre-main-sequence phase to be much less than calculated previously, because the planet's magma ocean absorbs most oxygen liberated from H2O photolysis. However, loss of noncondensing atmospheric gases after the mantle solidifies remains a significant potential route to abiotic atmospheric O-2 subsequently. In all cases, we predict that exoplanets that receive lower stellar fluxes, such as LHS1140b and TRAPPIST- 1 f and g, have the lowest probability of abiotic O-2 buildup and hence may be the most interesting targets for future searches for biogenic O-2. Key remaining uncertainties can be minimized in future by comparing our predictions for the atmospheres of hot, sterile exoplanets such as GJ1132b and TRAPPIST-1b and c with observations.									44	0	0	0	1	0	44			0004-6256	1538-3881		WOS:000439356900003

However, owing to their low OER overpotential, DSAs show poor current efficiency for CER in dilute chloride solutions (< 50 mM), which are common wastewater conditions. Therefore, this study aimed to fabricate a novel anode for efficient chlorine evolution in dilute chloride solutions. To control the OER overpotential, cobalt oxide was selected as an electrode material and iridium was added as a cocatalyst with a small content (< 3% atomic percent) to improve stability. Iridium-cobalt mixed oxide (ICO) electrode showed a sevenfold improvement in CER efficiency (15%) in 1 mM NaCl concentration compared to pristine IrO2 (2%). In addition, above a 50 mM NaCl concentration, ICO exhibited an excellent CER efficiency close to unity. Furthermore, superiority as a CER anode was also demonstrated with high stability (> 200 h) in the accelerated stability test (0.5 M H2SO4 solution at 0.1 A cm(-2)) as well as superior ammonium degradation performance in dilute aqueous conditions. These results suggest that ICO can be a promising anode with its high CER efficiency, low cost, and notable stability.& nbsp;(C) 2022 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.

J	Barber, James								A mechanism for water splitting and oxygen production in photosynthesis								NATURE PLANTS				3	4					17041	10.1038/nplants.2017.41				APR 2017	2017	Sunlight is absorbed and converted to chemical energy by photosynthetic organisms. At the heart of this process is the most fundamental reaction on Earth, the light-driven splitting of water into its elemental constituents. In this way molecular oxygen is released, maintaining an aerobic atmosphere and creating the ozone layer. The hydrogen that is released is used to convert carbon dioxide into the organic molecules that constitute life and were the origin of fossil fuels. Oxidation of these organic molecules, either by respiration or combustion, leads to the recombination of the stored hydrogen with oxygen, releasing energy and reforming water. This water splitting is achieved by the enzyme photosystem II (PSII). Its appearance at least 3 billion years ago, and linkage through an electron transfer chain to photosystem I, directly led to the emergence of eukaryotic and multicellular organisms. Before this, biological organisms had been dependent on hydrogen/electron donors, such as H2S, NH3, organic acids and Fe2+, that were in limited supply compared with the oceans of liquid water. However, it is likely that water was also used as a hydrogen source before the emergence of PSII, as found today in anaerobic prokaryotic organisms that use carbon monoxide as an energy source to split water. The enzyme that catalyses this reaction is carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH). Similarities between PSII and the iron-and nickel-containing form of this enzyme (Fe-Ni CODH) suggest a possible mechanism for the photosynthetic O-O bond formation.									64	4	0	0	25	0	65			2055-026X	2055-0278		WOS:000402875600006	28368386

Physiochemical characterization revealed the symbiotic relationship between a Co2P crystal and surrounding nanometer-sized CoNx moieties embedded in an N,P-codoped porous carbon matrix. Co2P@CNF shows high oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction performance owing to the synergistic effect of Co2P nanocrystals and the neighboring CoNx moieties, which have the optimum binding strength of reactants and facilitate the mass transfer. The free-standing Co2P@CNE air-cathode-based Zn-air batteries deliver a power density of 121 mW cm(-2) at a voltage of 0.76 V. The overall overpotential of Co2P@CNF-based Zn-air batteries can be significantly reduced, with low discharge-charge voltage gap (0.81 V at 10 mA cm(-2)) and high cycling stability, which outperform the benchmark Pt/C-based Zn-air batteries. The one-step electrospinning method can serve as a universal platform to develop other high-performance transition-metal phosphide catalysts benefitting from the synergy effect of transition nitride satellite shells. The free-standing and flexible properties of Co2P@CNE make it a potential candidate for wearable electronic devices.									58	2	0	0	3	0	58			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000461538000078	30793878

Topological analysis of ELF and electron density analysis reveals that all Mo-O bonds in MoO(eta(2)-O-2)(2)OPH3 and MoO2(eta(2)-O-2)OPH3 belong to closed-shell type interactions though negative values of total energy densities E-e(r(BCP)) imply some covalent contribution. The peroxo O-i-O-j bonds are characterized as charge-shift or protocovalent species in which pairs of monosynaptic basins V-3(O-i), V-3(O-j) with a small electron population of similar to 0.25e each, are localized between core basins C(O-i), C(O-j). The oxygen transfer reaction from molybdenum diperoxo complex MoO(eta(2)-O-2)(2)PH3 to C2H4 system can be described by the following consecutive chemical events: (a) protocovalent peroxo O-2-O-1 bond breaking, (b) reduction of the double C-1=C-2 bond to single C-1-C-2 bond in ethylene, (c) displacement of oxygen O-1 with two nonbonding basins, V-i=1,V-2(O-1), (d) increase of a number of the nonbonding basins to three (V-i=1,V-2,V-4(O-1)); (e) reorganization and reduction in the number of nonbonding basis to two basins (V-i=1,V-4(O-1)) resembling the ELF-topology of the nonbonding electron density in oxirane, (e) formation of the first O-1-C-2 bond in oxirane, (f) C-2-O-1-C-2 ring closure, (g) formation of singular nonbonding basin V(O-2) in new Mo=O-2 bond. The oxygen atom is transferred as an anionic moiety carrying a rather small electronic charge ranging from 0.5 to 0.7e.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000286639300018	21190350

Pyrolysis tests were carried out in nitrogen and carbon dioxide environments which are the main diluting gases of air and oxy-fuel environment, respectively. Pyrolysis results show that weight loss profiles are almost the same up to a temperature of 720 degrees C in these two environments, indicating that CO2 behaves as an inert gas in this temperature range. However, further weight loss takes place in CO2 atmosphere at higher temperatures due to CO2-char gasification reaction. Combustion experiments were carried out in four different atmospheres: air, oxygen-enriched air environment (30% O-2-70% N-2), oxy-fuel environment (21% O-2-79% CO2) and oxygen-enriched oxy-fuel environment (30% O-2-70% CO2). Combustion experiments reveal that replacing nitrogen in the gas mixture by the same concentration of CO2 does not affect the combustion process significantly but only leads to slight delay in combustion. Overall comparison of derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) profiles shows that oxygen content in the combustion environment is the most effective parameter irrespective of the diluting gas. As O-2 concentration increases profiles shift through lower temperature zone, peak and burnout temperatures decrease, weight loss rate increases and complete combustion is achieved at lower temperatures and shorter times. During pyrolysis and combustion tests gaseous products CO2, CO, H2O, CH4, SO2 and COS in flue gas were identified and analyzed by using FTIR. Results indicate that higher CO and COS formation takes place during pyrolysis due to gasification reaction. Gaseous species evolution trends in combustion tests are found to be almost identical in oxygen enriched conditions independent of the diluting gas. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, with the object of exploring the effect of CuO loading on W18O49 photocatalytic activity, a 3D Urchin-like CuO modified W18O49 (CuO/W18O49) microspheres with different CuO loadings were synthesized via thermochemical precipitation combined with solvent-thermal method. The obtained CuO/W18O49 microspheres were analyzed by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and photoluminescence (PL), etc. The results infer that the urchin-like 3D morphology with a high surface area and abundant 1D nanowires promotes electron transfer, the introduction of CuO further increases the number of active sites, thereby ensuring fast interfacial charge transfer to improve photocatalytic performance. During photocatalytic H-2 evolution from water splitting, 5 wt.% CuO/W18O49 shows the optimal performance, the H-2 yield is almost 3.22 times that of the undoped counterparts. This work presents that oxygen-vacancy-rich heterojunction nanocomposites can be used as a new strategy to design materials with high photocatalytic activity.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2079-4991		WOS:000610637400001	33406718

Experiments were carried out involving the detonation 15 g charges of C-4 and Detasheet-C explosives in a closed vessel. The initial partial pressure of oxygen in the vessel was varied in order to control the extent of the secondary afterburn reactions, and the total heat release was measured using the calorimeter that contained the closed vessel. A simple model that independently describes the evolution of heat from the gas phase and condensed phase detonation products as a function of oxygen consumption was developed, and was used to show that condensed phase products react much more effectively in the fireball than gas phase reactions, because the transport properties of particulates entrained in a turbulent flow gives them an advantage when it comes to the manner in which they mix with the surrounding air. An additional set of trials employing the entrainment of an external combustible material further confirms the importance of particle combustion in explosive fireballs.

Herein, a new PtGa electrocatalyst with unique nanoporous architecture and a self-supported feature (np-PtGa) was fabricated via a liquid Ga-assisted dealloying strategy. Owing to the unique nanoporous structure and alloying effect by the introduction of Ga, the np-PtGa alloy exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activities towards the electrooxidation of methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, glycerol, and formic acid, which are three orders of magnitude higher than those of the benchmark Pt foil. Moreover, our np-PtGa alloy displays extraordinary catalytic activities towards the hydrogen evolution reaction in both acidic and alkaline environments. Impressively, the overpotential of np-PtGa is as low as 50 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 55 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH, outperforming most of the recently reported electrocatalysts. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the downshift of the d-band center caused by the Ga 4p/Pt 5d orbital hybridization and compressive stress could weaken the adsorption of intermediate species and well rationalize the enhanced electrocatalytic performance of np-PtGa.									18	2	0	0	0	0	19			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000450932100013	30178786

The resulted hybrid catalyst has much higher catalytic activity than WS2 and Fe0.95S1.05 alone, and the optimal WS2/Fe0.95S1.05 hybrid catalyst was found by adjusting the feed ratio. The addition of Fe0.95S1.05 was proven to be able to enhance the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of WS2, and vice versa. At the same time, it was found that the catalytic effect of the hybrid catalyst was the best when the feed ratio was W : Fe=2 : 1. In other words, we confirmed that there is a synergistic effect between W- and Fe-based sulfide hybrid catalysts, and validated that the reason for the improved HER performance is the strong interaction between the two in the middle sulfur. WS2/Fe0.95S1.05-2 hybrid catalyst leads to enhanced HER activity, which shows a low overpotential of similar to 0.172 V at 10 mA cm(-2), low Tafel slope of similar to 53.47 mV/decade.

However, most of the reported catalysts lack the competence to consistently achieve low overpotentials toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during long-term cycling under high rates. Here, the bifunctional activity of Ti3C2Tx MXene is subtly motivated by surface engineering via simultaneous regulation of Li-ion intercalation and O termination decoration. The post-treated Ti3C2Tx (t-Ti3C2Tx) MXene catalysts exhibit superior ORR/OER activities to the pristine Ti3C2Tx counterpart, where the conditions of alkalization by 3 M LiOH and annealing under 400 degrees C offer the optimum performance. The LOB using t-Ti3C2Tx achieves very low ORR/OER overpotentials of 0.16/0.57 V for discharge/charge process, and a large discharge capacity of 17627.3 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1), far outperforming that using the pristine Ti3C2Tx (0.19/0.66 V and 13119.7 mAh g(-1), respectively). Remarkably, the t-Ti3C2Tx cell achieves unprecedented cycle performances for 300 cycles under the limited capacity of 500 mAh g(-1) and 200 cycles under 1000 mAh g(-1) at a high rate of 2000 mA g(-1), meanwhile outputting the discharge voltages above 2.5 V throughout the whole cycles. The superb catalytic capability of t-Ti3C2Tx is mainly attributed to the synergistic contributions from the uniform O termination groups, abundant intercalated Li ions, expanded interlayer spacing and the consequent increase in active sites for facile formation and decomposition processes of Li2O2 discharge product, and the suppression of excessive oxidation of Ti surface atoms.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000852051300002

In this study, nanostructured Co-Ir solid solution alloys, Co1-x(Ir-x) (x = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) have been studied as electro-catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Co1-x(Irx) (x = 0.3, 0.4) exhibit similar onset over-potential to Pt/C and lower over-potential required for Co1-x(Ir-x) (x = 0.3, 0.4) than Pt/C in acidic, neutral as well as basic media, suggesting excellent electrochemical activity of Co-Ir alloys, further studied using theoretical first principles density functional theory calculations. Co1-x(Ir-x) exhibit excellent electrochemical stability in acidic media similar to that of Pt/C.

In these structures, a thin (3-10 nm) film of TiO2 is deposited using atomic layer deposition (ALD) on top of a 100 nm thick Au film. We utilize an AC lock-in technique, which enables us to detect the relatively small photocurrents (similar to mu A) produced by the short-lived hot electrons that are photoexcited in the metal. Under illumination, the bare Au film produces a small AC photocurrent (<1 mu A) for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to hot electrons and hot holes, respectively, that are photoexcited in the Au film. The samples with TiO2 produce a larger AC photocurrent indicating that hot electrons are being injected from the metal into the TiO2 semiconductor where they then reduce hydrogen ions in solution forming H-2 (i.e., 2H(+) + 2e(-) -> H-2). The AC photocurrent exhibits a narrow peak when plotted as a function of reference potential, which is a signature of hot electrons. Here, we photoexcite a monoenergetic source of hot electrons, which produces a peak in the photocurrent, as the electrode potential is swept through the resonance with the redox potential of the desired half-reaction. This stands in contrast to conventional bulk semiconductor photocatalysts, whose AC photocurrent saturates beyond a certain potential (i.e., light limited photocurrent). The photocurrents produced at the metal-liquid interface are smaller than those of the metal-semiconductor system, mainly because, in the metal-semiconductor system, there is a continuum of energy and momentum states that each hot electron can be injected into, while for an ion in solution, the number of energy and momentum states are very small.									32	2	0	0	3	0	33			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000394940400026	28074948

Herein, Cobalt decorated nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes were synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method and calcination. Benefiting from the N-doping, etching of Co nanoparticles to carbon nanotubes and synergistic effect between the components, the as prepared Co/nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (Co-NCNT) displays a half-wave potential of 0.88 V (vs. RHE), a limiting current density of 5.6 mA cm -2, and electron transfer number of 3.9 in 0.1 M KOH. When applied in metal-air batteries, it delivered maximum power densities of 130.0 mW cm -2, 117.3 mW cm -2 and 58.6 mW cm -2 in alkaline Zn-air, Al-air batteries and neutral Mg-air batteries respectively, outperforming the commercial Pt/C. These demonstrate that the synthesized Co-NCNT is a promising candidate for ORR in metal-air batteries with both alkaline and neutral electrolytes.(c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

We report an accurate manipulation of a replacement reaction for Pt/PtTe heteronanowire and PtTe homonanowire fabrication. Their geometric structures are controlled by using the aged K2PtCl4 in ethylene glycol (EG) as Pt precursors with self-tuned coordination state and structure. The aging process enables the slow conversion of PtCl42- to linear structured PtmCln leading to their tunable oxidation ability. The Pt-Pt bond formation during aging has been revealed by time-resolved in situ UV-vis and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopies. The coexistence of a highly active Te template, PtCl42- ions, and linear structured PtmCln complexes allows Pt nanoparticles (NPs) to grow in situ on the PtTe nanowires (NWs), forming a controllable interface structure that served as catalytic active sites and charge transfer location. In combination with theoretical calculations, we highlight that enhanced activity toward oxygen reduction resulted from the surface charge polarization at the Pt/PtTe heterointerface and the long-term stability benefited from the structural stability of the interface.									19	1	0	0	1	0	19			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000391080900006

Profound insights into potential-resolved corrosion stability of Ru-Pt alloy in the potential window from 0.05 to 1.6 V vs RHE are obtained. Compared to pure Pt the PtRu alloy is less stable due to destabilisation of Pt surface caused by Ru dissolution together with the presence of weaker Ru-Pt bonds. However, at high potentials (1.5 and 1.6 V) Pt gets stabilised, presumably via a Ru catalysed oxygen evolution reaction that acts as a cathodic protection. Both Ru and Pt dissolution are enhanced in the presence of methanol due to consumption of surface ruthenium oxides, presumably Ru2O3, by the methanol oxidation reaction and an inhibited redeposition of Pt ions due to surface blockage of CO. The results may be used as useful guidelines in designing future DMFC and PEMFC catalysts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, it is still a great challenge to directly probe the interaction due to the lack of well-defined models and efficient technical means. In this study, we report that pod-like carbon nanotubes with encapsulated iron particles (Pod-Fe) and scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) can be used as an ideal model and technique to study the electronic interaction between carbon shells and iron particles. The chemical imaging and spectroscopy of Pod-Fe by STXM show that the local electronic structures at C K-edge near edge (pi*) of carbon shells can be significantly modified by the encapsulated iron particles, which promotes the adsorption of oxygen-containing species, and thereby further modifies the electronic structure (pi* and sigma*) of the carbon shells. Moreover, computed X-ray absorption near edge structure spectra (XANES) confirmed the electronic modifications of carbon shells by the encapsulated iron particles. The present study provides a direct evidence of electronic interactions with simultaneously collected images and spectra, which can promote the understanding towards the nature of active sites and supports.									57	7	0	0	1	0	58			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000353223100073	28706694

Herein, we effectively suppress the bulk carrier recombination by enhancing the propensity of surface-reaching holes by dual modification, hydrogen treatment and beta-FeOOH loading in rf-sputtered hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) thin films. Hydrogen treatment in alpha-Fe2O3 (H: alpha-Fe2O3) improves the flat band potential and donor density thereby activating the alpha-Fe-2 O-3 photoanode for water splitting. However, the thin coating of FeOOH, an oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC), on the surface of alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode reduces the interface recombination at the junction. The resulting b-FeOOH/H:alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode achieve a considerably higher photocurrent density (J(p) similar to 1.55 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs RHE) and more negative shift in the onset potential (-0.60 V vs RHE) with respect to the pristine alpha-Fe2O3 (0.60 V vs RHE) and exhibit long term stability under visible light illumination (lambda > 420 nm). This work offer a simple but advance strategy of improving the performance of visible light active photocatalysts by hydrogen treatment and beta-FeOOH coating and open-up the door for other applications such as dye degradation, solar water splitting, CO2 reduction etc under visible light illumination.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2365-6549			WOS:000395533900012

Photoreduction of SiMo and FeCy was hindered to a lesser degree (I-50 similar to 250 mu M). For a number of reagents, the relationship between the I-50 values and the actinic light intensity determining the turnover rate for the photosynthetic electron transfer chain was studied. The I-50 value for the ADRY reagent carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone accelerating the deactivation of S-2 and S-3 states of the water oxidizing system was enhanced by increasing the light intensity. The I-50 values for DCMU, BHT, and NH2OH were unaffected by changes in light intensity. It is concluded that BHT does not possess ADRY properties and it is a NH2OH-like electron donor for PS II. BHT oxidation by PS II was retarded after removing Mn from the O-2-evolving complex. BHT could be oxidized by PS I, but the BHT oxidation rate in PS I was significantly lower than in PS II.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0006-2979			WOS:A1995TV58800013

Here, to get insight into the role of plasmonic hot carriers in plasmonic water splitting, a rational design of an antenna-reactor type Pt/Ag/TiO2 metal-semiconductor Schottky nanodiode was fabricated and used as a photoanode. Using the designed PEC cell system combined with the Pt/Ag/TiO2 nanodiode, we show that the plasmonic hot carriers excited from Ag were utilized for the oxygen (O-2) evolution reaction and, consequently, had a decisive role in the enhancement of the photocatalytic efficiency. These results were supported by finite-difference time-domain simulations, and the faradaic efficiency was measured by the amount of actual gas produced. Therefore, this study provides a deep understanding of the dynamics and mechanisms of plasmonic hot carriers in plasmonic-assisted PEC water splitting.

Herein, the inherent Al foils and typical LiCoO2 cathodes in spent lithium ion batteries are jointly employed as the catalyst to reform sawdust pyrolysis gas to produce hydrogenrich synthesis gas. It is the introduction of Al element that triggers the in-situ atomic replacement reaction to immobilize volatile lithium, thereby inducing the formation of a similar Li-CO2 battery system, which efficiently converts CO2 into CO. Furthermore, a new adsorption-enhanced in-situ-assembled porous structure has been discovered and proved to obtain similar to 95% surface vacancy oxygen content and various hydrogen evolution sites. Eventually, the yields and volume fractions of H-2 are 11.31 mmol/g and 65.79%, respectively, and the purity of syngas (H-2 +CO) reaches 91.82%, which verify its excellent performance in hydrogen reforming and CO2 conversion.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000727778000002

The structural features and chemical compositions were characterized by X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis and field emission scanning electron microscopy. The electrocatalytic properties of these materials against oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media were studied. Cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry curves showed that Li-Bir had the highest water oxidation activity. Meanwhile, Li-Bir performed stably for 4000 s. For birnessites containing different alkali metals (K+, Na+ or Li+), the organic dye rhodamine B degradation rates were significantly different in acidic media. At pH 1, the degradation rate of Li-Bir was obviously higher than those of K-Bir and Na-Bir. The surface area of Li-Bir (107.282 cm(2) g(-1)) is much larger than those of Na-Bir (35.623) and K-Bir (11.900), indicating that specific surface area was one of the main factors affecting the OER activity and degradation efficiency of birnessite.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2365-6549			WOS:000406681500022

Char samples were pyrolyzed in a helium atmosphere using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). Oxidation reactivity measurements of the same char samples in the TGA were collected after converting the helium atmosphere to an oxygen containing atmosphere. Reactivities were measured using an isothermal method at various reaction temperatures from 400 to 700 degreesC and oxygen concentrations of 2-21%. Oxidation kinetic parameters such as apparent reaction order and apparent activation energies were obtained. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to study morphological and structural development in the char samples as a function of heat treatment temperature. An interesting morphological development on the surface of the char was observed by SEM, which showed evolution of vesicle formation and whisker growth as heat treatment temperatures increased. Its implication on char reactivity is discussed. Preliminary results showed decreasing reactivity with increasing peak heat treatment temperatures. Char reactivity was affected more by the heat treatment temperature than by the hold times (10-60 min). (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The types of irradiation-induced free radicals and their decay behavior under argon and different partial pressures of oxygen were studied by electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR). In argon, the alkyl radicals and allyl radicals are the main radical species with a total radiation chemical yield of 0.48/100 eV. Alkyl radicals have poor stability with a life time about 1 d at room temperature. In oxygen-containing atmosphere, free radicals are decayed mainly by oxidation reaction and the decay rate increases with the increase of oxygen partial pressure. The half-life of free radicals decreases from 224.0 h in 1x10(5) Pa argon to 1.8 h in 5x10(5) Pa O-2. It is estimated that the migration rate of free radicals trapped in the crystal region to the surface of the microcrystalline is very fast at room temperature, on the order of hours.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0251-0790			WOS:000682521000032

The starting materials were three synthetic basalts (i.e.Mg-melt#(78), Mg-melt#(75), and Mg-melt#(72)) doped with variable amounts of CaCO3, in order to reproduce the natural concentration levels of CaO-rich magmas interacting with the skarn rock shells. Results from decarbonation experiments evidence that the crystallization of Fo-CaO-rich, NiO-poor olivines is more favored at higher temperatures when primitive basaltic magmas assimilate increasing amounts of carbonate materials. The number of large size Ca cations entering olivine crystal lattice is proportional to the amount of Ca-O-Si bonds available in the melt. Due to differences between Fe(2+)and Mg cation radii, the Ca-Fe2+ substitutions into M2 crystallographic site are more facilitated than Ca-Mg ones, thus enhancing the forsterite component in olivine. The partitioning behavior of Ni, Mg, Fe2+ Mn, and Ca between olivine and melt has been also investigated to better understand cation redistribution mechanisms at the magma carbonate reaction zone. In this context, some partitioning models from the literature have been refined to more accurately quantify the geochemical evolution of primitive skam systems. Under the effect of CaCO3 assimilation, the partitioning of divalent cations, can be parameterized as a function of temperature, bulk composition (mostly, CaO and MgO contents in both olivine and melt) and melt structure (expressed as the number of non-bridging oxygens per tetrahedrally coordinated cations). Conversely, the exchange partition coefficients between Fe2+/Ca/Mn/Ni and Mg do not vary significantly as a function of temperature and Mg-melt#, due to the limited influence of these parameters on the melt structure. In turn, cation exchange reactions are primarily controlled by the strong depolymerizing effect of CaCO3 assimilation that increases the number of structural sites critically important to accommodating network-modifying cations in the melt phase. The comparison between cumulates and magmatic skarns from the Colli Albani Volcanic District (Italy) and experiments from this study provides quantitative constraints on the geochemical evolution of olivine phenocrysts and their melt inclusions as a function of carbonate assimilation.

Actual role of such hydroxylation in alkaline HER electrocatalysis is not previously given any significance. In this study, we report an intriguing finding that nickel sulfide a well-known HER electrocatalyst when subjected to anodic potential cycling covering Ni2+ and Ni3+ redox couple led to accelerated hydroxylation accompanying surface amorphization. As a result, improved electrochemical surface, better HER kinetics, and better charge transfer were achieved that lowering the HER over potential by 110 mV at 100 mA cm(2). This surface amorphized and hydroxylated nickel sulfide exhibited excellent stability upon both galvanostatic and potentiostatic electrolysis for over 50 h. Besides, it also showed a lower Tafel slope (120 mV dec(-1)), higher relative ECSA in terms of 2C(dl) (3.85 mu F cm(-2)), and higher electrochemical accessibility for Ni sites (3.7 x 10(17) cm(-2)) which further advocate the superiority of our way of improving HER activity of a non-oxide/hydroxide catalyst. Thus, this study open up new avenues for re-examining other nonoxide/hydroxide catalysts in alkaline HER for benefiting the energy and cost-efficient hydrogen generation.									28	0	0	0	1	0	28			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000613253500002

Inspired by the structure of gas-trapping hydrophobic hair on a subaquatic spider and the function of hemocyanin in its blood, in the present work, an aerophilic-hydrophilic heterostructured electrode is constructed by using aerophilic ultrathin porous Bi5O7I nanotubes and hydrophilic carbon spheres. Besides, the electrolyte is functionalized with suspended ultrathin porous Bi5O7I nanotubes. The Faradaic efficiency is increased from 5.19 % to 13.42 %, and the ammonia yield is boosted from 7.96 to 31.46 mg h(-1)m(-2) by the new way at -0.4 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode under ambient conditions. Furthermore, the highest yield rate of 85.45 mg h(-1) m(-2) is achieved with a configured flow cell.

However, high photocurrent density, conversion efficiency, and durability remain grand challenges due to their photocorrosion in electrolyte solutions. To overcome these challenges, we designed a highly efficient and stable photoanode consisting of vertically stacked NiO nanosheets coupled with atomically dispersed iridium sites on a BiVO4 semiconductor as a water oxidation photoanode. A series of analyses, including scanning tunneling electron microscopy, X-ray spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, demonstrated that the Ir atoms are atomically dispersed on the surface of vertically stacked NiO sheets with a favorable oxidation state and suitable band edge potentials for charge separation and transport. Owing to these properties, the designed BiVO4@NiO-Ir exhibited a stable water oxidation photocurrent of 4.33 mA.cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under simulated solar light, which is much higher compared to those of BiVO4, BiVO4@NiO, and BiVO4@Ir photoanodes. In addition, we observed the evolution of stoichiometric amounts of oxygen and hydrogen with 96% Faradaic efficiency for greater than a 10 h duration. The DFT results showed that the potential determining step (PDS) of the oxygen evolution reaction at the BiVO4@NiO-Ir surface is only 0.68 eV compared to 1.78 eV at the BiVO4@NiO surface. The significant reduction of PDS on the order of 1 eV for BiVO4@NiO-Ir demonstrates superior photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance. We strongly believe that this work aids the design of atomically scaled nanocatalysts for solar-driven chemical fuel device applications.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2574-0962			WOS:000711236300096

In this article, we have synthesized a molybdate incorporated nickel cobalt hydroxide material on Cu mesh with nickel : cobalt : molybdenum in a 13.25 : 21.42 : 1 ratio and the electrode has shown excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity as it demonstrates overpotentials as low as 290 mV and 125 mV to reach 10 mA cm(geo)(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively (after both iR and capacitance correction). Control studies with fourteen other nickel-cobalt based hydroxides and rigorous postcatalytic analysis suggested that though molybdate was not the active catalytic centre, it played a pivotal role in enhancing the activity of the material as - (i) it significantly improved the surface area and porosity of the as-synthesized material and (ii) owing to its continuous etching during electrochemical testing, it was found to increase the accessibility of electrochemically active catalytic sites lying in the bulk. Thus, molybdate acts as a "pore forming additive" during both synthesis and electrochemical treatment. Furthermore, the combination of nickel and molybdate helped in the formation of a 2D-sheet like morphology which in turn improves accessibility to catalytically active centres. In addition, the Cu mesh substrate notably lowers the charge transfer resistance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever report of molybdate as a "pore forming additive" and will enthuse the designing of electrocatalytic materials with enhanced performance based on this strategy.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000496763600020	31486448

See DOI: 10.1039/c9cy01244c								CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				9	19			5394	5400		10.1039/c9cy01244c				OCT 7 2019	2019	Exploring robust and low-cost co-catalysts to substitute precious noble metals is of great importance in both fundamental research and practical applications. In this research, after loading amorphous NixP on CdS nanorods by a photodeposition method, the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of the as-prepared NixP/CdS from water splitting was significantly improved. The optimal hydrogen production rate of the NixP/CdS photocatalyst with a 20 min photodeposition time can reach up to 69.2 mmol h(-1) g(-1), which is 27 times higher than that of bare CdS and 6 times higher than that of 1 wt% Pt/CdS, respectively. The presence of NixP can efficiently promote the separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs of CdS, which was supported by the enhanced photocurrent, reduced photoelectric impedance, weakened fluorescence intensity, extended fluorescence lifetime and lower overpotential of the hydrogen evolution reaction. A possible mechanism of photocatalytic H-2 evolution over NixP/CdS was proposed, which revealed that amorphous NixP provided active sites and excellent electron transfer mediators for the photocatalytic reaction. This study sheds new light on how to design low-cost, high-efficiency composite materials towards photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.									16	1	0	0	1	0	16			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000496289200014

However, some organic compounds are easy to degrade than others, as well as they also interact with BDD surface. Thus, it is necessary to understand the chemical/electrochemical process at the molecular level. In this frame, this work aims to study the electrochemical oxidation (EO) of oxalic acid (OA) at BDD anode, understanding the reaction mechanism, formation of hydroxyl radicals, the effect of supporting electrolyte concentration, and the role of oxidants in solution taking into consideration the cyclic and linear voltammetric measurements. Voltammetric results clearly reveal that a direct electron transfer is achieved as the main mechanistic behavior suffered by OA on BDD surface before oxygen reaction. However, the concentration of sulfates in solution plays an important role in the solvation, diffusion and adsorption species at BDD surface, promoting parallel mechanisms. From the information provided by experimental measurements, the preferential mechanism on BDD surface at low or high overpotential regions was elucidated.									10	0	0	0	3	0	10			0103-5053	1678-4790		WOS:000472842700020		
J	Ma, Haoxuan; Jia, Yuefa; Bae, Jongseong; Liu, Chunli								Factors affecting photocatalytic performance through the evolution of the properties due to the phase transition from NaBiO3 center dot 2H(2)O to BiO2-x								FRONTIERS IN ENERGY				16	3			471	482		10.1007/s11708-021-0778-4		SEP 2021		JUN 2022	2022	The phase transition process of a photocatalytic system from NaBiO3 center dot 2H(2)O to BiO2-x has been investigated to understand the important factors that affect photocatalytic performance in a composite system. It is found that a proper amount of BiO2-x on the surface of NaBiO3 center dot 2H(2)O could effectively suppress the electron/hole recombination and increase the exposed reactive sites for photocatalytic reaction. A fully covered BiO2-x on NaBiO3 center dot 2H(2)O results in a dramatical decrease of photocatalytic degradation of dye. An over long hydrothermal process can result in BiO2-x with reduced oxygen vacancies, which degrades the photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the photocatalytic reduction ability of CO2 conversion has been investigated, indicating that the surface activity to different reactants also directly affects the catalytic performance. The investigation of the gradient phase transition process presents a clear guidance to construct a desired photocatalytic system, in addition to selecting gradient materials with suitable bandgap structure and a morphology with different fraction and distribution of each component. The defect evolution of each component during construction of a composite is also an important factor that should be optimized and considered in making a composite to achieve high photocatalytic efficiency.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-1701	2095-1698		WOS:000700984800001

Journal of medicine and life				6	3			235	9						2013-Sep-15	2013	HYPOTHESIS: Melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer characterized by malignant proliferation of melanocytes. The role played by reactive oxygen species and free radicals in the pathology of melanoma in humans is widely accepted today.OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to characterize some types of malignant melanoma obtained experimentally by the inoculation of reference cells for the creation of models and the identification of oxidative stress markers usable for monitoring tumor growth and development.METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice C57Bl/6. Reference cell lines B16, F1, F10. Inoculation of cells was performed in the upper right flank. Tumors were characterized both anatomically and morphologically. For the biochemical characterization of the oxidative stress, tests were performed to determine lipid peroxides, total albumin thiol groups and total antioxidant response. Tumor volume was measured in dynamic. The fastest development has been observed in type B melanoma. For the F and F10 types, the curves profiles are the same. The results indicate an increase of lipid peroxidation reaction in dynamic tumor evolution, suggesting the malignant associated transformations.DISCUSSION: These data demonstrate that an alteration of the antioxidant pattern can be detected in the serum of the experimental animals with melanoma, possibly related to the disease status and progression. Our results can be useful in monitoring the tumor evolution and also to highlight the prolonged damage which actions on the normal cells, suggesting the combination of the classical treatments with an adjuvant antioxidant treatment.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2				1844-3117		MEDLINE:24146680	24146680

We introduce a scalable facile strategy for the construction of a hierarchical three-dimensional sulfur-modulated holey C2N aerogels (S-C(2)NA) as bifunctional catalysts for Zn-air and Li-O-2 batteries. The S-C(2)NA exhibited ultrahigh surface area (4943 m(2) g(-1)) and superb electrocatalytic activities with lowest reversible oxygen electrode index similar to 0.65 V, outperforms the highly active bifunctional and commercial (Pt/C and RuO2) catalysts. Density functional theory and experimental results reveal that the favorable electronic structure and atomic coordination of holey C-N skeleton enable the reversible oxygen reactions. The resulting Zn-air batteries with liquid electrolytes and the solid-state batteries with S-C(2)NA air cathodes exhibit superb energy densities (958 and 862 Wh kg(-1)), low charge-discharge polarizations, excellent reversibility, and ultralong cycling lives (750 and 460 h) than the commercial Pt/C+RuO2 catalysts, respectively. Notably, Li-O-2 batteries with S-C(2)NA demonstrated an outstanding specific capacity of similar to 648.7 mA. h g(-1) and reversible charge-discharge potentials over 200 cycles, illustrating great potential for commercial next-generation rechargeable power sources of flexible electronics.									131	15	0	0	6	0	133			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000423495200064	29262251

Extensive studies on molecular catalysis have been performed to gain fundamental knowledge for the rational designing of cheap, efficient and robust catalysts. We herein report a water-soluble CuII complex of tetrakis(4-N-methylpyridyl) porphyrin (1), which catalyzes the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in neutral aqueous solutions with small overpotentials: the onset potential of the catalytic water oxidation wave measured at current density j 1/4 0.10 mA cm(-2) is 1.13 V versus a normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), which corresponds to an onset overpotential of 310 mV. Constant potential electrolysis of 1 at neutral pH and at 1.30 V versus NHE displayed a substantial and stable current for O-2 evolution with a faradaic efficiency of > 93%. More importantly, in addition to the 4e water oxidation to O-2 at neutral pH, 1 can catalyze the 2e water oxidation to H2O2 in acidic solutions. The produced H2O2 is detected by rotating ring-disk electrode measurements and by the sodium iodide method after bulk electrolysis at pH 3.0. This work presents an efficient and robust Cu-based catalyst for water oxidation in both neutral and acidic solutions. The observation of H2O2 during water oxidation catalysis is rare and will provide new insights into the water oxidation mechanism.									106	8	0	0	10	0	106			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000459929800003	30996977	
J	Xu, Ke; Song, Jie; Song, Pengxiang; Xu, Guizhi; Deng, Zhanfeng								Performance Decay of Air Electrode Configuration for Rechargeable Zinc-Air Batteries								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				167	13					130501	10.1149/1945-7111/abb37c				JAN 10 2020	2020	The construction of the air electrode structure is critical in the rechargeable zinc-air batteries. So far, the majority of previous articles have been reported on the process in boosting electrocatalytic bifunctional oxygen reaction activity. Nevertheless, the reason that caused the deterioration of air electrodes has been rarely investigated, which dramatically influences cell performance. Herein, self-supported MnO(2)bifunctional electrocatalysts on nickel foam are integrated with the gas diffusion layer to form air electrodes. The charge voltage of the as-prepared electrode used in rechargeable zinc-air battery is reduced by 1.82% and the discharge voltage is decreased by 5.25% after 1000 cycles at the current density of 20 mA cm(-2)under the mode of 5 min charge and 5 min discharge, which demonstrate the feasibility of the novel electrode structure design. Besides, The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were conducted to analyze the change of composition, structure, and performance. The origin of the decrease of the discharge profile was analyzed. Experimental studies revealed that the main cause of voltage loss is mainly attributed to the destroyed gas diffusion structure (at large current densities) and the activation loss of MnO(2)caused by the (oxy)hydroxide film (at small current densities). The destroyed gas diffusion structure gives rise to the poor oxygen transfer and further water flooding due to the formation of large pore caused by oxygen evolution in the charging process and increased hydrophilicity by the carbon oxidation. Meanwhile, the film growing overtop of the electrocatalysts would result in mass transfer and activation losses.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000570808500001

Electrochemical impedance spectra and polarization curves at different locations under a droplet were measured on the CTEA. A mathematical model for the impedance responses was developed to analyse the electrochemical corrosion processes for different areas under saline droplets with different volumes. The local corrosion kinetics parameters, including anodic faradaic impedance, cathodic faradaic impedance, diffusion resistance, effective capacitance, and local interfacial oxygen concentration, were obtained by the regression and subsequent calculation on EIS data for selected electrode units. There are significant differences in the control mechanisms of local corrosion kinetics between different places under the droplets, resulting from the uneven reaction distribution and the divergent evolution of the corrosion process caused by droplet geometry. Under a droplet with a volume of 25 mu L, both the anodic and the cathodic electrode units were determined by oxygen diffusion. Under a droplet with a volume of 110 mu L, the central anode units was mainly controlled by the mass transfer of oxygen, and the peripheral cathode unit was determined by both anodic faradaic impedance and oxygen diffusion. The local corrosion process was mass-transfer determined under the central part of 340 mu L droplet; whereas, the peripheral part was controlled by both anodic charge transfer and the mass transfer of oxygen.

These phenomena occur at multiple temporal and spatial scales, making the modeling, especially in the transient regime, very difficult. Nonetheless, multiscale models are needed to improve the understanding of oxygen reduction and guide cathode design. Of particular importance for long-term operation are microstructure degradation and chromium oxide poisoning both of which degrade cathode performance. Existing methods are phenomenological or empirical in nature and their application limited to the continuum realm with quantum effects not captured. In contrast, steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamics can be used to model nonequilibrium processes (even those far-from equilibrium) at all scales. The nonequilibrium relaxation is characterized by entropy generation, which can unify coupled phenomena into one framework to model transient and steady behavior. The results reveal the effects on performance of the different timescales of the varied phenomena involved and their coupling. Results are included here for the effects of chromium oxide concentrations on cathode output as is a parametric study of the effects of interconnect-three-phase-boundary length, oxygen mean free path, and adsorption site effectiveness. A qualitative comparison with experimental results is made.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			0340-0204	1437-4358		WOS:000419371100002

The ordered arrangement of cations in the CoMo-LDH could be easily phosphored and generate the ultraevenly dispersed Mo element within the CoP structure, resulting in the excellent bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activities of the composites present an increase first and then a decreasing tendency with increased Mo doping content. Among all the Mo-doped CoP materials, the composite with a Mo/Co mole ratio of 1/2.3 presents the highest HER activity and stability in acidic conditions. At the current density of -10 mA.cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4, the overpotential is only 116 mV. In addition, the composite also presents excellent HER and OER performance under alkaline conditions. The overpotential is 118 mV for HER and 317 mV for OER at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. It requires a cell voltage of 1.7 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) and maintains a stable water-splitting current for at least 24 h, which is superior to most reported alkaline media. This simple and efficient synthetic approach could also be used for ultraeven doping between other transition metal ions.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0743-7463			WOS:000654294100025	33961439

The usual model of electron and hole transfers between a semiconductor and an electrolyte solution should include an additional term due to the generation of h(+) and e(-) charges resulting from the dual redox reactions on anodic and cathodic sites. Then, in a narrow range of potential near the corrosion conditions, the classical Butler-Volmer electrochemical equations apply.The values of open circuit voltage and corrosion current have been obtained using n- and p-type silicon with different doping levels, in contact with deoxygenated or oxygen-saturated DHF solution, in the dark and tinder illumination. These data were used to characterize the electrochemical reaction kinetics leading to the corrosion rate expressed in atoms per square centimeter per second of different Si substrates. In addition, we derived an estimation of the exchange current density of the hydrogen evolution reaction on the Si surface.									23	1	0	0	0	0	23			0022-0728			WOS:A1997WX98600013

The as-synthesized MoP showed the best HER performance in acid medium with a low overpotential of 136 mV obtained at 10 mA cm(-2), while Mo2C-C showed the lowest overpotential for HER in alkaline medium, and for MoS2-C, which exhibited few layers structure (less than three layers), exhibiting favorable catalytic performance in both acid and alkaline electrolytes. Both MoP-C and Mo2C-C showed negligible overpotential loss after 5000 cycles in acid medium, but were relative unstable in alkaline medium. Moreover, the carbon sphere matrix improved the catalytic performance of molybdenum compounds by alleviating the aggregation of catalysts, providing sufficient area for electrolyte contact, and facilitating electron transfer. This work demonstrates a facile avenue to prepare cost-effective molybdenum compounds for HER. Furthermore, electrochemical performance of the catalysts was investigated in both acid and basic media.									120	8	0	0	4	0	120			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000397003700063

We report here defective and "c-disordered" layered manganese oxides (MnOx-300) formed on a fluorine-doped tin oxide electrode by constant anodic potential deposition and subsequent annealing, with a catalytic onset (0.25 mA/cm(2)) at an overpotential (eta) of 280 mV and a benchmark catalytic current density of 1.0 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential (eta) of 330 mV under neutral pH (1 M potassium phosphate). Steady current density above 8.2 mA/cm(2) was obtained during the electrolysis at 1.4 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode for 20 h. Insightful studies showed that the main contributing factors for the observed high activity of MnOx-300 are (i) a defective and randomly stacked layered structure, (ii) an increased degree of Jahn-Teller distorted Mn3+ in the MnO6 octahedral sheets, (iii) effective stabilization of Mn3+, (iv) a high surface area, and (v) improved electrical conductivity. These results demonstrate that manganese oxides as structural and functional models of an oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) in photosystem II are promising catalysts for water oxidation in addition to Ni/Co-based oxides/hydroxides.									50	4	0	0	5	0	50			2155-5435			WOS:000410005700085

Herein, Ru2P was synthesized and used as an anodic HOR electrocatalyst for APEFC, achieving a peak power density of 1.3 W cm(-2), the highest value among Pt-free anode electrocatalysts reported under the same conditions. From the density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental results, it was found that besides the optimized hydrogen binding energy, the enhanced adsorption strength of oxygenated species (OH*) and the reduced work function of Ru2P contributed to the enhanced HOR performance. The normalized exchange current densities of Ru2P/C were 0.37 mA cm(ECSA)(-2) and 0.27 mA mu g(Ru)(-1), respectively, both approximately three times higher than those of Ru when conducted in the rotating disk electrode (RDE) system.

This gap can be largely attributed to the inability to produce nanocrystals in large quantities while retaining uniformity and good control over both size and shape. Here we provide a new perspective on increasing the volume of production during a synthesis of colloidal nanocrystals via seed-mediated growth. We demonstrate that the yield of Pd octahedra and Pd@Pt3-4L (L: atomic layers) core-shell octahedra with different sizes can be increased from ca. 2mg to over 500mg without compromising the product quality. Specifically, we apply geometric and stoichiometric analyses to calculate the minimum amounts of reagents needed for the complete evolution of Pd cubic seeds into Pd octahedra, and subsequently for the formation of Pd@Pt3-4L core-shell octahedra through conformal Pt coating. The simple analyses allow us to obtain uniform products by avoiding homogeneous nucleation while minimizing the waste of reagents.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2199-692X			WOS:000387674600005

The oxide inclusions in the consumable steel electrode were ternary (7.1-26.4 masspct) MnO-(53.3-82.8 masspct) SiO2-(8.3-23.1 masspct) Al2O3 without exception, which were fully removed during the P-ESR in two ways: a portion of these inclusions were dissociated in its individual chemical species into liquid steel, whereas the others were removed by absorbing them into molten slag before liquid metal droplets collected in liquid metal pool during P-ESR. The oxide inclusions both in liquid metal pool and in remelted ingots are mostly MgAl2O4 (containing about 3 masspct MgO) and Al2O3 inclusions, irrespective of the SiO2 contents (1.9 to 9.0 masspct) in the slag. These inclusions readily formed in the liquid metal pool as a result of the reaction between alloying elements and the dissolved oxygen in liquid steel that dissociated from MnO-SiO2-Al2O3 inclusions.									22	3	0	0	0	0	22			1073-5615	1543-1916		WOS:000467478700005

Our electrochemical results clarified that the HOR kinetics is H-2 -> 2H(ad)-> 2H(+),which are determined by intermediate Had species and transfer impacts from H2 and H+. Specifically, the Fe-based catalyst can accelerate Had adsorption/desorption in low potential due to the Fe-Had reversibility of NPs, and the strengthened mass transfer as Well as recoverable active sites of PANI/Fe NPs (polyaniline/Fe NPs) interface in high potential, thus contributing intermittent HOR current in the HOR region. As HOR catalyst, our prototype fuel cell using Fe-based catalyst was demonstrated high E-ocp, mass power density and stability in 110 hrs, tolerance for C3H8 fuel, promising in replacing Pt-based catalysts in future.

In the previous study, the authors have indicated not only the high reaction rate but also the low starting temperature of the reaction. These phenomena can be understood through the view point of the nano-reactor and the active complex. The nano-reactor was defined in this study through the observation of the milling products by TEM and FE-SEM. The important characteristic of nano-reactor was proposed.Moreover, the phenomena such as the reduction reaction, the phase transformation (formation of an active complex) and the crystalline size degradation occurring in the course of the milling were examined. It was found that the milling of mixture gave a different phenomenon from the single hematite or graphite milling. Furthermore, the atmosphere during the milling affected on the reactivity of the milling product. The existence of oxygen caused the reoxidation of the reduction product which resulted in the different crystalline size after milling.									19	3	0	0	0	0	21			0915-1559	1347-5460		WOS:000225903200003

The changes of microstructure and composition of inner and outer rust layer of 40CrNiMo steel were characterized by Optical Microscope(OM)and XRD, the redistribution process of Cr element in rust layer was studied by EDS line scanning, the evolution of electrochemical properties were studied by potentiodynamic polarization and EIS, the Volta potential and its distribution on the sample surface were studied by scanning Kelvin probe(SKP). The initial corrosion behavior(0-11 d)of 40CrNiMo steel in neutral salt spray environment with NaCl content of 5% gradually developed from pitting corrosion to uniform corrosion, the evolution law of the maximum corrosion pit depth is d=87.787t~(0.325), the corrosion kinetic characteristics accord with the law of power function, the fitting result is DeltaW=6.091t~(0.738), which show that the rust layer have a certain protective effect on the metal matrix. The rust layer was obviously stratified after 4 days of salt spray, and the inner rust layer was significantly thickened after 7 days. XRD results show that the yellow loose outer rust layer is mainly composed of gamma-FeOOH; the black dense inner rust layer is mainly composed of alpha-FeOOH and Fe_3O_4, and the EDS line scanning test results show that Cr element enrichment occurs at the interface with the matrix. The polarization curves show that the corrosion process was controlled by cathodic reaction, and the corrosion current density first increase, then decrease and finally increase. The EIS measurement results show that the charge transfer resistance first decrease, then increase and finally decrease. The polarization curves have a good correlation with the EIS measurement results, which show that the corrosion rate of 40CrNiMo steel first increase, then decrease and finally increase in the neutral salt spray environment. The SKP measurement results show that the cathode and anode regions were rapidly formed on the sample surface in salt spray environment, the Volta potential range on the surface of the non corroded sample was 225 mV, which increase to 884 mV after 7 days of salt spray and decrease to 609 mV after 11 days of salt spray. Therefore, it is concluded that after 1 day of salt spray, the rust layer of 40CrNiMo steel was loose and porous, which provide a humid environment for the reaction and speeds up the corrosion rate. With the increase of salt spray time, the rust layer gradually thickened and densified, meanwhile Cr element were enriched in inner rust layer, which lead to the inhibition of oxygen reduction reaction and the protective effect on the matrix became more and more prominent; after 7 days of salt spray, the activity of gamma-FeOOH reduction reaction in the rust layer gradually increased, and two parallel cathodic reactions of oxygen reduction and corrosion product reduction occurred at the same time. the reaction rate tended to be stable after increasing.			目的研究40CrNiMo钢在模拟海洋环境中的锈层及电化学性能初期演化规律。方法采用中性盐雾试验模拟海洋大气环境,通过光学显微镜、EDS、XRD等手段表征40CrNiMo钢内、外锈层微观结构及成分的变化。通过动电位极化、交流阻抗谱及微区电化学技术研究电化学性能的演化规律。结果40CrNiMo钢在盐雾环境中由点蚀逐渐发展为均匀腐蚀,最大腐蚀坑深度的演化规律为d=87.787t~(0.325),腐蚀动力学规律为DeltaW=6.091t~(0.738)。盐雾4 d后锈层出现分层,7 d后内锈层显著增厚。黄色疏松外锈层主要成分为gamma-FeOOH;黑色致密内锈层主要成分为alpha-FeOOH和Fe_3O_4,并且在与基体接触界面出现Cr元素富集。极化曲线与EIS测量结果具有较好的相关性,表明40CrNiMo钢的腐蚀速率先增大后减小再增大;而SKP测量结果显示,盐雾环境中试样表面迅速形成阴、阳极区,盐雾7 d后试样表面Volta电位由225 mV持续增大至884 mV,盐雾11 d后降低至609 mV。结论盐雾1 d后锈层疏松多孔,为反应的发生提供了湿润的环境,加快腐蚀速率。锈层随盐雾时间的延长逐渐增厚致密,氧还原反应被抑制,对基体的保护作用愈发凸显;盐雾7 d后,锈层中gamma-FeOOH还原反应的活性逐渐增强,阴极同时发生氧还原与腐蚀产物还原2个平行的阴极反应,反应速率增快后趋于稳定。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1001-3660			CSCD:7191339

To meet those requirements, unsupported Pt-Cu alloy nanochains (aerogels) were synthesized by a simple co-reduction route in aqueous solution and their structure was characterized by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. These catalysts exceeded the ORR activity of commercial Pt/C catalysts by more than 100% in rotating disk electrode (RDE) experiments and met the corresponding US DOE target for automotive PEFC implementation, thereby qualifying as very promising materials. The behavior of Pt-Cu aerogels under PEFC operation conditions was mimicked by acid washing experiments which showed that the Cu content in the alloy phase and ORR activity decrease through this step. Comparing composition, structure and ORR activity for various specimens, the Cu content in the alloy phase was identified as the main descriptor of ORR activity. An almost linear correlation was found between those two parameters and complemented by supporting data from the literature. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, g-C3N4 loaded with different tungsten compounds (W2C, WS2, and W2N) is found to exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activities. W2C/g-C3N4 displays the highest activity for the photocatalytic reaction with a H-2 evolution rate of up to 98 mu mol h(-1), as well as remarkable recycling stability. The excellent photocatalytic activity of W2C/g-C4N3 is attributed to the suitable band alignment in W2C/g-C4N3 and high HER activity of the W2C cocatalyst, which promotes the separation and transfer of carriers and hydrogen evolution at the surface. These findings demonstrate that the tungsten carbide cocatalyst is more active for the photocatalytic reaction than the sulfide or nitride, paving a way for the design of novel and efficient carbides as cocatalysts for photocatalysis.									57	1	0	0	6	0	57			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000478633900017	31074099

The C2N/SiH heterojunction is proposed and its geometric structure, electronic structure and thermodynamic feasibility for water splitting is systematically studied based on first-principles. The results show that the heterojunction is type-II band alignment, which promotes the effective separation of electron-hole. The built-in electric field will further hinder the electron-hole recombination, thereby further improving the photocatalytic efficiency. It is worth noting that the electronic and thermodynamic properties of the heterojunction can be adjusted by applying uniaxial and biaxial strain to achieve better catalytic water splitting. It is indicated that a biaxial strain of -2% is recommended to adjust the catalytic efficiency of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and a biaxial strain of 4% is recommended to adjust the catalytic efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In short, the research not only provides fundamental understanding for the water splitting of C2N/SiH heterojunction, but also provides a direction for improving the OER and HER catalytic activity of the heterojunction.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000736681800006

However, strong Pd-H bonding makes H desorption the rate-limiting step in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process. Engineering material structures at the atomic level has attracted growing interest to tune the physicochemical properties and modulate the reactivity of catalysts. Here, we proposed a strategy to boost the electrocatalytic activity of Pd by electrochemical H intercalation and in situ formation of PdHx, which could consequently weaken the hydrogen adsorption on the surface of the catalyst and facilitate hydrogen generation in turn. As predicted, the Pd catalyst exhibited an unusual performance, in which repeated catalysis of hydrogen evolution resulted in continual and distinct enhancement of activity. Notably, the optimum catalytic activity was achieved after 130000 CV cycles, in which the overpotential of 32 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) was much smaller than that of initial Pd; the Pd catalyst even outperformed commercial Pt/C, indicating its extremely high durability and activity. The experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the structure engineering of Pd nanocrystals induced by electrochemical H intercalation can weaken the Pd-H bonding, which boosts hydrogen evolution catalysis. Besides, the formation of PdHx by the intercalation of electrochemical H also provides an innovative stable and high-capacity hydrogen storage method.									22	2	0	0	0	0	23			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000474712700048

The replacement of common noble-metal platinum catalysts with highly efficient, cheap, and operationally stable electrocatalysts opens huge potential applications for OER; thus, there have been increasing efforts to develop alternative efficient OER catalysts via low-cost fabrication processes. Herein, we report a facile self-templated method to synthesize ZnCo-Fe core-shell nanocages derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as an efficient catalyst for OER. The unique structure of ZnCo-Fe core-shell nanocages offers a large active surface area with abundant active sites and efficient charge transfer capability as the hollow structure facilitates the active direct contact of materials with electrolytes. We introduced these catalysts at different ratios of Fe, which had a significant effect on the electrocatalytic performance of OER. In other words, the introduction of Fe not only changed the composition but also changed the morphology to expose numerous active sites for OER. Owing to the synergistic effect between the element composition and abundant active sites, the optimized ZnCo-Fe-20 sample presented a superior electrocatalytic OER performance with a very low overpotential (eta = 176 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and a small Tafel slope (69.3 mV dec(-1)). This developed strategy can be easily extended to synthesize other MOF-derived polymetallic oxide-based hybrid electrodes for OER as a practical route for the design of cheap and efficient electrocatalysts.									31	2	0	0	1	0	31			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000476913600050

Within the oxygen-annealed samples we identify new heavily-oxygenated phases, that is, YMnO3.33 and HoMnO3.34. The former is then thoroughly characterized by thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction and electron diffraction. These studies evidence a hexagonal sub-cell (a(s) approximate to 3.578 angstrom (a(H)/root 3), c(S)approximate to 11.18 angstrom, space group P6(3)mc) and satellites, associated with two modulation vectors q(1)(->*)approximate to 0.41 a(S)(->*)+ 0.41 b(S)(->*)+1/3 c(S)(->*) and q(2)(->*) = (1/2). The results are interpreted by the formation of a modulated composite structure, resulting from the evolution of the hexagonal parent YMnO3+delta structure toward a reduced pyrochlore-type structure Y2Mn2O7-x, in long-and short-range ordering.

In this work, the ORR catalytic activity of a series of bis(iminothiolato)metal (TMIT) (TM = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir, and Pt) monolayers has been investigated by using the density functional method. The scaling relations are obtained between the Gibbs adsorption free energies of the oxygenated intermediates. The volcano plot of the ORR activity between Delta G(*OH) and overpotential is established. The results reveal that FeIT possesses the best ORR activity. The predicted overpotential is 0.52 V for FeIT, close to 0.45 V for pure Pt. The migration of an 0 atom from the S site to the Fe top site is the rate-determining step with an energy barrier of 0.59 eV, smaller than 0.80 eV for pure Pt. This work may provide an effective method for the design of high-performance ORR catalysts by using the two-dimensional MOFs.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000526331500024

First-principles calculations are critical for understanding these complex materials at an atomic level and establishing relationships between atomic and electronic structures, particularly for probing quantities difficult or inaccessible to experiment. Here, we discuss computational strategies used to understand TMOs by focusing on two examples, a photoanode material, BiVO4, and an oxide for low-power electronics, La1-xSrxCoO3. We highlight key aspects required for the modeling of TMOs, namely, the descriptions of how oxygen vacancies, extrinsic doping, the magnetic state, and polaron formation impact their electronic and atomic structures and, consequently, many of the observed properties.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0021-9606	1089-7690		WOS:000646354000004	34241054

The split signal has a splitting linewidth of 160 G at around g = 2 and is seen upon illumination of the Ca2+-disappearance of the S-2 state multiline signal. Another g=2 broad ESR signal with a 110 G linewidth was produced by 245 K illumination for a short period in the Ca2+-depleted PS II in S-1 state. At the same time a normal Y-Z(center dot) radical signal was also efficiently trapped. The g = 2 broad signal is attributed to an intermediate S1Xcenter dot state in equilibrium with the trapped Y-Z(center dot) radical. Comparison with x-ray structural data suggests that one of the split signals (doublet signal) is attributable to interaction between His 190 and the Y-Z(center dot) radical, and other signals is attributable to interaction between His 337 and the manganese cluster, providing further clues as to the mechanism of water oxidation in photosynthetic oxygen evolution.

Under visible light irradiation, the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution from solar water splitting was performed, Pt3Ni/CdS showed the hydrogen evolution rate about 40.0 mmol/h/g (QE = 44.90%, lambda = 420 nm), which was 1.8 times higher than that of Pt/CdS, indicating that Pt3Ni NPs could effectively improve the hydrogen production activity of CdS. Next, the influence of de alloyed Pt3Ni NPs on the activity of CdS for water-splitting under visible light was investigated, the hydrogen evolution rate of de-alloyed Pt3Ni NPs modified CdS was 46.1 mmol/h/g (QE = 52.70%, lambda = 420 nm), which was 1.2 times as much as that of Pt3Ni/CdS and 2.1 times as much as that of Pt/CdS, suggesting that de-alloyed Pt3Ni NPs could further enhance the hydrogen production activity of CdS. In addition, the improved photocatalytic activity was mainly due to the surface unsaturation of Pt atoms in a metastable structure after de-alloying, which will expose more surface active sites of Pt, thus the fast electron hole charge transfer at the interface of CdS and de-alloyed Pt3Ni NPs.

The simulation results for the chemical stability of LSCrF, exposed to oxygen partial pressure (PO2) from 0.21 to 10(-10) atm and temperature from 1000 to 1400 degrees C, reveal the formation of solid corundum, spinel, La2SrFe2O7, and the liquid phase. The simulations also show the chemical reactions of solid secondary phases with the liquid and perovskites under both equilibrium cooling and fast cooling conditions. The phase stabilities of the LSCrF samples under oxygen transport membrane (OTM) sintering and operation conditions are predicted. The study provides guidance on the densification enhancement of the LSCrF bulk materials during the sintering process through the control of the liquid phase concentration and the perovskite phase separation. In addition, the concerns of the release of the genotoxic carcinogens, i.e. chromium hexavalent (Cr6+) gas species from LSCrF to the environment under the sintering and operation conditions are addressed for the first time.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0167-2738	1872-7689		WOS:000414108800001

Recently, a Pt-free multinary PdAuAgTi alloy was discovered with excellent ORR activity and low overpotential close to that of Pt. To rationalize the experimental results, a model based on first-principles methods accelerated with deep learning is developed to rapidly compute and with high fidelity the *OH adsorption energy on the alloyed surface. The ensemble-average *OH adsorption energy is shown to explain the experimentally reported OER activities of PdAuAgTi and further is utilized to provide precise maps of the catalytic activity in the total composition space. Notably, the ORR activity of PdAuAgTi is found to be optimum in a narrow region of the composition space with 8-12 at. % Ti, which agrees with the experimental finding for enhanced ORR activity at 11-13 at. % Ti. In addition, replacing Au and Ag with the more cost-effective elements Cu and Zn is also shown to yield optimum catalysts for ORR. The current study shows that first-principles methods in conjunction with machine learning approaches are an effective tool for discovering multinary alloy systems for catalytic applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1948-7185			WOS:000763597000013	35073105

The adsorption energies of NH3 on the surface of MXenes (M2C, M = Cr and Fe) and their oxygen-functionalized forms (OMXenes or M2CO2) were calculated by using the density functional theory. DFT-D4 calculations have revealed that the on-top sites are initiated for adsorption of NH3 on M2C and M2CO2. For the reaction on Cr2CO2, the Ead is found to be -0.29 eV lower than Cr2C and also the same tendency was achieved in Fe2C and its O-terminated MXene. This suggests that the molecule will strongly adsorb on Cr2C than its O-terminated surface. Bader charge analysis in terms of the induced net charges on M2C MXenes suggests that electron density distribution between N of NH3 (negatively charged) and the Cr/Fe (positively charged) surface would play a key role in the adsorption. Furthermore, DOS calculations reveal that the electrical conducting behaviour and magnetic nature of MXenes make them suitable for gas sensors applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2452-2627			WOS:000741127400004

Alloying Pt with transition-metal (M) elements is an efficient approach to modulate the electronic structure of Pt-based catalysts and improve the catalytic performance for the ORR. However, owing to the distinguishing surface state caused by different synthetic approaches, there still exist contradictory views about the relationship between the structure of Pt-based alloys and the catalytic performance for the ORR. In this work, PtCo alloys with a similar surface state but diverse structures and compositions are obtained by regulating the annealing temperatures and the precursor ratios. Accompanied by the structure and composition evolution, the electronic structure of Pt has also changed. PtCo@sOMC-900-1/3 with the intermetallic compound structure achieves the best kinetic activity as well as durability, indicating its potential for practical application. This work provides a more accurate understanding of the relationship between the alloy structure and the catalytic ORR performance and highlights a feasible strategy to mass-produce cathode catalysts for PEMFC applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0888-5885			WOS:000710928400008

This work addresses the degradation of AuPd bimetallic catalysts used for the electrocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Potential dependent changes in the AuPd surface composition occur because the two metals have different dissolution onset potentials, resulting in catalyst dealloying. Using a scanning flow cell (SFC) with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS), simultaneous Pd and/or Au dissolution can be observed. Thereafter, three accelerated degradation protocols (ADPs), simulating different dissolution regimes, are employed to study the catalyst structure degradation on the nanoscale with identical location (IL) TEM. When only Pd or both Au and Pd dissolve, the composition changes rapidly and the surface becomes enriched with Au, as observed by cyclic voltammetry and elemental mapping. Such changes are mirrored by the evolution of electrocatalytic performances toward H2O2 production. Our experimental findings are finally summarized in a dissolution/structure/selectivity mechanism, providing a clear picture of the degradation of bimetallic catalyst used for H2O2 synthesis.									52	10	0	0	1	0	56			2155-5435			WOS:000410005700016

In this sense, the incorporation of metals in several support materials has been explored to produce novel powerful catalysts. This non-thermal and clean emerging technology allows obtaining unique and varied morphologies as dispersed species, films, and high-surface-area nanoparticles. They are beneficial for use as electrocatalysts of oxygen reduction/evolution reactions in energy storage systems such as batteries, supercapacitors, and fuel cells, surpassing the results of commercial catalysts. In this context, firstly, this review presents a brief introduction of supercritical fluid applications, fundamental aspects, and the combination of deposition techniques. Moreover, kinetic control in modifying the advanced materials was approached. The discussion of how the temperature, pressure, and contact time, and their effects, is still scarce. The CO2 volume rate is not considered a process variable and may improve the performance of supercritical CO2 in the synthesis of deposited nanoparticles. Therefore, we reported the supercritical process conditions in the synthesis of nanostructured nanocomposites materials from 2014 to 2020.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0379-6779			WOS:000603540400008

Herein, we fabricated a nanocomposite of multiwall carbon nanotubes decorated with iron phthalocyanine nanoparticles (FePcNPs@CNTs) using a single-step facile microwave strategy. The morphologies and composition of the FePcNPs and FePcNPs@CNTs were confirmed by using multiple analytical techniques. Further, these materials were taken under the ORR electrocatalytic investigations in O-2-saturated 0.1 M KOH. The results demonstrated the composite FePcNPs@CNTs to have superior ORR activity as evidenced by the significant reduction in over-potential (onset potential, +1.03 V and half-wave potential, + 0.97 V) in comparison to commercial FePc and 20% Pt/C.

The bio-char ribbon edges formed after the decomposition of KF act as the substrate for the epitaxial growth of CCN. The photocatalytic activity in hydrogen (H-2) generation from water splitting has been investigated. Nash Equilibrium from Game Theory has been firstly applied in the analysis of the H-2 generation rates among catalysts. The bio-char ribbon edges at the thin CN layers after carbon doping from KF decomposition improve the charge separation and transfer for the surface H-2 generation reaction. The CCN exhibits superior visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity and the H-2 evolution rate (18.89 mu mol/h) is 67.5 times higher than that of the pristine CN (0.28 mu mol/h). The apparent quantum yields are calculated to be 4.1%, 1.4%, 0.66% for monochromatic light lambda = 420, lambda = 470 and lambda = 550 tun, respectively.									51	5	0	0	3	0	53			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000460495400007

In the process of preparation and transportation,due to its increased oxidation activity, it is easy to spontaneously ignite and induce explosion accidents,which seriously threatens the life safety of operators. In order to prevent the occurrence of PC disasters,it is of great significance to study the influencing factors and prediction,such as the minimum ignition temperature (t_M) corresponding to the ignition delay time (t_i) and other key critical parameters.Through the establishment of the self-ignition evolution experimental system of PC, the pulverized coal with two levels of metamorphism from the Liuhuanggou mine and the Hongliu mine were collected and placed in an equidistant cylindrical reaction tank for a constant temperature oxidation experiment. The influencing factors of the critical parameters of PC spontaneous combustion were analyzed. The mathematical prediction model for the critical parameters of PC spontaneous combustion was established to predict the critical parameters. The results show that oxygen concentration and accumulation thickness are important factors affecting the critical parameters of PC spontaneous combustion. With the decrease in oxygen concentration,MIT and ti of the two types of coal powder increase remarkably. The decrease of oxygen concentration inhibits the reaction of the active structure of PC with oxygen, slows down the heating rate of PC, and then increases the MIT and t_i of pulverized coal. As the thickness of pulverized coal increases, the heat released by pulverized coal oxidation is more likely to accumulate. The minimum ignition temperature of pulverized coal gradually decreases, and the maximum drop can reach 34 ℃. The increase in the thickness of the PC accumulation can slow down the diffusion rate of oxygen into the PC,which shows an increasing trend corresponding to t_i. A linear regression mathematical prediction model is established using linear regression method,which can be used to calculate the critical parameters of pulverized coal spontaneous combustion and provide a basis for the prevention and control of deflagration accidents caused by PC spontaneous combustion.			煤粉广泛应用于火电、化工及冶金领域,在制备及输送过程中,由于氧化活性增强极易自然发火并诱发燃爆事故,严重威胁作业人员生命安全。为预防煤粉灾害事故发生,研究最低着火温度对应着火延迟时间等关键临界参数的影响因素及预测具有重要义。通过搭建煤粉自然发火演化试验系统,采集硫磺沟矿和红柳矿的2种变质程度煤粉,并放置于反应池进行恒温氧化试验,分析了煤粉自然发火临界参数影响因素;同时建立了煤粉自然发火临界参数数学预测模型,对煤粉自然发火临界参数进行预测。结果表明:氧浓度和堆积厚度是影响煤粉自然发火临界参数的重要因素。煤粉的最低着火温度和对应着火延迟时间随氧浓度的降低显著增加,氧浓度降低抑制煤粉活性结构与氧气反应,减缓煤粉的升温速率,进而增加煤粉的最低着火温度和着火延迟时间。随着煤粉堆积厚度的增加,煤粉氧化释放的热量更容易蓄积,煤粉的最低着火温度逐渐降低,最大降幅可达34 ℃。而煤粉堆积厚度的增加可减缓氧气进入煤粉内部的扩散率,对应着火延迟时间表现出增加趋势。利用线性回归方法建立了数学预测模型,可用于计算煤粉自然发火临界参数,为煤粉自然发火引发爆燃事故防控提供了依据。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0253-2336			CSCD:6975798

Despite their highly active ORR performance, the OER catalytic activity of MnO2 species is still far from satisfying. Herein, for the first time, highly active OER catalytic NiFe layered double hydroxides (NiFe LDHs) are combined with MnO2 via a selective electrodeposition method to form a Janus electrode in which the MnO2 and NiFe LDHs are in situ grown on two sides of a porous nickel foam (MnO2-NiFe/Ni). The MnO2-NiFe/Ni electrode exhibits excellent bifunctional catalytic activity and stability for both ORR and OER compared to bare MnO2 on account of the rational design of the Janus bifunctional configuration separating OER and ORR active materials. Moreover, such a Janus MnO2-NiFe air electrode endows the zinc-air battery with better cycling stability and energy efficiency than the bare MnO2 electrode. Our work demonstrates a novel Janus electrode configuration to design high-performance electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion applications.									49	0	0	0	2	0	49			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000491219700031	31538761

These catalysts contained high Pt contents, typically 60-70 at.% or higher, since further decreasing Pt contents would significantly lower the desired electro-catalytic activity. High-entropy alloys (HEAs) with built-in stability through their low free-energy phases provided a promising route to prepare Pt-based alloy catalysts with less than 50 at.% Pt while maintaining high ORR activity and stability in various environments. In this work, we reported a top-down de-alloying synthetic method to controllably incorporate five immiscible metals in one nanoscale solid phase. By predetermining four elements (Al, Cu, Ni and Pt) and alternating the fifth element including Pd, V, Co, Mn, etc., a series of nanoporous HEAs (np-HEAs) with Pt content of similar to 20-30 at.% were obtained. Among these quinary alloys, the Al-Cu-Ni-Pt-Mn np-HEA exhibited the best ORR catalytic activity and electrochemical cycling durability, well exceeding the commercial Pt/C catalysts. We expected these nanostructured HEA would offer a new class of alloy catalysts in many electrochemical reactions. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, a novel MoC-based ORR catalyst with high efficiency is achieved. The proposed catalyst is comprised of ultrasmall-sized MoC nanoparticles (average size similar to 1.5 nm) entrapped into 3D porous frameworks of N-rich graphene (NGr), which is synthesized by using layered C3N4 as a sacrificial template via a facile pyrolytic approach. Possessing unique structural features (including preferential O-2 absorbing sites, good accessibility, favorable conductive and protective 3D frameworks of NGr), the MoC/NGr catalyst exhibits positive onset- and peak- potential at 0.93 and 0.80 V for ORR in alkaline media with good four-electron selectivity (n approximate to 4.0), which is promising and even competitive to commercial Pt/C, particularly in terms of cost-effectiveness, the ease of preparation, significantly improved methanol tolerance, and enhanced stability. Other prospective application of MoC/NGr could also be broadened to biomimic catalysis, energy conversion, storage devices, and so on.									17	3	0	0	0	0	18			1932-7447			WOS:000380735300020

Size accounts for much of the among-species variation in terrestrial transport costs, but species of similar body size can still exhibit severalfold differences in energy expenditure. We compiled measurements of the (mass-specific) minimum cost of pedestrian transport (COTmin, mL/kg/m) for 201 species - by far the largest sample to date - and used phylogenetically informed comparative analyses to investigate possible eco-evolutionary differences in COTmin between various groupings of those species. We investigated number of legs, ectothermy and endothermy, waddling, and nocturnality specifically in lizards. Thus, our study primarily revisited previous theories about variations in COTmin between species, testing them with much more robust analyses. Having accounted for mass, while residual COTmin did not differ between bipedal and other species, specifically waddling bipeds were found to have relatively high COTmin. Furthermore, nocturnal lizards have relatively low COTmin although temperature does not appear to affect COTmin in ectotherms. Previous studies examining across-species variation in COTmin from a biomechanical perspective show that the differences between waddling birds and nonwaddling species, and between nocturnal lizards and other ecotherms, are likely to be attributable to differences in ground reaction forces, posture, and effective limb length.									9	0	0	0	8	0	9			2045-7758			WOS:000384527200024	27777742

Herein, a Janus-structured flexible free-standing bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst, with OER-active O, N co-coordinated Ni single atoms and ORR-active Co3O4@Co1-xS nanosheet arrays being separately integrated at the inner and outer walls of flexible hollow carbon nanofibers (Ni-SAs/HCNFs/Co-NAs), is reported. Benefiting from the sophisticated topological structure and atomic-level-designed chemical compositions, Ni-SAs/ HCNFs/Co-NAs exhibits outstanding bifunctional catalytic activity with the delta E index of 0.65 V, representing the current state-of-the-art flexible free-standing bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalyst. Impressively, the Ni-SAs/HCNFs/Co-NAs-based liquid ZAB show a high open-circuit potential (1.45 V), high capacity (808 mAh g(-1) Zn), and extremely long life (over 200 h at 10 mA cm(-2)), and the assembled flexible all-solid-state ZABs have excellent cycle stability (over 80 h).

However, the nonpolar N-2 triple bond (N N) and competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) cause eNRR to be far away from practical applications. Hence, the multifunctional composite catalysts are designed to overcome the extreme conditions by the combinaton of surface engineering and structural design. Benefiting from the oxygen vacancy (O-v), phase heterogeneous interface and functional porous carbon matrix, O-v-TiO2@C/Cu possesses superior eNRR performance that NH3 yield and Faradaic efficiency achieve 16.10 mu g h(-1) mg(-1) at -0.60 V vs. RHE and 6.04% at -0.55 V vs. RHE, respectively. On the basis of the in-situ Raman spectra analysis, the characteristic peaks of O-Ti-O symmetric stretching vibration and phase heterogeneous structure gradually become weak under the various potentials electrolysis, which indicates that O-v and heterogeneous interface can serve as electron trappers and active sites to absorb N-2. The rational combination of surface engineering and composite structure design for creating active sites will open new avenues beyond the use of noble metal-based catalysts for eNRR.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000723979000005

To advance the fundamentals of this promising mechanism, we investigate herein the cationic-anionic redox processes in Li2Ru0.23Sn0.23O3-a model Li-rich layered cathode in which Ru (cationic) and O (anionic) are the only redox-active sites. We reveal its charge compensation mechanism and local structural evolutions by applying operando (and complementary ex situ) X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Among other local effects, the anionic-oxidation-driven distortion of the oxygen network around Ru atoms is thereby visualized. Oxidation of lattice oxygen is also directly proven via hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES). Furthermore, we demonstrate a spectroscopy-driven visualization of electrochemical reaction paths, which enabled us to neatly decouple the individual cationic-anionic dQ/dV contributions during cycling. We hence establish the redox and structural origins of all dQ/dV features and demonstrate the vital role of anionic redox in hysteresis and kinetics. These fundamental insights about Li-rich systems are crucial for improving the existing anionic-redox-based cathodes and evaluating the ones being discovered rapidly.									75	1	1	0	3	0	75			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000416877400014

This work investigates the role of oxygen vacancy (Ov) in the Cu/TiO2 catalysts, which are promising for this reaction. The TiO(2-x)support was pre-reduced in high-pressure H-2 gas at different tem-peratures to generate Ov with different concentrations. Cu/TiO2-x-500 with TiO2 pre-reduced at 500 & DEG;C showed much higher CO2 conversion and CH3OH selectivity than the other Cu/TiO2 catalysts. The Ov in the reduced TiO2 induced a strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between Cu and TiO2 at relatively low temperatures. Although the SMSI caused partial covering of the Cu nanoparticles by TiO2-x, the Ov in the newly formed interface could facilitate the activation of the CO2 molecules and promote the forma-tion of the proper reaction intermediates for methanol formation. Various characterizations, including DFT calculations, revealed the detailed structural evolution of CO2 to methanol on the Cu/TiO2 catalyst, and it follows the Formate pathway.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, by combining the concept of single-atom catalysts and multiple active sites, we design heteronuclear dual-atom catalysts to break through the stubborn restriction of scaling relations on catalytic activity. Twenty-one kinds of heteronuclear transition-metal dimers are embedded in monolayer C2N as potential dual-atom catalysts. First-principles calculations reveal that by adjusting the components of dimers, the two metal atoms play the role of carbon adsorption sites and oxygen adsorption sites respectively, which results in the decoupling of adsorption energies of key intermediates. Free energy profiles demonstrate that CO2 can be efficiently reduced to CH4 on CuCr/C2N and CuMn/C2N with low limiting potentials of -0.37 V and -0.32 V, respectively. This study suggests that the introduction of multiple active sites into porous two-dimensional materials would provide a great possibility for breaking scaling relations to achieve efficient multi-intermediate electrocatalytic reactions.									97	3	0	0	1	0	97			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000515704400003	34123273

Using shapememory photonic crystals (SMPCs) with tunable wettability as 3D/2D macroporous supports, we reveal for the first time the bubble evolution on the SMM by structure color. The evolution of oxygen bubbles generated by the film was accompanied by a red/blue shift structural color, which is convenient for analyzing the evolution process. The color contrast is produced by gas-liquid exchange triggered by Laplacian pressure in the macropores, which is regulated by surface wettability. Importantly, the pressure-induced reversible deformation of macropores adjusts surface wettability and promotes the corresponding gas-liquid exchange, enhancing the color contrast. It makes it possible to reveal bubble evolution in liquids with different wettability. Moreover, 2D bowlshaped SMPCs with bubble anti-adhesion can be constructed by scraping 3D inverse opals. The reversible deformation of bowls can realize the switch between bubble adhesion and anti-adhesion. It improves our understanding of bubble evolution and inspires us to fabricate the next generation of interfacial catalysts, structured electrodes, and mass transfer interfaces.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000713306800001

Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)								e2205228	e2205228		10.1002/smll.202205228				2022-Nov-03	2022	The development of nonprecious metal catalysts with both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) is very important for Zn-air batteries (ZABs). Herein, a Co5.47 N particles and Fe single atoms co-doped hollow carbon nanofiber self-supporting membrane (H-CoFe@NCNF) is synthesized by a coaxial electrospinning strategy combined with pyrolysis. X-ray absorption fine spectroscopy analyses confirm the state of the cobalt nitride and Fe single atoms. As a result, H-CoFe@NCNF exhibits a superior bifunctional performance of Eonset = 0.96V for ORR, and Ej = 10 = 1.68V for OER. Density functional theory calculations show that H-CoFe@NCNF has a moderate binding strength to oxygen due to the coexistence of nanoparticle and single atoms. Meanwhile, the Co site is more favorable to the OER, while the Fe site facilitates the ORR, and the proton and charge transfer between N and metal atoms further lower the reaction barriers. The liquid ZAB composed of H-CoFe@NCNF has a charge-discharge performance of 1100 h and a peak power density of 205mW cm-2 . The quasi-solid-state ZAB assembled by the self-supporting membrane of H-CoFe@NCNF is proven to operate stably in any bending condition.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1613-6829		MEDLINE:36328702	36328702	
J	Bugyi, L; Solymosi, F								Adsorption and dissociation of dimethyl ether on clean and oxygen-dosed Rh(111)								SURFACE SCIENCE				385	2-3			365	375		10.1016/S0039-6028(97)00263-X				AUG 10 1997	1997	The interaction of dimethyl ether (DME) with clean and oxygen-covered Rh(111) surfaces has been investigated by TDS and HREELS. The adsorption of DME on the clean Rh(111) surface was reversible at 100 K; all the adsorbed DME was released to the gas phase after annealing without any sign of decomposition. On increasing the adsorption temperature to 250-300 K, the appearance of an intense HREELS feature at 1230 cm(-1) indicated that a reaction channel opened up for the thermally activated decomposition of DME. The reaction intermediate of this process was tentatively identified as CHO or CHxOCHx(a) species, the decomposition of which resulted in adsorbed CO and hydrogen. On the O-precovered Rh(111) surface, a fraction of DME was stabilised in a state characterized by T-p = 245 K. On the other hand, the interaction of DME with adsorbed O led to the formation of CH3O(a) species at 100-195 K. Above 250 K, this species is decomposed and oxidized, leading to the evolution of H2O and CO2. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.									25	2	0	0	0	0	25			0039-6028			WOS:A1997YB53500031		
J	Du, Xiaoqiang; Ma, Guangyu; Zhang, Xiaoshuang								Boosting alkaline water splitting and the urea electrolysis kinetic process of a Co3O4 nanosheet by electronic structure modulation of F, P co-doping								DALTON TRANSACTIONS				51	12			4909	4918		10.1039/d2dt00138a		FEB 2022		MAR 22 2022	2022	Designing non-precious metal electrocatalysts for accelerated electron transfer and richer active site exposure is necessary and challenging to achieve the versatility of electrocatalysts. In this research, a self-grown nanosheet array electrocatalyst on nickel foam with high structural stability is first rationally designed through suitable anionic doping. The combined experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that the F-P-Co3O4/NF material optimizes the adsorption energy of hydrogen/water through electron coupling, and its nanosheet structure provides abundant active sites, accelerating the mass and electron transfer in the reaction process. It is worth noting that the as-developed F-P-Co3O4/NF materials exhibit outstanding catalytic activity for overpotentials of 192 and 110 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction and the hydrogen evolution reaction in 1 M KOH, respectively. More notably, an assembled F-P-Co3O4/NF//F-P-Co3O4/NF alkaline electrolytic cell requires only an ultra-low cell voltage of 1.53 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is one of the best activities reported so far. Furthermore, F-P-Co3O4/NF also shows excellent performance for urea electrolysis. Theoretical calculations show that the superior activity of the F-P-Co3O4/NF catalyst is attributed to the optimal electron configuration and the lower Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption due to co-doping of P and F. The work provides an alternative solution for the preparation of electrocatalysts with high structural stability, high catalytic activity and multifunction for alkaline water splitting and urea electrolysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000766256400001	35262158

In the present paper, the behaviour (evolution of methane and oxygen concentration, volumetric water content and temperature) and performance under freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) conditions are investigated by column experiments. In the utilizing of column experiments, three columns are developed, manufactured, prepared and treated by a period of methane injection (0 FTC), after 1 FTC and 2 FTCs, in three respective stages. One column is instrumented with various sensors to monitor the evolution of temperature, volumetric water content, settlement and gas composition at four different depths for one of the biocover columns. In addition, laboratory testing is carded out on the biocover samples with regards to their organic content and grain size distribution. The results show that two FTCs have effect on the methane removal of compost biocover as well as influence the evolution of the volumetric water content, temperature, settlement, gas composition and organic content of the biocover. However, these effects and influence are more significant in the upper layers (<= 15 cm) of the compost biocover column. The results presented in this paper will contribute to a better design of landfill biocovers in cold regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The catalytic performance of the fabricated N-S-GAs towards the ORR is assessed by electrochemical test techniques. The effects of pyrolyzing temperature on catalytic activity are also studied. The binding states of N and S atoms have a great influence on the electrocatalytic activity for the ORR. The N-S-GAs gained after pyrolysis at 900 degrees C (N-S-GAs 900) demonstrate higher electrocatalytic activity and diffusion-limiting current density, better stability and methanol tolerance. The excellent performance for the ORR on N-S-GAs is attributed to the interconnected porous network, conductive multiplexed pathways of N-S-GAs, greater electrocatalytically active site exposure and the synergistic effect originating from the doped N and S in the graphene sheets.									31	3	0	0	6	0	33			2046-2069			WOS:000371716300066

In this context, visible light-based photocatalytic water splitting with low-dimensional semiconducting materials is proposed to produce sustainable energy. Here we optimized the sequential of organic electron-rich heterocyclic monomer namely benzothiadiazole (BTD) quenched within polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) semiconductor via copolymerization, thereby assembling a sanctum of donor -n-acceptor (D -n-A) photocatalysts. The selection of BTD is based on the benzene ring, which consequently anticipating a n cross-linker unit for hydrogen and oxygen evolution. A hydrogen evolution rates (HER) of 88.2 mu mol/h for pristine PCN and 744.2 mu mol/h for PCN-BTD008 (eight times higher than pure PCN) are observed. Additionally, a remarkable apparent quantum yield (AQY) of about 58.6% at 420 nm has been observed for PCN-BTD008. Likewise, the oxygen evolution rate (OER) data reflect the generation of 0.2 mu mol/h1 (visible) and 1.6 mu mol/h1 (non-visible) for pure PCN. Though, OER of PCN-BTD008 is found to be 2.2 mu mol/h1 (visible) and 14.8 mu mol/h1 (non visible), which are economically better than pure PCN. As such, the results show an important step toward modifying the design and explain a vital part of the D -n-A scheme at a balanced theme for fruitful photocatalysts intended for future demand.

Recent significant efforts to develop precious metal free catalysts have resulted in excellent catalytic activities. However, complicated and time-consuming synthesis processes have negated the cost benefit. Moreover, detailed analysis about catalytically active sites and the role of each element in these high-performance catalysts containing nanomaterials for large surface areas are often lacking. Here we report a facile one-step synthesis method of nitrogen-iron coordinated carbon nanotube (CNT) catalysts without precious metals. Our catalysts show excellent long-term stability and onset ORR potential comparable to those of other precious metal free catalysts, and the maximum limiting current density from our catalysts is larger than that of the Pt-based catalysts. We carry out a series of synthesis and characterization experiments with/without iron and nitrogen in CNT, and identify that the coordination of nitrogen and iron in CNT plays a key role in achieving the excellent catalytic performances. We anticipate our one-step process could be used for mass production of precious metal free electrocatalysts for a wide range of electrochemical cells including fuel cells and metal-air batteries.

Heterosis and outbreeding depression can both be observed but the effect of environmental stressors on the occurrence of these phenomena is still poorly understood. We tested the influence of oxygen stress during embryonic development on consequences of outbreeding in wild populations of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). We used a common garden experiment and performed crosses within and between salmon populations to study performances of embryos reared under normal and hypoxic conditions. We detected both heterosis and outbreeding depression depending on traits but irrespective of divergence between parental populations. Nevertheless, outbreeding depression was observed almost exclusively under hypoxic conditions and prevailed over heterosis regarding survival during the whole embryonic development. Notably, the post-hatching survival of all between population crosses was approximately 15 % lower than the survival of within-population crosses under hypoxic conditions. Different hypoxia reaction norms for post-hatching survival, length and time to hatch were also noticed among within and between populations crosses further indicating outbreeding depression. These results demonstrate that consequences of outbreeding can dramatically vary depending on environmental conditions with outbreeding depression being possibly stronger under stressful conditions.									8	0	0	0	8	0	8			0071-3260	1934-2845		WOS:000344862900005

Despite tremendous efforts, large-scale and controllable production of highly-active M/C nanocomposites for electrocatalysis remains a great challenge. Herein, we report a tunable and general strategy tandem plasma reaction (TPR) for manufacturing a series of carbon encapsulated Ni/C nanocomposites with different compositions. Benefiting from the synergistic effect between the conductive carbon layer and Ni nanoparticles, the electrocatalytic performance can be adjusted to an optimal state. A volcano shape dependence between electrocatalytic activity and the percentage of carbon is presented experimentally. With the simplicity and intelligence of the approach, the strategy based on tandem plasma reaction presents great potential to the preparation of extendable metal/carbon nanocomposites for versatile applications.

Herein, we propose a new composite catalyst via a two-step method, including the in-situ growth of Ni12P5 on the nickel foam (NF) substrate, and subsequently, the Ni3Se2/MoO2@Ni12P5/NF catalyst is synthesized by the rapid electrodeposition of Ni3Se2/MoO2 on the Ni12P5. The prepared Ni3Se2/MoO2@Ni12P5/NF demonstrates a hierarchical and heterogeneous structure with abundant Schottky vacancies, displaying an ultra-low potential of 1.277 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel value of 53.8 mV dec(-1), which are comparable to those of noble metal-based catalysts. In addition, the performance retention is 97.4% after the durability test for 120 h, demonstrating its remarkable stability for the UOR. The electrochemical results show that Schottky vacancies are beneficial to the adsorption of OH- and release O-2 from the electrode surface, leading to the enhanced catalytic performance.

Recent interest in this topic has been driven by observations that the reaction selectivity and rates of electrocatalytic processes for energy storage and renewable fuel synthesis can profoundly change with electrolyte pH. Further, a subset of these reactions, such as CO and CO2 reduction, are often carried out under near-neutral bulk pH conditions. Such conditions, in combination with insufficient mass transport and limited pH buffer capacity, can lead to substantial deviations of the near-electrode pH from the bulk pH of the electrolyte. Such pH gradients, together with electrodes whose surface chemistry is highly dependent on pH, can give rise to complex feedback between the reactions that are catalyzed on the surface and the local pH conditions and surface speciation. In this Perspective, we discuss representative studies that characterize and quantify the effects of (local) pH on electrocatalysis with innovative experimental and theoretical methods. We further highlight possible future directions of investigation.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000693413400002

The late transition metals (Cu, Ag, Au, Ni, Pd, Pt, Co, Rh, Ir, Fe, Ru, Os) and some p (B, Al, Ga) and s (Mg) metals comprised the center of the porphyrin ring. A clear difference in catalytic properties compared to extended metal surfaces was observed owing to a different electronic nature of the active site. The preference to bind hydrogen, however, becomes a major obstacle in the reaction path. A possible solution to this problem is to reduce CO instead of CO2. Volcano plots were constructed on the basis of scaling relations of reaction intermediates, and from these plots the reaction steps with the highest overpotentials were deduced. The Rh-porphyrin-like fimctionalized graphene was identified as the most active catalyst for producing methanol from CO, featuring an overpotential of 0.22 V. Additionally, we have also examined the hydrogen evolution and oxidation reaction, and in their case, too, Rh-porphyrin turned out to be the best catalyst with an overpotential of 0.15 V.									218	5	0	0	16	0	220			1932-7447			WOS:000318892000018

Thin films prepared by sol-gel methods exhibit phase-pure orthorhombic GFO with thePc21nspace group, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Optical responses are characterized by a 2.72 eV interband transition and sub-bandgap d-d transitions associated with octahedral and tetrahedral coordination of Fe(3+)sites. DFT-HSE06 electronic structure calculations show GFO is highly ionic with very low dispersion in the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveals n-type conductivity with a flat band potential (U-fb) of 0.52 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, indicating that GFO has the most positive CBM reported of any ferrite. The photoelectrochemical oxidation of SO(3)(2-)shows an ideal semiconductor-electrolyte interfacial behavior with no evidence of surface recombination down to theU(fb). Surprisingly, the onset potential for the oxygen evolution reaction also coincides with theU(fb), showing interfacial hole-transfer efficiency above 50%. The photoelectrochemical properties are limited by bulk recombination due to the short-diffusion length of minority carriers as well as slow transport of majority carriers. Strategies towards developing high-efficiency GFO photoanodes are briefly discussed.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000580968700001

Thin layers of nickel oxide were deposited step by step by reactive sputter deposition and analyzed in-situ after each step using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This was performed for silicon with different surface preparations: H-termination, thermally grown oxide (2 angstrom) and a monolayer of native oxide (4 angstrom). Upon contact formation the initial flatband like situation in the Si substrates changed to a 0.35 to 0.4 eV upward band bending for all three heterojunctions, with an alignment of the valence bands favorable to hole extraction. With near identical heterojunction performance and identical NiOx catalyst layers (eta(10 mA/cm(2)) = 0.44 +/- 0.01 V vs. RHE on Ni) an equally identical performance for the OER would be expected. While the native oxide covered sample shows the expected performance in cyclic voltammetry measurements the others fall short of expectations. Using chopped light measurements, this under-performance could be attributed to a higher density of defect states at the silicon surface. Apparently a 4 angstrom SiO2 layer is sufficient protection to prevent the formation of defect states during NiOx deposition, thinner protective layers or none at all result in increased defect states, while thicker layers perform poorly due to their high resistance.

Herein, heterostructures of CuS/MnCO3 on nickel foam substrate are firstly successfully synthesized via a facile one-step hydrothermal strategy. The as-prepared electrocatalyst displays an enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in alkaline conditions with a minimum overpotential of 70 mV and a small Tafel slope of 42.5 mV/dec to achieve 10 mA cm(-2). The catalyst also exhibits an excellent HER activity with a low overpotential of 143 mV and the Tafel slope of 51.4 mV/dec to acquire 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. Moreover, when the CuS/MnCO3//CuS/MnCO3 electrode is applied for the overall water splitting, the electrolyzer cell device affords 10 mA cm(-2) at a relative low voltage of 1.43 V, which is one of the best catalysts ever reported. In stability test, its activity first decreases and then remains stable in 1 M KOH solution for about 10 h, indicating that the electrode has good electrochemical stability. Density functional theory calculations (DFT) show that MnCO3 has a stronger adsorption energy for water than CuS does, indicating that MnCO3 is a real active center and CuS plays a certain synergistic effect. This work not only provides a low-cost and efficient bifunctional catalyst for water splitting technology, but also extends the application of bifunctional catalyst based on transition metal sulfide and carbonate compound.

Nano-micro letters				14	1			211	211		10.1007/s40820-022-00953-y				2022 Nov 01	2022	Formate can be synthesized electrochemically by CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) or formaldehyde oxidation reaction (FOR). The CO2RR approach suffers from kinetic-sluggish oxygen evolution reaction at the anode. To this end, an electrochemical system combining cathodic CO2RR with anodic FOR was developed, which enables the formate electrosynthesis at ultra-low voltage. Cathodic CO2RR employing the BiOCl electrode in H-cell exhibited formate Faradaic efficiency (FE) higher than 90% within a wide potential range from -0.48 to -1.32 VRHE. In flow cell, the current density of 100mAcm-2 was achieved at -0.67 VRHE. The anodic FOR using the Cu2O electrode displayed a low onset potential of -0.13 VRHE and nearly 100% formate and H2 selectivity from 0.05 to 0.35 VRHE. The CO2RR and FOR were constructed in a flow cell through membrane electrode assembly for the electrosynthesis of formate, where the CO2RR//FOR delivered an enhanced current density of 100mAcm-2 at 0.86V. This work provides a promising pair-electrosynthesis of value-added chemicals with high FE and low energy consumption.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2150-5551		MEDLINE:36319899	36319899

This in-situ synthesis method involves hydrothermal reaction followed by moderate thermal annealing which guarantees the uniform distribution of the MoS2-WS2 heterojunctions within graphene matrix. The presence of 3D conductive and porous graphene network and the combined merits of MoS2 and WS2 endow the resulting 3D MoS2-WS2/graphene nanohybrids with unique conductivity pathways and channels for electrons and with outstanding electrocatalytic performance towards enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This 3D nanohybrid delivered the small overpotential of 110 mV, and the small Tafel slope of 41 mV per dec, demonstrating high HER activity. Furthermore, the resulting nanohybrids exhibit excellent stability as very trivial drop in the current density was noticed even after 2000 cycles. The superior electrocatalytic performance of 3D MoS2-WS2/graphene over other non-precious metal electrocatalysts is accredited to the robust synergism of 2D MoS2-WS2 with 3D graphene that offer ample active sites and improved conductivity for HER. The proposed approach can be further extended to modify other layered transition metal dichalcogenides with hierarchical 3D porous structure as a competent electrocatalysts for HER.

It is more focused to research about the preparation of efficient electrocatalysts, which catalyze hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media at low over potential. Platinum is known as an ideal option, but its rarity and high-cost limit its application in practical industrial plants. Hence, minimizing the level of it can be a solution. It can be achieved by the decoration of platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) on the different composites such as poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene, PEDOT) and sulfonated graphene nanosheets (SG) in this work. Accordingly, the successful preparation and HER electrocatalytic manner of this nanocomposite were main objectives in the present report. The related characterization and performance were monitored using various analytical and electrochemical techniques. The low charge transfer resistance (around 50 0), low over potential (-0.040 V vs. RHE), and stable manner (until 500 cycles) resulted in this HER electrocatalyst. It was controlled by Tafel reaction with electrochemical adsorption desorption because of kinetic factors including Tafel slope (28.4 mV dec(-1)), charge transfer coefficient of 2.0, and exchange current of 7.27 mA cm(-2).

J	Wang, Yajing; Zhu, Quanxi; Xie, Taiping; Peng, Yuan; Liu, Songli; Wang, Jiankang					Wang, Jiankang/0000-0002-7731-4548			Promoted Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Performance of Ru/C by Introducing TiO2 Nanoparticles								CHEMELECTROCHEM				7	5			1182	1186		10.1002/celc.201902170				MAR 2 2020	2020	Higher water dissociation (Volmer step) energy barrier leads to the sluggish alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) rate. Since hydrophilic TiO2 can reduce water dissociation barrier while the widely studied Ru has nearly zero hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy, the combination of TiO2 and Ru/C might collectively enhance Volmer and Heyrovsky/Tafel step and finally promote HER performance. Herein, Ru/C-TiO2 with average size of 3.6 nm for Ru was synthesized by a two-step process. It presented superior alkaline HER activity with eta(10) of 44 mV, better than that of Ru/C (107 mV), Pt/C (84 mV) and C-TiO2 with negligible activity. The prominent HER performance was due to synergistic effect between TiO2 and Ru, which greatly expedited water dissociation for intermediate hydrogen production and the following electrochemical hydrogen desorption for producing H-2. This work combines specific active sites for different elementary steps and then boosts alkaline HER performance, which provide a guide for designing efficient and stable HER electrocatalyst.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2196-0216			WOS:000519650500017

Multi-metal oxides have been explored as efficient electrocatalysts for the OER; however, the ideal elemental composition for multi-metal oxides is unknown. We first performed density functional theory calculations, which predicted that Co oxyhydroxides doped with Fe and V have excellent catalytic activity. We synthesized a series of amorphous Co-Fe-V ternary metal oxides with a precisely controlled metal molar composition (denoted as CoaFebVcOx, wherea+b+c= 10), uniformly distributed elements and identical morphologies by using Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) as novel metal precursors. A systematic investigation was carried out to establish correlations between the elemental compositions and the OER activity for CoaFebVcOx, resulting in a comprehensive catalytic activity atlas of ternary Co-Fe-V metal oxides for the OER, which can serve as a roadmap for electrocatalyst development. In particular, Co(3)Fe(4)V(3)O(x)with an elemental composition of Co : Fe : V = 3 : 4 : 3 shows the best performance, with an overpotential of merely 249 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and a low Tafel slope of 41 mV dec(-1), outperforming a commercial IrO(x)catalyst. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis reveals strong electronic synergies among the metal cations in CoaFebVcOx. The V and Fe doping can affect the electronic structure of Co to yield nearly optimal adsorption energies for OER intermediates, giving rise to the superior activity. Furthermore, composition-tuneable and uniform PBAs may serve as versatile and efficient metal precursors to produce many more multi-metal oxides for various renewable energy applications.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000560225400053

A facile solvothermal process was used to prepare ultrathin noble-metal-free 2 D biphasic MoSe2 nanosheets composed of a metastable metallic 1T phase and a semiconducting 2H phase. High metallic 1T phase content and few-layer-thick MoSe2 nanosheets were obtained by tuning the amount of NaBH4 used in the reaction. The optimal integration of a metallic 1T phase and an environmentally stable 2H phase in MoSe2 electrocatalysts provides abundant active sites and good conductivity beneficial for the HER. The combination of experimental results and DFT calculations implies that the electrocatalytic activity for the HER on the MoSe2 surface goes through a collaborative Heyrovsky and Volmer reaction process. The theoretical studies suggest that the presence of 1T-MoSe2 could reduce the band energy relative to 2H-MoSe2 and, consequently, accelerate the sluggish HER kinetics of 2H-MoSe2. This work provides valuable and novel insights into the understanding of the structure-activity relationships in 2 D transition metal dichalcogenide electrocatalysts.									30	3	0	0	0	0	30			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000490644800001	31538408

Herein, controllable turn off/on fluorescent sensors for label-free detection of glucose have been successfully developed by designing different DNA/ligand-based ensembles and using the enzyme-catalyzed Fenton reaction. The sensing approach is essentially based on enzymatic manipulation of a DNA-mediated ensemble through cascade reactions, including oxidation of glucose by oxygen to yield hydrogen peroxide, the Fenton reaction of H2O2 resulting in the formation of aggressive hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot), and then the oxidative cleavage of ssDNA with (OH)-O-center dot. Interestingly, the fact that the properties of DNA-mediated ensembles are highly dependent on the nature of ligands opens the opportunity to modulate the response patterns of fluorescent probes to glucose simply by choosing some appropriate ligands. Additionally, the protocol shows excellent selectivity, and visual detection is possible with the aid of an UV transilluminator. Moreover, this method can also be extended as a novel analytical platform for other reactions that involve the H2O2 concentration evolution.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2				2046-2069		WOS:000374045900090

Herein, we report the synthesis of a cheap and high-efficiency electro-catalyst based on Co9S8 nanoparticles decorated with Co-N-C sites well anchored to metal-porous organic polymer (MPOP)-derived N, S-codoped carbon (Co-IM-POP-1000), which exhibits pronounced trifunctional electrocatalytic activity for ORR, OER and HER, simultaneously, in alkaline media. Consequently, breathing Zn-air batteries (ZABs) employing Co-IM-POP-1000 as the sole catalysts present prominent performance, i. e., the charge/discharge voltage, power and energy density, specific capacity, rate performance as well as the lifetime, outperforming that of Pt/C 20% + RuO2 counterparts, which could be regenerated and maintained at the same performance level for subsequent runs by simply replenishing the Zn anode and electrolyte. An alkaline water splitting system using the IM-POP-Co-1000 as catalyst for overall water splitting affords a cell voltage as low as 1.60 V at 10 mA cm(-2). A self-driven water splitting system powered by the home-made ZABs is demonstrated using IM-POP-Co-1000 as the sole catalyst in 0.1 M KOH, giving a high H-2 evolution rate of 0.244 mmol h(-1). These novel metal-POPs provides an effective strategy to prepare high-performance POPs for special applica-tions. Therefore, this study shows a promising approach for the utilization of low cost and massive producible POPs as precursor for the preparation of stable and efficient trifunctional electro-catalyst toward clear energy applications.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2213-2929	2213-3437		WOS:000788089600003

The thickness along the [001] direction of the BFO NPs can be controlled by varying the SDBS content, and the decreased thickness plays multiple roles in improving the photocatalytic water oxidation performance: (1) increasing the distortion and asymmetries of the FeO4 tetrahedral and FeO6 octahedral units, and enhancing the built-in electric field in the BFO NPs accordingly, to facilitate the efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs; (2) reducing the migration distance of holes to the surface of the both oxygen- and bismuth-enriched {001} facets; (3) promoting the exposure of {001} facets of the BFO NPs which facilitates hole accumulation and provides more active sites to accelerate surface oxidation reaction. As a result, the as-prepared BFO-2 sample with optimized thickness exhibits the best photocatalytic water oxidation performance under visible-light irradiation, achieving the O-2 evolution rate of 461.08 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), about 7.87 times higher than BFO NPs prepared without using SDBS. The built-in electric field for BFO and its role in photocatalytic water oxidation process are reported for the first time. This work provides new insights into improving intrinsic activity of individual semiconductor photocatalyst by morphology and structure modulation and charge behavior regulation.									53	1	0	0	2	0	53			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000507465200144

Given that reactants, or potentially holes/electrons, need to diffuse into the porous framework as the reaction proceeds, the reaction can possibly take place within the bulk of the particle or be confined to a thin layer at the surface due to transport limitations. Herein, a simple steady-state reaction-diffusion kinetic model is developed to diagnose these two mutually exclusive behaviors in MOF-based systems. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) driven by a chemical oxidant is presented as an example mechanism. Quantitative metrics for assigning either bulk or surface reactivity are delineated over a wide variety of conditions, and numerical simulations are employed to verify these results. For each case, expressions for the turnover frequency (TOF) are outlined, and it is shown that surface reactivity can influence measured TOFs. Importantly, this report shows how to transition from surface to bulk reactivity and thus identifies which experimental parameters to target for optimizing the efficiency of MOF-based molecular catalyst systems.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000550969100022	33209240

To do so, a physicochemical transport model was used accounting for (i) reversible redox reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface, (ii) charge transport in the electrode, (iii) ion intercalation into the pseudocapacitive electrode, (iv) electric double layer formation, and (v) ion electrodiffusion in binary and symmetric electrolytes. Typical Nyquist plots generated by EIS of redox active electrodes were reproduced numerically for a wide range of electrode electrical conductivity, electrolyte thickness, redox reaction rate constant, and bias potential. The electrode, bulk electrolyte, charge transfer, and mass transfer resistances could be unequivocally identified from the Nyquist plots. The electrode and bulk electrolyte resistances were independent of the bias potential, while the sum of the charge and mass transfer resistances increased with increasing bias potential. Finally, these results and interpretation were confirmed experimentally for LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 and MoS2 electrodes in organic electrolytes.									79	1	0	0	3	0	79			1932-7447			WOS:000449308400001

The properties of the binding site for Ca2+ in this reaction resemble those of other Ca2+ binding proteins, and recent X-ray structural data confirm that the metal is in fact ligated at least in part by amino acid side chain oxo anions. Removal of Ca2+ blocks water oxidation chemistry at an early stage in the cycle of redox reactions that result in O-O bond formation, and the intimate involvement of Ca2+ in this reaction that is implied by this result is confirmed by an ever-improving set of crystal structures of the cyanobacterial enzyme. Here, we revisit the photosystem II Ca2+ site, in part to discuss the additional information that has appeared since our earlier review of this subject (van Gorkom HJ, Yocum CF In: Wydrzynski TJ, Satoh K (eds) Photosystem II: the light-driven water:plastoquinone oxidoreductase), and also to reexamine earlier data, which lead us to conclude that all S-state transitions require Ca2+.									51	2	0	0	39	0	52			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000248806500002	17235491

However, their catalytic activities are still inferior to noble-metal-based oxides. Although increasing the number of catalytically active sites and improving the intrinsic activityviastructural engineering at the atomic level are of great significance for improving the activity during electrocatalysis, it still remains challenging to actualize this in a desirable manner. Here, a triple structure design combining amorphization, 2D nanosheet fabrication, and Fe doping simultaneously is developed to promote the activity of InPO4, an electrochemically inert metal phosphate, as a model catalyst for highly efficient water oxidation. Systematic experiments and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the triple structure design induces unique structural merits, including the maximum exposure of Fe-dopant highly active sites, an outer 2D morphology with a thickness of 1.57 nm, and a local structure with inner disorder and abundant surface defects; these contribute to a simultaneous increase in the number of catalytically active sites and an enhancement in the intrinsic activity of the model catalyst. The engineered InPO(4)model catalyst exhibits outstanding OER performance (requiring overpotentials of only 230 and 284 mV for current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), which are comparable and even better values than most state-of-the-art OER electrocatalysts). Furthermore, the triple structure design strategy could also be explored to enhance the OER performance of other metal phosphates, such as M-x(PO4)(Y)(M = Co, Ni, Bi, V), indicating its generality and efficiency.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000569873400032

Herein, a self-supported Cu3P/Ni2P hybrid on nickel foam (Cu3P/Ni2P@NF) is prepared by a simple galvanic replacement reaction coupled with phosphorization. Subsequently, Cu3P/Ni2P@NF is modified by conducting cyclic voltammetry scans in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. Interestingly, after electrochemical tuning, the as-prepared Cu3P/Ni2P@NF exhibits significantly enhanced HER activity. Particularly, the resultant Cu3P/Ni2P@NF catalyst after 4000 cycles exhibits superior catalytic activity and long-term stability for HER with an overpotential of only 67 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and a low Tafel slope of 43.9 mV dec(-1). The improved HER performance is attributed to the increased intrinsic activity of the Cu3P/Ni2P@NF with its optimized crystal and electronic structure, as well as an increased number of accessible active sites due to surface dissolution and recrystallization induced by electrochemical modification.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000850524100001	36069501

A newly-designed fixed-bed reactor was used to conduct gasification experiments using Victorian brown coal at 800 degrees C. The chars prepared from the gasification experiments were then collected and subjected to reactivity characterisation (ex-situ reactivity) using TGA (thermogravimetric analyser) in air. The results indicate that the char reactivity from TGA was generally high when the char experienced intensive gasification reactions in 0.3% O-2 in the fixed-bed reactor. The addition of steam into the gasification not only enhanced the char conversion significantly but also reduced the char reactivity dramatically. The curve shapes of the char reactivity with involvement of steam were very different from that with O-2 gasification, implying the importance of gasifying agents to char properties.

PEDOT is a polymer of EDOT (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene monomer), a pi-conjugated conductive polymer with superior performance and wide application. It has a rigid and linear conformation, which is necessary to maintain the integrity of the material structure and prevent collapse. And this conformation is also conducive to charge transport and crystallization, resulting in good performance of high charge/discharge capacities, fast response time and high sensing ability. Herein through the pre-implantation of PEDOT nanowires, the structural collapse, anisotropic shrinkage and Co atom agglomeration of ZIF-67 in the pyrolysis process were inhibited, and S,N co-doping was realized at the same time. The XRD, SEM, TEM and XPS characterization studies prove that PEDOT nanowires successfully embedded in the ZIF-67 structure, and N and S are doped into the carbon framework of the catalyst. The synthesized catalyst has a regular hexahedral morphology, interconnected three-dimensional (3D) nanowire (NW) framework and graphitized carbon coated Co nanoparticles (Co/C@NS NWs), endowing it with excellent bifunctional catalytic performance toward oxygen. The initial potential was 0.91 V (vs. RHE) and the limiting current density was -4.8 mA cm(-2) for the ORR. The potential required to reach 10 mA cm(-2) is only 1.55 V (vs. RHE) and the Tafel slope for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is relatively low (100 mV dec(-1)). An open circuit voltage of 1.46 V for Zn-air battery cathodes catalyzed by Co/C@NS NWs at a discharge power density of 129.3 mWcm(-2) is obtained, and the specific capacity at a discharge current density of 10 mA cm(-1) is 800 mA h g(Zn)(-1). The voltages show no obvious change for a 35 h continuous discharge/charge cycle experiment. Therefore, this work provides a new inspiration for the design and development of high-performance non-noble metal carbon-based bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000722706600001

Accurate modeling of electrochemical reaction rates including the complex environment of an electrical double layer in the presence of an applied electrical potential is challenging. We show here that calculated rates, obtained using a combination of density functional and rate theory, are in close agreement with available experimental data on the formation of the various products on several metal electrodes and over a range in applied potential, thus demonstrating the applicability of the theoretical methodology. The results explain why copper electrodes give a significant yield of hydrocarbons and alcohols, and why methane, ethylene, and ethanol are formed in electroreduction rather than methanol, which is the main product when H-2 gas reacts with CO2 on copper catalyst. The insight obtained from the calculations is used to develop criteria for identifying new and improved catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction.									141	4	0	0	7	0	143			2155-5435			WOS:000434369600050

The effects of residence time on microstructure and deposition rate of pyrolytic carbon are investigated. A short residence time is found to favor the formation of high-textured pyrolytic carbon. The evolutions of microstructure and deposition rate of pyrolytic carbon are compared with those of carbon deposited from methane. Compared to methane, ethanol exhibits a much higher deposition rate of pyrolytic carbon with similar microstructures. Pyrolysis of ethanol is modeled using a two-dimensional flow model coupled with a detailed gas-phase reaction mechanism involving 261 species taking part in 1177 reversible reactions. Reaction rate analysis reveals that C-3-hydrocarbons are the most important intermediate species contributing to the maturation of gas-phase composition. A comparison of the kinetic predictions with equilibrium calculations demonstrates that the CVD reactor applied is operated far away from equilibrium. (C) 2010 The Combustion Institute.

These unique structural attributes provide an excessive surface area with facile mass transport. In this work, we fabricate a composite NiCoO2/NiCo2O4 thin layer encapsulating the skeletons of Ni inverse opals serving as the conductive substrate, and explore their electrocatalytic activities for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline electrolyte. The NiCoO2/NiCo2O4 inverse opals are prepared by electroplating of NiCo alloy on Ni inverse opals followed by a mild oxidation treatment in air at 200 degrees C for 20 min. The X-ray diffraction patterns indicate mixed phases of crystalline NiCoO2, NiCo2O4, and NiCo, and images from scanning electron microscopy demonstrate the conformal formation of NiCoO2/NiCo2O4/NiCo on the Ni inverse opaline skeletons. Analysis from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy determines the oxidation states for surface Co and Ni ions to be both +2 and +3. Electrochemical measurements including the active surface area and OER performance reveal a large surface area and strong OER activity with a relatively flat Tafel slope of 95 mV dec(-1). In addition, from durability tests in both galvanostatic and potentiostatic modes, the sample shows impressive stability in both profiles while the inverse opaline structure is nicely maintained.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000589508300011

Biomass, an inexhaustible natural materials source, can also present good opportunities for the development of unprecedented, advanced materials and processing systems. Herein, we demonstrate the use of pine cones as a biomass mold for creating new and useful metal/carbon nanohybrids (MCNHs). The inherent water-induced folding actuation of the cone scales allows the casting of an aqueous solution of a single metal precursor or a binary metal mixture into the cone mold by simply immersing the cone in the solution. The cone actively absorbs aqueous-phase metal precursors through the bract scales and the precursor ions introduced into the cone are anchored to the functional groups of the interior tissues of the cone. Subsequent heat treatment successfully led to the formation of unique MCNHs. Iron, manganese, and cobalt were employed as model metals, binary mixtures of which were also cast into the cone mold to create further versatile MCNHs. Nanoparticulate metals were formed on the carbon supports, where the size, size distribution, and crystallinity of the nanoparticles were highly dependent on the identity of the single-component precursor and the combination of precursors. Consequently, the electrochemical activity of the MCNHs also depended on which metal precursors were cast into the cone mold. The MCNH prepared from the mixture of iron and manganese precursors (MFeMnCNH) showed the best electrochemical activity. As model applications, MFeMnCNH was applied to electrode materials for electrochemical charge storage and the oxygen evolution reaction. An electrochemical capacitor cell based on the MFeMnCNH electrodes showed excellent performance with energy densities of 38.7-54.2 W h kg(-1) at power densities of 16 000-160 kW kg(-1). In addition, MFeMnCNH demonstrated a low overpotential of 464 mV and fast kinetics with a Tafel slope of 64.6 mV dec(-1) as an electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction in 1.0 M KOH. These results substantiate that pine cones as a biomass mold show great promise for creating versatile MCNHs through further combination of various precursors.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000506883100016	31782466

Current synthetic methods for nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) are limited by poor selectivity on nitrogen bonding configurations in the NG materials. Herein, we report the chemoselective synthesis of Pyrazolic-structure-rich Nitrogen-doped Graphene (PNG) in water solutions. PNG exhibits outstanding capacitive and electrocatalytic activities. The PNG supercapacitor with acidic hydrogel electrolytes provides a specific capacitance of 226 F g(-1), an energy density of 30.3 Wh kg(-1) and great durability, outperforming most of previous carbon materials-based supercapacitors. With neutral hydrogel electrolytes, the PNG supercapacitor can be operated at higher voltages up to 1.4 V, providing an enhanced energy density of 35.8 Wh kg(-1). As an electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solutions, PNG needs a low overpotential of 394 mV to drive 20 mA cm(-2) current density and retains its activity for 16 h without any decay. The activity and durability of PNG are superior to that of noblemetal- based OER catalyst IrO2. Our results demonstrate a facile and scalable chemoselective synthesis of high-performance bifunctional NG for supercapacitors and electrocatalysis.									30	1	0	0	1	0	30			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000432884900074

Co3O4@carbon with high Co2+/Co3+ ratios derived from ZIF-67 supported on N-doped carbon nanospheres as stable bifunctional oxygen catalysts								MATERIALS TODAY ENERGY				21						100737	10.1016/j.mtener.2021.100737		APR 2021		SEP 2021	2021	Zeolite imidazole framework-67 (ZIF-67) derivatives are increasingly used for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER). Many fundamental issues concerning their structure-bifunctional activity relationships still remain unknown. Here, we use nitrogen-doped carbon nanospheres (NCS) to support ZIF-67-derived Co3O4@carbon to obtain Co3O4@Z67/NCS catalysts with the assistance of polyvinylpyrrolidone. Carbonization temperatures have great effects on the structure and active-component changes of Co3O4@Z67/NCS. Co3O4@Z67/NCS-850 (850 degrees C) with the Co2+/Co3+ ratio of 1.58 shows the promising bifunctional (ORR/OER) activity (DE = Ej=10 (1.55 V)-E1/2 (0.812 V) = 0.738 V) and long-term stability via the 4e-process in alkaline electrolytes. Co3O4@Z67/NCS-850 exhibits a comparable half wave potential of 0.812 V with a better ORR durability (an activity decline of 16.3% after 30,000 s) and methanol resistance, by comparing with commercial Pt/C (0.817 V and 29.1%). For OER, Co3O4@Z67/NCS-850 obtains a low overpotential of 0.32 V at 10 mA/cm(2) and a low charge transfer resistance of 9.69 U. The active-sites (Co2+ (ORR) and Co3+-CoOOH (OER)) on Co3O4 are well protected by carbon shell (Z67), which can hinder the fast deactivation (corrosion and agglomeration) of Co3O4 during electrocatalysis. The high porosity (387.88 m(2)/g) of Z67/NCS-850 should facilitate the mass transfer through the pores to promote the in situ electrochemical O-2 reduction/evolution on the Co and/or N active sites. These results not only find the relationships between structure/components and ORR/OER activities but also indicate a direction on promoting ZIF-derived catalysts. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Our protocol allows for simultaneous formation of exfoliated porous structure and heteroatom doping through a simple pyrolysis process. The as obtained sample is composed of graphene-like carbon layers, which are enriched with nitrogen dopants in the basal plane and phosphorus functional groups at the carbon edge. The particular structure and surface chemistry of the sample endow the materials with high catalytic properties for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). On the one hand, the opened-edge thin carbon layers form open channels for efficient mass and ion transportation; On the other hand, the heteroatom dopants and functional groups change the surface chemistry and thus the electronic structure and the surface wettability of the host materials, further enhancing the intrinsic electrochemical performance of the carbon material.

A short survey is given of the thermodynamic features shown by the reactions of the formation of superoxo and peroxo compounds corresponding to Co(II) complexes with simple and superstructured ligands. Two topics are then developed. In the first one, the connections between the structure of the ligand bonded to Co(II) and the type and the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of the dioxygen adducts formed are discussed. Open-chain and cyclic tetraazotate saturated amines with nitrogens connected by ethylenic or propylenic bridges different in number and in their order are discussed.

The integrated three-dimensional (3D) nanostructure consists of one-dimensional (1D) ZnO/TiO2 core-shell nanowire arrays and two-dimensional (2D) interconnected FeOOH nanosheets. By applying such a hierarchical nanostructure as a photoanode for photoelectrochemical water reaction, higher photostability and photocurrent density are gained compared with the reported ZnO based nanostructures. It is concluded that the giant enhancement of the properties is because, in the process of photoelectrochemical reaction, electron-hole separation and transfer are enhanced efficiently through the ZnO/TiO2 heterojunction, and in the meanwhile, terminal interconnected FeOOH nanosheets play both the roles of a surface catalyst and a protective layer effectively to accelerate water splitting reaction and enhance photostability. Based on such an environmentally friendly hierarchical nanostructure, photoelectrochemical water splitting and other similar reactions could be performed effectively and economically.									40	5	0	0	3	0	41			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000364852500044	26523803

Both O-18 isotope labeling techniques using methyl phenyl sulfoxide (PMSO) as the substrate and Xray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy provided conclusive evidences for the generation of high-valent iron-oxo species (Fe(IV)) in the Fe(II)/PI process. Density functional theory calculations determined that the reaction of Fe(II) with PI followed the formation of a hydrogen bonding complex between Fe(H2O)(6)(2+) and IO4(H2O)(-), ligand exchange, and oxygen atom transfer, consequently generating Fe(IV) species. More interestingly, the unexpected detection of O-18-labeled hydroxylated PMSO not only favored the simultaneous generation of (OH)-O-center dot but also demonstrated that (OH)-O-center dot was indirectly produced through the self-decay of Fe(IV) to form H2O2 and the subsequent Fenton reaction. In addition, IO4- was not transformed into the undesired iodine species (i.e., HOI, I-2, and I-3(-)) but was converted to nontoxic iodate (IO3-). This study proposed an efficient and environmental friendly process for the rapid removal of emerging contaminants and enriched the understandings on the evolution mechanism of (OH)-O-center dot in Fe(IV)-mediated processes.									61	0	0	0	37	0	61			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000659374200043	33706511

Crystal phase tailoring is an effective approach to optimize the energy barrier during the NRR process to improve the catalytic efficiency. Herein, a boron-doping strategy to induce phase transfer from hexagonal Mo2C to cubic Mo2C for regulating the electronic structure and catalytic properties of electrocatalysts toward NRR is reported. The B doped cubic Mo2C is found to increase the exposure of active sites, regulate the d band center of Mo for enhancing the adsorption and activation of nitrogen, and reduce the energy barrier of NRR pathway, giving rise to a high ammonia yield of 52.1 mu g h(-1) mg(-1) at -0.6 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode under ambient conditions. More importantly, the hydrogen adsorption on the surface of electrocatalyst is significantly inhibited due to the B-doping, further improving the faradic efficiency to 36.9%, which is 4 times that of hexagonal Mo2C (9%). This work not only sheds light on the atomic-scale design of efficient NRR electrocatalysts, but also provides a promising avenue for synchronizing the catalytic activity and selectivity for catalytic reactions.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000753296900001		
J	Dreybrodt, Wolfgang; Romanov, Douchko								The evolution of C-13 and O-18 isotope composition of DIC in a calcite depositing film of water with isotope exchange between the DIC and a CO2 containing atmosphere, and simultaneous evaporation of the water. Implication to climate proxies from stalagmites: A theoretical model								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				195				323	338		10.1016/j.gca.2016.07.034				DEC 15 2016	2016	The most widely applied climate proxies in speleothems are the isotope compositions of carbon and oxygen expressed by delta C-13 and delta O-18 values. However, mechanisms, which are not related to climate changes, overlay the climate signal. One is the temporal increase of both, delta C-13 and delta O-18 values by kinetic processes during precipitation of calcite. Isotope exchange between DIC in the water and the CO2 in the surrounding cave atmosphere can also change isotope composition.Here we present a theoretical model of the temporal isotope evolution of DIC in a thin water layer during precipitation of calcite and simultaneous isotope exchange with the cave atmosphere, and simultaneous evaporation of water. The exchange of oxygen isotopes in the DIC with those in the water is also considered.For drip times for T-drip < 0.2 tau, where tau is the precipitation time, we find for the change of the delta C-13 and delta O-18 values, respectively, after the time T-drip Delta(DIC) (T-drip) = ((lambda + epsilon) Ceq/C-0 -epsilon) T-drip/tau + ((delta(atm)(eq) - delta(0)) T-drip/tau(atm)(eq)) + (delta(water)(eq) - delta(0) - epsilon(w) T-drip/T-ev) T-drip/tau(water)The first term on the right hand side is the contribution from precipitation of calcite, the second stems from isotope exchange with the CO2 of the cave atmosphere, and the third results from isotope exchange between oxygen in the DIC and the oxygen in the water.lambda, epsilon are kinetic parameters, tau is the time scale of precipitation, (delta(atm)(eq) - delta(0)) and (delta(atm)(eq) - delta(0)) are the differences between the corresponding initial delta-value delta(0) and the value delta(atm,water)(eq) eq if DIC were in isotope equilibrium with the atmosphere or in the case of oxygen with the water, respectively. tau(atm)(in) in and tau(water) are the time scales of approach to isotope equilibrium by the exchange reactions. Ceq is the concentration of DIC in chemical equilibrium with the CO2 in the cave atmosphere and C-0 is the initial concentration, when the water drips to the stalagmite. T-ev is the time needed for complete evaporation of the water layer. epsilon(W) is the fractionation between water vapor and fluid water.For times T-drip > 0.2 tau we find a further increase of Delta(DIC)(T-drip) until a maximum is passed and a final value is reached. If (delta(atm)(eq) - delta(0)) and dd water (delta(water)(eq) - delta(0)) are both zero, exchange has no influence on the isotope composition for drip times T-drip < 0.2sB. For carbon it is likely that (delta(atm)(eq) - delta(0)) is about zero in summer time when most of the CO2 comes from the vadose zone (ground air), and about 12% in winter time in well ventilated caves, when most of the CO2 stems from Earth's atmosphere outside the cave.Therefore delta C-13 may be affected by isotope exchange. For the O-18 equilibrium between the DIC and the oxygen in the water as well as the oxygen in the CO2 of the atmosphere is likely in summer time. In winter time CO2 from the atmosphere outside the cave with delta of about 6% VPDB may imprint small signals. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A simplified two-step reaction mechanism, which involves a CO generation step and a CO oxidation step, was developed to better describe the chemical reaction scheme that generates/oxidizes these products within the premixed combustor. Different incomplete combustion conditions were attained by varying the MCC combustor temperature and a numerical model of the combustor was developed to simulate the species evolution. Kinetics parameters were found by minimizing the errors in fitting the simulated results with the experiments. The two-step method was employed to examine halogen- and phosphorous-containing polymers of known compositions. The halogen additives were found to decrease gas phase reaction rate, whereas the phosphorous additives do not show significant effect. In cone calorimeter fire tests, both additives inhibit combustion efficiency by promoting soot formation.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000429422800016

The O-2-releasing potential of prepared samples was evaluated at 1773 K for two-step water splitting process The partially oxygen defected CeO2-MO15 mixed oxides (M = Sc3+, Y3+ and Dy3+) exhibited an enhancement of the 02 evolution due to the crystal-chemical effect that cation with smaller ionic radius (Sc3+, Y3+ and Dy3+) mitigate the volume expansion of crystal lattice resulted in the reduction of Ce4+ with smaller ionic radius into Ce3+ with larger ionic radius. The CeO2-MO2 (M = Zr4+ and Hf4+) produced larger amount of O-2 than that for CeO2-MO15 mixed oxides, since CeO2-MO2 has no oxygen vacancy. While the ionic radii of Zr4+ and Hf4+ are almost equal, the higher O-2-releasing reactivity of Ce-0 Hf-9(0) O-1(2) than that of Ce-0 Zr-9(0) O-1(2) is explained in terms of tonicity of M-O bond Thus, it was found that both ionic radius and tonicity play important role in the O-2-releasing reaction.

The corallite-like CoP NCs are successfully prepared by a hydrothermal reaction following a phosphating treatment in N-2 atmosphere. When used as an ORR catalyst, cobalt phosphide shows comparable onset potential, inferior resistance, as well as a small Tafel slope with long-term stability in neutral media. The maximum power density of MFC embellished with 10% CoP reached 1914.4 +/- 59.7 mW m(-2), which is 108.5% higher than the control. The four-electron pathway, observed by the RDE, plays a crucial role in electrochemical catalytic activity. In addition, material characterizations indicate that the surface oxide layer (CoOx) around the metallic CoP core is important and beneficial for ORR. Accordingly, it can be expected that the as-synthesized CoP will be a promising candidate of the non-precious metal ORR electrocatalysts for electrochemical energy applications.

In this study, we investigated the effects of propane addition and oxygen enrichment on the flame characteristics of biogas with a constant heating value in a half-open duct. The evolution of the flame structure revealed that the tulip structure took on two types of patterns at the oxygen fraction theta = 0.21. However, there was no salient tulip flame formation when theta > 0.21. Oxygen enrichment significantly increased the flame propagation velocity (V) and explosion pressure (P). Propane addition significantly reduced V(max )at theta = 0.25 and 0.29. The maximum rate of pressure rise [(dP/dt)(max)] exhibited a nonlinear dependence on the maximum flame velocity (V-max). A similar trend was observed for the dependence of (dP/dt)(max) on the laminar burning velocity (LBV). Therefore, the LBV is an important parameter to predict V-max and (dP/dt)(max) values of mixtures. Furthermore, by using the PREMIX code and the UC San Diego mechanism, we simulated laminar flame burning properties to reveal the macroscopic flame propagation characteristics. The rate of propane consumption was higher than the rate of methane consumption. Additionally, oxygen enrichment played an important role in the entire reaction process, leading to an increase in the molar concentrations of microscopic free radicals and a promotion of the rates of production (ROP) of free radicals. In contrast, the addition of propane decreased the molar concentrations of microscopic free radicals and inhibited the ROP of free radicals.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000631407400030

The sophisticated structural design facilitates the development of related disciplines such as water splitting devices. Here, a kind of Agcore- Pt atoms-exposedshell structure could be synthesized through ligand exchange between Ag nanoparticles and Pt polysulfide precursor at room temperature (RT). The Ag core maintains its face-centered cubic phase (FCC) crystal phase after the formation of Agcore- Pt atoms-exposedshell structure. While Pt atoms account for only 0.4617 percent of the catalyst mass. With a further electrochemical reduction of Pt (IV) atoms into metallic state Pt (0) atoms from -1.2 V vs. RHE to 0.4 V vs. RHE, the HER catalytic performance of Agcore- Pt atoms-exposedshell would exceed that of commercial 20% Pt/C at low potentials (< -0.487 V vs. RHE). Furthermore, we found the HER performance is stable, which verifies that the Pt polysulfide is tightly bound to the surface of Ag. Specifically, the present approach shows great potential for the construction of nanostructure with high atomic utilization.					2022 International Conference on Energy Utilization and Automation (ICEUA 2022)2022 International Conference on Energy Utilization and Automation (ICEUA 2022)	25-27 Feb. 202225-27 Feb. 2022		Guangzhou, ChinaGuangzhou, China	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1742-6596			INSPEC:22086860

Here, for the first time, we report a novel three-dimensional iron-doped nickel phosphate catalyst by stepwise autologous hydrothermal growth of nickel phosphate (Ni:Pi) spontaneously from nickel foam (NF) followed by electrodeposition of iron hydroxide (denoted as Ni:Pi-Fe/NF). Our findings reveal that the incorporated iron could play strong synergistic effects on the OER activities of nickel phosphate in alkaline solution, delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an extremely small overpotential (eta) of 220 mV and extraordinary high current density of 500 mA cm(-2) at eta = 290 mV in 1 M KOH, which is among the best Ni-based OER electrocatalysts to date. Furthermore, in a concentrated alkaline electrolyte (5 M KOH), the Ni:Pi-Fe/NF electrode can reach a high current density of 1 600 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential merely of 332 mV and shows excellent electrocatalytic stability in prolonged bulk water electrolysis, meaning it could highly meet the requirement of the industry alkaline electrolysis system. Mechanism investigations employing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electrochemical polarization, contact angle measurement, and Raman spectra suggest strong interactions between Ni:Pi and Fe, with nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) being the primary catalytic active site and nickel phosphate facilitating water adsorption.

Water is formed by hydrogenation of oxygen species adsorbed on the surface of dust grains, while carbon monoxide is formed by reactions between ionized carbon and hydroxyl species in the gas phase. It is the second most abundant molecule in the gas phase after molecular hydrogen. The formation of carbon dioxide, however, cannot proceed in the gas phase as the addition of an oxygen to carbon monoxide is so exothermic that the new-formed molecule quickly breaks a C-O bond without a third body to transfer the excess energy to. It is commonly accepted that carbon dioxide is formed by energetic processing of carbon monoxide and water on grain surfaces. The exact mechanism of the oxidation of carbon monoxide and the intermediates formed in the process, however, are under some dispute. The role of the HOCO(center dot)radical in the oxidation of carbon monoxide is especially contested, as theory predicts it should not be able to dissociate the H-O bond to yield carbon dioxide, but it is experimentally observed in some studies of the reaction. The author presents here a short overview of established and recent experimental results in an attempt to reconcile seemingly contradictory results and give a comprehensive and consistent picture of the radiation induced reactions between carbon monoxide and water on grain surfaces.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2296-987X			WOS:000552669900001

The assay is initiated by injection of the component protein(s) of the enzyme or MgATP and terminated by injection of either acid or a solution of Na(2)EDTA. The various nitrogenases catalyze the reduction of a wide variety of substrates. This chapter outlines the methods used to analyze the products of nitrogenase-catalyzed reactions involving nitrogen-nitrogen bonds, nitrogen-oxygen bonds, carbon-nitrogen bonds, carbon-carbon bonds, carbon-oxygen bonds, carbon-sulfur bonds, and hydrogen only. The usefulness of measurements of residual amounts of other components of nitrogenase assays is also discussed.									13	0	0	0	8	0	13				1940-6029		MEDLINE:21833864	21833864

The evolution of the SEI layer containing these Mn compounds and the corresponding instability of the layer are thoroughly investigated by artificially introducing soluble Mn ions into a 1 mol L-1 LiPF6 electrolyte solution. Deposition of dissolved Mn ions induces an oxygen-rich SEI layer that results from increased electrolyte decomposition, accelerating SE! growth. The spatial distribution of Mn shows that dissolved Mn ions diffuse through the porous layer and are deposited mostly at the inorganic layer/graphite interface. The Mn compound deposited on the anode, identified as MnF2, originates from a metathesis reaction between LiF and dissolved Mn ion. It is confirmed that ion-exchange reaction occurs in the inorganic layer, converting SEI species to Mn compounds. Some of the Mn is observed inside the graphite; this may cause surface structural disordering in the graphite, limiting lithium-ion intercalation. The continuous reaction that occurs at the inorganic layer/graphite interfacial regions and the modification of the original SEI layer in the presence of Mn ions are critically related to capacity fade and impedance rise currently plaguing Li-ion cells.

Electrocatalysis by hangman porphyrins has examined only one face modification of the macrocycle with a hanging group, thus allowing for circumvention of secondary sphere effects by reaction of the small molecule on the opposite face of the hangman cleft. We now report the synthesis and characterization of a double hangman Fe porphyrin in which both faces of the macrocycle are modified with a hanging group. With this double hangman architecture, we are able to unequivocally examine the role of electrostatic interactions on the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) and show that CO2RR rates are significantly attenuated, consistent with the initial reduction of CO2 to generate the anion, whose binding is diminished within the negatively charged carboxylic groups of the hangman cleft. The results demonstrate the pronounced role that nonbonding electrostatic interactions may play in CO2RR and highlight the need to manage deleterious electrostatic interactions during catalytic turnover.									26	1	0	0	1	0	26			1948-7185			WOS:000518706000041	32022566

Herein, our combined experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the electrocatalytic and photoelectrochemical activity of WO3 changes non-monotonically with the Mn orV doping concentration due to local changes in the reduced nature of WO3 and the formation of oxygen vacancies. For the hydrogen evolution reaction, at optimal Mn and V doping concentrations, the overpotential to reach similar to 10 mA cm(-2) is reduced by -97 mV and -38 mV vs. RHE; the Tafel slope is also reduced from 121 to 68 and 41 mV per decade (mV dec(-1)) compared to the undoped WO3, respectively. The improved activity arises from the fine tuning of the electronic structure and lessened free energy for atomic hydrogen adsorption. For photoelectrochemical water splitting, the photocurrent density is increased from 0.61 mA cm(-2) for the undoped WO3 to similar to 1.38 mA cm(-2) and 2.49 mA cm(-2) for optimal Mn and V doping, respectively. The photocurrent density at an optimal V doping is approximately 1.8 and 4.1 times higher than that at the optimal Mn doping and undoped WO3, respectively. Our work indicates a promising interface-engineering strategy for designing highly active non-precious electrocatalysts and photocatalysts for green energy conversion applications.									40	2	0	0	2	0	40			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463970400025

The excellent performance and dynamic behavior for storing electrical energy in hydrogen allow polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolysis to cover the gap between the intermittent renewable power production and the grid demand at different time horizons and scales. This work is addressed to the development and characterization of high performance nanostructured Ir-Ru-oxide electro-catalyst achieving for the rate determining oxygen evolution reaction a current density of 3 A cm(-2) at about 1.8 V (> 80% enthalpy efficiency) with a low catalyst loading (0.34 mg cm(-2)). The stability characteristics were studied in practical PEM electrolysis cells operating at 80 degrees C, using several durability tests of 1000 h each to evaluate the reliability of this electro-catalyst for real-life operation. Further insights on the degradation mechanism were acquired by subjecting the catalyst to potential steps in a specially designed electrochemical flow cell under corrosive liquid electrolyte with on-line monitoring of the dissolved ions. Structural, morphology, composition and surface analysis of the anode electro-catalyst after operation in the electrolysis cell, complemented by in-situ electrochemical diagnostics, provided important insights into the degradation mechanisms. Catalyst operation at high turnover frequency (TOF) was observed to cause a progressive change of Lewis acidity characteristics with time for both Ir and Ru cations thus influencing their ability to promote water oxidation.									68	1	0	0	1	0	70			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000411687800068

However, the development of efficient and stable electrocatalysts with superior activity for the electrochemical N-2 reduction reaction (NRR) remains a great challenge. In this work, a composite of MoS2 nanodots highly dispersed on reduced graphene oxide (MoS2 NDs/RGO) is prepared as an effective catalyst for electrochemical N-2 fixation. Benefiting from the homogeneous dispersion of the MoS2 NDs on RGO and the strong C-S-C bridging bonds between them, this composite can provide abundant active sites and boost the electron transfer in the reaction. As a result, the MoS2 NDs/RGO hybrid achieves a remarkable faradaic efficiency of 27.93% and NH3 yield rate of 16.41 mu g h(-1) mg(cat.)(-1) at ambient conditions, which is much better than the NRR performance achieved by MoS2 nanosheets on reduced graphene oxide (MoS2 NS/RGO). Additionally, the catalyst shows high electrochemical selectivity and stability.									29	2	0	0	2	0	30			2168-0485			WOS:000513089500022

Direct observation of adsorption evolution and bonding configuration of TMAA on TiO2(110)								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				111	11			4342	4346		10.1021/jp067264d				MAR 22 2007	2007	Trimethylacetic acid (TMAA) adsorption evolution on the rutile TiO2(110) surface from submonolayer to saturation coverages was examined at the atomic level by scanning tunneling microscopy using the same area analysis approach. Upon TMAA deprotonation, no evidence of terminal OH group formation has been found. It has been suggested that uncommon geometry associated with detached hydrogen atom takes place instead, with proton bonding to pair bridging oxygen atoms. Such a configuration is likely to be stabilized by adjacent adsorbed TMA groups and, in turn, be a factor in the formation of TMA (2 x 1) reconstruction at saturation coverage. It also shown that the surface defects do not have a major impact on TMAA adsorption.									36	0	0	0	1	0	36			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000245006200039

The size dependence of light emission is well exhibited when the Si sublayer thickness is thinner than 4 nm and the interface states are well passivated by hydrogen. But for the oxygen terminated Si/SiO2 multilayer structures, the oxygen modified interface states play predominant role in the properties of light emission. The evolution of the light emission properties affected by interface states was step-by-step discovered. The role of hydrogen and oxygen is discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

However, current research on NOER catalysts mainly focus on noble metals and single atom catalysts, while low-cost transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are rarely considered, let alone their product selectivity. Herein, using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the performance of a series of single-layer TMDs (MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, TaTe2 and WTe2) in the 1T' phase as electrocatalysts for NOER. Our results reveal that defective 1T'-MoS2 and 1T'-MoSe2 monolayers (with the most common sulphur and selenium vacancies, respectively) exhibit excellent activity for NOER as well as high selectivity for ammonia, which can be correspondingly yielded at 0 and -0.06 V potentials, comparable to the best Pt-based and single atom catalysts. Furthermore, these two catalysts efficiently suppress the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Thus, single-layer TMDs synthesized with chalcogen vacancies may serve as efficient catalysts for electrochemical ammonia synthesis from pollutants and electrocatalytic denitrification.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2196-0216			WOS:000690902400018

Herein, Co3Fe7 alloy nanoparticles wrapped in N-doped defect-rich carbon nanosheets (Co3Fe7/CNs) were synthesized at 800 degrees C by a one-step pyrolysis of the mixture (dicyandiamide, iron (II) phthalocyanine (FePc), cobalt (II) phthalocyanine (CoPc) and Fe2O3), defined as Co3Fe7/CNs-800 for simplicity. The pyrolysis temperature and the dosages of dicyandiamide closely correlated to the ORR performance of the resultant catalysts in 0.1 M KOH solution. Significantly, the optimized Co3Fe7/CNs-800 exhibited encouraging onset potential (E-onset = 0.97 V) and half-wave potential (E-1/2 = 0.85 V) in the alkaline media, surpassing commercial Pt/C (50 wt%, E-onset = 0.96 V, E-1/2 = 0.84 V). This work provides a feasible strategy for developing efficient non-noble metal ORR electrocatalysts in the alkaline condition. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

A series of NiO/N-TiO2 samples were prepared via NH3-postnitridation of nickel oxide-modified TiO2. H-2 production from ethanol/water solution was utilized as a model reaction to evaluate the photocatalytic properties of the catalysts. Compared to N-TiO2, a 90-fold-enhanced H-2 evolution rate was achieved over the optimal NiO/ N-TiO2 catalyst with a 0.5 wt% Ni content. Detailed characterizations clearly showed that loading NiO via wet impregnation leads to high dispersion of Ni2+ species on the surface oxygen vacancy (Vo) sites of the anatase TiO2 nanoparticles, predominantly presenting mononuclear Ti-O-Ni heteroatomic clusters on the surface of TiO2 in the case of low Ni content. These surface heteroatomic clusters can speed up the transfer and separation of photogenerated carriers of N-TiO2. It can thus be established that the molecular Ti-O-Ni heterojunctions are the main contributors to the synergistic enhancement of H-2 evolution, whereas NiO nanoclusters are not responsible for the photoactivity. Only one of the N species, N-Ti-Vo, was active and effective for this cooperation with the hydrogen-releasing Ni sites, which can induce ca. 20-fold improvement of hydrogen production over NiO/TiO2 under visible light irradiation.									23	0	0	0	2	0	23			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000401907700009

Metalloid B doping into the interstices of a PGM lattice is an alternative tuning knob and has attracted growing interest in effectively upgrading the reactivity, selectivity, and durability of surface PGM sites toward a multitude of electrocatalytic reactions, since the report on Pd-B-catalyzed formic acid electrooxidation in 2009. In this Perspective, we present an in-depth overview on the advances of B-doped PGMs for different electrocatalytic application scenarios with an emphasis on the structure-reactivity relationship, showing how binding strengths of key intermediates can be properly tuned with the B-doping level on reactive surfaces. Insights from advanced structural characterizations, operando spectroelectrochemistry, and theoretical simulations on the B-doping effect are provided, with our viewpoints on the future research and development of efficient B-doped PGMs in electrocatalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000866237900001

ABO(3)(-delta) perovskites, with rich constitutions and structures, have never been designed via activity descriptors for critical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we apply coordination rationales to introduce A-site ionic electronegativity (AIE) as an efficient unifying descriptor to predict the HER activities of 13 cobalt-based perovskites. Compared with A-site structural or thermodynamic parameter, AIE endows the HER activity with the best volcano trend. (Gd0.5La0.5)BaCo2O5.5+delta predicted from an AIE value of similar to 2.33 exceeds the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst in electrode activity and stability. X-ray absorption and computational studies reveal that the peak HER activities at a moderate AIE value of similar to 2.33 can be associated with the optimal electronic states of active B-sites via inductive effect in perovskite structure (similar to 200 nm depth), including Co valence, Co-O bond covalency, band gap and O 2p-band position.									77	5	0	0	3	0	78			2041-1723			WOS:000482004000007	31434892

In this study, nitrogen-doped molybdenum selenide/biomass-derived carbon (N-MoSe2/BC) composite as a Pt-support/co-catalyst is prepared via a synchronous synthesis method to enhance methanol tolerance. The porous structure of N-MoSe2/BC with N-doping can improve the exposure of coordinated Mo-Se-x sites along MoSe2 edges and provide the oxygen diffusion channels to promote ORR activity. Pt-N-MoSe2/BC (Pt, 5 wt.%) shows high activity (14.83 mA cm(-2)) and selectivity (4e(-) pathway) towards ORR, promising durability (11.9% decline) and excellent tolerance against methanol-crossover effects, which are superior to those of commercial Pt/C (10 wt.%). With the introduction of pyridinic N, graphitic N and Mo-N-x in MoSe2/BC, more active sites on Pt (111) facets are activated to enhance charge transfer efficiency and ORR activity. Both N-species in BC and exposed edge sites in N-MoSe2 contribute to high methanol-tolerance and co-catalytic activity towards ORR. Therefore, the remarkable ORR activity is originated from the synergistic effects among well-distributed Pt, N-species, and active edge sites of MoSe2. Design of porous (N)-MoSe2/BC provides a promising direction for preparation of co-catalyst/support with strong methanol tolerance and ORR activity. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The FeCo/NB-Cs display ultrahigh specific surface area (SSA) of 1584 m(2) g(-1) and total pore volume (TPV) of 1.21 cm(3) g(-1), higher than most of currently reported M-N-C catalysts. Delightfully, FeCo/NB-Cs also exhibit obvious mesoporous properties via easy tailoring of H3BO3 dopant. Without doubt, FeCo/NB-Cs exhibit remarkable ORR/OER catalytic activity (total overpotential, Delta E=0.653 V), exceeding most of reported heterogeneous-doped carbon materials. Meanwhile, the FeCo/NB-Cs based zinc-air batteries display high power density and perfect charge-discharge stability. More significantly, theoretical calculation reveals that greatly enhanced catalytic activity of FeCo/NB-Cs originates from higher HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbitals) energy, higher DOS (density of states) and weakened O-2 adsorption strength owing to synergetic contribution of Fe/Co and N/B dopants. Consequently, this work not only provides a facile but advanced avenue to rationally design heterogenous-doped carbon nanosheets with high SSA and large TPV but also reveals the insight understanding for synergetic contribution of different active species.									52	4	0	0	6	0	53			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000467042200047

It is shown that the thermal degradation process can be divided into three stages, and a significant difference between thermal and thermo-oxidative degradation is the third stage in which the residual chars are further cracked for the thermo-oxidative degradation. The activation energy was calculated using the iso-conversional Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) method. The lower activation energy for thermo-oxidative degradation indicated that oxygen had an accelerated effect on thermal degradation. The variation of activation energy indicated that the decomposition of all the samples was a complex process that included at least two different mechanisms. Evolution of the evolved gaseous products with temperature was studied to understand the thermal and thermooxidative decomposition comprehensively. According to the TG-FTIR analysis, the gaseous products mainly contained lactide, cyclic oligomers, aldehydes, CO2, CO, and H2O. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The role of CCCP in enhancing photobiological H-2 production was delineated. CCCP as an ADRY agent (agent accelerating the deactivation reactions of water-splitting enzyme system Y) rapidly inhibited the photosystem H (PSII) activity of P. subcordiformis cells, resulting in a markedly decline in the coupled oxygen evolution. The mitochondrial oxidative respiration was only slightly inactivated by CCCP, which depleted O-2 in the light. As a result, anaerobiosis during the stage of photobiological H-2 evolution was established, preventing severe O-2 inactivation of the reversible hydrogenase in P. subcordiformis. The uncoupling effect of CCCP accelerates electron transfer from water due to a disruption of the proton motive force and release of Delta pH across the thylakoid membrane and thus enhances the accessibility of electron and H+ to hydrogenase. The electrons for hydrogen photoevolution are mainly from the photolysis of water (90%). Upon the addition of CCCP, Chl a/b ratio increased, which implies a decrease in the light-harvesting PSII antennae or an increase in PSII/PSI ratio, possibly resulting in higher efficiency of utilization of light energy. The enhancement of H-2 evolution by the addition of CCCP is mostly due to the combination of the above three mechanisms. However, the disruption of the proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane may prevent a sustained photobiological H-2 evolution due to a shortfall of ATP generation essential for the maintenance and repair functions of the cells.									39	7	0	0	16	0	45			8756-7938	1520-6033		WOS:000236783400015	16599559

The surface temperature of the particles was estimated to increase at a rate of about 10(6)K/s. For a bituminous coal, observation with high-speed video revealed that the coal particles ignited heterogeneously 1-2ms after the laser pulse operation and this was followed by the evolution of volatile materials and their combustion in the gas phase. A rate constant of surface oxidation reaction of the bituminous coal at a temperature range between 800K and 1400K was calculated by an analysis of the ignition temperatures of the particles. The reaction order for oxygen partial pressure was 1.0 and the activation energy was 50KJ/mol, which coincide with published values determined by heterogeneous reaction theory. Ignition temperature varied several hundred degrees for the same coal and experimental conditions due to the difference of chemical characteristics of particles. This corresponded to a three-times variation in the frequency factors.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0386-216X			WOS:A1994PY41400013

Within a few million years of the birth of the Solar System, chondrule formation and the accretion of the parent bodies of differentiated achondrites and the terrestrial planets took place in the inner protoplanetary disk(1,2). Here we show that, for chondrules in unequilibrated enstatite chondrites, high-precision Delta O-17 values (where Delta O-17 is the deviation of the delta O-17 value from a terrestrial silicate fractionation line) vary significantly (ranging from -0.49 to + 0.84%) and fall on an array with a steep slope of 1.27 on a three-oxygen-isotope plot. This array can be explained by the reaction between an olivine-rich chondrule melt and an SiO-rich gas derived from vaporized dust and nebular gas. Our study suggests that a large proportion of the building blocks of planetary embryos formed by successive silicate-gas interaction processes: silicate- H2O followed by silicate-SiO interactions under more oxidized and reduced conditions, respectively, within a few million years of the formation of the Solar System.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2397-3366			WOS:000406542300002

Efficiency of water dissociation to time-resolved hydrogen and oxygen pulses, through non-equilibrium processes on catalyst surfaces								Hydrogen as an Energy Vector. Proceedings of the International Seminar								34	45						1980	1980	Pulsed methods under investigation for their capabilities of splitting water under non-equilibrium conditions into separated pulses of hydrogen and oxygen include pulsed electrocatalytic and pulsed photocatalytic techniques, which utilise dynamic mass spectrometry (DMS) to compare and fully describe the kinetics and separation-in-time achievable between H2 and O2 product pulses in non-equilibrium conditions. Successful photocatalytic applications of the DMS technique are described, including differing time profiles for evolution of hydrogen pulses and carbon monoxide from flash-illuminated surfaces of ruthenium-doped TiO2 catalyst over which low pressures of H218O plus CO16O2 were passed. Higher quantum efficiencies-based on molecules of hydrogen observed per photon adsorbed-were observed at the H2O+CO2/Ru-TiO2 interface than at H2O/Ru-TiO2 interfaces.

Herein, a simple strategy was designed to build a MoS2/Co9S8/MoC@CNT-N (MCM@CNT-N) heterostructure with a large number of interfaces. Regarding the HER, the synthesized MCM@CNT-N heterostructure catalyst showed high efficiency and stable electrocatalytic performance, with a low overpotential of 174.2 mV and a small Tafel slope of 84.7 mV dec(-1) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4. In addition to the function of heterojunctions, the excellent activity is also attributed to the introduction of Co and N atoms and the formation of carbon nanotubes. This work provides a new approach to build efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts for electrochemical reactions.

However, the nature of Li+/Ni2+ disorder on the structure and property is still poorly understood. Herein, we design and synthesize layered LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode materials with a different Li+/Ni2+ mixing degree, and focus on unveiling the influence mechanism of Li+/Ni2+ disorder on the surface/bulk structural evolution and the charge compensation mechanism by neutron, synchrotron radiation and electrochemical impedance techniques. High Li+/Ni2+ disorder increases the side reactions between electrolyte and electrode surface and aggravates the variation of local environment of Mn cations with (de)lithiating, which is largely responsible for the degradation of the initial capacity, rate capability and cycling performance. Interestingly, Li+/Ni2+ disorder can also relieve the electrostatic interaction between the cationic and anionic ions by enlarging the LiO6 octahedron and TMO6 octahedron, and locks the surrounding oxygen slabs by forming strong covalent bonds between antisite Ni and coordinated O ions, which alleviates the variations of the lattice parameters during charging/discharging. This study presents some new insights into designing high performance layered oxide cathodes through regulating Li+/Ni2+ disorder.

The libraries included a ternary metal cation system based on CuWO4 with one out of eight transition or posttransition metal ions Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, Bi, and Ga in different overall atomic ratios. The photocatalyst libraries were screened by scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy for the highest anodic photocurrents. Array elements that showed promising performance were printed in another set of eight libraries with smaller increments of overall composition. Improved performance with respect to CuWO4 was found for Ga, Co, and Ni as the third element. A comparison of the most active composition of those arrays within one library showed the highest activity for Cu48Ga3W49Ox. Printing spots of identical composition (Cu48Ga3W49Ox, Cu44Ni9W47Ox, and Cu44Co9W47Ox) over a larger area facilitated further characterization by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, chopped light voltammetry, and scanning electrochemical microscopy for the OER. High and stable steady-state photocurrents were generated in a photoelectrochemical cell for all three electrodes even at a low constant bias voltage. The best overall photoanode composition Cu48Ga3W49Ox showed currents that were 36 times higher than the currents of the binary Cu50W50Ox system. Significant n-doping was found by UPS valence band spectra for Ga-containing materials.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000757989700001	35076196

Herein, we prepared a symmetric tri-layer structure of "porous YSZ-LSCrF divide dense YSZ divide porous YSZ-LSCrF" by the tape casting and lamination techniques. Porous scaffolds of 80 wt% LSCrF - 20 wt% YSZ showed good conductivities and reasonably high performance for direct CO2 electrolysis with a current density of 0.84 Acm(-2) at 850 degrees C. Infiltrating Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-delta (SDC) catalysts into both porous scaffolds enhanced their catalytic activities for CO2 reduction and oxygen evolution reactions, yielding an increased electrolysis current density of 1.3 Acm(-2) at 850 degrees C and 1.5 V. Impedance measurements showed a pronounced decrease in the total interfacial polarization resistance at 1.5 V, i.e., 0.34 vs 0.66 omega cm(2). In addition, these symmetric cells exhibited good short-term stability at various voltages from 1.0 to 1.6 V.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000618348100001

High-surface-area porous carbon was treated with HNO3 to produce an anode material with carbonyl and phenol groups on the surface, thereby providing redox sites for hydrogen storage and release. The HNO3-activated carbon anodes were characterized with respect to use in a RFCB operated from room temperature to 75 degrees C with a voltage range of 0-2.0 V. The quantity of carbonyl groups and the corresponding reduced phenol groups increased with the O/C atomic ratio of the oxygenated carbon, by which the electrical capacity was increased to reach a maximum of 125 mAh g(-1) at an O/C atomic ratio of 0.114. The optimal temperature and charge voltage for performance and cyclability were determined to be 50 degrees C and 1.25 V, respectively. The charge and discharge times remained at ca. 93% of the respective initial values after 300 cycles. The RFCB with the modified porous carbon anode provided energy densities of 2.5-13.8 Wh kg(-1) and power densities of 46.4-296.3 W kg(-1) (normalized according to the mass of the entire cell).

However, its chemical stability is extremely low for utilization in applications associated with photoelectrochemical water splitting. TiO2 is known to exhibit an excellent chemical stability; however, it has a poor electrical conductivity and a wide band gap. In this study, we fabricated a heterogeneous Z-scheme photoanode by combining TiO2 and GaAs; this photoanode demonstrated a high chemical stability and a high visible light absorption capability. Herein, we propose an effective strategy for achieving nitrogen doping in TiO2 (N-TiO2) to form oxygen vacancies and TiN, which increase the electrical conductivity and reduce the overpotential of the photoanode. The TiN/N-TiO2/ITO/GaAs photoanode thus obtained significantly improved the electrochemical performances of the oxygen evolution reaction, as compared to those obtained with the undoped TiO2/ITO/GaAs photoanode. Further, the Tafel slope was observed to decrease from 315.4 mV/dec to 64.1 mV/dec and the open circuit potential shifted from 0.2 V to -0.2 V vs RHE. In addition, photoelectrochemical stability was significantly improved as compared to that obtained by bare GaAs. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, Fe-treated heteroatoms (N, P, and S)-doped porous carbons are synthesized for the first time by pyrolysis of bio-char derived from abundant human urine waste as a single precursor for carbon and heteroatoms, using iron(III) acetylacetonate as an external Fe precursor, followed by acid leaching and activation with a second pyrolysis step in NH3. In particular, the sample prepared at a pyrolysis temperature of 800 degrees C (FeP-NSC-800) contains iron phosphide (FeP, Fe2P) in the high-porosity heteroatoms-doped carbon framework along with Fe traces, and exhibits excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes as demonstrated in half- and single-cell tests. Such excellent ORR catalytic performance is ascribed to a synergistic effect of not only multiple active Fe-P, Fe-N, and pyridinic and graphitic N species in the electrocatalyst but also facile transport channels provided by its hierarchical porous structure with micro-/mesopores. In addition, the sample exhibits high long-term durability and methanol crossover resistance.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			2196-0216			WOS:000438339200026

The Q(3) shielding anisotropy decreases with increasing Cs content-interpreted as an increase in the non-bridging oxygen (NBO) bond length from increasing Cs coordination (clustering) around the NBO. The Si-29 2D MAF spectra for four glass compositions x = 0.218, 0.234, 0.263, 0.298 exhibit a second co-existing and distinctly smaller shielding anisotropy corresponding to a significantly longer Si-NBO length arising from a higher degree of Cs clustering around the NBO. This second Q(3) site appears at a Cs2O mole fraction close to the critical mole fraction of x = 0.24 associated with the percolation threshold of non-bridging oxygen in random close packing of oxygen, thus suggesting that the longer Si-NBO length is associated with an infinite size spanning cluster while the sites with larger anisotropies are associated with shorter Si-NBO lengths and belong to finite size clusters. The equilibrium constant of the Q(3) disproportionation reaction was determined as k(3) = 0.005, indicating a Q(n) anionic species distribution close to a binary model as expected for a low field strength modifier such as cesium. It is also found that evolution of the isotropic Q(4) and line shapes with increasing Cs content are consistent with a random connectivity model between Q(n) of differing number of bridging oxygen, n.

J	Huang, Guosheng; Zhuang, Yaowei; Fu, Wei								Physical and Electrochemical Performances of Cold Sprayed Pb Electrodes								COATINGS				9	3					174	10.3390/coatings9030174				MAR 6 2019	2019	Titanium-based PbO2 electrodes are widely used for chemical industries, such as electrodialysis, electrolysis, and electrodepositing, to improve the mechanical and life cycle properties of Pb metal electrodes. However, PbO2 electrodes are usually electrodeposited onto rigid metals due to its soft characteristic, which results in severe passivation problems requiring thin thickness and high porosity. It is of great importance to develop a rigid Pb metal electrode system since thermal spraying and welding methods fail to manufacture such a promising electrode. In the present work, the cold spraying method was used to deposit a pure Pb metal coating with thickness of above 500 mu m on Q235 steel substrate. The coating has good physical performances, the porosity is less than 1%, and the bonding strength ranges from 6.25 to 7.75 MPa. The cross-sectional morphology suggests that no through-thickness pores exist in the coating. The oxygen evolution potential is larger than 1.5 V vs. SCE, which is similar to the potential of the titanium-based PbO2 electrode. Dynamic polarization curves and cyclic voltammetry curves of coated sample in sodium sulfate solution indicate that cold sprayed Pb coating is a good electrode for electrochemical reduction reactions. All our results mean that cold spraying is capable of manufacturing electrode materials for electrochemical industries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2079-6412			WOS:000464282000003

A Cr(III) doped NiCo2O4 material has been grown hydrothermally on an open Ni-mesh. Palladium nanoparticles have been synthesized by pulsed lased ablation in liquid acetone in the fs regime and deposited by drop casting onto the surface of the nanostructured mixed oxide electrodes. The resulting electrodes have been calcined at 300 degrees C. The use of laser techniques to produce nanoparticles for aLOBs is here proposed for the first time in the literature, as well as the peculiar combination of Pd/PdO nanoparticles deposited onto C-free Cr(III) doped NiCo2O4 self-standing electrodes. Performance in aprotic Li-O-2 batteries have been recorded in galvanostatic conditions and post mortem analysis of the electrode surfaces have been carried out by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy. The use of Pd/PdO nanoparticles as co-catalysts enhances the reversibility of the electrochemical oxygen reduction/evolution reactions. This beneficial effect originates by the decrease of the mean overvoltages compared to the bare Cr(III) doped NiCo2O4 electrodes, and extends the cell calendar life from 16 to 41 fully reversible galvanostatic cycles at J = 0.2 mAcm (2) with capacity limitation of 0.2 mAhcm (2).

The present work reports the development and application of a new hybrid catalyst derived from the thermal treatment of a mixture of graphene nanoribbons (GNR) and nickel pyrophosphate (beta-Ni2P2O7); the proposed hybrid material was found to present remarkably improved properties which include easy charge transfer, high electroactive surface area, high activity, and effective resistance to corrosion in OER in alkaline medium. The combination of highly dispersed beta-Ni2P2O7-30 wt% in direct contact with GNR-70 wt%, coupled with the application of thermal treatment - which ensured some enrichment of Ni in the GNiPy350N catalyst, contributed toward the production of an efficient material with excellent and stable OER activity in alkaline conditions. Compared to the state-of-the-art IrO2 (300 mV), the GNiPy350N catalyst required an overpotential of approximately 320 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) when immobilized on carbon paper electrode.									12	2	0	0	0	0	12			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000643946900001

Despite recent progress on the structure of the natural catalytic site, and on inorganic catalyst function, determining the mechanistic details of this multiredox reaction remains a significant challenge. We report herein a rate law analysis of the order of water oxidation as a function of surface hole density on a hematite photoanode employing photoinduced absorption spectroscopy. Our study reveals a transition from a slow, first order reaction at low accumulated hole density to a faster, third order mechanism once the surface hole density is sufficient to enable the oxidation of nearest neighbor metal atoms. This study thus provides direct evidence for the multihole catalysis of water oxidation by hematite, and demonstrates the hole accumulation level required to achieve this, leading to key insights both for reaction mechanism and strategies to enhance function.									203	5	0	0	26	0	204			0002-7863			WOS:000355383500035	25936408

USE - The chemical method is used for thin-film coating of nickel cobalt phosphate on a solid substrate. The method is useful for chemical-film coating of nickel cobalt phosphate on a solid substrate, where the substrate is used for energy storage devices and electrocatalytic water splitting. ADVANTAGE - The method enables to form nickel cobalt phosphate thin film on conducting substrate, which has excellent protonic conductivity, phosphate groups permit charge to diffuse over an interlamellar section and manipulate the active site electron density in the catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The method is cost-effective, simple, and less investigated method and it can be used to synthesize large-area deposition in less time on any type of substrate. In the SILAR method, using different parameters such as number of immersion cycles, immersion time and solution concentration one can easily control the growth rate of the thin film. To avoid material loss through precipitation, a four-beaker successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) system is used to make layer-by-layer deposition of binary compounds, which is relatively based on sequential adsorption and reaction on the surface of the substrate. The nickel-cobalt phosphate coating on stainless steel substrate surface shows supercapacitive and electrocatalysis properties.															0						DIIDW:202293777M

In this work, we report Se-Ni(OH)(2)-shelled vertically oriented NiSe nanowires on a Ni foam as an electrocatalyst toward UOR, showing a low potential of 0.366 V vs. SCE to drive 100 mA cm (2) in alkaline solution and out-performing all the reported non-noble-metal UOR catalysts up to date. Experimental results and theoretical calculation reveal that the vertically and distantly arranged nanowires with highly porous structure produce high mass transport paths for urea to fully access the reaction sites, the NiSe core offers high conductivity for fast electron transport, and the Se-Ni(OH)(2) shell provides large amount of active catalytic sites while lowering the CO2 adsorption/desorption barrier than Ni(OH) 2 for fast reaction kinetics. This work opens up an exciting new direction to design electrocatalysts for high performance fuel cells and other energy applications.

J	Zheng, Jie; Yan, Yushan; Xu, Bingjun				Yan, Yushan/Y-2847-2019				Correcting the Hydrogen Diffusion Limitation in Rotating Disk Electrode Measurements of Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Kinetics								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				162	14			F1470	F1481		10.1149/2.0501514jes				2015	2015	Rotating disk electrode (RDE) method is widely employed in studies on the hydrogen oxidation/evolution reaction (HOR/HER) owing to its well-defined mass transport behaviors. While it is accepted that the measured HOR current is controlled by both the electrode kinetics and the diffusion of H-2, HER is typically assumed to be free of diffusion limitation. Here we demonstrate that HER could also be diffusion limited when the electrode kinetics is fast, as evidenced by the rotation speed dependent HER current on Pt in acid (pH = 1) and the overlap of the HER polarization curve with the concentration overpotential curve. The HER diffusion limitation originates from the insufficient mass transport of produced H-2 from the electrode surface to the bulk electrolyte and the highly reversible nature of HOR/HER. Kinetic analyses based on HER polarization curves on Pt in acid without correcting for the diffusion limitation could lead to inaccurate Tafel slopes and mechanistic interpretations, and significantly underestimated HER activities. A general data analysis protocol based-on the reversible Koutecicy-Levieb equation is developed to obtain accurate kinetic information of HOR/HER even when electrode kinetics is facile. This new method is compared with other existing methods on Pt disk electrodes at different pHs and thin-film electrodes with different Pt loadings. (C) The Author(s) 2015. Published by ECS.

Yet, the synergistic effect and advance in the cooperated form of crystalline/amorphous interfaces (CAI) have rarely been elucidated insightfully. Herein, a trimetallic FeCo(NiS2)(4) catalyst with numerous CAI (FeCo(NiS2)(4)-C/A) is presented, which shows highly efficient catalytic activity toward both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). Density functional theory (DFT) studies reveal that CAI plays a significant role in accelerating water electrolysis kinetics, in which Co atoms on the CAI of FeCo(NiS2)(4)-C/A catalyst exhibit the optimal binding energy of 0.002 eV for H atoms in HER while it also has the lowest reaction barrier of 1.40 eV for the key step of OER. H2O molecules are inclined to be absorbed on the interfacial Ni atoms based on DFT calculations. As a result, the heterostructural CAI-containing catalyst shows a low overpotential of 82 and 230 mV for HER and OER, respectively. As a bifunctional catalyst, it delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.51 V, which enables it a noble candidate as metal-based catalysts for water splitting. This work explores the role of CAI in accelerating the HER and OER kinetics for water electrolysis, which sheds light on the development of efficient, stable, and economical water electrolysis systems by facile interface-engineering implantations.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2198-3844		WOS:000849599500001	36057998

However, the surface WOC usually exerts little impact on the bulk charge separation of hematite. Herein, an ultrathin citrate-Ni0.9Co0.1(OH)(x) [Cit-Ni0.9Co0.1(OH)(x)] is conformally coated on the fluorine-doped hematite (F-Fe2O3) photoanode for PEC water oxidation to simultaneously promote the internal hole extraction and surface hole injection of the target photoanode. Besides, the conformally coated Cit-Ni0.9Co0.1(OH)(x) overlayer passivates the redundant surface trap states of F-Fe2O3. These factors result in a superior photocurrent density of 2.52 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (V vs. RHE) for the target photoanode. Detailed investigation manifests that the hole extraction property in Cit-Ni0.9Co0.1(OH)(x) is mainly derived from the Ni sites, while Co incorporation endows the overlayer with more catalytic active sites. This synergistic effect between Ni and Co contributes to a rapid and continuous hole migration pathway from the bulk to the interface of the target photoanode, and then to the electrolyte for water oxidation.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000684327200001	34477701

Photosystem II-inspired synthetic transition metal complexes have shown promising OER activity in water-poor or mild conditions, yet challenges remain in the improvement of current density and performance stability for practical applications in alkaline electrolytes in contrast to solid-state oxide catalysts. Here, we report that a nickel pseudo-complex (bpy)(z)NiOxHy (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine) catalyst, which bridges solid oxide and molecular catalysts, exhibits the highest OER activity among nickel-based catalysts with a turnover frequency of 1.1 s(-1) at an overpotential of 0.30 volts, even outperforming iron-incorporated nickel (oxy)hydroxide under an identical nickel mass load. Benefiting from the strong coordination between bpy and nickel, this (bpy)(z)NiOxHy catalyst exhibits long-term stability in highly alkaline media at 1.0 mA cm(-2) for over 200 h and at 20 mA cm(-2) for over 60 h. Our findings indicate that dynamically coordinating a small amount of bpy in the catalyst layer efficiently sustains highly active nickel sites for water oxidation, demonstrating a general strategy for improving the activity of transition metal sites with active ligands beyond the incorporation of metal cations to form double-layered hydroxides.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000710924900031	34619966

It was shown that the AZ31 alloys with CaO exhibit substantially enhanced oxidation resistance. We identified the mechanism for this behavior: with added CaO the AZ31 alloys form protective oxide layers consisting of inner columnar and outer Ca/Mg rich structures. The thicknesses of the protective layers were observed and found to be correlated with the CaO content. The inner columnar layer grows along the [100] MgO due to the small energy barrier to the diffusion of interstitial oxygen ions in MgO. We observed three distinctive steps during the oxidation reaction: the formation of oxide islands, the dissipation of scale and the growth of a columnar oxide layer, and the formation of a double oxide layer due to Ca reduced from CaO. We clearly captured the microstructural evolution of the three different steps, leading to a detailed description of the formation of the protective oxide layers. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Here we report a new type of ultrathin porous Co3O4 nanoplate as a highly efficient OER catalyst. The porous Co3O4 nanoplates annealed at 250 degrees C can be readily synthesized in large quantities with a large surface area of 160.9 m(2) g(-1), a very small crystalline size of similar to 3.0 nm, and a thin thickness of similar to 10 nm. The large surface area provides more surface active sites for the OER. The structural features of the porous nanoplates significantly enrich the amount of surface abundant catalytic sites, provide more active edge and corner cobalt species with low coordination numbers, and subsequently enhance their OER activity. Meanwhile, the thin thickness facilitates efficient diffusion of chemicals and the escape of the generated O-2 within the electrode. Taken all together, the porous Co3O4 nanoplates annealed at 250 degrees C deliver a high OER activity with an overpotential as low as 258 mV at 1 mA cm(-2), a turnover frequency of 0.0042 s(-1) (low bound), a Tafel slope of 71 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH solution and an excellent electrochemical stability.									80	5	0	0	1	0	83			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000352441100054

Results showed that TiO2 nanotube arrays grown in HF electrolyte contained 90% amorphous TiO2 and 10% lower oxidation states of titanium from Ti2+ (TiO) and Ti3+ (Ti2O3) cations. After annealing at 400 degrees C, TiO2 nanotube arrays underwent charge transfer and phase transformation to 93% anatase phase, 6% amorphous TiO2, and 1% suboxides. In contrast, as-grown TiO2 nanotube arrays using NH4F electrolyte possessed less amorphous TiO2 (82%) but more suboxides (18%) due to lower oxygen ion formation from scanty 3 wt % of H2O addition. Its onset temperature of phase transformation was found to be higher than TiO2 nanotube arrays prepared by HF solution. Moreover, when annealed to 400 degrees C, the crystallinity of TiO2 nanotube arrays increased only by 86% for the anatase phase. The lower anatase phase could be attributed to the formation of (NH4)(2)TiF6 type compounds presumably formed by the reaction of TiF62- and NH4+ ions dissociated from NH4F.

The various Ni/NiO nanocomposites are studied via electrically wiring them upon screen-printed graphite macroelectrodes by physical deposition. Subsequently their electrochemical activity, towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), is assessed within (ultra-pure) alkaline media (1.0 M KOH). An optimal annealing time of 2 hours is found, which gives rise to an electrochemical oxidation potential (recorded at 10 mA cm(-2)) of 231 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl 1.46 vs. RHE). These values show the Ni/NiO nanocomposites to be significantly more electrocatalytic than a bare/unmodified SPE (460 mV vs. Ag/AgCl). A remarkable percentage increase (134%) in achievable current density is realised by the former over that of the latter. Tafel analysis and turn over frequency is reported with a likely underlying mechanism for the Ni/NiO nanocomposites towards the OER proposed. In the former case, Tafel analysis is overviewed for general multi-step overall electrochemical reaction processes, which can be used to assist other researchers in determining mechanistic information, such as electron transfer and rate determining steps, when exploring the OER. The optimal Ni/NiO nanocomposite exhibits promising stability at the potential of +231 mV, retaining near 100% of its achievable current density after 28 hours. Due to the facile and rapid fabrication methodology of the Ni/NiO nanocomposites, such an approach is ideally suited towards the mass production of highly active and stable electrocatalysts for application within the anodic catalyst layers of commercial alkaline electrolysers.									12	0	0	0	2	0	12				2046-2069		WOS:000648696300043	35424017

The impact of several relevant variables, including current density (5-55mAcm(-2)), pH (5-8), and type and concentration of the dissolved iron salts on the production of ferrates were examined. In addition, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) studies were conducted using buffered electrolytes with and without the presence of iron (III) to decouple the parasitic oxygen evolution reaction. The LSV measurements in the presence of iron (III) and with a neutral electrolyte exhibit oxidation peaks centered approximate to 2.0V (versus SHE), indicating the production of ferrates at this pH. The rate of ferrate generation is not strongly affected by the pH condition (20%); however, current density and the source of iron were found to have a higher impact on the production rate of ferrates. The efficacy of the process was higher using FeCl3 instead of other sources of iron such as Fe2O3 and FeO(OH). The batch reactor results were successfully interpreted by a simple model that considered the kinetics of the ferrate generation and degradation reactions.									12	1	0	0	4	0	13			0008-4034	1939-019X		WOS:000437698800001

The linear sweep voltammograms and the impedance diagrams of both electrodes show large differences. The cathode reaction is charge transfer-con trolled up to current densities of at least 1 A cm(-2) whereas the dissociative adsorption, charge transfer and diffusion of H-2 appear to limit the anode reaction. The anode, with limiting current densities of about 90 and 150 mA cm(-2) for 1.0 and 6.0 M KOH, respectively, then clearly controls the hydroperoxide ion production in the fuel cell. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that, the carbon of the H-diffusion anode does not undergo significant oxygen functionalisation during hydroperoxide ion generation in the fuel cell.

By applying electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we observe that ISOPOOH undergoes aqueous-phase decomposition upon interacting with Fe(II) ions to form OH and organic radicals at room temperature. To reproduce the measured dependence of OH formation on the Fe concentrations by kinetic modeling, we postulate that Fe(II) ions react with ISOPOOH via Fenton-like reactions to form OH radicals with a rate constant of 7.3 x 10(-18) cm(3) s(-1). At low concentrations, oxalate forms monocomplexes with Fe(II) ions, which can promote OH formation by ISOPOOH. However, at high concentrations, oxalate scavenges OH radicals, thereby lowering aqueous OH concentrations. These findings provide new insight for the atmospheric fate of ISOPOOH and reactive oxygen species generation in the aqueous phase.									11	0	0	0	3	0	11			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000545664900017	32479080

Here, we report highly active 1 nm IrOx particles anchored on 9R-BaIrO3 (IrOx/9R-BaIrO3) that are directly synthesized by solution calcination followed by strong acid treatment for the first time. The developed IrOx/9R-BaIrO3 catalyst delivers a high iridium mass activity (168 A g(Ir)(-1)), about 16 times higher than that of the benchmark acidic OER electrocatalyst IrO2 (10 A g(Ir)(-1)), and only requires a low overpotential of 230 mV to reach a catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(geo)(-2). Careful scanning transmission electron microscopy, synchrotron radiation-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses reveal that, during the electrocatalytic process, the initial 1 nm IrOx nanoparticles/9R-BaIrO3 evolve into amorphous Ir4+OxHy/IrO6 octahedrons and then to amorphous Ir5+Ox/IrO6 octahedrons on the surface. Such high relative content of amorphous Ir5+Ox species derived from trimers of face-sharing IrO6 octahedrons in 9R-BaIrO3 and the enhanced metallic conductivity of the Ir5+Ox/9R-BaIrO3 catalyst are responsible for the excellent acidic OER activity. Our results provide new insights into the surface active-layer structure evolution in perovskite electrocatalysts and demonstrate new approaches for engineering highly active acidic OER nanocatalysts.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000715845900019	34694127

The catalyst comprises active metal(s) (40 wt.%) consisting of nickel (preferred) and/or cobalt, and is a first oxide in reduced form. The reaction product contains odd-numbered hydrocarbons and even-numbered hydrocarbons at least at 2:1 ratio. USE - Process for hydrodeoxygenation of a renewable resource (claimed) useful for production of linear and branched paraffins used as blending stocks of diesel fuel for use in warm and cold climates. ADVANTAGE - The process can be tailored to control the route of oxygen removal through varying the type and/or composition of the catalyst; involves less investment; improves yield even using less expensive active metal catalyst; provides a green diesel which increases the cetane number without negatively impacting the density. That is, decarboxylation and direct decarbonylation routes can be used if minimal use of hydrogen is desired, while indirect decarbonylation or hydrodeoxygenation can be used if minimal evolution of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide is desired. That is, a single reactor and catalyst are used to produce the desired diesel as opposed to conventional two step process which further involves pretreatment of feed material and removal of impurities from the intermediate product prior to further processing.															0						DIIDW:2009A71630

In this work, the BaZrO3 hollow nanostructures with oxygen vacancies were facilely synthesized through one-step solvothermal method using ethylenediamine (EDA) as solvent. The as-synthesized BaZrO3 could split pure water into H-2 without addition of sacrificial agent under UV light irradiation. The photocatalytic H-2 production rate is about 15 times than that of the commercial BaZrO3 (BZO-C). It is believed that the presence of oxygen vacancies and the hollow morphology made contribution to the improvement of photocatalytic performance. This work provides a reference for microstructure and defect modification of photocatalysts at the same time to enhance the photocatalytic performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we report the unique nanosheets of nickel iron hydroxy carbonate hydrate (NiFeHCH) which were prepared through a wet-chemical route within 1 h of reaction time, acting as an efficient electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in both alkaline and near-neutral media. The NiFeHCH was prepared with different concentrations of Fe in different ratios: 1:0.2, 1:0.4, 1:0.6, 1:0.8, and 1:1. Among them, nanosheets of NiFeHCH (1:0.2) were found to have superior OER activity, which required an overpotential of 250 mV to reach 20 mA cm(-2) with a very low Tafel slope value of 39 mV/decade in 1 M KOH. Nanosheets with other ratios also had comparable OER activity with overpotentials ranging from 256 to 290 mV with Tafel slope values from 39 to 49 mV/decade. Nanosheets of NiFeHCH electrocatalysts screened for the OER in 1 M NaHCO3 (pH similar to 8.5) required overpotentials for all of the ratios ranging from 389 to 507 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope values from 155 to 205 mV/decade, of which nanosheets of NiFeHCH (1:0.4) showed better activity by requiring an overpotential of 389 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope value of 155 mV/decade. With these fruitful advantages, these prepared nanosheets of NiFeHCH can be a better alternative to scarce metals for industrial water electrolysis.									53	1	0	0	2	0	53			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000458085900023	30649867

The results showed that the net O-2 evolution at 25-32 psu was unchanged, but significantly decreased at either lower or higher salinities. Hypo-saline (15 psu and below) and hyper-saline (35 psu) conditions induced significant losses of Chl a, carotenoids and phycobiliproteins, which correlated with the decrease in the absorption flux per cross-section of fronds (ABS/CSo). Polyphasic fluorescence transients revealed that salinities at 10 and 35 psu both caused multiple effects on photosynthetic electron transport. Algae exposed to low salinity at 10 psu showed extensive damage to the donor side of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC), reaction centre and acceptor side of PSII. Data on net O-2 evolution showed that 35 psu salinity was more destructive than 10 psu, with the absence of marked osmotic injury to the OEC. The results of this study indicate the possibility of G. amansii cultivation in estuarine waters with 20-32 psu salinity.									6	3	0	0	6	0	7			1745-1000	1745-1019		WOS:000380112000007

However, production of inexpensive and high-efficiency bifunctional electrocatalysts remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a simple method to synthesize a paper-mulberry (Broussonetia papyrifera)-in-spired Co9S8@CoNi2S4/nickel foam (Co9S8@CoNi2S4/NF) heterojunction with high catalytic activity and stability. The process involves in situ growth of NiCo layered double hydroxide and in situ derivatization of ZIF-67, followed by the S heteroatom doping. The Co9S8@CoNi2S4/NF benefits from the heterostructure and functional advantages of multidimensional building blocks including one-dimensional (1D) nanowires, 2D nanosheets and nanoparticles. The optimized Co9S8@CoNi2S4/NF heterojunction with 10% sulphur content reveals excellent electrocatalytic activity with the lower over-potentials of 68 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 170 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 mA cm(-2) in the 1.0 mol L-1 KOH solution, which is superior to the recently reported transition metal based electrocatalysts. The outstanding performance is attributed to the strong interface coupling between CoNi2S4 and Co9S8, the advantage of multidimensional structure and the customized electronic structure. The density functional theory suggests that the interface between Co9S8 and CoNi2S4 optimizes the adsorption of the multiple intermediates and further facilitates water splitting kinetics. This work offers a generic approach for heterostructure engineering design of high-performance catalytic system applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000791642800002

MBH and MBS use protons and sulfur as their respective electron sinks, which helped to conserve energy during early life in the Proterozoic era when the Earth's atmosphere was low in oxygen. MBH and MBS likely evolved from an integration of an ancestral, membrane-embedded, multiple resistance and pH antiporter and a soluble redox-active module encompassing a [NiFe] hydrogenase. In this review, we discuss how the structures of MBH, MBS, multiple resistance and pH, photosynthetic NADH dehydrogenase-like complex type-1, and complex I, which have been determined recently, thanks to the advent of high-resolution cryo-EM, have significantly improved our understanding of the catalytic reaction mechanisms and the evolutionary relationships of the respiratory complexes.									7	0	0	0	7	0	7				1083-351X		WOS:000672866400709	33957129

The electrochemical behaviour of these Ag overlayers has been studied by cyclic voltammetry, and their adsorption properties are significantly influenced by the underlying Pt(111) substrate and markedly different from those of Ag(111). A characteristic voltammetric peak for OH adsorption on pseudomorphic Ag islands has been observed for alkaline solution. A deposition-dissolution hysteresis in the underpotential deposition region for the Ag bilayer suggests exchange processes between subsurface Ag and Pt atoms. Theoretical DFT calculations confirm the stability of a pseudomorphic Ag monolayer. However, it is shown for two and three Ag layers that the formation of sandwich structures is theoretically favoured, i.e. Ag layers tend to be separated by single Pt layers. While Ag displaces hydrogen adsorbed in the underpotential region, the activity of Ag monolayers for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is very close to that of Pt(111). Also, Tafel slopes for HER on the first pseudomorphic Ag monolayer on Pt(111) and for blank Pt(111) are almost identical, whereas thicker overlayers are more Ag-like. It is shown by theoretical calculations for the case of an Ag monolayer on Pt(111) that hydrogen can be adsorbed on the Pt subsurface layer.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000412348100012

In this work, we synthesized free-standing Pd nanochain networks (Pd NCNB) and Pd nanodendrites (Pd NDs) through a direct poly-t-lysine (PLL)-mediated one-pot aqueous method. The presence of PLL and its concentrations were critical in this regard, showing PLL as the structure-directing and capping agents during the nucleation and crystal growth procedures. The synthesized architectures exhibited improved catalytic activity and enhanced durability towards formic acid oxidation and hydrogen evolution reactions relative to commercial Pd black catalyst. Moreover, the electrochemical active surface area and the electrocatalytic performance of Pd NCNs were dramatically enhanced in comparison to Pd NDs mainly owing to the unique network-like structure of Pd NCNs.

Better understanding of catalytic mechanisms at electrode surfaces is thus important for the transition to a clean-energy economy, but is hindered by the difficulty of real-time detection of reaction products and intermediates during electrochemistry experiments. Herein, we present a new type of electrochemistry - mass spectrometry (EC-MS) based on a versatile gas inlet to vacuum fabricated onto a silicon microchip, and compare it to established techniques with focus on sensitivity, time response, and mass transport. The inlet system is able to capture reactant molecules directly from an electrode surface and pass them on to a mass spectrometer on a sub-second time scale with 100% collection efficiency for quantitative analysis with unprecedented sensitivity. The high sensitivity and fast time-response, coupled with well-characterized mass transport of both reactants and products in this setup enables sub-turnover resolution for analysis of electrochemical reactions. The technology and concepts presented here can serve as a platform to improve in-situ mass spectrometry in electrochemistry as well as other fields. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we explored the NO3RR catalytic performance of transition metal-immobilized single-atom catalysts on g-C3N4 by DFT. Preliminary screening work proved that Ti/g-C(3)N(4 )has the lowest limiting potential (UL= -0.3 V) and is the most potential single-atom catalyst for NO3RR. The reaction mechanism analysis of Ti/g-C3N4 also confirmed that it has the selectivity of NO3RR reaction to produce ammonia. This work also proved that the hydrogen evolution reaction does not pose a threat to the ammonia production for Ti/g-C3N4. It is worth mentioning that by analyzing the properties of Ti/g-C(3)N(4 )and 2Ti/g-C3N4, we found that the large spin polarization contributed to the excellent activity and selectivity of the NO3RR ammonia production reaction for Ti/g-C3N4. This work not only finds a new NO3RR catalyst (Ti/g-C3N4), but also provides a new idea for designing new NO3RR catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0926-860X	1873-3875		WOS:000863105100002

The synthesis of nano- and micro-particles of nickel hydroxide is done by two different procedures: sonication process and stirrer. Nano-particles of beta-Ni(OH)(2) are synthesized by chemical precipitation from a solution containing NiCl2 center dot 6H(2)O and surfactant under ultrasonic irradiation. Microparticles of beta-Ni(OH)(2) are synthesized by a similar procedure while applying magnetic stirring instead of ultrasonic. The products are characterized by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray powder diffraction. Under the optimized conditions nickel hydroxide nano-particles, with an average particle size of 18 nm, are obtained. Cyclic voltammetric (CV) studies show a pair of well-defined peaks for Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH redox reaction, along with faster proton diffusion coefficient and higher oxygen evolution potential for nano-particles of nickel hydroxide compared to that of micro-particles. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies of Ni(OH)(2) electrodes show that the reaction occurring at the nickel hydroxide is controlled by charge transfer and Warburg diffusion. The beta-Ni(OH)(2) nano-particles are found to exhibit a superior cycling reversibility and improved capacity when they are used as positive electrode materials of alkaline rechargeable batteries.

Compare to the commercial Pt/C, the Pt/MoC-RGO catalyst show remarkable enhanced electrocatalytic activity for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). The peak current density of Pt/MoC-RGO is 2.4 times of Pt/C. The Pt/MoC-RGO also shows a significant improved CO resistance ability, which likely originates from the abundant Pt-MoC-RGO three-phase interfaces in Pt/MoC-RGO. The long-term stability results show that the electrochemical durability of the Pt/MoC-RGO for MOR is much better than Pt/C, making it a promising next generation electrocatalysts in DMFCs. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analyses reveal the strong synergetic chemical coupling interaction between the Pt nanoparticles and MoC-RGO, which result in significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activity for MOR.

In this paper, bimetallic phosphide nanocages embedded in porous carbon are synthesized through a simple pyrolysis procedure. Firstly, NiFe Prussian blue analogues (PBA) nanocubes were deposited on melamine sponge and in situ etched into PBA nanocages with ammonia solution. Subsequently, the as-prepared PBA nanocages were calcined with phosphorus sources at 350 degrees C to obtain the final catalysts. Owing to 3D macroporous structure of nitrogen doped carbon substrates derived from melamine sponge, the resulted NiFeP Cage@MS exhibits desirable activities and stability toward the OER in alkaline media. Specifically, only a small overpotential of 290 mV is required at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 46 mV.dec(-1). Facile synthesis method and excellent electrocatalysis of NiFeP Cage@MS make it a good candidate of catalyst in water splitting and metal-air batteries.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000487769200008

However, ReSe2 has intrinsically poor conductivity, which leads to the insufficient utilization of electrocatalytic active sites.

The Re0.7W0.3Se2 exhibits an overpotential of 141 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 65.3 mV dec(-1), superior to that of the original ReSe2 and WSe2.

USE - For treating electrically conductive nanoparticles selected from platinum (Pt), Pt alloy, noble metal, metal alloy, metal oxide, and carbon nanoparticles (claimed); useful for coating, stripping, oxidation, reduction, cleaning and dealloying of nanoparticles. Uses include but are not limited to fuel cells, batteries and heterogeneous catalyst. ADVANTAGE - As the nanoparticles are immersed in the liquid electrolyte and intermittently contact the working electrode, all of the nanoparticles can eventually be uniformly treated and can be easily washed out after the treatment. By using the electrochemical cell design, a uniform electrical treatment of a very large volume of nanoparticles can be achieved in a simple and neat way. The cell design combines some advantages of a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell and some of a conventional liquid electrolyte electrochemical cell. In the case when the electrochemical reaction at the counter electrode is not the reverse reaction at the working electrode (e.g. when hydrogen (H2) or oxygen (O2) evolution occurs at the counter electrode), the cell design can prevent the reaction products (H2 or O2) from diffusing to the working electrode.

The reliability of structure and composition pledges that electrocatalysts can achieve predictable and stable performance. However, during the electrochemical reaction, electrocatalysts are influenced directly by the applied potential, the electrolyte, and the adsorption/desorption of reactive species, triggering structural and compositional corrosion, which directly affects the catalytic behaviors of electrocatalysts (performance degradation or enhancement) and invalidates the established structure-activity relationship. Therefore, it is necessary to elucidate the corrosion behavior and mechanism of electrocatalysts to formulate targeted corrosion-resistant strategies or use corrosion reconstruction synthesis techniques to guide the preparation of efficient and stable electrocatalysts. Herein, the most recent developments in electrocatalyst corrosion chemistry are outlined, including corrosion mechanisms, mitigation strategies, and corrosion syntheses/reconstructions based on typical materials and important electrocatalytic reactions. Finally, potential opportunities and challenges are also proposed to foresee the possible development in this field. It is believed that this contribution will raise more awareness regarding nanomaterial corrosion chemistry in energy technologies and beyond.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000825837800001	35334145

Hence, accurately regulate and understand catalytic interface structure are essential to solve this bottleneck and reveal the structure-activity relationship. Herein, a novel trimetal core-shell model with mono-layer Pt-shell is employed for hydrogen electrooxidation to avoid thermodynamic driven bulk/surface composition deviation. On account of the atomic radius discrepancies of 3d-transition metals M (M = Fe, Co and Cu), the electronic structure of mono-layer Pt is regulated by the strainengineered Pd-M core and the electrocatalytic activity for HOR is tuned accordingly. Nevertheless, step-bystep electrochemical monitoring and surface-treatment experiments indicate that the oxophilicity optimization by low-valence M(OH) x species, rather than the hydrogen binding energy (HBE) optimization caused by strain engineering, influence the activity obviously. It is mainly derived from the enhanced adsorption of OHad and accelerated desorption of the Had. The trimetal core-shell model breathes new life into the low-Pt catalyst design for hydrogen electrooxidation reaction.									29	6	0	0	1	0	29			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000547341500001

For the successful application of this technology, advanced electrocatalysts for UOR must be developed to overcome the high overpotential. This can be achieved by introducing Co into Ni-based catalysts. Normally, an optimum ratio of Ni:Co would show the highest activity; however, a higher content of Co adversely affects the catalyst performance. In this study, we provide an explanation for the optimum point in NiCo-based catalysts. In addition to the positive effect of reducing the UOR onset potential, electrochemical analyses suggested that an electro-inactive species for UOR was formed by doping with Co, and this species exerted its influence more strongly as the content of Co increased. Thus, the performance was maximized at an optimum ratio of Ni:Co, at which the advantages and disadvantages of Co-doping were balanced. The results of our study indicated that Co -doping at 10 at% showed the highest UOR catalytic activity as proven by the electrochemical measurements.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000862589100003

Over the course of the reaction, the critical super-saturation evolves both by the formation of new oxygen functional groups and by changes in aerosol size through the formation of gas phase reaction products. A statistical model of the heterogeneous reaction reveals that it is the formation, volatilization, solubility, and surface activity of many generations of oxidation products that together control the average changes in aerosol hygroscopicity. The experimental observations and model demonstrate the importance of considering the underlying population or subpopulation of species within a particle and how they each uniquely contribute to the average hygroscopicity of a multi-component aerosol. To accurately predict changes in CCN activity upon oxidation requires a reduction in the surface tension of the activating droplet by a subpopulation of squalane reaction products. These results provide additional evidence that surface tension-concentration parameterizations based on macroscopic data should be modified for microscopic droplets.									18	0	0	0	2	0	18			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000319576500028	23670352

Utilization of self-generated heat instead of external heating source is an ideal approach for improving the performance of catalysts. Herein, a novel urchin-like hollow TiO2 photothermal nano-catalyst with spatially separated Pt and RuO2 dual cocatalysts combine with carbon layer (denoted as RuO2/TiO2/Pt/C) is reported for catalytic hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation. The photothermal catalytic performance of the as-prepared catalysts was evaluated in relation to structural characterizations and the thermal effect of the carbon layer. The sandwich nanostructure of carbon layer, Pt NPs and TiO2 layer effectively support and protect Pt NPs from agglomeration and deactivation of Pt active sites. The hot electrons generated from carbon layer can participate in the photocatalytic reaction. Furthermore, the enhanced visible light absorption performance of TiO2 is explained by narrowing the band gap due to a small amount of doping carbon and reducing the penetration-loss of light via constructing the hollow structure.

By using this strategy, a novel Fe-doped urchin-like Ni2P/Ni3S2 (NPZFNS@C/NF) heterostructure with metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as the precursor in-suit grows on nickel foam (NF) with abundant hetero-interfaces and carbon-coating is successfully constructed. Owing to the existence of hetero-interfaces and carbon coating, the unique surface electronic structure and d-band center of NPZFNS@C/NF are also obtained. Benefiting from the regulation of electronic structure and d-band center, the NPZFNS@C/NF electrode exhibits extremely high activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and high activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which shows a very low overpotential of 141 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and 129 mV for HER respectively in alkaline electrolyte. Furthermore, it also exhibits a small overpotential of 1.5 V for overall water splitting with NPZFNS@C/NF as both anode and cathode, which is lower than most of non-noble metal-based bifunctional electrocatalysts reported. Density functional theory (DFT) results further confirm that the hetero-interface with carbon coating can further optimize Gibbs free energies for both OER and HER processes. This design and constructure strategy provides a new avenue for overall water splitting.									21	0	0	0	2	0	21			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000707037200084

Herein, Fe-doped Ni-Co phosphide nanoplates with a hierarchical nanostructure were successfully fabricated on a carbon cloth (Fe-x-NiCoP) via a facile method with electrodesposition and PH3 plasma treatment. Benefiting from the hierarchical structure, two-dimensional nanoplates comprising fine nano-crystals and doping effects of Fe, the Fe-x-NiCoP demonstrates excellent electrocatalytic performance for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is sensitive to the Fe content. By controlling the Fe content, Fe-x-NiCoP achieves 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 60 mV for the HER, while Fe-2-NiCoP with a higher Fe doping content drives 50 mA cm(-2) at only 293 mV for the OER. Upon high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, some planar defects were observed in the Fe-doped NiCoP nanocrystals, which may account for the increased exposure of active sites. When the optimal Fe-x-NiCoP electrodes were employed as the anode and cathode for water electrolysis in the alkaline electrolyte, the electrolyzer achieves 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.61 V. Our work might shed light on rational design of the efficient multimetallic phosphide bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									56	3	0	0	1	0	56			2168-0485			WOS:000535305600020

J	Roy, Anindita; Pal, Tarasankar								Silver-induced electronic drift in AgPd bimetallics: rationale for enhanced electrocatalytic activity of ethanol oxidation reaction								NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY				41	20			12278	12287		10.1039/c7nj02371e				OCT 21 2017	2017	Motivated by the possible synergistic electronic effect observed in the Ag and Pd system, simple galvanic replacement reaction (GRR) is carried out for the large scale fabrication of bimetallic AgPd nanoparticles using a modified hydrothermal (MHT) technique. The typical galvanic replacement process under MHT drives the evolution process for AgCl free etched AgPd nanostructure. In the reaction, a sacrificial Ag nanoparticle template in a surfactantless condition is consumed quantitatively depending on the Pd2+ ion concentration. Verification of the synthetic technique has been proved by the change in the nature of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak of the Ag nanoparticle. The as-synthesized unsupported AgPd nanostructure exhibits a superior electrochemical property towards the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) in an alkaline medium in comparison to electrochemically active commercial Pd/C. The enhancement of the catalytic Pd activation relates to its active sites in the presence of Ag. The presence of oxophilic Ag and synergism between Ag and Pd drastically reduces the catalyst poisoning effect, explained by the electron affinity and electronegativity parameters of the participating metals. The Ag-driven electron drift from Pd and the Ag/Pd composition variation successfully illustrate the EOR mechanism.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000412639800094

The results showed that the specific activities in terms of electrochemical surface areas for dGN with N and O atom as the electron acceptor for C atom were greater than those of dGN B, S, and Fe atom as the electron donor. The weak activity by S-doped dGN could be attributed to the low bond polarity between C and S atom. The physical adsorption of hydrogen peroxide on the carbon catalysts limited the reaction kinetics. The amperometric curves of transient catalysis at -0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl revealed that the reductive currents of the tested catalysts for sensing H2O2 follow the order: N-doped dGN > Fe-doped dGN > B-doped dGN > dGN(ht) > S-doped dGN > dGN.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8				0925-4005		WOS:000600965200008

However, isolated single atoms possess high surface free energy, especially under harsh reaction conditions, and tend to migrate and agglomerate into clusters or nanoparticles in an elusive manner. Herein, we have integrated different types of N-doped carbon (N-C) materials as Lewis base sites to anchor dispersed metal atoms. The lone pairs of electrons donated by N-rich materials effectively resist metal sintering. The matrix includes organic compounds, MOFs, N-doped graphene, g-C3N4, and biomass. Furthermore, we also emphasized the application of N-C material-based SACs in ORR, OER, HER, organic reactions, and CO2RR. Beneficially, these establish a definitive correlation between construction strategy and catalytic performance. Finally, we review the staged challenges and development opportunities confronted by SACs and pave the way for balancing the electronic structure and catalytic properties of SACs supported on derived N-C materials.									50	4	0	0	5	0	51			2168-0485			WOS:000579967200002

Herein, a stepwise approach to synthesize a type of hierarchically porous N-doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) grafted onto zinc-based coordination polymer derived carbon nanomaterials (M-NCNT, M = Fe/Co/Ni) is proposed. At first, an isostructural zinc-based metal-organic framework (MOF) to HKUST-1(Cu) (ZnHKUST-1) is solvothermally prepared, and then under pyrolysis to obtain MOF-derived porous carbon. After the secondary calcination, the in-situ formed N-doped CNTs are efficiently catalyzed by iron group metal-based nanoparticles (Fe/Co/Ni), which are thermally reduced by porous carbon together with additional urea. The synergistic effect between ultrahigh porosity, large surface area, suitable N-doping, high graphitization degree, and ultrafine metal particles prompts M-NCNT series to exhibit satisfactory electrocatalysis in oxygen reduction. Among them, Fe-NCNT owns the optimal ORR activity with high positive onset potential (0.987 V), half-wave potential (0.860 V) and large diffusion-limited current density (4.893 mA cm-2). Meanwhile, it shows a high current retention of 90.7% after the 24-hour stability, and the obtained Zn-air battery by Fe-NCNT with open-circuit voltage of 1.44 V owns moderate capacity and satisfying stability. The demonstrated method to prepare hierarchically porous N-doped carbon nanomaterials stemmed from MOF precursors unfolds a new route for the facile construction of efficient nanocatalysts for advanced energy applications.

The Use of Contact Mode Atomic Force Microscopy in Aqueous Medium for Structural Analysis of Spinach Photosynthetic Complexes								PLANT PHYSIOLOGY				169	2			1318	1332		10.1104/pp.15.00706				OCT 2015	2015	To investigate the dynamics of photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes in vascular plants at high resolution in an aqueous environment, membrane-protruding oxygen-evolving complexes (OECs) associated with photosystem II (PSII) on spinach (Spinacia oleracea) grana membranes were examined using contact mode atomic force microscopy. This study represents, to our knowledge, the first use of atomic force microscopy to distinguish the putative large extrinsic loop of Photosystem II CP47 reaction center protein (CP47) from the putative oxygen-evolving enhancer proteins 1, 2, and 3 (PsbO, PsbP, and PsbQ) and large extrinsic loop of Photosystem II CP43 reaction center protein (CP43) in the PSII-OEC extrinsic domains of grana membranes under conditions resulting in the disordered arrangement of PSII-OEC particles. Moreover, we observed uncharacterized membrane particles that, based on their physical characteristics and electrophoretic analysis of the polypeptides associated with the grana samples, are hypothesized to be a domain of photosystem I that protrudes from the stromal face of single thylakoid bilayers. Our results are interpreted in the context of the results of others that were obtained using cryo-electron microscopy (and single particle analysis), negative staining and freeze-fracture electron microscopy, as well as previous atomic force microscopy studies.									20	1	0	0	16	0	20			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000365401000037	26220954

However, little is known about the adaptive response of phytoplankton to them. Here we examine the adaptation of a marine diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii to ocean acidification in combination with ocean warming. Our results show that ocean warming have a greater effect than acidification on the growth of T. weissflogii over the long-term selection experiment (similar to 380 generations), as well as many temperature response traits (e.g., optimum-temperatures for photosynthesis, maximal net photosynthetic oxygen evolution rates, activation energy) in thermal reaction norm. These results suggest that ocean warming is the main driver for the evolution of the marine diatom T. weissflogii, rather than oceanacidification. However, the evolution resulting from warming can be constrained by ocean acidification, where ocean warming did not impose any effects at high CO2 level. Furthermore, adaptations to ocean warming alone or to the combination of ocean acidification and warming come with trade-offs by inhibiting photochemical performances. The constrains and trade-offs associated with the adaptation to ocean acidification and warming demonstrated in this study, should be considered for parameterizing evolutionary responses in eco-evolutionary models of phytoplankton dynamics in a future ocean.

In particular, the well-controlled synthesis of the well-recognized metal-metal nanointer face in a single step remains a key challenge. Here, the synthesis of Cu-supported Ni4Mo nanodots on MoOx nanosheets (Ni4Mo/MoOx) with controllable Ni4Mo particle size and d-band structure is reported via a facile one-step electrodeposition process. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the active open-shell effect from Ni-3d-band optimizes the electronic configuration. The Cu-substrate enables the surface Ni-Mo alloy dots to be more electron-rich, forming a local connected electron-rich network, which boosts the charge transfer for effective binding of O-related species and proton-electron charge exchange in the hydrogen evolution reaction. The Cu-supported Ni4Mo/MoOx shows an ultralow overpotential of 16 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 m KOH, demonstrating the smallest overpotential, at loadings as low as 0.27 mg cm(-2), among all non-noble metal catalysts reported to date. Moreover, an overpotential of 105 mV allows it to achieve a current density of 250 mA cm(-2) in 70 degrees C 30% KOH, a remarkable performance for alkaline hydrogen evolution with competitive potential for applications.									21	0	0	0	2	0	21			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000486875400001

Hence, hybrid structures of metals and semiconductors have been anticipated to have enhanced photocatalytic activities compared to pure metals and semiconductors. To find an optimal hybrid structure for the photocatalytic HER in water splitting, we herein construct Co/CoO hybrid structures with variation of the Co layer thickness, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It is found that the Co/CoO hybrid structures have different electronic characteristics with respect to the Co layer thickness, which leads to the varied photocatalytic activities. Based on this study, we find out the optimal Co layer thickness for the highest HER activity. For the SPR effect, a thick enough Co layer is necessary, while a thin enough Co layer is required for optimal light absorption for the HER in solar-driven water splitting. We believe that this thorough study on the photo-responses occurring in Co/CoO heterojunction systems can be considered as a framework to design new photocatalytic metal/semiconductor heterojunction systems with first-principles studies.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000475689800008

However, its development is limited by the cathode and electrolyte properties, which should include high stability, conductivity, and electrocatalytic properties in oxygen-rich environments. Her; we employ a systematic first-principles study of Li-O-2 discharge and charge reactions on the Co3O4-based cathode with the assistance of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) electrolyte. The structure, stability, and electronic properties of different surface reconstructions of the Co3O4 (100) facet are investigated. In addition, the mechanisms and thermodynamic overpotentials of multi-step reactions between Li+/e(-) and O-2 are provided, where lithium suboxide products (Li2O2 or Li3O2) are formed on the different Co3O4(100) terminations. The solvation shell of Li+ components in explicit DMSO solvent is investigated through ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. In general, we find that the Co3O4(100)-O (oxidized) surface is the most stable one under standard conditions, and the stable Lip solvation structure is found in a tetrahedral Li(DMSO)(4)(+) shell in the DMSO-based electrolyte. Moreover, in the system of the Co3O4(100)-O cathode and DMSO electrolyte, the solution model pathway is energetically favorable for the Li-O-2 discharge reaction. It provides a low constant overpotential of 0.17 V during a long-term discharging process, thus causing the final toroid Li2O2 formation on the cathode. During the charging process, an overpotential of 0.36 V is required to rapidly decompose Li2O2.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000709649600008

Electrochemical hydrogen-water conversion is an ideal energy system that can produce fuels via sustainable, fossil-free pathways. However, the energy conversion efficiency of two functioning technologies in this energy system- namely, water electrolysis and the fuel cell-still has great scope for improvement. This review analyzes the energy dissipation of water electrolysis and the fuel cell in the hydrogen-water energy system and discusses the key barriers in the hydrogen- and oxygen-involving reactions that occur on the catalyst surface. By means of the scaling relations between reactive intermediates and their apparent catalytic performance, this article summarizes the frameworks of the catalytic activity trends, providing insights into the design of highly active electrocatalysts for the involved reactions. A series of structural engineering methodologies (including nanoarchitecture, facet engineering, polymorph engineering, amorphization, defect engineering, element doping, interface engineering, and alloying) and their applications based on catalytic performance are then introduced, with an emphasis on the rational guidance from previous theoretical and experimental studies. The key scientific problems in the electrochemical hydrogen-water conversion system are outlined, and future directions are proposed for developing advanced catalysts for technologies with high energy-conversion efficiency.

J	Costanzo, Francesca								Effect of doping beta-NiOOH with Co on the catalytic oxidation of water: DFT plus U calculations								PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS				18	10			7490	7501		10.1039/c5cp06905j				MAR 14 2016	2016	Electrocatalytic water splitting using energy from sunlight represents a promising strategy for clean, low-cost, and environmentally friendly production of H-2. Unfortunately, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode is kinetically slow and represents the bottleneck of this process. Transition metal oxides are good candidates for the anode in electrochemical water splitting. Inspired by recent computational work on beta-NiOOH, which is considered the active phase during the charging and discharging process in alkaline batteries, we performed density functional theory calculations with the inclusion of the Hubbard-U correction on selected surfaces of pure and Co-doped beta-NiOOH to calculate the energetics of the OER. The goal of the paper is to investigate theoretically whether doping a NiOOH surface with Co might change the mechanism and lower the overpotential of the OER on a specific NiOOH surface, and to what extent the choice of the surface unit cell may affect the results. Our results indicate that the most likely reaction mechanism depends on the amount of Co doping. We find that doping the beta-NiOOH surface with only 25% Co decreases the overpotential from 0.28 to 0.18 V. We also find that the theoretical overpotential, and which step is the potential limiting step, depends on the size of the surface unit cell selected in the calculations. This work highlights how optimizing the binding energies of the various intermediates (O, OH and H2O) on the Ni and Co surface sites, may be key to reducing the overpotential.									25	0	0	0	1	0	25			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000371608600063	26902752

These transition metal-based (oxy)hydroxides (TM(O)OH) are recognized as the most efficient non-noble electrocatalysts for OER, but the rational design and fabrication of TM(O)OH species remain a big challenge. Here we have synthesized a porous metalorganic framework (MOF, CoHKUST-1), and the rapid degradation of this MOF itself in alkaline solution is intrinsically stemmed from the metastable nature of the Co-O coordination bonds in the Co-based paddle wheel. By simply applying an electric potential, these synthesized Co-MOFs can be decomposed into the 2-dimensional nanosheet structure mainly consisting Co(OH)2 and CoOOH. The resulting CoOxHy nanosheets exhibit excellent OER performance to reach an overpotential of only 344 mV at 10 mA cm-2, and its Tafel slope is calculated to be 66.4 mV dec 1 indicating the fast reaction kinetics. The structural and morphological evolution under electrolysis is further proposed and evidenced by relevant physicochemical characterizations and theoretical calculations. The demonstrated work proves a feasible strategy for electrochemical design and fabrication of 2dimensional TM(O)OH nanosheets for efficient water oxidation, which can be further applied in the future energy applications.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000653012200005		
J	Lu, Wangting; Li, Xuwen; Wei, Feng; Cheng, Kun; Li, Wenhui; Zhou, Youhua; Zheng, Wanquan; Pan, Lei; Zhang, Geng								Fast sulfurization of nickel foam-supported nickel-cobalt carbonate hydroxide nanowire array at room temperature for hydrogen evolution electrocatalysis								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				318				252	261		10.1016/j.electacta.2019.06.088				SEP 20 2019	2019	Transition metal sulfide is considered as a kind of promising noble metal-free material for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, most of conventional sulfurization methods require high temperature and/or long reaction time. Herein, a sulfurization strategy at room temperature (25 degrees C) by using Na2S in aqueous solution is applied to sulfurize nickel foam-supported nickel-cobalt carbonate hydroxide nanowire array, during which amorphous sulfide gradually forms on the surface of nanowire and finally replaces the nanowire completely. It is found that the electrode sulfurized for 5 min in which only a thin sulfide layer is formed presents nearly identical catalytic performance for HER with the electrode that is sufficiently sulfurized for 120 min. The electrode sulfurized at 25 degrees C for 5 min only needs an overpotential of 100 mV to achieve hydrogen evolution current at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, and negligible loss of activity is observed after working at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) for 25 h. The interface between carbonate hydroxide and sulfide is considered to play an important role in the catalysis of HER. The observation in this work can provide new insights into the sulfurization process and the role of sulfide in the process of HER. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, transition metal cocatalysts are rarely reported to enhance photocatalytic oxygen reduction (ORR) to generate H2O2. In this work, a light-induced deposition approach was adopted to precisely load nickel sulfide nanodots onto the surface of g-C3N4, and the resultant composite photocatalysts enhanced both photocatalytic HER and ORR performances. In the typical case of NiS@g-C3N4, NiS@g-C3N4-30 displayed a H-2 evolution rate of 3297 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) under visible-light irradiation, which showed 74 and 1.23 times activity for pure g-C3N4 and classical Pt (3%) modified g-C3N4, respectively. NiS@g-C3N4-30 also exhibited the best photocatalytic efficiency with a H2O2 production of 400 mu M in 1 h, which was 12.6 times that of pure g-C3N4. The remarkable activity and stability of this bifunctional catalyst can be attributed to the accurate loading of intimately contacted NiS nanodots at the electron transfer sites of g-C3N4 nanosheets, which can boost the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and accelerate the chemical reaction on the surface of the photocatalyst. This work opens a new pathway for the precise preparation of bifunctional cocatalysts for solar to chemical energy conversion.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000670646600032

However, these metals are rare and expensive, and hence lower cost and more abundant catalysts are needed if electrolytically produced hydrogen is to become more widely available. Herein, we show that electrode-film formation from aqueous solutions of first row transition metal ions at pH 1.6 can be induced under the action of an appropriate cell bias and that in the case of cobalt voltages across the cell in excess of 2 V lead to the formation of a pair of catalysts that show functional stability for oxygen evolution and proton reduction for over 24 h. We show that these films are metastable and that if the circuit is opened, they redissolve into the electrolyte bath with concomitant O-2 and H-2 evolution, such that the overall Faradaic efficiency for charge into the system versus amounts of gases obtained approaches unity for both O-2 and H-2. This work highlights the ability of first row transition metals to mediate heterogeneous electrolytic water splitting in acidic media by exploiting, rather than trying to avoid, the natural propensity, of the catalysts to dissolve at the low pHs used. This in turn we hope will encourage others to examine the promise of metastable electrocatalysts based on abundant elements for a range of reactions for which they have traditionally been overlooked on account of their perceived instability under the prevailing conditions.									125	1	0	0	17	0	127			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000332144300056	24499042

Herein, we present an experimental and theoretical exploration to demonstrate the in situ formation of binary MXene/Ni3S2 nanosheets over three-dimensional Ni foam (NF) in target functioning as a self-supported and highly effective electrocatalyst for alkaline HER Benefiting from the outstanding electrical conductivity, superior hydrophilic interface for gas release, and synergistic coupling of Ti3C2Tx and Ni3S2, the HER test on Ti3C2Tx/Ni3S2/NF in 1 M KOH results in a low overpotential (72 mV) to produce a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The Tafel slope in response is 45 mV dec(-1), which is among the lowest realized for self-supported Ni-based electrocatalysts as well as the state-of-the-art MXene-involved electrocatalysts in alkaline media. Thus-designed catalyst is highly stable for at least 12 h with no decrease in the current density. Density functional theory calculations further reveal that the hybridization of Ti3C2Tx, and Ni3S2 lead to optimized free energy of hydrogen adsorption on the catalyst surface. Our findings might pave a route toward self supported and cost-effective electrocatalyst design via emerging MXene incorporation for next-generation energy applications.									31	0	0	0	2	0	31			2574-0962			WOS:000487770000092

S- FeSi2 island grains with diameters in the 0.5-2 mu m range were formed on the surface of Au-coated TiO2 powder by the co-sputtering method. On the surface of TiO2 powder, the Au-Si liquidus phase was obtained via a Au-Si eutectic reaction, which contributed to the selective deposition and crystallization of S- FeSi2 island grains onto Au. After the loading of the H2-evolution cocatalysts platinum and chromium oxide onto S-FeSi2, the system obtained catalyzed the evolution of H2 and O2 in a stoichiometric ratio from pure water under ultraviolet light irradiation. The transfer of photoexcited electrons in the conduction band (CB) of S- FeSi2 to Pt causes the reduction of protons to H2, and the photogeneration of holes in the valence band (VB) of TiO2 causes the oxidation of water to O2. In addition, the photogenerated holes in the VB of S-FeSi2 and the photoexcited electrons in the CB of TiO2 combined with each other in the Au layer, affording the completion of the overall photocatalytic water-splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-1343			WOS:000874792500001

For optimum bonding and adhesion stability, the alloy particles are grown directly on carbon paper (CP) by the hydrothermal method. The alloy particles are composed of central Cu cores, Ni nests wrapped around Cu core, and small (2.0 nm) Ru nanoparticles embedded at the Ni nests. The Ni surface readily adsorbs water, the high conductivity of Cu increases the electron density of the electrode surface to facilitate water splitting, and the Ru surface adsorbs more H+ ions, thus promoting hydrogen production in the Ru-Ni@Cu alloy. Eventually, despite the use of only 1.0 wt% Ru, the 1% Ru-Ni@Cu/CP electrode exhibits a low overpotential of -0.15 V (eta = 246 mV and 87.08 mV dec(-1)) at 100 mA cm(-2) in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, similarly to the -0.1 V overpotential of the 100% Pt/CP electrode. The electrode maintains excellent catalytic activity without deterioration for 10 days with a Faraday efficiency of 96.89% (50 h) HER and 3000th LSV cycles. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

However, reaching the high durability beside the higher activity is a magnificent challenge. Here, we demonstrate a novel electrochemical approach to produce the uniformly platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) on amine functionalized-reduced graphene oxide (Pt/amino-rGO), via anodic platinum dissolution with improved electrocatalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). High stability and durability of Pt/amino-rGO for hydrogen generation and small poisoning effect of ethanol oxidation products are the crucial advantageous of this hybrid structure. Besides its higher stability, the prepared catalyst displays a 2.2 and 3.5-fold enhancement toward hydrogen generation and ethanol oxidation, respectively rather than Pt/C catalyst. Remarkably, it exhibits the increasing catalytic activity over time and displays the high ratio of forward to backward current (I-f/I-b = 3.3) for ethanol oxidation, which represents the catalyst poisoning resistance. This work opens a new perspective to modulate the surface and interface of carbon-based substrate by loading the metal NPs via a facile electrochemical process with growing activity for many possible applications.

Photooxidation of water was studied in particulate suspension (PS) system and photoelectrochernical (PEC) film system. For PS system, WO3 nanocrystals were suspended in 50 mM AgNO3 solution to measure 02 evolution rate. For PEC system, WO3 films were fabricated by doctor blade method using synthesized nanocrystals. Photocurrent density was measured at AM 1.5 G (1 sun) solar condition in 0.5 M 2SO4. In PS system, the sample calcined at the highest temperature generated the largest amount of oxygen, whereas in PEC system the sample calcined at 600 degrees C showed the maximum photocurrent. The two systems also showed opposite response to deposition of the Pt co-catalyst. These different behaviors were attributed to different mechanisms of charge separation in the two systems.

Herein, hierarchical heterostructured nickel foam-supported Co3S4 nanorod arrays embellished with edge exposed MoS2 nanoflakes (Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs) as an effective HER catalyst are designed. There into, porous nickel foam and moderately distributed nanorod arrays of Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs provide multiscale pathways for efficient charge and mass transport and significantly enlarge the surfaces for the deposition of MoS2 flakes. The superhydrophilic/aerophobic surface improves the electrolyte transport and facilitates the detachment of hydrogen bubbles from the surface of the catalyst. The MoS2 flakes anchored on nanorods are well dispersed with plentiful active sites exposed which enhance the intrinsic activity of active sites owing to the adequate intersection of charge and mass. In addition, there is a synergetic effect of bimetal sulfides, evidenced by increasing the turnover frequency. Therefore, the Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NF affords a low overpotential (eta(10) = 90.3 mV and eta(1000) = 502.0 mV) and small Tafel slope (61.69 mV dec(-1)). This study provides a facile strategy to develop electrocatalysts through the synergy of enhanced thermodynamic and kinetic processes, shedding lights on the advanced design of functional materials for energy chemistry.

The Pt18Ni26Fe15Co14Cu27/C catalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). The catalyst shows ultrasmall overpotential of 11mV at the current density of 10mAcm(-2), excellent activity (10.96Amg(Pt)(-1) at -0.07V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) and stability in the alkaline medium. Furthermore, it is also the efficient catalyst (15.04Amg(Pt)(-1)) ever reported for MOR in alkaline solution. Periodic DFT calculations confirm the multi-active sites for both HER and MOR on the HEA surface as the key factor for both proton and intermediate transformation. Meanwhile, the construction of HEA surfaces supplies the fast site-to-site electron transfer for both reduction and oxidation processes. The design of nanostructured catalysts plays a key role in the electrocatalytic redox reaction performances. Here, authors prepared uniform and small-sized high-entropy alloy PtNiFeCoCu nanoparticles that showed improved activities for H-2 evolution methanol oxidation reactions.									108	4	0	0	4	0	108				2041-1723		WOS:000588060300006	33116124

Herein, we describe a novel approach for the synthesis of conducting electrocatalysts derived from copper/cobalt-containing polypyrrole (PPy) hydrogel. This strategy relies on a pervasive supramolecular way toward controlled in situ synthesis of one-dimensional nanostructured conductive hydrogels using a reasonable dopant counter ion, which is a disc-shaped liquid crystal molecule copper phthalocyanine3,4',4",4"'-tetrasulfonic acid tetrasodium salt (CuPcTs). The formation of supramolecular crosslinked PPy hydrogel allows for efficient and homogeneous incorporation of highly active Co ion. Moreover, Co nanoparticles are also formed and doped into the carbon layer after pyrolysis, which further enhance the electrochemical activities. The prepared catalysts show outstanding electrocatalytic activity for the ORR reaction and the reaction process obviously conformed to a four-electron reduction mechanism in the alkaline electrolyte. Given the uniform nanostructures in present hydrogels, it is accredited that such strategy can offer new approach in high active non precious-metal-based electrocatalysts. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, a multilevel computational approach, which combines ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and constant potential density functional theory calculations, is used to assess proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes and adsorption thermodynamics of key ORR intermediates. These calculations indicate that the potential-limiting step for ORR on Fe-N-C materials is the formation of the Fe-III-OOH intermediate. They also show that an active site model with a water molecule axially ligated to the iron center throughout the catalytic cycle produces results that are consistent with the experimental measurements. In particular, reliable prediction of the ORR onset potential and the Fe(III/II) redox potential associated with the conversion of Fe-III-OH to Fe(II )and desorbed H2O requires an axial H2O co-adsorbed to the iron center. The observation of a five-coordinate rather than four-coordinate active site has significant implications for the thermodynamics and mechanism of ORR. These findings highlight the importance of solvent-substrate interactions and surface charge effects for understanding the PCET reaction mechanisms and transition-metal redox couples under realistic electrochemical conditions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000848573100001	36001092

The main challenge in the development of alkaline water electrolysis systems is finding low cost electrode materials with efficient and durable performance. Palladium-nickel alloys are attractive for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to their good catalytic activity, lower cost, and chemical and mechanical stability. On the other hand, composites of metal oxides and carbons have high potential as supports and co-catalysts in electrolysis processes due to their electronic properties and bifunctional mechanisms. In this work, three different composite supports, SnO2-KB600, SnO2-KB300, and SnO2-graphene, are synthesised and decorated with PdNi nanoparticles (NPs). XRD and ICP-OES are used to characterise the produced electrocatalysts. Their activity for HER and stability in 8M KOH is investigated using linear scan voltammetry and chronoamperometry at temperatures from 25 to 85 degrees C. Charge transfer coefficients, Tafel slopes, exchange current densities, and activation energies are calculated to assess the electrocatalysts' efficiency for HER. The results are compared with those obtained with Vulcan-supported PdNi NPs electrocatalyst. Overall, they demonstrate that the three studied SnO2-carbon composites are promising supports for metal NPs, being beneficial for the lifetime of the PdNi-based electrocatalysts, and increasing their electroactivity performance in alkaline HER applications.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000579549200031

Herein, an ion-induction strategy is developed to synthesize a family of carbon incorporated homobimetallic (CoNi/C, CoCu/C, CoMn/C) phosphide electrocatalyst of hierarchical hollow polyhedral nanocages (HHPNCs) composed of ultrathin 2D subunits. The unique morphological structure effectively optimize the surface active sites, accelerate the charge transfer, and thus boost their superior catalytic activity. Density functional theory calculations reveal that not only the homogenously doped secondary metals but also the incorporated carbon effectively regulates the electronic structure and as a result collaboratively lower the kinetic energy barrier for the OER. Electrochemical measurements show high OER efficiency (eta@10 mA cm(-2) = 267, 262, and 283 mV for samples of CoNi/C-, CoMn/C-, and CoCu/C-HHPNC, respectively) and durability in alkaline electrolytes. Especially, the prepared carbon incorporated homobimetallic HHPNCs show very much higher (almost 9 times) mass activity than the particle counterpart.									19	1	0	0	2	0	20			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000567388100008

The photocatalytic activity trend of the anatase epi layers is similar to that of anatase powders and brookite single crystals in reported recent literature, that is, the H-2 evolution rate exhibits a typical maximum upon hydrogenation under moderate annealing temperatures (500 degrees C). By combining surface sensitive X-ray diffraction methods and analytical high-resolution electron microscopy techniques we reveal quantitatively the oxygen loss from the epi-layer ascribed to the hydrogenation (H-2 reduction) treatment. We observe specific physicochemical changes associated with the introduction of oxygen vacancies: (i) the formation of a nanoscale strained crystal surface, (ii) the agglomeration of point defects in the bulk of the anatase epi layer, and (iii) a transition towards a Ti2O3 like symmetry at the film surface, i.e. an evident oxygen deficiency at the epi layer surface in particular prominent for the most active sample as a function of the hydrogenation parameters. These extensive experimental findings allow us to propose an empirical model, which links detrimental and beneficial effects of Ti3+ centers and oxygen vacancies in the bulk and at the surface and their abundance to an optimum point defect configuration for water splitting via "grey" anatase.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000713781600001

Numerical simulations were based on a previously developed micro-macroscopic coupled model which includes both the proton diffusion in the nickel active material and the hydrogen diffusion in metal-hydride particles. Oxygen generation and recombination, a principal mechanism to ensure safe operation of Ni-MH cells during overcharge, is also accounted for. A sealed Ni-MH cell (AA size, 1 Ah capacity) was prepared and discharge experiments were conducted at various rates. These experimental data along with other discharge and charge data available in the literature were used to validate the present model.

Water catalysis is the key step toward industrial hydrogen generation. Herein, we obtained remarkable performance of CuCo for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in sulfuric acid and potassium hydroxide. The CuCo nanocomposite functional material on nickel foam is rich in copper nanoparticles. The CoCu oxide on nickel foam showed catalytic performance superfast in the HER in a 1 M KOH environment at 1.62 V to carry a 10 mA/cm(2) current density and no decrease in current afterward a non-stop run for 25 hr. CoCu (S2) has a Tafel slope of (a) 69 mV/dec in a 0.5 M H2SO4 and (b) 119 mV/dec in a 1 M KOH. It has been found to be cost-effective, highly active, and healthy for energy conversion by electrochemical. Moreover, the capabilities of charge storage were also inspected. It strongly provides a capacitance of 681 and 607 F/g at a 1 A/g admirable rate of capacitance retention. The attractive features of CoCu oxide are present in more abundance and superior for the HER kinetics activity. The electrocatalyst provides better stability and durability and provides long-term applications for the advance of a functional catalyst for charge storage, and water splitting applications is strongly demonstrated.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0009-4536	2192-6549		WOS:000833976900001

Several litmus tests must be applied to this evolving body of work before it can be viewed with a sufficient degree of confidence. The results of a crucial test are presented here: formulation of thermodynamically and kinetically plausible paths for CO2 formation in the deceivingly simple reaction C + (1 - y/2)O-2 = (1 - y)O-2 + yCO. A mechanism is proposed that clarifies the nature of atoms responsible for adsorption and reaction of molecular oxygen on the surface of Sp(2)-hybridized carbons, both flat and curved, and is also consistent with the postulate that the (re)active sites are carbene- and carbyne-type carbon atoms at graphene edges. Using density functional theory and representative two-dimensional graphene clusters, a direct and an indirect route to CO2 formation were identified as both necessary and sufficient to account for key experimental observations. The former involves single-site O-2 adsorption on carbene-type zigzag edges. The latter includes the presence of mobile epoxide-type oxygen on the basal plane and its insertion into an edge hexagon, analogous to the conversion of benzene oxide to oxepin; such "unzipping" of graphene and CO2 desorption is favored at oxygen-saturated edges, thus accounting for the well-documented phenomenon of induced heterogeneity of carbon reactive sites.									162	3	0	0	11	1	163			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000272207300039	19891428

Fuel cells of direct methanol type have a great advantage in safety and storage compared to hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells. They possess high energy density and are especially suitable for portable applications. The oxidation of fuel in an alkaline medium allows the use of affordable electrodes. The mathematical model of the oxidation process includes a system of non-linear differential equations of high order, describing elementary reactions. The model also possesses 14 unknown reaction constants and 6 dynamic variables describing surface coverages of the intermediates. These variables cannot be measured directly, but can be reconstructed by the parameter identification procedure. The procedure comprises numerical integration of the system of differential equations, automatic global minimization of the distance between measured and modeled cyclic voltammograms, iterative Monte Carlo search and interactive parameter study. The developed methods have been applied to 9 cyclic voltammograms of cells with different concentrations of alkaline and fuel. The reaction constants have been reconstructed, their dependence on concentrations has been discussed. Dynamic behavior of the system in form of the reconstructed evolution of the intermediates has been presented.

These reactions include the use of physical barriers together with local and systemic immune responses. First, epithelia, such as those beneath the cuticle, in the alimentary tract, and in tracheae, act both as a physical barrier and local defense against pathogens by producing antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species. Second, specialized hemocytes participate in phagocytosis and encapsulation of foreign intruders in the hemolymph. Finally, the fat body, a functional equivalent of the mammalian liver, produces Immoral response molecules including antimicrobial peptides. Here we review our current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying Drosophila defense reactions together with strategies evolved by pathogens to evade them.									2229	121	4	0	2124	11	2354			0732-0582	1545-3278		WOS:000246437100024	17201680

Briefly, a Ni(OH)(2)-decorated NF was prepared by a facile hydrothermal method, which was then subjected to thermal ammonoloysis at temperatures between 300 and 600 degrees C. The introduction of N atoms significantly modulates the electronic structure of metallic Ni and maintains metallic conductivity for both HER and OER electron-transfer processes. During the OER, a N,O comodified Ni surface is formed in situ, resulting in an optimized Gibbs free energy for the potential-determining step (Delta G(pds)) of the OER. The compositionally optimized Ni/Ni-N-0.28/NF electrode requires a low overpotential of only 63 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER and 320 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) for the OER. A water electrolyzer constructed using Ni/Ni-N 0.28 /NF as the HER and OER electrodes offered excellent performance and durability, outperforming devices based on Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts. The influence of modulation and coverage of the N atom on the HER performance of Ni/Ni-N, was probed by DFT calculation, with the in situ formation of N, O comodified nanoporous Ni surfaces underpinning the outstanding OER activity of the Ni/Ni-N,/NF electrodes.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2574-0970		WOS:000595546500078

N-C@P-MoS2 with optimized loadings exhibited favorable HER activities with low onset overpotential (117 mV), small Tafel slopes (68 mV/dec), and fine stability compared with pure MoS2 nanosheets and all undoped samples. This is largely ascribed to the synergy of MoS2 and carbon in the rational hierarchical structures, as well as the modified electronic structure with improved conductivity, increased active sites by virtue of N and P doping. Furthermore, P-doped MoS2 nanosheets were encapsulated in carbon spheres (N-C/P-MoS2 (inside)) by controlling the dropping rate of adding MoS2 precursors. As the active sites were hampered, the N-C/P-MoS2 (inside) revealed poor HER performance compared with the core-shell counterparts.

J	Cardoso, SSS; Kan, PC; Savjani, KK; Hayhurst, AN; Griffiths, JF				Cardoso, Silvana/C-7762-2011				The effect of natural convection on the gas-phase Sal'nikov reaction in a closed vessel								PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS				6	8			1687	1696		10.1039/b313138f				APR 21 2004	2004	In an exothermic, gas-phase reaction in a closed vessel, natural convection develops once the Rayleigh number has risen to similar to10(3). The subsequent evolution of the reaction depends on a complex interaction between chemical kinetics, diffusion of heat and mass, and also convection. In this paper, we analyse the interaction between these three processes for Sal'nikov's reaction of two first-order steps in series: P --> A --> B for a purely gaseous system in a batch reactor. Here, the first step is assumed to be thermoneutral, with an activation energy of zero. The second step is exothermic and has a positive activation energy; these properties make such a mechanism one of the simplest to explain thermokinetic oscillations, such as cool flames. We show theoretically that the system's behaviour depends on the relative magnitude of the time scales for chemical reaction, diffusion and natural convection. We calculate these time scales in terms of the chemical and physical parameters of the system. A new three-dimensional diagram is proposed; it enables the different regimes of behaviour for thermokinetic systems to be delineated. Our theoretical predictions are verified by numerical simulation.									25	0	0	0	2	0	25			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000221455200008

The 40% OA-g-C3N4 catalyst can degrade bisphenol A (15 mg L-1) in 240min with a mineralization rate as high as 56%. The Markedly higher visible-light-driven oxidation activity of OA-g-C3N4 is attributed to the porous morphology and unique electrical structure. The porous structure of DA-g-C3N4 provides more active sites for adsorption and degradation of pollutants. Moreover, oxygen atoms in the tri-s-triazine units help to extend sufficient light absorption range up to 700nm, improve the separation of charge-carriers and alter the position of valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB). The VB edge shifts from 1.95 eV to 2.46 eV due to the incorporation of O atoms, which leads to the change of active species in the photocatalytic reaction. Trapping experiment shows that superoxide radicals play the major role in the photocatalytic degradation of BPA on g-C3N4, while hydroxyl radical is the dominant active species in the photocatalytic degradation process over 40% OA-g-C3N4. This study presents a simple, economical and environment-friendly method to synthesized oxygen doped porous graphitic carbon nitride. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The CoM (M 1/4 3d, 4d, 5d block metals) homo and double-atom catalysts supported on nitrogen-doped graphene (CoM/N(4)G) were prepared for electrochemical water oxidation under alkaline conditions, and the electrocatalytic activity was studied through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The hetero CoCu/N(4)G double-atom catalyst indicated the highest OER activity with an onset potential of 0.83 V, while the homo Co-2/N(4)G catalyst showed a higher onset potential of 1.69 V. The decoupled strain, dopant, and configurational effects based on the notable differences between the homo Co-2/N(4)G and CoCu/N(4)G explained the enhanced OER activity, implying that the Cu dopant has a crucial impact on boosting the reactivity by reducing the affinity of reaction intermediates. The enhancement could also be understood from the perspective of the electron structure characteristic through d-orbital resolved density of states (ORDOS) (d(z2), dx(z), dy(z), dx(y), and dx(2) y(2)) analysis. From the ORDOS analysis, we found an apparent alteration of the key orbitals between Co-2/N(4)G ( dz 2, d(xz), and d(yz)) and CoCu/N(4)G (d(z2), dxz, d(yz), and d(xy)) with a substantial change in the overlap ratio (Xd). This theoretical study offers beneficial insights into developing a strategy for efficient OER catalysts utilizing a double-atom structure.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2516-0230			WOS:000809125600001	36132005

The catalysts were prepared by deposition from an organic solution of a mixture of platinum and tin compounds, as well as a heterometallic (PPh4)(3)[Pt(SnCl3)(5)] complex, in which platinum and tin atoms are linked by a metal-metal bond. It has been shown that the use of the heterometallic complex as a precursor with a tin to platinum molar ratio of 5 results in the formation of clusters of nanosized tin (2+; 4+) oxides and particles of a metastable PtSn3 +/-delta alloy on the surface of the catalyst after reductive activation. In the presence of this catalyst, the exhaustive conversion of the feed FATGs and the selectivity for hydrocarbons above 98% have been achieved. The gaseous products CO, CO2, and CH4 are formed in trace quantities. The results show that the deoxygenation occurs not via the known decarboxylation and decarbonylation route, but also through the step of the selective reduction of oxygen and almost complete suppression of cracking of the organic moieties of FATGs.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0965-5441	1555-6239		WOS:000385149300009

In this work, we doped graphene with S element and the results of EDS mapping and XPS showed that the S-doping was successful. In addition, the doping process also faciltated graphene changing from the original chip to a thinner hierarchical structure. Combined with the macrocyclic porphyrin with rich Co-N(4)active sites, the highly dispersed cobalt porphyrin greatly improved the catalytic performance. The high-performance ORR catalyst Por/S/rGO was prepared by S-doping and compositing with cobalt porphyrin, and was applied as a catalyst to the zinc-air battery. Electrochemical tests showed that Por/S/rGO had high ORR activity, which was comparable to commercial Pt/C. The onset potential and half-wave potential of Por/S/rGO were 0.91 and 0.812 V, respectively. Moreover, Por/S/rGO showed better long-term stability and methanol tolerance. Compared with a Pt/C-based Zn-air battery, the Por/S/rGO-based Zn-air battery displayed a higher galvanostatic discharge capacity as well as a desirable stability in 6 M KOH and 0.2 M Zn(OAc)(2)alkaline electrolyte. The enhanced ORR activity of Por/S/rGO was attributed to the rich and highly dispersed Co-N(4)active sites derived from the macrocyclic porphyrin and S-doping strategy.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000564479900002

Stabilization was carried out with pre-treatment in inert atmosphere, and the reactions taking place as well as the structure of the polymer formed were compared to those occurring in one-step (direct) oxidation. Five separate exothermic regions were detected in DSC measurements and they were assigned to seven reaction steps, for which appropriate mechanisms were proposed together with the relationship among individual reactions. The effect of stereoregularity on ring formation is discussed and a new scheme is suggested, which includes the cyclization of alternating nitrile groups in the gauche conformation. The number of successive rings formed during cyclization is determined with three independent methods and compared to previous concepts reported in the literature. The positive effect of pre-treatment in inert atmosphere on the structural stability of PAN during the subsequent pre-carbonization treatment is also demonstrated and explained by considering the mechanism of the reactions taking place during the process.									19	1	1	0	1	0	21			0040-6031	1872-762X		WOS:000458595100024

Oxygen-evolving activity of spruce thylakoids was labile in the absence of osmoticum and declined by 40% during 1 h on ice, compared to a 9% decline observed in spinach thylakoids, We compared the relative activity in spruce and spinach of the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) and the reaction centre in Triton X-100 fractionated membranes prepared and stored for 20 or 240 h at 0 or -80 degrees C in media with different combinations of sucrose (0.3, 0.5 and 1.0 M) and two pH values (6.0 and 7.6). In membranes detergent-fractionated and stored at pH 7.6, photosystem 2 (PS2) activity (H2O --> DCIP) was sensitive to sucrose concentration of the medium. Spruce and spinach membranes prepared and stored in 0.3 M sucrose and pH 7.6, showed 22 and 48% activity of their respective control membranes, freshly prepared in 1 M sucrose at pH 6.0. In contrast, in membranes prepared and stored at pH 6.0, PS2 activity was less sensitive to sucrose concentration: spruce and spinach membranes in 0.3 M sucrose showed 73 and 88% (respectively) of the activity of membranes freshly prepared in 1 M sucrose. In both species, the degree of stimulation of DCIP photoreduction by diphenylcarbazide suggested minimal damage to the reaction centre (RC) except during preparation in 0.3 M sucrose, pH 7.6. Since the spruce RCs were not more labile than those of spinach, the extra sensitivity of spruce thylakoids in media of low sucrose concentration was likely due to extra lability of the OEC.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0300-3604			WOS:A1995RT06900008

Our work reports a core-shell nanostructure that is constructed by the electrodeposition of ultrathin NiFe-LDH nanosheets (NiFe-LDHNS) on Cu2Se nanowires, which are obtained by selenizing Cu(OH)(2) nanowires in situ grown on Cu foam. The obtained Cu2Se@NiFe-LDHNS electrocatalyst provides more exposed edges and catalytic active sites, thus exhibiting excellent OER and HER electrocatalytic performance in alkaline electrolytes. This catalyst needs only an overpotential of 197 mV for OER at 50 mA cm(-2) and 195 mV for HER at 10 mA cm(-2). Besides, when employed as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water-splitting, it requires a cell voltage of 1.67 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media. Furthermore, the corresponding water electrolyzer demonstrates robust durability for at least 40 h. The excellent performance of Cu2Se@NiFe-LDHNS might be ascribed to the synergistic effect from the ultrathin NiFe-LDHNS, the Cu2Se nanowires anchored on the Cu foam, and the formed core-shell nanostructure, which offers large surface area, ample active sites, and sufficient channels for gas and electrolyte diffusion. This work provides an efficient strategy for the fabrication of self-supported electrocatalysts for efficient overall water-splitting. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Springer Proceedings in Physics (276)								1	12		10.1007/978-981-19-1774-5_1				2022	2022	Graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4), as one of the promising candidates for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, owns the advantages of visible light response, good stability, and no harm to the environment. However, the photocatalytic water splitting of g-C3N4 has been limited due to its slow photocarrier transfer rate and insufficient light absorption. Herein, carbon dots (CDs) were prepared by a hydrothermal method using ginkgo biloba leaves as the raw material. Afterwards, the g-C3N4 nanosheets decorated with CDs were obtained by a thermal polymerization method. CDs have unique way of light-induced charge transfer and special heterogeneous interface. The reservoir characteristics of the composite enable to greatly reduce the recombination of photo-generated carriers and significantly improve the hydrogen evolution efficiency. In this work, we found that g-C3N4 decorated with 1.0 wt% CDs achieved the highest hydrogen evolution rate (2878.2 mumol/h/g) under visible light (lambda > 420 nm), which was about 5 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4 (582.2 mumol/h/g).

The result of electrochemical tests shows that crystalline Ni12P5 has much higher HER catalytic activity than the amorphous one. X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that Ni-P bond formed during crystallization, making Ni positively charged and P negatively charged. This charged nature of Ni12P5 is similar to [NiFe] hydrogenase and its analogous, which make the removal of H-2 less energy-cost.									21	3	0	0	0	0	22			1003-6326	2210-3384		WOS:000397268900014

Thus, the results obtained provide decisive supporting proof for our previously reported concept (J. Applied Electrochem., 49, 949-962, 2019). A DSA prepared on Pt gauze (DSA/Pt gauze, De Nora Permelec Ltd) was adapted as the anode. The point of hydrogen detection was the exclusion of dissolved oxygen from water in both compartments. The hydrogen evolution reaction was strongly hindered by dissolved oxygen. Therefore, we developed a large-sized closed cell equipped with a purging system, Gastight-BPMTHEA-2CC. Dissolved oxygen was excluded by purging an aqueous solution with an inert gas flow for more than 1 day. Inert gas purging was disconnected by closing the cell with a rubber septum. In operando site-dependent gas analysis at a holding voltage of 1.2 V was performed with a syringe technique. Molecular hydrogen was observed in the cathodic compartment, and molecular oxygen was also detected in the anodic compartment. Even though only the Pt gauze anode was used instead of DSA/Pt gauze, molecular hydrogen was also observed at the cathodic compartment. The counterions for the cation and anion exchange membranes in the BPM used, Na+(CEM)vertical bar(AEM)Cl-, are Na+ and Cl-, respectively. To eliminate the influence of Cl- ions, they should be exchanged with OH- ions by immersing BPM in NaOH solution before use. Hydrogen generation derived from WD proceeds whether the BPM counter ion is Cl- or OH-. We also observed molecular hydrogen by using the as-received BPM, indicating that we can demonstrate hydrogen generation from sea water and saline solution with Gastight-BPMTHEA-2CC by applying a voltage that is less than the theoretical limit of 1.23 V for water splitting.[GRAPHICS].									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000725380200001

Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism for the role of ANPs in EMs still remains limited. By means of reactive molecular dynamics simulations with the ReaxFF potential, the present work focuses upon the evolution of ANPs in a hot EM of 2,4,6-trinitro-1,3,5-triaminobenzene (TATB), which features very high insensitivity and O-lack. As a whole, adding ANPs unexceptionally increases heat release, and the morphological evolution of ANPs significantly depends on their sizes and contents, as the smaller size and the smaller content facilitate microexplosion. Moreover, a cracking of the core-shell structured Al@Al2O3 is observed in the hot TATB, as in oxygen. Besides Al-O bonds, Al-C and Al-N bonds are formed owing to the O-poor character of TATB. In addition, fusion of four ANPs in a model is observed as the reaction proceeds. A hollow alumina sphere is formed when adding an Al@Al(2)O(3 )particle to hot TATB, and it is found that there is an inward O transport and more O atoms concentrated around the center of an ANP with a relatively large size and high content. This work is expected to deepen insight into the complex reaction mechanism of ANPs-containing EMs.									10	2	0	0	0	0	12			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000535281300055

Metastable FCC Mo and BCC Mo coatings were prepared by R.F. sputtering with varying R.F. power (100-170W) and Ar pressure (3-11 mTorr). Experimental results indicated that the Mo coating deposited at lower power and higher pressure had smaller crystallite size. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy showed that the Mo coating deficient in crystallinities contained micro voids residing in the boundaries of the columnar grains and had higher oxygen content, as measured by energy dispersive spectroscopy. The crystallinity of Mo coatings strongly influenced the open circuit potential in the electrolyte for CIS electrodeposition. Consequently, the Cu/In ratio of CIS deposits plated at a constant potential (-0.7 vs. SCE) varied with the distinct Mo coatings. Moreover, the CIS deposit on the various Mo-coated glasses displayed a different morphology. The effect of the crystallinity of Mo coatings on hydrogen evolution reaction at pH 1.55 was also explored. Hydrogen evolution during the CIS electrodeposition may be one of the key factors to influence the CIS morphology. How the crystallinity of the Mo coating affects the composition and morphology of the CIS deposits can be useful for device fabrication and deserves for further study. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

NH4BF4 results in formation of passive films that reveal a wide spectrum of well-defined colors. Such layers on Ti can be subsequently modified by their doping with RuO2, IrO2, and RuO2+IrO2. This method is based on thermal oxidative decomposition of the respective Ru or/and Ir chlorides. Such formed Ru or/and Ir oxides are incorporated into the colored passive layers, thus modifying their chemical, physical and electronic properties. The morphology of such modified films is examined by SEM and the results show that they possess distinct features. In the case of the RuO2-modified layer, the surface appears free of cracks or fractures. On the other hand, the IrO2 and RuO2+IrO2 modified passive layers are cracked and fractured. Electrochemical behavior of the modified films is examined by recording polarization curves and Tafel steady-state plots in the hydrogen evolution reaction region. Important electrochemical parameters such as the corrosion potential, corrosion current density, extent of surface passivation, Tafel slope and exchange current density are determined and compared. The chemically modified passive layers on titanium show superior electrocatalytic properties towards the hydrogen evolution reaction with respect to the pure Ti or colored layers, yet their applicability is directly related to the surface morphology. The RuO2 modified film might become a Ti-based cathode due to the lack of surface crack or fracture.

The effect of Co3S4/Fe(3)S(4 )heterostructures on the electrocatalytic water splitting was investigated in alkaline solution. The CoFe-HM-T electrode exhibited excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic activity with overpotentials of 320 mV and 200 mV at the current density of 100 mA cm-2, respectively. CoFe-HM-T also possessed the smallest Tafel slope among the prepared samples, which was estimated to be 38.1 mV dec(-1) and 144.9 mV dec(-1) for OER and HER, respectively. Serving as bifunctional catalysts, the CoFe-HM-T electrode reached the state-of-art cur-rent density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.70 V with excellent stability. The enhanced electrocatalytic activity was ascribed to the interconnected structure facilitating the mass transport, the heterojunction accelerating the charge transfer, and the synergistic effect between them. This study offered a new strategy for in situ synthesizing the heterojunction electrocatalysts with unique interface by readily tuning the metal components in transition-metal LDHs.(C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Despite previous attempts, there is still need for robust and thoroughly validated models. Here, a steady-state two-dimensional unit-cell model of an all-vanadium redox flow battery is presented. The model integrates state-of-the-art descriptions of the fundamental physical phenomena, along with new features such as local mass transfer coefficients for each active species, precise sulfuric acid dissociation kinetics, and experimental data of the electrochemical parameters and electrolyte properties. The model is validated at different states of charge and flow rates using polarization, conductivity and open circuit voltage measurements. Then, the contribution of operating conditions on battery performance is studied by analyzing its separate effect on the various phenomena that affect cell performance, such as local pore mass transfer limitations, parasitic hydrogen evolution reactions, crossover and self-discharge fluxes. The resulting model is a reliable tool that can be used to assess the relevance of these coupled phenomena that take place simultaneously within the reaction cell. This important information is critical to optimize cell components, reactor design and to select optimal operating conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000869985900001

Here, for the first time we realized the oriented growth of ultrasmall metal nanoparticles (NPs) on metal-organic framework nanosheets (MOF NSs) by precisely regulating the reduction kinetics of metal ions with solvents. In particular, a rapid reduction of metal ions leads to the random distribution of metal NPs on the surface of MOF NSs, while a slow reduction of metal ions results in the oriented growth of NPs on the edge of MOF NSs. Impressively, the strong synergy between Pt NPs and MOF NSs significantly enhances the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance, and the optimal catalyst displays HER activities superior to those of a composite with a random growth of Pt NPs and commercial Pt/C under both acidic and alkaline conditions. Moreover, the versatility of such oriented growth has been extended to other metal NPs, such as Pd, Ag, and Au. We believe this work will promote research interest in material design for many potential applications.									27	0	0	0	3	0	27			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000709467900026	34601870
