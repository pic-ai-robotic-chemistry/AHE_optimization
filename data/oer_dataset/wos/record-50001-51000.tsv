The obtained nanofibers (with optical bandgap of 2.51 eV) exhibit photocatalytic activity in photoelectrochemical cells, yielding saturated cathodic photocurrent of ca. 10 mu A cm(-2) (0.3-0 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode). By incorporating thieno[3,2-b] thiophene units into the nanofibers, a redshift (ca. 100 nm) of light absorption edge and twofold of the photocurrent are achieved, rivalling those of state-of-the-art metal-free photocathodes (e.g., graphitic carbon nitride of 0.1-1 mu A cm(-2)). This work highlights the promise of utilizing acetylenic carbon-rich materials as efficient and sustainable photocathodes for water reduction									75	9	0	0	6	0	77			2041-1723			WOS:000427698700009	29555937

This approach was used to amplify fragments of the napA gene from 10 Pseudomonas species and one Moraxella sp., previously shown to be able to express the periplasmic nitrate reductase activity, from Rhodobacter capsulatus and from community DNA extracted from a fresh-water sediment. Amino acid sequences encoded by the napA fragments were compared to one another;md to the corresponding regions of related enzymes. This comparison indicates that the amplification protocol is specific for its intended target. The napA sequences amplified from community DNA were tightly clustered, which may indicate a degree of homogeneity in the sediment community. All tested Gram-negative strains capable of aerobic nitrate respiration were found to have periplasmic nitrate reductase genes. However, some strains which have and express the genes are incapable of aerobic nitrate respiration. The PCR primers and amplification protocols described will be useful in future studies of nitrate respiring populations. (C) 1999 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

This study investigates anthropogenic contamination in the shallow alluvial aquifer of the MaranaCasinca, hydraulically connected to the Biguglia lagoon (Corsica, France). A multi-tracer approach, combining geochemical and environmental isotopic data (delta O-18-H2O, delta H-2-H2O, H-3, delta N-15-NO3-, delta O-18-NO3-, delta B-11), and groundwater residence-time tracers (H-3 and CFCs) was carried out in 2016, and integratedwith a study of land use evolution in the catchment during the last century. Groundwater NO(3)(-)concentrations, ranged between 2 mg/L and up to 30 mg/L, displaying the degradation of groundwater quality induced by anthropogenic activities (agricultural activities). Comparatively high delta N-15-NO3- values (up to 19.7%) in combination with delta B-11 values that were significantly lower (between 23% and 26%) than the seawater background are indicative of sewage contamination. The ongoing deterioration of groundwater quality can be attributed to the uncontrolled urbanization development all over the alluvial plain, with numerous sewage leakages fromthe sanitation network and private sewage systems. Integration of contaminant andwater-residence time data revealed a progressive accumulation of pollutants with timein the groundwater, particularly in areas with major anthropogenic pressure and slowdynamic groundwater flow. Our approach provides time-dependent insight into nitrogen pollution in the studied aquifer over the past decades, revealing a systematic change in the dominant NO3- source, from agricultural to sewage contamination. Yet, today's low groundwater quality is to large parts due to legacy pollution from land-use practices several decades ago, underlining the poor self-remediating capacity of this hydrosystem. Our results can be taken as warning that groundwater pollution that happened in the recent past, or today, may have dire impacts on the quality of groundwater-dependent ecosystems in the future.

J	Wang, Wei; Yu, Xiao; Ning, Qin; Luo, Xiao-ping								[Increased apoptosis after intra-amniotic endotoxin priming plus hyperoxic exposure in lungs of preterm newborn rats].								Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics				47	10			767	73						2009-Oct	2009	OBJECTIVE: Apoptosis has been shown to be involved in lung remodeling in both rat lung and human fetal lung explants. Mounting evidence suggests the pro- and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family exert most of their function at the mitochondrial level and play pivotal roles in the process of apoptosis. Molecules such as Bax (death agonist) and Bcl-2 (death antagonist) act in competition, and their relative abundance and dimerization can determine cell death or cell survival. It is not known whether apoptosis is in part responsible for the impaired lung growth found in preterm developing lung exposed to intra-amniotic endotoxin priming plus hyperoxia, and imbalance of Bax/Bcl-2 contributes to it. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression apoptosis index (AI), Bax and Bcl-2 in premature lungs of rats with intra-amniotic endotoxin priming and/or exposed to 60% O(2) and to elucidate the relationship between intrauterine inflammatory/chronic O(2) exposure and the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).METHODS: Timed pregnant Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into two groups: lipopolysaccharide (LPS) group and saline group. LPS or saline were intra-amniotically injected into the sacs on gestational age day 15 (70% of term). Six days after intra-amniotic injection, the preterm rats were delivered and randomized to put in 60% O(2) exposure or in room air. On days 1, 7 and 14 after birth, the lungs were removed and dissected from the main bronchi for analysis. Total RNA were extracted from the right frozen lung tissues. Lung AI was measured by terminal transferase nick end labeling (TUNEL) and Bax and Bcl-2 mRNA levels were measured by semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).RESULTS: (1) To quantify the proliferation of preterm lungs after intra-amniotic endotoxin priming and/or exposed to 60% O(2), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in the four experimental groups were measured: PCNA increased along with the lung development from d1 to d14 in both control and endotoxin alone groups. However, in endotoxin alone group, PCNA was significantly lower than that of controls from d1 to d14. In hyperoxia alone group, PCNA begun to decreased on day 7, and became significantly lower than that of the control group on day 14 (P < 0.05). In endotoxin plus hyperoxia group, PCNA was significantly lower than that of controls on days 1 and 7. (2) To quantify the apoptosis of immature lungs after intra-amniotic endotoxin priming and/or exposed to 60% O(2), AI increased along with the lung development from d 1 to d 7 in both control group and endotoxin alone group. However, in endotoxin alone group, AI was significantly higher than that of controls from d1 to d7. In hyperoxia alone group, AI begun to increased on day 7, and became significantly lower than that of the control group on day 14 (P < 0.05). In endotoxin plus hyperoxia groups, AI was higher than controls on days 1 and 7, and became significantly higher than those of the other 3 groups on day 14. (3) RT-PCR showed that mRNA of Bax decreased while Bcl-2 mRNA increased from day 1 to day 14 in endotoxin alone group, and they were significantly higher than those of controls on day 1 (P < 0.05). Conversely, Bax mRNA increased while Bcl-2 mRNA decreased from day 1 to day 7 in hyperoxia treated groups, and was significantly different from that of the control group on days 7 and 14 in both hyperoxia treated groups.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that intra-amniotic endotoxin presensitization and exposure to hyperoxia may inhibit proliferation of lung cells. Increased expression of Bax and Bcl-2 may be related to the evolution of lung injury and may contribute to the pathogenesis of BPD.									0	2	0	0	0	0	2			0578-1310			MEDLINE:20021812	20021812

While warming can change the impact of pollutants and pollutants can change the sensitivity to warming, both interaction pathways have never been integrated in a single experiment. Therefore, we tested the effects of warming and multiple pesticide pulses (allowing accumulation) of chlorpyrifos on upper thermal tolerance (CTmax) and associated physiological traits related to aerobic/anaerobic energy production in the damselfly Ischnura elegans. To also assess the role of latitude-specific thermal adaptation in shaping the impact of warming and pesticide exposure on thermal tolerance, we exposed larvae from replicated high- and low-latitude populations to the pesticide in a common garden rearing experiment at 20 and 24 degrees C, the mean summer water temperatures at high and low latitudes. As expected, exposure to chlorpyrifos resulted in a lower CTmax. Yet, this pesticide effect on CTmax was lower at 24 degrees C compared to 20 degrees C because of a lower accumulation of chlorpyrifos in the medium at 24 degrees C. The effects on CTmax could partly be explained by reduction of the aerobic scope. Given that these effects did not differ between latitudes, gradual thermal evolution is not expected to counteract the negative effect of the pesticide on thermal tolerance. By for the first time integrating both interaction pathways we were not only able to provide support for both of them, but more importantly demonstrate that they can directly affect each other. Indeed, the warming-induced reduction in pesticide impact generated a lower pesticide-induced climate change sensitivity (in terms of decreased upper thermal tolerance). Our results indicate that, assuming no increase in pesticide input, global warming might reduce the negative effect of multiple pulse exposures to pesticides on sensitivity to elevated temperatures.

The surface properties of single crystals, thin films and powdered samples (sintered at progressive higher temperatures) are considered and compared, with the aim of demonstrating that the gap between "believed perfect" single crystal surfaces, typical of "pure" Surface Science, and high surface area samples, typical of Catalysis Science, can be progressively reduced. The surface features considered in this review are the structural (morphological), optical, absorptive and reactive properties. As the carbon monoxide molecule is able to probe the surface properties of both anions and cations, it can give a complete information of the surface structure of MgO samples. For this reason the adsorption and spectroscopy of this molecule is preferentially considered in this review. Particular emphasis is given in reviewing results obtained by high resolution transmission microscopy and in situ IR spectroscopy of adsorbed species (in both reflection and transmission modes), but also UV-Vis diffuse reflectance, photoluminescence, TDS, EPR, electron based techniques are mentioned. Reviewed experimental results are also commented in view of the important theoretical literature available on this topic and are complemented by new transmission IR data concerning CO adsorbed, down to 60 K, on powdered MgO samples with increasing surface area. These innovative experiments allow us to perform, on powdered samples, the adsorption experiments typical of single crystals (or films) Surface Science, with an increase of the S/N of the vibrational features higher than two order of magnitude.As far the new results (never published before) are concerned, we report IR spectra of CO dosed at 60 K on polycrystalline MgO samples with different surface area obtained by Mg(OH)(2) decomposition and progressive sintering at high temperature. The samples morphology of each sintering stage has been controlled by high resolution TEM. The decomposition of the hydroxide to oxide is shown to occur with partial retention of the long range order, with formation of layers of compenetrated cubes oriented according to the original brucite planes. The CO adsorption experiments have been carried out using a new apparatus developed ad hoc to perform in situ mid-IR experiments, in transmission mode, on an activated (up to 1100 K) powdered samples in the desired atmosphere at any defined temperature in the 300-20 K interval.The influence of the surface area on the IR features characterizing the MgO/CO system at 60 K have been investigated by increasing the sintering treatment of the native Mg(OH)(2) and by preparing a low area MgO smoke sample, obtained by Mg combustion. New results have been compared with literature data obtained on powdered MgO at higher temperature and on MgO single crystals and thin films. A decrease of about 40 K with respect to the classical IR experiments reported in the literature results in a remarkably detailed evolution of the spectra as a function of CO pressure, allowing us to better understand the complex interaction of the CO molecule with the different cationic and anionic sites of the MgO surface. In particular, it has been possible to observe the precursors of the polymeric species, formed on the basic coordinatively unsaturated O2- sites, which dominate the room temperature spectra. Ab initio calculations, on simple models, have been used for the vibrational assignment of surface species. A qualitative agreement has been obtained between computed and experimental IR modes. The evolution of the spectra at decreasing MgO surface area (i.e. upon decreasing the surface defectivity) results in spectra whose features are well comparable with those obtained by IRAS on vacuum cleaved single crystals, but characterized by a much better signal/noise ratio. The temperature evolution of the intensity of the IR features of CO adsorbed on individual adsorption sites allows, unlike microcalorimetric experiments, the determination of site-specific adsorption enthalpies. The adsorption enthalpy of Mg2+...(CO) adducts on 5- and 4-fold coordinated magnesium cations are similar to12 and similar to22 kJ mol(-1) respectively. This relevant amount of new experimental data allows us to critically review experimental and theoretical works appeared in the literature on this case study of Surface Science.

We investigated how guard cells respond to elicitors that can be generated from cell walls of plants or pathogens during pathogen infection. The effect of oligogalacturonic acid (OGA), a degradation product of the plant cell wall, and chitosan (beta-1,4-linked glucosamine), a component of the fungal cell wall, on stomatal movements were examined in leaf epidermis of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L.) and Commelina communis L. These elicitors reduced the size of the stomatal aperture. OGA not only inhibited light-induced stomatal opening, but also accelerated stomatal closing in both species; chitosan inhibited light-induced stomatal opening in tomato epidermis. The effects of OGA and chitosan were suppressed when ECTA, catalase, or ascorbic acid was present in the medium, suggesting that Ca2+ and H2O2 mediate the elicitor-induced decrease of stomatal apertures. We show that the H2O2 that is involved in this process is produced by guard cells in response to elicitors. Our results suggest that guard cells infected by pathogens may close their stomata via a pathway involving H2O2 production, thus interfering with the continuous invasion of pathogens through the stomatal pores.									290	39	0	0	266	5	331			0032-0889			WOS:000082578300016	10482669	
J	Xikeranmu, Zilajiguli; Ma, Ji; Liu, Xiaoning								Characterization of a Mn-SOD from the desert beetle Microdera punctipennis and its increased resistance to cold stress in E. coli cells								PEERJ				8						e8507	10.7717/peerj.8507				FEB 14 2020	2020	Insects have developed a complex network of enzymatic antioxidant systems for handling reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during stress. Superoxide dismutases (SODs) play a determinant role in balancing ROS in insect. However, studies devoted to SODs functions in insects under cold stress are limited. In the present study, we attempted to identify and characterize a mitochondrial manganese SOD (mMn-SOD) from the desert beetle Micordera punctipennis (denoted as MpmMn-SOD) and explore its protective effects on bacteria cells under cold stress. MpmMn-SOD is composed of 202 amino acids with conserved domains required for metal ions binding and enzyme activity. RT-qPCR experiments revealed that the expression of MpmMn-SOD was ubiquitous but tissue-specific and was induced by cold stress. An E. coli (BL21) system was applied to study the function of MpmMn-SOD. The MpmMn-SOD gene was cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pET-32a to generate a recombinant plasmid pET-32a(MpmMn-SOD). After transformation of the plasmid into E. coli BL21, the fusion protein Trx-His-MpmMn-SOD was overexpressed and identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Antioxidant activity assay showed that the death zones of the transformed bacteria BL21 (pET32a-mMn-SOD) were smaller in diameter than the control bacteria BL21 (pET32a). Survival curves under -4 degrees C showed that BL21 (pET32a-mMn-SOD) had significant enhanced cold resistance compared to BL21 (pET32a). Its SOD activity under -4 degrees C had a significant negative correlation (r = -0.995) with superoxide anion O-2(center dot-) content. Accordingly, under cold stress BL21 (pET32a-mMn-SOD) had lower electric conductivity and malondialdehyde (MDA) content than BL21 (pET32a). Taken together, our results showed that cold stress stimulated the expression of MpmMn-SOD in M. punctipennis. The E. coli cells that overexpress MpmMn-SOD increase their resistance to cold stress by scavenging ROS, and mitigate potential cell damage caused by ROS under cold conditions.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2167-8359			WOS:000513590700006	32095349	
J	Li, Shi; Ruan, Luoyuan; Wang, Shanpeng; Wang, Zhiyu; Ren, Zhaohui; Han, Gaorong								Surface energy-driven solution epitaxial growth of anatase TiO2 homostructures for overall water splitting								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				46				139	144		10.1016/j.jmst.2020.01.038				JUN 1 2020	2020	Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been extensively investigated as a photocatalyst for water splitting to produce H-2. However, an overall water splitting by using anatase TiO2 is extremely difficult due to the short lifetime of holes. In this work, we propose that a surface energy decrease from {001} to {101} of anatase TiO2 is able to drive an epitaxial growth. A novel anatase TiO2 homostructure has been successfully synthesized via a facile hydrothermal route, where {101} semi-pyramid nanoparticles epitaxially grew on the both sides of the {001} nanosheets. The epitaxial relationship between the nanoparticles and the nanosheets has been characterized to be {001}/1{001} of anatase TiO2. For the first time, it is interesting to find that the homostructure with 12 wt% of {101} semi-pyramid can significantly improve the H-2 evolution rate by nearly 5 times compared to the pure nanosheets under the ultraviolet irradiation. More importantly, such homostructure enables 10.78 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) of O-2 production whereas the pure nanosheets cannot evolve detectable O-2 gas. Meanwhile, the time-resolved photoluminescence analysis indicates that the mean lifetime of the holes is increased from 2.20 ns of the nanosheets to 3.59 ns of the homostructure, accounting for the observed overall water splitting. The findings suggest that constructing a homostructure by a surface energy strategy could be promising towards overall water splitting, which may be applicable to other photocatalytic materials.

Each minichromosome is 3 to 4 kb long and has 1 to 3 genes. There is unequivocal evidence for recombination between different mt minichromosomes in P. humanus. It is not known, however, how these minichromosomes recombine. Here, we report the discovery of eight chimeric mt minichromosomes in P. humanus. We classify these chimeric mt minichromosomes into two groups: Group I and Group II. Group I chimeric minichromosomes contain parts of two different protein-coding genes that are from different minichromosomes. The two parts of protein-coding genes in each Group I chimeric minichromosome are joined at a microhomologous nucleotide sequence; microhomologous nucleotide sequences are hallmarks of non-homologous recombination. Group II chimeric minichromosomes contain all of the genes and the non-coding regions of two different minichromosomes. The conserved sequence blocks in the non-coding regions of Group II chimeric minichromosomes resemble the "recombination repeats" in the non-coding regions of the mt genomes of higher plants. These repeats are essential to homologous recombination in higher plants. Our analyses of the nucleotide sequences of chimeric mt minichromosomes indicate both homologous and non-homologous recombination between minichromosomes in the mitochondria of the human body louse.

Undoped film was oriented along the < 0 k 0 > direction. The texture coefficient value of the undoped film was higher for the (0 2 0) plane compared to other planes of undoped and 'Li' doped films. The 100% peak (0 2 1) plane of orthorhombic MoO3 and hexagonal phase were induced upon doping with 'Li'. The crystallite size of the undoped film is less compared to the 'Li' doped films. The intense Raman peak at 996 cm(-1) is due to the terminal oxygen (Mo6+ = O stretching mode) in the orthorhombic alpha-MoO3 phase. The characteristic Mo 3d(5/2) and 3d(3/2) doublet caused by spin-orbit coupling are clearly resolved with a splitting of 3.1 eV in the XPS spectra. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) image shows a change in the microstructure, consistent with the change from alpha-MoO3 to mixed alpha and hexagonal phases. Sprout like features were observed in SEM image and rod like features in atomic force microscope (AFM) images. Both direct and indirect band gap showed red shift upon doping with 'Li' compared to undoped film as estimated from the transmittance spectra. Intensity of the green photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra was found to quench with 'Li' concentration. Cyclic voltammetry result shows that the presence of mixed phases in 'Li' doped films decreases the electrochemical performance. Transport study reveals that the carrier concentration and mobility of the 'Li' doped films are lower compared to the undoped film which is due to the evolution of hexagonal phase upon doping with 'Li'. A dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) was fabricated using undoped MoO3 film as photoanode and its efficiency is calculated. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

When the salt treatment was done in the presence of a high concentration (5 mM) of the chelator [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)] tetraacetic acid (EGTA), a modified dark-stable multiline signal was observed from the S-2 State and a 13 mT wide S-3 signal could be generated by illumination at 0 degrees C as reported previously for experiments conducted under these conditions [Boussac, A., Zimmermann, J.-L., & Rutherford, A. W. (1990) FEBS Lett. 277, 69-74]. The modified St multiline signal was lost after a further Cl- depletion in the presence of a low EGTA concentration (50 mu M). Upon Cl- reconstitution, a normal S-2 multiline signal could be generated by continuous illumination at 200 K. In contrast, a lowering of the EGTA concentration (50 mu M) alone, in the presence of Cl- (30 mM), had no effect on the modified S-2 multiline signal. These results indicate that the modification of St is due to binding of the chelator to PS-II and that Cl- stabilizes the chelator binding. When Cl- depletion in Ca2+-depleted PS-II was done in the presence of a high concentration of EGTA (5 mM), the modified S-2 multiline signal disappeared but was regenerated by Cl- reconstitution in darkness. These results indicate that when Cl- depletion is done to the EGTA-modified PS-II, the S-2 multiline signal disappears but the S-2 state remains stable in the dark. Thus, EGTA binding and Cl- depletion appear to be additive phenomena. Cl- depletion also modified the S-3 EPR signal, showing a narrrow signal (<l0 mT) around g = 2. This modification of the S-3 Signal was reversed by Cl- reconstitution, resulting in the reappearance of the 13 mT wide S-3 signal. The modifications of St and Sg due to Cl- depletion observed in Ca2+-depleted membranes are similar to those observed following Cl- depletion in regular PS-II membranes, in which functional Ca2+ is thought to be present. These results, therefore, indicate that the modifications of the S-2 and S-3 EPR signals due to Cl- depletion are independent of Ca2+. Investigations of PS-II membranes which were salt-treated without EGTA revealed that the chemical 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), generally used as a pH buffer, was able to modify the S-2 state, in a similar fashion to EGTA. In consideration of the components that are known to modify S-2 [EGTA, (ethylenedinitrilo)tetraacetic acid (EDTA), citrate, pyrophosphate, and MES), the results indicate that the modification of S-2 is due to binding of these components, by their anionic groups containing oxygen, near to or on the Mn cluster itself. The observed effects of Ca2+ and Cl- depletion in PS-II may be relevant to the proposed role(s) of Ca2+ and Cl- in controlling substrate binding in the functional charge accumulation cycle.									26	0	0	0	21	0	26			0006-2960			WOS:A1994PQ48900008	7947704

SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY				34	9			1227	1234	PII S0038-0717(02)00059-7	10.1016/S0038-0717(02)00059-7				SEP 2002	2002	Respiratory denitrification is controlled by a number of environmental and soil factors including pH, but some of the interactions between pH and denitrification in soil arc still uncertain. The objective of the present study was to assess the relationship between natural soil pH and denitrifying enzyme activity (DEA), to investigate the impact of two different techniques used for determining of potential denitrification, namely short-term DEA and the long-term denitrification potential (DP), on resulting pH optimum, especially with respect to the length of measurement, and to elucidate the effect of soil pH on the nature of denitrification products (N2O, N-2). For this purpose, five mineral soils similar in a texture but differing in pH, were investigated. In addition to examining the soils in their natural pH values, pHs were adjusted by amendment of sulphuric acid or sodium hydroxide solutions prior to DEA or DP determination. The study showed that there was no simple relationship between DEA and soil pH, as very high DEA was found both in acid and alkaline soil. The study also indicated that the populations of soil denitrifiers were adapted to prevailing natural soil pH in the sense that they exhibited the highest IDEA at or near natural soil pH (in experiments where the pH was adjusted to values from about 4 to 11 before DEA determination). Suppression of nitrate reductase activity by introducing nitrite instead of nitrate as an electron acceptor had no effect on this interaction between the DEA and soil pH. If the soil incubation was prolonged under optimum conditions for denitrification (surplus of nitrate or nitrite and available carbon, very low partial pressure of 02) and DP was estimated, the optimum pH for evolution of denitrification products was shifted towards neutrality. It is proposed that this is either due to the development of a community of denitrifiers which can grow better at the neutral pH or due to accommodation of the existing populations to new conditions. The shift in pH optimum occurred after about 12 h, but it took about 1-2 days to fully appear. In agreement with previous studies, it was confirmed that at pH above 7, N2 is much more important denitrification product than N2O. The study also suggests that the expressions like optimum pH for denitrification should be avoided, as different denitrification characteristics obtained using different methodology can be quite differently related to the soil reaction. Such general expression should be specified by introducing the particular denitrification parameters to which it is being applied. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Golding, Amber-Leigh; Dong, Zhongmin								Hydrogen production by nitrogenase as a potential crop rotation benefit								ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS				8	2			101	121		10.1007/s10311-010-0278-y				JUN 2010	2010	Both climate change and the adverse effects of chemical use on human and environmental health are recognized as serious issues of global concern. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the agricultural sector where release of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane continues to be problematic and where use of nitrogen fertilizer is responsible for negative impacts on both human populations and ecosystems. The manipulation of biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) could help alleviate part of the difficulty by decreasing the need for nitrogen fertilizers, which require huge quantities of fossil fuel to produce and contribute to the release of nitrous oxide from soil as well as being responsible for the contamination of drinking water systems and natural habitats. BNF is performed by a variety of microorganisms. One of the most studied examples is the BNF carried out by rhizobial bacteria in symbiosis with their plant hosts such as pea and soybean. Hydrogen gas is an energy-rich, obligate by-product of BNF. Legume symbioses with rhizobia lacking hydrogenase enzymes (which can recycle hydrogen) have traditionally been viewed as energetically inefficient. However, recent studies suggest hydrogen release to soil may be beneficial, increasing soil carbon sequestration and promoting growth of hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria beneficial to plant growth; the alleged superiority of symbiotic performance in rhizobia possessing functional hydrogenases (HUP+) over those rhizobia without functional hydrogenases (HUP-) has also not been conclusively shown. The structure of the iron-molybdenum cofactor or FeMo-co of nitrogenase (the active site of the enzyme) has been elucidated through X-ray crystallography but the mechanism of nitrogen fixation remains unknown. However, studies of effects of hydrogen production on BNF have revealed potential candidate intermediates involved in the nitrogenase reaction pathway and have also shown the role of hydrogen as a competitive inhibitor of N-2, with hydrogen now considered to be the primary regulator of the nitrogenase electron allocation coefficient. The regulation of oxygen levels within legume root nodules is also being investigated; nitrogen fixation is energetically expensive, requiring a plentiful oxygen supply but too high an oxygen concentration can irreversibly damage nitrogenase, so some regulation is needed. There is evidence from gas diffusion studies suggesting the presence of a diffusion barrier in nodules; leghaemoglobin is another potential O-2 regulator. Possible functions of hydrogenases include hydrogen recycling, protection of nitrogenase from damaging O-2 levels and prevention of inhibitory H-2 accumulation; there is evidence for H-2 recycling only in studies where H-2 uptake has been strongly coupled to ATP production and where this is not the case, it is believed that the hydrogenase acts as an O-2 scavenger, lowering O-2 concentrations. The distribution of hydrogenases in temperate legumes has been found to be narrow and root and shoot grafting experiments suggest the host plant may exert some influence on the expression of hydrogenase (HUP) genes in rhizobia that possess them.Many still believe that HUP+ rhizobia are superior in performance to HUP- species; to this end, many attempts to increase the relative efficiency of nitrogenase through the introduction of HUP genes into the plasmids or chromosomes of HUP- rhizobia have been carred out and some have met with success but many other studies have not revealed an increase in symbiotic performance after successful insertion of HUP genes so the role of HUP in increasing parameters such as N-2 fixation and plant yield is still unclear. One advantage of the hydrogen production innate to BNF is that the H-2 evolved can be used to measure N-2 fixation using new open-flow gas chamber techniques seen as superior to the traditional acetylene reduction assay (ARA) conducted in closed chambers, although H-2 cannot be used for field studies yet as the ARA can. However, the ARA is now believed to be unreliable in field studies and it is recommended that other measures such as dry weight, yield and total nitrogen content are more accurate, especially in determining real food production, particularly in the developing nations. Another potential benefit of H-2 release from root nodules is that it stays in the soil and has been found to be consumed by H-2-oxidizing bacteria, many of which show plant growth-promoting properties such as the inhibition of ethylene biosynthesis in the host plant, leading to root elongation and increased plant growth; they may well be promising as biofertilizers if they can be successfully developed into seed inoculants for non-leguminous crop species, decreasing the need for chemical fertilizers. It has been suggested that rhizobia can produce nitrous oxide through denitrification but this has never been shown; it is possible that hydrogen release may provide more ideal conditions for denitrifying, free-living bacteria and so increase production of nitrous oxide that way and this issue will require more study. However, it seems unlikely that a natural system would release nitrous oxide to the same degree that chemical fertilizers have been shown to do.									26	4	0	0	21	0	30			1610-3653	1610-3661		WOS:000277786900001

High-surface-area zirconias are widely used as catalytic support of noble metals in automotive three-way catalytic converters for exhaust gas treatment. Doping these oxides with rare-earth elements provides an important means in tailoring their properties for better catalytic performance. We have carried out in situ small-to-wide angle neutron diffraction at high temperatures and under controlled atmospheres to study the sintering behavior and the Ce3+ <-> ce(4+) redox process in CexZr1-xO2-delta solid solutions dispersed with Pt nanoparticles. We found substantial effects due to RE-doping on the nature of aggregation of nanoparticles, defect formation, crystal phase transformation, and metal-support interaction. Y-doped BaCe3 exhibits significant proton conductivity under a hydrogen-containing atmosphere at high temperatures. This system has high potential for applications as fuel-cell electrolytes, gas sensors, and ceramic membranes for hydrogen separation. We have performed in situ neutron diffraction to obtain information regarding the crystal phase evolution that permits dissolution of hydrogen and proton migration through the lattice. Neutron quasielastic- and inelastic-scattering experiments were carried out to investigate the proton dynamics from local vibrations to long-range diffusion. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we fabricated mixed Ni-Co phosphides (Ni1-xCox-P) as bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting. Structural characterizations indicated that the Ni1-xCox-P catalysts (0 > x > 1) exhibited hierarchical yolk-shelled morphologies, with a total diameter of 1-2 mu m. Interestingly, the shell was assembled by numerous nanosheets with a thickness less than 10 nm. The electrochemical measurements indicated that the Ni1-xCox-P catalysts (0 < x < 1) showed significantly enhanced OER and HER activities in comparison to the pure Ni-P and Co-P catalysts, and the highest OER and HER activities were achieved as x = 0.31. To drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the Ni0.69Co0.31-P catalyst required an overpotential of 266 mV for OER and 96 mV for HER, respectively. The alkaline water electrolyzer with the Ni0.69Co0.31-P catalysts as the cathode and anode catalysts required a cell voltage of ca. 1.59 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which was comparable to the integrated performance of commercial Pt/C and IrO2. Furthermore, the electrolyzer assembled by the bufictional electrocatalysts showed a more stable performance than one assembled by commercial Pt/C and IrO2 operated at the simialr current density. The superior activity and long-term stability demonstrate that the hierarchical mixed Ni-Co phosphides have promising potential for application in large-scale water splitting.									124	8	0	0	4	0	128			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000387859800037	27824193

Shell portions classified as non-luminescent (NL) and non-luminescent to slightly luminescent (NL-SL) present geochemical signatures within the ranges considered normal for Recent brachiopods that have not undergone significant diagenetic modification. These include low to undetectable Fe and Mn contents, high Sr values, and delta O-18 values similar to those of carbonates in equilibrium with seawater. On the other hand, valve areas that are luminescent (L) or moderately luminescent with luminescent portions (ML-L) present higher Fe and Mn contents, lower Sr concentrations, and lower delta O-18 values than those corresponding to NL and NL-SL shells. This suggests a greater diagenetic alteration of these portions and that they acted as microzones of reaction with the diagenetic fluids.Temporal trends through the studied interval show a spread in delta C-13 values much lower than that observed for contemporaneous samples (up to 1.6%.), thus obscuring the delta C-13 global signal at the time-scale resolution of this study. In contrast, the delta O-18 record of brachiopod calcite (delta O-18(c)) shows an overall increase of similar to 1 parts per thousand (relative to V-PDB) from the oldest to the youngest samples. This is accompanied by a similar to 30% decrease in Mg/Ca ratios of the brachiopod calcites, confirming that at least part of this shift in delta O-18(c) was related to cooling. Combination of Mg/Ca and delta O-18(c) proxies established in this paper, although not full-proof for brachiopods yet allowed for the calculation of a temperature drop of similar to 3.3 degrees C and a change in seawater delta O-18(w) that becomes similar to 0.4 parts per thousand more positive during this interval. The data are consistent with regional seawater cooling that accompanied an increase in continental ice volume, over a relatively short time period of <4 Myr. Comparison of the Carboniferous isotopic data from Spain with data compiled from Palaeotethyan basins suggests that this positive event in delta O-18(c) during the Brigantian (latest Visean) may be correlated worldwide. This synchronous global shift provides evidence for the onset of the Carboniferous glaciation in Gondwana during the Brigantian. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, FmRAP2.12 gene was isolated and characterized from Fraxinus mandshurica Rupr. The open reading frame (ORF) of FmRAP2.12 was 1170bp and encoded a protein of 389 amino acids. The conserved domains, three-dimensional phylogenetic relationship of FmRAP2.12 was also investigated. Quantitative real-time (qRT-PCR) analyzed the expression of FmRAP2.12 in different tissues. The expression level of FmRAP2.12 was highest in roots followed by leaves, and lowest in male flowers. Abiotic stress and hormone signal-induced expression was established using qRT-PCR. Salt stress induced FmRAP2.12 to a double peak pattern: the first peak value was at 6h and the second at 72h. Drought stress also induced FmRAP2.12 to a double peak pattern: the first at 6h and the second at 48h. FmRAP2.12 was up-regulated after initiation of gibberellic acid (GA3) treatment, with a one peak pattern at 24h. FmRAP2.12 may not respond to cold stress and Abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. The transient overexpression of FmRAP2.12 caused the up-expression of downstream key genes of abiotic stress response and gibberellin pathway. Our research reveals the molecular characteristic and expression patterns under abiotic stress and hormone condition of FmRAP2.12, providing support for the genetic improvement of F. mandshurica at a molecular level.									2	3	0	0	2	0	5			1007-662X	1993-0607		WOS:000474421600013

Early diagnosis of COVID-19 is the most critical step to treat infection. The diagnostic tools are generally molecular methods, serology and viral culture. Recently CRISPR-based method has been investigated to diagnose and treat coronavirus infection. The emergence of 2019-nCoV during the influenza season, has led to the extensive use of antibiotics and neuraminidase enzyme inhibitors, taken orally and intravenously.Currently, antiviral inhibitors of SARS and MERS spike proteins, neuraminidase inhibitors, anti-inflammatory drugs and EK1 peptide are the available therapeutic options for SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. In addition, Chloroquine, which was previously used for malarial and autoimmune disease, has shown efficacy in the 2019-nCoV infection treatment. In severe hypoxaemia, a combination of antibiotics, alpha-interferon, lopinavir and mechanical ventilation can effectively mitigate the symptoms. Comprehensive knowledge on the innate and adaptive immune responses, will make it possible to propose potent antiviral drugs with their effective therapeutic measures for the prevention of viral infection. This therapeutic strategy will help patients worldwide to protect themselves against severe and fatal viral infections, that potentially can evolve and develop drug resistance, and to reduce mortality rates.									62	0	2	0	23	0	65			0042-6822	1089-862X		WOS:000591845000001	33010669

SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT				619				144	154		10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.11.022				APR 1 2018	2018	Monitoring of macroinvertebrate communities is frequently used to define the ecological health status of rivers. Ideally, biomonitoring should also give an indication on the major stressors acting on the macroinvertebrate communities supporting the selection of appropriate management measures. However, most indices are affected by more than one stressor. Biological traits (e.g. size, generation time, reproduction) could potentially lead to more stressor-specific indices. However, such an approach has rarely been tested.In this study we classify 324 macroinvertebrate taxa as vulnerable (decreasing abundances) or tolerant (increasing abundances) along 21 environmental gradients (i.e. nutrients, major ions, oxygen and micropollutants) from 422 monitoring sites in Germany using Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN). Subsequently, we investigate which biological traits and taxonomic groups are associated with taxa classified as vulnerable or tolerant with regard to specific gradients. The response of most taxa towards different gradients was similar and especially high for correlated gradients.Traits associated with vulnerable taxa across most gradients included: larval aquatic life stages, isolated cemented eggs, reproductive cycle per year <1, scrapers, aerial and aquatic active dispersal and plastron respiration. Traits associated with tolerant taxa included: adult aquatic life stages, polyvoltinism, ovoviviparity or egg clutches in vegetation, food preference for dead animals or living microinvertebrates, substrate preference for macrophytes, microphytes, silt or mud and a body size >2-4 cm.Our results question whether stressor-specific indices based on macroinvertebrate assemblages can be achieved using single traits, because we observed that similar taxa responded to different gradients and also similar traits were associated with vulnerable and tolerant taxa across a variety of water quality gradients.

In this study, an extracellular copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (ecCuZnSOD) gene and a mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase (mtMnSOD) gene were cloned from hemocytes of the freshwater crayfish, Procambarus clarkii. The open reading frame (ORF) of ecCuZnSOD is 612 bp encoding a 204 amino acid (aa) protein with a 24 aa signal peptide, whereas the ORF of mtMnSOD is 654 bp and encodes a 218 aa protein with a 20 aa mitochondrial-targeting sequence in the N-terminus. P. clarkii ecCuZnSOD and mtMnSOD proteins showed high similarity with ecCuZnSODs and mtMnSODs from other crustaceans, respectively. Both ecCuZnSOD and mtMnSOD of P. clarkii were highly expressed in hepatopancreas, hemocytes and gill; lower expression levels were seen in intestine, stomach, nerve, heart and muscle. The mRNA expressions of three SODs of P. clarkii (ecCuZnSOD, mtMnSOD and cytosolic MnSOD (cytMnSOD)) were studied after Spiroplasma eriocheiris and Aeromonas hydrophila stimulations. After S. eriocheiris challenge, the mRNAs of three SODs in hemocytes and gill were up-regulated, and ecCuZnSOD also increased in the hepatopancreas. However, the mtMnSOD and cytosolic MnSOD in the hepatopancreas were down-regulated. After A. hydrophila challenge, the mRNA expressions of three SODs in hepatopancreas and hemocytes were up-regulated and down-regulated in gill. The total SOD activity and CuZnSOD activity were increased compared to the control group with both S. eriocheiris and A. hydrophila challenges. The results may indicate that the SODs of P. clarkii have important roles in innate immune responses against S. eriocheiris and A. hydrophila.

In this study, a glutaredoxin domain-containing cysteine rich gene from Helicoverpa armigera, named HaGdccr, was characterized. Sequence analysis revealed that it contains a glutaredoxin domain and a conserved cysteine and shares high sequence identity with other insect genes. HaGdccr mRNA expression was highest in molting larvae of the 3rd instar and was mainly detected in the central nervous system of larvae and the wings of adults. Quantitative real-time PCR results revealed that the expression of HaGdccr was suppressed at 1 and 6 h and increased at 24 h after the larvae were treated with 4 degrees C and hydrogen peroxide When the larvae were exposed to 20 degrees C, HaGdccr decreased at 1 h and was induced at 12 and 24 h HaGdccr transcription level was downregulated at 2 and 12 h and upregulated at 24 h after the adults were exposed to 0 degrees C However, transcript levels were increased by high temperature in both larvae and adults After knockdown of HaGdccr by RNA interference, the expression of antioxidant genes, including thioredoxin-hke (Trx like), catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), and thioredoxin (Trx), was increased, whereas that of thioredoxin peroxidase (Tpx) was decreased In addition, we found that HaGdccr knockdown enhanced the enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase and the contents of hydrogen peroxide and ascorbate Taken together, these results indicate that HaGdccr may play significant roles in protecting organisms against oxidative damage.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			0022-1910	1879-1611		WOS:000432616900002	29066324

PEERJ				7						e7791	10.7717/peerj.7791				NOV 29 2019	2019	Background: Plant cell metabolism inevitably forms reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can damage cells or lead to their death. The antioxidant system (AOS) evolved to eliminate a high concentration of ROS. For plants, this system consists of the seven classes of antioxidant enzymes and antioxidant compounds. Each enzymatic class contains a various number of genes which may vary from species to species. In such a multi-copy genetic system, the integration of evolutionary characteristics and expression data makes it possible to effectively predict promising breeding targets for the design of highly-yielding cultivars. In the plant cells, ROS production can increase as a result of abiotic stresses. Accordingly, AOS responds to stress by altering the expression of the genes of its components. Expression profiles of AOS enzymes, including their changes under stress, remains incomplete. A comprehensive study of the system behavior in response to stress for different species gives the key to identify the general mechanisms of AOS regulation. In this article, we studied stress-induced changes in the expression of AOS genes in photosynthetic tissues for rice and bread wheat.Methods: A meta-analysis of genome-wide transcriptome data on stress-induced changes in expression profiles of antioxidant genes using microarray and next generation sequencing (NGS) experiments from the GEO NCBI database for rice and bread wheat was carried out. Experimental study of expression changes in short (6 h) and prolonged (24 h) cold stress responses for selected AOS genes of bread wheat cultivars Saratovskaya29 and Yanetzkis Probat was conducted using qPCR.Results: The large-scale meta-transcriptome and complementary experimental analysis revealed a summary of fold changes in the AOS gene expression in response to cold and water deficiency for rice and bread wheat.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			2167-8359			WOS:000499696500001	31803533

ZnO-graphene nanosheet hybrid photoanodes with varying graphite contents were utilized for studying photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. The Raman spectra revealed the direct transformation of micro-sized graphite powder to graphene nanosheets in all hybrid photoanodes after the deposition process, without any post-treatment. Surface morphology analysis revealed the fragmentation of the micro-sized flake morphology to morphology composed of mixed nanorods and nanosheets. The optical properties of the ZnO-graphene nanocomposites were investigated by the diffuse reflectance and photoluminescence (PL) emission spectroscopy, which revealed the decrease of the optical band gap and quenching of PL intensity. The hybrid photoanode with 50 wt% graphite content revealed the smallest bandgap of 2.6 eV and the lowest emission intensity compared with other hybrid photoanodes, which demonstrated the inhibition of photogenerated charge carrier recombination rate as well as an improvement in the visible-light-harvesting. The PEC results exhibited an improvement of the photocurrent with the incorporation of graphene nanosheets due to the improved photogenerated charge transfer kinetics and separation. The hybrid photoanode with 50 wt% graphite content revealed the highest photo-response current of 4.82 mA.cm(-2) corresponds to photoconversion efficiency of 3.25% @1.23 V vs. RHE.

However, efficient and cost-effective cathode, working at ambient conditions and neutral pH, are required to make the MEC as a sustainable technology. In this study, MEC with electrodeposited cathodes (co-deposits of Ni, Ni-Co and Ni-Co-P) were utilized to evaluate the treatment efficiency and hydrogen recovery of sugar industry wastewater. MECs operation was carried out at 30 +/- 2 degrees C temperature in batch mode at an applied voltage of 0.6 V in neutral pH with sugar industry effluent (COD 4850 +/- 50 mg L-1, BOD 1950 +/- 20 mg L-1) and activated sludge as a source of microorganism. The Ni-Co-P electrodeposit on both cases achieved the maximum H-2 production rate of 0.24 +/- 0.005 m(3)(H2) m(-3) d(-1) and 0.21 +/- 0.005 m(3)(H2) m(-3) d(-1) with similar to 50 % treatment efficiency for a 500 ml effluent in 7 days' batch cycles. It was also found that fabricated cathodes can treat real wastewater efficiently with considerable energy recovery than previously reported literature. This study showed the potentiality of the real-time industrial effluents treatment and biohydrogen production near to ambient atmospheric conditions that emphasizes the waste to energy bio-electrochemical system.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0045-6535	1879-1298		WOS:000704870800003	34416586

At present, the sluggish kinetics of the separation and migration of the photo-excited electrons and holes for water oxidation is the bottleneck for the high solar-to-hydrogen efficiency in this field. Herein, we exploit cobalt polyoxometalate (CoPOM) as a novel molecular cocatalyst locating at N-doped carbon (N/C) to boost the charge separation and injection of BiVO4 photoanodes for PEC water oxidation. Comprehensive results reveal that the uniformly distributed CoPOM specially improves the hole injection efficiency, leading to the lower onset potential of water oxidation and confirming the improved the kinetics of BiVO4 photoanode for PEC water splitting. A high maximum applied bias photon-to-current efficiency of 1.22% is achieved at a low potential of 0.63 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for BiVO4 -N/C-CoPOM, and the photocurrent density of increases up to 1.93 mA cm(-2) at 0.63 V vs. RHE and 3.30 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which are 11.4 and 5.4 times higher than that of the pristine BiVO4, respectively. Particularly, the significantly improved PEC performance in the low bias range indicates CoPOM can effectively reduce the water oxidation energy barrier. We believe this research provides a novel molecular cocatalyst of POM for the improvement of PEC performance of photoanode, and expands the scope for the design of efficient cocatalysts for solar energy-conversion devices.									33	1	0	0	4	0	33			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000525862500102

Using X-ray fluorescence, emission spectral and X-ray powder diffraction analyses, the interphase distribution of elements is estimated during high-temperature (550 C) electrochemical treatment of lead-bismuth alloys in molten NaCl-KCl-PbCl2 -ZnCl2 . Regimes of the two-stage process are substantiated when in the first stage (U = 7.4-15.6 V, i(a) = 0.5 A/cm(2) ) the bismuth content in anode alloy is brought to 48.4 wt.% and then (U = 4.9-13.5 V, i(a) = 0.3-0.4 A/cm(2) ) crude bismuth is separated containing, wt.%: 93.6 Bi, 4.1 Pb, 0.086 Ag, 0.0066 As, 0.006 Sb, 0.0013 Cu, 0.001 Sn, and 0.0014 Zn. The final anode product contains 93% bismuth and 0.4% lead from the original alloy. Crude lead obtained at the cathode contains, wt.%: 95.8-96.3 Pb, 0.007-0.06 Bi, 0.002-2.9 Na, 1.2-3.6 Zn, and <= 0.1 Cu. Sublimation of chlorides saturated with lead and action of oxygen from the air are the reasons for heterogenization of the electrolyte that gives rise to an increase in working voltage in the electrolytic cell. The relatively low anodic and cathodic current efficiency (50 and 38% respectively) are associated with electrical recharging of polyvalent ions on electrodes. Use of technology for treating intermediate products and waste refining will make it possible to organize production of crude bismuth from mineral and secondary lead-containing raw materials. Prospects for improving the efficiency of the process are associated with the sealing of electrolyzers and preliminary pyrometallurgical refining of lead-bismuth alloys from impurities (Cu, Zn, Sb, As, and Sn).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0026-0894	1573-8892		WOS:000515806500001

So far, animal models dealt with the acute impact of MV on immature lungs, but less with its delayed effects. We used a newborn rodent model including non-surgical and therefore reversible intubation with moderate ventilation and hypothesized that there might be distinct gene expression patterns after a ventilation-free recovery period compared to acute effects directly after MV. Newborn rat pups were subjected to 8?hr of MV with 60% oxygen (O2), 24?hr after injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), intended to create a low inflammatory background as often recognized in preterm infants. Animals were separated in controls (CTRL), LPS injection (LPS), or full intervention with LPS and MV with 60% O2 (LPS?+?MV?+?O2). Lungs were recovered either directly following (T:0?hr) or 48?hr after MV (T:48?hr). Histologically, signs of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) were observed in LPS?+?MV?+?O2 lungs at T:0?hr, while changes appeared similar to those known from patients with chronic lung disease (CLD) with fewer albeit larger gas exchange units, at T:48?hr. At T:0?hr, LPS?+?MV?+?O2 increased gene expression of pro-inflammatory MIP-2. In parallel anti-inflammatory IL-1Ra gene expression was increased in LPS and LPS?+?MV?+?O2 groups. At T:48?hr, pro- and anti-inflammatory genes had returned to their basal expression. MMP-2 gene expression was decreased in LPS and LPS?+?MV?+?O2 groups at T:0?hr, but no longer at T:48?hr. MMP-9 gene expression levels were unchanged directly after MV. However, at T:48?hr, gene and protein expression increased in LPS?+?MV?+?O2 group. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the feasibility of delayed outcome measurements after a ventilation-free period in newborn rats and may help to further understand the time-course of molecular changes following MV. The differences obtained from the two time points could be interpreted as an initial transitory increase of inflammation and a delayed impact of the intervention on structure-related genes.

The photoelectrochemical characteristics of tungsten trioxide (WO3) and bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) have been studied, comparing the single-phase materials with two heterojunction systems based on a WO3 underlayer and a thin, spin-coated BiVO4 top layer, using two types of underlayer: (i) a nanorod-based WO3 substrate prepared by hydrothermal methods (nr-WO3/BiVO4); and (ii) a spin-coated thin, compact WO3 substrate (pl-WO3/BiVO4). Intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) was used to determine the charge separation efficiency, internal and external quantum efficiencies, and process time constants for the four systems in a phosphate buffer at pH 7, both without and with an added hole scavenger, Na2SO3. The heterojunction systems show excellent performance, which is ascribed to the superior capability of WO3 to extract photogenerated electrons from the BiVO4 film that acts as the main absorber. IMPS convincingly shows that the heterojunction configuration prevents surface recombination at the BiVO4/electrolyte interface, as well as the detrimental surface modification generally observed for WO3 photoelectrodes. The improved electron transport properties of the nr-WO3 substrate and the large area of the heterojunction interface result in better performance for nr-WO3/BiVO4, where at 455 nm water photo-oxidation is quantitative. For the single-phase BiVO4 photoelectrodes, an interesting photocurrent switching phenomenon is observed in the presence of the hole scavenger, indicating the intricate interplay between electron trapping and hole charge transfer; this phenomenon is prevented by the heterojunction structure because of the rapid electron extraction by WO3. These results show that IMPS gives detailed information on the reasons for the excellent performance of heterojunction systems, providing opportunities to design new, more efficient solar water splitting systems.

The CAT cDNA of Eriocheir sinensis (EsCAT) was cloned via RACE technique. The complete sequence of EsCAT cDNA consisted of a 5 untranslated regions (UTR) of 224bp, a 3 UTR of 1287bp with a poly (A) tail and an open reading frame (ORF) of 1542bp, which encoded a polypeptide of 513 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of approximately 58.86kDa and a theoretical isoelectric point of 6.880. The deduced amino acid sequence of EsCAT contained a highly conserved proximal active-site signature motif (60FDRERIPERVVHAKGAL76) and a proximal hemeligand signature motif (350RLFSYNDTH358) and exhibited high similarity with other reported CATs. In the phylogenetic tree, EsCAT was clustered with the CATs from Scylla serrata and Portunus trituberculatus. The EsCAT transcripts were constitutively expressed in haepatopancreas, haemocytes, gill, gonad, muscle and heart, with highest expression level in haepatopancreas. The relative expression level of EsCAT mRNA in haemocytes was continuously up-regulated and reached the peak level at 48h post-Vibrio anguillarum challenge. The purified recombinant EsCAT protein displayed antioxidant activity against hydrogen peroxide with high thermal stability and broad spectrum of pH values. All these results demonstrated that EsCAT was an efficient antioxidant enzyme and potentially involved in the regulation of redox and innate immune response of crabs.									21	2	0	0	18	0	22			1744-3121	1744-313X		WOS:000318810200010	23171400

Based on isoelectric point shift, 4-10 and 10-14 amino groups were modified in the presence of 2 and 4 mM NSP, respectively. Similarly, 3-4 carboxyl groups were modified by reaction with 100 mM GME. Neutralization of negatively charged carboxyl groups with GME did not alter the binding activity of the extrinsic 18 kDa protein. However, the NSP-modified 18 kDa protein, in which the positively charged amino groups had been modified to uncharged methyl esters, failed to bind with the PSII membrane in the presence of the extrinsic 23 kDa protein. This defect can not be attributed to structural or conformational alterations imposed by chemical modification, as the fluorescence and circular dichroism spectra among native, GME-and NSP-modified extrinsic 18 kDa proteins were similar. Thus, we have concluded that the positive charges of lysyl residues in the extrinsic 18 kDa protein are important for its interaction with PSII membranes in the presence of the extrinsic 23 kDa protein. Furthermore, it was found that the negative charges of carboxyl groups of this protein did not participate in binding with the extrinsic 23 kDa protein associated with PSII membranes.									5	2	0	0	4	0	6			1672-9145	1745-7270		WOS:000233539600003	16270152

The western geothermal waters are dominated by Cl-Na-type waters with Br/Cl and Na/Cl values similar to those of seawater. The depleted delta D and delta O-18 compositions and the corrected(14)C(DIC)age suggest that Jimo geothermal waters are mixtures of late Pleistocene to early Holocene and younger meteoric waters. An improved Br/Cl-Na/Cl diagram, ion mass balance calculations and delta B-11 values indicate that halite and K-salt dissolution and subsequent cation exchange formed the dominant Cl-Na center dot Ca-type geothermal water, and this was then modified into a small amount of Cl-Na-type water in the western area by mixing with minor seawater entrapped in the unconsolidated sediments. The(87)Sr/Sr-86 ratios (0.710613-0.710726) of the geothermal waters reflect water-rock reactions in the sandstone. The improved Br/Cl-Na/Cl diagram, Piper plot and boron isotopic dataset containing saline waters from coastal geothermal systems worldwide further confirm that the salinity in the Jimo geothermal water originated from dissolution of marine evaporites.									9	0	0	0	4	0	9			1431-2174	1435-0157		WOS:000542084700002		
J	Ren, Peng; Li, Qinglin; Song, Tao; Yang, Yong					Tao, Song/0000-0003-2088-8177			Facile Fabrication of the Cu-N-C Catalyst with Atomically Dispersed Unsaturated Cu-N2 Active Sites for Highly Efficient and Selective Glaser-Hay Coupling								ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES				12	24			27210	27218		10.1021/acsami.0c05100				JUN 17 2020	2020	M-N-C catalysts have attracted considerable attention in the fields of energy storage and conversion as well as catalysis over the past decades. However, the current synthetic strategies for fabricating M-N-C catalysts via high-temperature pyrolysis unavoidably lead to a structural heterogeneity with the presence of a mixture of species including atomically dispersed M-N-x moieties and inorganic metal-containing partides, which not only decreases the atomic utilization but also clouds the accurate understanding of the nature of the catalytically active sites. Herein, we first report a straightforward and cost-effective preparation strategy for fabricating a Cu-N-C catalyst with atomically dispersed and coordinately unsaturated Cu-N-2 moieties on hierarchically N-doped porous carbon (Cu-1/NC-800) without formation of any metal-containing phases. Cu-1/NC-800 exhibits outstanding catalytic performance for Glaser-Hay coupling of terminal alkynes under mild and sustainable conditions, which surpass those of the state-of-the-art catalysts. A broad set of (un)symmetrical aryl-aryl, aryl-alkyl, and alkyl-alkyl 1,3-diynes were selectively synthesized in high yields with good tolerance of various functional groups. More importantly, the Cu-1/NC-800 could be easily reused with good maintenance of the activity and atomic dispersion of Cu in the structure. Experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the low N coordination number of single-atom Cu sites in Cu-N-2 exhibit a preferential adsorption to terminal alkyne; meanwhile, the adjacent pyridinic N sites on the carbon matrix facilitate the deprotonation of the adsorbed alkyne to generate the key intermediate Cu-delta-acetylide species, thus synergistically boosting the reaction. Therefore, this work not only provides an alternative facile synthetic strategy for fabricating atomically dispersed M-N-C catalysts but also represents a significant advance for accessing (un)symmetrical 1,3-diynes from Glaser-Hay coupling.									24	3	0	0	1	0	25			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000542925300043	32438795

Trials were carried out in discontinuous and in continuous mode, analyzing the influence of electrical and hydraulic process parameters on the quality of treated water. The use of highly boron-doped diamond electrodes in the reactor allowed the electrosynthesis of considerable amounts of ozone. Because of the relatively high amount of chloride in the groundwater samples, a mixture of HOCl/ClO- was also synthesized. Somewhat unexpectedly, the increase in the current density in the explored range 100-1000 A m(-2) was accompanied by an increase in the faradaic yield of the electrosynthesis of oxidants, which was more pronounced for ozone than for free chlorine. As reported in literature, the main radical intermediate in the relevant reactions is center dot OH, which can lead to different oxidation products, namely ozone and HOC1/ ClO-. The electrolytic treatment also caused a decrease in the concentration of minor components, including NH4+ and Br-. Other byproducts were ClO3- and ClO4-, although their concentration levels were low. Moreover, due to alkali formation at the cathode surface, the precipitation of calcium and magnesium carbonates was also observed.In addition, the experimental investigation showed that even Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Legionella could be completely removed in the treated stream, due to the unique capacity of the reactor to synthesize biocidal agents like ozone, HOC1/ClO-, and chloramines. These effects were particularly evident during batch experiments. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The decision to include certain discoveries while omitting others has been difficult. We are aware that ours is an incomplete timeline. In part, this is because the function of this list is to complement, not duplicate, the listing of discoveries in the other papers in these history issues of Photosynthesis Research. In addition, no one can know everything that is in the extensive literature in the field. Furthermore, any judgement about significance presupposes a point of view. This history begins with the observation of the English clergyman Stephen Hales (1677-1761) that plants derive nourishment from the air; it includes the definitive experiments in the 1960-1965 period establishing the two-photosystem and two-light reaction scheme of oxygenic photosynthesis; and includes the near-atomic resolution of the structures of the reaction centers of these two Photosystems, I and II, obtained in 2001-2002 by a team in Berlin, Germany, coordinated by Horst Witt and Wolfgang Saenger. Readers are directed to historical papers in Govindjee and Gest [(2002a) Photosynth Res 73: 1-308], in Govindjee, J. Thomas Beatty and Howard Gest [(2003a) Photosynth Res 76: 1-462], and to other papers in this issue for a more complete picture. Several photographs are provided here. Their selection is based partly on their availability to the authors ( see Figures 1-15).

We present a geochemical dataset of flowback and produced water samples from a hydraulically fractured reservoir in the Montney Formation, Canada, analyzed for major and trace elements and stable isotopes. The dataset consists in 25 samples of flowback and produced waters from a single well, as well as produced water samples from 16 other different producing wells collected in the same field. Additionally, persulfate breaker samples as well as an hydrite and pyrite from cores were also analyzed. The objectives of this study were to understand the geochemical interactions between formation and fracturing fluids and their consequences in the context of tight gas exploitation. The analysis of this dataset allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the coupled downhole geochemical processes, linked in particular to the action of the oxidative breaker. Flowback fluid chemistries were determined to be the result of mixing of formation brine with the hydraulic fracturing fluids as well as coupled geochemical reactions with the reservoir rock such as dissolution of an hydrite and dolomite; pyrite and organic matter oxidation; and calcite, barite, celestite, iron oxides and possibly calcium sulfate scaling. In particular, excess sulfate in the collected samples was found to be mainly derived from an hydrite dissolution, and not from persulfate breaker or pyrite oxidation. The release of heavy metals from the oxidation activity of the breaker was detectable but concentrations of heavy metals in produced fluids remained below the World Health Organization guidelines for drinking water and are therefore of no concern. This is due in part to the co-precipitation of heavy metals with iron oxides and possibly sulfate minerals. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

J	Grabolle, Markus; Dau, Holger					Dau, Holger/0000-0001-6482-7494			Efficiency and role of loss processes in light-driven water oxidation by PSII								PHYSIOLOGIA PLANTARUM				131	1			50	63		10.1111/j.1399-3054.2007.00941.x				SEP 2007	2007	Its superior quantum efficiency renders PSII a model for biomimetic systems. However, also in biological water oxidation by PSII, the efficiency is restricted by recombination losses. By laser-flash illumination, the secondary radical pair, P680(+)Q(A)(-) (where P680 is the primary Chl donor in PSII and Q(A), primary quinone acceptor of PSII), was formed in close to 100% of the PSII. Investigation of the quantum efficiency (or yield) of the subsequent steps by time-resolved delayed (10 mu s to 60 ms) and prompt (70 mu s to 700 ms) Chi fluorescence measurements on PSII membrane particles suggests that (1) the effective rate for P680(+) Q(A)(-) recombination is approximately 5 ms(-1) with an activation energy of approximately 0.34 eV, circumstantially confirming dominating losses by reformation of the primary radical pair followed by ground-state recombination. (2) Because of compensatory influences on recombination and forward reactions, the efficiency is only weakly temperature dependent. (3) Recombination losses are several-fold enhanced at lower pH. (4) Calculation based on delayed-fluorescence data suggests that the losses depend on the state of the water-oxidizing manganese complex, being low in the S-0 -> S-1 and S-1 -> S-2 transition, clearly higher in S-2 -> S-3 and S-3 -> S-4 double right arrow S-0. (5) For the used artificial electron acceptor, the efficiency is limited by acceptor-side processes/S-state decay at high/low photon-absorption rates resulting in optimal efficiency at surprisingly low rates of approximately 0.15-15 photons s(-1) (per PSII). The pH and S-state dependence can be rationalized by the basic model of alternate electron-proton removal proposed elsewhere. A physiological function of the recombination losses could be limitation of the lifetime of the reactive donorside tyrosine radical (Y-z(-)) in the case of low-pH blockage of water oxidation.									20	0	0	0	14	0	20			0031-9317	1399-3054		WOS:000249100800006	18251924

(ASG-IV, (Fig. 1) is the most active component of Chinese sp. Astragalus membranaceus Bunge (Fabaceae) that has showed antioxidant, antiapoptotic and antiviral activities among others. It is reported to play an important role in cardiac fibrosis (CF), but the mechanism remains unclear.Purpose: To investigate the mechanism of ASG-IV on inhibiting myocardial fibrosis induced by hypoxia.Study design: We studied the relationship between anti-fibrotic effect of ASG-IV and transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 7 (TRPM7) by in vivo and in vitro experiments.Methods: In vivo, CF was induced by subcutaneous isoproterenol (ISO) for 10 days. Rat hearts were resected for histological experiment and reverse transcription real-time quantitative poly merase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). In vitro, molecular and cellular biology technologies were used to confirm the anti-fibrosis effect underlying mechanism of ASG-IV.Results: Histological findings and the collagen volume fraction showed that ASG-IV decreased fibrosis in heart tissues. Hypoxia could stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of cardiac fibroblast which indicated that the degree of fibrosis was increased significantly. Anoxic treatment could also obviously up-regulate the expression of TRPM7 protein and current. ASG-IV groups showed the opposite results. Knock-down TRPM7 experiment further confirmed the role of TRPM7 channel in hypoxia-induced cardiac fibrosis.Conclusion: Our results suggest that the inhibition of hypoxia-induced CF in vivo and in vitro by ASG-IV is associated with reduction of the expression of TRPM7. The moderate inhibition of the TRPM7 channel may be a new strategy for treating cardiac fibrosis.									22	0	0	0	16	0	22			0944-7113			WOS:000402491000002	28545665	
J	Ma, Yanxia; Fo, Yumeng; Wang, Miaomiao; Liang, Xixi; Dong, Hao; Zhou, Xin								Exploring the mechanism of Ta3N5/KTaO3 photocatalyst for overall water splitting by first-principles calculations								JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY				56				353	364		10.1016/j.jechem.2020.07.058				MAY 2021	2021	The rational fabrication of heterostructures is one of efficient strategies for improving photocatalytic performance of semiconductor photocatalysts. Very recently, Domen and co-workers found that Ta3N5 single crystals grown on the surface of KTaO3 can accomplish photocatalytic overall water splitting for the first time. In order to comprehend the underlying mechanism of this photocatalytic system, we have performed a systematic study based on density functional theory first-principles calculations. Ta3N5(010)/KTaO3(110) slab models have been built according to experimental observations by considering two common terminations of KTaO3(110) surface, named as Ta3N5/O-2 and Ta3N5/KTaO. The formations of interfacial bonds are thermodynamically stable, showing a covalent interaction between two components of a heterostructure. Ta3N5/O-2 has a higher mobility of photogenerated charge carriers and lower recombination rate of charge carriers than Ta3N5/KTaO. The light absorption of heterostructures displays the feature of KTaO3 in the short wavelength region and the characteristic of Ta3N5 in the long wavelength region. The calculated band offsets show that Ta3N5/O-2 and Ta3N5/KTaO have distinct Type-II band alignments, with Ta3N5 as the accumulator of photoinduced electrons in the former and the collector of photogenerated holes in the latter, respectively. The difference in charge density and electrostatic potential between two components acts as a driving force to promote the transfer of electrons and holes to different domains of the interface, which is beneficial to extend the lifetime of photoinduced carriers. Our results demonstrate that the function of Ta3N5 in Ta3N5/KTaO3 photocatalytic system is determined by the termination property of KTaO3(110) surface, which provides a likely reason of the observed photocatalytic activity of overall water splitting achieved by Ta3N5 synthesized by using KTaO3 as a precursor for the nitridation reaction.

Porous electrodes were fabricated from glass-capillary array membranes coated with conformal transparent conductive oxide layers, consisting of either a 40nm-50nm crystalline indium tin oxide or a 100nm-150nm-thick amorphous indium zinc oxide deposited by atomic layer deposition. These porous electrodes solve the problem of insufficient interaction volumes for catalyst thin films in two-dimensional working electrode designs and provide sufficiently low scattering backgrounds to enable high-resolution signal collection from interfacial thin-film catalysts. For example, PDF measurements were readily obtained with 0.2 angstrom spatial resolution for amorphous cobalt oxide films with thicknesses down to 60nm when deposited on a porous electrode with 40 mu m-diameter pores. This level of resolution resolves the cobaltate domain size and structure, the presence of defect sites assigned to the domain edges, and the changes in fine structure upon redox state change that are relevant to quantitative structure-function modeling. The results suggest the opportunity to leverage the porous, electrode architectures for PDF analysis of nanometre-scale surface-supported molecular catalysts. In addition, a compact 3D-printed electrochemical cell in a three-electrode configuration is described which is designed to allow for simultaneous X-ray transmission and electrolyte flow through the porous working electrode.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			0909-0495	1600-5775		WOS:000484666200024	31490150	
J	Grove, GN; Brudvig, GW								Calcium binding studies of photosystem II using a calcium-selective electrode								BIOCHEMISTRY				37	6			1532	1539		10.1021/bi971356z				FEB 10 1998	1998	The identification of Ca2+ as a cofactor in photosynthetic O-2 evolution has encouraged research into the role of Ca2+ in photosystem II (PSII). Previous methods used to identify the number of binding sites and their affinities were nor able to measure Ca2+ binding at thermodynamic equilibrium. We introduce the use of a Ca2+-selective electrode to study equilibrium binding of Ca2+ to PSII. The number and affinities of binding sites were determined via Scatchard analysis on a series of PSII membrane preparations progressively depleted of the extrinsic polypeptides and Mn. Untreated PSII membranes bound approximately 4 Ca2+ per PSII with high affinity (K = 1.8 mu M) and a larger number of Ca2+ with lower affinity, The high-affinity sites are assigned to divalent cation-binding sites on the light-harvesting complex II that are involved in membrane stacking, and the lower-affinity sites are attributed to nonspecific surface-binding sites. These sites were also observed in ail of the extrinsic polypeptide- and Mn-depleted preparations. Depletion of the extrinsic polypeptides and/or Mn exposed additional very high-affinity Ca2+-binding sites which were nor in equilibrium with free Ca2+ in untreated PSII, owing to the diffusion barrier created by the extrinsic polypeptides. Ca2+-depleted PSII membranes lacking the 23 and 17 kDa extrinsic proteins bound an additional 2.5 Ca2+ per PSII with K = 0.15 mu M. This number of very high-affinity Ca2+-binding sites agrees with the previous work of Cheniae and co-workers [Kalosaka, K., et al, (1990) in Current Research in Photosynthesis (Baltscheffsky, M., Ed.) pp 721-724, Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands] whose procedure for Ca2+ depletion was used. Further depletion of the 33 kDa extrinsic protein yielded a sample that bound only 0.7 very high-affinity Ca2+ per PSII with K = 0.19 mu M. The loss of 2 very high-affinity Ca2+-binding sites upon depletion of the 33 kDa extrinsic protein could be due to a structural change of the O-2-evolving complex which lost 2-3 of the 4 Mn ions in this sample, Finally, PSII membranes depleted of Mn and the 33, 23, and 17 kDa extrinsic proteins bound approximately 4 very high-affinity Ca2+ per PSII with K = 0.08 mu M. These sites are assigned to Ca2+ binding to the vacant Mn sites.									34	0	0	0	29	0	35			0006-2960			WOS:000072130500009	9484223

Isotopologue line intensity ratios of circumstellar molecules have been widely used to trace the photospheric elemental isotopic ratios of evolved stars. However, depending on the molecular species and the physical conditions of the environment, the isotopologue ratio in the circumstellar envelope (CSE) may deviate considerably from the stellar atmospheric value.Aims. In this paper, we aim to examine how the (CO)-C-12/(CO)-C-13 and (HCN)-C-12/(HCN)-C-13 abundance ratios vary radially due to chemical reactions in the outflows of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and the effect of excitation and optical depth on the resulting line intensity ratios. We study both carbon-rich (C-type) and oxygen-rich (O-type) CSEs.Methods. We performed chemical modeling to derive radial abundance distributions of our selected species in the CSEs over a wide range of mass-loss rates (10(-8) < M < 10(-4)M(circle dot) yr(-1)). We used these as input in a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer code to derive the line intensities of several ground-state rotational transitions. We also test the influence of stellar parameters, physical conditions in the outflows, the intensity of the interstellar radiation field, and the importance of considering the chemical networks in our model results.Results. We quantified deviations from the atmospheric value for typical outflows. We find that the circumstellar value of (CO)-C-12/(CO)-C-13 can deviate from its atmospheric value by up to 25-94% and 6-60% for C- and O-type CSEs, respectively, in radial ranges that depend on the mass-loss rate. We show that variations of the intensity of the interstellar radiation field and the gas kinetic temperature can significantly influence the CO isotopologue abundance ratio in the outer CSEs of both C-type and O-type. On the contrary, the (HCN)-C-12/(HCN)-C-13 abundance ratio is stable throughout the CSEs for all tested mass-loss rates. The radiative transfer modeling shows that the integrated line intensity ratio (ICO)-C-12/(ICO)-C-13 of different rotational transitions varies significantly for stars with mass-loss rates in the range from 10(-7) to 10(-6)M(circle dot) yr(-1) due to combined chemical and excitation effects. In contrast, the excitation conditions for the HCN isotopologues are the same for both isotopologues.Conclusions. We demonstrate the importance of using the isotopologue abundance profiles from detailed chemical models as inputs to radiative transfer models in the interpretation of isotopologue observations. Previous studies of circumstellar CO isotopologue ratios are based on multi-transition data for individual sources and it is difficult to estimate the errors in the reported values due to assumptions that are not entirely correct according to this study. If anything, previous studies may have overestimated the circumstellar (CO)-C-12/(CO)-C-13 abundance ratio. The use of the HCN molecule as a tracer of C isotope ratios is affected by fewer complicating problems, but we note that the corrections for high optical depths are very large in the case of high-mass-loss-rate C-type CSEs; and in O-type CSEs the (HCN)-C-13 lines may be too weak to detect.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000544026500006

Non-symbiotic Hbs (nsHbs) have been classified into two phylogenetic groups. Class 1 nsHbs show an extremely high O-2 affinity and are induced by hypoxia and nitric oxide ( NO), whereas class 2 nsHbs have moderate O-2 affinity and are induced by cold and cytokinins. The functions of nsHbs are still unclear, but some of them rely on the capacity of hemes to bind diatomic ligands and catalyze the NO dioxygenase (NOD) reaction (oxyferrous Hb + NO -> ferric Hb + nitrate). Moreover, NO may nitrosylate Cys residues of proteins. It is therefore important to determine the ligand binding properties of the hemes and the role of Cys residues. Here, we have addressed these issues with the two class 1 nsHbs (LjGlb1-1 and LjGlb1-2) and the single class 2 nsHb (LjGlb2) of Lotus japonicus, which is a model legume used to facilitate the transfer of genetic and biochemical information into crops. We have employed carbon monoxide (CO) as a model ligand and resonance Raman, laser flash photolysis, and stopped-flow spectroscopies to unveil major differences in the heme environments and ligand binding kinetics of the three proteins, which suggest non-redundant functions. In the deoxyferrous state, LjGlb1-1 is partially hexacoordinate, whereas LjGlb1-2 shows complete hexacoordination (behaving like class 2 nsHbs) and LjGlb2 is mostly pentacoordinate (unlike other class 2 nsHbs). LjGlb1-1 binds CO very strongly by stabilizing it through hydrogen bonding, but LjGlb1-2 and LjGlb2 show lower CO stabilization. The changes in CO stabilization would explain the different affinities of the three proteins for gaseous ligands. These affinities are determined by the dissociation rates and follow the order LjGlb1-1 > LjGlb1-2 > LjGlb2. Mutations LjGlb1-1 C78S and LjGlb1-2 C79S caused important alterations in protein dynamics and stability, indicating a structural role of those Cys residues, whereas mutation LjGlb1-1 C8S had a smaller effect. The three proteins and their mutant derivatives exhibited similarly high rates of NO consumption, which were due to NOD activity of the hemes and not to nitrosylation of Cys residues.									10	0	0	0	6	0	10			1664-462X			WOS:000398178400001	28421084

However, the role of HIF-1 alpha in the teleost immune system remains less known. In this study, we cloned the cDNA sequence of HIF-1 alpha from the ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis, PaHIF-1 alpha). Sequence and phylogenetic tree analysis showed that PaHIF-1 alpha clustered within the fish HIF-1 alpha tree and was closely related to that of Northern pike (Esox Lucius). PaHIF-1 alpha was expressed in all tested tissues and expression increased in liver, head kidney, and body kidney upon Vibrio anguillarum infection. PaHIF-1 alpha was found to regulate the expression of cytokines in ayu monocytes/macrophages (MO/M Phi). PaHIF-1 alpha mediated hypoxia-induced enhancement of MO/M Phi phagocytic and bactericidal activities to enhance host defenses. Compared with the control, intermittent hypoxia further increased the expression of PaHIF-1 alpha mRNA, improved the survival rate, and reduced the bacterial load of V. anguillarum-infected ayu. Therefore, PaHIF-1 alpha may play a predominant role in the modulation of ayu MO/M Phi function.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1096-4959	1879-1107		WOS:000640394300010	33609806

However, construction of robust interfaces and low-crystalline active materials plays a crucial role in realizing the target. In this paper, a one-step phosphorization approach was employed to make low-crystalline Fe2P2O7 nanoplates closely bonded to N/P-co-doped graphene nanotubes (N/P-GNTs@b-Fe2P2O7) through interfacial chemical bonding. The N and P heteroatoms as substitutions for C in GNT skeletons can introduce rich electronic centers, which induces Fe2P2O7 to fix the surface of N/P-GNTs through Fe-N and Fe-P bonds as confirmed by the characterizations. Moreover, the low-crystalline active materials own a disordered internal structure and numerous defects, which not only endows with excellent conductivity but also provides many active sites for redox reactions. Benefiting from the synergistic effects, the prepared N/P-GNTspb-Fe2P2O7 can not only deliver a high capacity of 257 mA h g(-1) (927 F g(-1)) at 1 A g(-1) but also present an excellent rate capability of 184 mA h g(-1) (665 F g(-1)) at 50 A g(-1) and outstanding cycle stability (similar to 90.6% capacity retention over 40,000 cycles). Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled using the obtained N/P-GNTs@b-Fe2P2O7 as electrode materials, which can present the energy density as high as 83.3 W h kg(-1) at 791 W kg(-1) and long-term durability. Therefore, this strategy not only offers an effective pathway for achieving high-performance negative electrode materials but also lays a foundation for further industrialization.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000742106100001	34985247

The enzyme is a new example of intermediate channeling by glutamine amidotransferases in which ammonia generated by hydrolysis of glutamine is channeled to a second active site where it acts as a nucleophile. In this case, ammonia reacts in a cyclase domain to produce imidazole glycerol phosphate and an intermediate of purine biosynthesis. The enzyme is also a potential target for drug and herbicide development since the histidine pathway does not occur in mammals.Results: The 2.1 Angstrom crystal structure of imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase from yeast reveals extensive interaction of the glutaminase and cyclase catalytic do mains. At the domain interface, the glutaminase active site points into the bottom of the (beta/alpha)(8) barrel of the cyclase domain. An ammonia tunnel through the (beta/alpha)(8) barrel connects the glutaminase docking site at the bottom to the cyclase active site at the top. A conserved "gate" of four charged residues controls access to the tunnel.Conclusions: This is the first structure in which all the components of the ubiquitous (beta/alpha)(8) barrel fold, top, bottom, and interior, take part in enzymatic function. Intimate contacts between the barrel domain and the glutaminase active site appear to be poised for crosstalk between catalytic centers in response to substrate binding at the cyclase active site. The structure provides a number of potential sites for inhibitor development in the active sites and in a conserved interdomain cavity.									97	0	0	0	80	0	98			0969-2126	1878-4186		WOS:000171603700012	11591353

The modified multiline EPR signal which forms has been further identified with an S2' oxidation state. The increased number of hyperfine lines (at least 26) and 25% narrower hyperfine splittings from Mn-55 versus the normal S2-state signal indicate a redistribution of spin density, most likely within a spin-coupled tetranuclear Mn cluster. A simpler binuclear Mn description for this signal can be eliminated. Slow conformational changes occur over 30 min which cause subtle changes in the hyperfine structure. Comparison to the modified multiline signals produced by Sr2+ replacement of Ca2+ and NH3-treated PSII reveal similarities suggestive of formtion of the same spin S = 1/2 state. Substrate accessibility in the dark S1' state, measured as Mn2+ release upon incubation with NH2OH, is increased by 10-fold over calcium-containing PSII centers. Diphenylcarbazide, an efficient electron donor to Tyr-Z+ only in PSII membranes in which Mn is removed or dislocated, was found to donate electrons in Ca2+-depleted PSII,indicating altered accessibility or reactivity. These results suggest a possible "gatekeeper" role for Ca2+ in limiting access of substrate water to the Mn cluster. These changes are not due to release of the three extrinsic polypeptides of PSII which remain bound. Citrate treatment also causes partial air oxidation of the reaction-center Fe2+ ion, associated with the quinone electron acceptors. The resulting Fe3+ possesses an EPR signal at g = 4.37 arising from conversion to a rhombic symmetry ligand field.									41	3	0	0	25	0	43			0006-2960			WOS:A1991FL55000014	1851435

Rate constants for this intramolecular proton transfer, a step in the catalyzed dehydration of bicarbonate, were determined from the proton-transfer-dependent rates of release of (H2O)-O-18 from the enzyme measured by mass spectrometry. The free energy plots representing these rate constants could be fit by the Marcus rate theory, resulting in an intrinsic barrier for the proton transfer of Delta G(o)(double dagger) = 2.2 +/- 0.5 kcal/mol, and a work function or thermodynamic contribution to the free energy of reaction w(r) = 10.8 +/- 0.1 kcal/mol. These values are very similar in magnitude to the Marcus parameters describing intramolecular proton transfer from His(64) and His(67) to the zinc-bound hydroxide in mutants of HCA III. That result and the equivalent efficiency of Glu(64) and Asp(64) as proton donors in the catalysis by CA III demonstrate a lack of specificity in proton transfer from these sites, which is indirect evidence of a number of proton conduction pathways through different structures of intervening water chains. The dominance of the thermodynamic contribution or work function for all of these proton transfers is consistent with the view that formation and breaking of hydrogen bonds in such water chains is a limiting factor for proton translocation.									23	0	0	0	17	0	23			0006-3495			WOS:000074061500045	9635771

However, in the current analysis of fluorescence dynamics of primary productivity, when the photosynthetic size unit of algae is used with a fixed value, the measurement results of the primary productivity of algae in an aquatic system often exhibit deviations, particularly where cyanobacteria existing. The photosynthetic size unit is defined as the ratio of the photosynthetic reaction center concentration to the chlorophyll concentration. Herein, to obtain accurate algae photosynthetic size units and improve the accuracy of the primary productivity, excitation fluorescence spectroscopy was employed to analyze the proportion of cyanobacteria and other eukaryotic algae. As a result, the photosynthetic size unit of the mixed algae sample was corrected, and a fluorescence method based on the photosynthetic size unit correction is proposed to measure the primary productivity of algae. The results of a comparison test of the primary productivity of purebred and mixed samples demonstrate that using the proposed correction method, the measurement errors of the primary production of purebred cyanobacteria, chlorophyta, and pyrrophyta samples are reduced from 38.8%, 14.3%, and 13.2% to 3.9% , 4.1%, and 5.2%, respectively. In addition, the maximum and average measurement errors of the primary productivity of the mixed sample decrease from 20. 4% and 15.2% to 4.5% and 5.2%, respectively, compared with those without correction. The proposed method can effectively resolve the measurement result deviation problem caused by the fixed value of the photosynthetic size unit. The proposed method provides an important reference to improve the measurement accuracy of primary productivity of algae in aquatic systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0253-2239			WOS:000822008900018

Effluents resulting from that process however are still high in nitrogen such that attempts were made to couple biological nitrogen removal (BNR) with anaerobic digestion (AD). The demand for organic substrate in such system is partitioned between the anaerobic metabolism in AD and the heterotrophic denitrification cascade following the autotrophic nitrification in BNR. Investigation of underlying N-converting taxa with respect to process conditions is therefore critical in optimizing N-removal in such treatment system. In this study, a pilot-scale intermittently aerated BNR bioreactor was started up either independently or in series with the AD bioreactor to treat high-strength swine waste slurry. The compositions of NH3-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), NO2--oxidizing bacteria (NOB) and denitrifiers (nosZ gene) were profiled by polymerase chain reaction-capillary electrophoresis/single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-CE/SSCP) technique and clone library analysis. Performance data suggested that these two process configurations significantly differ in the modes of biological N-removal. PCR-CE/SSCP based profiling of the underlying nitrifying bacteria also revealed the selection of distinct taxa between process configurations. Under the investigated process conditions, correlation of performance data and composition of underlying nitrifiers suggest that the stand-alone BNR bioreactor tended to favor N-removal via NO3- whereas the coupled bioreactors could be optimized to achieve the same via a NO2- shortcut. 2 (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

(maize) and Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench. Small decreases in PSII activities as well as protein levels were observed when comparing maize seedlings of varying ages. In contrast, PSII activity was not noticeable in the bundle-sheath chloroplasts of even very young Sorghum seedlings, whereas substantial amounts of some of the PSII polypeptides analyzed were still detectable. In both species the degree of reduction was found to vary drastically with respect to the different PSII subunits. The greatest depletion was observed for the 23- and 16-kDa regulatory polypeptides of the water-splitting apparatus and the 10-kDa polypeptide (psbR product), indicating that PSII activity in bundle-sheath chloroplasts is limited due to a depletion at the oxidizing site of this complex. To gain insight into the regulatory principles which control the cell-specific expression of the plastome-encoded PSII genes an in-organello translation system with intact mesophyll and bundle-sheath chloroplasts of maize was established. The synthesis of the D1 polypeptide of the PSII reaction center was found to be reduced in bundle-sheath chloroplasts, reflecting the decreased levels of D1 in this type of chloroplast.									68	1	0	0	63	0	68			0032-0935	1432-2048		WOS:A1993LN21800004

When facing aggressive conditions parasites are able to use various and complex strategies. Echinococcus granulosus, Toxocara canis, Pneumocystis carinii, Entamoeba or Toxoplasma gondii are able to seclude from the environment when stressed by surrounding (immunologic or non-immunologic) aggressive factors. Specific antigens which exert a functional activity during a short period of time appear to be concealed from the immune attack at this crucial moment. This is the case for rhoptry or dense granule antigens of Plasmodium or Toxoplasma sporozoa involved in the formation of the parasitophorous vacuole which are released in a space perfectly isolated from the outside and therefore from antibodies. Some parasites like Schistosoma mansoni or Trypanosoma brucei reveal an amazing opportunistic behavior when they use cytokines of host origin induced by the infectious process for their own development. Leishmania, Toxoplasma and Trypanosoma cruzi are able to invade immunologically competent macrophages and to avoid the triggering of killing mechanisms of these cells. Parasites also take advantage of the genetic restriction of the immune response and it has been observed for Plasmodia that some high molecular weight antigens are unable to induce an immune response in particular strains of mice. Parasite receptors involved in the invasion of host cells by parasites can function in the presence of antibodies which can explain the failure of vaccination attempts targeting this type of molecules. Among the mechanisms developed by parasites to resist to drugs it appears that transmembrane transporters described in many protozoa or helminth parasites could play a role. Moreover, the description of parasite-specific enzymes able to protect them against the damaging effects of oxygen radicals suggests that parasites are potentially able to develop a resistance phenomenon against drugs acting via an oxidative burst.									12	0	0	0	9	1	13			0100-879X			WOS:A1995QZ90300001	8520537

Model results show that thermal decomposition of magmatic H2O, CO2 and SO2 in high-T mixtures of magmatic and atmospheric gases (at T > 1400 degrees Q generate high levels of reactive trace gas species. Production of these reactive trace species is insensitive to atmospheric CO2 in mixtures where the atmospheric gas is the minor component and will hence continue during periods of low atmospheric CO2. Fluxes of NO, OH, Cl, Br and I from early Earth volcanism are predicted to exceed those from modern Earth volcanism as the higher temperature of early Earth emissions compensates for lower levels of O-2 in the atmosphere, compared to the modern Earth. Under certain conditions, the volcanic NO flux from early Earth volcanism is found to be comparable to other sources of reactive N such as lightning NO and photochemical HCN. This is one possible source of fixed nitrogen which may alleviate any postulated Archean nitrogen crisis. Our thermodynamic model reveals that production of SO3 (a potential precursor for near-source volcanic sulphate and hence 'primary' volcanic aerosol) is likely to be significantly lower from early Earth volcanism. Uncertainty in the pathway to near-source sulphate in modern volcanism (i.e., the reaction Of SO3 with water or direct emission) introduces a large uncertainty into the production rate of near-source volcanic sulphate on the early Earth.

The depsipeptide substrates contained a constant acyl group, (phenylacetyl)glycyl, and chemically different leaving groups, m-carboxyphenoxide, m-carboxythiophenoxide, 3-carboxy-4-nitrophenoxide, lactate, and thiolactate. Evaluation of the steady-state kinetic parameters and the effect of the alternative nucleophile methanol on these parameters and on the product distribution showed that deacylation was largely rate-determining to turnover of the aryl esters under conditions of substrate saturation, while acylation was rate-determining to the alkyl esters. The earlier conclusion [Govardhan & Pratt (1987) Biochemistry 26, 3385-3395] that acylation largely limited the turnover of the aryl esters was shown to be an artifact of phosphate buffer inhibition. The aminolysis of both the aryl and alkyl esters by D-phenylalanine was influenced by binding of the substrate at a second binding site on the acyl-enzyme intermediate, A study of inhibition of the hydrolysis of (phenylacetyl)glycyl-D-thiolactate by the aminolysis product (phenylacetyl)glycyl-D-phenylalanine indicated that the second binding site is also available for ligands to bind to the free enzyme and to the noncovalent Michaelis complex with this substrate. It is likely that penicillin-recognizing enzymes in general, both beta-lactamases and DD-peptidases, possess an extended substrate-binding site into which a variety of small ligands may bind at any point along the reaction coordinate and, to a greater or lesser extent depending on circumstances, affect catalysis.									44	0	0	0	31	0	45			0006-2960			WOS:A1996UA98900029	8639511

Low-cost electrocatalysts to produce tunable syngas with a potential-independent CO/H-2 ratio are highly desired. Herein, a series of N-doped carbon nanotubes encapsulating binary alloy nanoparticles (MxNi-NCNT, M= Fe, Co) were successfully fabricated through the co-pyrolysis of mela-mine and metal precursors. The MxNi-NCNT samples exhibited bamboo-like nanotubular structures with a large specific surface area and high degree of graphitization. Their electrocatalytic performance for syngas production can be tuned by changing the alloy compositions and modifying the electronic structure of the carbon nanotube through the encapsulated metal nanoparticles. Consequently, syngas with a wide range of CO/H-2 ratios, from 0.5:1 to 3.4:1, can be produced on MxNi-NCNT. More importantly, stable CO/H-2 ratios of 2:1 and 1.5:1, corresponding to the ratio to produce biofuels by syngas fermentation, could be realized on Co1Ni-NCNT and Co2Ni-NCNT, respectively, over a potential window of -0.8 to -1.2 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. Our work provides an approach to develop low-cost and potential-independent electrocatalysts to effectively produce syngas with an adjustable CO/H-2 ratio from electrochemical CO2 reduction.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2095-0179	2095-0187		WOS:000694574800001

In view of this intimate involvement of leukocytes in vascular pathology it is important to understand the signals that recruit and activate leukocytes locally in regions of vascular pathology. It is also desirable to delineate. the mechanisms by which leukocytes influence the behavior of intrinsic vascular wall cells in ways which may contribute to vascular lesion formation. Mediators elaborated by leukocytes include small molecules including lipid-derived mediators such as prostanoids, leukotrienes, and platelet activating factor. Leukocytes can also produce protein mediators including those currently classified as cytokines. The cytokines, protein mediators involved in inflammation and control of the immune response, derive from all classes of leukocytes studied. Local cytokine networks may orchestrate complex programs of expression of functions of leukocytes and endothelial and smooth muscle cells involved in vascular homeostasis and pathology. Our laboratory has been interested in hyperplastic arterial diseases including atherosclerosis and restenosis following angioplasty treatment of obstructive atherosclerosis. Definitive evidence for roles of cytokines in the pathogenesis of these syndromes are lacking. However, various in vitro and in vivo studies have furnished sufficient information to permit formulation of rather detailed hypotheses or models. In hypercholesterolemic rabbits vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) may participate in initial monocyte recruitment to prelesional areas of arterial endothelium. Other adhesion molecules including Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) may also participate in monocyte adhesion to arterial endothelial cells. Components of oxidized lipoproteins or local cytokine expression elicited by such products might signal regional expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules providing the first step in monocyte recruitment to the nascent fatty lesion. Once monocytes have adhered to arterial endothelial cells they appear to insinuate processes in between viable endothelial cells and diapedese through the endothelial monolayer. One well characterized candidate chemoattractant in this context is macrophage chemoattractant peptide-l (MCP-l). Some of the same cytokines that can augment or induce expression of monocyte adhesion molecules on the endothelium can induce MCP-1 gene expression by intrinsic vascular wall cells. Mononuclear phagocytes may express a variety of functions within evolving lesions including expression of cytokines, growth factors, apolipoprotein E, enzyme inhibitors including tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases and alpha2 macroglobulin, and production of matrix-degrading metalloproteinases themselves, small molecules including nitric oxide, a potent vasoregulatory compound, and various biologically active oxygen metabolites as well. Regulators of these various functions include monokines such as interleukin-l (II-I) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF), lymphokines such as gamma interferon or lymphotoxin, the chemoattractent molecule MCP-1 mentioned above, and various hematopoetic growth factors including monocyte-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF).This latter mediator augments apolipoprotein E gene expression by mononuclear phagocytes and induces expression of the ''scavenger receptor'', that participates in transformation of blood monocytes into foam cells. The apolipoprotein E may play an immunomodulatory role as an inhibitor of lymphocyte proliferation. In addition apolipoprotein E may associate with high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles and target them for peripheral catabolism during ''reverse cholesterol transport'', a process that may contribute to the net accumulation of lipid within evolving or regresssing arterial lesions. Modern cytochemical studies have confirmed proliferation of smooth muscle cells in injured arteries. Macrophage-derived and other locally produced or platelet-derived mitogens may be important in stimulating hyperplasia of smooth muscle cells during formation of arterial lesions. In summary, cytokines regulate four distinct aspects of mononuclear phagocyte function in relation to atherogenesis : adhesion, penetration, activation (including mediator elaboration), and division. Cytokines likely participate in the earliest stages of lesion formation, recruitment of monocytes to the nascent fatty streak. During the long clinically silent phases of lesion evolution cytokines probably contribute to the complex regulation of adaptive and pathogenic processes that lead to lesion complication. Finally, cytokines may participate in signalling the transition from chronic to acute phases of atherosclerosis, yielding the acute arterial syndromes that constitute a major and continuing challenge to modern medicine. Further understanding of the particular roles of specific cytokines at various stages of lesion initiation, evolution, and complication may reveal new targets for intervention in these processes.

J	Shi, Guiqin; Shen, Jiaxin; Ren, Fei; Yang, Weikai								Molecular cloning, expression, and characterization of BmSOD3 in silkworm (Bombyx mori)								ARCHIVES OF INSECT BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY				106	1					e21744	10.1002/arch.21744		SEP 2020		JAN 2021	2021	Superoxide dismutases (SODs) play an essential role in eliminating excess reactive oxygen species and maintaining the redox balance of the immune system. To study the function of BmSOD3 in silkworm, 543-bp full-length complementary DNA-encoding BmSOD3 was cloned from silkworm. The BmSOD3 amino acids were compared to their homologs, and several highly conserved regions were analyzed. We also carried out phylogenetic analyses of the SOD gene. Our results showed that the BmSOD3 gene belonged with the ecCu/Zn SOD gene. The BmSOD3 gene was transformed into the pET28a vector for functional expression inEscherichia coli. The sodium salt-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis results showed that the molecular weight of recombinant BmSOD3 was about 22 kDa. The recombinant protein BmSOD3 was purified to detect its properties. After purification analyses, the enzyme activity showed Cu/Zn SOD activity, and the specific activity of the purified enzyme was 0.51 U/mg. The BmSOD3 transcripts showed tissue-specific expression in the midgut and malpighian tubule. The immune microarray data for BmSOD3 showed an expression signal that had a strong response to the induction of four pathogens (Bacillus bombyseptieus,Beauveria bassiana,E. coli, and nuclear polyhedrosis virus), particularly after infection for 24 h, which indicates that the BmSOD3 gene plays a key role in response to bacterial, fungal, and viral invasion. The fusion protein also showed antibacterial activity againstE.coliin vitro. Thus, the fusion protein BmSOD3 exhibits antibacterial activity and may be used in production to combat diseases caused by bacteria in silkworm.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0739-4462	1520-6327		WOS:000573335500001	32989839	
J	Guo, Jiangna; Zhou, Jiamei; Sun, Zhe; Wang, Mengyao; Zou, Xiuyang; Mao, Hailei; Yan, Feng								Enhanced photocatalytic and antibacterial activity of acridinium-grafted g-C3N4 with broad-spectrum light absorption for antimicrobial photocatalytic therapy								ACTA BIOMATERIALIA				146				370	384		10.1016/j.actbio.2022.03.052				JUL 1 2022	2022	As a metal-free polymeric photocatalyst, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has attracted great attention owing to its high stability and low toxicity. However, g-C3N4 suffers from low light harvesting ability which limits its applications in antimicrobial photocatalytic therapy (APCT). Herein, acridinium (ADN)-grafted g-C3N4 (ADN@g-C3N4) nanosheets are prepared via covalent grafting of ADN to g-C3N4. The obtained ADN@g-C3N4 exhibits a narrow optical band gap (2.12 eV) and a wide optical absorption spectrum (intensity a.u. > 0.30) ranging from ultraviolet to near-infrared region. Moreover, ADN@g-C3N4 would produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) under light irradiation to exert effective sterilization and biofilm elimination activities against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. Molecular dynamics simulation reveals that the ADN@g-C3N4 may move toward, tile and insert the bacterial lipid bilayer membrane through strong van der Waals and electrostatic interaction, decreasing the order parameter of the lipid while increasing the conducive of ROS migration, inducing ADN@g-C3N4 with improved antimicrobial and antibiofilm performance. Moreover, ADN@g-C3N4 could efficiently eradicate oral biofilm on artificial teeth surfaces. This work may provide a broad-spectrum light-induced photocatalytic therapy for preventing and treating dental plaque diseases and artificial teeth-related infections, showing potential applications for intractable biofilm treatment applications. An acridinium-grafted g-C3N4 (ADN@g-C3N4) with a narrow band gap and broad-spectrum light absorption was synthesized. The narrow optical band gap and improved electrostatic interaction with bacterial lipid bilayer membrane of ADN@g-C3N4 strengthened the ROS generation and facilitated the diffusion of ROS to bacteria surface, leading to enhanced photocatalytic and antibacterial activity against bacteria and corresponding biofilm under light irradiation. Statement of significance An acridinium-grafted g-C3N4 (ADN@g-C3N4) with a narrow band gap and broad-spectrum light absorption was developed as an antimicrobial photocatalytic therapy agent. The ADN@g-C3N4 exhibited enhanced photocatalytic and antibacterial activity against bacteria and corresponding biofilm under light irradiation, showing potential applications for intractable biofilm treatment.

(1) Peptide from N-terminus to Arg26 of CP43, which is exposed to stromal side, was digested in both PS II membranes, independent of binding of the 33 kDa protein. (2) Peptide bond of Arg357-Phe358 located in the large extrinsic loop E of CP43, which is exposed to lumenal side, was cleaved by trypsin in CaCl2-washed PS II membranes but not in NaCl-washed PS II membranes. This indicates that the region around Arg357-Phe358 in loop E of CP43 is shielded from tryptic attack by binding of the 33 kDa protein to PS II. (3) Trypsin treatment of CaCl2-washed PS II membranes also cleaved peptide bond between Lys457 and Gly458 in C-terminal region of CP43, while no cleavage of this region was detected by trypsin treatment of NaCl-washed PS LT membranes. This implies that a conformational change of the C-terminal region of CP43 which is exposed to stromal side occurred upon removal of the 33 kDa protein, which makes the C-terminal region accessible to trypsin. (4) Release of peptide from Gln60 to C-terminus of the alpha-subunit of cytochrome b-559 was detected only in trypsin treatment of CaCl2-washed PS II membranes, indicating that the C-terminal region of this subunit is shielded from tryptic attack by binding of the 33 kDa protein. (5) The PS II membranes, in which Arg357-Phe358, Lys457-Gly458 of CP43 and the C-terminal part of the cytochrome b-559 alpha-subunit had been cleaved by trypsin, was no longer able to bind the 33 kDa protein. This strongly suggests that a domain in loop E of CP43 and/or the C-terminal region of the cytochrome b-559 alpha-subunit are necessary for binding of the extrinsic 33 kDa protein to PS II.

A broadened radical signal induced by low-temperature near-infrared light illumination								BIOCHEMISTRY				39	18			5246	5254		10.1021/bi000131c				MAY 9 2000	2000	The tetranuclear manganese cluster responsible for the oxidation of water in photosystem II cycles through five redox states denoted S-i (i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4). Progress has been made recently in the detection of weak low-field EPR absorptions in both the perpendicular and parallel modes, associated with the integer spin state S-3 [Matsukawa, T., Mine, H., Yoneda, D., and Kawamori, A. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 4072-4077]. We confirm observation of these signals and have obtained them in high yield by illumination of photosystem II membranes, in which the non-heme iron was chemically preoxidized. It is shown that a split g = 4 signal accompanies the S-3 State signals. The signals diminish in the presence of ethanol and vanish in the presence of methanol. This effect is similar to that exerted by these alcohols to the high-spin component (g = 4.1) of the S-2 State and suggests that the latter spin configuration is the precursor of the Sg State low-field signals. The Sg State shows similar sensitivity to infrared illumination as has been observed previously in the S-2 State [Boussac, A., Un, S., Horner, O., and Rutherford, A. W. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 4001-4007]. Illumination of the Sg State with near-infrared light (700-900 nm), at temperatures around 50 K, results in the modification of the low-field signals and most notably to the appearance of a broad (Delta H similar to 200 G) radical-type signal centered at g = 2. The signal is tentatively assigned to the interaction of the Mn cluster in a modified S-2 State with a radical.									75	0	0	0	54	0	75			0006-2960			WOS:000086950900003	10819993

Black seabream (Acanthopagrus schlegelii) is a euryhaline fish, that are farmed in China under both normal/ambient salinity in seawater cages and low salinity conditions in pond culture. To explore the effects of an acute change in salinity on physiological metabolism, juvenile black seabream (weight 19.80 +/- 0.37 g) was subjected to low salinity (4-5 psu) over five time points including 1 h (H1), 6 h (H6), 12 h (H12), 24 h (H24) and one week (W), with 0 h (initial, natural salinity of 22 psu) as control group. Results indicated that acute exposure to low-salinity resulted in various responses related to oxidative stress (OS) and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). The key markers of OS including reactive oxygen species and malonaldehyde were significantly increased with acute salinity stress up to 6 h, then decreased to return to normal levels. A similar pattern was recorded for total antioxidant capacity, which showed significantly higher activity in the H6 group. All parameters related to ERS increased with duration of the low-salinity stress, which stimulated expression of key genes including nuclear factor kappa B (nf-(K)b) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (jnk), triggering inflammation and apoptosis. However, total apoptotic cell rate decreased markedly as the duration of salinity stress increased up to one week. Gill expression of genes of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) biosynthesis was up-regulated by low salinity stress with levels of docosahexaenoic (DHA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and arachidonic acids (ARA) being highest in the H12 group, which positively contributed to enhanced ability of osmoregulation. In conclusion, acute low-salinity stress stimulated various stress responses but, as the duration of salinity stress increased, the fish showed signs of physiological adaptation to the environmental change. During the adaptive process to maintain hemolymph osmotic pressure regulation, LC-PUFA were rapidly enriched in gill, which might be a crucial strategy allowing A. schlegelii to adapt to low-salinity stress. These findings provided further insight and understanding of the physiological responses and underlying adaptive strategy of euryhaline fish to salinity stress, and confirmed time dependent effects.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0044-8486	1873-5622		WOS:000784324300009

Experiments performed with dark-adapted samples enriched either in the oxidized or reduced form of the redox-active tyrosine, Y(D), of PolYpeptide D2 reveal that Y(D)ox is a unique endogenous oxidant within the PS II complex which causes a one-electron abstraction from the water oxidase in states S0, S-1, and S-2, respectively. A kinetic analysis of the period four oscillation of oxygen yield induced by a train of short flashes in dark-adapted samples permits the determination of the rate constants of electron abstraction from the reduced water oxidase by Y(D)ox. A value of 9 x 10(-4) s-1 was found for the oxidation of S0 and S-2, while S-1 becomes oxidized with a rate constant of 4 x 10(-4) s-1 at 20-degrees-C and pH 7.2. The redox state S0 generated either from S1 via the three-flash-induced oxidative pathway through S4 or from a one-flash oxidation of the S-1 state obtained by S1 reduction with NH2NH2 exhibits the same kinetics as S0 oxidation by Y(D)ox. On the basis of these findings and data taken from the literature, the electronic configuration of the Manganese atoms in the tetranuclear cluster is discussed. It is assumed that the dimer model of two binuclear manganese groups within the tetranuclear cluster comprises a functional heterogeneity: (i) one binuclear center, referred to as the catalytic group, is proposed to be involved in the oxidative pathway leading to the eventual oxidation of water to dioxygen, and (ii) the other binuclear center, symbolized as component C, is redox-inert during the oxidative pathway but can be reduced by exogenous (and endogenous?) components, thereby forming the states S-1 and S-2 Of the water oxidase. An asymmetric protein matrix around the tetranuclear manganese cluster is assumed to be responsible for the functional heterogeneity of the manganese centers.									77	0	1	0	61	0	78			0006-2960			WOS:A1993LX28600017	8369309	
J	Hays, AMA; Vassiliev, IR; Golbeck, JH; Debus, RJ								Role of D1-His190 in proton-coupled electron transfer reactions in photosystem II: A chemical complementation study								BIOCHEMISTRY				37	32			11352	11365		10.1021/bi980510u				AUG 11 1998	1998	Recent models for water oxidation in photosystem II propose that His190 of the D1 polypeptide facilitates electron transfer from tyrosine Y-Z to P-680(+) by accepting the hydroxyl proton from Y-Z. To test these models, and to further define the role of D1-His190 in the proton-coupled electron transfer reactions of PSII, the rates of P-680(+) reduction, Y-Z oxidation, Q(A)(-) oxidation, and Y-Z(.) reduction were measured in PSII particles isolated from several D1-His190 mutants constructed in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. These measurements were conducted in the absence and presence of imidazole and other small organic bases. In all mutants examined, the rates of P-680(+) reduction, Y-Z oxidation, and Y-Z(.) reduction after a single flash were slowed dramatically and the rate of Q(A)(-) oxidation was accelerated to values consistent with the reduction of P-680(+) by Q(A)(-) rather than by Y-Z. There appeared to be little correlation between these rates and the nature of the residue substituted for D1-His190, However, in nearly all mutants examined, the rates of P-680(+) reduction, Y-Z oxidation, and Y-Z(.) reduction were accelerated dramatically in the presence of imidazole and other small organic bases (e.g., methyl-substituted imidazoles, histidine, methylamine, ethanolamine, and TRIS), In addition, the rate of Q(A)(-) oxidation was decelerated substantially. For example, in the presence of 100 mM imidazole, the rate of electron transfer from Y-Z to P-680(+) in most D1-His190 mutants increased 26-87-fold. Furthermore, in the presence of 5 mM imidazole, the rate of Y-Z(.) reduction in the D1-His190 mutants increased to values comparable to that of Mn-depleted wild-type PSII particles in the absence of imidazole. On the basis of these results, we conclude that D1-His190 is the immediate proton acceptor for Y-Z and that the hydroxyl proton of Y-Z remains bound to D1-His190 during the lifetime of Y-Z., thereby facilitating the reduction of Y-Z(.).									191	1	1	0	122	0	192			0006-2960			WOS:000075362900024	9698383

However, fast carriers recombination and severe photocorrosion inevitably result in low carriers utilization, leading to undesirable photocatalytic performance and poor durability. To address the issues, N heteroatoms were introduced into the lattice of hexagonal CdS NPs to prepare the N-doped CdS (N-CdS) nanocatalyst via a wet chemical precipitation coupled with a hydrothermal process. Due to the synergetic promotion of heteroatomsemiconductor coordination (HSC) interaction to body carriers migration of CdS, their recombination behavior was effectively hampered, resulting obviously increased photocurrent density (-2 times) and significantly improved photoexcited carriers utilization. Thereby, high apparent quantum yield (AQY = 32.41%, lambda = 500 nm) was achieved by the optimized N0.2-CdS nanocatalyst. Under simulated sunlight (SSL) irradiation, about 3983.4 mu mol.h(-1).g(-1) of HER rate with excellent photostability was achieved at absence of cocatalyst, which raises to about 9-fold greater than that of bare CdS NPs. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations proved that the energy barrier of water splitting on Cd sites and |delta G(H*)| of H-2 generation on S sites were reduced obviously due to the synergetic HSC interaction, which thermodynamically accelerated the H2 generation. This study provides a simple and green strategy for gaining highly stable CdS photocatalyst with improved HER photoactivity.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000804193700005

On lettuce leaves, P. cichorii invades intercellular spaces through stomata and grows vigorously, causing rot on the leaves. Surprisingly, P. cichorii does not produce pectate lyase, the most important enzyme for degrading plant cell walls. Alternatively, infection with P. cichorii causes heterochromatin condensation and DNA laddering in lettuce cells, followed by induced cell death, which results in disease symptoms. Thus, apoptotic programmed cell death (PCD) is associated with the symptoms on lettuce leaves. Although PCD in P. cichorii-infected eggplant leaves is also associated with necrotic spots caused by the bacteria, there are differences in the responses of the two hosts. P. cichorii harbors the N-acetyltransferase family gene (pat) and the hrp genes (hrp) encoding a type III secretion system, adjacent to an aldehyde dehydrogenase gene (aldH). The virulence of P. cichorii is hrp-dependent in eggplant, but not in lettuce. Furthermore, hrp, pat and aldH are implicated in the diversity of P. cichorii virulence on susceptible Asteraceae species. The involvement of hrp, aldH and pat in bacterial virulence on the respective species has no relationship with the phylogeny of the plants species. When these results are considered together, P. cichorii has multiple virulence determinants. The involvement of not only hrp but also aldH and pat in P. cichorii virulence arose after species diversification of host plants. Host responses implicated in symptom development have been responsible for the development of virulence determinants of P. cichorii.									10	0	0	0	10	0	10			1345-2630	1610-739X		WOS:000326697500001

Herein, the pyroelectric catalysis is firstly investigated by combining pyroelectric effect and electrochemical catalysis on pyroelectric BaTiO3 electrodes for realizing water splitting under thermal gradient excitation. On this basis, the pyrophoto-electric catalysis is proposed by coupling pyroelectric and photoelectrochemical catalysis to enhance the performance of the photoanode in water splitting for the first time. The current density of BaTiO3 under cold-hot alternation and illumination increases to 0.38 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE, obviously higher than the sum of photocurrent (0.17 mA cm(-2)) and pyroelectric current (0.13 mA cm(-2)). The improvement of the performance is not only owing to the generation of photo-generated and pyro-generated carriers, but due to the boosted charge separation caused by band alignment. This work indicates a novel strategy of pyro-electric catalysis and pyrophoto-electric catalysis by using BaTiO3 nanorods, realizing the synergetic utilization of multi-energy, including solar energy and thermal resource, which provides a practical method in designing the electrodes with excellent catalytic performance.									40	2	0	0	2	0	41			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000623582500004

Herein, boron-and phenyl-codoped graphitic carbon nitride was prepared by thermal polycondensation of cyanamide with 3-aminobenzeneboronic acid and applied as photocatalyst to inactivate Escherichia soli (E. coli). The photocatalysts exhibited the enhanced light responsive range over ultraviolet to near infrared light and 99.9% bacteria could be inactivated within 3 h with a low concentration of photocatalyst under the irradiation of simulated solar light. The disinfection mechanism was studied by scavenger experiments, indicating H2O2 was the main reactive species for the inactivation of bacteria. Finally, the photocatalyst was deposited on the surface of solid material and also exhibited strong disinfection performance. Taking advantage of excellent disinfection activity and low cytotoxicity, the photocatalyst showed a promising application in solar-driven photocatalytic disinfection in public place.									21	1	0	0	9	0	22			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000442334400007	29960935

In the present work, n-type anatase TiO2 coupled with p-type B-doped g-C3N4 nanosheet (BCN) were fabricated and Au-Cu nanoalloy with varying atomic ratio were deposited on the p-n heterojunction. The incorporation of Au-Cu on the interface of the dyad enhances light absorption over broad regime, charge separation, and migration. Au-Cu with 1:1 ratio (with an average particle size of 1.2 nm) loaded p-n hetrojunction (TBCAC-1:1) shows excellent photocurrent enhancement (approximately 4.4-folds) in the cathodic direction as compared to their monometallic plasmonic counterpart. Additionally, the catalyst shows photocurrent at zero biased potential as well as lower onset potential as compared to the other alloy. TBCAC-1:1 photocatalyst could able to produce 2150 mu mol h(-1)g(-1) of hydrogen, which is (approximately 3-folds) as compared to their monometallic counterparts. The hydrogen evolution process for Au-Cu (1:1) system was found to be governed by the charge distribution which dictates the binding preference of the Au and Cu sites leading to the water splitting as investigated by DFT calculation. The excellent hydrogen generation by the photocatalyst links to the synergistic effect between Au and Cu associated with the hot electron photochemistry due to surface plasmon resonance phenomenon.

Fly ash is especially problematic because of its high content in heavy metals easily drawn out. Thermal processes, based mainly on electrical are processes, are used to melt the residues at high temperature and convert them into a relatively inert glass. Consequently, to improve the process and get a glass satisfying regulation, control of heavy metals (lead, zinc, cadmium and chromium...) volatility during plasma fly ash melting and vitrification is needed and basic data concerning vaporization of these metals are required. According to the volatility of these compounds observed during vitrification of fly ash, a predictive model has been used to simulate the elimination of Pb, Zn and S from the melt as a function of time and temperature for a system including chlorides, oxides and sulfates. The objective of this work was the experimental study of heavy metals volatility using optical emission spectroscopy. A twin torch plasma system, mounted above a cold crucible with At (or At + O-2) as plasma gas, has been used. The crucible was filled with synthetic glass in which known amounts of metallic salts were added to obtain the same chemical composition as used in the model. From spectral lines intensities of Ar, the plasma temperature profiles along the observation direction has been first established, before using ratios of spectral lines of Ar and metallic (Pb, Zn) or Cl vapors to reach the evolution of the elements concentrations above the melt. Off-gases have been analyzed by mass spectrometry. The influence of the atmosphere (Ar or Ar + O-2) above the crucible has been studied and differences in elements behaviors have been pointed out. The results of the spectroscopic measurements have been compared to the ones issued of modeling, in order to validate our model of vaporization.

The mass gain of the composite with 14 vol pct LaB6 is found as the highest during non-isothermal oxidation, whereas it appears as the least on isothermal exposure for 24 hours at 1400 degrees C or 1500 degrees C. The mass gain after 24 cycles of 1-hour exposure at 1300 degrees C to 1500 degrees C is found to be lower than that recorded under isothermal condition for all the composites, with the difference decreasing with LaB6 content. The oxidation exponent (n) is found to decrease to near parabolic rate law with the increase in cyclic exposure temperature. The parabolic rate constant (k(p)) is found to decrease with the increase in LaB6 content after a few cycles of exposure at all the investigated temperatures. The oxide scales formed on isothermal exposure at 1400 degrees C or 1500 degrees C have shown a thin La2Si2O7 layer with borosilicate glass (BSG) as the outer layer, followed by layers containing BSG along with coarse and fine ZrO2, and a SiC-depleted ZrB2 layer. The oxide scales formed during cyclic exposure contain an outer compact layer comprising BSG, La2Si2O7, and ZrSiO4, followed by ZrO2 + BSG. Additionally, a SiC-depleted layer is found at the oxide-composite interface on cyclic exposure at 1500 degrees C for 24 hours, and at 1400 degrees C for 100 hours. The outer compact layer appears to have a critical role in protection against oxidation, with k(p) decreasing with the increase in its thickness.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1073-5623	1543-1940		WOS:000715004600003

A similar phenotype exists in cattle, in which a nonsense mutation in the bovine orthologue causes fishy off-flavor in cow's milk. The fishy odor is caused by an elevated level of excreted odorous trimethylamine (TMA), due to deficient oxidation of TMA. We report the mapping of a similar disorder (fishy taint of eggs) and the chicken FMO3 gene to chicken chromosome 8. The only nonsynonymous mutation identified in the chicken FMO3 gene (T329S) changes an evolutionarily highly conserved amino acid and is associated with elevated levels of TMA and fishy taint in the egg yolk in several chicken lines. No differences in the expression of FMO3 were found among individuals with different associated genotypes, indicating that the trait is not caused by a linked polymorphism causing altered expression of the gene. The results support the importance and function of the evolutionarily conserved motif FATGY, which has been speculated to be a substrate recognition pocket of N-hydroxylating siderophore enzymes and flavin-containing mono-oxygenases.

The following electrochemical tests were carried out including open circuit potential, galvanostatic chronoamperometry and cyclic voltammetry measurements. The results showed that an increase on MnO2 content in the composites did not only lower the potentials but enhanced the stability of the composites. The degradation which translates to corrosion susceptibility was favorable on composite samples with lower MnO2 content. Also, the presence of MWCNTs in the composites improved the electrocatalytic capacity of the material. Furthermore, the anodic layers formed on the composites during polarization was analyzed using SEM, XRD and cyclic voltammetry. The results showed that the formation of anodic layer during 24 h of polarization increased with the addition of MnO2 content and 15 MnO2-TiO2-MWCNT composite grade showed minimal pores after polarization which translates to higher protection.

The tune bandgap and improved electrical conductivity of the Ag-doped Co3O4 sample are confirmed by UV-visible spectroscopy and two probe current-voltage (I-V) measurements. The Ag-doped Co3O4 sample exhibits a higher surface area (176 m(2)g(-1)) than that of the pristine Co3O4 sample (108 m(2)g(-1)). The Ag-doped Co3O4/NF based electrode shows superior specific capacitance of 1425 Fg(-1) at 1 Ag-1 and outstanding rate capability as it retains 92.84% of its initial specific capacitance (at 1 Ag-1) even at higher the current density of 10 Ag-1. Moreover, the specific capacitance of the material increases up to 104.7% of its initial capacitance for the first 2000 cycles, and then it gradually decreases to 96.4% after 5000 cycles. In fact, the superior electrochemical properties of the mesoporous Ag-doped Co3O4 nanosheets are attributed to its tuned bandgap, improved specific surface area, mesoporous architecture, and binder-free design. The electrochemical results revealed that the mesoporous Ag-doped Co3O4 NSs can be used as potential electrode material in the high-performance electrochemical capacitor. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Three TiO2 samples were calcined at different temperatures and then IrO2 was loaded on them with a mass ratio of IrO2/TiO2 of 2/3 by a modified Adams fusion method. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction ( XRD), specific surface area measurement, thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry analysis ( TGA-DSC), transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) and electrochemical testing. The electrochemical activity of the catalysts was investigated in a single cell proton exchange membrane(PEM) electrolyzer consisting of a PVC cathode and a Nafion117 membrane. The results suggested that as the calcination temperature increased, the mesoporous structure of TiO2 was destroyed, the pore size increased and the pore volume reduced, and the phase of TiO2 transferred from anatase to rutile structure. Utilization of the TiO2 support resulted in a reduction in the size of the IrO2 crystallites and improved the distribution of catalyst. It was found that the lower the specific surface area of the support was, the higher the electrochemical activity of the catalyst was. This is most likely due to the formation of a conductive IrO2 film on the surface of non-conductive supports with 40% ( mass fraction) loading of IrO2. The IrO2, 40% IrO2/TiO2-2 and 40% IrO2/TiO2-3 catalysts showed a polarization potential of 2. 024, 2. 426 and 2. 064 V, respectively, under a current density of 1. 0 A/cm(2). These results suggest that the surface structure of the support has a great influence on the catalytic activity of IrO2.									3	4	0	0	0	0	5			0251-0790			WOS:000369194400021

A NiO cocatalyst layer is then deposited on the surface of the CdS coated ZnO and makes up a three-component nanostructured composite photoelectrode (NiO/CdS@ZnO). This composite photoelectrode shows an improved photoelectrochemical performance under Air Mass 1.5 (AM 1.5) simulated sunlight. It generates a photocurrent density of 950 mu A/cm(2) with a comparatively low potential -0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl in a 0.5 M Na2S and Na2SO3 solution, which is 6.78 times as much as that of the as-grown ZnO nanorods. Furthermore, it is also an efficient photoanode to split pure water, producing a photocurrent density of 530 mu A/cm(2) at 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl in a 1 M Na2SO4 solution. In the composite, ZnO nanorods absorb UV light with a wide band gap, 3.2 eV, while CdS, with a narrow band gap (2.4 eV), utilizes the remaining visible light, furthermore, an ordered transfer of the charge carriers occurs in the component phases. The photoluminescence (PL) experiment results prove that the direct loading of NiO on ZnO results in an inactive material. However, both the CdS/ZnO and NiO/CdS@ZnO composites are active and the charge carrier separations in them are effectively improved than in the as-grown ZnO. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, Cs3Bi2I9 (CBI) quantum dots (QDs) were firstly loaded into the inner pores of MOF NH2-UiO-66 (U6N) through an anti-solvent recrystallization (ASR) method. The light adsorption wavelength of the MOF composite was significantly extended to the visible region, and remarkably, the complementary electronic band structures between MOF and CBI resulted in spatial separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in this material. Thereby, under visible light irradiation, the prepared catalysts exhibited high H-2 production activity of 32.21 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) that originated from photocatalytic proton reduction without introducing noble metals, far surpassing the MOF and CBI counterparts. In addition, under the synergistic effect of CBI QDs and low-coordination Pt metal clusters, the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate can be further improved to 141.87 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) with a TON value of 17.74. The electron migration mechanism among CBI and U6N, and the microstructure of low coordination Pt clusters was also investigated through transient absorption spectra (TAS) and X-ray absorption spectra (XAS).									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2052-1537		WOS:000697790800001

In the present study, the differential expression profiles of lncRNAs were analyzed to identify novel targets for further study of AIP. A total of 10 lncRNAs were chosen for validation by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. To further determine the functions of dysregulated lncRNAs and their corresponding mRNAs, functional enrichment analysis, coexpression analysis were performed. A total of 329 lncRNAs and 179 mRNAs were identified to be differently expressed between the invasive and control group. Gene ontology analysis revealed that the 10 most significantly enriched functions included upregulated mRNAs and the most significantly enriched term was related to the proteinaceous extracellular matrix (ECM). In the pathway analysis, the two most significantly enriched pathways were the TGF-beta signaling pathway for upregulated mRNAs and the pentose phosphate pathway for downregulated mRNAs. Furthermore, for certain dysregulated lncRNAs, their associated mRNAs were also dysregulated. Of note, BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor and TGF-beta -induced, as the target genes of the TGF-beta pathway, were indicated to be closely related to the ECM and invasive placental cells. Their nearby lncRNAs G008916 and vault RNA2-1 were also significantly dysregulated. In conclusion, significant lncRNAs with the potential to serve as biomarkers for AIP were identified.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1792-0981	1792-1015		WOS:000601193600001	33235622

The porous titanium sheet acts as a gas diffusion layer (GDL); the nanostructured TiO(2)surface acts as a catalyst support with large surface area; and the iridium nanoparticles act as the electrocatalyst. The performance of these unique GDEs in PEMWE cells was optimized by etching in different NaOH concentrations to vary the nanostructure of the TiO2; and by varying the Ir loading via the number of APD pulses. The current-voltage characteristics and the durability of the optimized GDEs were comparable to those reported in the literature using conventional Ir-based electrocatalysts, and electrolysis was achieved with current density up to 5 A cm(-2). The main advantages of this catalyst-integrated GDE include the very low iridium loading (i.e. around 0.1 mg cm(-2), or just one-tenth of the loading typically used in conventional PEMWEs); high electrolysis current density; the fabrication of stacks with fewer components; and the fabrications of thinner stacks. This could ultimately lead to smaller and lower cost PEMWE systems.									5	1	0	0	1	0	5			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000570822500001

However, poor charge separation and low charge carrier mobility hinder the improvement of PEC performance of BiVO4. In this work, molybdenum (Mo)-doped BiVO4@reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposites are fabricated and their potential to serve as photoanodes for PEC water splitting is evaluated. This composite, by the introduction of Mo-dopant and rGO in BiVO4 enhances the PEC performance for water oxidation for they assist in reducing charge recombination and enhancement of photocurrent. As a result, the Mo-BiVO4@rGO composite photoanode exhibited a photocurrent density of 8.51 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is two and four times greater than that of Mo-BiVO4 (5.3 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus RHE) and pristine BiVO4 (2.01 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus RHE) photoactive electrodes. In addition, good photoconversion efficiency, low charge transfer resistance and good external quantum efficiency (EQE) are achieved for this ternary nanocomposite. These studies reveal the improved PEC activity for water splitting by the Modoped BiVO4@rGO, and indicated that this approach can be used to design more efficient photoanodes for PEC water splitting.					9th International Symposium on Group Five Elements9th International Symposium on Group Five Elements	NOV 22-24, 2017NOV 22-24, 2017	Indian Inst Technol, Dept Chem EngnIndian Inst Technol, Dept Chem Engn	New Delhi, INDIANew Delhi, INDIA	36	1	0	0	2	0	37			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000456706900012

By means of OPA-induced cross-linking a major conjugate of about 60 kDa has been identified. This conjugate was shown to consist of two pigment-protein complexes of light-harvesting complex II (LHC IT), Lhc bl (CP27) and Lhc b4 (CP29) by means of SDS/PAGE in combination with an immunological analysis using mAbs directed against Lhc b4 and by matrix-assisted-laser-desorption-ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and sequence analysis of peptides derived from a proteolytic digest of the conjugate. Domains of Lhc bl and Lhc b4 have been localized to a distance of not more than 5 Angstrom within LHC TI. Our results are discussed in the light of recent models on the topography of the two subunits within the antenna system of Photosystem II.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			0014-2956			WOS:000076838800008	9839947

A procedure was applied to correct for the effects of atmospheric differential refraction arising from the large zenith distance of the observations. Maps of interstellar reddening, electron temperature and abundances of elements (O/H, N/H, He/H and Ne/H) were constructed. Comparisons are made with similar maps of the amorphous galaxy NGC 5253. II Zw 40 suffers from large intrinsic absorption due to dust, with the greater values of A(V) being found in the northern half of the galaxy. Electron temperatures were measured at 24 points over the bright core of the galaxy from the [O III] 5007/4363-angstrom line ratio. The mean value of T(e) derived from the integrated spectrum of the emission-line region is 12 000 K, and [O/H] = 8.25. Three points covering an area of approximately 160 x 100 pc2 have significantly lower T(e), and abundances of O/H and N/H appear higher. It is shown that the original calibration proposed by Pagel, Edmunds & Smith for the line ratio ([O II] + [O III])/Hbeta to derive O/H agrees with our direct measurements of O/H for the metallicity range observed in II Zw 40 and NGC 5253.N/O is found to be weakly inversely correlated with O/H in II Zw 40, as for NGC 5253. Various mechanisms have been explored in order to explain this anticorrelation. Radiative recombination in the O2+ region is not found to be a significant contributor to the [O II] surface brightness; thus it cannot account for the anticorrelation. Excitation or charge exchange reaction effects can also be excluded. The observed behaviour of N/O in II Zw 40 and NGC 5253 is possibly due to a mix of secondary nitrogen with primary nitrogen of unknown origin.									35	0	0	0	0	0	35			0035-8711			WOS:A1993KZ98700007

Among previously reported dual-junction PEC devices with a GaInP2 top cell, those with the highest performance incorporate an AlInP2 window layer (WL) to reduce surface recombination and a thin GaInP2 capping layer (CL) to protect the WL from corrosion in electrolytes. However, the stability of these III-V systems is limited, and durability continues to be a major challenge broadly in the field of PEC water splitting. This work provides a systematic investigation into the durability of GaInP2 systems, examining the impacts of the window layer and capping layer among single junction pn-GaInP2 photocathodes coated with an MoS2 catalytic and protective layer. The photocathode with both a CL and WL demonstrates the highest PEC performance and longest lifetime, producing a significant current for >125 h. In situ optical imaging and post-test characterization illustrate the progression of macroscopic degradation and chemical state. The surface architecture combining an MoS2 catalyst, CL, and WL can be translated to dual-junction PEC devices with GaInP2 or other III-V top junctions to enable more efficient and stable PEC systems.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000743223700001	35005903

To finely tune the porous nature through controlling the micellization behaviour of P123, the mesostructured graphenes were washed under different washing conditions. As a result, the synthesized NMGs exhibit 3D porous structure with high surface area (941-1297 m(2)g(-1)) as well as fine-tuned pore size (4.4-11.2 nm) at a few-nanometer scale. Also, to find the optimal temperature for the best supercapacitor performance, the annealing temperature was regulated at 500 degrees C, 700 degrees C, and 900 degrees C. The content and configuration of nitrogen in NMG were rationally controlled as a function of annealing temperature, which strongly influences the electrical conductivity and supercapacitor performance. The highest capacitance of 284 F g(-1) was achieved for NMG calcined at 700 degrees C with a current density of 0.1 A g(-1). Furthermore, it shows good cycle stability with similar to 98% retention of its initial capacitance at a current density of 3.0 A g(-1), even after 5000 cycles.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			1387-1811	1873-3093		WOS:000504505500024

Flash-induced fluorescence kinetics showed that in the absence of DCMU, the half time of the fast and slow components decreased while that of the middle component increased considerably with increasing salt concentration. In the presence of DCMU, fluorescence relaxation was dominated by a 0.6s component in control cells. After salt stress, this was partially replaced by a faster new component with half time of 20-50 ms. Thermoluminescence measurements revealed that S(2)Q(A)(-) and S(2)Q(B)(-) recombinations were shifted to higher temperatures in parallel and the intensities of the thermoluminescence emissions were significantly reduced in salt-stressed cells. The period-four oscillation of the thermoluminescence B band was highly damped. There were no significant changes in contents of CP47, CP43, cytochrome c550, and D1 proteins. However, content of the PsbO protein in thylakoid fraction decreased but increased significantly in soluble fraction. The results suggest that salt stress leads to a modification of the Q(B) niche at the acceptor side and an increase in the stability of the S-2 state at the donor side, which is associated with a dissociation of the PsbO protein.

Among the widely studied semiconductor nanomaterials, CdxZn1-xS ternary system has gained significant interest due to its tunable band edge, optical, and electronic properties by merely varying the Cd2+/Zn2+ content. Consequently, CdxZn1-xS-based nanostructures have been extensively studied as promising visible-light-active photocatalysts for H-2 production from water and other photocatalytic transformations. Herein, a comprehensive account of the research progress in the development of CdxZn1-xS-based photocatalysts for the production of solar fuel, H-2 from water is provided. Further, various strategies used in enhancing the photocatalytic activity of CdxZn1-xS photocatalysts, like control of the morphology (0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D), bandgap engineering, and fabrication of various heterostructures have been discussed in detail. Furthermore, opportunities and future perspectives of CdxZn1-xS-based photocatalysts for practical applications have also been discussed. Overall, the importance of CdxZn1-xS-based photocatalysts is showcased for efficient visible-light-driven hydrogen production and can be beneficial for the design of sustainable photocatalytic systems.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2367-198X			WOS:000651709500001		
J	Yang, Li-Qiang; Guo, Lin-Nan; Wang, Zhong-Liang; Zhao, Rong-Xin; Song, Ming-Chun; Zheng, Xiao-Li								Timing and mechanism of gold mineralization at the Wang'ershan gold deposit, Jiaodong Peninsula, eastern China								ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS				88				491	510		10.1016/j.oregeorev.2016.06.027				AUG 2017	2017	The Wang'ershan gold deposit, located in the southern Jiaojia goldfield, is currently the largest gold deposit hosted within the subsidiary faults in Jiaodong Peninsula, with a gold reserve of >60 t gold at a grade of 4.07 g/t Au. It is hosted in the Late Jurassic Linglong biotite granites and controlled by the second-order, N- to NNE-trending Wang'ershan Fault (and its subsidiary faults) which is broadly parallel to the first-order Jiaojia Fault in the goldfield. Gold mineralization occurs as both disseminated- and stockwork-style and quartz-sulfide vein-style ores, mainly within altered cataclasites and breccias, and sericite-quartz and potassic alteration zones, respectively. Mineralization stages can be divided into (1) the pyrite-quartz-sericite stage, (2) the quartz-pyrite stage, (3) the quartz-sulfide stage, and (4) the quartz-carbonate stage.Two sericite samples associated with the main ore-stage pyrites from pyritic phyllic ores of the deposit with weighted mean plateau Ar-40/Ar-39 age of 120.7 +/- 0.6 Ma and 119.2 +/- 0.5 Ma, respectively, were selected for Ar-40/Ar-39 geochronology. On the basis of petrography and microthermometry, three types of primary fluid inclusions related to the ore forming event were identified: type 1 H2O-CO2-NaCI, type 2 aqueous, and type 3 CO2 fluid inclusions (in decreasing abundance). Stage I quartz contains all three primary fluid inclusions, while stages 2 and 3 quartz contain both type 1 and 2 inclusions, and stage 4 quartz contains only type 2 inclusions. The contemporaneous trapping, similar salinities and total homogenization temperature ranges, and different homogenization phases of type 1 and type 2 inclusions indicate that fluid immiscibility did take place in stages I, 2 and 3 ores, with P-T conditions of 190 to 85 MPa and 334 to 300 degrees C for stage 1 and 200 to 40 MPa and 288 to 230 degrees C for stages 2 and 3. Combined with the H-O-C-S-Pb isotopic compositions, ore-forming fluids may have a metamorphic-dominant mixed source, which could be associated with the dehydration and decarbonisation of a subducting paleo-Pacific plate and characterized by medium-high temperature (285350 degrees C), CO2-bearing (similar to 8 mol%) with minor CH4 (1-4% in carbonic phase), and low salinity (3.38-8.45 eq. wt.% NaCI). During mineralization, the fluid finally evolved into a medium-low temperature NaCI-H2O system. Au(HS)(2)(-) was the most probable gold-transporting complex at Wang'ershan, due to the low temperature (157-350 degrees C) and near-neutral to weakly acidic ore fluids. The reaction between gold-bearing fluids and iron bearing wall-rocks, and fluid-immiscibility processes caused via fluid-pressure cycling during seismic movement along fault zones that host lode-gold orebodies, which led to breakdown of Au(HS)(2)(-), are interpreted as the two main precipitation mechanisms of gold deposition.In general, the Wang'ershan deposit and other deposits in the Jiaojia camp have concordant structural system and wall-rock alteration assemblages, nature of orebodies and gold occurrence conditions, as well as the similar geochronology, ore-forming fluids system and stable isotope compositions. Thus gold mineralization in the Jiaojia goldfield was a large-scale unified event, with consistent timing, origin, process and mechanism. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Young, K.; Wu, A.; Qiu, Z.; Tan, J.; Mays, W.								Effects of H2O2 addition to the cell balance and self-discharge of Ni/MH batteries with AB(5) and A(2)B(7) alloys								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				37	12			9882	9891		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.03.117				JUN 2012	2012	In this paper we have compared nickel/metal hydride batteries made from AB(5) and Nd-only A(2)B(7) alloys with or without addition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The biggest advantages Nd-only A(2)B(7) alloys have over ABs alloys are: a higher positive electrode utilization rate, lower initial internal resistance and less resistance increase after a 60 degrees C storage, and higher capacity and resistance degradation during cycling. The hydrogen peroxide was used as an oxidation agent and was added into the electrolyte before closing the cells. The H2O2 can oxidize both Co(OH)(2) in the positive electrode and MH alloy in the negative electrode. From the test results, H2O2 oxides the MH alloy preferentially over the Co(OH)(2) in the case of AB(5) alloy. This preferential oxidation is reversed in the case of the A(2)B(7) alloy in which Co(OH)(2) is oxidized first. In cells made from both alloys, the addition of H2O2 prevented the venting of cells during formation, increased the utilization of positive electrode, improved the 60 degrees C charge retention, and increased the mid-point voltage after 300 cycles. Additionally the H2O2 also improved the cell balance for A(2)B(7) alloy by decreasing the over-discharge reservoir in the negative electrode and reducing the capacity degradation in A(2)B(7) alloy. However, the addition of H2O2 in cells made with AB(5) alloy deteriorated the cell balance by increasing the over-discharge reservoir in the negative electrode. The different cell balance and failure mechanisms for the two alloy compositions and H2O2 additive were compared and discussed. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The IrO2 colloid on the ITO surface was characterized using electrochemical, inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopic, X-ray diffraction spectroscopic, scanning electron microscopic, and atomic force microscopic techniques. The self-assembly was promoted steeply at pH 3.5 to 4.1, although it hardly occurred at pH 5.3 to 9.7. It is considered to be caused by chemical interaction between carboxylic groups on the citrate stabilizer and hydroxyl groups of the ITO surface. The adsorption isotherm of the IrO2 colloid onto the ITO surface was analyzed by a Langmuir adsorption isotherm to provide the maximum coverage and an adsorption equilibrium constant Gamma(max) = 1.1 x 10(-8) mol cm(-2) and K-ads = 1.8 x 10(4) M-1 at 25 degrees C, respectively. The K-ads value increased from 6.7 x 10(3) to 1.8 x 10(4) M-1 with a temperature increase from 5 to 25 degrees C. The temperature dependence of K-ads gave Delta H degrees = 36.5 kJ mol(-1), Delta G degrees = -24.4 kJ mol(-1), and Delta S degrees = 204 J mol(-1) K-1 at 25 degrees C. The positive Delta H degrees and Delta S degrees values are explained by the rearrangement of solvating water molecules and counter cations surrounding the IrO2 colloid that is involved in its assembly on the ITO surface. In electrocatalytic water oxidation, the maximum turnover frequency of the IrO2 catalyst was 23 600 h(-1) under potential static conditions at 1.3 V versus Ag/AgCl.									61	1	0	0	4	0	61			1932-7447			WOS:000253784400043		
J	POULSON, SR; KUBILIUS, WP; OHMOTO, H								GEOCHEMICAL BEHAVIOR OF SULFUR IN GRANITOIDS DURING INTRUSION OF THE SOUTH MOUNTAIN BATHOLITH, NOVA-SCOTIA, CANADA								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				55	12			3809	3830		10.1016/0016-7037(91)90076-H				DEC 1991	1991	A detailed stable isotope (S, O) and elemental (major, trace, S content) study of peraluminous S-type granites and granodiorites of the South Mountain Batholith and the Meguma Group metasediments into which the batholith was intruded has been conducted on a regional and local scale near Mt. Uniacke. Sulfur contents of the metasediments range from 5 to 2440 ppm, and delta-S-34 ranges from -3.7 to +26.3 parts per thousand. Sulfur contents of the igneous rocks range from 6 to 570 ppm, with the granites (almost-equal-to 20 ppm) having lower sulfur contents than the granodiorites (almost-equal-to 300 ppm). Approximately 30 to 60% of the sulfur in the granodiorites is present as pyrrhotite (a late phase), with most of the remainder being present as sulfur substituted into biotite (an early phase). delta-O-18Quartz values of the Mt. Uniacke granodiorites are heavy (almost-equal-to +12.2 parts per thousand) indicating formation of the magmas by partial melting of sedimentary rocks. Major element variations suggest that the granites are related to the granodiorites by fractional crystallization of plagioclase, quartz, and biotite. Comparison of the sulfur contents of the granodiorites with experimental determinations of sulfur solubility suggest that the distribution coefficient of sulfur (D(s)) between the cumulate and the magma during fractional crystallization almost-equal-to 4. The regional granodiorites have a relatively restricted range of delta-S-34 values (+5.4 to +8.4 parts per thousand), while the regional granites have a wide range of delta-S-34 values (+1.6 to +15.0 parts per thousand). Granodiorites at Mt. Uniacke with normal magmatic values (+0.76 to +1.42 parts per thousand) for DELTA-O-18 (Quartz-Feldspar) have delta-S-34 values between +6.6 and +12.3 parts per thousand, and show good negative correlations between delta-S-34 and S, FeO, and MgO contents. Some granodiorites at Mt. Uniacke have anomalously low sulfur contents for their major element composition, and DELTA-O-18 (Quartz-Feldspar) values (-0.45 to +0.67 parts per thousand) indicate that these samples have undergone hydrothermal alteration, and this alteration event is probably responsible for the low sulfur contents.A number of processes have been considered in order to understand the variations of delta-S-34. Partial melting of inhomogeneous source rocks may be responsible for some of the regional delta-S-34 variations, but this implies that the granites are not genetically related to the granodiorites. Inhomogeneous source rocks are an unlikely explanation for the systematic variations of delta-S-34 observed over only a few kilometres at Mt. Uniacke. Rayleigh fractionation accompanying the fractional crystallization of biotite [DELTA-S-34(pyrrhotite-S - silicate-S) almost-equal-to +0.5 to +1.0 parts per thousand] can account for only a small component of the observed delta-S-34 variations. The assimilation of isotopically variable sulfur derived from the Meguma Group metasediments during fractional crystallization (combined assimilation-fractional crystallization, or AFC) provides the best explanation for the delta-S-34 variations. Transfer of sulfur from the country rock may have been possible by either bulk AFC (where all of the country rock material is incorporated into the magma) or by selective AFC (where sulfur and other volatile elements only are transferred from the country rock into the magma). Selective AFC could have been effected by a stoping mechanism of intrusion, followed by the heating of country rock xenoliths to the point where extensive desulfidation reactions took place, with sulfur being transferred from the country rock to the magma by a fluid phase.									28	1	0	0	1	0	29			0016-7037			WOS:A1991GX54900027

However, nitrogen vacancy control is extremely challenging with the majority of reports representing it as a few vacancies. Herein, for the first time, the amorphous CN (ACN) with two N-2 C-site vacancies in one CN unit is prepared by a one-step H-2 plasma approach. First-principles calculations , experimental results provide consistent evidence that two N-2 C vacancies are located in one CN unit structure after amorphous transformation. Plasma-induced ACN is stable with a hierarchical continuous nanosheet network structure and exhibits an ul-trahigh specific surface area of ~405.76 m(2)g(-1), which is 83 times higher than that of pristine CN (4.89 m(2)g(-1)) and significantly enhanced photocatalytic H2O2 production, yielding 1874 mu molg(-1)h(-1). Besides, the existence potential drop of 2.61 eV for the electrostatic potential in ACN is key to charge carrier separation. Moreover, the amorphous transformation leads to a new strong band tail, which remarkably enhances the absorbance edge of ACN up to 593 nm, resulting in a wider range of visible-light absorption to enhance H2O2 production. The results have provided an effective approach for promoting the practical application of ACN in photocatalytic H2O2 production.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000802138300004

The as-prepared AgI/I-BiOAc S-scheme photocatalyst with the optimized ratio of Ag/Bi at 0.8 exhibited superior visible-light photocatalytic performance for the degradation of methyl violet (MV), methyl orange (MO), malachite green (MG), and colorless bisphenol A (BPA), which was better than AgI, BiOAc, I-BiOAc-0.4, and even AgI/BiOAc heterojunction. Mott-Schottky analysis indicated that the formation of I-BiOAc solid solutions with suitable I content could optimize energy band structure, which transformed type-I AgI/BiOAc heterojunction to typical S-scheme AgI/I-BiOAc photocatalyst. Furthermore, owing to in situ preparation of AgI/I-BiOAc, the as-prepared S-scheme photocatalyst possessed closely contacted interfaces, which is beneficial to the transfer and recombination of electrons and holes with low redox ability, thus maintaining charge carriers with high redox capacity. The S-scheme mechanism was further verified by electron spin resonance (ESR) and the radicals trapping experiments. This work provides a facile way to design S-scheme system by modulating the composition of the solid solutions.									66	8	0	0	7	0	67			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000474530600044

SEM and TEM observations confirmed the successful synthesis of this specially designed nanostructure, in which the conductive substrate ensures very fast electron transfer during the charge-discharge process, whereas the 3D hierarchical structure facilitates rapid ion transfer. The ultrathin LDH nanoflakes (3-5 nm) expose their abundant active sites to the electrolyte, thus generating huge pseudocapacitance. Combining the abovementioned features, this specially designed 3D nanostructured hybrid possesses an exceptional specific capacitance (2395 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)), excellent rate performance (retaining 71.8% of capacitance at the current density of 20 A g(-1)), and remarkable cycling stability (99.6% retention after 10 000 cycles). Moreover, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor obtained using GP@LDH as a positive electrode and GP-derived carbon as a negative electrode exhibits an ultrahigh energy density of 94.4 W h kg(-1) at the power density of 463.1 W kg(-1), making GP@LDH very attractive as an electrode material for high performance and low-cost supercapacitors.									46	2	0	0	3	0	47			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000401316100017

The phase structure, surface morphology and capacitive properties of the electrodes annealed at different temperatures were analyzed in detail. The electrodes annealed at 370 degrees C had the largest area of the cyclic voltammogram, the smallest Zim, the minimum relaxation time, and the largest specific capacitance of 382.9 F/g, which was lager than those of IrO2-SnO2 and IrO2-Ta2O5. The conducive nanocrystalline particles was homogeneously distributed in the amorphous matrix, which could greatly improve the conductivity of electrons in coatings, but it did not sacrifice the conductivity of protons. Ti/IrO2-SnO2-Ta(2)O(5 )electrodes prepared at 370 degrees C and Ti/RuO2-NiO electrode prepared in the same way were assembled to be a supercapacitor, which provided energy density of 12.8wh kg(-1) and 1.86wh kg(-1) respectively and the power density of 29w kg(-1) and 252.7w kg(-1). The energy density and power density in acidic solution could be detected without using binder materials. The prepared method was simple, economical and did not require binder which provided a possibility for the large-scale industrial production of pseudocapacitor.									13	1	0	0	0	0	14			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000537570200054

The 3 molecular forms of SOD were distinguished from each other by their different sensitivities to cyanide and H2O2. In leaves of the susceptible cultivar (cv. Caturra), one Mn-SOD, one Fe-SOD, and one Cu,Zn-SOD were found, and Fe-SOD was the most abundant isozyme (about 50 % of the total SOD activity). In coffee leaves from the resistant cultivar (cv. Colombia), two additional Cu,Zn-SODs were present. The appearance of new Cu,Zn-SOD isoenzymes could be related to the manifestation of resistance against fungal infection. The identification of Fe-SOD in a species belonging to the plant family Rubiaceae extends the small number of higher plants where the presence of these Fe-containing metalloenzymes has been demonstrated. Results obtained may be useful from an evolutionary viewpoint and also in oxy-radical studies in plants dealing with defence mechanisms against fungal infection.									22	0	0	0	21	1	23			0176-1617			WOS:A1993LF78700002

However, many of them suffer from some drawbacks like the inability to visible light irradiation and wide band gaps. Herein, we have synthesized monophasic strontium (Sr) doped SnO2 nanoparticles by a cost-effective and environmental friendly hydrothermal method. As-synthesized nanoparticles showed rutile crystalline structure with irregular and rough cubical shape and no other elemental impurities. Sr-doped SnO2 nanoparticles show a constant decrease in bandgap with increasing dopant concentration, which is estimated for excellent photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic water splitting of as-prepared Sr-doped SnO2 nanoparticles for H-2 generation shows a large influence of the increasing dopant concentration related to the narrowing bandgap on H-2 generation rate. Hence, the tunable bandgap with adjusted dopant concentration indicates that band gap tuning through doping for produced nanostructures may open up a new opportunities for photocatalytic and other optoelectronic applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000810733800001	35580560

Generation and detection of single metal nanoparticles using scanning electrochemical microscopy techniques								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B				110	50			25279	25287		10.1021/jp064434d				DEC 21 2006	2006	Different pathways towards the generation and detection of a single metal nanoparticle (MNP) on a conductive carbon support for testing as an electrocatalyst are described. Various approaches were investigated including interparticle distance enhancement, electrochemical and mechanical tip-substrate MNP transfer onto macroscopic surfaces, scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM)-controlled electrodeposition, and the use of selective binding monolayers on carbon fiber electrodes (CFEs) for solution-phase-selective adsorption. A novel SECM technique for electrodepositing MNPs on CFE tips immersed 100-200 nm below the electrolyte level was developed and used to generate single Pt and Ni nanoparticles. Following their generation, we demonstrate electrocatalytic detection of Fe3+ on individual Pt particles with the CFE in a Fe3+/H2SO4 solution. We also describe an approach of attaching MNPs to CFEs by controlling the composition of monolayers bonded to the CFE. By employing a monolayer with a low ratio of binding (e. g., 4-aminopyridine) to nonbinding molecules (e. g., aniline) and controlling the position of the CFE in a colloidal Pt solution with a SECM, we attached a single 15 nm radius Pt nanoparticle to the CFE. Such chemisorbed Pt particles exhibited a stronger adhesion on surface-modified CFEs and better mechanical stability during proton reduction than MNPs electrodeposited directly on the CFE.									54	1	0	0	7	0	56			1520-6106	1520-5207		WOS:000242825400019	17165973

Here, we use advanced characterizations combined with density functional theory to elucidate the origin of K-modulated facet and defect in SrTiO3 nanoparticles, thereby affecting the photocatalytic activities in overall water splitting. We found that the differences in binding strength between K2CO3 and different facets led to the exposure of nonequivalent facets. Based on the facet engineering, we demonstrated that the K-doping process consisted of filling and substitution process, and the lowest defect concentration existed at their intersection and with a maximum bending degree of surface energy band between {100} and {110} facets. The optimized 3%K-doped SrTiO3 composites have an intrinsic activity comparable to state-of-the-art catalysts.

J	Zhao, Liandang; Han, Jinsheng; Lu, Wanjian; Liang, Pei; Jourdan, Fred								The Middle Permian Hongshanliang Manto-type copper deposit in the East Tianshan: Constraints from geology, geochronology, fluid inclusions and H-O-S isotopes								ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS				124						103601	10.1016/j.oregeorev.2020.103601				SEP 2020	2020	The Hongshanliang copper deposit, hosted in the tuff of the Lower Carboniferous Yamansu Formation, is a typical copper deposit in the Aqishan-Yamansu belt, East Tianshan. Based on crosscutting relationships of veins, textural relationships and mineral assemblages, five alteration/mineralization stages at Hongshanliang have been established: chlorite-sulfide stage (Stage I), quartz-pyrite stage (Stage II), quartz-polymetallic sulfide stage (Stage III), late veins (Stage IV) and supergene process (Stage V).Stage I has mineral assemblage of chlorite-pyrite +/- chalcopyrite +/- quartz +/- sericite, and is commonly characterized by euhedral pyrite with silicates (e.g., chlorite, quartz and sericite) and/or chalcopyrite as its pressure shadow, indicating an early mineralization event with apparent deformation. Stage II is characterized by quartz-pyrite +/- chalcopyrite or locally quartz +/- gypsum +/- anhydrite +/- pyrite veins cutting Stage I chlorite-pyrite. The main mineralization stage (Stage III) at Hongshanliang has typical mineral assemblages of quartz-chalcopyrite +/- chlorite +/- calcite +/- sericite, quartz-chalcopyrite-sphalerite-galena +/- pyrite and quartz-sphalerite-galena +/- chlorite, with veins, veinlets, disseminations and local massive ore types, similar to Manto-type copper deposits regarding mineralization and ore structures. Detailed fluid inclusion study shows temperature of fluids decreased from Stage II (307-484 degrees C) through Stage III (peak at 160-180 degrees C, consistent with quartz-chlorite oxygen isotope geothermometer of 190 degrees C) to Stage IV (129-169 degrees C), with corresponding salinities of 2.7-26.2 wt% NaCl equiv. (peak at 8 wt%), 2.1-12.3 wt% NaCl equiv. (peak at 8 wt%) and 0.5-7.7 wt% NaCl equiv. (peaks at 4-6 wt%), respectively, indicating an evolved hydrothermal ore-forming system. Such fluid evolution can also be supported by H-O isotopes during water-rock reaction from Stage II (delta O-18(fluid) = 6.3-8.3 parts per thousand and delta D-fluid = -77 parts per thousand to -64 parts per thousand) through Stage III (delta O-18(fluid) = - 1.7 parts per thousand to 7.0 parts per thousand and delta D-fluid = - 82 parts per thousand to - 58 parts per thousand) to Stage IV (delta O-18(fluid) = - 2.5 parts per thousand to - 2.1 parts per thousand and delta D-fluid = - 77 parts per thousand to - 73 parts per thousand) with a magmatic-hydrothermal origin. Furthermore, sulfur isotopes suggest that fluids of the two mineralization stages (Stage I and III) are predominantly magmatic-hydrothermal, with other influx contribution into the oreforming system, i.e., minor Early Carboniferous seawater in Stage I (delta S-34(fluid) varying from - 3.5 parts per thousand to 6.1 parts per thousand, with peak at 0 parts per thousand) and minor organic materials in Stage III (d34Sfluid varying from - 6.5 parts per thousand to 4.1 parts per thousand, with peak at 0-1 parts per thousand, and detection of CH4 and C2H6 from fluid inclusions).In combination of alteration, paragenesis, nature and source of ore-forming fluids and comparison with other typical deposits, we proposed that the Hongshanliang copper deposit underwent two mineralization events with the main mineralization similar to Manto-type copper deposits. Ar-40/Ar-39 dating of sericite from a massive chalcopyrite ore indicates the Hongshanliang main mineralization formed at 269.0 +/- 0.4 Ma, generally coeval with regional K-feldspar granite emplacement (ca. 272 Ma). Integrating the regional tectonic setting, magmatism and metallogenesis of the Aqishan-Yamansu belt and the East Tianshan, we suggest that the Aqishan-Yamansu belt has potential of mineral prospecting for the Middle Permian Manto-type copper deposits.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0169-1368	1872-7360		WOS:000564289000002

However, despite their pharmacological importance, structural information remains bereft. To further our understanding behind their biochemistry and diversity, we used ancestral-sequence reconstruction, kinetic and crystallographic techniques to scrutinize three ancient mammalian FMOs: AncFMO2, AncFMO3-6 and AncFMO5. Remarkably, all AncFMOs could be crystallized and were structurally resolved between 2.7- and 3.2-angstrom resolution. These crystal structures depict the unprecedented topology of mammalian FMOs. Each employs extensive membrane-binding features and intricate substrate-profiling tunnel networks through a conspicuous membrane-adhering insertion. Furthermore, a glutamate-histidine switch is speculated to induce the distinctive Baeyer-Villiger oxidation activity of FMO5. The AncFMOs exhibited catalysis akin to human FMOs and, with sequence identities between 82% and 92%, represent excellent models. Our study demonstrates the power of ancestral-sequence reconstruction as a strategy for the crystallization of proteins.									25	1	0	0	21	0	26			1545-9993	1545-9985		WOS:000507770200007	31873300

The application of pulsed laser irradiation to aqueous TiO2 suspensions (first approach) induced structural transformations both on the bulk and on the surface of TiO2, boosting the H-2 production, under UV light irradiation, of almost three times (20.9 mmol/g(ca)(t).h) compared to bare TiO2 (7.7 mmol/g(cat).h). The second strategy was based on a templating method to obtain TiO2 with a macroporous structure to favour an efficient light absorption process inside the material pores, thus allowing a high H-2 production (0.64 mmol/g(cat).h) under solar light irradiation. This performance was further enhanced when the macroporous TiO2 was coupled with CeO2 or W (third approach). In the latter case the H-2 production increased to 0.72 mmol/g(cat).h for macroporous TiO2-CeO2 and to 0.82 mmol/g(cat).h for macroporous TiO2-W. This work highlights how it is possible to tune the TiO2 photocatalytic properties with easy and green procedures to obtain environmental friendly catalyst for hydrogen production.

Catalysts powders obtained were characterized using different physico-chemical techniques (X-ray scattering, transmission electron microscopy, N-2 physisorption and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) in order to deeply characterize their morphostructural properties. Electrochemical measurements performed with cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques have shown that these catalysts were liable to surface modifications induced by the applied electrode potential. These surface structural modifications as well as their effect on the electroactivity of the catalyst towards the OER in alkaline medium are discussed. The activated NiCo2O4-delta material showed particularly excellent catalytic ability towards the OER in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. In this material Co(iv) is found to be the active species in the catalyst composition for the OER. It exhibits an overpotential as low as 390 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This catalytic activity is especially high since the oxide loading is only of 0.074 mg cm(-2). Furthermore, this anode catalyst showed high stability during an accelerated durability test of 1500 voltammetric cycles.									73	1	0	0	3	0	73			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000359459900059

At about the same time there was much increased interest in oxynitrides, stimulated by Professor K. Jack in the UK and Y. Oyama in Japan. Following these activities a major research program in this area was initiated at the Army Materials and Mechanics Research Center in Watertown, Massachusetts in 1974. These efforts resulted in the first complete Al2O3-AIN phase equilibrium diagram and a process to reactively sinter to nearly full density, translucent aluminum oxynitride spinel ceramic, which was named AlON. Subsequently, the Raytheon Company further developed AlON into a highly transparent material (ALON (TM)) with many applications including transparent armor and EM domes and windows, among others-the technology was recently transferred to the Surmet Corporation. This paper will review the early history, phase equilibrium, crystal chemistry, and properties of this material, along with more recent work in our laboratory on transient liquid phase sintering and new data on lattice parameter measurements. In addition, recent results of collaborative work on AlON's dynamic mechanical properties using plate impact, Kolsky bar and edge-on impact (EoI) experimental techniques, including preliminary modeling at the microstructural scale of AlON in the EoI test, will be presented.

This study reports the use of environmentally benign graphene-based photocatalysts to effectively reform sugar and glucose. We produce a catalyst consisting of sulfur and nitrogen codoped graphene oxide dots (SNGODs) by sequentially annealing graphite-derived graphene oxide with sulfur and ammonia, exfoliating the annealed product into dots, and autoclaving the dots in an ammonia solution. The codoping introduces quaternary nitrogen into the graphene basal plane to patch the vacancy defects and autoclaving creates a conjugation between nitrogen nonbonding states and the graphitic- orbital by introducing peripheral amide and amino groups. These functionalization steps enlarge the electron resonance domain, narrowing the bandgap and inducing charge delocalization and separation. Here, SNGODs deposited with a Pt cocatalyst effectively catalyzed H-2 production from aqueous solutions of sugar and glucose under visible light irradiation for more than 80 h. The apparent quantum yields of reforming of sugar and glucose reach 11% and 7.4%, respectively, under 420 nm monochromatic irradiation. This pioneer study demonstrates the superiority of using carbon-based photocatalysts for biomass reforming and provides a structure-tuning strategy for enhancing the catalytic activity.									21	1	0	0	2	0	21			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000464414200039

In the last 20 years, the development of voltage-modulated scanning probe microscopy techniques, exemplified by Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and associated time-and voltage spectroscopies, opened a pathway to explore these materials on a singledigit nanometer level. Consequently, domain structures and walls and polarization dynamics can now be imaged in real space. More generally, PFM has allowed studying electromechanical coupling in a broad variety of materials ranging from ionics to biological systems. It can also be anticipated that the recent Nobel prize ["The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2016," http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2016/(Nobel Media, 2016)] in molecular electromechanical machines will result in rapid growth in interest in PFM as a method to probe their behavior on single device and device assembly levels. However, the broad introduction of PFM also resulted in a growing number of reports on the nearly ubiquitous presence of ferroelectric-like phenomena including remnant polar states and electromechanical hysteresis loops in materials which are non-ferroelectric in the bulk or in cases where size effects are expected to suppress ferroelectricity. While in certain cases plausible physical mechanisms can be suggested, there is remarkable similarity in observed behaviors, irrespective of the materials system. In this review, we summarize the basic principles of PFM, briefly discuss the features of ferroelectric surfaces salient to PFM imaging and spectroscopy, and summarize existing reports on ferroelectric-like responses in non-classical ferroelectric materials. We further discuss possible mechanisms behind observed behaviors and possible experimental strategies for their identification.									197	6	0	0	10	1	200			1931-9401			WOS:000402488200006

In practice, however, it is hardly realized due to technical difficulty. Utilizing the directed transfer of photocarriers in BiVO4 single crystal with crystal-facet exposure, in this work, a mass-transfer control approach is developed for selective photodeposition of well dispersed AuPd cocatalysts to boost photocatalytic H2O2 production. The as-obtained BiVO4 (01 0)-AuPd photocatalysts exhibit improved photocatalytic activity for H2O2 production compared with BiVO4 (01 0)-Au (1.15 mmol L-1) and BiVO4 (01 0)-Pd (1.37 mmol L-1). Therein, the optimum BiVO4 (01 0)-AuPd photocatalyst (the mass ratio of Au to Pd for 19:1) presents the highest H2O2 production (2.29 mmol L-1 in 2 h under 420 nm light irradiation) and the corresponding AQE value is 11.38 %. In the case, the synergistic effect of electronic effects and geometric effects for the well-dispersed AuPd nanoalloy cocatalysts contribute to excellent activity and selectivity for two-electron O-2 reduction to H2O2 and thus boost the photocatalytic H2O2 production of BiVO4. The present work also provides an insight into the modification of well-dispersed nanoalloy cocatalysts for photocatalytic H2O2 production.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000799991700003

In this paper, we demonstrate the development of cobalt nitride nanowire array on Ti mesh(Co3N NW/TM) as an efficient catalyst electrode for glucose oxidation in alkaline solutions and H2O2 reduction in neutral solutions. Electrochemical tests suggest that such Co3N NW/TM possesses superior non-enzymatic sensing ability toward rapid glucose and H2O2 detection. As a glucose sensor, this fabricated electrode offers a high sensitivity of 3325.6 mu A mM(-1)cm(- 2), with a wide linear range from 0.1 mu M to 2.5 mM, a low detection limit of 50 nM (S/N = 3), and satisfactory stability and reproducibility. Its application in determining glucose in human blood serum is also successful. Amperometric H2O2 sensing canalso been realized with a sensitivity of 139.9 mu A mM(-1)cm(-2), a linear range from 2 mu M to 28 mM, and adetection limit of 1 mu M (S/N = 3).

Chen, Qianjin/B-1425-2012; Chen, Qianjin/AAA-4936-2022	Luo, Long/0000-0001-5771-6892			Electrochemical Generation of a Hydrogen Bubble at a Recessed Platinum Nanopore Electrode								LANGMUIR				31	15			4573	4581		10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b00234				APR 21 2015	2015	We report the eleetrochemical generation of a single hydrogen bubble within the cavity of a recessed Pt nanopore electrode. The recessed Pt electrode is a conical pore in glass that contains a micrometer-scale Pt disk (1-10 mu m radius) at the nanopore base and a nanometer-scale orifice (10-100 nm radius) that restricts diffusion of electroactive molecules and dissolved gas between the nanopore cavity and bulk solution. The formation of a H-2 bubble at the Pt disk electrode in voltammetric experiments results from the reduction of H+ in a 0.25 M H2SO4 solution; the liquid-togas phase transformation is indicated in the voltammetric response by a precipitous decrease in the cathodic current due to rapid bubble nucleation and growth within the nanopore cavity. Finite element simulations of the concentration distribution of dissolved H-2 within the nanopore cavity, as a function of the H+ reduction current, indicate that H-2 bubble nucleation at the recessed Pt electrode surface occurs at a critical supersaturation concentration of similar to 0.22 M, in agreement with the value previously obtained at (nonrecessed) Pt disk electrodes (similar to 0.25 M). Because the nanopore orifice limits the diffusion of H-2, out of the nanopore cavity, an anodic peak corresponding to the oxidation of gaseous and dissolved H-2 trapped in the recessed cavity is readily observed on the reverse voltammetric scan. Integration of the charge associated with the H-2 oxidation peak is found to approach that of the H+ reduction peak at high scan rates, confirming the assignment of the anodic peak to H-2 oxidation. Preliminary results for the electrochemical generation of O-2 bubbles from water oxidation at a recessed nanopore electrode are consistent with the electrogeneration of H-2 bubbles.									68	3	0	0	8	0	70			0743-7463			WOS:000353429300025	25811080

The haemolytic activity of Cumaside was significantly reduced in comparison with original glycosides due to the glycoside-cholesterol complex formation. The influence of Cumaside on mouse macrophages in low doses was accompanied by more then two-fold stimulation of lysosomal activity. This preparation was found to increase significantly the animal resistance against bacterial infections elicited by various pathogens. It stimulated phagocytosis, ROS formation, IL6 and TNF-alpha production in lymphocytes, increased the number of antibody producing cells and amplified the expression of several cell surface molecules (CD3, CD4, CD8) preliminary cultured with hydrocortisone. At the same time the preparation did not affect the delayed-type hypersensitivity, proliferative activity of lymphocytes, cytotoxic activity of NK-cells and cytokine IFN gamma and IL12p70 release. The mechanism of Cumaside action is discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									38	17	2	0	24	0	58			1567-5769			WOS:000238155900005	16714210

Their efficiency is influenced by many variables, among which the chemical nature of the stabilizer oxide plays a considerable role. In this paper, morphology, microstructure, and electrocatalytic properties of supported RuO2-SnO2 thin films, prepared in a wide compositional range, were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and cyclic voltammetry (CV). X-ray analysis indicates an immiscibility zone for the two oxides approximately in the range 20-70 atom % of Sn nominal amounts. In both solubility regions, a tetragonal phase (rutile-type) is formed. Peak profile analysis indicates a nonequiaxial crystal growth and shows that in solid solutions where RuO2 is the major component larger crystallites (about 100-160 Angstrom) are formed than in those where SnO2 is the major component (about 30 Angstrom). STM characterization reveals a rough surface with a complex microstructure: very large agglomerates, which seems to be made up of a large number of smaller units with sizes of the same order of magnitude found by XRD. Only in the sample with 70 atom % of Sn (nominal amounts) there exists regions where the small units are clearly visible as distinct particles. The CV analysis shows that the highest electrocatalytic activity is exhibited by the latter sample, which has the highest possible content of RuO2 before it forms a solid solution in SnO2 and where particles tend not to form aggregates.

Here we used electrospinning to homogeneously embed graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets within the one-dimensional structure of cobalt-based nano hybrids (CoNHs). In particular, we focus on the performance of these nanohybrids in Na2S/Na2SO3 aqueous electrolyte (pH = 13) due to its wide application in photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices. We demonstrate that the addition of GO can remarkably reduce the charge transfer resistance from 4.452 to 2.552 for the 0 wt% GO/CoNHs and the 12 wt% GO/CoNHs, respectively. Furthermore, the CoNHs display outstanding electrochemical long-term stability, as the overpotential required to keep J =- 10 mA cm(-2) is invariable for over 42 h. The structural characterization of the nanohybrids indicates that during continuous operation, the CoNHs rebuild and regenerate in situ leading to the formation of two-dimensional nanostructures comprising a mixture of cobalt chalcogenides (Co3S4 and CoS2). The integration of the CoNHs in a quantum-dot based PEC cell and an alkaline electrolyzer (1 M KOH) demonstrates the versatility and viability of these alternative electrodes toward active and solar-driven fuel generation.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000467661700016

Water is found to interact weakly with beta-Ni(OH)(2)(001), but strongly with beta-NiOOH(001). As unveiled with the use of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, surface water layers at beta-NiOOH(001) show a high degree of ordering correlated with a large surface polarization effect. In comparison, interfacial water at beta-Ni(OH)(2)(001) exhibits enhanced disorder and higher mobility. The weak interaction of water with beta-Ni(OH)(2)(001) is consistent with the small dipole moment of this surface. On the surface of beta-NiOOH(001), in addition to the significantly increased surface dipole moment, unsaturated O atoms increase the number of hydrogen bonds between water molecules and the surface, resulting in strong water binding. The wettability trends found in this simulation study are consistent with experimental observations. Another theoretical observation is the increased work function of beta-NiOOH(001) relative to beta-Ni(OH)(2)(001) that agrees with experimental results reported in the literature.									22	1	0	0	1	0	22			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000408671600005	28796270

Among the different ways of converting solar energy into fuels and chemicals, photoelectrochemical tandem cells, containing two photoactive materials, stand out as they have the potential for direct solar-to-fuel conversion, thus minimizing cost. The implementation of photoelectrolysis for hydrogen generation is hindered by the lack of suitable electrode materials, particularly photocathodes. Among the candidates for photocathodes, ternary (and multinary) transition metal oxides have the advantage of lower cost and, potentially, higher stability than other metal compounds. Herein, the aim is to provide an overview of the current state of the art for ternary oxides (spinels, delafossites, perovskites, etc.), with a focus on the modification strategies that can optimize their behavior and applicability. Both copper-based and iron-based ternary oxides are the most studied and, currently, the most promising. Among the strategies being used for their optimization, doping, the deposition of underlayers and overlayers, and the use of cocatalysts are the most popular. However, it is apparent that both solar-to-hydrogen efficiencies and stability will need to be addressed in the future. Some guidelines in this respect are also provided.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2367-198X			WOS:000742501800001

The crystal structure, morphology and chemical composition of these Mg doped CuMnO2 samples were comprehensively characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The crystalline size of Mg doped CuMnO2 nanosheets decreased with increasing of Mg dopant concentration, especially the thickness around 10 nm for 5% Mg doped CuMnO2 nanosheets, which is much thinner than undoped CuMnO2 nanocrystals. Moreover, the effects of Mg2+ doping on the optical and electrical properties of these Mg doped CuMnO2 samples were further studied. These Mg doped CuMnO2 samples show a high absorptance in UV-Vis region and good electrical conductivity at room temperature, which indicates these Mg doped CuMnO2 samples have a promising potential applications as a solar absorber material. The facile fabrication process, tunable crystalline size, excellent optical absorption and electrical properties of these Mg doped CuMnO2 nanosheets are encouraging for the development of future applications in optoelectronic devices.									6	3	0	0	0	0	8			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000516413000002

The structure, morphology, textural and optical properties were characterized by X-ray diffraction, N-2-physisorption, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV-vis analysis and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The catalytic properties of Bi2O2CO3/porous g-C3N4 composites were assessed using tetracycline hydrochloride under simulated solar light illumination. When the loading amount of Bi2O2CO3 was 2 wt%, the composite showed the highest catalytic activity, which was 5.1 times that of porous g-C3N4 nanosheets (PCNS). The enhanced photocatalytic properties of Bi2O2CO3/porous g-C3N4 may be attributed to the formation of heterojunction between Bi2O2CO3 and PCNS, resulting in the effective separation of photogenerated carriers and enhanced absorption of visible light. Furthermore, the novel photocatalyst had an excellent catalytic stability and could be recycled for five times without distinct loss of catalytic activity.

However, pristine g-C3N4 suffers from a high recombination rate of photo-generated charge carriers and also has a limited visible-light absorption range, resulting in low photocatalytic activity. Herein, we report on the preparation and testing of a g-C3N4 photocatalyst with tunable nitrogen defects that delivered improved photocatalytic activity. The nitrogen defects were gradually introduced into the g-C3N4 framework by a selenium vapor treatment of pure g-C3N4, which resulted in improved, stable catalytic activity for photocatalytic hydrogen production. Based on the experimental results and DFT calculations, we proposed that the enhanced photoactivity is attributed to the defect state (DS) formed by the nitrogen vacancy (VN) in the unit cell of g-C3N4 and a small widening of visible light absorption. This nitrogen-based photocatalyst with nitrogen deficiencies was found to deliver an average hydrogen generation rate of 1.16 mmol g(-1) h(-1) at room temperature (25 degrees C), which was 3.4 times greater than pristine g-C3N4. This process of introducing nitrogen defects into the graphitic carbon provides a promising way for enhancing the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4-based materials for hydrogen production.									22	4	0	0	4	0	22			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000459458600065

The PEC performance of the photoanodes was investigated for various ZnS thicknesses and GaN doping concentrations. The photocurrent density of the ZnS/GaN photoanode at zero bias was enhanced by a factor of 1.75 compared to that for the reference GaN structure. Furthermore, significantly enhanced photoanode stability was observed with the optimized ZnS coating. The high performance of the ZnS/GaN photoanode is attributed to the type-II band alignment of the heterojunction, which forms a potential barrier for electron injection to the electrolyte while facilitating hole transfer. Therefore, using a ZnS cocatalyst coated on GaN is a promising technique to fabricate photoanodes for PEC-based solar energy harvesting. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we report the enhanced lifetime of RuOx-TiO2 composite anodes that was achieved by optimizing the fabrication conditions (e.g., the Ru mole fraction, total metal content, and calcination time). The electrode durability was assessed through accelerated service lifetime tests conducted under harsh environmental conditions, by using 3.4% NaCl and 1.0 A/cm(2). The electrochemical characteristics of the anodes prepared with metal oxides having different compositions were evaluated using cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and X-ray analyses. We noticed that, the larger the Ru mole fraction, the more durable were the electrodes. The RuOx-TiO2 electrodes were found to be highly stable when the Ru mole fraction was >0.7. The 0.8RuO(x)-0.2TiO(2) electrode was selected as the one with the most appropriate composition, considering both its stability and contaminant treatability. The electrodes that underwent a 7-h calcination (between 1 and 10 h) showed the longest lifetime under the tested conditions, because of the formation of a stable Ru oxide structure (i.e., RuO3) and a lower resistance to charge transfer. The electrode deactivation mechanism that occurred due to the dissolution of active catalysts over time was evidenced by an impedance analysis of the electrode itself and surface elemental mapping.

Thus, treating water contaminated with chlorpyrifos is important. In our previous studies, novel Ti/IrO2 SnO2 anode was successfully developed for electrochemical degradation of chlorpyrifos in chloride free water. In this study, optimization of previously developed Ti/IrO2 SnO2 anode for mineralization of chlorpyrifos was successfully performed through response surface methodology. During the optimization study, two-level factorial design was used to determine the optimal coating solutions concentration for developing the Ti/IrO2 SnO2 anode. Cyclic voltammetry and open circuit potential were performed to investigate the electrochemically active surface area and stability of these anodes. The response surface and contour plots show that 0.3 M of [Ir] and 7.5 mM of [Sn] coated electrode has both highest anodic charge and stability. Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) images show the evidence of having both compact and porous regions in the surface of the thin film, resulting larger surface area. Within 6 h, the best result for mineralization (55.56%) of chlorpyrifos was obtained with 0.3 M of [Ir] and 7.5 mM of [Sn] coated anode using Total organic Carbon (TOC) analyzer. Therefore, the optimum coating concentration was found as 0.3 M of [Ir] and 7.5 mM of [Sn]. It would require an energy consumption of 6 kWhm(-3).					7th International Conference on Key Engineering Materials (ICKEM)7th International Conference on Key Engineering Materials (ICKEM)	MAR 11-13, 2017MAR 11-13, 2017		MALAYSIAMALAYSIA	5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1757-8981		*****************	WOS:000422900700040

Extensive research of the last years is focused on increasing stability of the catalyst composite, however a comprehensive understanding is still lacking. In pursuing this fundamentally and practically very important objective we present a comparative corrosion study of a PtCu3 nano-alloy system by investigating the effects of structural ordering and gold doping. For that purpose a recently developed electrochemical flow cell (EFC) coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) is employed. This approach provides potential- and time-resolved insight into dissolution process at extremely low concentrations (ppb level). Our results show a structure-dependent copper corrosion, where ordering and gold-doping significantly improve copper retention in the native alloy. Two assumptions can be drawn from the measured Pt dissolution profiles: (i) a better Pt re-deposition efficiency in catalysts with higher porosity and (ii) the beneficial effect of Au surface doping that lowers the amount of dissolved Pt amount and shifts the Pt cathodic dissolution to lower potentials. A 2.6 nm Pt/C standard catalyst with the same carbon loading shows a much lower stability which is due to the well-known particle size effect. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

For readers to have a completed understanding and feel of MSS, both pros and cons of it have been discussed as well. The recent progress in MSS of inorganic metal oxide nanoparticles is reviewed in this article. We start with simple binary oxides and then explain a few technologically important cases of complex metal oxide nanomaterials. This review article also highlights how the MSS method has been successful in synthesizing ABO(2) delafossite, ABO(3) perovskite, AB(2)O(4) spinel and A(2)B(2)O(7) pyrochlore nanomaterials. This review article opens a new avenue for exploring MSS in making size and shape tunable nanomaterials for various catalytic, optoelectronic, magnetic, and electrical applications.									42	0	0	0	2	0	42			0079-6425	1873-2208		WOS:000682800200002

When the cell lysate was incubated at 7 degrees C, the precursor was degraded by proteases of E. coli to a polypeptide of 18 kDa (P18) that consisted of the mature protein moiety plus the last four residues of the transit peptide. P18 was able to reconstitute the water-oxidizing complex of NaCl-treated PSII membranes supplemented with the 23-kDa protein. Moreover, P18 was cleaved by the prolyl endoproteinase of spinach specifically at the Pro-12-Leu-13 bond, as was the authentic 18-kDa protein. These properties of P18 indicate that the present expression system is potentially useful for studies of the substrate specificity of the endoproteinase, as well as of the structure-function relationships of the 18-kDa protein.									1	0	0	0	1	0	3			0032-0781			WOS:A1995QV86600007	7757336

PW/melem was demonstrated to be an outstanding support that can stabilize and disperse small Pd NPs (2 nm), and significantly boost their efficiency for H-2 generation from the dehydrogenation of formic acid (FA). Experimental results and mechanistic investigations indicate that a strong electronic interaction exists between Pd NPs and the PW anions; the PW anions accept electrons from Pd first and, during FA dehydrogenation, the reduced blue PW donates electrons to Pd. Moreover, melem plays an important role in hydrogen transfer and can accelerate H-2 generation. The overall synergistic effect of PW and melem endows Pd NPs with extremely high activity and stability for complete FA conversion at 50 degrees C, achieving a high turnover frequency of 15393 h(-1).									18	0	0	0	3	0	18			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000446981300005	30074681

For water splitting, an efficient and stable water-oxidizing catalyst is important. Ni-Fe (hydr)oxides are among the best catalysts for water oxidation in alkaline electrolytes. An Fe amount higher than 50% in Ni-Fe (hydr)oxides increases the overpotential for water oxidation. Thus, Ni-Fe (hydr)oxides with a high ratio of Fe to Ni have rarely been focused on for water oxidation. Herein, we report water oxidation using nanosized (Ni1-xZnx)Fe2O4. The catalyst was characterized via some methods and tested at pH values of 3, 7 and 11 in phosphate buffer. Nanosized (Ni1-xZnx)Fe(2)O(4 )is a good catalyst for water oxidation only under alkaline conditions. In the next step, amperometry studies showed current densities of 3.50 mA cm(-2) and 11.50 mA cm(-2) at 1.25 V in 0.10 M and 1.0 M KOH solution, respectively. The amperometric measurements indicated high catalyst stability in both 0.10 M and 1.0 M KOH. Tafel plots were obtained in KOH solution at concentrations of both 0.10 M and 1.0 M. At pH = 13 in KOH solution (0.10 M), linearity of lg(j) vs. potential was shown, with two slopes relating to both relatively low (170.9 mV per decade) and high overpotentials (484.2 mV per decade). In 1.0 M KOH solution, the Tafel plot showed linearity of lg(j) vs. potential, with two slopes relating to both relatively low (192.5 mV per decade) and high overpotentials (545.7 mV per decade). After water oxidation, no significant change was observed in the catalyst.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2516-0230			WOS:000479170600027	36132275

Here, we investigate the electronic structures and transport properties of the experimentally achievable FeN4-embedded armchair and zigzag graphene nanoribbons (FeN4-AGNR and FeN4-ZGNR). The first principles results show that FeN4 induces room-temperature stable ferromagnetic ground states in both AGNRs and ZGNRs, but only significant changes in the band structure of the latter, inducing strong current polarization (nearly 100%) and spin-dependent negative differential resistance (NDR) in the FeN4-ZGNR based devices. We find that the performance of the NDR can be easily enhanced by embedding more FeN4 structures. Its peak-to-valley current ratio (PVCR) rises rapidly and reaches 10(4) when only 4 FeN4 structures are used. It is revealed that the localized f electrons of the Fe atom and the p electrons of the C atoms at the ribbon edges have the same spin orientation, resulting in a ferromagnetic ground state with a larger magnetic moment, FeN4 induces conductive states around the Fermi level, which are responsible for the observed NDR, and the quite different conductivity of the frontier orbitals in the spin-down and spin-down systems contributes to the strong current polarization. Such intrinsic properties suggest prospective device applications of the FeN4-ZGNRs in spintronics.									13	1	0	0	2	0	13			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000394940400004	28067932

In this work, CdS nanorods modified with NiS nanoparticles are first prepared to improve the photocatalytic performance, as no H-2 generates on single NiS or CdS catalyst from glucose solution. MoS2 and NiPx, as the cocatalysts for H-2 production, are loaded on the surface of NiS/CdS composite. With step-by-step solvothermal synthesis, four components (CdS, NiS, Mo2S, and NiPx) are fully combined in the NiPx/MoS2/NiS/CdS nanorods, generating many intimate contact interfaces. Moreover the optimized NiPx/MoS2/NiS/CdS performs a significantly increased photocatalytic activity, with H-2 production rate at 297 mu mol h(-1) g(-1). The synergistic effects of heterostructure (NiS/CdS) and cocatalysts (MoS2 and NiPx) are the main reasons in enhancing photocatalytic performance, which facilitate the separation of charge carriers and prolong their lifetimes. This work provides an effective strategy to design photocatalysts with multiple components and fast charge separation for highly efficient H-2 production.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000658789400001

Although the energy storage can be increased in the bulk of the material, it often suffers from a quite slow kinetics, which seriously hinders the rate capability. Keeping high surface-induced capacitive contribution is proposed to address this issue. Herein, a porous scaffold, TiO2 nanotube arrays grown in a Ti foil (TiO2 NTs/Ti) is selected as the current collector for electrodeposition of porous polyaniline/reduced graphene oxide (PANI/rGO) hybrid film. The capacitive contribution of PANI/rGO@TiO2 /Ti is quantitatively evaluated, showing a high surface-induced capacitive contribution up to 58% at high rates (>25 mV s(-1)) and large electron transfer coefficient of 2. As a result, the electrode not only shows an ultrahigh specific capacity of 908 C g(-1) at 1 mV s(-1), but also delivers an outstanding rate capacity of 310 C g(-1) at 500 mV s(-1). PANI/rGO@TiO2/Ti also shows excellent cycling stability with 80% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles at a high current density of 25 A g(-1). (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

FAO is noticeably enhanced (in the presence of urea as a blending fuel) as demonstrated by CV measurements where a five-fold increase of the direct FAO peak (I-p(d)), and a favorable negative shift of its onset potential (E-onset) are observed. Additionally, a six-fold increase of the fuel utilization (FU), expressed in the amount of charge consumed during FAO is markedly enhanced in FA-urea fuel blend (0.3 M FA and 0.2 M urea) compared to that obtained in the absence of urea (i.e., 0.3 M FA only) at the NiOx/Pd/GC electrode. Additionally, capacitance measurements of the electrode/electrolyte interface increases in line with FAO activity. Urea molecules are thought to form a bridged H-bonding with formate anions thus facilitating a favorable adsorption geometry allowing for a facile C-H scissoring, thus promoting the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway of FA to CO2. A plausible explanation assumes the formation of 6- and/or 8-membered rings between formate anion and urea (via hydrogen bonding). These findings emphasize the importance of the proper design of the catalyst together with the smart selection of the blending fuel with FA. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

However, this support is prone to corrosion under oxidative and harsh environments, thus limiting the durability of the fuel cells. Meanwhile, carbon corrosion would also weaken the linkage between Pt and the support material, which causes Pt agglomeration, and consequently, deterioration of the cell performance. To overcome the drawbacks of a Pt/C electrocatalyst, a hybrid support material comprising molybdenum disulfide and reduced graphene oxide is proposed and synthesized in this study to exploit the graphitic nature of graphene and the availability of the exposed edges of MoS2. TEM results show the uniform dispersion of Pt nanoparticles over the MoS2-rGO surface. Electrochemical measurements indicate higher ECSA retention and better ORR activity after 10000 potential cycles for Pt/MoS2-rGO as compared to Pt/C, demonstrating the improved durability for this hybrid support material.

A transcript derived fragment (TDF) corresponding to LEA gene, which got differentially expressed in wild peanut, Arachis diogoi against the late leaf spot pathogen, Phaeoisariopsis personata was used in this study. We have cloned its full length cDNA by RACE-PCR, which was designated as AdLEA. AdLEA belongs to the atypical Group 5C of LEA protein family as confirmed by sequence analysis. Group 5C LEA protein subfamily contains Pfam LEA_2 domain and is highly hydrophobic. In native conditions, expression of AdLEA was upregulated considerably upon hormonal and abiotic stress treatments emphasizing its role in abiotic stress tolerance. Subcellular localization studies showed that AdLEA protein is distributed in both nucleus and cytosol. Ectopic expression of AdLEA in tobacco resulted in enhanced tolerance of plants to dehydration, salinity and oxidative stress with the transgenic plants showing higher chlorophyll content and reduced lipid peroxidation as compared to wild type plants. Overexpressed AdLEA tobacco plants maintained better photosynthetic efficiency under drought conditions as demonstrated by chlorophyll fluorescence measurements. These plants showed enhanced transcript accumulation of some stress-responsive genes. Our study also elucidates that ROS levels were significantly reduced in leaves and stomatal guard cells of transgenic plants upon stress treatments. These results suggest that AdLEA confers multiple stress tolerance to plants, which make it a potential gene for genetic modification in plants.									23	7	0	0	21	0	29			1932-6203			WOS:000371735200120	26938884	
J	FUJIMOTO, MY; IBEN, I								CONSTRAINTS ON ELEMENT MIXING IN CLASSICAL NOVAE								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				399	2			646	655		10.1086/171956				NOV 10 1992	1992	The ejecta of many classical novae are enriched, relative to hydrogen, either in helium, or in CNO and other heavy elements, or in helium as well as in heavier elements. Building on our current theoretical understanding of hydrogen shell flashes, we propose a model which takes into account the effect of element mixing between interior and accreted layers and allows us to predict the abundances of nova ejecta as a function of the assumed degree of mixing. The model contains two parameters. The first is a measure of the degree of element mixing, and the second is a measure of the mass M(acc) accreted between nova outbursts. The two parameters are determined as a function of assumed white dwarf mass ff the abundances of helium and of heavy elements relative to hydrogen can be specified from the observations. Requiring our model to fit abundances estimated for matter in 11 nova ejecta, we determine the degree of mixing, place limits on the mass of the underlying white dwarf, and estimate M(acc). In every case, the required degree of mixing is (often much) larger than that predicted by models in which only particle diffusion and preoutburst convection have been taken into account. Estimated values of M(acc) vary from approximately 10(-6) M. (corresponding to a theoretical accretion rate greater than 10(-8) M. yr-1) to approximately 5 x 10(-4) M. (corresponding to a theoretical accretion rate less than 10(-10) M. yr-1). Particle diffusion may play an important role in producing overabundances of heavy elements when M(acc) is large and accretion rate M is small (M less than or similar to 2 X 10(-10) M. yr-1). However, some form of rotationally induced mixing is essential for producing the observed heavy element abundances when M(acc) is small and M is large (M greater than or similar to 10(-9) M. yr-1), and an extramixing mechanism is also required for some novae when M(acc) is large and M is small.									39	0	0	0	0	0	39			0004-637X			WOS:A1992JV80600027

However, the development of cost-effective catalysts to replace noble metals, such as platinum or ruthenium, remains crucial for large-scale hydrogen production. This study presents the synthesis of a transition non-noble metal-based ternary NiMoCo hybrid nanowire array as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. The catalyst exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.56 V to achieve a water-splitting current density of 10 mA cm(-2) together with long-term stability with only 5% of the initial current lost after 100 hours. X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirms that the addition of Co to the binary Ni-Mo system results in a highly mixed chemical binding state with modulated electronic structures. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the Co atoms on the ternary alloy become catalytically active sites and facilitate adsorption of intermediates by ensuring preferable interactions between the reactants and the catalyst surface in comparison to the binary counterpart. This work provides a new direction along which to activate binary alloys to further enhance their catalytic abilities in overall water splitting.									58	2	0	0	0	0	58			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000457546000021

They are very promising for applications in catalysis, separation, optoelectronics, energy storage, and nanomedicine. Recently, ultrathin 2D conjugated polymers have emerged as advanced materials for converting solar energy into chemical energy. The inherent 2D planar structure with in-plane periodicity offers many features that are highly desirable for photon-involved catalytic energy conversion processes, including high absorption coefficients, large surface areas, abundant surface active sites, and efficient charge separation. Moreover, the possibility of finely tuning the optoelectronic and structural properties through precise molecular engineering has opened up new opportunities for design and synthesis of novel 2D polymer nanosheets with unprecedented applications. Herein, we highlight recent advances in developing ultrathin 2D conjugated polymer nanosheets for solar-to-chemical energy conversion. Specifically, we discuss emerging applications of ultrathin 2D conjugated polymer nanosheets for solar-driven water splitting and CO2 reduction. Meanwhile, future challenges and prospects for design and synthesis of ultrathin 2D conjugated polymer nanosheets for solar fuel generation are also included.									11	5	0	0	2	0	12			0256-7679	1439-6203		WOS:000454929500001		
J	Roederer, Ian U.; Thompson, Ian B.								Detailed abundances of 15 stars in the metal-poor globular cluster NGC 4833								MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY				449	4			3889	3910		10.1093/mnras/stv546				JUN 1 2015	2015	We have observed 15 red giant stars in the relatively massive, metal-poor globular cluster NGC 4833 using the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle spectrograph at Magellan. We calculate stellar parameters for each star and perform a standard abundance analysis to derive abundances of 43 species of 39 elements, including 20 elements heavier than the iron group. We derive <[Fe/H]> = -2.25 +/- 0.02 from Fe I lines and <[Fe/H]> = -2.19 +/- 0.013 from Fe II lines. We confirm earlier results that found no internal metallicity spread in NGC 4833, and there are no significant star-to-star abundance dispersions among any elements in the iron group (19 <= Z <= 30). We recover the usual abundance variations among the light elements C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, and possibly Si. The heavy-element distribution reflects enrichment by r-process nucleosynthesis ([Eu/Fe] = +0.36 +/- 0.03), as found in many other metal-poor globular clusters. We investigate small star-to-star variations found among the neutron-capture elements, and we conclude that these are probably not real variations. Upper limits on the Th abundance, log epsilon (Th/Eu) <-0.47 +/- 0.09, indicate that NGC 4833, like other globular clusters where Th has been studied, did not experience a so-called actinide boost.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000355342000044

However, the intrinsic electrical resistivity of the perovskite limits the applicative potential. To overcome that, Ag powder was used with LaCoO3 to obtain porous composite electrodes with enhanced conductivities. For that, a series of composite Ag-LaCoO3 powders were prepared into pellets and pre-sintered at various temperatures up to 1000 degrees C. Their structural properties and morphology were investigated by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The electronic transport of compacted specimens was studied by impedance spectroscopy. The results indicate that the presence of Ag acts as pre-sintering additive to obtain porous electrodes, with porosity values as high as 40% at 50 vol. % Ag. Moreover, the overall electrical resistivity of the composite electrodes varied well over four orders of magnitude. The results are discussed within the generalized Bruggeman theory for effective media comprising arbitrarily shaped metallic and semiconducting inclusions.									5	0	1	0	0	0	6				1996-1944		WOS:000482576900020	31349536

Herein, a photoanode of TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTA) was decorated with environment-friendly Cu-based nanomaterials through a two-step electrochemical process, followed by sensitization with eosin Y dye, for PEC water splitting. The confirmations of Cu and CuO on the surface of TNTA were recorded by XRD combined with XPS techniques. The obtained Cu-CuO/TNTA and Eosin Y/Cu-CuO/TNTA electrodes exhibit good light absorption abilities in the range of 380-600 nm, and the adsorption of Eosin Y is enhanced. Based on the analysis of the charge transfer resistance and energy levels of Cu, CuO, TiO2, and eosin Y, it can be found that the deposition of Cu-CuO and eosin Y on TNTA can greatly accelerate the interface charge transfer, resulting in enhanced PEC performances. Moreover, the plasmonic Cu and eosin Y can help to harvest more visible light and further improve the photocurrent density.									8	1	0	0	2	0	9			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000491428200004

To comprehensively elucidate the effects of nanoconfinement induced by the host-guest interactions on the thermal behaviors of organic PCMs, in-situ N-doped nanoscale hierarchical host carbon is successfully prepared via pyrolysis of polyaniline hydrogel. Distinctly different phase change behaviors were found for small molecular organic guest PCMs with various organic functional terminals and carbon chain lengths in the confined nanoscale N-doped hierarchical pores. The host-guest interactions at the interfaces in the composite PCMs determine the nanoconfinement behaviors of PCMs via influencing the free mobility of PCM molecules, which mainly depend on the hydrogen bond intensity between PCMs and N-doped hierarchical carbon, and space restriction effect of the hierarchical pore on the PCMs. However, these two dominant factors are interchangeable when the carbon chain length of carboxylic acid molecules is different. Moreover, the nanoconfinements of PCMs are gradually enhanced from octadecane, octadecylamine, octadecanol to stearic acid. The atomic-level mechanism is proposed via density-functional theoretical (DFT) calculations. This study provides insights into the nanoconfinement mechanism of small molecular organic PCMs inside the confined nanoscale N-doped hierarchical carbon.									58	3	0	0	6	0	61			2405-8297			WOS:000462090800033

Herein, we investigated the promotion effect of dual cocatalysts on TiO2 for hydrogen production. Compared with the Pd/TiO2 and Ir/TiO2 with the individual cocatalyst, TiO2 coloaded with Pd and Ir species exhibited an obviously enhanced H-2 production activity and reduced CO/H-2 ratio. XPS and IR spectra of CO adsorption analysis indicated that the dual cocatalysts on TiO2 were actually composed of Pd-0 and partially oxidized IrOx, which acted as the reduction and oxidation cocatalysts, respectively. Interestingly, EDX elemental mappings of Pd and Ir indicated that the two elements on TiO2 were inclined to depositing together. The synergetic effect of reduction and oxidation cocatalysts with their intimate contact is proposed to contribute to the high H-2 production activity, which is different from the common view that the reduction and oxidation sites should be spatially separated to avoid the charge recombination.									44	1	0	0	2	0	44			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000341064800042	25030604

Herein, we systematically investigated the potential of a novel two dimensional penta-X2C (X = P, As, Sb) family for photocatalytic water splitting by means of density functional theory. The penta-X2C family consists of semiconductors with indirect band gaps of 2.64 eV, 2.09 eV and 1.35 eV for X = P, As and Sb, respectively. Notably, the band edge positions of penta-P2C and penta-As2C can perfectly satisfy the redox potentials of photocatalytic water splitting via strain engineering, whereas penta-Sb2C only meets the reduction potential. The ultrahigh (up to 10(3)-10(5) cm(2) V-1 s(-1)) and anisotropic carrier mobilities are crucial to suppressing the photogenerated electron-hole pair recombination. Meanwhile, the penta-X2C family exhibits excellent light absorption in the visible-ultraviolet region, favorable for the utilization of sunlight. In addition, compared with other common 2D materials such as graphene and h-BN, the penta-X2C family possesses a relatively smaller Young's modulus and larger critical strain, while penta-X2C have large negative Poisson's ratios of -0.103, -0.079 and -0.077, respectively. These results testify that the penta-X2C family has potential applications not only in photocatalytic water splitting but also in designing 2D electromechanical and optoelectronic devices.									40	0	0	0	1	0	40			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463819400051

CdS/ZnO nanoheterojunction arrays (NHAs) are not suitable for full solar water splitting due to the easy photocorrosion of CdS if there is no sacrificial agent. Herein, CoPi was loaded onto CdS/ZnO NHAs to improve the PEC current and stability. Heat treatment had a critical effect on the PEC performance of the Co-Pi-loaded NHA. The higher crystallinity of the CdS layer with CdCl2-assisted treatment affords the largest stable current (2.5 mA cm(-2)) for 3 h without performance degradation in 0.1 M phosphate solution (pH = 14). According to the measured band/electrolyte level alignment, the smaller current for full water splitting compared to that in the sacrificial solution is attributed to the large hole transfer resistance owing to the lowered conduction band with CoPi loading. The decrease in photocurrent over 3 h was demonstrated to be due to the photocorrosion of CdS and then the chemical corrosion of ZnO by the phosphate solution. The results suggest that the PEC performance is expected to be improved by optimizing the cocatalyst and the electrolyte solution.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000448338700018

Herein, we have successfully developed cost-efficient three dimensional (3D) highly open hierarchical catalysts with cobalt-molybdenum nanosheet arrays on nickel foam (NF) (denoted as CoMoO NSs@NF) and CoMoP NSs@NF via phosphorization for efficient overall water splitting. The optimized Co5Mo1.0O NSs@NF exhibits excellent OER activity with low overpotentials of 270 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and superior stability after 140 h and the optimized Co5Mo1.0P NSs@NF shows excellent HER activity with low overpotential of 173 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and superior stability after 1000 CV cycles. In addition to the enhanced electron migration and mass transfer benefited from the 3D structure, the XPS analysis shows that Mo plays a vital role on modulating the number of active sites on the surface, leading to the electrocatalytic enhancement. Significantly, the Co5Mo1.0O NSs@NF//Co5Mo1.0P NSs@NF couple showed highly efficient overall water electrolysis with a low potential of 1.68 V at 10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline electrolyzer as well as excellent stability after long-term water splitting, holding great potential for practical overall water splitting electrocatalysis.									200	12	0	0	9	0	204			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000425396400051

Currently, most of the successful models of PEC cells are still fabricated on small scales near 1 cm(2), which largely limits the mass deployment of solar-fuel production. Here, the scale-up to 8 cm(2) of an integrated PEC (IPEC) device is demonstrated and its performance compared to a 1 cm(2) IPEC cell, using state-of-the-art iridium and platinum catalysts with III-V photoabsorbers. The initial photocurrents at 1 sun are 8 and 7 mA cm(-2) with degradation rates of 0.60 and 0.47 mA cm(-2) day(-1), during unbiased operation for the 1 and 8 cm(2) devices, respectively. Evaluating under outdoor and indoor conditions at two U.S. National Laboratories reveals similar results, evidencing the reproducibility of this design's performance. Furthermore, the emerging degradation mechanisms during scale-up are investigated and the knowledge gained from this work will provide feedback to the broader community, since PEC device durability is a limiting factor in its potential future deployment.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000583859000001

The main objective of this review is to explore the current advancement of LDH-based photocatalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen production by focusing on the role of divalent and trivalent metal incorporations and their efficiency enhancement. Firstly, the mechanism of photocatalysis and its thermodynamics has been explicated to gain basic understanding and fundamentals. Secondly, a brief introduction to the overview of LDH photocatalysts with special attention to the effects of cationic incorporations on the optical properties and computational study towards the electronic density has been demonstrated. Besides, the thermal stability of LDH is briefly discussed, focusing on the effects of temperature towards the conversion into mixed-metal oxide (MMO). Next, the classification of LDH based on divalent and trivalent cationic elements and their role in the brucite layer of LDH are systematically discussed. Attention is given to the mechanistic properties of the extensively studied metals, such as Mg, Ni, Zn, Co, Cr, Fe, V and Al, with the efficiency enhancements through various engineering aspects are demonstrated. The overview summary on the efficient design of LDH is elucidated to provide a deep understanding for improving their photocatalytic properties. Lastly, the future perspectives and recommendations are discussed to provide new insight into the potential of LDH and render them a notable place in solar energy applications.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000703757700001

The development of thin films and core-shell catalysts seems to be a promising strategy along this path. Using density functional theory we have analyzed a number of surface properties of supported bimetallic thin films with the composition A(3)B (where A = Pt and Pd, and B = Cu, Ag and Au). We focus on the surface segregation, dissolution stability and surface electronic structure. We also address the chemisorption properties of Pd3Au thin films supported by different substrates, by probing the surface reactivity with CO. We find a strong influence of the support in the case of mono- and bilayers, while the surface strain seems to be the predominant factor in determining the surface properties of supported trilayers and thicker films. In particular, we show that the studied properties of the supported trilayers can be predicted from the lattice mismatch between the overlayer and the support. Namely, if the strain dependence of the corresponding quantities for pure strained surfaces is known, the properties of strained supported trilayers can be reliably estimated. The obtained results can be used in the design of novel catalysts and predictions of the surface properties of supported ultrathin catalyst layers.									18	1	0	0	0	0	18			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000423019600021	29260157

Twofold treatment of these samples with a recently described 'iron depletion' procedure (MacMillan, F., Lendzian, F., Renger, G. and Lubitz, W. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 3144-8156) leads to a complete loss (below the detection limit of Mossbauer spectroscopy) of the non heme iron center while more than 50% of the PS II complexes retain the functional integrity for light induced formation of the 'stable' radical pair Y-Z(OX) P680Pheo Q(A)(radical anion). This sample type deprived of virtually all non heme iron in PS II provides a most suitable material for magnetic resonance studies that require an elimination of the interaction between Fe2+ and nearby radicals.									19	0	0	0	14	0	19			0014-5793			WOS:A1996TX65200013	8641439

These domains are the entire grana, the grana con, the margins from the grana, the stroma lamellae, and the Y100 fraction (which represent more purified stroma lamellae). The two first fractions originate from appressed grana membranes and have PSII with a high proportion of O-2-evolving centers (80-90%) and efficient electron transport on the acceptor side. About 30% of the granal PSII centers were found in the margin fraction. Two-thirds of those PSII centers evolve O-2, but the electron transfer on the acceptor side is slowed. PSII from the stroma lamellae was less active. The fraction containing the entire stroma has only 43% O-2-evolving PSII centers and slow electron transfer on the acceptor side. In contrast, PSII centers of the Y100 fraction show no O-2 evolution and were unable to reduce QB. mash-induced fluorescence decay measurements in the presence of DCMU give information about the integrity of the donor side of PSII, We were able to distinguish between PSII centers with a functional Mn cluster and without any Mn cluster, and PSII centers which undergo photoactivation and have a partially assembled Mn cluster. From this analysis, we propose the existence of a PSII, activity gradient in the thylakoid membrane. The gradient is directed from the stroma lamellae, where the Mn cluster is absent or inactive, via the margins where photoactivation accelerates, to the grana core domain where PSII is fully photoactivated. The photoactivation process correlates to the PSII diffusion along the membrane and is initiated in the stroma lamellae while the final steps take place in the appressed regions of the grana core. The margin domain is seemingly very important in this process.									43	0	1	0	42	0	44			0006-2960			WOS:000089066600015	10956038

Withstanding ROS produced by the host innate immunity is an important strategy evolved by pathogenicLeptospirafor persisting in and colonizing hosts. InL.interrogans, genes encoding defenses against ROS are repressed by the peroxide stress regulator, PerR. In this study, RNA sequencing was performed to characterize both theL.interrogansresponse to low and high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and the PerR regulon. We showed thatLeptospirasolicit three main peroxidase machineries (catalase, cytochrome C peroxidase and peroxiredoxin) and heme to detoxify oxidants produced during peroxide stress. In addition, canonical molecular chaperones of the heat shock response and DNA repair proteins from the SOS response were required forLeptospirarecovering from oxidative damage. Identification of the PerR regulon upon exposure to H(2)O(2)allowed to define the contribution of this regulator in the oxidative stress response. This study has revealed a PerR-independent regulatory network involving other transcriptional regulators, two-component systems and sigma factors as well as non-coding RNAs that putatively orchestrate, in concert with PerR, the oxidative stress response. We have shown that PerR-regulated genes encoding a TonB-dependent transporter and a two-component system (VicKR) are involved inLeptospiratolerance to superoxide. This could represent the first defense mechanism against superoxide inL.interrogans, a bacterium lacking canonical superoxide dismutase. Our findings provide an insight into the mechanisms required by pathogenicLeptospirato overcome oxidative damage during infection-related conditions. This will participate in framing future hypothesis-driven studies to identify and decipher novel virulence mechanisms in this life-threatening pathogen.Author summary Leptospirosis is a zoonotic infectious disease responsible for over one million of severe cases and 60 000 fatalities annually worldwide. This neglected and emerging disease has a worldwide distribution, but it mostly affects populations from developing countries in sub-tropical areas. The causative agents of leptospirosis are pathogenic bacterialLeptospiraspp. There is a considerable deficit in our knowledge of these atypical bacteria, including their virulence mechanisms. During infection,Leptospiraare confronted with the deadly oxidants produced by the host tissues and immune response. Here, we have identified the leptospiral factors necessary for overcoming infection-related oxidative stress. We found thatLeptospirasolicit peroxidases to detoxify oxidants as well as chaperones of the heat shock response and DNA repair proteins of the SOS response to recover from oxidative damage. Moreover, our study indicates that the oxidative stress response is orchestrated by a regulatory network involving PerR and other transcriptional regulators, sigma factors, two component systems, and putative non-coding RNAs. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms required by pathogenicLeptospirato tolerate infection-related oxidants and could help identifying novel virulence factors and developing new therapeutic targets.									10	0	0	0	8	0	10			1553-7366	1553-7374		WOS:000578415600001	33021995	
J	Pasvanoglu, Suzan				pasvanoglu, suzan/GXF-0587-2022	pasvanoglu, Suzan/0000-0002-0026-9259			Geochemistry and conceptual model of thermal waters from Ercis - Zilan Valley, Eastern Turkey								GEOTHERMICS				86						101803	10.1016/j.geothermics.2020.101803				JUL 2020	2020	Faults related to the neotectonic stress regime of Eastern Anatolia permit the rise and outflow of thermal waters in the Zilan Valley located 30 km north of the Ercis, Van province. Thermal springs discharge in a volcanic terrain, often in clusters, along faults in two separate areas: In the vicinity of Taskapi (orkiiy) and Gergili villages, which lie in the north of the area; and in the area of Hasanabdal (Doganci) thermal springs that lie to the south of the Zilan Valley. Temperatures of the springs range from 20 to 78 degrees C, with discharge rates of 4 - 20 L/s. Thermal waters of the Zilan region are of different types, from Na - HCO3 to Na-Cl, with dissolved ion concentrations varying over a wide range between 484-4572 mg/L. Calcite dissolution and silicate hydrolysis are the dominant water-rock interactions. Constituents with minor and trace element concentrations reinforce conclusions drawn from major-ion composition that the major hydrogeochemical processes are: mixing between cold-shallow and hot-deep waters, loss of energy by heat conduction, and swam-heating of perched-aquifers. The cold spring and Zilan Creek waters are of the Ca - HCO3 and Na - HCO3 type respectively, and their dissolved ion concentrations are low. Hydrogeochemical processes for the cold waters involve carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering reactions. Chemical geothermometers are used to estimate the temperature of the deep fluids using the chemical composition of the less modified fluids. They indicate that fluids emerging from volcanic rocks in the Zilan valley reach temperatures of around 150 degrees C. Thermal waters, generated through conducive heat transfer or the input of geothermal vapor or gases from below, delineate the extent of the geothermal reservoir(s) at depth.Deuterium and oxygen-18 signatures of thermal waters indicate that they are at least partially derived from thermally heated water through a process of O-18 enrichment owing to interaction with the marine limestones through which the water passes to the surface springs.Both geochemical and isotope data indicate that the Zilan Valley hosts a low temperature, fracture-zone system with aconvective up-flow and dominant conducive heat transfer from a resource base in the upper crust to the surface.Ore deposits in the Zilan Valley, hydrothermal alteration in the Sorkoy lava, and high concentrations of As, Au, Hg, Zr, Ba, Ni, Sb and other trace elements that are present in the travertine is the evidence for a heat source formed at a shallower depth. A conceptual model of the geothermal system of Zilan is proposed based on adata gathered.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0375-6505	1879-3576		WOS:000534152600014

Sulfur was doped in situ into SCN by using thiourea as the precursor, and the 2D nanosheet structure was obtained during the thermal oxidative etching process. The structural, morphological, and optical properties of the 2D-SCN sample were investigated in detail. Herein, it is shown that the thermal oxidative etching treatment and sulfur doping induced a 2D nanosheet structure (2D-SCN-3h) with a thickness of about 4.0 nm and exposure of more sulfur elements on the surface. The surface area increased from 16.6 m(2)/g for SCN to 226.9 m(2)/g. Compared to bulk SCN, a blue shift of the absorption peaks was observed for the obtained 2D-SCN-3h photocatalyst, and the absorption intensity was higher than that of the sulfur-free counterpart (2D-CN). The successful in situ doping of S element into SCN or 2D-SCN-3h samples is beneficial to the introduction of surface N defects and O species. 2D-SCN-3h indicated higher efficiency in photogenerated charge carrier separation and showed the highest reductive activity in photocatalytic splitting of water at a rate of 127.4 mu mol/h under simulated solar light irradiation, which was 250 times and 3 times higher than that of SCN and 2D-CN photocatalysts, respectively. The apparent quantum efficiency was estimated to be 8.35% at 420 nm irradiation. The S-C-N bond formed by sulfur doping was beneficial to the charge-transfer process, and this led to higher photocatalytic activity according to partial density of state analysis computed by first-principles methods.									63	10	0	0	9	0	64			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000526543400028	32083456

At ambient pressure the so-called "9R" polytype has been prepared by solid-state reaction and slow cooling in air to yield an almost fully oxygen-stoichiometric BalrO(296(1)) composition. The crystal structure has been refined from XRD data in the monoclinic C2/m space group with a = 10.0046(3) angstrom, b = 5.75362(14) angstrom, c = 15.1839(4) angstrom, beta = 103.27(1)degrees; it contains trimers of facesharing octahedra (or Ir3O12 trioctahedra) that are linked by their vertices to form columns parallel to the c-axis with a stacking of layers of corner sharing (c) and face sharing (h) IrO6 octahedra along the sequence hhchhc. This structure is stable up to 3 GPa; at 4 GPa a new 5H polytype has been stabilized as a pure phase. The crystal structure has been solved by ab initio procedures from powder XRD data. It is monoclinic with a = 9.9511(2)angstrom, b = 5.7503(1) angstrom, c = 13.71003(3)angstrom, beta = 118.404(2)degrees, and it was refined in the C2/m space group from NPD data collected at room temperature. This polytype can be described as a stacking of IrO6 octahedra along the sequence hchcc. The structure contains chains of double dimer units of facesharing octahedra; the twin dimers are connected to single layers of vertex-sharing octahedra, forming infinite chains along c. This is a unique stacking that, with this repetition length, has never been described before among the hexagonal polytypes of ABO(3) perovskites. The 5H polytype is stable in a narrow pressure range; at 5 GPa the 6H structure is formed, stable up to 10 GPa. The 6H-BaIrO3 polytype is monoclinic, space group C2/c, with a = 5.7483(2)angstrom, b = 9.9390(3)angstrom, c = 14.3582(5)angstrom, beta = 91.319(2)degrees. The structure consists of dimers of face-sharing octahedra separated by single corner-sharing octahedra, showing the sequence hcchcc along the c-axis. At 10 GPa the cubic 3C perovskite structure could be identified as a minority phase, with a = 4.0611(7) angstrom, defined in the Pm (3) over barm space group. The precarious stability of the 5H polytype, as well as the novel pressure sequence displayed by BalrO(3) that is distinct from the classical sequence 9R-4H-6H-3C exhibited by many transition metal oxides, for instance BaRuO3, is a result of the particular stability of the "9R' ambient-pressure structure, which is reinforced by a strong Ir-Ir bond across the octahedral faces, and the Ir-Ir Coulombic repulsion across shared faces that destabilizes the 4H polytype relative to the 6H phase to allow stabilization of the hybrid 5H polytype in a narrow presure range.									32	1	0	0	2	0	33			0002-7863			WOS:000266484900047	19469581

The skarn and associated ore formations mainly occur at the contact between intrusive rocks of the Egrigoz Plutonic Complex (EPC) and calcareous pelitic schists with limestone lenses of the Saricasu Formation and meta-carbonate rocks of the Arikaya Formation. The major, trace, and rare earth element analysis of the igneous rocks indicate that they are high level, subalkaline, calc-alkaline, peraluminous to metaluminous I-type intrusions, generated in a continental arc setting. Three distinct skarn-type mineralization, differing in their host rocks and distance from the intrusive body, were chosen to establish the ore-forming conditions in different episodes of skarn formation. The Kureci iron mineralization is hosted in a skarn zone with well-developed zoning from unaltered granodiorite and endoskarn, andradite-diopside exoskarn, to diopside-wollastonite exoskarn towards a marble reaction front. In Sakari, the iron mineralization and associated skarn have formed due to successive fracturing and infiltration processes. From early contact metamorphic rocks to late prograde skarn at the Sakari prospect, the composition of clinopyroxene ranges from (Di(50-70) Hd(28-53) Jo(1-2)) to (Di(19-73) Hd(26-77) Jo(2-6)) and the composition of garnet ranges from (Ad(95-99) Gr(1-5)) to (Ad(40-61) Gr(36-58)), respectively. The presence of anisotropic grossular garnet with high Fe2+/Fe3+ in crosscutting pyrrhotite-pyrite-bearing veinlets coupled with hedenbergitic pyroxene (Mg-poor clinopyroxene with higher Fe2+/Fe3+) is consistent with reducing conditions during the later stage of prograde skarn alteration. The Catak iron skarn is characteristic, with its high sulphide content due to the presence of pyrrhotite, pyrite, and arsenopyrite, and low proportion of garnet to pyroxene. The sulphur isotope (delta S-34) compositions in the pyrrhotite-dominant skarn zones range between +0.84 to -2.23%. We interpret the bulk of the sulphur in the system as of igneous derivation and there has not been any significant sulphur contribution from a crustal source. Fluid inclusion measurements conducted on skarn minerals of the proximal zone and distal zone+vein skarn revealed high homogenization temperatures (371 to >600 degrees C) and varying salinity values (10.5 to >70 wt% NaCl). The fluid inclusion data indicate that there are at least three fluids associated with the genesis of the proximal skarn where the high garnet/pyroxene ratios are found. Fluid inclusions that represent the early stages both in garnet and pyroxene plot in 'Primary Magmatic Fluid' and 'Metamorphic Fluids' fields. A magmatic fluid, presumably located at deeper parts of the system, mixed with a metamorphic fluid during its ascent. Over all the Egrigoz skarn a weak or moderate retrograde skarn alteration envelope formed, dominated by the incursion of meteoric waters in the system, indicating limited fluid-rock interaction. Hydrofracturing resulted in pressure decrease and inclusions with Type III (L+V+S) inclusions that plot in the 'Secondary Magmatic Liquid' and 'Magmatic Meteoric Mixing' fields.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1300-0985			WOS:000320454500003

The presence of the naturally resulting pre-oxide shell layer on metallic Ni nano materials such as Ni nanowires (NW) is responsible for degrading the deformation mechanisms and related mechanical properties. However, the role of the pre-oxide shell layer on the metallic Ni NW coupled with the complicated mechanical deformation mechanism and related properties have not yet been fully and independently understood. For this reason, the ReaxFF reactive force field for Ni/O interactions was used to investigate the effect of surface oxide layers and the size-dependent mechanical properties of Ni NWs under precisely controlled tensile loading conditions. To directly quantify the size dependent surface oxidation effect on the tensile mechanical deformation behaviour and related properties for Ni NWs, first, ReaxFF-molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out to study the oxidation kinetics on the free surface of Ni NWs in a molecular O-2 environment as a function of various diameters (D = 5.0, 6.5, and 8.0 nm) of the NWs, but at the same length. Single crystalline, pure metallic Ni NWs were also studied as a reference. The results of the oxidation simulations indicate that a surface oxide shell layer with limiting thickness of similar to 1.0 nm was formed on the free surface of the bare Ni NW, typically via dissociation of the O-O bonds and the subsequent formation of Ni-O bonds. Furthermore, we investigated the evolution of the size-dependent intrinsic mechanical elastic properties of the core-oxide shell (Ni/NixOy) NWs by comparing them with their un-oxidized counterparts under constant uniaxial tensile loading. We found that the oxide shell layer significantly decreases the mechanical properties of metallic Ni NW as well as facilitates the initiation of plastic deformation as a function of decreasing diameter. The disordered oxide shell layer on the Ni NW's surface remarkably reduces the yield stress and Young's modulus, due to the increased softening effects with the decreasing NW diameter, compared to un-oxidized counterparts. Moreover, the onset of plastic deformation occurs at a relatively low yielding strain and stress level for the smaller diameter of oxide-coated Ni NWs in comparison to their pure counterparts. Furthermore, for pure Ni NWs, Young's modulus, the yielding stress and strain slightly decrease with the decrease in the diameter size of Ni NWs.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000418374800032		
J	Yu, Lihua; Xue, Juanqin; Zhang, Lihua; Tang, Changbin; Guo, Yingjuan								Fabrication of a stable Ti/Pb-TiO(x)NWs/PbO2 anode and its application in benzoquinone degradation								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				368						137532	10.1016/j.electacta.2020.137532				FEB 1 2021	2021	To delay passivation of a titanium (Ti) substrate as well as enhance adhesion between an electrodeposited PbO2 coating and the Ti substrate, a titanium-lead composite oxide nanowire (Pb-TiO(x)NWs) intermediate layer was formed in situ on the surface of porous Ti by alkali etching, ion substitution, and hightemperature calcination. At the same time, Ti/PbO2 and Ti/TiO(2)NWs/PbO2 electrodes with porous Ti as a matrix were prepared for comparison. The surface structure and morphology of the prepared intermediate layer and the PbO2 coating were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The influences of the composite oxide intermediate layer on the electrochemical performance of the PbO2 electrode were analyzed by cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), and AC impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Accelerated lifetime tests were performed for electrodes with and without different intermediate layers. The results showed that PbOx was incorporated into the titanium dioxide three-dimensional network structure, resulting in formation of Pb-TiO(x)NWs. The surface of the Ti/Pb-TiO(x)NWs/PbO2 electrode was denser due to the smaller particle size of PbO2. The preferred crystal orientation of 9(110) was observed for PbO(2 )deposited on Ti/Pb-TiO(x)NWs. The oxygen evolution potential reached a maximum of 2.19 V for Ti/Pb-TiO(x)NWs/PbO2. Accelerated life tests showed that compared with Ti/PbO2 and Ti/TiO2 NWs/PbO2, the electrode life of Ti/Pb-TiO(x)NWs/PbO(2 )was increased by 91.7% and 35.3%, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that significantly improved morphology and electrochemical performance were achieved for titanium-based PbO2 electrodes by the addition of a Pb-TiO(x)NWs intermediate layer. In particular, the electrochemical stability of the PbO(2 )coating electrodes was improved markedly by the Pb-TiOx NWs intermediate layer. The electrodes were used for electrochemical oxidation of benzoquinone in wastewater (100 mg/L). It was found that chloride ions played a critical role in improving the current efficiency of electro-oxidative degradation. Under the same conditions, the COD removal rate in the presence of NaCl was 45% higher than in the presence of sulfate. The results of HPLC analysis of the intermediate products indicated that the oxidants electro-generated by chloride ions had stronger ring-opening and mineralization capabilities than those electro-generated by sulfate ions.

However, these steps had not been directly resolved in any kinetic experiment, until development of an ultrasensitive polarographic O-2 electrode and synthesis of an improved chelator for cofactor removal allowed direct kinetic resolution of the first pre-steady state intermediate [Ananyev, G. M. & Dismukes, G. C. (1996a) Biochemistry 35, 4102-4109]. Herein, the dependence of the rates of each of the first two light steps and the dark step of photoactivation was directly determined In spinach PSII membranes over a range of calcium and manganese concentrations at least IO-fold lower than those possible using commercial O-2 electrodes, The following results were obtained. (1) One Mn2+ ion binds and is photooxidized to Mn3+ at a high-affinity site, forming the first light-induced intermediate, IM1. Formation of IM1 is coupled to the dissociation of a bound Ca2+ ion either located in the Mn site or coupled to it. (2) The inhibition constant for Ca2+ dissociation from this site is equal to 1.5 mM. (3) The dissociation constant of Mn2+ at this high-affinity site is equal to 8 mu M at the optimum calcium concentration for O-2-evolving activity of 8 mM, in agreement with the high-affinity site for electron donation to PSII. (4) Prior to the next photolytic step, one Ca2+ ion must bind at its effector site so that stable photooxidation of a second Mn2+ ion can occur, forming the second light-induced intermediate, IM2. This dark process is the rate-determining step, (5) The Michaelis constant for recovery of O-2 evolution by Ca2+ binding at this effector site (K-m) is equal to 1.4 mM, a value that is the same as that measured for the calcium requirement for O-2 evolution in intact PSII. (6) The low quantum yield for the formation of IM2 from IM1 increases linearly with the duration of the dark period up to the longest period we could examine (10 s). Accordingly, the rate limitation in the second photolytic step originates from a slow calcium-induced dark rearrangement of the first intermediate, IM1, which we propose to be a protein conformational change that allows stable binding of the next Mn2+ ion. We further propose that the single Ca2+ ion which is required for assembly of the Mn-4 cluster is equivalent to the Ca2+ ion which functions at the ''gatekeeper'' site in intact O-2-evolving centers, where it plays a role in limiting substrate access to the Mn,(4) cluster [Sivaraja, M., et al. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 9459-9464; Tso, J., et al,, (1991) Biochemistry 30, 4734-4739]. A molecular model for photoactivation is proposed and discussed.									76	1	0	0	46	0	76			0006-2960			WOS:A1997XM53800029	9220979

The photocatalytic activity of the heterostructure is greatly determined by the efficiency of interfacial charge transfer. In this work, we demonstrate the facet engineered interface design of BiOCl-PbS photocatalytic structures. The PbS nanocrystals are selectively deposited on the (0 0 1) and (1 1 0) facets of BiOCl nanoplates to form BiOCl(0 0 1)-PbS and BiOCl(1 1 0)-PbS, respectively. It is found that the average H-2 production rate of BiOCl(1 1 0)-PbS photocatalyst is 2.5 times higher than that of BiOCl(0 0 1)-PbS under broad-spectrum irradiation. This enhancement is mainly ascribed to the different interfacial charge transfer efficiencies. Owing to the different band energies between BiOCl(0 0 1) and (1 1 0) facets, a V-shaped band alignment is formed in the BiOCl(0 0 1)-PbS sample, which results in the accumulation of photogenerated electrons in BiOCl(0 0 1)-PbS interface and prevents the further charge transfer and separation between BiOCl and PbS, while a ladder-shaped band alignment of BiOCl(1 1 0)-PbS achieves the smooth charge transfer and high-efficient charge separation without electron accumulation in the BiOCl(1 1 0)-PbS interface. This work represents a step toward the interface design of high-performance hybrid photocatalyst through facet engineering.									29	1	0	0	4	0	29			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000457863500001

A promising solution is the direct conversion of the excess electrical energy into valuable chemicals in electrochemical reactors that are inexpensive, scalable, and compatible with irregular availability of electrical power. Membrane-less electrolyzers, deployed on a microfluidic platform, were recently shown to hold great promise for efficient electrolysis and cost-effective operation. The elimination of the membrane increases the reactor lifetime, reduces fabrication costs, and enables the deployment of liquid electrolytes with ionic conductivities that surpass those allowed by solid membranes. Here, we demonstrate a membrane-less architecture that enables unprecedented throughput by 3D printing a device that combines components such as the flow plates and the fluidic ports in a monolithic part, while at the same time, providing tight tolerances and smooth surfaces for precise flow conditioning. We show that inertial fluidic forces are effective even in millifluidic regimes and, therefore, are utilized to control the two-phase flows inside the device and prevent cross-contamination of the products. Simulations provide insight on governing fluid dynamics of coalescing bubbles and their rapid jumps away from the electrodes and help identify three key mechanisms for their fast and intriguing return towards the electrodes. Experiments and simulations are used to demonstrate the efficiency of the inertial separation mechanism in millichannels and at higher flow rates than in microchannels. We analyze the performance of the present device for two reactions: water splitting and the chlor-alkali process, and find product purities of more than 99% and Faradaic efficiencies of more than 90%. The present membrane- less reactor - containing more efficient catalysts - provides close to 40 times higher throughput than its microfluidic counterpart and paves the way for realization of cost-effective and scalable electrochemical stacks that meet the performance and price targets of the renewable energy sector.									51	1	0	0	2	0	51			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000473083100009		
J	Zheng, Zhibei; Zheng, Wei; Wang, Haoqiu; Pan, Jincao; Pu, Xiaoying								Serotype determination of Salmonella by xTAG assay								JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGICAL METHODS				141				101	107		10.1016/j.mimet.2017.08.011				OCT 2017	2017	Currently, no protocols or commercial kits are available to determine the serotypes of Salmonella by using Luminex MAGPIX (R). In this study, an xTAG assay for serotype determination of Salmonella suitable for Luminex MAGPIX (R) is described and 228 Salmonella isolates were serotype determined by this xTAG assay. The xTAG assay consists of two steps: 1) Multiplex PCR to amplify simultaneously 0, H and Vi antigen genes of Salmonella, and 2) Magplex-TAG (TM) microsphere hybridization to identify accurately the specific PCR products of different antigens. Compared with the serotyping results of traditional serum agglutination test, the sensitivity and specificity of the xTAG assay were 95.1% and 100%, respectively. The agreement rate of these two assays was 95.2%. Compared with Luminex xMAP (R) Salmonella Serotyping Assay (SSA) kit, the advantages of this xTAG assay are: First, the magnetic beads make it applicable to both the Luminex (R) 100/200 (TM) and MAGPIX (R) systems. Second, only primers rather than both primers and probes are needed in the xTAG assay, and the process of coupling antigen-specific oligonucleotide probes to beads is circumvented, which make the xTAG assay convenient to be utilized by other laboratories. The xTAG assay may serve as a rapid alternative or complementary method for traditional Salmonella serotyping tests, especially for laboratories that utilize the MAGPIX (R) systems.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0167-7012	1872-8359		WOS:000411779300019	28818598

The TiO2 NTs were produced beforehand through the controlled anodic oxidation of titanium substrates. The effect of the nature of the PLD background gas (Vacuum, O-2 and He) on the microstructure, composition and chemical bondings of the CoNi-NPs deposited onto the TiO2-NTs has been investigated. We found that the PLD CoNi-NPs have a core/shell (oxide/metal) structure when deposited under vacuum, while they are fully oxidized when deposited under O-2. On the other hand, by varying the CoNi-NPs loading of the TiO2-NTs (through the increase of the number of laser ablation pulses (N-LP)), we have systematically studied their photocatalytic effect by means of cyclic-voltammetry (CV) measurements under both AM1.5 simulated solar light and filtered visible light. We show that depositing CoNi-NPs on the substrate under vacuum and He increases the photo-electrochemical conversion effectiveness (PCE) by 600% (at N-LP = 10,000) in the visible light domain, while their overall PCE degrades with N-LP under solar illumination. In contrast, the fully oxidized CoNi-NPs (deposited under O-2) are found to be the most effective catalyst under sunlight with an overall increase of more than 50% of the PCE at the optimum loading around N-LP similar to 1000. Such catalytic enhancement is believed to result from both an enhanced light absorption by CoO (of which bandgap is of similar to 2.4 eV) and the formation of a heterojunction between NiO/CoO nanoparticles and TiO2 nanotubes.

These oxide layers reveal only one feature in the oxide-reduction profiles, the OCl peak, which corresponds to the reduction of PtO to Pt. The oxide growth behavior is influenced by the experimental conditions, such as E-p, t(p), and T, and in general the higher E-p and/or longer t(p) and/or higher T, the thicker the oxide layer. An increase of E-p and/or t(p) shifts the OCl peak towards less-positive potentials. On the other hand, an increase of T does not lead to any shift of the OCl peak. Application of oxide-growth theories and theoretical data treatment indicate that the growth of PtO follows two distinct kinetic laws, each arising from a different growth mechanism: (i) the logarithmic growth for oxide whose thickness is up to 1 ML of PtO, i.e., at 0.9 <= Ep <= 1.0 V for t(p) <= 10(4) s, and (ii) the inverse-logarithmic growth for oxide whose thickness is more than 1 ML of PtO, i.e., at E-p > 1.0 V for t(p) > 10 s. The logarithmic growth law originates from the interfacial place exchange between O-chem and the top-most Pt atoms that is the rate-determining step, whereas the inverse-logarithmic growth law arises from the escape of the Pt cation, pt(2+), from the metal into the oxide at the inner metal/oxide interface. The dipole moment of the Pt delta+ - O-chem(delta-) surface species that drives the place exchange is consistently 1.30 +/- 0.10 D. The electric field, E, which drives the interfacial Pt2+ escape is found to be consistently in the 0.33-0.46 x 10(9) V m(-1) range. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

PANI/ITO films are prepared using oxidation polymerization method at 25 degrees C, then coated with Au nanoparticles with different thicknesses (sputter time from 1 to 2 min). The three prepared electrodes; PANI/ITO (Electrode (0), 1-min-Au/PANI/ITO (Electrode (I)), and 2-min-Au/PANI/ITO (Electrode (II)) are compared for H-2 generation from H2O. Scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, UV-Vis spectrophotometer, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analyses have been carried out, in which the average PANI crystal size was 20 nm. Moreover, the bandgaps were determined, in which 2-min-Au/PANI/ITO has the optimum bandgap of 2.25 eV. The characteristic behavior of the H-2 generation took place depending on the current density (J(ph)) value by using J(ph)-V and J(ph)-time study. Also, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) and the applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) were calculated for the Electrode (II) at 25 degrees C. The optimum IPCE and ABPE efficiency were 18.7 and 0.99%, respectively, at 390 nm. By increasing the temperature to 70 degrees C, the IPCE efficiency increases to about 37%. Finally, activation energy (E-a), enthalpy (Delta H*), and entropy (Delta S*) were determined, in which the values were 24.32 kJ mol(-1), 10.90 kJ mol(-1), and 74.99 J K-1 mol(-1), respectively.

Photoreduction gave stable blue colloidal c-TiO2R NPs with 10-60 electrons per particle. Equilibration of these reduced NPs with soluble redox reagents such as methylviologen (MV2+) provided measurements of the colloid reduction potential as a function of pH. The potentials of c-TiO2 from pH 2-9 varied linearly with pH, with a slope of -60 +/- 5 mV/pH. Estimates of the potential at pH 12 were consistent with extrapolating that line to high pH. The reduction potentials did not correlate with the zeta potentials (zeta) or the surface charge of the NPs across this pH range. Similar reduction potentials were observed for c- and uc-TiO2 at low pH even though they have quite different zeta potentials. These results show that the common surface-charging explanation of the pH dependence is not tenable in these systems. Oxidation of reduced c-TiO2R with the electron-transfer oxidant potassium triiodide (KI3) occurred with a significant drop in pH, showing that protons were released when the electrons were removed from the NPs. Smaller pH drops were observed for the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reagents O-2 (air) and 4-MeO-TEMPO (4-methoxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperine-1-oxy radical). The difference in the number of protons released with KI3 vs O-2 and 4-MeO-TEMPO was roughly one proton per electron removed. Thus, the thermodynamically preferred reactivity of these colloidal TiO2 NPs is PCET over the pH 2-13 range studied. The measured redox potentials refer to the chemical process TiO2 + H+ + e(-) -> TiO2 center dot e(-), H+; and therefore they do not correspond with an electronic energy such as a conduction band edge or flat band potential. The 1e(-)/1H(+) stoichiometry means that the TiO2 reduction potentials correspond to a TiO2-H bond dissociation free energy (BDFE), determined to be 49 +/- 2 kcal mol(-1). The PCET description is consistent with the pH dependence of E(TiO2/TiO2.e(-),H+), the release of protons upon oxidation, the lack of correlation with zeta potentials, the similarity of capped and uncapped NPs, and the small change in the potential and BDFE from the first to the last electron/proton pair (H atom) removed. This behavior is suggested to be the norm for redox-active oxide/water interfaces.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000759189300002	34967207

The surface morphology and microstructure of the coating were investigated by scanning electron microscopy. The electrocatalytic activity of the anodes was assessed by polarization curves and voltammetric charge at 25 degrees C and 1.0 mol/L in aqueous H2SO4. The results show that the current density on the Ti/SnO2+Sb2O3/RuO2+PbO2 electrodes increases at a constant electrode potential and the voltammetric charge also increases at a constant scanning rate with increasing the content of RuO2, it means that the electrocatalytic activity of the electrodes rises when RuO2 content increases. Accelerated life tests were performed at 60 degrees C and 1.0 mol/L in aqueous H2SO4 with an anodic current of 2.0 A/cm(2). The experimental results show that the accelerated lifetime decreases with increasing RuO2 content, but comparing with the electrodes without an intermediate layer, the accelerated lifetime of Ti/SnO2+Sb2O3/RuO2+PbO2 electrodes is prolonged obviously. The SEM analysis reveals that surfaces of the electrodes take on a variety of morphology with variation of the content of RuO2, which probably affect the electrocatalytic activity and the lifetime of the anodes.									6	12	0	0	1	0	13			1002-185X			WOS:000245734700013

Among metal oxide semiconductors, iron oxide in the form of hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) is one of the most researched photo-anode materials, mainly due to its ability to absorb photons up to 600 nm combined to a set of desirable properties such as high photocorrosion resistance, environmental friendliness, large abundance and relatively low production costs. However, hematite main disadvantages are a low electrical conductivity and a high rate of charge recombination; both these shortcomings drastically limit functionality and efficiency of hematite-based photo-anodes in PEC devices. One-dimensional (1D) nanostructuring is a powerful tool to tackle such disadvantages as it provides the photoelectrode material with increased surface area along with directional charge transport properties and short charge diffusion distances to the electrolyte - these features can improve the lifetime of photo-generated charges and/or enhance the charge transfer efficiency, and can consequently lead to a superior photo-electrochemical performance. At the same time, chemical/physical modification can also compensate natural weaknesses of hematite in water photoelectolysis. The present mini-review outlines a series of most effective strategies for the fabrication of 1D hematite nanostructures as well as for their physicochemical modification, mainly by doping or co-catalyst decoration, to achieve superior PEC activity.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0942-9352			WOS:000528279600004

The photocatalytic performance was evaluated under light irradiation, which revealed that the 2D/2D BiOBr/UMOFNs Z-scheme photocatalyst exhibits higher photocatalytic degradation of phenol compared to pristine BiOBr and UMOFNs. A BiOBr/UMOFNs-40% (mass ratio for BiOBr and UMOFNs of 1:0.4) photocatalyst was found to show the best photocatalytic degradation efficiency and stability, reaching 99% phenol degradation under light irradiation of 270 min and maintaining 97% degradation after 5 recycling runs. Results obtained from a trapping experiment and electron paramagnetic resonance suggest that reactive OH and O-2(-) play a major role in phenol degradation. Photoluminescence and photocurrent results reveal that the excellent photocatalytic activity of the 2D/2D BiOBr/UMOFNs photocatalyst can be ascribed to the efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs through a direct Z-scheme system. This article provides a possible reference for designing Z-scheme photocatalysts by using MOFs and semiconductors for practical organic pollutant treatment.									11	1	0	0	1	0	11			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000584317400001	33053516

Herein, a novel silver and Ag2O co-doped TiO2 with fast electron transfer modified by nitrogen doping carbon dots was prepared via a facile chemical precipitation-reduction method. Under 50 min of visible light irradiation, the novel photocatalyst exhibited approximately 50% gaseous toluene degradation efficiency, which was ca. 9.7 times and 2.2 times higher than that of bare TiO2 and silver and Ag2O co-doped TiO2, respectively. Importantly, the photocatalyst also showed a stable structure and good recycling ability after 400 min of photocatalytic degradation with little amount of NCDs. Besides, the up-conversion effect of NCDs could emit high-energetic light and thus generate more e(-)-h(+) pairs, which could facilitate the SPR effect of Ag and thus showed strong visible light response because of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) excitation. Thus, the excellent photocatalytic performance could attribute to the synergetic effect of up-conversion effect of NCDs and SPR effect of silver which could both facilitate charge carriers separation and improve visible-light response. Finally, a possible mechanism for the excellent photocatalytic activity was proposed, in which the active species including center dot O-2(-) , center dot OH and h(+) were generated and contributed to photocatalytic process. The successful fabrication of DACT provides a potential strategy for the treatment of VOCs in practical applications.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1369-8001	1873-4081		WOS:000663687100002

Herein, a CoAl layered double hydroxide (CoAl-LDH) has been deposited in situ onto alpha-Fe2O3 nanoarrays. The PEC performances of the resulting composite photoanodes (CoAl-LDH/alpha-Fe2O3) towards water oxidation were investigated in neutral pH electrolyte. Contrastive experiments indicated that Co2+ in CoAl-LDH provided active catalytic sites for water oxidation, while Al3+ was inactive and offered support for the layered skeleton. CoAl-LDH could have a dual role as an efficient cocatalyst to lower the onset potential and enhance the photocurrent of alpha-Fe2O3, and as an effective protector of alpha-Fe2O3 from corrosion in neutral pH electrolyte. Relative to that of bare alpha-Fe2O3, a similar to 250 mV negatively shifted onset potential and an almost 9-fold enhancement in photocurrent density at 1.23 V vs. RHE were observed with CoAl-LDH/alpha-Fe2O3. Moreover, CoAl-LDH/alpha-Fe2O3 showed excellent stability at 1.23 V vs. RHE with a steady photocurrent of similar to 2 mA cm(-2) even after 2 h of irradiation, which was very close to 100% of the initial value. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis revealed that the charge transfer resistance at the interface of alpha-Fe2O3/electrolyte was significantly decreased by CoAl-LDH decoration. Using H2O2 as a hole scavenger, the charge injection efficiency at the interface of CoAl-LDH/alpha-Fe2O3 and electrolyte was recorded as 84% at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which was 4-fold higher than that at the interface of alpha-Fe2O3 and electrolyte. This work demonstrates that CoAl-LDH decorated semiconductors have great potential as efficient and stable photoanodes towards high PEC performance in neutral pH electrolyte.									46	4	0	0	3	0	46			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000400983400045

We introduce a method to compute the non-equilibrium ionization and cooling of diffuse gas exposed to the EGB. Our method iterates the ionization states of the 11 elements that dominate the cooling (H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Si, Mg, S, Ca and Fe) and uses tabulated ion-by-ion cooling and photo-heating efficiencies to update the temperature of the gas. Our reaction network includes radiative and di-electric recombination, collisional ionization, photoionization, Auger ionization and charge transfer. We verify that our method reproduces published results for collisional equilibrium, collisional non-equilibrium and photoionized equilibrium. Non-equilibrium effects can become very important in cooling gas, particularly below 10(6) K. Photoionization and non-equilibrium effects both tend to boost the degree of ionization and to reduce cooling efficiencies. The effect of the EGB is larger for lower densities (i.e. higher ionization parameters). Hence, photoionization affects (equilibrium and non-equilibrium) cooling more under isochoric than under isobaric conditions. Non-equilibrium effects are smaller in the presence of the EGB and are thus overestimated when using collisional-only processes. The inclusion of the EGB alters the observational diagnostics of diffuse, metal-enriched gas (e.g. metal absorption lines probed in quasar sight lines) even more significantly than the cooling efficiencies. We argue that the cooling efficiency should be considered if ionization models are used to infer physical conditions from observed line ratios, as the a priori probability of observing gas is lower if its cooling time is shorter. We provide online tables of ionization fractions and cooling efficiencies, as well as other data, for equilibrium and non-equilibrium scenarios, and both with and without an EGB. Cooling efficiencies and diagnostics of the physical state of diffuse gas can become highly inaccurate if ionization equilibrium is assumed or if the existence of the ionizing background is ignored.									105	0	0	0	0	0	105			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000323638200010

However, the photocatalyst suffers faster recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and a low visible light absorption efficiency. In this work, the ternary Aggrafted gC3N4-gC3N4 heterostructures were synthesized using thermal polycondensation of urea and thiourea, followed by photo-deposition of the silver from silver nitrate. The formation of S-scheme heterojunction was confirmed through XRD, VB XPS, UV-Vis, Mott-Schottky, EPR and PL analyses. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed the presence of nitrogen vacancies with Ag grafting. The H2 production rate was the highest at 10.1 mmol g(-1)h- 1 with 2.5Ag/gC3N4-gC3N4, which was 3 and 8 times higher than that over gC3N4-gC3N4 and gC3N4, respectively. The addition of Ag mainly contributed to enhance the photocatalytic activity of the heterojunction due to its dual-function. Firstly, silver is attributed to enhance the localized surface plasmon resonance, which broadened the visible light absorption and secondly, the abundant electron capture due to the high Schottky barrier. Moreover, the existence of nitrogen vacancies further improved the separation of charge carriers and helped in carrier transportation. This work provides a new S-scheme heterostructure strategy for the sustainable utilization of solar radiation in the production of H2 from water splitting at higher rates.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000652634600003

We have investigated the innate immune response of chicken monocytes to ligands of TLR3 and TLR9, poly I:C (an analog of viral double-stranded RNA) and CpG-ODN (a CpG-motif containing oligodeoxydinucleotide) by measuring the induction of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis in chicken monocytes. Our results show that poly I:C and CpG-ODN synergized the induction of NO. When stimulated separately, CpG-ODN induced significant NO production in the chicken monocytes-1 whereas, poly I:C stimulated very little NO production. In combination, CpG-ODN and poly I:C induced significantly higher level of NO in chicken monocytes than either agonist alone. The addition of poly I:C prior to or simultaneously with CpG-ODN was required for the synergy. No synergistic effects on NO production were observed when monocytes were stimulated with combinations of CpG-ODN or poly I:C with other TLR agonists. Unlike chicken monocytes, cells of a chicken macrophage cell line, HD11, were readily stimulated to produce NO by both CpG-ODN and poly I:C with no synergism on NO induction when HD11 cells were stimulated by a combination of CpG-ODN and poly I:C. Using a pharmacological inhibitor, we also demonstrated that double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) is indispensable for stimulation of NO production by CpG-ODN alone or in combination with poly I:C in both chicken peripheral blood monocytes and HD11 macrophage cells. Our results show that a combination of bacterial DNA and dsRNA induces an enhanced inflammatory immune response that has both antiviral and antibacterial activity in primary chicken monocytes.

This research aimed to investigate the contribution of crystallographic texture on the anisotropic electrochemical/corrosion behavior of a L-BPF processed commercially pure nickel (Ni) cube along surfaces oriented parallel and perpendicular to the building direction. In order to exclusively assess the role of crystallographic texture on the corrosion behavior, the electrochemical measurements were performed on different surfaces of the L-PBF processed cube in alkaline and acidic chloride-free solutions. Orientation microscopy analysis showed that the morphology of grains along the parallel surface to the building direction was columnar, and their crystallographic orientation distribution was uniform. In contrast, the morphology of grains on the surface aligned normal to the building direction was equiaxed and highly oriented toward [110]. This bias in the orientation distribution led to the highest residual affinity for oxidation in comparison to the other planes in the FCC (Face Centered Cubic) crystal structure. In the case of 1 M NaOH solution, the hydroxide layer formed at the exposed surface did not effectively control the cation ejection from the surface. Also, surfaces oriented normal to the building direction, with lower surface atomic density, showed an elevated dissolution rate. Conversely, in the case of 1 M H2SO4 solution, a more integrated and thicker oxide film formed in comparison to the surface aligned parallel to the building direction. This fact led to reduced surface dissolution. This study shows that engineering the topology and microstructure based on the desired properties can remarkably promote the performance of additively manufactured materials in extreme environments.

We characterize the mineralogy, elemental composition, and isotopic composition of 28 authigenic carbonate nodules recovered from coal-bearing forearc sediments offshore Shimokita Peninsula (Japan) to better understand fluid sources, diagenetic environments, and biogeochemical processes associated with subsiding sediments containing high organic carbon content. The carbonate nodules were collected at Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Site C0020 from sediment cores between 1604 and 2460 m below seafloor (mbsf) spanning a transition from terrestrial to marine depositional environments. These carbonates range from < 1 cm to 9 cm thick and most commonly occur in sandstones/sands adjacent to the 2 km-deep early Miocene to late Oligocene lignite beds deposited within terrestrial to estuarine sediments. Almost all samples are composed of relatively pure siderite (74-92% FeCO3) with two interlayered siderite and low Mg-calcite samples below 2400 mbsf. High delta C-13 (-1.2 to +12.8 parts per thousand VPDB) signatures indicate the carbonates were precipitated within the zone of methanogenesis, which was likely coupled to the weathering of silicate minerals, with no evidence of any carbonate produced as a result of anaerobic oxidation of methane. Low delta O-18 values (-7.4 to -1.6 parts per thousand VPDB) suggest the influence of meteoric waters during carbonate precipitation. High Sr-87/Sr-86 values in the carbonates within the main coal-bearing unit relative to the values in pore water suggest mineral precipitation began more shallowly than their current depth and was influenced by meteoric water and/or volcanic material weathering endmembers. Low rare earth element (REE) content and enrichment in heavier REEs suggest carbonate precipitation occurred mainly during early burial. Iron availability for siderite precipitation was likely influenced by microbial reduction of Fe (oxyhydr)oxides. The precipitation of these carbonates likely began within shallow freshwater/brackish aquifers and continued with burial, based on their composition and host strata.									9	1	0	0	3	0	9			0264-8172	1873-4073		WOS:000442058400019		
J	Kawahara, Naoki; Shigematsu, Kotaro; Miyadai, Toshiaki; Kondo, Ryuji								Comparison of bacterial communities in fish farm sediments along an organic enrichment gradient								AQUACULTURE				287	1-2			107	113		10.1016/j.aquaculture.2008.10.003				FEB 1 2009	2009	Aquaculture is of major industrial importance world wide and this has led to concerns over the impact of fish farming on previously pristine marine environments. Fish firm sediments receive a large amount of organic matter due to uneaten food and fecal materials. This organic enrichment of sediment influences the biogeochemical process and benthic microbial Communities. This study was performed to investigate the effect Of pollution from marine fish farms oil the bacterial community structure in the underlying sediments. Sediment samples were collected at four stations along all organic enrichment gradient oil the coast of Wakasa Bay in Southern Fukui Prefecture, Japan between April 2004 and December 2006. Sagami Bay sediments were also used is a non-fish firming reference site. The bacterial community composition was assessed using PCR amplification, cloning, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis of 16S rDNA using directly extracted sediment DNA. Most of the clones sequenced fell into six major lineages of the domain Bacteria: gamma-, delta-, epsilon-Proteobocteria, Acidobacteria/Holophago. Bacteroidetes, and Planctomycetes. Although there were no significant differences in the bacterial community Structures among the sediment samples except for Sagami Bay, a minor change in the composition of 16S rDNA operational taxonomy units (OTUs) between sites was recognized. 16S rDNA sequences related to the gamma-Proteobacteria were recovered with relatively higher frequencies from unpolluted sediments than from Polluted sediments. In contrast, the most abundant clone sequences from polluted sediment samples were grouped with delta-Proteobacteria. Our data suggests organic enrichment of sediment may influence the composition of bacterial communities; and the delta-Proteobacteria were found and selected for within polluted fish farm sediments.

Herein, a newly designed hybrid catalyst with manganese-doped FeNi-S encapsulated into graphene oxide (Mn@FeNi-S/GO) with unprecedented electrocatalytic activity was developed by simple one-step heat treatment followed by sonication. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and N-2 sorption isotherm demonstrated the successful formation of Mn@FeNi-S/GO. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) further confirmed the kinetic-favourable adsorption of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) onto the surface sites of Mn@FeNi-S/GO. Additionally, the synergetic effects between Mn@FeNi-S and GO are regarded as significant contributors to an efficient electron transfer path, and they promote the capture of H2O2 in hybrid catalysts. Under an optimal condition, a biosensor-based Mn@FeNi-S/GO electrode exhibits a high sensitivity of 8.929 mu A mu M-1 cm(-2) and a detection limit of 8.84 nM with a wide detection range for H2O2 and excellent selectivity; also, it is capable of online monitoring H2O2 derived from apple juice and human blood serum.									25	1	0	0	4	0	25			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000520487300020	32108852

JOURNAL OF PHYTOPATHOLOGY				153	6			337	343		10.1111/j.1439-0434.2005.00982.x				JUN 2005	2005	The aim of the present investigation was to test the hypothesis that the cypress canker caused by a fungus (Seiridium cardinale) infection induced effects on photosynthesis which could be related to photoinhibition and the process of recovery in susceptible and resistant needles. Photoinhibition of photosynthesis and recovery was studied in canker-infected susceptible and resistant needles of cypress (Cupressus sempervirens L.) under controlled conditions (irradiation of detached needles to approximately 1900 mu mol/m(2)/s). The degree of photoinhibition was determined by means of the ratio of variable to maximum chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence (F-v/F-m) and electron transport measurements. The potential efficiency of photosystem (PS) II, F-v/F-m declined, and F-o increased significantly in canker-susceptible needles, while F-o did not change in resistant needles. In isolated thylakoids, high light (HL) decreased the rate of whole chain and PS II activity markedly more in susceptible than in resistant needles. A smaller reduction of PS I activity was noticed only in susceptible needles. Upon subsequent dark incubation, fast recovery was noticed in both needle types and reached maximum rates of PS II efficiency similar to those noticed in non-photoinhibited needles. The artificial exogenous electron donors such as diphenyl carbazide (DPC), NH2OH and Mn2+ failed to restore the HL induced loss of PS II activity in susceptible needles, while DPC and NH2OH significantly restored it in resistant needles. The results suggest that HL inactivates the donor side of PS II in resistant and the acceptor side of PS II in susceptible needles. The results on the quantification of the PS II reaction centre protein D1 and 33 kDa protein of water-splitting complex following HL exposure showed pronounced differences between susceptible and resistant needles. The marked loss of PS II activity in HL-irradiated needles was due to the marked loss of D1 protein in susceptible and 33 kDa protein in resistant needles, respectively.									7	0	0	0	6	0	7			0931-1785	1439-0434		WOS:000229581200005

It was previously shown that the Arabidopsis plastidic 2-oxoglutarate/malate transporter (AtpOMT1) and the general dicarboxylate transporter (AtpDCT1) play crucial roles at the interface between carbon and nitrogen metabolism. However, based on the in vitro transport properties of the recombinant transporters, it was hypothesized that AtpOMT1 might play a dual role, also functioning as an oxaloacetate/malate transporter, which is a crucial but currently unidentified component of the chloroplast malate valve. Here, we test this hypothesis using Arabidopsis T-DNA insertional mutants of AtpOMT1. Transport studies revealed a dramatically reduced rate of oxaloacetate uptake into chloroplasts isolated from the knockout plant. CO2-dependent O-2 evolution assays showed that cytosolic oxaloacetate is efficiently transported into chloroplasts mainly by AtpOMT1, and supported the absence of additional oxaloacetate transporters. These findings strongly indicate that the high-affinity oxaloacetate transporter in Arabidopsis chloroplasts is AtpOMT1. Further, the knockout plants showed enhanced photo-inhibition under high light due to greater accumulation of reducing equivalents in the stroma, indicating malfunction of the malate valve in the knockout plants. The knockout mutant showed a phenotype consistent with reductions in 2-oxoglutarate transport, glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase activity, subsequent amino acid biosynthesis and photorespiration. Our results demonstrate that AtpOMT1 acts bi-functionally as an oxaloacetate/malate transporter in the malate valve and as a 2-oxoglutarate/malate transporter mediating carbon/nitrogen metabolism.									74	2	0	0	70	0	76			0960-7412	1365-313X		WOS:000285765700002	21175886

The structural, functional groups, morphology, particle size, optical properties of synthesized g-C3N4-CuO/ ZnO composites were analyzed using various techniques such as XRD, XPS, FTIR, SEM, TEM, UV-Vis, photoluminescence (PL), and photocurrent-time (PT) measurements. Further, the photocatalytic capacity of the synthesized composite was examined by the evolution of hydrogen production through the water-splitting using visible light and the study of methylene blue dye (MB) degradation under solar irradiation. The g-C3N4-CuO/ZnO composites showed the enhanced photocatalytic activity as compared to the pure bulk form of g-C3N4, DMSO-g-C3N4, and CuO/ZnO. Also, it showed an increment of photo -catalytic activity in the treatment of pollutants as well as increased production of hydrogen gas under visible light. These enhanced photocatalytic activities could be attributed to the combined effect between g-C3N4 and CuO/ZnO crystalline phases. The maximum quantum efficiency and degradation of the MB dye by g-C3N4-CuO/ZnO composite were 5.5% and 99%, respectively. The mechanism of enhanced photocatalytic activity of the g-C3N4-CuO/ZnO composite was also discussed in this work. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The predominant causative pathogen of this disease is the intra-erythrocytic parasite Babesia microti. The thioredoxin system is one of the major weapons that is used in the resistance to the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) produced by host immune system. In other intra-erythrocytic apicomplexans like the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, anti-oxidative proteins are promising targets for the development of anti-parasitic drugs. However, to date, the sequences and biological properties of thioredoxins and thioredoxin-like molecules of B. microti remain unknown. Understanding the molecular characterization and function of B. microti thioredoxins may help to develop anti-Babesia drugs and controlling babesiosis.Methods: The full-length B. microti thioredoxin 2 (BmTrx2) gene was obtained using a rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method, and the deduced BmTrx2 amino acid sequence was analyzed using regular bioinformatics tools. Recombinant BmTrx2 protein was expressed in vitro and purified using His-tag protein affinity chromatography resins. Reverse transcription PCR, quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot were employed to detect the expression and native proteins of BmTrx2. Indirect immunofluorescence assay was used to localize BmTrx2 in B. microti. Bovine insulin reduction assays were used to determine the enzyme activity of the purified recombinant BmTrx2 protein.Results: The full-length BmTrx2 was 564 bp with a 408 bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 135 amino acids. The predicted molecular weight of the protein was 15.5 kDa. A conserved thioredoxin-like family domain was found in BmTrx2. The expression of BmTrx2 was upregulated on both the third and eighth day post-infection in mice, whereas expression was downregulated during the beginning and later stages. The results of Western blot analysis showed the native BmTrx2 in parasite lysates could be detected by mouse anti-BmTrx2 serum and that the recombinant BmTrx2 protein could be recognized by serum of B. microti-infected mice. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that BmTrx2 localized in the cell cytoplasm of B. microti merozoites in B. microti-infected red blood cells. The results of bovine insulin reduction assay indicated the purified recombinant BmTrx2 protein possesses antioxidant enzyme activity. Dihydroartemisinin and quinine, known anti-malaria drugs, and clindamycin, a known anti-babesiosis drug, induced significantly higher upregulation of BmTrx2 mRNA.Conclusions: Our results indicate that BmTrx2 is a functional enzyme with antioxidant activity and may be involved in the response of B. microti to anti-parasite drugs.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			1756-3305			WOS:000422887400005	29335000

In this study, three ThERF genes, with significant differences in expression profile in response to flooding stress, were identified from the transcriptomics data acquired from Taxodium hybrid 'Zhongshanshan 406' (T. mucronatum Tenore x T. distichum (L.) Rich) under waterlogging stress: ThERF15, ThERF39 and ThRAP2.3 (GenBank ID: KY463467, KY463468 and KY463470, respectively). The full-length cDNA of each of the three ERFs was obtained using the RACE (rapid amplification cDNA ends) method, and all three were intron-free. Multiple protein sequence alignments indicated that ThERF15, ThERF39 and ThRAP2.3 proteins all had only one AP2-ERF domain and belonged to the ERF subfamily. A transient gene expression assay demonstrated that ThERF15, ThERF39 and ThRAP2.3 were all localized to the nucleus. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) revealed that the expression of ThERF15, ThERF39 and ThRAP2.3 exhibited significant differences, compared with the control, in response to two levels of flooding treatment (half-flooding or total-submergence) of 'Zhongshanshan 406'. Quantification of ethylene concentration revealed that ethylene was more relevant to the level of expression than the period of flooding treatment. Based on the experimental results above ThERF15, ThERF39 and ThRAP2.3 were identified as being related to the regulation of downstream flooding-responsive gene expression in 'Zhongshanshan 406'. ThRAP2.3 is most likely to be a key downstream-response ERF gene to respond to the output of the ethylene signal generated by flooding stress.									8	1	0	0	6	0	9			2167-8359			WOS:000427323300003	29576943

It consists of Hb-alpha and Hb-beta subunits, which are normally expressed by cells of erythroid lineage. However, till recently, it was not known whether non-erythroid cells like vaginal cells synthesize Hb and whether it has any functional significance. Therefore, we designed the following objectives: (1) to establish in-vitro culture system of human primary vaginal epithelial cells (hPVECs), (2) to determine whether Hb-alpha and Hb-beta proteins are truly synthesized by hPVECs, (3) to evaluate the effect of LPS (lipopolysaccharide) on the expression of Hb-alpha and Hb-beta proteins (4) to decipher the significance of the Hb-alpha and Hb-beta expression in hPVECs and (5) to determine the molecular mechanism regulating the expression of Hb-alpha in hPVECs. To accomplish these studies, we applied a battery of assays such as RT-PCR, qRT-PCR, Flow cytometry, western blot, and immunofluorescence, Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). The results revealed the expression of Hb-alpha and Hb-beta at both mRNA and protein level in hPVECs. The expression was significantly upregulated following LPS treatment (10 mu g/m1 for 6 hrs) and these results are comparable with the expression induced by LPS in human vaginal epithelial cell line (VK2/E6E7). These cells constitutively produced low levels of pro-inflammatory (IL-6) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines. Also, the response of phosphorylated (p65)-NF-kappa B to LPS was upregulated with increased expression of IL-6, Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) and human beta defensin-1 (hBD-1) in hPVECs and VK2/E6E7 cells. However, Bay 11-7082 treatment (5 mu M for 24 hrs) could neutralize the effect of LPS-induced p65-NF-kappa B activity and represses the production'of Hb-alpha and Hb-beta. The results of EMSA revealed the presence of putative binding sites of NF-kappa B in the human Hb-alpha promoter region (nt-115 to-106). ChIP analysis confirmed the binding of NF-kappa B to Hb-alpha promoter. In conclusion, the present findings revealed for the first time that hPVECs synthesized Hb-alpha and Hb-beta and the expression is comparable with the expression of VK2/E6E7 cells. The identification of NF-KB regulatory sequences in Hb-alpha promoter, whose activation is associated with immune response of hPVECs, indicating Hb-alpha and Hb-beta may act as an endogenous antimicrobial defense protein against vaginal inflammation/infections.									9	2	0	0	6	0	11			1932-6203			WOS:000393712500022	28178273

Moreover, the hydrothermal carbonization process is accomplished under mild and simple conditions and is adaptable for wide feedstocks. As a result, conversion of biomass into hydro-char is very promising. In order to promote the progress of the hydrothermal synthesis of carbon microspheres and hydrothermal utilization of biomass, in this study, glucose was carbonized in a subcritical hydrothermal environment, and the process and results were studied. All the experiments were carried out in a 500 mL autoclave of 316 L stainless steel that was heated by an electrical heater. For each test, a certain amount of glucose and 100 g of deionized water were fed to the autoclave and sealed. Then, air was purged out of the reactor with argon and the initiative pressure was set at 0 MPa. After each reaction in a certain temperature and residence time, the gas was discharged and the reactor was rapidly cooled to below 90℃ with internal cooling by a U-loop and external fan. When the temperature dropped to room temperature, the hydro-char was collected by filtration, washed with deionized water and acetone several times, and dried in 105℃ for 12 h at last. The obtained hydro-chars were examined by means of Elemental Analysis, X-ray Diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscope, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. The results showed that there were a lot of carbon spheres in the hydro-char which were distributed between 0.6-7 mum. Moreover, the physicochemical properties of hydro-char were influenced by the temperature, glucose addition and residence time. Within the HTC condition of temperature (170-280℃), residence time (0.5-12 h) and addition of glucose (1-12 g/100mL), suitable temperature (220℃) and residence time (4 h), and small addition of glucose (<6 g/100mL) favored obtaining carbon microspheres with smooth surface and good sphericity. Higher temperature (<280℃), larger addition of glucose and longer residence time were conductive to improving the yield of hydro-char and carbon fixation in it. Hydro-char with excellent morphology was obtained under conditions of 220℃ and 6 g/100ml for 4 h from glucose. The hydro-char contained a large number of microspheres which had a smooth surface, good spherictiy and distributed in the range of 0.7~1.9 mum; At the same time, the hydro-char was an amorphous carbon with a tiny BET surface area and only few mesopores and macropores; The hydro-char contained a lot of oxygen-containing functional groups which were mainly -OH and -C=O; The degree of carbonization on the surface was higher than that in the core. The formation of hydro-char was done like this:, the feedstock was firstly hydrolyzed into many intermediate products which would be transformed into microsphere cores through dehydration and polymerization, the microsphere cores then formed into dispersed colloidal particles by the adsorption of surrounding molecules and eventually evolved into carbon microspheres or lump coke. The research results laid out a data reference for the process control of hydrothermal microspheres preparation and hydrothermal utilization of biomass.			为了解生物质水热炭化过程中焦炭的形成机制及其理化结构的演变机理,该文以葡萄糖为原料,利用高温高压反应釜,对葡萄糖在水热环境中炭化的反应过程和焦炭的表面物理结构及微观化学组成进行了系统的分析。研究发现,葡萄糖经过水热处理,可以获得富含炭微球的无定形水热焦炭,这些炭微球粒径分布在0.6~7mum之间,而通过控制水热过程的温度、葡萄糖添加量和停留时间,则可对其收率、形貌、化学组成等理化性质产生重要影响。在220℃,4h,6g/100mL的水热条件下,炭微球粒径最小且均匀,平均粒径约为1.54mum;在220℃,4h,12g/100mL的水热条件下,焦炭收率最高为38.92%。水热焦炭中含有大量的芳香环结构和含氧官能团,具有很强的亲水性,其表面碳化程度高于内核。水热焦炭的形成主要是一系列脱水、聚合、凝结、芳香化、胶体作用的结果。研究结果为生物质水热法制备炭微球的过程控制提供参考。						9	17	0	0	0	0	26			1002-6819			CSCD:4820716		
J	Xu, Dongbo; Xia, Teng; Xu, Huimin; Fan, Weiqiang; Shi, Weidong					Xu, Dongbo/0000-0003-2822-042X			Synthesis of ternary spinel MCo2O4 (M = Mn, Zn)/BiVO4 photoelectrodes for photolectrochemical water splitting								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				392						124838	10.1016/j.cej.2020.124838				JUL 15 2020	2020	Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) as a promising photoelectrode has been received an increasing attention for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. However, the severe surface charge recombination of BiVO4 still limited the PEC water splitting efficiency. Herein, a simple process is developed for preparing ternary spinel MCo2O4 (M = Mn, Zn) nanoparticles on the surface of BiVO4 photoelectrode as an efficient co-catalyst and constructed pn junction to suppress the surface charge recombination. The as-prepared best MnCo2O4/BiVO4 and ZnCo2O4/BiVO4 photoelectrodes have exhibited a remarkable photocurrent density of 2.8 mA/cm(2) and 2.2 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under AM 1.5 G illumination, which is about 3.5 and 2.7 times than the bare BiVO4 photoelectrode, respectively. The deposition of MCo2O4 (M = Mn, Zn) co-catalyst has yielded a large cathodic shift in the onset potential of BiVO4. The PEC studies suggest that the MCo2O4 (M = Mn, Zn) co-catalyst could boost the photogenerated holes transference and enhance the charge separation efficiency in the semiconductor-electrolyte interface. The prominent PEC activity shows that the MCo2O4/BiVO4 photoelectrodes could be used in solar water splitting.									44	1	0	0	4	0	45			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000525862500146

To date, most studies of endophytes have focused on the influence of these microorganisms on plant growth and physiology and their role in plant defenses against biotic and abiotic stressors; however, to the best of our knowledge, the ability of endophytes to produce melatonin has not been reported. In the present study, we isolated and identified root-dwelling bacteria from three grapevine varieties and found that, when cultured under laboratory conditions, some of the bacteria strains secreted melatonin and tryptophan ethyl ester. The endophytic bacterium Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SB-9 exhibited the highest level of in vitro melatonin secretion and also produced three intermediates of the melatonin biosynthesis pathway: 5-hydroxytryptophan, serotonin, and N-acetylserotonin. After B. amyloliquefaciens SB-9 colonization, the plantlets exhibited increased plant growth. Additionally, we found that, in grapevine plantlets exposed to salt or drought stress, colonization by B. amyloliquefaciens SB-9 increased the upregulation of melatonin synthesis, as well as that of its intermediates, but reduced the upregulation of grapevine tryptophan decarboxylase genes (VvTDCs) and a serotonin N-acetyltransferase gene (VvSNAT) transcription, when compared to the un-inoculated control. Colonization by B. amyloliquefaciens SB-9 was also able to counteract the adverse effects of salt- and drought-induced stress by reducing the production of malondialdehyde and reactive oxygen species (H2O2 and O-2(-)) in roots. Therefore, our findings demonstrate the occurrence of melatonin biosynthesis in endophytic bacteria and provide evidence for a novel form of communication between beneficial endophytes and host plants via melatonin.									93	6	0	0	78	1	99			1664-462X			WOS:000383531800001	28119730

In this study, we identified polymorphism in the blood clam Tegillarca granosa Hb (Tg-Hb) genes and investigated the association of this polymorphism with resistance/susceptibility to Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Analysis of the 540 sequences revealed 28 SNPs in the coding region of three Tg-Hbs, corresponding to about one SNP per 48 bp. Three SNPS: HbIIA-E2-146, HbIIB-E2-23, HbIIB-E2-121 showed a significant association with resistance/susceptibility to V. parahaemolyticus (P < 0.05). To further demonstrate that three significant SNPs of Tg-Hbs is associated with resistance of clams to V. parahaemolyticus, SNPs were genotyped in V. parahaemolyticus resistant strain clams and the wild base population from which this strain was derived. The results indicated that the nonsynonymous mutation T allele at HbIIA-E2-146 and A allele at HbIIB-E2-23 are associated with V. parahaemolyticus resistance in the blood clam, and its association with disease resistance may be due to its cause changes in amino acid sequences to a functional polymorphism. Together with previous bacterial challenge study, these results provides direct evidence that variation at HbIIA-E2-146 and HbIIB-E2-23 are associated with disease resistance in the blood clam, and these two polymorphic loci could be potential gene markers for the future molecular selection of strains that are resistant to diseases caused by V. parahaemolyticus.

However, we do not fully understand the mechanisms that underlie embryonic cardiovascular short- or long-term responses to hypoxia in most species. We therefore measured cardiac growth and function in snapping turtle embryos incubated under normoxic (N21; 21% O-2) or chronic hypoxic conditions (H10; 10% O-2). We determined heart rate (f(H)) and mean arterial pressure (P-m) in acute normoxic (21% O-2) and acute hypoxic (10% O-2) conditions, as well as embryonic responses to cholinergic, adrenergic, and ganglionic pharmacological blockade. Compared with N21 embryos, chronic H10 embryos had smaller bodies and relatively larger hearts and were hypotensive, tachycardic, and following autonomic neural blockade showed reduced intrinsic f(H) at 90% of incubation. Unlike other reptile embryos, cholinergic and ganglionic receptor blockade both increased f(H). beta-Adrenergic receptor blockade with propranolol decreased f(H), and alpha-adrenergic blockade with phentolamine decreased P-m. We also measured cardiac mRNA expression. Cholinergic tone was reduced in H10 embryos, but cholinergic receptor (Chrm2) mRNA levels were unchanged. However, expression of adrenergic receptor mRNA (Adrb1, Adra1a, Adra2c) and growth factor mRNA (Igf1, Igf2, Igf2r, Pdgfb) was lowered in H10 embryos. Hypoxia altered the balance between cholinergic receptors, alpha-adrenoreceptor and beta-adrenoreceptor function, which was reflected in altered intrinsic f(H) and adrenergic receptor mRNA levels. This is the first study to link gene expression with morphological and cardioregulatory plasticity in a developing reptile embryo.									34	2	0	0	33	0	34			0363-6119	1522-1490		WOS:000319806500006	23552497

PCC 6803								BIOCHEMISTRY				38	9			2707	2715		10.1021/bi981981j				MAR 2 1999	1999	The deletion of the amino acids between Gly-351 and Thr-365 within the large, lumen-exposed, hydrophilic region (loop E) of the photosystem IT (PSII) chlorophyll a-binding protein CP47 produced a strain of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 that failed to assemble stable PSII centers [Eaton-Rye, J. J., and Vermaas, W. F. J. (1991) Plant Mel. Biol. 17, 1165-1177]. The importance of two conserved Phe residues at positions 362 and 363 within this deletion has been investigated. The F363R strain had impaired photoautotrophic growth and an enhanced sensitivity to photoinactivation, demonstrating that Phe is required at position 363 for normal PSII function. In contrast, photoautotrophic growth in strains N361K and F362R was unaffected. Uniquely, among the mutant strains tested, F363R was unable to grow under chloride-limiting conditions, and this effect was reversed by replacing chloride with bromide. The removal of the manganese-stabilizing protein (PSII-O), the 12 kDa extrinsic protein (PSII-U), and cytochrome c-550 (PSII-V) was investigated in each mutant in vivo. In N361K and F362R, removal of PSII-V produced a more deleterious effect than the removal of PSII-O, but even so, all strains remained photoautotrophic. In contrast, the absence of PSII-V and PSII-O in F363R produced obligate photoheterotrophic strains. The removal of PSII-U increased the susceptibility of PSII to heat inactivation and further decreased the stability of PSII in F363R, demonstrating that PSII-U can contribute to the stabilization of mutations that have been introduced into CP47. The order of importance of the selective removal of the extrinsic proteins in strains carrying mutations in loop E of CP47 was found to be as follows: Delta PSII-V greater than or equal to Delta PSII-O > Delta PSII-U.									31	0	0	0	30	0	31			0006-2960			WOS:000079013900012	10052941

The co-PAA solutions were used to fabricate fibers by dry-jet wet spinning, and thermal imidization was conducted to obtain polyimide copolymer (co-PI) fibers. The effects of the m-pHBOA moiety on molecular packing and physical properties of the prepared fibers were investigated. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic results confirmed that intra/intermolecular hydrogen bonds originated from the hydroxyl group and the nitrogen atom of the benzoxazole group and/or the hydroxyl group and the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group of cyclic imide. As-prepared PI fibers displayed homogenous and smooth surface and uniform diameter. The glass transition temperatures (T(g)s) of PI fibers were within 311-337 degrees C. The polyimide fibers showed 5% weight loss temperature (T-5%) at above 510 degrees C in air. Two-dimensional wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WXRD) patterns indicated that the homo-PI and co-PI fibers presented regularly arranged polymer chains along the fiber axial direction. The ordered molecular packing along the transversal direction was destroyed by introducing the m-pHBOA moiety. Moreover, the crystallinity and orientation factors increased with increasing draw ratio. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) results showed that it is beneficial to reduce defects in the fibers by increasing the draw ratio. The resultant PI fibers exhibited excellent mechanical properties with fracture strength and initial modulus of 2.48 and 89.73 GPa, respectively, when the molar ratio of p-PDA/m-pHBOA was 5/5 and the draw ratio was 3.0.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			0256-7679	1439-6203		WOS:000462256900006

Analysis of the raw ellipsometry data [psi(lambda (i)), Delta(lambda (i))] by applying the conventional Bruggeman effective medium theory and linear regression analysis provided details about the film microstructure: (i) the multilayer structure and the component layer thickness of the films; (ii) the volume fraction of the constituents (sp(3)- and sp(2)- bonded carbon) and of voids (f(v)) in the bulk layer (L-2); (iii) the inhomogeneity of the structure along the growth axis and its variation with the seeding density; and (iv) the surface roughness layer thickness (d(S)). A simplified three-layer structural model consisting of an interfacial layer, an intermediate (or bulk) layer, and a top surface roughness layer has been proposed that simulates the ellipsometry data reasonably well. The results obtained through ellipsometry modeling, such as surface roughness and overall film thickness, were compared with those from atomic force microscopy and profilometry, respectively, in order to validate the model employed. Typically, high surface roughness values around 60 nm were found for films grown under different substrate temperatures and oxygen-to-carbon ratios. It was also found that a combination of relatively high substrate temperature and O/C ratio can be used to reduce the surface roughness to around 25 nm. In general, the void fraction (f(v)) of the bulk layer decreases as a function of seeding density, indicating the formation of a denser film. The sp(2)-bonded carbon fraction (f(sp)(C)(2)) also varies with the process parameters. These results (f(v) and f(sp)(2) (C)) for the bulk layer and its behavior with respect to process parameters are discussed.

Pathways to the formation of the S=7/2 S-2 state configuration								BIOCHEMISTRY				41	30			9580	9588		10.1021/bi0159938				JUL 30 2002	2002	The water-oxidizing complex of photosystem 11 cycles through five oxidation states, denoted S-i (i = 0-4), during water oxidation to molecular oxygen, which appears at the (transient) S-4 state. The recent detection of bimodal EPR signals from the S-3 state [Matsukawa, T., Mino, H., Yoneda, D., Kawamori, A. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 4072-4077] has drawn significant attention to this critical state. An interesting property of the S-3 state is the sensitivity to near-IR (NIR) light excitation. Excitation of the S-3 state by near-IR light at cryogenic temperatures induces among other signals a derivative-shaped EPR signal at g = 5 [Ioannidis, N., and Petrouleas, V. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 5246-5254]. The signal bears unexpected similarities to a signal observed earlier in samples that had undergone multiple turnovers and subsequently had been stored at 77 K for a week or longer [Nugent, J. H. A., Turconi, S., and Evans, M. C. W. (1997) Biochemistry 36, 7086-7096]. Recently, both signals were assigned to an S = 7/2 configuration of the Mn cluster [Sanakis, Y.,, Ioannidis, N., Sioros, G., and Petrouleas, V. (2001) J. Ani. Chem. Soc. 123, 10766-10767]. In the present study, we employ bimodal EPR spectroscopy to investigate the pathways of formation of this unusual state. The following observations are made: (i) The g = 5 signal evolves in apparent correlation with the diminution of the S3 state signals during the slow (tens of hours to several days range) charge recombination Of S-3 With Q(A)(-) at 77 K. The tyrosyl radical D-. competes with S-3 for recombination with Q(A)(-), the functional redox couple at cryogenic temperatures inferred to be D-./D-. Transfer to -50 degreesC and above results in the relaxation of the g = 5 to the multiline and g = 4.1 signals of the normal S-2 state. (ii) The transition Of S-3 to the state responsible for the g = 5 signal can be reversed by visible light illumination directly at -30 degreesC or by illumination at 4.2 K followed by brief (2 min) transfer to -50 degreesC in the dark. The latter step is required in order to overcome an apparent thermal activation barrier (charge recombination appears to be faster than forward electron transfer at 4.2 K). (iii) The "g = 5" state can be reached in a few tens of minutes at 4.2 K by near-IR light excitation of the S-3 state. This effect is attributed to the transfer of the positive hole from the Mn cluster to a radical (probably tyr Z), which recombines much faster than the Mn cluster with Q(A)(-), (iv) The above properties strongly support the assignment of the configuration responsible for the g = 5 signal to a modified S-2 state, denoted S-2'. Evidence supporting the assignment of the S-2' to a proton-deficient S, configuration is provided by the observation that the spectrum of S, at pH 8.1 (obtained by illumination of the S-1 state at -30 degreesC) contains a g = 5 contribution.									33	0	0	0	20	0	33			0006-2960			WOS:000177111600034	12135380

(Meliaceae)								GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH				14	1			1515	1525		10.4238/2015.February.20.7				2015	2015	Various organisms such as fungi and bacteria can live inside plants, inhabiting the aerial parts (primarily the leaves) without causing damage. These microorganisms, called endophytes, produce an extensive variety of compounds that can be useful for medical and agronomic purposes. Trichilia elegans A. Juss., belonging to the Meliaceae family, shows wide dispersion in South America, and phytochemical analyses from these plants and endophyte isolates have shown biological activity. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to verify the diversity of bacterial endophytes from T. elegans using partial sequencing of 16S rRNA, followed by phylogenetic analysis. Isolation was performed by cutting the leaves, after disinfection with 5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), in 1-2-mm(2) fragments, which were equally placed on dishes containing TSA and fungicide BENLATE at 75 mu g/mL. All dishes were incubated at 28 degrees C in the biochemical oxygen demand system for 5 days and periodically checked. Afterwards, the colonization frequency (%) was determined: (number of fragments colonized by bacteria/total number of fragments) x 100. Three isolations between September 2011 and March 2012 were performed; the growth frequency ranged between 1.6 and 13.6%. Following sequencing of 16S rRNA and phylogenetic analysis, the genera identified were: Staphylococcus, Bacillus, Microbacterium, Pseudomonas, and Pantoea. These results will provide important knowledge on the diversity of endophytic bacteria inhabiting medicinal plants, and a better understanding of the microbiome of T. elegans would reinforce the necessity of endophyte studies with a focus on their future applications in biotechnological areas of agriculture, medicine, and the environment.									12	0	0	0	11	0	12				1676-5680		WOS:000350232400132	25730091

We studied the spatial and temporal abundance of three key human potential pathogens V. parahaemolyticus, V. cholerae and V. vulnificus in northern tropical Australia, over the wet and dry seasons, to identify environmental parameters influencing their abundance. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis revealed that V. parahaemolyticus occurred more frequently and in higher abundance than V. cholerae and V. vulnificus across all locations examined. All three species were more abundant during the wet season, with V. parahaemolyticus abundance correlated to temperature and conductivity, whereas nutrient concentrations and turbidity best explained V. vulnificus abundance. In addition to these targeted qPCR analyses, we assessed the composition and dynamics of the entire Vibrio community using hsp60 amplicon sequencing. Using this approach, 42 Vibrio species were identified, including a number of other pathogenic species such as V. alginolyticus, V. mimicus and V. fluvialis. The Vibrio community was more diverse in the wet season, with temperature and dissolved oxygen as the key factors governing community composition. Seasonal differences were primarily driven by a greater abundance of V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus during the wet season, while spatial differences were driven by different abundances of V. harveyi, V. campbellii, V. cholerae and V. navarrensis. When we related the abundance of Vibrio to other bacterial taxa, defined using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, V. parahaemolyticus was negatively correlated to several taxa, including members of the Rickettsiales and Saccharimonadales, while V. vulnificus was negatively correlated to Rhobacteriaceae and Cyanobiaceae. In contrast, V. alginolyticus, V. harveyi and V. mediterranei were all positively correlated to Cyanobacteria. These observations highlight the dynamic nature of Vibrio communities and expands current understanding of the processes governing the occurrence of potentially pathogenic Vibrio spp. in tropical coastal ecosystems.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0141-1136	1879-0291		WOS:000672848900004	34242991

The decrease in photosystem 11 (PSII) activity induced by sulfur deprivation leads to anoxia, respiration becoming higher than photosynthesis, thereby allowing H, production. Two different electron transfer pathways, one PSH dependent and the other PSH independent, have been proposed to account for H, photoproduction. In this study, we investigated the contribution of both pathways as well as the acetate requirement for H-2 production in conditions of sulfur deficiency. By using 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU), a PSH inhibitor, which was added at different times after the beginning of sulfur deprivation, we show that PSII-independent H, photoproduction depends on previously accumulated starch resulting from previous photosynthetic activity. Starch accumulation was observed in response to sulfur deprivation in mixotrophic conditions (presence of acetate) but also in photoautotrophic conditions. However, no H-2 production was measured in photoautotrophy if PSH was not inhibited by DCMU, due to the fact that anoxia was not reached. When DCMU was added at optimal starch accumulation, significant H-2 production was measured. H-2 production was enhanced in autotrophic conditions by removing O-2 using N-2 bubbling, thereby showing that substantial H-2 production can be achieved in the absence of acetate by using the PSII-independent pathway. Based on these data, we discuss the possibilities of designing autotrophic protocols for algal H-2 photoproduction.									128	2	1	0	86	0	134			0099-2240	1098-5336		WOS:000232504000066	16204539

These proteins share a common domain architecture and promote bacterial adhesion to host cells. Here, we identified and characterized two putative inverse autotransporter genes in the fish pathogen Yersinia ruckeri NVH_3758, namely yrInv (for Y. ruckeri invasin) and yrIlm (for Y. ruckeri invasin-like molecule). When trying to clone the highly repetitive genes for structural and functional studies, we experienced problems in obtaining PCR products. PCR failures and the highly repetitive nature of inverse autotransporters prompted us to sequence the genome of Y. ruckeri NVH_3758 using PacBio sequencing, which produces some of the longest average read lengths available in the industry at this moment. According to our sequencing data, YrIlm is composed of 2603 amino acids (7812 bp) and has a molecular mass of 256.4 kDa. Based on the new genome information, we performed PCR analysis on four non-sequenced Y. ruckeri strains as well as the sequenced. Y. ruckeri type strain. We found that the genes are variably present in the strains, and that the length of yrIlm, when present, also varies. In addition, the length of the gene product for all strains, including the type strain, was much longer than expected based on deposited sequences. The internal repeats of the yrInv gene product are highly diverged, but represent the same bacterial immunoglobulin-like domains as in yrIlm. Using qRT-PCR, we found that yrIlm and yrInv are differentially expressed under conditions relevant for pathogenesis. In addition, we compared the genomic context of both genes in the newly sequenced Y. ruckeri strain to all available PacBio-sequenced Y. ruckeri genomes, and found indications of recent events of horizontal gene transfer. Taken together, this study demonstrates and highlights the power of Single Molecule Real-Time technology for sequencing highly repetitive proteins, and sheds light on the genetic events that gave rise to these highly repetitive genes in a commercially important fish pathogen.									16	0	0	0	14	0	16			1047-8477	1095-8657		WOS:000426227700011	28888816

Antibodies raised against these proteins from pea leaf mitochondria were used to probe Western blots of total leaf proteins of F. linearis Lag., M. arvensis (L.) DC and P. milioides Nees ex Trin. (C3-C4), and F. trinervia (Spring.) Mohr and P. miliaceum (L.) (C4). For all species, each antibody recognised specifically a protein of similar molecular weight to that in pea leaves. In leaves of M. arvensis the P protein was present in the mitochondria of the bundle-sheath cells but was undetectable in those of the mesophyll, whereas the L, T and H proteins and SHMT were present in both cell types. The density of immunogold labelling of SHMT on the mitochondria of mesophyll cells was less than that on those of the bundle-sheath cells, which correlates with the relative activities of SHMT in these cell types. These data reveal that the lack of functional GDC in the mesophyll cells of M. arvensis, which is the principal biochemical reason for reduced photorespiration in this species, is due to the loss of a single subunit protein. This lack of coordinate expression of the subunit proteins of GDC within a photosynthetic cell represents a clear difference between M. arvensis and other C3 and C3-C4 species. None of the GDC proteins was detectable in the mesophyll cells of the C3-C4 and C4 Flaveria and Panicum species but all were present in the bundle-sheath cells. The differences in the distribution of the GDC proteins in leaves of the C3-C4 species studied are discussed in relation to the evolution of photosynthetic mechanisms.									51	1	0	0	47	0	52			0032-0935			WOS:A1993LK46300006

The plant cell wall is a dynamic matrix and its plasticity is essential for cell growth and processing of environmental signals to cope with stresses. A few so-called resurrection plants likeCraterostigma plantagineumsurvive desiccation by implementing protection mechanisms. InC. plantagineum, the cell wall shrinks and folds upon desiccation to avoid mechanical and oxidative damage which contributes to cell integrity. Despite the high toxic potential, ROS are important molecules for cell wall remodeling processes as they participate in enzymatic reactions and act as signaling molecules. Here we analyzed theC. plantagineumgermin-like protein 1 (CpGLP1) to understand its contribution to cell wall folding and desiccation tolerance. The analysis of the CpGLP1 sequence showed that this protein does not fit into the current GLP classification and forms a new group within the Linderniaceae.CpGLP1transcripts accumulate in leaves in response to dehydration and ABA, and mannitol treatments transiently induceCpGLP1transcript accumulation supporting the participation of CpGLP1 in desiccation-related processes. CpGLP1 protein from cell wall protein extracts followed transcript accumulation and protein preparations from bacteria overexpressing CpGLP1 showed SOD activity. In agreement with cell wall localization, CpGLP1 interacts with pectins which have not been reported for GLP proteins. Our data support a role for CpGLP1 in the ROS metabolism related to the control of cell wall plasticity during desiccation inC.plantagineum.									10	0	0	0	8	1	11			0032-0935	1432-2048		WOS:000576817700001	33044571

High corticosterone may suppress immune function and competing energy demands may limit ability to mount an immune response. We hypothesized that HR mice have a reduced immune response and therefore a decreased ability to fight an infection by Trichinella spiralis, an ecologically relevant nematode common in mammals. Infections have an acute, intestinal phase while the nematode is migrating, reproducing and traveling throughout the bloodstream, followed by a chronic phase with larvae encysted in muscles. Adult males (generation 55 of the selection experiment) were sham-infected or infected by oral gavage with similar to 300 J1 T. spiralis larvae. During the chronic phase of infection, mice were given wheel access for 6 days, followed by 2 days of maximum aerobic performance trials. Two weeks post-infection, infected HR had significantly lower circulating immunoglobulin E levels compared with infected C mice. However, we found no statistical difference between infected HR and C mice in numbers of encysted larvae within the diaphragm. As expected, both voluntary running and maximum aerobic performance were significantly higher in HR mice and lower in infected mice, with no line type-by-infection interactions. Results complement those of previous studies suggesting decreased locomotor abilities during the chronic phase of T. spiralis infection. However, despite reduced antibody production, breeding for high voluntary wheel exercise does not appear to have a substantial negative impact on general humoral function.									12	0	0	0	12	0	12			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000326499900015	23948476

However, delta O-18 values of quartz veins (delta O-18 = 11 parts per thousand to 18 parts per thousand) and dolomite veins (delta O-18 = 13 parts per thousand to 24 parts per thousand) clearly indicate isotopic disequilibrium between quartz and dolomite. Hence, it is inferred that this isotopic disequilibrium primarily reflects a decrease in temperature between the quartz stage (similar to 180 degrees C) and the dolomite stage (similar to 120 degrees C). The delta C-13 values of CO2 dissolved in dolomite-hosted fluid inclusions (delta C-13 = -30 parts per thousand to -4 parts per thousand) and the delta C-13 values of dolomite (delta C-13 = -23.5 parts per thousand to -3.5 parts per thousand) indicate that the CO2 dissolved in the mineralizing brines originated from brine-graphite interactions in the basement. The resulting slight increase in the fluid partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) may have triggered dolomite precipitation instead of quartz.delta O-18 values of quartz veins and previously published delta O-18 values of the main alteration minerals around the U-ores (illite, chlorite and tourmaline) show that quartz and alteration minerals were isotopically equilibrated with the same fluid at similar to 180 degrees C. The REE concentrations in dolomite produce PAAS-normalized patterns that show some similarities with that of UO2 and are clearly distinct from that of the other main REE-bearing minerals in these environments (monazite, zircon and aluminum phosphate-sulfate (APS) minerals). The radiogenic isotope compositions of dolomite (Sr-87/Sr-86(i) = 0.7053 to 0.7161 and epsilon(Nd)(t) = -8.8 to -20.3) differ from one deposit to another, reflecting both heterogeneity in the basement geology and variable preservation of the original composition of brines. The previously published Sr-87/Sr-86(i) and epsilon(Nd)(t) values of UO2 compare with the most evolved dolomites, i.e. dolomites precipitated from brines that exchanged the most with the basement. This reinforces a close genetic link between dolomites and UO2 deposition and implies that UO2 deposition occurred in a cooling system during the transition from quartz to dolomite formation.									39	0	0	0	2	0	39			0016-7037	1872-9533		WOS:000318991300003

A new astronomy with radioactivity: Radiogenic carbon chemistry								NEW ASTRONOMY REVIEWS				55	5-6			155	165		10.1016/j.newar.2011.08.001				NOV-DEC 2011	2011	Historically it has been assumed that the necessary condition for carbon solids to grow in a cooling gas is higher bulk C abundance than O abundance. That condition is observed to be necessary and valid in AGB red-giant stars, inducing more general acceptance of that requirement. But for hydrogen-free supernova interiors that bulk-abundance condition is too restrictive. Within their expanding and cooling interiors, radioactivity maintains a prolific source for new free C. Very abundant CO molecules cannot retain oxidized carbon owing to their dissociation by energetic free electrons, which are created continuously by Compton scattering of gamma rays from newly created radioactive Co-56 nuclei. As the local gas temperature cools below 2000 K the free C atoms condense as carbonaceous grains, even in the presence of more abundant O atoms. The necessary conditions within supernovae must instead be expressed by three new rules:1. Free C atoms must exist abundantly. An abundance ratio C/O > 1 would indeed suffice for that end, but it is not necessary. Maintenance of abundant free C atoms occurs by radioactivity dissociating abundant CO molecules and also by lack of sufficient expansion time for complete oxidation of free C.2. Chemical reaction networks associating C atoms into C solids must be kinetically faster than their oxidation. That is, free C must be able to grow C solids faster than those solids can be oxidized.3. Insufficient time for oxidation of the new carbon solids must exist after the eventual depletion of free carbon prior to ejection into the interstellar medium. Those C solids could be termed metastable because they would be absent but for the chemical consequences of the radioactivity.I present some calculations for these expectations elaborating on figures from published works. The chemical dynamics provide a new discipline of astronomy with radioactivity in young supernova remnants. Carbonaceous supernova condensates (graphite and silicon carbide) extracted from meteorites provide abundant isotopic evidence of dynamic details of young supernova remnants. But expertise from molecular and chemical dynamics is needed to bring the theory to fruition. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									8	1	0	0	0	0	9			1387-6473			WOS:000300753600001

The activity was highly dependent on the hydrogen pretreatment conditions. Reduction at 550-650 degrees C led to high activity at room temperature, whereas as-synthesized or calcined samples did not show any activity at the same temperature. Using various characterization techniques, such as XRD, UV-vis, XPS, and EXAFS, we elucidated the structure and surface composition change during calcination and the reduction process. The XRD patterns show that particle size increased only during the calcination process on those Ag-containing samples. XPS and EXAFS data demonstrate that calcination led to complete phase segregation of the Au-Ag alloy and the catalyst surface is greatly enriched with AgBr after the calcination process. However, subsequent reduction treatment removed Br- completely and the Au-Ag alloy was formed again. The surface composition of the reduced Au-Ag@MCM (nominal Au/Ag = 3/1) was more enriched with Ag, with the surface Au/Ag ratio being 0.75. ESR spectra show that superoxides are formed on the surface of the catalyst and its intensity change correlates well with the trend of catalytic activity. A DFT calculation shows that CO and O-2 coadsorption on neighboring sites on the Au-Ag alloy was stronger than that on either An or Ag. The strong synergism in the coadsorption of CO and O-2 on the Au-Ag nanoparticle can thus explain the observed synergetic effect in catalysis.									213	17	2	0	12	0	222			1520-6106			WOS:000232482100021	16853427

These phenotypic responses, however, show variability between geographic locations or habitats (e.g., tidal). Physiological, morphological, and genetic differences occur in populations throughout a species' geographical range, which may have been shaped by regional abiotic and biotic variations. Few studies of C. virginica have explored the combined factors of physiological mechanisms of divergent phenotypes between locations and the genetic relationships of individuals between these locations. To characterize genetic relationships of four locations with aquacultured oysters along the North Carolina and Virginia coast, we sequenced a portion of cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) that revealed significant variation in haplotype distribution between locations. We then measured mitochondrial physiology and expression of the innate immunity response of hemocytes to lab acclimation and combined stress conditions to compare basal expression and stress response in oysters between these locations. For stress sensing genes, toll-like receptors had the strongest location-specific response to hypoxia and Vibrio, whereas mannose receptor and a stress-receptor were specific to hypoxia and bacteria, respectively. The expression of stress response genes also showed location-specific and stressor-specific changes in expression, particularly for big defensin and the complement gene Cq3. Our results further suggested that genetic similarity of oysters from different locations was not clearly related to physiological and molecular responses. These results are informative for understanding the range of physiological plasticity for stress responses in this commercially important oyster species. They also have implications in the oyster farming industry as well as conservation efforts to restore endangered native oyster beds.

The electrodes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and cyclic voltammetry. Degradation of 2,4-DCP depending on Er and chitosan contents was discussed. The results showed that Er2O3 and chitosan were scattered between the prevailing crystal structure of beta-PbO2 and thus decreased the internal stress of PbO2 film. Prior to each electrolysis, the modified PbO2 anode was first pre-saturated with 2,4-DCP solution for 360 min to preclude the 2,4-DCP decrease due to adsorption. Among the electrodes examined in our study, the highest adsorption and electrochemical degradation for 2,4-DCP and TOC removals that are due to oxidation and adsorption of the organic products onto the chitosan was observed on Er-chitosan-F-PbO2 electrode. At an applied current density of 5 mA cm(-2), the removal percentages of 2,4-DCP and TOC (solution volume: 180 mL, initial 2,4-DCP concentration: 90 mg L-1) were 95% after 120 min and 53% after 360 min, respectively. At Er amount of 10 mM in the precursor coating solution, the degradation and mineralization removal for 2,4-DCP on the Er-F-PbO2 electrode reached a maximum. At chitosan amount of 5 g L-1, the highest TOC removal on the Er-chitosan-F-PbO2 electrode was observed. Intermediates mainly including aliphatic carboxylic: acids were examined and a possible degradation pathway for 2,4-DCP in aqueous solution involving dechlorination and hydroxylation reactions was proposed.

We use the field data from two oxic, electron donor-poor, wastewater- impacted, sandy Canadian aquifers, (Cambridge and Muskoka sites) as an example of a calcareous and non-calcareous groundwater system, respectively, to validate our reaction network. After approximately 10 years of wastewater infiltration, P is effectively attenuated within the first 10 m downgradient of the source mainly through fast sorption onto calcite and Fe oxides. Slow, kinetic sorption contributes further to P removal, while precipitation of phosphate minerals (strengite, hydroxyapatite) is quantitatively unimportant in the saturated zone. Nitrogen (N) dynamics are also considered, but nitrate behaves essentially as a conservative tracer in both systems. The model-predicted advancement of the P plume upon continued wastewater discharge at the calcareous site is in line with field observations. Model results suggest that, upon removal of the wastewater source, the P plume at both sites will persist for at least 20 years, owing to desorption of P from aquifer solids and the slow rate of P mineral precipitation. Sensitivity analyses for the noncalcareous scenario (Muskoka) illustrate the importance of the sorption capacity of the aquifer solids for P in modulating groundwater N:P ratios in oxic groundwater. The model simulations predict the breakthrough of groundwater with high P concentrations and low N:P ratios after 17 years at 20 m from the source for an aquifer with low sorption capacity (< 0.02% w/w Fe(OH)(3)). In this type of system, denitrification plays a minor role in lowering the NT ratios because it is limited by the availability of labile dissolved organic matter. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

To understand how such responses differ in recently isolated populations (<11,000 years), we studied four Baltic populations of the nine-spined stickleback (Pungitius pungitius L.) from coastal locations (seasonal temperature range, 0-29 degrees C) and from colder, more thermally stable spring-fed ponds (1-19 degrees C). Salinity and predation pressure also differed between these locations. We acclimatized wild-caught fish to 6, 11, and 19 degrees C in common garden conditions for 4-6 months and determined their aerobic scope and hepatosomatic index (HSI). The freshwater fish from the colder (2-14 degrees C), predator-free pond population exhibited complete temperature compensation for their aerobic scope, whereas the coastal populations underwent metabolic rate reduction during the cold treatment. Coastal populations had higher HSI than the colder pond population at all temperatures, with cold acclimation accentuating this effect. The metabolic rates and HSI for freshwater fish from the pond with higher predation pressure were more similar to those of the coastal ones. Our results suggest that ontogenic effects and/or genetic differentiation are responsible for differential energy storage and metabolic responses between these populations. This work demonstrates the metabolic versatility of the nine-spined stickleback and the pertinence of an energetic framework to better understand potential local adaptations. It also demonstrates that instead of using a single acclimation temperature thermal reaction norms should be compared when studying individuals originating from different thermal environments in a common garden setting.

Recently, tungsten components with complex and fine structures have been required to face the increasing demand of material customization, which is difficult to manufacture through powder metallurgy because of the high hardness and intrinsic brittleness of tungsten. Laser power bed fusion (LPBF), as an important method of additive manufacturing technique, is a rapid forming technology based on 3D models. However, cracks would initiate and propagate due to steep temperature gradient and excessive thermal stress during rapid cooling of the LPBF process. Possible mitigation methods have achieved less crack density via preheating substrates, introducing secondary phases, and optimizing process parameters, with limited success in these cases. This study introduces tantalum carbide (TaC) into the tungsten matrix to explore a new method of reducing the crack density by forming submicron scale substructure strenthening phases. As a high melting point ceramic phase, TaC is well-matched with the lattice constant of tungsten. We reported optimized formability as well as achieving reduced cracks in LPBF tungsten while considering in-situ alloying. The tungsten caibide (W2 C) phase formation through in-situ reaction during LPBF process should be focused.Methods The 5-25 ttm tungsten powders are prepared by the electric explosion method of metal wires. The alloying powders of tungsten-5% TaC are prepared by spherical tungsten powders above and 5 Yo spongy TaC powders with 5 ttm median diameter and are mechanically mixed using a low-energy blender mixer. Pure tungsten and tungsten -5 Yo TaC parts are fabricated using an SLM280 2.0 machine with appropriate process parameters. Samples were built on stainless substrates. The scanning mode is rotated by 67 between adjacent layers with a "Zig-Zag" scan strategy. To limit oxidation during the LPBF process, the oxygen content inside the chamber is kept at less than 5 x 10(-4) (volume fraction). In the next step, the as-built samples are mechanically grounded and polished, followed by electropolishing in a 1. 5 Yo NaOH solution at a voltage of 9.8 V for seconds to reveal the morphology of true cracks. The microstructure of top and side view cross-sections and phase analysis are characterized using a scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffractometer ( XRD) with Cu-Ka radiation. The microhardness of tungsten and tungsten -5% TaC parts is also measured.Results and Discussions Tungsten-5 yo TaC parts with good surface morphology and formability are obtained with a laser power of 350-400 W and scanning speed of 300 mm/s [Fig. 2 ( a)]. Warping and interlayer cracking will occur with improper laser energy input [Fig. 2( b)]. With suitable laser energy input, the interaction of powders and laser can achieve complete melt spreading of tungsten-5% TaC. Compared with pure tungsten, the defect density of pores and mesoscopic cracks in the microstructure has been considerably reduced in tungsten-5% TaC system (Fig. 4). After adding TaC particles, the grains are refined and many small -angle interfaces are formed. Further, transgranular cracks and hot cracks are initiated (Fig. 5). According to XRD analysis, the tungsten carbide ( W2C) phase appears in the tungsten-5%TaC parts (Fig. 6). Submicron substructures with various morphologies are observed in the tungsten-5%TaC microstructure (Fig. 7). During the LPBF ultra -high-speed solidification process, the substructure is formed when the solidification is near the absolute stability limit. The tantalum element exists in the matrix and cell walls, and the W2C phase exists on most of the cell walls. The morphology of the W2 C phase may be closely related to the aggregation of tantalum and solidification conditions. These submicron scale substructure combined with good thermal conductivity and high strength of W2 C phase segregation at the interface can effectively improve the strength of the material. The meandering crack path at the cell boundary increases the resistance of cracking propagation to some extent. The solid solution of tantalum in the matrix can strengthen the matrix and improve the material' s intragranular and grain boundary strength. After adding TaC, the microhardness of the microstructure is increased from 400 HV of pure tungsten to 666 HV (Fig. 9). The refinement of grains can increase crack propagation resistance and alleviate the stress concentration during the LPBF process.Conclusions This study proposes a new method of strengthening the tungsten matrix and reducing cracks via in situ reaction by forming submicron scale substructure strengthening phases. By adjusting the appropriate laser process parameters, tungsten-5% TaC samples fabricated by the LPBF technique have achieved good formability and pores in the microstructure have considerably reduced. Neither lower energy input (pores and spheroidization) nor higher energy input (overheated phenomenon) can produce samples with good formability. In the range of appropriate laser parameters, the tungsten-5%TaC system cracks are considerably reduced compared to pure tungsten cracks, which are mainly achieved via alloy strengthening, substructure strengthening, and grain refinement. The microhardness of tungsten-5% TaC samples is increased by 50% compared with pure tungsten, and the intrinsic strength of the material is also improved. Meanwhile, various morphologies of substructures are observed in the microstructure of tungsten-5%TaC, and there exists W2C segregation in the cell walls. The evolution of substructures is mainly affected by melt flow, temperature gradient, and thermal history during LPBF solidification and cooling.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0258-7025			WOS:000686547900012

The expression levels of Mdogg1 at different developmental stages (egg, 1st-3rd instar larva, pupa and adult), in different tissues (hemocyte, muscle, gut, and fat body) of the 3rd instar larvae and in the 2nd instar larvae of M. domestica after different stresses [exposed to 2.5-100 mmol/L CdCl2 for 24 h, soaked in 0.1 g/L doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) solution for 30 min and then recovered for 6, 12 and 24 h, and exposed to 280-315 nm ultraviolet (UV) at the dose of 5 J/cm2 for 5-30 min, respectively] were detected by qRT-PCR. The expression of Mdogg1 in the 2nd instar larvae of M. domestica was knocked down by RNAi, and the changes in the malondialdehyde (MDA) content, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) content were determined. 【Results】 The full-length cDNA sequence of Mdogg1 (GenBank accession number: AYK27449.1) was obtained. It is 1 062 bp in length, encoding 353 amino acid residues, with the theoretical molecular weight of 41.08 kD and the isoelectric point of 9.02. The amino acid sequence of MdOGG1 includes a HhH (Helix-hairpin-Helix) motif and the conserved endonuclease III domain ENDO3c domain. The qRT-PCR results showed that Mdogg1 was highly expressed in the egg stage and the fat body of the 3rd instar larvae of M. domestica. When the 2nd instar larvae of M. domestica were exposed to 2.5-100 mmol/L CdCl2, the expression level of Mdogg1 increased first and then decreased, and the 8-oxoG content increased. The expression levels of Mdogg1 in the 2nd instar larvae soaked in 0.1 g/L of DOX solution for 30 min and then recovered for 12 and 24 h, and those exposed to UV for 30 min, were significantly up-regulated as compared to that in the untreated control. After knockdown of Mdogg1 in the 2nd instar larvae of M. domestica by RNAi, the ROS level, MDA content and 8-oxoG content in M. domestica larvae increased significantly as compared to the control (dsGFP injection group), while the SOD activity decreased significantly. 【Conclusion】 Mdogg1 is involved in maintaining redox balance in M. domestica, playing an important role in protecting the insect from oxidative damage.			【目的】本研究旨在克隆鉴定家蝇Musca domestica中8-羟基鸟嘌呤糖苷酶1(8-hydroxyguanine glycosylase 1, OGG1)编码基因Mdogg1,明确其是否参与家蝇氧化应激调控。【方法】根据家蝇转录组数据,利用RT-PCR克隆Mdogg1基因cDNA序列,并进行生物信息学分析;利用qRT-PCR检测Mdogg1在家蝇不同发育阶段(卵、1-3龄幼虫、蛹和成虫)的表达变化、3龄幼虫不同组织(血细胞、肌肉、肠道和脂肪体)中的表达分布以及不同胁迫处理[2.5~100 mmol/L CdCl2胁迫24 h, 0.1 g/L盐酸阿霉素(DOX)浸泡30 min并恢复培养6, 12和24 h,以及280-315 nm紫外线(UV)(强度5 J/cm2)处理5~30 min]后2龄幼虫中的转录水平变化;通过RNAi技术敲低家蝇2龄幼虫Mdogg1表达,并检测其丙二醛(malondialdehyde, MDA)含量、活性氧(reactive oxygen species, ROS)水平、超氧化物歧化酶(superoxide dismutase, SOD)活性和8-羟基鸟嘌呤(8-oxoguanine, 8-oxoG)含量的变化。【结果】Mdogg1(GenBank登录号: AYK27449.1) cDNA序列全长1 062 bp,编码353个氨基酸,该蛋白的理论分子量和等电点分别为41.08 kD和9.02。MdOGG1氨基酸序列中含有螺旋-发夹-螺旋(HhH)结构域,并包含核酸内切酶Ⅲ保守结构域ENDO3c。qRT-PCR结果显示,Mdogg1主要在家蝇卵和3龄幼虫脂肪体中呈高水平表达。2龄幼虫暴露于2.5~100 mmol/L CdCl2下,Mdogg1表达量呈现先上升再下降趋势,并伴有8-oxoG含量的持续升高。2龄幼虫浸泡于0.1 g/L DOX 30 min并恢复培养12和24 h以及UV照射30 min后,Mdogg1表达量较未处理对照均显著上调。利用RNAi技术敲低家蝇2龄幼虫体内Mdogg1的表达后,家蝇幼虫体内的ROS水平、MDA含量和8-oxoG含量较注射dsGFP的对照组显著增高,而SOD活性下降。【结论】Mdogg1参与家蝇氧化还原平衡的维持,具有保护机体抵抗氧化损伤的生物学效应。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0454-6296			CSCD:6917562

The 3D-type structured TNTs-Ti meshes evidenced: i) a mesoporosity due to the presence of highly ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays grown on the round surface of the regularly woven wires of the Ti gauze and ii) a macroporosity due to the open area (36%) of the mesh. The resulting hierarchical porous 3D structure allowed the TNTs-Ti meshes to act both as photoactive materials for efficient light absorption and as porous substrates for fast mass diffusion of protons. The synthesis of TNTs was investigated by varying the applied voltage (in the range 40-60 V) and the anodization time (from 20 min to 7 h). Results showed that two main opposite aspects influenced their performances in the PECa cell: i) the inner diameter and ii) the length of TNTs. While the increase of the inner diameter with the anodization time should favour H-2 productivity, longer nanotubes negatively influence the catalytic activity due to increasing charge recombination phenomena. The result is an initial decreasing profile of H-2 evolution vs. anodization time, reaching a minimum at 3 h and then increasing again for the 5 h-anodized sample (H-2 production rate: 1.4 L m-(2) h(-1)). The maximum photo conversion efficiency (0.7%) was obtained, instead, for the 20 min-anodized sample. It is to remark that tests of water splitting were performed with no applied bias and without adding sacrificial donors, opening the route for a sustainable use of these 3D-type meso/macro porous structured photoanodes in the production of solar fuels.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			0927-0248	1879-3398		WOS:000427337300013		
S	Harman, D						Park, SC; Hwang, ES; Kim, HS; Park, WY		Aging: Overview								HEALTHY AGING FOR FUNCTIONAL LONGEVITY: MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR INTERACTIONS IN SENESCENCE		ANNALS OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF SCIENCES		928				1	21		10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb05631.x				2001	2001	Aging is a universal process that began with the origination of life about 3.5 billion years ago. Accumulation of the diverse deleterious changes produced by aging throughout the cells and tissues progressively impairs function and can eventually cause death. Aging changes can be attributed to development, genetic defects, the environment, disease, and an inborn process-the aging process. The chance of death at a given age serves as a measure of the average number of aging changes accumulated by persons of that age, that is, of physiologic age, and the rate of change of this measure as the rate of aging. Chances for death are decreased by improvements in general living conditions. As a result, during the past two millennia average life expectancy at birth (ALE-B), determined by the chances for death, of humans has risen from 30 years, in ancient Rome, to almost 80 years today in the developed countries. Chances for death in the developed countries are now near limiting values and ALE-Bs are approaching plateau values that are 6-9 years less than the potential maximum of about 85 years. Chances for death are now largely determined by the inherent aging process after age 28. Only 1.1% of female cohorts in Sweden die before this age; the remainder die off at an exponentially increasing rate with advancing age. The inherent aging process limits ALE-B to around 85 years, and the maximum life span (MLS) to about 122 years. Past efforts to increase ALE-B did not require an understanding of aging. Such knowledge will be necessary in the future to significantly increase ALE-B and MLS, and to satisfactorily ameliorate the medical, economic, and social problems associated with advancing age. The many theories advanced to account for aging should be used, to the extent it is feasible, to help with these important practical problems, including applications of the free radical theory of aging. Past measures evolved by societies to ensure adequate care for older individuals are rapidly becoming inadequate because of changes in life style, the growing percentage of older people, declining fertility rates, and the diminishing size of the work forces to provide for the elderly. Measures are being advanced to help with this problem. Prospects are bright for further increases in the span of functional life and improvements in the lives of the elderly.

The nanocomposites were characterized, by XRD, FTIR, Raman Spectra, FE-SEM, HR-TEM, UV-vis, DRS Spectra, and PL Spectra. The optical band gap of rGO/CuFe2O4-TiO2 nanocomposite was found to be red shifted to 1.51 eV from 3.20 eV for pristine TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs). The photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared rGO/CuFe2O4-TiO2 nanocomposite was determined via photocatalytic water-splitting in the presence of glycerol as hole scavenger under UV-vis light irradiation. A peak hydrogen production rate of 35981 mu molg(-1) h(-1) was obtained, which is similar to 8 and 3 times higher than that of bare TiO2 (4640 mu molg(-1) h(-1)) and CuFe2O4-TiO2 photocatalysts (14719 mu molg(-1) h(-1)), respectively. This remarkable improvement in the photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the enhanced visible light absorption and efficient charge carrier separation at the interface of rGO/CuFe2O4-TiO2 nanocomposites. A significant quenching of photoluminescence intensity of the rGO/CuFe2O4-TiO2 nanocomposite further confirmed the effective separation and transportation of photogenerated charge carriers in the presence of rGO sheet. A double charge separation and transportation mechanism is proposed for the enhanced photocatalytic activity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Two hundred sixteen clinical VREfm isolates collected between 1997 and 2010 were studied by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, MLST, MLVA and detection of IS16, esp (Efm), pilA, intA and plasmid-specific genes by PCR. Tn1546 structure was revealed by overlapping PCR and sequencing. Selected isolates were subjected to PFGE-S1 and Southern hybridization analyses. The vast majority of the isolates (95.8 %) belonged to lineages 17/18 (during the whole study period 1997-2010) and 78 (mostly in 2006-2010) of hospital-adapted meroclone of E. faecium. All isolates displayed a multi-drug resistance phenotype. Twenty-eight Tn1546 types (including 26 novel ones) were associated with eight different ISs (IS1216, IS1251, ISEfa4, ISEfa5, ISEfm2, ISEf1, IS3-like, ISEfm1-like). The vanA-determinant was typically located on plasmids, which most commonly carried rep2(pRE25), rep17(pRUM), rep18(pEF418), rep1(pIP501), omega-epsilon-zeta and axe-txe genes. VanA isolates from 1997-2005 to 2006-2010 differed in clonal composition, prevalence of gentamicin- and tetracycline-resistance and plasmidome. Our analysis revealed high complexity of Tn1546-type transposons and vanA-plasmids, and suggested that diverse genetic events, such as conjugation transfer, recombination, chromosomal integration and DNA mutations shaped the structure of these elements among Polish VREfm.									28	0	0	0	22	0	28			0934-9723	1435-4373		WOS:000393049000014	27752789

First, a new lipophilic chelator, N,N,N',N'-tetrapropionato-1,3-bis(aminomethyl)benzene (TPDBA), has been used that permits complete extraction of both manganese and calcium and the three extrinsic WOC polypeptides while minimizing damage to the apo-PSII protein and, importantly, eliminating the need to use reductants. Second, an ultrasensitive, fast-response, polarographic cell and detection system were built. The apparatus features (a) an ultrabright red light-emitted diode (LED) for controlling the light intensity, pulse duration, and dark intervals, features critical for minimization of photoinhibition; (b) a microvolume (5 mu L) O-2 polarographic cell (Clark type) fitted with a thin silicone membrane for rapid response (100 ms); and (c) DC/AC preamplifier integrated into the microcell and interfaced to a bandpass AC amplifier. The sensitivity enables detection of similar to 5 x 10(-14) mol of O-2 per flash at a signal to noise = 5/1. These improvements permit 100-fold lower Mn concentrations to be explored. Under optimum conditions, complete recovery of O-2-evolving activity could be restored compared to that of PSII membranes depleted of the three extrinsic polypeptides (35% V-max vs intact PSII). Titration of the photoactivation steady-state O-2 yield, Y-ss, and the half-time for recovery, t(1/2), vs Mn concentration demonstrate that 4.0 Mn/P680 are cooperatively taken up at 95% restoration of Y-ss and that 1.1-1.2 Mn atoms are involved in the rate-limiting photolytic step under steady-state conditions. Due to minimization of photoihibition, this intermediate exhibits a single exponential recovery kinetic over the entire population of PSII centers. Mn atoms in excess of 4 Mn/P680 accelerate the rate of photoactivation but decrease the yield above 8-10 Mn/P680. Maxima in both Y-ss and t(1/2) are observed at similar electrochemical potentials of the medium, 380 and 340 mV, respectively. We attribute this maximum to either elimination of a recombination reaction between the redox-active tyrosine-161 of the D1 polypeptide (Y-z(+)) and an electron acceptor, possibly cytochrome b(559), or stabilization of an intermediate in photoactivation. At low Mn2+ concentrations, a new pre-steady-state kinetic intermediate which binds fewer than 4 Mn atoms can be directly observed. This early kinetic phase has a rate that depends on Mn concentration and is independent of the electron acceptor identity and concentration.									71	1	2	0	52	0	73			0006-2960			WOS:A1996UC97700030	8672445

For this purpose 12 dogs separated in two groups (A and B) of 6 clogs each were used. Both groups were subjected to the same anesthetic protocol. The protocol consisted in premedication with xilacine IM, induction with propofol IV and maintenance with inhalatory anesthesia for a period of two hours. The group B received also a ketamine infusion. Computed tomographic images were taken at 0, 60 and 120 minutes, with the purpose of monitoring developments of atelectasis. In 58% of the dogs it was possible to determine the presence of some degree of atelectasis. In these animals atelectasis was observed in all the cases, but only in one lung. Atelectasis was found in 5 animals in the group without infusion of ketamine and in 2 animals in the group with infusion. The collapsed lung zones ranged between 0.13 and 8.03 cm(2) in group A, and 0.07 and 2.10 cm(2) in group B.

However, the noble metals (NMs) comprise the least abundant elements in the lithosphere, making them prohibitively scarce and expensive for future global-scale technologies. As such, intense research efforts have been devoted to eliminating or substantially reducing the loadings of NMs in various catalytic applications. These efforts have resulted in a plethora of heterogeneous NM catalyst morphologies beyond the traditional supported spherical nanoparticle. In many of these new architectures, such as shaped, high index, and bimetallic particles, less than 20% of the loaded NMs are available to perform catalytic turnovers. The majority of NM atoms are subsurface, providing only a secondary catalytic role through geometric and ligand effects with the active surface NM atoms. A handful of architectures can approach 100% NM utilization, but severe drawbacks limit general applicability. For example, in addition to problems with stability and leaching, single atom and ultrasmall cluster catalysts have extreme metal support interactions, discretized d-bands, and a lack of adjacent NM surface sites. While monolayer thin films do not possess these features, they exhibit such low surface areas that they are not commercially relevant, serving predominantly as model catalysts.This Account champions core-shell nanoparticles (CS NPs) as a vehicle to design highly active, stable, and low-cost materials with high NM utilization for both thermo- and electrocatalysis. The unique benefits of the many emerging NM architectures could be preserved while their fundamental limitations could be overcome through reformulation via a core shell morphology. However, the commercial realization of CS NPs remains challenging, requiring concerted advances in theory and manufacturing. We begin by formulating seven constraints governing proper core material design, which naturally point to early transition metal ceramics as suitable core candidates. Two constraints prove extremely challenging. The first relates to the core modifying the shell work function and d-band. To properly investigate materials that could satisfy this constraint, we discuss our development of a new heat, quench, and exfoliation (HQE) density functional theory (DFT) technique to model heterometallic interfaces. This technique is used to predict how transition metal carbides can favorably tune the catalytic properties of various NM monolayer shell configurations. The second challenging constraint relates to the scalable manufacturing of CS NP architectures with independent synthetic control of the thickness and composition of the shell and the size and composition of the core. We discuss our development of a synthetic method that enables high temperature self-assembly of tunable CS NP configurations. Finally, we discuss how these principles and methods were used to design catalysts for a variety of applications. These include the design of a thermally stable sub-monolayer CS catalyst, a highly active methanol electrooxidation catalyst, CO-tolerant Pt catalysts, and a hydrogen evolution catalyst that is less expensive than state-of-the-art NM-free catalysts. Such core shell architectures offer the promise of ultralow precious metal loadings while ceramic cores hold the promise of thermodynamic stability and access to unique catalytic activity/tunability.									54	1	0	0	2	0	55			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000432418000008	29510023

Degree heating weeks, however, do not account for differential rates of heating. This study aimed to explore the relationship between different rates of heating above the documented regional winter threshold, and resultant bleaching of the reef-building coral Acropora formosa. Under a relatively low light field, rapid heating of 1 degrees C day(-1) from 29 degrees C to 32 degrees C lead to a 17.6% decline in F(v)/F(m), concurrent with a rapid increase in xanthophyll de-epoxidation sustained into the dark, whereas slower heating rates of 0.5 degrees C day(-1) lead to no decline in F(v)/F(m) and no change in dark-adapted xanthophyll cycling. At the winter bleaching threshold of 30 degrees C, areal net O(2) evolution exceeded the control values for rapidly heated corals, but was lower than the controls for slowly heated corals. At the maximum temperature of 33 degrees C, however, both treatments had net O(2) fluxes that were 50% of control values. At 30 degrees C, only symbiont densities in the slowly heated controls were reduced relative to controls values. By 33 degrees C, however, symbiont densities were 55% less than the controls in both treatments. The rate of heat accumulation was found to be an important variable, with rapidly heated corals attaining the same bleaching status and loss of areal O(2) production for half the degree heating week exposure as slowly heated corals. The study revealed that it is incorrect to assume that significant dark acclimation disables non-photochemical quenching, because 75% of an increased xanthophyll pool was found to be in the de-epoxidated state following rapid heat accumulation. This has important ramifications for the interpretation of chlorophyll fluorescence data such as dark adapted F(v)/F(m).									48	1	0	0	46	0	48			0022-0949			WOS:000275636500012	20228338	
J	Liu, Rui; Cheng, Qi; Song, Xiaorui; Wang, Hao; Wang, Xiudan; Wang, Lingling; Zhu, Beiwei; Song, Linsheng								A vital ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme CgUbe2g1 participated in regulation of immune response of Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas								DEVELOPMENTAL AND COMPARATIVE IMMUNOLOGY				91				132	142		10.1016/j.dci.2018.10.014				FEB 2019	2019	As an important post-translational protein modification, ubiquitination has been demonstrated to play vitalrole in immune response of vertebrates. Ubiquitin (Ub)-conjugating enzyme E2 is the "heart" of ubiquitination, which is responsible for Ub cellular signaling and substrate modification. In the present study, an Ub-conjugating enzyme E2 (designed as CgUbe2g1) was identified from oyster Crassostrea gigas, and its regulation in the immune response against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation was investigated. CgUbe2g1 encoded a polypeptide of 168 amino acids with the predicted molecular mass of 19.20 kDa and contained conserved catalytic 'Ube domains. It shared a higher similarity with the known UBC2G1 type E2s and was closely clustered with the type E2s identified from invertebrates in the phylogenetic assay. The mRNA transcripts of CgUbe2g1 were mainly distributed in hemocyte, mantle, hepatopancreas and male gonad of C. gigas. CgUbe2g1 protein was found to be colocalized with Ub around the nucleus of oyster hemocyte. The recombinant CgUbe2g1 protein (rCgUbe2g1) could activate the ubiquitination in vitro by binding both activated and un-activated Ub. The expressions of inflammation-related factors TNF-alpha and NF-kappa B in CgUbe2g1 transfected cells were both significantly up-regulated after LPS stimulation, which were 12.9-fold at 3h (p < 0.01) and 2.3-fold at 6h (p < 0.01) of that in negative control group, respectively. The phagocytic rate of hemocyte and the ROS level in hemocyte were both significantly decreased (p < 0.01), while the apoptosis rate was significantly increased (p < 0.01) after CgUbe2g1 mRNA was interfered. These results demonstrated that Ub-conjugating enzyme CgUbe2g1 was involved in the innate immune response of oyster against invading pathogen, which might play important roles in the activation of inflammatory response and regulation of cellular immune response.									6	0	0	0	3	0	6			0145-305X	1879-0089		WOS:000451492900015	30389518

The effect of the IL cation chemistry was determined by examining the behavior of a phosphonium IL (P111i4FSI) in comparison to its pyrrolidinium-based counterpart (C(3)mpyrFSI) at near-saturated NaFSI salt concentrations (superconcentrated ILs) in their dry state and with water additive. The differences in their physical properties are reported, with the P111i4FSI system having a lower viscosity, higher conductivity, and higher ionicity in comparison to the C(3)mpyrFSI-based electrolyte, although the addition of 1000 ppm (0.1 wt %) of water had a more dramatic effect on these properties in the latter case. Despite these differences, there was little effect in the ability to sustain stable cycling at moderate current densities and capacities (being nearly identical at 1 mA cm(-2) and 1 mAh cm(-2)). However, the IL based on the phosphonium cation is shown to support more demanding cycling with high stability (up to 4 mAh cm(-2) at 1, 2, and 4 mA cm(-2) current density), whereas C(3)mpyrFSI rapidly failed (at 1 mA cm(-2)/4 mAh cm(-2)). The SEI was characterized ex situ using solid-state Na-23 NMR, XPS, and SEM and showed that the presence of a Na complex, identified in our previous work on C(3)mpyrFSI to correlate with stable, dendrite-free Na metal cycling, was also more prominent and coexisted with a NaF-rich surface. The results here represent a significant breakthrough in the development of high-capacity Na metal anodes, clearly demonstrating the superior performance and stability of the P111i4FSI electrolyte, even after the addition of water (up to 1000 ppm (0.1 wt %)), and show great promise to enable future higher-temperature (50 degrees C) Na-metal-based batteries.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000800295400088	35315660

Eight additional presolar Al2O3 grains were found by high mass resolution ion probe measurements of all three stable O isotopes in individual grains, including several that would have been missed by the ion-imaging search. Forty-five of the grains were analyzed for their O-16/O-17 and O-16/O-18 ratios. Twenty-four grains were also analyzed for Al-Mg and 17 of them have large excesses of Mg-26, attributable to the radioactive decay of Al-26. The highly anomalous isotopic composition of the grains is evidence for their presolar, stellar origin.The 46 oxide grains of this study together with 42 previously identified presolar grains were divided into four groups. These groups most likely comprise grains from distinct types of stellar sources. Group 1 grains have O-17 excesses and moderate O-18 depletions, relative to solar, and many of them exhibit Mg-26 excesses as well. Group 2 grains have O-17 excesses, large O-18 depletions, and high inferred Al-26/Al-27 ratios. Group 3 grains have solar or higher O-16/O-17 and O-16/O-18 ratios. Group 4 grains have O-17 and O-18 enrichments. One Al2O3 grain of this study, T54, has an O-16/O-17 ratio of 71, lower than any previously observed, and O-16/O-18 much greater than the solar value.The O-isotopic compositions of Group 1 and Group 3 grains are consistent with an origin in O-rich red giant stars, which have undergone the first dredge-up. The range of O-isotopic ratios of these groups requires multiple stellar. sources of different masses and initial isotopic compositions and is well explained by a combination of Galactic chemical evolution and first dredge-up models. The inferred Al-26/Al-27 ratios of many of these grains indicate that they formed in thermally pulsing asymptotic branch (TP-AGB) stars that had undergone the third dredge-up. Group 2 grains probably formed in low-mass AGE stars as well, and their substantial O-18 depletions are the likely result of ''extra'' mixing (cool bottom processing). The origin of the O-18 enrichments in Group 4 grains is unknown, but it might be due to initial compositional differences of the stellar sources or to unusual third dredge-up in low-mass AGE stars. The highly O-17-enriched grain T54 could have formed in an AGE star undergoing hot bottom burning or in a massive star in the Of-WN phase.O-rich circumstellar dust seems to be underrepresented in meteorites, relative to C-rich. Explanations include the possibility that most O-rich stardust grains are silicates and have been destroyed either in the laboratory or in nature and the possibility that presolar Al2O3 has a finer grain size distribution than SiC and graphite.									325	2	0	0	5	0	327			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:A1997XJ16700045		
J	Dong, Huizhen; Chen, Qiming; Dai, Yuqin; Hu, Wenjie; Zhang, Shaoling; Huang, Xiaosan								Genome-wide identification of PbrbHLH family genes, and expression analysis in response to drought and cold stresses in pear (Pyrus bretschneideri)								BMC PLANT BIOLOGY				21	1					86	10.1186/s12870-021-02862-5				FEB 9 2021	2021	Background The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors play important roles in many processes in plant growth, metabolism and responses to abiotic stresses. Although, the sequence of Chinese white pear genome (cv. 'Dangshansuli') has already been reported, there is still a lack of clarity regarding the bHLH family genes and their evolutionary history. Results In this work, a genome-wide identification of the bHLH genes in Chinese white pear was performed, and we characterized the functional roles of these PbrbHLH genes in response to abiotic stresses. Based on the phylogenetic analysis and structural characteristics, 197 identified bHLH genes could be well classified into 21 groups. Expansion of PbrbHLH gene family was mainly driven by WGD and dispersed duplication with the purifying selection from the recent WGD. The functional annotation enrichment showed that the majority of PbrbHLHs were enriched in the GO terms and KEGG pathways involved in responds to stress conditions as TFs. Transcriptomic profiles and qRT-PCR revealed that PbrbHLH7, PbrbHLH8, PbrbHLH128, PbrbHLH160, PbrbHLH161 and PbrbHLH195 were significantly up-regulated under cold and drought treatments. In addition, PbrbHLH195-silenced pear seedlings display significant reduced cold tolerance, exhibiting reduced chlorophyll content, as well as increased electrolyte leakage and concentrations of malondialdehyde and H2O2. Conclusion For the first time, a comprehensive analysis identified the bHLH genes in Chinese white pear and demonstrated that PbrbHLH195 is involved in the production of ROS in response to cold stress, suggesting that members of the PbrbHLH family play an essential role in the stress tolerance of pear.									17	2	0	0	10	0	19			1471-2229			WOS:000617717100002	33563216	
J	Ruan, KC; Xu, CH; Yu, Y; Li, J; Lange, R; Bec, N; Balny, C					bec, nicole/0000-0001-7608-2434			Pressure-exploration of the 33-kDa protein from the spinach photosystem II particle								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY				268	9			2742	2750		10.1046/j.1432-1327.2001.02171.x				MAY 2001	2001	The 33-kDa protein isolated from the spinach photosystem II particle is an ideal model to explore high-pressure protein-unfolding. The protein has a very low free energy as previously reported by chemical unfolding studies, suggesting that it must be easy to modulate its unfolding transition by rather mild pressure. Moreover, the protein molecule consists of only one tryptophan residue (Trp241) and eight tyrosine residues, which can be conveniently used to probe the protein conformation and structural changes under pressure using either fluorescence spectroscopy or fourth derivative UV absorbance spectroscopy. The different experimental methods used in the present study indicate that at 20 degreesC and pH 6, the 33-kDa protein shows a reversible two-state unfolding transition from atmospheric pressure to about 180 MPa. This value is much lower than those found for the unfolding of most proteins studied so far. The unfolding transition induces a large red shift of the maximum fluorescence emission of 34 nm (from 316 nm to 350 nm). The change in standard free energy (DeltaG(o)) and in volume (DeltaV) for the transition at pH 6.0 and 20 degreesC are -14.6 kJ.mol(-1) and -120 mL.mol(-1), respectively, in which the DeltaG(o) value is consistent with that obtained by chemical denaturation. We found that pressure-induced protein unfolding is promoted by elevated temperatures, which seem largely attributed to the decrease in the absolute value of DeltaG(o) (only a minor variation was observed for the DeltaV value). However, the promotion of the unfolding by alkaline pH seems mainly related to the increase in DeltaV without any significant changes in DeltaG(o). It was also found that NaCl significantly protects the protein from pressure-induced unfolding. In the presence of 1 m NaCl, the pressure needed to induce the half-unfold of the protein is shifted to a higher value (shift of 75 MPa) in comparison with that observed without NaCl. Interestingly, in the presence of NaCl, the value of DeltaV is significantly reduced whilst that of DeltaG(o) remains as before. The unfolding-refolding kinetics of the protein has also been studied by pressure-jump, in which it was revealed that both reactions are a two-state transition process with a relatively slow relaxation time of about 10(2) s.									38	4	1	0	31	1	42			0014-2956			WOS:000168560100026	11322896	
J	Bertamini, M; Nedunchezhian, N								Photoinhibition and recovery of photosynthesis in leaves of Vitis berlandieri and Vitis rupestris								JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY				161	2			203	210		10.1078/0176-1617-00838				FEB 2004	2004	Photoinhibition of photosynthesis was studied in Vitis berlandieri and Vitis rupestris leaves under controlled conditions (irradiation of detached leaves to about 1900 mumol m(-2) s(-1)). The degree of photoinhibition was determined by means of the ratio of variable to maximum chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence (Fv/Fm) and electron transport measurements. The potential efficiency of PS2, Fv/Fm declined, Fo increased significantly in leaves of V berlandieri, while Fo decreased in V rupestris. In isolated thylakoids, the rate of whole chain and PS2 activity markedly decreased in high light irradiated more in leaves of V berlandieri than in leaves of V rupestris. A smaller inhibition of PS1 activity was also observed in both leaves, In the subsequent dark incubation, fast recovery was observed in both leaves and reached maximum PS2 efficiencies similar to those observed in non-photoinhibited leaves. The artificial exogenous electron donors DPC, NH2OH and Mn2+ failed to restore the high light induced loss of PS2 activity in V berlandieri leaves, while DPC and NH2OH significantly restored in V rupestris leaves. It is concluded that high light inactivates on the donor side of PS2 and acceptor side of PS2 in V rupestris and V berlandieri leaves, respectively. Quantification of the PS2 reaction center protein D1 and 33 kDa protein of water splitting complex following high light exposure of leaves showed pronounced differences between V berlandieri and V rupestris leaves. The marked loss of PS2 activity in high light irradiated leaves was due to the marked loss of D1 protein and 33 kDa protein in V berlandieri and V rupestris leaves, respectively.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0176-1617	1618-1328		WOS:000189264300009	15022835

This has allowed the distinction of different sources of sulphate and their relative importance in different parts of the aquifer. The principal sources are S-34-depleted inputs, derived from the oxidation of pyrite within both the aquifer matrix material and the overlying mudstone deposits, and S-34-enriched anthropogenic inputs which are derived from acid rain fallout augmented by agrochemicals.Groundwaters sampled over the outcrop zone of the aquifer have sulphate delta(34)S dominated by contemporary acid rain inputs in the recharge waters. A down-dip decrease in the S-34 content of groundwater sulphate over the unconfined and shallow confined areas of the aquifer is indicative of a progressive increase in the significance of pyrite-derived sulphate in the system. The contribution of sulphate from this source is large and indicates that pollution front penetration (previously based on total sulphate concentrations) is more restricted than previously thought. Moreover, the extent of pyrite oxidation is greater than can be accounted for by dissolved O-2 and the additional component corresponds to that which would be expected from reduction of nitrate using pyrite as the electron donor. We suggest that this mechanism is responsible for denitrification in the aquifer, but that it will be ultimately limited by pyrite availability near fissure surfaces where the reaction takes place.

(H2O)-O-18 Was rapidly injected into spinach thylakoid samples preset in either the S-0, S-1, S-2, or S-3 states, and the rate of O-18 incorporation into the O-2 produced was determined by time-resolved mass spectrometry. For measurements at mle = 34 (i.e., for the (OO)-O-16-O-18 product), the rate of O-18 incorporation in all S states shows biphasic kinetics, reflecting the binding of the two substrate water molecules to the catalytic site. The slow phase kinetics yield rate constants at 10 degrees C of 8 +/- 2, 0.021 +/- 0.002, 2.2 +/- 0.3, and 1.9 +/- 0.2 s(-1) for the S-0, S-1, S-2, and S-3 states, respectively, while the fast phase kinetics yield a rate constant of 36.8 +/- 1.9 s(-1) for the S3 State but remain unresolvable (>100 s(-1)) for the S-0, S-1, and S-2 states. Comparisons of the O-18 exchange rates reveal that the binding affinity for one of the substrate water molecules first increases during the S-0 to S-1 transition, then decreases during the S-1 to S-2 transition, but stays the same during the S-2 to S-3 transition, while the binding affinity for the second substrate water molecule undergoes at least a 5-fold increase on the S-2 to S-3 transition. These findings are discussed in terms of two independent Mn-III substrate binding sites within the O-2 evolving complex which are separate from the component that accumulates the oxidizing equivalents. One of the Mn-III sites may only first bind a substrate water molecule during the S-2 to S-3 transition.									94	1	0	0	61	0	95			0006-2960			WOS:000086484200023	10757989

We fabricated modified graphitic carbon nitride polymer samples by copolymerization of melamine with 2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine and 1,3,5-triaminobenzene, containing few-carbon (pyrimidine) to all-carbon (benzene) aromatic rings. Solid state C-13 NMR shows that the core molecular skeleton of g-C3N4 remained intact even after the incorporation of benzene and pyrimidine aromatic rings into the g-C3N4 chemical structure. Upon substitution of benzene aromatic rings in the place of triazine rings, the optical band gap energy of g-C3N4 is reduced down from 2.8 eV to 2.1 eV with negative shifts of valence and conduction bands due to the formation of defects like nitrogen vacancies. DFT calculations predict that the benzene doped carbon nitride polymer has localized charge densities over valence band maxima and conduction band minima in different parts of heptazine rings, which assist in reducing the recombination rate of the charge carriers. The benzene ring incorporated carbon nitride photoelectrode shows higher photocurrent with less charge transfer resistance than the parent g-C3N4 and pyrimidine doped g-C3N4 polymers. This demonstrates the importance of the extended conjugation in g-C3N (4) due to the presence of aromatic benzene rings. This is further corroborated by photoluminescence and electron paramagnetic resonance measurements. As a result, the benzene ring incorporated carbon nitride is more active than the pyrimidine ring incorporated carbon nitride for solar water splitting. The benzene ring incorporated carbon nitride polymer directly splits water and generates about 7 mu mol h(-1) of hydrogen with an apparent quantum yield of 1.6% at 450 nm in the absence of sacrificial reagents, achieving a turnover number of 1.6.									81	6	0	0	8	0	80			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000459331600028

Mature MPOs act as potent antimicrobial agents by producing hypohalous acids using hydrogen peroxide and halide ions as substrates. These acids can readily oxidize reactive groups of biomolecules on invading microbes. In this study, we identified and characterized a homolog of MPO from rock bream (Oplegnathus fasciatus), designated as RbMPO. We analyzed the RbMPO gene for its basal expression level in physiologically important tissues and for transcriptional changes under different pathogenic stress conditions. The complete coding sequence of RbMPO consisted of 2652 nucleotides encoding an 884 amino acid sequence with a predicted molecular mass of 99.7 kDa. Our in silico analysis confirmed the typical MPO domain arrangement in RbMPO, including the propeptide, large chain and heavy chain, along with the heme peroxidase signature. Intriguingly, a C1q domain was also identified in the C-terminal region of the derived amino acid sequence. Most of the known functionally important residues of MPOs are found to be well conserved in RbMPO, showing a close evolutionary relationship with other teleostan MPOs, particularly with that of mandarin fish. RbMPO exhibited a ubiquitous basal expression in physiologically relevant tissues, with particularly high expression levels in blood cells. Basal transcript levels of RbMPO in gill and spleen tissues were found to change upon different pathogen or pathogen-derived mitogen stimulation, with detectable inductive responses. Together, these data suggest the potential involvement of RbMPO in the innate immune response in rock bream. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Croat, TK; Stadermann, FJ; Bernatowicz, TJ								Presolar graphite from AGB stars: Microstructure and s-process enrichment								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				631	2			976	987		10.1086/432598				OCT 1 2005	2005	Correlated transmission electron microscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry with submicron spatial resolution (NanoSIMS) investigations of the same presolar graphites spherules from the Murchison meteorite were conducted, to link the isotopic anomalies with the mineralogy and chemical composition of the graphite and its internal grains. Refractory carbide grains ( especially titanium carbide) are commonly found within the graphite spherules, and most have significant concentrations of Zr, Mo, and Ru in solid solution, elements primarily produced by s-process nucleosynthesis. The effect of chemical fractionation on the Mo/Ti ratio in these carbides is limited, and therefore from this ratio one can infer the degree of s-process enrichment in the gas from which the graphite condensed. The resulting s-process enrichments within carbides are large (similar to 200 times solar on average), showing that most of the carbide-containing graphites formed in the mass outflows of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. NanoSIMS measurements of these graphites also show isotopically light carbon (mostly in the 100 <(12)C/(13)C < 400 range). The enrichment of these presolar graphites in both s-process elements and (12)C considerably exceeds that astronomically observed around carbon stars. However, a natural correlation exists between (12)C and s-process elements, as both form in the He intershell region of thermally pulsing AGB stars and are dredged up together to the surface. Their observation together suggests that these graphites may have formed in chemically and isotopically inhomogeneous regions around AGB stars, such as high-density knots or jets. As shown in the companion paper, a gas density exceeding that expected for smooth mass outflows is required for graphite of the observed size to condense at all in circumstellar environments, and the spatially inhomogeneous, high-density regions from which they condense may also be incompletely mixed with the surrounding gas. We have greatly expanded the available data set of presolar graphites (N = 847) and characterized them by their morphology ( onion type and cauliflower type). This effort has also revealed two new, rare presolar phases (iron carbide and metallic osmium). Due to the peculiar gas composition needed to form these rare presolar grain types, the graphites containing them are more likely to originate in supernova outflows.									84	0	0	0	0	0	84			0004-637X			WOS:000232365300024

For efficient utilization of solar energy, photocatalytic materials have attracted extensive attention over the last decades. As zero-dimensional carbon nanomaterials, fullerenes (C-60, C-70, etc.) have been extensively investigated for photocatalytic applications. Due to their unique properties, fullerenes can be used with other semiconductors as photocatalyst enhancers, and also as novel photocatalysts after being dispersed on non-semiconductors. This review summarizes fullerene-based materials (including fullerene/semiconductors and fullerene/non-semiconductors) for photocatalytic applications, such as water splitting, Cr (VI) reduction, pollutant degradation and bacterial disinfection. Firstly, the optical and electronic properties of fullerene are presented. Then, recent advances in the synthesis and photocatalytic mechanisms of fullerene-based photocatalysts are summarized. Furthermore, the effective performances of fullerene-based photocatalysts are discussed, mainly concerning photocatalytic H(2)generation and pollutant removal. Finally, the current challenges and prospects of fullerene-based photocatalysts are proposed. It is expected that this review could bring a better understanding of fullerene-based photocatalysts for water treatment and environmental protection.									9	1	0	0	2	0	9				1996-1944		WOS:000555022100001	32629789

A closely related parameter, the maximum quantum yield for stable charge separation of PSII, (phi (PSII))(m), can be estimated by measuring the increase in fluorescence yield from dark-adapted minimal fluorescence (F-o) to maximal fluorescence (F-m) associated with the closing of photosynthetic reaction centers with saturating light or with a photosynthetic inhibitor such as 3 '-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1 ' ,1 ' -dimethyl urea (DCMU). The ratio F-v/F-m (= (F-m - F-o)/F-m) is thus used as a diagnostic of nutrient stress. Published results indicate that F-v/F-m is depressed for nutrient-stressed phytoplankton, both during nutrient starvation (unbalanced growth) and acclimated nutrient limitation (steady-state or balanced growth). In contrast to published results, fluorescence measurements from our laboratory indicate that F-v/F-m is high and insensitive to nutrient limitation for cultures in steady state under a wide range of relative growth rates and irradiance levels. This discrepancy between results could be attributed to differences in measurement systems or to differences in growth conditions. To resolve the uncertainty about F-v/F-m as a diagnostic of nutrient stress, we grew the neritic diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana (Hustedt) Hasle et Heimdal under nutrient-replete and nutrient-stressed conditions, using replicate semicontinuous, batch, and continuous cultures. Fv/Fm was determined using a conventional fluorometer and DCMU and with a pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometer. Reduction of excitation irradiance in the conventional fluorometer eliminated overestimation of F-o in the DCMU methodology for cultures grown at lower light levels, and for a large range of growth conditions there was a strong correlation between the measurements of F-v/F-m with DCMU and PAM (r(2) = 0.77, n = 460). Consistent with the literature, nutrient-replete cultures showed consistently high F-v/F-m (similar to0.65), independent of growth irradiance. Under nutrient-starved (batch culture and perturbed steady state) conditions, F-v/F-m was significantly correlated to time without the limiting nutrient and to nutrient-limited growth rate before starvation. In contrast to published results, our continuous culture experiments showed that F-v/F-m was not a good measure of nutrient limitation under balanced growth conditions and remained constant (similar to0.65) and independent of nutrient-limited growth rate under different irradiance levels. Because variable fluorescence can only be used as a diagnostic for nutrient-starved unbalanced growth conditions, a robust measure of nutrient stressed oceanic waters is still required.									376	19	2	0	341	4	399			0022-3646	1529-8817		WOS:000170690400010

The high consumption of fossil fuels every year causes the energy crisis to become increasingly serious. Finding a sustainable and pollution-free energy source is therefore essential. Among all forms of energy sources, solar energy is preferred because of its cleanliness and inexhaustible availability. The energy provided by one year of sunlight is more than 100 times the total energy in known fossil fuel reserves worldwide; however, the extent of solar energy currently used by mankind each year is minute; thus developments in solar energy are imperative. To address the urgent need for a renewable energy supply and to solve environmental problems, a variety of technologies in the field of photocatalysis have been developed. Photocatalytic technology has attracted significant attention because of its superior ability to convert clean solar energy into chemical fuels. Among the photocatalytic materials emerging in an endless stream, perovskite oxide, with the general formula of ABO(3), has great potential in the fields of solar cells and photocatalysis as each site can be replaced by a variety of cations. Furthermore, owing to its unique properties such as high activity, robust stability, and facile structure adjustment, perovskite oxide photocatalysts have been widely used in water decomposition, carbon dioxide reduction and conversion, and nitrogen fixation. In terms of carbon dioxide reduction, oxide perovskites can achieve precise band gap and band edge tuning owing to its long charge diffusion length and flexibility in composition. For the development and utilization of solar energy in the environmental field, perovskite oxide and its derivatives (layered perovskite oxide) are used as photocatalysts for water decomposition and environmental remediation. In terms of nitrogen fixation, the conventional Haber-Bosh process for ammonia synthesis, which has been widely used in the past, requires high temperature and high energy. Therefore, we summarize the recent advances in perovskite oxide photocatalysts for nitrogen fixation from the aspect of activating the adsorbed N-2 by weakening the N N triple bond, promoting charge separation, and accelerating the charge transfer to the active sites to realize the photochemical reaction. Overall, this review article presents the structure and synthesis of perovskite oxide photocatalysis, focusing on the application of photocatalysis in water splitting, carbon dioxide reduction, and nitrogen fixation. This review concludes by presenting the current challenges and future prospects of perovskite oxide photocatalysts.									33	8	0	0	1	0	34			1000-6818			WOS:000614248900012

Herein, a gas diffusion strategy, along with one-step thermal activation, for fabricating N-doped porous carbon polyhedrons with trace isolated Fe atoms (Fe1NC) is developed. The optimized Fe1NC/S-1-1000 with atomic Fe-N-3 sites supported by N-doped graphitic carbons exhibits superior CO2ER performance with the CO Faradaic efficiency up to 96% at -0.5 V, turnover frequency of 2225 h(-1), and outstanding stability, outperforming almost all previously reported SACs based on N-doped carbon supported nonprecious metals. The observed excellent CO2ER performance is attributed to the greatly enhanced accessibility and intrinsic activity of active centers due to the increased electrochemical surface area through size modulation and the redistribution of doped N species by thermal activation. Experimental observations and theoretical calculations reveal that the Fe-N-3 sites possess balanced adsorption energies of *COOH and *CO intermediates, facilitating CO formation. A universal gas diffusion strategy is used to exclusively yield a series of dimension-controlled carbon-supported SACs with single Fe atoms while a rechargeable Zn-CO2 battery with Fe1NC/S-1-1000 as cathode is developed to deliver a maximal power density of 0.6 mW cm(-2).									91	11	0	0	5	0	90			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000553515000027	32538500

To meet the practical application requirements, photocatalysts should possess enhanced efficiency and be of low cost. Here, a novel Z-scheme ternary ZnTiO3/Zn2Ti3O8/ZnO heterojunction has been prepared by a solvothermal-calcination process. The phase transformation process of the sample can be defined as two processes, dehydration and thermal decomposition (ZnTiO3 Zn2Ti3O8 + ZnO). The ZnTiO3/Zn2Ti3O8/ZnO heterojunction produced in this facile phase transformation strategy displayed highly efficient photocatalytic performance in water splitting for hydrogen production and pollutant removal, e.g. phenol, dye, and heavy metal Cr(vi). On the basis of the PL spectra, photocurrent response, radical trapping experiments and ESR tests, we found that a nontraditional transport of photoinduced carriers created by a single Z-scheme mechanism played a significant role in the efficient removing of target pollutants and hydrogen generation. This work provides a facile phase transformation approach to construct a Z-scheme semiconductor heterostructure system with high efficiency for hydrogen production and water pollution treatment.									45	5	0	0	7	0	46			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000467776400018	30946417

Bicarbonate, formate, and acetate anions added to the sample under these conditions differently influence the maintenance of photochemical activity: a 50% loss of photochemical activity occurs in 11.5 min of heating in the presence of bicarbonate and in 4 and 4.6 min in the presence of formate and acetate, respectively. The addition of bicarbonate completely prevents aggregation of the D1 and D2 proteins as opposed to formate and acetate (their presence has no effect on the aggregation during thermoinactivation). Since the isolated RCs have neither inorganic Mn/Ca-containing core of the water-oxidizing complex nor nonheme Fe2+, it is supposed that bicarbonate specifically interacts with the hydrophilic domains of the D1 and D2 proteins, which prevents their structural modification that is a signal for aggregation of these proteins and the loss of photochemical activity.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0006-2979	0320-9725		WOS:000300879500008	22348477

Fabrication of photoelectrode is one of the major challenges to make PEC water splitting more effective and efficiently sustainable. In this article, we have focussed on the studies of antimony (Sb)-incorporated ZnO photoelectrodes and their evident effects in boosting the PEC water splitting activities using different concentrations of Sb incorporated on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) via aerosol-assisted chemical vapour deposition method (AACVD). The as-deposited photoelectrodes were characterized by using different techniques and were applied for the water splitting. The incorporated thin films exhibited better light absorbance in the visible range, probably because of the generation of extra energy levels through metal incorporation. An enhanced PEC water splitting performance was observed by Sb-incorporated ZnO photoelectrodes as compared to pure ZnO. More specifically, 15% Sb-incorporated ZnO attained a photocurrent density of 0.99 mA cm(-2) at 0.85 V vs. Ag/AgCl and maximum photo-stability that is quite greater as compared to pure ZnO (0.19 mA cm(-2)). This improvement was stated by the reduced bandgap and multifaceted morphological aspects of Sb-incorporated ZnO. In the production of simple and low-cost synthetic methods and effective electrode materials for PEC water splitting applications, these results are proved to be very helpful.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0250-4707	0973-7669		WOS:000770772100001

Significant concerns about its persistence and potential toxicity has been paid to in the aquatic environment. In this study, we explored UV and UV/persulfate (UV/PS) advanced oxidation process as potential options to remove PCMX for the first time. A steadystate kinetic model was established to simulate the experimental results and to predict the concentration of reactive oxidant species (ROS) under different reaction conditions. The second-order rate constants for PCMX reacting with SO4-center dot and HO center dot were determined to be (1.75 +/- 0.04) x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) and (2.74 +/- 0.14) x 10(9) M-1 s(-1), respectively, with SO4-center dot as the dominant species in PCMX decay by UV/PS. Interestingly, the pseudo-first-order rate constant of PCMX changed slightly in a broad pH range of 3.0 - 11.0, but was significantly increased when pH > 14.0. Natural organic matter (up to 5 mg/L as C) hindered the degradation rate of PCMX from 3.85 x 10(-4) s(-1) to 1.43 x 10(-4) s(-1) due to the effects of radical scavenging and the "inner filter" effect. Furthermore, the potential reactive sites (i.e., certain carbons in the benzene ring and phenolic hydroxyl group), in PCMX were identified based on the electronic structure of the molecule, using frontier molecular orbital theory, natural population analysis (NPA), and density functional theory (DFT) calculation. A variety of byproducts were identified using HPLC/MS/MS, which, in combination with the reactive site analysis, led to six main degradation pathways. Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) method of Toxicity Estimation Software Tool was applied to estimate the developmental toxicity of the byproducts.									20	3	0	0	13	0	23			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000522640100108

Here, authors study LaTiOxNy films by surface-sensitive techniques before and after photoelectrochemical water splitting.LaTiOxNy oxynitride thin films are employed to study the surface modifications at the solid-liquid interface that occur during photoelectrocatalytic water splitting. Neutron reflectometry and grazing incidence x-ray absorption spectroscopy were utilised to distinguish between the surface and bulk signals, with a surface sensitivity of 3 nm. Here we show, contrary to what is typically assumed, that the A cations are active sites that undergo oxidation at the surface as a consequence of the water splitting process. Whereas, the B cations undergo local disordering with the valence state remaining unchanged. This surface modification reduces the overall water splitting efficiency, but is suppressed when the oxynitride thin films are decorated with a co-catalyst. With this example we present the possibilities of surface sensitive studies using techniques capable of operando measurements in water, opening up new opportunities for applications to other materials and for surface sensitive, operando studies of the water splitting process.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2041-1723			WOS:000526532500006	32265498	
J	Chalokwu, CI								Petrology of the Freetown Layered Complex, Sierra Leone: Part II. Magma evolution and crystallisation conditions								JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES				32	3			519	540		10.1016/S0899-5362(01)90112-5				APR 2001	2001	The Freetown Layered Complex, Sierra Leone, is a 65 km long, 14 km wide and 7 km thick tholeiitic intrusion, which had been intruded in the West African Craton during the Jurassic (similar to 190 Ma) opening of the middle Atlantic Ocean. The complex consists of four zones of rhythmically layered sequences of Pl + Ol + Aug +/- Tmt-Ol + Opx + Pgt + Ol-Pgt. Cumulus inverted pigeonite first appeared at the bottom of Zone 2 before disappearing in the middle of Zone 3 only to reappear at the top of Zone 4 with cumulus titanomagnetite. Calculated emplacement pressures, based on the compositions of coexisting plagioclase-pyroxene and the CaTs reaction, range from 2.8 to 5.1 kbar. Two-pyroxene geothermometer gives crystallisation temperatures of 972-1305 +/- 70 degreesC, which compare favourably with temperatures estimated from O isotope thermometers (1040-1290 +/- 60 degreesC) and plagioclase-liquid thermometers (1045-1381 degreesC) applied to the Freetown bulk composition and obtained by geochemical summation for each zone. Fe-Ti oxides have all re-equilibrated during subsolidus cooling of the complex, but yield fO(2) between quartz-fayalite-magnetite and wustite-magnetite buffers at high pressure. Silica activity, based on the En = Fo + SiO2 equilibrium, has been calculated for the entire stratigraphic section. Instead of a progressive increase from the bottom to the top of the complex, values of silica activity fluctuate within the zones, with major decreases corresponding to levels of new magma additions or the arrival of cumulus titanomagnetite. Stratigraphic summation of whole rock chemical composition of cumulates for zones 2-4, weighted according to the average density of the zones, indicates the zones were produced by multiple injection of high alumina (18.38-20.47 wt%) low Ti (0.46-0.70 wt%) hypersthene-normative tholeiites with moderately high activities of silica. Numerical simulation using the COMAGMAT computer algorithm indicates zone 4 bulk composition, interpreted as approximating the parental magma, has the crystallisation sequence Pl(1277 degreesC)--> Ol(1245 degreesC) --> Opx(1224 degreesC) --> Cpx + Mt(1182 degreesC). Contemporary fine-grained diabase dykes cutting the complex evidently are not suitable parental magma candidates for the Freetown Complex. The dykes, which are thought to represent evolved liquids expelled from the roof zone of the chamber in response to compositional convection, are not saturated in olivine; their compositions (Mg ratio = 38-42) crystallised Mt and Opx before Pf at 1 kbar pressure and fO(2) corresponding to the quartz-fayalite-magnetite buffer.

Edmunds, Peter/0000-0002-9039-9347			Physiological ecology of the clonal corallimorpharian Corynactis californica								MARINE BIOLOGY				150	5			783	796		10.1007/s00227-006-0406-1				FEB 2007	2007	For clonal taxa, the reduced genetic variability associated with clonal proliferation is hypothesized to reduce the ability to respond to variable conditions, unless a general-purpose genotype (GPG) confers success in multiple environments. In this study, Corynactis californica (Carlgren 1936) from the subtidal of California was used as a model system to test the hypothesis that clones dampen fluctuations in fitness through a GPG that facilitates phenotypic plasticity. To achieve this goal, tissue composition, respiration, excretion, and growth were compared among clones of C. californica at one site, and a reciprocal transplant experiment was used to test the response of clones to differing conditions at two sites. All experiments were completed at Santa Catalina Island (N 33 degrees 25', W 118 degrees 30') between April and September 1991. Clones at a single site differed significantly in multiple traits, varying as much as 1.6-fold in protein content, 3.4-fold in respiration, and 3.5-fold in excretion. Interestingly, while tissue growth was the most labile trait (differing up to 35.4-fold among clones), polyp fission rates were not significantly different among clones, in part because fission continued even though tissue growth was unable to restore polyp size in between divisions. Partial energy budgets revealed that the majority (47-90%) of the daily energy expenditure was accounted for by respiration, 13-47% by growth, and 0.3-14% by excretion. In the transplant experiment, reaction norms revealed strong effects of the environment on some traits but not others, notably with growth differing between sites in a pattern that differed among clones, and excretion differing between sites; neither respiration nor fission were affected by transplantation. Partial energy budgets revealed that the energy allocation to respiration varied between sites in a pattern that differed among clones, and a similar trend was evident for tissue growth. Together, these results demonstrate that clones of C. californica have markedly different phenotypes and exploit phenotypic plasticity to maintain relatively constant fission rates, even though tissue growth varies greatly among clones and between environments. While these findings support the GPG hypothesis for clones of C. californica-at least based on relative fitness achieved through asexual proliferation-this conclusion depends on the extent to which polyps are successful when they have low rates of tissue growth.									7	0	0	0	7	0	7			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000243658500005

The 2D-hBN nanosheets are electrically wired via a drop-casting modification process onto a range of commercially available carbon supporting electrodes, including glassy carbon (GC), boron-doped diamond (BDD), and screen-printed graphitic electrodes (SPEs). 2D-hBN has not previously been explored toward the electrochemical detection/electrochemical sensing, of DA. We critically evaluate the potential electrocatalytic performance of 2D-hBN modified electrodes, the effect of supporting carbon electrode platforms, and the effect of "mass coverage" (which is commonly neglected in the 2D material literature) toward the detection of DA. The response of 2D-hBN modified electrodes is found to be largely dependent upon the interaction between 2D-hBN and the underlying supporting electrode material. For example, in the case of SPEs, modification with 2D-hBN (324 ng) improves the electrochemical response, decreasing the electrochemical oxidation potential of DA by similar to 90 mV compared to an unmodified SPE. Conversely, modification of a GC electrode with 2D-hBN (324 ng) resulted in an increased oxidation potential of DA by similar to 80 mV when compared to the unmodified electrode. We explore the underlying mechanisms of the aforementioned examples and infer that electrode surface interactions and roughness factors are critical considerations. 2D-hBN is utilized toward the sensing of DA in the presence of the common interferents ascorbic acid (AA) and:: uric acid (UA). 2D-hBN is found to be an effective electrocatalyst in the simultaneous detection of DA and UA at both pH 5.0 and 7.4. The peak separations/resolution between DA and UA increases by 70 and 50 mV (at pH 5.0 and 7.4 respectively,. when utilizing 108 ng of 2D-hBN) compared to unmodified SPEs, with a particularly favorable response evident in pH 5.0, giving rise to a significant increase in the peak current of DA. The limit of detection (3 sigma) is found to correspond to 0.65 mu M for DA in the presence of UA.. However, it is not possible to deconvolute the simultaneous detection of DA and AA. The observed electrocatalytic effect at 2D-hBN has not previously been reported in the literature when supported upon carbon or any other electrode. We provide valuable insights into the modifier substrate interactions of this material, essential for those,designing, fabricating, and consequently performing electrochemical experiments utilizing 2D-hBN and related 2D material.									120	1	0	0	21	1	121			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000384842200055	27659497

In addition, the ability to rapidly follow an intermittent load makes electrolysis an ideal solution for grid-balancing caused by differences in supply and demand for energy generation and consumption. Membrane-electrode assemblies (MEAs) designed for polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolysis, based on a novel short-side chain (SSC) perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) membrane, Aquivion((R)), with various cathode and anode noble metal loadings, were investigated in terms of both performance and durability. Utilizing a nanosized Ir0.7Ru0.3Ox,solid solution anode catalyst and a supported Pt/C cathode catalyst, in combination with the Aquivion((R)) membrane, gave excellent electrolysis performances exceeding 3.2 A cm(-2) at 1.8 V terminal cell voltage (similar to 80% efficiency) at 90 degrees C in the presence of a total catalyst loading of 1.6 mg cm(-2). A very small loss of efficiency, corresponding to 30 mV voltage increase, was recorded at 3 A cm(-2) using a total noble Metal catalyst loading of less than 0.5 mg.cm(-2) (compared to the industry standard of 2 mg cm(-2)). Steady-State durability tests, carried out for 1000 hat 1 A.cm(-2), showed excellent stability for the MEA with total noble metal catalyst loading of 1.6 mg .cm(-2) (cell voltage increase 5 VIII). Moderate degradation rate (cell voltage increase similar to 15 V/h) was recorded for the low loading 0.5 mg .cm(-2), MEA. Similar stability characteristics were observed in durability tests at 3 A .cm(-2). These high performance and stability characteristics were attributed to the enhanced proton conductivity and good stability of the novel membrane, the optimized structural properties of the Ir and Ru oxide solid solution and the enrichment of Ir species on the surface for the anodic catalyst.

However, the ecophysiological mechanisms explaining the decline of seaweeds is not fully understood. In vivo chlorophyll a fluorescence is used as an estimator of photosynthetic activity and physiological state of seaweeds. Collected at its southern distribution limit, Fucus serratus was cultured for two weeks in different temperatures (from 8 to 30 degrees C with increase of 2 degrees C). Growth rate, reproductive stage and fluorescence parameters were measured as maximal quantum yield (F-v/F-m), Electron transport rate (ETR), non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and the yield losses (YNO and YNPQ). At high temperature, the photosynthetic responses mimic the pattern of shade adapted plants, i.e., increase of photosynthetic efficiency (alpha(ETR)) and decrease of irradiance for saturation of photosynthetic rate (Ek(ETR)). At low irradiances (< 66 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and mainly at extreme temperatures (high and low), yield loss is dominated by YNO, suggesting heat dissipation due to closure of PSII reaction centers. However, at high irradiances (1150-1500 mu molm(-2) s(-1)) and in a wide range of temperatures (8-28 degrees C), yield loss is mainly due to Y(NPQ), related to the energy dissipation as heat throughout regulated photoprotective NPQ mechanisms such as the xanthophyll cycle. The optimal temperature for growth was 14-20 degrees C as ETRmax, whereas F-v/F-m maintains high values in a wider range of temperatures compared to ETRmax and Yield losses, indicating that F-v/F-m is not a good parameter to discriminate the effect of temperature on algal production. We discuss the use of ETR and yield losses to relate photosynthesis with growth, survival or reproduction under stress conditions. Our study shows that warming can increase photoprotection through yield loss and decrease the photosynthetic activity in macroalgae.									15	1	0	0	11	0	15			2211-9264			WOS:000472593800057

In this study, the effect of conducting support on the CO2RR behaviors of semi-conductive metal-organic framework (MOF) - Cu-3(HITP)(2) are carefully investigated. Compared to the stand-alone MOF, adding Ketjen Black greatly promotes C2H4 production with a stabilized Faradaic efficiency between 60-70% in a wide potential range and prolonged period. Multicrystalline Cu nano-crystallites in the reconstructed MOF are induced and stabilized by the conducting support via current shock and charge delocalization, which is analogous to the mechanism of dendrite prevention through conductive scaffolds in metal ion batteries. Density functional theory calculations elucidate that the contained multi-facets and rich grain boundaries promote C-C coupling while suppressing HER. This study underlines the key role of substrate-catalyst interaction, and the regulation of Cu crystalline states via conditioning the charge transport, in steering the CO2RR pathway.The substrate-catalyst interaction plays a critical role in steering the pathway of electrochemical CO2 reduction. Here the authors show the crystalline states of copper in reconstructed metal-organic frameworks were induced and stabilized by Ketjen Black conducting support, promoting C2H4 production.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17				2041-1723		WOS:000722322900010	34819521

Ru NPs covered with a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was analysed through the synchrotron-based hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES). Core levels (O 1s and C 1s & Ru 3p(3/2)) and valence band results provide a valuable information about the selective surface interaction of the Ru NPs. Preferential adsorption of CO2, CO and O-2 on the surface of fcc Ru 5.4 nm NP have been highlighted. This selective ability of fcc Ru 5.4 nm have been attributed to the existence of intermediate bond strength between the Ru 4d band and the O( )2p in the case of the fcc Ru 5.4 nm. Overcrowding effects were introduced to explain surface adsorption depending to the sizes. Thorough analyses of the valence-band maximum (VBM) showed a size dependent for hcp 2.4 nm (-0.14 eV) and 5.4 nm (-0.12 eV) while VBM is fixed at -0.19 eV for all hcp NPs. Electronic and chemical results and explanations are consistent with the catalytic efficiencies recorded on the Ru NPs. The current work provides a new step towards a complete understanding on the catalytic behaviour of metallic alloy nanoparticles based on the Ru. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

Surface states on light-absorbing semiconductors can function as recombination centers and lower the performance of water-splitting systems. To characterize the presence and impact of surface states on catalyst-coated semiconductors, transient photoelectrochemical behavior is often studied. These experiments typically assume that the filling/emptying of surface states at the semiconductor interface causes transients to occur whenever the incident illumination intensity is perturbed. Analyzing transients may then reveal the density of surface states and their effect on carrier recombination. However, the transient technique does not directly measure the origin of the transient behavior, and the utility of the experiment requires assuming an underlying process. Here, we use a dual-working-electrode technique applied to Ni-protected n-Si photoanodes coated with Ni(Fe) (oxy)hydroxide catalyst to examine transient behavior of catalyst-coated photoelectrodes. We find that the most pronounced transients are due to catalyst redox activity. By directly measuring the catalyst redox state, we confirm that transients are related to either catalyst oxidation to Ni(Fe) oxyhydroxide or reduction to Ni(Fe) hydroxide. We also find that the redox-active catalyst moderates how quickly the depletion region and Helmholtz electrostatic potentials relax after each illumination perturbation. The results indicate that a redox-active catalyst can serve as a parallel capacitor which influences both the decay time and shape of transients. This data shows that photocurrent transients on catalyzed photoanodes are influenced by the catalyst's redox-activity and are not solely based on surface state loading/emptying.									12	0	0	0	2	0	12			2398-4902			WOS:000443282700007

The prime requisite for obtaining good quality thin film is the optimisation of preparative conditions viz. substrate temperature, spray rate, concentration of solution etc. However, in recent years an emphasis has been given to a variety of atomization techniques such as ultrasonic nebulisation, improved spray hydrolysis, corona spray pyrolysis, electrostatic spray pyrolysis and microprocessor based spray pyrolysis. This is the most critical parameter as it enables control over the size of the droplets and their distribution over the preheated substrates. The enhancement in deposition efficiency and improvement in quality of the thin films can be achieved with these atomization techniques. The detailed processes are discussed in this review. An extensive review of thin film materials prepared during the last 10 years is given to demonstrate the versatility of the chemical SPT The various conditions to obtain thin films of metal oxide, metallic spinel oxides, binary, ternary and quaternary chalcogenides and superconducting oxides are also given. The effects of precursor dopants, substrate temperature, post annealing treatments, solution concentration etc., on the physico-chemical properties of these films are given as well. It is observed that the properties of thin films depend very much on the preparative conditions. The properties of the thin film can be easily tailored by adjusting or optimising these conditions, which in rum are suitable for a particular application. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S.A.

After quenching of the labeling reagent and isolation of the biotinylated molecules, the biotinylation sites were identified by Staphylococcus V8 protease digestion and analysis of the resultant peptide fragment mixture by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. When the 33-kDa extrinsic protein was modified on PS II membranes, three domains were biotinylated: K-14, K-41-K-76, and K-190-K-236. When the 33-kDa extrinsic protein was modified in solution, four additional domains were biotinylated: (1)E-K-4, K-20, K-101-K-105, and K-159-K-186. These additional modified domains reside in portions of the 33-kDa protein that are not accessible to the bulk solvent when the protein is associated with PS II and may define regions of interaction with the photosystem.									38	1	0	0	35	0	38			0006-2960			WOS:A1995RC78900024	7779793

A facile strategy for the synthesis of multilayered photoanodes from atomic-layer-deposited ultrathin films has enabled a new type of electrode architecture with a total multilayer thickness of 15-17 nm. We illustrate the advantages of this electrode architecture by using nanolayers to address different bottlenecks, thus producing a multilayer photoelectrode with improved interface kinetics and shorter electron transport path, as determined by interface analyses. The photocurrent density was twice that of the bare structure and reached a maximum of 33.3 +/- 2.1 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 VRHE. An integrated overall water-splitting cell consisting of an electrocatalytic NiS cathode and Bi2S3/NiS/NiFeO/TiO2 photoanode was used for precious-metal-free seawater splitting at a cell voltage of 1.23 V without degradation. The results and root analyses suggest that the distinctive advantages of the electrode architecture, which are superior to those of bulk bottom-up core-shell and hierarchical architectures, originate from the high density of active sites and nanometer-scale layer thickness, which enhance the suitability for interface-oriented energy conversion processes.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000782151100001	35334000

PCC 6803. Complementation analysis of this mutant (Tsll0606) indicated that an intact sll0606 gene could fully restore photoautotrophic growth. Gene organization in the vicinity of sll0606 indicates that it is not contained in an operon. No electron transport activity was detected in Tsll0606 using water as an electron donor and 2,6-dichlorobenzoquinone as an electron acceptor, indicating that Photosystem II (PS II) was defective. Electron transport activity using dichlorophenol indolephenol plus ascorbate as an electron donor to methyl viologen, however, was the same as observed in the control strain. This indicated that electron flow through Photosystem I was normal. Fluorescence induction and decay parameters verified that Photosystem II was highly compromised. The quantum yield for energy trapping by Photosystem II (F-V/F-M) in the mutant was less than 10% of that observed in the control strain. The small variable fluorescence yield observed after a single saturating flash exhibited aberrant Q(A)(-) reoxidation kinetics that were insensitive to dichloromethylurea. Immunological analysis indicated that whereas the D2 and CP47 proteins were modestly affected, the D1 and CP43 components were dramatically reduced. Analysis of two-dimensional blue native/lithium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels indicated that no intact PS II monomer or dimers were observed in the mutant. The CP43-less PS II monomer did accumulate to detectable levels. Our results indicate that the Sll0606 protein is required for the assembly/stability of a functionally competent Photosystem II.									7	1	0	0	7	0	8			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000282683000018	20724474

The electrodes have been characterized by different techniques such as cyclic voltammetry, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The effect on the electrochemical and crystallographic properties and surface morphology of the amount of copper in the oxide layer has been analyzed. The XPS spectra correspond to a characteristic monophasic Cu-Co spinel oxides when x is below 1. However, when the copper content exceeds that for the stoichiometric CuCo2O4 spinel, a new CuO phase segregates at the surface. The analysis of the surface cation distribution indicates that Cu(II) has preference for octahedral sites.									135	4	0	0	6	1	136			1520-6106			WOS:000242297500059	17125373

However, few studies have systematically considered nanostructures of a complete spinel series due to lack of stable and general synthesis strategies. This limits the development of rational structure-property-application pathways. Here, we provide a facile and general method to synthesize hierarchical flower-shaped spinel cobalt oxide (SCO) based materials by a one-step solution-phase thermal decomposition. This SCO material serves as an autonomous template to form bimetallic oxide spinels FexCo3-xO4 (Fe-SCO), MnxCo3-xO4 (Mn-SCO), NixCo3-xO4 (Ni-SCO), and even the ternary Fe-Ni-Co-O (FNC) spinel in a single step. Morphology control was explored by tuning multiple input parameters such as precursors, ligands, additives, and solvents. The ternary FNC spinel achieved the highest saturation magnetization (98.6 emu g(-1) at 10 kOe) reported for any cobalt spinel. This complete understanding of the SCO template with well-controlled shape and magnetization provides a general pathway to flower-like nanostructures of Co-dominant spinels. The SCO templated structures considered in detail here are only the tip of the iceberg. We have also produced Cu-, Ag-, Zn-, Pd-, Mo-, Gd-, Pt-, Al-, K-, Li-, and Cr- containing SCO, all showing flower shapes, and combining magnetic properties of Co spinel with properties of the doping elements. We believe this template and approach will be of broad utility for incorporating multiple elements in spinel nanostructures.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000581559100011

The synthesized photocatalysts are comprehensively characterized by SEM, XRD, BET, UV-vis DRS, Photoluminescence and XPS to investigate the morphological, crystalline, structural, optical properties and surface analysis. The photocatalytic activity is evaluated by measuring the ability of TiO2-CdS to generate H-2 gas by water splitting in the presence of hole scavengers under simulated solar light at AM 1.5G conditions. Our optimized sample TiO2-CdS (3:2) exhibited an enhanced photocatalytic activity by generating 954 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) of hydrogen which is similar to 1.4 and similar to 1.7 times higher than pure CdS nanoparticles and pure TiO2, respectively. The optimized sample achieved an apparent quantum efficiency of 3.53% along with good stability by generating a similar amount of H-2 for 40 consecutive hours. The enhanced photocatalytic activity and stability of the core-shell TiO2-CdS nanocomposite is attributed to the broader solar spectrum absorption, efficient photo-induced charge separation on the interface of TiO2-CdS due to the formation of heterojunction and high surface area with a large fraction of mesopores.					10th European Meeting on Solar Chemistry and Photocatalysis - Environmental Applications (SPEA)10th European Meeting on Solar Chemistry and Photocatalysis - Environmental Applications (SPEA)	JUN 04-08, 2018JUN 04-08, 2018	Univ AlmeriaUniv Almeria	Almeria, SPAINAlmeria, SPAIN	17	3	0	0	1	0	18			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000461462200004

Surface defects as recombination centers were considered as one of the most important factors in determining the efficiency of hematite. However, the defects have never been clearly identified, which strongly limits the targeted modification. Here we report the identification of surface Fe-(Iv) defects in hematite by using synchrotron radiation based X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Moreover, the Fe-(Iv) defects can be effectively passivated by facile surface engineering with boron-termination, which can suppress the surface recombination and then significantly improve the performance. The B-passivated hematite thus shows a large cathodic shift (up to 100 mV) of the onset potential when compared to the pristine sample, and can be effectively coupled with Ti-treatment and Co-Pi co-catalyst to finally achieve a high photocurrent of 2.61 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE. The results may open up a new way by targeted surface engineering to effectively passivate the defects in hematite.									18	2	0	0	3	0	18			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000430537200031	29616271

The tailored optical properties and enhanced photoinduced electron-hole separation in crystalline TiO2 (c-TiO2) was achieved by creating an amorphous shell (a-TiO2) around c-TiO2. The a-TiO2/c-TiO2 core shell particles were further modified by g-C3N4 coating, where amorphous a-TiO2 act as an interlayer between g-C3N4 and c-TiO2 nanocrystals. It was observed that photocatalytic degradation of Methylene Blue (MB) and water splitting to produce hydrogen was remarkably increased under visible-light upon coupling of a-TiO2/c-TiO2 core-shell particles with g-C3N4 and results in the best MB degradation performance of similar to 82% in 1 h and water splitting photocurrent density of 450 mu A/cm(2). The results from UV vis absorption study, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and electron microscopy, photoluminescence, photoelectrochemical measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy suggest that the improved photoactivity is due to the increased light absorption in visible region and efficient charge separation as a result of effective interfacial electron transfer between g-C3N4, a-TiO2 and c-TiO2 in g-C3N4/a-TiO2/c-TiO2 composite.

In this paper, we have examined the effect of high temperature (above 40 degrees C) on Chl a fluorescence rise kinetics starting from 40 mu s (to 1 s) in pea leaves (Pisum sativum). The variable Chl a fluorescence is strongly quenched after heat treatment. With increasing temperature or the duration of heat treatment a typical O-J-I-P transient (Strasser et al. (1995) Photochem. Photobiol., 61, 32-42) is transformed into an O-K-J-I-P transient, with an additional rapid step called K detected in the 200-300 mu s range. After prolonged heat treatment, the K-step becomes a dominant peak in the Chl a fluorescence transient followed by a large dip. We have investigated the origin and the possible interpretation of these changes by using NH2OH which acts as an electron donor to PS II, and DCMU which is known to block the PS II electron transport chain by displacing Q(B). From the present data we propose that the appearance of this K-step is due to two effects: (1) inhibition of the water splitting system that leads to a much slowed turn over of the reduction of Q(A); (2) changes in the architecture of the antenna of PS II which affect the energy migration properties within the photosynthetic unit. The K-step can thus be used as an indicator of the heterogeneity of photosynthetic units and as an indicator for the physiological state of the photosynthetic sample.									349	79	5	0	326	2	436			0005-2728	1879-2650		WOS:A1997XA45200011

On the other hand, TiO2 has its own set of limitations, namely its wide bandgap (Eg = similar to 3.2 eV), which makes it less effective in sunlight. A few methods have been reported to overcome these problems, one of which is to make a heterojunction composite with other materials. The added material can inject electrons directly into the conduction band of TiO2 and provide a tiered band structure, which can reduce the occurrence of photogenerated electron and hole recombination. Currently, the research and development of heterojunctions consisting of TiO2 with chalcogenide materials has attracted the attention of many researchers. Metal chalcogenides offer a number of advantages, including absorption onset tuning, a size-dependent bandgap that can lead to high theoretical quantum efficiencies, effective charge transfer to the conduction band when TiO2 is exposed to visible light, and high photochemical stability. In this review, the performance of various TiO2/metal chalcogenide heterojunctions for photoelectrochemical water splitting is presented. The role of most common metal chalcogenides in TiO2 will be exposed. Finally, the review concludes with a summary and recommendations for further research on this hot issue.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000752828800003

The Ni-PANI film is amorphous in nature and exhibits a mesoporous cauliflower like morphology. The multifunctional characteristics of Ni-PANI as an electrode for a smart supercapacitor are investigated using electrochemical and optical techniques in 0.5 M LiClO4 +PC electrolyte. It is dark blue when it is charged at 0.7 V (vs SCE), and it is transparent when it is discharged at -0.7 V (vs SCE). Moreover, it can exhibit other colours like sky blue and parrot green in intermediate states. Specific discharge capacitance of 543 Fg(-1) and 267 Fg(-1) at a current density of 1 Ag-1 is obtained for Ni-PANI and pure PANI respectively. The observed colouration efficiency is 45.9 cm(2)C(-1) for Ni-PANI and 35.1 cm(2)C(-1) for pure PANI at a wavelength of 630 nm. An outstanding optical modulation of 55.6% with a capacity retention of 90% after 5000 cycles is obtained for Ni-PANI electrode. The robust synthesis of Ni-PANI electrodes with efficient smart supercapacitor activity can be used as alternative materials in smart energy storage devices.									31	1	0	0	1	0	32			0927-0248	1879-3398		WOS:000487572500040

While hibonite is the second major phase (after corundum, Al2O3) expected to condense from stellar ejecta with C/O < 1, it has not previously been found. One circumstellar hibonite grain is highly enriched in O-17 and slightly depleted in O-18 relative to the solar composition and has large excesses in Mg-26 and K-41, decay products of Al-26 and Ca-41. The inferred initial values (Al-26/Al-27)(0) approximate to 5 x 10(-3) and (Ca-41/Ca-40)(o) approximate to 1.5 x 10(-4) of this grain are consistent with models of nucleosynthesis in an AGB star. The other hibonite is enriched in O-17, strongly depleted in O-18, shows no evidence of Ca-41 and formed with (Al-26/Al-27)(0) approximate to 2 x 10(-2). The low O-18/O-16 and very high (Al-26/Al-27)(0) may indicate substantial proton exposure during cool bottom processing in a law-mass parent star. The low upper limit on Ca-41/Ca-40 (less than or equal to 3.2 x 10(-5)) implies that little or no He-shell material had been dredged into the envelope when this grain formed. We also report isotopic compositions for 12 new circumstellar corundum grains. The compositions of 11 of these grains are consistent with current models for red giant and AGB stars. One corundum grain has extremely high O-17/O-16 and near-solar O-18/O-16 and may have formed in a star that was initially enriched in O-17 and O-18.									89	0	0	0	0	0	89			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000082360400014

The low efficiency of photo-generated charge separation caused by fast electron-hole recombination is regarded as a challenge that hinders the further improvement of TiO2 photoanode performance in PEC cells. Here, the nitrogen-doped carbon dots (N-CDs) anchored TiO2 photoanodes were fabricated by one-step hydrothermal method. The in-situ transient photovoltage (TPV) technology shows that electron-trap effect is formed in TiO2 photoanode due to the existence of N-CDs. Meanwhile, the enhancement of photo-generated charge separation efficiency was proven as the charge extraction of TiO2 is promoted by similar to 160% after anchoring N-CDs. Besides, N-CDs increase the conductivity of TiO2 photoanode and promote the efficiency of photo-generated charge transfer. In addition, the impedance of TiO2 photoanode and its interface are reduced by similar to 34% and similar to 66%, respectively. Under AM 1.5G light intensity and 1.23 V vs. RHE, the highest photocurrent densities of TiO2/N-CDs (TNCD-15 mg) is 3.09 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M NaOH, which is similar to 3.22 times as high as that of the primitive TiO2. This work explains the mechanism of anchoring N-CDs to improve PEC performance through in-situ characterization, which provides a new idea for PEC material design to achieve higher PEC performances.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000788058900003

High charge carrier recombination critically limits the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4. Plasmonic metal nanoparticles that can generate localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) have been suggested to enhance the harvesting of visible light and to improve water splitting efficiency. However, direct contact between metal nanoparticles and g-C3N4 reduces the hydrogen generation efficiency owing to energy loss by Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET), which competes with plasmon resonance energy transfer (PRET). Decorating g-C3N4 with Ag@SiO2 core-shell plasmonic nanoparticles increases its photocatalytic ability. Tuning the size of the SiO2 nanogap can optimize the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4/Ag@SiO2, which involves a trade-off between PRET and FRET. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is utilized to investigate the electronic structure of g-C3N4 and its modulation with Ag@SiO2. In situ XAS reveals the dynamics of the charge carriers under solar illumination. Analytic results suggest charge redistribution, shifting of the conduction band, modification of the unoccupied states, and consequent improvement in photocatalytic activity by solar illumination. This work sheds light on the effect of LSPR on this photocatalyst with reference to its electronic structure.					3rd International Conference on Applied Surface Science (ICASS)3rd International Conference on Applied Surface Science (ICASS)	JUN 17-19, 2019JUN 17-19, 2019		Pisa, ITALYPisa, ITALY	4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000523185200030

The material not only has a micro/mesoporous structure and a large surface area, but also owns two clear band gaps: a narrow 1.7 eV and a wide 3.1 eV band gap, which can be ascribed to Calix-3 and Gel-TiO2, respectively. When Pt nanoparticles as co-catalysts are introduced onto the hybrid, the optimized Pt/Calix-3-TiO2 catalyst exhibits high hydrogen production activity (2444 mmol g(-1) h(-1) based on Pt mass) and performs with excellent stability even after recycling 10 times (a turnover number of 24 920 after 50 h), which is superior to that of the analogous sensitized Pt/Gel-TiO2/Calix-3 system and represents one of the highest among those reported heterogeneous catalytic systems under visible-light. The enhancement in efficiency and stability could be attributed to the more stable Ti-O-Calix-3 linkage and more efficient electron transfer between Calix-3 and TiO2. The micro/mesoporous TiO2 in the hybrid protects the dye, facilitates reactant/product transfer, and works as an electron transporting mediator and a reservoir simultaneously. The current study offers an inspiration for the design and application of new multi-functional organic-inorganic hybrid systems in efficient photocatalysis.									22	2	0	0	3	0	22			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000458682100004

Iron oxide films are inherently nonconductive and porous, therefore the objective of this investigation was to optimize a methodology that would increase the conductivity of the film to facilitate high resolution imaging with a scanning electron microscopy and to preserve the porous nature of the film that could potentially be damaged by the energy of the FIB. Sputter coating the sample with a thin layer of iridium before creating the cross section with the FIB decreased sample charging and drifting, but differentiating the iron layer from the iridium coating with backscattered electron imaging was not definitive, making accurate assumptions of the delineation between the two metals difficult. Moreover, the porous nature of the film was lost due to beam damage following the FIB process. A thin layer plastication technique was therefore used to embed the porous film in epoxy resin that would provide support for the film during the FIB process. However, the thickness of the resin created using conventional thin layer plastication processing varied across the sample, making the measuring process only possible in areas where the resin layer was at its thinnest. Such variation required navigating the area for ideal milling areas, which increased the subjectivity of the process. We present a method to create uniform thin resin layers, of controlled thickness, that are ideal for quantifying the thickness of porous nonconductive films with FIB/scanning electron microscopy.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0022-2720	1365-2818		WOS:000433583200004	29369353

The UV/Vis, FTIR, and photoluminescence spectra of the synthesized S-GOQDs exhibit three absorption bands at 333, 395, and 524 nm, characteristic of C=S and C=S stretching vibration signals at 1075 and 690 cm(-1), and two excitation-wavelength-independent emission signals with maxima at 451 and 520 nm, respectively, confirming the successful doping of S atom into the GOQDs. Electronic structural analysis suggested that the S-GOQDs exhibit conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) levels suitable for water splitting. Under direct sunlight irradiation, an initial rate of 18166 mu molh(-1) g(-1) in pure water and 30519 mu molh(-1) g(-1) in 80% ethanol aqueous solution were obtained.

Going beyond characterization of the catalyst resting state, we compare redox and structural dynamics of three representative birnessite-type Mn(Ca) oxides (catalytically active versus inactive; with/without calcium) and the biological catalyst. In the synthetic oxides, Mn oxidation was induced by increasingly positive electrode potentials and monitored by electrochemical freeze-quench and novel timeresolved in situ experiments involving detection of X-ray absorption and UV-vis transients, complemented by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. A minority fraction of Mn(III) ions present at catalytic potentials is found to be functionally crucial; calcium ions are inessential but tune redox properties. Redoxstate changes of the water-oxidizing Mn oxide are similarly fast as observed in the biological catalyst (<10 ms), but 10-100 times slower in the catalytically inactive oxide. Surprisingly similar redox dynamics of biological catalyst and water-oxidizing Mn(Ca) oxides suggest that in both catalysts, rather than direct oxidation of bound water species, oxidation equivalents are accumulated before onset of the multielectron O-O bond formation chemistry in Mn(III)-Mn(IV) oxidation steps coupled to changes in the oxo-bridging between metal ions. Aside from the ability of the bulk oxide to undergo Mn oxidation-state changes, we identify two further, likely interrelated prerequisites for catalytic activity of the synthetic oxides: (i) the presence of Mn(III) ions at catalytic potentials preventing formation of an inert all-Mn(IV) oxide and (ii) fast rates of redox-state changes approaching the millisecond time domain.									79	1	0	0	11	0	79			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000382749700027

It is located in the southern Superior Province in contact with, and immediately south of the east-west trending Cadillac-Larder Lake fault zone, which delineates the boundary between the Pontiac and Abitibi subprovinces. The deposit is hosted by Pontiac Group metaturbidites, Piche Group mafic-ultramafic metavolcanics and by porphyritic quartz monzodiorite to granodiorite that intruded these lithologies. The metamorphic grade increases southward from upper greenschist facies, which characterizes the immediate metamorphic environment of the Canadian Malartic deposit, to midamphibolite facies; the garnet isograd is crossed 1.5 km south of the deposit, and the staurolite isograd about one kilometer further south. Textural, structural and geochronological observations are consistent with a syn-kinematic (D-2), early- to syn-peak metamorphic (M-2) timing for the main ore-forming event.Mineralization in the metasedimentary rocks and porphyritic intrusions consists of disseminated native gold and minor gold-tellurides within stockworks of quartz-biotite-microcline-carbonate +/- pyrite veinlets (v2) and associated pervasive microcline-albite-biotite +/- (white mica)-carbonate-pyrite alteration. A zonal distribution of alteration is centered on structures that acted as preferential pathways for the hydrothermal fluids (e.g., Sladen Fault, NW-SE deformation zones). In the metasedimentary rocks, the proximal potassic alteration zone is dominated by microcline-albite +/- quartz with variable proportions of phlogopite (+/- white mica), carbonate minerals (calcite-ankerite +/- Fe-dolomite), quartz, pyrite and rutile. It grades outwards into a distal potassic-sericitic alteration zone characterized by relatively abundant Mg-rich biotite and phengitic white mica, as well as microcline, albite, quartz, calcite, pyrite and rutile. The zonal distribution of alteration features was due in part to a decrease in the total activity of sulfur species (?aS) and oxygen fugacity (fO(2)) away from the main hydrothermal corridors, which is manifested by systematic changes in Fe-sulfide and (Fe-Ti)-oxide mineralogy.The effects of sulfidation (?aS), oxidation (fO(2)) as well as K+, Fe2+ and H+ activity on biotite and white mica compositions were assessed from silicate-oxide-sulfide equilibria. Increasing ?aS-fO(2) conditions proximal to the hydrothermal fluid pathways caused pyrite to be stabilized over biotite, and iron sequestration in the sulfide phase in turn promoted the stability of magnesian biotite. Increasing sulfur metasomatism towards the hydrothermal centers was associated with systematic increases in biotite Mg# [Mg/(Fe-total + Mg)] and fluorine concentration, in agreement with the Fe-F avoidance principle. Alteration was also associated with a decrease in Al in biotite and white mica, coincident with increases in Si and Fe + Mg concentrations. These compositional trends were controlled by a Tschermak exchange reaction and are consistent with a gradual decrease in aK(+) and/or pH upon progressive rock-buffering of a mildly alkaline, potassium-rich ore-forming fluid.Multicomponent phase equilibria (pseudosections), constrained for specified bulk rock compositions typical of non-mineralized Pontiac Group metasedimentary rocks, are used to model the expected composition of mica solid solutions under varying metamorphic P-T conditions. The thermodynamic modelling of biotite and white mica compositions suggests that the district-scale compositional trends documented for biotite and white mica along the metaraorphic gradient, including the progression of the Tschermak substitution towards more aluminous compositions southwards, were likely the product of increasing metamorphic P-T conditions, rather than a distal effect of hydrothermal alteration.Mica mineral chemistry is clearly a sensitive indicator of hydrothermal and metamorphic processes at Canadian Malartic. Our results show that biotite and white mica compositions provide valuable tools that can be used to define hydrothermal fluid pathways in and around the deposit. These factors should be particularly useful for mapping the zonation of alteration features that characterize the footprint of major gold deposits in metamorphic terranes where micas typically display a spatial distribution ideal for defining mineral-chemical vectors to ore.									31	1	0	0	0	0	31			0169-1368	1872-7360		WOS:000432760500044

Due to difficult release of O-2 from photocatalysts, the simultaneous generation of H-2 and O-2 is a critical challenge for water splitting. B and K co-doped g-C3N4 (B/K-g-C3N4) catalyst was synthesized by the recyclable molten-salt method in this study. Compared with the K doped and pristine g-C3N4 samples, B/K-g-C3N4 exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity for water vapor splitting under visible light illumination. The yield ratio of H-2 and O-2 reached approximately 2:1, and the corresponding rates were 1.18 and 0.58 mu mol/h after 24 h of illumination. The B/K-g-C3N4 sample demonstrated good photocatalytic stability after 9 cycles. Additionally, the co-doped g-C3N4 catalyst, obtained from the repeatedly recyclable salts, still exhibited equivalent photocatalytic activity. Based on the built structure model with g-C3N4, the HOMO and LUMO distributions were changed by B and K co-doping, leading to improved separation of photoinduced carriers. The photocatalytic mechanism for water splitting over g-C3N4 semiconductor was speculated.									17	3	0	0	0	0	17			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000582798700096

Here, superstructure Ta3N5 mesocrystals with the high-energy surface {2 0 0} planes exposed were the first time to be successfully fabricated by topological transformation of Ta2O5 mesocrystals. The prepared Ta3N5 mesocrystals showed enhanced visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of 98.67 mu mol g(-1) for 180 min irradiation, which was approximately 5.28 times that of comm-Ta3N5 prepared with commercial Ta2O5 as the starting material, mainly due to the formation of long-distance electron conduction pathways and long-lived charges. The detailed electronic band structures of the prepared Ta3N5 mesocrystals were also investigated by electrochemical method. Finally, possible visible-light photocatalytic mechanisms of Ta3N5 mesocrystals for enhanced hydrogen production was also proposed in detail. Current work also indicates that tantalum-based mesocrystals show great potential to enhance the charge separation for efficient photocatalytic water splitting. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Subsequently, photodegradation experiment for the resultant samples was carried out using Rhodamine B (RhB) and tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) as organismas targeted pollutants under visible-light irradiation, indicates that AB@GCN/BOB ternary photocatalytic system exhibits greater photocatalytic activity than g-C3N4 (GCN), BiOBr, and GCN/BOB catalysts. Moreover, the highly enhanced activity was accredited to improved optical absorption and higher efficiency of separation/transfer of photoinduced h(+)/e(-) of AB@GCN/BOB system. Furthermore, the possible visible-light-responsive degradation mechanism of AB@GCN/BOB is discussed in detail, indicating superoxide radicals (center dot O-2(-)), photoinduced holes (h(+)) as the major active species during the photodegradation process.									32	0	0	0	7	0	32			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000483454200127

Herein, we demonstrate the ability to synthesize photoactive, relatively cheap and abundant catalyst for the solar-assisted water splitting. The proposed catalyst is a composite of Co-Cu/graphene immobilized on hierarchical hollow mesoporous Titania. Diffuse Reflectance analysis showed visible light absorption for (Co-Cu) (2%)-TiO2/RGO with an estimated band gap of 2.41 eV, as compared to 3.13 eV for Titania. Photoluminescence spectra showed a significant decreasing in recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pair for (Co-Cu) (2%)-TiO2/RGO nanocomposites. Upon their use as photoanodes in solar fuel cells, the fabricated nanocomposites show 14-fold increase in photocurrent density compared to Titania. This enhancement was confirmed via the measurement of electron and phonon life times. The results attained in this study demonstrate a step toward using non-precious co-catalysts to boost the performance of photocatalysts in solar fuel cells. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genomic HDR transgene-induced gene-silencing lines are albino, variegated, or pale green, confirming that HDR is essential for plants. We used Escherichia coli isoprenoid synthesis H (Protein Data Bank code 3F7T) as a template for homology modeling to identify key amino acids of Arabidopsis HDR. The predicted model reveals that cysteine (Cys)-122, Cys-213, and Cys-350 are involved in iron-sulfur cluster formation and that histidine (His)-152, His-241, glutamate (Glu)-242, Glu-243, threonine (Thr)-244, Thr-312, serine-379, and asparagine-381 are related to substrate binding or catalysis. Glu-242 and Thr-244 are conserved only in cyanobacteria, green algae, and land plants, whereas the other key amino acids are absolutely conserved from bacteria to plants. We used site-directed mutagenesis and complementation assay to confirm that these amino acids, except His-152 and His-241, were critical for Arabidopsis HDR function. Furthermore, the Arabidopsis HDR contains an extra amino-terminal domain following the transit peptide that is highly conserved from cyanobacteria, and green algae to land plants but not existing in the other bacteria. We demonstrated that the amino-terminal conserved domain was essential for Arabidopsis and cyanobacterial HDR function. Further analysis of conserved amino acids in the amino-terminal conserved domain revealed that the tyrosine-72 residue was critical for Arabidopsis HDR. These results suggest that the structure and reaction mechanism of HDR evolution have become specific for oxygen-evolving photosynthesis organisms and that HDR probably evolved independently in cyanobacteria versus other prokaryotes.									8	1	0	0	6	0	8			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000341653900006	25037211

Flexible preparation of lattice-matching Ni2P-Co2P heterointerfaces is exploited to promote electrochemical activity for overall water splitting because of the outstanding electrical conductivity of Co2P and admirable durability of Ni2P. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that construction of lattice-matching Ni2P-Co2P heterogeneous interfaces and the regulation of density of states between the heterogeneous interfaces can effectively optimize the water adsorption energy. Hence, a series of NixP-Co2P hybrid materials were in site grown on nickel foam through hydrothermal synthesis and phosphorization approach. What is noteworthy is that the Ni2P-Co-2 P-0.5//Ni2P-Co2P-1 electrode couple presents superior electrochemical performance with only 1.60 V cell voltage to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) under alkaline condition. In addition, the Ni2P-Co2P-0.5//Ni2P-Co2P-1 electrode couple display superior durability over 15 h at large current densities of 30 mA cm(-2) during water electrolysis process. The construction of heterostructures is conducive to the regulation of state density and the maximization of synergistic catalytic effect. The work provides a novel idea for the exploitation of highly efficient and robust water electrolysis catalysts and this work might be a new breakthrough for the construction of lattice-matching hybrid structures.

The TiO2 thin film was characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, UV photoelectron spectroscopy, UV-visible spectroscopy, and photoelectrochemical measurements: It is an n-type semiconductor of the rutile-type TiO2. The electrochemical ozone production (EOP) was realized, and a high current efficiency of 9% was achieved at a low current density of 8.9 mA cm(-2) in 0.01 M HClO4 at 15 degrees C. The observed high efficiency of EOP was considered to originate from the electrocatalysis of the n-type TiO2 in the dark when a large anodic bias was applied in which, based on the band structure of the n-type TiO2/HClO4 solution interface, electron tunneling can take place through a deep depletion layer of the TiO2 surface.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15			0013-4651			WOS:000273222700054

One of these is the gravitationally confined detonation model. In this case a weak deflagration burns to the surface, wraps around the bound core, and collides at the antipode. A subsequent detonation is then initiated in the collision area. Since the parameter space for this scenario, that is, varying central densities and ignition geometries, has not been studied in detail, we used pure deflagration models of a previous parameter study dedicated to Type Iax supernovae as initial models to investigate the gravitationally confined detonation scenario. We aim to judge whether this channel can account for one of the many subgroups of Type Ia supernovae, or even normal events. To this end, we employed a comprehensive pipeline for three-dimensional Type Ia supernova modeling that consists of hydrodynamic explosion simulations, nuclear network calculations, and radiative transfer. The observables extracted from the radiative transfer are then compared to observed light curves and spectra. The study produces a wide range in masses of synthesized Ni-56 ranging from 0.257 to 1.057 M-circle dot, and, thus, can potentially account for subluminous as well as overluminous Type Ia supernovae in terms of brightness. However, a rough agreement with observed light curves and spectra can only be found for 91T-like objects. Although several discrepancies remain, we conclude that the gravitationally confined detonation model cannot be ruled out as a mechanism to produce 91T-like objects. However, the models do not provide a good explanation for either normal Type Ia supernovae or Type Iax supernovae.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000763012500006

Herein, a series of p-type Cu-doped CdS1-xSex alloy thin films as photocathodes for water splitting is reported. These alloyed films, synthesized via a simple but well-controlled physical vapor deposition (PVD) method, are fully tunable in chemical composition, which leads to a tunable bandgap from 1.69 to 2.40 eV. Benefiting from the broadened visible light response, the Cu:CdS0.7Se0.3 photocathode with Pt nanoparticles (NPs) as cocatalysts shows a 37% higher photocurrent density and a higher Faradaic efficiency compared with previously reported Cu:CdS/Pt. More importantly, good stability of the Cu:CdS0.7Se0.3/Pt photocathode in scavenger-free electrolyte for PEC water splitting is first achieved, with 80% remaining photocurrent and no significant change in 5 h. The released Cd2+ in the electrolyte for the p-type Cu:CdS1-xSex/Pt photocathode is suppressed by more than three orders of magnitude as compared with a traditional n-type CdS1-xSex/Pt photoanode. The results reveal the feasibility of Cd-based group II-VI materials as the thin-film photocathode for PEC water splitting. The tunable bandgap and durability of p-type Cu:CdS1-xSex can contribute to future heterojunction structure design in PEC cells.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2367-198X			WOS:000509970300001

Models with a large nickel production give light curves comparable to those of typical Type Ia supernovae. Subluminous supernovae can be explained by models with a low nickel production. Multiband light curves are presented in comparison with the normally bright event SN 1992bc and the subluminous events SN 1991bg and SN 1992bo to establish the principle that the delayed detonation paradigm in Chandrasekhar mass models may give a common explosion mechanism accounting for both normal and subluminous SN Ia's.Secondary IR-maxima are formed in the models of normal SN Ia's as a photospheric effect if the photospheric radius continues to increase well after maximum light. Secondary maxima appear later and stronger in models with moderate expansion velocities and with radioactive material closer to the surface. Model light curves for subluminous SN Ia's tend to show only one ''late'' IR-maximum.In some delayed detonation models shell-like envelopes form, which consist of unburned carbon and oxygen. The formation of molecules in these envelopes is addressed. If the model retains a C/O-envelope and is subluminous, strong vibration bands of CO may appear, typically several weeks past maximum light. CO should be very weak or absent in normal SN Ia's.									160	4	0	0	0	0	161			0004-637X			WOS:A1995QV70100033

However, the efficiencies reported are still too low for practical application due to the high recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, which can be improved by optimizing the design and assembly of highly ordered pore structures. In our work, a composite plasmonic metal/semiconductor photocatalyst, Au/ZnO hybrid inverse-opal nanomaterial (Au/ZnO-IO), was prepared by in-situ grown Au nanoparticles on inner and outer of ZnO framework. The 3D ordered Au/ZnO-IO photocatalyst exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity in bisphenol A degradation and photoelectrochemical water splitting. The improved photoactivities were proved to be caused by the increased light absorption and special charge transfer of photogenerated electrons, which significantly restraint the recombination rate and prolong the lifetime of photoexcited carries. Based on the analysis of active species experiments, photoelectrochemical measurements, energy level of schottky junction and finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations, the degradation mechanism on Au/ZnO-IO nanocomposite was supposed. This work provides insights into the charge transfer regulation by constructing the 3D plasmonic metal/semiconductor inverse-opal photocatalyst and may serve as a promising strategy for photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants and water splitting.									50	2	0	0	5	0	51			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000543713600020

Boesgaard & King discovered corresponding, but smaller, deficiencies in Be in the same narrow temperature region in the Hyades. Using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope, we investigate B abundances in the Hyades F stars to look for a potential B dip using the B I resonance line at 2496.8 angstrom. The light elements Li, Be, and B are destroyed inside stars at increasingly hotter temperatures: 2.5, 3.5, and 5. x. 10(6) K, respectively. Consequently, these elements survive to increasingly greater depths in a star and their surface abundances indicate the depth and thoroughness of mixing in the star. We have (re) determined Li abundances/upper limits for 79 Hyades dwarfs, Be for 43 stars, and B for 5 stars. We find evidence for a small drop in the B abundance across the Li-Be dip. The B abundances for the four stars in the temperature range 6100-6730 K fit the B-Be correlation found previously by Boesgaard et al. Models of rotational mixing produce good agreement with the relative depletions of Be and B in the dip region. We have compared our nLTE B abundances for the three high B stars on either side of the Li-Be dip with those found by Duncan et al. for the two Hyades giants. This confirms the factor of 10 decline in the B abundance in the Hyades giants as predicted by dilution due to the deepening of the surface convection zone.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000400463200002

The asprepared Ag3PO4-GNS composite photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric (TG) analysis, ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and photoluminescence (PL) spectra. It was found that the Ag3PO4 particles were well deposited on the surfaces of GNS. Compared with bare Ag3PO4 and Ag3PO4-rGO composite, the Ag3PO4-GNS composite exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity for the photodegradation of rhodamine B (RhB) under visible light irradiation. The photocatalytic degradation rate of Ag3PO4-GNS composite was 1.7 times that of bare Ag3PO4 and about 1.3 times that of Ag3PO4-rGO for the degradation of RhB. Furthermore, the photocatalytic stability of Ag3PO4-GNS composite was also greatly enhanced. This enhanced photocatalytic activity and stability could be ascribed to the positive synergetic effects between the Ag3PO4 particles and GNS sheets, which could provide a greater number of active adsorption sites, suppress charge recombination and reduce the serious photocorrosion of Ag3PO4. Moreover, the photocatalytic degradation of RhB over Ag3PO4-GNS composites was also optimized, suggesting that the optimal amount of GNS in the composites was 11.4 wt.%. This work shows a great potential of Ag3PO4-GNS composite for environmental treatment of organic pollutants.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			1793-2920	1793-7094		WOS:000369098400001		
J	FRANKEL, LK; BRICKER, TM								INTERACTION OF CPA-1 WITH THE MANGANESE-STABILIZING PROTEIN OF PHOTOSYSTEM-II - IDENTIFICATION OF DOMAINS ON CPA-1 WHICH ARE SHIELDED FROM N-HYDROXYSUCCINIMIDE BIOTINYLATION BY THE MANGANESE-STABILIZING PROTEIN								BIOCHEMISTRY				31	45			11059	11064		10.1021/bi00160a015				NOV 17 1992	1992	The structural organization of photosystem II proteins has been investigated by use of the amino group-labeling reagent N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin (NHS-biotin) and calcium chloride-washed photosystem II membranes. We have previously shown that the presence of the extrinsic, manganese-stabilizing protein on photosystem II membranes prevents the modification of lysyl residues located on the chlorophyll protein CPa-1 (CP-47) by NHS-biotin [Bricker, T. M., Odom, W. R., & Queirolo, C. B. (1988) FEBS Lett. 231, 111-117]. Upon removal of the manganese-stabilizing protein by calcium chloride-washing, CPa-1 can be specifically modified by treatment with NHS-biotin. Preparative quantities of biotinylated CPa-1 were subjected to chemical cleavage with cyanogen bromide. Two major biotinylated peptides were identified with apparent molecular masses of 11.8 and 15.7 kDa. N-terminal sequence analysis of these peptides indicated that the 11.8-kDa peptide was 232G-330M and that the 15.7-kDa peptide was 360P-508V. The 15.7-kDa CNBr peptide was subjected to limited tryptic digestion. The two smallest tryptic fragments identified migrated at apparent molecular masses of 9.1 (nonbiotinylated) and 7.5 kDa (biotinylated). N-terminal sequence analysis and examination of the predicted amino acid sequences of these peptides suggest that the 9.1-kDa fragment was 422R-508V and that the 7.5-kDa fragment was 360P-421A. These results strongly suggest that two NHS-biotinylated domains, 304K-321K and 389K-419K, become exposed on CPa-1 when the manganese-stabilizing protein is removed by CaCl2 treatment. Both of these domains lie in the large extrinsic loop E of CPa-1.									40	0	0	0	37	0	40			0006-2960			WOS:A1992JY67500015	1445844

We describe here the development and application of a multiphysics model to investigate the fundamental limitations of two MEA designs: one with gaseous feeds at both the anode and cathode (full-MEA), and the other with an aqueous anode feed (KHCO3 or KOH exchange solution) and a gaseous cathode feed (exchange-MEA). The total current density for the three cases follows the order: KOH-MEA > KHCO3-MEA 4 full-MEA. This trend is established by examining the distribution of the applied voltage. We show that the main charge-carrying species are carbonate anions for an MEA that uses an anion-exchange membrane (AEM). The amount of CO2 consumed but not converted to CO decreases with increasing current densities above 100 mA cm(2) for a full-MEA, but converges to 50% for exchange-MEAs. The full-MEA becomes limited by ohmic resistance as the membrane dehydrates with increasing cell temperature, and eventually becomes limited due to water mass transport. The exchange-MEAs can maintain membrane hydration and the local ion concentration at the anode, but are limited by salt precipitation at the cathode, as well as a higher tendency to flood. Finally, we explore the effects of temperature and discuss the possibility of increasing water supply to the full-MEA to improve its performance at elevated temperatures. The MEA model and the understanding of MEA performance for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 presented in this study should help guide the design of next-generation CO2 reduction cells.									155	1	0	0	8	0	154			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000471283100014

Here we present a detailed model of the photochemistry of haze formation in the early atmosphere, and we examine the effects of such a haze layer on climate and ultraviolet radiation. We show that the thickness of the haze layer was limited by a negative feedback loop: A haze optical depth of more than similar to0.5 in the visible would have produced a strong "antigreenhouse effect," thereby cooling the surface and slowing the rate at which CH4 was produced. Given this climatic constraint on its visible optical depth, the amount of UV shielding provided by the haze can be estimated from knowledge of the optical properties and size distribution of the haze particles. Contrary to previous studies [Sagan and Chyba, 1997], we find that when the finite size of the particles is taken into account, the amount of UV shielding provided by the haze is small. Thus NH3 should have been rapidly photolyzed and should not have been sufficiently abundant to augment the atmospheric greenhouse effect. We also examine the question of whether photosynthetically generated O-2 could have accumulated beneath the haze layer. For the model parameters considered here, the answer is "no": The upper limit on ground level O-2 concentrations is similar to 10(-6) atm, and a more realistic estimate for PO2 during the late Archean is 10(-18) atm. The stability of both O-2 and NH3 is sensitive to the size distribution and optical properties of the haze particles, neither of which is well known. Further theoretical and laboratory work is needed to address these uncertainties.									178	1	0	0	47	0	180			2169-9097	2169-9100		WOS:000171925900007

To cope up with the power hunger of industrial and/ technological world of hybrid electric vehicles and portable electronic devices it is imperative to search the environment friendly novel materials with property tailoring abilities. In this connection, we have deposited Co1-xCuxS/CoCuS (0.025 <= x <= 0.1) thin-films via chemical route as an alternative material for supercapacitor application. To asses the suitability of as-deposited thin films, we have characterized thin films using variety of characterization techniques. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to examine and confirm the chemical states of Co, Cu, and S. Surface morphology of as-deposited CoCuS film (x = 0.075, sample-C-3) showed a crumpled flower-like microstructure. Uniform distribution of hillocks and valleys was observed using atomic force microscopy. The topographical outcomes obtained from electrostatic force microscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy confirmed that the sample-C-3 (x = 0.075) is suitable for energy storage applications. Sample-C-3 demonstrated excellent supercapacitive performance with a high specific capacitance of 907.55 F g(-1) at 5 mV s(-1), remarkable rate capability, and similar to 90% of capacitive retention after 5000 cycles in a 1 M KOH electrolyte. Better supercapacitive behavior and cycling stability of the CoCuS samples may offer a perspective for various mixed metal sulfide thin films with hierarchical architectures as an viable alternative for the efficient energy storage devices.

Herein, a simple topochemical conversion strategy is employed to synthesize cobalt-doped Ni3S2 (Co-Ni3S2) ultrathin nanosheets on Ni foam. The Co-Ni3S2 nanosheets are controlled synthesized by using Co-Ni(OH)(2) ultrathin nanosheets as templates with anneal and sulfurization treatment, showing exceptional electrocatalytic activity. This template-assisted method can also be applied to obtain Ni, NiO, and NiPx nanosheets, providing a universal strategy to synthesize ultrathin nanosheets of nonlayered materials. The overall water splitting of this Co-Ni3S2 ultrathin nanosheets achieves a low voltage of 1.54 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and high durability in 1 m KOH, comparable to the best performance of electrochemical water splitting ever reported. The detailed structural transformation of Ni-based sulfides in the catalytic process and its mechanism are further explored both experimentally and theoretically.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000669958700001	34228390

As a result, 2D-2D and 1D-2D magnetic photocatalysts were achieved. MNS function as directing agents of BiOCl growth and control the oriented growth of BiOCl; furthermore, they compress the BiOCl crystal lattice due to the strain at the interface between MNS and BiOCl. BiOCl grown on 2D nano-sheets exhibits a flower-like morphology that consists of square nanosheets, while exhibiting the morphology of epispastic sponge for BiOCl grown on 1D heterogeneous nano-chains. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been reported before. The synergistic effects of MNS and BiOCl enhance the absorbance in the visible-light spectrum. All magnetic photocatalysts exhibited excellent adsorption and degradation abilities to target pollutants such as rhodamine B, methylene blue, and phenol. Here, using MNS as directing agents opens up a new route to realize the oriented assembly and growth of BiOCl nanosheets; this strategy can be adjusted for the synthesis of other catalysts.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000449683100116

Our mission is twofold: (1) find a way to safely inject more charge through platinum electrodes than the Shannon limit (k = 1.75) permits and (2) nurture an interest in the neural stimulation community to understand the electron transfer process occurring on neural stimulating electrodes. Approach. We report here on measurements of the electrode potential, performed on platinum neural stimulating electrodes in the subcutaneous space of an anesthetized rat under neural stimulation conditions. Main results. The results for six platinum electrodes with areas ranging from 0.2 mm(2) to 12.7 mm(2) were similar to prior results in sulfuric acid, except that the measured potentials were shifted negative 0.36 V because of the pH difference between the two media. The anodic 'end' potential, measured at t = 20 ms after the onset of the biphasic current pulse, was the primary focus of the data collected because previous results had shown that as charge injection crosses the Shannon limit (k = 1.75), this potential moves into a range where platinum surface oxidation and dissolution is likely to occur. The behavior of Ve(t = 20 ms) over a range of electrode surface areas studied was consistent with our sulfuric acid study. Implicit, but little noticed, in Shannon's formulation is that small and large platinum electrodes behave the same in terms of k value; our data supports this idea. Significance. We hypothesize that the k = 1.75 Shannon limit for safe stimulation designates a charge-injection boundary above which platinum toxicity becomes a relevant consideration for living cells around an electrode, a possibility that can be directly tested, and is a vital step forward in mission (1).									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			1741-2560	1741-2552		WOS:000407868700001	28813367

Reducing the capital cost of proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers without losing efficiency is one of its most pressing challenges. Gas diffusion layers (GDL), such as felts, foams, meshes and sintered plates, are key stack components, but these are either inefficient or expensive. This study presents a new type of GDL produced via vacuum plasma spraying (VPS), which offers a large potential for cost reduction. With this technology, it is possible to introduce a gradient in the pore-size distribution along the thickness of the GDL by varying the plasma parameters and titanium powder particle sizes. This feature was confirmed by cross-section scanning electron microscopy (SEM). X-ray computed tomography (CT) and mercury intrusion porosimetry allowed determining the porosity, pore radii distribution, and pore entry distribution. Pore radii of ca. 10 mu m could be achieved in the layers of the GDL close to the bipolar plate, while those in contact with the electrodes were in the range of 5 mu m. The thermally sprayed Ti-GDLs allowed achieving PEM electrolyzer performances comparable to those of the state-of-the-art sintered plates and far superior than those of meshes. Moreover, a numerical model showed that the reduced capillary pressure and tortuosity eliminates mass transport limitations at 2 A cm(-2). The results presented herein demonstrate a promising solution to reduce the cost of one of the most expensive components of the stack.									94	0	0	0	0	0	94			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000417255900005

These membranes have an ultrastructure that consists of tightly stacked 'grana' regions interconnected by unstacked membrane regions. The structure of isolated grana membranes has been studied here by cryo-electron microscopy. The data reveals an unusual arrangement of the photosynthetic protein complexes, staggered over two tightly stacked planes. Chaotrope treatment of the paired grana membranes has allowed the separation and isolation of two biochemically distinct membrane fractions. These data have led us to an alternative model of the ultrastructure of the grana where segregation exists within the grana itself. This arrangement would change the existing view of plant photosynthesis. and suggests potential links between cyanobacterial and plant photosystem II light harvesting systems.									21	0	0	0	17	0	21			0014-2956			WOS:000173398100036	11784327

In this investigation, RuO2-Ta2O5 thin films containing between 10 and 90 at.% Ru were prepared by the Pechini-Adams method. These coatings were electrochemically and physically characterized by cyclic voltammetry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The composition and morphology of the oxide were investigated before and after accelerated life tests (ALT) by EDX and SEM. SEM results indicate typical mud-flat-cracking morphology for the majority of the films. High resolution SEMs reveal that pure oxide phases exhibit nanoporosity while binary compositions display a very compact structure. EDX analyses reveal considerable amounts of Ru in the coating even after total deactivation. XRD indicated a rutile-type structure for RuO2 and orthorhombic structure for Ta2O5. XPS data demonstrate that the binding energy of Ta is affected by Ru addition in the thin films, but the binding energy of Ru is not likewise influenced by Ta. The stability of the electrodes was evaluated by ALT performed at 750 mA cm(-2) in 80 degrees C 0.5 mol dm(-3) H2SO4.

This disease is worldwide in occurrence and costs the animal agricultural industry many millions of dollars to control. In recent years, the modern tools of molecular biology, biochemistry, cell biology and immunology have been used to expand greatly our knowledge of these parasites and the disease they cause. Such studies are essential if we are to develop new means for the control of coccidiosis. In this chapter, selective aspects of the biology of these organisms, with emphasis on recent research in poultry, are reviewed. Topics considered include taxonomy, systematics, genetics, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, transfection, oocyst biogenesis, host cell invasion, immunobiology, diagnostics and control.									139	3	0	0	121	3	148			0065-308X	2163-6079	978-0-12-407733-1; 978-0-12-407705-8	WOS:000327397900002	23876872

The extent of intracore M-M interactions is gauged by M-M distances, spin ground state persistence, and preference for mixed-valence states as determined by electrochemical comproportionation constants. Coordination of DMF to the [(L-H)(2)Fe-6] core leads to weaker Fe Fe interactions, as manifested by the observation of ground states populated only at lower temperatures (<100 K) and by the greater evidence of valence trapping within the mixed-valence states. Comproportionation constants determined electrochemically (K-c = 10(4)-10(8)) indicate that the redox series exhibits electronic delocalization (class II-III), yet no intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) bands are observable in the near-IR spectra. Ligation of the stronger sigma donor acetonitrile results in stabilization of spin ground states to higher temperatures (similar to 300 K) and a high degree of valence delocalization (K-c = 10(2)-10(8)) with observable IVCT bands. Finally, the anionic cyanide-bound series reveals the highest degree of valence delocalization with the most intense IVCT bands (K-c = 10(12)-10(20)) and spin ground state population beyond room temperature. Across the series, at a given formal oxidation level, the capping ligand on the hexairon cluster dictates the overall properties of the aggregate, modulating the redox delocalization and the persistence of the intracore coupling of the metal sites.									38	1	0	0	10	0	38			0002-7863			WOS:000360867000044	26231520

In HClO4, the adsorption rate for H adsorption on Ir(111) increases from 1.74x10(-8) mol center dot cm(-2)center dot s(-1) to 3.47x10(-7) mol center dot cm(-2)center dot s(-1) with the decrease of the applied potential from 0.2 V to 0.1 V (vs. RHE), which is ca. one to two orders of magnitude slower than that on Pt(111) under otherwise identical condition. This is explained by the stronger binding of water to Ir(111), which needs a higher barrier to reorient during the under potential deposition of H from hydronium within the hydrogen bonded water network. In H2SO4, the adsorption potential is ca. 200 mV negatively shifted, accompanied by a decrease of adsorption rate by up to one order of magnitude, which is explained by the hindrance of the strongly adsorbed sulfate/bisulfate on Ir(111). Our results demonstrate that under electrochemical environment, H adsorption is strongly affected by the accompanying displacement and reorientation of water molecules that initially stay close to the electrode surface.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1674-0068	2327-2244		WOS:000651442500007

However, these ultrathin sheets usually suffer from a wider bandgap of 3.06 eV, and thus nothing but ultraviolet range absorption. Here, we realized that red CNs has a narrower bandgap of 2.05 eV with a strong band-to-band visiblelight absorption band by fluorination of atomic CNs followed by thermal defluorination (F-DF). Theoretical calculation results indicate that (i) a defect band arises near the conduction band minimum (CBM) after F-DF, resulting in a downward shift of the CBM, and (ii) the band structures are highly associated with the spatial distribution of defects in ultrathin 2D CNs. Furthermore, we confirm that such visible-light absorption band of red CNs can enable the number of photons to harvest a larger portion of solar spectrum, and suppress the rapid recombination of the photogenerated carriers. Consequently, the red CNs-sensitized TiO2 nanorod-based photoanode exhibits an outstanding photoelectrochemical water splitting activity in the visible light range. This work presents a new strategy for using 2D wide-bandgap material of bandgap narrowed to achieve a strong band-to-band visible-light absorption band.									12	0	0	0	2	0	12			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000551969200091

This study aimed to synthesize sodium titanate nanotubes and evaluate the influence of H+ insertion on their photocatalytic properties. Heterojunctions were identified by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and their electronic levels and defects were investigated using diffuse reflectance and photoluminescence spectroscopies in the UV-Vis region. The cation exchange process promotes the formation of Na2Ti3O7/H2Ti3O7 heterojunction with coexistence of both phases in the nanotube. Photocatalytic results of Rhodamine-B (Rh-B) dye discoloration show that the prepared materials have activity under visible and UV light irradiation, and are dependent on the proportion of hydrogen and sodium-titanate phases present. The material with highest sodium concentration showed discoloration with a half-life time of 23 min under visible light irradiation. Theoretical results reveal the heterojunction band offset as a staggered gap, with the effective bandgap occurring between the O-2p of Na2Ti3O7 and Ti-3d of H2Ti3O7. The charge carrier transfer mechanism in the heterojunctions is well described by Z-scheme, with H2Ti3O7 and Na2Ti3O7 as the main oxidation and reduction phases for dye discoloration.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000595142300003

The fabricated photoanode shows drastically enhanced ability to generate H-2 from water splitting under bias-free visible light irradiation. The H-2 production rate of beta-Ni(OH)(2)@CdS NRA photoelectrode reaches 762.5 mu mol h(-1), 8 times as high as that of pure CdS NRA photoelectrode. In addition, the constructed beta-Ni(OH)(2)@CdS shell-core NRA photoanode exhibits an outstanding stability. Mott-Schottky measurements clearly demonstrate that both p-n junction and type-II band alignment are established at beta-Ni(OH)(2) and CdS interface. This unique band structure is highly favorable for the transfer and separation of charge carriers, significantly suppressing charge recombination, as confirmed by photoluminescence emission study. Moreover, the measurements of electrochemical spectroscopy undoubtedly confirm that the lifetime of charge carriers within this unique band structure is significantly prolonged, leading to drastically enhanced photo-electrochemical water splitting for H-2 generation.									22	2	0	0	3	0	22			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000532681500028

The molar ratio of RuCl3 solution and borohydride was optimized to be 1 : 1.5 to produce stable colloids with the optimum final solution pH of 9.7 +/- 0.2. Average diameters of the interconnected nano-chain networks prepared at 30 degrees C (Ru-30), 45 degrees C (Ru-45) and 60 degrees C (Ru-60) were 3.5 + 0.5 nm, 3.0 + 0.2 nm and 2.6 +/- 0.2 nm respectively. The morphology and composition dependent catalytic and electrocatalytic activities of these unprotected Ru nano-chain networks (Ru-30, Ru-45 and Ru-60) were studied in detail. The catalysis study was performed by investigating the transfer hydrogenation of several substituted aromatic nitro compounds. It was observed that Ru-60 was relatively more active compared to Ru-30 and Ru-45, which was reflected in their rate constant values. The electrocatalytic activities of Ru-30, Ru-45 and Ru-60 were screened for anodic water splitting in alkaline medium (0.1 M NaOH) and it was found that all of them showed almost the same activity which required an over-voltage of 308 +/- 2 mV to obtain an anodic current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The catalytic and electrocatalytic performances of these unprotected Ru0 networks were compared with Ru0 nanomaterials prepared under similar conditions with three different surfactants, viz. CTAB, SDS and TX-100, which revealed that unprotected Ru-0 networks are better catalysts than those stabilized with surfactants. The superior catalytic and electrocatalytic performance is due to the availability of unprotected Ru0 surfaces. The present route may provide a new possibility of synthesizing other surfactant-free, unprotected metal colloids for enhanced catalytic and electrocatalytic applications.									83	0	0	0	3	0	83			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000374859300029	29997811

In the last few years numerous molecular approaches have emerged for the identification and characterization of bifidobacterial strains. Their use, in conjunction with traditional culturing methods, has led to a polyphasic taxonomy which has significantly enhanced our knowledge of the role played by these bacteria in the human intestinal ecosystem. The recent adaptation of culture-independent molecular tools to the fingerprinting of intestinal and food communities offers an exciting opportunity for revealing a more detailed picture of the true complexity of these environments. Furthermore, the availability of bifidobacterial genome sequences has advanced knowledge on the genetics of bifidobacteria and the effects of their metabolic activities on the intestinal ecosystem. The release of a complete Bifidobacterium longum genome sequence and the recent initiative to sequence additional strains are expected to open up a new era of comparative genomics in bifidobacterial biology. Moreover, the use of genomotyping allows a global comparative analysis of gene content between different bifidobacterial isolates of a given species without the necessity of sequencing many strains. Genomotyping provides useful information about the degree of relatedness among various strains of Bifidobacterium species and consequently can be used in a polyphasic identification approach. This review will deal mainly with the molecular tools described for bifidobacterial identification and the first insights into the underlying genetics involved in bifidobacterial physiology as well as genome variability.									148	1	0	0	134	0	151			0003-6072	1572-9699		WOS:000225042100001	15539925

Pap, József S/AAA-4098-2021				Behavior of a Cu-Peptide complex under water oxidation conditions - Molecular electrocatalyst or precursor to nanostructured CuO films?								SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS				201						110079	10.1016/j.solmat.2019.110079				OCT 2019	2019	The true electrocatalyst of water oxidation in a number of cases proved to be an in situ developed 'CuO' film instead of (or beside) the original Cu complex itself, since the breaking of metal-ligand interactions under the applied conditions often successfully compete with the homogeneous process. The decomposition of a catalyst candidate is obviously unwanted; on the other hand, inexpensive and controllable precursor complexes represent an exciting platform to fabricate nanostructured metal oxide coatings utilized in artificial photosynthesis. We investigated the Cu-triglycine complex equilibrium system with uniform {N,N,N,O}(eq) peptide binding mode throughout the pH range of similar to 7 to 10 in borate buffer. In the presence of the complex under the conditions of water oxidation electrocatalysis the development of a 'CuO' nanoparticle coating was observed on the indium tin oxide working electrode. This coating acted as a robust electrocatalyst of water oxidation. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicated a mixed Cu2O/CuO/Cu(OH)(2) surface composition. Fine coatings could be also fabricated on different electrodes including glassy carbon, boron-doped diamond and an n-type semiconducting alpha-Fe2O3 nanoarray, importantly, without ruining its morphology. We identified the interplay between the coexistent borate equilibrium species and the Cu-triglycine system as the key factor to define the dominant process and allow control over the deposition.

The solid state decomposition temperatures of MnTp(2) and CoTp(2) are similar to 370 and similar to 340 degrees C, respectively. Preparative-scale sublimations of MnTp(2) and CoTp(2) at 210 degrees C/0.05 Torr afforded >99% recoveries with <0.1% nonvolatile residues. Self-limited ALD growth was demonstrated at 325 degrees C for MnTp(2) or CoTp(2) with ozone as the coreactant. The growth rate for the manganese borate process was 0.19 angstrom/cycle within the ALD window of 300-350 degrees C. The growth rate for the cobalt borate process was 0.39-0.42 angstrom/cycle at 325 degrees C. X-ray diffraction of the as-deposited films indicated that they were amorphous. Atomic force microscopy of 35-36 nm thick manganese borate films grown within the 300-350 degrees C ALD window showed root mean square surface roughnesses of 0.4-0.6 nm. Film stoichiometries were assessed by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and time of flight-elastic recoil detection analysis. The differing film stoichiometries obtained from the very similar precursors MnTp(2) and CoTp(2) are proposed to arise from the oxidizing ability of the intermediate high valent manganese oxide layers and lack thereof for cobalt.

The electrocatalytic activity of coating anodes was investigated by electrochemical measurements including cyclic voltammetry, anodic polarization curve and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray detector (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The life time of the electrode prepared at 460 degrees C was attained by accelerated electrolysis test. The results showed that the TiN peak could be detected on XRD pattern in the preparing temperatures range from 420 degrees C to 540 degrees C, but decomposed at 560 degrees C. It is showed that the preparing temperature had a significant effect on its morphology and electrocatalytic activity. The life time of TiN based IrO2-Ta2O5 with high electrocatalytic activity is superior to that of the traditional Ti based IrO2-Ta2O5 coating anode. It is feasible to use TiN as the carrier for IrO2-Ta2O5 coating anode.									5	13	0	0	0	0	16			1002-185X			WOS:000244993600036

A photocatalyst-adsorbent system made up of Ag3PO4 and halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) was synthesized by precipitating Ag3PO4 in the presence of dispersed HNTs. The synthesized Ag3PO4-HNTs were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The as-prepared Ag3PO4-HNTs showed high photocatalytic activity in visible light and high efficiency of adsorption for water-soluble dyes, such as methylene blue and rhodamine B, and pharmaceutical chemicals, such as diclofenac sodium, ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, naproxen sodium, and carbamazepine. The efficiency of the photocatalytic activity and the adsorption capacity of Ag3PO4-HNTs were dependent on the percentage of HNTs in the photocatalytic-adsorbent material of Ag3PO4-HNTs. The intermediate products for the photodegradation of ibuprofen and naproxen sodium were identified with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The synthesized Ag3PO4-HNT composites showed good potential application in the treatment of polluted water. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

J	Ren, Jie; Lv, Zhengxiang; Wang, Honghui; Wu, Jianmeng; Zhang, Shunli								The Origin of Quartz Cement in the Upper Triassic Second Member of the Xujiahe Formation Sandstones, Western Sichuan Basin, China								WATER				13	14					1890	10.3390/w13141890				JUL 2021	2021	High-precision in situ delta O-18 values obtained using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) for mu m-size quartz cement are applied to constrain the origin of the silica in the deep-buried Upper Triassic second member of Xujiahe Formation tight sandstones, western Sichuan Basin, China. Petrographic, cathodoluminescence (CL), and fluid inclusion data from the quartz cements in the Xu2 sandstones indicate three distinct, separate quartz precipitation phases (referred to as Q1, Q2, and Q3). The Q1 quartz cement was formed at temperatures of approximately 56-85 degrees C and attained the highest delta O-18 values (ranging from 18.3 to 19.05 parts per thousand Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW)). The Q2 quartz cement was generated at temperatures of approximately 90-125 degrees C, accompanying the main phase of hydrocarbon fluid inclusions, with the highest Al2O3 content and high delta O-18 values (ranging from 15 to 17.99 parts per thousand VSMOW). The Q3 quartz cement was formed at temperatures of approximately 130-175 degrees C, with the lowest delta O-18 values (ranging from 12.79 to 15.47 parts per thousand VSMOW). A portion of the Q2 and Q3 quartz cement has a relatively high K2O content. The dissolution of feldspar and volcanic rock fragments was likely the most important source of silica for the Q1 quartz cement. The variations in delta O-18((water)) and trace element composition from the Q2 quartz cement to the Q3 quartz cement suggest that hydrocarbon emplacement and water-rock interactions greatly altered the chemistry of the pore fluid. Feldspar dissolution by organic acids, clay mineral reactions (illitization and chloritization of smectite), and pressure dissolution were the main sources of silica for the Q2 and Q3 quartz cements, while transformation of the clay minerals in the external shale unit was a limited silica source.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2073-4441		WOS:000677066100001

Inclusions have negative crystal shapes, sizes from 2 to 10 mu m and are regularly distributed in the core of the garnet. Microstructural and micro-Raman investigations indicate the presence of two types of inclusions: crystallized silicate melt inclusions (i.e., nanogranitoids, NI), and fluid inclusions (FI). Microstructural evidence suggests that FI and NI coexist in the same cluster and are primary (i.e., were trapped simultaneously during garnet growth). FI have similar compositions in the three zones and comprise variable proportions of CO2, CH4, and N-2, commonly with siderite, pyrophyllite, and kaolinite, suggesting a COHN composition of the trapped fluid. The mineral assemblage in the NI contains K-feldspar, plagioclase, quartz, biotite, muscovite, chlorite, graphite and, rarely, calcite. Polymorphs such as kumdykolite, cristobalite, tridymite, and less commonly kokchetavite, were also found. Rehomogenized NI from the different zones show that all the melts are leucogranitic but have slightly different compositions. In samples from the upper amphibolite facies, melts are less mafic (FeO + MgO = 2.0-3.4 wt%), contain 860-1700 ppm CO2 and reach the highest H2O contents (6.5-10 wt%). In the transition zone melts have intermediate H2O (4.8-8.5 wt%), CO2 (457-1534 ppm) and maficity (FeO + MgO = 2.3-3.9 wt%). In contrast, melts at granulite facies reach highest CaO, FeO + MgO (3.2-4.7 wt%), and CO2 (up to 2,400 ppm), with H2O contents comparable (5.4-8.3 wt%) to the other two zones. Our results represent the first clear evidence for carbonic fluid-present melting in the Ivrea Zone. Anatexis of metapelites occurred through muscovite and biotite breakdown melting in the presence of a COH fluid, in a situation of fluid-melt immiscibility. The fluid is assumed to have been internally derived, produced initially by devolatilization of hydrous silicates in the graphitic protolith, then as a result of oxidation of carbon by consumption of Fe3+-bearing biotite during melting. Variations in the compositions of the melts are interpreted to result from higher T of melting. The H2O contents of the melts throughout the three zones are higher than usually assumed for initial H2O contents of anatectic melts. The CO2 contents are highest at granulite facies, and show that carbon-contents of crustal magmas are not negligible at high T. The activity of H2O of the fluid dissolved in granitic melts decreases with increasing metamorphic grade. Carbonic fluid-present melting of the deep continental crust represents, together with hydrate-breakdown melting reactions, an important process in the origin of crustal anatectic granitoids.					5th Granulites and Granulites Meeting5th Granulites and Granulites Meeting	JUL, 2018JUL, 2018		Ullapool, SCOTLANDUllapool, SCOTLAND	26	1	0	0	1	0	26			0263-4929	1525-1314		WOS:000479310300005

Growth studies and 16S rRNA gene-targeted analyses suggested culture purity; however, the careful quantitative analysis of Dehalococcoides 16S rRNA gene and chloroethene reductive dehalogenase gene (i.e., vcrA, treA, and bvcA) copy numbers revealed that the culture consisted of multiple, distinct Dehalococcoides organisms. Subsequent transfers, along with quantitative PCR monitoring, yielded isolate GT, possessing only vcrA. These findings suggest that commonly used qualitative 16S rRNA gene-based procedures are insufficient to verify purity of Dehalococcoides cultures. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that strain GT is affiliated with the Pinellas group of the Dehalococcoides cluster and shares 100% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity with two other Dehalococcoides isolates, strain FL2 and strain CBDB1. The new isolate is distinct, as it respires the priority pollutants TCE, cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cis-DCE), 1,1-dichloroethene (1,1-DCE), and vinyl chloride (VC), thereby producing innocuous ethene and inorganic chloride. Strain GT dechlorinated TCE, cis-DCE, 1,1-DCE, and VC to ethene at rates up to 40, 41, 62, and 127 mu mol liter(-1) day(-1), respectively, but failed to dechlorinate PCE. Hydrogen was the required electron donor, which was depleted to a consumption threshold concentration of 0.76 +/- 0.13 nM with VC as the electron acceptor. In contrast to the known TCE dechlorinating isolates, strain GT dechlorinated TCE to ethene with very little formation of chlorinated intermediates, suggesting that this type of organism avoids the commonly observed accumulation of cis-DCE and VC during TCE-to-ethene dechlorination.									204	3	0	0	190	0	210			0099-2240	1098-5336		WOS:000236069200032	16517646

The concentrations of NaCl and KCI used were 100 mmol/L to 300 mmol/L and the concentration of CaCl2 was 5 mmol/L. Na2SO4 and K2SO4 used were in the range of 50 to 200 mmol/L. Salt treatments were given to 6 d old seedlings and Chi a measurements were taken subsequently for 3 d after the salt treatment.The fast Chl a fluorescence kinetics of mung bean and Brassica seedlings showed no significant change within 3 d of experiments without the addition of salts/ions. The salt/ion treatments significantly affected the Chl a fluorescence kinetics, The initial Chi a fluorescence level (F-0) increased after 3 d with NaCl, which was enhanced by the addition of CaCl2. KCI and Na2SO4 or K2SO4 Induced an increase in F-0 after 1 d of salt treatments, CaCl2 alone and with NaCl or KCl enhanced F-M after 1 d of treatment. KCl alone increased F-M values after 1 d. However, the maximum Chl a fluorescence level (F-M), quantum yield of the primary photochemistry of PS II (phi (Po)), quantum yield of electron transport beyond Q(A)- (phi (Eo)), efficiency that a trapped electron can move further ahead Of Q(A)- (psi (o)) and flux ratio of electron transport (E-To/RC) decreased significantly with NaCl treatments after 3 d of treatment. CaCl2 ameliorated these effects. ABS/RC and DI0/RC was enhanced several folds by NaCl treatments and CaCl2 augmented these effects. Other salts and their combinations also showed enhancement in DI0/RC. However, Na salts showed amplified effects at equimolar concentrations compared to K salts. The most prominent difference In the susceptibility of a system or genotype to different salts or ions is due to the changes of the abundance of active reaction centers per leaf cross-section (RC0/CS0).									110	15	0	0	107	7	130			0176-1617	1618-1328		WOS:000171231300009

The electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) studies reveal the little charge transfer resistance for the modified electrode. The electrocatalytic activity of the modified electrode for the oxidation of AA was investigated. The current sensitivity of AA was enhanced to about five times upon modification. The voltammetric response of AA was well resolved from the responses of DA and UA, and the oxidation potential of AA was negatively shifted to 0.20 V. The biosensor tolerated a wide linear concentration range for AA, from 1.0 x 10(-5) M to 2.63 x 10(-3) M (R-2=0.9929), with a detection limit of 0.5 pl (S/N=3). Our results demonstrate that the NiCoO2/C nanomaterials has excellent AA sensing capability, including a fast response time, high reproducibility and stability, with great promise in the quantification of AA in real samples. That makes it a unique electrochemical sensor for the detection of AA which is free from the interference of DA, UA and other interferents. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	GAU, AE; THOLE, HH; PISTORIUS, EK								ISOLATION AND PARTIAL CHARACTERIZATION OF A MANGANESE REQUIRING L-ARGININE METABOLIZING ENZYME BEING PRESENT IN PHOTOSYSTEM-II COMPLEXES OF SPINACH AND TOBACCO								ZEITSCHRIFT FUR NATURFORSCHUNG C-A JOURNAL OF BIOSCIENCES				50	9-10			638	651						SEP-OCT 1995	1995	A low L-arginine metabolizing enzyme (L-AME) activity leading to ornithine, urea and additional products not identified so far could be detected in photosystem II (PS II) membranes of spinach and of the chlorophyll deficient tobacco mutant Su/su. The detectable L-AME activity was very low in untreated PS II membranes, but increased significantly (about 10 fold) when the extrinsic peptides (psbO, P and Q gene products) were removed suggesting that the L-AME is exposed at the lumen side of PS II. It was possible to isolate the detergent-solubilized protein from CaCl2-washed PS II membranes of spinach by a combination of anion and cation exchange columns. On the basis of SDS PAGE the protein was homogenous and had an apparent molecular mass of 7 kDa. N-terminal sequencing of the polypeptide gave a contiguous sequence of 20 amino acids showing no homologies to PS II polypeptides as yet sequenced. After chromatography of the L-AME on an anion exchange column at pH 9.5 (last purification step) a completely inactive enzyme was obtained. Maximal reactivation was achieved by dialyzing the protein against Hepes-NaOH buffer in the pH range of 6.5 to 7.5 containing 100 mM chloride or sulfate (being the most effective anions). The L-AME activity was totally dependent on manganese added to the reaction mixture. Moreover, there were indications of a second cation binding site being more sequestered and requiring bound Ca2+ or Mn2+ for activity (Sr2+ was less effective and Mg2+ was ineffective). There are indications that the protein contains a redox active group - possibly an aminoacid-derived quinonoid (based on a redox cycling assay with glycine and nitroblue tetrazolium). The capability of this PS II associated protein to bind the cofactors of water oxidation and having a redox active group (preliminary results) suggests that this protein might be functional in photosynthetic water oxidation. This is further supported by the fact that the isolated L-AME has a low catalase activity.									9	0	0		7	0	10			0939-5075			WOS:A1995TD77200007

The genome of Neisseria gonorrhoeae contains one gene encoding KDOP synthase and one gene encoding DAHP synthase, Of the two nonhomologous DAHP synthase families known, the N. gonorrhoeae protein belongs to the family I assemblage. KDOP synthase exhibited an ability to replace arabinose-5-P with either erythrose-4-P or ribose-5-P as alternative substrates. The results of periodate oxidation studies suggested that the product formed by KDOP synthase with erythrose-4-P as the substrate was 3-deoxy-D-ribo-heptulosonate 7-P, an isomer of DAHP, As expected, this product was not utilized as a substrate by dehydroquinate synthase, The significance of the ability of KDOP synthase to substitute erythrose-4-P for arabinose-5-P is (i) recognition of the possibility that the KDOP synthase might otherwise be mistaken for a species of DAHP synthase and (ii) the possibility that the broad-specificity type of KDOP synthase might be a relatively vulnerable target for antimicrobial agents which mimic the normal substrates, An analysis of sequences in the database indicates that the family I group of DAHP synthase has a previously unrecognized membership which includes the KDOP synthases, The KDOP synthases fall into a subfamily grouping which includes a small group of DAHP synthases. Thus, family I DAHP synthases separate into two subfamilies, one of which includes the KDOP synthases. The two subfamilies appear to have diverged prior to the acquisition of allosteric-control mechanisms for DAHP synthases, These allosteric control specificities are highly diverse and correlate with the presence of N-terminal extensions which lack homology with one another.									63	0	0	0	52	0	66			0021-9193	1098-5530		WOS:000071362400017	9422601	
J	Cohen, JG; Briley, MM; Stetson, PB								Carbon and nitrogen abundances in stars at the base of the red giant branch in M5								ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL				123	5			2525	2540		10.1086/340179				MAY 2002	2002	We present an analysis of a large sample of moderate resolution Keck LRIS spectra of subgiant (V similar to 17.2) and fainter stars in the Galactic globular cluster M5 (NGC 5904) with the goal of deriving C and N abundances. Star-to-star stochastic variations with significant range in both [C/Fe] and [N/Fe] are found at all luminosities extending to the bottom of the red giant branch at M-V similar to +3. Similar variations in CH appear to be present in the main-sequence turnoff spectra, but the signal in the current sample is too low for a detailed analysis. The variations seen among the M5 subgiants are consistent with the abundances found earlier by Briley et al. for brighter giants in this cluster. There is thus no sign of a change in the behavior of C and N with evolutionary stage over the full range in luminosity of the red giant and subgiant branches, although a systematic decrease with luminosity in the mean [C/H] smaller than a factor of 2 cannot be ruled out with confidence at present. The C and N abundances appear strongly anticorrelated, as would be expected from the CN-cycle processing of stellar material. Yet the present stars are considerably fainter than the red giant branch bump, the point at which deep mixing is believed to set in. On this basis, while the observed abundance pattern is consistent with proton capture nucleosynthesis, we infer that the site of the reactions is likely not within the present sample, but rather in a population of more massive (2-5 M-.), now-defunct stars. The range of variation of the N abundances is very large, and the sum of C+ N increases as C decreases. To reproduce this requires the incorporation not only of CN but also of ON-processed material. Furthermore, the existence of this correlation is quite difficult to reproduce with an external mechanism such as pollution with material processed in a more massive asymptotic giant branch star, which mechanism is fundamentally stochastic in nature. We therefore suggest that although the internal mixing hypothesis has serious flaws, new theoretical insights are needed and it should not yet be ruled out.									92	0	0	0	0	0	92			0004-6256			WOS:000175311200025

Herein, we confirmed, for the first time, that the fine modulation on semiconducting TiO2 was able to improve the redox-cycling capability for heterogeneous peroxydisulfate (PDS, S2O82-) activation and radicals generation. PDS activation by defective TiO2- x exposed by high-energy {0 0 1} polar facets was a superior Fenton-like catalytic system for rhodamine B (RhB) and bisphenol A (BPA) degradation, with good activity and selectivity under neutral pH. By radical inhibiting tests with two different scavengers, fluorescence measurements with terephthalic acid and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique, only the SO4 center dot- was identified to be the main reactive species from PDS activation on defective TiO2-x for pollutants degradation. Compared to the reported TiO2-x/H2O2 system, the proposed TiO2-x/PDS system exhibited much lower water matrix effects in the presence of four typical anions, natural organic matters and real surface water for target pollutants degradation. The selective SO4 center dot--mediated TiO2-x/PDS catalytic system in natural water matrix and the no toxicity of catalytic material were of considerable interest for practical environmental applications with highly complex chemistry. Our findings elucidated a new strategy for efficient and selective PDS activation based on the defect-related chemistry, which can degrade environmental contaminants and remedy contaminated soil based on sulfate components with much reduced matrix effects.									9	0	0	0	6	0	9			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000450105700024

The full length cDNA of heat shock transcriptional factor 1 (HdHSF1), heat shock factor binding protein 1(HSBP1), and heat shock protein 90 (HdHSP90) are 1548 bp, 809 bp, and 2592 bp respectively, encoding a protein of 515 aa, 75 aa, and 728 aa respectively. Real time quantitative PCR analysis revealed that these three genes are constitutively expressed in 7 selected tissues. The expression level of HdHSF1 in gills was higher than that in other tissues (p < 0.05). The highest expression level of HdHSBP1 was detected in hemocytes. The highest expression level of HdHSP90 was in the digestive tract and colleterial gland. The HdHSF1 expression level in the gills was up-regulated significantly (p < 0.05) after thermal stress and hypoxia exposure respectively. On the contrary, HdHSBP1 was down-regulated both in gills and hemocytes after thermal stress and the same as in gills after hypoxia stress. HdHSP90 expression level was also up-regulated in gills and hemocytes after both thermal and hypoxia stresses. These results indicated that these three heat shock responsive genes play important roles in response to thermal and hypoxia stress. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, titanium (Ti) was selectively doped into the bottom and/or top layer of the double layered hematite (alpha-Fe2O3/alpha-Fe2O3) nanorod arrays grown on conducive transparent substrate (F:SnO2, FTO) via a two-step hydrothermal method to optimize the electron donor distribution and improve the charge separation efficiency for a remarkable enhancement in PEC water splitting. It was demonstrated that, by selectively doping Ti into the bottom layer, the obtained FTO/alpha-Fe2O3:Ti/alpha-Fe2O3 nanorod photoanode showed the highest PEC performance for water splitting, with photocurrent density reaching 1.69 mA/cm(2) at 1.9 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5G illumination, which was 4.3 times that of undoped alpha-Fe2O3/alpha-Fe2O3 nanorod film (0.39 mA/cm(2)) and even much higher than the top layer and double layer doped alpha-Fe2O3 nanorod films (FTO/alpha-Fe2O3/alpha-Fe2O3:Ti and FTO/Fe2O3:Ti/alpha-Fe2O3:Ti/alpha-Fe2O3:Ti). By introducing the Ti electron donor dopants into alpha-Fe2O3, the electron density will be increased in the alpha-Fe2O3:Ti layer, raising the Fermi level. For the FTO/Fe2O3:Ti/alpha-Fe2O3 nanorod film, the band realignment will create a terraced band structure and then build an internal electric field at the interface of the bottom and top layers. As a result, the photoexcited electrons and holes will transfer to the FTO substrate and the photoanode surface, respectively, as driven by the internal electric field. This study demonstrated an alternative approach to the design of novel photoanodes with improved PEC performances, by engineering the electron density distribution and the band structure for efficient charge carrier separation.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000471748100035

Barium stars are moderately rare, chemically peculiar objects, which are believed to be the result of the pollution of an otherwise normal star by material from an evolved companion on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB).Aims. We aim to derive carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine abundances for the first time from the infrared spectra of the barium red giant star HD 123396 to quantitatively test AGB nucleosynthesis models for producing barium stars via mass accretion.Methods. High-resolution and high S/N infrared spectra were obtained using the Phoenix spectrograph mounted at the Gemini South telescope. The abundances were obtained through spectrum synthesis of individual atomic and molecular lines, using the MOOG stellar line analysis program, together with Kurucz's stellar atmosphere models. The analysis was classical, using 1D stellar models and spectral synthesis under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium.Results. We confirm that HD 123396 is a metal-deficient barium star ([Fe/H] = -1.05), with A(C) = 7.88, A(N) = 6.65, A(O) = 7.93, and A(Na) = 5.28 on a logarithmic scale where A(H) = 12, leading to [(C+N)/Fe] approximate to 0.5. The A(CNO) group, as well as the A(Na) abundances, is in excellent agreement with those previously derived for this star using high-resolution optical data. We also found A(F) = 4.16, which implies [F/O] = 0.39, a value that is substantially higher than the F abundances measured in globular clusters of a similar metallicity, noting that there are no F measurements in field stars of comparable metallicity.Conclusions. The observed abundance pattern of the light elements (CNO, F, and Na) recovered here as well as the heavy elements (s-process) studied elsewhere suggest that the surface composition of HD 123396 is well fitted by the predicted abundance pattern of a 1.5 M-circle dot AGB model star with Z = 0.001. Thus, the AGB mass transfer hypothesis offers a quantitatively viable framework.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0004-6361			WOS:000298485100083

In addition to previously published maps at lower resolution [Boekema, E.J., Hankamer, B., Bald, D., Kruip, J., Nield, J., Boonstra, A.F., Barber, J. & Rogner, M. (1995) Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 92, 175-179], the new side-view projections show densities of all three lumenal extrinsic proteins, i.e. the 33-kDa, 12-kDa and the cytochrome c-550 subunit encoded by psbO, psbU and psbV, respectively. Analysis of the size and shape of the top-view projections revealed a small number of photosystem II particles of about double the size of the usual dimers. Size and quantity of these 'double dimers' correlates with a small fraction of 1000-kDa particles found with HPLC-size-exclusion chromatographic analysis. Because many cyanobacteria contain dimeric photosystem II complexes arranged in rows within the membrane, the double dimers can be considered as the breakdown fragments of these rows. Their analysis enabled the detection of the arrangement of photosystem II within the rows, in which the dimers interact with other dimers mostly with their tips, leaving a rather open center at the interfaces of two dimers. The dimers have a repeating distance of only 11.7 nm. As a consequence, the phycobilisomes, located on Lop of PSII and functioning in light-harvesting, must be closely packed or almost touch each other, in a manner similar to a recently suggested model [Bald, D., Kruip, J. & Rogner, M.(1996) Photosynthesis Res. 49, 103-118].									34	0	0	0	31	0	34			0014-2956			WOS:000084444000015	10561585

The gene encoding Fas ligand was isolated from a disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus) cDNA library, denoted as the Was ligand. It contains an 1832 bp transcript with a 945 bp open reading frame, encoding 315 amino acids. The Was ligand showed characteristic transmembrane and TNF family signature domains. The deduced amino acid comparison showed that the Was ligand exhibits 22.0, 16.1 and 14.5% identities to human Fas ligand, TNIF-alpha, and lymphotoxin (LT-alpha), respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the AbFas ligand belongs to the invertebrate TNF family and it is closely related to vertebrate Fas ligand counterparts. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis results showed that the Was ligand transcripts were constitutively expressed in abalone hemocytes, gills, mantle, muscle, digestive tract and digestive gland in a tissue-specific manner. By immune stimulation, Was ligand mRNA was significantly (p < 0.05) up-regulated after infection with a mixture of bacteria (Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio parahemolyticus, and Listeria monocytogenes), viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in abalone gills. The recombinant Was ligand was over-expressed in Escherichia coli (E coli) and purified using a pMAL protein fusion system. This recombinant AbFas ligand showed its biological activity by inducing both superoxide anion (O-2(-)) and H2O2 in human THP-1 cells in concentration-depend ant manner. Correlating the Was ligand transcriptional up-regulation against bacteria, virus and LPS with the biological activity of its recombinant protein, we could suggest that the abalone Fas ligand may control microbial infection by inducing O-2(-), H2O2 and other ROS.

The complete open reading frames (ORFs) of Cu/Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD were identified from Mytilus coruscus (designated as McSOD and MnSOD) by homologous cloning. The sequence lengths were 474bp and 687bp, encoding 157 and 228 amino acids respectively. The deduced amino acid sequences of McSOD and MnSOD shared high identities with Cu/Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD from other mollusca. The distributions of McSOD and MnSOD were detected in six tissues including adductor, hemocyte, gill, gonad, mantle and hepatopancreas, and the highest expressions were both in gills. The temporal expression of McSOD and MnSOD were up-regulated in gills under a variety of stress factors, including Vibrio parahemolyticus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Cu2+ and Pb2+. After being challenged with V. Parahemolyticus, the expressions of McSOD and MnSOD were increased rapidly at the initial hours, reaching the peaks of 4.9-fold and 15.3-fold respectively, and got to the highest levels of 43.5-fold and 7.1-fold after being challenged with A. hydrophila. The highest point of McSOD mRNA appeared at 15 d after being exposed to copper (7-fold at 0.5 mg/L and 13.2-fold at 1.5 mg/L), except for 0.1 mg/L group of Cu2+ maintaining to the normal level, but plumbum at 1 d (2.4-fold at 1.0 mg/L and 4.4-fold at 3.0 mg/L) and at 15 d (2.1-fold at 0.2 mg/L). The temporal expression peaks of MnSOD appeared differently after exposing to copper of various concentrations (0.1 mg/L at 10 d with 4.7-fold, 0.5 mg/L at 1 d with 17.9 fold and 1.5 mg/L at 3 d with 13.2-fold). Whereas in plumbum exposing treatments, the 3.0 mg/L group jumped to the peak at 1 d (18.2-fold), the 0.2 mg/L and 1.0 mg/L groups had little change and maintained at the normal level throughout the experiment. The results provided several new evidences for further understanding of the regulatory mechanism of SOD on the innate immune system in bivalve. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Buchmann, Kurt					Buchmann, Kurt/0000-0002-2747-237X			Neutrophils and aquatic pathogens								PARASITE IMMUNOLOGY				44	6	SI				e12915	10.1111/pim.12915		MAR 2022		JUN 2022	2022	Introduction Neutrophilic granulocytes are short-lived cells continuously circulating in the vascular system of vertebrates. They play a basic and decisive role in the innate immune defence of the hosts against all types of pathogenic microorganisms. Methods Based on a literature study, the functions of neutrophils and cells with similar functions are described. The study places special emphasis on organisms in the aquatic environment and the pathogens occurring in that particular environment. Results The evolutionary origin of this specific cell type is not clear, but its most basic traits (recognition of foreign elements, extracellular trap release, phagocytosis and elimination of ingested material) are found in phagocytes in members of evolutionary ancient invertebrate groups spanning from amoebae, sponges, sea-anemones, mollusks (snails and mussels), arthropods (crustaceans and insects) to echinoderms (sea stars and sea urchins). Their functions as innate immune sentinels and effector cells in these groups are well described. Neutrophilic granulocytes with elongated and lobed nuclei (possibly allowing cell movements through narrow extracellular spaces and leaving space for phagosomes) occur in vertebrates including fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals although the morphology of the nucleus, stainability of cytoplasmic granula, and the antimicrobial armament vary among groups. Following the pathogen invasion of a fish host, the neutrophils migrates from the vascular system into the infection focus. They apply their PRRs (including TLRs) to recognize the invader as non-self, produce netosis by casting extracellular chromatin containing traps in the microenvironment. These nets assist the immobilization of invading microbes and prevents their further spread. The cells attach to and engulf the microbes by phagocytosis, whereafter they eliminate the pathogen in phagolysosomes equipped with a range of killing mechanisms and attract, by release of chemokines, additional immune cells (monocytes, macrophages and lymphocytes) to the site of invasion. Their role in innate immunity of fish hosts towards aquatic pathogens has been elucidated by in vivo and in vitro studies. Neutrophils interact with virus (e.g. IPNV and VHSV), bacteria (e.g. Aeromonas, Vibrio, Edwardsiella, Mycobacterium and Renibacterium) and parasites, including monogeneans (Gyrodactylus), cestodes (Diphyllobothrium), trematodes (Diplostomum) and ciliates (Ichthyophthirius and Philasterides). Despite the decisive function of neutrophils in innate immunity and early protection, the excessive production of ROS, RNS and NETs may lead to pathological disturbances in the host, which are exacerbated if the pathogens evolve immune evasion mechanisms. Conclusion Neutrophils in aquatic organisms play a central role in innate immunity but may serve as a toll and a support in acquired protection. The strong impact of the cellular reactions not only on pathogen but also on host tissues emphasizes that an optimal immune reaction is balanced, involves targeted and specific effector mechanisms, which leaves a minimum of collateral damage in host organs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0141-9838	1365-3024		WOS:000771722500001	35290688	
J	MEYER, S; DEKOUCHKOVSKY, Y								ELECTRON-TRANSPORT, PHOTOSYSTEM-2 REACTION CENTERS AND CHLOROPHYLL-PROTEIN COMPLEXES OF THYLAKOIDS OF DROUGHT RESISTANT AND SENSITIVE LUPIN PLANTS								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				37	1			49	60		10.1007/BF02185438				JUL 1993	1993	Two genotypes of Lupinus albus L., resistant and susceptible to drought, were subjected to water deficiency for up to two weeks. Such treatment progressively lowered the leaf water content from about 85% to about 60% (water potential from -0.8 to -4.3 MPa). Light-saturation curves of the uncoupled electron transport were analyzed according to a simple kinetic model of separated or connected reversible photoreactions. It gives an extrapolated maximum rate (V(max)) and the efficiency for capturing light (I(m), which is the light intensity at V(max)/2). For Photosystem 2, V(max) and, less markedly, I(m), declined with increasing severity of drought treatment; the artificial donor, diphenylcarbazide, could not restore the activity. One cause of this Photosystem 2 inhibition could be the loss of active Photosystem 2 centers. Indeed, their concentration relative to chlorophyll, estimated by flash-induced reduction of dimethylquinone, was halved by a medium stress. To the extent that it was still not restored by diphenylcarbazide, the site of Photosystem 2 inactivation must have been close to the photochemical trap, after water oxidation and before or at plastoquinone pool. By relating electron transport rate to active centers instead of chlorophyll, no inhibition by drought was detected. Therefore, water stress inactivates specifically Photosystem 2, without impairing a downhill thermal step of electron transport. On the other hand, the decrease of I(m) suggests that antennae connected to inactive centers may transfer their excitation energy to active neighbors, which implies that antenna network remains essentially intact. Gel electrophoresis confirmed that the apoproteins of the pigment complexes were well conserved. In conclusion, the inactivation of Photosystem 2 may not be a physical loss of its centers and core antennae but probably reflects protein alterations or conformational changes. These may result from the massive decrease of lipids induced by drought (Meyer et al. 1992, Photosynth. Res. 32: 95-107). Both lupin genotypes behaved similarly but, for a same deficiency, the resistant seemed unexpectedly more sensitive to drought.									20	6	0	0	19	0	25			0166-8595			WOS:A1993LT14100004	24317653	
J	Peng Peng; Liu Hongtao; Wu Bin; Tang Qingxin; Liu Yunqi								Nitrogen Doped Graphene with a p-Type Field-Effect and Its Fine Modulation								ACTA PHYSICO-CHIMICA SINICA				35	11			1282	1290		10.3866/PKU.WHXB201903002				2019	2019	Functionalized graphene has attracted significant interest over the past decade due to its unique physical properties and potential applications. Graphene oxide (GO), a readily scaled-up product, is a basic material for further functionalization. Using reductive processes, highly conductive reduced graphene oxide (RGO) can be obtained, which exhibits electrical and optical properties analogous to those of graphene. Moreover, due to the presence of oxygen-containing functional groups, its chemical reactivity and electronic properties can be easily tailored by chemical doping with nitrogen. However, developing strategies for doping graphene is challenging and the fundamental roles of the doping atom configuration and its environment on the resulting properties of graphene remain poorly understood. These properties are important for electrical and catalytic applications of graphene. Thus, synthesizing specific configurations of nitrogen-doped graphene and consequently investigating the electrical and catalytic properties of the product is imperative. Herein, we demonstrate an approach that allows for successful production of nitrogen-functionalized RGO using Schiff base condensation between the amino groups in an o-aryl diamine compound and the carbonyl groups in GO. Three typical nitrogen-containing species including o-phenylenediamine (OPD), 2,3-diaminopyridine (23DAP), and bis(trifluoromethyl)-1,2-diaminobenzene (BTFMDAB) were used for functionalizing the GO samples, and the corresponding RGO derivatives (OPD-RGO, 23DAP-RGO, and BTF-RGO) were obtained by thermal annealing. Pyrazine nitrogen was successfully introduced into graphitic framework, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), Raman, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Field-effect transistors (FETs) based on the BTF-RGO exhibited hole-dominated ambipolar field-effect behavior with a Dirac point at a 9 V gate voltage and hole mobilities up to 2.5 times that of RGO. The weak p-type doping effect originated from the strongly electron-withdrawing trifluoromethyl groups. By studying the OPD-RGO and 23DAP-RGO-based FETs, containing pyrazine nitrogen and mixed pyrazine/pyridine nitrogen, respectively, we found that pyrazine nitrogen provided weak n-type doping effects, while pyridine nitrogen exhibited weak p-type doping effects due to its electron-withdrawing ability. Enhanced p-type doping effect was accompanied by the introduction of groups with stronger electron-withdrawing ability into the graphitic framework. Impressively, pyridine nitrogen in the pyrazine nitrogen-doped RGO yielded a weak p-type doped graphene due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the pyridine nitrogen. Nitrogen-doped graphene can be finely tuned from weak n-type to weak p-type doping by adjusting the electron-withdrawing ability of o-aryl diamine compounds. This study demonstrates the effect of nitrogen configuration and its surrounding environment on the electrical properties of RGOs, providing additional possible applications.									6	2	0	0	0	0	7			1000-6818			WOS:000484803300019

The compositional variability in large igneous provinces has mainly been attributed to changes in the melting regime and shallow crustal processes and commonly ranges from depleted tholeiitic basaltic to enriched alkaline lavas. Large igneous provinces erupted in the submarine environment however, may also experience intense hydrothermal alteration during their formation resulting from an increased exchange between seawater and the erupting lavas during their eruptive history. The submarine Azores Plateau in the Central Northern Atlantic has generally been treated to represent such large igneous province formed since similar to 10 Ma by widespread volcanism and the unique tectonic regime which results in large fault systems exposing the erupted lavas. Here, we present new seismic, petrological and major element, trace element and isotope geochemical data from a similar to 1000 m stratigraphic section of submarine lavas exposed at the western Princessa Alice bank. The 22 samples recovered from the near-vertical rift wall provide evidence for intense water-rock exchange not observed anywhere in oceanic crust sampled to date. Fluid-immobile incompatible trace elements show that the samples formed from higher degrees of partial melting of a mantle source that is less enriched than the source that gives rise to the islands today. The extents of melting today are very small, implying a change in melting regime since initial formation of the Princessa Alice Plateau basalts that correspond to a melting anomaly in the Azores. Our observations indicate that the extreme levels of alteration may result from a combination of intensified magmatic activity during initial formation of the Azores Plateau and the tectonic regime providing pathways for the fluids. Our results impact on the interpretation of shallow level crustal magmatic processes, in which the contribution of crustal sources to the ascending melt may be different to what had previously been suggested. We propose that hydrothermal alteration during submarine igneous plateau forming events can drastically change the compositions of the igneous crust. The associated elemental and isotopic exchange between the oceanic crust and hydrosphere may substantially change the chemical fluxes between oceans and crust during the emplacement of oceanic plateaus.

Using a whole-genome-shotgun method, we sequenced its 2,689,445-bp genome from an isolate, MB4(T) (Genbank accession no. AE008691). The genome encodes 2588 predicted coding sequences (CDS). Among them, 1764 (68.2%) are classified according to homology to other documented proteins, and the rest, 824 CDS (31.8%), are functionally unknown. One of the interesting features of the T. tengcongensis genome is that 86.7% of its genes are encoded on the leading strand of DNA replication. Based on protein sequence similarity, the T. tengcongensis genome is most similar to that of Bacillus halodurans, a mesophilic eubacterium, among all fully sequenced prokaryotic genomes up to date. Computational analysis on genes involved in basic metabolic pathways supports the experimental discovery that T. tengcongensis metabolizes Sugars as principal energy and carbon source and utilizes thiosulfate and element Sulfur, but not sulfate, as electron acceptors. T. tengcongensis, as a gram-negative rod by empirical definitions (such as staining), shares many genes that are characteristics of gram-positive bacteria whereas it is missing molecular components unique to gram-negative bacteria. A strong correlation between the G + C content of tDNA and rDNA genes and the optimal growth temperature is found among the sequenced thermophiles. It is concluded that thermophiles are a biologically and phylogenetically divergent group of prokaryotes that have converged to sustain extreme environmental conditions over evolutionary timescale.									189	36	1	0	171	0	675			1088-9051	1549-5469		WOS:000175556500004	11997336	
J	Wang, Yun; Pang, Yiheng; Xu, Hui; Martinez, Andrew; Chen, Ken S.					wang, yun/0000-0003-2035-3148			PEM Fuel cell and electrolysis cell technologies and hydrogen infrastructure development - a review								ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE				15	6			2288	2328		10.1039/d2ee00790h		APR 2022		JUN 15 2022	2022	Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells or PEMFCs and PEM electrolysis cells or PEMECs are two closely related electrochemical devices having a similar structure: a PEM with catalyst layers (CLs) coated on its surfaces, flow fields, and bipolar plates (BPs). Both systems work at low temperatures (e.g. similar to 60-80 degrees C) and can operate free of CO2 emissions. The PEMFC efficiency can reach as high as 65% with water as the only byproduct when using hydrogen as the fuel. PEMFCs have been considered for stationary, transportation, and portable applications. Several PEMFC products are commercially available, including back-up power and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). As of May 2021, over 10 000 FCEVs were sold or leased in the U.S. and 48 fuel cell electric buses (FCEBs) currently operate in California. More than 3520 FCEVs and 22 FCEBs were sold or leased in Japan up to 2020 and China has more than 6000 FCEVs. The cost and the lack of a hydrogen infrastructure are the two main barriers to the worldwide deployment of PEMFCs. Currently, a PEMFC stack costs about $75 per kW at high volume production and its CLs account for over 40% of the overall cost due to the employment of precious platinum-group metals (PGMs) as catalysts. For FCEVs to be competitive cost-wise, the ultimate goal is $30 per kW for light-duty FCEVs and $60 per kW for heavy-duty FCEVs. Another challenge that prevents FCEVs from widespread application is that only a few hundred hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs) are available in the world. To help overcome this challenge, Japan has set a target of building 320 stations by 2025 and 900 by 2030. Europe has a roadmap of achieving 1500 stations by 2025. China has over 40 HRSs and has been reported to have invested $17 billion dollars in hydrogen infrastructure. PEMECs operate in the reverse process of PEMFCs, i.e. hydrogen production through water splitting using electrical energy, and provide a promising source of renewable hydrogen to supply the fueling infrastructure. They have been successfully commercialized with power varying from a few kW to multiple MW and efficiency around 60-80%. As of 2019, over 14 MW of PEMECs have been installed or are underway across the U.S. The cost of producing hydrogen via PEMECs, which is currently at about $4-6 per kg, has been a limiting factor that prevents large-scale deployment and application. The U.S. DOE has recently set a target to achieve $1 per kg within one decade through the Hydrogen Shot initiative. The objectives of this review are three-fold: (1) to present the current status of PEMFC and PEMEC technologies and their ongoing development, along with the hydrogen infrastructure, (2) to describe the similarities and differences in PEMFC and PEMEC structures, materials, and fundamentals, and (3) to outline the major challenges and opportunities in the widespread deployment of PEMFCs and PEMECs and hydrogen infrastructure development.									7	0	0	0	0	0	6			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000803408700001

In several species only Aoxl is reported as a stress-responsive gene, but in the leguminous Vigna unguiculata Aox2b is also induced by stress. In this work we investigated the Aox genes from two leguminous species of the Medicago genus (Medicago sativa and Medicago truncatula) which present one AoxI, one Aox2a and an Aox2b duplication (named here Aox2b1 and Aox2b2). Expression analyses by semi-quantitative RT-PCR in M. sativa revealed that Aox1, Aox2b1 and Aox2b2 transcripts increased during seed germination. Similar analyses in leaves and roots under different treatments (SA, PEG, H202 and cysteine) revealed that these genes are also induced by stress, but with peculiar spatio-temporal differences. Aox1 and Aox2b1 showed basal levels of expression under control conditions and were induced by stress in leaves and roots. Aox2b2 presented a dual behavior, i.e., it was expressed only under stress conditions in leaves, and showed basal expression levels in roots that were induced by stress. Moreover, Aox2a was expressed at higher levels in leaves and during seed germination than in roots and appeared to be not responsive to stress. The Aox expression profiles obtained from a M. truncatula microarray dataset also revealed a stress-induced co-expression of Aoxl, Aox2b1 and Aox2b2 in leaves and roots. These results reinforce the stress-inducible co-expression of Aoxl lAox2b in some leguminous plants. Comparative genomic analysis indicates that this regulation is linked to Aoxl lAox2b proximity in the genome as a result of the gene rearrangement that occurred in some leguminous plants during evolution. The differential expression of Aox2b1 12b2 suggests that a second gene has been originated by recent gene duplication with neofunctionalization. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

H+/ATP = 4 of ATP synthesis) had suggested that cyclic electron flow has no function in C-3 photosynthesis. After light activation of pea leaves, the dark reduction of P700 (the donor pigment of PSI) following far-red oxidation was much accelerated. This corresponded to loss of sensitivity of P700 to oxidation by farred light and a large increase in the number of electrons available to reduce P700(+) in the dark. At low CO2, and O-2 molar ratios. far-red light was capable of decreasing the activity of photosystem II (measured as the ratio of variable to maximal chlorophyll fluorescence, F-v/F-m) and of increasing light scattering at 535nm and zeaxanthin synthesis, indicating formation of a transthylakoid pH gradient. Both the light-induced increase in the number of electrons capable of reducing far-red-oxidised P700 and the decline in F-v/F-m brought about by far-red in leaves were prevented by methyl viologen. Antimycin A inhibited CO2-dependent O-2 evolution of pea leaves at saturating but not under limiting light; in its presence, far-red light failed to decrease F-v/F-m. The results indicate that cyclic electron flow regulates the quantum yield of photosystem II by decreasing the intrathylakoid pH when there is a reduction in the availability of electron accepters at the PST level (e.g. during drought or cold stresses). It also provides ATP for the carbon-reduction cycle under high light. Under these conditions, the Q-cycle is not able to maintain a H+/e ratio of 3 for ATP synthesis: we suggest that the ratio is flexible, not obligatory.									96	3	3	0	92	0	103			0032-0935	1432-2048		WOS:000085964300013	10750905

The cultivable microflora in Atlantic horse mackerel samples packaged in a modified atmosphere (48% CO2, 50% N-2 and 2% O-2) at refrigeration temperature (6 degrees C) was measured on days 1, 5 and 7 using non-selective (Long and Hammer agar) and selective media (Kligler's iron agar, STAA and MRS). The microflora was genetically characterised using partial amplification of 16S rRNA gene sequences from 309 bacterial isolates obtained from Long and Hammer agar. At the end of the shelf life (5 days), the total viable counts (TVC) on Long and Hammer agar were not significantly different to the LAB counts on MRS agar (p > 0.05). The molecular approach showed that Photobacterium, Arthrobacter, Chryseobacterium and Pseudoclavibacter (44.5% of total) dominated the microbial composition of the fish at the beginning of storage. However, Serratia, Shewanella and Yersinia dominated at the late spoilage stages (over 57.2% of the total). Camobacterium was the most important species of the lactic add bacteria (LAB) and was identified at the beginning and end of the storage period. Vibrio spp. was only found at the end of the shelf life. This research demonstrates that the microbial biodiversity in MAP Atlantic horse mackerel is enormous and the dominant species change over the storage time. The results presented here on the dominant communities in fish products will make it possible to accurately select the best preservation practices. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The temporal evolution of observed fractionations, mass-balance of reactants and products, and reversal of the fractionation at one temperature (155 K) are consistent with a subset of our experiments having reached or closely approached thermodynamic equilibrium. That equilibrium involves a reversed vapor pressure isotope effect; i.e., vapor is between 2 parts per thousand and 3 parts per thousand higher in S-34/S-32 than co-existing ice, with the difference increasing with decreasing temperature. At the explored temperatures, the apparent equilibrium fractionation of S-33/S-32 ratios is 0.551 +/- 0.010 times that for S-34/S-32 ratios-higher than the canonical ratio expected for mass dependent thermodynamic fractionations (similar to 0.515). Two experiments examining exchange between adsorbed and vapor SF6 suggest the sorbate-vapor fractionation at 180-188 K is similar to that for ice-vapor at similar to 150 K. In contrast, the liquid-vapor fractionation at 228-300 K is negligibly small (similar to 0.1 parts per thousand for S-34/S-32; the mass law is ill defined due to the low amplitude of fractionation). We hypothesize that the observed vapor pressure isotope for SF6 ice and sorbate is controlled by commonly understood effects of isotopic substitution on vibrational energies of molecules, but leads to both an exotic mass law and reversed fractionation due to the competition between isotope effects on intramolecular vibrations, which promote heavy isotope enrichment in vapor, and isotope effects on intermolecular (lattice) vibrations, which promote heavy isotope enrichment in ice. This explanation implies that a variety of naturally important compounds having diverse modes of vibration (i.e., varying greatly in frequency and particularly, reduced mass) could potentially exhibit similarly non-canonical mass laws for S and O isotope fractionations. We examined this hypothesis using a density function model of SF6 vapor and lattice dynamic model of SF6(ice). These models support the direction of the measured vapor pressure isotope effect, but do not quantitatively agree with the magnitude of the fractionation and poorly match the phonon spectrum of SF6 ice. A strict test of our hypothesis must await a more sophisticated model of the isotopic dependence of the phonon spectrum of SF6 ice.

Analysis of CO(2) response curves of photosynthesis of the mutant, which has normal Kranz anatomy but lacks a functional C(4) cycle, provided a direct means of determining the liquid phase-diffusive resistance of atmospheric CO(2) to sites of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylation inside bundle sheath (BS) chloroplasts (r(bs)) within intact plants. Comparisons were made with excised shoots of wild-type plants fed 3,3-dichloro-2-(dihydroxyphosphinoylmethyl)-propenoate, an inhibitor of PEPC. Values of r(bs) in A. edulis were 70 to 180 m(2) s(-1) mol(-1), increasing as the leaf matured. This is about 70-fold higher than the liquid phase resistance for diffusion of CO(2) to Rubisco in mesophyll cells of C(3) plants. The values of r(bs) in A. edulis are sufficient for C(4) photosynthesis to elevate CO(2) in BS cells and to minimize photorespiration. The calculated CO(2) concentration in BS cells, which is dependent on input of r(bs), was about 2,000,bar under maximum rates of CO(2) fixation, which is about six times the ambient level of CO(2). High re-assimilation of photorespired CO(2) was demonstrated in both mutant and wild-type plants at limiting CO(2) concentrations, which can be explained by high r(bs). Increasing O(2) from near zero up to ambient levels under low CO(2), resulted in an increase in the gross rate of O(2) evolution measured by chlorophyll fluorescence analysis in the PEPC mutant; this increase was simulated from a Rubisco kinetic model, which indicates effective refixation of photorespired CO(2) in BS cells.									47	0	0	0	45	0	47			0032-0889			WOS:000178654700040	12376660

The materials' macroporosity necessary for gas flow is, however, irreversibly diminished during redox cycling due to (i) large volume changes during the redox transformations, (ii) foam sintering at elevated operating temperature (550-900 degrees C), and (iii) formation and growth of Kirkendall microporosity. To address these challenges, we use directional freeze-casting to create highly porous, lamellar, Fe-composite foams containing uniformly distributed sintering inhibitor (SI) particles- either Y2O3 -stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ), CeO2, or ZrO2-at 0, 5, 10, or 15% of the solid volume. We characterize these foams before, during, and after redox cycling (Fe/FeO/Fe3O4, via H2O and H-2) at 800 degrees C using operando synchrotron X-ray microtomography, metallography, and scanning electron microscopy. Shrinkage of the foam volume and formation of a gas-blocking shell surrounding the foam are reduced as the SI fraction increases. Volumetric shrinkage after the first five redox cycles is decreased from 66% (for pure-Fe foams) to 45% (for all Fe-composites containing 5 vol % SI). Foams containing 15 vol % YSZ show no volumetric shrinkage after five cycles, although, after 20 cycles, they have shrunk 53%. Post-cycling analysis reveals segregation of the SI particles to the cores of individual lamellae, surrounded by thick layers of sintered Fe on the lamellae surfaces. This segregation occurs due to Fe diffusion through FeO to the lamellae surfaces during oxidation, leaving behind the SI particles, which are then pushed into clusters by FeO/Fe3O4 contraction during reduction. The SI is thus rendered ineffective, which explains why foam densification is delayed (compared with pure-Fe foams), rather than fully prevented, after repeated cycling.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000542925300041	32434318	
J	HOMANN, PH; MADABUSI, LV								MODIFICATION OF THE THERMOLUMINESCENCE PROPERTIES OF CA-2+ DEPLETED PHOTOSYSTEM-II MEMBRANES BY THE 23 KDA EXTRINSIC POLYPEPTIDE AND BY OLIGOCARBOXYLIC ACIDS								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				35	1			29	39		10.1007/BF02185409				JAN 1993	1993	Photosystem II membranes were isolated from chloroplasts of pokeweed (Phytolacca americana) and rendered deficient in Ca2+, an inorganic cofactor of photosynthetic water oxidation. The thermoluminescence properties of such membranes were found to depend on the Ca2+-depleting method used. This feature was analyzed with respect to the thermoluminescence emission that accompanied the recombination reaction between the reduced acceptor Q(A)- and the oxidant of the S2 state. It was determined that the differences observed among various preparations of Ca2+-depleted membranes were attributable to the presence or absence of the extrinsic 23 kDa polypeptide on the membranes. The binding of this polypeptide to Ca2+-depleted membranes devoid of the 17 and 23 kDa extrinsic polypeptides caused the thermoluminescence to be emitted at a higher temperature due to a further stabilization of an already abnormally stable S2 state. Addition of the chelators EDTA or EGTA and of citrate brought about a similar response. The conditions required for the upshift of the emission temperature of thermoluminescence strongly resembled those identified by Boussac et al. (FEBS Lett. 277 (1990) 69-74) as responsible for modifying the EPR multiline signal from the S2 state of Ca2+-depleted PS II membranes. Consistent with the authors' interpretation of the reason for this modification, we conclude that the elevated emission temperature of the thermoluminescence emission reflects an abnormal ligand environment of the Mn-center in PS II that may be created by a direct ligation of the added agents to Mn. Evidence is also presented that the return to a normal S2 after an addition of Ca2+ occurs via yet another condition of S2 which, in terms of its thermoluminescence properties, resembles that of Ca2+-depleted membranes before addition of modifying agents, but is not identical to it.									15	0	0	0	15	0	15			0166-8595			WOS:A1993KJ28800004	24318618

We have taken advantage of the slow photoactivation rate of FUD 39, earlier demonstrated in Rova, E. M., et al. [(1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 28918-28924], to study events in photosystem II during intermediate stages of the process. By measuring the EPR multiline signal, the decay of the variable fluorescence after single flashes, and electron transfer from water to the Q(B) site, we found a good correlation between the building of a tetrameric Mn cluster, longer recombination times between Q(A)(-) and the donor side of photosystem II, and the achievement of water splitting ability. An increased rate of electron transfer from Q(A)(-) to the Q(B) Site on the acceptor side of photosystem II, mainly due to enhanced efficiency of binding of Q(B) to its Site, was found to precede the building of the Mn cluster. We also showed that Tyro was oxidized simultaneously with this increase in electron-transfer rate. Thus, it appears that photoactivation is sequential, with an increased rate of electron transfer on the acceptor side occurring together with the oxidation of Tyro in the first step, followed by the assembly of the Mn cluster. We suggest that a conformational change of photosystem II is induced early in the photoactivation process facilitating electron transfer from the primary donor to the acceptor side. As a consequence, Tyr(D), an auxiliary electron donor to P-680(+)/Tyr(z)(.), is oxidized. That this occurs before the Mn cluster is fully functional serves to protect photosystem II against donor side induced photodamage.									41	1	1	0	36	1	43			0006-2960			WOS:000075397000022	9692999

In this study, we investigated whether the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii P.A.Dangeard is capable of executing PCD upon exposure to menadione stress. We report here, the morphological, molecular, and biochemical changes after menadione exposure of C.reinhardtii cells. The effect of menadione on cell death has been shown to be dose-dependent; 5-100M menadione causes 20%-46% cell death, respectively. It appears that growth is inhibited with the concomitant degradation of the photosynthetic pigments and by a decrease in the photosynthetic capacity. Being an oxidative stress, we found an H2O2 burst within 15min of menadione exposure, followed by an increase in antioxidant enzyme (superoxide dismutase [SOD], catalase [CAT], and ascorbate peroxidase [APX]) activities. In parallel, RT-PCR was performed for transcript analyses of Mn-SOD, CAT, and APX. Our results clearly revealed that expression of these genes were up-regulated upon menadione exposure. Furthermore, classical hallmarks of PCD such as alteration of mitochondrial membrane potential, significant increase in caspase-3-like DEVDase activity, cleavage of poly (ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP)-1-like enzyme, and DNA fragmentation as detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay and oligosomal DNA fragmentation were observed. Moreover, antibodies against a mammalian active caspase-3 shared epitopes with a caspase-3-like protein of similar to 17kDa; its pattern of expression and activity correlated with the onset of cell death. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on menadione-induced PCD through a mitochondrian-caspase protease pathway in an algal species.									27	2	0	0	25	0	29			0022-3646	1529-8817		WOS:000337559800016	26988330

A series of characterization techniques including SEM, TEM/HRTEM, XRD, Raman, XPS, PL, UV-vis DRS, TPD, and in situ FTIR were performed to determine the crystal structure, morphology, and optical and electronic properties, respectively. The results showed that the incorporation of doped La into the lattice of In(OH)(3) resulted in the formation of more indium defects due to the lattice distortion, which narrowed the band gap and improved the visible light absorption capability. Meanwhile, the strength and amount of adsorbed CO2 species on the catalysts were greatly enhanced due to promoted surface basicity and increased defect sites originating from La doping. As a result, the La doped In(OH)(3) samples show much higher photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction compared to the undoped one. 1.5%La-In(OH)(3) shows the highest photocatalytic activity among all the samples, with H-2, CO, and CH4 formation rates of 54.33, 34.71, and 56.56 mu mol g(cat)(-1) h(-1), respectively, which are about 3.6, 3.4, and 2.0 times higher than those on undoped In(OH)(3), respectively. Comparatively, excessive La doping caused the formation of La(OH)(3) while a limited amount of La enters the In(OH)(3) lattice, which leads to decreased defect concentration and reduced photocatalytic activity. This work opens up a new perspective to efficiently regulate the vacancies of In(OH)(3) with a facile approach and systematic investigation.									20	1	0	0	2	0	20			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000534338900014

The catabolism of Pro includes two dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by proline dehydrogenase (ProDH) and Delta(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase (P5CDh). P5CDh is a mitochondrial matrix NAD(+)-dependent dehydrogenase that is critical in preventing P5C-Pro intensive cycling and avoiding ROS production from electron run-off. Little is known about the roles of P5CDh in invertebrates, however. We cloned the P5CDh sequence in the Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, and found that LvP5CDh is expressed predominantly in pleopod, hepatopancreas and gill. Subcellular localization analysis revealed that LvP5CDh protein was mainly found in the cytoplasm. In addition, overexpressing LvP5CDh in cells reduced ROS formation and inhibited apoptosis induced by LC50 Cd2+. Shrimp were exposed to various stress factors including infection with Vibrio alginolyticus, (1/2 LC50 and LC50) Cd2+, acid (pH 5.6) and alkali stress (pH 9.3). Both biotic and abiotic stress resulted in increased LvP5CDh expression and Pro accumulation; V. alginolyticus infection, pH 9.3 and LC50 Cd2+ stress apparently stimulated the Glu pathway of Pro synthesis, while pH 5.6 and 1/2 LC50 Cd2+ stress promoted the Orn pathway of Pro synthesis. Silencing of Lvp53 in shrimp attenuated LvP5CDh expression during Cd2+ stress, but had no effect on LvP5CDh mRNA levels if no Cd2+ stress was imposed. Our study contributes to the functional characterization of LvP5CDh in biotic and abiotic stress and reveals it to protect against ROS generation, damage to the cell, including the mitochondria, and apoptosis. Thus, LvP5CDh plays a critical role in immune defense and antioxidant responses.									14	0	0	0	11	0	14			0166-445X	1879-1514		WOS:000459950500001	30592983

In this paper, dimensionally stable anodes with compositions of Ti/(RuO2)(0.7)(IrO2)(0.1)(MO (x) )(0.2), in which M is Ce, Sn, or Sb, were synthesized by the method of thermal decomposition of chlorides using an ionic liquid as solvent, and then, these were used as electrocatalytic materials for elimination of organic pollutants in water. The results demonstrate that a change in the electrode composition is a significant parameter as well as the preparation conditions; in fact, the calcination temperature was a determining variable in the electrocatalytic properties of each one of the anodes to eliminate organic compounds. The calcination temperatures studied were 500, 550 and 600 A degrees C, in which the most efficient electrodes were those annealed at 500 A degrees C. This feature is closely related to the presence of a TiO2 layer that is formed in the electrode when the calcination temperature is increased. Among the 500 A degrees C-treated electrodes, the composition that stood out was the one containing antimony (Ti/(RuO2)(0.7)(IrO2)(0.1)(Sb2O3)(0.2)). These findings are confirmed by XRD analysis and cyclic voltammetry. SEM images showed an apparently compact morphology with discrete microcracks and several grains. High removal efficiencies of the developed anodes to depollute synthetic-produced water containing 30 ppm of naphthalene or benzene, were achieved. It was due to the production of hydroxyl radicals at anode surfaces and the active sites depending on their compositions. Gas chromatography analysis showed that the best degradation rates were achieved by the Ti/(RuO2)(0.7)(IrO2)(0.1)(Sb2O3)(0.2) electrode annealed at 500 A degrees C, equivalent to 93.4 and 99.8% of naphthalene and benzene removal, respectively.									15	2	0	0	1	0	16			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000398739300013

Over the resulting Ni0.09Co2.91O4/Ti3C2Tx-HT in a solution of 1 M KOH, the OER and HER overpotentials of 262 and 210 mV, respectively, are achievable at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). In the case of the overall water splitting by using Ni0.09Co2.91O4/Ti3C2Tx-HT as anode and cathode catalysts, only a potential of 1.66 V is needed to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and the catalysts can stand for a period of 70 h, remarkably outperforming the RuO2-Pt/C-based catalyst and benefiting from the intensive association and interfacial function between the Ti3C2Tx and NixCo(3)-xO(4) nanosheets. Interestingly, a surface reconstruction from the (112) to (111) facet structure occurred upon the fine-tuned Ni doping of regular NixCo(3-x)O(4) hexagonal nanoplates and led to a highly active catalyst surface. At x = 0.09, the amount of Ni3+ becomes the highest, which is favorable for the generation of the critical OH intermediates on NixCo3-xO4/Ti3C2Tx-HT.

In this study, pure m-BiVO4 nanoparticles were fabricated by an easy reproducible solid state route at different temperatures (500 degrees C, 550 degrees C, 600 degrees C, 650 degrees C and 700 degrees C) for 2 h. The synthesized materials were characterized by X-ray Diffractometer where all the diffraction patterns reveal characteristic peaks corresponding to m-BiVO4 with space group C2/c. Obtained m-BiVO4 particles have the lattice parameters: a = 7.2477 angstrom, b = 11.6970 angstrom, c = 5.0900 angstrom and the volume of the unit cell is 309.23 (10(6) pm(3)). Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy exhibits formation of Bi-O bond in the prepared nano powders. Ultraviolet-Visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy suggests that nanostructured BiVO4 particles possess strong energy absorption properties both in visible and ultraviolet region. The particles show red shift of band gap as the calcination temperature rises and possible reasons have been discussed. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirms presence of Bi, V, and O without any contaminant, while particle's morphology was investigated using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope.									2	2	0	0	1	0	4			1229-7607	2092-7592		WOS:000493707000005

ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY				148				128	143		10.1016/j.envexpbot.2018.01.010				APR 2018	2018	WRKY transcription factors are important plant-specific regulatory genes characterized by one or two conserved WRKY domain(s) usually followed by a zinc-finger motif. In this study using Arabidopsis thaliana, the RNA-Seq based transcriptomic analysis showed differential expression of 33 genes encoding WRKY TFs in response to the nitric oxide (NO) donor S-Nitrosocysteine (CySNO). Interestingly, 93.9% of these TFs were up-regulated with at least 2-fold change, suggesting their putative involvement in NO mediated gene regulation. GO- analysis of all the 33 transcriptomic elements showed their putative involvement in biological processes such as abiotic stress tolerance and defense against fungal pathogens (89.39 fold enrichment). Analysis of the NO-responsive AtWRKY TFs promoter region revealed the presence of the cis-acting elements such as ABRE, EIRE, ERE, and MBS involved in osmotic stress response, maximal elicitor-mediated activation, and drought-stress regulation. The analysis of NO-responsive AtWRKY TF motifs and their comparison with rice, soybean, and tomato orthologs suggested that members of the WRKY family belonging to the same group shared similar motifs and phylogenetic tree suggested that these TFs were highly conserved. Validation of transcriptomic data through quantitative real time-PCR showed a high correlation coefficient (0.85) indicating the high reliability and similarity of both types of analysis. Comparison of the NO-responsive and non-responsive WRKYs showed the presence of tyrosine (T) and cysteine (C) residues at a distance of 7 residues from the WRKYGQK motif which may serve as potential targets for modification by NO via tyrosine nitration and S-nitrosylation. We also validated the response of WRKYs through in vivo analysis using atwrky62 loss of function mutant and the results indicated a negative role of AtWRKY62 in plant growth. Furthermore, atwrky62 showed significantly less SNO contents compared to wild type plants indicating putative role of AtWRKY62 in NO metabolism.									30	1	0	0	19	0	31			0098-8472	1873-7307		WOS:000426224700012		
J	Zhao, Rongsheng; Shan, Xuanlong; Yi, Jian; Du, Xianli; Liang, Ye; Zhang, Yunfeng					Ye, Liang/0000-0003-0413-5597			Geochemistry of HCO3-Na thermal water from the Gudian slope: Insights into fluid origin, formation mechanism and circulation in the Yitong Basin, Northeast China								APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY				91				185	196		10.1016/j.apgeochem.2017.10.014				APR 2018	2018	The goal of this paper is to systematically analyze the geochemical and isotopic characteristics (O-18, D, T, C-13(HCO3), and DOC) of a HCO3-Na thermal water to determine its origin, formation mechanism, and circulation pattern in the Gudian slope, Yitong Basin, Northeast China. Schoeller diagrams and isotope data indicate that this thermal water is not connected to groundwater or river water and that its recharge source is immature water with low delta O-18 and delta D values that originates from the Changbaishan area. This result was also confirmed by its DOC C-13 value (approximately - 24%), which indicates that the C originates from C3 plants. The analysis of Na-K-Mg diagrams indicates that the thermal waters, except for one sample (SJXK), are fully equilibrated. This observation, combined with the results of the analysis for O-18, D, T and cation geothermometry data for the thermal water, indicates that no water underwent mixing with cold water before arriving at the surface. Instead, high-temperature immature water flowed up from a deep reservoir and mixed with old formation water (approximately 35.4%) in the Eocene reservoir. These data indicate the occurrence of an interesting phenomenon in which the thermal water samples of the GD area exhibit a regression line with a negative slope and similar delta O-18 values, potentially due to the fractionation of CO2 gas and a buffer of high HCO3- concentrations rather than their short circulation times. The high SO4/Cl, B/Cl, F/Cl and HCO3-/Cl ratios and C-13(HCO3) values (ranging from - 0.84% to - 1.24%) of these samples imply that magmatic volatiles have been dissolved in the thermal water; however, we cannot ignore the contributions of C-13 from the leaching of limestone, with a(13)C value of approximately 3.4%, which is further supported by the Br/Cl and HCO3-/Cl ratios. Thus, we analyzed the geological background and data collected from well Chang-27 and deduced that a limestone stratum exists below the study area. Magmatic volatiles flow up through the lithospheric faults along the northwestern and southeastern edges of the basin, encounter Changbaishan-area recharge water in the limestone reservoir, form hot water with high concentrations of HCO3-, and then recharged into the Eocene sandstone reservoir. Long-term mineral hydrolysis and transformation reactions in the reservoir cause the concentrations of Na to increase and lead to the formation of HCO3- Na water.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0883-2927			WOS:000439018100017		
J	Travaglio, C; Gallino, R; Amari, S; Zinner, E; Woosley, S; Lewis, RS								Low-density graphite grains and mixing in type II supernovae								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				510	1			325	354		10.1086/306551				JAN 1 1999	1999	Primitive meteorites contain presolar grains that originated in stellar outflows and supernova ejecta. Low-density graphite grains from the Murchison carbonaceous meteorite were analyzed for the isotopic compositions of C, N, O, Mg, Si, K, Ca, and Ti by ion microprobe mass spectrometry. The grains are characterized by a large range of C-12/C-13 ratios (from 3.6 to 7200 compared to the solar ratio of 89), excesses in N-15 (N-15/N-14 up to 10 times solar) and O-18 (O-18/O-16 up to 185 times solar), large inferred Al-26/Al-27 ratios (from Mg-26 excesses) ranging up to 0.15, a large range in Si isotopic ratios (from 50% deficits in Si-29 and Si-30 relative to Si-28 up to more than 120% excesses), large excesses in K-41 and Ca-44 from the prior presence of now-extinct Ca-41 (T-1/2 = 10(5) yr) and Ti-44 (T-1/2 = 59 yr), respectively, and excesses in Ca-42, Ca-43 relative to Ca-40, and Ti-49, and Ti-50 relative to Ti-48.Several of these isotopic signatures indicate a supernova origin. In particular, the initial presence of Ti-44 and excesses of Si-28 as well as the size of the inferred Ca-41/Ca-40 ratios are proof that the carrier grains formed in supernova ejecta. We explored the possibility that the low-density graphite grains originated from C-rich ejecta of Type II supernovae. In such stars Ti-44 and Si-28 are produced in the inner layers and the presence of these two isotopes in carbonaceous grains is evidence for extensive mixing of different supernova layers in the explosion.`We performed mixing calculations of different layers of the SN models by Woosley & Weaver under the imposed boundary condition that C greater than or equal to O and compare the resulting isotopic ratios with the isotopic ratios measured in the meteoritic grains. The mixing model can explain the observed C-12/C-13, O-16/O-18, Si-30/Si-28, and Ti-44 and Ca-41 fairly well as long as jets of material from the Si-rich zone, carrying Ti-44 and pure Si-28, are assumed to penetrate the O-rich zone and are ejected into and mixed with the C-rich layers, where carbonaceous grains can form, without overwhelming these layers with the massive amounts of oxygen. Problems with the model are that it produces not enough N-15 and consistently yields lower Si-29/Si-30 ratios than those in the grains. Furthermore, large excesses in Ca-42 and Ti-50 found in several grains, which can be attributed to neutron capture, in the model are obtained only in layers with O > C. It remains to be seen whether adjustment of cross sections and/or multidimensional SN models can overcome some of these problems. It also remains to be seen whether Type Ia supernovae, which have been proposed as a source of SN grains in meteorites, can provide a better explanation. The fact that essentially all supernova grains identified so far are diamond, graphite, SiC of Type X and Si3N4, and only one oxide grain with a supernova signature has been found remains a puzzle.									155	2	0	0	2	0	157			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000079157400029

AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY				100	1			84	90		10.1016/j.aquatox.2010.07.012				OCT 1 2010	2010	Manganese (Mn) is a naturally abundant metal and particularly so in soft-bottom oceanic sediments where it generally occurs bound in a four-valent colloidal state as MnO2. When hypoxic conditions occur in bottom waters, the metal reduces to the bioavailable ion Mn2+ and can reach concentrations known to have immunotoxic effects in the crustacean Nephrops norvegicus, reducing numbers of circulating haemocytes as a consequence. However, we have previously shown that Mn seems to have a contrasting effect on the echinoderm Asterias rubens in which it triggers the proliferation of haematopoietic cells and increases coelomocyte numbers. Since elevated Mn levels mostly co-occur with hypoxia in nature, here we investigated whether hypoxia has a negative effect on haematopoiesis. Proliferation and differentiation of coelomocytes and cells in the coelomic epithelium of A. rubens were compared after 3 days of exposure to realistic levels of Mn, hypoxia or a combination of these two parameters. We can confirm that Mn elevated numbers of coelomocytes and increased proliferation of epithelial cells, but hypoxia did not affect these levels. However, hypoxia did affect differentiation of these cells as judged by investigating the expression of a Runt domain transcription factor, which was also cloned and sequenced. Through comparative quantification using a real time PCR technique, we found that exposure to hypoxia had a clearly stimulating effect on mRNA expression of Runt gene in both coelomocytes and epithelial cells. These results indicate that during hypoxic conditions the composition of coelomocyte sub-populations changed. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

To investigate whether copy numbers vary between individual mitochondrial genes, we used quantitative real-time PCR in combination with flow cytometric determination of nuclear DNA quantities to determine absolute per-cell-copy numbers of four mitochondrial genes in various Arabidopsis organs and the leaves of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare). The copy numbers of the investigated mitochondrial genes (atp1, rps4, nad6 and cox1) not only differed from each other, but also varied between organs and changed during the development of cotyledons and leaves in Arabidopsis. We found no correlation between altered gene copy numbers, transcript levels and O-2 consumption. However, per cell, both the number of mitochondria and the number of gene copies increased with growing cell size. Gene copy numbers varied from approximately 40 (cox1 in young leaves) to approximately 280 (atp1 in mature leaves), and the mean number of mitochondria was approximately 300 in young leaves and 450 in mature leaves. Thus, cells are polyploid with respect to their mitochondrial genomes, but individual mitochondria may contain only part of the genome or even no DNA at all. Our data supports structural models of the mitochondrial genome in non-dividing cells of angiosperms that predict localization of the genes on sub-genomic molecules rather than master chromosomes. The data indicate control of the number of individual genes according to the genotype and developmental program(s) via amplification and/or degradation of sub-genomic molecules.									106	4	0	0	97	0	108			0960-7412	1365-313X		WOS:000285207900006	21143676

However, no studies have investigated p53 in Phoxinus lagowskii, particularly the expression of p53 under different hypoxic conditions. In the present study, the cDNA of p53 from the Phoxinus lagowskii was cloned by the combination of homology cloning and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) approaches. The full-length cDNA of Pl-p53 was 1878 bp, including an open reading frame (ORF) of 1116 bp encoding a polypeptide of 371 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 41.22 kDa and a theoretical isoelectric point of 7.38. Quantitative realtime (qRT) PCR assays revealed that Pl-p53 was commonly expressed in all tissues examined, with highest expression in the heart. In addition, we investigated the expression of Pl-p53 in different tissues under different hypoxic conditions. In the short-term hypoxia group, Pl-p53 expression was down-regulated in both the brain and heart. The Pl-p53 expression was significantly elevated at 6 h in the muscle and liver, and was significantly up-regulated at 24 h in spleen. These results suggest that Pl-p53 plays different regulatory roles and provide a theoretical basis for the changes of p53 in fish facing hypoxic environments.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0920-1742	1573-5168		WOS:000782226900001	35411444

Although generally classed with lampreys as cyclostomes ("round mouths"), it is clear that they diverged from them several hundred million years ago. The crystal structures of the deoxy and CO forms of hemoglobin from a hagfish (Eptatretus burgeri) have been solved at 1.6 and 2.1 Angstrom, respectively. The deoxy crystal contains one dimer and two monomers in a unit cell, with the dimer being similar to that found in lamprey deoxy-Hb, but with a larger interface and different relative orientation of the partner chains. Ile(E11) and Gln(E7) obstruct ligand binding in the deoxy form and make room for ligands in the CO form, but no interaction path between the two hemes could be identified. The BGH core structure, which forms the a, 13, interface of all vertebrate alpha(2)beta(2) tetrameric Hbs, is conserved in hagfish and lamprey Hbs. It was shown previously that human and cartilaginous fish Hbs have independently evolved stereochemical mechanisms other than the movement of the proximal histidine to regulate ligand binding at the hemes. Our results therefore suggest that the formation of the alpha(2)beta(2) tetramer using the BGH core and the mechanism of quaternary structure change evolved between the branching points of hagfish and lampreys from other vertebrates.									8	0	0	0	6	0	9			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000176286000101	11923284

An initial evaluation of 18 strains carrying previously characterized colicins determined that only colicin E7 inhibited all of the E. coli O157:H7 strains tested. A total of 540 strains that had recently been isolated from humans and nine different animal species (cats, cattle, chickens, deer, dogs, ducks, horses, pigs, and sheep) were tested by a flip-plating technique. Approximately 38% of these strains were found to inhibit noncolicinogenic E. coli K12 strains. The percentage of potentially colicinogenic E. coli per animal species ranged from 14% for horse isolates to 64% for sheep strains. Those isolates that inhibited E. coli K12 were screened against E. coli O157:H7, and 42 strains were found to be capable of inhibiting all 22 pathogenic strains tested. None of these 42 strains produced bacteriophages, and only 24 isolates inhibited serotype O157:H7 in liquid culture. The inhibitory activity of these strains was completely eliminated by treatment with proteinase K. When mixtures of these 24 colicinogenic strains were grown in anaerobic continuous culture, the four-strain E. coli O157:H7 population was reduced at a rate of 0.25 log(10) cells per ml per h, which was fivefold faster than the washout rate. Two strains originally isolated from cat feces (F16) and human feces (H30) were identified by repetitive sequences polymerase chain reaction as the predominant isolates in continuous cultures. The results of this work indicate that animal species other than cattle can be sources of anti-O157 colicinogenic strains, and these results also lead to the identification of at least two isolates that could potentially be used in preharvest control strategies.									52	2	0	0	47	0	56			0362-028X	1944-9097		WOS:000177944700003	12233846

Egg can-ying females were obtained from different regions characterized by distinct sea surface temperature (SST) conditions for larval development in spring. Two independent experiments were conducted in two different years. In spring 2012, larvae from females captured in the Lower St Lawrence Estuary (LE) and in the Northeast Gulf of St Lawrence (GSL) were compared. In spring 2014, larvae from females captured in the LE and on the Labrador-Newfoundland Shelf (Northwest Atlantic, NWA) were used. The LE larvae were used both years and served as the reference population for comparisons. In 2012 and 2014, groups of 25 newly hatched northern shrimp larvae from each source population were incubated at six temperatures (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 degrees C) to monitor and compare survival and growth at moult. Northern shrimp larvae from the LE (warmer May-June SST) had a higher optimal temperature range for survival compared to larvae from the GSL and the NWA (colder May-June SST) populations. However, in 2012 growth performance at moult was reduced at higher temperatures for the LE population compared to the GSL population. The differences in thermal performance curves observed may suggest the presence of a certain level of local adaptation in response to the different regional SST regimes in spring-early summer. Northern shrimp larvae in the Northeast Gulf of St Lawrence and Northwest Atlantic shelf could benefit from warmer early-spring temperatures; however, larvae from the Lower Estuary may be closer to their upper tolerance limits and thus more likely at risk of negative impact of future warming of surface water masses.									7	0	0	0	6	0	7			0022-0981	1879-1697		WOS:000416395700006

Thus, present study was aimed to examine the transcriptional response of novel RTF2h gene, for its possible involvement in hypoxia tolerance in C. magur. Novel transcripts expressed under hypoxic stress were identified from ESTs obtained from SSH libraries of C. magur. Homology analysis of novel transcript (JK487668) revealed it to have RING superfamily signature and was closely related with RTF2 homologue. To characterize the expression pattern of CmRTF2h gene in different tissues of C. magur, qRT-PCR analysis was performed which showed significant increased expression, in spleen following short-term hypoxia exposure (12 H; 2.33-fold), while after long-term hypoxia exposure, significant up-regulation was found three tissues: in spleen (6.57-fold), liver (2.31-fold) and head kidney (2.99-fold) and was down-regulated in brain (3.52-fold). Further, the consensus sequence, obtained from SSH EST sequence and transcripts from hypoxia induced transcriptome data, through multiple sequence alignments, homology modeling and phylogentic analysis together, confirmed it as a novel CmRTF2h gene. In-silico protein-protein interaction and docking studies suggested its closely related function to that of RTF2. The present study reports the expression pattern of CmRTF2h under hypoxia. The up-regulated expression of CmRTF2h under hypoxic conditions may contribute to defense mechanism against induced DNA damage, which in turn may of adaptive significance for hypoxia tolerance in C. magur.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0301-4851	1573-4978		WOS:000394349600008	27743114

The as-fabricated electrode of CoP@CF-900, when used as both the cathode and anode for overall water splitting, is able to deliver 200 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.89 V, significantly outshining the Pt/C||RuO2 couple; when used as the air cathode for a zinc-air battery, is able to operate more than 150 h at 10 mA cm(-2) with a nearly constant round-trip energy efficiency of approximate to 60%, also outperforming the Pt/C+RuO2 benchmark. The activity and kinetics origin of the superb multi-functionality is further elucidated through extensive electroanalytical, post-mortem, and operando characterizations, which underscore the construction of robust integral electrodes through synergistic structure and composition engineering.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000730628300001	34913578

Here we adopt one-pot nitridation strategy to synthesize a series of heterostructured photocatalysts based on Ta3N5 and the newly reported nitrogen-doped oxide BaMg1/3Ta2/3O3-xNy (denoted as BMTON) with absorption wavelength of 560 nm. The as-obtained typical heterostructure BaMg1/3Ta2/3O3-xNy/Ta3N5 (denoted as BMTON/Ta3N5) is found to exhibit superior charge separation and transfer ability with respect to the corresponding counterparts, as has been ascribed to their well-matched band gap structure and intimate interface contact. As a result, the photocatalytic activity of proton reduction over the optimized heterostructure BMTON/Ta3N5 (0.4) is about 20 times higher than that of the counterparts, based on which effective Z-scheme OWS system under visible light irradiation can be realized by using the heterostructure BMTON/Ta3N5 as H-2-evolving photocatalyst. This work not only gives a further proof that one-pot nitridation is a general strategy to fabricate heterostructure composed of nitrogen-doped complex oxide for enhanced charge separation and photocatalytic performance, but also demonstrates the promising future of nitrogen-doped oxide in constructing artificial photosynthesis devices.									39	3	0	0	4	0	39			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000449444000001

In this work, a series of nitrogen doped three-dimensional porous Co3O4/carbon nanosheet network catalysts are synthesized (Co-NPC NNs-x), and simultaneously characterized by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electrochemical methods. Among them, Co-NPC NNs-2 is found to be a potential electrocatalyst towards highly efficient electro-oxidation of hydrazine. The electrochemical results clearly display that Co-NPC NNs-2 catalyst shows enhanced electro-oxidation (low-onset oxidation potential, higher catalytic current response), and higher cycling stability (catalytic response retained even after 120 successive cycles) toward hydrazine when compared to Co-NPC NNs-1, Co-NPC NNs-3, and NPC NNs catalysts modified electrodes. The existence of large active surface area, higher active catalytic sites, and synergetic activity between NPC NNs and Co(3)O(4 )NPs (Co-NPC NNs-2) are vital factors mainly attributes to the superior electro-oxidation response of hydrazine. Further, the CoNPC NNs-2 catalyst demonstrated longer durability towards the electro-oxidation of hydrazine, which is highly comparable with commercially available Pt/C catalyst. Such an efficient low-cost electrocatalyst nanomaterial can enable the use of hydrazine as a promising energy carrier for DHFCs, which increases its practicality for upcoming energy storage and conversion applications.

This simple and effective synthesis method was accomplished by solvothermal synthesis followed by pyrolysis. The physical morphology and chemical composition of 3D NHPC were verified by scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Its structural studies reveal that it exhibits a micro-mesoporous hierarchical structure and contains C, O and N atoms forming different functional groups. The characterization also reveals that 3D NHPC has a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 594.774 m(2) g(-1) and the micropore volume was calculated to be 0.192 cm(3) g-1 using the t-plot method. Its catalytic activity was investigated by studying its application for simultaneous determination of ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine (DA) and uric acid (UA) by cyclic voltammetry and square-wave voltammetry at physiological pH. A 3D NHPC-modified glassy carbon electrode exhibits linear ranges from 0.05 to 14.50 mu M, 1.0 to 120.0 mu M, and 2.0 to 30.0 mu M for DA, AA and UA, respectively. It also exhibits low detection limits (0.02, 0.10, and 0.14 mu M for DA, AA, and UA, respectively), good reproducibility and stability. The urine sample analysis results show good recoveries ranging between 96.30% and 105.40%.									31	0	0	0	3	0	31			0003-2654	1364-5528		WOS:000395421000008	28094353

A series of carbonate nanowire/nanotube with different Co/Ni ratio revealed the different growth status of the nanowires on CNT network. The nanostructures of the as-synthesized samples were examined via powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. The Co/Ni ratio of the carbonate largely affected the size of the nanowires, that the low Co/Ni ratio was beneficial for thin nanowire formation and the nanowires loading on CNT network. Subsequently, the electrochemical performance of the Co-Ni basic hydroxides was studied in a three-electrode test system. The nanowires with low Co/Ni ratio 1/2 can form nanowire array on individual CNTs, which exhibited better electrochemical capacitive performance than the composite network with high Co/Ni ratio nanowires after electrochemical activation. The addition of Co enhanced the rate performance of the hydroxide/CNT, especially improved the long cycle stability largely compared to the rate performance of pure Ni converted hydroxide/CNT composite film reported by our previous research. This result is valuable for the design of inorganic electrochemical active composites based on conductive networks for energy conversion/storage applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2296-2646			WOS:000726198700001	34746089

The Ni(OH)(2) with three-dimensional nano-flower structure was successfully prepared. The three-dimensional nanofloral structure weakened the van der Waals forces between the nanosheets, inhibited the interlamellar superposition, and thus exposed more active sites to improve the activity of photocatalytic decomposition water to hydrogen production. When the addition amount of Bi2S3 is 10%, a solution of triethanolamine at pH 10 after 5 h of simulated sunlight irradiation, in the dye sensitization system the hydrogen production amount of the composite catalyst Bi2S3/Ni(OH)(2) is 119 mu mol, which is about 12 times that of pure Bi2S3 (12 mu mol) and about 2.5 times that of pure Ni(OH)(2) (48 mu mol). Microstructure, optical, physicochemical properties and structural tests of the photocatalysts are investigated by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Visible), Photoluminescence (PL) and Electrochemical techniques. Results prove that Bi2S3/Ni(OH)(2)-10% nanocomposite catalysts increase specific surface area and visible light utilization. The n-n heterogeneous junction is formed, which reduces the composite rate of electrons and holes, and improves photocatalytic split of water to produce hydrogen under visible light irradiation.									12	1	0	0	2	0	12			0009-2614	1873-4448		WOS:000620283700007

Here, we dispersedly modified the core-shell structured Ni@NiyFe1-y(OH)(2)on Si photoanodes and in-situ electrochemically converted it to Ni@NiyFe1-yOOH to form a Si/SiOx/Ni@NiyFe1-yOOH assembly, exhibiting the adjustable band bending and catalytic ability in water oxidation depending closely on the composition of NiyFe1-yOOH. Combining with the island-like dispersed distribution to maximize the light absorption and the Ni@Ni(y)Fe(1-y)shell as a high work function and a catalytic layer to simultaneously enlarge charge extraction and injection, the Si/SiOx/Ni@Ni0.7Fe0.3OOH assembly achieved an onset potential of 1.0 V-RHE, a saturated current density of 35.4 mA cm(-2)and a more than 50 h stability in an electrolyte with pH 9 under AM1.5G simulated sunlight irradiation. Our findings suggested that regulating the charge energetics at Si-electrolyte interface by discontinuously modifying a composition-adjustable core-shell structure is a potential route to develop highly efficient PEC devices.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000578298000001	33022839

Transcriptomic profiles of Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) in response to alkalinity stress								GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH				11	3			2200	2246		10.4238/2012.June.15.2				2012	2012	Oryzias latipes (Adrianichthyidae), known as Japanese medaka or Japanese killifish, is a small 2-4 cm long fish common in rice paddies in coastal Southeast Asia and is also a popular aquarium fish. It has been widely used as a research model because of its small size and because it is very easy to rear. Alkalinity stress is considered to be one of the major stressors on fish in saline-alkaline water. As very little is known about molecular genetic responses of aquatic organisms to alkalinity stress, we examined genome-wide gene expression profiles of Japanese medaka in response to carbonate alkalinity stress. Adult fish were exposed to freshwater and high carbonate alkaline water in the laboratory. We designed a microarray containing 26,429 genes for measuring gene expression change in the gills of the fish exposed to high carbonate alkalinity stress. Among these genes, 512 were up-regulated and 501 were down-regulated in the gills. These differentially expressed genes can be divided into gene groups using gene ontology, including biological processes, cellular components and molecular function. These gene groups are related to acid-base and ion regulation, cellular stress response, metabolism, immune response, and reproduction processes. Biological pathways including amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, drug metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, glutathione metabolism, and fructose and mannose metabolism were significantly up-regulated. Alkalinity stress stimulates the energy and ion regulation pathways, and it also slows down the pathways related to the immune system and reproduction.									19	3	0	0	19	0	22				1676-5680		WOS:000308817800042	22782624

In order to promote charge carrier transmission at the interface, a facile and environmentally friendly in situ growth method was employed to construct a strongly coupled N-TNT/GQD composite photocatalyst. The results revealed that N atoms were effectively doped into the crystal lattice of the TNTs in the form of both interstitial N and substitutional N, and the GQDs were decorated onto both the inner and outer surfaces of the N-TNTs through the formation of Ti-O-C chemical bonds. Photoelectrochemical measurements proved that, in N-TNT/GQD composite, N-doping can extend light response to the visible-light range, and the coupling with GQDs not only enhanced visible-light absorption, but also promoted interfacial charge carrier transfer. Due to the synergistic effect between N-doping and GQD coupling, the closely integrated N-TNT/GQD composite exhibits a much superior photocatalytic H-2 production performance under UV-vis irradiation, being 2.1 times higher than that of pure TNTs.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000515117000005	31766029

Layered double hydroxide (LDH) and its calcinated product layered double oxide (LDO) show great potential as adsorbents. However, the conventional preparation of LDH or LDO typically suffers from aggregation and blocked active sites, hampering the adsorption efficiency of the adsorbent. Herein, three-dimensional, hollow MgFe-LDO spheres were constructed through the sacrifice of a carbon template. The hollow structure and the monodisperse state provided MgFe-LDO with sufficient microchannels and abundant active sites for adsorption. Through the memory effect of LDO, the anion methyl blue (MB) can be effectively adsorbed with a high uptake capacity of 398 mg g(-1). Isotherm simulations demonstrated the monolayer adsorption of MB and the heterogeneous surfaces of the reconstructed LDHs. Moreover, the adsorbents can be recycled and reutilized at least five times through magnetic separation followed by calcination. Our proposed strategy is expected to provide new possibilities for the construction of adsorbents with well-controlled architecture and abundant active sites to deal with anionic pollutants.									22	3	0	0	5	0	24			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000453248100051	30516783

Herein, selenide molybdenum (MoSe2) nanoflowers were synthesized as nanocarriers capable of delivering NIR-mediated synergetic photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT), and drug release. All of the MoSe2 nanoflowers (150-180 nm) are made up of many thin nanosheets of about 3-4 layers of MoSe2. With the novel hierarchical nanostructure and small band gap (1.24 eV), the as-synthesized MoSe2 nanoflowers possess strong near-infrared (NIR) absorption and high photothermal conversion efficiency (61.8%). In addition, they also exhibit NIR-stimulated OH generation and this is the first time that MoSe2 nanostructures have been used as a PDT agent. The mechanism was investigated, which revealed that a sufficient number of photo-excited electrons and high O-2 and H+ concentrations facilitate OH production. After PEGylation, MoSe2@PEG exhibits high Dox-loading capacity due to electrostatic and - stacking interactions. After drug loading, the resulting MoSe2@PEG-Dox system exhibits acid/photothermal-triggered drug release. The synergistic effect of chemotherapy, PTT and PDT further induces superior cancer cell apoptosis and improved antitumor effectiveness.									50	4	0	0	14	0	51			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000441583400016	30024001

However, depending on the exact shape of the cost and benefit curves, different thermoregulatory optima may exist, even between sympatric species. We studied thermoregulation in two coexisting colubrid snakes, the European whipsnake (Hierophis viridiflavus, Lac,pSde 1789) and the Aesculapian snake (Zamenis longissimus, Laurenti 1768) that diverge markedly in their exposure, but otherwise share major ecological and morphological traits. The exposed species (H. viridiflavus) selected higher body temperatures (similar to 30A degrees C) than the secretive species (Z. longissimus, similar to 25A degrees C) both in a laboratory thermal gradient and in the field. Moreover, this difference in body temperature was maintained under thermophilic physiological states such as digestion and molting. Physiological and locomotory performances were optimized at higher temperatures in H. viridiflavus compared to Z. longissimus, as predicted by the thermal coadaptation hypothesis. Metabolic and energetic measurements indicated that energy requirements are at least twice higher in H. viridiflavus than in Z. longissimus. The contrasted sets of coadapted traits between H. viridiflavus and Z. longissimus appear to be adaptive correlates of their exposure strategies.									25	0	0	0	24	1	26			0174-1578	1432-136X		WOS:000274457300010	20091170	
J	Song, Jian; Zhang, Lei; Yang, Jian; Huang, Xin-Hua; Hu, Jin-Song								Hierarchical porous Bi24O31Br10 microarchitectures assembled by ultrathin nanosheets with strong adsorption and excellent photocatalytic performances								MATERIALS & DESIGN				123				128	136		10.1016/j.matdes.2017.03.046				JUN 5 2017	2017	Construction of hierarchical structure assembled by ultrathin nanosheet is one of the important challenges in material chemistry and photocatalytic field, because this kind of material can combine the advantages of hierarchical structure and ultrathin material. Herein, we propose an ion-exchange approach to the fabrication of novel hierarchical porous Bi24O31Br10 microstructures assembled by ultrathin nanosheets with thicknesses of 3-5 nm through a facile reflux process, employing previously-prepared Bi25VO40 micro-cubes as precursors of Bi3+ ions. Experiments revealed that the Bi24O31 Br-10 hierarchical structures possessed a high surface area (-67.16 m(2)/g) and abundant mesopores, leading to the strong adsorption capacity for rhodamine B (RhB) with high concentration. The maximal adsorption quantity of the product was calculated to be 24.4 mg/g. Photocatalytic results demonstrated that the as-prepared Bi24O31Br10 sample exhibited a significant structure-induced enhancement of photocatalytic performance. After 12 min of UV-visible-light irradiation, 96% of RhB solution (40 mg/L) could be completely decomposed. In addition, the trapping experiments confirmed that photo generated hole was believed as the chief active specie in the degradation process of RhB molecule. Novelty statement: Construction of hierarchical structure assembled by ultrathin nanosheet is one of the important challenges in material chemistry, because this kind material can combine the advantages of hierarchical structure and ultrathin material. Unfortunately, controllable fabrication about hierarchical porous Bi24O31Br10, microstructures is still a huge challenge until today. Therefore, we afford a facile ion-exchange approach to the fabrication of novel hierarchical porous Bi24O31Br10 microstructures built up by ultrathin nanosheets. Moreover, benefiting from the unique hierarchical and ultrathin structural features, the as-obtained Bi24O31Br10 hierarchical structures exhibited strong adsorption abilities towards RhB with high concentration, as well as superior photo catalytic performance.

Introducing chemical impurities, structural defects, and construction of heterostructures have been considered as the widely adopted strategies to modify the electronic structures of two-dimensional photocatalyst. Up to now, however, the synergetic effect of these strategies on the photocatalytic property of photocatalyst remains unknown. In our work, using first-principles calculations, we systemically studied the effect of non-metal (sulfur) doping, vacancy engineering and interface coupling, as well as their synergetic effect on the electronic structure of g-C3N4. Results indicate that the introduction of doped S atom or C (N)-vacancy in g-C3N4 could extend the light response range by narrowing the band gap or creating gap states, while the coupling effect at interface of g-C3N4/MoS2 is able to tune the band edge potentials of g-C3N4. Incorporation of these strategies, a g-C3N4 with appropriate band gap and suitable band edge potentials can be obtained. Moreover, we also found that these modification strategies can influence the spatial electron distribution corresponded to the band edges, which would be beneficial to inhibiting the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Therefore, incorporating doping or defect engineering with interface coupling should be an experimentally attainable way to improve the photo-reactivity of 2D semiconductors for overall photocatalytic water splitting.									46	2	0	0	5	0	47			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000456951700052

They have suffered more unpleasant ultraviolet radiation due to the Antarctic ozone layer destruction. However, it remains unclear about the molecular mechanism of Antarctic moss acclimation to UV-B light. Here, the transcriptomics and metabolomics approaches were conducted to uncover transcriptional and metabolic profiling of the Antarctic moss Leptobryum pyriforme under UV-B radiation. Totally, 67,290 unigenes with N-50 length of 2,055 bp were assembled. Of them, 1,594 unigenes were significantly up-regulated and 3353 unigenes were markedly down-regulated under UV-B radiation. These differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in UV-B signaling, flavonoid biosynthesis, ROS scavenging, and DNA repair. In addition, a total of 531 metabolites were detected, while flavonoids and anthocyanins accounted for 10.36% of the total compounds. There were 49 upregulated metabolites and 41 downregulated metabolites under UV-B radiation. Flavonoids were the most significantly changed metabolites. qPCR analysis showed that UVR8-COP1-HY5 signaling pathway genes and photolyase genes (i.e., LpUVR3, LpPHR1, and LpDPL) were significantly up-regulated under UV-B light. In addition, the expression levels of JA signaling pathway-related genes (i.e., OPR and JAZ) and flavonoid biosynthesis-related genes were also significantly increased under UV-B radiation. The integrative data analysis showed that UVR8-mediated signaling, jasmonate signaling, flavonoid biosynthesis pathway and DNA repair system might contribute to L. pyriforme acclimating to UV-B radiation. Therefore, these findings present a novel knowledge for understanding the adaption of Antarctic moss to polar environments and provide a foundation for assessing the impact of global climate change on Antarctic land plants.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			1664-462X			WOS:000732735500001	34956286

We developed a novel rearing tank system equipped with a feedback controller using a semiconductor sensor for hydrogen sulfide feeding. H2S aqueous concentration was successfully maintained between 5 to 40 mu M for 80 d with the exception of brief periods of mechanical issues. According to real-time PCR analysis, the numbers of copies of partial 16S rRNA gene of an episymbiont of the crabs with H2S feeding was three orders of magnitude larger than that without feeding. By phylogenetic analysis of partial 16S rRNA gene, we detected several clones related to symbionts of deep sea organisms in Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Epsilonproteobacteria, and Flavobacteria, from a crab with H2S feeding. The symbiont-related clones were grouped into four different groups: Gammaproteobacteria in marine epibiont group I, Sulfurovum-affiliated Epsilonproteobacteria, Osedax mucofloris endosymbiont-affiliated Epsilonproteobacteria, and Flavobacteria closely related to CFB group bacterial epibiont of Rimicaris exoculata. The other phylotypes were related to Roseobacter, and some Flavobacteria, seemed to be free-living psychrophiles. Furthermore, white biofilm occurred on the surface of the rearing tank with H2S feeding. The biofilms contained various phylotypes of Gammaproteobacteria, Epsilonproteobacteria, and Flavobacteria, as determined by phylogenetic analysis. Interestingly, major clones were related to symbionts of Alviniconcha sp. type 2 and to endosymbionts of Osedax mucofloris, in Epsilonproteobacteria.									13	1	0	0	12	0	14			1342-6311			WOS:000316005100004	23080406

The inferior interface between molybdenum sulfides and planar silicon, however, severely suppresses charge carrier extraction, thus limiting the performance. Here, we demonstrate that defect-free gallium nitride nanowire is ideally used as a linker of planar silicon and molybdenum sulfides to produce a high-quality shell-core heterostructure. Theoretical calculations revealed that the unique electronic interaction and the excellent geometric-matching structure between gallium nitride and molybdenum sulfides enabled an ideal electron-migration channel for high charge carrier extraction efficiency, leading to outstanding performance. A benchmarking current density of 40 +/- 1 mA cm(-2) at 0 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, the highest value ever reported for a planar silicon electrode without noble metals, and a large onset potential of +0.4 V were achieved under standard one-sun illumination.									59	1	0	0	6	0	59				2041-1723		WOS:000445270100003	30242212

Needle injury was assessed by two different methods: visual assessment and chlorophyll a fluorescence. Chlorophyll a fluorescence data showed a highly significant correlation with the visual assessments of injury, indicating that the technique can be used as a simple, non-destructive and objective measure for rapid detection of freezing injury and for ranking of needle materials with respect to development of cold acclimation. The analyses showed that, during the autumn, lodgepole pine needles were more hardy and acclimated to low temperatures earlier than Scots pine needles.									50	1	2	0	51	1	55			0829-318X			WOS:A1993LL91600008	14969904

Single heteroatom doping using either N, S, B or P is widely used to enhance the performance of the carbocatalyst for PS activation. However, the performance enhancement from single heteroatom doping is limited by the type of heteroatom used. To further enhance the performance of the carbocatalyst beyond the limit of single heteroatom doping, multi-heteroatom doping can be conducted. This review aims to provide a state-of-the-art overview on the development of multi-heteroatom-doped carbocatalyst for PS activation. The potential synergistic and antagonistic interactions of various heteroatoms including N and B, N and S, N and P, and N and halogen for PS activation are evaluated. Thereafter, the preparation strategies to develop multi-heteroatom-doped carbocatalyst including one-step and multi-step preparation approaches along with the characterization techniques are discussed. Evidence and summary of the performance of multi-heteroatom-doped carbocatalyst for various recalcitrant pollutants removal via PS activation are also provided. Finally, the prospects of employing multi-heteroatom-doped carbocatalyst including the need to study the correlation between different heteroatom combination, surface moiety type, and amount of dopant with the PS activation mechanism, identifying the best heteroatom combination, improving the durability of the carbocatalyst, evaluating the feasibility for full-scale application, developing low-cost multi-heteroatom-doped carbocatalyst, and assessing the environmental impact are also briefly discussed.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000752476800004	34953256

X-ray diffraction is used to determine the phase constitution. The specific surface area and mesoporous pores are measured by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, UV Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy are employed to analyse the mutual synergy between Pt and Au. The hydrogen generation rate is measured to determine the photocatalytic performance. The results reveal that TiO2 is the anatase structure and possess a sea cucumber-like morphology with a large specific surface area. The hydrogen generation rate is 1.745 mmol h(-1) g(-1) for the dealloyed Al92Ti7.86Pt0.04Au0.2 ribbons under the full spectrum irradiation. This value is 29.6 times, 4.4 times and 1.8 times those of the dealloyed A192Ti8, Al92Ti7.9Au0.1, and Al92Ti7.96Pt0.04 ribbons, respectively. The above results indicate that the addition of a small amount of Au and Pt significantly enhances the photocatalytic activity for H-2 production. The Au promotes the absorption of visible light, and Pt serve as an electron sink for effective electron-hole pairs separation during the photocatalytic process. It is a feasible and an effective strategy to take full advantages of respective virtues of noble metals and their strong interactions to enhance photocatalytic activity.

Unfortunately, the energy demand and the CO2 emissions due to H-2 production are high. Hydrogen production utilizes precious carbon sources such as coal and natural gas. In the past we proposed an alternative process concept using a membrane electrode assembly in an electrochemical membrane reactor (ecMR). At the anode H2O is oxidized at an IrMMO catalyst to form protons. By applying an external potential to the ecMR N-2 is reduced to NH3 at the cathode. Just recently Rh and Ru were identified as possible cathodic electrocatalysts by DFT calculations. We present an easy and highly efficient method for galvanic coatings of Rh and Ru on randomly structured Ti felts to be used in a membrane electrode assembly. Linear sweep voltammetry measurements give a slightly higher activity of Ru for the liquid phase electrochemical NH3 synthesis. The NH4+ concentration reached is 8 times higher for Ru than for Rh. From an economical point of view, Ru is also more feasible for an electrochemical NH3 synthesis process. Such electrodes can now be evaluated in an ecMR in comparison to recently demonstrated Ti-based electrodes.									109	10	0	0	5	0	113			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000348203200091	25556769

In this work, P3HT/Ag/TiO2 ternary photocatalyst was constructed to further promote the separation of photogenerated carriers and enhance the photocatalytic activity as much as possible by introduction of Ag nanoparticles into the conjugated polymers/TiO2 heterojunction. The results showed that different amount of Ag nanoparticles were successfully photodeposited on the surface of TiO2 to form Ag/TiO2 composites, which were subsequently hybridized with P3HT, obtaining P3HT/Ag/TiO2 ternary photocatalytic system. The ternary photocatalyst exhibit remarkably enhanced photocatalytic activity for degradation of MO compared to the single-and two-component systems under both visible light and ultraviolet illumination by varying Ag content. This should be ascribed to the favored separation of photogenerated carriers resulted from the synergistic effect of P3HT, Ag and TiO2, as confirmed by the results of photocurrent tests. However, the influence of Ag content on photocatalytic activity under various light conditions was totally different. P3HT/Ag/TiO2-1, with a very small amount of Ag, showed the highest visible light photocatalytic activity, which was 2.1 and 9.7 times that of P3HT/TiO2 and TiO2 respectively and then the photocatalytic activity decreased with Ag loading amount. For the photocatalytic experiments performed under ultraviolet light, the activity continuously increased with the Ag content within our conditions, reaching the maximum for P3HT/Ag/TiO2-4, which was 4.5 and 1.8 times that of P3HT/TiO2 and Ag/TiO2-4 respectively. This might be resulted from the different role of Ag nanoparticles, probably electron sink under visible irradiation and Z-scheme bridge between P3HT and TiO2 under ultraviolet light.									17	2	0	0	1	0	19			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000472476200026

The material structures and chemical properties of the constructed Z-scheme photocatalyst were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The photocatalytic activity for water splitting over the Z-scheme photocatalytic systems has been investigated. The results indicated that they not only could steadily split water without any sacrificial agents injected under visible light irradiation, but also could achieve near stoichiometric amount of H-2 and O-2 for the constructed Z-scheme systems using RGO(3%)-CoOx/BMO as O-2-evolving photocatalyst. The amount of H-2 and O-2 can reach 740.4 mu mol.g(-1) and 376.7 mu mol.g(-1) in 24 h. The mechanism for photocatalytic water splitting has been discussed in detail. In addition, the Pt and CoOx cocatalysts were also the indispensable main factors as the H-2-evolving and O-2-evolving active sites in the Z-scheme photocatalytic water splitting system.

Therefore, sludge reduction is critical. Currently, aerobic and/or anaerobic sludge digestions are widely used in the industries for treating the excess sludge. The objective of this research was to study the effects of aeration rate and temperature on the excess sludge reduction by using the aerobic -anaerobic digestion system in the laboratory. The aeration rates of 1.0, 0.5, and 0.1 volume air per volume slurry per minute (vvm) at the room temperature and the thermophilic temperature (55 +/- 2 degrees C) were investigated. The results showed that the highest removal efficiency of aerobic sludge digestion was obtained at the thermophilic temperature and aeration rate of 1.0 vvm. The removal efficiency of organic matter in terms of COD, total solids (TS) and volatile solids (VS) were 34.76%, 33.01% and 43.45%, respectively. Consequently, the highest specific growth rate of microorganisms was 0.39 per hour and the substrate removal rate was 0.55 milligram CODremoved per milligram VSS per hour. Furthermore, slowly biodegradable organic matter was hydrolyzed to readily biodegradable organic matter and inert soluble organic matter. When the sludge effluent from aerobic sludge digestion was feed to the anaerobic sludge digestion, the removal efficiency of organic matter in terms of COD, TS and VS were increased by 25%, 17% and 28%, respectively. Moreover, the obtained methane production rate in the anaerobic sludge digestion was approximate 0.234 m3/kg COD removed.					11th International Conference on Environmental Science and Development (ICESD)11th International Conference on Environmental Science and Development (ICESD)	FEB 10-12, 2020FEB 10-12, 2020		Barcelona, SPAINBarcelona, SPAIN	2	0	0	0	2	0	2			2267-1242		*****************	WOS:000591382600010

The structure, morphology and optical property of the Tb3+ doped BiVO4 products have been systematically investigated. This study indicates that the incorporation of Tb3+ could induce the conversion of structure from monoclinic to tetragonal for BiVO4. Furthermore, the as-obtained Tb3+ doped BiVO4 samples showed an obvious morphological change: the hollow square rod-like BiVO4 crystal gradually changed to spindle-like crystal. The Tb3+ doped BiVO4 products exhibited extraordinary photocatalytic activity for Methylene Blue (MB) degradation under visible light irradiation. The doped BiVO4 at a molar ratio of 2 at% (Tb and Bi) with a mixture of monoclinic and tetragonal phases showed and prominent photocatalytic degradation rate, which reached 99.9% in 120 min. The results suggest that the differences in the photocatalytic activity of these BiVO4 crystals with different Tb3+ doping concentrations can be attributed to the change of crystalline phases, and the coexistence of the monoclinic/tetragonal phases in BiVO4 products, which improve the efficient charge separation and transportation.

Surface reconstruction during electrocatalysis can form fresh-composition electrocatalysts with unusual amorphous phases in situ, which are more active but difficult to prepare by conventional methods. Here, a facile strategy based on fast reconstruction of amorphous nanofilm precursors is proposed for exploring precious-metal-free catalysts with good electronic conductivity, ultrahigh activity, and robust stability. As a proof of concept, an amorphous SrCo0.85Fe0.1P0.05O3- (SCFP) nanofilm precursor with weak chemical bonds deposited onto a conductive nickel foam (NF) substrate (SCFP-NF) is synthesized by utilizing a high-energy argon plasma to break the strong chemical bonds in a crystalline SCFP target. The quickly reconstructed SCFP-NF bifunctional catalysts show ultrahigh mass activity of up to 1000 mA mg(-1) at an overpotential of 550 mV and extremely long operational stability of up to 650 h at 10 mA cm(-2), significantly overperforming state-of-the-art precious-metal catalysts. Such a strategy is further demonstrated to be a universal method, which can be applied to accelerate the reconstruction of other material systems to obtain various efficient electrocatalysts.									88	7	0	0	0	0	88			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000448786000029	30207621

The molecular bases of this remarkable adaptation are, however, still largely unknown. We applied a transcriptomic approach to a common member of the genus, T. gelatinosa, to investigate the alteration of gene expression occurring after dehydration and subsequent rehydration in comparison to cells kept constantly hydrated. We sequenced, de novo assembled and annotated the transcriptome of axenically cultured T. gelatinosa by using Illumina sequencing technology. We tracked the expression profiles of over 13,000 protein-coding transcripts. During the dehydration/rehydration cycle c. 92 % of the total protein-coding transcripts displayed a stable expression, suggesting that the desiccation tolerance of T. gelatinosa mostly relies on constitutive mechanisms. Dehydration and rehydration affected mainly the gene expression for components of the photosynthetic apparatus, the ROS-scavenging system, Heat Shock Proteins, aquaporins, expansins, and desiccation related proteins (DRPs), which are highly diversified in T. gelatinosa, whereas Late Embryogenesis Abundant Proteins were not affected. Only some of these phenomena were previously observed in other DT green algae, bryophytes and resurrection plants, other traits being distinctive of T. gelatinosa, and perhaps related to its symbiotic lifestyle. Finally, the phylogenetic inference extended to DRPs of other chlorophytes, embryophytes and bacteria clearly pointed out that DRPs of chlorophytes are not orthologous to those of embryophytes: some of them were likely acquired through horizontal gene transfer from extremophile bacteria which live in symbiosis within the lichen thallus.									44	0	0	0	40	0	44			0167-4412	1573-5028		WOS:000377025200007	26992400

Antioxidants are therefore highly sought and can be seen as a type of preventive medicine against several diseases. Myrica and Morella genus (Myricaceae) are taxonomically very close and their species are trees or shrubs with edible fruits that exhibit relevant uses in traditional medicine, for instance in Chinese or Japanese folk medicine they are used to treat diarrhea, digestive problems, headache, burns and skin diseases. Nearly 36 compounds were isolated from different morphological parts of Myrica and/or Morella species and their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities evaluated. Thirteen of these compounds exhibit greater effects than the positive controls used. Adenodimerin A was the most active compound reported (in a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay EC50= 7.9 +/- 0.3 mu M). These results are just one aspect of the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory evaluations reported regarding Myrica and Morella species, so a comprehensive overview on the current status, highlighting the antioxidant health promoting effect of these species, their key antioxidant compounds as well as the compounds with protective effects against oxidative stress related diseases such as inflammation, is relevant.									18	0	0	0	12	0	18				1422-0067		WOS:000366826100024	26225964

Herein, we rationally designed uniform and aligned ultrathin sub-100 nm multipodal titanium nitride/oxynitride nanotubes (TiONxNTs) (x = 2, 4, and 6 h) via the anodic oxidation of Ti-foil in a formamide-based electrolyte followed by annealing under ammonia gas for different durations. XPS, XPS imaging, Auger electron spectra, and positron annihilation spectroscopy disclosed that the high nitridation rate induced the generation of a mixture of Ti-nitride and oxynitride with various vacancy-type defects, including monovacancies, vacancy clusters, and a few voids inside TiOxNTs. These defects decreased the bandgap energy to 2.4 eV, increased visible-light response, and enhanced the incident photon-to-current collection efficiency (IPCE) and the photocurrent density of TiONxNTs by nearly 8 times compared with TiO2NTs, besides a quick carrier diffusion at the nanotube/electrolyte interface. The water-splitting performance of sub-100 nm TiON6NT multipodal nanotubes was superior to the long compacted TiONxNTs with different lengths and TiO2 nanoparticles. Thus, the optimization of the nitridation rate tailors the defect concentration, thereby achieving the highest solar conversion efficiency.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2516-0230			WOS:000680100800001	36132349

However, the rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers massively limits its photocatalytic performance. Herein, we have constructed an intra-Schottky junction in g-C3N4 by enriching it with carbon via a solid-state calcination method to improve the charge carrier separation efficiency for solar photocatalytic H-2 production. Enriching of carbon in g-C3N4 led to the effective overlapping between 2p orbitals of both nitrogen and carbon, thereby inducing an intra-Schottky junction by increasing the C/N ratio as confirmed by XPS analysis. Importantly, compared to bare g-C3N4, similar to 6-fold enhancement on the photocatalytic H-2 production rate was achieved with 5 wt% carbon enriched g-C3N4 photocatalyst. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was mainly attributed to efficient charge carrier generation and separation through an intra-Schottky junction as revealed by photoluminescence, photocurrent and impedance studies. Moreover, the C-enriched g-C3N4 photocatalyst has shown higher photostability and photocatalytic H-2 production activity compared to that in previous reports. Thus, we trust that the present study may provide an insight into the fabrication of an intra-heterojunction for enhanced photocatalysis.									24	1	0	0	3	0	24			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000474624000015

We have investigated two typical representatives fromMagnaporthe oryzae-one of the most dangerous phytopathogens known as a causal agent of the rice blast disease. First, we focused on native expression of two detectedhyBpoxparalogs by the means of reverse-transcription quantitative real-time PCR. Our results indicate a 7-fold induction of theMohyBpox1transcript in a medium with H(2)O(2)and a 3-fold induction in a medium with peroxyacetic acid. For theMohyBpox2paralog the induction patterns were up to 12-fold and 6.7-fold, respectively. We have successfully expressed the shorter gene,MohyBpox1, heterologously inPichia pastorisfor detailed characterization. Observed biochemical and biophysical properties of the highly purified protein reveal that a typical HyBPOX is significantly different from previously investigated APx-CcP hybrids. This newly discovered secretory peroxidase reveals a Soret maximum at 407 nm, Q bands at 532 and 568 nm, CT band at 625 nm and a purity number of 1.48. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis suggests a mixture of high and low spin species in the ferric state dependent on calcium contents. Steady-state kinetic data reveal the highest peroxidase activity with ABTS, 5-aminosalycilate and efficient oxidation of tyrosine. MoHyBPOX1 as a fusion protein consists of two domains. The longer conserved N-terminal peroxidase domain is connected with a shorter C-terminal domain containing a carbohydrate binding motif of type CBM21. We demonstrate the capacity of MoHyBPOX1 to bind soluble starch efficiently. Potential involvement of hybrid peroxidases in the pathogenicity ofM. oryzaeis discussed.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6				2076-3921		WOS:000567117900001	32718101

The present work introduces a new conductive metal oxide V13O16, which is synthesized via a simplified photoelectrochemical procedure and decorated onto the semiconducting photocatalyst BiVO4 in controlled mass percentages ranging from 25% to 37%. Owing to its excellent conductivity and good compatibility with oxide materials, the metallic V13O16-decorated BiVO4 hybrid catalyst shows a high photocurrent density of 2.2 +/- 0.2 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Both experimental characterization and density functional theory calculations indicate that the superior photocurrent derives from enhanced charge separation and transfer, resulting from ohmic contact at the interface of mixed phases and superior electrical conductivity from V13O16. A Co-Pi coating on BiVO4-V13O16 further increases the photocurrent to 5.0 +/- 0.5 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus RHE, which is among the highest reported for BiVO4-based photoelectrodes. Surface photovoltage and transient photocurrent measurements suggest a charge-transfer model in which photocurrents are enhanced by improved surface passivation, although the barrier at the Co-Pi/electrolyte interface limits the charge transfer.									36	1	0	0	1	0	36			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000459798700023	30614577

Establishing synthesis methods to produce a CuBi2O4 photocathode with sufficient cocatalyst sites would be highly beneficial for water splitting. Here, the platinum-enriched porous CuBi2O4 nanofiber (CuBi2O4/Pt) with uniform coverage and high surface area was prepared as a photocathode through an electrospinning and electrodeposition process for water splitting. The prepared photocathode material was composed of a CuBi2O4 nanofiber array, which has a freestanding porous structure, and the Pt nanoparticle is firmly embedded on the rough surface. The highly porous nanofiber structures allow the cocatalyst (Pt) better alignment on the surface of CuBi2O4, which can effectively suppress the electron-hole recombination at the electrolyte interface. The as-fabricated CuBi2O4 nanofiber has a tetragonal crystal structure, and its band gap was determined to be 1.8 eV. The self-supporting porous structure and electrocatalytic activity of Pt can effectively promote the separation of electron-hole pairs, thus obtaining high photocurrent density (0.21 mA/cm(2) at 0.6 V vs. RHE) and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE, 4% at 380 nm). This work shows a new view for integrating an amount of Pt nanoparticles with CuBi2O4 nanofibers and demonstrates the synergistic effect of cocatalysts for future solar water splitting.</p>									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4360		WOS:000710423700001	34641154

In recent decades, the self-assembly of micelles and framework precursors into mesostructures on the liquid-solid, liquid-liquid, and gas-liquid interface has been explored in the construction of functional mesoporous materials with diverse compositions, morphologies, mesostructures, and pore sizes. Compared with the one-phase solution synthetic approach, the introduction of a two-phase interface in the synthetic system changes self-assembly behaviors between micelles and framework species, leading to the possibility for the on-demand fabrication of unique mesoporous architectures. In addition, controlling the interfacial tension is critical to manipulate the self-assembly process for precise synthesis. In particular, recent breakthroughs based on the concept of the "monomicelles" assembly mechanism are very promising and interesting for the synthesis of functional mesoporous materials with the precise control. In this review, we highlight the synthetic strategies, principles, and interface engineering at the macroscale, microscale, and nanoscale for oriented interfacial assembly of functional mesoporous materials over the past 10 years. The potential applications in various fields, including adsorption, separation, sensors, catalysis, energy storage, solar cells, and biomedicine, are discussed. Finally, we also propose the remaining challenges, possible directions, and opportunities in this field for the future outlook.									34	2	0	0	4	0	34			0009-2665	1520-6890		WOS:000729751900001	34609850

Four clone libraries were constructed from samples collected in two contrasting zones in the lake. Computerized statistic tools have suggested that sequence retrieval was representative of the in situ picoplankton diversity. The two sampling zones exhibited similar diversity patterns but shared only about 5% of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Phylogenetic analysis clustered our sequences into three taxonomic groups: Alveolates (30% of OTUs), Fungi (23%) and Cercozoa (19%). Fungi thus substantially contributed to the detected diversity, as was additionally supported by direct microscopic observations of fungal zoospores and sporangia. A large fraction of the sequences belonged to parasites, including Alveolate sequences affiliated to the genus Perkinsus known as zooparasites, and chytrids that include host-specific parasitic fungi of various freshwater phytoplankton species, primarily diatoms. Phylogenetic analysis revealed five novel clades that probably include typical freshwater environmental sequences. Overall, from the unsuspected fungal diversity unveiled, we think that fungal zooflagellates have been misidentified as phagotrophic nanoflagellates in previous studies. This is in agreement with a recent experimental demonstration that zoospore-producing fungi and parasitic activity may play an important role in aquatic food webs.									110	3	0	0	113	0	118			1462-2912	1462-2920		WOS:000243294900015	17227412

However, the dilemma of Zn anode, composed of ineluctable passivation and dissolution problems, severely hinders the discharge and cycling performance of the battery. Herein, the authors propose a chemical buffer layer coated on Zn metal (CBL@Zn) anode, in which ZnO nanorods are uniformly dispersed in graphene oxide (GO), to improve the reversibility of Zn <-> ZnO electrochemical conversion process. Benefiting from the cooperative effect of ZnO nanorods' nuclei role and GO's adsorption affinity, the electrochemical precipitation-dissolution behavior of insulated ZnO is chemically regulated and the Zn(OH)(4)(2-) ions are effectively confined in the chemical buffer layer. Therefore, the symmetrical CBL@Zn-CBL@Zn coin cell achieves a superior stability of 100 cycles with quite low overpotential (30 mv). When paired with commercial catalysts to assemble alkaline ZABs for practical use, an ultra high depth of discharge (DODZn) >98% and excellent 450-h long-term cycling performance are realized. This chemical buffer strategy can potentially provide a new insight for developing other highly reversible alkaline Zn-metal batteries.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000731313600001	34921583

Developing stable, low cost, and nontoxic photocatalysts that have satisfactory solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency is of significance but challenging for realizing the large-scale use of this sustainable technology. Among various photocatalysts, graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) has shown great potential as an ideal candidate to fulfill the breakthrough in this dynamic research field due to its attractive physicochemical properties. Herein, for the first time, the state-of-the-art research progress of GCN for photocatalytic OWS is reviewed. We first summarize the basic principle of photocatalytic OWS along with the advantages/challenges of GCN introduced. The strategies that have been used to modulate the OWS activity of GCN are then reviewed, including cocatalyst investigation, morphology modulation, atomic structure modification, crystallinity engineering, and heterostructure construction. Toward the end of the review, the concluding remarks and perspectives for the future development are presented, with our expectation to provide some new ideas for the design of advanced OWS photocatalysts.									26	2	0	0	2	0	26				2567-3165		WOS:000666906800001

Indigenous microbial communities are responsible for the biogeochemical cycling of pollutants in diverse environments, indicating the potential for bioremediation of such pollutants. Antimony (Sb) has been extensively mined in China and Sb contamination in mining areas has been frequently encountered. To date, however, the microbial composition and structure in response to Sb contamination has remained overlooked. Sb and As frequently co-occur in sulfide-rich ores, and co-contamination of Sb and As is observed in some mining areas. We characterized, for the first time, the microbial community profiles and their responses to Sb and As pollution from a watershed heavily contaminated by Sb tailing pond in Southwest China. The indigenous microbial communities were profiled by high-throughput sequencing from 16 sediment samples (535,390 valid reads). The comprehensive geochemical data (specifically, physical-chemical properties and different Sb and As extraction fractions) were obtained from river water and sediments at different depths as well. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) demonstrated that a suite of in situ geochemical and physical factors significantly structured the overall microbial community compositions. Further, we found significant correlations between individual phylotypes (bacterial genera) and the geochemical fractions of Sb and As by Spearman rank correlation.

It was reported that when leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana were wounded or treated with a soft mechanical stimulation (SMS), they could resist much better the attack of the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea, and this effect was accompanied by an oxidative burst and the expression of touch-inducible genes (TCH). However, no further work was carried out to better characterize the induced defense response. In this paper, we report that TCH genes were identified for first time in the genomes of the strawberry species Fragaria ananassa (e.g. FaTCH2, FaTCH3, FaTCH4 and FaCML39) and Fragaria vesca (e.g. FvTCH2, FvTCH3, FvTCH4 and FvCML39). Phylogenetic studies revealed that F. ananassa TCH genes exhibited high similarity with the orthologous of F. vesca and lower with A. thaliana ones. We also present evidence that after SMS treatment on strawberry leaves, plants activate a rapid oxidative burst, callose deposition, and the up-regulation of TCH genes as well as plant defense genes such as FaPR1, FaCHI2-2, FaCAT, FaACS1 and FaOGBG-5. The latter represents the first report showing that TCH- and defense-induced genes participate in SMS-induced resistance in plants, bringing a rational explanation why plants exposed to a SMS treatment acquired an enhance resistance toward B. cinerea.									17	1	0	0	16	0	18			0721-7714	1432-203X		WOS:000423398900005	29032427	
J	Zhou, Yu; Zeng, Yan-Ping; Zhou, Qin; Guan, Jing-Xia; Lu, Zu-Neng								The effect of captopril on the expression of MMP-9 and the prognosis of neurological function in herpes simplex encephalitis mice								NEUROLOGICAL RESEARCH				38	8			733	739		10.1080/01616412.2016.1202462				2016	2016	Background and purpose: Early increased matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression is involved in the evolution of herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) by facilitating the development of cerebrovascular complications. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the detrimental effects of MMP-9 in HSE has not been elucidated. Recent research finds angiotensin II plays an important role in regulation of MMP-9 activity. The aim of this work was to identify the influence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) captopril on MMP-9 activation after herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection.Methods: Animal models of HSE were established by intracerebral inoculation of HSV-1 into mice. Brain tissue ROS levels were measured by staining with dihydroethidium. MMP-9 protein expression was detected by immunofluorescence and brain water content was measured with dry-wet weight method. Neurological function score was quantified 5 d after HSV-1 infection. Microglial cells were treated with various concentrations of captopril. MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity in the supematant of the cell cultures was assessed by zymography. RT-PCR was used to detect the mRNA expressions of p47phox and MMP-9.Results: Immunofluorescence showed that expression of MMP-9 in brain tissue was mainly presented in OX-42 positive microglia. Quantification of gelatinolytic activity by densitometry showed that expression of MMP-9 in microglia was significantly increased after HSV-1 infection and inhibited by captopril treatment. NADPH oxidase subunit p47phox and MMP-9 mRNA expression were significantly increased 6 h after HSV-1 infection, and were seen reduced after captopril treatment in dose dependence. Captopril also downregulated ROS and MMP-9 protein expression following encephalitis in vivo, and attenuated brain edema, and improved neurological function.Discussion: This compelling evidence suggests that MMP-9 is a key pathogenic factor within HSE. ACEI captopril could reduce the expression of MMP-9 mediated by ROS, then relieve cerebral edema and improve neurological function, which may lay a foundation for further basic research and clinical application.									8	2	0	0	6	0	9			0161-6412	1743-1328		WOS:000383974000011	27354147

Starting with metal-organic frameworks, we present a simple method to synthesize magnetic porous microcubes (N-doped Fe-0/Fe3C@C) with graphitized shell and highly dispersed active kernel via the pyrolysis process under N-2 atmosphere. Batch adsorption experimental results showed that N-doped Fe-0/Fe3C@C had high adsorption capacity for SPA (similar to 138 mg g(-1) at pH = 7 and 298 K). Degradation of BPA adsorbed on N-doped Fe-0/Fe3C@C was further investigated as a function of BPA concentration, persulfate amount, temperature and solution pH. It was found that potassium peroxodisulfate could be activated by N-doped Fe-0/Fe3C@C, and a large number of free radicals were generated which was crucial for the degradation of BPA. The concentration of BPA was barely changed in the individual persulfate system. BPA (10 mg L-1) was almost completely degraded within 60 min in the presence of N-doped BPA (10 mg L-1) was almost completely degraded within 60 min in the presence of N-doped Fe-0/Fe3C@C (similar to 0.2 g L-1). When the BPA content increased to 25 mg L-1, the removal efficiency of BPA achieved to 98.4% after 150 min. From the XRD, Raman, and XPS analysis, the main adsorption mechanism of BPA was pi-pi interactions between the pi orbital on the carbon basal planes and the electronic density in the BPA aromatic rings. While the superior degradation was attributed to the radical generation and evolution in phenol oxidation. This work not only proved the potential application of N-doped Fe-0/Fe3C@C in the adsorption and degradation of BPA, but also opened the new possibilities to eliminate organic pollutants using this kind of magnetic materials in organic pollutants' cleanup.

The recent techniques for desalination and wastewater treatment are energy intensive and unsustainable. Therefore, an integrated and sustainable approach is essential to achieve cost-effective desalination through wastewater treatment. Microbial desalination cell (MDC) has been proven to be one of the emerging technologies capable of simultaneous wastewater treatment, seawater desalination and eco-energy production. This technique generates electricity through the bio-electrochemical oxidation of organics present in wastewater. The produced electricity is utilized to drive the migration of ions in MDC system. This ionic migration will result in desalination as well as formation of value-added by-products. The review summarizes the recently investigated MDC configurations along with their critical evolution of designs and operational parameters on the desalination and power generation capabilities. The review also acknowledges the emerging applications of MDC for microbial electrochemical desalination, bio-remediation, nutrients recovery, water softening, and value-added chemical production. The key findings included that the MDC system achieved a remarkable desalination without any external power input, and treatment of wastewater, and recovery of power without intermediate steps. The technical challenges associated with their practical applications were maintaining the pH in cathodic and anodic fluids, higher internal resistance, usage of catalysts on electrodes, and membrane fouling and durability. However, for certain configurations especially for microbial electrolysis and desalination cell (MEDC)/microbial electrolysis desalination and chemical production cell (MEDCC), the integration with electrodialysis module can significantly increase their performances. The installation of ED module will establish the pH neutrality and increased water recovery through recirculation of electrolytes between chambers of ED module and these MDC configurations. However, the sustainable development of MDC technology and its scale-up requires future investigations related to prevention of membrane fouling, materials feasibility, electron transfer kinetics, microbial growth and durability of catalyst. The feasibility studies are also needed to be conducted for determining the suitability of MDC operation in terms of reactor performance and stability.

Previous studies on four other chloroplast proteins bearing bipartite presequences have shown that they are transported across the thylakoid membrane by two distinct mechanisms. One mechanism is Delta pH dependent and hence sensitive to uncouplers, whereas the other is inhibited by azide. We show that PSI-F is targeted by the latter pathway, since its translocation across the thylakoid membrane is inhibited by azide but not by nigericin. Translocation is furthermore unaffected by the presence of high concentrations of the lumenal 23-kDa photosystem II (PSII) protein, which is known to be transported by the Delta pH dependent pathway. In contrast, translocation of PSI-N across the thylakoid membrane is completely blocked by saturating concentrations of pre-23-kDa protein. Three proteins are now known to be synthesized with thylakoid transfer signals in both higher plants and cyanobacteria (PSI-F, plastocyanin, and the 33-kDa PSII protein), and all three are transported by the azide-sensitive, possibly sec-dependent pathway. In contrast, PSI-N and the 23-kDa and 16-kDa PSII proteins (transported by the Delta pH-driven pathway in higher plants) are all absent in cyanobacteria. These data suggest that the Delta pH-dependent translocation mechanism for these proteins may also have arisen relatively recently during the evolution of the chloroplast. Three additional PSI proteins (PSI-H, -K, and -L) are synthesized in the cytosol with stroma-targeting presequences and hence integrate into the thylakoid membrane by means of information in the mature proteins. We show that the integration mechanisms are insensitive to azide in each case, and nigericin causes only a slight inhibition of integration in each case. We therefore suggest that these proteins are targeted into the thylakoid membrane by a separate pathway(s).									35	0	0	0	26	0	35			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:A1994PV77100027	7961641

Since the intensification of livestock production with its associated increased demand for fodder has encouraged farmers to rely more heavily on chemical fertilizers, very often, municipal waste and wastewater sludge is considered a possible source of plant nutrients, although it might carry a significant amount of anthropogeneous pollutants. The extent to which plants react to drought, as well as how pollutants are taken up or how they act on plants, might depend on rhizosphere processes such as mycorrhizal symbioses. Therefore, it seemed timely to investigate plant defense reactions in the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) toward a possible dangerous sewage sludge pollutant under the influence of drought.This study was done with mycorrhizal plants (+AMF) and non-mycorrhizal plants (-AMF) under conditions of water shortage and certain supplements of pharmaceutics. Plant water relations, activity of plant detoxification enzymes, and phylogeny of root mycorrhization were surveyed to investigate beneficial aspects of AMF symbiosis. Plants were exposed to certain drought phases and watered with tap water containing the pharmaceutical paracetamol (acetaminophen) as a model xenobiotic with environmental relevance. Enzymes of interest for the present study were catalase (CAT) and glutathione S-transferase (GST). Assays followed published methods. GST spectrophotometric assays included model substrates 1-chloro-2,4dinitrobenzene, 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene, and 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzoyl-chloride.Our observations indicate H2O2 accumulation in roots of AMF plants and concomitant increases of catalase activities. Enzyme activities were lower in AMF plants even after exposure to both drought stress and paracetamol. AMF symbiosis seems a strategy to influence plant water tolerance and stress enzymes. Catalase activity seemed to be exhausted at the end of 56 days of drought treatment and pharmaceutics incubation, as indicated by high H2O2 levels at the end of the experiment. GST reactions differed between drought or paracetamol-stressed plants. A combination of both stressors resulted in lowered GST activities. Both catalase and GST activities decreased in the presence of paracetamol in the AMF roots after drought treatment. When soil water contents declined, AMF symbiosis supported leaf water content and production of biomass. During dry cycles, AMF roots achieved lower activities of cytosolic GST than that as compared to non-mycorrhizal roots. However, under drought and pharmaceutics supplements, water relations of mycorrhizal plants were more balanced than in non-mycorrhizal plants. In addition, roots showed an enhanced mycorrhization rate in those circumstances.We propose that the adjustment of CAT and GST activities in mycorrhizal roots under drought and xenobiotics might be caused by a decreased oxidative damage to rhizosphere because AMF plants had consistently better plant water relations and biomass production. Additional drought avoidance mechanisms indicated by the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis might also contribute to the lower oxidative stress in mycorrhizal plants. Since the role of mycorrhiza in the fate of organic pollutants has not yet been understood, further ecotoxicological studies in mycorrhizosphere needs to be achieved as cooperation between plant-microbe specialists and ecotoxicologists.									29	7	0	0	26	1	34			1439-0108	1614-7480		WOS:000273088400006

The increase in petroleum exploitation in Amazonia has resulted in sediment input to aquatic systems, with impacts on their biodiversity. Here we use a combination of field measurements and statistical analyses to evaluate the impacts of anthropogenic silt derived from the construction of roads, borrow pits, and wells during the terrestrial development of gas and oil, on macroinvertebrate communities in streams of the Urucu Petroleum Province in the Central Brazilian Amazon.Ten impacted and nine non-impacted streams were sampled in January, April, and November of 2007. Macroinvertebrates were sampled along a 100-m continuous reach in each stream at 10-m intervals using a dip net. Abiotic variables including, a siltation index (SI), suspended inorganic sediment (SIS), sediment color index (SCI), suspend organic sediment (SOS), pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, temperature, water velocity, channel width, and depth, were measured at three equidistant points in each stream (similar to 30-m intervals).SI did not differ between impacted and undisturbed streams. SIS was higher and SCI lower (more reddish) in impacted than in non-impacted streams. SCI had a positive and SIS a negative effect on both macroinvertebrate richness and density. SIS and SCI also influenced macrophyte taxonomic composition. In impacted streams, taxonomic richness and density were 1.5 times lower than in non-impacted streams. No taxon was significantly associated with impacted streams. SIS was positively correlated with SOS and electrical conductivity while SCI was negatively correlated with SOS, electrical conductivity, and pH. The lack of difference in SI between impacted and non-impacted streams suggests that anthropogenic sediment does not accumulate on stream beds. The reddish color of SIS in impacted streams reflects terrestrial erosion and indicates the rapid flow of suspended sediments through these reaches, impacting macroinvertebrate richness, density, and species composition.Anthropogenic suspended silt has had a significant negative impact on aquatic macroinvertebrate diversity and density in streams in the Urucu Petroleum Province. Soil conservation measures are needed to reduce silt inputs and restore these streams to their natural condition. Additional studies are also needed to investigate the dynamics of sediments in the impacted streams.									33	4	0	0	30	1	40			1439-0108	1614-7480		WOS:000273088400009

While, there are limited studies to explore the roles of NOS/NOX enzymes in crustacean immunity, and no studies as yet were attempted to elucidate their functions in host immune responses to parasites. In the present study, we cloned a full-length cDNA of NOS and two partial cDNA fragments of NOX and GPx from the economic valuable crab Portunus trituberculatus. The full-length cDNA of NOS was 4002 bp in length that encoded 1203 amino acids containing motifs of the NOS protein and conserved domains. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the NOS protein sequence was clustered together with those of crustacean species in the phylogenetic tree. All of the three novel genes showed high mRNA transcripts in the immune-related tissues (e.g. hemocytes, hepatopancreas) of P. trituberculatus. Striking fluctuation in the transcripts of the critical NO/O-2(-)- generating/scavenging related genes (NOS, NOX, CuZnSOD, CAT, GPx) as well as in the enzymatic activities of NOS, NOX, SOD, CAT and GPx were observed in the hemocytes and hepatopancreas of P. trituberculatus post challenged with the parasitic dinoflagellate Hematodinium, indicating that the NO/O-2(-)- generating and the antioxidant systems played vital roles in the crustacean innate immunity against the parasitic intrusion. The results indicated a novel respect of the host-parasite interaction between the crab host and the parasitic dinoflagellate Hematodinium. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The LOX family genes have been extensively studied under biotic and abiotic stresses, both in model and non-model plant species; however, information on their roles in cotton is still limited.Results: A total of 64 putative LOX genes were identified in four cotton species (Gossypium (G. hirsutum, G. barbadense, G. arboreum, and G. raimondii)). In the phylogenetic tree, these genes were clustered into three categories (9-LOX, 13-LOX type I, and 13-LOX type II). Segmental duplication of putative LOX genes was observed between homologues from A2 to A(t) and D5 to D-t hinting at allopolyploidy in cultivated tetraploid species (G. hirsutum and G. barbadense). The structure and motif composition of GhLOX genes appears to be relatively conserved among the subfamilies. Moreover, many cis-acting elements related to growth, stresses, and phytohormone signaling were found in the promoter regions of GhLOX genes. Gene expression analysis revealed that all GhLOX genes were induced in at least two tissues and the majority of GhLOX genes were up-regulated in response to heat and salinity stress. Specific expressions of some genes in response to exogenous phytohormones suggest their potential roles in regulating growth and stress responses. In addition, functional characterization of two candidate genes (GhLOX12 and GhLOX13) using virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) approach revealed their increased sensitivity to salinity stress in target gene-silenced cotton. Compared with controls, target gene-silenced plants showed significantly higher chlorophyll degradation, higher H2O2, malondialdehyde (MDA) and proline accumulation but significantly reduced superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, suggesting their reduced ability to effectively degrade accumulated reactive oxygen species (ROS).Conclusion: This genome-wide study provides a systematic analysis of the cotton LOX gene family using bioinformatics tools. Differential expression patterns of cotton LOX genes in different tissues and under various abiotic stress conditions provide insights towards understanding the potential functions of candidate genes. Beyond the findings reported here, our study provides a basis for further uncovering the biological roles of LOX genes in cotton development and adaptation to stress conditions.									32	1	0	0	20	1	32			1471-2164			WOS:000441224300002	30092779

However, several factors strongly limit its actual efficiency and among these, poor charge transport has been identified as one major limitation to be overcome. Many efforts have been made to improve charge transport and charge separation in BiVO4 including various doping strategies as well as nanostructuring the absorber to the dimension of its charge carrier diffusion length. In this article, we present a new wet chemical synthesis approach to fabricate pristine and Mo-doped BiVO4 thin film photoanodes. Starting from a solution containing metalorganic Bi, V and Mo precursors, homogeneous and reproducible thin films can be fabricated by a simple procedure of dip-coating and subsequent calcination in air. Structural and morphological characterization reveals that the polycrystalline BiVO4 thin films crystallize in the monoclinic scheelite structure in micrometer-sized randomly oriented, porous domains. The small band-gap scheelite structure is maintained upon Mo doping into the BiVO4 lattice, yielding optimized light harvesting and improved charge carrier transport properties. As a result, the photoelectrochemical performance regarding water oxidation of the as-synthesized Mo-doped BiVO4 thin film photoanodes is highly improved with respect to their pristine counterparts. Photocurrent densities of 1.9 mA cm(-2) and 4.6 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE under visible light illumination (100 mW cm(-2)) are measured for unmodified and CoPi-modified Mo-doped BiVO4 photoanodes respectively, both of which are amongst the highest values reported for modified BiVO4 single-layer design photoanodes so far.									61	2	0	0	0	0	62			2398-4902			WOS:000422789600017

In this study, Crassostrea gigas, a species well adapted to the highly variable intertidal environment, was exposed to the chronic environmental challenges of temperature (19 and 24 degrees C) and pH (ambient seawater and a reduction of 0.4 pH units) in an extended 3-month laboratory-based study. Physiological parameters were measured (condition index, shell growth, respiration, excretion rates, O:N ratios, and ability to repair shell damage) alongside molecular analyses. Temperature was by far the most important stressor, as demonstrated by reduced condition indexes and shell growth at 24 degrees C, with relatively little effect detected for pH. Transcriptional profiling using candidate genes and SOLiD sequencing of mantle tissue revealed that classical stress genes, previously reported to be upregulated under acute temperature challenges, were not significantly expressed in any of the treatments, emphasizing the different response between acute and longer term chronic stress. The transcriptional profiling also elaborated on the cellular responses underpinning the physiological results, including the identification of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway as a potentially novel marker for chronic environmental challenge. This study represents a first attempt to understand the energetic consequences of cumulative thermal stress on the intertidal C.gigas which could significantly impact on coastal ecosystem biodiversity and function in the future.									48	2	0	0	46	0	49			2045-7758			WOS:000324932600008	24223268

Herein, we explore the effects of B/Al and Si/B ratios on the local configurations around cations and the degree of network polymerization of Na2O-Al2O3-B2O3-SiO2 glasses in nepheline (NaAlSiO4) - malinkoite (NaBSiO4) and albite (NaAlSi3O8) - reedmergnerite (NaBSi3O8) joins using multi-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The B-11 NMR results confirmed an increase in the B coordination numbers from 3 (B-[3]) to 4 (B-[4]) as B/Al and Si/B ratios increase. The Al-27 NMR spectra show that the Al is mainly four coordinated, except in NaAl0.25B0.75SiO4 glasses, with a minor amount of Al-[5] species, revealing a more prominent control of Si over that of B on the Al coordination environments. The O-17 NMR spectra resolve distinct bridging (BO, Si-O-Al, Al-O-Al, Si-O-Si, B-O-B, and Si-O-B) and non-bridging oxygens (NBO, Na-O-Si). In contrast, the absence of B-O-Al species confirmed the separation between B and Al and prevalent melt depolymerization exclusively in silicate-networks. The fractions of B-O-B and Na-NBO increase as B/Al ratio increases, accounting for a drastic enhancement in the dissolution rate of glasses. A dramatic increase also indicates an enhanced connectivity of relatively weaker bonds such as B-O-B and Na-O-Si as composition reached a certain boron content. This is linked to a decrease in the melt viscosity with increasing B2O3 component. Based on the measured fractions of B-[3,B-4] in B-11 NMR spectra with varying composition, the trend of the evolution of boron isotope composition in sodium aluminoborosilicate melts was estimated, confirming the preferential enrichment of B-10 into rhyolitic melts with increasing boron content. The decreased fraction of B-[3] species with increasing Si/B may partly explain the reduction in delta B-11 in boron-bearing volcanic rocks at deeper depths in the subduction zone. The results suggest that composition-induced changes in the atomic structures should be constrained to precisely interpret the melt viscosity, boron isotope composition of arc volcanic lavas, and the dissolution rates of nuclear waste glasses.

The binding patterns of these two extrinsic proteins are different between cyanobacterial (Thermosynechococcus vulcanus) and red algal (Cyanidium caldarium) PSIIs [Shen and Inoue (1993) Biochemistry 32: 1825; Enami et al. (1998) Biochemistry 39: 27871. In order to elucidate the possible causes responsible for these differences, we first cloned the psbV gene encoding Cyt c550 from a red alga, Cyanidium caldarium, which was compared with the homologous sequences from other organisms. Cross-reconstitution experiments were then performed with different combinations of the extrinsic proteins and the cyanobacterial or red algal PSII (1) Both the cyanobacterial and red algal Cyt c550 bound directly to the cyanobacterial PSII, whereas none of them bound directly to the red algal PSII, indicating that direct binding of Cyt c550 to PSII principally depends on the structure of PSII intrinsic proteins but not that of Cyt c550 itself. (2) Cyt c550 was functionally exchangeable between the red algal and the cyanobacterial PSII, and the red algal 12 kDa protein functionally bound to the cyanobacterial PSII, whereas the cyanobacterial 12 kDa protein did not bind to the red algal PSII (3) The antibody against the cyanobacterial or red algal 12 kDa protein reacted with its original one but not with the homologous protein from the other organism, whereas the antibody against the red algal Cyt c550 reacted with both cyanobacterial and red algal Cyt c550. These results imply that the structure and function of Cyt c550 have been largely conserved, whereas those of the 12 kDa protein have been changed, in the two organisms studied here.									28	0	0	0	27	0	32			0032-0781			WOS:000184936600005	12941874

Both of these are extremely difficult to reuse. Here, we report a method to control FG waste, in which RM was used to enhance the removal of Pb from FG via a vacuum thermal process. The removed residual glass was utilized to create glass-ceramics. The results showed that RM can enhance the lead removal from waste CRT funnel glass by the vacuum thermal process. When 30% RM was added, the removal rate reached 98.54%. A significant mechanism of enhancing delead is investigated by a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results showed that the -Pb-O-Si-O- network structure was broken by the free calcium ions of RM. Afterward, valuable glass-ceramics with tetragonal-KAlSi2O6 and triclinic-CaSiO3 crystals were synthesized using the residual glass. The Pb, Ba, Cr, and Cu leaching concentrations of the glass-ceramics were well below the regulatory limit (5 mg/L) of the CA-EPA, as measured by the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) test. Overall, the results indicated that RM enhanced the removal of lead during the vacuum thermal process. The synthesis of value-added glass-ceramics reutilized silicate resources from waste cathode ray tube (CRT) funnel glass and RM.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000752488700009	35091191	
J	Yin, Mengsha; Huang, Haiping								Pitfalls of Using Biomarker Maturity Parameters for Organic Matter Maturity Assessment Suggested by Coal Hydrous Pyrolysis								ENERGIES				15	7					2595	10.3390/en15072595				APR 2022	2022	Crude oil maturity assessment is a vital goal for petroleum geochemistry, and equally important is the exploration of maturity indicators of sufficient credibility. While most molecular proxy parameters have been extensively used and have provided some useful insights; the component ratios approach is somewhat limited in validity regarding oil maturity characterization for variable reasons. Novel thermal trends of hopanes and steranes were observed in a series of hydrous pyrolysates of an immature coal (0.49 %Ro) generated at eight target temperatures ranging from 250-375 degrees C (measured vitrinite reflectance of 0.71-0.91 %Rm), which-further substantiated this idea. Expelled oil and extractable bitumen were combined as the total soluble organic material (tSOM) for each pyrolysis experiment to mitigate the effects of primary expulsion fractionation. While bitumen extracted from the original coal-the 250 degrees C tSOM-the 275 degrees C tSOM (0.49-0.73 %Rm) sequence recorded normal increases in C-31 alpha beta-hopane 22S/(22S + 22R) and decreases in C-29-C-30 beta alpha-moretane/alpha beta-hopane ratios, low values and continuous decreases in C-29 5 alpha-sterane 20S/(20S + 20R) and beta beta/(alpha alpha + beta beta), Ts/(Ts + Tm) and C29Ts/(C29Ts + C-29 alpha beta-hopane) suggested no biomarker thermal isomerization but predominant control from precursor-to-biomarker transformation. Continuous increases in 22S/(22S + 22R) until 1.43 %Rm accorded with thermal isomerization, but a delayed ratio equilibration at 1.43 %Rm again suggested biomarker precursor interference, which also played a role in the reductions in 20S/(20S + 20R) and beta beta/(alpha alpha + beta beta) to 0.9 %Rm, whereas increasing and high values of C-29-C-30 beta alpha-moretane/alpha beta-hopane ratios occurring during 0.73-1.43 %Rm. Reversals in 22S/(22S + 22R) and fluctuations in 20S/(20S + 20R) and beta beta/(alpha alpha + beta beta) at elevated maturity levels with minimum yields of biomarker precursors were predominantly controlled by differential isomer degradative rates. These rarely reported thermal distribution patterns of biomarkers illustrated very complicated biomarker generation-destruction processes during maturation and suggested that the release of bond biomarker to the free status may govern the biomarker maturity ratios rather than thermal isomerization. While the rapid heating conditions and high temperatures in pyrolysis differ inevitably from natural evolution under geological conditions, our study unveiled that unusual biomarker ratios in geological samples could be the norm, contradictory to common beliefs. Accordingly, we propose that isomer concentration is an essential tool to validate maturity estimation of organic matter by isomer ratios, especially for highly mature oils and sediment extracts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1996-1073		WOS:000781181800001

Analysis of photochemical activity by active chlorophyll fluorescence indicated a significant decline in the photochemical capacity of photosystem II (PSII), F-v/F-m, in both algal species when shifted to high light, with a greater decline noted in P. minimum. While there was no significant difference in the effective quantum yield in the light acclimated state (Delta F/F-m') under high light between these algae, there were differences in how light energy was utilized between the two species. P. minimum displayed a typical upregulation in light energy dissipation via nonphotochemical pathways by significant elevated nonphotochemical fluorescence quenching and a rapid reduction in electron transport with increasing immediate light exposure. Low light acclimated C. subsalsa maintained greater electron transport during short term high light exposure, and showed minimal change in nonphotochernical energy dissipation despite higher excitation pressure placed upon PSII when shifted to high light for several days. C. subsalsa displayed a significantly higher growth rate than P. minimum following the shift of unialgal cultures from low to high light, while both species grew at equivalent rates when cultured together and shifted to high light. Results from these experiments and analysis of loss and subsequent recovery of PSII in the presence and absence of chloroplast protein translation suggest that during shifts to high light P. minimum relies heavily on photosystern turnover and repair as well as nonphotochemical dissipation most likely from xanthophyll cycle activity. Meanwhile, C. subsalsa appears to down-regulate the number of functional PSII reaction centers yet maintains photochemical activity through lowered electron transport to avoid potential photoinhibition.

Single Ti/RuO2 and Ti/IrO2 catalysts were prepared to compare their morphologies and electrochemical behavior against the binary DSA. XRD and profile refinement suggest that Ti/RuO2-IrO2 forms a solid solution, where RuO2 and IrO(2 )growths are oriented by the TiO2 substrate through substitution of Ir by Ru atoms within its rutile-type structure. SCM reveals mud-cracked structures with flat areas for all catalysts, while EDS analysis indicates atomic ratios in the range of the oxide stoichiometries in the nominal concentrations used during synthesis. A considerably higher CPX degradation is achieved in the presence of NaCl than in Na2SO4 or Na3PO4 media due to the active chlorine generation. A faster CPX degradation is reached when the current density is increased or the pH value is lowered. This last behavior may be ascribed to an acid-catalyzed reaction between HClO and CPX. Degradation rates of 22.5, 3.96, and 0.576 mu mol L-1 min(-1) were observed for DW, MWW and urine, respectively. The lower efficiency measured in these last two effluents was related to the presence of organic matter and urea in the matrix. A degradation pathway is proposed based on HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS analysis, indicating the fast formation (5 min) of CPX-(S)-sulfoxide and CPX-(R)-sull'oxide, generated due the Cl-2-active attack at the CPX thioether. Furthermore, antimicrobial activity elimination of the treated solution is reached once CPX, and the initial by-products are considerably eliminated. Finally, even if only 16% of initial TOC is removed, BOD5 tests prove the ability of electro-generated Cl-2-active to transform the antibiotic into biodegradable compounds. A similar strategy can be used for the abatement of other recalcitrant compounds contained in real water matrices such as urine and municipal wastewaters.

J	KLESS, H; VERMAAS, W								MANY COMBINATIONS OF AMINO-ACID-SEQUENCES IN A CONSERVED REGION OF THE D1 PROTEIN SATISFY PHOTOSYSTEM-II FUNCTION								JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY				246	1			120	131		10.1006/jmbi.1994.0071				FEB 10 1995	1995	The putative de helix of the D1 protein is located at the acceptor side of photosystem II (PS LI) and serves as an indispensable part of a niche that binds the secondary plastoquinone Q(B). Combinatorial mutagenesis was applied to a stretch of four residues in a highly conserved region of this putative helix in order to reveal amino acid combinations that are able to support PS II function. An obligate photoheterotrophic mutant of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, missing four residues (Delta YFGR(254-7)) in the ne helix, was transformed with a D1-coding sequence carrying fully degenerate combinations of codons at the site of the deletion. Upon selection for photoautotrophy, 25 mutants with functional PS Il were isolated. All mutants showed different codon combinations at positions 254 to 257; none was identical to the wild-type sequence, and none of the conserved residues was found to be mandatory for PS II function. However, 24 of the mutants contained Tyr or Phe at position 254 while at the other three positions many different amino acid combinations could be functionally accommodated. Most sequences maintained an amphiphilic arrangement of the helix that may align Tyr254 facing the Q(B) binding pocket. This residue is proposed to be functionally analogous to Phe216 of the L subunit in purple bacteria which contributes to binding of Q(B). Most Of the PS II properties were similar in the mutants compared to wild-type. Noticeable modifications in the mutants concerned the semiquinone equilibrium of electron transfer between Q(A) and Q(B), and the affinity of PS II inhibitors. Differential effects on the semiquinone equilibrium were observed between two distinct quinones occupying the Q(B) site (plastoquinone versus 2,5-dichloro-p-benzo-quinone), implying that residues in this domain are involved, directly or indirectly, with different binding determinants of the quinones. Even though many different combinations of amino acids in positions 254 to 257 of the D1 protein may satisfy the primary function of PS II, complex requirements need to be combined for optimized performance of the Q(B) binding niche.									23	0	0	0	19	0	23			0022-2836	1089-8638		WOS:A1995QF77400014	7853392	
J	Hays, AMA; Vassiliev, IR; Golbeck, JH; Debus, RJ								Role of D1-His190 in the proton-coupled oxidation of tyrosine Y-Z in manganese-depleted photosystem II								BIOCHEMISTRY				38	37			11851	11865		10.1021/bi990716a				SEP 14 1999	1999	TO further characterize the role of D1-His190 in the oxidation of tyrosine Y-Z in photosystem II, the pH dependence of P-680(.+) reduction was measured in H190A and Mn-depleted wild-type* PSII particles isolated from the cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Measurements were conducted in the presence and absence of imidazole and other small organic bases. In H190A PSII particles, rapid reduction of P-680(.+) attributed to electron transfer from Y-Z increased dramatically above pH 9, with an apparent pK(A) of similar to 10.3. In the presence of ethanolamine and imidazole, this dramatic increase occurred at lower pH values, with the efficiency of YZ oxidation correlating with the solution pK(A) value of the added base. We conclude that the pK(A) of Y-Z is similar to 10.3 in D1-H190A PSII particles. In Mn-depleted wild type* PSII particles, P-680(.+) reduction was accelerated by all exogenous bases examined (substituted imidazoles, histidine, Tris, and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2] octane). We conclude that Y-Z is solvent accessible in Mn-depleted wild-type* PSII particles and that its pK(A) is near that of tyrosine in solution. In Mn-depleted wild-type* PSII particles, over 80% of the kinetics of P680.+ reduction after a flash could be described by three kinetic components. The individual rate constants of these components varied slightly with pH, but their relative proportions varied dramatically with pH, showing apparent pK(A) values of 7.5 and 6.25 (6.9 and 5.8 in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions). An additional pKA value (pK(A) < 4.5) may also be present. To describe these data, we propose (1) the pKA of His190 is 6.9-7.5, depending on buffer ions, (2) the deprotonation of Y-Z is facilitated by the transient formation of a either a hydrogen bond or a hydrogen-bonded water bridge between Y-Z and D1-His190, and (3) when protonated, D1-His190 interacts with nearby residues having pK(A) values near 6 and 4. Because Y-Z and D1-His190 are located near the Mn cluster, these residues may interact with the Mn cluster in the intact system.									133	1	1	0	92	0	135			0006-2960			WOS:000082834800001	10508388

Thus, in this work, we performed a density functional theory-based global optimization study to determine the physicochemical properties of the most stable Re-Pt gas-phase clusters up to six atoms for all compositions. Our results indicate that in these putative global minima (GM) geometries, Re atoms tend to aggregate, while most Pt atoms remain separated from each other. This is even observed in Pt-rich clusters-an indication of the strength of the Re-Re and Re-Pt bonds over pure Pt-Pt ones-due to a strong, directional hybridization of the Re half-filled 5d and the nearly full Pt 5d states. We observe that doping monometallic Pt clusters even with a single Re atom increases their binding energy values and widens the bimetallic cluster highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital gap. As catalysis occurs at elevated temperatures, we explore the concept of cluster fluxionality for Re-Pt minima in terms of the calculated isomer occupation probability, P(T). This allows us to quantify the abundance of GM and low-energy isomer configurations as a function of temperature. This is done at size 5 atoms due to the wide isomer observed variety. Our calculations indicate that for pure Re-5, the P(T) of the GM configuration substantially decreases after 750 K. Especially, for Re4Pt1, the GM is the dominant structure up to nearly 700 K when the second-energy isomer becomes the stable one. Although no ordering changes are seen for Re3Pt2, Re2Pt3, and Re1Pt4, we do observe a structural transition-between the GM and the second isomer-for pure Pt-5 above 1000 K. We expect this type of combined first-principles analysis to add to the overall, continuous understanding of the stability and energetics of ultrafine and highly-dispersed Re-Pt petroleum-reforming catalysts and the scarce available information on this particular bimetallic system.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000657340700003	34008972

The key component in a PEC cell is the photoanode where light energy is absorbed and transformed into electron-hole pairs of appropriate energy for water photo-oxidation. We report on the synthesis of g-C3N4 materials, with an elongated nano-structure, fabricated by the direct pyrolysis of supramolecular melamine used as a chemical precursor. The as-prepared material was used to host specific amounts of bismuth, a doping element used to adjust the band gap of the hosting matrix. The presence of Bi in the photoanodes was confirmed by energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX) analysis. Powder X-ray (p-XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) measurements performed on the photoanodes confirmed the absence of Bi-based oxides, and showed that bismuth may bonded to nitrogen atoms inside the voids of the g-C3N4 skeleton. Differential reflective spectroscopy (DRS) measurements revealed that the band gap energy was reduced upon introduction of Bi into g-C3N4. From photoluminescence (PL) plots, it was observed that the 2.5% Bi doping induced a 6-fold electron-hole separation, compared to the pristine g-C3N4. PEC water splitting measurements showed that 2.5% Bi doping approximately doubled the activity of g-C3N4 towards water oxidation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements showed that Bi doping was an effective method for decreasing the charge transfer across the electrode/electrolyte interface; 2.5% Bi-g-C3N4 was reduced by around 2.4 times compared to that of pristine g-C3N4. Bode-phase plots accompanied EIS spectra revealed that the lifetime of the photo-generated electrons in neat gC(3)N(4) was improved as a result of Bi doping. The band gaps and the positions of the valence and conduction bands were determined from Mott-Schottky plots.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			0038-092X	1471-1257		WOS:000593734300008

Here, authors report a Z-scheme system utilizing Ir and FeCoOx co-catalysts to enhance charge separation on BiVO4 facets that achieves high quantum efficiencies for overall water splitting.Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) has been widely investigated as a photocatalyst or photoanode for solar water splitting, but its activity is hindered by inefficient cocatalysts and limited understanding of the underlying mechanism. Here we demonstrate significantly enhanced water oxidation on the particulate BiVO4 photocatalyst via in situ facet-selective photodeposition of dual-cocatalysts that exist separately as metallic Ir nanoparticles and nanocomposite of FeOOH and CoOOH (denoted as FeCoOx), as revealed by advanced techniques. The mechanism of water oxidation promoted by the dual-cocatalysts is experimentally and theoretically unraveled, and mainly ascribed to the synergistic effect of the spatially separated dual-cocatalysts (Ir, FeCoOx) on both interface charge separation and surface catalysis. Combined with the H-2-evolving photocatalysts, we finally construct a Z-scheme overall water splitting system using [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-) as the redox mediator, whose apparent quantum efficiency at 420 nm and solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency are optimized to be 12.3% and 0.6%, respectively.									27	0	0	0	2	0	26				2041-1723		WOS:000747410400003	35079003

In this work, two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin FePS3 nanosheets, a typical ternary metal phosphosulfide, are first prepared by ultrasonic exfoliation. The novel 2D/2D heterojunction of FePS3 nanosheets@MXene composite is then successfully synthesized by in situ mixing ultrathin MXene nanosheets with FePS3 nanosheets. The resultant FePS3 nanosheets@MXene hybrids can increase the electronic conductivity and specific surface area, assuring excellent surface and interfacial charge transfer abilities. Furthermore, the unique heterojunction endows FePS3 nanosheets@MXene composite to promote the diffusion of Na+ and alleviate the drastic change in volume in the cyclic process, enhancing the sodium storage capability. Consequently, the few-layered FePS3 nanosheets uniformly coated by ultrathin MXene provide an exceptional reversible capacity of 676.1 mAh g(-1) at the current of 100 mA g(-1) after 90 cycles, which is equivalent to around 90.6% of the second-cycle capacity (746.4 mAh g(-1)). This work provides an original protocol for constructing 2D/2D material and demonstrates the FePS3@MXene composite as a potential anode material with excellent property for sodium-ion batteries.									35	7	0	0	1	0	35			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000519268900001	34138262

Lec-RLKs include legume lectin-like proteins (LLPs), an important group of apoplastic proteins that are expressed in regenerating cell walls and play a role in immune-related responses. However, it is unclear whether LLPs have a function in abiotic stress mitigation and related signaling pathways. Therefore, in this study, we examined the possible role of LLPs in Arabidopsis thaliana (AtLLPs) under various abiotic stresses. Results The study was initiated by analyzing the chromosomal localization, gene structure, protein motif, peptide sequence, phylogeny, evolutionary divergence, and sub-cellular localization of AtLLPs. Furthermore, the expression profiling of these AtLLPs was performed using publicly accessible microarray datasets under various abiotic stresses, which indicated that all AtLLPs were differently expressed in both root and shoot tissues in response to abiotic stresses. The cis-regulatory elements (CREs) analysis in 500 bp promoter sequences of AtLLPs suggested the presence of multiple important CREs implicated for regulating abiotic stress responses, which was further supported by expressional correlation analysis between AtLLPs and their CREs cognate transcription factors (TFs). qRT-PCR analysis of these AtLLPs after 2, 6, and 12 h of cold, high light, oxidative (MV), UV-B, wound, and ozone stress revealed that all AtLLPs displayed differential expression patterns in most of the tested stresses, supporting their roles in abiotic stress response and signaling again. Out of these AtLLPs, AT1g53070 and AT5g03350 appeared to be important players. Furthermore, the mutant line of AT5g03350 exhibited higher levels of ROS than wild type plants till 12 h of exposure to high light, MV, UV-B, and wound, whereas its overexpression line exhibited comparatively lower levels of ROS, indicating a positive role of this gene in abiotic stress response in A. thaliana. Conclusions This study provides basic insights in the involvement of two important representative AtLLPs, AT1g53070 and AT5g03350, in abiotic stress response. However, further research is needed to determine the specific molecular mechanism of these AtLLPs in abiotic stress mitigation and related signaling pathways in A. thaliana.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1471-2164			WOS:000818785400001	35768782

Albeit of its good performance, the high cost and low abundance restricted the utilization of Pt in large-scale photocatalytic H-2 generation. Pt based transition metal alloys are demonstrated to reveal enhanced activities towards various catalytic reactions, suggesting the possibility to substitute Pt as the cocatalyst. In the present work, Pt was partially substituted with Co, Ni, and Fe and Pt-M (M = Co, Ni, and Fe)/g-C3N4 composites were constructed through co-reduction of H2PtCl6 and ansition metal salts by the reductant of ethylene glycol. The crystal structure and valence states were measured by X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS), respectively. The higher degree of XRD peaks and larger binding energies for Pt 4f(5/2) and Pt 4f(7/2) after incorporating Co2+ ions indicated that Co was successfully introduced into the lattice of Pt and Pt-Co bimetallic alloys was attained through the solvothermal treatment. The morphology was subsequently observed by transmission electron microscope (TEM), which showed a good dispersion of Pt-Co nanoparticles on the surface of g-C3N4. Meanwhile, the shrinkage of lattice fringe after introducing cobalt salt further confirmed the presence of Pt-Co bimetallic alloys. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of g-C3N4 and Pt, Pt-Co deposited g-C3N4 were subsequently performed. It was found that the absorption edges were all consistent for all three samples as anticipated, implying that the band gap energy was maintained after hybridizing with Pt or Pt-Co alloys. Furthermore, the photocatalytic H2 generation was carried out over the as-prepared composites with triethanolamine (TEOA) as sacrificial reagent. Under visible-light illumination, the1% (w) Pt2.5M/g-C3N4 (M = Co, Fe, Ni) composites all exhibited higher or comparable activity towards photocatalytic H-2 generation when compared to 1% (w) Pt loaded counterpart. In addition, the atomic ratios of Pt/Co and the loading amount of Pt-Co cocatalyst were modified to optimize the photocatalytic performance, among which, 1% (w) Pt2.5Co/g-C3N4 composite revealed the highest activity with a 1.6-time enhancement. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and photoluminescence (PL) spectra indicated that the enhancement might be attributed to improved charge transfer from g-C3N4 to Pt2.5Co cocatalyst and inhibited charge carrier recombination in the presence of Pt2.5Co cocatalyst. Therefore, the present study demonstrates the great potential to partially replace Pt with low-cost and abundant transition metals and to fabricate Pt based bimetallic alloys as promising cocatalysts for highly efficient photocatalytic H-2 generation.									37	10	0	0	0	0	36			1000-6818			WOS:000521510700005

With respect to the previous efforts to propose an efficient and cost-effective alternative for platinum (Pt) catalysts and cathode electrodes, the present study investigates the assessment of different catalysts to elucidate the potential of the modified SSM cathode electrode for larger-scale MECs. In the case of feeding dairy wastewater to the MEC, the maximum hydrogen production rate and COD removal were obtained by SSM/PANI/graphene cathode and had the values 0.805 m(3) H-2 m(-3) anolyte day(-1) and 82%, respectively, at the applied potential of 1 V. These values were only 20% and 7% lower than those of the MEC with Pt on the carbon cloth cathode, respectively. The coulombic efficiencies of SSM/Pt and SSM/PANI/graphene were seen to be 64.48% and 56.67%, respectively. It was also concluded that the fabrication cost of the modified cathode was 50% lower than the conventional cathodes with Pt on the carbon cloth. Finally, the evaluation of the modified cathode performance was achieved based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, linear sweep voltammetry, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy.

The binuclear species [Mn2O2(O2CCH3)(bpea)2](ClO4)3 (1) was isolated in 41% yield from a MeOH reaction mixture that contained Mn(O2CCH3)3-2H2O, bpea, and aqueous HClO4. Compound 1 crystallizes from CHCl3/ CH3CN/n-hexane as 1.CH3CN.0.5CHCl3 in the triclinic space group P1BAR with a = 12.956 (1) angstrom, b = 12.987 (2) angstrom, c = 13.391 (2) angstrom, alpha = 77.20 (1)-degrees, beta = 83.34 (1)-degrees, gamma = 80.36 (1)-degrees, V = 2158.8 (6) angstrom3, and Z = 2. Bond distances and angles for 1 are consistent with a Mn(IV)2 oxidation state assignment. The variable temperature magnetic susceptibility data for 1 in the range 6-280 K were fit with the expression generated from the isotropic spin Hamiltonian H = -2JS1.S2 (S1 = S2 = 3/2), with J = -124 cm-1. Compound 1 was converted to [Mn3O4(OH)(bpea)3](ClO4)3 (2) in 90% yield by adding an aqueous solution of NaClO4 to a CH3CN solution of 1. Compound 2 crystallizes from CH3CN/C6H5CH3 in the monoclinic space group P2(1)/n with a = 10.875 (4) angstrom, b = 26.074 (9) angstrom, c = 18.437 (5) angstrom, beta = 103.80 (2)-degrees, V = 5077.2 (6) angstrom3, and Z = 4. The structure of 2 consists of three Mn(IV) ions, with two (Mn(b)) being coupled together by two doubly-bridging oxo groups (O(b)) and the third (Mn(a)) being singly-bridged to each Mn(b) atom by oxo groups (O(a)). Atom Mn(a) bears a terminal OH group which is hydrogen bonded to an O(b) group. This interaction appears to be in part responsible for a distortion that brings Mn(a) out of the plane of the two Mn(b) and two O(a) atoms. The EPR spectral properties of 2 are consistent with an S = 3/2 ground state. Magnetic susceptibility data in the range 6-280 K using an applied magnetic field of 5 kG were also consistent with an S = 3/2 ground state and were fit using the Hamiltonian H = -2J(S1.S2) - 2J'(S1.S3 + S2.S3) (S1 = S2 = S3 = 3/2; J = -76 cm-1, J' = -11 cm-1). Both 1 and 2 were further characterized with UV-vis, infrared, and electrochemical measurements. The relationship between 2 and two other species that contain the {Mn3O4}4+ core is discussed. The similarity between the ground spin state variability for synthetic trinuclear manganese oxo complexes and the manganese site in photosystem II is noted.									117	0	0	0	8	0	117			0002-7863			WOS:A1992JF87100016

Bare and V-modified alpha-Fe2O3 photoelectrode materials were prepared using hydrothermal, chemical bath deposition and heat treatment approaches. Their physicochemical and photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties were then investigated with X-ray diffractometry (XRD), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS), voltammetry, and electrochemical AC impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. The existence of FeVO4 was indicated by its characteristic X-ray diffractometry patterns, while no significant red shifts in the photoabsorption edge were detected in UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy spectra. With V-modified and bare Fe2O3 serving as a photoanode, photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out for water splitting in 1 mol.L-1 NaOH (pH 13.6). The enhancement of alpha-Fe2O3 photoelectrochemical activities through V-modification was indicated by significantly increased photocurrents and decreased photocharge-recombination probability. By measuring electrochemical AC impedance spectroscopy spectra, pseudo-first-order rate constants for the charge transfer at the illuminated electrode/solution interface were estimated. The rate constant for V-modification of the Fe2O3 electrode was higher than that of the bare Fe2O3 electrode. Improved interfacial charge transfer kinetics through V-modification is responsible for the enhanced photoelectrochemical activities of alpha-Fe2O3. The interfacial photocharge transfer and recombination processes and their properties are discussed with a semiconductor energy band model constructed for the electrode system.									3	2	0	0	2	0	3			1000-6818			WOS:000363712300007

The observed spectrum free of contributions from the acceptor side signals was achieved by employing 2 mM/18 mM ferri-/ferrocyanide as a redox couple, This spectrum showed main positive bands at 1589 and 1365 cm(-1) and negative bands at 1560, 1541, 1522 and 1507 cm(-1). GO-depleted PSII preparations showed a quite different spectrum. The main positive and negative bands disappeared after depiction of bicarbonate,The addition of bicarbonate partially restored those bands again. Comparison between difference FT-IR spectra of untreated and bicarbonate-depleted PSII membranes indicated that the positive bands at 1589 and 1365 cm(-1) can be assigned to COO- stretching modes from bicarbonate. The higher frequency corresponds to u(as) (COO-) and the lon er frequency to u(s) (COO-). C-13-Labeling FT-IR measurements confirmed these findings and also suggested that the negative band at 1560 cm(-1) can be ascribed to u(as) (COO-). The data are discussed in the framework of the suggestion that bicarbonate can be a ligand to the Mn-containing water-oxidizing complex of PSII.

The basic Hp molecule is a tetrameric protein built by two alpha/beta dimers. Each Hp alpha/beta dimer is encoded by a single gene and is synthesized as a single polypeptide. Following posttranslational protease-dependent cleavage of the Hp polypeptide, the alpha and beta chains are linked by disulfide bridge(s) to generate the mature Hp protein. As human Hp gene is characterized by two common Hp1 and Hp2 alleles, three major genotypes can result (i.e., Hp1-1, Hp2-1, and Hp2-2). Hp regulates Hb clearance from circulation by the macrophage-specific receptor CD163, thus preventing Hb-mediated severe consequences for health. Indeed, the antioxidant and Hb binding properties of Hp as well as its ability to stimulate cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage and to modulate the helper T-cell type 1 and type 2 balance significantly associate with a variety of pathogenic disorders (e.g., infectious diseases, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer). Alternative functions of the variants Hp1 and Hp2 have been reported, particularly in the susceptibility and protection against infectious (e.g., pulmonary tuberculosis, HIV, and malaria) and non-infectious (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and obesity) diseases. Both high and low levels of Hp are indicative of clinical conditions: Hp plasma levels increase during infections, inflammation, and various malignant diseases, and decrease during malnutrition, hemolysis, hepatic disease, allergic reactions, and seizure disorders. Of note, the Hp:Hb complexes display heme-based reactivity; in fact, they bind several ferrous and ferric ligands, including O-2, CO, and NO, and display (pseudo-)enzymatic properties (e.g., NO and peroxynitrite detoxification). Here, genetic, biochemical, biomedical, and biotechnological aspects of Hp are reviewed.									32	0	2	0	15	0	33			0098-2997	1872-9452		WOS:000581154400001	32660714

The use of a new commercially available multichannel plate with rapid gating permitted a sufficient suppression of detector distortions due to the strong prompt fluorescence. The following results were obtained: (a) in dark-adapted thylakoids, the DP amplitudes at 100 ns and 5 mu s after each flash of a train of saturating actinic pulses exhibit characteristic period four oscillations of opposite sign: the DF amplitudes at 100 ns oscillate in the same manner as the quantum yield of prompt fluorescence, whereas those at 5 mu s resemble the oscillation of the mu s kinetics of P680+(.) reduction in samples with an intact water oxidizing complex, (b) the quantum yield of total DF emission in the range up to a few mu s is estimated to be < 10(-4) for thylakoids, (c) the DF of D1/D2/Cytb-559 exhibits a monophasic decay with tau approximate to 50 ns, (d) DF emission is also observed in isolated LHCII with biphasic decay kinetics characterized by tau values of 65 ns and about 800 ns, (e) in contrast to thylakoids, the amplitudes of DE in D1/D2/Cytb-559 preparations and solubilized LHCII do not exhibit any oscillation pattern and (f) all spectra of DF from the different sample types are characteristic for emission from the lowest excited singlet state of chlorophyll a.

However, the guidelines for designing hybrid materials with advantageous structures and the fundamental understanding of their electrocatalytic mechanisms remain unclear. Herein, superfine Pt and PtCu nanoparticles supported by novel S,N-co-doped multi-walled CNT (MWCNTs) were prepared through the innovative pyrolysis of a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/polyaniline copolymer as a source of S and N. The uniform wrapping of the copolymer around the MWCNTs provides a high density of evenly distributed defects on the surface after the pyrolysis treatment, facilitating the uniform distribution of ultrafine Pt and PtCu nanoparticles. Remarkably, the Pt1Cu2/SN-MWCNTs show an obviously larger electroactive surface area and higher mass activity, stability, and CO poisoning resistance in methanol oxidation compared to Pt/SN-MWCNTs, Pt/S-MWCNTs, Pt/N-MWCNTs, and commercial Pt/C. Density functional theory studies confirm that the co-doping of S and N considerably deforms the CNTs and polarizes the adjacent C atoms. Consequently, both the adsorption of Pt1Cu2 onto the SN-MWCNTs and the subsequent adsorption of methanol are enhanced; in addition, the catalytic activity of Pt1Cu2/SN-MWCNTs for methanol oxidation is thermodynamically and kinetically more favorable than that of its CNT and N-CNT counterparts. This work provides a novel method to fabricate high-performance fuel cell electrocatalysts with highly dispersed and stable Pt-based nanoparticles on a carbon substrate.

However, the photocatalytic activity is restricted by the high charge recombination rate and limited sunlight utilization. Herein, black phosphorus (BP) with a broad sunlight response range was utilized as a photosensitizer to enhance the photocatalytic performance of the Au/carbon nitride (CN) heterostructure. The as-prepared BP/Au/CN exhibited a significantly enhanced H2 generation rate of 1400.8 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) under UV-vis light irradiation, which is almost 70 times higher than that of bare CN and BP/CN and 2 folds higher than that of the Au/CN heterojunction. Specifically, the optimal BP/Au/CN sample presented a waste-to-hydrogen pro- duction rate of 195.8 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) with the degradation of bisphenol A, verifying the synergistic effect of the ternary heterojunction. The photocatalytic mechanism was systematically studied by the combination of experiments and theoretical calculations. The improved photocatalytic performance was derived from the overall sunlight absorption ability of BP, effective electron transfer media and plasmonic character of Au nanoparticles, as well as the matched work function and strong interaction of the three components. A unidirectional electron transfer from BP to Au and then to CN was established, which effectively improved the charge transfer capability, resulting from the appropriate Ohmic contact of Au and BP and the Schottky barrier constructed in Au/CN hybrid.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000729356100001

Drought treatment increased all points of the OJIP curves in FB200 plants. With water stress, reductions of Delta V-OP occurred in FB300 only in J-I phase, while all phases from OJIP curve were reduced in FB200. J-I phase showed signals of recovery within six days in FB200 but this period of rewatering was not sufficient for recovery of O-J and I-P phases. There was total recovery of Delta V-OP, values in FB300 followed by an increment of efficiency which an electron is transfer to photosystem I (PSI) acceptor side, evidenced by a positive increase of I-P phase after stress. To FB200, L and K-band increased after five days of water stress with partial recovery after one week rewatering. But, to FB300, significant difference of bands was only observed at 11 days from water withholding and the difference between water treatments was very evident, with total recovery after rewatering. On the day of maximum stress, the maximum efficiency of PSII (F-v/F-m ratio) decreased significantly in both passion cultivars while the effective antenna size of an active reaction center (ABS/RC) values increased 24 and 11% in FB200 and FB300, respectively. With rewatering of plants, declines of F-v/F-m values persisted by at least three days in FB200 passion cultivar. Also, increases of ABS/RC in FB200 (+110%) was irreversible and persisted until the six day after rewatering. These findings showed that two passion cultivars differed in the plasticity of their response to drought and rewatering and further shows that under drought conditions the FB300 plants possess an advantage over FB200 plants in terms of stability and efficiency in utilizing energy. Measurements of OJJIP fluorescence transients, F-v/F-m and ABS/RC ratios, analyzed using the JIP-test, were good tools for the screening of the potential to cope with and to recover from drought.

To investigate the association between MnSOD Val16Ala polymorphism and risk of advanced gastric lesions, and its effects on chemoprevention, a population-based study was conducted in Linqu, a high-risk area of gastric cancer in China.Methods: Genotypes were determined by PCR-RFLP analysis in 3,355 subjects with the baseline histopathologic diagnosis in 1994, and 2,758 of these subjects received subsequent three interventions including vitamin supplementation for 7.3 years. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated by unconditional logistic regression model.Results: We found an increased risk of dysplasia in subjects with the Val/Ala+ Ala/Ala genotype (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.02-1.68) compared with the Val/Val genotype. Stratified analysis indicated that a significantly elevated risk of intestinal metaplasia (OR, 3.40; 95% CI, 2.64-4.38) or dysplasia (OR, 4.01; 95% CI, 2.79-5.74) was found in subjects carrying the Val/Ala+ Ala/Ala genotype and Helicobacter pylori infection, and an interaction between this genotype and a high serum H. pylori IgG titer (> 2.94) on the risk of dysplasia was observed (Pinteraction = 0.01). Furthermore, an elevated chance for regression of gastric lesions was observed in subjects with the Val/Ala+ Ala/Ala genotype and high IgG titer in an intervention trial with vitamin supplementation (OR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.37-4.38).Conclusions: These findings suggest that Val16Ala polymorphism may play an important role in development of advanced gastric lesions and modify the effect of vitamin supplementation on the evolution of gastric lesions. Impact: Val16Ala polymorphism is related to gastric cancer development. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 19(4); 1089-97.

J	ZAREMBINSKI, TI; THEOLOGIS, A								ANAEROBIOSIS AND PLANT-GROWTH HORMONES INDUCE 2 GENES ENCODING 1-AMINOCYCLOPROPANE-1-CARBOXYLATE SYNTHASE IN RICE (ORYZA-SATIVA L)								MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF THE CELL				4	4			363	373		10.1091/mbc.4.4.363				APR 1993	1993	The plant hormone ethylene is believed to be responsible for the ability of rice to grow in the deepwater regions of Southeast Asia. Ethylene production is induced by hypoxia, which is caused by flooding, because of enhanced activity of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase, the key enzyme in the ethylene biosynthetic pathway. We have cloned three divergent members, (OS-ACS1, OS-ACS2, and OS-ACS3), of a multigene family encoding ACC synthase in rice. OS-ACS1 resides on chromosome 3 and OS-ACS3 on chromosome 5 in the rice genome. The OS-ACS1 and OS-ACS3 genes are induced by anaerobiosis and indoleacetic and (IAA) + benzyladenine (BA) + LiCl treatment. The anaerobic induction is differential and tissue specific; OS-ACSI is induced in the shoots, whereas OS-ACS3 is induced in the roots. These inductions are insensitive to protein synthesis inhibitors, suggesting that they are primary responses to the inducers. All three genes are actually induced when protein synthesis is inhibited, indicating that they may be under negative control or that their mRNAs are unstable. The OS-ACSI gene was structurally characterized, and the function of its encoded protein (M(r) = 53 112 Da, pI 8.2) was confirmed by expression experiments in Escherichia coli. The protein contains all eleven invariant amino acid residues that are conserved between aminotransferases and ACC synthases cloned from various dicotyledonous plants. The amino acid sequence shares significant identity to other ACC synthases (69-34%) and is more similar to sequences in other plant species (69% with the tomato LE-ACS3) than to other rice ACC synthases (50-44%). The data suggest that the extraordinary degree of divergence among ACC synthase isoenzymes within each species arose early in plant evolution and before the divergence of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants.									110	5	0	0	96	0	120			1059-1524	1939-4586		WOS:A1993KY66700002	8389618

An innovative carbonate (CO32-)-mediated method to synchronously enhance the catalytic activity and stability of TMCs was developed herein. In a model PMS/Co3O4 nanowire system for bisphenol A (BPA) degradation, the first-order kinetic constant and total organic carbon removal ratio were increased by 202.27% and 71.32% upon adding CO32-, respectively. Meanwhile, the cobalt release amount was significantly reduced from 4.90 to 0.03 mg/L, and the number of reuse with high efficiency (> 90% of BPA removal within 10 min) was augmented from 1 to 3 times. The CO32- buffered pH decline to repress metal leakage, and promoted Co(III) reduction into Co(II) to avoid the over-oxidation of catalyst. Under the driving of CO32-, the dominated reactive species were switched from center dot OH/SO4 center dot- to O-1(2) accompanying the migration of catalytic center from Co(II) to Co(III). The Co(III) and CO32-/OH- acted as electron and proton acceptors, respectively, to accelerate PMS decomposition into SO5 center dot- and subsequent generation of vast O-1(2). This work proposes a green way to construct novel O-1(2)-based catalytic systems with excellent activity and stability for pollution remediation.									34	2	0	0	17	0	36			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000532829200056	32135366

We have further studied the STR7 mutant, which showed the highest level of resistance to atrazine as well as a cross-resistance to 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)1,1-dimethylurea (50- and 3-fold, respectively, compared with the wild type). Sequencing of the psbA gene (coding for the D1 polypeptide of photosystem II) from this mutant revealed a single change, serine-268 to proline, in the D1 protein. To our knowledge, this substitution has not previously been described in any photosynthetic organism. In addition to affecting atrazine resistance, this single amino acid change caused a decrease in the electron transfer rate between the secondary accepters Q(A) and Q(B) and a stabilization of the S(2)Q(B)(-) and S(3)Q(B)(-) states. The mutant also showed a larger antenna size, an increase in non-Q(B)-reducing centers, and a higher sensitivity to light stress. The unusual stability of the S(2)Q(B)(-) and S(3)Q(B)(-) states indicates that STR7 belongs to a new class of Q(B)-site mutants.									28	1	0	0	29	0	32			0032-0889			WOS:A1996VY30400013	8972596	
J	Ghirardi, ML; Lutton, TW; Seibert, M								Effects of carboxyl amino acid modification on the properties of the high-affinity, manganese-binding site in photosystem II								BIOCHEMISTRY				37	39			13559	13566		10.1021/bi980358w				SEP 29 1998	1998	Our previous work using the "diphenylcarbazide (DPC)-inhibition assay" has identified-four amino acid (two carboxyls and two histidyls) ligands to four Mn2+ bound with high affinity on Tris-washed photosystem II (PSII) membrane fragments [Preston and Seibert (1991) Biochemistry 30, 9615-9624, 9625-9633]. One of the ligands binds a photooxidizable Mn, specifically, and the others bind either nonphotooxidizable Mn2+, Zn2+, or Co2+ [Ghirardi et all (1996) Biochemistry 35, 1820-1828]. The current paper shows the following: (a) the high-affinity photooxidizable Mn, which donates to the oxidized primary PSII donor (Y-z(.)), is bound to a carboxyl residue with a K-M = 1.5 mu M or K-d = 0.44 mu M in the absence of DPC, and a K-i = 1.3 mu M in the presence of DPC (both steady-state and flash approaches were used); (b) if this carboxyl is chemically modified using 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl] carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), Mn2+ is photooxidized at a lower affinity (K-d = 25 mu M) site that does not involve carboxyl ligands; (c) low-affinity Mn is photooxidized (possibly by Y-D(.), the oxidized form of the alternative PSII donor) with a K-M = 220 mu M at a completely different site that also requires a carboxyl ligand; (d) photooxidation of high-affinity DPC by Y-Z(.) with a K-M of 40-42 mu M or K-d of 49-58 mu M occurs at a site that does not require carboxyl residues; (e) photooxidation of low-affinity DPC with a K-M = 1200 mu M occurs at a site (possibly near Y-D) that is not affected by carboxyl modification with EDC. Due to the similarities between the binding of the high-affinity photooxidizable Mn to EDC-treated membranes and to PSII complexes from Asp 170D1 mutants [Nixon and Diner (1992) Biochemistry 31, 942-948], we identify its carboxyl residue ligand as Asp170 on D1, one of the reaction-center proteins. The second carboxyl ligand identified using the DPC-inhibition assay binds Mn (but not a photooxidizable one), Zn, or Co ions. At least one of the two histidyl ligands (either His337 on D1 or another unidentified histidyl) that bind nonphotooxidizable, high-affinity Mn2+ also binds Zn2+ and Co2+.									28	1	0	0	25	0	28			0006-2960			WOS:000076367900014	9753442	
J	Gautier, D; Hersant, F								Formation and composition of planetesimals - Trapping volatiles by clathration								SPACE SCIENCE REVIEWS				116	1-2			25	52		10.1007/s11214-005-1946-2				2005	2005	The composition of planetesimals depends upon the epoch and the location of their formation in the solar nebula. Meteorites produced in the hot inner nebula contain refractory compounds. Volatiles were present in icy planetesimals and cometesimals produced in the cold outer nebula. However, the mechanism responsible for their trapping is still controversial. We argue for a general scenario valid in all regions of the turbulent nebula where water condensed as a crystalline ice (Hersant et al., 2004). Volatiles were trapped in the form of clathrate hydrates in the continuously cooling nebula. The epoch of clathration of a given species depends upon the temperature and the pressure required for the stability of the clathrate hydrate. The efficiency of the mechanism depends upon the local amount of ice available. This scenario is the only one so far which proposes a quantitative interpretation of the non detection of N-2 in several comets of the Oort cloud (fro et al., 2003). It may explain the large variation of the CO abundance observed in comets and predicts an Ar/O ratio much less than the upper limit of 0.1 times the solar ratio estimated on C/2001 A2 (Weaver et al., 2002). Under the assumption that the amount of water ice present at 5 AU was higher than the value corresponding to the solar O/H ratio by a factor 2.2 at least, the clathration scenario reproduces the quasi uniform enrichment with respect to solar of the Ar, Kr, Xe, C, N and S elements measured in Jupiter by the Galileo probe. The interpretation of the non-uniform enrichment in C, N and S in Saturn requires that ice was less abundant at 10 AU than at 5 AU so that CO and N-2 were not clathrated in the feeding zone of the planet while CH4, NH3 and H2S were. As a result, the N-14/N-15 ratio in Saturn should be intermediate between that in Jupiter and the terrestrial ratio. Ar and Kr should be solar while Xe should be enriched by a factor 17. The enrichments in C, N and S in Uranus and Neptune suggest that available ice was able to form clathrates of CH4, CO and the NH3 hydrate, but not the clathrate of N-2. The enrichment of oxygen by a factor 440 in Neptune inferred by Lodders and Fegley (1994) from the detection of CO in the troposphere of the planet is higher by at least a factor 2.5 than the lower limit of O/H required for the clathration of CO and CH4 and for the hydration of NH3. If CO detected by Encrenaz et al. (2004) in Uranus originates from the interior of the planet, the O/H ratio in the envelope must be around of order of 260 times the solar ratio, then also consistent with the trapping of detected volatiles by clathration. It is predicted that Ar and Kr are solar in the two planets while Xe would be enriched by a factor 30 to 70. Observational tests of the validity of the clathration scenario are proposed.									42	0	0	0	0	0	42			0038-6308	1572-9672		WOS:000229582300004

The aim of this work is to apply bone char (BBC) into persulfate (PS) activation system and achieve efficient 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) degradation. This work first applied de-fatted swine bone as the biochar precursor. The as-prepared BBC has considerable high surface area (1024.34m(2)/g) and wide porous distribution. Especially the hierarchical porous structure is supposed to accelerate the electrons transfer in this catalytic process. The results showed that over 85% of 2, 4-DCP can be removed in 30 min and almost 100% of 2, 4-DCP can be completely degraded in 2 h. Further research found that 2, 4-DCP was eliminated by both radical and non-radical pathway, and radical pathway dominated the catalytic process in BBC/PS system. (OH)-O-center dot, SO4 center dot-, O-2(center dot-) and O-1(2) all contributed to this system, among which the (OH)-O-center dot played the most significant role. Liner Sweep Voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were taken to verify the non-radical pathway did exist in this system. Owing to the existence of multiple mechanisms, the BBC/PS system remained highly efficient in real surface water and it had remarkable adaptability to various environment conditions. This research commits to proposing a novel strategy for green remediation of contaminated water.									83	4	0	0	48	1	85			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000504404800107

The gas concentrations in the packages, pH, mesophilic counts, and weight loss were also determined. Lighting caused an increase in physiological activity. Asparagus stored under lighting achieved atmospheres with higher CO2 and lower O-2 content than samples kept in the dark. This activity increase explains the greater deterioration experienced by samples stored under lighting, which clearly affected texture and especially color, accelerating the appearance of greenish hues in the tips and reddish-brown hues in the spears. Exposure to light had a negative effect on the quality parameters of the asparagus and it caused a significant reduction in shelf life. Hence, the 11 d shelf life of samples kept in the dark was reduced to only 3 d in samples kept under red and green light, and to 7 d in those kept under white and blue light. However, quality indicators such as the color of the tips and texture showed significantly better behavior under blue light than with white light, which allows us to state that it is better to use this type of light or blue-tinted packaging film for the display of minimally processed asparagus to consumers.									25	0	0	0	8	0	25			0022-1147	1750-3841		WOS:000268634400062	19723236

Herein, for the first time, 2D nonstoichiometric WO3-x nanoflakes (NFs) were vertically grown by hydrothermal synthesis on 1D WO3 nanorods (NRs) obtained by a hydrothermal method and high-temperature annealing (HTA). In this 1D HTA-WO3/2D WO3-x photoanode, the 2D WO3-x NFs with active areas could maximize light harvesting, and the unique 1D/2D homojunction structure could improve the carrier-separation efficiency. At the same time, the 1D WO3 NRs with high aspect ratio were more beneficial to charge transfer after HTA. As expected, the 1D HTA-WO3/2D WO3-x photoanode yielded an enhanced photocurrent density of 0.98 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, which is approximately 3.16 times that of pristine WO3. The improvement could be attributed to the synergistic effect of HTA and the homojunction structure in the 1D HTA-WO3/2D WO3-x photoanode, which could effectively improve carrier separation and transfer. Furthermore, this work may provide a promising strategy for the design and fabrication of semiconductor-based photoelectrodes.									37	0	0	0	2	0	37			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000498966500001	31659855

species (ROS) mediated by dual oxidase (Duox) is an important immune mechanism to regulate the dynamic balance of insect intestinal microorganisms.The objective of this study is to analyze the sequence characteristics and expression patterns of SeDuox from Spodoptera exigua,explore the effect of SeDuox silencing on the intestinal bacterial load of host by RNAi and analyze the immune response of SeDuox to Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt),so as to clarify the role of SeDuox in the intestinal immune regulation of insects,and provide new ideas and targets for the comprehensive control of S.exigua.【Method】The SeDuox was cloned by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR),and the sequence characteristics were analyzed by bioinformatics.The phylogenetic tree was constructed by ClustalX and MEGA_X software.The extramembrane fragment of SeDuox (91-1 767 bp) named SeDuox-OM was cloned by PCR.The Bacmid-SeDuox-OM was constructed using the Bac to Bac expression system and transfected into the Sf9 insect cells by liposome transfection to express SeDuox-OM.Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to analyze the expression level of SeDuox in different tissues (peritrophic membrane,hemolymph,fat body,Malpighian tubules,midgut,epidermis) and developmental stages (egg,1st- to 5th-instar larvae,female pupa,male pupa).The 4th instar larvae were injected with dsSeDuox using RNAi technology for functional analysis,with dsGFP as control group.The efficiency of gene silence and intestinal bacterial load changes were detected at 48 h and 72 h after injection.In addition,Bt was fed to S.exigua larvae to detect relative expression of SeDuox and related immune genes by RT-qPCR.【Result】The length of open reading frame (ORF) of SeDuox is 4 497 bp,encoding 1 498 amino acids,and the deduced molecular weight of protein is 171.62 kD.SMART analysis showed that SeDuox domain is similar to that of Spodoptera litura,Spodoptera frugiperda,including peroxidase domain,nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide binding domain (NAD),N-terminal calcium binding domain (EFH),iron reductase binding domain (Ferric) and flavin adenie dinucleotide binding domain (FAD).TMHMM analysis showed that there are seven transmembrane regions.The transmembrane fragment named SeDuox-OM was successfully expressed about 80 kD recombinant protein in insect cells.The results of RT-qPCR showed that SeDuox was expressed in different tissues of the 4th instar larvae of S.exigua,and the expression level was higher in peritrophic membrane and midgut.It was expressed in each developmental stage,and highly expressed at the egg stage.Compared with dsGFP injection,dsSeDuox injection significantly reduced the expression of SeDuox,which was reduced by 62.08% and 74.94% at 48 h and 72 h,respectively,and the load of intestinal microbial in S.exigua larvae was significantly increased.Compared with the control group,the expression level of SeDuox was significantly increased at 48 h after being fed on Bt GS36.With the extension of infection time,the expression level of SeDuox was increased at first,then decreased and turned to stabilize finally.【Conclusion】SeDuox contains conserved domains,which is highly expressed in the midgut and perinogphic matrix.SeDuox plays an important role in the regulation of host intestinal immunity,it probably has synergistic effect with antimicrobial peptide gene against Bt infection.			【目的】昆虫双重氧化酶(dual oxidase,Duox)介导产生活性氧(reactive oxygen species,ROS)是调节昆虫肠道微生物动态平衡的重要免疫机制。本研究通过分析甜菜夜蛾(Spodoptera

Structural modification and engineering of various materials based on g-C3N4 have been attempted to achieve solar energy harvesting, slow charge transfer and efficiency. Here we report synthesis of all metal free self-assembled carbon quantum dots and reduced graphene oxide layers modified S@g-C3N4/B@g-C3N4 (CRSB) photocatalyst for visible and solar degradation of chloramphenicol (CMP) (10 mg L-1). Differently doped g-C3N4 with different band structure forms a junction which grows into an effective Z-scheme photocatalyst. Extended visible absorption is achieved with optimized modification by reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and carbon quantum dots. The optical response, band structure and charge separation efficiency were tested by optical absorption, electrochemical impedance, Mott-Schottky plots and photo-luminescence. CQDs convert a typical type-II mechanism into effective Z-scheme transfer. For the best sample CRSB 99.1% CMP was photo-degraded in 90 min exposure to visible light and retention of high activity in natural solar light (92.4% in 120 min). A stable heterojunction has been attempted to design using boron doped g-C3N4 and sulphur doped g-C3N4 with different band positions via ratio optimization with enhanced charge transfer. The degradation rate for CRSB (0.0810 min(-1)) is 10 times than bare g-C3N4 (0.00802 min(-1)). The optimized combination of carbon quantum dots and RGO with intimate interfacial contact for charge flow & reduced recombination, better adsorption of pollutant, high visible absorption and production of reactive oxygen species. The effect of pH, electrolytes and water matrix was studied for CMP degradation. The mechanism of degradation and mineralization was confirmed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis, scavenging experiments and electron spin resonance. It was observed that the chances of O-center dot(2)- and (OH)-O-center dot radicals increased on the formation of the junction as compared to individual doped and bare carbon nitride. The mineralization was ensured by high total organic removal and cyto-toxicity studies of treated water sample onto human peripheral blood (PBL) cells with high cell viability equivalent to untreated cells. This experiment supports the competence of optimally designed metal free and environmentally friendly cost-effective catalysts with higher photocatalytic efficiency for removal of hazardous pollutants.

J	Wang, Yiqing; Shen, Shaohua								Progress and Prospects of Non-Metal Doped Graphitic Carbon Nitride for Improved Photocatalytic Performances								ACTA PHYSICO-CHIMICA SINICA				36	3					UNSP 1905080	10.3866/PKU.WHXB201905080				2020	2020	Since Fujishima and Honda demonstrated the photoelectrochemical water splitting on TiO2 photoanode and Pt counter electrode, photocatalysis has been considered as one of the most promising technologies for solving both the problems of environmental pollution and energy shortage. This process can effectively use solar energy, the most abundant energy resource on the earth, to drive various catalytic reactions, such as water splitting, CO2 reduction, organic pollutant degradation, and organic synthesis, for energy generation and environmental purification. Except for the various metal-based semiconductors, such as metal oxides, metal sulfides, and metal oxynitrides, developed for photocatalysis, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has attracted significant attention in the recent years because of its earth abundancy, non-toxicity, good stability, and relatively narrow band gap (2.7 eV) for visible light response. However, g-C3N4 suffers from insufficient absorption of visible light in the solar spectrum and rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, thus resulting in low photocatalytic activity. Until now, various strategies have been developed to enhance the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4, including element doping, nanostructure and heterostructure design, and co-catalyst decoration. Among these methods, element doping has been found to be very effective for adjusting the unique electronic and molecular structures of g-C3N4, which could significantly expand the range of photoresponse under visible light and improve the charge separation. Especially, non-metal doping has been well investigated frequently to improve the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4. The non-metal dopants commonly used for the doping of g-C3N4 include oxygen (O), phosphorus (P), sulfur (S), boron (B), and halogen (F, CI, Br, I) and also carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) (for self-doping), as they are easily accessible and can be introduced into the g-C3N4 framework through different physical and chemical synthetic methods. In this review article, the structural and optical properties of g-C3N4 is introduced first, followed by a brief introduction to the modification of g-C3N4 as photocatalysts. Then, the progress in the non-metal doped g-C3N4 with improved photocatalytic activity is reviewed in detail, with the photocatalytic mechanisms presented for easy understanding of the fundamentals of photocatalysis and for guiding in the design of novel g-C3N4 photocatalysts. Finally, the prospects of the modification of g-C3N4 for further advances in photocatalysis is presented.									60	14	0	0	6	0	62			1000-6818			WOS:000501224400008		
J	FARINEAU, J; LAVALMARTIN, D								OXYGEN-EVOLVING SYSTEM AND SECONDARY QUINONIC ACCEPTORS ARE HIGHLY REDUCED IN DARK ADAPTED EUGLENA CELLS - A THERMOLUMINESCENCE STUDY								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				32	3			167	180		10.1007/BF00034793				JUN 1992	1992	Characteristics of thermoluminescence glow curves were compared in three types of Euglena cells: (i) strictly autotrophic, Cramer and Myers cells; (ii) photoheterotrophic cells sampled from an exponentially growing culture containing lactate as substrate repressing the photosynthetic activity; (iii) semiautotrophic cells, sampled when the lactate being totally exhausted, the photosynthesis was enhanced.In autotrophic and semiautotrophic cells, composite curves were observed after series of two or more actinic flashes fired at -10-degrees-C, which can be deconvoluted into a large band peaking in the range 12-22-degrees-C and a smaller one near 40-degrees-C. This second band presents the characteristics of a typical B band (due to S2/3Q(B)- recombination), whereas the first one resembled the band, shifted by -15-20-degrees-C, which is observed in herbicide resistant plants. The amplitude of this major band, which was in all cases very low after one flash, exhibited oscillations of period four but rapidly damping, with maxima after two and six flashes. In contrast, photoheterotrophic Euglena displayed single, non-oscillating curves with maxima in the range 5-10-degrees-C.In autotrophic and semiautotrophic cells, oxidizing pretreatments by either a preillumination with one or more (up to twenty-five) flashes, or a far-red preillumination in the presence of methylviologen, followed by a short dark period, induced thermoluminescence bands almost single and shifted by +3-5-degrees-C, or +12-degrees-C, respectively. In autotrophic cells, far-red light plus methyl viologen treatment induced a band peaking at 31-degrees-C, as in isolated thylakoids from Euglena or higher plants, while it had barely any effect in photoheterotrophic cells.Due to metabolic activities in dark-adapted cells, a reduction of redox groups at the donor and acceptor sides of PS 11 dark-adapted cells is supposed to occur. Two different explanations can be proposed to explain such a shift in the position of the main band in dark-adapted autotrophic control. The first explanation would be that in these reducing conditions a decreasing value of the equilibrium constant for the reaction: S(n)Q(A)-Q(B) half arrow right over half arrow left S(n)Q(A)Q(B)-, WoUld determine the shift of the main TL band towards low temperatures, as observed in herbicide resistant material. The second explanation would be that the main band would correspond to 'peak III' already observed in vivo and assigned to S2/3Q(B)2-recombinations.									7	0	0	0	6	0	7			0166-8595			WOS:A1992JD30800002	24408358

However, the limited active sites and restricted conductivity prevent their further application. Herein, a polarization boosted strategy is put forward for the modification of TMDs to promote the absorption of the intermediates, leading to the improved catalytic performance. By the forced assembly of TMDs (WS2 as the example) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) via spray-drying method, such frameworks can remarkably achieve low overpotentials and superior durability in alkaline media, which is superior to most of the TMDs-based catalysts. The two-electrode cell for water-splitting also exhibits perfect activity and stability. The enhanced catalytic performance of WS2/CNTs composite is mainly owing to the strong polarized coupling between CNTs and WS2 nanosheets, which significantly promotes the charge redistribution on the interface of CNTs and WS2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the CNTs enrich the electron content of WS2, which favors electron transportation and accelerates the catalysis. Moreover, the size of WS2 is restricted caused by the confinement of CNTs, leading to the increased numbers of active sites, further improving the catalysis. This work opens a feasible route to achieve the optimized assembling of TMDs and CNTs for efficient water-splitting process.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000657391700001	34081390

Few published literatures have discussed the liver injury mechanisms induced by AVM on birds. In this study, pigeons were exposed to feed containing AVM (0, 20, 40 and 60 mg/kg diet) for 30, 60, 90 days respectively. The results showed that AVM increased the number of apoptosis and the expression level of caspase-3, 8, fas mRNA in the liver of pigeons. Ultrastructural alterations, including mitochondrial damage and chromatin aggregation, become severe with increase exposure dose. Exposure to AVM induced significant changes in antioxidant enzyme {superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px)} activities and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, augmented protein carbonyl (PCO) content and DNA-protein crosslink (DPC) coefficient, in a concentration-dependent manner in the liver of pigeons. Our results show that AVM has toxic effect in pigeon liver, and the mechanism of injury caused by AVM is closely related to apoptosis and oxidative stress. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT), the hydrogen adsorption was found to be unfavorable on high-band-gap insulators, which could be attributed to a lower energy level associated with adsorbed hydrogen relative to the bottom of the conduction band. In contrast, the hydrogen adsorption was shown to be the most favorable on metallic and semiconducting compounds, which results from an electron transfer from adsorbed hydrogen to the Fermi level or the bottom of the conduction band. Of significance, computed hydrogen adsorption energetics on insulating, semiconducting, and metallic oxides; phosphates; fluorides; and sulfides were decreased by lowering the ligand p band center, while the energy penalty for ligand vacancy formation was increased, indicative of decreased surface reducibility. A statistical regression analysis, where 16 structural and electronic parameters such as metal-ligand distance, electronegativity difference, Bader charges, bulk and surface metal and ligand band centers, band gap, ligand band width, and work function were examined, further showed that the surface ligand p band center is the most accurate single descriptor that governs the hydrogen adsorption tendency, and additional considerations of the band gap and average metal-ligand distance further reconcile the differences among compounds with different ligands/structures, whose ligand bands are different in shape and width. We discuss the implications of these findings for passivating coatings and design of catalysts and the need for novel theoretical methods to accurately estimate these quantities from first principles. These results establish a universal design principle for future high-throughput studies aiming to design electrode surfaces to minimize electrolyte oxidation by dehydrogenation in Li-ion batteries and enhance the H-H and C-H activation for selective oxidation catalysis.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000480826900014

The PSII core complex of hf-2, as compared with that of the wild type, showed structural fragility when solubilized with a detergent, dodecyl beta-D-altoside, suggesting that the physical properties of the PSII complex were altered by the loss of SQDG. On the other hand, exposure of the cells to 41 degreesC for 120 min in the dark decreased the PSII activity to 70% and 50% of the initial levels in the wild type and hf-2, respectively, which implies that the PSII activity, in the absence of SQDG, becomes less stable under heat-stress conditions. PSII inactivated to 60% of the initial level by dark incubation at 41 degreesC was reactivated by following illumination even at 41 degreesC to more than 90% in the wild type, but only to 70% in hf-2. These results suggest that PSII inactivated by heat recovers through some mechanism dependent on light, and that SQDG participates in functioning of the mechanism. The conformational disorder of PSII caused by the defect in SQDG might be correlated with the increased susceptibility of its activity to heat-stress.									66	5	0	0	65	0	73			0032-0935			WOS:000183451700008	12783332

The fine control of the nitrogen content in the deposited ZnOxNy thin films composition was possible through the stabilization of the reactive HiPIMS discharge in the transition region, between the metallic and compound target sputtering modes. Various analytical techniques such as AFM, XPS, XRD, UV-Vis and Raman spectroscopy have been employed to characterize the properties of the deposited thin films. The photocatalytic activity, light excitation efficiency and life time of photo-generated charge carriers in the ZnOxNy films were investigated by photo-electrochemical and photo-current measurements during visible light on/off irradiation cycles. The as-deposited films showed poor visible-light photocatalytic activity and photo current response. Post-deposition annealing of the films in nitrogen atmosphere resulted in a slight enhancement of crystalline order. However, the thermal treatment improved considerably the film photocatalytic activity and stability for water splitting under visible light irradiation. The optimum photo-current response and photocatalytic activity have been obtained for the annealed ZnOxNy films with a nitrogen content of 3.4 at.% (photon-to current efficiency up to 33% at lambda = 370 nm and 0.5 V biasing potential vs. Ag/AgCl). Increasing the nitrogen content above this value, in spite of lowering the energy band-gap, worsened the visible light photocatalytic activity of the films due to deterioration of the crystalline order.

Herein, cationic 2,9,16,23-tetra[4-(N-methyl) pyridinyloxy]-phthalocyanine cobalt(II) ([TMPyPcCo](4+)) and acid-treated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (aCNTs) were alternately self-assembled on the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) by means of the electrostatic interaction, leading to a 3D loose and interconnected assembly of [TMPyPcCo/aCNTs](n) multilayer films. In the [TMPyPcCo/aCNTs](n) films, [TMPyPcCo](4+) is anchored onto the surface of aCNTs without any inert polymer binders, which is beneficial to expose more active sites for electrocatalysis. The effective combination of [TMPyPcCo](4+) and aCNTs brings many advantages in electrochemical detection, involving the fast oriented transmission of charges, permeable channels for ion adsorption and transport, and more sensing sites, thus the [TMPyPcCo/aCNTs](n) films display excellent electrochemical sensitivity towards both NO2- and H2O2. The responses of NO2- and H2O2 vary linearly with respect to the concentration from 5 mM to 30 mM and 10 mM to 9 mM. Furthermore, the superior cycling stability, reproducibility, and selectivity make [TMPyPcCo/aCNTs](n) films suitable for the real samples.									40	1	1	0	6	0	40			2050-750X	2050-7518		WOS:000370427400013	32262986

The fulfillment of these goals may include the use of solar-driven photocatalytic processes that are found to be quite effective in water purification, as well as hydrogen generation. H-2 production by water splitting and photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants in water both rely on the formation of electron/hole (e(-)/h(+)) pairs at a semiconducting material upon its excitation by light with sufficient photon energy. Most of the photocatalytic studies involve the use of TiO2 and well-suited model compounds, either as sacrificial agents or pollutants. However, the wider application of this technology requires the harvesting of a broader spectrum of solar irradiation and the suppression of the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. These limitations can be overcome by the use of different strategies, among which the focus is put on the creation of heterojunctions with another narrow bandgap semiconductor, which can provide high response in the visible light region. In this review paper, we report the most recent advances in the application of TiO2 based heterojunction (semiconductor-semiconductor) composites for photocatalytic water treatment and water splitting. This review article is subdivided into two major parts, namely Photocatalytic water treatment and Photocatalytic water splitting, to give a thorough examination of all achieved progress. The first part provides an overview on photocatalytic degradation mechanism principles, followed by the most recent applications for photocatalytic degradation and mineralization of contaminants of emerging concern (CEC), such as pharmaceuticals and pesticides with a critical insight into removal mechanism, while the second part focuses on fabrication of TiO2-based heterojunctions with carbon-based materials, transition metal oxides, transition metal chalcogenides, and multiple composites that were made of three or more semiconductor materials for photocatalytic water splitting.									41	1	1	0	9	0	42				1996-1944		WOS:000529208000077	32183457

Apart from the obvious importance of the bulk properties of semiconductor materials employed as photoelectrodes, the semiconductor-liquid interface has proven to strongly govern surface-related processes, i.e. the stability, charge separation/recombination and catalytic activity. Because of this, numerous surface treatments have been reported in an effort to tailor the physicochemical properties of the semiconductor-liquid interface, and in turn, the overall PEC response. In this Perspective article we provide a brief conceptual overview of these surface engineering treatments, connecting the particular effects on the interfacial energetics with the respective consequences on the performance. The beneficial effects that arise from surface treatment are categorized as (i) the protection of the surface against photocorrosion, (ii) the passivation of deleterious surface states, (iii) the modification of the band edge positions or band bending, and (iv) the selective extraction of carriers and improved catalytic activity. State-of-the-art surface treatments such as the adsorption of organic molecules or ions, the deposition of semiconductor overlayers and metal nanoparticles or etching procedures are exemplified and described with respect to the observed beneficial effects. A common emerging theme from recent work is that one single surface treatment can lead to multiple distinct effects. Overall, we suggest that surface engineering holds the key for effectively managing the intrinsic common defects of native semiconductor photoelectrodes regardless of their nature, leading to improved light harvesting efficiency.									104	1	0	0	4	0	104			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000356056000021	26030025

All reactors were inoculated with sludge from a UASB reactor treating swine wastewater and were fed with a synthetic substrate supplemented with approximately 20 mg l(-1) of LAS, on average. To 560 mg l(-1) COD influent, the maximum COD and LAS removal efficiencies were mean values of 97 +/- 2% and 99 +/- 2%, respectively, to all reactors demonstrating the potential applicability of this reactor configuration for treating LAS. The reactors were kept at 30 degrees C and operated with a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 18 h. The use of glass beads and sand appear attractive because they favor the development of biofilms capable of supporting LAS degradation. Subsequent 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of samples from reactors R3 and R4 revealed that these reactors gave rise to broad microbial diversity, with microorganisms belonging to the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, indicating the role of microbial consortia in degrading the surfactant LAS.

J	Lin, C; Ritter, JA; Popov, BN								Characterization of sol-gel-derived cobalt oxide xerogels as electrochemical capacitors								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				145	12			4097	4103		10.1149/1.1838920				DEC 1998	1998	Very fine cobalt oxide xerogel powders were prepared using a unique solution chemistry associated with the sol-gel process. The effect of thermal treatment on the surface area, pore volume, crystallinity, particle structure, and corresponding electrochemical properties of the resulting xerogels was investigated and found to have significant effects on all of these properties. The xerogel remained amorphous as Co(OH)(2) up to 160 degrees C, and exhibited maxima in both the surface area and pore volume at this temperature. With an increase in the temperature above 200 degrees C, both the surface area and pore volume decreased sharply, because the amorphous Co(OH)(2) decomposed to form CoO that was subsequently oxidized to form crystalline Co3O4. In addition, the changes in the surface area, pore volume, crystallinity, and particle structure all had significant but coupled effects on the electrochemical properties of the xerogels. A maximum capacitance of 291 F/g was obtained for an electrode prepared with the CoOx xerogel calcined at 150 degrees C, which was consistent with the maxima exhibited in both the surface area and pore volume; this capacitance was attributed solely to a surface redox mechanism. The cycle life of this electrode was also very stable for many thousands of cycles.									470	82	0	0	9	0	517			0013-4651			WOS:000077171500010

We compared desiccation resistant flies with unselected (control) flies by measuring the effect of pre-emergence hypoxia on some fitness parameters (emergence, flight ability, copulation success, latency to copulation, copulation duration, ovary size). Anoxia effects were determined using eye color changes during pupa development and fly emergence after re-oxygenation. Both strains were negatively affected in all measured parameters when exposed to hypoxia for more than 48 h. However, after hypoxia, control flies showed, in general, shorter latency to mate and longer copula duration than desiccation-resistant flies. Anoxia-induced arrest of pupa development, whereas returning to normoxia conditions induced resumption of development. Anoxia period length (longer than 72 h) increased mortality to 100% in the control line, whereas the desiccation-resistant line survived even at 120 h of anoxia. Thus, pre-release hypoxia must not exceed 24 h in order to maintain insect quality independently of fly type.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			1519-566X	1678-8052		WOS:000483786600003	31093958

Extensive scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffractometry and UV-vis spectroscopy characterizations confirm that conformal deposition of an amorphous phosphorus overlayer does not change the crystal structure, morphology, and optical absorption properties of hematite photoanodes. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that phosphorus in the deposited overlayer exists in an oxidized state. Comprehensive steady-state polarization, transient photocurrent response, and impedance spectroscopy measurements as well as Mott-Schottky analysis manifest that the phosphorus overlayer is able to effectively passivate surface states and suppress electron-hole recombination, substantially enhancing the photocurrent for water oxidation. Combining the phosphorization treatment with two-step thermal activation, a photocurrent density of 1.1 mA cm(-2) is achieved at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode under illumination of 100mWcm(-2), ca 55 times higher than that of the non-activated pristine hematite photoanode measured under the same conditions. The simple and fast phosphorization strategy we present here can be readily applied to passivate surfaces of other semiconductor photoelectrodes to improve their photoelectrochemical performance.									24	1	0	0	2	0	24			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000384066200009	27486842

The coatings were thoroughly characterized by XRD, Raman and UV/Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, confocal microscopy, FE-SEM, HRTEM, EDX and XPS. The synthesized films had a mean thickness of 1.19 mu m, length >500 nm and a bandgap of 1.85 eV, being visible-light photoactive. Good stability and reproducibility was obtained when treating 5 mg dm(-3) oxytetracycline solutions in 0.050 M Na2SO4 at pH 5.8, attaining 96.5% antibiotic decay after 360 min at an anodic potential of +1.0 V vs Ag vertical bar AgCl under irradiation with a 36-W blue LED lamp. Comparative photocatalysis and electrochemical oxidation treatments revealed an interference between the active sites where the oxidant species were generated, causing an efficiency loss in PEC. The antibiotic was also removed from urban wastewater, thanks to the additional attack of electrogenerated active chlorine, although at a slower rate due to parallel oxidation of the natural organic matter. A degradation route for oxytetracycline is proposed based on the five primary products detected by LC-QToF-MS. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aims to explore the roles of CAT in anti-oxidative stress in the oriental armyworm, Mythimna separata. 【Methods】 The complete cDNA and genomic sequence of CAT in M.separata were cloned by RT-PCR and RACE. Bioinformatics programs were used to analyze the sequence characteristics of the gene and encoded protein. The expression levels of CAT in M.separata in different developmental stages (egg, 1st-6th instar larva, pupa and adult), tissues of the 5th instar larva (head, cuticle, foregut, midgut, hindgut and Malpighian tubules), and larvae under chlorpyrifos exposure, high temperature stress and larval crowding conditions were detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). 【Results】 The complete cDNA of CAT obtained from M. separata was named as MsCAT (GenBank accession no.: MF737386), which is 1 846 bp in length, with a 1 602 bp opening reading frame (ORF) encoding 533 amino acids. Sequence analysis indicated that MsCAT has three typical motifs of CAT family, including one proximal active site (~(88)FDRERIPERVVHAKGAGA~(105)), one NADPH binding site (~(216)VTHQVLYLFGD~(226))and one proximal heme-ligand signature sequence (~(379)RLFSYSDTH~(386)). The DNA sequence of MsCAT contains a 612 bp intron that inserts into the location behind the 99th bp of the encoding region. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that CATs from Noctuidae moths could be assigned to one well-supported cluster. MsCAT was expressed in various developmental stages and tissues of the 5th instar larva of M. separata, and exhibited the highest expression level in the 6th instar larval stage and larval midgut, respectively. MsCAT was significantly up-regulated in larvae fed on corn leaves treated by low concentration (1 mug/mL) of chlorpyrifos for 24 h, but down-regulated in larvae fed on high concentrations of chlorpyrifos. The expression level of MsCAT was significantly up-regulated in larvae exposed to temperatures from 33 to 37℃, but declined in larvae exposed to 39℃ as compared with that of the control (24℃). The expression level of MsCAT in M. separata larvae was negatively related to their crowding degree. 【Conclusion】 The obtained full-length cDNA of MsCAT encoding CAT in M. separata is reliable, and MsCAT may play an important role in development and oxidative stress tolerance of M. separata.			【目的】过氧化氢酶(CAT)的主要功能是将过氧化氢分解成水和氧气,从而使生物免受氧化损伤的伤害。本研究旨在探索CAT在粘虫Mythimna separata抗氧化胁迫中的作用。【方法】采用RT-PCR和RACE技术克隆粘虫CAT基因的cDNA全长序列和基因组序列,利用生物信息学软件分析该基因及其编码蛋白质的序列特性;运用实时荧光定量PCR(qPCR)技术分析该基因在不同发育阶段(卵、1-6龄幼虫、蛹和成虫)、5龄幼虫不同组织(头、表皮、前肠、中肠、后肠和马氏管)以及毒死蜱、高温和密度胁迫下幼虫中的表达谱。【结果】克隆得到的粘虫CAT基因命名为MsCAT(GenBank登录号: MF737386),其全长cDNA长1 846 bp,开放阅读框为1 602 bp,编码533个氨基酸。序列分析发现MsCAT具有CAT家族典型的结构域,包括一个基部活化位点标签(~(88)FDRERIPERVVHAKGAGA~(105)),一个NADPH结合位点(~(216)VTHQVLYLFGD~(226))和一个亚铁血红蛋白结合位点(~(379)RLFSYSDTH~(386))。DNA序列分析表明,在MsCAT编码区99 bp处插入了一个612 bp的内含子。系统发育分析显示,MsCAT与夜蛾科(Noctuidae)昆虫的亲缘关系最近。MsCAT在粘虫的各个发育阶段和5龄幼虫各组织中均表达,分别在6龄幼虫和幼虫中肠中的表达量最高。取食经1 mug/mL毒死蜱处理的玉米叶片24 h后,幼虫体内MsCAT表达量显著上调,但随浓度提高,表达量反而下降;在33~37℃温度处理后,幼虫MsCAT的表达量显著高于对照(24℃),而39℃处理幼虫MsCAT的表达量下调;此外,随饲养密度的增加幼虫体内MsCAT的表达显著下调。【结论】本研究克隆得到的粘虫CAT基因的cDNA全长序列(MsCAT)是可靠的,并且MsCAT在粘虫发育及抗氧化胁迫中具有重要的作用。						2	1	0	0	2	0	3			0454-6296			CSCD:6205234		
J	Yang, Chen; Zhao, Zong-Yan				Zhao, Zong-Yan/A-1076-2011	Zhao, Zong-Yan/0000-0001-8953-3150			Investigation of energy band alignments and interfacial properties of rutile NMO2/TiO2 (NM = Ru, Rh, Os, and Ir) by first-principles calculations								PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS				19	43			29583	29593		10.1039/c7cp05106a				NOV 21 2017	2017	In the field of photocatalysis, constructing hetero-structures is an efficient strategy to improve quantum efficiency. However, a lattice mismatch often induces unfavorable interfacial states that can act as recombination centers for photo-generated electron-hole pairs. If the hetero-structure's components have the same crystal structure, this disadvantage can be easily avoided. Conversely, in the process of loading a noble metal co-catalyst onto the TiO2 surface, a transition layer of noble metal oxides is often formed between the TiO2 layer and the noble metal layer. In this article, interfacial properties of hetero-structures composed of a noble metal dioxide and TiO2 with a rutile crystal structure have been systematically investigated using first-principles calculations. In particular, the Schottky barrier height, band bending, and energy band alignments are studied to provide evidence for practical applications. In all cases, no interfacial states exist in the forbidden band of TiO2, and the interfacial formation energy is very small. A strong internal electric field generated by interfacial electron transfer leads to an efficient separation of photo-generated carriers and band bending. Because of the differences in the atomic properties of the components, RuO2/TiO2 and OsO2/TiO2 hetero-structures demonstrate band dividing, while RhO2/TiO2 and IrO2/TiO2 hetero-structures have a pseudo-gap near the Fermi energy level. Furthermore, NMO2/TiO2 hetero-structures show upward band bending. Conversely, RuO2/TiO2 and OsO2/TiO2 hetero-structures present a relatively strong infrared light absorption, while RhO2/TiO2 and IrO2/TiO2 hetero-structures show an obvious absorption edge in the visible light region. Overall, considering all aspects of their properties, RuO2/TiO2 and OsO2/TiO2 hetero-structures are more suitable than others for improving the photocatalytic performance of TiO2. These findings will provide useful information for understanding the role and effects of a noble metal dioxide as a transition layer between a noble metal co-catalyst and a TiO2 photocatalyst.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000414773100060	29082994	
B	Coggon, M.M.								Field and Laboratory Studies of Atmospheric Organic Aerosol								Field and Laboratory Studies of Atmospheric Organic Aerosol								144 pp	144 pp						2016	2016	This thesis is the culmination of field and laboratory studies aimed at assessing processes that affect the composition and distribution of atmospheric organic aerosol. An emphasis is placed on measurements conducted using compact and high-resolution Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometers (AMS). The first three chapters summarize results from aircraft campaigns designed to evaluate anthropogenic and biogenic impacts on marine aerosol and clouds off the coast of California. Subsequent chapters describe laboratory studies intended to evaluate gas and particle-phase mechanisms of organic aerosol oxidation. The 2013 Nucleation in California Experiment (NiCE) was a campaign designed to study environments impacted by nucleated and/or freshly formed aerosol particles. Terrestrial biogenic aerosol with > 85% organic mass was observed to reside in the free troposphere above marine stratocumulus. This biogenic organic aerosol (BOA) originated from the Northwestern United States and was transported to the marine atmosphere during periodic cloud-clearing events. Spectra recorded by a cloud condensation nuclei counter demonstrated that BOA is CCN active. BOA enhancements at latitudes north of San Francisco, CA coincided with enhanced cloud water concentrations of organic species such as acetate and formate. Airborne measurements conducted during the 2011 Eastern Pacific Emitted Aerosol Cloud Experiment (E-PEACE) were aimed at evaluating the contribution of ship emissions to the properties of marine aerosol and clouds off the coast of central California. In one study, analysis of organic aerosol mass spectra during periods of enhanced shipping activity yielded unique tracers indicative of cloud-processed ship emissions (m/z 42 and 99). The variation of their organic fraction (f42 and f 99) was found to coincide with periods of heavy (f 42 > 0.15; f99 > 0.04), moderate (0.05 < f42 < 0.15; 0.01 < f99 < 0.04), and negligible (f42 < 0.05; f99 < 0.01) ship influence. Application of these conditions to all measurements conducted during E-PEACE demonstrated that a large fraction of cloud droplet (72%) and dry aerosol mass (12%) sampled in the California coastal study region was heavily or moderately influenced by ship emissions. Another study investigated the chemical and physical evolution of a controlled organic plume emitted from the R/V Point Sur. Under sunny conditions, nucleated particles composed of oxidized organic compounds contributed nearly an order of magnitude more cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) than less oxidized particles formed under cloudy conditions. The processing time necessary for particles to become CCN active was short ( 4 hr). Laboratory chamber experiments were also conducted to evaluate particle-phase processes influencing aerosol phase and composition. In one study, ammonium sulfate seed was coated with a layer of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from toluene oxidation followed by a layer of SOA from alpha-pinene oxidation. The system exhibited different evaporative properties than ammonium sulfate seed initially coated with alpha-pinene SOA followed by a layer of toluene SOA. This behavior is consistent with a shell-and-core model and suggests limited mixing among different SOA types. Another study investigated the reactive uptake of isoprene epoxy diols (IEPOX) onto nonacidified aerosol. It was demonstrated that particle acidity has limited influence on organic aerosol formation onto ammonium sulfate seed, and that the chemical system is limited by the availability of nucleophiles such as sulfate. Flow tube experiments were conducted to examine the role of iron in the reactive uptake and chemical oxidation of glycolaldehyde. Aerosol particles doped with iron and hydrogen peroxide were mixed with gas-phase glycolaldehyde and photochemically aged in a custom-built flow reactor. Compared to particles free of iron, iron-doped aerosols significantly enhanced the oxygen to carbon (O/C) ratio of accumulated organic mass. The primary oxidation mechanism is suggested to be a combination of Fenton and photo-Fenton reactions which enhance particle-phase OH radical concentrations.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-13-391-6882-1	INSPEC:18263801

In this study, CdS nanowires were synthesized using the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) as a template and for deposition in the inner center channel of TMV. TMV/CdS was successfully characterized, with the results showing a diameter of 4.0 nm, a cubic-phase composition, and strong fluorescence emission peaks, with an absorption edge of 566 nm and bandgap energy of 2.28 eV. The bandgap energy is narrower than that of template-free CdS. Furthermore, TMV/CdS exhibited an increased transient photocurrent, which was attributed to the effective separation of electron-hole pairs. The photoactivities of TMV/CdS and template-free CdS were tested; the results showed that the TMV/CdS had a better performance in methylene blue (MB) photodegradation, indicating that the photoactivity of TMV/CdS was higher than that of the template-free CdS. Further research on TMV/CdS regarding the photocatalytic mechanism showed that O-2(center dot-) and (OH)-O-center dot were the major species involved in photocatalysis, rather than holes (h(+)). Therefore, TMV/CdS might have applications as a novel visible-light-responsive photocatalyst.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0175-7598	1432-0614		WOS:000702793700001	34599676

However, base metal phosphides for electrooxidation are seldom studied owing to the sluggish water adsorption and dissociation dynamics, which will hinder the production of the sorbed hydroxyl radicals (M(center dot OH)) and thus inhibit the electrooxidation of organic pollutants. Herein, we proposed a universal strategy to improve the electrooxidation capability of metal phosphides by modulating the surface electron densities. The electron interactions between cobalt (Co) and phosphorus (P) are modulated after iron doping, resulting in more positively charged Co and more negatively charged P, which can promote the adsorption and activation of water molecules and produce large quantities of M(center dot OH). Meanwhile, the experimental results show that the iron-modulated Fe0.53Co0.47P nanosheet arrays exhibit higher removal efficiency of tetracycline than the boron-doped diamond and Pt anode at low current intensity. Based on experimental results and density functional theory + U calculations (DFT + U), it is found that Fe0.53Co0.47P has lower barrier (0.45 eV) to form the sorbed hydroxyl radicals (M(center dot OH)) and higher overpotential to produce O-2 than its counterparts, suggesting that Fe0.53Co0.47P can produce more M(center dot OH) instead of O-2. The above results highlighted the feasibility of these base metal phosphides for electrooxidation for advanced water purification.									31	1	0	0	16	0	31			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000500838900036	31697480

All the hybrid photocatalysts were synthesized by the conventional ceramic technique followed by protonation and intercalation of n-alkylamines. The products were characterized using XRD, Raman, IR and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, TGA, CHN-analysis and SEM. Photocatalytic measurements were conducted according to an advanced scheme taking into account possible changes in the photocatalyst concentration because of sedimentation, pH shifts and exfoliation of the samples into nanoplatelets. Special attention was also paid to the feasible improvement of the photocatalytic activity of the samples via their modification with Pt nanoparticles as a cocatalyst. In the series of amine derivatives, the highest rate of hydrogen generation was demonstrated by the Pt-loaded HCa(2)Nb(3)O(10)xBuNH(2) reaching apparent quantum efficiency of 13% in the 220-340 nm range. The initial HCa2Nb3O10 showed comparable efficiency of 8.3% that is greater than for other amine derivatives. It was demonstrated that for the investigated samples the photocatalytic activity correlates with their ability of water intercalation.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2296-2646			WOS:000533353800001	32391326

One way of lowering the loading of Pt and Ir is by using thin-film techniques for their deposition onto the high-surface conductive nanoparticles. Another approach, which is convenient in applications where the complete cycle of electricity - > H-2 - > electricity takes place, is merging the PEM-WEs and PEM-FCs into one bi-functional system - the unitized regenerative fuel cell (PEM-URFC).In accordance with the above mentioned conception, this paper revolves around unconventionally prepared bi-functional magnetron sputtered lower-loading Pt-Ir catalysts for the anode side of PEM-URFC. Two geometries of catalyst coated membranes (CCM) were compared, differing in relative positioning of individual Pt and Ir thin films sputtered on TiC-based support sublayer; the sandwich-like Ir/TiC/Pt structure and the co-sputtered Pt-Ir/TiC structure.Wide arsenal of analytical methods, ranging from photoelectron spectroscopy to electrochemical atomic force microscopy determined that co-sputtering of Pt and Ir leads to alloy formation, thus preventing iridium to fully electro-oxidize to IrOx which in turn helps to explain why sandwich-like Ir/TiC/Pt structure, with no alloy, outperforms the co-sputtered Pt-Ir/TiC CCM in both operational regimes despite having the exactly same noble metal loading.The PEM-URFC single cell with sandwich-like bi-functional anode catalyst yielded 31.8% of round-trip efficiency at 1 A cm(-2) in comparison to 34.2% achieved by combination of single-purpose cells with more than double the loading of noble metals.

Recently, the problems, which have brought about serious effect on the global living condition, have been in the "spotlight" and given impetus to the universal's efforts to head for the same direction: stem the worst warming and strive for the renewable energy source. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is undoubtedly a good choice, which holds the promise as a clean, efficient, safe and transferrable energy carrier. Octahedral coordination polymer, Cd-3(C3N3S3)(2), was found to be a robust photocatalyst for H2O2 generation under visible light irradiation. To further improve the H2O2 generation efficiency, adhering the octahedron to reduced graphene (rGO) was applied as the strategy herein. The study shows that by adhering Cd-3(C3N3S3)(2) to rGO, the formation of H2O2 is 2.5-fold enhanced and its deformation is concurrently suppressed. This work not only demonstrates the effectiveness of adhering Cd-3(C3N3S3)(2) polymer to rGO for the improvement of the polymer's photocatalytic performance, but also proposes a general way for the fabrication of graphene/coordination compound hybrids for maximizing their synergy.

J	Swinford, Jillian L.; Anderson, Joel D.					Anderson, Joel/0000-0001-8081-5303			Prevalence of Black Gill (Hyalophysa lynni) in White Shrimp Litopenaeus setiferus and Brown Shrimp Farfantepenaeus aztecus along the Texas Gulf Coast								MARINE AND COASTAL FISHERIES				13	3			263	274		10.1002/mcf2.10153				JUN 2021	2021	Shrimp black gill is an emerging disease caused by a parasitic ciliate, Hyalophysa lynni, that attacks gill tissue in white shrimp Litopenaeus setiferus and brown shrimp Farfantepenaeus aztecus and induces an immune response that produces melanized tissue in shrimp gills. This immune response causes necrosis and damage in shrimp gill tissue, which limits shrimp metabolic capability and can lead to high predation mortality among infected individuals. Shrimp black gill was first observed in the southeast Atlantic shrimp fishery in the United States, and this ciliate has been increasing in prevalence in shrimp populations of this region since 2000. The Gulf of Mexico, with its lucrative shrimp fishery and extended warmwater conditions during the year, is a potential region for H. lynni spread. White and brown shrimp were sampled from seven major bays along the Gulf coast of Texas from March to November 2019 and underwent PCR analysis to detect H. lynni presence in gill tissue. From March to November, 65% of the collected shrimp samples tested positive for H. lynni. Samples from all seven bays tested positive for H. lynni, with the upper-coast bays having a significantly higher disease prevalence than lower-coast bays. Both white and brown shrimp samples tested positive for H. lynni; however, white shrimp samples had a significantly higher disease prevalence. Overall, disease prevalence showed a temporal pattern of low prevalence in the spring, peaking during the late fall. Generalized additive mixed models detected a high water temperature and a salinity level of 30 parts per thousand or less as significant contributors to high disease prevalence. This study validates the commonality of H. lynni presence in the western Gulf of Mexico, serves as a baseline for future shrimp black gill sampling efforts in this region, and contributes to the understanding and management of potential disease threats to the Texas shrimp fishery.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1942-5120			WOS:000668968400009		
J	Jia, Long; Xu, YongFu				Jia, Long/AAH-6127-2020	Jia, Long/0000-0002-9050-723X			The role of functional groups in the understanding of secondary organic aerosol formation mechanism from alpha-pinene								SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT				738						139831	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139831				OCT 10 2020	2020	The infrared spectra (IR) analysis in combination with electrospray ionization high-resolution orbitrap mass spectra (ESI-HRMS) can provide new insight into the overall structural feature and specific molecules of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). In this study, the functional group signature of SOA produced from OH and O-3 channel oxidation of alpha-pinene is characterized based on the IR and ESI-HRMS. The IR spectra of SOA from the OH channel show strong absorptions of hydrogen bonded O-H groups and weak absorptions of C=O groups, while the absorptions of C=O are more abundant than O-H in the O-3 channel. A linear relationship between the ratio of functional group absorption area (SO-H/S-C=O) and the group number ratio of n(O-H)/n(C=O) is obtained. The ratios of n(O-H)/n(C=O) in the O-3 and H2O2 systems of SOA are estimated to be 0.60 and 3.91, respectively. The ESI-HRMS results show that organic acids are the major products in both the O-3 and NO2 systems. In contrast to the O-3 channel, alcohols are more abundant from the OH channel. The major compounds of SOA from the H2O2 system are confirmed to be formed by autoxidation of first generation RO2 radicals. The n(O-H)/n(C=O) ratio obtained by IR is in good agreement with that by MS. Thus, the ratio of n(O-H)/n(C=O) can be used to characterize SOA formation from different oxidation channels. In alpha-pinene-NO2 irradiations, the ratio of n(O-H)/n(C=O) is 0.83, which is quite close to that from the O-3 system, but totally different from that in the H2O2 system. This strongly supports that the O-3 channel plays a key role in the formation of SOA from the alpha-pinene-NO2 system. The similarity of both products and the n(O-H)/n(C=O) ratios between the alpha-pinene-O-3 and alpha-pinene-NO2 systems strongly states that a stabilized Criegee intermediate (SCI) is a key factor controlling SOA formation.

Y-box proteins are members of the cold shock proteins family and highly conserved from bacteria to humans. In this study, a novel Y-box gene (Rpybx) was cloned from the Manila clam and gene expression profiling was performed on three shell color strains (white, zebra and white zebra) and two wild populations (Southern and Northern) of R. philippinarum. The complete ORF length of Rpybx is 1367 bp, encoding 253 amino acids residues. Based on the amino acid sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis, the Rpybx gene was identified as a member of the invertebrate Y-box proteins family. Rpybx has a similar tertiary structure to human Y-box protein YB-1. The Rpybx mRNA levels were analyzed by qPCR under acute and gradually varied cold stress. Under acute low-temperature stress, the expression of Rpybx mRNA in gills and hepatopancreas was significantly increased in all selected strains and populations (P < 0.05). The Northern population showed the lowest relative expression level of Rpybx. The expressions of Rpybx were greatly upregulated in gills and hepatopancreas of different stains and populations at 5 or -2 degrees C under gradually varied temperature stress (P < 0.05). The results shed light on the biological function of the Rpybx gene in defending against low-temperature challenge and further exploring the molecular mechanism of cold tolerance and resistance in R. philippinarum.									10	0	0	0	9	0	10			0268-9146	1365-2052		WOS:000515182800001	32091145

The resulting MOF-derived selenide (rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2) consists of porous nanowires encapsulated in a carbon matrix and having a high surface area (169.30 m(2) g(-1)). This porous rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 is combined with polystyrene sulfonate-doped poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT:PSS) for use as a CE for DSSCs. CEs based on different weight percentages (1, 3, and 5 wt%) of rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 powder in PEDOT:PSS solution are compared with the commonly used platinum (Pt) based CE. The rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2-PEDOT:PSS composite benefits from the synergistic effects between porous rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2 having a high surface area and PEDOT:PSS which holds superior conductivity and strong binding capability with a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate. Therefore, the 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2-PEDOT:PSS composite based CE achieved a good stability and superior electrocatalytic activity compared to Pt CE. Furthermore, DSSCs based on a 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2-PEDOT:PSS composite CE achieved a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.60%, compared to the PCE of the Pt CE based DSSC (7.14%) prepared under similar conditions. This work has revealed a new approach to prepare MOF-derived selenide based CEs with high electrocatalytic activity without any calcination. In addition, we demonstrated that the low-cost 3 wt% rGO/ZnSe/CoSe2-PEDOT:PSS composite CE is an excellent candidate to replace Pt CE in DSSCs.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13				2052-1537		WOS:000631418600009

With this technique, hard, highly transparent and adherent films can be successfully deposited on glass or poly(methyl-methacrylate) (PMMA) substrates. Influences of plasma parameters such as plasma power, pressure of monomer and Ar plasma post-treatment on the film properties were investigated. Results have shown that the deposition rate of the tetramethylorthosilicate (TMOS) plasma films increased with increasing r.f. power. FTIR spectra of SiOx films deposited from TMOS are very similar to those of pure SiO2. Most of the -CHn groups (at 285.4 eV) of TMOS films disappeared and converted to -C-CO (at 288.6 eV) as observed in the C Is spectra after Ar plasma treatment. Surface hardness of the films deposited on glass and PMMA substrates is improved to 8H and 4H, respectively. After Ar plasma treatment, the hardness of films deposited on PMMA can be further increased to 6H. The TMOS films also have a high transmission of 90% in the wavelength range from 400 to 800 nm.

Currently, most reported surface-sensitized heterogeneous photocatalysts present poor activity and selectivity under visible light irradiation. Here, photosensitized porous metallic and magnetic 1200 CoC composites (PMMCoCC-1200) are coupled with a [Ru(bpy)(3)]Cl-2 photosensitizer to efficiently reduce CO2 under visible-light irradiation in a selective and sustainable way. As a result, the CO production reaches a high yield of 1258.30 mu L with selectivity of 64.21% in 6 h, superior to most reported heterogeneous photocatalysts. Systematic investigation demonstrates that the central metal cobalt is the active site for activating the adsorbed CO2 molecules and the surficial graphite carbon coating on cobalt metal is crucial for transferring the electrons from the triplet metal-to-ligand charge transfer of the photosensitizer Ru(bpy)(3)(2+), which gives rise to significant enhancement for CO2 reduction efficiency. The fast electron injection from the excited Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) to PMMCoCC-1200 and the slow backward charge recombination result in a long-lived, charge-separated state for CO2 reduction. More impressively, the long-time stability and easy magnetic recycling ability of this metallic photocatalyst offer more benefits to the photocatalytic field.									72	10	0	0	5	0	74			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000441760000003	30019826

In contrast, infection was confined to the choroidal vasculature of yellow perch (Perca flavescens), and the morphology of the pigment epithelium and retina in regions adjacent to the metacercariae was abnormal. The difference in location of metacercariae within the host suggested that different Diplostomum species may infect shiners and perch in Douglas Lake. Species diversity was investigated by sequencing the barcode region of the cytochrome oxidase I gene of metacercariae. Four species of Diplostomum were identified, all four of which were present in shiner lenses; however, only Diplostomum bath was present in the perch choroid. To determine whether infection of perch eyes affects the response of the retina to a light stimulus, electroretinograms (ERG) were recorded. The amplitude of the b-wave of the ERG was reduced and the b-wave latency was increased in infected perch, as compared to uninfected eyes, and the flicker-fusion frequency was also reduced. Infection of the yellow perch choroid by Diplostomum baeri, which shows strong host and tissue specificity, has an adverse effect on retinal function, lending support to the hypothesis that parasite-induced impairment of host vision may afford Diplostomum baeri the evolutionary benefit of increasing the likelihood of transmission, via host fish predation, to its definitive avian host.									10	0	0	0	10	1	10			2213-2244			WOS:000438781400008	29988865

Illumination of PSII at 20 K results in carotenoid cation radical (Car(+.)) formation in essentially all of the centers. When a sample which was preilluminated at 20 K was warmed in darkness to 120 K, Car(+.) was replaced by a chlorophyll cation radical. This suggests that carotenoid functions as an electron carrier between P680, the photooxidizable chlorophyll in PSII, and Chl(Z), the monomeric chlorophyll which acts as a secondary electron donor under some conditions. By correlating with the absorption spectra at different temperatures, specific EPR signals from Car(+.) and Chl(Z)(+.) are distinguished in terms of their g-values and widths. When cytochrome b(559) (Cyt b(559)) is prereduced, illumination at 20 K results in the oxidation of Cyt b(559) without the prior formation of a stable Car(+.). Although these results can be reconciled with a linear pathway, they are more straightforwardly explained in terms of a branched electron-transfer pathway, where Car is a direct electron donor to P680(+), while Cyt b(559) and Chl(Z) are both capable of donating electrons to Car(+.) and where the Chl(Z) donates electrons when Cyt b(559) is oxidized prior to illumination. These results have significant repercussions on the current thinking concerning the protective role of the Cyt b(559)/Chl(Z) electron-transfer pathways and on structural models of PSII.									174	4	1	0	127	0	177			0006-2960			WOS:000081262900001	10387064

When highland barley was exposed to UV-B radiation, the G6PDH activity decreased but the AP capacity increased. In contrast, under UV-B + NaC1 treatment, the G6PDH activity was restored to the control level and the maximal AP capacity and antioxidant enzyme activities were reached. Glucosamine (Glucm, an inhibitor of G6PDH) obviously inhibited the G6PDH activity in highland barley under UVB +NaC1 treatment and a similar pattern was observed in reduced glutathione (GSH) and ascorbic acid (Asc) contents. Similarly, salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM, an inhibitor of AOX) significantly reduced the AP capacity in highland barley under UV-B +NaC1 treatment. The UV-B-induced hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) accumulation was also followed. Further studies indicated that non-functioning of G6PDH or AP under UV-B +NaC1+ Glucm or UV-B +NaC1+ SHAM treatment also caused damages in photosynthesis and stomatal movement. Western blot analysis confirmed that the alternative oxidase (AOX) and G6PDH were dependent each other in cross tolerance to UV-B and salt. The inhibition of AP or G6PDH activity resulted in a significant accumulation or reduction of NADPH content, respectively, under UV-B + NaC1 treatment in highland barley leaves. Taken together, our results indicate that AP and G6PDH mutually regulate and maintain photosynthesis and stomata movement in the cross adaptation of highland barley seedlings to UV-B and salt by modulating redox homeostasis and NADPH content.

J	FONTES, JC; MATRAY, JM								GEOCHEMISTRY AND ORIGIN OF FORMATION BRINES FROM THE PARIS BASIN, FRANCE .2. SALINE SOLUTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH OIL-FIELDS								CHEMICAL GEOLOGY				109	1-4			177	200		10.1016/0009-2541(93)90069-U				OCT 25 1993	1993	Oil fields from the Paris Basin are located in three geological levels: Dogger (Middle Jurassic), Rhaetian and Keuper (Upper Triassic).The origin of water and dissolved salts in saline solutions associated with oil is investigated, using the hypothesis that Cl- and Br- are conservative in solution. In a diagram of Cl- /Br- ratios vs. Cl-, the points of the Dogger and the Keuper aquifers lie in the zone of primary brines whereas those of the Rhaetian are located in the zone of secondary brines. The Na+/Cl- ratio is very high in all of the saline solutions, suggesting either a relatively poorly evolved brine (at the beginning of halite deposition) or some halite dissolution. All of the saline solutions, especially those from the Dogger aquifer, are clearly diluted. Dilution by meteoric waters would not alter the Cl-/Br- ratio.High concentrations of lithium, rubidium and boron are attributed to the presence of an extremely evolved brine of marine origin in mixtures of secondary brines formed by dissolution of halite and small amounts of sylvite and Ca-sulphate. Mass-balance calculations of the excess of Cl- with respect to Na+ + K+ allows the fraction x of water derived from the primary brine to be calculated. Assumptions are that all Na+ and K+ is derived from the secondary brine and that the Cl- content of the primary brine is constrained by bischofite saturation at approximately 11,000 mmol kg-1. The typical proportion of water from the primary brine waters is approximately 0.7% in the Dogger formation and approximately 2.4% in the Keuper.Values of the concentration factor CF, expressed as the ratio of the molal concentration of a conservative ion in the evolved brine to its concentration in seawater have been calculated for lithium. Solutions from the Dogger and Keuper aquifers have CF(Li+)-values of 1.8.10(3) and of 7.7.10(3), respectively.In the Rhaetian aquifer, the linear relationship between heavy-isotope contents of the brine (H-3 and O-18) and the Cl- content indicates a mixture of two water sources. The first one is meteoric water as defined by the intersection of the formation water line with the global meteoric water line (deltaH-2 = - 65 parts per thousand, deltaO-18 = - 9.3 parts per thousand). The other end-member is enriched in heavy isotopes and in Cl-, and is attributed to seawater that has dissolved evaporites (mainly halite). However, the presence of small amounts of an extremely evolved brine is required to account for the bromide, lithium, rubidium and boron contents of the formation brine from the Rhaetian aquifer. As this contribution is very limited in amount, it cannot affect the heavy-isotope content of the formation water. Mass-balance equations are solved for ternary mixtures of meteoric water, seawater and brine. The same constraints as above (no Na+ and K+ supplied by the primary brine and Cl(Brine) almost-equal-to 11,000 mmol kg-1) are applied. It is also assumed that the seawater component has the same ionic contents as modern seawater and that the salt content of the meteoric component is negligible. The fraction of primary brines is x almost-equal-to 1.4% according to the Cl- balance. This estimate agrees with that obtained from the lithium balance assuming that the primary brine component was the same as that of the Keuper formation water. Mass-balance calculations also indicate that the SO42- content of the Rhaetian formation water is exclusively due to the secondary brine component.In the three saline solutions, the very high Ca2+ contents and high Ca2+/Mg2+ ratios, may be attributed to reaction of the very evolved brine (free of SO42-), with gypsum or anhydrite. The result is an exchange of Mg2+ for Ca2+, which causes a release of Ca2+ to the solution and a precipitation of secondary Mg-sulphate. This process can also account for the high strontium contents of the analysed samples.Values of the ratio Sr-87/Sr-86 are very high in the Keuper formation water due to close contact of the solutions with the granitic basement or with granite-derived detrital deposits. Values in the Rhaetian and Dogger aquifers equal those of Upper Triassic marine deposits. The stable isotope (S-34 and O-18) content of the dissolved aqueous SO42- indicates a Triassic origin for the bulk of sulphate involved in the evolution of formation waters from the Rhaetian and from the Dogger. All geochemical indicators thus show a vertical migration of Triassic brines. However, aqueous SO42- from the Keuper has a Permian isotopic signature suggesting a reworking in solution of salts from this period.									81	4	0	0	8	0	85			0009-2541			WOS:A1993MP56100012

These materials can also be considered for photochemical water splitting if one representative having a bandgap, E-g, at around 2 eV can be developed. With this aim, we simulated the solid solutions Bi1-xRExCuOS (RE = Y, La, Gd and Lu) from pure BiCuOS (E-g similar to 1.1 eV) to pure RECuOS compositions (E-g similar to 2.9 eV) by DFT calculations based on the HSE06 range-separated hybrid functional with the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling. Starting from the thermodynamic stability of the solid solution, several properties were computed for each system including bandgaps, dielectric constants, effective masses and exciton binding energies. We discussed the variation of these properties based on the relative organization of Bi and RE atoms in their common sublattice to offer a physical understanding of the influence of the RE doping of BiCuOS. Some compositions were found to give appropriate properties for water splitting applications. Furthermore, we found that at low RE fractions the transport properties of BiCuOS are improved that can find applications beyond water splitting.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000401640600060	28453012

In particular, efficient bipolar carrier transport is a challenge in these materials. Based on the prediction that a tetrahedral polymorph of MnO should have such desirable semiconducting properties, and the possibility to overcome thermodynamic solubility limits by non-equilibrium thin-film growth, we exploit both structure-property and composition-structure relationships to design and realize novel wurtzite-structure Mn1-xZnxO alloys. At Zn compositions above x approximate to 0.3, thin films of these alloys assume the tetrahedral wurtzite structure instead of the octahedral rocksalt structure of MnO, thereby enabling semiconductor properties that are unique among transition metal oxides, i.e., a band gap within the visible spectrum, a band-transport mechanism for both electron and hole carriers, electron doping, and a band lineup suitable for solar hydrogen generation. A proof of principle is provided by initial photo-electrocatalytic device measurements, corroborating, in particular, the predicted favorable hole-transport properties of these alloys.									53	5	0	0	5	0	56			2160-3308			WOS:000354970100001

The oxidation step of GO synthesis introduces a considerable amount of metallic species. Therefore, large-scale purification is an actual scientific challenge. Here we describe new purification technique (salt-washing), which is based on three consecutive steps: (a) aggregation of GO sheets with NaCl (b) washing of the aggregates and (c) removing of the salt to afford purified GO (swGO). The considerably improved purity of swGO was demonstrated by ICP and EPR spectroscopy. The microscopic methods (TEM with SEAD, AFM) proved that the salt-washing does not affect the morphology or concentration of defects, showing the aggregation of GO with NaCl is fully reversible. The eligibility of swGO for biomedical applications was tested using fibroblastic cell cultures. The determined IC50 values clearly show a strong correlation between the purity of samples and cytotoxicity. Although the purification decreases cytotoxicity of GO, the IC50 values are still low proving that cytotoxic effect is not only impurities-related but also an intrinsic property. These findings may represent a serious limitation for usage of GO in biomedical applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000568851700002	32768843

Herein, hierarchical SnS2/CuInS2 nanosheet heterostructure porous films were fabricated and decorated with C-60 to form photocathodes for PEC water reduction. Large-size CuInS2 nanosheet films were first grown on transparent conducting glass to form substrate films. Then, small-size SnS2 nanosheets were epitaxially grown on both sides of the CuInS2 nanosheets to form uniform hierarchical porous laminar films. The addition of C-60 on the surface of the SnS2/CuInS2 porous nanosheets effectively increased visible light absorption of the composite photocathode. Photoluminescence spectroscopy and impedance spectroscopy analyses indicated that the formation of a SnS2/CuInS2 heterojunction and decoration of C-60 significantly increased the photocurrent density by promoting the electron-hole separation and decreasing the resistance to the transport of charge carriers. The hierarchical SnS2/CuInS2 nanosheet heterostructure porous films containing multiscale nanosheets and pore configurations can enlarge the surface area and enhance visible light utilization. These beneficial factors make the optimized C-60 -decorated SnS2/CuInS2 photocathode exhibit much higher photocathodic current (4.51 mA cm(-2) at applied potential -0.45 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode ) and stability than the individual CuInS2 (2.58 mA cm(-2)) and SnS2 (1.92 mA cm(-2)) nanosheet film photocathodes. This study not only reveals the promise of C-60-decorated hierarchical SnS2/CuInS2 nanosheet heterostructure porous film photocathodes for efficient solar energy harvesting and conversion but also provides rational guidelines in designing high-efficiency photoelectrodes from earth-abundant and low-cost materials allowing widely practical applications.									47	2	0	0	1	0	47			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000460996900042	30758936

However, solar conversion efficiencies are hindered by the fact that light harvesting has so far been of limited efficiency in the near-infrared region as compared to that in the visible and ultraviolet regions. Here we introduce near-infrared-active photoanodes that feature lattice-matched morphological hetero-nanostructures, a strategy that improves energy conversion efficiency by increasing light-harvesting spectral range and charge separation efficiency simultaneously. Specifically, we demonstrate a near-infrared-active morphological heterojunction comprised of BiSeTe ternary alloy nanotubes and ultrathin nanosheets. The heterojunction's hierarchical nanostructure separates charges at the lattice-matched interface of the two morphological components, preventing further carrier recombination. As a result, the photoanodes achieve an incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency of 36% at 800nm in an electrolyte solution containing hole scavengers without a co-catalyst. The solar conversion efficiencies of photoelectrochemical catalysis are hindered by the light harvesting range. Here, the authors use near-infrared-active photoanodes that feature lattice-matched morphological hetero-nanostructures to realize efficient photoelectrochemical hydrogen production.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2041-1723			WOS:000675628800001	34262051

In this article, new prospects of their use as nanoparticles for various types of applications are demonstrated. For that, the ferromagnetic nanopowder of La0.6Sr0.4MnO3 has been synthesized by the sol-gel method with a subsequent annealing at 700-900 degrees C. The crystal structure, phase composition and morphology of nanoparticles as well as magnetic, magnetothermal and electrocatalytic properties have been studied comprehensively. The critical sizes of superparamagnetic, single-domain, and multi-domain states have been determined. It has been established that an anomalously wide temperature range of magnetocaloric properties is associated with an additional contribution to the magnetocaloric effect from superparamagnetic nanoparticles. The maximum values of the specific loss power are observed in the relaxation hysteresis region near the magnetic phase transition temperature. The electrochemical stability and features of the decomposition of nanoparticles in 1 M KOH and Na2SO4 electrolytes have been determined. A decrease in the particle size contributes to an increase in electrocatalytic activity for overall water splitting. Magnetocaloric and electrocatalytic results of the work indicate the prospects for obtaining the possibility of changing the temperature regime of electrocatalysis using contactless heating or cooling.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000540513500002	32412020

In low-pH-treated PSII membranes, an S2 EPR multiline signal with modified line shape was induced by illumination at 0-degrees-C, but its signal amplitude decreased upon lowering the excitation temperature with concomitant oxidation of cytochrome (cyt) b-559 in place of Mn. The half-inhibition temperature for formation of the modified multiline signal was found at -33-degrees-C, which was much higher than that for formation of the normal S2 state in untreated control membranes. Signal II(f) was normally induced down to -30-degrees-C, but its dependence on excitation temperature was different from that for modified S2. This was interpreted as indicating that the low-temperature blockage of modified S2 formation is due to the incapability of electron abstraction from the Mn cluster. The Mn K-edge of X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectrum shifted to lower energy by 0.8 eV after low-pH treatment, but the shift was reversed by addition of Ca2+. Upon illumination at 0-degrees-C of treated membranes, the K-edge energy was up-shifted by 0.8 eV, but was not upon illumination at 210 K. These results were interpreted as indicating that extraction of weakly bound Ca2+ by low-pH treatment gives rise to structural and functional modulations of the Mn cluster.									34	0	0	0	25	0	34			0006-2960			WOS:A1991FX13000005	1648962

Herein, a defective ultrathin mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (DUMCN) photocatalyst with high specific surface area and mesoporous structure is fabricated through a facile three-step heat-treatment strategy, which reduces the distance of bulk photogenerated carriers to the surface, resulting in efficient adsorption and diffusion of reactants and products, and exposing adequate surface active sites. Moreover, suitable N-vacancy defects are formed via high-temperature surface hydrogenation, which can extend light absorption and produce ultra-high intrinsic carrier mobility, and further increase the active sites. The photocatalytic hydrogen production rate is up to 13.63 mmol h(-1) g(-1) under visible light in the triethanolamine solution and 33.5 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) for overall water splitting, which is much higher than that of bulk graphitic carbon nitride (BCN) structures. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal the effect of surface defects on the band structure for promoting the spatial charge separation. This facile strategy may offer new insights into designing other ultrathin mesoporous semiconductor photocatalysts with high performance.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			2367-198X			WOS:000590594900001

Their electrochemical behaviors were compared with that of a conventional Pb-0.7% Ag alloy anode. Electrochemical measurements such as cyclic voltammetric, galvanostatic, potentiodynamic, open-circuit potential (OCP) and in situ electrochemical noise measurements were considered. After 2 h of OCP test, the linear polarization shows that the corrosion current density of the Ti/(IrO2-Ta2O5) mesh electrode is the lowest (3.37 mu A/cm(2)) among the three OCAs and shows excellent performance. Additionally, after 24 h of galvanostatic polarization at 50 mA/cm(2) and 38 degrees C, the Ti/MnO2 mesh anode has the highest potential (1.799 V), followed by the Ti/(IrO2-Ta2O5) plate (1.775 V) and Ti/(IrO2-Ta2O5) mesh (1.705 V) anodes. After 24 h of galvanostatic polarization followed by 16 h of decay, the linear polarization method confirms the sequence obtained after 2 h of OCP test, and the Ti/(IrO2-Ta2O5) mesh attains the lowest corrosion current density. The Ti/(IrO2-Ta2O5) mesh anode also shows better performance after 24 h of galvanostatic polarization with the overpotential lower than that of the conventional Pb-Ag anode by about 245 mV.									14	5	0	0	1	0	16			1003-6326	2210-3384		WOS:000369696900032

The O surface concentrations of both sets of samples are almost identical, indicating that the O-free samples readily react with air. All samples in their as-milled state have an elemental Ti, Ru and Fe surface contents that closely follow that expected from their bulk composition, indicating that there is no surface enrichment in any of the elements. In the as-milled state, more than 90% of Ti and Fe atoms are in the highest possible oxidation state, while Ru is in the metallic state. Following immersion of the samples in an oxidizing chlorate electrolyte, the Ru surface concentration decreases by a factor of two. This is also accompanied by an increase in the oxidation state of the Ru atoms left at the surface from 0 to +4. From a comparison between the Ru 3d(5/2,3/2) core level spectra of the electrodes with those of crystalline and hydrated RuO2, it is postulated that dissolution and re-deposition of Ru in the form of hydrated RuO2 occurs at open circuit potential in the chlorate electrolyte. The consequences of these findings for the electrocatalytic activity of the electrodes in chlorate electrolyte are finally discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

It is observed that BiNPs with a diameter of about 7 nanometer are uniformly deposited on porous g-C3N4 nanosheet surfaces, and offer multi-active catalytic sites to effectively contact with reactants and rapidly transport photoexcited electrons. BiNPs/g-C3N4 heterostructures significantly boost the photocatalytic degradation efficiency and photocatalytic rate for tetracycline hydrochloride (TC-H). For the optimal 10 wt%-BiNPs/g-C3N4 nanocomposite, it displays a TC-H degradation efficiency of 90.7% under visible-light irradiation for 70 min. The photocatalytic rate is approximately six-times higher than that of unmodified ones. Additionally, the heterostructure performs well in repeated cycles. The combination heterojunction effect between BiNPs and g-C3N4 and the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of metallic BiNPs result in the desired performance of BiNPs/g-C3N4 heterostructures. Besides, the active radical capture tests reveal that O-2(-) and h(+) are dominant catalytic radicals for the photocatalytic degradation. Possible pathways for the TC-H degradation and enhanced photodegradation mechanism of the heterostructure are systematically discussed. Finally, the influences of solution conditions, including pH and coexisting ions, as well as environmental water matrices, are explored extensively. The potential toxicity of the photodegradation mixtures of TC-H is evaluated. This work provides a facile and effective method for the fabrication of metallic BiNPs/g-C3N4 nanocomposites. It also helps to fully understand the coordination effect between them, and provides an efficient photocatalytic degradation material for TC-H with a practical application prospect.									14	0	0	0	5	0	14			2051-8153	2051-8161		WOS:000621569300004		
J	Zhang, Shuting; Li, Guoqiang; Duan, Liyuan; Wang, Hongyu; Zhao, Yongle; Zhang, Yongfa								Studying the basic characteristics and photocatalytic properties of graphitic carbon nitride prepared from the desulfurized waste liquid secondary salt component								OPTICAL MATERIALS				103						109839	10.1016/j.optmat.2020.109839				MAY 2020	2020	The desulfurized waste liquid (DWL) produced in the process of wet oxidation removal of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) from coke oven gas is rich in ammonium thiocyanate (NH4SCN), ammonium thiosulfate ((NH4)(2)S2O3), and ammonium sulfate ((NH)(2)SO4). Based on the research of thermal decomposition of DWL, the study on the preparation of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) by thermal polymerization in hydrogen (H-2) atmosphere using the salts of DWL as precursor was carried out. Specifically, a single salt (NH4SCN), a double salt combination (NH4SCN + (NH)(2)SO4) or (NH4SCN + (NH4)(2)S2O3), and a three salt combination (NH4SCN + (NH)(2)SO4 + (NH4)(2)S2O3) were used as precursors to prepare g-C3N4. The morphology, phase composition, specific surface area, pore structure distribution, element composition, element valence distribution, and light absorption characteristics of the prepared samples were characterized. The performance of the prepared samples was evaluated by photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B under visible light. The characterization results showed that the product (CN-MIX) obtained by the pyrolysis of three salt combination has a most fluffy and porous structure with the maximum specific surface area of 56.89 m(2)/g. Which can be attributed to the template effect of the gases produced by the pyrolysis of (NH4)(2)S2O3 and (NH)(2)SO4 accompanying the deamination and polycondensation of the intermediate product from the pyrolysis of NH4SCN. CN-MIX has a widest band gap of 2.93eV with a more negative conduction band. After 4 h of visible light irradiation, the degradation rates of 300 mL rhodamine B solution (60 mg/L) photocatalyzed by 50 mg mono-salt product and tri-salt product catalyst were 58.27% and 96.49% respectively. This is due to the synergistic effect of the large specific surface area, abundant structural defects and the strong reduction ability of photo-generated electrons in CN-MIX. The great photocatalytic performance of CN-MIX has positive theoretical guiding significance for the preparation of highly active photocatalyst g-C3N4 by using the mixed salt of desulfurized waste liquid.					5th International Conference on the Physics of Optical Materials and Devices (ICOM)5th International Conference on the Physics of Optical Materials and Devices (ICOM)	AUG 27-31, 2018AUG 27-31, 2018	Univ Belgrade, Vinca Inst Nucl Sci; IRCP Chimie Paristech; Inst Chimie Clermont Ferrand; Univ Blaise Pascal; Polish Acad Sci, Inst Low Temp & Struct ResUniv Belgrade, Vinca Inst Nucl Sci; IRCP Chimie Paristech; Inst Chimie Clermont Ferrand; Univ Blaise Pascal; Polish Acad Sci, Inst Low Temp & Struct Res	Igalo, MONTENEGROIgalo, MONTENEGRO	2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0925-3467	1873-1252		WOS:000528894400010

Molecular cloning, expression analysis and characterization of peroxiredoxin during WSSV infection in shrimp Fenneropenaeus indicus								JOURNAL OF INVERTEBRATE PATHOLOGY				109	1			52	58		10.1016/j.jip.2011.09.006				JAN 2012	2012	Innate immunity is the first line of defense in shrimps against invading pathogenic microorganisms. Peroxiredoxins (PRX) are the family of antioxidant proteins that play a crucial role in reduction of oxidative stress in host during viral infection. Peroxiredoxin from Fenneropenaeus indicus was identified, cloned and expressed in prokaryotic expression system. The Fi-PRX protein consists of two conserved Cys residues and belongs to typical 2-cys PRX family. The phylogenetic analysis revealed a close evolutionary related-ness of Fi-PRX with the PRX from Drosophila melanogaster PRX1 and distant origin with PRX sequences from other shrimp isolates Fenneropenaeus chinensis, Litopenaeus vannamei and Penaeus japonicus. Fi-PRX transcripts are constitutively expressed in hemocytes and tissues (gills, heart and muscle) and down regulated during 12 h, 24 h and 48 h of WSSV challenged shrimps. Fi-PRX protein levels correlated well with the corresponding levels of Fi-PRX transcripts in hemocytes and tissues of WSSV challenged shrimps. Recombinant Fi-PRX reduces insulin only in the presence of DTT suggesting that the antioxidant function of the protein is thiol dependent. These findings suggest that antioxidant activity of Fi-PRX play a significant role in neutralization of excessive free radicals and ROS generated during viral invasion. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Such polarization conditions result in the growth of thin oxides that reveal one feature in the linear-sweep voltammetry (LSV) oxide-reduction profiles, the OC1 peak, which corresponds to the AuO reduction. The oxide growth behavior is influenced by E-p, t(p) and T, and the higher the E-p, the longer is t(p), and the higher the T, the thicker is the oxide layer. The OC1 peak shifts towards less positive potentials upon an increase of Ep or/and t(p), but moves towards more positive potentials upon an increase of T. Theoretical data treatment indicates that the Au oxide growth follows two distinct kinetic laws, each arising from a different growth mechanism: (i) logarithmic growth for the oxide for which the thickness is up to 2 ML of AuO and (ii) inverse-logarithmic growth for oxides for which the thickness is greater than 3 ML of AuO. The transition from logarithmic to inverse-logarithmic kinetics occurs when the oxide thickness is in the 2-3 AuO ML range. The logarithmic growth originates from the interfacial place exchange between O-chem and the top-most Au surface atoms, whereas the inverse-logarithmic law arises from the growth being limited by the escape of the An cation from the metal into the oxide at the inner metal/oxide interface. The surface dipole moment of the Au delta+-O-chem(delta-) species that drives the place exchange is consistently 1.5 +/- 0.1 D. The electric field that assists the interfacial An cation escape is of the order of 10(8)-10(9) V m(-1). @ 2004 Elsevier B.V.

A sintering temperature of around 650degreesC, rather than 400-550degreesC suggested in the literature for the fabrication of Ru and Ir oxide electrode, showed the highest organic destruction yield. The sintering temperature strongly affected the electrode lifetime as well. During the high temperature sintering, increase of the sintering time caused the oxidation of the Ti substrate to result in the increase of oxide weight of the electrode and the solid diffusion of the generated TiO2 to the electrode surface, which decreased the electrode activity so that the organic destruction yield went down slowly. The destruction path of 4CP at a high temperature-sintered electrode was suggested to be different from that at a low temperature-sintered one. The Ru oxide electrode sintered at 450degreesC generated several complicated aliphatic intermediates.

The catalytic destruction of recalcitrant, non-biodegradable pollutants (per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), pharmaceuticals, and personal care products (PPCPs), pesticides, etc.) is an appropriate niche for EO. EO can be more effective than homogeneous advanced oxidation processes for the degradation of recalcitrant chemicals inert to radical-mediated oxidation, because the potential of the anode can be made much higher than that of hydroxyl radicals (E-OH= 2.7 V vs. NHE), forcing the direct transfer of electrons from pollutants to electrodes. Unfortunately, at such high anodic potential, chloride ions, which are ubiquitous in natural water systems, will be readily oxidized to chlorine and perchlorate. Perchlorate is a to-be-regulated byproduct, and chlorine can react with matrix organics to produce organic halogen compounds. In the past ten years, novel electrode materials and processes have been developed. However, spotlights were rarely focused on the control of byproduct formation during EO processes in a real-world context. When we use EO techniques to eliminate target contaminants with concentrations at mu g/L-levels, byproducts at mg/L-levels might be produced. Is it a good trade-off? Is it possible to inhibit byproduct formation without compromising the performance of EO? In this minireview, we will summarize the recent advances and provide perspectives to address the above questions. (c) The Author(s) 2020.

J	Ren Yumei; Xu Qun								Construction of Advanced Two-dimensional Heterostructure Ag/WO3-x for Enhancing Photoelectrochemical Performance								ACTA PHYSICO-CHIMICA SINICA				35	10			1157	1164		10.3866/PKU.WHXB201812054				2019	2019	Solar energy, which is clean, affordable and reliable, can help alleviate the current environmental pollution and energy crisis efficiently. In the past few decades, great progress has been made in harvesting and converting solar energy into chemical energy. Among various technologies, plasmon-induced photoelectrochemistry has been proposed as a promising alternative for solar energy conversion. The hot electrons generated from plasmon excitation and transfer from metal nanostructures to semiconductors is a potential new paradigm for solar energy conversion. However, the ultrafast decay of the hot carriers is unfavorable for the improvement of photocatalytic efficiency. Therefore, finding more efficient photocatalysts, with enhanced light absorption and a longer carrier lifetime, is of paramount importance for improving the conversion efficiency of solar energy, but their fabrication is challenging. In this work, a plasmonic metal/semiconductor heterostructure based on Ag nanoparticles embedded in two-dimensional (2D) amorphous sub-stoichiometric tungsten trioxide (a-WO3-x), followed by annealing, was successfully fabricated. Firstly, the peculiar nanostructure of 2D a-WO3-x was successfully constructed from WS2 nanosheets with supercritical CO2 (SC CO2) at 200 degrees C. Secondly, the Ag/a-WO3-x heterostructure was synthesized using an in situ reduction method. Finally, the obtained 2D heterostructure of Ag/WO3-x was annealed at 400 degrees C in N-2 to further improve its stability and conductivity. X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to characterize the structure, morphology, and composition of the material, respectively. UV-Vis spectra were also measured to evaluate light adsorption. Characterization results show that the amorphous structure can effectively anchor metal nanoparticles, and the metal nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed in the amorphous region and have a small size. The as-prepared nanocomposites showed efficient photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting when serving as photoelectrode materials, and efficient PEC activity towards photo-oxidation degradation currents under excitation of Ag localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). The photocurrent response of the Ag/WO3-x heterostructure was approximately five times greater than that of a-WO3-x. Moreover, the PEC degradation efficiency of Ag/WO3-x reached 96.7% for MO under Vis light illumination (after reaction for 120 min), while the PEC degradation efficiency of WO3-x was only 63.6%. The high PEC performance of the composite photoanode can be ascribed to the local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect of the Ag nanoparticles, which can enhance the light absorption and hot electron transformation. Moreover, the construction of local crystalline-amorphous interfaces can further promote the separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, and thus increase conductivity. This work provides a positive strategy for the fabrication of advanced photocatalysts, and a new perspective on understanding of the synergistic effects of structural and electronic regulations.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			1000-6818			WOS:000473456900018

However, its functional roles in invertebrates are largely unknown. In this study, a HMGB3 homologue molecule was identified from Apostichopus japonicus (designated as AjHMGB3) by RACE approach. The full-length cDNA of AjHMGB3 was of 2298 bp with an open reading frame of 1320 bp encoding a 439-amino-acid (aa) residue protein. Structural analysis then conducted and the results revealed that AjHMGB3 processed two conserved HMGBs (133-204 and 210-279 aa) and an acidic tail. The results of subsequent multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis both indicated that AjHMGB3 belongs to a new member of HMGB3 protein subfamily. Furthermore, AjHMGB3 was expressed in all examined tissues except in tentacles and particularly highly expressed in the intestine, as indicated by spatial expression analysis results. The Vibrio splendidus challenge in vivo and lipolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation in vitro can significantly upregulate the mRNA expression of AjHMGB3 in coelomocytes. This finding is consistent with the expression profiles of TLR cascade members. We further investigated the expression profiles of AjMyD88 and Ajp105 after the gain- or loss-of-function of AjHMGB3 in coelomocytes. The results showed that AjMyD88 and Ajp105 were upregulated 2.19- and 2.83-fold in AjHMGB3 overexpressed treatment and downregulated 0.38- and 0.43-fold in the AjHMGB3 silencing group. The p50 subunit displayed expression profiles that are identical to those of AjMyD88 and Ajp105 according to the Western blot results. In the same condition, the respiratory burst was increased by 37.5% in the AjHMGB3 overexpressed group and depressed by 28.2% in the AjHMGB3 knock-down group. Our present findings collectively suggested that AjHMGB3 acted as an NF-kappa B activator and produced ROS production in sea cucumbers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

It consists of the Papanduva and Quiriri granitic plutons and a contemporaneous bimodal volcanic association. The Papanduva Pluton includes massive and deformed peralkaline alkali-feldspar granites with Na-Ca and Na-amphiboles and clinopyroxenes. The deformed types are the most evolved rocks in the province and carry rare ` agpaitic' minerals, some being described for the first time in granites from Brazil. The larger Quiriri Pluton comprises massive, slightly peraluminous, biotite syeno-and monzogranites with rare Ca-amphibole. Biotite compositions are relatively homogeneous, whereas sodic amphiboles and clinopyroxenes show increasing Na and Fe3+ evolving paths. The Morro Redondo granites are ferroan, with high SiO2, alkalis and HFSE contents; the peralkaline types registering the highest fe#. LILE and HFSE abundances increase with the agpaitic index and the most evolved are HHP granites, with radiogenic heat production up to 5.7 mu Wm(-3). Geothermobarometric estimates indicate emplacement under low pressures (similar to 100 MPa), at temperatures up to 850- 800 C, and relatively reduced(QFM) and oxidized (+ 1 <Delta(QFM) < + 3) environments for the Papanduva and Quiriri Plutons, respectively. In both cases, melts evolved to relatively high oxidation states upon crystallization progress.									13	1	0	0	1	0	13			0001-3765	1678-2690		WOS:000334094100007

Here, the critical thermal tolerance (CTmax and CTmin) of four populations: Labeo rohita, Cana cada, and their reciprocal hybrids L. rohita female x C. catla male (RC) and C. catla female x L. rohita male (CR) being acclimatized at four acclimation temperatures (22, 26, 30 and 34 degrees C) were determined. All populations indicated substantial variations (P < 0.05) in CTmax and CTmin values. L. rohita displayed, comparatively the highest CTmax with largest total and intrinsic polygon zones as well as the upper and lower acquired thermal tolerance zones followed by RC and CR hybrids, while C. catla showed significantly the highest CTmin value and the smallest intrinsic and acquired thermal tolerance zones. Both hybrids illustrated low parent hetemsis (<= 11%). Additionally, the highest expression of Hsp70 and Hsp90 (heat shock proteins) genes, serum lysozyme level, respiratory burst activity and lowest lipid peroxidation level under lower and higher temperature shock further illustrated strong physiological mechanism of L. rohita in contrast to C. cada, to deal with acute temperature, while hybrids, especially F1 RC hybrid appeared as a good option to replace C. catla in relatively higher and lower temperature areas.									8	0	0	0	7	0	8			0306-4565	1879-0992		WOS:000530094900034	32364999

This study aimed to describe molecular features, functional assessments and potential immune responses of Prx6 identified from the big-belly seahorse, Hippocampus abdominalis (HaPrx6). The complete ORF (666 bp) of HaPrx6 encodes a polypeptide (24 kDa) of 222 amino acids, and harbors a prominent peroxiredoxin super-family domain, a peroxidatic catalytic center, and a peroxidatic cysteine. The deduced amino acid sequence of HaPrx6 shares a relatively high amino acid sequence similarity and close evolutionary relationship with Oplegnathus fasciatus Prx6. The purified recombinant HaPrx6 protein (rHaPrx6) was shown to protect plasmid DNA in the Metal Catalyzed Oxidation (MCO) assay and, together with 1,4-Dithiothreitol (DTT), protected human leukemia THP-1 cells from extracellular H2O2 mediated cell death. In addition, quantitative real-time PCR revealed that HaPrx6 mRNA was constitutively expressed in 14 different tissues, with the highest expression observed in liver tissue. Inductive transcriptional responses were observed in liver and kidney tissues of fish after treating them with bacterial stimuli, including LPS, Edwardsiella tarda, and Streptococcus iniae. These results suggest that HaPrx6 may play an important role in the immune response of the big-belly seahorse against microbial infection. Collectively, these findings provide structural and functional insights into HaPrx6. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It is very likely that the properties of VHb are not optimized for foreign hosts; therefore, we used error-prone PCR to generate a number of randomly mutated vhb genes to be expressed and studied in Escherichia coli. in addition, the mutated VHb proteins also contained an extension of eight residues (MTMITPSF) at the amino terminus. VHb mutants were screened for improved growth properties under microaerobic conditions and 15 clones expressing mutated hemoglobin protein were selected for further characterization and cultivated in a microaerobic bioreactor to analyze the physiological effects of novel VHb proteins on cell growth. The expression of four VHb mutants, carried by pVM20, pVM50, pVM104, and pVM134, were able to enhance microaerobic growth of E. coli by approximately 22%, 155%, 50%, and 90%, respectively, with a concomitant decrease of acetate excretion into the culture medium. The vhb gene in pVM20 contains two mutations substituting residues Glu19(A17) and Glu137(H23) to Gly. pVM50 expresses a VHb protein carrying two mutations: His36(C1) to Arg36 and Gln66(E20) to Arg66. pVM104 and pVM134 express VHb proteins carrying the mutations Ala56(E10) to Gly and Ile24(B5) to Thr, respectively. Our experiments also indicate that the positive effects elicited by mutant VHb-expression from pVM20 and pVM50 are linked to the peptide tail. Removal of the N-terminal sequence reduced cell growth approximately 23% and 53%, respectively, relative to wild-type controls. These results clearly demonstrate that it is possible to obtain mutated VHb proteins with improved characteristics for improving microaerobic growth of E. coli by using combined mutation techniques, addition of a peptide tail, and random error-prone PCR.

However, the efficiency of this technology is unavoidably hampered by the ineffective generation and utilization of photoinduced charge carriers. In this contribution, we report a facile in situ topotactic transformation approach where {000}-faceted BiOBr nanosheets (BOB-NS) were employed as the starting material for the formation of single-crystalline ultrathin Bi2WO6 nanosheets (BWO-NS). The as-obtained BWO-NS not only preserved the advantageous properties of the 2D nanostructure and predominantly exposed {001} facets but also possessed enlarged specific surface areas as a result of sample thickness reduction. As opposed to the commonly observed bandgap broadening when the particle sizes decrease to an ultrathin nanoscale owing to the quantum size effect, the developed BWO-NS exhibited a fascinating bandgap narrowing compared to those of pristine Bi2WO6 nanoplates (BWO-P) synthesized from a conventional one-step hydrothermal approach. Moreover, the electronic band positions of BWO-NS were modulated as a result of ion exchange for the reconstruction of the energy bands, where BWO-NS demonstrated significant upshifting of CB and VB levels; these are beneficial for photocatalytic reduction applications. This propitious design of BWO-NS through integrating the merits of BOB-NS caused BWO-NS to exhibit substantial 2.6 and 9.3-fold enhancements of CH4 production over BOB-NS and BWO-P, respectively.									28	3	0	0	6	0	28			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000542925300020	32433865

Searching for cheap but efficient catalysts for hydrogen production from water splitting is urgently needed. In this report, bimetallic Fe-Mo sulfide/carbon nanocomposites that derived from a polyoxometalate phosphomolybdic acid encapsulated metal-organic framework MIL-100 (PMA@MIL-100) have been generated and their applications in electrocatalytic hydrogen generation were explored. The PMA@MIL-100 precursor is formed via a simple one-pot hydrothermal synthesis method and the bimetallic Fe-Mo sulfide/carbon nanocomposites were obtained by chemical vapor sulfurization of PMA@MIL-100 at high temperatures. The nanocomposite samples were fully characterized by a series of techniques including X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, N-2 gas sorption, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and were further investigated as electrocatalysts for hydrogen production from water splitting. The hydrogen production activity of the best performed bimetallic Fe-Mo sulfide/carbon nanocomposite exhibits an overpotential of -0.321 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 62 mV dec(-1) with a 53 % reduction in overpotential compared to Mo-free counterpart composite. This dramatic improvement in catalytic performance of the Fe-Mo sulfide/carbon composite is attributed to the homogeneous distribution of the nanosized iron sulfide, MoS2 particles, and the formation of Fe-Mo-S phases in the S-doped porous carbon matrix. This work has demonstrated a potential approach to fabricate complex heterogeneous catalytic materials for different applications.

Although this was reported a few decades ago, little is known about this trait on a molecular level. The aim of this study was to analyze the transcription response to elevated copper concentrations in two S. vulgaris ecotypes originating from copper-contrasting soil types - copper-tolerant Lubietova and copper-sensitive Stranska skala. To reveal if plants are transcriptionally affected, we first analyzed the HMA7 gene, a known key player in copper metabolism. Based on BAC library screening, we identified a BAC clone containing a SvHMA7 sequence with all the structural properties specific for plant copper-transporting ATPases. The functionality of the gene was tested using heterologous complementation in yeast mutants. Analyses of SvHMA7 transcription patterns showed that both ecotypes studied up-regulated SvHMA7 transcription after the copper treatment. Our data are supported by analysis of appropriate reference genes based on RNA-Seq databases.To identify genes specifically involved in copper response in the studied ecotypes, we analyzed transcription profiles of genes coding Cu-transporting proteins and genes involved in the prevention of copper-induced oxidative stress in both ecotypes. Our data show that three genes (APx, POD and COPT5) differ in their transcription pattern between the ecotypes with constitutively increased transcription in Lubietova. Taken together, we have identified transcription differences between metallifferous and non-metalliferous ecotypes of S. vulgaris, and we have suggested candidate genes participating in metal tolerance in this species.

J	Mizan, Morteza; Huang, Xiao-Wen								Genesis of the Heneshk IOCG deposit, Iran: magnetite mineral chemistry and sulfur isotope								GEOSCIENCES JOURNAL				24	5			489	506		10.1007/s12303-019-0050-7		JUL 2020		OCT 2020	2020	The Heneshk Fe +/- Cu deposit, a metamorphosed IOCG (Iron Oxide Copper Gold) is situated in Sanandaj-Sirjan Zone, SW Iran. Mineralization occurs as two stratabound 'U' shape ore bodies, hosted by a meta-dolomite member of a metamorphic complex. The ore and gangue minerals comprise magnetite, chalcopyrite, hematite, martite, mushketovite, pyrite, barite, calcite, dolomite, and quartz. The successive mineral assemblage formed in the five paragenetic stages (I to V) during an ongoing deformation regime from the plastic to the brittle deformation regime. The mineralization stages comprise stage I, III, and IV. Stage I-III and IV formed in the plastic and the brittle deformation regime by the metamorphic processes in a shear zone, respectively. The concomitant alteration products of these stages comprise sodic, Fe, K, hydrolytic and silicification. The sodic and Fe alterations occur as a pre-mineralization stage and each mineralization stage is accompanied by K and hydrolytic alterations. A late barite-calcite-quartz assemblage (stage V) overprinted on the previous stages (I to IV). Stage I mineralization formed at a depth of similar to 10 km and temperature of similar to 300 degrees C (a high pressure-low temperature environment). The partitioning and substitution of the Mg, Al, Ti, Ni, Cr, Mn, Si, and Zn elements increased in this relatively higher pressure environment cause of the highest concentrations of the Al, Ti, Ni, Cr, and Zn, in comparison with metamorphic magnetite. The mineral chemistry of the Heneshk magnetite (average elemental concentrations) is in accordance with the metamorphic magnetite and can consider as a pure magnetite with the low elemental concentration. Also, the delta(SH2S)-S-34 Heneshk mineralized fluid ranges between 39.8 to 40.6 parts per thousand, indicating the contribution of the paleo-evaporates. The pleo-evaporates leached from the older strata during metamorphism, and their precipitation in the form of the sulfide minerals occurs through the TSR (Thermochemical Sulfate Reduction) mechanism.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1226-4806	1598-7477		WOS:000547224700002

Comparative sequence analysis showed a highly conserved Toll/IL-1 receptor domain. Although the leucine-rich repeat domain was less conserved, the position of the critical peptidoglycan (PGN)-binding residues in the leucine-rich repeat domain of carp TLR2 were conserved. Transfection of human embryonic kidney 293 cells with TLR2 corroborated the ability of carp TLR2 to bind the prototypical mammalian vertebrate TLR2 ligands lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and PGN from Staphylococcus aureus. The synthethic triacylated lipopeptide N-palmitoyl-S-(2,3-bis(palmitoyloxy)-(2RS)-propyl)-(R)-Cys-(S)-Ser-(S)-Lys(4) trihydrochloride (Pam(3)CSK(4)) but not the diacylated lipopeptide macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2 (MALP-2) also activated TLR2 transfected human cells. We identified clear differences between the mammalian vertebrates and carp TLR2-mediated response. The use of the same ligands on carp macrophages indicated that fish cells require high concentrations of ligands from Gram-positive bacteria (LTA, PGN) for activation and signal transduction, react less strongly (Pam(3)CSK(4)) or do not react at all (MALP-2). Overexpression of TLR2 in carp macrophages confirmed TLR2 reactivity of the response to LTA and PGN, low-responsiveness to Pam(3)CSK(4) and non-responsiveness to MALP-2. A putative relation with the apparent absence of accessory proteins such as CD14 from the fish TLR2-containing receptor complex is discussed. Moreover, activation of carp macrophages by PGN resulted in increased TLR2 gene expression and enhanced TLR2 mRNA stability, MAPK-p38 phosphorylation and increased radical production. Finally, we could show that NADPH oxidase-derived radicals and MAPK-p38 activation cooperatively determine the level of PGN-induced TLR2 gene expression. We propose that the H2O2-MAPK-p38-dependent axis is crucial for regulation of TLR2 gene expression in fish macrophages.

I. The extreme r-element rich, iron-poor halo giant CS 31082-001 - Implications for the r-process site(s) and radioactive cosmochronology								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				387	2			560	579		10.1051/0004-6361:20020434				MAY 2002	2002	We present a high-resolution (R=75000, S/Nsimilar to500) spectroscopic analysis of the bright (V=11.7), extreme halo giant CS 31082-001 ([Fe/H]=2.9), obtained in an ESO-VLT Large Programme dedicated to very metal-poor stars. We find CS 31082-001 to be extremely rich in r-process elements, comparable in this respect only to the similarly metal-poor, but carbon-enriched, giant CS 22892-052. As a result of the extreme overabundance of the heaviest r-process elements, and negligible blending from CH and CN molecular lines, a reliable measurement is obtained of the U II line at 386 nm, for the first time in a halo star, along with numerous lines of Th II, as well as lines of 25 other r-process elements. Abundance estimates for a total of 43 elements (44 counting Hydrogen) are reported in CS 31082-001, almost half of the entire periodic table. The main atmospheric parameters of CS 31082-001 are as follows: T-eff=4825+/-50 K, log g=1.5+/-0.3(cgs), [Fe/H]=2.9+/-0.1 (in LTE), and microturbulence 1.8+/-0.2 km s(-1). Carbon and nitrogen are not significantly enhanced relative to iron. As usual in giant stars, Li is depleted by dilution (log(Li/H)=0.85). The alpha-elements show the usual enhancements with respect to iron, with [O/Fe]=0.6+/-0.2 (from [O I] 6300 Angstrom), [Mg/Fe]=0.45+/-0.16, [Si/Fe]=0.24+/-0.1, and [Ca/Fe]=0.41+/-0.08, while [Al/Fe] is near -0.5. The r-process elements show unusual patterns: among the lightest elements (Zsimilar to40), Sr and Zr follow the Solar r-element distribution, but Ag is down by 0.8 dex. All elements with 56less than or equal toZless than or equal to72 follow the Solar r-element pattern, reduced by about 1.25 dex. Accordingly, the [r/Fe] enhancement is about +/-1.7 dex (a factor of 50), very similar to that of CS 22892-052. Pb, in contrast, seems to be below the shifted Solar r-process distribution, possibly indicating an error in the latter, while thorium is more enhanced than the lighter nuclides. In CS 31082-001, log(Th/Eu) is -0.22+/-0.07, higher than in the Solar System (-0.46) or in CS 22892-052 (-0.66). If CS 31082-001 and CS 22892-052 have similar ages, as expected for two extreme halo stars, this implies that the production ratios were different by about 0.4 dex for the two objects. Conversely, if the Th/Eu production ratio were universal, an age of 15 Gyr for CS 22892-052 would imply a negative age for CS 31082-001. Thus, while a universal production ratio for the r-process elements seems to hold in the interval 56less than or equal toZless than or equal to72, it breaks down in the actinide region. When available, the U/Th is thus preferable to Th/Eu for radioactive dating, for two reasons: (i) because of its faster decay rate and smaller sensitivity to observational errors, and (ii) because the inital production ratio of the neighboring nuclides U-238 and Th-232 is more robustly predicted than the Eu-151/Th-232 ratio. Our current best estimate for the age of CS 31082-001 is 14.0+/-2.4 Gyr. However, the computed actinide production ratios should be verified by observations of daughter elements such as Pb and Bi in the same star, which are independent of the subsequent history of star formation and nucelosynthesis in the Galaxy.									410	9	0	0	2	0	413			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000175858200022

ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				487	1			237	U50		10.1051/0004-6361:20078156				AUG 2008	2008	Context. The determination of interstellar abundances is essential for a better understanding of stellar nucleosynthesis and the "chemical" evolution of the Galaxy.Aims. The aim is to determine O-18/O-17 abundance ratios across the entire Galaxy. These provide a measure of the amount of enrichment by high-mass versus intermediate-mass stars.Methods. Such ratios, derived from the (CO)-O-18 and (CO)-O-17 J = 1-0 lines alone, may be affected by systematic errors. Therefore, the (CO)-O-18 and (CO)-O-17 (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2), as well as the (CO)-C-13(1-0) and (2-1) lines, were observed towards 18 prominent galactic targets (a total of 25 positions). The combined dataset was analysed with a large velocity gradient model, accounting for optical depth effects.Results. The data cover galactocentric radii between 0.1 and 16.9 kpc (solar circle at 8.5 kpc). Near the centre of the Galaxy, O-18/O-17= 2.88 +/- 0.11. For the galactic disc out to a galactocentric distance of similar to 10 kpc, O-18/O-17= 4.16 +/- 0.09. At similar to 16.5 kpc from the galactic centre, O-18/O-17= 5.03 +/- 0.46. Assuming that O-18 is synthesised predominantly in high-mass stars (M > 8 M-circle dot), while (CO)-O-17 is mainly a product of lower mass stars, the ratio from the inner Galaxy indicates a dominance of CNO-hydrogen burning products that is also apparent in the carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios. The high O-18/O-17 value of the solar system (5.5) relative to that of the ambient interstellar medium suggests contamination by nearby high-mass stars during its formation. The outer Galaxy poses a fundamental problem. High values in the metal-poor environment of the outer Galaxy are not matched by the low values observed towards the even more metal-poor Large Magellanic Cloud. Apparently, the outer Galaxy cannot be considered as an intermediate environment between the solar neighbourhood and the interstellar medium of small metal-poor galaxies. The apparent O-18/O-17 gradient along the galactic disc and the discrepancy between outer disc and LMC isotope ratios may be explained by different ages of the respective stellar populations. More data from the central and far outer parts of the Galaxy are, however, needed to improve the statistical significance of our results.									60	1	0	0	0	0	60			0004-6361			WOS:000258327000025

Anaplasmosis is responsible for serious damages to livestock due to mortality caused in herds, decrease in milk production and weight gain and expenses with prevention and control. Is an enzootic disease in temperate, subtropical and tropical countries. In these regions, cattle contamination may occur biologically by ticks, mechanically by dies or iatrogenically. The immune system of invertebrates has multiple mechanisms, but it is simpler than the immune system of vertebrates, however the ticks have a wide variety of protection mechanisms, including production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) which act directly against invading pathogens. To this date, only a few AMPs have been described in R. microplus, and little is known about the activity of these AMPs against A. marginale.Review: The tick R. microplus has several mechanisms to protect itself against invading microorganisms. Besides a protective cuticle and epithelia lining which are part of the first line of defense against pathogens, there are intermediate compounds of melanization, coagulation, phagocytosis, encapsulation, nodule formation, reactive oxygen species, proteins such as cystatins and additionally a vast repertoire of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). However, the Anaplasma sp. have developed evolutionary mechanisms to be able to adapt and survive in this arthropod which is the main biological vector this pathogen. The AMPs can be expressed constitutively by the immune system, induced by infection, or by the recognition of surface components of microorganisms such as lipopolysaccharides (ITS) and peptidoglycan (PNG). However, through evolutionary events, the Ann plasma marginale lost genes encoding these components characteristic of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria, and thus, is likely that the major surface proteins (MSPs) are involved in its strengthening as the resistance to AMPs. Although the mechanisms of action of AMPs have not been fully elucidated, models are proposed to demonstrate how the interactions between lipid bilayer and AMP happen. More than 1,000 AMPs have been described in several groups of eukaryotes. In particular, amphibian peptides account for 592 of total AMPs representing a rich source of these molecules. Additionally, another 166 AMPs were isolated from insects. However, in R. microplus, few studies have described the existence of AMPs. The known R. microplus antimicrobial peptides are defensin and ixodidin (both isolated from hemocytes), the microplusin (isolated from female hemolymph and eggs), VTDCE ( isolated gut and ovary), and other two peptides characterized as fragments of bovine hemoglobin, Hb 33-91 and Hb 98-114, (isolated from engorged female gut).Conclusion: Since the silencing of genes encoding AMPs expressed in R. microplus decreases the number of A. marginale, it is suggested that this bacteria could adapt to support the tick immune defense mechanisms generating a symbiotic relationship, a evidence that the expression of AMPs can be manipulated by the pathogen to assist in its multiplication by a mechanism not yet defined, thus the Anaplasma sp. and the tick vector can live together allowing the bacteria transmission by the host. More studies about antimicrobial peptides expressed in R. microplus against invading microorganisms are necessary in order to improve the comprehension of its immune system and its competence for bovine anaplasmosis as a vector.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1678-0345	1679-9216		WOS:000309450600001

In this study, we characterized the zebrafish thioredoxin domain containing 12 (Zftxndc12) gene, analyzed the transcriptional responses and studied the functional properties of its recombinant protein. Full-length cDNA of Zftxndc12 consists 519 bp coding region encoding 172 amino acids (AA) including the signal peptide. Highly consensus active motif ((65)WCGAC(69)) and probable ER retrieval motif ((169)GDEL(172)) were identified. Ubiquitous expression of Zftxndc12 mRNA was observed from one cell to juvenile stage as well as different organs of adult zebrafish. Moreover, whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) results showed a higher expression of Zftxndc12 in primordial gills, central nerves system and eye. The tissue specific expression analysis (by qRT-PCR) also showed the highest expression in gills followed by brain in adult zebrafish. In larvae, up regulated Zfbcndc12 mRNA expression upon exposure to H2O2, Edwardsiella tarda and Saprolegnia parasitica suggests that it may involve in both stress and immune responses. Moreover, transcriptional expression of Zftxndc12 was up-regulated upon Streptococcus iniae challenge in gills of adult zebrafish. The recombinant ZfTxndc12 (rZfTxndc12) was overexpressed, purified and tested for its biological activities. Results revealed that rZfTxndc12 is able to reduce the DNA damage and detoxify the H2O2 toxicity in concentration dependent manner. Overall results suggest that Zftxndc12 is important antioxidant and immune functional member of the host defense system in zebrafish.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1050-4648	1095-9947		WOS:000457666800111	30359749

Here, we cloned and sequenced the full-length cDNA and genomic DNA of two SODs from the copepod, Tigriopus japonicas: copper/zinc SOD (TJ-Cu/Zn-SOD) and manganese SOD (TJ-Mn-SOD). To define whether TJ-Mn-SOD is a cytosolic or a mitochondrial protein, a phylogenetic analysis was performed. The genomic structure of both TJ-SOD genes was determined with the promoter region sequences. In order to investigate their potential role in response to environmental pollutants, T. japonicas were treated with heavy metal (copper, zinc, and silver; 0, 10, 25, 50, and 100 mu g L-1) and industrial chemicals (benzo[alpha]pyrene, 4-nonylphenol, and tributyltin; 0, 1, 5, 10, and 20 mu g L-1) for 96 h. Subsequently, the TJ-Cu/Zn-SOD and TJ-Mn-SOD mRNA level was measured with quantitative real-time RT-PCR along with total SOD activity. The deduced amino acid residues of TJ-Cu/Zn-SOD and TJ-Mn-SOD possessed evolutionary conserved domains that are required for metal binding and Cu/ZnSOD-conserved signature sequences. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that TJ-Mn-SOD was closely clustered to mitochondrial Mn-SOD of another copepod, Lepeophtheirus salmon is. TJ-Cu/Zn-SOD gene had four exons and three introns, while the TJ-Mn-SOD gene consisted of two exons interrupted by one intron. In the 5'-flanking region of TJ-Cu/Zn-SOD and TJ-Mn-SOD, we observed several transcription regulatory elements such as p53, XRE, MRE, and ERE-half sites. In the response to heavy metals, Cu, Zn, and Ag, both TJ-Cu/Zn-SOD and TJ-Mn-SOD transcript levels along with enzyme levels were significantly increased at high concentrations (50 mu g L-1 and 100 mu g L-1). Particularly, in the Cu- and Ag-exposed group, the expression of TJ-Mn-SOD mRNA was regulated more sensitively than the TJ-Cu/ Zn-SOD mRNA level, indicating that the chemical susceptibility would be not correlated with the form of chemicals. B[a]P treatment showed a significant increase in the expression of both TJ-SODs mRNA level and enzyme level from 5 mu g L-1 concentration, while TBT decreased its expression at high concentrations (10 mu g L-1 and 20 mu g L-1). 4-NP increased both TJ-SODs mRNA level at 1 mu g L-1 concentration, and then inhibited its expression from 5 mu g L-1 concentration to a lower level than the control. This finding suggests that TJ-Cu/Zn-SOD and TJ-Mn-SOD would be an inducible gene upon exposure to heavy metals and B[alpha]P, and could be used as a potential biomarker for the risk assessment of these environmental pollutants. This is the first report to elucidate response of SOD to environmental pollutants in copepods. Therefore, this study would give a clue to better understand the mode of action of antioxidant genes and enzymes under oxidative stress in marine invertebrates. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In this context, in the present research we have used the model species Chironomus riparius (Chironomidae, Diptera) and the non-model species Prodiamesa olivacea (Chironomidae, Diptera) to assess the aquatic toxic effects of acute 4-h and 24-h exposures to 1 mu gL(-1) of three common environmental pollutants: butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), bisphenol A (BPA), and benzophenone 3 (BP3). Individuals of both species were collected from a contaminated river (Sar) in Galicia (Spain).Regarding Chironomus, there are four OECD standardized tests for the evaluation of water and sediment toxicity, in which different species in this genus can be used to assess classical toxicity parameters such as survival, immobilization, reproduction, and development. In contrast, Prodiamesa is rarely used in toxicity studies, even though it is an interesting toxicological species because it shares habitats with Chironomus but requires less extreme conditions (e.g., contamination) and higher oxygen levels. These different requirements are particularly interesting in assessing the different responses of both species to pollutant exposure.Quantitative real-time PCR was used to evaluate the transcriptional changes caused by xenobiotics in different genes of interest. Since information about P. olivacea in genomic databases is scarce, its transcriptome was obtained using de novo RNAseq. Genes involved in biotransformation pathways and the oxidative stress response (MnSOD, CAT, PHGPx, Cyp4g15, Cyp6a14-like and Cyp6a2-like) were de novo identified in this species. Our results show differential toxic responses depending on the species and the xenobiotic, being P. olivacea the dipteran that showed the most severe effects in most of the studied biomarker genes.This work represents a multi-species approach that allows us to deepen in the toxicity of BBP, BPA, and BP3 at the molecular level. Besides, it provides an assessment of the tolerance/sensitivity of natural populations of model and non-model insect species chronically exposed to complex mixtures of pollutants in natural scenarios. These findings may have important implications for understanding the adverse biological effects of xenobiotics on P. olivacea, providing new sensitive biomarkers of exposure to BBP, BPA, and BP3. It also highlights the suitability of Prodiamesa for ecotoxicological risk assessment, especially in aquatic ecosystems.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0166-445X	1879-1514		WOS:000574866700007	32861021

Rainbow trout grew better than Atlantic salmon, and did not show reduced growth at 19 degrees C. Rainbow trout kept at 19 degrees C had increased blood hemoglobin concentration compared to rainbow trout kept at 13 degrees C, while salmon did not show the same hemoglobin response due to increased temperature. Both species showed reduced length growth and decreased muscle glycogen stores at 19 degrees C. Circulating IGF-1 concentration was higher in rainbow trout than in Atlantic salmon, but was not affected by temperature in either species. Plasma IGF-binding protein 1b (IGFBP-1b) concentration was reduced in Atlantic salmon reared at 19 degrees C after 15 days but increased in rainbow trout at 19 degrees C after 35 days. The igfbp1b mRNA level in liver showed a positive correlation to plasma concentrations of glucose and IGFBP-1b, suggesting involvement of this binding protein in carbohydrate metabolism at 19 degrees C. At this temperature muscle igfbp1a mRNA was down-regulated in both species. The muscle expression of this binding protein correlated negatively with muscle igf1 and length growth. The plasma IGFBP-1b concentration and igfbp1b and igfbp1a expression suggests reduced muscle igf1 signaling at elevated temperature leading to glucose allostasis, and that time course is species specific due to higher thermal tolerance in rainbow trout.

The protein is largely involved in the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, and regulates the cell cycle progression and growth. The goal of this study was to characterize the RHEB gene in the small abalone Haliotis diversicolor, and identify the responses of RHEB gene to stresses of hypoxia or/and thermal. The objectives were to: 1) clone the full-length cDNA RHEB gene in the H. diversicolor (HdRHEB); 2) quantify the expression of HdRHEB gene in tissues of haemocytes, mantle, kidney, gill, digestive tract, colleterial gland, and hepatopancreas by using RT-PCR, and 3) evaluate the responses of HdRHEB in gill and haemocyte to stresses of hypoxia (0.2 mg/100 ml), thermal (31 degrees C), and combination of hypoxia (0.4 mg/100 ml) and thermal (30 degrees C) at exposure time of 0, 4, 24, 96, and 192 h. The full length cDNA of HdRHEB was 1044 bp encoding a peptide of 182 amino acid residues. Expression of HdRHEB gene was detected in all of the 7 tissues and showed the highest in mantle (P < 0.05). Under hypoxia, expression of HdRHEB in gill increased significantly at 4 h, 24 h and 96 h (P < 0.05), and that in haemocyte increased significantly at 24 h, 96 h and 192 h (P < 0.05). Under thermal stress, expression of HdRHEB gene in gill decreased significantly at 4 h and 24 h, while expression in haemocyte decreased significantly all the time. Under thermal and hypoxia stresses, expression of HdRHEB gene in gill and haemocyte was up-regulated significantly at 24 h and 96 h (P < 0.05). The results in this study demonstrated for the first time that RHEB gene in abalones is able to response to stress stimuli of hypoxia or/and thermal.									6	0	0	0	4	0	6			1096-4959	1879-1107		WOS:000406565500006	28625796

These sulfides, however, were underexplored regarding compositional, structural, and electronic tunabilities based on the proper selection of metal constituents. Motivated by S-modified Ni delta+/Co delta+ promising to H2O2 cleavage, Ni2CoS4, NiCo2S4, NiS/CoS were synthesized and contrasted with regards to their catalytic traits. Ni2CoS4 provided the greatest activity in dissecting H2O2 among the catalysts. Nonetheless, Ni2CoS4 catalyzed H2O2 scission primarily via homogeneous catalysis mediated by leached Ni delta+/Co delta+. Conversely, NiCo2S4, NiS, and CoS catalyzed H2O2 cleavage mainly via unleached Ni delta+/Co delta+ tenabled heterogeneous catalysis. Of significance, NiCo2S4 provided Lewis acidic strength favorable to adsorb H2O2 and desorb (OH)-O-center dot compared to NiS and CoS, respectively. Of additional significance, NiCo2S4 provided S2- with lesser energy required to reduce M(delta+1-)+ via e- transfer than NiS/CoS. Hence, NiCo2S4 prompted H2O2 scission cycle per unit time better than NiS/CoS, as evidenced by kinetic assessments. NiCo2S4 was also superior to Ni(2)CoS(4)because of the elongated lifespan anticipated as( center dot)OH producer, resulting from heterogeneous catalysis with moderate Ni delta+/Co delta+ leaching. Furthermore, NiCo2S4 revealed the greatest recyclability and mineralization efficiency in decomposing recalcitrants via (OH)-O-center dot-mediated oxidation.									7	0	0	0	4	0	7			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000527016900072	32097860

The electrooxidation of the dye simulated wastewater (volume of 0.11, with a BR-19 initial concentration of 25 mg l(-1)) was carried out under the following conditions: current density of 50 mA cm(-2), volume flow rate of 2.4 1 h(-1), temperature of 25 degrees C and electrode area of 5 cm(2). The performances of the electrodes in the dye decolorization were quite similar, achieving 100% decolorization, and in some cases 90% decolorization was achieved by applying only ca. 0.3 A h l(-1) (8 min of electrolysis). The reduction of the simulated wastewater organic load, monitored by its total organic carbon content (TOC), was greater for the Ti-Pt/beta-PbO2-Fe,F electrode obtained from an electrodeposition bath containing 1 mM Fe3+ and 30 mM F-. In this case, after 2 h of electrolysis the obtained TOC reduction was 95%, while for the pure beta-PbO2 and the Nb/BDD electrodes the reductions were 84% and 82%, respectively.

The bond distances for Fe-O and Cu-O are 2.52 and 2.16 Angstrom, respectively. The structure is consistent with antiferromagnetic coupling between the two metals, which has long been known and to recent redox titration results [J. Biol. Chem. 274 (1999) 33403]. The trigonal planer coordination of Cu1+ in the O-2 reduction site is consistent with the very weak interaction between Cu1+ and O-2 bound at Fe2+ revealed by time-resolved resonance Raman investigations. One of the three histidine imidazoles coordinated to the Cu ion in the O-2 reduction site fixes a tyrosine phenol group near the O-2 reduction site with the direct covalent link between the two groups. The structure suggests that the phenol group is the site for donating protons to the bound O-2. Redox-coupled conformational change in an extramembrane loop indicates that an aspartate (Asp51) in the loop apart from the O-2 reduction site is the site for proton pumping.

In this method, a slow and controllable reduction of peroxovanadate with ethanol was used, which was the crucial step to ensure the uniform deposition of V2O5 center dot xH(2)O on an F-doped tin oxide substrate, and subsequently the annealed V2O5 center dot xH(2)O film was converted to a BiVO4 film by a simple impregnation method with Bi3+ under the oriented effect of polyethylene glycol. The converted BiVO4 film possessed a single monoclinic scheelite structure and exhibited an optimal water splitting photocurrent density of 1.10 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M KH2PO4 (pH 7) under AM 1.5G illumination with an incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency of similar to 22.4% at 400 nm using an annealed V2O5 center dot xH(2)O film deposited for 3 hours. The BiVO4 film also showed excellent water splitting performance and degradation efficiency in the PEC degradation of methylene blue and tetracycline hydrochloride with a rate constant of 0.63 h(-1) and 0.21 h(-1), respectively.									25	0	0	0	3	0	25			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000424694400022	29362762

Mn2+ associated with the depleted membranes in a nonsaturating manner when added alone, but only one Mn2+ ion per photosystem II (PS IT) was bound to the membranes in the presence of other divalent cations including Ca2+ and Mg2+. Mn2+-dependent electron donation to photosystem II studied by monitoring the decay kinetics of chlorophyll fluorescence and the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal of an oxidized Y-z tyrosine (Y-z(+)) after a single-turnover flash indicated that the binding of only one Mn2+ ion to the manganese-depleted PS II is sufficient for the complete reduction of Y-z(+) induced by Rash excitation. The results indicate that the manganese-depleted membranes have only one unique binding site, which has higher affinity and higher specificity for Mn2+ compared with Mg2+ and Ca2+, and that Mn2+ bound to this unique site can deliver an electron to Y-z(+) with high efficiency. The dissociation constant for Mn2+ of this site largely depended on pH, suggesting that a single amino acid residue with a pK(a) value around neutral pH is implicated in the binding of Mn2+. The results are discussed in relation to the photoactivation mechanism that forms the active manganese cluster.									51	1	3	0	41	0	53			0006-2960			WOS:000081440400020	10393553

The spectra include lines of O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, and Ni. We also analyze the [AI/Fe] values of 96 RGB stars in M13 covering the brightest 3.5 mag, which include 66 measurements that were derived from moderate-resolution, low signal-to-noise ratio spectra obtained with the WIYN 3.5 m telescope and Hydra multiobject spectrograph, also on Kitt Peak. In addition, we compile from the literature and inspect the [Na/Fe] values of 119 RGB stars in M13. We test for bimodality in the [AI/Fe] and [Na/Fe] distributions using the KMM algorithm and find that the [AI/Fe] values in M13 are distributed bimodally at all points along the RGB that were observed, while the [Na/Fe] values are bimodal only over the brightest 2 mag. The ratios of Al-enhanced to Al-normal and Na-enhanced to Na-normal giants increase toward the tip of the RGB in M13, which is suggestive of deep mixing in this cluster. The limited M3 data exhibit a bimodal distribution of [Al/Fe] values and are suggestive of no deep mixing; however, they are too few to be conclusive. We further test for a relationship between deep mixing on the RGB and a second parameter that can create the extended blue tail seen along the horizontal branches of some clusters by using an "instantaneous" mixing algorithm, which we develop here. We conclude that the data for both clusters are consistent with deep mixing as a "blue-tail second parameter," and we suggest future observations to further constrain the results. Finally, we offer a solution to the problem of overproducing sodium during deep mixing that is based on the depletion of Ne-22 in asymptotic giant branch stars and suggest that pollution might best be traced by s-process elements in the Sr-Y-Zr peak.									50	0	0	0	0	0	50			0004-6256	1538-3881		WOS:000089670300016

The calculations reveal the direct band gap nature of both compounds with large absorption coefficients (10(4)-10(5) cm(-1)). The absorption edges of CdLa2S4 and CdLa2Se4 occur at = 579.3 nm and = 670.1 nm, and the optical band gaps are estimated to be 2.14 eV and 1.85 eV for CdLa2S4 and CdLa2Se4, respectively. These gaps are larger than 1.23 eV the required optical band gap for photocatalytic performance to split water under visible light illumination. The calculated potentials of the conduction band and the valence band edges indicate that CdLa2S4 and CdLa2Se4 have strong reducing powers for H-2 production. The obtained results reveal that the high photogenerated carrier mobility favors enhancement of the photocatalytic performance. It has been found that there is a large mobility difference between the electrons (e(-)) and the holes (h(+)), which is useful for the separation of e(-) and h(+), reduction of e(-) and h(+) recombination rate, and improvement of the photocatalytic activity. Based on these findings, one can conclude that CdLa2S4 and CdLa2Se4 satisfied all requirements to be efficient photocatalysts. This will greatly improve the search efficiency and greatly help experiments to save resources in the exploration of new photocatalysts with good photocatalytic performances.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000428779700047	29542783

These solar-energy converters have powered life on earth for approximately 3 billion years. They facilitate light-driven carbohydrate formation from H 20 and CO2, by oxidizing the former and reducing the latter.PSII splits water in a process driven by light. Because all attractive technologies for fuel production driven by solar energy involve water oxidation, recent interest in this process carried out by PSII has increased. In this Account, we describe and apply a rationale for estimating the solar-energy conversion efficiency (eta(SOLAR)) of PSII: the fraction of the incident solar energy absorbed by the antenna pigments and eventually stored in form of chemical products. For PSII at high concentrations, approximately 34% of the incident solar energy is used for creation of the photochemistry-driving excited state, P680*, with an excited-state energy of 1.83 eV. Subsequent electron transfer results in the reduction of a bound quinone (Q(A)) and oxidation of the Tyr(z) within 1 mu ds. This radical-pair state is stable against recombination losses for approximately 1 ms. At this level, the maximal eta(SOLAR) is 23%. After the essentially irreversible steps of quinone reduction and water oxidation (the final steps catalyzed by the PSII complex), a maximum of 50% of the excited-state energy is stored in chemical form; eta(SOLAR) can be as high as 16%. Extending our considerations to a photosynthetic organism optimized to use PSII and PSI to drive H-2 production, the theoretical maximum of the solar-energy conversion efficiency would be as high as 10.5%, if all electrons and protons derived from water oxidation were used for H2 formation. The above performance figures are impressive, but they represent theoretical maxima and do not account for processes in an intact organism that lower these yields, such as light saturation, photoinhibitory, protective, and repair processes.The overpotential for catalysis of water oxidation at the Mn4Ca complex of PSII may be as low as 0.3 V. To address the specific energetics of water oxidation at the Mn complex of PSII, we propose a new conceptual framework that will facilitate quantitative considerations on the basis of oxidation potentials and pK values.In conclusion, photosynthetic water oxidation works at high efficiency and thus can serve as both an inspiring model and a benchmark in the development of future technologies for production of solar fuels.									306	8	0	0	81	1	307			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000273082800002	19908828

The full-length mecps cDNA sequence (designated as Gbineeps) was cloned and characterized for the first time from gymnosperm plant species, Ginkgo biloba, using RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) technique. The full-length cDNA of Gbmecps was 874 bp containing a 720 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a peptide of 239 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 26.03 kDa and an isoelectric point of 8.83. Comparative and bioinformatic analyses revealed that GbMECPS showed extensive homology with MECPSs from other species and contained conserved residues owned by the MECPS protein family. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that GbMECPS was more ancient than other plant MECPSs. Tissue expression pattern analysis indicated that GbMECPS expressed the highest in roots, followed by in leaves, and the lowest in seeds. The color complementation assay indicated that GbMECPS could accelerate the accumulation of beta-carotene. The cloning, characterization and functional analysis of GbMECPS will be helpful to understand more about the role of MECPS involved in the ginkgolides biosynthesis at the molecular level.									29	6	0	0	23	0	35			1225-8687			WOS:000240930200004	17002869

In this article, we have tried to expand the family of transition metal chalcogenide based highly efficient OER electrocatalysts by investigating nickel telluride, Ni3Te2 as a catalyst for the first time. Interestingly Ni3Te2 electrodeposited on a GC electrode showed very low onset potential and overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) (180 mV), which is the lowest in the series of chalcogenides with similar stoichiometry, Ni3E2 (E = S, Se, Te) as well as Ni-oxides. This observation falls in line with the hypothesis that increasing the covalency around the transition metal center enhances catalytic activity. Such a hypothesis has been previously validated in oxide-based electrocatalysts by creating anion vacancies. However, this is the first instance where this hypothesis has been convincingly validated in the chalcogenide series. The operational stability of the Ni3Te2 electrocatalyst surface during the OER for an extended period of time in alkaline medium was confirmed through surface-sensitive analytical techniques such as XPS, as well as electrochemical methods which showed that the telluride surface did not undergo any corrosion, degradation, or compositional change. More importantly we have compared the catalyst activation step (Ni2+ -> Ni3+ oxidation) in the chalcogenide series, through electrochemical cyclic voltammetry studies, and have shown that catalyst activation occurs at lower applied potential as the electronegativity of the anion decreases. From DFT calculations we have also shown that the hydroxyl attachment energy is more favorable on the Ni3Te2 surface compared to the Ni-oxide, confirming the enhanced catalytic activity of the telluride. Ni3Te2 also exhibited efficient HER catalytic activity in alkaline medium making it a very effective bifunctional catalyst for full water splitting with a cell voltage of 1.66 V at 10 mA cm(-2). It should be noted here that this is the first report of OER and HER activity in the family of Ni-tellurides.									154	1	0	0	7	0	154			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000431621700033		
J	Feng, Youzhi; Lin, Xiangui; Mao, Tingting; Zhu, Jianguo								Diversity of aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria in paddy soil and their response to elevated atmospheric CO2								MICROBIAL BIOTECHNOLOGY				4	1			74	81		10.1111/j.1751-7915.2010.00211.x				JAN 2011	2011	Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria (AAnPB) are recognized as an important group driving the global carbon cycling. However, the diversity of AAnPB in terrestrial environment remains largely unknown as well as their responses to the elevated atmospheric CO2. By using culture-independent techniques, the diversity of AAnPB in paddy soil and the changes in response to the rising atmospheric CO2 were investigated within China FACE (Free-air CO2 enrichment) platform. There was a phylogenetically diverse AAnPB community with large population size residing in paddy soil. The community structure of AAnPB in bulk and rhizospheric soils stayed almost identical, while the population size was higher in rhizospheric [2.0-2.5 x 10(8) copy number of pufM genes g(-1) dry weight soil (d.w.s.)] than that in bulk (0.7-0.8 x 10(8) g(-1) d.w.s.) soils. Elevated atmospheric CO2 appeared to significantly stimulate AAnPB abundance (up to 1.4-1.5 x 10(8) g(-1) d.w.s.) and result in a higher AAnPB percentage in total bacterial community (from 0.5% up to 1.5%) in bulk soil, whereas no significant effect was observed in rhizospheric soil. Our results would extend the functional ecotypes of AAnPB and indicate that environmental changes associated with the rising atmospheric CO2 might affect AAnPB community in paddy soil.									7	1	0	0	7	0	8			1751-7915			WOS:000289738800008	21255374

A comparative X-ray absorption study								BIOCHEMISTRY				39	24			7033	7040		10.1021/bi9924258				JUN 20 2000	2000	Detailed information on room-temperature structure and oxidation state of the Photosystem II (PS II) manganese complex is needed to put mechanistic considerations on solid grounds. Because previously this information had not been available, the tetranuclear manganese complex was investigated by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) on PS II membrane particles at 290 K. Due to methodical progress (collection of XAS spectra within 10 s or less), significant X-ray radiation damage can be avoided; room-temperature XAS investigations on the PS II in its native membrane environment become feasible. Thus, the ambiguity with respect to the mechanistic relevance of low-temperature XAS results is avoidable. At 290 K as well as at 18 K, the manganese complex in its dark-stable state (S-1-state) seemingly is a Mn(III)(2)Mn(IV)(2) complex comprising two di-mu(2)-oxo bridged binuclear manganese units characterized by the same Mn-Mn distance of 2.71-2.72 Angstrom at both temperatures. Most likely, manganese oxidation states and the protonation state of the bridging oxides are fully temperature independent. Remarkably, at room-temperature manganese-ligand distances of 3.10 and 3.65 Angstrom are clearly discernible in the EXAFS spectra. The type of bridging assumed to result in Mn-Mn or Mn-Ca distances around 3.1 Angstrom is, possibly, temperature-dependent as suggested by distance lengthening upon cooling by 0.13 Angstrom. However, mechanistic proposals on photosynthetic water oxidation, which involve the dimer-of-dimers model [Yachandra, V. K., ct al. (1993) Science 260, 675-679] are not invalidated by the presented results.									41	0	0	0	23	0	41			0006-2960			WOS:000087778300001	10852700

The temperature was also controlled at 25, 35, and 45 A degrees C (+/- 2 A degrees C); the samples were monitored for colour changes; and selected chemical parameters were at 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 days. Colorimetric indices, CIELab parameters and spectra were also determined with UV-Vis spectrometry. Visible light modified the colour of brandy and an important colour decrease was observed, showing maximum values (Delta E (ab)*) at 25 A degrees C, under the studied experimental conditions. On the contrary, at higher temperatures, significant colour degradation was not revealed. Non-colour parameters were not significantly affected by both irradiation and storage temperatures (p > 0.05). Kinetic parameters including rate constant and activation energy were calculated. Based on Arrhenius model, activation energies of a*, browning index and h (ab)* at darkness were 12.2, 55.1, and 21.6 kJ mol(-1) respectively.									8	0	0	0	3	0	8			1935-5130	1935-5149		WOS:000340050400014

Both MOP-based and MOF-derived materials in powder form have been widely investigated in relation to their synthesis methods, structure and morphology controls, and performance advantages in targeted applications. However, to engage them for energy applications, both binders and additives would be required to form postprocessed electrodes, fundamentally eliminating some of the active sites and thus degrading the superior effects of the MOF-based/derived materials. The advancement of freestanding electrodes provides a new promising platform for MOFbased/derived materials in EESC thanks to their apparent merits, including fast electron/ charge transmission and seamless contact between active materials and current collectors. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of freestanding structures and MOF-based/derived materials, outstanding electrochemical performance in EESC can be achieved, stimulating the increasing enthusiasm in recent years. This review provides a timely and comprehensive overview on the structural features and fabrication techniques of freestanding MOF-based/derived electrodes. Then, the latest advances in freestanding MOF-based/derived electrodes are summarized from electrochemical energy storage devices to electrocatalysis. Finally, insights into the currently faced challenges and further perspectives on these feasible solutions of freestanding MOF-based/derived electrodes for EESC are discussed, aiming at providing a new set of guidance to promote their further development in scale-up production and commercial applications.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0009-2665	1520-6890		WOS:000810028700001	35446541

This study presents a facile and simple, visible-light-assisted, photocatalytic reduction of graphene oxide (GO) by using BVO for the preparation of highly stable BVO/reduced GO (rGO) nanocomposites with two different rGO weight ratios (5% and 10%). These as-prepared BVO/rGO nanocomposites were then drop-cast on an FTO substrate to demonstrate the key role played by the rGO in greatly improving the electron transport in the BVO/rGO films. In PEC water splitting experiments, the BVO/rGO-10% photoelectrode showed the highest photo current density (554.4 mu A cm(-2) at 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgC1), compared to BVO (111.7 mu A cm(-2)) and BVO/rGO-5% (377.9 mu A cm(-2)). The stable BVO/rGO also showed the highest charge carrier density, with an extended lifetime and improved the electrical conductivity, as compared to BVO. These results contributed to the excellent PEC performance of the BVO/rGO photoanode. Under simulated solar light illumination, the open-circuit potential (OCP) of the BVO/rGO films was shifted to a more negative value due to the enhanced electron-hole separation in the films. The photocurrent yields of the BVO and BVO/rGO electrodes were dependent on the solution pH. The photocurrent densities were higher over the full range of measured potential (0 to + 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl) in the NaOH electrolyte (1 M, pH = 13.5) than in the Na2SO4 electrolyte (0.1 M, pH = 6.5). This work demonstrates the essential role of the rGO coverage in the great enhancement of electron transport through the rGO in the BVO/rGO film.									87	0	0	0	12	0	87			0927-0248	1879-3398		WOS:000437816100045

To prepare an IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti anode, a Ti substrate was dipped in the precursor, baked at 80 or 90 degrees C for different periods, and then thermally decomposed at 450 degrees C for 30 min in the air furnace. The electrochemical properties of prepared IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti anodes were evaluated through their voltammetric charges measured in the 1 M H2SO4 solution and their performance lives tested with 2 Acm(-2) in the 1 M H2SO4 + 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution. Microstructures of prepared IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti anodes were characterized with x-ray diffractometer. The chemical compositions and surface morphologies of prepared IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti anodes were analyzed with scanning electron microscope equipped with energy-dispersive x-ray spectrometer. Based on the results of x-ray diffraction, only IrO2-diffracted peaks were detected from prepared IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti anodes. A mud-crack surface structure was seen from prepared IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti coatings. The crack density and the crack width of an IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti coating were obviously affected by different thermal pretreatments of baking methods and heating rates. The crack width of IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti coating increased with an increasing the baking time. A relatively high voltammetric charge can be found from the IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti anode with wide cracks and high crack density. On the other hand, long lifetime values were detected from the IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti anode with a crack width more than 2 mu m. The highest voltammetric charge was detected from the IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti anode prepared through baking at 90 degrees C for 180 s. On the other hand, the longest lifetime was found from the IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti anode pretreated with continuous heating at a rate of 7 degrees C/min.

PCC 6803. This mutant, SK18, lacked any photosystem II (PSII) activity, but had normal photosystem I. The SK18 mutant strain could not be complemented with known genes encoding various structural proteins of PSII, but could be complemented with a recombinant plasmid pSL523 containing a 1.4-kilobase pair EcoRI fragment of the chromosomal DNA from wild-type Synechocystis 6803 cells. Determination of the nucleotide sequence of this DNA fragment revealed a previously unidentified open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 427-residue-long polypeptide. Hydrophobicity analysis of the amino acid sequence suggested that this protein is largely hydrophilic. A stretch of the first 31 amino-terminal residues of the polypeptide resembled a bacterial signal peptide and may be responsible for the translocation of this protein to the lumen space of the thylakoid membranes. The spontaneous mutation in the SK18 strain was identified to be a single nucleotide change introducing a premature termination codon in this ORF. The predicted sequence of the encoded protein showed significant similarity to that of the Pre protein, a carboxyl-terminal processing protease in Escherichia coli. We suggest that the cyanobacterial protein encoded by ORF427 is a similar processing protease and name the gene ctpA (carboxyl-terminal processing protease).									90	5	0	0	81	0	98			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:A1994NY33200026	8034700

This is much smaller than sperm whale myoglobin by 32 residues, suggesting a distinct origin from the common globin gene. We have therefore examined this unique protein for its structural, spectral and stability properties. As a result, the rate of autoxidation of Tetrahymena oxymyoglobin (MbO(2)) was found to be almost comparable to that of sperm whale MbO(2) over a wide range of pH 4-12 in 0.1 M buffer at 25 degreesC. Moreover, both pH profiles exhibited the remarkable proton-assisted process, which can be performed in sperm whale myoglobin by the distal (E7) histidine as its catalytic residue. These kinetic observations are also in full accord with spectral examinations for the presence of a distal histidine in ciliated protozoa myoglobin. At the same time, we have isolated the globin genes both from T. pyriformis and Tetrahymena thermophila, and found that there is no intron in their genomic structures. This is in sharp contrast to previous reports on the homologous globin genes from Paramecium caudatum and Chlamydomonas eugametos. Rather, the Tetrahymena genes seemed to be related to the cyanobacterial globin gene from Nostoc commune. These contracted or truncated globins thus have a marked diversity in the cDNA, protein, and genomic structures. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The challenges for the widespread use of water electrolysis are to reduce energy consumption, cost and maintenance and to increase the reliability, durability and safety of the process. The alkaline electrolysis of water has been used for many years to obtain H-2 and O-2; however, less expensive, more active, endurable and efficient electrodes must be designed. Stainless steel (SS) is considered one of the least expensive electrode materials for alkaline electrolysers, since it is relatively chemically stable and has a low overpotential. Nevertheless, SS anodes do not withstand high concentration alkaline solutions because they undergo a corrosion process. If the electrolyser operates at a voltage of up to 1.6 V, it can generate Fe3O4 and hazardous hexavalent chromium (Cr6+) at the anode. Hexavalent chromium is generated when the chromium-containing stainless steel electrodes undergo an electro-oxidation process. In this work, a low power alkaline electrolyser was designed. In the first step, six electrodes were manufactured of stainless steel. In the second step, a nickel layer with matte or opaque finish was deposited on the SS surfaces to improve their resistance to corrosion and wear. Then, the performance curves and the production of hexavalent chromium were determined. The performance curve after 70 h of operation with nickel-plated electrodes showed an overpotential of 0.5 V at 10 A compared with stainless steel electrodes. Cr6+ was detected in the electrolyte and bubbler water of the system using SS electrodes at values that exceeded the standard (>0.5-1 mg L-1). If the electrolyser used Ni-electrodeposited electrodes, Cr6+ was observed in quantities within the normal range (<0.1 mg L-1). It is very important to prepare modified anodes with nickel electro-deposited, this process prevents the generation of hexavalent chromium, contamination of the electrolyte and reduces maintenance times. The above compensates the slight increase in electrodes cost and energy consumed by the electrolyser. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Temperatures were estimated from observations of CH3CCH, NH3, and CO. Densities were obtained from a multitransition study of HC3N. The values of the density and temperature allow column densities for 13 molecular species to be estimated from statistical equilibrium calculations, using observations of rarer isotopomers where possible, to minimize opacity effects. The most striking abundance variations relative to HCO+ along the ridge were seen for HC3N, CH3CCH, and SO, while smaller variations were seen in CS, C2H, and HCN. On the other hand, the NH3, HNC, and N2H+ abundances relative to HCO+ were determined to be constant, indicating that the so-called NH3 peak in TMC-1 is probably a peak in the ammonia column density rather than a relative abundance peak. In contrast, the well-studied cyanopolyyne peak is most likely due to an enhancement in the abundance of long-chain carbon species.Comparisons of the derived abundances to the results of time-dependent chemical models show good overall agreement for chemical timescales around 10(5) yr. We find that the observed abundance gradients can be explained either by a small variation in the chemical timescale from 1.2 x 10(5) to 1.8 x 10(5) yr or by a factor of 2 change in the density along the ridge. Alternatively, a variation in the C/O ratio from 0.4 to 0.5 along the ridge produces an abundance gradient similar to that observed.									214	0	0	0	2	0	214			0004-637X			WOS:A1997XX17300023	11540493

The samples have been investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) using Rietveld refinement, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and dielectric spectroscopy. The SEM images showed spherical-shaped agglomerates having a non-uniform distribution of size. The EDX results suggested that the experimental chemical composition was in good accordance with the nominal values. FT-IR revealed multiple peaks in the range of 580-510 cm(-1) due to asymmetric stretching of the octahedron. The reflectance spectra showed characteristic d -> d transitions arising from the Fe 3d and the highest optical band gap energy (E-g) of 2.57 eV was exhibited by LaFeO3, while the lowest E-g (1.41 eV) was shown by La1-xCaxFeO3 with x = 0.6. The results suggest that these samples are suitable for photocatalytic applications. From phase evaluation of the diffraction patterns, it was found that five distinct phases exist in the series. A phase transformation from orthorhombic (Pnma) to cubic (Pm (3) over barm) was found when x was increased from 0.4 to 0.6. TGA showed that LaFeO3 was the most stable with a residual mass of similar to 97 wt% at 900 degrees C compared to CaFeO3 (similar to 70 wt% at 900 degrees C). The evaluation of frequency-dependent (20 Hz-20 MHz) dielectric properties agreed with the Maxwell-Wagner two-layer model. After Ca2+ substitution, tan6 at 20 Hz significantly reduced from similar to 10(3) for x= 0 to similar to 10(0) for x = 1.0. The high polarization observed was due to e(-) hopping between Fe2+<-> Fe3+. The electrical models of the samples show non-Debye type relaxation behavior, while the ac conductivity enhanced with increasing frequency which was in accordance with Koop's phenomenological theory.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0947-8396	1432-0630		WOS:000800942400001

GENERAL-PROPERTIES AND CORRELATION OF ENERGY-STORAGE TO P-700 REDOX STATE								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				29	2			87	96		10.1007/BF00035379				AUG 1991	1991	Energy storage measurements by modulated photothermal radiometry (PTR) were carried out on intact leaves to assess the value of the PTR method for photosynthesis research. In particular, correlations to the redox state of P700 under various conditions were examined. PTR monitors modulated light conversion to heat by sensing the resulting modulated infra-red radiation emitted from the leaf. It is, therefore, a complementary method to photoacoustics for estimating energy storage and its time variation, particularly under controlled leaf atmosphere.With modulated light-1 (lambda > 690 nm) the energy storage approached zero and P700 was maximally oxidized. When background light of shorter wavelength (lambda < 690 nm-light-2) was added, energy storage momentarily increased (a manifestation of Emerson enhancement) while P700 was reduced. The values of both parameters varied as a function of the background light intensity, keeping a mutual linear relationship. Following the initial change, there was a slow reversal transient of P700 oxidation with a parallel decrease in energy storage. Temporal correlation to P700 redox state after dark adaptation was observed also for the energy storage measured in modulated light 2 when combined with background actinic light of medium intensity (about 50 W m2). Under these circumstances P700 was almost totally oxidized initially and then gradually reduced while energy storage was initially low and then increased parallel to P700 reduction.A comparison between the maximum energy storage in modulated light 1, enhanced by background light 2, to the energy storage with short wavelength light (where light tends to be more evenly distributed) indicates a comparable contribution to energy storage from each active photosystem. The above experiments indicate that energy storage contribution from PS I is directly related to the extent of openness of its reaction-centers.While some aspects of the data call for more experimentation, these experiments already establish PTR as a valuable method to monitor photosynthetic energy storage activity in vivo, particularly when used simultaneously with other non-invasive methods.									11	0	0	0	11	0	11			0166-8595			WOS:A1991GN61600003	24415110	
J	Boothroyd, AI; Sackmann, IJ								The CNO isotopes: Deep circulation in red giants and first and second dredge-up								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				510	1			232	250		10.1086/306546				JAN 1 1999	1999	It is demonstrated that deep circulation mixing below the base of the standard convective envelope, and the consequent '"cool bottom processing" (CBP) of the CNO isotopes, can reproduce the trend with stellar mass of the C-12/C-13 observations in low-mass red giants. (This trend is opposite to what is expected from standard first dredge-up.) Our models assume that extra mixing always reaches to the same distance in temperature from the II-burning shell and that CBP begins when the II-burning shell erases the molecular weight discontinuity ("mu-barrier") established by first dredge-up. For Population I stars, none of the other CNO isotopes except N-15 are expected to be altered by CBP. (If O-18 depletion occurs on the asymptotic giant branch [AGB], as some observations suggest, it would require that extra mixing reach closer to the H-burning shell on the AGE than on the red giant branch [RGB]-and should also result in a much lower C-12/C-13 ratio than is observed in the relevant AGE stars.)CBP increases dramatically as one reduces the stellar mass or metallicity-roughly as M-2 on the RGB, because of the longer RGB of low-mass stars, and roughly as Z(-1), because of the higher II-shell burning temperatures of low-metallicity stars. In low-mass Population IT stars, all the CNO isotopes are expected to be significantly altered by CBP. Field Population II stars exhibit RGB abundances consistent with the predictions of our CBP models that have been normalized to reproduce the Population I RGB abundances. On the other hand, globular cluster stars are observed to encounter much more extensive processing; additionally, CBP is observed to start near the base of the globular cluster RGB (overcoming any "mu-barrier"). For the CNO isotopes C-12, C-13, N-14, O-16, O-17, and O-18, we also present self-consistent calculations of the consequences of both first and second dredge-up, i.e., of standard convection during the RGB and AGE stages, over a wide range of stellar masses (0.8-9 M-.) and metallicities (Z = 0.02-0.0001). We demonstrate that the common low- and intermediate-mass stars are a prime source of C-13, N-14, and O-17 in the universe. The light elements (He-3, He-4, Li-7, Be-9, B-10, and B-11) are discussed in a companion paper.									276	1	1	0	2	1	278			0004-637X			WOS:000079157400021

The role of p70S6K in these physiological processes in crustaceans remains, however, unknown. In this study, the Lvp70S6K was identified, containing a 5' UTR of 294 bp, an ORF of 1494 bp ad a 3' UTR of 211 bp, encoding 497 amino acids with a theoretical molecular weight of 70 kDa and an estimated isoelectric point of (pI) of 5.16. The multiple alignment found that Lvp70S6K was highly homologous with other invertebrates. Lvp70S6K mRNA was detected in all the tested tissues and the Lvp70S6K expression levels was significantly down-regulated and reached the lowest level (0.44-fold, p < 0.01) at 1.5 h after low temperature stress. The subcellular localization of Lvp70S6K could be detected in cytoplasm. ROS production was significantly upregulation (1.19-fold, p < 0.01), total hemocyte count (THC) was significantly down-regulation (0.22-fold, p < 0.01), apoptosis rate was markedly increased (1.09-fold, p < 0.01), apoptosis-related genes of LvPDCD4 (1.61-fold, p < 0.01) and LvCyt.C (1.23-fold, p < 0.01) were up-regulated, and anti-apoptotic gene of LvBcl-2 (0.69-fold, p < 0.01), LvIAP1 (0.68-fold, p < 0.01) and LvIAP2 (0.45-fold, p < 0.01) were decreased after low temperature stress in hemolymph of Lvp70S6K-silenced shrimp at 1.5 h. Silencing of LvPTEN significantly increased Lvp70S6K, LvPI3K, LvAKT and LvmTOR expression. In summary, these results indicated that Lvp70S6K play a crucial role in oxidative and apoptosis, which was able to negatively regulate by PTEN.									1	0	0	0	2	0	2			1050-4648	1095-9947		WOS:000579494400067	32858183

On the basis of earlier work by our group, a structure for the tetranuclear manganese complex of PS II, which consists of two di-mu-oxo-bridged binuclear Mn units linked by a mono-mu-oxo group, has been proposed [Yachandra, V. K., et al. (1993) Science 260, 675-679]. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) of the complex modified by NH3 binding in the S-2-state is suggestive of an increase in the Mn-Mn distance of one of these units from 2.72 +/- 0.02 to 2.87 +/- 0.02 Angstrom, whereas the Mn-Mn distance of the second unit seems to be unaffected by NH3 treatment. The elongation of one binuclear center could result from the replacement of one bridging mu-oxo by an amido group. The lengthening of one Mn-Mn distance means that, by NH3 treatment, the distance degeneracy of the 2.7 Angstrom Mn-Mn EXAFS interaction is removed. Consequently, the orientation of individual binuclear units with respect to the membrane normal becomes resolvable by EXAFS spectroscopy of partially oriented PS II membrane particles. The angle between the normal of the PS II-containing membrane and the Mn-Mn vector is determined to be 67 degrees +/- 3 degrees for the 2.87 Angstrom distance and 55 degrees +/- 4 degrees for the 2.72 Angstrom distance. Only small effects on position, shape, and orientation dependence of Mn K-edge spectra result from NH3 treatment, indicating that the Mn oxidation state, the symmetry of the Mn ligand environment, and the orientation of the complex remain essentially unaffected in the annealed NH3 S-2-state. Therefore, it seems likely that the angles determined for the ammonia-modified manganese complex are similar to the respective angles of the untreated complex. The structure of the manganese complex and its orientation in the membrane are discussed.									104	1	0	0	47	0	104			0006-2960			WOS:A1995QU26000043	7711049

Around pH 6, the maximum signal intensities were detected. On both the acidic and alkaline sides of pH 6, the intensities of the EPR signals decreased. Two pKs were determined for the So multiline signal; pK(1) = 4.2 +/- 0.2 and pK(2) = 8.0 +/- 0.1, and for the S2 multiline signal the pKs were pK(1) = 4.5 +/- 0.1 and pK(2) = 7.6 +/- 0.1. The intensity of the So-state: EPR signal was partly restored when the pH was changed from acidic or alkaline pH back to pH approximate to 6. In the S2 State we observed partial recovery of the multiline signal when going from alkaline pH back to pH approximate to 6, whereas no significant recovery of the S2 multiline signal was observed when the pH was changed from acidic pH back to pH approximate to 6. Several possible explanations for the intensity changes as a function of pH are discussed. Some are ruled out, such as disintegration of the Mn cluster or decay of the S states and formal Cl- and Ca2+ depletion. The altered EPR signal intensities probably reflect the protonation/deprotonation of ligands to the Mn cluster or the oxo bridges between the Mn ions. Also, the possibility of decreased multiline signal intensities at alkaline pH as an effect of changed redox potential of Yz is put forward.									18	0	0	0	14	0	18			0006-2960			WOS:000087631000003	10841755

(1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U.S.A. 92, 3209-3213]. We have since improved the time resolution for these measurements by a further factor of 3 and report here the first detailed kinetics for the fast phase of exchange. First-order exchange kinetics were determined from mass spectrometric measurements of photogenerated O-2 as a function of time after injection of (H2O)-O-18 into spinach thylakoid samples preset in the S-3 State at 10 degrees C. For measurements made at m/e = 34 (i.e., for the mixed labeled O-16,18(2) product), the two kinetic components are observed: a slow component with k(1) = 2.2 +/- 0.1 s(-1) (t(1/2) similar to 315 ms) and a fast component with k(2) = 38 +/- 4 s(-1) (t(1/2) similar to 18 ms). When the isotopic exchange is measured at m/e = 36 (i.e,, for the double labeled O-18,18(2) product), only the slow component (k(1)) is observed, clearly indicating that the substrate water undergoing slow isotopic exchange provides the rate-limiting step in the formation of the double labeled O-18,18(2) product. When the isotopic exchange is measured as a function of temperature, the two kinetic components reveal different temperature dependencies in which k(1) increases by a factor of 10 over the range 0-20 degrees C while k(2) increases by only a factor of 3. Assuming simple Arrhenius behavior, the activation energies are estimated to be 78 +/- 10 kJ mol(-1) for the slow component and 39 +/- 5 kJ mol(-1) for the fast component. The different kinetic components in the O-18 isotopic exchange provide firm evidence that the two substrate water molecules undergo separate exchange processes at two different chemical sites in the S-3 state, prior to the O-2 release step (t(1/2) similar to 1 ms at 20 degrees C). The results are discussed in terms of how the substrate water may be bound at two separate metal sites.

While the S-2 multiline signals exhibited by these samples differed very little in spectral shape, a significant increase of the relaxation rate of the signal was detected in the multiflash samples as compared to the S-2-state produced by a single oxidation. A similar relaxation rate increase was observed for the EPR signal from Y-D(.). The temperature dependence of the multiline spin-lattice relaxation rate is similar after 1 and 5 flashes. These data are discussed together with previously reported phenomena in terms of a light-adaptation process of PSII, which commences on the third flash after dark-adaptation and is completed after 10 flashes. At room temperature, the fast-relaxing, light-adapted state falls back to the slow-relaxing, dark-adapted state with t(1/2) = 80 s. We speculate that light-adaptation involves changes necessary for efficient continuous water splitting. This would parallel activation processes found in many other large redox enzymes, such as Cytochrome c oxidase and Ni-Fe hydrogenase. Several mechanisms of light-adaptation are discussed, and we find that the data may be accounted for by a change of the PSII protein matrix or by the light-induced appearance of a paramagnetic center on the PSII donor side. At this time, no EPR signal has been detected that correlates with the increase of the relaxation rates, and the nature of such a new paramagnet remains unclear. However, the relaxation enhancement data could be used, in conjunction with the known Mn-Y-D distance, to estimate the position of such an unknown relaxer. If positioned between Y-D and the Mn cluster, it would be located 7-8 Angstrom from the spin center of the S-2 multiline signal.									6	0	0	0	4	0	6			0006-2960			WOS:000181372200028	12614170

To study the possible role of the heme of the cytochrome c(550) we constructed two mutants of Thermosynechococcus elongatus in which the residue His-92, the sixth ligand of the heme, was replaced by a Met or a Cys in order to modify the redox properties of the heme. The H92M and H92C mutations changed the midpoint redox potential of the heme in the isolated cytochrome by +125 mV and -30 mV, respectively, compared with the wild type. The binding-induced increase of the redox potential observed in the wild type and the H92C mutant was absent in the H92M mutant. Both modified cytochromes were more easily detachable from the Photosystem II compared with the wild type. The Photosystem II activity in cells was not modified by the mutations suggesting that the redox potential of the cytochrome c(550) is not important for Photosystem II activity under normal growth conditions. A mutant lacking the cytochrome c(550) was also constructed. It showed a lowered affinity for Cl- and Ca2+ as reported earlier for the cytochrome c(550)-less Synechocystis 6803 mutant, but it showed a shorter lived S(2)Q(B)(-) state, rather than a stabilized S-2 state and rapid deactivation of the enzyme in the dark, which were characteristic of the Synechocystis mutant. It is suggested that the latter effects may be caused by loss ( or weaker binding) of the other extrinsic proteins rather than a direct effect of the absence of the cytochrome c(550).									31	0	0	0	28	0	32			0021-9258			WOS:000225680600011	15385568

(1997) Biochemistry 36, 16277-16281] was tested by investigation of its influence on the kinetics and yield of photoactivation, the light-induced assembly of the functional inorganic core (Mn4OyCa1Clx) starting from the cofactor-depleted apo-WOC-PSII center and free Mn2+, Ca2+, and Cl-. Two binding sites for bicarbonate were found that stimulate photoactivation by accelerating the information and suppressing the decay, respectively, of the first light-induced assembly intermediate, IM1 [apo-WOC-Mn(OH)(2)(+)]. A high-affinity bicarbonate site (K-D less than or equal to 10 mu M) stimulates both the rate of recovery of O-2 evolving centers and decreases (by a factor of 1.2-3) t(lag), the time for formation of IM1. This stimulation involves enhanced binding of the initial Mn2+ and occurs only at concentrations of Mn2+ at or below the stoichiometric requirements for water oxidation (less than or equal to 4 Mn/PSII) and disappears above 4 Mn/PSII. The absence of an effect from added bicarbonate on photoactivation kinetics and yield at saturating concentrations of Mn2+ and Ca2+ may be due to the availability of atmospheric bicarbonate dissolve in the buffers (similar to 4 mu M at pH 6.0) sufficient for photoactivation. The second bicarbonate site also stimulates the rate of formation of IM1 but has much lower affinity (K-D approximately millimolar) and becomes observable only at low concentrations of Ca2+ that are limiting for photoactivation. This stimulation effect appears to occur by complexation of free Ca2+, thereby reducing its activity in competing with Mn2+ in the formation of IM1. Bicarbonate had no effect on the calcium effector site responsible for the rate-limiting dark step of photoactivation (Ca2+ binding to IM1). Four interpretations of the high-affinity bicarbonate effect may be advanced as testable hypothesis: bicarbonate may (1) act as an integral cofactor within the WOC (possible ligand to the first Mn), (2) act as a Bronsted base to accelerate proton release during formation of either the dark precursor [apo-WOC-Mn(OH)(+)] or IM1 [apo-WOC-Mn(OH)(2)(+)], (3) directly deliver one or more hydroxide ions during formation of the latter two species (with release of CO2), or (4) act as a membrane-soluble anion that electrostatically elevates the local concentration of Mn2+ in PSII. These results support a possible biogeochemical role for bicarbonate in the evolution of the first oxygenic photosynthetic organism. An improvement in the illumination method for photoactivation is presented in which light flashes of increasing during are used to extend the pre-steady-state lag phase and to suppress photoinhibition, thereby improving the accuracy of t(lag) determination.									57	2	3	0	40	0	61			0006-2960			WOS:000087399700016	10821678	
J	Feng, Yaqi; Rui, Lin; Wang, Xinyu; Wu, Xiaoqin								Adaptation of pine wood nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, early in its interaction with two Pinus species that differ in resistance								JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH				33	4			1391	1400		10.1007/s11676-021-01416-7		NOV 2021		AUG 2022	2022	Pine wilt disease (PWD) is one of the most devastating diseases of Pinus spp. and is caused by the pine wood nematode (PWN), Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner & Buhrer) Nickle. To study adaptation of PWN to survive in hosts that differ in resistance, we examined the self-regulatory characteristics of PWN at the biological and molecular levels early in the interaction. Two-year-old susceptible Pinus thunbergii and resistant Pinus taeda were selected for this experiment, and changes in PWNs after inoculation were assessed. qRT-PCR was used to detect changes in genes related to PWN pathogenicity and detoxification. The results showed that the migration and reproductive abilities of PWNs in P. thunbergii were stronger than those of PWNs in P. taeda. After 7 d, the number of nematodes in P. thunbergii was approximately 3.2-fold higher than in P. taeda. After 15 d, the number of nematodes in P. thunbergii was approximately twofold higher than that in P. taeda. Because PWN can adjust its sex ratio after infection, we compared the sex ratio of uninoculated PWNs, to that in the two pine species. In P. thunbergii, the female to male ratio first decreased and then stabilized over time; in P. taeda first decreased and then increased. Relative fat accumulation in PWNs increased significantly after the PWNs entered the tree body; the accumulation rate in P. thunbergii was higher than in P. taeda at 7 d, but lower after 15 d. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed significantly more bacteria on the surface of PWNs in P. taeda compared with PWNs in susceptible P. thunbergii. At 12 h after inoculation, the expression of genes related to cell-wall degradation (BxBeta1-4 and Bxpel1), effectors (BxCDP1, BxSapB1), and active oxygen metabolism (Bxy-ctl-1 and BxGST3) was 2-6 x higher in the resistant pine than in the susceptible one. In contrast, in PWNs, the expression of autophagy-related genes BxATG1 and BxATG16 was 1.5-2 times higher in P. thunbergii than in P. taeda. These results indicate that the interaction between PWNs and pine trees with different resistance levels elicits a series of physiological and molecular adaptations that affect nematode reproduction and virulence. This study will help elucidate the adaptive mechanisms of PWN in different pine trees.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1007-662X	1993-0607		WOS:000715194600001

In this study, a novel CDs modified g-C3N4/ SnO2 photocatalyst (CDs/g-C3N4/ SnO2) was successfully synthesized by the thermal polymerization. Under visible light irradiation, the resulting CDs/g-C3N4/SnO2 photocatalyst exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity for the degradation of indomethacin (IDM). It was demonstrated that a 0.5 % loading content of CDs led to the highest IDM degradation rate, which was 5.62 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4. This improved photocatalytic activity might have been attributed to the unique up-conversion photoluminescence (PL) properties and efficient charge separation capacities of the CDs. Moreover, the combination of g-C3N4 with SnO2 improved the separation of photoinduced carriers and augmented the specific surface area. Reactive species (RSs) scavenging experiments and electron spin resonance (ESR) revealed that superoxide radical anions (O-2(-)) and photogenerated holes (11.1 played critical roles during the photocatalytic process. The results of the detection of H2O2 and ESR confirmed that CDs/g-C3N4/ SnO2 was a Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst. Further, HRAM LC-MS/MS was employed to identify the byproducts of IDM, and the major IDM degradation pathways of the CDs/g-C3N4/SnO2 photocatalyst were proposed. This study provides new ideas for the design of novel CDs modified photocatalysts for environmental remediation.									84	1	0	0	23	0	85			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000581684900009	32659572	
J	Li, Mian; Yang, Jirong; Lu, Mingjiao; Zhang, Yingjie; Bo, Xiangjie								Facile design of ultrafine Co7Fe3 nanoparticles coupled with nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanosheets for non-enzymatic glucose detection								JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE				555				449	459		10.1016/j.jcis.2019.07.099				NOV 1 2019	2019	Ultrafine Co7Fe3 nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanosheets (denoted as Co7Fe3/NPCSs) are successfully synthesized by utilizing porous plant tissue as a precursor. The morphological, structural, and chemical contents of the Co7Fe3/NPCSs and other control samples are analyzed by X-ray (powder) diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N-2 adsorption-desorption, Raman spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma (ICP), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. The glucose oxidation and detection performances of each catalyst are evaluated by using cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The experimental results demonstrate that the electrocatalytic abilities of the resultant catalysts toward glucose oxidation decrease in the order of Co7Fe3/NPCSs > Co/NPCSs > CoFe/NPCSs > Fe2C-Co3Fe7/NPCSs > Fe2C/NPCSs. The experimental results prove that a small number of Fe atoms in Co7Fe3 can increase the number of active Co4+ sites. Meanwhile, the ultrafine Co7Fe3 nanoparticles uniformly dispersed along the porous carbon nanosheets' surfaces, which further improved the dispersion of the abundant electrochemically available active sites. Due to the synergistic effect of the hierarchical porous structures, high-density active sites and excellent electron conductivity, the optimal Co7Fe3/NPCSs display the best glucose detection efficiency of all the catalysts examined. For instance, the Co7Fe3/NPCSs exhibit large sensitivity values (795.28 mu A cm(-2) mM(-1) between 0.001 and 2.20 mM and 401.98 mu A cm(-2) mM(-1) between 2.20 and 14.00 mM), a rapid response time (2.2 s), a low detection limit (1.0 mu M), excellent anti-interference toward electroactive molecules, a perfect reproducibility and a superior long-term stability. The Co7Fe3/NPCSs also exhibit a satisfying efficiency for glucose detection in human serum samples. Finally, our low-cost synthetic strategy can advance research used for designing 3D hierarchical meso/macroporous noble-metal-free catalysts without any tedious steps or templates.

J	Ma, Haoli; Zhao, Heming; Liu, Zhi; Zhao, Jie								The Phytocyanin Gene Family in Rice (Oryza sativa L.): Genome-Wide Identification, Classification and Transcriptional Analysis								PLOS ONE				6	10					e25184	10.1371/journal.pone.0025184				OCT 3 2011	2011	Background: Phytocyanins (PCs) are plant-specific blue copper proteins involved in electron transport, and a large number of known PCs are considered to be chimeric arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs). To date there has not been a genome-wide overview of the OsPC gene family. Therefore, as the first step and a useful strategy to elucidate the functions of OsPCs, there is an urgent need for a thorough genome-wide analysis of this gene family.Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, a total of 62 OsPC genes were identified through a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome. Based on phylogeny and motif constitution, the family of OsPCs was classified into three subclasses: uclacyanin-like proteins (OsUCLs), stellacyanin-like proteins (OsSCLs) and early nodulin-like proteins (OsENODLs). Structure and glycosylation prediction indicated that 46 OsPCs were glycosylphosphatigylinositolanchored proteins and 38 OsPCs were chimeric AGPs. Gene duplication analysis revealed that chromosomal segment and tandem duplications contributed almost equally to the expansion of this gene family, and duplication events were mostly happened in the OsUCL subfamily. The expression profiles of OsPC genes were analyzed at different stages of vegetative and reproductive development and under abiotic stresses. It revealed that a large number of OsPC genes were abundantly expressed in the various stages of development. Moreover, 17 genes were regulated under the treatments of abiotic stresses.Conclusions/Significance: The genome-wide identification and expression analysis of OsPC genes should facilitate research in this gene family and give new insights toward elucidating their functions in higher plants.									39	5	0	0	29	0	44			1932-6203			WOS:000295943000013	21984902	
J	Ohlberger, Jan				Ohlberger, Jan/H-3262-2019	Ohlberger, Jan/0000-0001-6795-240X			Climate warming and ectotherm body size - from individual physiology to community ecology								FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY				27	4	SI		991	1001		10.1111/1365-2435.12098				AUG 2013	2013	1. Accumulating evidence suggests that the average body size of many organisms is declining in response to climate warming. This phenomenon has been suggested to represent a universal response to warming that may impose significant adverse effects on ecosystem functioning and services.2. However, we do not have a thorough understanding of why body sizes are commonly declining, and why some organisms show the opposite response. Because ectotherms constitute the vast majority of organism biomass and about 99% of species worldwide, it is particularly important to understand how ectotherms respond to a warming climate.3. This review discusses the underlying physiological mechanisms of changes in ectotherm body size and addresses observed responses within a broad ecological context at different levels of organization, from individuals to communities, particularly in aquatic systems.4. Warming-induced responses in average body size are not only determined by changes in rates of individual growth and development, but also mediated through size-dependent feed-backs at the population level, as well as competitive and predatory interactions within the community. Emergent properties at higher organizational levels have already been observed in both experimental and natural systems.5. Various approaches will be required for enhancing our knowledge about the importance of such processes in natural systems. These include controlled semi-natural experiments and phylogenetic comparisons as well as statistical models of time-series data and theoretical models linking climate effects at the individual, population and community levels.6. Understanding causes of observed changes in organism body sizes and how these depend on the ecological context is essential for improving our predictions and the management of ecosystems in the face of a warming climate.									203	3	0	0	179	1	204			0269-8463	1365-2435		WOS:000329303900016

With the exception of the ndhC operon, the RNA deficiencies observed were specific and restricted to particular segments of the psbB, psbD/C, and ndhH operons, that is, the psbB-psbT, ycf9, and psaC regions. Run-on transcription studies with isolated chloroplasts showed that the failure of these transcripts to accumulate was due to RNA stability and not transcription, Other polycistronic transcription units analyzed were not affected by the mutation, This result indicates that the trans-regulatory factor encoded by the hcf109 gene is not a general RNA stability factor but that it specifically controls the stability of only these distinct transcripts, Because the hcf109 locus was mapped at a distance <0.1 centimorgans from the phytochrome C gene, its molecular characterization by positional cloning is possible.									71	2	0	0	65	0	72			1040-4651	1532-298X		WOS:A1996UZ23500010	8768377

The full-length cDNA of leMnSOD is 1238 bp in length and contains an open reading frame of 681 bp encoding 226 amino acid residues including a putative mitochondrial targeting peptide of 26 amino acids in the N-terminal region. The calculated molecular mass is 24.8 kDa with an estimated isoelectric point of 6.75. leMnSOD signatures from 185 to 192 (DVWEHAYY) and four conserved amino acids (H52, H11, D185, and H192) responsible for binding manganese were observed. Sequence comparison showed that leMnSOD had high levels of identity with MnSOD from Haliotis discus discus, Mizuhopecten yessoensis, and Crassostrea gigas (68%, 66%, and 59%, respectively). RT-PCR analysis revealed the presence of leMnSOD transcripts in all tissues examined. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR assay indicated that treatment with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) significantly increased leMnSOD mRNA expression in an organ-, time-, and dose-dependent manner. The mRNA expression with exposure to PCBs at 0.1 and 10 ppb reached the highest level at 6 h and then recovered slightly from 6 to 48 h in the gill. In contrast, the expression of leMnSOD mRNA showed a different expression pattern related to PCB concentration in the digestive gland. The mRNA expression at 0.1 ppb PCBs increased up to 12 h and then decreased by 48 h, but increased immediately at 10 ppb PCBs. The leMnSOD was overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified. The recombinant leMnSOD showed maximum activity at pH 9.0, and it retained more than 50% of its original activity after incubation for 30 min at 40 degrees C. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Transparent alpha-Fe2O3 mesoporous films were fabricated by template-directed sol-gel chemistry coupled with the dip-coating approach, followed by annealing at various temperatures from 350 degrees C to 750 degrees C in air. alpha-Fe2O3 films were characterized by X-ray diffraction, XPS, FE-SEM and electrochemical measurements. The photoelectrochemical performance of alpha-Fe2O3 photoanodes was characterized and optimized through the deposition of Co-based co-catalysts via different methods (impregnation, electro-deposition and photo-electro-deposition). Interestingly, the resulting hematite films heat-treated at relatively low temperature (500 degrees C), and therefore devoid of any extrinsic dopant, achieve light-driven water oxidation under near-to-neutral (pH = 8) aqueous conditions after decoration with a Co catalyst. The onset potential is 0.75 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), thus corresponding to 450 mV light-induced underpotential, although modest photocurrent density values (40 mu A cm(-2)) are obtained below 1.23 V vs. RHE. These new materials with a very large interfacial area in contact with the electrolyte and allowing for a high loading of water oxidation catalysts open new avenues for the optimization of photo-electrochemical water splitting.									51	1	0	0	3	0	51			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000308826000014	22911106	
J	Behra, R; Genoni, GP; Joseph, AL								Effect of atrazine on growth, photosynthesis, and between-strain variability in Scenedesmus subspicatus (Chlorophyceae)								ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY				37	1			36	41		10.1007/s002449900487				JUL 1999	1999	The magnitude of between-strain differences in the sensitivity of algal species to toxicants is not well known. Yet, informations obtained with a single strain are used for ecotoxicological assessment and for interspecific comparisons. Using 12 strains, we determined whether intraspecific variability occurs in the green alga Scenedesmus subspicatus. We examined growth, photosynthetic activity, and short-term sensitivity thereof to the herbicide atrazine (500 mu g . L-1) as well as how these responses are affected by chronic exposure to low atrazine concentrations (0, 1, 5, and 20 mu g . L-1). Independent of chronic exposure to atrazine, the strains differed in growth rate and photosynthesis rate. Yet the short-term sensitivity to atrazine was affected by the chronic treatments. All but one strain became more tolerant, their short-term sensitivity being inversely related to the applied atrazine concentration and dependent on the duration of exposure. Differences in response to increments in atrazine concentration resulted in differences in rank order of sensitivity of strains. Moreover, between-strain variability was markedly higher in the atrazine treatments than in the controls. These results can be explained by the significant role of genotype versus environment interactions in determining intraspecific differences in adaptive physiological responses of S. subspicatus to chronic exposure to atrazine.									27	0	0	0	25	0	27			0090-4341	1432-0703		WOS:000080623700005	10341040

It was found that (a) titrations of the buffer capacity reveal a characteristic hysteresis effect that is unique for the 33 kDa subunit and is not observed for the other extrinsic proteins, (b) changes of the emission from the fluorescence probe 1,8-ANS are indicative of an increased accessibility of the hydrophobic core of the 33 kDa protein to the dye at lower pH, (c) the near-UV circular dichroism spectrum of the polypeptide is altered owing to a pH decrease from 6.8 to 3.8 and becomes drastically changed at pH 2.8, and (d) the content of secondary structure elements remains virtually constant in the range 3.8 < pH < 6.8, with the following values gathered from far-UV CD spectra: similar to 8% alpha-helix, similar to 33% beta-strand, similar to 15% turns, and similar to 44% random coil. Further acidification down to pH 2.8 gives rise to a decreased alpha-helix and increased beta-strand and random coil content. A theoretical model [Ptitsyn, O., & Finkelstein, A. (1983) Biopolymers 2, 15-22] was used to predict the probability and location of secondary structure elements within the protein sequence. On the basis of these calculations, an extended hydrophobic beta-sheet domain could exist in the center of the protein and an alpha-helix in the C-terminal region. From these data, the 33 kDa protein is inferred to change its tertiary structure in vitro upon acidification of the aqueous environment. Possible implications of these features are discussed.									69	4	2	0	60	0	73			0006-2960			WOS:A1997XB32100011	9174350

Here, we demonstrate a facile approach to fabricate a nanoporous 6H-silicon carbide (6H-SiC) photoanode with a conformal coating of Ni-FeOOH nanorods as a water oxidation cocatalyst. Such a nanoporous photoanode shows significantly enhanced photocurrent density (j(ph)) with a zero-onset potential. A dendritic porous 6H-SiC with densely arranged holes with a size of similar to 40 nm on the surface is fabricated by an anodization method, followed by the hydrothermal deposition of FeOOH nanorods and electrodeposition of NiOOH. Under an illumination of AM1.5G 100 mW/cm(2), the Ni-FeOOH-coated nanoporous 6H-SiC photoanode exhibits an onset potential of 0 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (V-RHE) and a high j(ph) of 0.684 mA/cm(2) at 1 V-RHE, which is 342 times higher than that of the Ni-FeOOH-coated planar 6H-SiC photoanode. Moreover, the nanoporous photoanode shows a maximum applied-bias-photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of 0.58% at a very low bias of 0.36 V-RHE, distinctly outperforming the planar counterpart. The impedance measurements demonstrate that the nanoporous photoanode possesses a significantly reduced charge-transfer resistance, which explains the dramatically enhanced PEC water-splitting performance. The reported approach here can be widely used to fabricate other nanoporous semiconductors for solar energy conversion.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000514256400023	31967447

PCC 7942. Wild-type cells synthesized saturated and mono-unsaturated fatty acids, whereas desA(+) cells, which had been transformed with the desA gene for the Delta 12 acyl-lipid desaturase of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, also synthesized diunsaturated fatty acids. Incubation of wild-type and desA(+) cells with 0.5 M NaCl resulted in the rapid loss of the activities of photosystem I, photosystem II, and the Na+/H+ antiport system both in light and in darkness. However, desA(+) cells were more tolerant to salt stress and osmotic stress than the wild-type cells. The extent of the recovery of the various photosynthetic activities from the effects of 0.5 M NaCl was much greater in desA(+) cells than in wild-type cells. The photosystem II activity of thylakoid membranes from desA(+) cells was more resistant to 0.5 M NaCl than that of membranes from wild-type cells. These results demonstrated that the genetically engineered increase in unsaturation of fatty acids in membrane lipids significantly enhanced the tolerance of the photosynthetic machinery to salt stress. The enhanced tolerance was due both to the increased resistance of the photosynthetic machinery to the salt-induced damage and to the increased ability of desA(+) cells to repair the photosynthetic and Na+/H+ antiport systems.									157	13	0	0	142	1	169			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000168215200032	11299364

The effect of other components in real wastewater on the performance of EAOP was also studied. The anode materials were characterized by cyclic voltammetry, regarding diamond quality, electro-generation of oxidants and NOR oxidation mechanism (direct and/or indirect). The results showed that the anode material influences on the NOR oxidation pathway, due to distinct characteristics of the substrate and the coating. Apparently, low difference in diamond-sp(3)/sp(2)-carbon ratio (Si/BDD100 x Si/BDD2500) does not leads to significant differences in the EAOP. On the other hand, the variation in the sp(3)/sp(2) ratio seems to be higher when Si/BDD2500 and Nb/BDD2500 are compared, which would explain the best current efficiency result for Si substrate. However, the Nb substrate presented a similar current efficiency and a 60% lower energy consumption. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) present in the real wastewater affect the EAOP-Nb/BDD due to HO center dot and persulfate ions scavenged. However, when supporting electrolyte was added to a real wastewater spiked with NOR, the NOR decay reaches similar values found to the synthetic one. Due to the energy saving and mechanical properties, Nb substrate presents some technological advantages in relation to Si, which can facilitate the application to industrial levels.

Nevertheless, the apparent heterogeneous rate constant (k(app), cm s(-1)) for toluene oxidation is larger at the Fe-PbO2 electrode (6.5 +/- 0.06 x 10(-3)) compared to the Bi-PbO2 electrode (2.0 +/- 0.05 x 10(-3)). X-ray absorption near-edge structure data confirm speculation that iron exists in the 3+ oxidation state with octahedral coordination by O atoms in Fe-PbO2 films. The large activity of the Fe-PbO2 electrode is attributed to the benefit of adsorption of aromatic molecules at Fe(III) sites.

J	Muranaka, S; Shimizu, K; Kato, M								A salt-tolerant cultivar of wheat maintains photosynthetic activity by suppressing sodium uptake								PHOTOSYNTHETICA				40	4			509	515		10.1023/A:1024335515473				2002	2002	The effects of NaCl treatment on the photosynthetic machinery in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars differing in salt tolerance were investigated by comparison with iso-osmotic PEG treatment. Both cultivars similarly reduced the photosystem 2 (PS2) energy conversion efficiency (Phi(PS2)) rapidly when plants were exposed to a 100 mM NaCl solution, though no decline was detected under the iso-osmotic PEG treatment. There was no correlation between the reduction of the leaf relative water content (RWC) and the Phi(PS2) in the two iso-osmotic stress treatments. In contrast, a decline of Phi(PS2) along with the increase of the leaf sodium content above 4% dry matter was detected under the NaCl treatment, while no such correlation was detected with other cations. The recovery Of Phi(PS2) after photoinhibitory irradiation was repressed by the NaCl treatment as the increase of the duration of the treatment. Norin 61 subjected to the 100 mM NaCl treatment for 10 d showed a decline of the Phi(PS2) after 1 h moderate irradiation of 400 mumol m(-2) s(-1) PPFD. Thus the concentrated Na+ within a leaf under salinity treatments may decrease the stability of PS2 functions and lead to photochemical inactivation.									33	0	0	0	29	0	33			0300-3604			WOS:000183006200004		
J	Kopf, Sebastian; Ono, Shuhei					Kopf, Sebastian/0000-0002-2044-0201			Sulfur mass-independent fractionation in liquid phase chemistry: UV photolysis of phenacylphenylsulfone as a case study								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				85				160	169		10.1016/j.gca.2012.02.008				MAY 15 2012	2012	The sulfur isotope mass-independent fractionation (S-MIF) represents a distinct geochemical signature commonly observed in Archean rocks. Although S-MIF is generally thought to be exclusive to gas phase chemistry, several studies have suggested that liquid phase or heterogeneous chemistry may also produce S-MIF signatures.This study investigates the potential contribution of the poorly explored mass-independent effects from liquid phase sulfur chemistry. Our investigation focused on laboratory experiments of the UV photolysis of phenacylphenylsulfone as a model system. This system was chosen due to previous measurements of Delta S-33 (not Delta S-36) by a low precision SO2 method indicating the occurrence of anomalous fractionation in S-33.The photolysis of PPS in micellar solution produced MIF of S-33 in residual PPS ranging from depletion by -2.1 parts per thousand to enrichment by 6.4 parts per thousand, with small mass-dependent fractionation of delta S-34 up to 2.1 parts per thousand. While this magnitude of S-33 anomaly is comparable to the range of values observed in Archean rocks, no anomaly in S-36 was detected for the S-32-S-34-S-36 system beyond analytical precision (0.19 parts per thousand). These results confirm the anomalous fractionation to be caused most likely by magnetic isotope effects (MIE), affecting only the nuclear spin possessing S-33 among the four stable isotopes of sulfur. The observed initial depletion of S-33 in the reactant PPS was unexpected and suggests changing contributions of at least two spin-selective processes. The results of this study demonstrate that liquid phase processes, such as the photolysis of certain organic sulfur compounds, can produce anomalous S-33 abundance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This challenge can be addressed thanks to bioinspired chemistry and artificial photosynthesis approaches by designing dye-sensitized photocathodes for hydrogen production, incorporating bioinspired first-row transition metal-based catalysts. The present work r describes the preparation and photoelectrochemical characterization of a NiO photocathode sensitized with a phosphonate-derivatized ruthenium tris-diimine photosensitizer covalently linked to a cobalt diimine dioxime hydrogen-evolving catalyst. Under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation, hydrogen is produced with photocurrent densities reaching 84 +/- 7 mu A.cm(-2), which is among the highest values reported so far for dye-sensitized photocathodes with surface-immobilized catalysts. Thanks to the unique combination of advanced spectroscopy and surface characterization techniques, the fast desorption of the dyad from the NiO electrode and the low yield of electron transfer to the catalyst, resulting in the Co demetallation from the diimine dioxime framework, were identified as the main barriers limiting the performances and the stability of the system. This work therefore paves the way for a more rational design of molecular photocathodes for solar fuel production and represents a further step toward the development of sustainable processes for the production of hydrogen from sunlight and water.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000713052700019	34637266	
C	Hofstra, Albert H.; Christiansen, William D.; Zohar, Pamela B.; Tousignant, Gilles						Steininger, R; Pennell, B		Lithogeochemistry of the Devonian Popovich Formation in the Northern Carlin Trend, Nevada								GREAT BASIN EVOLUTION AND METALLOGENY, VOLS I AND II								63	+						2011	2011	The Devonian Popovich Formation is the major host for Carlin-type gold deposits in the northern Carlin trend, which contains >2800 t (90 Moz) of Au. The chemical and isotopic composition of barren and mineralized intervals of the Popovich Formation were determined in the Screamer sector of the Betze-Post deposit where there are numerous through-going, dike-filled, mineral-controlling structures. The stratigraphy sampled extends through the Wispy, Planar, Soft Sediment Deformation and Upper Mud units. The 332, 5-foot core samples analyzed are from 5 holes separated by as much as 600 m that are outside the zone of metamorphic recrystallization around the Jurassic Goldstrike Stock and below the level of supergene weathering and oxidation.Core from barren intervals has <= 0.001 opt Au, whereas core from mineralized intervals has up to 0.64 opt Au. R-mode factor analysis revealed 4 element associations: CO2-(-Si)-Ca-Mn-Mg-Sr-(-Sb), Al-Nd-La-Ti-K-Sc-Co-Nb-Na-Ce-Ga, Ni-Cu-V-Zn-Cd-Organic C-Mo-Y-Cr, and Au-As-Mn-Fe-S-Li. The first three associations reflect the original carbonate, terrigenous detrital, and organic components of the Popovich Formation. The first association also reflects the occurrence of stibnite in jasperoid. The third association is typical of metalliferous black shales deposited under euxinic conditions and is best developed in the Upper Mud unit and an interval in the Planar unit and upper part of the Wispy unit. The fourth association is indicative of epigenetic Carlin-type Au mineralization and is best developed in the lower part of the Wispy unit. Though the association of Mn and Li with classic Carlin-type elements is unusual, Li is high in argillized rocks with low K2O/Al2O3 and Mn is high in sulfidized rocks with low Fe2O3/Al2O3.Barren core has delta O-18(carbonate) and delta C-13(carbonate) values of 19 to 27 parts per thousand and -2.0 to 1.8 parts per thousand, respectively, which are typical of marine limestone. The lowest delta C-13(carbonate) values are in carbonaceous strata of the Upper Mud unit. Some of the mineralized core is shifted to delta O-18(carbonate) values as low as 8.6 parts per thousand with delta C-13(carbonate) values near 0.5 parts per thousand and is high in Mn. Other core, with Au grades up to 0.39 opt, is not shifted significantly from its original isotopic composition. The negative 16 parts per thousand delta O-18 shift from that of typical marine limestone towards the meteoric water line in some of the mineralized core is indicative of alteration by hot meteoric water. Conversely, the mineralized core without such shifts apparently did not react with hot meteoric water. Likewise, the absence of a negative shift in delta C-13 towards the carbonatite box in all of the mineralized samples precludes a substantial input of magmatic CO2.Barren core has a wide range of delta S-34(sulfide) values, from -16 to +16 parts per thousand, and a mean near 0 parts per thousand. There is a distinct stratigraphic interval of high delta S-34(sulfide) values (>10 parts per thousand) in the Wispy and Planar units that is bound by overlying and underlying strata with low delta S-34(sulfide) values (<5 parts per thousand). The interval with high delta S-34(sulfide) values is indicative of bacterial reduction of a sulfate limited marine reservoir and has high concentrations of organic C and other elements indicative of euxinia. The strata with low delta S-34(sulfide) values are characteristic of the kinetic fractionations associated with bacterial reduction of marine sulfate in an open marine environment. In mineralized core, as Au concentrations, Au/As, As/S, S/Al(2)0(3) and Fe2O3/Al(2)0(3) ratios, and DOS increase, delta(34)Ss(ulfide) values converge from the initial wide range of values towards a value near 0 parts per thousand. This result suggests that ore stage pyrite with delta S-34 near 0 parts per thousand formed by sulfidation of host rock Fe and Fe in a contrasting fluid. While the 0 parts per thousand S may be evidence that Au was introduced by magmatic H2S, the negative correlation between Au, Cu and Te does not support such a model. Considering that ore pyrite in the heart of the Betze-Post deposit has delta S-34 values near 9 parts per thousand, the mean delta S-34(sulfide) value of the Popovich Formation is near 0%, the preferred host in the Wispy unit has low delta S-34(sulfide) values, and Screamer is on the periphery of Betze-Post, it is perhaps more likely that the 0 parts per thousand S in Screamer reflects changes in fluid composition associated with wall rock reactions and lateral flow away from central high grade conduits along the Post fault system (i.e. zoning).While these results permit multiple interpretations they suggest that a minor proportion of the ore formed without meteoric or magmatic fluid inputs or typical Carlin-type processes. Such ore could be evidence of an earlier event (sedex?). Additional work is needed to unambiguously ascertain the age(s) and source(s) of ore fluid components in each ore type. Further chemical and isotopic characterization of ore pyrite in each ore body along the entire Carlin trend may define the loci of fluid upwelling and the directions of fluid movement.					6th Geological Society of Nevada on Great Basin Evolution and Metallogeny6th Geological Society of Nevada on Great Basin Evolution and Metallogeny	MAY 14-22, 2010MAY 14-22, 2010	Soc Econom Geologists; Us Geolog Survey; Utah Geolog Assoc; Arizona Geolog Soc; Barrick Gold Exploration Inc; Haywood Securities; Newmont Mining Corp; Agnico Eagle US Ltd; Goldcorp; ALS Chemex; Boart Longyear; Evolving Gold Corp; Int Royal Corp; KinRoss Gold Corp; Nevada Div Minerals; Newcrest Mining Ltd; GIS Land Serv; Gold Fields Ltd; Hecla Mining Co; Kappes, Cassidy & Assoc; Floren Analyt Serv; Mine Dev Assoc; Allied Nevada Gold Corp; Amec; AuEx Inc; Centerra Gold; Geotemps Inc; Romarco Minerals US Inc; Nevada Mining Assoc; Carrington Consultants; Century Gold; Coeur; Drift Explorat Drilling Inc; Entree Gold Inc; Enviroscientists Inc; Fronteer Dev Inc; Fugro Airborne Surveys; Gold Summit Corp; Golden Predator Royal & Dev Corp; Jipangu Holdings Inc; Klondex Mines; Legend Inc; MGC Resources Inc; Miranda Gold Corp; Queensgate Resources Corp; Royal Gold Inc; Ruen Drilling Inc; Redstar Gold Corp; Rye Patch Gold Corp; Teck; Timberline Drilling; Timberline Resources Corp; US Gold Corp; Victoria Gold Corp; Western Energy Dev Corp; Western LithiumSoc Econom Geologists; Us Geolog Survey; Utah Geolog Assoc; Arizona Geolog Soc; Barrick Gold Exploration Inc; Haywood Securities; Newmont Mining Corp; Agnico Eagle US Ltd; Goldcorp; ALS Chemex; Boart Longyear; Evolving Gold Corp; Int Royal Corp; KinRoss Gold Corp; Nevada Div Minerals; Newcrest Mining Ltd; GIS Land Serv; Gold Fields Ltd; Hecla Mining Co; Kappes, Cassidy & Assoc; Floren Analyt Serv; Mine Dev Assoc; Allied Nevada Gold Corp; Amec; AuEx Inc; Centerra Gold; Geotemps Inc; Romarco Minerals US Inc; Nevada Mining Assoc; Carrington Consultants; Century Gold; Coeur; Drift Explorat Drilling Inc; Entree Gold Inc; Enviroscientists Inc; Fronteer Dev Inc; Fugro Airborne Surveys; Gold Summit Corp; Golden Predator Royal & Dev Corp; Jipangu Holdings Inc; Klondex Mines; Legend Inc; MGC Resources Inc; Miranda Gold Corp; Queensgate Resources Corp; Royal Gold Inc; Ruen Drilling Inc; Redstar Gold Corp; Rye Patch Gold Corp; Teck; Timberline Drilling; Timberline Resources Corp; US Gold Corp; Victoria Gold Corp; Western Energy Dev Corp; Western Lithium	Nevada Bur Mines & Geol, Reno, NVNevada Bur Mines & Geol, Reno, NV	5	0	0	0	0	0	5					978-1-60595-040-2	WOS:000293810500004

We concentrated on studying the period-4 oscillatory (i.e., S-state-related) part of the reduction kinetics, by analyzing the differences between the P680(+) reduction curves, rather than the full kinetics. Earlier observations that P680(+) reduction kinetics have microsecond components were confirmed: the longest observable lifetime whose amplitude showed period-4, oscillations was 30 mu s. We found that solvent isotope exchange left the nanosecond phases of the P680(+) reduction unaltered. However, a significant effect on the oscillatory microsecond components was observed. We propose that, al least in the S-0/S-1 and S-3/S-0 transitions, hydrogen (proton) transfer provides an additional decrease in the free energy of the Y(Z)(+)P680 state with respect to the Y(Z)P680(+) state. This implies that relaxation of the state Y(Z)(+)P680 is required for complete reduction of P680(+) and for efficient water splitting. The kinetics of the P680(+) reduction suggest that it is intraprotein proton/hydrogen rearrangement/transfer, rather than proton release to the bulk, which is occurring on the 1-30 mu s time scale.									104	0	0	0	73	0	104			0006-2960			WOS:000072759300045	9521719

In this work, a novel bismuth titanate/bismuth oxychloride (Bi4Ti3O12/BiOCl) composite consisting of 2D Bi4Ti3O12 nanosheets and OD BiOCl nanoparticles was constructed for the first time. Germinating ultrafine BiOCl nanoparticles on Bi4Ti3O12 nanosheets can provide abundant contact interface and shorten migration distance of photoinduced carriers via two-step synthesis contained molten salt process and facile chemical transformation process. The obtained Bi4Ti3O12/BiOCl 2D/0D composites exhibited enhanced photocatalytic performance for antibiotic tetracycline hydrochloride degradation. The rate constant of optimal Bi4Ti3O12/BiOCl composite was about 4.4 times higher than that of bare Bi4Ti3O12 although Bi4Ti3O12/BiOCl composite appeared lesser photoabsorption. The enhanced photocatalytic performance can be mainly ascribed to matched crystal structure, suitable energy band structure and intimate contact interface between Bi4Ti3O12 nanosheets and ultrafine BiOCl nanoparticles as well as unique 2D/0D composite structure. Besides, a probable degradation mechanism on the basis of active species trapping experiments, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, photocurrent responses and energy band structures was proposed. This work may be stretched to other 2D/0D composite photocatalysts construction, which is inspiring for antibiotic residue treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Unlike other routes in which metal particle decoration is achieved externally, in this study, photoresponsive one-dimensional WO3-Bi2O3 composite nanorods were decorated with Bi particles by using the internal precipitation method. Structural analysis revealed that the Bi-metal-particle-functionalized WO3-Bi2O3 composite nanorods with particle size ranging from 5 to 10 nm were formed through hydrogen gas annealing at an optimal annealing temperature of 350 degrees C. Compared with the pristine WO3 nanorod template, the Bi-WO3-Bi2O3 composite nanorods exhibited higher photoresponsive performance, substantial photogenerated charge transfer ability, and efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. The study results indicated that the Bi-WO3-Bi2O3 composite nanorods had superior decontamination ability and excellent stability toward RhB dye as compared with pristine WO3. Moreover, the photogenerated charge separation and migration efficiencies of the WO3-Bi2O3 nanorods could be tuned through appropriate reduction of the surface oxide layer; this is a promising approach to designing WO3-Bi2O3 nanorods with high photoactive performance.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000648721100001	33887714

Herein, we developed an efficient electrochemical system to remove total nitrogen and dissolved organic compound (DOC) simultaneously mediated by chlorine radical (Cl center dot), which is generated by activation of chloride ion existing in ROC on an inexpensive, three-dimensional Co3O4 nanowires. Results showed that the total nitrogen and total organic carbon removal were 98.2% and 56.9% in 60 min for synthetic ROC with 56 mg/L of NH3-N and 20 mg/L of DOC. The utilization of Co3O4 nanowires enhanced NH3-N degradation by 2.58 times compared with Co3O4 nanoplates, which were 1.69 and 17.5 times these of RuO2 and Pt. We found that structural Co3+/Co2+ acts as cyclic catalysis to produce Cl center dot via single-electron transfer, which convert NH3-N to N-2 and lead to faster DOC degradation. This architecture provides abundant catalytic sites and sufficient accessibility of reactants. Small amount of nitrate generated by oxidation of NH3-N was further reduced to N-2 on Pd-Cu/NF cathode. These findings provide new insights for utilization of waste Cl and development of novel electrochemical system for ROC disposal.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000734395100005	34801298

Sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium studies were performed. These experiments yielded values for s(20,w)(0) of 2.26 S with a diffusion constant, D, of 7.7 x 10(-7) cm(2) s(-1). This s value is significantly lower than the apparent s value of 2.6 S previously reported [Miyao, M., and Murata, N. (1989) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 977, 315-321]. The molecular mass of the protein, 26.531 kDa, was verified by MALDI mass spectrometry. The diffusion coefficient was also determined by dynamic light scattering. The z-weighted average of D was 6.8 x 10(-7) cm(2) s(-1). This result was somewhat lower than that observed by analytical ultracentrifugation due to the presence of slowly diffusing components in the sample. A two-component exponential fit of the dynamic light scattering data, however, gave D = 7.52 x 10(-7) cm(2) s(-1) for the major component of the sample, which is in excellent agreement with the value determined by analytical ultracentrifugation. The value of s*, the apparent sedimentation coefficient, was found to depend on the concentration of the protein and varied about 4% per milligram of protein. This is a feature of proteins which are asymmetric in solution. This asymmetry was examined using both the v-bar and Teller methods. Both methods indicated a significant degree of asymmetry for the manganese-stabilizing protein. Our findings indicate that the prolate ellipsoid model for the manganese-stabilizing protein is elongated in solution, with approximate dimensions of about 12.6 nm x 3.0 nm, yielding an axial ratio of 4.2.									34	0	0	0	29	0	34			0006-2960			WOS:000076367900013	9753441

Moreover, the anisotropic carrier mobility is up to 2486.93 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) for SnSe and 2181.96 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) for SnS2. By applying low tensile strain, the band edge of SnX can be lowered to meet the criteria for water splitting. Meanwhile, the photo-generated exciton binding energies are pretty low, which indicates that the electron-hole can separate efficiently, and may lead to remarkable activity for photocatalysis. Promisingly, it is possible to stack SnS and SnS2 to fabricate a vertical heterostructure (VHT). According to band analysis, we found that the global valence and conduction bands are from SnX and SnX2, respectively. Due to the weak interaction between the two monolayers, the optical gaps can slightly decrease in the two monolayers compared to those in the corresponding isolated ones. Therefore, the VHT can meet the two primary conditions of a photocatalyst for water splitting to generate H-2 in SnX and O-2 in SnX2. The strong electronegativity difference between the two layers develops an effective potential gradient between the SnS and SnS2 layers, which evokes an effective electric field between them. Thus, it is of benefit for quick charge separation and inter-layer charge transfer. High efficiency of light harvesting can be realized, and improved photocatalytic efficiency.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000464580600031	30899930

When exposed to high temperature (HT) and high iradiance (HI), thylakoids showed large variations in the photosynthetic electron transport activities and thylakoid membrane proteins. A drastic reduction in the rate of whole electron transport chain (H2O --> MV) was envisaged in control thylakoids when exposed to HT and HI. Such reduction was mainly due to the loss of photosystem 2, PS2 (H2O --> DCBQ) activity. The thylakoids isolated from seedlings grown in the presence of DCMU showed greater resistance to HT and HI treatment. The artificial exogenous electron donors MnCl2, DPC, and NH2OH failed to restore the HI induced loss of PS2 activity in both control and DCMU thylakoids. In contrast, addition of DPC and NH2OH significantly restored the HT induced loss of PS2 activity in control thylakoids and partially in DCMU thylakoids. Similar results were obtained when F-v/F-m was evaluated by chlorophyll fluorescence measurements. The marked loss of PS2 activity in control thylakoids was evidently due to the loss of 33, 23, and 17 kDa extrinsic polypeptides and 28-25 kDa LHCP polypeptides.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0300-3604			WOS:000173545700011		
J	Henry, RP; Gilmour, KM; Wood, CM; Perry, SF				Wood, Chris M/C-3021-2009	Wood, Chris M/0000-0002-9542-2219			Extracellular carbonic anhydrase activity and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in the circulatory system of fish								PHYSIOLOGICAL ZOOLOGY				70	6			650	659		10.1086/515878				NOV-DEC 1997	1997	Carbonic anhydrase activity in the extracellular fluid of lower vertebrates is considered to be minimal, either because of the absence of carbonic anhydrase or because of the presence of naturally occurring inhibitors. The presence of carbonic anhydrase activity and circulating inhibitors was measured in plasma and subcellular fractions of gill tissue in elasmobranchs and teleosts. Plasma carbonic anhydrase activity was confirmed in the former but in extremely low amounts, especially compared with activity in red cells. The activity was correlated with plasma iron concentration and red cell hemolysis, which suggests that it is a by-product of endogenous hemolysis during red cell turnover. A subcellular fraction of dogfish gills rich in microsomes contained significantly higher carbonic anhydrase activity than previously found in teleosts, making elasmobranchs the only aquatic lower vertebrates to possess putative basolateral membrane-associated carbonic anhydrase in the gill vasculature. It is suggested that branchial membrane-associated carbonic anhydrase is correlated more with a pH and/or CO2-sensitive ventilatory drive than with the maintenance of resting CO2 excretion. The occurrence and effectiveness of plasma carbonic anhydrase inhibitors were highly species-specific with the salmonids having the most potent inhibitor. Cross-reactivity of inhibitor to red cell carbonic anhydrase appeared to be related to phylogenetic proximity. Selection for the presence of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in fish plasma appears to be the result of multiple physiological pressures, including preservation of red cell intracellular pH, ventilatory control, and red cell fragility.									53	0	0	0	49	0	54			0031-935X			WOS:A1997YF04000007	9361139

Herein, a heterostructure engineering is applied to construct the high performance Co, N-containing carbon-based multifunctional electrocatalysts with the feature of isotype (i.e. n-n type Co2N0.67-BHPC) and anisotype (i.e. p-n type Co-2 O-3-BHPC) heterojunctions for ORR, OER and HER. The n-n type Co2N0.67-BHPC, in which biomass (e.g. mushroom)-derived hierarchical porous carbon (BHPC) incorporated with nonstoichiometric active species Co2N0.67, is fabricated by using an in situ protective strategy of macrocyclic central Co-N-4 from Co-TPP (5,10,15,20-tetrakis(phenyl) porphyrinato cobalt) precursor through the intermolecular pi-pi interactions between CoTPP and its metal-free analogue H2TPP. Meanwhile, an unprotected strategy of macrocyclic central Co-N-4 from CoTPP can afford the anisotype Co2O3-BHPC p-n heterojunction. The as-prepared n-n type Co2N0.67-BHPC heterojunction exhibited a higher density of Co-based active sites with outstanding stability and more efficient charge transfer at the isotype heterojunction interface in comparison with p-n type Co2O3 -BHPC heterojunction. Consequently, for ORR, Co2N0.67-BHPC exhibits the more positive onset and half-wave potentials of 0.93 and 0.86 V vs. RHE, respectively, superior to those of the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C and most of Co-based catalysts reported so far. To drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), Co2N0.67-BHPC also shows the lower overpotentials of 0.34 and 0.21 V vs. RHE for OER and HER, respectively. Furthermore, the Zn-air battery equipped with Co2N0.67-BHPC displays higher maximum power density (109 mW cm(-2)) and charge-discharge cycle stability. Interestingly, the anisotype heterojunction Co2O3-BHPC as trifunctional electrocatalyst reveals evidently photoelectrochemical enhancement compared with the photostable Co2N0.67-BHPC. That is to say, isotype heterojunction material (n-n type Co2N0.67-BHPC) is equipped with better electrocatalytic performance than anisotype one (p-n type Co2O3-BHPC), but the opposite is true in photoelectrochemical catalysis. Meanwhile, the possible mechanism is proposed based on the energy band structures of the Co2N0.67-BHPC and Co2O3-BHPC and the cocatalyst effects. The present work provides much more possibilities to tune the electrocatalytic and photoelectrochemical properties of catalysts through a facile combination of heterostructure engineering protocol and macrocyclic central metal protective strategy.

The as-prepared pristine and nanocomposite samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), UV-VIS diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface analysis, and Vibrational sample magnetometer (VSM) characterization techniques. The result reveals that the weight percent of NiFe2O4 have considerable effect on the optical property and photocatalytic activity of the nanocomposites. The CGN-25% nanocomposite shows the best photocatalytic activity and its activity is about 15, 7 and 6 folds higher than those of NiFe2O4, g-C3N4, and CN-25% respectively on the degradation of methyl orange (MO). This enhancement could be attributed to the synergistic effect between g-C3N4, graphene and NiFe2O4, which could accelerate photogenerated electron-hole separation and prolong the life of the photoinduced carriers to enhance their activity. The CGN-25% was recycled using magnet without significant loss and shows almost the same photocatalytic performance for six runs. Moreover, a possible photocatalytic mechanism was proposed. This could provide new insights to develop highly efficient and stable g-C3N4 and graphene based magnetic photocatalysts.									25	3	0	0	4	0	27			1010-6030			WOS:000481566700059

Anionic ligand associated with the complexes varies as Cl- CH3COO-, SCN- and ClO4-. X-ray structure of one of the complexes [Mn(GBOA)(2)(H2O)(2)]Cl-2 center dot 4H(2)O was solved and shows that the Mn(II) ion is hexacoordinate. Two equatorial positions are occupied by benzimidazole imine nitrogen atoms while the other two sites are occupied by amide carbonyl oxygens. The imine nitrogen and carbonyl oxygens are bound to Mn(II) by different arms of the two ligands while axial sites are occupied by two water molecules. Two Cl- anions are outside the coordination sphere and form an extensive 3D H-bonded network. Axially distorted octahedral geometry is confirmed for all the four complexes by low temperature EPR spectroscopy. Distortion parameter D was found to be similar for [Mn(GBOA)(2)(H2O)(2)]Cl-2 center dot 4H(2)O and [Mn(GBOA)(2)(H2O)(2)]center dot(CH3COO)(2)center dot H2O. Cyclic voltammograms have been obtained for all the four complexes and E-1/2 values are dependant on the anionic ligand being in the coordination sphere or outside. [Mn(GBOA)(2)(H2O)(2)]Cl-2 center dot 4H(2)O and [Mn(GBOA)(2)(H2O)(2)]center dot(CH3COO)(2)center dot H2O carry out the selective oxidation of N-benzyldimethylamine, and 1-methyl-pyrollidine to their respective carbonyl products with catalytic efficiency of 35-50%.

The easily tunable optoelectronic properties of OSCs also make it promising building blocks and thereby provide more possibilities in photocatalytic applications. So far, organic nanostructures have gained great impetus and found wide applications in photocatalytic organic synthesis, remediation of water and air, as well as water splitting into hydrogen. But they still suffer from low charge separation and sunlight absorption efficiencies. Accordingly, many strategies have been explored to address these issues, and one of the most effective solutions is to develop nano-heterostructures. To give an impulse for the developments of this field, this review attempts to make a systematic introduction on the recent progress over the rational design and fabrication of organic nano-heterostructured photocatalysts, including the types of organic semiconductor/semiconductor (OSC/SC), organic semiconductor/metal (OSC/M), organic semiconductor/carbon (OSC/C), and OSC-based multinary nano-heterostructures. The emphasis is placed on the structure/property relationships, and their photocatalytic purposes in environmental and energy fields. At last, future challenges and perspectives for the ongoing development of OSC materials and their use in high-quality optoelectronic devices are also covered.

The two g = 4.1 signals arise from states which have quite different stability in terms of temperature. In the present work we have compared these two signals in order to test if they originate from the same or from different chemical origins. The microwave power saturation properties of the two signals measured at 4.2 K were found to be virtually identical, Their temperature dependencies measured at non-saturating powers were also identical. The presence of Curie law behavior for the g4(S) and g4(IR) signals indicates that the states responsible for both signals are ground states. The orientation dependence, anisotropy and resolved hyperfine structure of the two g4 signals were also found to be virtually indistinguishable. We have been unable to confirm the behavior reported earlier indicating that the g4(S) signal is an excited state, nor were we able to confirm the presence of signal from a higher excited state in samples containing the g4(S), nor a radical signal in samples containing the g4(IR). These findings are best interpreted assuming that the two signals have a common origin i.e. a spin 5/2 ground state arising from a magnetically coupled Mn-cluster of 4 Mn ions.

Mn2+ binds to the apo-WOC-PSII protein in the absence of calcium at a high-affinity site. By using a hydrophobic chelator to remove Mn2+ and Ca2+ from the WOC and nonspecific Fe3+, a new EPR signal becomes visible upon binding of Mn2+ to this site, characterized by six-line Mn-55 hyperfine structure (Delta H-pp = 96 +/- 1 G) and effective g = 8.3. These features indicate a high-spin electronic ground state (S = 5/2) for Mn2+ and a strong ligand field with large anisotropy, This signal is eliminated if excess Ca2+ or Mg2+ is present. A second Mn2+ EPR signal forms in place of this signal upon addition of Ca2+ in the dark. The yield of this Ca-induced Mn signal is optimum at a ratio of 2 Mn/PSII, and saturates with increasing [Ca2+] greater than or equal to 8 mM, exhibiting a calcium dissociation constant of K-D = 1.4 mM. The EPR signal of the Ca-induced Mn center at 25 K is asymmetric with major g value of approximate to 2.05 (Delta H-pp = 380 G) and a shoulder near g approximate to 3.1. It also exhibits resolved Mn-55 hyperfine splitting with separation Delta H-pp = 42-45 G. These spectral features are diagnostic of a variety of weakly interacting Mn-2(II,II) pairs with electronic spins that are magnetic dipolar coupled in the range of intermanganese separations 4.1 +/- 0.4 Angstrom, and commonly associated with one or two carboxylate bridges. The calcium requirement for induction of the Mn-2(II,II) signal matches the value observed for steady-state O-2 evolution (Michaelis constant, K-M approximate to 1.4 mM), and for light-induced assembly of the WOC by photoactivation. The Ca-induced Mn-2(II,II) center is a more efficient electron donor to the photooxidized tyrosine radical, Tyr(Z)(+), than is the mononuclear Mn center present in the absence of Ca2+. The Ca-induced Mn-2(II,II) signal serves as a precursor for photoactivation of the functional WOC and is abolished by the presence of Mg2+. Formation of the Mn-2(II,II) EPR signal by addition of Ca2+ correlates with reduction of flash-induced catalase activity, indicating that calcium modulates the accessibility or reactivity of the Mn-2(II,II) core with H2O2. We propose that calcium organizes the binding site for Mn ions in the apo-WOC protein and may even interact directly with the Mn-2(II,II) pair via solvent or protein-derived bridging ligands.									46	3	0	0	23	0	46			0006-2960			WOS:A1997XX78400007	9298953

Ca-45(2+) binding studies and dot blot analyses of CP29 demonstrate that CP29 is a Ca2+-binding protein. The primary sequence of CP29 does not exhibit an obvious Ca2+-binding site therefore we have used Yb3+ replacement to analyze this site. Near-infrared Yb3+ vibronic side band fluorescence spectroscopy (Roselli, C., Boussac, A. and Mattioli, T. A. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 91, 12897-12901) of Yb3+-reconstituted CP29 indicated a single population of Yb3+-binding sites rich in carboxylic acids, characteristic of Ca2+-binding sites. A structural model of CP29 presents two purported extra-membranar loops which are relatively rich in carboxylic acids, one on the stromae side and one on the lumenal side. The loop on the lumenal side is adjacent to glutamic acid 166 in helix C of CP29, which is known to be the binding site for dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (Pesaresi, P., Sandona, D., Giuffra, E., and Bassi, R. (1997) FEBS Lett. 402, 151-156). Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide binding prevented Ca2+ binding, therefore we propose that the Ca2+ in CP29 is bound in the domain including the lumenal loop between helices B and C.									24	0	1	0	23	0	25			0021-9258			WOS:000086762300059	10777575

However, the problem of catalyst immobilization is hindering the popularization of powder catalysts in practical application. In this paper, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was embedded on the surface of the sheath-core composite polyester fibers (LMPET) by a hot-melt adhesive process to construct a robust three-dimensional nonwoven catalytic platform (g-C3N4@LMPET). The results of field-emission scanning electron microscopy and digital microscopy showed that the scattered fibers were assembled in an irregular interpenetrating network system and the presence of the semi-coated inlaid g-C3N4 on LMPET structure was confirmed. This system showed a favorable photocatalytic activity towards the decomposition of antibiotics, such as sulfadiazine (SDZ) and sulfamerazine. Additionally, electron paramagnetic resonance spectra and ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-definition mass spectrometry analysis indicated that % O-2-is the predominant radical involved in the degradation of antibiotics in neutral solutions, avoiding the corrosion of polyester carriers during the pollutant elimination process. The superior performance of g-C3N4@ LMPET, in terms of tensile strength and regenerability, was confirmed through mechanical tests and cycling experiments. Furthermore, the consequence of SDZ photocatalytic degradation in different water media exhibited an intriguing practical application performance of g-C3N4@ LMPET. This work offers distinctive insight on the immobilization and largescale application of powder materials.									26	1	0	0	9	0	26			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000430700500009

To determine how reducing reagents can have such opposing effects in these preparations, we studied how redox potentials affect photoactivation in the range from 0 mV to +500 mV. In chloroplasts, a modest yield of photoactivation was obtained in the redox potential range of +100 and +330 mV at pH 7.5. The yield of photoactivation decreased at redox potentials above +330 mV, and drastically increased below potentials of +100 mV. Nernst plots of the data show that an n = 1 redox component with an E-m7.5 Of +374 mV, as well as an n = 2 redox component with an E-m7.5 Of +61 mV, is involved in photoactivation of chloroplasts isolated from dark-grown spruce seedlings. In the case of PSII membranes, photoactivation decreased sharply on either side of +335 mV at pH 5.5, The n = 1 redox components with E-m5.5 Of +375 and +319 mV may be involved, both of which showed pH dependences of -60 mV/pH unit. DCMU abolished photoactivation in chloroplasts, but did not affect the dependence of photoactivation on oxidation-reduction potentials in PSTI membranes. The component with an E-m5.5 of +319 mV involved in photoactivation of PSII membranes was also observed in the dependence of Mn solubilization on oxidation-reduction potentials with PSII membranes lacking extrinsic proteins, suggesting that the reduction of Mn with higher valences to Mn(II) by exogenous reducing reagents reversibly occurs in the intermediates or an active center during photoactivation in PSII membranes. Involvement of such redox components in photoactivation in chloroplasts and PSII membranes is discussed.									12	1	1	0	9	0	13			0006-2960			WOS:A1997XA27400029	9166789

This protein, designated PSII-S in accordance with the assignment of the name psbS to its gene, has been isolated by nonionic detergents and preparative isoelectric focusing in this study. The isolated PSII-S protein was shown to bind 5 chlorophyll molecules (a and b) per protein unit and also several different kinds of carotenoids. The room temperature absorption spectrum of the Q(y) transition of the chlorophylls bound to the isolated protein is characterized by a broad band with a maximum at 671 nm. The 77 K fluorescence spectrum exhibits a peak at 672 nm. A single photon counting technique was applied to resolve the room temperature decay kinetics of the first excited singlet states in the chlorophyll ensemble of the PSII-S protein. The data can be satisfactorily described by triexponential kinetics with lifetimes of tau(1) = 1.8 ns, tau(2) = 4.4 ns, and tau(3) = 6.1 ns and normalized amplitudes of 0.09, 0.60, and 0.31, respectively. Circular dichroism spectra suggest that, in contrast to LHCII, virtually no pigment coupling exists in the PSII-S protein. Two copies of the PSII-S protein were found per PSII in spinach thylakoids. It displays an unusually extreme lateral heterogeneity, since the PSII beta centers located in the stroma exposed thylakoid regions contained only residual amounts of the PSII-S protein. Although the protein is unambiguously shown to bind pigments, it has several features distinct from previously described chlorophyll binding proteins. Therefore, it seems very likely that the PSII-S protein is involved in additional and/or alternative functions to normal light-harvesting.									116	1	0	0	106	0	118			0006-2960			WOS:A1995RV05000019	7669771

Eukaryotes that lack mitochondria also lack PDH, using instead the O-2-sensitive enzyme pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFO), which is localized either in the cytosol or in hydrogenosomes. The facultatively anaerobic mitochondria of the photosynthetic protist Euglena gracilis constitute a hitherto unique exception in that these mitochondria oxidize pyruvate with the O-2-sensitive enzyme pyruvate : NADP(+) oxidoreductase (PNO). Cloning and analysis of Euglena PNO revealed that the cDNA encodes a mitochondrial transit peptide followed by an N-terminal PFO domain that is fused to a C-terminal NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) domain. Two independent 5.8-kb full-size cDNAs for Euglena mitochondrial PNO were isolated; the gene was expressed in cultures supplied with 2% CO2 in air and with 2% CO2 in N-2. The apicomplexan Cryptosporidium parvum was also shown to encode and express the same PFO-CPR fusion, except that, unlike E. gracilis, no mitochondrial transit peptide for C. parvum PNO was found. Recombination-derived remnants of PNO are conserved in the genomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe as proteins involved in sulfite reduction. Notably, Trypanosoma brucei was found to encode homologs of both PFO and all four PDH subunits. Gene organization and phylogeny revealed that eukaryotic nuclear genes for mitochondrial, hydrogenosomal, and cytosolic PFO trace to a single eubacterial acquisition. These findings suggest a common ancestry of PFO in amitochondriate protists with Euglena mitochondrial PNO and Cryptosporidium PNO. They are also consistent with the view that eukaryotic PFO domains are biochemical relies inherited from a facultatively anaerobic, eubacterial ancestor of mitochondria and hydrogenosomes.									93	0	0	0	94	0	99			0737-4038	1537-1719		WOS:000168427400003	11319255

S. Hwang et H. G. Choi ()] an ancient member of the Rhodphyta, was cloned by electronic cloning, rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), and reverse transcription PCR. The nucleotide sequence of PyAOX consists of 1,650 bp, including a 5' untranslated region (UTR) of 170 bp, a 3' UTR of 148 bp, and an open reading frame (ORF) of 1,332 bp that can be translated into a 443-amino-acid residue with a molecular mass of 47.33 kDa and a putative isoelectric point (pI) of 9.71. The putative amino acids had 50%61% identity with AOX genes in Eukaryota and higher plants and had AOX-like characteristics. The expression of PyAOX mRNA in different stages of the life cycle, conchospores, filamentous thalli (conchocelis stage), and leafy thalli, was detected by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). The highest level of expression, which was observed in filamentous thalli, was three times higher than that observed in leafy thalli. The next highest level, which was observed in the conchospores, was twice as high as that observed in leafy thalli. We showed that an alternative respiration pathway existed in P. yezoensis with a noninvasive microsensing system. The contribution of the alternative pathway to total respiration in filamentous thalli was greater than that in leafy thalli. This result was consistent with the level of AOX gene expression observed in different stages of the life cycle.									2	1	0	0	2	0	3			0022-3646	1529-8817		WOS:000304810200017	27011081

These electrodes were used in electrochemical ozone production (EOP) carried out during the electrolysis of electrolyte-free water in order to obtain an environmentally friendly technology for the ldquoin siturdquo water treatment. SEM images of electrodes prepared using different electrodeposition conditions showed the formation of well-defined crystalline grains, which uniformly covered the metallic wires of the support. X-ray analysis revealed that the formation of a beta-PbO2 phase is more pronounced than the alpha-PbO2 phase. A maximum EOP current efficiency of 10%, obtained at j = 1.5 A cm-2, corresponding to a rate for the ozone generation of 1.58 g h-1 and a specific electric energy consumption of 0.250 kW h g-1, was attained for the OFM-Fe-PbO2 electrode formed using the electrodeposition bath containing 1.0 mM Fe3+. The performance of the electrochemical reactor was evaluated during long-term galvanostatic electrolysis (t = 60 days, j = 1.0 A cm-2 and 24 degC), during which it was verified that the reactor voltage (U) and EOP current efficiency (PhiEOP) were both stable. The robustness of the SPE filter-press electrochemical reactor allied to a moderate EOP current efficiency indicated that the OFM-Fe-PbO2 electrode (1.0 mM Fe3+) is promising for in situ ozone production from the electrolysis of electrolyte-free water.

Sequence analysis of the cloned M. perniciosa cDNA revealed an open reading frame (ORF) coding for a 176 amino acid polypeptide with the typical metal-binding motifs of a SOD2 gene, named MpSOD2. Phylogenetic comparison with known manganese superoxide dismutases (MnSODs) located the protein of M. perniciosa (MpSod2p) in a clade with the basidiomycete fungi Coprinopsis cinerea and Laccaria bicolor. Haploid wild-type yeast transformants containing a single copy of MpSOD2 showed increased resistance phenotypes against oxidative stress-inducing hydrogen peroxide and paraquat, but had unaltered phenotype against ultraviolet-C (UVC) radiation. The same transformants exhibited high sensitivity against treatment with the pro-mutagen diethylnitrosamine (DEN) that requires oxidation to become an active mutagen/carcinogen. Absence of MpSOD2 in the yeast sod2 Delta mutant led to DEN hyper-resistance while introduction of a single copy of this gene restored the yeast wild-type phenotype. The haploid yeast wild-type transformant containing two SOD2 gene copies, one from M. perniciosa and one from its own, exhibited DEN super-sensitivity. This transformant also showed enhanced growth at 37 degrees C on the non-fermentable carbon source lactate, indicating functional expression of MpSod2p. The pro-mutagen dihydroethidium (DHE)-based fluorescence assay monitored basal level of yeast cell oxidative stress. Compared to the wild type, the yeast sod2 Delta mutant had a much higher level of intrinsic oxidative stress, which was reduced to wild type (WT) level by introduction of one copy of the MpSOD2 gene. Taken together our data indicates functional expression of MpSod2 protein in the yeast S. cerevisiae.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2				1422-0067		WOS:000357492800030	26039235

Hydrogen generation via proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is one technology that offers a pathway to store large amounts of electricity in the form of hydrogen. The challenges to widespread adoption of PEM water electrolyzers lie in their high capital and operating costs which both need to be reduced through R&D. An evaluation of reported PEMWE performance data in the literature reveals that there are excessive variations of in situ performance results that make it difficult to draw conclusions on the pathway forward to performance optimization and future R&D directions. To enable the meaningful comparison of in situ performance evaluation across laboratories there is an obvious need for standardization of materials and testing protocols. Herein, we address this need by reporting the results of a round robin test effort conducted at the laboratories of five contributors to the IEA Electrolysis Annex 30. For this effort a method and equipment framework were first developed and then verified with respect to its feasibility for measuring water electrolysis performance accurately across the various laboratories. The effort utilized identical sets of test articles, materials, and test cells, and employed a set of shared test protocols. It further defined a minimum skeleton of requirements for the test station equipment. The maximum observed deviation between laboratories at 1 A cm(-2) at cell temperatures of 60 degrees C and 80 degrees C was 27 and 20 mV, respectively. The deviation of the results from laboratory to laboratory was 2-3 times higher than the lowest deviation observed at one single lab and test station. However, the highest deviations observed were one-tenth of those extracted by a literature survey on similar material sets. The work endorses the urgent need to identify one or more reference sets of materials in addition to the method and equipment framework introduced here, to enable accurate comparison of results across the entire community. The results further imply that cell temperature control appears to be the most significant source of deviation between results, and that care must be taken with respect to break-in conditions and cell electrical connections for meaningful performance data.

Results were compared to those obtained in similar experiments done on PSII isolated from plants. The flash-dependent changes in amplitude of the EPR multiline signals were virtually identical in all samples. In agreement with earlier work [Messinger, J., Nugent, J, H. A., and Evans, M. C. W. (1997) Biochemistry, 36, 11055-11060; Ahrling, K. A., Peterson, S., and Styring, S, (1997) Biochemistry 36, 13148-13152], detection of an EPR multiline signal from the So state in PSII from plants was only possible with methanol present. In PSII from S. elongatus, it is shown that the S-0 state exhibits an EPR multiline signal in the absence of methanol (however, ethanol was present as a solvent for the artificial electron acceptor). The hyperfine lines are better resolved when methanol is present. The S-0 multiline signals detected in plant PSII and in S, elongatus were similar but not identical. Unlike the situation seen in plant PSII, the S-2 state in S. elongatus is not affected by the addition of methanol in that (i) the S-2 multiline EPR signal is not modified by methanol and (ii) the spin state of the S-2 state is affected by infrared light when methanol is present. It is also shown that the magnetic relaxation properties of an oxidized low-spin heme, attributed to cytochrome c(550), vary with the S states. This heme then is in the magnetic environment of the Mn-4 cluster.									35	0	0	0	22	0	35			0006-2960			WOS:000082834800010	10508397

Here, a novel TiO2/Cu2O/Al/Al2O3 photoelectrode is manufactured by depositing plasmonic nanoparticles of the non-noble metal Al on the surface of a TiO2/Cu2O core/shell heterojunction for the first time. The Al nanoparticles, which exhibit a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect and are substantially less expensive than noble metals such as Au and Ag, generate hot electron-hole pairs and amplify the electromagnetic field at the interface under illumination. The as-prepared TiO2/Cu2O/Al/Al2O3 photoelectrodes have an extended absorption range and enhanced carrier separation and transfer. Their photocurrent density of 4.52 mA.cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE represents an 1.84-fold improvement over that of TiO2/Cu2O. Specifically, the ultrathin Al2O3 passivation layer spontaneously generated on the surface of Al in air could act as a protective layer to significantly increase its stability. In this work, the synergistic effect of the heterojunctions and the SPR effect of the non-noble metal Al significantly improve the photoelectrode performance, providing a novel concept for the design of electrodes with good properties and high practicability.

Here, we cloned and characterized two thioredoxins, named SlTrx1 and SlTrx2, from the common cutworm Spodoptera litura. SlTrx1 and SlTrx2, respectively, consist of 988 and 606 bp full-length cDNA with 318 and 447 bp open reading frames encoding 106 and 149 amino acid residues. Furthermore, the N-terminal region of SlTrx2 contains a predicted mitochondrial localization signal (33 amino acids). A phylogenetic relationship analysis revealed that SlTrx1 is in the cytosolic thioredoxin Trx1 cluster, whereas SlTrx2 is in the mitochondrial thioredoxin Trx2 cluster. Recombinant SlTrx1 (14 kDa) and SlTrx2 (16 kDa), expressed in baculovirus-infected insect Sf9 cells, demonstrated insulin disulfide reductase activity at the same optimum temperature and pH value of 35 degrees C and 7.0, respectively, in vitro. During S. litura development, we found that SlTrx1 and SlTrx2 had similar transcript expression patterns and were constitutively expressed in the epidermis, fat body, and midgut, with the highest expression occurring in the sixth-instar larval stage in the epidermis and midgut In addition, both SlTrx1 and SlTrx2 mRNA were up-regulated in S. litura after injection with H2O2, cumene hydroperoxide, indoxacarb, and metaflumizone. These results suggest that SlTrx1 and SlTrx2 function as potent antioxidant enzymes, and provide a molecular basis for the roles SlTrx1 and SlTrx2 during development and the oxidative stress response of S. litura.

However, the function of Smad3 in crustaceans such as shrimp, is still poorly understood and needs to be further explored. We characterized Litopenaeus vannamei Smad3 (LvSmad3) and its biological functions were investigated in response low temperature stress. Full-length LvSmad3 cDNA was 2341bp and contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 1326 bp that encoded a 441 amino acid long protein, with a predicted molecular mass of 48.35 kDa. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that LvSmad3 has a high degree of similarity with other known species. LvSmad3 mRNA was detected in all the tested tissues and highest transcription occurred mostly in gills. Further research showed that suppressing the expression of Smad3 could reduce ROS production, DNA damage and the apoptosis rate in shrimp hemocyte under low temperature compared with the dsGFP group. Thus, we speculated that Smad3 could promote the apoptosis of hemocytes. We confirmed that Smad3 could inhibit apoptosis in the hepatopancreas by suppressing the expression of proapoptotic genes. Taken together, the silencing of Smad3 can reduce ROS production induced by low temperature stress, weaken the damage to hemocytes and the hepatopancreas by inhibit the apoptosis.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0145-305X	1879-0089		WOS:000692108000007	34303729	
J	SANAKIS, Y; PETROULEAS, V; DINER, BA								CYANIDE BINDING AT THE NONHEME FE2+ OF THE IRON-QUINONE COMPLEX OF PHOTOSYSTEM-II - AT HIGH-CONCENTRATIONS, CYANIDE CONVERTS THE FE2+ FROM HIGH (S=2) TO LOW (S=0) SPIN								BIOCHEMISTRY				33	33			9922	9928		10.1021/bi00199a014				AUG 23 1994	1994	The primary electron acceptor complex of photosystem II, Q(A)Fe(2+), can bind a number of small molecules at the iron site, including cyanide [Koulougliotis, D., Kostopoulos, T., Petrouleas, V., & Diner, B. A. (1993) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1141, 275-282)]. In the presence of NaCN (30-300 mM) at pH 6.5, the reduced state, Q(A)-Fe2+, produced either by illumination at less than or equal to 200 K or by reduction in the dark with sodium dithionite, is characterized by a g = 1.98 EPR signal. The light- or dithionite-induced g = 1.98 signal decays with increasing pH above 6.5 and is almost totally absent at pH 8.1 and NaCN concentrations above 300 mM. However, at high pH (8.1), the g = 1.98 signal still forms transiently before it decays with a t(1/2) of approximately 30 min in spinach BBY preparations treated with 100 mM NaCN. Complementary to the disappearance of the g = 1.98 signal with increasing pH or incubation time, a new EPR signal develops at g = 2.0045. This signal has the characteristics of the semiquinone, Q(A)(-), uncoupled from its magnetic interaction with the iron. Prolonged incubation of a high pH, high cyanide treated sample in a cyanide-free medium at pH 6 restores the ability of the sample to develop the cyanide-induced g = 1.98 signal at pH 6.5. This indicates that the iron is not physically dissociated during the high pH cyanide treatment. The high pH, high cyanide effects are accompanied by the conversion of the characteristic Fe2+(S = 2) Mossbauer doublet [isomer shift (Fe) = 1.19 mm/s, quadrupole splitting = 2.95 mm/s] to a new one with parameters (isomer shift = 0.26 mm/s, quadrupole splitting = 0.36 mm/s) characteristic of an Fe2+(S = 0) state. This explains the loss of the magnetic interaction of Q(A)(-) with the iron. The present results, combined with the earlier study, suggest a progressive binding of two or three cyanides at the iron site. The g = 1.98 to g 2.0045 conversion (reflecting the high- to low-spin conversion of the iron) develops as a function of increasing CN- concentration at high pH, with a K-d Of approximately 1.2 mM.

The primary radical pair state, P680+Pheo-, was studied by time-resolved absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, under conditions where quinone reduction and water-splitting activities were inhibited. Charge recombination of the primary radical pair in PS II cores was found to have lifetimes of 17.5 ns measured by fluorescence and 21 ns measured by transient decay kinetics under anaerobic conditions. Transient absorption spectroscopy demonstrated that the activity of the particles, based on primary radical pair formation, was in excess of 70% (depending on the choice of kinetic model), while time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy indicated that the particles were 91% active. These estimates of activity were further supported by steady-state measurements which quantified the amount of photoreducible pheophytin. It is concluded that the PS II core preparation we have isolated is ideal for studying primary radical pair formation and recombination as demonstrated by the correlation of our absorption and fluorescence transient data, which is the first of its kind to be reported in the literature for isolated PS II core complexes from higher plants.									6	1	0	0	6	0	6			0166-8595			WOS:A1992KE44700015	24408837	
J	Latimer, MJ; DeRose, VJ; Yachandra, VK; Sauer, K; Klein, MP								Structural effects of calcium depletion on the manganese cluster of photosystem II: Determination by X-ray absorption spectroscopy								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B				102	42			8257	8265		10.1021/jp981668r				OCT 15 1998	1998	The structural consequences of calcium depletion of Photosystem II (PS II) by treatment at pH 3.0 in the presence of citrate has been determined by Mn K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy. X-ray absorption edge spectroscopy of Ca-depleted samples in the S-1', S-2', and S-3' oxidation states reveals that there is Mn oxidation on the S-1'-S-2' transition, although no evidence of Mn oxidation was found for the S-2'-S-3' transition. This result is in keeping with the results from EPR studies where it has been found that the species oxidized to give the S-3' broad radical signal found in Ca-depleted PS II is tyrosine Y-z. The S-2' state can be prepared by two methods: illumination followed by dark adaptation and illumination in the presence of DCMU to limit to one turnover. Illumination followed by dark adaptation was found to yield a lower Mn K-edge inflection-point energy than illumination with DCMU, indicating vulnerability to reduction of the Mn complex, even over the relatively short times used for dark adaptation (similar to 15 min). EXAFS measurements of Ca-depleted samples in the three modified S states (referred to here as S' states) reveals that the Fourier peak due to scatterers at similar to 3.3 Angstrom from Mn is strongly diminished, consistent with our previous assignment of a Ca-scattering contribution at this distance. Even after Ca depletion, there is still significant amplitude in the third peak, further supporting our conclusions from earlier studies that the third peak in native samples is comprised of both Mn and Ca scattering. The Mn-Mn contributions making up the second Fourier peak at similar to 2.7 Angstrom are largely undisturbed by Ca-depletion, but there is some evidence that S-1'-state samples contain significant amounts of reduced Mn(II), which is then photooxidized in the preparation of higher S' states.

Such large contact surface and appropriate interfacial contact between CNNS and CTFNS plays a critical role in transfer and separation of charge-carriers. The resulting CTFNS/CNNS heterojunction showed significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity under the irradiation of simulated solar light, which could decompose 10 ppm sulfamethazine (SMT) within 180 min with a high degradation efficiency of 95.8 %. Chloride ions can greatly promote the photocatalytic degradation of SMT due to the production of more radical species. O-center dot(2)- is the dominant active species for SMT decomposition over CTFNS/CNNS heterojunction. Moreover, the degradation intermediates of SMT were identified using high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer and the degradation pathway was proposed. This study provides a new insight into the design of 2D/2D heterojunctions using carbon-based nanomaterials, which exhibits great potential in the degradation of sulfonamide antibiotics in wastewaters.									35	1	0	0	8	0	36			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000524462300041	32044635

PCC 6803 with mutations in the domain Gly-351 to Thr-436 of the chlorophyll-binding protein CP47								BIOCHEMISTRY				37	41			14437	14449		10.1021/bi980404s				OCT 13 1998	1998	The requirement of cytochrome c-550 (PSII-V) in photosystem II (PSII) has been assessed in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 containing mutations between Gly-351 and Thr-436 of the loop E domain of the chlorophyll a-binding protein CP47. Six photoautotrophic strains were utilized to compare the effect of removal of either the manganese-stabilizing protein (PSII-O) or PSII-V on PSII activity in vivo. These were a wild-type control; two strains with amino acid deletions, Delta(R384-V392) and Delta(G429-T436); and three carrying specific amino acid substitutions, G351L/T365Q, G351U/E364Q/T365Q, and G351L/E353Q/E355Q/T365Q. The removal of PSII-O prevented the assembly of PSII in Delta(G429-T436) but not in Delta(R384-V392). Neither Delta(G429-T436) nor Delta(R384-V392) could support photoautotrophic growth in the absence of PSII-V. In chloride-limiting conditions, the photoautotrophic growth of Delta(R384-V392) was severely impaired and that of Delta(G429-T436) totally inhibited, and no strains lacking PSTI-V could grow in chloride-limiting or calcium-limiting media. Substitutions at Gly-351, Glu-353, Glu-355, and Thr-365 produced phenotypes that were similar to those of the control in the presence or absence of PSII-O and PSII-V, but removal of PSII-O from G351L/E364Q/T365Q produced a significant reduction of assembled PSII centers and an enhanced sensitivity to photoinactivation while removal of PSII-V prevented photoautotrophic growth. The additional mutants E364Q:Delta PSII-V and E364G:Delta PSII-V demonstrated that this inhibition was a consequence of the mutation at Glu-364. These results also show that the removal of PSII-V, in vivo, produces phenotypes in the CP47 mutants examined that are either similar or more severe than those resulting from the removal of PSII-O.									32	0	0	0	32	0	33			0006-2960			WOS:000076485000012	9772170

The alkylamine-rGO hybrids were synthesized by a facile solid-state reduction process. Within the series, IMBA-rGO exhibited high proton conductivity (PrC), EnC, and optimized PWS capacity. The PrC of IMBA-rGO was from 10(-4) to 10(-3) S cm(-1), which is only half an order less than that for pristine GO. The EnC was 1.25 mu A/V. Though the PWS performances of MA- rGO, BA-rGO, and PA-rGO were comparatively lower, IMBA-rGO could generate about 1.5 times H-2 compared with that for R-TiO2. The IR spectra indicate the association of IMBA and GO by chemical bonds. The Raman spectra show the transformation of GO's nonconductive sp(3) carbon sites into electron-conductive sp(2) carbon centers. The thermogravimetric analysis show improved water adsorbing capacity of IMBA-rGO, which resulted in higher PrC. Doping of the nitrogen atom at the graphitic sp(2) system was confirmed from the presence of pyrrolic N in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectra. The resultant N-type semiconducting behavior is majorly responsible for the PWS process. The powder X-ray diffraction analysis indicates a more flexible interlayer space in IMBA-rGO, which facilitates both the reformation of hydrogen bonds during proton conduction and water dynamics during photocatalysis. The material indicates the possibility of devising graphene-based organic-only multifunctional hybrids.									29	0	0	0	5	0	29			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000518702300079	32043856

The Z-scheme systems were classified into three groups depending on the combination of H-2- and O-2-evolving photocatalysts and electron mediator. The Z-scheme systems combining BaTa2O6:Ir,La with BiVO4, and NaTaO3:Ir,La with BiVO4 were active when a [Co(bpy)(3)](3+/2+) redox couple was used rather than an Fe3+/2+ one. The combination of SrTiO3:Ir with SrTiO3:Rh gave an activity when the [Co(bpy)(3)](3+/2+) and Fe3+/2+ redox couple ionic mediators were used. The Z-scheme systems combining NaNbO3:Rh,Ba and TiO2:Rh,Sb with SrTiO3:Rh showed activities by using the [Co(bpy)(3)](3+/2+) and Fe3+/2+ redox couples and also via interparticle electron transfer by just contact with/without reduced graphene oxide (RGO). These suitable combinations can be explained based on the impurity levels of doped Rh3+ and Ir3+ toward the redox potentials of the ionic mediators for the Z-scheme systems employing ionic mediators, and p-/n-type and onset potentials of the photocurrent in the photoelectrochemical properties of those photocatalyst materials for the Z-scheme systems working via interparticle electron transfer.									20	1	0	0	0	0	20			1359-6640	1364-5498		WOS:000477683600020	31017593

However, so far, there are few comprehensive reports on the mechanism of corrosion inhibition and stability improvement of electrodes in photocatalytic degradation. In this paper, BiVO4/Cu2O heterojunction modified by Cobalt-phosphate (Co-Pi) co-catalyst was successfully prepared to address the aforementioned issues. Co-Pi completed the holes capture and release process through the change of its own chemical state (Co2+/3+-> Co4+-> Co2+/3+), and also affected the energy band bending of the BiVO4/Cu2O heterojunction. In addition, the effect mechanism of the Co-Pi film thickness on the PEC performance of the photoanode was systematically discussed in this report. When the deposition amount was 0.05C.cm(-2), the photocurrent density reached 2.22 mA.cm(-2) at 1.23 V (vs. RHE), which was 2.8 times that of bare BiVO4. The LSV curves, EIS and UV-vis absorption spectra reveal the enhanced PEC performance and light stability of the prepared electrode materials. When it is applied to photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants, BiVO4/Cu2O/0.05Co-Pi shows high activity and potential for MB and CIP degradation, and is expected to be stably applied to the field of photocatalytic degradation of refractory organic pollutants in water.									25	3	0	0	3	0	26			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000600985700001		
J	Kim, SY; Barry, BA								The protein environment surrounding tyrosyl radicals D ' and Z ' in photosystem II: A difference Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopic study								BIOPHYSICAL JOURNAL				74	5			2588	2600		10.1016/S0006-3495(98)77965-2				MAY 1998	1998	Photosystem II contains two redox-active tyrosine residues, termed D and Z, which have different midpoint potentials and oxidation/reduction kinetics. To understand the functional properties of redox-active tyrosines, we report a difference Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic study of these species. Vibrational spectra associated with the oxidation of each tyrosine residue are acquired; electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and fluorescence experiments demonstrate that there is no detectable contribution of Q(A)(-) to these spectra. Vibrational lines are assigned to the radicals by isotopic labeling of tyrosine. Global N-15 labeling, H-2 exchange, and changes in pH identify differences in the reversible interactions of the two redox-active tyrosines with N-containing, titratable amino acid side chains in their environments. To identify the amino acid residue that contributes to the spectrum of D, mutations at His(189) in the D2 polypeptide were examined. Mutations at this site result in substantial changes in the spectrum of tyrosine D, Previously, mutations at the analogous histidine, His(190) in the D1 polypeptide, were shown to have no significant effect on the FT-IR spectrum of tyrosine Z (Bernard, M. T., et at. 1995. J. Biol. Chem. 270:1589-1594). A disparity in the number of accessible, proton-accepting groups could influence electron transfer rates and energetics and account for functional differences between the two redox-active tyrosines.									38	0	0	0	25	0	38			0006-3495	1542-0086		WOS:000073429700044	9591683

In order to determine the dominant species in the FTIR spectrum at a particular point in time after an excitation flash, the decay kinetics of Y-Z(OX) and Q(A)(-) were independently monitored by EPR and chlorophyll a fluorescence, respectively, under the same experimental conditions, These measurements confirmed that the addition of DCMU to Tris-washed PSII samples does not significantly affect the Y-Z(OX) decay, but does substantially slow down the QA(-) decay. By making use of the difference in the decay kinetics using DCMU, the Q(A)(-)/Q(A) Signals could be separated from the Y-Z(OX)/Y-Z signals and a pure Q(A)(-)/Q(A) difference spectrum obtained. By comparison of the Y(Z)(OX)Q(A)(-)/Y(Z)Q(A) difference spectrum with the pure Q(A)(-)/Q(A) difference spectrum, a large differential band at 1706/1699 cm(-1) could be identified and associated with Yz oxidation. In contrast, an intense band at 1478 cm(-1), whose DCMU-sensitive decay follows the QA(-) decay based on the chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements, was present in all of the time-resolved spectra. Since no significant reversible Chl(+) radicals could be detected by the EPR measurements under our experimental conditions, we confirm that this band most likely arises only from the semiquinone anion QA(-).									45	0	0	0	34	0	45			0006-2960			WOS:A1997XY95300024	9305966

The BiOBr/Bi12O17Cl2 composites significantly accelerated the photocatalytic degradation of 4-chlorophenol under simulated sunlight irradiation, and the 100%-BiOBr/Bi12O17Cl2 increased the degradation rate of 4-chlorophenol by 3.2 and 4.1 times in comparison with pristine BiOBr and Bi12O17Cl2, respectively. Additionally, the BiOBr/Bi12O17Cl2 composites displayed superior performance for the degradation of methyl orange and tetracycline under visible light irradiation. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of BiOBr/Bi12O17Cl2 composites is likely attributed to the synergistic effects between BiOBr and Bi12O17Cl2, such as increased surface area, improved light harvesting ability, and most importantly, enhanced separation efficiency of photoinduced charge carriers because of the formation of hetero-junctional interfaces between BiOBr and Bi12O17Cl2. Trapping experiments revealed that superoxide anions and holes were the main reactive species responsible for the degradation of waterborne pollutants. A possible photocatalytic mechanism was proposed based on the observed experimental results. The present work provides insights into design and application of novel, highly efficient and stable bismuth -based photocatalysts for water treatment and purification. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the literature on the ecotoxicological studies with stygobiotic species (i.e. species that complete their life cycle exclusively in groundwater) has not expanded significantly since the first paper published in this field. The limitations regarding the use of stygobiotic species for ecotoxicological testing are clear and consistent across the globe; stygobiotic species are often 1) naturally present in low numbers, 2) difficult to collect, and 3) difficult to culture under laboratory conditions. This paper reviews the methods used in ecotoxicological studies performed with stygobiotic species, and provides ten recommendations for Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) for such tests. The recommendations focused on the following 10 points: 1) the taxonomic identification, the life stage/size and gender of the test organisms; 2) collection methodology of the organisms, including collection location, conditions and methods: 3) holding and acclimation conditions in the laboratory; 4) exposure conditions such as test set up and exposure time, number of replicates and densities of organisms in tests and in test vessels; 5) range-finding test set up and schedule; 6) final test design, including details &controls and treatments, and replication options; 7) incubation conditions, specifying temperature, pH and oxygenation levels throughout the test; 8) test duration; 9) observations and endpoints; 10) test validity criteria and compliance. The recommendations were developed for the purpose of supporting future short-term ecotoxicological testing with stygofauna through providing consistency in the protocols. A discussion of the potential implications for groundwater managers and decision-makers committed to ERA for groundwater is included. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The deposit is spatially and temporally associated with a late Miocene age (6.0 +/- 0.3 Ma) epizonal intrusive complex, characterized by gabbroic and porphyritic rocks of volatile-rich alkali basaltic, hawaiitic, to mugearitic composition. Magmatism and mineralization shortly preceded early Pliocene collision between the northeast Australasian continental margin and an island arc and were probably related to changes in the tectonic configuration leading up to that event.The stocks and dikes which constitute the Porgera intrusive complex have experienced variable degrees of propylitic alteration. Gold mineralization postdates this alteration and occurs in two main stages: (I) disseminated auriferous pyrite in zones of pervasive phyllic alteration, plus minor native gold (Au-degrees) in associated base metal sulfide veins, and (II) locally abundant Au-degrees and Au-Ag tellurides with roscoelite, pyrite, and minor barite in banded, vuggy quartz veins and hydraulic breccias related to late normal faulting.Fluid inclusions from calcite, apatite, and garnet indicate that propylitic alteration mostly involved relatively dilute fluids (less-than-or-equal-to 8 wt % NaCl equiv) at temperatures of up to -450-degrees-C, but more saline fluids (up to 16.8 wt % NaCl equiv) were also present locally. The observation that some inclusions in calcite were trapped under near-critical conditions restricts fluid pressures to approximately 450 bars. Stable isotope compositions of hydrothermal epidote indicate that these fluids were dominantly of ground-water origin, but the data do not enable distinction between sea or meteoric waters. Higher salinity inclusions may record the presence of residual magmatic fluids, and isotopic compositions of disseminated pyrite from propylitically altered rocks (deltaS-34 = 1.4-4.5 parts per thousand) suggest that S was of magmatic origin.Hypersaline fluid inclusions occur in minor quartz from samples of intense stage I phyllic alteration and indicate trapping of a halite-saturated fluid at 200-degrees to 210-degrees-C, with approximately 32 wt percent NaCl equiv. Calculated values of deltaO-18 and deltaD for fluids associated with phyllic alteration range from 9.1 to 10.4 per mil and -55 to -37 per mil, respectively, and overlap the range of Porgera magmatic waters calculated from igneous hornblende and biotite compositions (deltaO-18H2O = 7.9 to 9.3 parts per thousand, deltaD(H2O) = -63 to -49 parts per thousand). Isotopic compositions of stage I disseminated pyrite (deltaS-34 = 2.4-5.2 parts per thousand) are similar to those from propylitic alteration.Fluid inclusions in sphalerite and quartz from stage I base metal sulfide veins are characterized by moderate salinities (9.5 +/- 1.8 wt % NaCl equiv, n = 142) and relatively high homogenization temperatures (299-degrees +/- 33-degrees-C, n = 274). An average formation temperature of 325-degrees-C is estimated for these veins, assuming trapping at approximately 450 bars. The deltaO-18H20 Value calculated from a single quartz sample intergrown with sphalerite is 8.6 per mil and falls within the range of Porgera magmatic waters. Isotopic compositions of vain pyrite, sphalerite, and galena (deltaS-34 = 2.4-5.4 parts per thousand) show a similar range to sulfides from propylitic and phyllic alteration. The deltaC-13 and deltaO-18 values of late-stage vein Mn-Fe-Ca-Mg-carbonates range from -7.1 to -4.5 per mil and 14.8 to 18.3 per mil, respectively. These values are consistent with a magmatic source for C, but deltaO-18H2O values of 4.8 to 8.3 per mil calculated at 200-degrees-C are similar to values derived from late vuggy quartz in the same veins (2.7-6. 1 parts per thousand) and indicate the involvement of ground waters.Homogenization temperatures of fluid inclusions from stage II quartz-roscoelite-Au veins average 146-degrees +/- 13-degrees-C (n = 519). Salinities fall into two populations, averaging 4.3 +/- 0.4 (n = 119) and 7.8 +/- 0.7 wt percent NaCl equiv (n = 439), and inclusions directly associated with roscoelite-Au deposition typically belong to the higher salinity group. Stage II veins are estimated to have formed at approximately 165-degrees-C, and textural and physicochemical considerations suggest that flashing may have occurred during the initial stages of vein rupture. Phase separation may have been triggered by fault-related seismic activity and promoted by the presence of minor CO2 in the ore fluids. Stable isotope compositions of these fluids indicate the involvement of isotopically exchanged meteoric ground waters (deltaO-18H2O = 2.0 to 5.4 parts per thousand, deltaD(H2O) = -62 to -34 parts per thousand). The deltaS-34 values of stage II pyrite range from -14.0 to -11.4 per mil, whereas late vuggy barite and anhydrite yield values of 22.2 and 20.6 per mil, respectively. These data are interpreted to reflect partial oxidation of a fluid with bulk deltaS-34 almost-equal-to 4 per mil.Gold is suggested to have been transported as a chloride complex in early magmatically derived hypersaline fluids, and deposited as disseminated auriferous pyrite during cooling, as a result of sulfidation and sericitization reactions with the mafic igneous wall rocks. In contrast, Au was probably transported as a bisulfide complex in stage I and II veins, and was precipitated after depletion of reduced S in these more dilute fluids through sulfide deposition and phase separation, respectively.Comparisons with other magmatic-related ore-forming systems suggest that a key feature of the Porgera Au deposit is its association with volatile-rich, mafic, alkalic magmas, which were emplaced at shallow crustal levels. Similarities in process are noted with calc-alkalic porphyry Cu deposits, but differences in detail, such as metal inventory and alteration and mineralization styles, reflect a fundamental difference in magmatic affiliation. Stage II mineralization at Porgera shares many characteristics with Au-Ag-Te vein-type, or alkalic-type, deposits. In particular, similarities of magmatic association may reflect a direct link between metallogenesis and large-scale geodynamic processes. Specifically, it is suggested that regions undergoing changes in tectonic configuration (collision, subduction reversal) within a broadly convergent framework, may be suitable for generation of relatively small volumes of anomalous mantle-derived magmas. A relationship to subduction activity is thought to be important in generating melts with relatively high H2O contents. Rapid emplacement at shallow crustal levels and exsolution of an aqueous volatile phase distinguish these systems from typical gabbroic intrusions and associated orthomagmatic deposits, whereas the mafic, alkalic nature of the parental magmas appears to correlate with high Au/Cu ratios in the ore, and distinguishes them from calc-alkalic porphyry Cu deposits.									124	12	0	0	0	1	131			0361-0128			WOS:A1993LW39200003

In this study, the melting and evaporation process of neutral salt was first introduced to produce nitrogen-rich interpenetrated porous HC (NIP-HC) as the anode for SIBs. Such a protocol allows for the first-demonstrated porous structure for HC materials with desired electronic conductivity and much improved rate performance than the conventional porous structure. As a result, high reversible capacity (358 mA h g(-1)) and enhanced rate property (239.8 mA h g(-1) at 2 A g(-1)) are achieved with improved electrode kinetics and electron conductivity because of the accelerated charge transfer derived from the unique porosity and nitrogen heteroatom-doping. More interestingly, the increase of the surface area of NIP-HC does not lead to a decrease of the initial efficiency. At the same time, a high plateau capacity (172.8 mA h g(-1)) can be obtained below 0.1 V, which shows great potential for practical application in the full cells. As suggested by IG/ID from Raman tests, the degree of graphitization increases accompanied by the melting and evaporation process, which improves the electrical conductivity of the HC material as well. Furthermore, according to first-principle calculations, it is found that the nitrogen is conducive to increasing the electron density around the Fermi level, which intrinsically enhances the electrical conductivity and enriches active sites for sodium-ion storage. The result from this study has provided insights into producing interpenetrated porous HC by a simple and novel salt melting and evaporation process and enriched the methods of pore structure preparation.									38	7	0	0	0	0	40			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000508464500055	31845792

This experiment was conducted to examine the influence on cold tolerance ability of chickpea (Cicer aurentium cv. Mufitbey) seedlings of AOX activator (pyruvate), AOX inhibitor (salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM)) and an inhibitor of the cytochrome pathway of respiration (antimycin A) treatments. 5 mM pyruvate, 2 mu M antimycin A and 4 mM SHAM solutions were exogenously applied to thirteen-day-old chickpea leaves and then the seedlings were transferred to a different plant growth chamber arranged to 10/5 degrees C (day/night) for 48 h. Cold stress markedly increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes compared to controls. Pyruvate and antimycin A significantly increased the cold-induced increase in antioxidant activity but SHAM decreased it. Cold-induced increases in superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, and lipid peroxidation levels were significantly reduced by pyruvate and antimycin A, but increased by SHAM treatment. Pyruvate and antimycin A application increased both the activity and protein expression of AOX in comparison to cold stress alone. However, SHAM significantly decreased activity of AOX but did not affect its expression. Total cellular respiration values (TCRV) supported the changes in activity and expression of AOX. While TCRV were increased by cold and pyruvate, they were significantly reduced by SHAM and especially antimycin A. These results indicate that pyruvate and antimycin A applications were effective in reducing oxidative stress by activating the alternative respiratory pathway as well as antioxidant activity. Furthermore, direct activation of AOX, rather than inhibition of the cytochrome pathway, was the most effective way to mitigate cold stress. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

J	Mohanty, P; Vani, B; Prakash, JSS								Elevated temperature treatment induced alteration in thylakoid membrane organization and energy distribution between the two photosystems in Pisum sativum								ZEITSCHRIFT FUR NATURFORSCHUNG SECTION C-A JOURNAL OF BIOSCIENCES				57	9-10			836	842						SEP-OCT 2002	2002	Two-week-old pea (Pisum sativum var. Arkal) plants were subjected to elevated temperature (38 degreesC/42 degreesC) in dark for 14-15 h. The effect of heat treatment on light- induced phosphorylation of LHCII and LHCII migration in the thylakoid membranes were investigated. The heat treatment did cause a substantial (more than two fold) increase in the extent of LHCII phosphorylation as compared to the control. Upon separation of appressed and non-appressed thylakoid fractions by digitonin treatment, the heat-treated samples showed a decrease in LHCII-related polypeptides from the grana stack (appressed region) over the control. Further, a small increase in the intensity of these (LHCII-related) bands was detected in stromal thylakoid fraction (non-appressed membranes). This suggests an enhanced extent of migration of phosphorylated LHCII from appressed to non-appressed regions due to in vivo heat treatment of pea plants. We also isolated the LHCII from control and heat treated (42 degreesC) pea seedlings. Analysis of CD spectra revealed a 5 - 6 run blue shift in the 638 run negative peak in heat treated samples suggesting alteration in the organization of Chl b in the LHCII macro-aggregates. These results suggest that in vivo heat stress not only alters the extent of migration of LHCII to stromal region, but also affects the light harvesting mechanism by LHCII associated with the grana region.									48	2	0	0	47	2	52			0939-5075	1865-7125		WOS:000179512100014	12440721

Their reactivity is determined by the atomic level distribution of the transition metal in the LDH cation layer, which is essential to control the design of LDHs with optimized properties. However, low crystallinity, absence of long range order, and/or isoelectronic ions often prevent atomic level structural characterization. A series of poorly crystalline Mg2-xNixAl-NO3 LDH materials were investigated by ultrafast Al-27 MAS NMR spectroscopy to determine the distribution of Ni2+ in these as well as possible superstructures and their miscibility gaps. Four Ni2Al-LDH samples with interlayer distances ranging from 7.6 to 17.5 angstrom were prepared to assess the contribution of inter- and intralayer magnetic interactions. The effects of the Ni2+ content and the atomic level distribution of Ni2+ were probed by ultrafast Al-27 MAS NMR spectroscopy: the Al distribution can be modeled using a binomial distribution and neither a superstructure was identified for the MgNiAl-LDH sample nor a miscibility gap. The Al-27 isotropic shift, (iso)(Al-27), is a very sensitive probe for a number of neighboring Ni2+ in the first metal ion sphere, but to a smaller degree it is also affected by the intercalated anion (interlayer distance). These results were used for detailed characterization of an exfoliated (2D)-restacked Mg1.83Ni0.17Al-LDH nanohybrid material and a Mg1.83Ni0.17Al-LDH-alginate nanohybrid material, in which Al-27 MAS NMR showed how the structure and partial dissolution of the LDHs were retained. In contrast, both powder X-ray diffraction and vibrational spectroscopies (IR and Raman) reflected only the overall change in sample composition.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000448345400017	30259013

K-M values for Mn2+ were determined from steady-state electron transfer between Mn2+ and 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol, the dissociation constant for Mn2+ was measured by observing the effect of added Mn2+ on the reduction of the primary donor P680(+) after a saturating flash, and single-turnover electron donation from Mn2+ was followed by monitoring the decay kinetics of the EPR signal from the flash-induced tyrosine Z(OX) radical. K-M values for Mn2+ were found to be highly pH-dependent in both modified and unmodified photosystem II membranes. Treatment with histidine modifiers after removal of the manganese complex increased the KM values between 2.5 and 10 times and increased the dissociation constant for Mn2+ 8-fold, compared to membranes that were modified in the presence of the manganese cluster. Modification of carboxylic acid residues after removal of the manganese cluster increased the K-M about 5-fold compared to membranes that were modified in the presence of the manganese cluster. The reduction rate of tyrosine Z(OX) by Mn2+ was diminished after modification of either histidine or carboxylic acid residues. The apparent second-order rate constant decreased from 2.6 x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1) to 0.05 x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1) after histidine modification in the presence or absence of manganese, to 0.77 x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1) after carboxylic acid residue modification in the presence of manganese, and to 0.18 x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1) after carboxylic acid modification in the absence of manganese. Our results indicate the existence of two different manganese binding sites containing histidine, and at least two manganese sites with carboxylic acid residues, which are differently shielded against modifying agents by the native manganese cluster.									35	2	1	0	26	0	35			0006-2960			WOS:A1997WN88600026	9116003

Mean Fe-A(3+)-Fe-B(3+) and Zn-A(2+)-Zn-B(2+) distances are 3.24 Angstrom and 3.43 Angstrom, respectively. In both derivatives, metal ions at sites A and B are bridged by a glutamate side-chain (Glu50) in a syn-syn conformation. The Fe3+ derivative alone shows a third metal site (Fe-C(3+)) joined to Fe-B(3+) by a long anti-anti bidentate bridge through Glu130 (mean Fe-B(3+)-Fe-C(3+) distance 5.79 Angstrom). The third metal site is unique to the non-haem bacterial ferritins.The dinuclear site lies at the inner end of a hydrophobic channel connecting it to the outside surface of the protein shell, which may provide access for dioxygen and possibly for metal ions shielded by water. Models representing the possible binding mode of dioxygen to the dinuclear Fe3+ pair suggest that a gauche mu -1,2 mode may be preferred stereochemically.Like those of other ferritins, the 24 subunits of EcFtnA are folded as four-helix bundles that assemble into hollow shells and both metals bind at dinuclear centres in the middle of the bundles. The structural similarity of EcFtnA to the human H chain ferritin (HuHF) is remarkable (r.m.s. deviation of main-chain atoms 0.66 Angstrom) given the low amino acid sequence identity (22%). Many of the conserved residues are clustered at the dinuclear centre but there is very little conservation of residues making inter-subunit interactions.

We propose that the intervening sequences between homologous cysteines in the F(X) cluster form two flexible loops and participate in the binding of PsaC, and that the arginine residues in the two surface-exposed loops may promote the interaction between the P700-F(X) core and the subunit. The model was tested experimentally; chemical modification of arginine residues in the P700-F(X) core using phenylglyoxal prevented reconstitution of the core with PsaC and PsaD after insertion of FeS clusters in vitro. Treatment of the P700-F(X) core with trypsin also prevented reconstitution of terminal electron transfer to F(A)F(B), although neither treatments affected the electron transfer to F(X) as judged by flash kinetic spectrophotometry. Electron transfer in the P700-F(A)F(B) complex was not impaired by either phenylglyoxal or trypsin treatment indicating that the small subunit(s) protect the arginine residues that become chemically modified or cleaved. The data are consistent with the working model and point to additional experiments designed to identify the specific residues involved in the interaction between the P700-F(x) core and PsaC.									23	1	0	0	19	0	24			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:A1993LD64100001	24318792

We drove spinach-PSII membranes by nanosecond-laser flashes synchronously through the water-oxidation cycle and traced the PSII processes by time-resolved single-frequency infrared (IR) spectroscopy in the spectral range of symmetric carboxylate vibrations of protein side chains. After the collection of IR-transients from 100 ns to 1 s, we analyzed the proton-removal step in the S-2 double right arrow S-3 transition, which precedes the ET that oxidizes the Mn4CaOx-cluster. Around 1400 cm(-1), pronounced changes in the IR-transients reflect this pre-ET process (similar to 40 mu s at 20 degrees C) and the ET step (similar to 300 mu s at 20 degrees C). For transients collected at various temperatures, unconstrained multi-exponential simulations did not provide a coherent set of time constants, but constraining the ET time constants to previously determined values solved the parameter correlation problem and resulted in an exceptionally high activation energy of 540 +/- 30 meV for the pre-ET step. We assign the pre-ET step to deprotonation of a group that is re-protonated by accepting a proton from the substrate-water, which binds concurrently with the ET step. The analyzed IR-transients disfavor carboxylic-acid deprotonation in the pre-ET step. Temperature-dependent amplitudes suggest thermal equilibria that determine how strongly the proton-removal step is reflected in the IR-transients. Unexpectedly, the proton-removal step is only weakly reflected in the 1400 cm(-1) transients of PSII core complexes of a thermophilic cyanobacterium (T. elongatus).									8	0	0	0	4	0	8			0021-9606	1089-7690		WOS:000596137600001	33291916

However, little is known about the roles of the key enzymes in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in response to environmental stress, such as UV-B radiation and drought. To understand this problem, we investigated the participation of flavanone 3-hydroxylase gene (F3H), a key enzyme in flavonoid biosynthetic pathway under UV-B radiation and drought stress in the desert plant Reaumuria soongorica. A novel cDNA sequence, named as RsF3H, was isolated from R. soongorica. The deduced amino acids showed high identities to other F3Hs. A phylogenetic analysis indicated that RSF3H appeared to be most homologous to F3H from Malus domestica (MdF3H). RsF3H protein structure contained all five conserved motifs for 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (2-ODDs) and an Arg-X-Ser motif, all of which were also found in other F3Hs. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that there was a rapid increase in gene expression of R5F3H under stress. Both UV-B radiation and drought stress induced an increase in RsF3H enzyme activity and the accumulation of the products in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway (total flavonoid and anthocyanin). The antioxidant ability (inhibition of lipid oxidation) of total flavonoid was enhanced during this study. The results suggested that one explanation of the stress tolerance of R. soongorica may be a combination of an increase in RsF3H gene expression, RsF3H enzyme activity and the anti-oxidative ability of the metabolic end products in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in response to UV-B radiation and drought.

With the aim of determining the contribution of UV-vis radiation to the browning phenomenon, two types of glass bottles were employed: topaz bottles (with low values of transmittance in the UV-visible range) and transparent bottles. To identify significant differences between the wine before and after being subjected to the influence of the UV-vis radiation, the values of absorbance at 420 nm and the concentrations of various polyphenolic and volatile compounds were submitted to a multivariate variance analysis. Both factors considered (time and type of bottle) had a statistically significant effect on the values of absorbance at 420 nm and on the concentration of most of the polyphenolic compounds, whereas only the "time" factor was significant for volatile compounds. All wines showed losses in several polyphenolic compounds, which were more severe for the wines bottled in transparent glasses. However, these wines exhibited a lower degree of visual browning (abs 420 nm). In the case of volatile compounds, most of these presented increases during storage exposed to the influence of the UV-vis radiation.									31	0	0	0	23	0	32			0021-8561			WOS:000185990500018	14558766

In this work, a cDNA sequence (CsTpx3) encoding a TPX was identified from C. suppressalis. The deduced CsTPX3 protein shares high sequence identity and two positionally conserved cysteines with orthologs from other insect species, and was classified as a typical 2-Cys TPX. CsTpx3 was expressed most highly during the fifth-instar larval stage, and transcripts were most abundant in the midgut. Recombinant CsTPX3 protein expressed in Escherichia coil displayed the expected peroxidase activity by removing H2O2. Furthermore, CsTPX3 protected DNA from oxidative damage, and E coil cells overexpressing CsTPX3 exhibited long-term resistance to oxidative stress. Exposure to various oxidative stressors. such as cold (8 degrees C), heat (35 degrees C), bacteria (E. coli), and two insecticides (chlorpyrifos and lambda-cyhalothrin), significantly upregulated transcription of CsTpx3. However, exposure to abamectin had no such effect. Our results provide valuable information for future studies on the antioxidant mechanism in this insect species.									5	1	0	0	4	0	6			0739-4462	1520-6327		WOS:000442489800004	29873106

JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				215	22			3865	3873		10.1242/jeb.074765				NOV 2012	2012	Average sea-surface temperature and the amount of CO2 dissolved in the ocean are rising as a result of increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2. Many coral reef fishes appear to be living close to their thermal optimum, and for some of them, even relatively moderate increases in temperature (2-4 degrees C) lead to significant reductions in aerobic scope. Reduced aerobic capacity could affect population sustainability because less energy can be devoted to feeding and reproduction. Coral reef fishes seem to have limited capacity to acclimate to elevated temperature as adults, but recent research shows that developmental and transgenerational plasticity occur, which might enable some species to adjust to rising ocean temperatures. Predicted increases in P-CO2, and associated ocean acidification, can also influence the aerobic scope of coral reef fishes, although there is considerable interspecific variation, with some species exhibiting a decline and others an increase in aerobic scope at near-future CO2 levels. As with thermal effects, there are transgenerational changes in response to elevated CO2 that could mitigate impacts of high CO2 on the growth and survival of reef fishes. An unexpected discovery is that elevated CO2 has a dramatic effect on a wide range of behaviours and sensory responses of reef fishes, with consequences for the timing of settlement, habitat selection, predator avoidance and individual fitness. The underlying physiological mechanism appears to be the interference of acid-base regulatory processes with brain neurotransmitter function. Differences in the sensitivity of species and populations to global warming and rising CO2 have been identified that will lead to changes in fish community structure as the oceans warm and becomes more acidic; however, the prospect for acclimation and adaptation of populations to these threats also needs to be considered. Ultimately, it will be the capacity for species to adjust to environmental change over coming decades that will determine the impact of climate change on marine ecosystems.									134	5	0	0	117	0	136			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000310525700005	23100485

Laboratory measurements on the returned samples are useful if what is measured is evidence of phenomena on Mars rather than of the effects of sterilization conditions. This report establishes that there are categories of measurements that can be fruitful despite sample sterilization and other categories that cannot.Sterilization kills living microorganisms and inactivates complex biological structures by breaking chemical bonds. Sterilization has similar effects on chemical bonds in non-biological compounds, including abiotic or pre-biotic reduced carbon compounds, hydrous minerals, and hydrous amorphous solids. We considered the sterilization effects of applying dry heat under two specific temperature-time regimes and the effects of gamma-irradiation.Many measurements of volatile-rich materials are sterilization sensitive-they will be compromised by either dehydration or radiolysis upon sterilization. Dry-heat sterilization and gamma-irradiation differ somewhat in their effects but affect the same chemical elements. Sterilization-sensitive measurements include the abundances and oxidation-reduction (redox) states of redox-sensitive elements, and isotope abundances and ratios of most of them. All organic molecules, and most minerals and naturally occurring amorphous materials that formed under habitable conditions, contain at least one redox-sensitive element. Thus, sterilization-sensitive evidence about ancient life on Mars and its relationship to its ancient environment will be severely compromised if the samples collected by Mars 2020 rover Perseverance cannot be analyzed in an unsterilized condition.To ensure that sterilization-sensitive measurements can be made even on samples deemed unsafe for unsterilized release from containment, contingency instruments in addition to those required for curation, time-sensitive science, and the Sample Safety Assessment Protocol would need to be added to the Sample Receiving Facility (SRF). Targeted investigations using analogs of MSR Campaign-relevant returned-sample types should be undertaken to fill knowledge gaps about sterilization effects on important scientific measurements, especially if the sterilization regimens eventually chosen are different from those considered in this report.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1531-1074	1557-8070		WOS:000798288800001	34904892	
J	Jorgensen, CB								Amphibian respiration and olfaction and their relationships: from Robert Townson (1794) to the present								BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS				75	3			297	345		10.1017/S0006323100005491				AUG 2000	2000	The present review examines the developments in the elucidation of the mechanisms of amphibian respiration and olfaction. Research in these two areas has largely proceeded along independent lines, despite the fact that ventilation of the nasobuccopharyngeal cavity is a basic element in both functions. The English naturalist Robert Townson demonstrated, in the 1790s, that amphibians, contrary to general belief, ventilated the lungs by a pressure-pump mechanism. Frogs and other amphibians respire by alternatively dilating and contracting the buccopharyngeal cavity. During dilatation, with the mouth and glottis closed, air is sucked in through the open nostrils to fill the cavity. During contraction of the throat, with nostrils closed and glottis open, the air in the buccopharyngeal cavity is pressed into the lungs. During expiration, the glottis and nostrils open and air is expelled from the lungs 'by their own contraction from a state of distention'. Herholdt (1801), a Danish army surgeon, independently described the buccal pressure-pump mechanism in frogs, his experiments being confirmed by the commissioners of the Societe Philomatique in Paris. Hare (1842) reintroduced a suction mechanism for amphibian respiration, which Panizza (1845) refuted: excision of the tympanic membranes prevented lung inflation, the air in the buccopharyngeal cavity leaving through the tympanum holes. Closure of the holes with the fingers restored lung inflation. The importance of cutaneous respiration in frogs and other amphibians was discovered by Spallanzani (1803), who found that frogs might survive excision of the lungs and that the amounts of exhaled carbon dioxide were small compared with those eliminated through the skin. Edwards (1824) confirmed and extended Spallanzani's findings, and Regnault & Reiset (1849) attempted to establish the relative importance of skin and lungs as respiratory organs in frogs. The problem was solved by Krogh (1904a) who measured respiration through the skin and lungs separately and simultaneously. Krogh (1904a) confirmed that carbon dioxide was chiefly eliminated through the skin, correlated with its high diffusion rate in water and tissue, whereas the pattern of oxygen uptake varied seasonally, the pulmonary uptake being lower than the cutaneous during autumn and winter, but substantially higher during the breeding period. Dolk & Postma (1927) confirmed this respiratory pattern, More recently, Hutchison and coworkers hal-e examined the relative role of pulmonary and cutaneous gas exchange in a large number of amphibians, equipped with head masks for the separate measurement of the lung respiration in normally ventilating animals (Vinegar & Hutchison, 1965; Guimond & Hutchison, 1968; Hutchison, Whitford & Kohl, 1968. Whitford & largely proceeded along independent lines, despite Hutchison, 1963, 1965, 1966). As early as 1758, Rosel von Rosenhof suggested that the lungs of frogs in water functioned as hydrostatic organs chat permitted the animal to float at the surface or rest on the bottom of the pond. The suggestion was inspired by observations made in the second half of the seventeenth century by members of the Royal Academy of Sciences in Paris. The French anatomists demonstrated that a tortoise, presumably the European freshwater turtle Emys orbicularis, could regulate its buoyancy by changing the volume of the lungs, to descend passively or ascend in the water.The hydrostatic function of the lungs has been repeatedly rediscovered, by Emery (1869) in the frog, by Marcacci (1895) in frogs, toads and salamanders, by Whipple (1906b) in a newt, by Willem (1920, 1931) in frogs and Xenopus laevis, by Speer (1942) in several anurans and urodeles, and finally by deJongh (1972) in Xenopus laevis. In the second half of the nineteenth century a number of important papers appeared which confirmed and extended Townson's (1794) and Panizza's (1845) analysis of the normal respiratory movements in frogs. Lung ventilation cycles, interspaced by oscillatory movements of the throat, might periodically be replaced by a sequence predominated by inspirations, resulting in lung inflation, followed by exhalations that restored nor-mal lung volume. Babak (1912a) established that inflations were reactions to the experimental manipulations, and that in resting, undisturbed frogs, lung ventilations normally occurred singly, interspaced by series of approximately 10-50 buccal oscillations. Extensive comparative studies early in the century showed that the respiratory mechanisms and patterns were basically similar in all anurans and urodeles investigated. The modern era of investigations in amphibian respiration began with the work of deJongh & Gans (1969). They recorded pressures in the buccal cavity, lungs and visceral cavity and electrical activity of some 15 muscles possibly associated with respiration in the bullfrog Rana catesbeiana. The respiration recorded in the frogs was predominated by cycles of lung inflation and deflation, consistent with substantially but not excessively disturbed frogs. Studies by other investigators on various anuran species showed respiratory patterns that varied strongly with respect to the frequency and degree of lung inflations, presumably reflecting degrees to which the experimental conditions affected the breathing.The elucidation of the role of the buccopharyngeal ventilation in amphibian olfaction can be traced to the realization in the 1890s that the nasal cavity has a double function in being both the seat of the sense of small and part of the respiratory passages. The ability of amphibians to smell and to react to air-borne or water-borne chemical cues in the environment thus depends on the oscillatory movements of the buccal floor which ventilate the nasal cavity. Experimental evidence for a sense of smell was, however, lacking, and it was first furnished in urodele feeding early in the present century. Despite the demonstration of the fundamental role of the nasobuccal oscillatory ventilation in olfactory responses to food in newts, the oscillatory throat movements in amphibians continued, however, to be referred to as respiratory. Evidence concerning the role of the buccopharyngeal ventilation in respiration had been circumstantial until Whitford & Hutchison (1963, 1965, 1966) determined the relative importance of cutaneous and pulmonary/buccopharyngeal respiration in lunged and lungless salamanders. In lungless salamanders, the buccopharyngeal mucosa accounted for approximately 25% of the total oxygen consumption, and it was concluded that buccopharyngeal oscillatory ventilation in salamanders is primarily respiratory in function, a possible olfactory function being secondary. During the last decades an extensive literature has accumulated on the role played by olfaction in the life of urodeles, but also in feeding in anurans. Often the descriptions of behaviour elicited by air-borne or water-borne odours also note increased oscillatory movements of the buccal floor, indicating the importance of the ventilation of the nasal cavity. In the elucidation of the functional significance of buccal oscillations in vertebrate evolution, the reptiles are of particular interest because such oscillations are also known in chelonians. crocodiles and some lizards. Olfaction plays a role in the life of chelonians and crocodiles which respire by means of suction mechanisms. The throat movements ale thus not concerned with the ventilation of the lungs but presumably with olfaction. It is thus indicated that in tower vertebrates, including the amphibians, the shallow oscillatory movements of the buccal floor primarily serve to establish olfactory contact with the surrounding medium, air or water, whereas a respiratory function is secondary.									41	2	0	0	38	0	44			1464-7931	1469-185X		WOS:000089733200001	11034014

Cation binding to the apo-WOC-PSII protein was measured by: (1) inhibition of the rate and yield of photoactivation, the light-induced recovery of O-2 evolution by assembly of the functional Mn4Ca1Clx, core from its constituent inorganic cofactors (Mn2+, Ca2+, and Cl-); and by (2) inhibition of the PSII-mediated light-induced electron transfer from Mn2+ to an electron acceptor (DCIP), Together, these methods enable discrimination between inhibition at the high- and low-affinity Mn2+ sites and the Ca2+ site of the apo-WOC-PSII. Unexpectedly strong binding: of large alkali cations (Cs+ >> Rb+ > K+ > Na+ >Li+) was found to smoothly correlate with decreasing cation charge density, exhibiting one of the largest Cs+/Li+ selectivities (greater than or equal to 5000) for any known chelator, Both photoactivation and electron-transfer measurements at selected Mn2+ and Ca2+ concentrations reveal that Cs+ binds to the high-affinity Mn2+ site with a slightly greater affinity (2-3-fold at pH 6.0) than Mn2+, while binding about 10(4)-fold more weakly to the Ca2+-specific site required for reassembly of functional O-2 evolving centers. In contrast to Cs+, divalent cations larger than Mn2+ bind considerably more weakly to the high-affinity Mn2+ site (Mn2+ >> Ca2+ > Sr2+). Their affinities correlate with the hydrolysis constant for formation of the metal hydroxide by hydrolysis of water: Me-aq(2+) --> [MeOH](+)(aq) + H-aq(+) Along with the strong stimulation of the rate of photoactivation by alkaline pH, these metal cation trends support the interpretation that [MnOH](+) is the active species that forms upon binding of Mn-aq(2+) to apo-WOC. Further support for this interpretation is found by the unusually strong inhibition of Mn2+ photooxidation by the linear uranyl cation (UO22+), The intrinsic binding constant for [MnOH](+) to apo-WOC was determined using a thermodynamic cycle to be K = 4.0 x 10(15) M-1 (at pH 6.0), consistent with a high-affinity, preorganized, multidentate coordination site.We propose that the selectivity for binding [MnOH](+), a linear low charge-density monocation, vs symmetrical Me2+ dications is functionally important for assembly of the WOC by enabling: (1) discrimination against higher charge density alkaline earth cations (Mg2+ and Ca2+) and smaller alkali metal cations (Na+ and K+) that are present in considerably greater abundance in vivo, and thus would suppress photoactivation; and (2) higher affinity binding of the one Ca2+ ion or the remaining three Mn2+ ions via coordination to form mu-hydroxo-bridged intermediates, apo-WOC-[Mn(mu-OH)(2)Mn](3+) or apo-WOC-[Mn(mu-OH)Ca](3+), during subsequent assembly steps of the native Mn4Ca1Clx core. In contrast to more acidic Me2+ divalent ion inhibitors of the high-affinity Mn2+ site, like Ca2+ and Sr2+, Cs+ does not accelerate the decay of the first light-induced intermediate, IM1, formed during photoactivation (attributed to apo-WOC-[Mn(OH)(2)](+)). The inability of Cs+ to promote decay of IM1, despite having comparable affinity as Mn2+, is consistent with its considerably weaker Lewis acidity, resulting in the reprotonation of IM1 by water becoming the rate-limiting step for decay Drier to displacement of Mn2+. All four different lines of evidence provide a self-consistent picture indicating that the initial step in assembly of the WOC involves high-affinity binding of [MnOH](+).									38	1	0	0	30	0	38			0006-2960			WOS:000080691200023	10353831

In this study, the full-length cDNA of T beta 4 was cloned and identified in Crassostrea hongkongensis, designated as ChT beta 4. The full-length cDNA of ChT beta 4 consists of 530 bp with an open reading frame of 126 bp encoding a 41 amino acid polypeptide. SMART analysis indicated that there is one thymosin domain and a highly conserved actin-binding motif (18LKKTET23) in ChT beta 4. In vivo injection of recombinant ChT beta 4 protein could significantly increase total hemocytes count in oysters, and knockdown of the expression of ChT beta 4 resulted in a significant decrease in the circulating hemocytes. Tissue distribution analysis revealed a ubiquitous presence of ChT beta 4, with the highest expression in hemocytes. The upregulated transcripts of ChT beta 4 in response to bacterial challenge and tissue injury suggest that ChT beta 4 is involved in both innate immunity against pathogen infection and wound healing. Moreover, bacteria-clearance experiment showed ChT beta 4 could facilitate the clearance of injected bacteria in oysters. In vivo injection with ChT beta 4 resulted in reduction of the intracellular ROS in hemocytes, which was associated with increased expression of antioxidant enzymes Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD), Catalase, and Glutathione Peroxidase (GPX) by pre-treatment with ChT beta 4. These results suggest that ChT beta 4 is a thymosin beta-4 homolog and plays a vital role in the immune defense of C. hongkongensis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, partial sequences of HIF were first reported for subtidal nassariid gastropods, Nassarius siquijorensis and Nassarius conoidalis. The phylogenetic tree of HIF-alpha among various animal groups was inferred. Adults of both N. siquijorensis and N. conoidalis were exposed to 24 h and 1 week hypoxia (1.5 mg O-2 l(-1)) and the change of HIF-alpha mRNA level was determined in gill, foot muscle and hepatopancreas by using quantitative real-time PCR. The expression profile of HIF-alpha was also investigated in veliger larvae after 1 and 24 h hypoxia exposure. The HIF-alpha mRNA from gills of N. siquijorensis was 2.22-fold elevated after 24 h of exposure but returned back to the baseline level after 1 week of exposure. In contrast to N. siquijorensis, both short-term and long-term exposure to hypoxia significantly enhanced the mRNA level of HIF-alpha in the gill of N. conoidalis. Both 24 h and 1 week of exposure resulted in a significantly higher degree of expression of mRNA of HIF-alpha in the foot muscle of N. siquijorensis and N. conoidalis. For hepatopancreas, the mRNA level of HIF-alpha remained unchanged in N. siquijorensis after both 24 h and 1 week of exposure to hypoxia but a significant enhancement was observed in N. conoidalis after 1 week of exposure to hypoxia. The mRNA level of HIF-alpha significantly reduced after 24 h of exposure to hypoxia in the larvae of N. siquijorensis. The different expression patterns of HIF-alpha mRNA between the two species reflected their different adaptation abilities to hypoxia, which will further explain the differences in the distribution of these species in Hong Kong waters with N. siquijorensis being predominant in regions suffered from summer hypoxia.

Upregulation of FP's frequently occurs in injured or compromised coral tissue, suggesting a potential role of coral FPs in host stress responses.Methodology/Principal Findings: The presence of FPs was determined and quantified for a subsample of seven healthy Caribbean coral species using spectral emission analysis of tissue extracts. FP concentration was correlated with the in vivo antioxidant potential of the tissue extracts by quantifying the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) scavenging rates. FPs of the seven species varied in both type and abundance and demonstrated a positive correlation between H2O2 scavenging rate and FP concentration. To validate this data, the H2O2 scavenging rates of four pure scleractinian FPs, cyan (CFP), green (GFP), red (RFP) and chromoprotein (CP), and their mutant counterparts (without chromophores), were investigated. In vitro, each FP scavenged H2O2 with the most efficient being CP followed by equivalent activity of CFP and RFP. Scavenging was significantly higher in all mutant counterparts.Conclusions/Significance: Both naturally occurring and pure coral FPs have significant H2O2 scavenging activity. The higher scavenging rate of RFP and the CP in vitro is consistent with observed increases of these specific FPs in areas of compromised coral tissue. However, the greater scavenging ability of the mutant counterparts suggests additional roles of scleractinian FPs, potentially pertaining to their color. This study documents H2O2 scavenging of scleractinian FPs, a novel biochemical characteristic, both in vivo across multiple species and in vitro with purified proteins. These data support a role for FPs in coral stress and immune responses and highlights the multi-functionality of these conspicuous proteins.									109	0	0	0	99	1	110			1932-6203			WOS:000270593800011	19806218

(1997) Biochemistry 36, 9261-9266] that incubation of photosystem II preparations with NO at -30 degrees C in the dark results in the formation of a new intermediate of the water-oxidizing complex. This is characterized by an EPR signal centered at g = 2 with prominent manganese hyperfine structure. We have examined the detailed structure of the signal using difference EPR spectroscopy. This is facilitated by the observations that NO can be completely removed without decrease or modification of the signal, and illumination at 0 degrees C eliminates the signal. The signal spans 1600 G and is characterized by sharp hyperfine structure. (NO)-N-14 and (NO)-N-15 cw EPR combined with pulsed ENDOR and ESEEM studies show no detectable contributions of the nitrogen nucleus to the spectrum. The spectrum bears similarities to the experimental spectrum of the Mn(II)-Mn(III) catalase [Zheng, M., Khangulov, S. V., Dismukes, G. C., and Barynin, V. V. (1994) Inorg. Chem. 33, 382-387]. Simulations allowing small variations in the catalase-tensor values result in an almost accurate reproduction of the NO-induced signal. This presents strong evidence for the assignment of the latter to a magnetically isolated Mn(II)-Mn(III) dimer. Since the starting oxidation states of Mn are higher than II, we deduce that NO acts effectively as a reductant, e.g., Mn(III)-Mn(III) + NO --> Mn(II)-Mn(III) + NO+. The temperature dependence of the nonsaturated EPR-signal intensity in the range 2-20 K indicates that the signal results from a ground state. The cw microwave power saturation data in the range 4-8 K can be interpreted assuming an Orbach relaxation mechanism with an excited state at Delta = 42 K. Assuming antiferromagnetic coupling, -2/S-1 . S-2 between the two manganese ions, assigned to a magnetically isolated Mn(II)-Mn(III) dimer bears important consequences in interpreting the structure of the Mn cluster. Although the signal is not currently assigned to a particular S state, it arises from a state lower than S-1, possibly lower than S-0, too.									27	0	0	0	11	0	27			0006-2960			WOS:000072759300002	9530284

(2000b) Trends BiotechnoL 18: 506; Melis et al. (2000) Plant Physiol. 122: 127]. The current work focuses on (a) the effects of different initial extracellular pHs on the inactivation of photosystem II (PSII) and O-2-sensitive H-2-production activity in sulfur-deprived algal cells and (b) the relationships among H-2-production, photosynthetic, aerobic and anaerobic metabolisms under different pH regimens. The maximum rate and yield of H-2 production occur when the pH at the start of the sulfur deprivation period is 7.7 and decrease when the initial pH is lowered to 6.5 or increased to 8.2. The pH profile of hydrogen photoproduction correlates with that of the residual PSII activity (optimum pH 7.3-7.9), but not with the pH profiles of photosynthetic electron transport through photosystem I or of starch and protein degradation. In vitro hydrogenase activity over this pH range is much higher than the actual in situ rates of H-2 production, indicating that hydrogenase activity per se is not limiting. Starch and protein catabolisms generate formate, acetate and ethanol; contribute some reductant for H-2 photoproduction, as indicated by 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)1,1-dimethylurea and 2,5-dibromo-6-isopropyl-3-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone inhibition results; and are the primary sources of reductant for respiratory processes that remove photo-synthetically generated O-2. Carbon balances demonstrate that alternative metabolic pathways predominate at different pHs, and these depend on whether residual photosynthetic activity is present or not.									186	13	4	0	133	1	203			0032-0781			WOS:000181079400006	12610217

Acetylene reduction assays performed on a Lyngbya sp. and two Microcoleus chthonoplastes dominated microbial mats showed a typical diel pattern of nitrogenase activity in these mats. The highest rates of activity were found at night, with 40 and 37 mumol C2H4 m(-2) h(-1) measured in the Microcoleus mats, and 9 mumol C2H4 m(-2) h(-1) in the Lyngbya mat. Nitrogenase sequences were obtained that clustered with sequences from cyanobacteria, gamma-Proteobacteria, and cluster 3 of nifH. In addition, novel and divergent sequences were also recovered. The composition of nifH sequence types recovered differed between the Lyngbya and Microcoleus mats. Interestingly, nifH sequences belonging to filamentous cyanobacteria were absent in most mat samples even though both mats were dominated by filamentous cyanobacteria. nifH sequences clustering with those of unicellular cyanobacteria were found, some of which were virtually identical to the nifH sequence from Halothece sp. MP196P605, which had previously been isolated from the mat. In manipulation experiments, the Lyngbya and Microcoleus mats were allowed to re-colonize a cleared surface. In these developing mats, nifH sequences not previously observed in the mats were discovered. Our results showed that organisms capable of N-2 fixation were present in N-2 fixing mats, that the composition of the N-2 fixing communities differs between mats, and that filamentous cyanobacterial diazotrophs may not have a large role in the early stages of mat development.

A novel Mn-multiline EPR signal derived from the S-1 state								BIOCHEMISTRY				36	30			9261	9266		10.1021/bi962899w				JUL 29 1997	1997	The spin-1/2-carrying NO molecule interacts with both the S-1 and S-2 states of the water oxidizing complex. The intermediates of the interaction can be resolved and trapped by NO treatment at subzero temperatures. At -30 degrees C and in the presence of approx. 500-700 mu M NO, S-1 loses the ability to yield by illumination an EPR active S-2-state with an approximate half-time of 40-60 min. At longer incubation times (t(1/2) = 4-5 h), an intense new multiline signal develops. The new signal has a hyperfine splitting similar to the S-2 multiline [Dismukes, G. C., & Siderer, Y. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78, 274-278], but a modified shape with intense lines on the high field side. The NO modified S-1 state can act as a low-temperature electron donor yielding an EPR silent state upon illumination at 200 K. NO interacts also with the S-2 state of the water oxidizing complex rapidly at temperatures as low as -75 degrees C, to yield an EPR silent state. The rates of the latter interaction show analogies to the ammonia binding to the S-2 state. It is possible, however, that NO, unlike ammonia, destabilizes the S-2 state. On the basis of preliminary experiments with varying chloride concentrations in the range 0.1-50 mM, the S-1 multiline state is attributed to binding of NO at a chloride sensitive site on the Mn cluster. The rapid interactions with the S-2 state as well as the intermediate binding to the S-1 state are less well understood at present, but they are tentatively assigned to the chloride-insensitive site of ammonia binding in the Mn cluster.									19	0	0	0	12	0	19			0006-2960			WOS:A1997XN57400022	9230060

MOLECULAR BIOTECHNOLOGY				56	3			248	257		10.1007/s12033-013-9703-3				MAR 2014	2014	The aim of this study is to find Iranian tall fescue accessions that tolerate drought stress and investigation on phylogenetical, morphological, and physiological characterization of them. For this propose, inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR) markers were used to examine the genetic variability of accessions from different provinces of Iran. Of 21 primers, 20 primers generated highly reproducible fragments. Using these primers, 390 discernible DNA fragments were produced with 367 (93.95 %) being polymorphic. The polymorphic information content (PIC) values ranged from 0.948 to 0.976, with a mean PIC value of 0.969. Probability identity (PI) and discriminating power (D = 1 - PI) among the primers ranged from 0.001 to 0.004 and 0.998 to 0.995, respectively. A binary qualitative data matrix was constructed. Data analyses were performed using the NTSYS software and the similarity values were used to generate a dendrogram via UPGMA. To study the drought stress, plants were irrigated at 25 % FC condition for three times. Fresh leaves were collected to measure physiological characters including: superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidase activities and proline and total chlorophyll content at two times, before and after stress application. Relative water content, fresh and dry weight ratio, survival percentage, and visual quality were evaluated after stress. Morphological and physiological characters were assessed in order to classify accessions as either tolerant or sensitive using Ward's method of Hierarchical cluster analysis in SPSS software. The results of present study demonstrated that the ISSR markers are useful for studying tall fescue genetic diversity. Convergence of morphological and physiological characterizations during drought stress and phylogenetic relationship results showed that accessions can be grouped into four clusters; drought-tolerant accessions that collected from west of Iran, drought-tolerant accessions collected from northwest of Iran, drought semi-tolerant accessions collected from center of Iran, and drought-sensitive accessions collected from north of Iran. Data presented could be used to classify the tall fescue accessions based on suitability of cultivation in the regions studied or the regions with the similar environmental condition.									12	0	0	0	10	0	13			1073-6085	1559-0305		WOS:000331721500007	24078217

The industrial H(2)production is obtained from reforming of natural gas, which consumes a large amount of nonrenewable energy and simultaneously produces greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. Electrochemical water splitting is a promising approach for the H(2)production, which is sustainable and pollution-free. Therefore, developing efficient and economic technologies for electrochemical water splitting has been an important goal for researchers around the world. The utilization of green energy systems to reduce overall energy consumption is more important for H-2 production. Harvesting and converting energy from the environment by different green energy systems for water splitting can efficiently decrease the external power consumption. A variety of green energy systems for efficient producing H-2, such as two-electrode electrolysis of water, water splitting driven by photoelectrode devices, solar cells, thermoelectric devices, triboelectric nanogenerator, pyroelectric device or electrochemical water-gas shift device, have been developed recently. In this review, some notable progress made in the different green energy cells for water splitting is discussed in detail. We hoped this review can guide people to pay more attention to the development of green energy system to generate pollution-free H(2)energy, which will realize the whole process of H(2)production with low cost, pollution-free and energy sustainability conversion.									118	4	0	0	10	0	120			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000542803000001	34138146

Among the various catalysts employed, nitrogen doped Titanium dioxide/Reduced graphene oxide (N-TiO2/RGO) nanocomposite has been established to be a promising photocatalytic material for this purpose. However, nuances of doping nitrogen on TiO2 and the type of nitrogen (pyridinic, pyrrolic and graphitic) stabilized on RGO responsible for facilitating the H-2 production has not yet been addressed mechanistically. In the present investigation, an attempt has been made to synthesise N-Titanium dioxide/N-Reduced graphene oxide (NTNG) nanocomposite under ultrasonication followed by hydrothermal treatment. A stainlesssteel ultrasonic bath, of 6.5 L tank size (LxBxH) 300 x 150 x 150 mm, was used for ultrasonic treatments. The transducers located at the bottom of the ultrasonic bath generate a frequency of 40 kHz with maximum power of 200 W. A mechanism has been proposed including the nuances of formation and the stabilisation of each type of nitrogen on N-RGO as a function of ultrasonication time. The present work supports the stabilization of a given type of nitrogen on RGO through keto enol tautomerism. XPS and FTIR studies have been undertaken to identify the different types of nitrogen doping and the presence of functional groups respectively. XRD, UV-Vis DRS and PL investigations have been made to establish morphological profile and band gap structure of the nanocomposite. It was observed that pyrrolic type nitrogen stabilized on N-RGO augments the efficiency of photocatalytic activity through hydrogen production by water splitting.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1350-4177	1873-2828		WOS:000532044300069	31983561

J., & Nugent, J. H. A. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 9772-9780]. This signal, referred to as the S3 EPR signal, has been interpreted to arise from an S(2)X(+) species where X(+) is an amino acid radical. Investigation of the factors responsible for the formation and decay of the S3 EPR signal reveals that the yield of the S3 EPR signal is strongly temperature-dependent and depends on the rate of oxidation of Q(A)(-). Quantitation of the number of centers contributing to the S3 EPR signal produced by the optimal continuous illumination times of 3 min at 250 K, 30 s at 273 K, and 5 s at 294 K gave values of 13, 38, and 49 +/- 3%, respectively. By using 5 s of illumination at 294 K to induce the S3 EPR signal, and then illumination at 200 K to reduce Q(A), both the S3 and Q(A)(-)Fe EPR signals were induced in high yield. This result indicates that the S3 EPR signal does not arise from an acceptor-side species. When saturating laser flashes were used to induce the S3 EPR signal in a dark-prepared, dark-adapted, acetate-treated sample, the yield was small after one flash and close to maximal after two flashes. An EPR signal at g = 4.1 was observed to be formed at intermediate times during the decay of the S3 EPR signal in the dark; the rates of decay of the S3 EPR signal at 273 and 294 K corresponded to the rates of formation of the g = 4.1 EPR signal. These results, together with the flash results, indicate that two steps are involved in both the generation and decay of the S3 EPR signal. The rates of formation and decay of both the S3 and Q(A)(-)Fe EPR signals were measured at 250, 273, and 294 K. A kinetic model is presented that accounts for these kinetic data and the yield of the S3 EPR signal.									51	0	0	0	35	0	51			0006-2960			WOS:A1996TV60000030	8639678

The SA-g-C3N4 content in the films was varied from 0 to 50 wt.%. The sulfuric acid treatment introduced carboxyl and sulfonyl groups on the surface of g-C3N4, which resulted in strong hydrogen bonding with the hydroxyl groups of cellulose acetate (so strong the partial delimination of the SA-g-C3N4 occurred on CN/CA film formation via solvent casting). The obtained films were around 10 pm in thickness, extremely flexible and durable, with the SA-g-C3N4 uniformly distributed throughout the cellulose acetate network. The CN/CA films showed excellent activities for aqueous dye degradation under direct sunlight, as well as outstanding performance for photocatalytic reduction of Cr (VI). The photocatalytic activity of the CN/CA films at the optimum SA-g-C3N4 content of 50 wt.% was far higher than that of pristine SA-g-C3N4, highlighting a main advantage of the composite film fabrication strategy introduced here. Further, the CN/CA films showed excellent stability and reusability, with no loss in activity seen over 5 cycles of dye degradation.									27	1	0	0	7	0	28			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000508742700049	31624002

The genes encode FAD-, NADP- and O(2)-dependent enzymes that catalyse oxygenation of soft-nucleophilic heteroatom centres in a range of substrates. Although usually classified as xenobiotic-metabolising enzymes, examples of FMOs exist that have evolved to metabolise specific endogenous substrates as part of a discrete physiological process. The genome of Caenorhabditis elegans contains five predicted genes encoding putative homologs of mammalian FMOs, K08C7.2, K08C7.5, Y39A1A.19, F53F4.5 and H24K24.5, which we have named fmo and numbered fmo-1 to fmo-5, respectively. As a first step towards determining their functional role(s), we have experimentally characterised these C. elegans fmo genes including analysing reporter gene expression patterns and RNAi phenotypes. Two major gene expression patterns were observed, either intestinal or hypodermal, but no gross RNAi phenotypes were found possibly due to functional redundancy. The internal structures of fmo-2, fmo-3 and fmo-4 have been compared with orthologs identified in the related nematode C. briggsae. For each orthologous pair, a global comparison of the paired upstream intergenic regions was performed and a number of conserved noncoding sequences, which may represent potential cis-regulatory elements, identified. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that several of the fmo homologs are the result of gene duplication along the lineage leading to the nematodes.

J	Wu, Chenglong; Gao, Jun'e; Cao, Fang; Lu, Zhibin; Chen, Lian; Ye, Jinyun								Molecular cloning, characterization and mRNA expression of six peroxiredoxins from Black carp Mylopharyngodon piceus in response to lipopolysaccharide challenge or dietary carbohydrate								FISH & SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY				50				210	222		10.1016/j.fsi.2016.01.033				MAR 2016	2016	Peroxiredoxin (Prx) belongs to a cellular antioxidant protein family that plays important roles in innate immune function and anti-oxidative capability. In the present study, six Prxs were cloned from Black carp Mylopharyngodon piceus (MpPrx) by homology cloning and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) techniques. There were 199, 197, 250, 260, 189 and 222 amino acids in six MpPrxs, respectively. BLAST analysis reveals that MpPrxs shares high identities and similar characteristics with other known Prxs from animals. The phylogenetic analysis evidenced three major subclasses corresponding to one-Cys-Prx (MpPrx6), typical two-Cys-Prx (MpPrx1-4) and atypical 2-Cys-Prx (MpPrx5) that reflected the present hierarchy of vertebrates and invertebrates. Although six MpPrxs are constitutively expressed in all tissues, relatively higher-level mRNA expression levels of six MpPrxs can be detected in liver, eyes, heart and adipose tissues by real-time PCR assays. The transcriptional patterns of six MpPrxs mRNA in liver were detected by real-time PCR in Black carp after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge and treated with graded levels of dietary carbohydrate (CHO) (106.5, 194.3, 288.4 and 379.1 g kg(-1)), respectively. These results showed that stimulation with LPS could induce up-expression of six MpPrxs mRNA, and the variations of MpPrx4 were more sensitive than these of other MpPrxs in the liver of Black carp. Compared with those in group with 106.5 g kg(-1) dietary CHO, the expression levels of MpPrx2, MpPrx3 and MpPrx6 were significantly down-regulated while MpPrx5 were significantly induced in liver of Black carp fed with adequate dietary CHO (194.3 g kg(-1)). In addition, significant up-regulations of MpPrx2, MpPrx3 and MpPrx6 were observed in Black carp fed with excessive dietary CHO (379.1 g kg(-1)). And MpPrx4 could be constantly induced with increasing dietary CHO contents in this study. These results indicated that MpPrxs were constitutive and inducible proteins and might play important roles in innate immune function after LPS challenge and regulating redox homeostasis in the metabolism of dietary CHO.

Octopus tetricus, a commercially important species, has undergone a recent polewards range shift in the coastal waters of south-eastern Australia, thought to be associated with the southerly extension of the warm East Australian Current. At the cooler temperatures of a polewards distribution limit, growth of a species could be slower, potentially leading to a bigger body size and resulting in a slower population turnover, affecting population viability at the extreme of the distribution. Growth rates, body size, and life span of O. tetricus were examined at the leading edge of a polewards range shift in Tasmanian waters (40 degrees S and 147 degrees E) throughout 2011. Octopus tetricus had a relatively small body size and short lifespan of approximately 11 months that, despite cooler temperatures, would allow a high rate of population turnover and may facilitate the population increase necessary for successful establishment in the new extended area of the range. Temperature, food availability and gender appear to influence growth rate. Individuals that hatched during cooler and more productive conditions, but grew during warming conditions, exhibited faster growth rates and reached smaller body sizes than individuals that hatched into warmer waters but grew during cooling conditions. This study suggests that fast growth, small body size and associated rapid population turnover may facilitate the range shift of O. tetricus into Tasmanian waters.									438	9	4	0	305	78	488			1932-6203			WOS:000339812700029	24763332

Eureka), a chilling-sensitive plant, during 5-day dark-chilling at 1 degrees C and subsequent 3-h photoactivation under white light (200 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) at 22 degrees C. Although, no change in chlorophyll (Chl) content and Chl a/b ratio in all samples was observed, overall fluorescence intensity of fluorescence emission and excitation spectra of thylakoid membranes isolated from dark-chilled leaves decreased to about 50%, and remained after photoactivation at 70% of that of the control sample. Concomitantly, the ratio between fluorescence intensities of PSI and PSII (F736/ F681) at 120 K increased 1.5-fold upon chilling, and was fully reversed after photoactivation. Moreover, chilling stress seems to induce a decrease of the relative contribution of LHCII fluorescence to the thylakoid emission spectra at 120 K, and an increase of that from LHCI and PSI, correlated with a decrease of stability of LHCI-PSI and LHCII trimers, shown by mild-denaturing electrophoresis. These effects were reversed to a large extent after photoactivation, with the exception of LHCII, which remained partly in the aggregated form. In view of these data, it is likely that dark-chilling stress induces partial disassembly of CP complexes, not completely restorable upon photoactivation. These data are further supported by confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy, which showed that regular grana arrangement observed in chloroplasts isolated from control leaves was destroyed by dark-chilling stress, and was partially reconstructed after photoactivation. In line with this, Chl a fluorescence spectra of leaf discs demonstrated that dark-chilling caused a decrease of the quantum yield PSII photochemistry (F-v/F-m) by almost 40% in 5 days. Complete restoration of the photochemical activity of PSII required 9 h post-chilling photoactivation, while only 3 h were needed to reconstruct thylakoid membrane organization and chloroplast structure. The latter demonstrated that the long-term dark-chilled bean leaves started to suffer from photoinhibition after transfer to moderate irradiance and temperature conditions, delaying the recovery of PSII photochemistry, independently of photo-induced reconstruction of PSII complexes.

Densities of cardiac I (Ca) and I (Na) and their acute heat tolerance were measured in winter-acclimatized (WiR) and summer-acclimatized (SuR) fish maintained in the laboratory at 4 +/- 1 and 18 +/- 1 A degrees C, respectively. A robust L-type Ca2+ current (I (CaL)), but no T-type Ca2+ current, was present in roach atrial and ventricular myocytes. Peak density of I (CaL) was smaller in atrial (- 1.97 +/- 0.14 and - 1.75 +/- 0.19 pA/pF for WiR and SuR, respectively) than ventricular myocytes (- 4.00 +/- 0.59 and - 2.88 +/- 0.47 pA/pF for WiR and SuR, respectively) (p < 0.05), but current density and heat tolerance of I (CaL) did not change between seasons in either cell type. In contrast to I (Ca), marked differences appeared in I (Na) between WiR and SuR. I (Na) density was 38% higher in WiR than SuR atrial myocytes (- 80.03 +/- 5.92 vs. - 49.77 +/- 4.72 pA/pF; p < 0.05) and 48% higher in WiR than SuR ventricular myocytes (- 39.25 +/- 3.06 vs. - 20.03 +/- 1.79 pA/pF; p < 0.05). The winter increase in I (Na) density was associated with 55% (1.70 +/- 0.27 vs. 0.77 +/- 0.12) and 54% (1.08 +/- 0.19 vs. 0.50 +/- 0.10) up-regulation of the total Na+ channel (scn4 + scn5 + scn8) transcripts in atrium and ventricle, respectively (p < 0.05). Heat tolerance of atrial I (Na) was lower in WiR with a breakpoint temperature of 20.3 +/- 1.2 A degrees C than in SuR (23.8 +/- 0.7 A degrees C) (p < 0.05). The response of I (Na) to seasonal acclimatization conforms to the TDEE hypothesis. The lower heat tolerance of I (Na) in WiR is consistent with the lower heat tolerance of in vivo heart rate in WiR in comparison to SuR, but the match is not quantitatively perfect, suggesting that other factors in addition to I (Na) may be involved.									8	0	0	0	8	0	8			0174-1578	1432-136X		WOS:000426468000005	28942482	
J	Anderson, RS; Beaven, AE								A comparative study of anti-Perkinsus marinus activity in bivalve sera								JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH				20	3			1011	1017						DEC 2001	2001	The eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica has been decimated by a protistan parasite Perkinsus marinus., however, other bivalves appear to be more resistant to this pathogen. To better understand the basis for this difference in susceptibility. a comparative study of the activities of anti-P. marinus serum proteins of several bivalve species was carried out. Sera from mussels not known to develop P. marinus disease, Mytilus edulis and Geukensia demissa, contained high anti-P. marinus activity, About 25% of M. edulis serum samples contained <10 kDa anti-P. marinus peptides; the possibility of seasonal. geographic, or other reasons to explain this variability requires additional study. Anti-P. marinus peptides in G. demissa serum were apparently absent. Measurable anti-P. marinus activity was present in C. virginica and C. gigas sera, but at levels many hundred-fold lower than that of the mussels. The greater P. marinus resistance of C. gigas vs. C. virginica could not be explained by differences in anti-P. marinus activity of their sera. Hemocyte lysates from all the bivalves examined produced marked inhibition of the growth of P. marinus, suggesting that antimicrobial agents may be secreted by hemocytes into the serum, These factors may also participate in intracellular destruction of P. marinus. since the killing ability of the hemocytes of the different species closely mirrored the anti-P. marinus activities of their sera. The data suggest that C. virginica lacks active anti-P. marinus serum agents typical of M. edulis and G. demissa; however. P. marinus resistance of C. gigas seems not to depend upon elevated levels of antimicrobial serum factors.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0730-8000			WOS:000174127300013		
J	AHRLING, KA; PACE, RJ				Pace, Ronald J/T-5906-2017				SIMULATION OF THE S-2 STATE MULTILINE ELECTRON-PARAMAGNETIC-RESONANCE SIGNAL OF PHOTOSYSTEM-II - A MULTIFREQUENCY APPROACH								BIOPHYSICAL JOURNAL				68	5			2081	2090		10.1016/S0006-3495(95)80387-5				MAY 1995	1995	The S-2 state electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) multiline signal of Photosystem II has been simulated at Q-band (35 Ghz), X-band (9 GHz) and S-band (4 GHz) frequencies. The model used for the simulation assumes that the signal arises from an essentially magnetically isolated Mn-III-Mn-IV dimer, with a ground state electronic spin S-T = 1/2. The spectra are generated from exact numerical solution of a general spin Hamiltonian containing anisotropic hyperfine and quadrupolar interactions at both Mn nuclei. The features that distinguish the multiline from the EPR spectra of model manganese dimer complexes (additional width of the spectrum (195 mT), additional peaks (22), internal ''superhyperfine'' structure) are plausibly explained assuming an unusual ligand geometry at both Mn nuclei, giving rise to normally forbidden transitions from quadrupole interactions as well as hyperfine anisotropy. The fitted parameters indicate that the hyperfine and quadrupole interactions arise from Mn ions in low symmetry environments, corresponding approximately to the removal of one ligand from an octahedral geometry in both cases. For a quadrupole interaction of the magnitude indicated here to be present, the Mn-III ion must be 5-coordinate and the Mn-IV 5-coordinate or possibly have a sixth, weakly bound ligand. The hyperfine parameters indicate a quasi-axial anisotropy at Mn-III, which while consistent with Jahn-Teller distortion as expected for a d(4) ion, corresponds here to the unpaired spin being in the ligand deficient, z direction of the molecular reference axis. The fitted parameters for Mn-IV are very unusual, showing a high degree of anisotropy not expected in a d(3) ion. This degree of anisotropy could be qualitatively accounted for by a histidine ligand providing pi backbonding into the metal d(xy) orbital, together with a weakly bound or absent ligand in the x direction.									55	0	0	0	29	0	55			0006-3495			WOS:A1995RH65800048	7612851

Here, two catalase cDNAs (ChCat-1 and ChCat-2) were isolated from hemocytes of Crassostrea hongkongensis using SSH and RACE. The full-length cDNAs of ChCat-1 and ChCat-2 are 1913 and 2466 bp in length, encoding proteins of 515 and 511 amino acids, respectively. Multiple alignments of amino acid sequences revealed that both ChCat-1 and ChCat-2 possess several characteristic features of the catalase family of enzymes, including one proximal active site signature, one heme-ligand signature, and three catalytic amino acid residues (His(72), Asn(145) and Tyr(355)). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that these two catalases may share a common ancestral gene and result from a gene duplication event following the divergence of bivalves and gastropods. Constitutive expression of ChCat-1 and ChCat-2 was observed in all tissues studied, with highest levels of expression in gill and muscle, respectively. The expression of both genes was inducible by bacterial infection, and reached the maximum at 8 h (9.0-fold) and 12 h (2.3-fold) post-infection, respectively. Furthermore, both the purified ChCat-1 and ChCat-2 protein displayed a strong catalase activity, and S2 cells carrying ChCat-1 or ChCat-2 showed a higher degree of resistance to H(2)O(2) than that of control cells. In a word, this is the first report of the presence of two catalase genes in a single marine bivalve, and our results highlight the involvement of both ChCat-1 and ChCat-2 in host protection against pathogen infection and oxidative stress in C. hongkongensis.

J	Zhu, Meilin; Bin, Jing; Ding, Huifen; Pan, Duo; Tian, Qingyin; Yang, Xiulian; Wang, Lianggui; Yue, Yuanzheng								Insights into the trihelix transcription factor responses to salt and other stresses in Osmanthus fragrans								BMC GENOMICS				23	1					334	10.1186/s12864-022-08569-7				APR 30 2022	2022	Background: Osmanthus fragrans is an evergreen plant with high ornamental and economic values. However, they are easily injured by salt stress, which severely limits their use in high salinity areas. The trihelix transcription factor (TF) family, as one of the earliest discovered TF families in plants, plays an essential part in responses to different abiotic stresses, and it has potential functions in improving the salt-tolerance capability of O. fragrans.Results: In this study, 56 trihelix genes (OfGTs) were first identified in O. fragrans and then divided into five sub' families in accordance with a phylogenetic tree analysis. The OfGTs were found to be located randomly on the 20 O. fragrans chromosomes, and an analysis of gene replication events indicated that the OfGT gene family underwent strong purification selection during the evolutionary process. The analysis of conserved motifs and gene structures implied that the OfGT members in the same subfamily have similar conserved motifs and gene structures. A promoter cis-elements analysis showed that all the OfGT genes contained multiple abiotic and hormonal stress-related cis-elements. The RNA-seq data suggested that the OfGTs have specific expression patterns in different tissues, and some were induced by salt stress. The qRT-PCR analysis of 12 selected OfGTs confirmed that OfGT1/3/21/33/42/45/46/52 were induced, with OfGT3/42/46 being the most highly expressed. In addition, OfGT42/OfGT46 had a co-expression pattern under salt-stress conditions. OfGT3/42/46 were mainly localized in the nuclei and exhibited no transcriptional activities based on the analysis of the subcellular localization and transcriptional activity assay. Furthermore, the expression levels of most of the selected OfGTs were induced by multiple abiotic and hormonal stresses, and the expression patterns of some OfGTs were also highly correlated with gibberellic acid and methyl jasmonate levels. Remarkably, the transient transformation results showed lower MDA content and increased expression of ROS-related genes NbAPX in transgenic plants, which implying OfGT3/42/46 may improve the salt tolerance of tobacco.Conclusions: The results implied that the OfGT genes were related to abiotic and hormonal stress responses in O. fragrans, and that the OfGT3/42/46 genes in particular might play crucial roles in responses to salt stress. This study made a comprehensive summary of the OfGT gene family, including functions and co-expression patterns in response to salt and other stresses, as well as an evolutionary perspective. Consequently, it lays a foundation for further functional characterizations of these genes.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1471-2164			WOS:000788957300001	35488201

In this work, a novel nanoarchitecture of Co-based metal-organic frameworks (Co-MOF) and terephthalonitrile-based covalent organic framework (TPN-COF) was synthesized (represented by Co-MOF@TPN-COF), followed by the exploitation as the bioplatform of non-label aptasensor for detecting the most frequently used beta-lactam antibiotics, ampicillin (AMP). The new porous hybrid material of Co-MOF@TPN-COF was synthesized by adding the as-prepared TPN-COF into the Co-MOF preparation system. The multilayered Co-MOF@TPN-COF nanosheets exhibit a high specific surface area (52.64 m(2) g(-1)), nitrogen-rich groups and excellent electrochemical activity. As a result, large amounts of aptamer strands can be bound over the Co-MOF@TPN-COF nanosheets owning to the strong n-ic stacking and hydrogen bonds. When detecting AMP by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, the fabricated Co-MOF@TPN-COF-based aptasensor exhibits an ultra-low detection limit of 0.217 fg(-1) within the AMP concentration from 1.0 fg(-1) to 2.0 ng(-1), which was superior to those previously reported in literatures. In addition, this proposed aptasensor also shows high selectivity, good reproducibility and stability, acceptable regenerability, and favorable applicability in human serum, river water and milk. Therefore, the proposed Co-MOF@TPN-COF-based aptasensor has a great promise to be applied as a powerful tool in the fields of food safety.									106	3	0	0	25	0	107			0956-5663	1873-4235		WOS:000450376600009	30312876

ESTIMATION OF RELATIVE MIDPOINT REDOX POTENTIALS								BIOCHEMISTRY				30	3			830	839		10.1021/bi00217a037				JAN 22 1991	1991	The effect of protonation events on the charge equilibrium between tyrosine-D and the water-oxidizing complex in photosystem II has been studied by time-resolved measurements of the EPR signal II(slow) at room temperature. The flash-induced oxidation of Y(D) by the water-oxidizing complex in the S2 state is a monophasic process above pH 6.5 and biphasic at lower pHs, showing a slow and a fast phase. The half-time of the slow phase increases from about 1 s at pH 8.0 to about 20 s at pH 5.0, whereas the half-time of the fast phase is pH independent (0.4-1 s). The dark reduction of Y(D)+ was followed by measuring the decay of signal II(slow) at room temperature. Y(D)+ decays in a biphasic way on the tens of minutes to hours time scale. The minutes phase is due to the electron transfer to Y(D)+ from the S0 state of the water-oxidizing complex. The half-time of this process increases from about 5 min at pH 8.0 to 40 min at pH 4.5. The hours phase of Y(D)+ has a constant half-time of about 500 min between pH 4.7 and 7.2, which abruptly decreases above pH 7.2 and below pH 4.7. This phase reflects the reduction of Y(D)+ either from the medium or by an unidentified redox component of PSII in those centers that are in the S1 state. The titration curve of the half-times for the oxidation of Y(D) reveals a proton binding with a pK around 7.3-7.5 that retards the electron transfer from Y(D) to the water-oxidizing complex. We propose that this monoprotic event reflects the protonation of an amino acid residue, probably histidine-190 on the D2 protein, to which Y(D) is hydrogen bonded. The titration curves for the oxidation of Y(D) and for the reduction of Y(D)+ show a second proton binding with pK almost-equal-to 5.8-6.0 that accelerates the electron transfer from Y(D) to the water-oxidizing complex and retards the process in the opposite direction. This protonation most probably affects the water-oxidizing complex. From the measured kinetic parameters, the lowest limits for the equilibrium constants between the S0Y(D)+ and the S1Y(D) as well as between the S1Y(D)+ and S2Y(D) states were estimated to be 5 and 750-1000, respectively. These equilibrium constants permitted us to derive a relative redox potential scheme showing that the S1/S0 redox couple of the water-oxidizing complex is at least 40 mV more negative than the Y(D)+/Y(D) couple and the latter is at least 170 mV more negative than the S2/S1 redox couple of the water-oxidizing complex. Together with available data in the literature, these estimations place the Y(D)+/Y(D) couple at approximately 720-760 mV.									272	3	1	0	197	1	276			0006-2960			WOS:A1991EU20500037	1988070

This EPR signal arises from a reciprocal interaction between the spin 1/2 ground state of the S-2 stale of the Mns cluster, for which a multiline EPR signal with shifted Mn-55 hyperfine peaks is observed, and the oxidized tyrosine residue, Y-Z(.), for which a broadened Y-Z(.) EPR spectrum is observed. The S2YZ. EPR signal in acetate-inhibited PSII is the first in which characteristic spectral features from both paramagnets can be observed. The observation of distinct EPR signals from each of the paramagnets together with the lack of a half-field EPR transition indicates that the exchange and dipolar couplings are weak. Below 20 K, the S2YZ. EPR signal in acetate-inhibited PSII is in the static limit. Above 20 K, the line width narrows dramatically as the broad low-temperature S2YZ. EPR signal is converted to a narrow Y-Z(.) EPR signal at room temperature. The line width narrowing is interpreted to be due to averaging of the exchange and dipolar interactions between Y-Z(.) and the S-2 state of the Mn-4 cluster by rapid spin-lattice relaxation of the Mn-4 cluster as the temperature is increased. Decay of the S2YZ. intermediate at 200 K shows that the g = 4.1 form of the S-2 slate is formed and that a noninteracting S-2-state multiline EPR signal is not observed as an intermediate in the decay. This result shows that a change in die redox state of Y-Z induces a spin state change in the Mn-4 cluster in acetate-inhibited PSII. The interconversion between spin slates of the Mn-4 cluster in acetate-inhibited PSII supports the idea that Y-Z oxidation or Y-Z(.) reduction is communicated to the Mn-4 cluster through a direct hydrogen-bonding pathway, possibly involving a ligand bound to the Mn-4 cluster.									54	1	0	0	34	0	55			0006-2960			WOS:000076367900018	9753446

GSTs play a significant role in cellular defense against toxicity and have been identified in nearly all organisms studied to date, from bacteria to mammals. In this study, we have identified a full-length cDNA of the theta class GST from Ruditapes philippinarum (RpGST theta), an important commercial edible molluscan species. RpGST theta was cloned and the recombinant protein expressed, in order to study its biochemical characteristics and determine its physiological activities. The cDNA comprised an ORF of 693 bp, encoding 231 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 27 kDa and an isoelectric point of 8.2. Sequence analysis revealed that RpGST theta possessed characteristic conserved domains of the GST_N family, Class Theta subfamily (PSSM: cd03050) and GST_C_family Super family (PSSM: cl02776). Phylogenetic analysis showed that RpGST theta evolutionarily linked with other theta class homologues. The recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells and the purified enzyme showed high activity with GST substrates like CDNB and 4-NBC. Glutathione dependent peroxidase activity of GST, investigated with cumene hydroperoxide as substrate affirmed the antioxidant property of rRpGST theta. By quantitative PCR, RpGST theta was found to be ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined, with the highest levels occurring in gills, mantle, and hemocytes. Since GSTs may act as detoxification enzymes to mediate immune defense, the effects of pathogen associated molecular pattern, lipopolysaccharide and intact Vibrio tapetis bacteria challenge on RpGST theta gene transcription were studied. Furthermore, the RpGST theta expression changes induced by immune challenges were similar to those of the antioxidant defense enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (RpMnSOD).

Shikonin and its analogues have been reported to induce cell-cycle arrest, but target information is still unclear. We hypothesized that shikonin, with a structure similar to that of quinone-type compounds, which are inhibitors of cell division cycle 25 (Cdc25) phosphatases, will have similar effects on Cdc25s. To test this hypothesis, the effects of shikonin on Cdc25s and cell-cycle progression were determined in this paper.MethodsThe in vitro effects of shikonin and its analogues on Cdc25s were detected by fluorometric assay kit. The binding mode between shikonin and Cdc25B was modelled by molecular docking. The dephosphorylating level of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), a natural substrate of Cdc25B, was tested by Western blotting. The effect of shikonin on cell cycle progression was investigated by flow cytometry analysis. We also tested the anti-proliferation activity of shikonin on cancer cell lines by MTT assay. Moreover, in vivo anti-proliferation activity was tested in a mouse xenograft tumour model.ResultsShikonin and its analogues inhibited recombinant human Cdc25 A, B, and C phosphatase with IC50 values ranging from 2.140.21 to 13.45 +/- 1.45M irreversibly. The molecular modelling results showed that shikonin bound to the inhibitor binding pocket of Cdc25B with a favourable binding mode through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. In addition, an accumulation of the tyrosine 15-phosphorylated form of CDK1 was induced by shikonin in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo. We also confirmed that shikonin showed an anti-proliferation effect on three cancer cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 6.15 +/- 0.46 to 9.56 +/- 1.03M. Furthermore, shikonin showed a promising anti-proliferation effect on a K562 mouse xenograph tumour model.ConclusionIn this study, we provide evidence for how shikonin induces cell cycle arrest and functions as a Cdc25s inhibitor. It shows an anti-proliferation effect both in vitro and in vivo by mediating Cdc25s.									21	3	0	0	18	1	24			1471-2407			WOS:000455094200005	30616572

Heme oxygenase 1 (HO1), a cytoprotective enzyme, is usually upregulated to alleviate oxidative stress in vivo. The function of teleost HO1 in the response to oxidative stress induced by heavy metal exposure and in pathogenic bacterial infection remains uncertain. In the present study, both complementary DNA and genomic sequence of a HO1-like gene cloned from the liver of swamp eel (Monopterus albus) are reported. Sequence analysis showed that the putative amino acid sequence contained a conserved heme oxygenase signature and displayed higher similarity to HO1 genes of other teleosts. Expression profile of swamp eel HO1 was investigated in healthy tissues and in tissues following stimulation with pathogenic bacteria (Aeromonas hydrophila) or cadmium chloride (CdCl2) exposure. Results demonstrated that HO1 messenger RNA (mRNA) was highly expressed in the liver and relatively less in other tissues. Bacterial infection withA. hydrophilasignificantly changed HO1 mRNA expression in the liver, spleen, and kidney, and the mRNA expression of HO1 and Nrf2 in the liver was elevated after the fish were exposed to CdCl2. Subsequently, the swamp eel HO1 was subcloned into a pET28a expression vector and transformed intoEscherichia coliBL21 (DE3). Recombinant HO1 (rHO1) was successfully induced by 0.1 mmol/l IPTG and purified by Ni-NTA His Bind Resin purification system. To determine whether the rHO1 could confer stress tolerance in vitro, the viability of control and HO1-expressingE. coliunder CdCl(2)stress was compared by spot assay. The rHO1 protein significantly increased survival rates of the bacterial hosts. To evaluate whether intraperitoneal injection with rHO1 protected the liver of swamp eel againstA. hydrophila-induced oxidative stress, mRNA expression of HO1, Nrf2, hepcidin, and IL-1 beta as well as the oxidative stress-related parameters (ROS and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC)) in the liver were examined. The results showed that exogenous rHO1 could significantly upgrade the mRNA expression of HO1 and hepcidin, coupled with increased ROS and T-AOC levels. However, Nrf2 and IL-1 beta expression levels were significantly downregulated and upregulated, respectively. These results suggested that HO1 should not only play a protective role in oxidative stress response and its adverse effects deserved further investigation.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			0920-1742	1573-5168		WOS:000547795400001	32656613

GRAS转录因子是调控植物生长发育和非生物胁迫响应的重要转录因子之一,而目前还没有GRAS调控高温胁迫的研究。为了深入研究番茄SlGRAS4生物功能,以耐热番茄LA2093为试验材料,分析番茄SlGRAS4基因结构、启动子序列及进化关系,利用qRT-PCR检测SlGRAS4在不同胁迫和不同激素处理下的表达水平,利用VIGS验证SlGRAS4基因耐热功能。结果表明:(1)生物信息学分析显示,SlGRAS4蛋白长度为666aa,分子量为75 737.72Da,理论等电点为6.31,含有GRAS转录因子家族典型的结构域,主要集中在C末端的277~657aa之间;在SlGRAS4启动子区域发现脱落酸(ABA)和水杨酸(SA)响应元件;SlGRAS4与烟草NtGRAS1蛋白亲缘关系最近,推测SlGRAS4可能与其同源基因具有相似的生物功能。(2)在高温、低温、盐和干旱胁迫处理12h时番茄SlGRAS4基因表达量升至最高,分别增加到对照的8.86、4.86、55.38和7.63倍;在ABA和SA激素处理8h时SlGRAS4基因的表达量达到峰值,分别达到对照的120.72和3.55倍,说明SlGRAS4可能参与了多种非生物胁迫响应和激素信号传导。(3)沉默SlGRAS4基因番茄植株(VSlGRAS4)在高温胁迫下较对照植株(Ve)更容易萎蔫,且F_v/F_m与SOD、POD活性显著降低,REL和H_2O_2含量显著升高,说明在高温胁迫下沉默SlGRAS4使番茄植株细胞膜氧化损伤加重,光合能力降低,活性氧(ROS)清除酶活性减弱。(4)qRT-PCR分析显示,VSlGRAS4植株中高温信号应答关键基因HsfA1b、ROS信号应答基因ZAT10和ZAT12以及ROS清除酶编码基因CuZn- SOD、FeSOD、APX1、APX2、CAT的表达水平均显著低于Ve植株,表明SlGRAS4转录因子可以通过调控高温和ROS信号转导来影响番茄的耐热性。研究认为,高温、低温、干旱、盐、ABA和SA均可显著诱导番茄SlGRAS4基因的表达,沉默SlGRAS4基因番茄植株的耐热性显著降低,证明番茄SlGRAS4基因具有耐热功能,为进一步解析SlGRAS4参与番茄耐热调控的分子机制奠定基础。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1000-4025			CSCD:6966639

All isolates were identified as Campylobacter based on generic PCR and grouped with other Campylobacter species based on 23S rRNA gene sequence. None of the isolates could be identified by species-specific PCR for known taxa, and all ten isolates formed a robust clade that was very distinct from known Campylobacter species based on 16S rRNA, rpoB and cpn60 gene sequences. The results of 16S rRNA gene nucleoticle sequence (<= 92 % sequence similarity to recognized Campylobacter species) and genomic DNA (no detectable relatedness) analyses were consistent with novel species status. Cells of the Campylobacter from whooping cranes were uniflagellar and typically sigmoid to allantoid in shape (0.48 mu m wide and 2.61 mu m long), but also spheroid to coccoid (0.59 mu m wide and 0.73 pm long). The bacterium was oxidase-positive, able to reduce nitrite, able to grow at 37 degrees and 42 degrees C, and grew anaerobically, as well as in an atmosphere devoid of H-2, and on MacConkey agar. It was not alpha-haemolytic and was negative for hippurate and indoxyl acetate hydrolysis and alkaline phosphatase. It also was susceptible to cephalotin and was unable to grow on nutrient agar, on a medium containing 3.5% NaCl or in ambient O-2. The bacterium was unable to grow at 25 degrees C and growth was negative or very restricted at 30 degrees C. Fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis indicated that nine of the recovered isolates were genetically distinct. A species-specific primer set targeting the cpn60 gene was developed. The name Campylobacter canadensis sp. nov. is proposed for the novel species, with the type strain L266(T) (=CCUG 54429(T) =LMG 24001(T)).									27	0	0	0	24	0	27			1466-5026	1466-5034		WOS:000251432900035	17978232	
J	Volland, Stefanie; Bayer, Elisabeth; Baumgartner, Verena; Andosch, Ancuela; Luetz, Cornelius; Sima, Evelyn; Luetz-Meindl, Ursula								Rescue of heavy metal effects on cell physiology of the algal model system Micrasterias by divalent ions								JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY				171	2			154	163		10.1016/j.jplph.2013.10.002				JAN 15 2014	2014	Recent studies have shown that metals such as copper, zinc, aluminum, cadmium, chromium, iron and lead cause severe dose-dependent disturbances in growth, morphogenesis, photosynthetic and respiratory activity as well as on ultrastructure and function of organelles in the algal model system Micrasterias denticulata (Volland et al., 2011, 2012; Andosch et al., 2012). In the present investigation we focus on amelioration of these adverse effects of cadmium, chromium and lead by supplying the cells with different antioxidants and essential micronutrients to obtain insight into metal uptake mechanisms and subcellular metal targets. This seems particularly interesting as Micrasterias is adapted to extremely low-concentrated, oligotrophic conditions in its natural bog environment.The divalent ions of iron, zinc and calcium were able to diminish the effects of the metals cadmium, chromium and lead on Micrasterias. Iron showed most ameliorating effects on cadmium and chromium in short- and long-term treatments and improved cell morphogenesis, ultrastructure, cell division rates and photosynthesis. Analytical transmission electron microscopic (TEM) methods (electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and electron spectroscopic imaging (ESI)) revealed that chromium uptake was decreased when Micrasterias cells were pre-treated with iron, which resulted in no longer detectable intracellular chromium accumulations. Zinc rescued the detrimental effects of chromium on net-photosynthesis, respiration rates and electron transport in PS II. Calcium and gadolinium were able to almost completely compensate the inhibiting effects of lead and cadmium on cell morphogenesis after mitosis, respectively. These results indicate that cadmium is taken up by calcium and iron transporters, whereas chromium appears to enter the algae cells via iron and zinc carriers. It was shown that lead is not taken up into Micrasterias at all but exerts its adverse effects on cell growth by substituting cell wall bound calcium. The antioxidants salicylic acid, ascorbic acid and glutathione were not able to ameliorate any of the investigated metal effects on the green alga Micrasterias when added to the culture medium.

J	Boussac, A; Un, S; Horner, O; Rutherford, AW				Rutherford, Alfred W/A-7831-2019	Rutherford, Alfred W/0000-0002-3124-154X			High-spin states (S >= 5/2) of the photosystem II manganese complex								BIOCHEMISTRY				37	12			4001	4007		10.1021/bi9728710				MAR 24 1998	1998	The Mn-4 complex which is involved in water oxidation in photosystem II (PSII) is known to exhibit two types of EPR signals in the S-2 state, one of the five redox states of the enzyme cycle: either a multiline signal (S = 1/2) or a signal at g = 4.1 (S = 3/2 or S = 5/2), The S = 1/2 state can be converted to that responsible for the g = 4.1 signal upon the absorption of near-infrared (IR) light [Boussac, A., Girerd, J.-J., and Rutherford, A. W. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 6984-6989]. It is shown here that a third state gives rise to signals at g = 10 and 6. This state is formed by LR illumination of the S = 1/2 state at 65 K, a temperature where LR illumination leads to the loss of the S = 1/2 signal but to no formation of the g = 4.1 state. On the basis of the corresponding decrease of the S = 1/2 state, the new state can be trapped in similar to 40% of the PSII centers. Wanning of the sample above 65 K, in the dark, leads to the loss of the g = 10 and 6 resonances with the corresponding appearance of the g = 4.1 signal. It is suggested that the IR-induced conversion of the S = 1/2 state into the g = 4.1 state at 150 K involves the transient formation of the new state, The new state is attributed to a S = 5/2 State of the Mn-4 complex (although a S value > 5/2 is also a possibility). Spectral simulations indicate an E/D ratio of -0.05 with \D\ less than or equal to 1 cm(-1). The resonances at g = 10 and 6 correspond to the g(z) of the +/-5/2 and +/-3/2 transition, respectively. The temperature-dependent conversion of this S = 5/2 State into the g = 4.1 state is proposed to be due to relaxation of the ligand environment around the Mn-4 cluster that leads to a change in the zero field splitting parameters, assuming an S = 5/2 value for the g = 4.1 state. The new form of the S-2 state reported here may explain some earlier data where the S-2 State was present and yet not detectable as either a S = 1/2 or a g = 4.1 EPR signal.									96	0	0	0	54	0	96			0006-2960			WOS:000072916600001	9565450	
J	Fan, Wenyan; Li, Guilin; Zhang, Xuemei; Wang, Ying; Wang, Chen; Xu, Baohua; Guo, Xingqi; Li, Han								The role of melatonin and Tryptophan-5-hydroxylase-1 in different abiotic stressors in Apis cerana cerana								JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY				128						104180	10.1016/j.jinsphys.2020.104180				JAN 2021	2021	Tryptophan-5-hydroxylase-1 (T5H-1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of semtonin, which is involved in the biosynthesis of melatonin (Mel). Mel, a biological hormone, plays crucial roles in stressors tolerance, such as cold, hot, Ultraviolet (UV) and pesticide tolerance. However, the direct correlation between T5H-1 and Mel and the underlying mechanism in organisms remains elusive. Mel-mediated cold tolerance was studied extensively in plants and somewhat in insects, including bees. The present study isolated the Mel synthesis gene T5H-1 from Apis cerana cerana for the first time. qRT-PCR analysis indicated that AccT5H-1 played vital roles during some adverse conditions, including 4 degrees C, 8 degrees C, 10 degrees C, 45 degrees C, UV, cyhalothrin, abamectin, paraquat and bifenthrin exposure. Knockdown of AccT5H-1 using RNA interference (RNAi) technology upregulated most antioxidant genes. Additionally, an enzyme activity assay revealed higher contents of Malondialdehyde (MDA) and Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), lower content of Vitamin C (VC), and higher activities of Glutathione S-transferase (GST), Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT) and Peroxidase (POD) in the AccT5H-1 silenced group than the control group. These results suggest that AccT5H-1 is involved in the response to different oxidative stressors in A. cerana cerana. The survival rate of A. cerana cerana exposed to low temperature treatment revealed that the optimal concentration of Mel in the diet was 10 mu g/mL. We also found that the antioxidant enzyme (GST, SOD, POD and CAT) concentrations at 10 mu g/mL Mel increased to different degrees, and the content of oxidizing substances (MDA and H2O2) decreased, the content of VC increased, and the content of substances that promote cold resistance (glycerol and glycogen) increased. Mel increased the resistance of A. cerana cerana exposed to low temperatures. The expression of AccT5H-1 decreased after the feeding of exogenous Mel to bees. These results provide a reference for other insect studies on Mel and T5H-1.									7	0	0	0	4	0	7			0022-1910	1879-1611		WOS:000605762300010	33309689

First, the F-v intensity reflects accurately the changes in the number of open photochemical centers in PSII. Secondly, the use of F-v in combination with FT-IR spectroscopy can disclose structure-function correlations in the heat inactivation of the PSII complex. Analysis of the midpoint temperatures of thermal denaturation, i.e., 50% inactivation, reported so far in investigations of the thylakoid membrane components has revealed that most of the thermal transitions attributed to PSII are in the 39-46 degrees C range. In this work, it is shown specifically that the midpoint temperature of PSII inactivation is at about 40 degrees C. Moreover, it was clearly demonstrated that the heat-induced changes above 40 degrees C are the result of a marked decrease in the number of open photochemical centers in PSII. It was also seen that above this same temperature the loss of photochemical centers has its structural counterpart in overall modifications of the secondary structures of the PSII proteins resulting from the decrease in the alpha-helix content concomitant with the increase in extended chain (beta-strand) conformations. In brief, a novel finding reported here is that the number of open photochemical centers in PSII is dependent on a dynamic equilibrium between the contents of the PSII proteins in alpha-helix and extended chains (beta-strands), but not in beta-sheets and beta-turn structures except for the antiparallel-beta-sheet conformations. This therefore associates the thermal inactivation of the photochemical centers in photosystem II with distinct conformational changes in the proteins of the PSII supramolecular complex. In the particular context of the present study, these findings constitute a significant contribution to the investigation of structure-function correlations in the photosynthetic membrane. In a broader context, this information might be essential for the comprehension of the molecular arrangements or local structure order that are involved directly or indirectly in biological catalysis.									6	0	0	0	5	0	6			0939-5075			WOS:000078985000006	10097406
