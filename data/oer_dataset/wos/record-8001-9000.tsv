In this regard, we report facile synthesis of a phase pure face centered cubic (FCC) nickel electrocatalyst in nitrogen doped graphene nanotube (NGT) of diameter similar to 100 nm. The single step in-situ synthesis of Ni-NGT synthesized by pyrolysis is cost effective and the bifunctional catalytic activity that can compete with the state-of-the-art Pt-C and RuO2 catalyst for HER and OER, respectively. The enhanced catalytic activity can be attributed to the synergistic effect of Ni active centers, defect sites due to N-doping and the conducting NGT support.					64th DAE Solid State Physics Symposium (DAE-SSPS)64th DAE Solid State Physics Symposium (DAE-SSPS)	DEC 18-22, 2019DEC 18-22, 2019	Bhabha Atom Res Ctr; Govt India, Dept Atom Energy; Dept Atom Energy; Board Res Nucl SciBhabha Atom Res Ctr; Govt India, Dept Atom Energy; Dept Atom Energy; Board Res Nucl Sci	Indian inst Technol Jodhpur, Jodhpur, INDIAIndian inst Technol Jodhpur, Jodhpur, INDIA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0094-243X		978-0-7354-2025-0	WOS:000656356900542

Green electricity-driven alkaline water electrolysis requires that highly-efficient electrocatalysts be developed to further decrease the barriers of two half reactions - the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Various strategies have been exploited to date, among which atomic heterointerface engineering is the most promising strategy to overcome the intrinsic activity limitation of electrocatalysts. In this review, we thoroughly summarize the recent progress of atomic heterointerface engineering to improve the activity of electrocatalysts. The origin and rationale of the sluggish kinetics of the alkaline HER and OER are first introduced. Subsequently, the synergistic effects (ensemble effect and electron effect) of atomic heterointerface engineering to overcome the activity limitation are elaborated, in which the ensemble effect is helpful in optimizing the reaction pathways with enhanced reaction kinetics by creating a favorable heterointerface and the electron effect can balance the adsorption energies of reaction intermediates by coupling their electronic configurations. And then the rational design of the targeted electrocatalysts is concluded based on the heterointerface constituents and characteristics. At the end, some outlooks about the future development direction for optimizing and maximizing the interfacial active sites in the electrocatalysts are proposed.									57	1	0	0	4	0	57			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000695233300001

Therefore, it is still challengeable to develop an inexpensive and efficient OER catalyst via a facile and scalable synthesis method. To address such issues, herein, we present a facile and scalable approach to prepare ultrathin NiSe2/FeSe2 heterostructural nanoparticles in-situ grown on NiFe foam (NFS/NFF), which can be employed as a self-supported non-noble metal-based catalyst for OER. The NFS/NFF catalyst delivers outstanding OER performance with a small Tafel slope of 57.07 mV dec(-1) and a low overpotential of 274 mV at 40 mA cm(-2) and displays terrific long-term stability, surpassing the performance of commercial RuO2 and single component NiSe2/NF catalyst. The results of XPS manifest that there is a strong heterointerface interaction between NiSe2 and FeSe2. In addition, combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we further confirmed that the synergistic interface effect between NiSe2 and FeSe2 reduces the value of the Gibbs free energy of oxygen-containing intermediates as determining step (RDS) from 3.15 eV (NiSe2) to 2.41 eV (NiSe2/FeSe2 heterostructures), leading to excellent OER performance. This work provides a novel strategy to rationally design and fabricate selenide-based heterostructural nanoparticles via a facile method, which can extend to prepare other non-precious OER catalysts with high efficiency and long-term stability.

The significantly optimized OER activity of the alpha-Fe(2)O(3)NRs mainly attributes to the synergistic effect of the excellent electrical conductivity and a large effective active surface because of their unique nanoring structure, disordered surface, and the dynamic stability of alpha-Fe(2)O(3)NRs in acidic conditions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2046-2069		WOS:000560694000004	35521123

Well-defined single-crystal electrodes were prepared in a custom-made chamber that combines inductive thermal annealing and electrochemistry. The clean surfaces were analyzed for their electrocatalytic oxygen evolution activities and oxidation behavior. Three different oxidation protocols were used, which revealed a strong activity dependence on the duration and upper potential limit of the electrochemical oxidation. The resulting changes of the surface were followed by using cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy. Important differences between the two faces of Ir in terms of surface morphology of the formed oxide were identified, which allowed us to draw conclusions for preferable crystal faces in nanoparticle catalysts.									43	1	0	0	0	0	44			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000395653600014

Rapid Characterization of Multi-Metallic Electrocatalysts for the Water Splitting Reactions Utilizing Printed Microelectrodes on a Chip								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				163	5			H359	H366		10.1149/2.1141605jes				2016	2016	Understanding chemical composition effects is essential for creating efficient non-precious metal electrocatalysts for the water splitting reactions. Presented in this paper is a method for rapidly characterizing multi-metallic electrocatalysts utilizing printed microelectrodes on a chip. By using an ultrasonic printing technique, we demonstrate a new method to easily print microelectrodes comprising conductive wires, insulation over the wires, and a multi-metallic catalyst spot on a glass chip. We fabricated a custom test cell and electronic circuitry such that the microelectrode array can be exposed to electrolyte and voltammetry can be performed on each microelectrode independently. We also developed rapid-analysis software algorithms to quantitatively characterize each multi-metallic catalyst to obtain Tafel slopes and simulate each voltammogram using the COMSOL Multiphysics simulation software package to determine the reaction rate constant, k(eff)(0), for each catalyst. The catalytic activity of the hydrogen evolution reaction on the Ni-Mo metallic composites in both acidic and neutral pH, and the catalytic activity of the oxygen evolution reaction on the Fe-Ni oxides in basic pH were used as model systems to demonstrate the effectiveness of this rapid-characterization technique.

Understanding the decomposition of lithium carbonate during electrochemical oxidation (during battery charging) is key for improving both chemistries, but the decomposition mechanisms and the role of the carbon substrate remain under debate. Here, we use an in-situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry-gas chromatography coupling system to quantify the gas evolution during the electrochemical oxidation of lithium carbonate on carbon substrates. Our results show that lithium carbonate decomposes to carbon dioxide and singlet oxygen mainly via an electrochemical process instead of via a chemical process in an electrolyte of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide in tetraglyme. Singlet oxygen attacks the carbon substrate and electrolyte to form both carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide-approximately 20% of the net gas evolved originates from these side reactions. Additionally, we show that cobalt(II,III) oxide, a typical oxygen evolution catalyst, stabilizes the precursor of singlet oxygen, thus inhibiting the formation of singlet oxygen and consequent side reactions.Lithium carbonate is ubiquitous in lithium battery chemistries and leads to overpotentials, however its oxidative decomposition is unclear. Here, the authors study its decomposition in ether electrolyte, clarify the role of the carbon substrate, and propose a route to limit released singlet oxygen.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2041-1723		WOS:000843206100005	35987749

To this end, the introduction of iron and molybdenum in catalytic systems has been employed as a crucial strategy for the enhancement of catalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but the relationship between catalyst components and catalytic performance is still evasive. In this study, by doping iron and molybdenum into cobalt hydroxide via a cation-exchange method, rich oxygen vacancies and active metal centers are introduced to the trimetallic oxyhydroxide, endowing the catalyst with a low overpotential of 223 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 43.6 mV dec(-1), and a long stable operation time (>50 h) in alkaline media, comparable to the current best OER catalyst. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the doping of iron favors the generation of oxygen vacancies. It is also found in this work that using a certain amount (5 mg) of iron dopant can alter the electronic structure of the catalyst by tuning the electronic density around the metal ions, thus optimizing the binding energy of intermediates. The present work unveils the doping effect of iron and molybdenum on the construction of trimetallic oxyhydroxide catalysts, and sheds light on the relationship between the catalyst components and catalytic performance of the OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000826186700001	35843210

A prerequisite for the practical application of various electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies is the development of efficient and robust electrocatalysts. Recently, molecularly designed heterogeneous catalysts have drawn great attention because they combine the advantages of both heterogeneous solid and homogeneous molecular catalysts. In particular, recently emerged metal-phenolic networks (MPNs) show promise as electrocatalysts for various electrochemical reactions owing to their unique features. They can be easily synthesized under mild conditions, making them eco-friendly, form uniform and conformal thin films on various kinds of substrates, accommodate various metal ions in a single-atom manner, and have excellent charge-transfer ability. In this minireview, we summarize the development of various MPN-based electrocatalysts for diverse electrochemical reactions, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction, the oxygen evolution reaction, the CO2 reduction reaction, and the N-2 reduction reaction. We believe that this article provides insight into molecularly designable heterogeneous electrocatalysts based on MPNs and guidelines for broadening the applications of MPNs as electrocatalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000714172600001	34731231

However, their preferred active sites have been ill-defined until now. In this work, hierarchical hollow nanopolyhedra assembled by NiCo-LDH nanosheets with adjustable composition and nanostructure are prepared via a facile selftemplated strategy. DFT calculations indicate that Co3+ hollow sites are the preferred adsorption and active sites. The resultant hierarchical NiCo-LDH hollow nanopolyhedra realize superior OER activity by optimizing the composition of NiCo-LDH, which achieves a 10 mA cm(-2) current density at an overpotential of 314 mV. This work not only presents deeper insights into the intrinsic OER electrocatalytic activity for NiCo-LDH but also elucidates on the further optimization of the OER properties of other bimetallic electrocatalysts.									25	2	0	0	0	0	25			2574-0962			WOS:000458706900041

NiCoP/NF displays intertwined and porous columnar morphology derived from topological transformation of corresponding columnar amorphous hydroxides precursor. NiCoP/NF manifests the most prominent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance in both 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH with the overpotentials of 49 and 57 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Also, NiCoP/NF showed excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, requiring 256 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2), even superior to that of RuO2 and IrO2. Such impressive HER performance of NiCoP/NF is mainly attributed to the collective effects of enlarged surface area and enriched exposed active sites, affording faster charge transfer kinetic in HER process. This simple immersion method offers a new insight to design cost-effective and efficient electrocatalysts for large scale application. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Herein, Fe/N co-doped three-dimensional (3D) porous graphene (FeN-3D-PG) is prepared via a template method using sodium alginate as the carbon source and low polymerization degree melamine resin as the nitrogen source.

Meanwhile, the formed 3D porous structure efficiently promotes the uniform distribution of Fe-N-x active sites. The FeN-3D-PG catalyst exhibits pH-independent ORR activity. For OER, the catalyst possesses a low over potential (370 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) in alkaline electrolyte. The Zn-air batteries (ZABs) using FeN-3D-PG as cathode exhibits a power density up to 212 mW cm(-2), a high specific capacity of 651 mAh g(-1), and the charge-discharge stability of 80 h. This work provides new sight to transition metal materials based ZABs with excellent performance. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The catalytic effects of DTBBQ on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and TMPPA on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were investigated and unambiguously substantiated with various electrochemical, morphological, and spectroscopic characterization methods. It is observed that, upon discharging, oxygen is rapidly reduced by DTBBQ(center dot-) and Li2O2 is formed in the presence of Lit; upon charging, Li2O2 is oxidized by TMPPA(center dot-), releasing oxygen. Such redox-mediated ORR and OER reactions enable the formation and oxidation of Li2O2 in a separate gas diffusion tank (GDT) other than on the cathode of the cell, thus obviating surface passivation and pore clogging of the electrode. The cell presents a high energy density with DTBBQ as the ORR redox catalyst and good rechargeability when paired with TMPPA as the OER redox catalyst. While the robustness and redox potential of two molecules are to be further optimized, the RFLOB demonstrated in this study provides an intriguing means for high-density and large-scale energy storage.									78	4	0	0	3	0	79			2155-5435			WOS:000382714000063

The catalytic activity of 3DOM La0.95Ce0.05CoO3 (3DOM LCCO-0.05) is significantly improved over that of the unmodified LaCoO3, with the OER overpotential to reach 10 mA cm(-2) lowered by 190 mV, the ORR limiting current density doubled, and the OER-ORR potential gap reduced by 220 mV to 1.07 V. This enhanced activity is attributed to the increased electrochemical surface area and specific activity, as evidenced by the greater double-layer capacitances and the lower charge transfer resistances determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Furthermore, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photospectroscopy (XPS) results reveal that these enhanced OER/ORR activities are possibly related to the transformation of the cobalt(III) spin state from low to intermediate or high-spin, and the increasing amount of surface oxygen species and oxygen vacancies.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000734945100001

The oxygen-rich atmosphere and iron-rich core represent two end-members of the oxygen-iron (O-Fe) system, overlapping with the entire pressure-temperature-composition range of the planet. The extreme pressure and temperature conditions of the deep interior alter the oxidation states(1), spin states(2) and phase stabilities(3,4) of iron oxides, creating new stoichiometries, such as Fe4O5 (ref. 5) and Fe5O6 (ref. 6). Such interactions between O and Fe dictate Earth's formation, the separation of the core and mantle, and the evolution of the atmosphere. Iron, in its multiple oxidation states, controls the oxygen fugacity and oxygen budget, with hydrogen having a key role in the reaction of Fe and O (causing iron to rust in humid air). Here we use first-principles calculations and experiments to identify a highly stable, pyrite-structured iron oxide (FeO2) at 76 gigapascals and 1,800 kelvin that holds an excessive amount of oxygen. We show that the mineral goethite, FeOOH, which exists ubiquitously as 'rust' and is concentrated in bog iron ore, decomposes under the deep lower-mantle conditions to form FeO2 and release H-2. The reaction could cause accumulation of the heavy FeO2-bearing patches in the deep lower mantle, upward migration of hydrogen, and separation of the oxygen and hydrogen cycles. This process provides an alternative interpretation for the origin of seismic and geochemical anomalies in the deep lower mantle, as well as a sporadic O-2 source for the Great Oxidation Event over two billion years ago that created the present oxygen-rich atmosphere.									182	34	1	0	25	0	201			0028-0836	1476-4687		WOS:000377475100039	27279220

However, the activation and decomposition of urea molecule maintains a challenge during electrocatalytic process because of its 6e- oxidation procedure. Herein, Ni nanoparticles decorated NiMoOx nanorod (Ni/NiMoOx) electrocatalyst with abundant heterojunction interfaces is fabricated and the density functional theory (DFT) calculation testifies that the interfaces are favorable for enhancing the conductivity and modulating the surface polarization of Ni/NiMoOx, thus improving its UOR's activity. The Ni/NiMoOx performs superb electrocatalytic capacities toward UOR with a potential of 1.355 V (vs RHE) at 20 mA cm-2, and HER with an overpotential of 98 mV at 10 mA cm-2. A hybrid two-electrode water splitting cell is further assembled via applying the Ni/NiMoOx as both anodic and cathodic electrodes with presence of 0.33 M urea, delivering 50 mA cm-2 at voltage of 1.589 V. The findings help to provide a reliable strategy for rational reconstruction of Ni based metal oxide with rich interfaces for diverse electrocatalytic reactions.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

J	Li, Linjun; Karimata, Takahiro; Hayashi, Akari; Ito, Kohei								Evaluation of the boiling effect on oxygen evolution reaction using a three-electrode cell								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				47	61			25499	25510		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.06.010				JUL 19 2022	2022	The high initial cost of polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) has delayed their widespread commercialization. A possible means to reduce cost is by reducing the overvoltage and increasing the current density to reduce the electrode area. This study proposes a novel method in which boiling is superimposed on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to decrease electrolysis voltage. The vapor bubbles formed by boiling are expected to decrease the concentration overvoltage. The boiling effect was experimentally analyzed using a three-electrode cell. Although a general catalyst layer (CL) was formed on a working electrode (WE) bar, the structure of the working electrode (WE) bar was special, in which a 10-W heater was embedded and made boiling on the electrode under 1 bar condition. Increasing the electrode temperature under static OER current density slightly decreased the OER potential. However, an abrupt decrease in potential was observed when the temperature was scaled over the boiling temperature. Moreover, this abrupt decrease substantially intensified when, similar to a practical PEMWE, a porous transfer layer (PTL) and flow channel were assembled on the CL. These experimental re-sults suggest that boiling can reduce the concentration overvoltage by reducing the oxygen concentration on the CL, especially when the mass transport resistance caused by the PTL is considerable. Innovatively and simply utilizing boiling, as proposed here, can enhance the oxygen transfer and contribute to reducing the initial cost of PEMWEs. (c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Herein, we demonstrate that heteroatom doping is a feasible strategy to trigger oxygen vacancies, and remarkably enhance the conductivity and catalytic activity of the Co3O4 electrocatalyst. The optimized Co3O4 cathode with abundant oxygen vacancies regulates the geometric morphology of the discharge product Li2O2, which accelerates the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction kinetics notably and lowers the redox overpotential. Density functional theory calculations reveal that intrinsic LiO2-adsorption ability on the Co3O4 surface is dramatically strengthened after heteroatom doping, thus fundamentally modulating the growth route of Li2O2 and suppressing the parasitic reactions caused by LiO2. In particular, a phosphorus-doped Co3O4 cathode exhibits a decreased polarization potential (1.2 V), large initial discharge capacity (7690 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1)), and good cyclability (90 cycles at 100 mA g(-1)). This work provides insight into the vital role of heteroatom doping and oxygen vacancies in tailoring the morphology of Li2O2 and suppressing side reactions, and provides inspiration for cathode catalyst design in lithium oxygen batteries.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2574-0962			WOS:000813050400001

We herein reported the in situ growth of Fe-benzenedicarboxylate(Fe-BDC) on Co(OH)(2) nanoplates[Fe-BDC/Co(OH)(2)] that showed remarkably enhanced OER activity than the pristine Co(OH)(2). The incorporation of Fe species could enhance the intrinsic OER activity of Co and BDC could increase the electrochemically active surface area(ECSA), thus resulting in dramatically enhanced OER activity. In situ Raman spectroscopy characterization disclosed that Fe-CoOOH reconstructed from Fe-BDC/Co(OH)(2) was the real active site for OER. This work highlights the significance of rational tailoring of the nanostructure and electronic structure of Co(OH)(2) and provides more opportunities for its widespread applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1005-9040	2210-3171		WOS:000857455200002

In this work, 3D hierarchical NiFe-LDH/FeCoS2/CFC electrodes were synthesized for the first time. The carboxyl groups derived from acid treating promote the homogeneously coated FeCoS(2)on CFC, giving rise to the strongly coupled FeCoS2/CFC hybrid. The NiFe-LDH exhibited the vertical growth feature on the FeCoS2/CFC composite, which can efficiently expose the active edges sites. Due to unique structure and synergistic effect between the components, the NiFe-LDH/FeCoS2/CFC exhibits significant electrocatalytic activity and stability under alkaline environments, with overpotentials of 190 and 308 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2)for OER and HER, respectively, providing it as a promising electrocatalyst for water splitting reaction. In addition, we deeply studied the synergistic catalytic mechanism of NiFe-LDH/FeCoS2/CFC, explaining the reasons leading to the improved catalytic performance of HER and OER.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with sluggish dynamics is the crucial half-reaction toward electrocatalytic water splitting, which needs a non-noble metal catalyst with high performance to make the reaction process be more energy-efficient and economical. Perovskite, as a kind of price moderate, compositional adjustable, structurally stable, and highly active material, has been widely used as the catalyst for the OER under alkaline conditions. In this review, we systematically expound the OER-related catalytic mechanism, provide the evaluative criteria of catalytic performance, and then summarize the corresponding measurement methods of catalysts for the alkaline OER. Furthermore, our emphasis is given to the synthetic methods, the activity descriptors, and the performance optimization strategies of perovskite-based catalysts. Finally, we present a number of future directions on the development of more highly efficient perovskite-based catalysts for the alkaline OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000866725100001

In this work, a series of single-atom catalysts sandwiched by boron nitride sheet and graphene (BN/TM/G) are screened for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) theoretically. The scaling relationships indicate that Delta G(*OH) can serve as the descriptor to reflect the catalytic activity of BN/TM/G. Moreover, the volcano plot suggests that BN/TM/G with moderate binding strength of *OH (0.5 eV < Delta G(*OH) < 1.2 eV) show relatively high ORR and OER activity. When the metals are Co, Mo, Ru, Tc, Mn, Cu, Ni, and Fe, the corresponding BN/TM/G catalysts are screened out for efficiently catalyzing ORR and OER. Especially, BN/Cu/G has the highest ORR activity with overpotential of 0.39 V, which may be attributed to the moderate interaction between Cu atom and BN sheet/graphene. The BN/Mo/G has the highest OER activity with overpotential of 0.52 V. In addition, BN/Cu/G and BN/Mo/G have excellent poisoning-tolerance ability for H2S, SO2, and CO. This work is conducive to provide guidance for designing this kind of sandwich-like electrocatalysts for ORR and OER. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

With a small band gap, Fe2O3 efficiently harnesses solar energy for the overall photoelectrochemical water splitting. Consequently, a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) requires only 1.50 V under one-sun illumination. Surface and spectroscopic analyses indicate that photoholes at the Fe2O3 NTAs transfer to Ni3B, rendering the Ni3B surface easier to oxidize into beta-Ni(OH)(2), which is ultimately converted into the OER-catalyzing gamma-NiOOH species at a relatively low anodic potential. Photoelectrons become localized at the HER-active Ni sites in Ni3B. This work integrates photochemistry with electrocatalysis, affording a new avenue for developing high-performance and cost-effective photoelectrocatalysts for energy conversion applications.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000598674500014

During alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the former enables active states for H-ad adsorption/desorption; meanwhile, nearby Ni delta+ vacancies allow an optimal interaction with OHad. Consequently, such a synergistic action significantly expedites water dissociation and HER kinetics on the Ni-O catalyst with exceptional activity approaching that of the benchmark platinum electrocatalyst.

Specifically, we show that stars belonging to two previously identified kinematical classes (the so-called "accretion" and "dissipative" populations) are neatly separated in the [O/Fe] vs. log (Be/H) diagram. The dissipative population follows the predictions of our model of Galactic evolution for the thick disk component, suggesting that the formation of this stellar population occurred on a timescale significantly longer (by a factor similar to 5-10) than the accretion component. The latter shows a large scatter in the [O/Fe] vs. log (Be/H) diagram, probably resulting from the inhomogeneous enrichment in oxygen he and iron of the protogalactic gas. Despite the limitation of the sample, the data suggest that the combined use of products of spallation reactions (like beryllium) and elemental ratios of stellar nucleosynthesis products (like [O/Fe]) can constrain theoretical models for the formation and early evolution of our Galaxy.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			0004-6361			WOS:000229667300003		
J	Bowker, M; Rowbotham, E; Leibsle, FM; Haq, S								The adsorption and decomposition of formic acid on Cu{110}								SURFACE SCIENCE				349	2			97	110		10.1016/0039-6028(95)01069-6				APR 1 1996	1996	The reactive adsorption of formic acid (HCOOH) on oxygen dosed Cu(110) has been studied using a molecular beam system, TPD, LEED and STM. At low temperature the reaction is strongly oxygen coverage dependent. All coverages result in high reaction probability (0.8 at room temperature) for formic acid and, for less than 0.25 monolayers of oxygen there is complete oxygen clean-off, leaving formate on the surface in a c(2 X 2) structure, At higher coverages the situation is more complex, with some oxygen remaining coadsorbed with the formate. The two adsorbates are then mainly phase separated into islands of c(6 X 2) oxygen and (3 X 1) formate, The two phases mutually compress each other due to pressure at the phase boundaries. The reaction stoichiometry is 2:1 formic acid:oxygen atoms in this temperature range. At higher temperatures (> 450 K) the formate itself is unstable and decomposes during adsorption which results in a change of stoichiometry of the reaction; one molecule of formic acid removes an oxygen atom as water, and hydrogen evolution ceases. There is a range of temperature between 350 and 420 K for which the reaction becomes very difficult, and the reaction probability drops to similar to 0.1. It is proposed that this is due to rapid compression of much of the oxygen adlayer into the unreactive c(6 x 2) structure by small amounts of formate. The reaction proceeds through a highly mobile, weakly held, ''precursor'' state on the surface, which is able to seek out the active sites on the surface, which are low in coverage at high levels of oxygen, These active sites are the terminal oxygen atoms in the oxygen islands (in the [001] direction), which are only present at step edges or phase boundaries at 0.5 monolayers coverage of oxygen.									102	1	0	0	0	0	102			0039-6028			WOS:A1996UC74300002		
J	Wan, Xin; Song, Yingjie; Zhou, Hua; Shao, Mingfei								Layered Double Hydroxides for Oxygen Evolution Reaction towards Efficient Hydrogen Generation								ENERGY MATERIAL ADVANCES				2022						9842610	10.34133/2022/9842610				SEP 7 2022	2022	Electrochemical water splitting is one of the effective ways to obtain highly pure hydrogen. However, as one of the two half reactions, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has a high overpotential, resulting in the low-energy utilization efficiency. Therefore, numerous electrocatalysts have been developed to reduce the energy barrier of OER. Among them, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are excellent OER electrocatalysts with flexible composition and structure, which have been widely investigated in the past decade. Recent studies have been focusing on the identification of active sites for LDHs during OER process, trying to reveal clear reaction mechanism for designing more efficient LDHs electrocatalysts. Hence, this review tries to discuss the advances in identifying active site of LDHs based OER electrocatalysts for efficient hydrogen generation. We first introduce the effect of structure, composition, and defects to the OER performance of LDHs. Furthermore, main attention is paid on the active sites and mechanisms during OER, especially the coordination structures and catalytic mechanisms of active sites. At the end of this review, we put forward the existing problems and shortcomings in this fields, and propose the corresponding solutions, aiming to further promote the development of outstanding OER electrocatalysts towards efficient hydrogen production.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2097-1133	2692-7640		WOS:000865933400001

Herein, we report QS (quasi-spherical), IR (irregular), and NR (nanorod) Mn2OBO3 (manganese oxoborate), modified with a carbon support, as candidate electrocatalysts for OER in a neutral medium. QS-, IR- and NR-Mn2OBO3 catalysts displayed low onset potentials of 201 mV, 205 mV, and 208 mV and Tafel slope results of 94 mV dec(-1), 97 mV dec(-1), and 106 mV dec(-1), respectively. As a result of the long-term stability tests, it was determined that the NR-Mn2OBO3 sample was extremely stable compared to the QS- and IR-catalysts. This work introduces a new Mn2OBO3/C composite catalyst that displays efficient OER performance at a neutral medium and provides a different perspective for catalyst development strategies.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2199-692X			WOS:000706309700001

However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) occurring at the anode are impeded by the sluggish reaction kinetics during the water-splitting process. Consequently, it is promising to develop bifunctional anodic electrocatalysts consisting of nonprecious metals. Herein, a bifunctional CoMn layered double hydroxide (LDH) was grown on nickel foam (NF) with a 1D-2D-3D hierarchical structure for efficient OER and UOR performance in alkaline solution. Owing to the significant synergistic effect of Mn doping and heterostructure engineering, the obtained Co1Mn1LDH/NF exhibits satisfactory OER activity with a low potential of 1.515 V to attain 10 mA cm(-2). Besides, the potential of the Co1Mn1LDH/NF catalyst for UOR at the same current density is only 1.326 V, which is much lower than those of its counterparts and most reported electrocatalysts. An urea electrolytic cell with a Co1Mn1LDH/NF anode and a Pt-C/NF cathode was established, and a low cell voltage of 1.354 V at 10 mA cm(-2)was acquired. The optimized strategy may result in promising candidates for developing a new generation of bifunctional electrocatalysts for clean energy production.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000539657100001	32304252

An economic and industrially viable alternative approach for the optimization of atomic hydrogen binding energy is urgently needed. Herein, guided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is theoretically demonstrated that oxygen doping in NiCoP can indeed optimize the atomic hydrogen binding energy (e.g., |G(H*)| = 0.08, 0.12 eV on Co, P sites). To confirm this, NiCoP electrodes with controllable oxygen doping are designed and fabricated via alteration of the reducing atmosphere. Accordingly, an optimal oxygen-doped NiCoP (approximate to 0.98% oxygen) nanowire array is found to exhibit the remarkably low hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) overpotential of 44 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 38.6 mV dec(-1), and long-term stability of 30 h in an alkaline medium. In neutral solution, only a 51 mV overpotential (@10 mA cm(-2)) is required, and the Tafel slope is 79.2 mV dec(-1). Meanwhile, in situ Raman spectra confirm the low formation overpotential (-30 mV) of NiCo-phosphate at the surface of approximate to 0.98% oxygen-doped NiCoP, which enables the material to show better HER performance.									106	11	0	0	5	0	108			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000434174300019	29688629

The thermally produced uniform carbon layer on TiO2 (Degussa P25) protects the TiO2 nanoparticles from sintering and, at the same time, supplies the carbon source for doping TiO2 with carbon. At low temperatures (e. g., 700 degrees C), carbon only substitutes part of the oxide and distorts the TiO2 lattice to form TiO2-xCx with only substitutional carbon. When the carbon-doped TiO2 is annealed at a higher temperature (1100 degrees C), x-ray diffraction and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results showed that TiOxCy, a solid solution of TiO and TiC, was formed, which displays different diffraction peaks and binding energies. It was shown that TiOxCy has much better oxygen revolution reaction activity than TiO2 or TiO2-xCx. Further studies showed that the TiOxCy obtained can be used as a support for metal electrocatalyst, leading to a bifunctional catalyst effective for both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions.									24	0	0	0	2	0	24			0884-2914	2044-5326		WOS:000314421700025

The nanosheets have lateral sizes of few hundred nm with thicknesses of similar to 6 nm. Our theoretical calculations suggest the effectiveness of vanadium doping and oxygen plasma, which do not only enhance the density-of-state at Fermi level, but also make the Ni sites more susceptible to OH- adsorption. The oxygen plasma treatment can increase the wettability of the catalyst toward KOH solution, improving the contact angle from 44.95 degrees to 16.8 degrees, and also induce a higher BET surface area; hence, more active sites and lower charge transfer resistance are obtained. As a result, the catalyst requires small overpotentials of 257 and 108 mV to drive +/- 10 mA cm(-2) alongside with modest Tafel slope of 43.5 and 72.3 mV dec(-1) for oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction in 1.0M KOH solution, respectively. When employed for overall water splitting, the catalyst demonstrates a low voltage of 1.56 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) with good stability and durability, outperforming the state-of-the-art IrO2 || Pt/C which needs 1.69 V. This work opens a new approach to engineer low-cost monometallic phosphides for highly efficient water splitting.									80	5	0	0	5	0	81			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000450974700010

The hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) has been considered as one of the most promising substitute for OER to improve the efficiency of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we construct novel dual nanoislands on Ni/C hybrid nanosheet array: one kind of island represents the part of bare Ni particle surface, while the other stands for the part of core-shell Ni@C structure (denoted as Ni-C HNSA), in which exposed Ni atoms and Ni-decorated carbon shell perform as active sites for HzOR and HER respectively. As a result, when the current density reaches 10 mA cm(-2), the working potentials are merely -37 mV for HER and -20 mV for HzOR. A two-electrode electrolyzer exhibits superb activity that only requires an ultrasmall cell voltage of 0.14 V to achieve 50 mA cm(-2).									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000722277500001	34669234

However, these systems suffer issues from both the metallic lithium electrode and the oxygen electrode. For example, the cathode discharge product (lithium peroxide) is a semiconductor of large bandgap (5 eV), which yields severe cyclability issues, as the re-charge is limited. Using electrolyte additives may be one option to mitigate (if not solve) this issue. Herein, a new redox mediator compound (N,N'-Bis(salicylidene)ethylenediaminocobalt (II), noted Co-salen) is studied with regards to its impact on the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in non-aqueous medium. Its performances are compared to those of a Cobalt porphyrin (noted Co(II)-Po). Electrochemical experiments in three-electrode setup, Differential Electrochemical Mass Spectrometry (DEMS) and UV-Visible spectroscopy, demonstrate that Co-salen can also greatly improve the oxygen reduction kinetics (the ORR onset potential is positively-shifted by 230 mV in the presence of Co-salen), thanks to the formation of a complex with oxygen in solution. Secondly, Co-salen enables to efficiently transport electrons in the solution, and help to recover the electrode surface (the re-charge of large Li2O2 particles becomes possible). Therefore, enhancing both the oxygen reduction and the oxygen evolution reactions (ORR and OER) with only one additive in the electrolyte is feasible, and places Co-salen among the best compounds to be used as redox shuttles for non-aqueous Li-O-2 batteries.

Herein, we report nitrogen-enriched porous carbon materials containing copper/copper oxide, derived from copper porphyrin-based conjugated mesoporous polymers (CMPs), as a bifunctional catalyst for both HER and OER. These catalysts have a high surface area, unique tubular structure, and strong synergistic effect of copper/copper oxide and porous carbons, resulting in excellent performance for water splitting. Under optimal conditions, the catalyst exhibits a quite low overpotential for OER (350mV to reach 1.0mAcm(-2) and 450mV to reach 10mAcm(-2)) in alkaline media, which places it among the best copper-based water oxidation catalysts reported in the literature. Furthermore, the catalyst shows good catalytic activity for HER at a low overpotential (190mV to reach 1.0mAcm(-2)) as well as a high current density (470mV to reach 50mAcm(-2)). The results suggest that hybridized copper/carbon materials are attractive noble-metal-free catalysts for water splitting.									62	1	0	0	2	0	62			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000383679600016	27530422

Here, a novel composite catalyst of Co1-xS embedded in porous dodecahedron carbon hybrid was synthesized by a two-step conversion protocol of a cobalt-based metal-organic framework (ZIF-67). The porous dodecahedron Co1-xS@C composite catalyst was prepared by direct oxidation of ZIF-67 followed by sulfurization reaction. The Co1-xS@C composite exhibit superior OER performance, including a low overpotential of 260 mV for 10 mA/cm(2), a small Tafel slope of similar to 85 mV/dec, outstanding stability over 80 h and almost 100% Faradaic efficiency. The various material characterizations indicate that the excellent activity and strong stability of Co1-xS@C might be attributed to good conductivity of Co1-xS, mesoporous nanostructure, and synergistic effect of Co1-xS encapsulated within porous carbon.

Herein, we presented a simple metal-organic framework (MOF)-based approach for facile fabrication of noble-metal-free trifunctional heterostructure electrocatalysts. Different from traditional MOF-derived composite materials, Mo2C nanosheets are vertically aligned on the surface of cobalt-embedded nitrogen-doped carbon polyhedron (Mo2C/Co@NC). Benefiting from the reciprocally permeated structure and strong interfacial coupling effects between Mo2C nanosheets and Co@NC polyhedron, the intrinsic activities and the accessible active sites toward HER, OER and ORR are significantly improved, which endows Mo2C/Co@NC with high electrocatalytic activity and durability as a trifunctional electrocatalyst. Notably, Mo2C/Co@NC-based Zn-air battery could efficiently power the electrochemical water splitting using Mo2C/Co@NC as the electrodes.

It is still a challenge to search for a simple and easy way to controllably adjust the interface of catalysts. Here we report a new strategy, electric field polarization to regulate the charged functional groups of nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH)/carbon dots (CDs) composite catalysts. The selectively exposed sulfonate functional groups on CDs under the electric field have regulated the interfacial environment of the composite catalyst. The density function theory (DFT) calculation also reveals that the high electrocatalytic activity can be attributed to H+ capture from *OH or *OOH species by the sulfonated groups on the surface of CDs. Thus, the synergistic effect between the catalytic activity of NiFe LDH and the functional group-modified CDs enhances the OER performance of the composite catalyst, showing low overpotential of 200 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and outstanding kinetics with Tafel slope of 55.2 mV dec-1. Moreover, the polarized composite catalysts can reach a high current density of 51.7 mA cm-2 at 1.46 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is 9.2 times higher than the unpolarized one (5.6 mA cm-2).									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000664250200005

Due its stability, some doped SnO2 supports could be used as an alternative to carbon black in PEM water electrolysis. In this work, IrO2 catalyst was mixed in a colloidal mini-mill with SnO2 supports doped with antimonium (ATO) in a fixed proportion (50:50 wt %) and the mixtures were used as anodic material for Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER). ATO supports were obtained by reaction between Sn and Sb chloride precursors in alcoholic medium at moderate temperature, followed by an annealing procedure at 500 degrees C and different times of treatment (between 3 h and 15 h). The electrodes were evaluated in terms of OER by Linear Scan Voltammetry (LSV) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. Electrokinetic parameters as Tafel Slope and Exchange Current Density for OER were obtained as a function of the different annealing times material support. Furthermore, the Charge Transfer Resistances (Rct) for oxygen evolution obtained from the Nyquist impedance spectra were compared. Although the LSV results showed a similar behavior for the OER of the several electrodes studied, the EIS analysis presented some distinctive Rct values for the electrodes assayed. The electrodes that showed minimum Rct values corresponded to those prepared with supports of 3 h of annealing time. These results could suggest that the ATO conductive properties depend on the time of thermal treatment of the oxide in the synthesis procedure.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1452-3981			WOS:000323548600037

Also, due to the sluggish process of reaction, it is crucial to fabricate high-performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts to increase the overall efficiency of water electrolysis. In this study, we present a remarkably thin Co-Fe phosphide/carbon (CFP) nanosheet for the OER catalyst. The fabrication of CFP nanosheet is accomplished by three easy steps, which start with the synthesis of Co- and Fe-based brucite-type metal hydroxide (CFT) using an organic linker. Then, CFT undergoes subsequent oxidation and phosphorization to become CFP. During post-treatment, the organic linker becomes a carbon composite and remains on the CFP nanosheet which could benefit the overall catalytic efficiency. CFP nanosheet is equipped with a thickness of 7.67 nm on average, which is recognizably low considering the post-treatments. The electrochemical OER performance of CFP nanosheet implies high catalysis capability toward OER with the overpotential of 277 and 362 mV to reach the current density of 10 and 150 mA.cm(-2), respectively. To investigate the catalytic active site, ex situ XPS analysis shows some beneficial characteristics of CFP nanosheet that benefit the OER catalysis overall. The investigation suggests that reactive oxyhydroxides (peroxo-like O-2(2-) species) are formed via surface reconstruction and gradually increase during the OER catalysis. This phenomenon implies the synergistic effect between Co and Fe, which is determined by electrochemical measurements. Also, the evidence of lattice oxygen implies the possible OER mechanism in which the involvement of the oxygen intermediates is crucial. The utilization of our investigation can be extended to other fields of energy material synthesis, which include batteries, supercapacitors, and even other electrochemical catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000757948100001

We take account 16 different chemical species reacting following 120 selected chemicals reactions. The mathematical model used consists of a system of equations that takes into account the variation of the density and the chemical kinetics of the environment. The reaction rate coefficients are taken from the literature. We analyse especially, the time evolution (10-9-10-3 s) of NO, NO2, NO3 and N2O5 species under different values of electrical field. The results show that the evolution of these nitrous oxides is substantially affected by the application of the electrical discharge. This allows us the important role played by the negative corona discharge in NOx removing.

Lattice distortion from lattice strain at phase boundaries as a result of interfacial structure engineering is also appealing. Fe oxyhydroxide containing Fe3+ lead to unstable Fe4+ with a short lifetime on edge/defect sites during steady-state water-oxidation catalysis. Such material was deliberately installed to achieve atom-scale combination with Ni3+ relevant layered double hydroxide to construct high-energy interfaces for high-oxidation-state cations synergy and induce lattice distortion. The Fe-o-NiAlOH exhibited prominent property toward oxygen evolution reaction with 202 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2). Fe-o-NiAlOH also showed hydrogen evolution reaction activity, requiring an overpotential of 180 mV for 10 mA cm(-2). Alkaline water electrolyzer with Fe-o-NiAlOH as both anodic and cathodic electrodes required only 1.64 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2). This work offers an effective well-defined electrocatalyst and shows the synergetic protocol of unstable high-oxidation-state cations and lattice defects for high-performance water decomposition catalysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2196-0216			WOS:000735883700013

A specificity of such solutions is the achievement of high potentials at which the anodes traditionally used for the synthesis of chlorine [rutile oxide/titania (RuO2-TiO2)] are destroyed. The main aim of the work concerns the eveluation of the effect of platinum (Pt) group metals in a tin oxide (SnO2) matrix on the electrocatalytic activity and selectivity in reactions of the synthesis of sodium hypochlorite and chlorate (NaClO and NaClO3) and oxygen (O-2) evolution. RESULTS It was revealed that palladium (Pd) in oxide Ti/SnO2-Pd and Ti/SnO2-Pt-Pd coatings existed in the PdO form, which has a high affinity for hydroxylation. Electrocatalytic activity of coatings in anode processes in low concentrated chloride-containing solutions would be determined by the bond strength of chemisorbed with the surface O-containing particles. Participation in the process of Cl- oxidation of labile O-containing particles increased the rate of formation of NaClO and led to inhibition of adverse reactions of O-2 evolution and synthesis of chlorates and chlorites. CONCLUSION A correlation between the selectivity of formation of NaClO and NaClO3, and the activity of the catalyst in the O-2 evolution reaction is proposed. Significant formation of chlorates occurred only at the anodes, where in 1 mol L-1 HClO4 the O-2 evolution potential was >1.58 V. Parameters influencing the electrocatalytic activity and selectivity of electrode materials in the target process were proposed based on this dependence.

We prepared hierarchical hollow NiCoMn-layered double hydroxide (LDH) microcuboids that consisted of two dimensional (2D) nanosheets by using a solvothermal method. The prepared Ni6Co11Mn-LDH exhibits high OER activity, with an overpotential of 248 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)and a small Tafel slope of 72.2 mV dec(-1), which is even better than the noble-metal RuO(2)catalyst. It remains stable after chronopotentiometric testing at a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2)for 22 h, indicating potential for practical application. The enhanced OER performance is ascribed to the transition of Ni(2+)to Ni(3+)in NiCo-LDH induced by Mn doping, which activates the Ni sites. This work provides an approach to further optimize the OER performance of NiCo-LDH based catalysts.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2196-0216			WOS:000573612100024

This hydrogen evolution appears not to be linked to the nitrogen fixation capacity of this organism as the amplitudes are identical with nitrate-grown and nitrogen free-grown cultures. The hydrogen evolution amplitudes remain virtually constant over the whole series of flashes, i.e. no oscillatory pattern is observed. The dependence of the oxygen evolution signal under the third flash of a sequence on the light intensity shows significant differences, if the relative intensities of the first, second or third flash are modulated. In view of current discussions this might be interpreted in terms of a charge transfer between reaction centers and thus of a limited independence of the centers - as it has been suggested for e.g. synechococcus. Addition of quaternary ammonium salts like alkylbenzyldimethyl ammoniumchloride (ABDAC; zephirol) strongly increases the oscillation of the oxygen evolution patterns but does not induce a (period-2) oscillation in the case of hydrogen evolution. Our results suggest that also in the case of cyanobacteria (Oscillatoria chalybea) the reaction centers act independently so that the strong damping of the oscillation of the oxygen evolving amplitudes must be explained in terms of the 'missed' transitions between the sequential oxidation steps.					95th Annual Meeting of the Deutsche-Bunsen-Gesellschaft-fur-Physikalische-Chemie on Primary Processes of Photosynthesis95th Annual Meeting of the Deutsche-Bunsen-Gesellschaft-fur-Physikalische-Chemie on Primary Processes of Photosynthesis	MAY 16-18, 1996MAY 16-18, 1996	Deut Bunsen Gesell Phys ChemDeut Bunsen Gesell Phys Chem	JENA, GERMANYJENA, GERMANY	2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0005-9021			WOS:A1996WB83300012

The ZnO nanowires serve as the hole providers. The photogenerated holes are derived under applied external bias to the 3C-SiC NCs.

Herein, CNT-supported Ni-Fe bimetallic oxide hollow nanoparticles (NiFe2O4-HNP/CNTs) based on the Kirkendall effect were fabricatedviaa facile method. These NiFe(2)O(4)hollow nanoparticles were uniformly distributed on the outmost surfaces of the CNTs with an ultra-small size of about 10 nm in diameter and 3 nm in wall thickness, which provide a significantly increased number of active sites and reduced charge transfer resistance for OER. As a result, the as-synthesized NiFe2O4-HNP/CNTs exhibit excellent OER performance with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)at a low overpotential of 260 mV and a small Tafel slope of 40 mV dec(-1)as well as robust stability, superior to the benchmark IrO(2)catalyst. Our results demonstrate that constructing hollow nanostructures with a small size on the conductive substrate is an efficient strategy for highly efficient oxygen evolution.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000579632900017

The Rh@NG exhibits outstanding electrochemical activities and kinetics for oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline medium, which can compare to Pt/C catalysts, along with excellent durability and good tolerance to methanol and carbon monoxide.

It is an urgent need to find low-cost and high-performance replacements for platinum-based catalysts towards hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, bifunctional RuNi alloy nanoparticles embedded in oxygen-doped carbon were prepared via simple annealing of Ru-doped Ni-BTC, the limiting current density of which could reach 2.46 mA/cm(2) (close to Pt) in 0.1 mol/L KOH for HOR. And the low overpotentials of only 29 mV in 1 mol/L KOH and 62 mV in 0.5 mol/L H2SO4 were needed to reach the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) for HER. The effect of alloying and oxygen-doped graphene contributed to the excellent activity and stability during hydrogen electrocatalysis.

The daunting challenge in developing multifunctional electrocatalysts at present is to effectively incorporate multiple active sites into one material. Herein, we presented a general protocol by a controllable pyrolysis/vapor reforming process, which allows for reconstitution to form CoNC nano-units, while preserving Co and Co oxides simultaneously. The material by co-intercalation of these active units into graphene generates outstanding trifunctional activities. The overpotentials for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions are 205 and 360 mV (at 10 mA cm(-2)), respectively, and the half-wave potential for the oxygen reduction reaction is 0.81 V, outperforming most of the state-of-the-art trifunctional electrocatalysts. A maximum power density of 23 mW cm(-2) and 1000 stable cycles were realized in the as-prepared material equipped Zn-air battery. This battery further drove overall water splitting for 24 hours, at a faradaic efficiency of ca. 100% and gas production rate of 0.035 and 0.017 mL min(-1) for hydrogen and oxygen, respectively. Thus this work offers a general approach to explore other efficient multifunctional electrocatalysts for application in renewable energy technologies.									29	2	0	0	1	0	29			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000412800300041

Growth of interconnected flake-like, surface morphology of CoMnNiS was evaluated from field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and its formation has been corelated to metal ion denudated layer (MIDL) theory. Electrocatalytic activities, oxygen/hydrogen evolution were tested in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) results revealed a Tafel slope of 48 mV/dec, and overpotential of 371 mV@10 mA/cm(2) with an exchange current density of 0.33 mA/cm(2) (from geometrical surface area). On the contrary, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity exhibited a Tafel slope of 101 mV/dec, and overpotential of - 226 mV@10 mA/cm(2) with an exchange current density of 0.13 mA/cm(2). Stability of CoMnNiS electrocatalyst was tested for 21 h. duration, which demonstrates an efficiency of 48 and 56% for OER and HER process, respectively. These electrocatalytic results are attributed to the presence of electrochemical species (multiple oxidation states of Co, Mn, i.e., Co+3/Co+2, and Mn+2/Mn+3/Mn+4) on the sample surface, as evidenced from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Thus, the electrodeposited CoMnNiS nanostructure proves to be an effective electrocatalyst in alkaline reaction for OER due to its ease of synthesis, performance, and stability.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000641681500001

This finding implies that a chemical reaction step could be generally ignored before the onset of OER current. More importantly, the tetrahedral Co2+ ions in the spinet Co3O4 could be the vital species to initiate the formation of the mu-OO peroxide moieties.									95	5	0	0	7	0	96			1948-7185			WOS:000389175200008	27934038

Herein, for the first time overall water splitting reaction to H-2 and O-2 is realized on BiOCl/CuPc (copper phthalocyanine) composite from RhB (rhodamine B) solution under simulated solar light irradiation. The photosensitized RhB dye molecules supplied photo-generated holes which took part in the reaction of O-2 evolution. By loading CuPc, the efficiency of H-2 evolution is improved. On the base of the greatly enhanced photocurrent density, the considerable enhancement of performance can be attributed to the quick transfer of photogenerated electrons from the photosensitizer to the CB (conduction band) of BiOCl. Furthermore, as active electron traps, the oxygen vacancies on the surface of the BiOCl photocatalyst promote the separation efficiency of photo-generated electrons and holes, resulting in high photoactivity. This study presents a way that organic dye wastewater will be a useful system for the overall photocatalytic water splitting reaction to H-2 and O-2. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Here, the authors report structural dynamics of dual-site nickel-iron single-atom oxygen electrocatalysts under reaction conditions, and proposes a dual-site pathway for the water oxidation reaction.Single-atom catalysts with maximum metal utilization efficiency show great potential for sustainable catalytic applications and fundamental mechanistic studies. We here provide a convenient molecular tailoring strategy based on graphitic carbon nitride as support for the rational design of single-site and dual-site single-atom catalysts. Catalysts with single Fe sites exhibit impressive oxygen reduction reaction activity with a half-wave potential of 0.89 V vs. RHE. We find that the single Ni sites are favorable to promote the key structural reconstruction into bridging Ni-O-Fe bonds in dual-site NiFe SAC. Meanwhile, the newly formed Ni-O-Fe bonds create spin channels for electron transfer, resulting in a significant improvement of the oxygen evolution reaction activity with an overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). We further reveal that the water oxidation reaction follows a dual-site pathway through the deprotonation of *OH at both Ni and Fe sites, leading to the formation of bridging O-2 atop the Ni-O-Fe sites.									26	0	0	0	1	0	26				2041-1723		WOS:000700360600018	34552084

Herein, we combined experimental research with first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) to engineer the NiCo2S4@NiFe LDH heterostructure interface for enhancing overall water-splitting activity. The DFT calculations exhibit strong interaction and charge transfer between NiCo2S4 and NiFe LDH, which change the interfacial electronic structure and surface reactivity. The calculated chemisorption free energy of hydroxide (triangle E-OH) is reduced from 1.56 eV for pure NiFe LDH to 1.03 eV for the heterostructures, indicating a dramatic improvement in OER performance, while the chemisorption free energy of hydrogen (triangle E-H) maintains almost invariable. By the use of the facile hydrothermal method, NiCo2S4 nanotubes, NiFe LDH nanosheets, and NiCo2S4@NiFe LDH heterostructures are prepared on nickel foam, of which the corresponding experimental OER overpotentials are 306, 260, and 201 mV at 60 mA cm(-2), respectively. These results are good agreement with the theoretical predictions. Meanwhile, the HER performance has little improvement, with an overpotential of about 200 mV at 10 mA. cm(-2). Due dramatic improvement in OER performance, there was an enhancement in the overall water-splitting activity of the NiCo2S4@ NiFe LDH heterostructures, with a low voltage of 1.6 V.									341	14	0	0	17	0	344			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000401307100016	28332812

In this study, we demonstrate a strategy to improve the OER performance of Ni3S2. The effect of addition of different FeCl2 contents during the hydrothermal process on the OER activity is systematically evaluated. We found that all samples upon the addition of FeCl2 produced Fe-doped Ni3S2 and FeS2 to form a nanocomposite. Their OER performances strongly depend on the amount of FeCl2, where the NSF-0.25 catalyst with 0.25 mmol FeCl2 added during the hydrothermal synthesis shows the best OER performance. Its overpotential was 230 mV versus RHE and it achieves a high current density of 100 mA.cm(-2), which was much lower than that of pristine Ni3S2 (320 mV) or RuO2 (370 mV) as the benchmark OER catalyst. The postcharacterizations reveal that NSF-0.25 has gone through an in situ phase transformation into an Fe-NiOOH phase during the OER test. This study presents a simple method and a low-cost material to improve the OER performance with in situ formation of oxyhydroxide.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000848492300001	36000887

Herein, a series of bifunctional composites with excellent electrochemical activity and durability based on platinum with the perovskite Sr(Co0.8Fe0.2)(0.95)P0.05O3-delta (SCFP) are synthesized via a facile but effective strategy. The optimal sample Pt-SCFP/C-12 exhibits outstanding bifunctional activity for the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction with a potential difference of 0.73 V. Remarkably, the Zn-air battery based on this catalyst shows an initial discharge and charge potential of 1.25 and 2.02 V at 5 mA cm(-2), accompanied by an excellent cycling stability. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near-edge structure, and extended X-ray absorption fine structure experiments demonstrate that the superior performance is due to the strong electronic interaction between Pt and SCFP that arises as a result of the rapid electron transfer via the Pt-O-Co bonds as well as the higher concentration of surface oxygen vacancies. Meanwhile, the spillover effect between Pt and SCFP also can increase more active sites via lowering energy barrier and change the rate-determining step on the catalysts surface. Undoubtedly, this work provides an efficient approach for developing low-cost and highly active catalysts for wider application of electrochemical energy devices.									69	4	0	0	4	0	68			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000502603300001

The oxidation of water to dioxygen is a 4H(+)/4e(-) process, while oxygen can be fully reduced to water by a 4e(-)/4H(+) process or partially reduced by fewer electrons to reactive oxygen species such as H2O2 and O-2(-). We demonstrate that a novel manganese corrole complex behaves as a bifunctional catalyst for both the electrocatalytic generation of dioxygen as well as the reduction of dioxygen in aqueous media. Furthermore, our combined kinetic, spectroscopic, and electrochemical study of manganese corroles adsorbed on different electrode materials (down to a submolecular level) reveals mechanistic details of the oxygen evolution and reduction processes.									96	5	0	0	11	0	95			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000369970500006	26773287

Importantly, the CoBDC-NF-NH3-650 possesses an outstanding stability with negligible potential attenuation after 60 h continuous electrolysis. Experimental results reveal that edge carbon defects and the synergistic effect between Co NPs and N-doped carbon attribute to the impressive OER activity of CoBDC-NF-NH3-650.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000779472700001

We report here that doping NiCoOOH nanosheets with 8% Ir leads to a low overpotential of only 260 mV for 50 mA/cm(2), far better than previous OER catalysts. We synthesized this catalyst using a novel photochemical deposition method that leads to a uniform distribution of dopant, large catalytic active area, high interfacial charge transfer efficiency, good adhesion between catalyst and matrix, and long lifetime. Moreover, these nanosheets show significant stable performance for 70 h in alkaline media. Our density functional theory calculations show that Ir and Co both play essential bifunctional roles in stabilizing the key O radical intermediate on Ir and promoting the O-O bond coupling on Co, which are optimum for the 8% Ir.									22	1	0	0	0	0	22			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000560728400011

The results revealed that CaS was oxidized to CaSO4 directly, with a small amount of CaO and SO2 being formed during the induction period. However, the product CaSO4 further reacted with the reactant CaS via a solid-solid reaction to form more CaO and SO2. The influences of oxygen concentration and temperature on the conversion ratio and the conversion rate of CaSO4 are discussed. From the SO2 evolution rate, the transient selectivity of CaSO4 for CaS oxidation was also obtained, along with the CaSO4 yield and the selectivity of regeneration reaction. The optimum conditions are as follows: the air reactor should be between 970℃ and 1000℃ and at a high oxygen concentration to prevent SO2 emission. Thus, improved selectivity of the CaSO4 regeneration reaction and a relatively high reaction rate could be obtained.			在热重和红外联用进行等温实验的基础上,探讨了氧体积分数为10%、20%,970～1150℃温度范围内化学链燃烧过程中钙基载氧体再生(CaS)的氧化特性.结果显示,CaS氧化的直接产物主要为CaSO4,只有在诱导期生成极少量CaO和SO2;但CaSO4与CaS还可进一步反应,生成更多CaO和SO2.通过对氧气浓度和温度的实验条件改变,研究了CaSO4的转化率、转化速率,并辅以SO2析出速率分析,获得了CaSO4相对于CaO的瞬时选择性、CaSO4的收率和反应选择率.结果表明,钙基载氧体CaSO4再生过程氧化反应的适宜条件为温度970～1000℃以及较高的氧气气氛,这不仅可以抑制SO2的排放量从而得到较高的反应选择率,同时反应过程也具有较高的转化速率.						0	2	0	0	0	0	2			0253-2468			CSCD:3487267

The material was modified on the surface of glassy carbon electrode and applied to electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution in alkaline solution. Linear voltammetry, Tafel curve, AC impedance curve and stability test were carried out. The results show that MoS2/CoAlLDH prepared by two-step method, based on the interlayer confinement effect of hydrotalcite, with sodium molybdate as Mo source, thiourea as S source and hydrazine hydrate as reducing agent, has oxygen evolution activity.

However, the limited intrinsic activity of anodic electrocatalysts hinders the wide application of water splitting electrolyzers. To promote the electronic property of the anodic electrodes, enhancing the concentration of oxygen vacancies in electrocatalysts could effectively modulate the intrinsic electronic states and significantly accelerate the charge transfer ability of the electrocatalysts. Herein, a series of hierarchical FeNiW-layered double hydroxide (FeNiW-LDH) in situ growth on Fe foam are prepared via W doping into FeNi-LDH by an electrochemical corrosion engineering strategy. Remarkably, by virtue of excellent electronic conductivity and two-dimensional lamellar configuration, the representative FeNiW-LDH exhibits outstanding electrochemical activity for water oxidation with a low overpotential (eta(10) = 202 mV) and a small Tafel slope (55.7 mV dec(-1)). FeNiW-LDH could also maintain stability for 120 h at 300 mA cm(-2). Moreover, FeNiW-LDH in situ growth on Fe foam with a larger area (16 x 23 cm(2)) could be successfully prepared under laboratory conditions, which could facilitate the laboratory-made catalyst moving toward industrialization. The doping W into FeNi-LDH could significantly enhance the concentration of oxygen vacancies, which was proved by electron paramagnetic spectroscopy. In addition, theoretical calculations also demonstrated the oxygen vacancies efficiently tune the intrinsic electronic structure of FeNi-LDH and optimize the intermediates adsorption energy, accelerating the OER reaction kinetics.									43	2	0	0	5	0	43			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000618003500002

Herein, we report a facile means to prepare a selenide/sulfide hetero-structured NiCo2Se4/NiCoS4 catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), overall water splitting (OWS), and Zn-air batteries (ZABs). The NiCo2Se4/NiCoS4 heterostructure showed excellent OER and HER performance, evidenced by the small overpotential of 248 mV and 180 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER, and superior long-term stability to the benchmark IrO2 and Pt/C catalyst for OER and HER, respectively. It also exhibited a potential of 1.660 V @ 10 mA cm(-2) in the practical OWS test, close to the Pt/C IrO2 catalyst. Furthermore, when employed as air-cathode catalyst for ZABs, the NiCo2Se4/NiCoS4 modified battery exhibited the narrow charge-discharge voltage gap of 0.98 V @ 50 mA cm(-2) and a maximal specific capacity of 693.17 mA h g(-1), outperforming the IrO2 counterpart. Such excellent performance can be attributed to the advantageous structural merit of the NiCo2Se4 nanoflowers, and especially the heterostructure interfaces created in NiCo2Se4/NiCoS4, which significantly boosted the catalytic synergistic effects.

A challenge is to identify and collect surface active site relative to bulk. Here, we have prepared an ultrathin alpha-Co(OH)(2) nanosheet with large exposed surface Co sites as an high-efficiency O-2 evolution catalyst. Using XAFS technique, we have investigated the oxidation state and local structural evolutions of the alpha-Co(OH)(2) nanosheets catalyst. A coordination-miss Co sites (CoO6-x) with oxidation state of +3.3 on the nanosheet surface is revealed after the OER procedure, indicating the in situ formation of gamma-CoOOH nanosheet is a key factor leading to an enhanced water oxidation performance.					16th International Conference on X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS)16th International Conference on X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS)	AUG 23-28, 2015AUG 23-28, 2015		Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Karlsruhe, GERMANYKarlsruhe Inst Technol, Karlsruhe, GERMANY	12	0	0	0	3	0	12			1742-6588		*****************	WOS:000383249000129

Crystalline Cobalt Oxide Films for Sustained Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution under Strongly Acidic Conditions								CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS				29	3			950	957		10.1021/acs.chemmater.6b02879				FEB 14 2017	2017	Earth-abundant materials capable of catalyzing the electrochemical decomposition of water into molecular hydrogen and oxygen are necessary components of many affordable water-splitting technologies. However, water oxidation catalysts that facilitate sustained oxygen evolution at device-relevant current densities in strongly acidic electrolytes have been limited almost exclusively to precious metal oxides. Here, we show that nanostructured films of cobalt oxide (Co3O4) on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates, made by first depositing Co onto FTO and heating in air at 400 degrees C to produce films having a robust electrical and mechanical Co3O4/FTO interface, function as active electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 0.5 M H2SO4. The Co3O4/FTO electrodes evolve oxygen with near-quantitative Faradaic yields and maintain a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) for over 12 h at a moderate overpotential of 570 mV. At lower current densities that require lower overpotentials, sustained oxygen production for several days and weeks can be achieved.									112	4	0	0	8	0	115			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000394924100010

This is achieved by kinetic control: with forward reactions being faster than competing, energy-wasteful reactions. This requires appropriate cofactor spacing, driving forces and reorganizational energies. These features evolved in ancestral enzymes in a low O-2 environment. When O-2 appeared, energy-converting enzymes had to deal with its troublesome chemistry. Various protective mechanisms duly evolved that are not directly related to the enzymes' principal redox roles. These protective mechanisms involve fine-tuning of reduction potentials, switching of pathways and the use of short circuits, back-reactions and side-paths, all of which compromise efficiency. This energetic loss is worth it since it minimises damage from reactive derivatives of O-2 and thus gives the organism a better chance of survival. We examine photosynthetic reaction centres, bc(1) and b(6)f complexes from this view point. In particular, the evolution of the heterodimeric PSI from its homodimeric ancestors is explained as providing a protective back-reaction pathway. This "sacrifice-of-efficiency-for-protection" concept should be generally applicable to bioenergetic enzymes in aerobic environments. (C) 2012 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

Herein, a novel 3D self-supported Ni-Mo-S nanowire network film electrode was prepared by facile electroplating nickel-molybdenum on nickel foam followed by sulfurization as bifunctional catalysts for both HER and OER. Electrochemical measurements reveal that superb high catalytic activity and durability is acquired on the Ni-Mo-S electrode, which can afford an electrocatalytic current density of 100mAcm(-2) with an overpotential of 290mV for the HER and an overpotential of 390mV for the OER in alkaline medium. Coupled with the superior and robust OER catalytic activity, an alkaline electrolyzer that can achieve 100mAcm(-2) at a cell voltage of 2.0V was constructed by applying Ni-Mo-S parallel to Ni-Mo-S for overall water splitting, thus indicating a homogeneous, cost-effective, and earth-abundant material system for highly efficient H-2 production.									41	2	0	0	3	0	41			2196-0216			WOS:000422673500017

Nano-sized RuO2/SnO2 composites of different mass ratios of RuO2 to SnO2 (0.45:1, 0.67:1, and 1.07:1) were synthesized using solution-based hydrothermal method. The physicochemical properties of the RuO2/SnO2 were studied by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. The electrochemical activity of RuO2/SnO2 as anode electrocatalyst was investigated in a proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis cell of Pt/C cathode and Nafion membrane. Experimental results showed that RuO2/SnO2 of ratio (1.07:1) exhibit higher electrochemical activity compared to pure RuO2, resulting -50% reduction of noble metal content. The extended life test of electrocatalysts for 240 h implied that RuO2/SnO2 (1.07:1) significantly improved the stability of electrode in comparison to pure RuO2 in oxygen evolution processes.

In addition to evolution of water (320-920 K and 1020-1120 K) and carbon dioxide (340-1120 K), four distinct oxygen evolution peaks were observed from 900 to 1600 K; this oxygen evolution can be ascribed to the successive reduction of chromium ions in second phases which were estimated as about 1 mol% of Ca-5 (CrO4)(3) or 2 mol% of Ca-3(CTO4)(2). With the aid of available phase diagrams, a peak of simultaneous water and oxygen evolution at 1020-1120 K was attributed to the decomposition of an intermediate reaction compound, Ca-5(CTO4)(3)OH. Similarly, the water evolution at 320-920 K and CO2 evolution can be ascribed to the decomposition of hydrated calcium chromates, CaCrO4 . nH(2)O and calcium carbonate which were considered to be formed as reaction products of Ca-5(CrO4)(3) with water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide. These features were discussed in relation to the sintering behavior of chromium deficient lanthanum calcium chromite.					30th Anniversary Conference of the Japan-Society-of-Calorimetry-and-Thermal-Analysis30th Anniversary Conference of the Japan-Society-of-Calorimetry-and-Thermal-Analysis	OCT 31-NOV 02, 1994OCT 31-NOV 02, 1994	Japan Soc Calorimetry & Thermal AnalJapan Soc Calorimetry & Thermal Anal	OSAKA, JAPANOSAKA, JAPAN	2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0040-6031			WOS:A1995TP18600012

Yet it remains a great challenge. By means of first-principles calculations, we have studied the OER, ORR and HER catalytic activity of Mo2B2 MBene-supported single-atom catalysts (SACs) by embedding a series of transition metal atoms in the Mo vacancy (TM@Mo2B2, TM = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and Cu) as electrocatalysts. All TM@Mo2B2 SACs show excellent metallic conductivity, which would be favorable for the charge transfer in electrocatalytic reactions. Importantly, Ni@Mo2B2 can be used as a HER/OER bifunctional electrocatalyst with a lower vertical bar Delta G(H)vertical bar (-0.09 eV) for the HER under 1/4H coverage and a lower overpotential (eta(OER) = 0.52 V) than that of IrO2 (eta(OER) = 0.56 V) for the OER, while Cu@Mo2B2 can be used as an OER/ORR bifunctional electrocatalyst with a lower overpotential (eta(OER) = 0.31 V) than that of IrO2 (eta(OER) = 0.56 V) and RuO2 (eta(OER) = 0.42 V) for the OER and a lower overpotential of 0.34 V than that of Pt (eta(ORR) = 0.45 V) for the ORR, for both of which the transition metal atoms serve as the active sites. This work could open up an avenue for the development of non-noble-metal-based bifunctional MBene electrocatalysts.									67	2	0	0	3	0	65			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000607307900027

In this work, we reported that the CuS flower-like superstructure microspheres with a solid core (CuS-FSMs) were prepared by a facile hydrolysis method without a template or surfactant. The novel CuS-FSM material showed a well-define solid core of approximately 300-500 nm and a loose shell of 0.5-1 mu m. More importantly, the loose shell of the CuS-FSMs was constructed of graphene-like CuS nanosheets (CuS-GN). The formation mechanism indicated that the CuS-FSMs were firstly formed on the surface of hexagonal prism-shaped Cu-3(TAA)(3)Cl-3 precursors, and then the well-defined solid core was produced through the Ostwald ripening of CuS-GN. The electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction was employed as a probe reaction to gain insight into the properties of CuS-FSMs, which exhibited a high limiting current density of 92.4 mAcm(-2) and stability in 1 M KOH electrolyte.									32	1	0	0	3	0	32			2196-0216			WOS:000423803900012

Nonprecious transition metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are one of the most promising precursors for developing advanced functional catalysts with high porosity and structural rigidity. Herein, a new transition metal-based hollow multivoid nanocuboidal catalyst synthesized from a ternary Ni-Co-Fe (NCF)-MOF precursor is rationally designed to produce dual-functionality toward OER and HER. Differing ion exchanging rates of the ternary transition metals within the prussian blue analog MOF precursor are exploited to produce interconnected internal voids, heteroatom doping, and a favorably tuned electronic structure. This design strategy significantly increases active surface area and pathways for mass transport, resulting in excellent electroactivities toward OER and HER, which are competitive with recently reported single-function nonprecious catalysts. Moreover, outstanding electrochemical durability is realized due to the unique rigid and interconnected porous structure which considerably retains initial rapid charge transfer and mass transport of active species. The MOF-based material design strategy demonstrated here exemplifies a novel and versatile approach to developing non-noble electrocatalysts with high activity and durability for advanced electrochemical water-splitting systems.									192	13	0	0	10	0	192			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000437829800029

Herein, by density functional theory, the performance of dual-metal-organic frameworks M2-BTC (M2 = Ni2, Fe2, Co2, FeNi, CoNi, FeCo) as bifunctional electrocatalysts to catalyze oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is investigated. All M2-BTC are proved to possess satisfactory thermodynamical stability. For ORR, FeNi-Ni, Ni2-BTC, Co2-BTC, and CoNi-Ni are confirmed to have high activity with corresponding overpotential of 0.40, 0.25, 0.31, and 0.28 V, respectively, which are both better than Pt(111) (eta ORR = 0.45 V). For OER, Fe2-BTC, Ni2-BTC, Co2-BTC, and CoNi-Ni show excellent catalytic activity, with the overpotential of 0.42, 0.38, 0.22, and 0.31 V, respectively, which can be compared to RuO2(110) (eta OER = 0.37 V) or even better than it. According to the ORR/OER potential gap, Ni2-BTC, Co2-BTC, and CoNi-Ni are screened out to be ultrahigh-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts. The results of the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital confirm that the metal atom is the main active site, and the O atoms attached to the active metal also participate in the reaction. Density of states analysis indicates that the different catalytic performance of M2-BTC is caused by the variety of electronic structures.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000797336200003

Here, this study reports a carbon-based composite co-doped with nitrogen and trace amount of metallic cobalt (1 at%) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting at low overpotential and high current density. An excellent electrochemical activity of the newly developed electrocatalyst originates from its graphitic nanostructure and highly active Co-N-x sites. In the case of carefully optimized sample of this electrocatalyst, 10 mA cm(-2) current density can be achieved for two half reactions in alkaline solutions-hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction-at low overpotentials of 220 and 350 mV, respectively, which are smaller than those previously reported for nonprecious metal and metal-free counterparts. Based on the spectroscopic and electrochemical investigations, the newly identified Co-N-x sites in the carbon framework are responsible for high electrocatalytic activity of the Co,N-doped carbon. This study indicates that a trace level of the introduced Co into N-doped carbon can significantly enhance its electrocatalytic activity toward water splitting.									92	3	0	0	4	0	92			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000383374800008	27246288

Compared with mono-metal-site catalysts, dual-metal-site catalysts exhibit higher efficiency for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to reduced energy barrier of the process involving proton-coupled multi-electron transfer. Herein, we construct dual-metal Fe-Co sites coordinated with nitrogen in graphene (FeCo-NG), which exhibits high OER performance with onset overpotential of only 126 mV and Tafel slope of 120 mV.dec(-1), showing that the rate-determining step is controlled by the single-electron transfer step. Theoretical calculations reveal that the FeN4 site exhibits lower OER overpotential than the CoN4 site due to appropriate adsorption energy of OOH* on the former, while the O* adsorbed on the adjacent Co site could stabilize the OOH* on the FeN4 site through hydrogen bond interaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000871179100013

Herein, with a composite catalyst of Au/Co-FeOOH, it was shown that the photo-irradiation could greatly activate the catalytic performance for OER due to the plasmon effect of Au nanoparticles. With 532 nm of photo-irradiation, the overpotential at 10 mA cm-2 for OER decreased from 386 to 309 mV with the optimized composite. It is believed that the two factors, hot electron exci-tation promoting the formation of active species and the charge transfer modulating the electronic struc-ture of active sites, are responsible for the enhancement of catalytic activity. These findings highlighted the possibility of activation of OER catalysis by photo-irradiation and would open up a new route for the design of advanced electrocatalysts.

In this work, the controllably synthesized NiCo-LDHs nanosheets are treated by Ar plasma and display superior activity as well as high durability for OER processes, where there is a much lower overpotential of 299 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a smaller Tafel slope of 45 mV dec(-1) as compared to the pristine material (347 mV and 149 mV dec(-1), respectively).

Nile blue was decorated on the surface of rGO by covalent bonds (using diazonium reaction). Then, NiONPs was immobilized on the surface of the functionalized rGO. The electrocatalytic and electrochemical behaviors of NiO@rGO and NiO@Nile/rGO nanocomposites for HER were investigated using cyclic voltanunetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in acidic and alkaline media. From them, NiO@rGO has shown long-term stability for HER in acidic solution at room temperature. The electrocatalytic activity of NiO@rGO (vs. NiO@Nile/rGO) for HER was greatly improved and its behavior was close to the behavior of platinum. In the next stage of our study, due to the importance of oxygen as an energy source, the production of oxygen molecules through electrochemical oxidation of water at NiO@rGO and NiO@Nile/rGO were studied too. For this purpose, the electrochemical behaviors of the nanocomposites for oxygen evolution reaction were investigated using cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in acidic and alkaline media. The results of them confirmed that NiO@Nile/rGO acts as an excellent electrocatalyst with good long-term stability for oxygen evolution reaction in 0.5 mol L-1 KOH solution at room temperature.Therefore, NiO@rGO and NiO@Nile/rGO can be used as powerful cathode and anode, respectively in an electrochemical cell for water splitting.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000431156900021

The instantaneous potential under AC interference was obtained by high-frequency acquisition with three-electrode system. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Tafel polarization curves were used to study the influence mechanism of AC interference on instantaneous potential.FindingsIt was concluded that the hydrogen evolution reaction could occur on X80 steel under AC interference. There were critical AC current densities of about 100 to 200 A/m2, beyond which the cathode reaction of X80 steel changed from oxygen absorption to hydrogen evolution. Besides the pH value, the initial polarization potential EZ and impedance module of the steel/electrolyte interface under AC interference were also the factors that affected the critical AC densities in different solutions.Originality/valueThis research quantified the hydrogen evolution capacity of X80 steel under AC interference, which could be applied to clear the effect of AC interference on hydrogen evolution reaction.									2	1	0	0	0	0	3			0003-5599	1758-4221		WOS:000511423600001

Herein, the rational design and synthesis of a new class of Co@N-C materials (C-MOF-C2-T) from a pair of enantiotopic chiral 3D MOFs by pyrolysis at temperature T is reported. The newly developed C-MOF-C2-900 with a unique 3D hierarchical rodlike structure, consisting of homogeneously distributed cobalt nanoparticles encapsulated by partially graphitized N-doped carbon rings along the rod length, exhibits higher electrocatalytic activities for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions (ORR and OER) than that of commercial Pt/C and RuO2, respectively. Primary Zn-air batteries based on C-MOF-900 for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) operated at a discharge potential of 1.30 V with a specific capacity of 741 mA h g(Zn)(-1) under 10 mA cm(-2). Rechargeable Zn-air batteries based on C-MOF-C2-900 as an ORR and OER bifunctional catalyst exhibit initial charge and discharge potentials at 1.81 and 1.28 V (2 mA cm(-2)), along with an excellent cycling stability with no increase in polarization even after 120 h - outperform their counterparts based on noble-metal-based air electrodes. The resultant rechargeable Zn-air batteries are used to efficiently power electrochemical water-splitting systems, demonstrating promising potential as integrated green energy systems for practical applications.									615	50	0	0	19	0	621			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000426720400010	29349841

Rigorous microkinetic analysis employing kinetic isotope effects, Tafel analysis, and temperature dependence measurement was conducted to establish rate expression isolated from the diffusion contribution of buffer ions and solution resistance. It was found that the OER kinetics was facile with OH- oxidation compared to H2O, the results of which were highlighted by mitigating over 200 mV overpotential in the presence of buffer to reach 10 mA cm(-2). This improvement was ascribed to the involvement of the kinetics of the local OH- supply by the buffering action. Further digesting the kinetic data at various buffer pK(a) and the solution bulk pH disclosed a trade-off between the exchange current density and the Tafel slope, indicating that the optimal electrolyte condition can be chosen at a different range of current density. This study provides a quantitative guideline for electrolyte engineering to maximize the intrinsic OER performance that electrocatalyst possesses especially at near-neutral pH.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000614603700001	33481326

Herein, a facile quenching approach is demonstrated that can simultaneously enable the required surface metal doping and vacancy generation in reconfiguring the desired surface of the NiCo2O4 catalyst, giving rise to greatly enhanced OER activities in both alkaline freshwater and seawater electrolytes. As a result, the quenched-engineered NiCo2O4 nanowire electrode achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 258 mV in 1 m KOH electrolyte, showing the remarkable catalytic performance towards OER. More impressively, the same electrode also displays extraordinary activity in an alkaline seawater environment and only needs 293 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the strong electronic synergies among the metal cations in the quench-derived catalyst, where the metal doping regulates the electronic structure, thereby yielding near-optimal adsorption energies for OER intermediates and giving rise to superior activity. This study provides a new quenching method to obtain high-performance transition metal oxide catalysts for freshwater/seawater electrocatalysis.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000726316700001	34862718

Herein, the authors propose a controllable dual interface engineering concept to design a noble-metal-free bifunctional catalyst with two well-designed interfaces (Ni3FeN|MnO and MnO|CNTs) via a simple etching and wet chemical route. The heterointerface between MnO and Ni3FeN facilitates the charge transfer rate during surface reaction, and heterointerface between MnO and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) support provides effective electron transfer path, while the CNTs matrix builds free diffusion channels for gas and electrolyte. Benefiting from the advantages of dual interfaces, Ni3FeN/MnO-CNTs show superior oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction catalytic activity with an ultralow polarization gap ( increment E) of 0.73 V, as well as preferable durability and rapid reaction kinetics. As proof of concept, the practical ZAB with Ni3FeN/MnO-CNT exhibits high power density of 197 mW cm(-2) and rate performance up to 40 mA cm(-2), as well as superior cycling stability over 600 cycles, outperforming the benchmark mixture of Pt/C and RuO2. This work proposes a controllable dual interface engineering concept toward regulating the charge, electron, and gas transfer to achieve efficient bifunctional catalysts for ZABs.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000722946600001	34837318

This paper proposes a hydrothermal method for synthesising Sn-doped CoOx(OH)(2(1-x)) (CoOx(OH)(2(1-x))-Sn(IV)). During the preparation process, the morphology of the precursor was controlled by an anionic surfactant. The precursor of the layered structure was mainly formed through the bonding of anionic group SO3H- in SDBS with metal cation Co2+, and the surface area and reaction sites of the precursor were clearly increased. Finally, CoOx(OH)(2(1-x))-Sn (IV) urchin-like spheres were hydrothermally synthesised. The current density of the CoOx(OH)(2(1-x))-Sn(IV) obtained at a potential of 1.95 V was 124.8 mA cm(-2), i.e. 2.8 times higher than that of the precursor (44.9 mA cm(-2)).

Herein, we propose a novel strategy to synthesize cobalt iron oxides (CoFe2O4) with different ordered mesoporous structure by using a facial hard template method. Benefiting from the ordered mesoporous structure, the optimized electrocatalyst achieved a small overpotential of 342 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) current density, a low Tafel slope of 57.1 mV dec(-1) in a 1 M KOH aqueous medium, and excellent stability for 15 h, which OER performance is the best after the comparison of lasted reported CoFe2O4-based electrocatalysts.

In this paper, we designed a GaAs quantum dot (QD)/TiO2 heterojunction with high performance of visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution based on first-principle calculations. The results show that six designed GaAs QDs are thermally stable at 300 K, and they have proper visible-light absorption except GaAs-12 QD. GaAs-20 QD maintains good stability at 350 K. Further investigations indicate that the interface Ga atoms in the GaAs-20/TiO2 heterojunction are active sites for photocatalytic reaction, and the type-II band alignment of the GaAs-20/TiO2 heterojunction can lead to effective separation of photoexcited electron-hole pairs. Moreover, the energy barrier of hydrogen production in GaAs-20/TiO2 is about 56% lower than that in TiO2, and oxygen vacancy in GaAs-20/TiO2 heterojunction could transform the hydrogen production from endothermic reaction into exothermic reaction, which has an obvious promotion effect on photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. In short, our calculations indicate that the GaAs-20/TiO2 heterojunction has high performance in visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2522-0128	2522-0136		WOS:000674204400001

Although much effort has been put into research on Li-O-2 batteries, little is known about the oxygen reduction and evolution in Mg2+-containing aprotic electrolytes. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the ORR in Mg2+-containing DMSO using RRDE and DEMS-techniques and derive a more general reaction mechanism of ORR in aprotic electrolytes using the results for Li+, Na+ and K+-containing DMSO. O-2 first reacts via an initial adsorption step to superoxide which, in the presence of Mg2+, is subsequently reduced to peroxide as the main reaction product. However, this product undergoes further reactions leading to a deactivation of the electrode. Regarding the reversibility, unfortunately no OER was observed and reactivation of the electrode proved difficult. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we fabricated bifunctional (Ni,Co)(0.85)Se/rGO with nanoporous structure via electrodeposition towards HzOR and OER. In comparison with (Ni,Co)(0.85)Se and NF, superior electrocatalytic activity and stability towards HzOR and OER were observed for (Ni,Co)(0.85)Se/rGO. The synergistic effects of (Ni,Co)(0.85)Se with rGO, high electrochemical surface area (ECSA), high electrical conductivity and the rapid release rate of bubbles from electrode surface induced by its superaerophobic result in superior performance of (Ni,Co)(0.85)Se/rGO. The OER process requires a low overpotential of 247 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and a high durability of 86.1% during 48 h long-term test at 10 mA cm(-2). When changing OER with HzOR, HzOR process can generate a high current density of 211 mA cm(-2) at a potential of 0.2 V vs RHE, and a high stability of 92.3% after 24 h test at a high current density of 50 mA cm(-2). This study displays a versatile, cost-effective and industrial strategy to produce highly active catalysts for bifunctional application.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000814691600001

The electrocatalytic activity of CoFe2O4 towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is clearly enhanced with a smaller size (3.1 nm) of the CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (compared with 4.5 and 5.9 nm). In addition, the catalytic activity is improved by partial substitution of Co with Ni, which also leads to a higher degree of inversion of the spinel structure. Theoretical calculations attribute the positive catalytic effect of Ni owing to the lower binding energy differences between adsorbed O and OH compared with pure cobalt or nickel ferrites, resulting in higher OER activity. Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 exhibited a low overpotential of approximately 340 mV at 10 mAcm(-2), a smaller Tafel slope of 51 mVdec(-1), and stability over 30 h. The unique tunability of these CoFe2O4 nanocrystals provides great potential for their application as an efficient and competitive anode material in the field of electrochemical water splitting as well as for systematic fundamental studies aiming at understanding the correlation of composition and structure with performance in electrocatalysis.									56	0	0	0	1	0	55			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000407221200013

Herein, we developed a facile and scalable vacuum vapor migration strategy to successfully prepare CoNi-N-C composite catalysts for bifunctional oxygen catalysis. This unique strategy enables the gaseous nickel species to be captured and anchored by CoCN substrates and the simultaneous pyrolysis process results in the generation of ultrafine CoNi nanoparticles (NPs) coupling with atomic Co-N-x-C moieties. CoNi NPs act as "solid-ligands" to modulate and activate Co-N-x active sites to accelerate the oxygen catalysis kinetics, delivering a remarkable bifunctional activity of Delta E of 0.71 V, far exceeding the precious metal Pt/C + Ir/C comparisons and most reported precious metal-free catalysts. Correspondingly, the CoNi-N-C based Zn-air battery exhibits excellent cyclability for over 200 hours with high voltage efficiency. Given the easy scale-up production and unique atom-nanoparticle composite sites, this work provides some insights for the rational synthesis of high-performance bifunctional oxygen catalysts for practical applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000742409000001

Herein, we report CuCo2S4 hollow nanoneedle arrays as efficient trifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting and aluminium-air batteries. CuCo2S4 hollow nanoneedle arrays are grown on Ni foam (NF) via a facile hydrothermal method. Benefiting from the porous and hollow structure to expose more active sites, the CuCo2S4/NF hollow nanoneedle arrays exhibit superior electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution (HER), oxygen evolution (OER), oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) in alkaline electrolytes. The corresponding experimental HER and OER overpotentials of CuCo2S4/NF catalyst are 61 mV and 189 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. In an assembled primary Al-air battery, the CuCo2S4/NF catalysts demonstrate an outstanding peak power density of 160 mW cm(-2) .

They usually possess high specific surface area, controllable porous structure, as well as physical and chemical stability. Due to the diversity of organic monomers and organic reactions, COFs and CMPs can be synthesized by designing suitable monomers and organic polymerization reactions for specific applications. In recent years, COFs and CMPs as functional materials have received extensive attention, and great progress have been made in electrochemical energy storage and conversion. In this review, we systematically sorted out the design principles of COFs and CMPs as lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and supercapacitors (SC) electrode materials, as well as water-splitting electrocatalysts. Subsequently, the latest advances in COFs and CMPs for energy storage and conversion systems were introduced from the perspective of synthesis strategies. Finally, we put forward the outlook and prospects of COFs and CMPs for LIBs, supercapacitors, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with high-efficiency.

A facile, surfactant-free, and gram-level biomass-assisted fast heating and cooling synthesis method is reported for synthesizing a series of carbon-encapsulated dense and uniform FeNi nanoalloys with a single-phase face-centered-cubic solid-solution crystalline structure and an average particle size of sub-5 nm. This method also enables precise control of both size and composition. Electrochemical measurements show that among FexNi(1-x) nanoalloys, Fe0.5Ni0.5 has the best performance. Density functional theory calculations support the experimental findings and reveal that the optimally positioned d-band center of O-covered Fe0.5Ni0.5 renders a half-filled antibonding state, resulting in moderate binding energies of key reaction intermediates. By increasing the total metal content from 25 to 60 wt%, the 60% Fe0.5Ni0.5/40% C shows an extraordinarily low overpotential of 219 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 23.2 mV dec(-1) for the oxygen evolution reaction, which are much lower than most other FeNi-based electrocatalysts and even the state-of-the-art RuO2. It also shows robust durability in an alkaline environment for at least 50 h. The gram-level fast heating and cooling synthesis method is extendable to a wide range of binary, ternary, quaternary nanoalloys, as well as quinary and denary high-entropy-alloy nanoparticles.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000853126000001	36089653

In this work, we designed a trimetallic nitride electrocatalyst in an unusual molecular sheet form, which was stabilized by metallic titanium carbide sheets. Besides the expected elevation in catalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction, the material simultaneously unlocked excellent catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction with the half-wave potential as small as 0.84 V. A flexible fiber-shaped zinc-air battery, employing the designed electrocatalyst as the air cathode and a gel as the electrolyte, demonstrated an enhanced and durable electrochemical performance, outputting a competitive energy density of 627 Wh kg(zn)(-1). This work opens new avenues for utilizing two-dimensional sheets in future wearable and portable device applications.									45	2	0	0	1	0	46			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000526413400089	32208665

This work developed a facile emulsion aggregation strategy to synthesize coral-like carbon-wrapped NiCo alloy (Co0.5Ni0.5/rGO) with high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The effect of alloy composition and GO content on the OER activity was evaluated in the 1 mol L-1 KOH solution. The OER mechanism of the Co0.5Ni0.5/rGO catalyst was disclosed by X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption spectra (MS). The emulsion containing amphipathic graphene oxide (GO) and hydrophobic nickel/cobalt complexes induces the formation of the carbon-wrapped nanostructure. The coral-like Co0.5Ni0.5/rGO catalyst exhibits the low overpotential of 288 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and good durability, both of which are superior to the standard RuO2. The synergistic effect between nickel and cobalt effectively regulates the electronic structure and OER activity of the alloy catalysts. Moreover, the interaction between NiCo alloys and carbon shells can reduce the interfacial resistance. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

However, the overpotential in water-splitting is high due to the harsh oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Therefore, effective catalysts which are low-cost and easy to prepare are urgently needed to stimulate the reaction. Herein we constructed 3D CoS nanosheets arrays on nickel foam through a combination of electrodeposition and sulfidation. The as-prepared catalyst can catalyze OER efficiently with an overpotential of 297 mV to generate 10 mA cm(-2) current density in 1 M KOH and is able to maintain excellent performance over 40 h without obvious degradation.

In this work, we performed density functional theory calculations to systematically explore the exfoliation properties of 14 MAlB phases and their water splitting and N-2 reduction reaction (NRR) performances. Results showed a linear relationship between the binding energy and exfoliation energy with the coefficient (R-2) of 0.95, indicating that the lower the binding energy of element Al in MAlB (M2AlB2), the higher the exfoliation energy required to synthesize monolayer MB from MAlB (M2AlB2). NiB (B site) was predicted to possess the best electrocatalytic activity for water splitting, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) among the studied MBenes, and overpotentials on the NiB surface were calculated to be 0.08 V (for HER) and 0.37 V (for OER), respectively. The electronic properties and dynamic simulations indicated that NiB is the best candidate catalyst for water splitting. Conversely, the Fe site on FeB (FeB-Fe) was predicated to have the highest nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) activity among the studied MBenes, with the overpotential eta(NRR) of 0.11 V. Furthermore, the B site of TaB (TaB-B) was identified as the best NRR catalyst against HER among the studied MBenes considering the HER side reaction.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000632849700025	33705501

Although anodic deposition is beneficial for its preparation, anodically deposited nickel iron oxide presents poor performance, and the detailed mechanism of its formation is ambiguous, limiting its extensive applications. In this study, we examined the anodic deposition of nickel iron oxide using electroanalytical techniques combined with an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance. In particular, the effects of anions were investigated to determine whether the formation of a nickel iron oxide film sensitively depends on the counter anions of the metal precursors. The anions not only provide buffering to retain the solution pH but also play a significant role in scavenging the surface protons to facilitate the growth of the catalyst film. We established a modified protocol to anodically deposit nickel iron oxide electrocatalysts excellent for water oxidation, with the best ever reported performance. These findings presented important but previously neglected aspects of anodic deposition, providing implications for nonprecious metal electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000809899400007

Herein, we report that the commercially available FeNiCo alloy can be converted to a highly active electrocatalyst for OER by galvanostatic anodizing in a fluoride-containing ethylene glycol electrolyte. Anodizing of the alloy develops a porous film consisting of the (FeNiCo)F-2 phase, which is readily converted to a highly active porous oxyhydroxide during anodic polarization in a KOH electrolyte. The anodized alloy exhibits high activity and high durability for OER with an overpotential as low as 0.26 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The present study demonstrates that a simple and cost-effective anodizing process can be used to form a highly active OER electrode from a low-cost, practical, iron-based alloy. In addition, we found that fluorides containing Fe, Ni, and Co are excellent precursors for the formation of oxyhydroxides exhibiting high OER activity and durability.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2168-0485			WOS:000675465900034

The electrocatalytic performance towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium was investigated. The results demonstrate that the OER activity improvement is mainly related to the increased interlayer distance from 0.76 nm to 2.49 nm depending on the intercalated amount of SDS in Ni2Fe-LDH, and resulting in the enhanced superior surface characteristics (e.g., larger specific surface area, bigger pore size and pore volume). Among all the samples, the Ni2Fe-SDS-LDH/CFP (molar ratio SDS/Fe = 1.5) showed the best OER performance (eta@10 mA cm(-2) = 289 mV, Tafel slope = 39 mV dec(-1)) comparable with the commercial IrO2 catalyst, which corresponded to the largest interlayer space of 2.49 nm.

However, the combined effect of interlayer expansion and partial exfoliation on the catalytic activity is yet to be investigated. Herein, scalable synthesis of partially exfoliated citrate-intercalated NiFe LDHs with tunable interlayer space have been achieved. The effect of citrate concentration on the phase, morphology, surface elemental composition, electronic states of surface metals, and electrochemical properties are comprehensively studied. The unique structure results in improved intrinsic catalytic activity and abundant active edge sites for oxygen evolution reaction. The optimal NiFe LDHs show an overpotential of 225 mV at 10 mA cmz, which is much smaller than that (-305 mV) of the singlelayer NiFe LDH nanosheets reported in the literature. The high catalytic activity can be mainly attributed to the combined effect between the enlarged interlayer space and the partial exfoliation/nanosheet thickness. That is, the interlayer space is related to the reaction kinetics/mechanism, while the degree of exfoliation affects the magnitude of the current density at a certain potential.

Electrochemical measurements performed under enforced electrolyte flow provide information on the electrochemical and electrocatalytic properties of these electrodes, in particular on the reversibility of the ORR/OER both in the absence and in the presence of Mg3+ in the electrolyte, and on the build-up of a reaction inhibiting passivation layer (solid-electrolyte interphase). Further information on the nature of the deposits and their dependence both on the electrode material and on the potential cycling conditions is derived from scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements performed ex situ after the electrochemical measurements.

However, most electrocatalysts do not simultaneously possess optimal HER/OER activities and their electrical conductivities are intrinsically low, which limit the development of overall water splitting. In this paper, a strategy of electric field treatment is proposed and applied to Ni/Co3O4 film to develop a novel bifunctional electrocatalyst. After treated by electric field, the conductive channels consisting of oxygen vacancies are formed in the Co3O4 film, which remarkably reduces the resistance of the system by almost 2 x 10(4) times. Meanwhile, the surface Ni metal electrode is partially oxidized to nickel oxide, which enhances the catalytic activity. The electric-field-treated Ni/Co3O4 material exhibits super outstanding performance of HER, OER, and overall water splitting, and the catalytic activity is significantly superior to the state-of-the-art noble metal catalysts (Pt/C, RuO2, and RuO2 parallel to Pt/C couple). This work provides an effective and feasible method for the development of novel and efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst, which is also promising for wide use in the field of catalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000829052600001	35869313

However, how to further increase the number of catalytic active sites and improve the electrocatalytic activity in alkaline solution is always a great challenge. Therefore, it is necessary to develop high-performance OER electrocatalysts. Herein, the coupled interfacial nanostructure of Fe3O4 and CoO was successfully supported on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as a highly efficient OER electrocatalyst (denoted as Fe3O4/CoO CNTs) through a simple and feasible two-step synthesis strategy. It is found that the electrocatalyst Fe3O4/CoO CNTs shows remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward OER with a low overpotential of 270 mV (i.e., 1.50 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode) at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 59 mV dec(-1) in basic media. Additionally, it presents superior electrochemical stability for over 45 h. The outstanding OER performance of the electrocatalyst is mainly derived from the coupled interfacial nanostructure between Fe3O4 and CoO, which promotes the improvement of the electronic structure, increases the number of catalytic active sites, and creates abundant oxygen vacancies. Our work provides a good choice for the future application of TMO-based electrocatalysts in water splitting.									25	1	0	0	2	0	25			2168-0485			WOS:000518088700031

Herein, Ni2P nanosheet arrays directly grown on three-dimensional (3D) Ni foam (NiP/NF) are fabricated by hydrothermal treatment of metallic Ni foam with H2O2 solution and subsequent phosphidation with NaH2PO2. The NiP/NF as electrocatalyst exhibits superior activities for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Most importantly, employing both as the cathode and anode for an alkaline water electrolyzer, NiP/NF only requires a cell voltage of 1.63 V to reach a current density of 10 mV cm(-2), together with stronger durability. Preliminary catalytic information suggests that the tailored 3D superstructure and integrated electrode configurations afford improved active sties and enhanced electron/mass transfer, responding for the outstanding activity and stability.

Three-dimension (3D) porous Ni/Ni8P3 and Ni/Ni9S8 electrodes are prepared by sequential treatment of commercial Ni-foam with acid activation, followed by phosphorization or sulfurization. The resultant materials can act as self-supported bifunctional electrocatalytic electrodes for direct water splitting with excellent activity toward oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline media. Stable performance can be maintained for at least 24 h, illustrating their versatile and practical nature for clean energy generation. Furthermore, an advanced water electrolyzer through exploiting Ni/Ni8P3 as both anode and cathode is fabricated, which requires a cell voltage of 1.61 V to deliver a 10 mA cm(-2) water splitting current density in 1.0 M KOH solution. This performance is significantly better than that of the noble metal benchmark-integrated Ni/IrO2 and Ni/Pt-C electrodes. Therefore, these bifunctional electrodes have significant potential for realistic large-scale production of hydrogen as a replacement clean fuel to polluting and limited fossil-fuels.									716	39	0	0	25	0	720			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000377593000015

In this work, we study two kinds of core-shell structured electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid and alkali electrolyte. The electrocatalyst of cobalt@cobalt phosphide nanoparticles is grown on carbon nanotubes (Co@CoP/CNT) and shows a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at an overpotential of 67 mV in acid and 125 mV in alkali, demonstrating the strong metal-metal phosphide interaction facil-itating hydrogen reduction. However, the in situ formed cobalt@cobalt oxide (Co@Co3O4/CNT) electro-catalysts from the Co@CoP/CNT can retard both the HER and OER performances through the metal-metal oxide interaction. The underlying mechanisms of the activity and selectivity of the core-shell catalysts towards water splitting reactions is further unveiled by density functional theory (DFT) simulation. The different catalytic behaviors of the core-shell structured catalysts in HER and OER are attributed to the different interactions between the metallic cores, shells and the adsorbed intermediate species. This study not only promises a facile and general strategy to fabricate high performance electrocatalysts but also sheds new light on crucial design principles of catalyst materials for intermediate-selective electrocatalytic reactions.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

However, the bulk NiFe LDHs with less exposed active sites limit the improvement of the electrocatalytic activity. Herein, an oxygen vacancy (O-vac) -enriched surface for NiFe LDHs on nickel foam (Ce asst-NiFe LDHs/NF) was obtained by cerium (III) ion as an assistant reagent via a hydro-thermal approach. Note that Ce3+ ions were verified without residue at the as-resulted Ce asst-NiFe LDHs/NF after the sediment centrifuging. Ce3+ was here readily adsorbed on the surface of NiFe LDHs during the synthetic process, reducing their thickness (similar to 6 nm). In addition, Ce3+ with a lower electronegativity competes with Ni2+ and Fe3+, inducing increase for O-vac near metal active sites on the surface of NiFe LDHs. The Ce asst-NiFe LDHs/NF electrocatalyst with enriched O-vac has exhibited extremely electrocatalytic activity for OER at the low potential with only 246 mV to achieve 200 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. The favorable stability of 18 h at the current density of 50 mA cm(-2) increases with only similar to 0.2% potential. Our research paves the way to designing highly active surface of NiFe LDHs OER catalysts.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000701318100003

In this report, we described the development of a facile route to the production of highly defective photocatalysts. Firstly, organic species were bound onto the surface of a metal oxide semiconductor catalyst, followed by a relatively low temperature ageing in N-2, to remove the organics and to attract oxygen molecules from the surface, generating oxygen vacancies. In particular, we introduced a co-catalyst during the syntheses, which acted as a thermocatalyst to promote full oxidation of the organics, leaving more oxygen vacancies at the surface and to form intimate heterojunctions with host-catalysts to further drive the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The hydrogen evolution rate for our developed NiO-TiO2 defective heterojunctions in a sacrificial system was measured at ca. 1.41 mmol g(-)1 h(-1), which was much higher than those of comparable catalysts reported in the literature (that generally display hydrogen evolution rates < 0.4 mmol g(-1) h(-1)). Computational simulation, together with other analytical techniques, suggested that the generated surface oxygen vacancies could induce a series of impurity energy levels within the VBM and CBM of TiO2 that narrowed the electron transmission gap in the TiO2 and acted as active sites for the reaction between adsorbed H2O and photoinduced trapped electrons to produce H-2.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000415990800041

Air electrode is a key part of ZABs, where oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) appear during discharge and charge processes which largely determine the performance, such as durability, rate performance and round-trip efficiency. However, the sluggish kinetics of ORR/OER may cause high cell overpotential, thus requiring certain electrocatalyst to speed up both reactions. Based on several considerations, such as cost, activity, stability, and conductivity, metal-free carbon materials have received considerable attentions as electrocatalysts of air electrode in ZABs to boost both OER and ORR. In this review article, the recent progress in applying metal-free carbon materials as air electrode in ZABs is summarized. The two main ways to tune the properties of carbon materials and eventually the catalytic performance for ORR and OER, i.e., heteroatom doping (N, P, B, S, F, etc.) and defect engineering, are focused. The performance indicators of ZABs based on the carbon materials were also tabulated. Finally, the latest challenges and future opportunities associated with metal-free carbon materials as air electrode in ZABs are discussed.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0025-5408	1873-4227		WOS:000652836900027

ZABs have attracted great studies attentions because of their excessive energy density, high abundance of zinc, value-effectiveness, and high safety, in addition to low-level of pollutants. However, technical challenges associated with sluggish rates of oxygen reactions have not begun to be resolved. In this review, ZAB configuration and basic aspects of oxygen electrochemistry of the air electrode are in short delivered first. Then, the latest improvement in engineering of oxygen electrocatalysts for ZABs is specific mentioned following four aspects: precious metals/alloys, transition metal, transition-metal oxides (perovskites, single/mixed-metal oxides, and spinels), and carbon-based materials. Finally, challenges and future perspectives of engineering of bifunctional catalysts for ZABs with high catalytic activity and durability are recommended. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Unfortunately, current electrocatalysts toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are far from satisfactory because of lacking reasonable design and assembly protocols. A type of 1-nm molybdenum carbide nanoparticles confined in mesh-like nitrogen-doped carbon (Mo2C@NC nanomesh) with high specific surface area is reported here. In addition to the superior ORR performance comparable to platinum, the catalyst offers a high HER activity with small Tafel slope of 33.7 mV dec(-1) and low overpotential of 36 mV to reach -10 mA cm(-2). Theoretical calculations indicate that the active sites of the catalyst are mainly located at Mo atoms adjacent to the N-doped carbon layer, which contributes the high HER activity. These findings show the great potential of Mo2C species in wide electrocatalysis applications.									67	4	0	0	1	0	69			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000431614500002

Therefore, appropriate design of highly active and stable non-noble metal oxygen evolu-tion electrocatalyst with good electronic structure and multilevel structure is both a goal and a challenge. Here, we report a Fe-Ni2P electrocatalyst (NiFeP-MOF) with multilevel structure, which was obtained by anion exchange on the basis of Fe-Ni(OH)2 (NiFe-MOF) grown on nickel foam in situ by solvothermal method. As expected, Fe substitution regu-lates the Ni oxidation state in the NiFeP-MOF and realizes electronic structure coupling, showing a highly active and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolyte solution. Specifically, the NiFeP-MOF demonstrates an ultralow overpotentials (232 mV, 10 mA cm-2; 267 mV 100 mA cm-2), respectively, an extremely small Tafel slope (34 mV dec-1). Separately, the electrocatalyst shows an excellent cycle stability at 10 mA cm-2 for 12 h (43,200 s).

Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) has been investigated as an accurate method for the determination of the potential at which nickel hydroxide formulations evolve oxygen. Oxygen evolution from a variety of nickel hydroxide substrate electrodes in KOH was studied in situ by SECM. The SECM probe tip, positioned just above the substrate surface, was used to detect the oxygen evolved while cyclic voltammetry was also performed on the substrate, thus separating the detection of oxygen evolution from the nickel hydroxide oxidation process. A range of supporting substrates were investigated: conducting glass (indium tin oxide), glassy carbon, and nickel metal, with either nickel hydroxide formulations pasted or microparticles abrasively attached onto the support. Graphite, as a conductive additive to Ni(OH)(2) paste formulations, gave more positive oxygen-evolution overpotentials than similar formulations containing filamentous nickel as the conductive additive. Unmilled nickel hydroxide samples outperformed milled samples; higher rates of oxygen evolution and lower capacities were obtained from the milled nickel hydroxide samples as determined by SECM and high-rate charge/discharge cycling measurements.

The design of DACs, however, remains cost-prohibitive for both experimental and computational studies, due to their huge design space. Herein, by means of density functional theory (DFT) and topological information-based machine-learning (ML) algorithms, we present a data-driven high-throughput design principle to evaluate the stability and activity of 16 767 DACs for oxygen evolution (OER) and oxygen reduction (ORR) reactions. The rational design reveals 511 types of DACs with OER activity superior to IrO2 (110), 855 types of DACs with ORR activity superior to Pt (111), and 248 bifunctional DACs with high catalytic performance for both OER and ORR.

Inspired by the traditional electrodeposition technology, we report a fast self-etching electrodeposition method to construct copper-incorporated three-dimensional Ni-Cu coated on copper sheets as a superior bifunctional catalyst. During the electrodeposition process, the copper substrate was corroded to form ammonium copper ions by ingenious design of the concentration of electrolyte, including ammonium chloride and sodium chloride. Meanwhile, we observe that the ratio of Ni to Cu could be changed via varying the current density. The optimized hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotentials are 76 mV and 290 mV at 10 mA cm-2, respectively, which outperform the most reported bifunctional electrocatalysts until now. The calculation further demonstrates that the theoretical hydrogen desorption energy and OER overpotential of Ni-Cu are better than those of pure Ni and Cu. The prepared Ni-Cu electrocatalyst exhibits remarkable stability, especially in the HER reaction process stability test up to 50 h. The successful preparation of Ni-Cu electrocatalyst provides more possibility in the traditional electrodeposition synthesis of high performance electrocatalysts.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000663733200003		
J	Blankenship, R E								Origin and early evolution of photosynthesis.								Photosynthesis research				33				91	111						1992	1992	Photosynthesis was well-established on the earth at least 3.5 thousand million years ago, and it is widely believed that these ancient organisms had similar metabolic capabilities to modern cyanobacteria. This requires that development of two photosystems and the oxygen evolution capability occurred very early in the earth's history, and that a presumed phase of evolution involving non-oxygen evolving photosynthetic organisms took place even earlier. The evolutionary relationships of the reaction center complexes found in all the classes of currently existing organisms have been analyzed using sequence analysis and biophysical measurements. The results indicate that all reaction centers fall into two basic groups, those with pheophytin and a pair of quinones as early acceptors, and those with iron sulfur clusters as early acceptors. No simple linear branching evolutionary scheme can account for the distribution patterns of reaction centers in existing photosynthetic organisms, and lateral transfer of genetic information is considered as a likely possibility. Possible scenarios for the development of primitive reaction centers into the heterodimeric protein structures found in existing reaction centers and for the development of organisms with two linked photosystems are presented.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0166-8595			MEDLINE:11538390	11538390

Transition-metal-based electrocatalysts, which provide the possibility for the realization of low-cost, high-activity, and stable OER in alkaline solution, therefore have attracted significant research interest in recent years. A fundamental understanding of composition-structure-activity relationships for these electrocatalysts is essential to guide the design of practical electrocatalysts for industrial applications. With more advanced ex situ and in situ techniques to determine the active sites, there has been increasing evidence revealing the critical role of Fe in the high performance of Fe-containing transition metal-based electrocatalysts. Here, we present a critical review of recent progress in Fe-containing electrocatalysts for OER, highlighting the significant role of Fe in enhancing the OER activity. We outline the historical development of the Fe-containing electrocatalysts, summarize the conflicting viewpoints on catalytic active sites, and offer guidelines for more rigorous identification. The synthesis techniques and the major challenges in improving the intrinsic catalytic activity and stability are discussed. Finally, a perspective regarding emerging issues yet to be explored for developing OER electrocatalysts for practical applications are also provided.									217	10	0	0	14	0	218			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000007

Here, we report doped lanthanum nickelates (La2NiO4) with a layered perovskite structure that serve as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution in an aqueous alkaline electrolyte.

In this work, an innovative strategy based on the highly active N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) is described to one-pot synthesis of a novel precursor for bifunctional O(2-)electrocatalyst. The coordination of CO2+ with the in situ generated ligands imidazole and carbonate results in ultrafine cobalt carbonate (CoCO3)-involved cobalt-based zeolitic imidazole framework (CoCO3/Co-ZIF). Owing to the presence of ultrafine CoCO3, carbonization of CoCO3/Co-ZIF at 800 degrees C under N-2 atmosphere endows the pyrolysis product with a special skeleton of carbon nanotube (CNT)-tipped end CoOx, multivalent CoOx wrapped in graphitic carbon layers. Thus, the resulting CoOx/Co-N-C exhibits the enhanced and durable ORR/OER performance in alkaline media, due to the fast electron and mass transfers. For ORR, a large limiting current density of 4.59 mA cm(-2) can be obtained by CoOx/Co-N-C, which is comparable to that of Pt/C. For OER, it only needs an over potential of 1.65 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), merely 30 mV behind IrO2 (1.62 V). (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, nitrogen-doped carbon-coated CoFe electrocatalysts were synthesized via a three-step route comprising (1) hydrothermal reaction, (2) in-situ polymerization of dopamine and (3) carbonization. The effect of carbonized polydopamine on the overall physicochemical properties and electrochemical activity of CoFe catalysts was systematically studied. By controlling and optimizing the ratio of CoFe2O4 and dopamine contents, a transformation of the CoFe2O4 structure to CoFe alloy was observed. It was found that CoFe/NC30% (prepared with 30% dopamine) exhibits an excellent catalytic activity towards OER. A small overpotential of 340 mV was required to generate a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. More importantly, the CoFe/NC30% catalyst reflected exceptional durability for at least 24 h. This research sheds light on the development of affordable, highly efficient, and durable electrocatalysts for OER. (C) 2022 The Authors.

However, the high voltage requirement and low stability of the OER dramatically limits the total energy converting efficiency. Recently, electrocatalysts based on multi-metal oxyhydroxides have been reported as excellent substitutes for commercial noble metal catalysts due to their outstanding OER activities. However, normal synthesis routes lead to either the encapsulation of excessively active sites or aggregation during the electrolysis. To this end, we design a novel core-shell structure integrating CoMoO4 as support frameworks covered with two-dimensional gamma-FeOOH nanosheets on the surface. By involving CoMoO4, the electrochemically active surface area is significantly enhanced. Additionally, Co atoms immerge into the gamma-FeOOH nanosheet, tuning its electronic structure and providing additional active sites. More importantly, the catalysts exhibit excellent OER catalytic performance, reducing overpotentials to merely 243.1 mV a versus 10 mA cm(-2). The current strategy contributes to advancing the frontiers of new types of OER electrocatalysts by applying a proper support as a multi-functional platform.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2079-4991		WOS:000822191700001	35808051

IrO2 and RuO2, known as the state-of-the-art OER electrocatalysts, are severely limited by the high cost and low earth abundance of these noble metals. Developing noble-metal-free OER electrocatalysts with high performance has been in great demand. In this review, recent advances in the design and synthesis of noble-metal-free OER electrocatalysts including Ni, Co, Fe, Mn-based hydroxides/oxyhydroxides, oxides, chalcogenides, nitrides, phosphides, and metal-free compounds in alkaline, neutral as well as acidic electrolytes are summarized.

In this study, we report the synthesis of a series of cerium(iv) oxide and nickel diselenide nanocomposites (NiSe2/CeO2) as efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction in an alkaline medium. The ratios of the two substances were optimized to reach the highest catalytic activity. The structure and morphology of synthesized materials were investigated by XRD, FE-SEM, EDX, BET, XPS, and TEM techniques. It was observed that the nanocomposite with a 10 : 1 mass ratio of NiSe2 to CeO2 showed the best electrocatalytic performance, with a measured overpotential of 250 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 66 mV dec(-1). In addition, this nanocomposite exhibited an excellent long-term electrochemical stability for 7 h. These results are comparable to some of the best electrocatalysts known to date for electrochemical oxidation of water.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2398-4902			WOS:000652250800001

One of the main bottlenecks in this technology is the spontaneous fast backward reaction (2H(2) + O-2 -> H2O, Delta G < 0), limiting the solar energy conversion efficiency. How to suppress backward reaction is vitally important but rarely reported. Here we found that single-electron-trapped oxygen vacancy (Vo center dot) can suppress spontaneous backward reaction in pure water splitting. Taking WO3 center dot 0.33H(2)O catalyst as an example, ultrathin WO3 center dot 0.33H(2)O {100} facets with large amount of surface Vo center dot realized a continuous H-2 evolution from pure water splitting with a productivity of 9.9 mu mol/g.h without the assistance of any sacrifice agent and noble metal cocatalyst. Quantum chemical calculations revealed that the backward-reaction suppression ability of Vo center dot is attributed to the high concentration of localized electrons around Vo center dot, stimulating unidirectional simultaneous water dissociation into H and OH under light irradiation.									10	2	0	0	0	0	10			1948-7185			WOS:000471079400054	31095396

Its sluggish kinetics is tightly associated with stubborn O-O bond formation, where constructing stable superoxo/peroxo-like (O-2)(n-) species (typically e.g. NiOO*) and activating them on the catalyst surfaces have been considered as one of most efficient strategies to accelerate oxygen evolution kinetics. Herein, we have purposely designed core-shell Ni5P4@NiOOH heterostructure nanosheet arrays, which are constructed by an in-situ electrochemical self-adaptive process of the corresponding Ni5P4 precursor, and therefore demonstrate a sharp rise in activation of NiOO* on surfaces by the synergy between interface and oxygen vacancy (Vo) created during OER. By the combination studies of contrast experiments with or without interface or oxygen vacancies and theoretical calculations, we find that the interface between Ni5P4 and amorphous NiOOH ultrathin layer can promote the redistribution of electron density on the catalyst surface and optimize the Gibbs free energy of multiple adsorbed intermediates, while the numerous V-o activates NiOO* species in the Ni5P4@NiOOH catalyst. The interface-Vo synergy therefore enables an ultralow overpotential of only 273 mV@50 mA cm(-2) and a superior OER activity with up to 21- and 70-fold rise in kinetic current density under the overpotential of 270 mV over those of Ni(OH)(2)@NiOOH and NiO@NiOOH counterparts, respectively.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000707126000202

Both additives are structural isomers, and are found to be flame retardant. So TAC has a triallyl structure, and TAIC a triamine structure. Both molecules include unsaturated C-C bonds, which can be good building blocks for a protective film on cathode. Flame retardants that have double bonds are able to improve both the flame retardancy of the electrolyte and the thermal protection for the cathode. The unsaturated carbon materials form a good protective film, by which the exothermic oxygen evolution reaction at the cathode is suppressed very effectively. TAC is the better thermal protector. Addition of 3 wt.% TAC delays the exothermic reaction by 52 degrees C, i.e., from 275 to 327 degrees C. A 5 wt.% TAC solution suppresses 75.1% of exothermic energy from the oxygen evolution reaction.

However, it is still a challenge to develop efficient and stable electrocatalysts. Here, a bifunctional composite catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was constructed by using a facile insitu growth route, which combines the carbonization on exsolved alloy nanoparticles and sulfurization in one continues step. This composite catalyst contains Ruddlesden-Popper-type S-adsorbed (Nd0.6Sr0.4)(3)((Co,Fe)(0.85)Nb-0.15)(2)O-7, metal sulfides, and hollow S-doped carbon fibers. Compared to the untreated catalyst, Nd0.6Sr0.4Co0.6Fe0.3Nb0.1O3-delta, the composite catalyst leads to significantly enhanced OER and HER activities as well as excellent stability (more than 400 h without inactivation) during overall water splitting.

However, the intrinsically low electrical conductivity of MOFs hinders their commercialization for the highly efficient OER catalyst. Here, we report 2D morphological NiFe MOF electrocatalyst co-doped with metalloid and non-metal elements for the enhanced OER performances. Te metalloid incorporation on MOFs facilitates electron transfer from transition metals of MOFs to embedded metalloids, which improves OER kinetics enabling favorable adsorption of oxygen intermediate on the surface of the electrocatalyst. Incorporated halogen Cl element could effectively induce defects on MOF as leach out from the surface of electrocatalyst during OER, allowing more active sites exposed to reactants. With the synergistic effect of metalloid (Te) and halogen (Cl) doping on NiFe MOF, the Te and Cl co-doped NiFe MOF growth on Ni foam (NF) present an excellent OER property requiring low overpotential for 224 mV at 30 mA cm-2 in alkaline condition and long-term stability over 120 h.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000783193800001

However, it is challenging to experimentally obtain the energetics of oxygen redox in oxygen electrocatalysis because of the liquid reaction environment. Here we develop a kinetic model that constructs a quantitative relation between the energy profile of oxygen redox and electrochemical kinetic fingerprints. The detailed study here demonstrates that the kinetic fingerprints observed from experiments can be well described by different energetics of oxygen redox. On the basis of the model, a feasible methodology is demonstrated to derive binding energies of the oxygen intermediates from electrochemical data. The surface property of different catalysts derived from our model well rationalizes the experimental trends and predicts potential directions for catalyst design.									85	3	0	0	3	0	86			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000484828900021	31424926	
J	Heo, Yoon; Choi, Seungkyu; Bak, Jumi; Kim, Hye-Sung; Bae, Hyung Bin; Chung, Sung-Yoon								Symmetry-Broken Atom Configurations at Grain Boundaries and Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis in Perovskite Oxides								ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS				8	34					1802481	10.1002/aenm.201802481				DEC 5 2018	2018	A grain boundary forms as an internal interface when two crystalline grains with mutually different crystallographic orientations are in direct contact with each other. As a result, atomic arrangement at grain boundaries differs from that of the bulk, showing serious displacements deviating from the original symmetric positions. As these symmetry-broken configurations are difficult to achieve in the bulk crystals, grain boundaries are considered distinctive platforms that can exhibit new physical properties. By using both sintered polycrystals with various grain sizes and thin films on bicrystal substrates, it is directly verified that surface-terminating grain boundaries in LaCoO3 and LaMnO3 are exceptional in oxygen evolution electrocatalysis, showing more than an order of magnitude higher activity. A combination of atomic-scale structure observation and density functional theory calculations demonstrates that the displacement of atoms in metal-oxygen octahedra correlates with significant splitting of the degenerate transition-metal 3d orbitals, and subsequently much easier charge transfer between metals and oxygen is attained. In addition to identifying the grain boundaries as strikingly active sites, the findings suggest that symmetry breaking by atom displacements in metal-oxygen octahedra is an efficient approach to remarkably enhance the oxygen electrocatalytic efficiency in perovskite oxides.									35	3	0	0	6	0	35			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000452401000005

Here, approximate to 2-nm-thick PtIr/IrOx hybrid NWs are elaborately synthesized with equilibrated Pt/IrOx AHJs as high-efficiency bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. Mechanism studies reveal the atomically coupled Pt-IrOx dual-sites are favorable for facilitating water dissociation, alleviating the binding of H* on Pt sites and inversely regulating the *OH adsorption and oxidation on bridge Ir-Ir sites. By simply equilibrating the Pt-IrOx ratio, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be substantially accelerated. In particular, Pt-rich PtIr/IrOx-30 NWs attain 11-fold enhancements for HER compared to Pt/C in 1.0 m KOH, while IrOx-rich PtIr/IrOx-50 NWs express about five times mass activity referring to Ir/C for OER. Remarkably, the ratio-optimized PtIr/IrOx NWs electrode couple achieves a durably continuous H-2 production under a substantially low cell voltage.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000782348000001	35419953

Therefore, it is crucial to find earth-abundant, low-cost and efficient bifunctional catalysts for such process. In this paper, we report one-step electroreductive deposition of Fe-Co composite films on carbon fiber papers (CFPs) in a solution containing Fe(III) and Co(II) ions without and with N-2 bubbling, and the prepared composite films show highly efficient electrocatalytic performances and good durabilities for both OER and HER in 1.0 M KOH. To reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the overpotentials are only 283 mV for OER and -163 mV for HER with small Tafel slopes of 34 and 51 mV dec(-1), respectively. Moreover, the Fe-Co composite films can be used as bifunctional catalysts for water splitting with the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.68 V, which is comparable with most of the Ni-based films reported. This proves that the Ni-free derivatives of 3d transition metals can also show high catalytic performance.									49	6	0	0	1	0	52			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000405202800067

On cycling the electrode in between the potential range of-1.0 to +0.65 V, two oxidation and two reduction transformations were observed. The origins of the transformations were found out. Most of the transformation peak potentials were found to be different than that of Pd and Ni electrodes. The generation of (PdNi)(III) species over the electrode surface identified to be the crucial for the oxygen evolution and continuous cycling up to 100 min succeeded to obtain its saturated layer. Tafel plots for both the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) showed two regions. The kinetic parameters for the HER and OER, i.e., exchange current density at zero overpotential (i(o)) and slope (b) values for both the low and high overpotential (eta) regions were found out. For the HER, the is and b values are found to be 6.17 x 10(-2) and 4.36 mA/cm(2) and 137.0 and 343.9 mV/dec, respectively. For the OER, the values are 2.83 x 10(-3) and 2.35 mA/cm(2) and 72.8 and 215.1 mV/dec, respectively. On comparing these kinetic values with that available for Pd, Ni and Pd-50 at% Ni, it is realized that the investigated Pd-80 at% Ni electrode showed better electrolysis efficiencies than that of its component materials and Pd-50 at% Ni electrode.

Highly efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are very important for various energy storage and conversion systems such as water splitting devices and metal-air batteries. This study prepared a NiMo4@C3N4 catalyst for OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by simple methods. The catalyst exhibited an excellent OER activity based on the response at a suitable temperature. To drive a current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2) for OER and HER, the overpotentials required for NiMo4@C3N4-800 (prepared at 800 degrees C) were 259 and 118 mV, respectively. A two-electrode system using NiMo4@C3N4-800 needed a very low cell potential of 1.572 V to reach a current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2). In addition, this catalyst showed excellent durability after long-term tests. It was seen to have good catalytic activity and broad application prospects.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-025X	2095-0268		WOS:000831237300001

Here, a bimetallic NiFe selenide catalyst synthesized by facile selenization of NiFe Prussian blue analogue (PBA) metal-organic framework (MOF) nanoparticle precursors is reported for efficient OER in alkaline solutions. Through two-step electrodeposition and post-thermal pyrolytic selenization, mixed NiFe selenide supported by carbon fiber paper (NiFe-Se/CFP) can be facilely prepared. A low overpotential of 281 mV is required by the NiFe-Se/CFP electrode to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2); additionally, an accelerated electron-transfer kinetics is obtained with a Tafel slope of 40.93 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH solution. The electrocatalytic current density shows negligible loss during 20 h continuous electrolysis, suggesting good stability during long-term alkaline OER. Using the MOF precursor and establishing an in situ phase transformation endow mixed NiFe selenide with highly active surface catalytic sites and high electrical conductivity for efficient water oxidation.									48	2	0	0	1	0	47			2168-0485			WOS:000618670600007

Inspired by the natural porosity and directional micro-channels of wood, a universal strategy that N-doped carbon nanotube encapsulated active nanoparticles rooted into carbonized wood framework is proposed. The as-prepared catalysts show ultrahigh activity and robust stability. Representatively, the FeNi-P encapsulated in N-doped carbon nanotubes grown on the carbonized wood frameworks (denoted as FeNi-P@NCNT/CW) exhibit an outstanding OER activity with an overpotential of 180 mV to reach 50 mA cm(-2). As comparison, such catalysts integrated in nickel foam and carbon paper require higher overpotentials with 251 and 249 mV, respectively. Furthermore, a steady OER overpotential is maintained even tested for more than 200 h (4.2 % decay). The referred construction will open a new road to adopting renewable resources for preparing efficient electrocatalysts and other electrochemical energy-conversion devices.									27	2	0	0	2	0	29			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000566454400009

NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) intercalated with different dicarboxylate anions were tested among which suberate anion intercalated NiFe LDH was found to be a great OER catalyst which outperformed RuO2, especially when the current density was larger than 2 mA cm(-2). The suberate anion intercalated NiFe LDH needed an overpotential of 387 mV to reach 1 mA cm(-2) which is one of the lowest among all reported non-noble-metal OER catalysts on fluorine-doped tin oxide electrode and an overpotential of 420 mV to achieve 2 mA cm(-2) which is much lower than that of RuO2. Moreover, this material showed great stability for at least 24 h. All the NiFe LDHs intercalated with dicarboxylate anions showed good OER performance, which could be attributed to the "structural instability" induced "in-situ anion exchange" process during OER.									25	0	0	0	1	0	25			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000510526000055

Herein, we report the synthesis of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanorods using a hydrothermal method. The transformation of bulk g-C3N4 (denoted as g-B-CN) to g-C3N4 1D nanorods (denoted as g-CN) endowed the material with abundant active sites, increased electrochemical active surface area, and enhanced charge transfer. g-CN exhibited high activity and durability in catalyzing the OER. The optimized g-CN achieved a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 316 mV vs. RHE in 1 M KOH, with a Tafel slope of 125 mV dec(-1). The high catalytic performance of g-CN is mainly attributed to the abundantly exposed unique active sites originatingfrom the 1D morphology and the presence of an oxidized pyridinic nitrogen; elucidating the important role of elaborate morphology tailoring and co-doping of heteroatoms in catalyzing the OER.									14	1	0	0	1	0	15			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000477935900014

These energy devices demand potential bifunctional electrocatalysts for proficient functions. Therefore, identifying an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst working in the acidic environment seems promising to realize the practicability. In this line, the carbon-supported Ir95-xPd5Ptx (x= 30, 45, and 65) trimetallic nanoparticles were prepared by both in situ and ex situ methods and studied their oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). The structural and morphological features of Ir95-xPd5Ptx/C (x=30, 45, and 65) nanoparticles were studied using XRD and TEM analysis. The percentage of Ir95-xPd5Ptx nanoparticles in the carbon support was revealed by thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) and elemental mapping analysis. Among the prepared compositions, the Ir50Pd5Pt45/C composite synthesized by the in situ method delivers a high limiting current density of 5.151 mA/cm(2), half-wave potential of 0.931 V vs. RHE, and a Tafel slope of 121 mV/dec for ORR. Similarly, it performed well in oxygen evolution by providing a low overpotential of 380 mV vs. RHE at 10 mA/cm(2) with a Tafel slope of 127 mV/dec. Thus, the in situ synthesized Ir50Pd5Pt45/C can be used as the potential bifunctional electrocatalyst in an acidic environment.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000761269400001

It is necessary to activate the inert oxidation layer on the surface of metallic compounds for highly efficient OER catalysts. Taking cobalt sulfide as an example, we designed a facile strategy to introduce oxygen vacancy (Vo) in the inert oxidation layer CoOx coating on metallic Co9S8 by in-situ derived Zn doped Co9S8. First-principles calculation and experimental analysis verify that introduced Vo leads to lesser electron filling of the anti-bonding states by tailoring the positions of d-band center, which can facilitate the fast kinetics of OER. Meanwhile, internal metallic Zn-Co9S8 can accelerate the electron transfer process. Benefiting from the advantages of geometric construction and electronic regulation, fabricated Zn doped CoOx/Co9S8 nanotube arrays exhibit remarkable electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential of similar to 256 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), Tafel slope drops as low as similar to 44 mV dec(-1), accompanied by good long term stability toward OER conditions. The present work provides valuable insights into the design of other catalysts for OER and beyond.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000711921400008

The Cr2O3 shell was homogeneously coated on the surface of CdS/Pt core, forming coaxial heterostructure. This one-dimensional core/shell heterostructural assembly facilitates the high efficient photogenerated charge separation and transfer from CdS to Cr2O3 under visible light illumination, which suppressed the photocorrosion of CdS. Moreover, with the help of artificial blood component perfluorodecalin (PFDL), the nascent formed oxygen was removed from the reaction mixture, which further inhibited the oxygen induced photocorrosion, finally the catalyst exhibited 126.6 mu mol.g(catalyst)(-1) H-2 formation in 2 h without sacrifice reagent addition under visible light irradiation. No significant decay of activity was observed in 8 h. The present results showed core-shell heterostructural CdS@Cr2O3 could be one of candidates for photo catalytic water splitting catalysts and oxygen capture reagent PFDL could be used for removing nascent oxygen to inhibit the H-2-O-2 recombination reverse reaction and enhance hydrogen evolution activity.									36	4	0	0	3	0	38			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000414109700060

Herein, the activation and reaction of molecular oxygen during CO oxidation at platinum-ceria interfaces has been in situ explored using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) via a borrowing strategy, and different active oxygen species and their evolution during CO oxidation at platinum- ceria interfaces have been directly observed. In situ Raman spectroscopic evidence with isotopic exchange experiments demonstrate that oxygen is efficiently dissociated to chemisorbed O on Pt and lattice Ce-O species simultaneously at interfacial Ce3+ defect sites under CO oxidation, leading to a much higher activity at platinum-ceria interfaces compared to that at Pt alone. Further in situ time-resolved SERS studies and density functional theory simulations reveal a more efficient molecular pathway through the reaction between adsorbed CO and chemisorbed Pt-O species transferred from the interfaces. This work deepens the fundamental understandings on oxygen activation and CO oxidation at metal-oxide interfaces and offers a sensitive technique for the in situ characterization of oxygen species under working conditions.									16	1	0	0	1	0	15			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000703999100018	34541841

Water electrolysis is a promising technique used for clean hydrogen generation. Usually, the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) and urea-oxidation reaction (UOR) processes play a vital role in hydrogen production and pollution control. Herein, we report the fabrication of a three-dimensional (3D) crystalline/amorphous heterostructure NiTe/Ni-S electrocatalyst grown on nickel-foam (NF) via facile two steps (i.e., hydrothermal and electrodeposition) strategy. The synthesized NiTe/Ni-S catalyst exhibits an excellent performance toward the OER with a small overpotential of 216 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) current density in 1.0 M KOH. Further, it only requires a small voltage of 1.315 V (vs. the reversible-hydrogen-electrode (RHE)) to drive 10 mA cm(-2) current density for UOR in 1 M KOH with 0.33 M urea, and reveals excellent long-term catalytic stability. Moreover, the overall water splitting experiments were conducted in 1 M KOH electrolyte with the NiTe/Ni-S catalyst as an anode and Pt/C as a cathode. It is obvious that only 1.500 and 1.527 V is required to achieve a current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) and 20 mA cm(-2), respectively. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, rhizobia-like Ni nano-clusters encapsulated with a carbon network are anchored on porous TiN nanowire arrays prepared on carbon cloth (CC) to form a high-performance electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water splitting. The Ni nano-clusters with a small size and strong interaction with the TiN substrate provide active sites galore to facilitate OER. Furthermore, the skeleton made of porous TiN nanowires on CC provides high electrical conductivity to accelerate charge transport as well as a rough surface to accommodate the Ni nano-clusters. The interaction between the metallic Ni nano-clusters and TiN substrate are demonstrated to promote the activity in OER based on theoretical calculation. This novel electrocatalyst which exhibits superior OER activity and stability in an alkaline electrolyte has large potential in energy conversion and related applications.									8	2	0	0	0	0	9			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000691184400008

In this work, Cu doped Ni3S2 nanosheet arrays grown on Ni foam have been synthesized using a two-step hydrothermal method. Doping Cu ion can effectively enhance the conductivity, accelerate charge transfer process and provide more catalytic active sites, thereby improving the OER performance of Ni3S2. In a series of Cu-doped Ni3S2 samples, Ni1.9Cu0.1-S (the chemical composition is Ni2.85Cu0.15S2) displays a small overpotential of 259 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 54.9 mV dec(-1), better than that of undoped Ni3S2 (with a overpotential of 274 mV). Also, the catalyst possesses pretty OER stability with the overpotential only rising by 1.9% after 12 h, which indicate the Ni1.9Cu0.1-S nanosheet arrays on Ni foam should be an effective OER catalyst in alkaline medium.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000596313400029

But the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) still hampersthe hydrogen production by water electrolysis. So, to design and synthesize an efficient OER catalyst for electrochemical conversion technologiesstill keeps challenge. Herein, an ideal precursor of bimetallic porphyrinicMOF (Co-CuTCPP)/reduced graphene oxide (Co-CuTCPP/rGO) composite has been fabricated by an ultrathin porphyrinic MOF (Co-CuTCPP) nanosheet loaded onto graphene oxide (GO)via hydrothermal process. Owing to synergetic effect of the rGOand bimetallic porphyrin MOF scaly structure, the optimized Co-CuTCPP/rGO-10 catalyst exhibited high electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential of 396 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 58 mV dec(-1), and had good stabilityin alkaline conditions. So, the lowcost, stable, and heterogeneous electrocatalyst might be a promising candidate for the OER devices in alkaline conditions without requirement of pyrolysis process.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			2365-6549			WOS:000479139200045

Here, we report inverse spinel Co[Co,Fe]O-4/nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) composite used as a promising catalyst for rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries. The cells with Co[Co,Fe]O-4/NG catalyst exhibit high initial capacity, remarkable cyclability, and good rate capability. Moreover, the overpotential of the Li-O-2 batteries is reduced significantly. The improved ORR/OER performances are attributed to the good property of Co[Co,Fe]O-4 with an inverse spinel structure toward ORR and the improved electronic conductivity of N-doped graphene. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows the rate limitation step for ORR on the inverse spinel surface is the growth of the Li2O2 cluster while the rate limitation step for the OER pathway is the oxidation of Li2O2. The inverse spinel surface in Co[Co,Fe]O-4/NG is more active than that of the normal spinel phases for the Li-O-2 battery reactions. This work not only provides a promising bifunctional catalyst for practical metal air batteries but also offers a general strategy to rationally design catalysts for various applications.									65	7	0	0	1	0	67			2155-5435			WOS:000431727300041

The development of new effective catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction can significantly improve the performance of fuel cells as well as electrocatalytic hydrogen production. This study presents the scalable synthesis of nitrogen-doped graphene oxide for the oxygen reduction reaction. The combination of an ab initio theoretical investigation of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) mechanism and detailed electrochemical characterization allowed the identification of electrocatalytically active nitrogen functionalities. The dominant effect on electrocatalytic activity is the presence of graphitic and pyridinic nitrogen and also N-oxide functionalities.

Herein, porous carbon materials doped with Co, nitrogen, and sulfur were synthesized through the carbonization of a mixture containing [1-vinylimidazolium] [HSO4] ionic liquid (IL) and CoCl2 under an inert atmosphere. The structural diversity of ionic liquids offered control over the structure and properties of the carbon materials at the molecular level. The protic ionic liquid used acted as a soft template and a source of heteroatoms. A change in the mass ratio of cobalt chloride to ionic liquids resulted in materials with three different morphologies with/without S and N. The resulting Co-10-NS-C material exhibited considerably enhanced catalytic performance toward the OER, which compared favorably to that of state-of-the-art Ru-based catalysts. Moreover, the Co-10-NS-C catalyst demonstrated excellent stability up to 8 h without any decay in catalytic current.									12	1	0	0	1	0	12			2168-0485			WOS:000484071600063

Atomic dispersion of Fe-Co species represents a new type of potential materials for OER. However, it is still highly challenging to exploit facile and efficient methods for such synthesis. Herein, we have developed a rapid mechanical ball milling approach to synthesize highly-dispersed Fe/Co/N on graphene as OER electrocatalyst, which displays high OER performance with over potential of 288 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and no obvious decay after 9 h of continuous operation at 10 mA cm(-2). This excellent electrocatalytic performance originates from atomic-scale accessible iron, cobalt and nitrogen electrocatalytic sites and highly conductive graphene. These results suggest feasibility of this facile and efficient ball milling method in synthesis of other electrocatalysts for various applications. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

However, the sluggish kinetics of the ORR and OER reduce the efficiency. To address these issues, the development of efficient and robust electrode catalysts is required desperately. Herein, a new Co9S8 nanocrystal hybrid anchored on a N- and S-dual-doped graphene (Co9S8/N, S-G) was prepared by a two-step method, namely, a p-p assembly process of p-phenyl-bis(3,4-dicyanophenyl) thioether cobalt polyphthalocyanine (PTCoPPc) and graphene oxide and a pyrolysis procedure. Electrochemical studies demonstrated that Co9S8(800)/N,S-G exhibited a comparable ORR performance with 20 wt% Pt/C, such as an onset potential and a half-wave potential of 0.931 and 0.811 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode, respectively, a limiting current density of 5.207 mAcm(-2), and a good long-term stability with a current retention of 92.6% after 10 000 s continuous measurements. Co9S8(900)/N, S-G displayed an excellent OER activity, which was ascribed to the presence of pyridinic N, graphitic N, and the occupation of Co-N to catalyze the ORR; and the oxygen adsorption on the surface of Co9S8(900)/N, S-G contributed significantly to the OER activity. The approach developed here offered a new strategy to construct efficient oxygen electrode catalysts.									17	2	0	0	0	0	19			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000395798300013

The resulting catalyst shows much enhanced OER performance under alkaline condition, requiring as low as 279 mV of overpotential to reach 10 mA cm(-2) current density.

Herein, a facile and universal strategy is reported to fabricate defect-abundant atomic-layered materials with unique electronic structures by mechanical shear-assisted exfoliation. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, atomic-layered defect-rich LiCoO2 nanosheets (AD-LCO) are successfully synthesized, which enable accelerated oxygen evolution kinetics with a substantially decreased oxygen evolution reaction overpotential by 184 and 216 mV at 10 and 50 mA cm(-2), respectively. X-ray absorption spectroscopy suggests that AD-LCO possesses more d-band holes and enhanced Co-O covalency. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the presence of Co lattice vacancies can optimize the adsorption kinetics of intermediates, consequently lowering the energy barrier of the rate-determining step. Importantly, this method has universal applicability to the fabrication of other ultrathin defect-rich 2D materials such as BN, WS2, and MoS2.

Herein, a narrow bandgap of Ca-doped BiFeO3 (BCFO) is synthesized by a simple auto combustion method. To create oxygen vacancies by doping Ca2+ the place of Bi3+, the amount of Fe3+ valence state is changed as well. 0.15% of Ca doped BiFeO3 (BCFO-15) indicate a high content of Fe4+ state with a conduction band and valence band located at 0.615 V and 2.46 V vs. NHE, respectively. The electrochemical OER of BCFO-15 observed a lower onset potential of 2.13 V vs. RHE, in acidic with a current density of 25.64 mA cm(-2). In alkaline electrolyte, onset potential was observed at 2.10 V vs. RHE, with a current density of 65.87 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the photocatalytic performance of the perovskites in aqueous solution was demonstrated through photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) as a model pollutant, resulting in an 89.92% reduction of 50 ppm of Cr(VI) in 210 min under the irradiation of a 35 W Xe arc lamp. These findings suggest that simple divalent doping of Ca into pure BiFeO3 results in excellent photocatalytic and electrocatalytic perovskites.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000599886500001

The active sites originated from the limited edge of crystalline molybdenum disulfide is the key to restrict its HER performance. To increase the active sites of molybdenum disulfide through the heteroatom doping with effective synthetic strategy has become the focus of activity improvement. Herein, a facile and efficient strategy was adopted to synthesize oxygen-doped molybdenum sulfide catalyst by utilizing thiourea and sodium molybdate as precursors. It was found that the number of active sites could be regulated by controlling the dosage ratio of thiourea to sodium molybdate. The doped oxygen and abundant S endows molybdenum sulfide a great deal of lattice disorder or defects, thus providing adequate active sites. When the optimized ratio of thiourea to sodium molybdate (40:1), the double layer value of oxygen-doped molybdenum sulfide reached 34.14 mF/cm(2) (mass loading on glassy carbon electrode was 0.142 mg/cm(2)) which is considered to be proportional to the electrochemical active area. Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the presence of Mo-O bond and bridging S-2(2-) bonds which endows molybdenum sulfide with a great deal of lattice disorder or defects, thus providing plentiful active sites.

In particular, renewable energy sources integrated water electrolysis system has emerged due to its eco-friendly and highly energy efficient process. However, inherent limitations of renewable energy sources including intermittent and unpredictable energy production restrict stable water electrolysis cell operating. Therefore, investigation on cell performance depending on various operation conditions is absolutely required. Here, we synthesized Ni-Fe layered double hydroxide (Ni-Fe LDH) electrodes and studied their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities under various operational conditions matching actual environmental conditions when utilizing renewable energy sources. Changes in morphology and electrocatalytic performance were systematically studied by using XRD, FE-SEM, and EIS measurement. Our results showed that operation of water electrolysis cell in an accelerated stress condition could result in changes in morphology of crystal structure of LDH, thus restricting ions to be fully utilized at active site for OER.

Herein, we report the facile development of a Ni3S2-CeO2 hybrid nanostructure via an electrodeposition method. Benefiting from the strong interfacial interaction between Ni3S2 and CeO2, the electron transfer is notably improved and the water oxidation activity of Ni3S2 nanosheets is significantly enhanced. In 1.0 M KOH, the Ni3S2-CeO2 electrocatalyst achieves a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 264 mV, which is 92 mV lower than that of Ni3S2. Moreover, Ni3S2-CeO2 exhibits superior electrochemical stability. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the enhanced OER electrocatalytic performance of Ni3S2-CeO2 can be ascribed to an increase in the binding strength of the reaction intermediates at the Ni3S2-CeO2 interface.

However, current achievements still suffer from poor cycle life, low practical energy density, low round-trip efficiency, and high manufacturing costs. One of the key challenges is the sluggish kinetics of oxygen electrochemistry during discharge and charge cycles. Thus, significant breakthroughs in design and synthesis of efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen redox reaction are highly demanded. Nanocarbons, especially heteroatoms doped nanocarbons, are potential oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts due to the reasonable balance between catalytic activity, durability, and cost. Importantly, by introduction of transition metal nanoparticles, spinel oxides, layered-double hydroxides, perovskite oxides, and other metal oxides, the constructed nanocarbon-based materials could deliver promising bifunctional ORR and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic properties, which could be employed as air-cathode materials to improve energy storage performances, even to get commercialized. Here, an overview of the recent progress of nanocarbon-based electrocatalysts as air-cathode materials for rechargeable aqueous Li/Zn-air batteries is provided, aiming to highlight the benefits and issues of nanocarbon-based electrocatalysts as well as to outline the most promising results and applications so far.									26	2	0	0	0	0	26			2196-0216			WOS:000438339200002

ACS applied materials & interfaces				14	42			47560	47567		10.1021/acsami.2c11418				2022-Oct-26	2022	One of the major challenges that hinder the practical application of water electrolysis lies in the design of advanced electrocatalysts toward the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, a pure Co-based precatalyst of CoOOH/brownmillerite derived from the surface activation of brownmillerite by a surface acid etching method exhibits high activity and stable electrical properties toward the OER. Different from oxyhydroxide derived from in situ surface reconstruction during the electrochemical process, the growth of highly crystalline CoOOH from the brownmillerite surface enables rational control over the surface/bulk structure as well as the concentration of active sites, and this structure can be well maintained and serve as highly active sites. The catalyst shows a low overpotential of 320 mV to obtain 10 mA cm-2 and high stability in an alkaline electrolyte for the OER, which is comparable to the majority of Co-based electrocatalysts. Moreover, the appropriate interfacial interaction of the composite catalysts greatly contributes to the hydroxide insertion to improve water oxidation ability. This work proposes an effective strategy to develop high-performance metal oxide-based materials for the OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1944-8252		MEDLINE:36240505	36240505

Herein, an ultrafine Co-Fe material highly dispersed on nitrogen carbide matrix is fabricated by coordination polymer and self-templating method to scrutinize the impact of spin state of Co on OER through Fe doping. The optimized catalyst shows boosted OER performance, which only requires overpotential of 333 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), outperforming other control samples and commercial RuO2. The elevated local spin states of Co by Fe doping lead to charge transfer acceleration and fast generation of oxygenated intermediates, which is proved to account for the OER elevation. In addition, the long-term stability of Co-Fe material is guaranteed by the strong coordination of Co/Fe to the melamine-formaldehyde resin, which is used to adsorb metal ions, contributing to the high dispersion of active sites during the OER process.

However, the rational design of NiFe-based electrocatalysts remains a great challenge to address the sluggish reaction kinetics and severe deactivation problems for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, the authors report a facile approach to fabricate an amorphous Ce-doped NiFe hydroxide catalyst, which enables high activity and outstanding stability toward OER in alkaline media. The overpotential of electrodeposited amorphous Ce-doped NiFe is only 195 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile, the durability of the amorphous Ce-doped NiFe is maintained for 300 h at 100 mA cm(-2). The comprehensive characterization results reveal that the improved electrochemical performance of the amorphous Ce-doped NiFe catalyst is originated from the favorable oxidation transition of active sites enabled by Ce-doping. It is a very good strategy to introduce highly oxidized state ions to regulate the NiFe-based catalyst to improve the catalytic activity and stability.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000814183700001

Developing noble-metal-free oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts with high activity and long durability thus becomes immensely vital yet challenging. In this work, core-branch Co3O4@CoNi-layered double hydroxide nanoarrays are developed on nickel foam with the assistance of metal-organic-frameworks template and atomic layer deposition technology, acting as active and durable electrocatalysts for OER. The introduction of CoNi-LDH significantly regulates the morphological and electronic structure of Co3O4, giving rise to high surface-active sites exposure, accelerated electron transfer, and optimal interaction with intermediate products. Together with the 3D self-supported and binder-free structure, the optimized Co3O4@CoNi-LDH/NF exhibits remarkable OER performances in terms of low overpotential, high OER current density, and low Tafel slope, which are even better than the benchmark IrO2 electrocatalyst. This study provides a new horizon for exploring biphasic core-branch materials for electrocatalysis and other energy-related applications. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

However, their commercial applications are still restricted by sluggish kinetics and limited stability. Herein, we highlight a facile anion engineering strategy in monoclinic SrIrO3 (M-SrIrO3) perovskite nanosheets for boosting acidic OER performance. The resultant novel S-doped M-SrIrO3 electrocatalyst delivers a low overpotential of 228 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for 20 h to drive OER in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte, which is superior to the benchmark IrO2 and favorably rivals most the state-of-the-art Ir-based perovskite electrocatalysts. Notably, the surface Sr leaching is confirmed during OER process, resulting in surface reconstruction of Ir(O, S)(x) amorphous layer. Theoretical calculations reveal that the S incorporation mitigates the strong binding of reaction intermediates, thus ultimately lowering the activation energy of OER kinetics. This protocol might offer an efficient approach of anion engineering in perovskites for various electmcatalysis.									17	0	0	0	1	0	16			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000701827100007

Their activities are strongly shell thickness dependent. Specifically, nanocrystals with approximate to 2 monolayers of CoO can exhibit a potential difference of 0.794 V at OER and ORR current densities of 10 and -3 mA cm(-2), respectively. This value is competitive to those of most active bifunctional catalysts reported.

Herein, we report a CoO/MoOx crystalline/amorphous structure as an effective bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting. Converted from CoMoO4 by hydrogenation, the CoO/MoOx, featured with crystalline CoO in amorphous MoOx matrix, displays superior catalytic activities toward both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It shows small onset overpotentials of 40 and 230 mV for the HER and OER in 1.0 M KOH, respectively, and overall water splitting starting at 1.53 V with a robust stability. The high catalytic activity of the CoO/MoOx is benefited from the large defect-rich interface between CoO and MoOx, along with the amorphous nature of MoOx. Thus, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of structural manipulation in developing highly active electrocatalysts for overall electrochemical water splitting.									102	3	0	0	3	0	102			2168-0485			WOS:000380291200019

In most reports, an MOF is used as a sacrificial template to prepare a highly efficient electrocatalyst by calcination. Here, a series of FeNi bimetallic MIL-101 materials has been synthesized by a solvothermal method and directly applied for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). These MOFs contain a large number of catalytically active MO6 octahedra and exposed hydrophilic carboxyl groups, which are believed to enhance OER activity. In addition, after the introduction of Ni, the catalytic activity is significantly improved by synergy between the metals. Among the studied compositions, Fe2Ni-MIL-101 showed the best OER performance, requiring a low over potential of just 237 mV to drive a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution, corresponding to a low Tafel slope of 44.2 mV dec(-1). Moreover, the electrochemical properties remained virtually unchanged during a 40-h long-term stability test.

Herein, we applied a simple one-step electrodeposition method to prepare NiFe-based selenides on nickel foam and evaluated the influence of MoO42- doping on the OER electrocatalytic activity. The optimized NiFeMoSe/NF nanospheres electrode exhibits an excellent OER activity with a low overpotential of 253 mV at the current density of 50 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 35.98 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH, which is lower than those of NiFeSe/NF without MoO42- doping (300 mV, 80 0.4 mV dec(-1)). Moreover, the long-term catalytic performance was continuously measured at 50 mA cm(-2) for 20 h, the required potential remained almost unchanged, indicative of the outstanding durability and stability of the NiFeMoSe/NF electrode in alkaline medium. The enhanced electrocatalytic performance was ascribed to more catalytically active sites and faster charge transfer because of the electronic interaction of MoO42- with NiFeSe.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000682409800007

Herein, an innovative electrode design with an ultra-low Ir loading is proposed to achieve high catalytic OER performance, catalyst utilization, conductivity, and mass transfer. The microgram-scale loading of Ir on a highly roughened dendritic Au support is controlled by the number of Ir deposition pulses and, together with Ir coverage, which significantly affect the Ir electronic structure and intrinsic OER activity. Further control of the Ir electronic structure is achieved by forming Ir oxides via electrochemical and thermal oxidation to adjust the activity-stability balance. A PEMWE employing the fabricated electrode demonstrates substantially low ohmic and mass-transfer losses, especially in the higher-current-density region. As a result, superior cell performance with extremely high mass activity is achieved, significantly exceeding the mass activities of state-of-the-art Ir-based anodes.									17	1	0	0	1	0	18			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000600016300005

However, the dispersion and intrinsic activity of active sites for OER still need improvements. In our work, a facile two-step electrodeposition has been used to help the better dispersion of Ni sties and realize the Mo doping for enhanced intrinsic activity of Ni3S2 supported on nickel foam (Mo-Ni3S2/NF). Firstly, Mo/Ni/NF as precursor has been obtained by through the two-step electrodeposition of Ni and Mo, respectively. Secondly, the hydrothermal sulfurization of the precursor provides the homogeneous dispersion of MoNi3S2 nanoparticles on NF. The prepared Mo-Ni3S2/NF for OER only needs a low overpotential of 179 mV to reach the current density of 50 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solution. The excellent stability has also been kept for more than 10 h. This result suggest that the method of electrodeposition can be a promising way for constructing transition metal-based sulfides electrocatalysts for OER.									0	1	0	0	0	0	1			1452-3981			WOS:000551697600060

After optimization of bath concentration, immersion times, and number of SILAR cycles, very conformal and active NiFeOx films with controlled Fe/Ni content ratios were obtained. Upon the incorporation of Fe2+ species in the NiCl2 solution bath, a cathodic shift in the overpotential required for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by more than 200 mV with no decrease in current density was observed after 40 SILAR cycles. We demonstrate that by fine-tuning the film composition and thickness, NiFeOx can be employed as an efficient OER catalyst with very low absorbance in the visible spectrum. By doing so, we demonstrate that this material has great potential for incorporation in semiconductor photoelectrodes for direct solar-driven water electrolysis.

This was achieved by using a suitable organometallic complex in a single step synthetic route without using any solvent or catalyst. The advantage of using such precursor was to offer a source for metal, phosphorus and carbon without using any additional sources. The morphology of products was characterized by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and nature of carbon was analyzed using the Raman microscope and X-ray diffraction. The electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and stability of the metal phosphide nanostructure was evaluated using the rotating disk electrode technique. The CoP, NiP and FeP exhibit the OER overpotential of 370, 380 and 550 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. Among prepared phosphide catalysts, cobalt phosphide shows a lowest Tafel slope indicate favorable kinetics for the OER activity than nickel and iron phosphide catalysts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

By using metal-organic framework (MOF) nanosheets hydrothermally grown on pre-oxidized nickel foam (denoted by Co-2(OH)(2)(BDC)/NiO/NF) as a precursor, two novel heterogeneous nanosheet arrays including a cobalt phosphide nanoparticle embedded carbon nanotube nanosheet array supported by phosphorized nickel foam (denoted by CoP-CNT/Ni2P/NF) and a cobalt phosphide nanorod decorated carbon nanosheet array supported by oxidized nickel foam (denoted by CoP-C/NiO/NF) are prepared. Both were confirmed to be highly efficient for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. In particular, CoP-C/NiO/NF exhibits higher catalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (eta(100) = -131 mV), promoted by the synergy of oxidized nickel foam. CoP-CNT/Ni2P/NF performs better in the oxygen evolution reaction (eta(50) = 301 mV), benefiting mainly from its improved electrochemically active surface area. The two catalysts match well in overall water splitting with satisfactory activity (eta(10) = 1.57 V) and stability when directly applied in a two-electrode cell. This method will bring new inspiration to maximize the electrocatalytic efficiency of MOF-derived catalysts for energy conversion applications in the future.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000721877000001	34812811

However, further enhancement of the photocatalytic activity in this material could be envisaged through the effective control of oxygen vacancy states. This could substantially tune the photoexcited charge carrier trapping under the influence of elemental functionalization in SrTiO3, corresponding to the defect formation energy. The charge trapping states in SrTiO3 decrease through the substitutional doping in Ti sites with p-block elements like Aluminum (Al) with respect to the relative oxygen vacancies. With the help of electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) formalism, we have explored the synergistic effect of doping with both Al and Iridium (Ir) in SrTiO3 from the perspective of defect formation energy, band edge alignment, and the corresponding charge carrier recombination probability to probe the photoexcited charge carrier trapping that primarily governs the photocatalytic water splitting process. We have also systematically investigated the ratio-effect of Ir:Al functionalization on the position of acceptor levels lying between Fermi and conduction band in oxygen deficient SrTiO3, which governs the charge carrier recombination and therefore the corresponding photocatalytic efficiency.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2574-0962			WOS:000739361600001

However, carbon-based SACs are primarily bonded with carbons, resulting in an inferior performance in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we develop a novel coordination adsorption strategy for the synthesis of a monodispersed Fe(NO)(2) moiety anchored on the nitrogen sites of the nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs) to form a Fe(NO)(2)-N-GQDs complex as an efficient OER catalyst. The resultant Fe(NO)(2)-N-GQDs complex exhibits a highly stable overpotential of 270 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 48 mV dec(-1) together with long-term durability, which greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art RuO2. Our finding emphasizes the role of electron-transfer resistance changes during a simple synthesis method to enhance electrocatalytic efficiency. Therefore, this work will envision numerous opportunities for creating novel-type carbon-based SACs via nitrogen-metal coordination as highly robust OER catalysts. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we report the outstanding OER performance of an iron doped nickel layered silicate (Ni1-xFex)3Si2O5(OH)4 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4), which was synthesized via a combined coprecipitation and hydrothermal method. The doping Fe ions are found to have a stronger adsorption effect on the *O intermediate, thereby reducing the energy barrier for the potential determining step *OH -> *O, and as a result greatly enhance the OER activity of nickel layered silicate. At Fe doping concentration of 30 mol%, a minimum OER overpotential of 286 mV is achieved at the current density of 10 mA cm-2 without IR correction, 86 mV lower than that of undoped catalyst. Moreover, the catalyst maintains favorable OER stability over a 24hour chronopotentiometry test in 1 M KOH.

The development of efficient and robust non precious OER electrocatalysts remains a critical challenge for the production, storage and conversion of renewable energy. Herein, vertically NiCo2O4 nanosheets are grown on Ti mesh via a facile solvothermal method which is followed by low-temperature calcination. The NiCo2O4/Ti catalyst exhibits outstanding OER performance with a low overpotential of 353 mV to drive the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 61 mV dec(-1) in alkaline solution. Moreover, the stable electrocatalyst undergoes negligible degradation in alkaline media at least 20 h. The acceleration of the electrochemical OER likely stems from the facile electron transfer promoted by the NiCo2O4/Ti interface as revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

In this study, we describe the development of a simple in situ growth method to prepare a binder free IrOx-Ti anode with a very low IrOx loading amount (< 0.25 mg cm(-2)), and the obtained catalyst shows a high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and durability in acidic media. The performance of a polymer electrolyte alcohol electrosynthesis cell (PEAEC) using this anode catalyst shows a better performance than that of PEAEC using a typical commercial IrO2-Ti paper anode with the loading of IrO2 = 3 mg cm(-2). Furthermore, the key factors that affect the performance of the PEAEC are determined by comparing the performances of the PEAEC with different anode catalysts. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Research into OER catalysts using earth abundant elements is required to achieve desirable catalytic efficiency. Herein, a selection of misfit-layered calcium cobaltite and transition metal (Mn, Fe, and Cu)-doped compounds are synthesized and investigated in order to evaluate their potential as OER catalysts in an alkaline environment. It is discovered that Ca3Co4O9 OER activity may be substantially improved through incorporation of Fe, exhibiting low overpotential (331 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2) current density, small Tafel slope of 52 mV dec(-1), and an exceptional long-term stability of electrolysis in 1 M KOH alkaline solution >100 h. Moreover, all materials used are systematically studied using a variety of characterization techniques, resulting in enhanced activity, which is attributed to the enhanced electrical conductivity, and optimized proportion of Co (III) and Co (IV), as well as the synergistic effect between Fe with Co.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2196-7350			WOS:000454229900023

We design Ir-oxygen of hydroxyl-rich blue TiO2 through covalent bonds (Ir-O-2-2Ti) and investigate the outcome of favored exposure of different amounts of covalent Ir-oxygen linked to the conductive blue TiO2 in the acidic OER. The Ir-oxygen-blue TiO2 nanoclusters show a strong synergy in terms of improved conductivity and tiny amount usage of Ir by using blue TiO2 supporter, and enhanced stability using covalent Ir-oxygen-linking (i.e., Ir oxide) in acid media, leading to high acidic OER performance with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 342 mV, which is much higher than that of IrO2 at 438 mV in 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte. Notably, the Ir-O-2-2Ti has a great mass activity of 1.38 A/mg(Ir) at an overpotential 350 mV, which is almost 27 times higher than the mass activity of IrO2 at the same overpotential. Therefore, our work provides some insight into non-costly, highly enhanced, and stable electrocatalysts for the OER in acid media.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4344		WOS:000716977200001

Importantly, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were employed to reveal the origins of the excellent bifunctional catalytic performance of this catalyst. Moreover, the evolution of the atomic-scale structures revealed by operando XAS strongly supports the excellent stability of L-CoO during electrocatalytic operation.

In this work, we introduce a straightforward two-step fabrication procedure to synthesize free-standing single phase multicomponent nanoporous HEAs consisting of 12 or 16 different elements including both noble and non-noble metals. The electrocatalytic results reveal that the synergistic elemental combinations of such HEAs with a fine porous structure give rise to enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic activities superior to the commercial Pt/C and, at the same time, enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activity over the commercial IrO2 catalyst. The demonstrated multifunctional catalytic performance of these free-standing nanoporous HEAs would facilitate large current densities in the water splitting reactions, rechargeable Zn-air batteries, and many other catalytic, sensing, and energy applications.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10				2639-4979		WOS:000734450900001

Here, a defect rich nitrogen and sulfur co-doped graphene/iron carbide (NS-GR/Fe3C) nanocomposite as an electrocatalyst for ORR and OER is demonstrated. An ink of NS-GR/Fe3C is developed by homogeneously dispersing the catalyst in a Nafion containing solvent mixture using an ultrasonication bath (Model-DC150H; power - 150 W; frequency - 40 kHz). The ultrasonically prepared ink is used for preparing the electrode for electrochemical studies. In the case of ORR, the positive half-wave potential displayed by NS-GR/Fe3C is 0.859 V (vs. RHE) and for the OER, onset potential is 1.489 V (vs. RHE) with enhanced current density. The optimized NS-GRFe(3)C electrode exhibited excellent ORR/OER bifunctional activities, high methanol tolerance and excellent long-term cycling stability in an alkaline medium. The observed onset potential for NS-GR/Fe3C electrocatalyst is comparable with the commercial noble metal catalyst, thereby revealing one of the best low-cost alternative air-cathode catalysts for the energy conversion and storage application.									28	0	0	0	2	0	27			1350-4177	1873-2828		WOS:000532046000004	32248043

However, the low catalytic stability and conductivity impede the industrial application. Herein, the cobalt-substituted manganese oxide (MnCo-O) monolayer nanosheet was exfoliated via intercalation, and the nickel iron double hydroxide (NiFe-OH) nanosheet served as a highly active composition. The oppositely charged MnCo-O and NiFe-OH nanosheet would stack into the superlattice (MnCo/NiFe) with alternating layers of similar to 1 nm. Using potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution as the electrolyte, the MnCo/NiFe composite material delivered superior OER performances, which showed a small overpotential (233 mV) at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and low Tafel slope (46 mV dec(-1)). Such a catalyst could further present long-term catalytic durability of more than 50 h with almost no attenuation.

DFT calculation investigates that the synthetic mechanism is based on anisotropic reactivity of each etchant acted in different facets of NiCo PBA cube and can be generalized to various heterogeneous combinations by tuning their dissolution and reconstitution kinetics (i.e. NiCoB/NiS2, NiCoP/NiS2). Such strategy without adding extra metal source generates strongly coupled heterointerface with hollow, concave, and ultrathin (similar to 16.2 nm) features, which could harvest abundant active sites, tune the electronic structure, and induce strong lattice strain of Ni.

Rational design and fabrication of electrocatalysts with high specific areas, abundant expose active sites, and porous structures is an effective approach to improve the electrocatalytic performances. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), an emerging class of porous crystalline materials, which possess large surface areas, high porosities, componential and structural diversity, has shown great potential as efficient OER electrocatalysts.

However, it is a big challenge to obtain highly efficient and durable OER electrocatalysts with overpotentials below 200 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) despite the efforts made to date. In this work, the successful synthesis of supersmall alpha-Ni(OH)(2) is reported through electro-oxidation of NiSe2 loaded onto carbon nanoarrays. The obtained alpha-Ni(OH)(2) shows excellent activity and long-term stability for OER, with an overpotential of only 190 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which represents a highly efficient OER electrocatalyst. The excellent activity could be ascribed to the large electrochemical surface area provided by the carbon nanoarray, as well as the supersmall size (approximate to 10 nm) of alpha-Ni(OH)(2) which possess a large number of active sites for the reaction. In addition, the phase evolution of alpha-Ni(OH)(2) from NiSe2 during the electro-oxidation process was monitored with in situ X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analysis.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000474145600001	31264778

Here, an OER catalyst material, carbon-coated cobalt pyrophosphate/nickel phosphite (Co2P2O7/Ni(PO3)(2)@C) composite with sandwich structure, was prepared in vacuum environment by a simple method, which not only simplified the traditional two-step phosphating process but also directly formed carbon layer from homologous carbon. The tests for OER showed that the Co2P2O7/Ni(PO3)(2)@C composite had lower overpotential and Tafel slope as well as stable catalytic property in alkaline solution. In 1 M KOH, the composite exhibited the overpotential of 279 mV which was lower than that of commercial catalyst at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and its Tafel slope is 102 mV dec(-1). Due to the protection of the carbon layer, the composite exhibited good stability, so that the current density only decreased 3.9% after being cycled for 12 h. This study should help to obtain other stable electrocatalytic materials of transition metal compounds as OER catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000777369400001

Transition-metal phosphides have been used as promising electrocatalysts for OER. Incorporating heteroatoms into the lattice can induce lattice distortion and redistribution of electron density, consequently modifying the electronic structure and improving catalytic performance. Herein, Fe- and S-substituted Ni2P uniformly dispersed throughout porous carbon substrate (Ni-Fe-P-S@C) was rationally designed through transformation from the pre-synthesized NiFe-metal organic frameworks (NiFe-MOFs) by partial sulfurization and subsequent phosphorization process. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations showed that Fe and S incorporation could modulate the electronic structure of Ni2P and alter the adsorption free energies of reaction intermediates, contributing to admirable electrocatalytic activity and stability toward OER. Notably, the in-situ formed partially oxidized surface was vital to further improve the local environment. This proposed cation- and anion-substitution strategy will bring new inspiration to boost the electrocatalytic performance of transition-metal-based electrocatalysts for energy conversion applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000756780000001

These core-shell carbides, in which iron carbide is encapsulated in graphene-like layer (Fe3C@C) and nitrogen doped graphene-like layer (Fe3C@C-N) were investigated as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts to investigate the effect of the carbon shell on catalyst activity and stability. Due to the protective effect of the graphitic carbon shells, the performance of Fe3C@C and Fe3C@C-N were considerably better than the bare Fe3C nanoparticles. The OER activity of Fe3C@C-N is comparable with that of carbon-supported ruthenium oxide (RuO2/C), and this core-shell carbide has a remarkable stability and high turnover frequency under alkaline conditions. To elucidate the real active sites of these core-shell carbides, the role of the Fe3C core, Fe-N-x active sites, and effect of nitrogen doping in the shell were investigated in detail.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000674654300063

However, in practice, the efficiency of water electrolysis is limited by the large anodic overpotential of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Therefore, the development of catalysts having a low overpotential and high activity is required in order to reduce the cost and improve the efficiency of the alkaline OER. Herein, we focused on decreasing the overpotential and increasing the catalyst activity by simultaneous use of synthesized carbon-supported cobalt oxide and magnesium oxide as an electrochemical catalyst for the alkaline OER. The activity of the carbon-supported cobalt and magnesium hydroxide, Co(OH)(2)-Mg(OH)(2)/C, catalyst was dependent on the pH and metal composition ratio. The highest activity and lowest overpotential were achieved with the catalyst having a Co(OH)(2) to Mg(OH)(2) ratio of 84: 16 prepared at pH 9.5.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1452-3981			WOS:000384905600072

ACS CATALYSIS				5	2			869	873		10.1021/cs5016657				FEB 2015	2015	It is well known that transition metal oxides can efficiently catalyze electrochemical reactions of interest in electrolyzers and fuel cells. The question is how to describe and rationalize the variations in catalytic activity among a given class of oxides, so that known materials can be improved and new active materials be predicted. In this context, descriptor-based analyses are a powerful tool, as they help to rationalize the trends in catalytic activity through correlations with other properties of the material. Particularly, bulk thermochemistry has long been used to describe the trends in catalytic activity of oxide surfaces. Here we explain the reason for the apparent success of this descriptor on the basis of perovskite oxides and monoxides and the oxygen evolution reaction: essentially, bulk thermochemistry and surface adsorption energetics depend similarly on the number of outer electrons of the transition metal in the oxide. This correspondence applies to a wide number of transition metals and is responsible for the linear relationship between bulk and surface properties that enables the construction of volcano-type activity plots.									142	3	0	0	9	0	142			2155-5435			WOS:000349275300043

In this work, a facile two-step manipulation (in-situ exsolution and post-sulfurization) strategy was proposed and applied to LaCo0.2Fe0.8O3 (LCF) perovskite parent, through which, the electronic state, spatial immersion and intrinsic activity of B-site cobalt (Co) were stepwise tuned at nanoscale proximity accordingly (i.e., lattice Co ions segregated Co-0 -> embedded CoS2). Impressively, the as-prepared catalyst (S-LCF) obtains an emergent oxygen deficient microstructure seamlessly pinned with uniformly distributed CoS2 nanoparticles (NPs), which demonstrates enhanced performance toward both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and shows good stability in overall water splitting. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations illustrate the optimized metal-oxygen covalency and hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy (Delta G(H*)) on S-LCF, which further buttresses the prominence of our B-site cation engineering tactics.									18	2	0	0	0	0	17			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000569906200006

Increasingly, studies reveal that surface reconstruction occurs in several types of transition metal-based electrocatalysts, which may challenge previously developed universal structure-activity descriptors and catalytic mechanisms based on the pristine active species in original structures. The development of in situ/operando technology, which can continuously capture information on metastable species during reactions, discloses surface reconstruction processes and real active electrocatalytic species. Here, we review the surface reconstruction and in-depth active species identification of transition metal-based electrocatalysts based on in situ/oper-ando techniques to help researchers further understand the catalytic mechanisms and how to identify new active species.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2666-3864		WOS:000745651900002

It exhibits the high catalytic activity comparable to the Pt/C catalyst toward ORR, and the low overpotential of 260 mV to afford the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) toward HER. The doping of S can promote the electrocatalytic performance of Co,N-codoped graphene due most likely to the defects induced by sulfur atom.

In this work, FeOOH was electrodeposited on NiCo2O4 nanowire to form a three dimensional (3D) core-shell structure on Ni foam (NiCo2O4@FeOOH/NF) as bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting. To control the thickness of FeOOH shell layer by optimizing electrodeposition time, the NiCo2O4@FeOOH/NF(500s) with FeOOH layer of approximate to 7nm thickness exhibits excellent catalytic activity and stability for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solution. Moreover, in a two-electrode water splitting system, extremely small potential of 1.52V can be achieved for NiCo2O4@FeOOH/NF(500s), giving a current density of 10mAcm(-2). Detailed investigation reveals that the thickness of FeOOH layer, strong electronic interaction at the interface between NiCo2O4 and FeOOH play critical role in the excellent catalytic property.									29	3	0	0	1	0	29			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000445176700028

In this work, P-block element Bi is first introduced as a dopant to tune the in -situ reconstruction of Ni3S2 pre-catalyst towards enhanced OER activity. Analysis revealed that Bi doping adjusts the electronic structure of Ni3S2, improves its stability, and leads to mild surface oxidation forming supported Bi-NiOOH species. Theoretical calculations showed that Bi dopant serves as electron depletion center to provide electrons for Ni and O, and reduces the energy barriers of OER intermediates. Consequently, a low OER over -potential of 339 mV is achieved by the Bi-Ni3S2/NF electrode in 1M KOH at 100 mA cm(-2). More importantly, Bi-Ni3S2-NF retains a high catalytic stability even at 200 mA cm(-2). This work unveils the role of P-block metal doping on the sulfide-based OER pre-catalyst, providing an alternative strategy for the development of high-performance electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000829312900001

In this work, a facile and scalable chemical reduction strategy is developed to synthesize FeCoNiPB non-noble metal-based amorphous high-entropy oxides for the OER in alkaline media. The FeCoNiPB oxides exhibit overpotentials of 235 and 306 mV at current densities of 10 and 100 mA/cm(2), respectively, as well as a small Tafel slope of 53 mV/dec in 1.0 M KOH solution, outperforming the performance of FeCoPB, FeNiPB, and CoNiPB oxides and the commercial RuO2, while maintaining excellent stability with negligible overpotential amplification over 40 h. The superior OER electrocatalytic efficiency and stability of the FeCoNiPB catalyst is primarily attributed to its unique amorphous high-entropy nanostructure, synergistic effect of the multiple components, and in situ-formed amorphous sheets with a thin (FeCoNi)OOH crystalline layer on the edge during long-term OER.

Here we use a dual metal-organic framework (MOF) synthesis strategy to prepare the N-doped carbon supported bimetallic FeCo nanoparticle catalysts (marked as FeCo@NC) by pyrolysis of ZnCoZIF/MIL-101(Fe) composite. The FeCo@NC exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic activity for ORR with half-wave potential of 0.89 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and robust durability for both ORR and OER (oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction), which is attributed to the generation of Fe0.26Co0.74 crystalline phase and mesopores due to the dual-MOF synthesis strategy. The rechargeable ZAB based on FeCo@NC air electrode shows a maximum energy density of 139.6mW. cm(-2) and excellent cyclic stability over 130 h, significantly surpassing the Pt and Ir-based ZAB. The present work provides a useful dual-MOF synthesis strategy for preparing high-performance multifunctional catalysts for ORR, OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

Herein, for the first time, we highlight a novel electrocatalyst based on binary nickel iron sulfide solid solution hybrids on carbon cloth for oxygen evolution reaction. Benefitting from the synergistic effect of varied phases and the interfacial connection between (Ni, Fe)S-2 and (Ni, Fe)(3)S-4 to accelerate the charge transport, the Ni incorporation to optimize the electronic structure of the hybrids and the downshift of the d-band center to facilitate the desorption of oxygen intermediates, the partial charge-transfer between Fe and Ni to boost the generation of catalytically active Ni3+ as well as the unique nanosphere structure to offer enough buffer area for the volume changes during constant redox reactions, the obtained binary nickel iron sulfide hybrids ((Ni, Fe)S-2/(Ni, Fe)(3)S-4) display high catalytic reactivity with a low overpotential of 210 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and excellent stability with negligible activity deterioration, making the hybrid a promising candidate for electrocatalytic alkaline water oxidation.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			1674-7291	1869-1870		WOS:000537367100001

X-ray diffraction and selected area electron diffraction displayed that as-prepared Ni-3(PO4)(2) nanowires were transformed into beta-Ni(OH)(2) with superlattice structure after activation. It has been found that extremely small size is crucial for the complete conversion of Ni-3(PO4)(2) and the formation of the superlattice structure. The resulting catalysts by in-situ conversion showed high activity and stability toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with an overpotential of 310 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a long-term stability of 110 h. The large amount of NiOOH in the superlattice structure not only increases the OER activity of beta-Ni(OH)(2), but also improves the oxidation potential of nickel, thereby decreasing the dissolution. This work proves the feasibility of in-situ electrochemical synthesis for high-performance and stable hydroxide catalysts towards OER.[GRAPHICS].									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1011-372X	1572-879X		WOS:000702801200002

However, preparing catalytic coatings with high surface area and good accessibility of the active sites remains challenging. We present a new approach for the synthesis of homogeneous and binder-free nickel oxide coatings comprising a highly accessible ordered mesopore structure. The synthesis is achieved via evaporation induced self assembly utilizing PEO-PB-PEO triblock copolymers as pore template and a chemical complex of Ni2+ and citric acid as precursor. Excessive crystal-lization behaviour of NiO is avoided by thermal conversion of the precursor into an amorphous Ni carbonate intermediate, followed by transition of the carbonate into the metal oxide. We present a comprehensive analysis of the obtained materials in terms of morphology, crystallinity, surface area, composition, and OER activity of differently calcined catalysts. Retaining a low crystallinity and high surface area during the synthesis proofs to be the most important factor in obtaining a highly active OER catalyst.									24	1	0	0	0	0	24			2365-6549			WOS:000395395200024

It has recently been demonstrated that the OER activity of layered double hydroxide (LDH) could be enhanced by accommodating more abundant active sites that offer optimal binding energies between intermediates. Here, we report a study of nickel iron layered double hydroxides by varying the Ni:Fe atomic ratio of the Ni1-xFex-LDH to induce changes to their physiochemical properties through which the optimum OER performance is determined. Optimized NiFe-LDH-38 (Ni0.62Fe0.38LDH) shows an excellent OER performance in alkaline electrolyte, demonstrating a potential of 1.45 V (vs RHE) at 100 mA cm(-2), which outperforms the commercial RuO2 catalyst. Also, computational simulations support the OER performance of the single NiFe-LDH phase (NF-LDH-38). This work provides not only a fundamental understanding of the effect of the Ni:Fe atomic ratio of the Ni1-xFex-LDH on OER performance but also the design strategy of lowcost, earth abundant, and active electrocatalysts toward water oxidation.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2574-0962			WOS:000828690800001

Cu2O-Co3O4/CN is synthesized by an easy two-step reaction of melamine with Cu2O-Co3O4/CN composite. The designed composite is aimed to solve energy challenges by producing hydrogen and oxygen via electrochemical catalysis. The proposed composite offers some unique advantages in water splitting. Carbon imparts superior conductivity, while the water oxidation abilities of Cu2O and Co3O4 are considered to constitute a catalyst. The synthesized composite (Cu2O-Co3O4/CN) is characterized by SEM, EDS, FTIR, TEM, and AFM in terms of the size, morphology, shape, and elemental composition of the catalyst. The designed catalyst's electrochemical performance is evaluated via linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV).

The rational design of efficient catalyst and understanding of structure-property relationship in catalysis still remain grand challenge. Herein, nitrogen-coordinated CoS2 ultrafine nanoparticles (NPs) self-encapsulated in graphene (N-CoS2@graphene) are obtained through employing zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) as precursors. An insitu N-coordinated and graphene self-encapsulated strategy is developed to improve the catalytic activity and stability. As expected, the N-CoS2@graphene achieved an extremely low overpotentials of only 205 and 292 mV at the current density of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) for OER, respectively, showing superior activities as compared with state-of-the-art transition-metal-based catalysts. Mechanism explorations reveal that the N-CoS2@graphene offers unique graphene self-encapsulated structure and modulated electron structure of the catalytic sites, which synergistically promotes intrinsic activity and stablility of catalyst. It is expected that the strategy presented here provides prospects for the design of other highly active electrocatalysts for energy conversion.									29	1	0	0	3	0	29			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000521513300081

IrO2 is subjected to heat treatment at the synthesis and at the preparation of the catalyst layer, and fundamental studies regarding the synthesis conditions, resulting surface properties, and crystallinity with respect to the heat treatment are therefore of great importance. Herein, we prepared IrO2 thin films annealed at different temperatures and investigated the relationship among the OER activity, crystallinity, film resistivity, and annealing temperature using various analytical techniques. We show that the areal OER activity decreases as the annealing temperature increases, but the specific OER activity remains unchanged. There was no correlation between the specific OER activity and film properties such as conductivity. On the other hand, a correlation was observed between the electrochemical active surface area and Ir 4f peak position, which changed with the annealing temperature of the prepared IrO2 films.

In this work, we report Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) on nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon (NC) as a novel and highly-active bi-functional catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The NC is prepared using organic waste, namely banana peels. The carbonization, heteroatom doping, and surface functionalization are achieved simultaneously during a facile synthesis process. The obtained NC is characterized by large mesopores with a specific surface area of 457.6 m(2) g(-1) The electrochemical measurements reveal that, the current density of the BSCF/NC in 0.1 mol L-1 KOH reaches -3 mA cm(-2) at 0.74 V and 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.58 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode. Furthermore, the hybrid shows a smaller onset potential and larger current density towards both ORR and OER in comparison to composites made of BSCF and common commercial carbon supports, including acetylene black (AB) carbon, activated carbon (AC), and Vulcan XC-72 carbon. Besides enhancing the surface area and the dispersion of BSCF, the electronic interaction between BSCF and NC likely renders the enhanced activity. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Herein, FeNiCo trimetallic crystalline-amorphous nanohybrids were grown directly on Ni foam (NF) by a simple hydrothermal process followed by partial in situ vulcanization treatment with low concentration of Na2S. The as-prepared Fe0.5Ni0.5Co2-S/NF possessed a top-scale activity toward OER in 1 M KOH, displaying rather low overpotentials of 251 mV to obtain a large current density of 50 mA cm(-2). Additionally, Fe0.5Ni0.5Co2-S/NF also exhibited excellent corrosion stability and sufficient mechanical strength. The remarkable OER performance of Fe0.5Ni0.5Co2-S/NF was mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of the multiple nanocrystal particles (Co-5(O9.48H8.52)NO3, NiOH, Fe1-xS, Ni3S4, and NiCo2S4), the crystalline-amorphous nanohybrids states, and the porous 3D morphology.

Herein, bimetallic N-doped carbon electrocatalysts with various morphologies are derived from Hofmann-type metal-organic frameworks by carbonization and oxidization. Notably, the flower-like nano-catalyst FeNi@OCNF exhibits core@shell structure, hierarchical pore network and large specific surface area (331.3 m(2) g(-1)), leading to tunable electronic structure, efficient mass transfer as well as abundant exposed active sites. Moreover, the formative FeCx, NiO and FeNi bimetal mutually optimize electronic structure of graphitic layer, conducing to high property. FeNi@OCNF demonstrates an excellent OER performance with a low overpotential of 281 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), signally outperforming the other catalyst CoNi@OCNP (373 mV) and commercial IrO2 (308 mV), and also owns long-term stability.

The surfactants were non-ionic Pluronic (R) F127 and ionic octadecyl trimethylammonium bromide (OTAB). The study revealed a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 89 m(2) g(-1) for Co3O4 synthesized from Pluronic (R) F127 having narrow mesopores in an unrestricted fashion with sheet like morphology. However, Co3O4 synthesized from OTAB provided pores in a restricted manner with low intensity of mesopores, spherical morphology and a BET surface area of 46 m(2) g(-1). Electrochemical studies revealed that the reactivity of Co3O4 synthesized from F127 towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was much superior, with an outstanding mass activity of 123.1 A g(-1) and turnover frequency of 0.286 s(-1). Impedance spectroscopy further disclosed that interfacial resistance and resistance towards surface adsorbed intermediates formation during OER decreased significantly, presumably due to the material's narrow mesopores which improves the electrochemically accessible surface area, while the sheet like morphology improved the electrical conductivity.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000468631600012

Spinel cobalt oxide nanoparticles with well-defined cubic and octahedral morphologies were prepared, which predominantly expose the (100) and (111) surfaces, respectively. The OER activity of spinel cobalt oxide, measured in terms of current density, increases with higher relative proportion of the (111) surface, which can be attributed to the higher density of cobalt ions on the (111) surface compared to that on the (100) surface. The surfaces of cobalt oxide nanocubes are slighted reduced compared to those of nanooctahedra prior to OER testing. Based on chronoamperometry experiments, the nanocubes exhibited higher stability compared to the nanooctahedra, which could be due to the lower surface energy of the (100) surface compared to the (111) surface. The dependence of OER activity and stability on spinel cobalt oxide crystal facets demonstrates the importance of surface orientation in catalyst performance optimization.									160	5	0	0	5	0	162			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000364024100104	26473390

In this work, the surface oxidations of the cobalt carbonate (Co(CO3)(0.5)OH.0.11H(2)O) and Co3O4 nanowires during the OER are carefully investigated by contrasting the polarization curves, Tafel plots, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra, before and after the 1000th cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycling in 1 M KOH alkaline solution. The overpotentials required to reach a current density (j) of 20 mA cm(-2) (eta(2)(0)) are estimated to be 313 mV for the 300 degrees C-calcined Co3O4, 350 mV for the 400 degrees C-calcined Co3O4, 365 mV for the 500 degrees C-calcined Co3O4, and 373 mV for the cobalt carbonate (Co(CO3)(0.5)OH center dot 0.11H(2)O). The Tafel slope of cobalt carbonate (Co(CO3)(0.5)OH center dot 0.11H(2)O) nanowires is the highest at 93 mV dec(-1), while it is measured to be 57 mV dec(-1) for the 300 degrees C-calcined Co3O4, 47 mV dec(-1) for the 400 degrees C-calcined Co3O4, and 79 mV dec(-1) for the 500 degrees C-calcined Co3O4. As a result, the oxidation from Co2+ to Co3+ within Co3O4 during the OER is detected, which improves the OER activity. On the other hand, the formation of cobalt hydoxide is found on the surface of the Co3O4 nanowires during the OER in alkaline solution, which decreases the OER activity. For the surface oxidation of the cobalt carbonate (Co(CO3)(0.5)OH center dot 0.11H(2)O) nanowires, the increase in the amounts of Co3+ and oxygen vacancy and the formation of O-C-O and carbonates are found, which highly enhance the OER activity. These findings indicate that the surface redox kinetics during the electrocatalytic reactions should be considered important in order to enhance the electrocatalytic activity, and furthermore can provide insight into future challenges in designing advanced electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2053-1591		WOS:000776453400001

We present a novel and high-performance electrocatalyst based on nanowires of mixed transition metal oxysulfide supported by three-dimensional highly porous graphene networks. Electrochemical studies indicated that the high electron transport medium of nanowires and bilayer graphene nanosheets as well as their high active surface area promote the kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A quite small overpotential of 260 mV at the current density of 20 mA.cm-2 in 1.0 M NaOH is achieved, which outperforms most of the current carbon-based supported nanostructured electrocatalysts. The electrocatalyst is also very stable in the alkaline medium with a low Tafel slope of 56.8 mV dec-1 and turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.85 mol O2 per sec. These figures of merit demonstrate the higher performance of the hybrid anode over other noble metal-free electrocatalysts based on both carbon and metal nanostructures.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000659191700005

To solve this problem, we highly dispersed the 2-3 nm CeO2-x particles on single-layered NiFe-LDH to form CeO2-x/NiFe-LDH heterostructure by a one-step co-precipitation method. CeO2-x, as an electron acceptor, can extract electrons from Ni sites of NiFe-LDH via Ni-O-Ce electron exchange effect, thus achieving direct Ni2+/Ni3+ electron transfer with no need of NixFe(1-x)(OH)(2)/NixFe(1-x)OOH phase transformation. As a result of efficient electron transfer by strong interface interactions between CeO2-x and NiFe-LDH, the CeO2-x/NiFe-LDH exhibits excellent OER performance with a low OER overpotential of 216 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 74.1 mV dec(-1). Our work provides a new strategy to improve the OER performances of NiFe-based materials.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000783869100002

A range of Co3O4 nanowires with variable diameters was prepared by replication of SBA-15 silica with different degree of interconnectivity and pore sizes. These nanowires could be further transformed to CoO rock-salt structure through a selective reduction process by keeping the initial morphology and textural parameters. The electrocatalytic screening showed that CoO with the smallest nanowire diameter and open pore structure showed superior activity in the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to the higher amount of available active centers and defect sites. The overpotential to reach 10 mA/cm(2) drops from 392 to 337 mV after reduction of Co3O4 to CoO. An in situ Raman spectroscopy investigation showed that Co3O4 retained its bulk crystalline spinel phase while CoO faced an irreversible phase transformation into a distorted spinel structure after OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1434-1948	1099-0682		WOS:000790570900001

However, pure Co3O4 has the disadvantages of poor conductivity and low catalytic activity. Here, we successfully synthesized three-dimensional (3D) network Co3O4 composed of nanowires grown on nickel foam (NF). Using a lithium-ion rocking chair transport mechanism, Co3O4 nanowires were transformed into porous amorphous Co3O4, which greatly reduces the resistance in the OER process and enhances active site exposure. Meanwhile, the increase of Co2+ greatly improved the OER performance. However, excessive cycling of lithium-ion batteries can form a thick solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the surface, which has a negative impact on OER. Specifically, we found that 5-cycle Co3O4 has the best OER performance, showing an initial potential of 1.42 V vs RHE, a reduced overpotential of 311 mV at 50 mA cm-2 and a low Tafel slope of 76 mV decade-1, which is better than commercial RuO2.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for water splitting and rechargeable metal-air batteries. However, the identification of efficient and robust non-noble-metal-based OER electrocatalysts remains a major hurdle for large-scale hydrogen production. Herein, NiVP@NiFeV-LDH heterojunction catalysts were constructed by phosphidation and hydrothermal processing, because OER activity can be improved by coupling NiVP and NiFeVLDH. NiVP@NiFeV-LDH/NF exhibited remarkable OER performance with an ultralow overpotential of 317 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 83.0 mV dec(-1) in an alkaline environment. The high efficiency of NiVP@NiFeV-LDH/NF is attributed to increased mass and electron transport because of array structure formation and interfacial electronic structure optimisation, respectively. This work provides a novel approach for augmenting the OER performance of non-noble-metal-based electrocatalysts for energy conversion applications. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

This work reports Pd nanoparticle-interspersed nickel cobalt hydroxide carbonate nanothorn-coated copper hydroxide nanotube arrays grown on a copper foam (CH@NCHC NT-Pd/CF) as highly efficient OER electrocatalytic electrodes. The nanothorns and open-structured nanotubes have large surface areas and plenty of active sites. Particularly, the interfacial interaction between Pd nanoparticles and NCHC nanothorns causes charge transfer and redistribution, which are highly beneficial to promoting OER The unique 3D integrated construction also can accelerate the electron and mass transfer and improve structural stability. Owing to the above merits, CH@NCHC NT-Pd/CF shows excellent OER electrocatalytic activity and stability in alkaline solution, delivering a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 207 mV and small voltage fluctuation in 12 h of electrolysis.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2168-0485			WOS:000489986400068

In this paper, we report that the electrocatalytic activity of WO3 for HER can be enhanced by incorporation of tantalum ions (Ta5+) into the lattice of WO3. The most active performance is achieved with the molar ratio of Ta/W being 0.01, which is two times more active than that of undoped WO3 at an overpotential of -0.52 V. It is shown that incorporation of proper Ta5+ into WO3 can induce moderate defects and oxygen vacancies, as well as intercalate a higher amount of protons, which enhance the electron transfer and short the protons diffusion paths. These changes correlated positively with the enhanced catalytic HER activity. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that metal ions-doped WO3 nanowires are promising electrocatalysts for HER.

Emerging catalyst materials are strongly requested toward superior electrocatalytic activities and practical applications. In this study, transition metal hydroxysulfides are presented as bifunctional OER/ORR electrocatalysts for Zn-air batteries. By simply immersing Co-based hydroxide precursor into solution with high-concentration S2-, transition metal hydroxides convert to hydroxysulfides with excellent morphology preservation at room temperature. The as-obtained Co-based metal hydroxysulfides are with high intrinsic reactivity and electrical conductivity. The electron structure of the active sites is adjusted by anion modulation. The potential for 10 mA cm(-2) OER current density is 1.588 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and the ORR half-wave potential is 0.721 V versus RHE, with a potential gap of 0.867 V for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis. The Co3FeS1.5(OH)(6) hydroxysulfides are employed in the air electrode for a rechargeable Zn-air battery with a small overpotential of 0.86 V at 20.0 mA cm(-2), a high specific capacity of 898 mAh g(-1), and a long cycling life, which is much better than Pt and Ir-based electrocatalyst in Zn-air batteries.									507	34	0	0	18	0	508			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000410762400029	28714208

In this regard, we used waste CF as a biomass precursor and nitrate salts of nickel and cobalt to synthesize a highly porous composite through a solvothermal reaction. After characterization of nanocomposite using different physical and electrochemical techniques, it was used in fabrication of an electrochemical supercapacitor as well as hydrogen and oxygen evolution. The composite demonstrated remarkable electrochemical properties such as fast electrochemical reactions, high conductivity, and high reversibility. In addition, the prepared nanocomposite showed high-specific capacitance of 2000 F g(-1) (with current density of 0.5 mA cm(-)(2) or 1 A g(-1)) as a supercapacitor. It also shows high energy density about 280 Wh kg(-1) and high power density of 55 kW kg(-1) as a positive electrode against an active carbon electrode in an asymmetric capacitor at potential range between 0 and 1.5 V. Moreover, the synthesized composite showed noticeable catalytic ability toward hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with onset potentials of -0.03 and 1.48 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode, respectively. The OER performance of the resulting composite was better than standard platinum electrode. The optimal electrocatalyst (CFAC/Ni&Co oxides) revealed a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at the overpotentials of 87 mV for the HER and a current density of 20 mA at the overpotentials of 230 mV for OER, respectively. Moreover, it also showed a relatively low cell voltage (1.71 V) at a current density of 30 mA cm(-2) for the overall water electrolysis.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000639358400001

The choice of materials for this reaction in acid is limited to the platinum group metals; high loading required of these scarce and expensive elements severely limit the scalability of such technology. Ruthenium oxide is among the best catalysts for OER, however the reported activity and stability can vary tremendously depending on the preparation conditions and pre-treatment. Herein, we investigate the effect of oxidation treatment on mass-selected Ru nanoparticles in the size range between 2 and 10 nm. The effect of two distinct oxidation pre-treatments on the activity and stability have been investigated: (1) thermal oxidation; and (2) oxidation with an oxygen plasma under vacuum. We report that activity and stability can be tuned by using different oxidation pre-treatments. Thermally oxidized particles exhibited the lowest activity, although over an order of magnitude higher than the state of the art, and the highest stability. Plasma-treated particles showed intermediate performance between as-deposited and thermally oxidized NPs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We demonstrate the versatility of the method by growing an octonary materials system, which we characterize with high-throughput methods, and reveal variations in several physico-chemical properties. Among others, we examine the materials library in the frame of the oxygen evolution reaction and show that nanostructuring leads to NiO clusters that are active towards such a reaction. Our scheme can be readily extended to include more starting elements, and can be transferred to other deposition methods, making this an adaptable and versatile platform for combinatorial materials science.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1369-7021	1873-4103		WOS:000731402500014

Herein, oxygen-incorparated MoSx with abundant undercoordinated Mo atoms is fabricated by a facile solvothermal procedure, which realizes synergistically structural and electronic regulations of MoS2 inert basal planes. Experiment results reveal that oxygen incoparation can effectively modulate the electronic structure and further optimize the intrinsic conductivity, while the defect-rich structure with abundant undercoordinated Mo atoms increases the number of active sites. Moreover, the influence of solvothermal temperature on activity of MoS2-x is also investigated. The achieved MoSx electrocatalyst prepared at 220 degrees C exhibits a superior activity for HER with a low overpotential of 191 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 67 mV dec(-1), and an excellent stability due to the largest surface area and superior conductivity.

Herein, the unsupported RuIr alloys are reported as robust electrocatalysts for pH -universal overall water splitting. The as-synthesized Ru0.5Ir0.5 alloy exhibits unexpected low overpotentials of 4, 28, 16 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 160, 176, 248 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1.0 M KOH and 1.0 M PBS solutions, respectively. Especially, the Ru0.5Ir0.5|| Ru0.5Ir0.5 cell only needs voltages of 1.44, 1.48 and 1.51 V in the three environments to reach the same current density for overall water splitting and can continuously operate for more than 400, 100 and 100 h. Comprehensive studies verify that the excellent electrocatalytic performance of Ru0.5Ir0.5 originates from the uniform arrangement of Ru and Ir atoms in the alloy, which leads to the leaching of an appropriate amount of Ru atoms and thus produces a protective skeleton composed of high valence Ir (IV) to prevent further dissolution of Ru. In addition, the weak coupling between Ru and Ir makes electron transfer from Ir to adjacent Ru as active sites, resulting in optimal adsorption strength for key intermediates.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000827979100005

However, structural-dependant and low stability severely hinder their overall performance and catalytic efficiency. Herein, we report the enhancement of OER activity via vanadium doping into the CoFe hydr(oxy)oxide electrocatalyst (denoted as CoFeV). Our results show that the incorporation of vanadium induces fragmentation of the polycrystalline structure of the CoFe hydr(oxy)oxide (CoFe) and transformation to a more active amorphous structure, greatly exposing the CoO and FeOOH active sites on the surface for OER. The optimised electrocatalyst exhibits an overpotential of 376 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and requires a small Tafel slope of 26 mV dec(-1) for OER in alkaline media. These results illustrate that vanadium doping can efficiently improve the catalytic activity of CoFeV which can be extended to other vanadium-doped transition metal hydr(oxy)oxides as promising electrocatalysts for OER applications.

It is found that Sr substitutions have the effect of straightening the octahedral cage, aligning atoms along the Co-O-Co axis, and increasing the average oxidation state of the Co cations. As a consequence, both the 'ex situ electronic conductivity as well as the activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction are considerably improved. According to density-functional theory calculations, the alignment of the Co-O-Co bonds and the oxidation of the Co cations enhance the overlap between the occupied O 2p valence bands and the unoccupied Co 3d conduction bands, rationalizing the improvement of the conductivity as a function of the Sr fraction. Additionally, a study of the surface properties as a function of the Sr fraction, carried out by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), provides insight both on surface composition and its effects on the OER activity.									203	6	0	0	10	0	204			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000365465600017

Herein, we report a surfactant-assistant method to accelerate the nano/micro-bubble detachment and the mass transfer rate by reducing the surface tension, resulting in an increase in overall efficiency. Four kinds of surfactants are studied in this work. Only potassium perfluorobutyl sulfonate (PPFBS), which has the structural similarity to Nafion, shows a significant promotion of activity and stability for both hygrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the acidic medium at the high current density region. The HER overpotential at 0.1 A.cm(-2) decreased 22%, and the current density at -0.4 V increased 31% by adding PPFBS. The promotion of overall efficiency by PPFBS on a homemade PEMWE was also proven. The reduced surface tension and electrostatic repulsion were the probable origins of the accelerated bubble detachment.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000819296700002

The OER performance measured at 0.7 V (vs Hg/HgO) in 1.0 M KOH results in a fivefold increase in the turnover frequency for Ni-CP-CNT compared to Ni-CP (0.118 vs 0.022 s(-1)). Moreover, Ni-CPCNT maintains a high conductivity of 0.431 S cm(-2), while that of Ni-CP is low at 0.117 S cm(-2). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses confirm the phase reversibility of Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH in Ni-CP-CNT but show irreversible and unstable behavior of Ni-CP.

Herein, we synthesized Fe-Doped NiSe2 nanospheres distribute on reduced graphene oxide sheets (Ni0.7Fe0.3Se2/rGO). The optimum ratio (30%) of rGO was ascertained by comparing the properties of catalysts with different rGO amounts. In alkaline electrolyte, the Ni0.7Fe0.3Se2/rGO-30% owns the better OER performance than those of Ni0.7Fe0.3Se2 and NiSe2, ascribed to the unique architecture that Ni0.7Fe0.3Se2 nanospheres decorate rGO. In the architecture, the rGO matrix increases conductivity, enlarges transfer rate of ions and electrons and promotes dispersion of Ni0.7Fe0.3Se2. In addition, multiple atomic interaction of Ni/Fe atoms and the synergistic effect between the Ni0.7Fe0.3Se2 and rGO enable the compound to he an efficient OER catalyst.

The nanocomposites showed significant OER activity in alkaline media, and the current densities of 10 and 20 mA cm(-2) could be obtained at 1.49 and 1.51 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), respectively. The impedance study confirms favorable OER activity on the surface of the prepared nanocomposites. The nanocomposite is cost-effective and can be capitalized in various energy storage technologies.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2046-2069		WOS:000494684600006	35529970

However, the problem of hazardous Cr dissolving out from the SS during the surface treatment needs to be solved urgently. Herein, we report a kind of self-supported Ni-Fe oxyhydroxide pagoda-shaped nanocone array prepared through an environmentally friendly method, which can be developed as an electrocatalyst for OER with low overpotential, small Tafel slope, and good stability under alkaline condition. This route ensures good catalytic performance of the prepared electrode and eliminates the leach of Cr ion at the same time.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2196-0216			WOS:000747395000005

Single-atom catalysts have attracted special attention due to atomic-scale active sites. However, it is a huge challenge to obtain atomic-scale CoOx catalysts. The Co-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) own atomically dispersed Co ions, which motivates to design a possible pathway to partially on-site transform these Co ions to active atomic-scale CoOx species, while reserving the highly porous features of MOFs. In this work, for the first time, the targeted on-site formation of atomic-scale CoOx species is realized in ZIF-67 by O-2 plasma. The abundant pores in ZIF-67 provide channels for O-2 plasma to activate the Co ions in MOFs to on-site produce atomic-scale CoOx species, which act as the active sites to catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction with an even better activity than RuO2.									283	15	0	0	17	0	283			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000412319400005

A conventional water electrolyzer concurrently generates H-2 and O-2 in neighboring electrode compartments separated by a membrane, which brings about compromised purity, energy efficiency, and system durability. On the basis of distinct redox electrochemistry, here, we report a system that enables the decoupling of both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) from the electrodes to two spatially separated catalyst bed reactors in alkaline solutions. Through a pair of close-loop electrochemical-chemical cycles, the system operates upon 7,8-dihydroxy-2-phenazinesulfonic acid (DHPS) and ferricyanide-mediated HER and OER, respectively, on Pt/Ni(OH)(2) and NiFe(OH)(2) catalysts. Near unity faradaic efficiency and sustained production of hydrogen has been demonstrated at a current density up to 100 mA/cm(2). The superior reaction kinetics, particularly the HER reaction mechanism of DHPS as a robust electrolyte-borne electron and proton carriers, were scrutinized both computationally and experimentally. We anticipate the system demonstrated here would provide an intriguing alternative to the conventional water electrolytic hydrogen production.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000611083700031	33332111

Here, we report a green method to synthesize isolated cobalt atoms embedded ultrathin nitrogen-rich carbon as a dual-catalyst for lithium-oxygen batteries. The achieved electrode with maximized exposed atomic active sites is beneficial for tailoring formation/decomposition mechanisms of uniformly distributed nano-sized lithium peroxide during oxygen reduction/evolution reactions due to abundant cobalt-nitrogen coordinate catalytic sites, thus demonstrating greatly enhanced redox kinetics and efficiently ameliorated over-potentials. Critically, theoretical simulations disclose that rich cobalt-nitrogen moieties as the driving force centers can drastically enhance the intrinsic affinity of intermediate species and thus fundamentally tune the evolution mechanism of the size and distribution of final lithium peroxide. In the lithium-oxygen battery, the electrode affords remarkably decreased charge/discharge polarization (0.40V) and long-term cyclability (260 cycles at 400mAg(-1)). The performance of Li-O-2 batteries is largely determined by the oxygen electrocatalytic reactions at the cathode. Here, the authors report cobalt single-atom catalysts anchored on carbon nanosheets. The design improves oxygen redox kinetics and enables good electrochemical performance.									141	12	0	0	11	0	142			2041-1723			WOS:000522436700003	32221290

Moreover, oxygen is a major constituent of all biopolymers fundamental to living organisms. Besides O-2, reactive oxygen species (ROS), among them hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), are also important reactants in the present aerobic metabolism. According to a widely accepted hypothesis, aerobic metabolism and many other reactions/pathways involving O-2 appeared after the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis. In this study, the hypothesis was formulated that the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) was at least able to tolerate O-2 and detoxify ROS in a primordial environment. A comparative analysis was carried out of a number of the O-2(-) and H2O2-involving metabolic reactions that occur in strict anaerobes, facultative anaerobes, and aerobes. The results indicate that the most likely LUCA possessed O-2-and H2O2-involving pathways, mainly reactions to remove ROS, and had, at least in part, the components of aerobic respiration. Based on this, the presence of a low, but significant, quantity of H2O2 and O-2 should be taken into account in theoretical models of the early Archean atmosphere and oceans and the evolution of life. It is suggested that the early metabolism involving O-2/H2O2 was a key adaptation of LUCA to already existing weakly oxic zones in Earth's primordial environment.									35	1	0	0	30	0	35			1531-1074	1557-8070		WOS:000308811500006	22970865

In this work, a pi-conjugated molecule (2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene, HHTP), which can accelerate the electron transfer, is coated directly on pristine ZIF-67, resulting in a composite named HHTP@ZIF-67, via a simple one-step solvothermal method. The obtained HHTP@ZIF-67 possesses a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of 2013.9 m(2) g(-1) and displays microporous behavior, which can provide enough active sites for OER. The double-layer capacitance of HHTP@ZIF-67 is also enhanced, corresponding to an enlarged electrochemical active surface area. HHTP@ZIF-67 presents a quite low overpotential of 238 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 m KOH.

The electrocatalytic performance in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be greatly improved by incorporating the hetero-metallics into MOFs. Herein, the OER performance was significantly improved by the incorporation of Fe3+ ions into the crystalline cobalt-based MOF, leading to amorphous structure. Benefiting from the optimized surface morphology and electrochemical surface area, charge transport, was greatly facilitated. The Fe/Co aMOF with 1/4 ratio (labeled as AFC-MOFs (1 : 4)) exhibited an excellent and stable OER activity, with an ultralow overpotential (256 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel slope of 42.7 mV dec(-1). XAS found that the majority of Co2+ in AFC-MOFs (1 : 4) is converted to low-spin Co3+ upon OER, while Fe3+ is maintained during the OER process, supporting the synergistic catalytic mechanism between Fe and Co. This material outperforms benchmark IrO2, which could be attributed to the hollow amorphous structure and the optimized electronic properties.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1434-1948	1099-0682		WOS:000605433200001

In this work, the CoMoS4 nanosheet-intercalated Co layered metal oxide (i-CoMoS4 @CoLMO) is synthesized by growth of CoMoS4 in Co layered double hydroxide (CoLDH), followed by calcination. The intercalated CoMoS4 enlarges the lattice spacing of Co-LMO and boosts oxygen vacancy of stacked nanosheets, and the produced i-CoMoS4 @Co-LMO simultaneously shows exceptional bifunctional catalytic performances of oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction due to the enhanced mass transport pathways and the fostered catalytic sites. Accordingly, a large peak power density of 130 mW cm(-2) and an excellent durability (over 270 cycles) are exhibited by Zn-air batteries based on i-CoMoS4 @Co-LMO as electrocatalyst, with diffusion limited current-4.21 mA cm(-2), half-wave potential of 0.77 V vs RHE and high capacity of 960 mA h g(-1) at energy density of 1104 Wh kg(-1).

In this work, a systematic strategy is demonstrated to simultaneously optimize the OER thermodynamic and kinetic activity via introducing a series of transition and main group metal atoms into the NiFe-LDH host layers. Typically, V, Co, and Cr dopants largely promote the intrinsic activity of NiFe-LDH through the effective electron transfer from Fe3+ in NiFe-LDH laminate to the doping metals, while the introduction of V, Ti, and Mn into NiFe-LDH facilitates the kinetics of water oxidation due to the increased conductivity induced by dopants. Furthermore, the detailed experiments and density functional theory calculations illustrate that the presence of suitable heteroatoms (V) lowers the activation energy barrier for OER rate-limiting step as well as promotes the electron transfers by effective electronic modification. This work provides an effective strategy to modulate the OER activity of LDHs and determine their performance trends for a more rational design of high-performed OER electrocatalysts.									27	1	0	0	0	0	28			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000615791600001

The samples are characterized by TGA, XRD, TEM, XPS and Raman analyses. Their behaviors as supercapacitors and catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have been investigated in 0.5 M H2SO4 medium. it was demonstrated that pure RuO2 presented the highest super capacitive property, and that addition of iridium leads to decrease this property. On the other hand, pure RuO2 presented the lower onset potential for OER, but tended to be passivated as the potential was increased.

Despite continuous controversial debate on the active sites/species, the presence of N is believed to be undeniably needed for the efficient catalysis, whereas the necessity and role of Fe are still debated. To clearly understand the role of Fe in Fe and N-functionalized electrocatalyst, N-doped hollow mesoporous shell carbon (N-HMSC) is prepared as a uniform model electrocatalyst by a simple template nanocasting using Fe phthalocyanine (FePc) as a single precursor for carbon, N, and Fe. It is found that the presence of Fe in N-HMSC leads to the efficient graphitization of N-HMSC structure, which can be beneficial for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Interestingly, it is observed that Fe is a must for the preparation of high efficient catalyst, but may not be necessary for OER. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The transformation pathway of h-CoO for each cobalt oxide was fully elucidated. The prepared cobalt oxides were studied as catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to clarify the structureactivity relationship. Among the cobalt oxide materials, spinel Co3O4 showed the best catalytic activity. Moreover, spinel Co3O4 was deposited directly via the oxidative phase transformation of h-CoO particles on a conductive substrate without additional coating processes. The efficient chemical adhesion of spinel Co3O4 via phase transformation indicated fast oxidation of Co3+ to Co4+, which resulted in improved OER activity.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000643727600002

Herein, we introduce a continuous self-sacrifice template strategy for synthesis of the novel NiCo2O4/Co,N-CNTs nanocages (NCs) as an efficient ORR/OER bifunctional electrocatalyst for Zn-air batteries. The NiCo2O4 and Co,N-CNTs are derived from the external and internal self-sacrifice of ZIF-67, respectively. The as-prepared NiCo2O4/Co,N-CNTs NCs display remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward ORR. (E-1/2 = 0.862 V) and OER (E-j10 = 1.569 V) simultaneously, outperforming the commercial catalysts like Pt/C and RuO2, respectively. The reversible oxygen electrode index (Delta E = E-j10 (OER) - E-1/2 (ORR)) is similar to 0.707 V in alkaline electrolyte. Interestingly, NiCo2O4/Co,N-CNTs NCs act as a cathode electrocatalyst in a primary Zn-air battery system with a high power density of 173.7 mW cm(-2). Therefore, the continuous self-sacrifice template strategy proposed in this work is expected to inspire the design of high-performance bifunctional nonprecious electrocatalysts for application in sustainable energy conversion devices.									62	7	0	0	5	0	69			2168-0485			WOS:000441475500056

J	Vonrueti, Nathalie; Aschauer, Ulrich								The role of metastability in enhancing water-oxidation activity								PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS				21	44			24354	24360		10.1039/c9cp04859f				NOV 28 2019	2019	While metastability enhanced water-oxidation activity was experimentally reported, the reason behind this effect is still unclear. We determine here, using density functional theory calculations, oxygen evolution reaction overpotentials for a variety of defective (001) surfaces of three different perovskite materials. For all three, we find a large range of overpotentials for different reaction sites including also overpotentials at the top of the activity volcano. Assuming that these sites dominate the apparent catalytic activity, this implies that a large number of geometrically different reaction sites, as they occur when a catalyst is operated at the border of its stability conditions, can lead to a strong enhancement of the apparent activity. This also implies that a pre-treatment of the catalyst creating a variety of different reactive sites could lead to superior catalytic activities for thermodynamically stable materials.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000498220500008	31641703

Amongst these QDs, nickel selenide quantum dot (NiSeQD) materials have gained much interest from researchers over the past few years due to their outstanding properties. These include excellent catalytic activity, good electrical conductivity for charge transfer, and excellent thermodynamic stability. NiSeQD material is relatively cheap, less toxic, and can be synthesised easily. Due to the fascinating and remarkable properties of NiSeQD, the material has been applied in various electrochemical fields, including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and solar cells. This review focuses on the application of NiSeQD and its composites in the various analytical fields in the search for alternative renewable sources of energy. Interestingly, NiSeQD material can be modified with different materials to improve its sensitivity, reactivity, and limit of detection. The effects of modification with other materials such as iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), and graphene (GN) are mentioned. Additionally, the application of NiSeQD in glucose sensing is discussed briefly. In these aforementioned applications, NiSeQD has shown excellent electrocatalytic capability with satisfactory detection limits and good conductivity. Thus, further exploration of it to other fields is essential. This review highlights the importance of NiSeQD in water purification, and no report has been documented in the literature on its application in water purification. Some gaps are still open for the use of NiSeQD material as an electroactive platform for sensing devices in water treatment.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1040-0397	1521-4109		WOS:000578222700001

In this way, a representative set of materials of general formula LaMn1-xCoxO3 was obtained whose composition extends from LaMnO3 to LaCoO3. These perovskites, as promising materials for oxygen reduction or oxygen evolution reactions, were characterized by several imaging (SEM), spectroscopic (XPS, EDX) and diffraction (XRD) techniques to elucidate their structure and to demonstrate the existence of composition differences between the catalytic surface and the bulk material. Specifically, it was found that lanthanum ions prevail at the surface of the catalyst but high cobalt-substitution levels stimulate the surface enrichment in B cations in their respective higher oxidation states (Mn4+ and Co3+ against Mn3+ and Co2+). This phenomenon opens the possibility of tuning their electrocatalytic properties and to synthesize suitable materials for electrochemical reactions involving molecular oxygen. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, we highlight a facile approach to boosting the perovskite electrocatalysis for OER by the coupling of carbon quantum dots (CQDs). The as-prepared CQDs decorated Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta-perovskite nanofibers (CQDs@BSCF-NFs) catalyst achieves a low overpotential of 0.35 V at 10 mA cm(-2), favorably outperforming the individual BSCF-NFs and the commercial IrO2. The CQDs@BSCF-NFs catalyst demonstrates an outstanding current density of 140.8 mA cm(-2) at a potential of 1.65 V vs. RHE, which is (similar to)5 and 19 times higher than that of BSCF-NFs and IrO2. This significantly enhanced activity is attributed to the enlarged specific surface area, the increased surface oxygen vacancies as well as the synergy between CQDs and BSCF.

Herein, orthorhombic CoSe2 nanoparticles anchored in acid-treated Ketjenblack (o-CoSe2/AK) nanoparticles have been synthesized via a hydrothermal reaction and selenization treatment, and exhibit excellent ORR and OER performance (a half-wave potential of 0.84 V for ORR and an overpotential of 380 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER). As a catalyst for a rechargeable Zn-air battery, it possesses a largest powder density of 122.0 mW cm(-2). Surprisingly, o-CoSe2/AK has demonstrated outstanding stability and durability, especially superior to noble metals. The excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic performance is mainly ascribed to a large specific surface area, and metallic o-CoSe2 nanoparticles with a high dispersion anchored in the AK substrate surface, regulating the electronic structure.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000647355200001

Herein, it is reported that novel FeNi3/NiFeOx nanohybrids display high electrocatalytic activities in both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). These FeNi3/NiFeOx nanohybrids are obtained with the unique hydrogenation treatment of NiFeOx nanosheets. Small onset potentials of approximate to 20 and 240 mV are obtained for HER and OER, respectively, benefited from the synergistic effect of FeNi3 and NiFeOx. Only a small voltage of 1.55 V is needed to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the overall water splitting in an alkaline electrolyzer when using FeNi3/NiFeOx as both cathode and anode catalysts. This is one of the best performance of electrocatalysts for HER and OER, shining the bright future for earth-abundant, low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts for largescale production of hydrogen from water electrolysis.									68	2	0	0	1	0	68			2196-7350			WOS:000396444200002

The green and low-cost aqueous zinc-air batteries (ZABs) with high theoretical energy density are therefore drawing increasing attention. As the key materials in the air cathode, electrocatalysts that catalyze the oxygen evolution/reaction reactions (OER and ORR) significantly determine the performance of ZABs. Therefore, exploring economic and efficient oxygen catalysts is of great importance for the practical application of ZABs. Among the numerous electrocatalysts, the earth-abundant 3d transition-metal-based nanomaterials have been widely explored as a result of their low cost and high activities. This review introduces some typical and recent progresses in 3d metal-based oxygen catalysts (i.e., metals, metal compounds, and carbon-supported hybrids) for ZABs. Especially, the active sites for catalyzing OER/ORR of different catalysts are classified, and the strategies for regulating the catalytic sites and their reaction mechanism are also introduced. In the end, the challenges and perspectives for further developing 3d metal-based oxygen catalysts are briefly discussed. This review aims to provide inspirations for the exploration of low-cost and efficient electrocatalysts as cathodes for ZABs.									10	1	0	0	2	0	10			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000641201400009

Herein, we report a novel OER electrocatalyst of NiCo layered double hydroxide@NiCo-hydroxysulfide (NiCo-LDH@HOS) nanosheet arrays, which are prepared by a rapid room-temperature sulfurization of the surface of NiCo-LDH nanosheets grown on Ni foam. The surface sulfurization exerts important influences/changes on the structure, composition, surface properties and chemistry of NiCo-LDH. After surface sulfurization, the resulted NiCo-hydroxysulfide layer armor improved electrical conductivity and chemical resistance to alkaline electrolyte, delivers a stable current density of 10.0 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 293 mV in 0.1 M KOH solution, maintaining high stability during a 62 h test. The achieved enhanced oxygen evolution activity and improved durability are superior to those of NiCo-LDH nanosheets and benchmark commercial RuO2. This example of NiCo-LDH@HOS obtained via surface sulfurization with enhanced OER electrocatalysis performance, highlights an important strategy to fabricate high-performance metal hydroxide/hydroxysulfides heterostructured catalysts for OER and other electrochemical storage and conversion progress.									51	6	0	0	0	0	53			2574-0962			WOS:000458706400061

The obtained series of transition metal doped iron selenide exhibit high performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Especially, the Cu-doped FeSe2 electrocatalyst shows the lowest overpotential of 193 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) which outperforms previously reported selenide-based electrocatalysts. The experimental results and theoretical simulations demonstrate that the doping of substitutional Cu in the host lattice of FeSe2 optimizes the electronic structure, being favorable for accelerating the electron transfer and boosting reaction kinetic. Meanwhile, the special structure design enables the electrocatalyst with hierarchical structures, affording rich exposed active sites for efficient OER. Therefore, this work provides a feasible strategy for fabricating hierarchical structured metal selenides for potential electrochemical energy storage and conversion.

Herein, a novel hybrid nanostructure with Ni2P/CoP nanoparticles decorated on a porous N-doped fullerene nanorod (p-NFNR@Ni-Co-P) was developed as a bifunctional electrocatalyst. Benefiting from the electric current collector (ECC) effect of FNR for the active Ni2P/CoP nanoparticles, the p-NFNR@Ni-Co-P exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic performance for overall water splitting in alkaline medium. To deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the electrolytic cell assembled by p-NFNR@Ni-Co-P merely required a potential as low as 1.62 V, superior to the benchmark noble-metal-based electrocatalyst. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrated that the surface engineered FNR serving as an ECC played a critical role in accelerating the charge transfer during the electrocatalytic reaction. The present work paves the way for fullerene nanostructures in the realm of energy conversion and storage.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000710924900059	34610748

In this work, 3D Ni3S2 superstructures (needle array and leaf pattern) were created on nickel foams (NFs) through an in situ chemical etching (ICE) method. This anisotropic growth involves chemical dissolution, in situ nucleation and re-deposition processes, which endows the as-fabricated Ni3S2 with large surface areas and warrants firm adhesion to the NF as well. Importantly, the Ni3S2@ NF can directly serve as effective binder-free electrodes for hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) and oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) from electrocatalytic water splitting.									96	6	0	0	2	0	96			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000384238900028

In the present work, nanostructured Ni(12_x)FexP(5) (x = 1.2, 2.4, 3.6) OER electrocatalysts synthesized by a colloidal method is reported. For x = 1.2, an alloy of Ni, Fe, and P is formed. For x = 2.4 or x = 3.6, a core-shell NiFeP@Fe3O4 structure is formed. The nanoparticles are encapsulated in a self-generated carbon layer. The carbon layer is formed during synthesis from synthesis resi-dues. The carbon-encapsulated Ni9.6Fe2.4P5 catalyst offers the outstanding mass activity of 0.1 A mg_ 1 and overpotential of 220 mV at 10 mA cm_2, assigned to a combination of enhanced electrical conductivity provided by the carbon shell, a large surface area, and a high specific catalytic activity.

The obtained 1% P-NiCo2O4 exhibited better OER activity than that of pure NiCo2O4 with an overpotential of 370 mV at 10 mA cm-2, a high Cdl value of 41.8 mF cm-2, a small Tafel slope value of 95 mV dec-1, as well as remarkable stability. The superior electrochemical performances could be attributed to the formed mipor layer, resulting in the acceleration of the diffusion speed of electrolyte or ions on the interface between liquid and electrode. The correlation of experiments and DFT calculation results revealed that due to P doping, the electron density of Co and Ni around replaced O atom increased, leading to the higher ratio of Co3+/Co2+ and Ni3+/Ni2+, which is beneficial to the rate-determining step (RDS) of transformation of HO* to O*. The calculated maximum Delta G of RDS are 1.68 eV and 1.54 eV for NiCo2O4 and P-NiCo2O4, respectively, demonstrating the better OER performance of P-NiCo2O4.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2352-4928		WOS:000817999400002

Herein, the validation of improved electro-catalytic performance of an amorphous Al2O3-added Co3O4/NiO nanocomposite toward OER has been reported. Co3O4/NiO nanocomposite, 10%, 20% and 40% of amorphous Al2O3-added Co3O4/NiO nanocomposites were synthesized via a simple nitrate-citrate decomposition method. The experimental results evidenced that the 20% amorphous Al2O3-added Co3O4/NiO nanocomposite exhibits enhanced OER performance where the current density of 50 mA cm(-2) is achieved at 389 mV, demonstrating 448 mV improvement as compared to the amorphous Al2O3 free Co3O4/NiO nanocomposite. Double-layer capacitance results reveal that the enhanced OER performance, in case of 20% amorphous Al2O3-modified Co3O4/NiO nanocomposite, results similar to 3.5 times increased electrochemically active surface area. This work suggests that the addition of optimum amount of amorphous Al2O3 to the Co3O4/NiO nanocomposite offers an attractive cost-effective catalyst for water-splitting devices.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0366-6352	2585-7290		WOS:000712924800001

Doping with guest cations possessing different oxidation states such as Ag can change the chemistry of conventional transition metal oxides and hydroxides, generating unexpected electrocatalytic performances. However, Ag dopants have been found to easily segregate at the surface of electrocatalysts, which induces deactivation. Here, we fabricated Ag-doped CoOOH nanosheet arrays using electrochemical deposition, followed by a simple electrochemical diffusion approach. Surprisingly, we revealed, through atom probe tomography (APT), secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS), and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) that Ag atoms are homogeneously distributed without any detectable segregation. The Ag-doped CoOOH exhibits enhanced OER performance in terms of overpotential, both experimentally (256 mV) and theoretically (60 mV). The homogeneously distributed Ag dopants facilitate the phase transformation from Co(OH)(2) to the active phase of CoOOH. Calculations show that Ag doping enhances phase stability of CoOOH and exposed Ag dopants act as active sites by releasing -OH adsorbates.									50	3	0	0	1	0	50			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100060

Structural optimizing of carbon supports has been proven an effective way to improve the electrocatalytic performance of Pt catalysts. In this work, hierarchically porous carbon prepared by the "bread leavening method" is proved as an excellent substitution for commercial carbon black to support Pt nanoparticles due to its large specific surface area, abundant oxygen-containing functional groups and defect sites. Notably, the Pt catalyst supported on hierarchically porous carbon exhibits an outstanding catalytic performance towards hydrogen evolution reaction in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution. The over-potential is 24 mV at the current density of -10 mA cm(-2). The composite displays an onset potential of -10 mV, which is much more positive than that of the commercial Pt/C (-18 mV). Furthermore, the composite shows an excellent long-term stability after 2000 cycles and chronoamperometric response for 10 h. This work provides an ideal alternative to the commercial Pt/C to catalyze the electrochemical water splitting. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Presented power storage unit (PSU) and RPC, such as fuel cell, is based on oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Such PSUs are associated with poor kinetic ORR and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limitations. Stable and dynamic catalysts like single atom catalysts, metal-free carbon materials and nanocomposites has renovated its applications in RPC. Recent development of bifunctional catalysts (BFC) and metal organic frameworks (MOFs) for both OER and ORR has improved the stability of MABs. For the development of BFCs strategies being carried out includes micro-nano design (e.g., chemical vapor deposition, electrochemical methods, template methods and hydrothermal methods), fabrication of new materials (composite materials, transition-metal materials, and carbon), and material property alteration (oxygen defects, heteroatom doping, interfacial strain, adjustments of electronic structures, nano composites, metal-oxygen bonds, etc.).

Therefore, developing high-performance OER electrocatalysts is crucial for realizing the industrialized application of water splitting. Herein, a high-efficiency electrocatalyst of ruthenium-decorated nickel-iron hydroxide (10Ru-NiFe LDH) supported on Ni foam is successfully synthesized for OER. Modifying NiFe LDH with ruthenium can optimize the electronic density to form high valences of metal sites, which is beneficial to promote its OER performance. Consequently, the 10Ru-NiFe LDH only needs a low overpotential of 222 mV to achieve a current density of 50 mA center dot cm(-2), which exhibits fast OER kinetics with a small Tafel slope of 58 mV center dot dec(-1). Moreover, this electrocatalyst shows high stability over 20 h at a high current density of 100 mA center dot cm(-2 )without obvious decay. The decent OER performances can be ascribed to the increased active sites and the synergistic electronic interactions among Ni, Fe and Ru. This work provides an effective approach for designing desirable electrocatalysts for OER.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1001-0521	1867-7185		WOS:000797781700003		
J	Liu, Ping; Pu, Yong								Construction of two-dimensional CoPS3@defective N-doped carbon composites for enhanced oxygen evolution reaction								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				47	1			197	202		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.09.240		DEC 2021		JAN 1 2022	2022	The rational design of highly efficient, economical and environment-friendly electro-catalysts is currently an important goal of research on renewable energy conversion and storage. Herein, a facile metod was developed to construct two-dimensional composites, which consist of exfoliated CoPS3 nanosheets grafted onto defective N-doped carbon (DNC) derived from spent tea leaves. The CoPS3@DNC composites demonstrate remarkable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in an alkaline medium, with an overpotential of 297 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 51.8 mV dec(-1), which is better than that of commercial IrO2 catalysts. Our experimental evidence reveals that the enhanced OER performance of this hybrid catalyst can be attributed to the interfacial effect of exfoliated CoPS3 and N-doped carbon defects (electron transfer from the CoPS3 layer to DNC). This work suggests a promising interface engineering technique for developing highly efficient and non-precious OER catalysts based on layered transition-metal trichalcogenides.

The improvement of MnOx requires mechanistic and kinetic knowledge of the four-electron transfer steps of the OER. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, a widely used tool to characterize the electronic structure of thin films, is used in combination with surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy to gain a deeper knowledge of the different mixed MnOx types and their respective change in chemical composition. Using Raman spectroscopy during electrochemical measurements, all samples were found to reveal Birnessite-type MnO2 motifs in alkaline media at an applied potential. Their activity correlates with two shifting Raman active modes, one of them being assigned to the formation of Mn-III species, and one to the expansion of layers of MnO6 octahedra. A special activation treatment leads independent of the starting material to a highly amorphous mixed-valence oxide, which shows the highest OER activity.									13	0	0	0	2	0	12			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000599077700001

Here, a novel hierarchical core-shell nanoarray NiCo/Ni/CuO/CF was synthesized by assembling Ni-Co hydroxide nanosheets directly on the metallic nickel coated CuO nanowires, as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for alkaline OER. This NiCo/Ni/CuO/CF anode exhibited low overpotentials of 246 mV and 286 mV at current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, and a small Tafel slope of 37.9 mV dec(-1). Moreover, NiCo/Ni/CuO/CF showed robust durability at least 60 h at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2).

Nano letters											10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c03634				2022-Nov-01	2022	The overpotentials of electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) inherently originate from high electron transfer barriers of the redox couple driven water oxidation. Here, we propose a heat-induced magnetic transition strategy to reduce the spin-related electron transfer barriers. Coupling heat into electrochemical OER on a ferro-antiferromagnetic core-shell NiFeN@NiFeOOH, the heat-induced ferro-to-paramagnetic transition for NiFeN core at 55 °C and antiferro-to-paramagnetic transition for NiFeOOH shell at 70 °C significantly accelerate and accordingly achieve a cascaded Ni2+/Ni3+ driven water oxidation reaction. In addition, paramagnetic Nidelta+ (delta ≥ 3) in NiFeN@NiFeOOH can thermochemically react with water to produce oxygen. The heat-induced magnetic transition concomitantly triggers the electrochemical redox couple driven water oxidation and the thermochemical water oxidation due to that heat-induced paramagnetic spin reduces the barriers of electricity driving the spin flipping. Our findings offer new insights into constructing the heat-electricity coupling water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1530-6992		MEDLINE:36317889	36317889

More significantly, the NiCo2O4 porous nanotubes show a potential of 1.63 V at j = 20 mA cm(-2) for overall water-splitting, and there is no obvious change after running for 12 h.

However, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as a sluggish anodic reaction, usually suffers from high overpotential, which greatly impedes the efficiency of hydrogen generation. Herein, we report an ultrathin NiMn-LDH/CFC growth on commercial carbon fiber cloth (U-NiMn-LDH/CFC) substrate through a facile hydrothermal method. The U-NiMn-LDH/CFC can be successfully used to assemble an energy-saving water splitting system via integrating anodic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The as-prepared U-NiMn-LDH/CFC nanosheets with ultrathin structure exhibit reliable electrocatalytic activities toward UOR (1.351 V vs. RHE@20 mA cm(-2)) and HER (169 mV@10 mA cm(-2)). A two-electrode water splitting cell is further constructed and delivers almost 210 mV lower oxidation potential at 10 mA cm(-2) with containing (1.0 M KOH) 0.5 M urea in comparison to that in pure overall water splitting. Furthermore, the above two-electrode system shows excellent electrolysis stability.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0926-860X	1873-3875		WOS:000632901800001

Herein, comprehensive characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are combined to verify the important roles of the crystallinity and oxygen vacancy levels of Co(II) oxide (CoO) on ORR and OER activities. A facile and controllable vacuum-calcination strategy is utilized to convert Co(OH)(2) into oxygen-defective amorphous-crystalline CoO (namely ODAC-CoO) nanosheets. With the carefully controlled crystallinity and oxygen vacancy levels, the optimal ODAC-CoO sample exhibits dramatically enhanced ORR and OER electrocatalytic activities compared with the pure crystalline CoO counterpart. The assembled liquid and quasi-solid-state Zn-air batteries with ODAC-CoO as cathode material achieve remarkable specific capacity, power density, and excellent cycling stability, outperforming the benchmark Pt/C+IrO2 catalysts. This study theoretically proposes and experimentally demonstrates that the simultaneous introduction of amorphous structures and oxygen vacancies could be an effective avenue towards high-performance electrocatalytic ORR and OER.									64	4	0	0	6	0	65			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000627069200001

The NiRu@MANCNTs exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic activity and stability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The required overpotentials to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(10)) over NiRu@MWCNTs are only 14 and 240 mV, corresponding to Tafel slopes of 32 and 55 mV dec(-1) for the HER and OER in alkaline medium, respectively. Furthermore, the NiRu@MWCNTs electrolyzer shows low eta(10) of 330, 380, and 280 mV in acidic, neutral, and alkaline media, respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental results reveal that the NiRu alloy NPs attached to the defective and nondefective carbon are the key active sites for the HER and OER, respectively, thus resulting in superior isolated synergistic bifunctional active sites for overall water splitting.

The Ni3S2 nanosheets are electrodeposited onto the highly conducting Au dendrites that are grown over 3D-graphene (3DG) framework. The highest electrochemical surface area has been achieved to enhance exposure of active sites by the integration of hierarchical Au dendrites with a sufficient amount of Ni3S2 nanosheets. The optimized electrocatalyst (3DG-Au-Ni3S2-15c) delivers the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 140 mV and a lowest Tafel slope of 93 mV dec(-1) for HER. The higher HER activity is supported by the smaller charge-transfer resistance of 1.09 Omega, which confirms the faster interfacial electron transfer between the electrode and electrolyte phases. The OER experiments suggest that 3DG-Au-Ni3S2 (15c) has a higher current density of 91.2 mA cm(-2) at a potential of 1.6 V and a lower Tafel slope of 148 mV dec(-1) in alkaline media. Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals the conversion of Ni3S2 surface into the highly OER active hydrated nickel oxide during polarization experiment. With 3DG-Au-Ni3S2 (15c) as bifunctional electrocatalysts, an alkali electrolyzer delivers the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.63 V. Furthermore, this electrolyzer gives a smooth line with a very small deviation of 4% from the initial potential value for 19 h, suggesting the excellent long-term stability of 3DG-Au-Ni3S2 (15c).									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			2574-0962			WOS:000469885300081

Hydrogen is considered among the most promising clean energy sources for the future. Recently, electrochemical water splitting has been considered as one of the most efficient approaches to harvest hydrogen energy, which generates only non-pollutant water on combustion. However, the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction significantly restricts the efficiency of water splitting and requires a relatively high cell voltage to drive the electrolysis. Therefore, seeking a thermodynamically favorable anodic reaction to replace the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction by utilizing highly active bifunctional electrocatalysts for the anodic reaction and hydrogen evolution are crucial for achieving energy-efficient hydrogen production for industrial applications. Nevertheless, it is known that the oxygen evolution reaction can be replaced with other useful and thermodynamically favorable reactions to reduce the electrolysis voltage for realizing energy-efficient hydrogen production. Therefore, in this study, we present a bifunctional nickel nanoparticle-embedded carbon (Ni@C) prism-like microrod electrocatalyst synthesized via a two-step method involving the synthesis of a precursor metal-organic framework-74 and subsequent carbonization treatment for methanol oxidation and hydrogen evolution. The interfacial structure consisting of a nickel and carbon skeleton was realized via in situ carbonization. However, the dispersed nickel nanoparticles do not easily aggregate owing to the partition by the surrounding carbon as it would sufficiently expose the active Ni sites to the electrolytes, ensuring fast charge transfer between the catalyst and electrolytes by accelerating the electrochemical kinetics. In the anodic methanol oxidation, the products were detected as carbon dioxide and formate with faradaic efficiencies of 36.2% and 62.5%, respectively, at an applied potential of 1.55 V. Meanwhile, the Ni@C microrod catalyst demonstrated high activity and durability (2.7% current decay after 12 h of continuous operation) toward methanol oxidation, which demonstrates that methanol oxidation precedes oxidation under voltage forces. Notably, the bifunctional catalyst not only exhibits excellent performance toward methanol oxidation but also yields a low overpotential of 155 mV to drive 10 mA·cm~(-2) toward hydrogen evolution in 1.0 mol·L~(-1) KOH aqueous solution with 0.5 mol·L~(-1) methanol at room temperature, which guarantees the hydrogen production efficiency. More importantly, the constructed two-electrode electrolyzer produced a current density of 10 mA·cm~(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.6 V, which decreased by 240 mV after replacing the oxygen evolution reaction with methanol oxidation.			随着人类社会的高速发展,在保证环境不被破坏的情况下维持众多机械和电气设备的正常运转急需清洁的能源方式。氢被认为是在未来最有前景的清洁能源之一。近期,电化学水分解已被认为是获取氢能的最有效的方法之一,它的燃料产物只是无污染的水;然而,迟缓的析氧反应严重制约了水分解效率,导致驱动水分解的电压相对较高。探求热力学有利的阳极反应以取代缓慢的氧析出和开发高活性双功能型电催化剂用于这种阳极反应和析氢对于实现可应用于工业的节能型产氢至关重要。当前,普遍认为用其他有用的且利于热力学的反应取代析氧反应可以减小分解电压从而实现节能产氢。本文报道了一种用于甲醇氧化和析氢的双功能型嵌入镍纳米粒子的碳棱柱状微米棒电催化剂(命名为镍碳微米棒),该催化剂是由74号金属有机框架结构经碳化处理获得。这种由镍和碳构成的界面材料结构通过原位碳化实现,由于碳的分隔作用,分散的镍纳米颗粒不会轻易团聚,这有利于暴露更多的镍活性位点与电解液相接触,为更快的催化剂和电解液间电荷转移和电化学动力学提供保障。在此阳极的甲醇氧化中,产物分别为二氧化碳和甲酸,两者在1.55 V电压下的法拉第效率分别为36.2%和62.5%;同时该镍碳微米棒催化剂表现出优异的甲醇氧化活性和耐久性(12 h持续性催化,电流仅衰退2.7%)。值得注意的是,该双功能催化剂不仅具有甲醇氧化活性,在室温下含有0.5 mol·L~(-1)甲醇的1.0 mol·L~(-1)氢氧化钾电解液中的析氢过电位也较低(仅155 mV的过电位即可驱动10 mA·cm~(-2)的电流),保证了产氢效率。更重要的是,采用这种双功能型电极构造的双电极电解槽仅需1.6 V电压即可驱动10 mA·cm~(-2)的电流,与析氧反应作为阳极反应的电解槽相比驱动电压减小了240 mV。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1000-6818			CSCD:7005826

Herein, a series of binary CoV and ternary CoFeV spinel catalysts were synthesized via a solvothermal process. The particle size gradually decreased followed by the increase in metal species. As the result of ultrafine size (similar to 4 nm) and composition optimization, CoFeV spinel nanoparticles with Co:Fe:V molar ratio of 1.8:1.1:1 showed a higher performance than other congeneric Co-based spinels and benchmark RuO2 electrocatalyst in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution. The needed overpotential to reach 10 mA cm(-2) is only 248 mV with a lower Tafel slope of 52.8 mV dec(-1) and an excellent durability of over 18 h. The high activity of ternary CoFeV spinel nanoparticles was further made evident through a solar-to-hydrogen system for the overall water splitting, achieving the current density as 224 mA cm(-2) at 2.5 V with a high Faradaic efficiency of 97.7% for the hydrogen product.

In this work, cobalt oxide (Co3O4) nanowires loaded on carbon fiber paper (CFP) were synthesized via hydrothermal method and annealing. The as-synthesized Co3O4 nanowires exhibit an enhanced catalytic activity with low onset overpotential (1.52 V vs. RHE) and a small overpotential of 330 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 60 mV ai... dec(-1). In addition, the Co3O4 nanowires maintain its electrocatalytic activity for at least 24 h in basic media. The enhanced performance of Co3O4 nanowires/CFP can be attributed to the high conductivity of CFP, the synergistic effect of Co3O4 and carbon, and high porosity of the nanowire. This study will open new possibilities for exploring water electrocatalysis.									7	1	0	0	1	0	8			0974-3626	0973-7103		WOS:000390004100007

Herein, a simple yet effective strategy to induce molecular flattening of Co (III) meso-tetra (N-methyl-4-pyridyl) porphyrine (Co-TMPyP) by supramolecular assembly with chemically converted graphene (CCG) via synergistic electrostatic and pi-pi interactions is reported. This unique variation in molecular conformation leads to a shortened Co-N coordination bond and enhanced electron transfer from the porphyrin macrocycle to the metal ion, thereby optimizing the electronic structure of the catalytic active center in Co-TMPyP molecule. Thus, the flattened Co-TMPyP on CCG (Co-TMPyP/CCG) demonstrates remarkable electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) simultaneously as a tri-functional molecular catalyst for the first time with a high half-wave potential of 0.824 V for ORR and a low overpotential for HER (320 mV) and OER (379 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively, not only much better than the pristine Co-TMPyP but also among the best results of molecular catalysts in each aspect of ORR, OER, and HER achieved thus far. As a practical demonstration, the Co-TMPyP/CCG catalyst is used to assemble a rechargeable Zn-air battery, which shows the highest specific capacity (793 mAh g(-1)) and power density (225.4 mW cm(-2)) among all molecular catalyst-based Zn-air batteries ever reported.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000706881600001

Synthesis of the bifunctional and earth-abundant efficient catalyst systems for the same remains one of the biggest challenges to the science community. Herein, we report the electrodeposition of ternary Fe-Mo-P onto the surface of carbon cloth material to form a stable and highly active bifunctional catalyst towards electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at pH7. A set of catalysts were prepared by varying the relative atomic ratio of the elements and the best catalytic activity was observed with 60 atomic % Fe in the electroplating bath which rivals that of Pt/C in the overall electrochemical water splitting. The best catalyst also shows 24-h stability in the overall electrochemical splitting of water which indicates the potential of this class of materials.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000446982300004

Herein, a novel PtRuIr electrocatalyst has been synthesized by a pulse electrodeposition method with selectively electrodepositing Ir on PtRu nanoclusters. The prepared catalysts were characterized by electrochemical analysis, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectrometer. The experimental results show that the PtRuIr catalyst with 10 mol% of Ir exhibits significantiy higher oxygen evolution and reduction currents compared to the PtRu and the PtRuIr catalysts with other contents of Ir, which is also supported by the electrochemical impedance data. In addition, a single water electrolysis cell and a H-2/O(2)fuel cell were performed simultaneously to evaluate the oxygen evolution and reduction performances, respectively, of the novel catalyst. The optimized catalyst with 90 mol% PtRu and 10mol% Ir shows higher oxygen evolution reactivity current density and higher round-trip efficiency in the water electrolysis single cell, and in the meantime, it also exhibits higher oxygen reduction current density and higher power density in the fuel cell, compared to those of the PtRu catalyst.									31	0	0	0	0	0	31			0196-8904	1879-2227		WOS:000419414500018

In this study, we developed 3D hollow-structured NiCo2O4/C nanoparticles with interconnected pores as bifunctional electrocatalysts, which are transformed from solid NiCo2 alloy nanoparticles through the Kirkendall effect. The unique hollow structure of NiCo2O4 nanoparticles increases the number of active sites and improves contact with the electrolyte to result in excellent ORR and OER performances. In addition, the hollow-structured NiCo2O4/C nanoparticles exhibit superior long-term stability for both the ORR and OER compared to commercial Pt/C. The template- and surfactant-free synthetic strategy could be used for the low-cost and large-scale synthesis of hollow-structured materials, which would facilitate the screening of high-efficiency catalysts for energy conversion.									59	1	0	0	3	0	59			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000371222600012

Given the high catalytic activity of single-atom catalysts (SACs), preparing SACs on a large scale for ZABs is desirable but remains challenging. Herein, in situ formation of single-atom Fe-N-C catalysts on plate wood-based porous carbon is achieved via a facile Lewis acid pretreatment and carbonization process. Lewis acid FeCl3 pretreatment on the cell wall of wood not only produces abundant microchannels but also successfully introduces atomically dispersed Fe-N active species into the hierarchical structure. Such uniformly dispersive SACs on the hierarchical structure enhance the ORR/OER performance and durability. A ZAB using the catalyst in the cathode shows a high power density (70.2 mW cm(-2), at quasi solid state) and long-term stability. This work provides a new path for the large-scale preparation of high-performance SACs.									17	1	0	0	1	0	17			2380-8195			WOS:000707987500030

However, the lack of active and robust electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) severely impedes the development of this technology. In this study, a ternary layered double hydroxide (LDH) OER electrocatalyst (NiFeCo-LDH) is developed for high-performance AEM alkaline seawater electrolyzers. The AEM alkaline seawater electrolyzer catalyzed by the NiFeCoLDH shows high seawater electrolysis performance (0.84 A/cm2 at 1.7 Vcell) and high hydrogen production efficiency (77.6% at 0.5 A/cm2), thus outperforming an electrolyzer catalyzed by a benchmark IrO2 electrocatalyst. The NiFeCo-LDH electrocatalyst greatly improves the kinetics of the AEM alkaline seawater electrolyzer, consequently reducing its activation loss and leading to high performance. Based on the results, this NiFeCo-LDH-catalyzed AEM alkaline seawater electrolyzer can likely surpass the energy conversion targets of the US Department of Energy.(c) 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The evolutionary scenario of over 3.5 billion years reveals an increase in the complexity of PSI. This phenomenon of ever-increasing complexity is common to all evolutionary processes that in their advanced stages are highly dependent on fine-tuning of regulatory processes. On the other hand, the recently discovered virus-encoded PSI complexes contain a minimal number of subunits. This may reflect the unique selection scenarios associated with viral replication. It may be beneficial for future engineering of productive processes to utilize 'primitive' complexes that disregard the cellular regulatory processes and to avoid those regulatory constraints when our goal is to divert the process from its original route. In this article, we discuss the evolutionary forces that act on viral reaction centres and the role of the virus-carried photosynthetic genes in the evolution of photosynthesis.									15	0	0	0	12	0	15			0962-8436			WOS:000311288800004	23148266

The oxide is grown using a repetitive poltential multicycling technique, and the mechanism of the latter hydrous oxide formation process has been discussed. A duplex layer model of the oxide/solution interphase region is proposed. The acid/base behaviour of the hydrous oxide and the microdispersed nature of the latter material has been emphasised. The hydrous oxide is considered as a porous assembly of interlinked octahedrally coordinated anionic metal oxyhydroxide surfaquo complexes which form an open network structure. The latter contains considerable quantities of water molecules which facilitate hydroxide ion discharge at the metal site during active oxygen evolution, and also charge compensating cations. The dynamics of redox switching has been quantified via analysis of the cyclic voltammetry response as a function of potential sweep rate using the Laviron-Aoki electron hopping diffusion model by analogy with redox polymer modified electrodes. Steady state Tafel plot analysis has been used to elucidate the kinetics and mechanism of oxygen evolution. Tafel slope values of ca. 60 mVdec-1 and ca. 120 mVdec-1 are found at low and high overpotentials respectively, whereas the reaction order with respect to hydroxide ion activity changes from ca. 3/2 to ca. 1 as the potential is increased. These observations are rationalised in terms of a kinetic scheme involving Temkin adsorption and the rate determining formation of a physisorbed hydrogen peroxide intermediate on the oxide surface. The dual Tafel slope behaviour is ascribed to the potential dependence of the surface coverage of adsorbed intermediates.									17	0	0	0	2	0	18			1452-3981			WOS:000297503300048

These studies demonstrate that chiral cobalt oxide electrocatalysts reduce the reaction overpotential by 65 mV at 10 mA/cm(2), increase the oxygen yield by 1.4-fold at a fixed current density at pH 10, and decrease the production of hydrogen peroxide by 4.0-fold as compared to that of the corresponding meso-CoOx analogues. Additional studies in which the electrocatalyst is modified to make it paramagnetic exhibit a similar enhancement with an applied external magnetic field. The findings from these studies are described using a proposed mechanistic model, which unifies the favorable effects of chirality and magnetization. The results are attributed to the advantage of spin-polarized intermediates in facilitating the oxygen evolution reaction.									26	0	0	0	1	0	26			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000582576200030

Herein, we demonstrate a facile hydrothermal synthesis of highly dispersed Co3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) anchored on cattle-bone-derived nitrogen-doped hierarchically porous carbon (NHPC) networks as an efficient ORR/OER bifunctional electrocatalyst. The as prepared Co3O4/NHPC exhibits a remarkable catalytic activity toward both ORR (outperforming the commercial Pt/C) and OER (comparable with the commercial RuO2 catalyst) in alkaline electrolyte. The superior bifunctional catalytic activity can be ascribed to the large specific surface area (1070 m(2) g(-1)), the well-defined hierarchically porous structure, and the high content of nitrogen doping (4.93 wt %), which synergistically contribute to the homogeneous dispersion of Co3O4 NPs and the enhanced mass transport capability. Moreover, the primary Zn air battery using the Co3O4/NHPC cathode demonstrates a superior performance with an open-circuit potential of 1.39 V, a specific capacity of 795 mA h g(zn)(-1) (at 2 mA cm(-2)), and a peak power density of 80 mW cm(-2).

A surface-functionalized nitrogen-doped two-dimensional N-TiO2/Ti3C2Tx heterojunction (N-TiO2/Ti3C2Tx) was fabricated theoretically, with high conductivity and optimized electrocatalytic active sites. Based on the conductive substrate of Ti3C2Tx, the heterojunction remained metallic and efficiently accelerated the transfer of Li+ and electrons in the electrode. More importantly, the precise regulation of active sites in the N-TiO2/Ti3C2Tx heterojunction optimized the adsorption for LiO2 and Li2O2, facilitating the sluggish kinetics with a lowest theoretical overpotential in both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Employed as an electrocatalyst in a Li-oxygen battery (Li-O-2 battery), it demonstrated a high specific capacity of 15 298 mAh g(-1) and a superior cyclability with more than 200 cycles at 500 mA g(-1), as well as the swiftly reduced overpotential. Furthermore, combined with the in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, ex situ Raman spectra, and SEM tests, the N-TiO2/Ti3C2Tx heterojunction electrode presented a superior stability and reduced side reaction along with the high performance toward the ORR and OER.

Herein, hollow microtubes composed of RuNi1Co1 alloy nanoparticles uniformly embedded in the carbon matrix (RuNi1Co1@CMT) are prepared through a simple impregnation followed by reduction. Benefiting from the unique mosaic structure and the synergistic effect between Ru and NiCo, RuNi1Co1@CMT achieves more exposed active sites and improved reaction kinetics. As a consequence, RuNi1Co1@CMT exhibits considerable catalytic activities with the overpotentials of 78 mV for HER and 299 mV for OER at 10 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH. In addition, RuNi1Co1@CMT exhibits excellent stability for up to 30 h in both HER and OER processes at 20 mA cm-2, which is attributed to the protection of the RuNi1Co1 alloy particles by the carbon layer. Furthermore, the assembled RuNi1Co1@CMT || RuNi1Co1@CMT overall water splitting system shows a cell voltage of 1.58 V at 10 mA cm-2. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the addition of Ru can optimize the hydrogen adsorption free energy of Ni and Co sites. Finally, a solar panel-driven water splitting device is built, which can realize green and sustainable hydrogen production. The fabrication of RuNi1Co1@CMT provides a new way for the preparation of effective alloy nanomaterials for energy storage and conversion. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

In this work, bifunctional catalysts consisting of Co3O4 nanocrystals and nitrogen-doped hollow carbon nanospheres are synthesized through in situ growth of Co3O4 nanocrystals on the surface of nitrogen-doped hollow carbon nanospheres. The observed Co-N bond formation is an indication of the nucleation of Co3O4 nanocrystals starting from N-sites in nitrogen-doped hollow carbon nanospheres. The resulted hybrids exhibit improved activity towards oxygen reduction reaction compared to pristine nitrogen-doped hollow carbon nanospheres in terms of the 42 mV positive shift of half-wave potential and comparable activity towards oxygen evolution reactions with commercial RuO2 and IrO2 catalysts.

Here we developed a method to synthesize ultrathin MCoOx (M = V, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn) amorphous nanosheets (ANSs). These Co-based ANSs show high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity in alkaline solution due to the broken long-range order and the presence of abundant low bonded O on the basal plane. The stable Fe1Co1Ox ANSs also show an overpotential of ca. 240 mV of achieving 10 mA/cm(2) in OER, better than most reported transition metal-based electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2079-4991		WOS:000808602700001	35683643

The OEC is successively oxidized by the absorption of 4 quanta of light that results in the oxidation of water and the release of O-2. Ca2+ is an essential cofactor in the water-oxidation reaction, as its depletion causes the loss of the oxygen-evolution activity in PSII. In recent X-ray crystal structures, Ca2+ has been revealed to be associated with the Mn-4 cluster of PSII. Although several mechanisms have been proposed for the water-oxidation reaction of PSII, the role of Ca2+ in oxygen evolution remains unclear. In this study, we probe the role of Ca2+ in oxygen evolution by monitoring the S-1 to S-2 state transition in PSII membranes and PSII core complexes upon inhibition of oxygen evolution by Dy3+, Cu2+, and Cd2+ ions. By using a cation-exchange procedure in which Ca2+ is not removed prior to addition of the studied cations, we achieve a high degree of reversible inhibition of PSII membranes and PSII core complexes by Dy3+, Cu2+, and Cd2+ ions. EPR spectroscopy is used to quantitate the number of bound Dy3+ and Cu2+ ions per PSII center and to determine the proximity of Dy3+ to other paramagnetic centers in PSII. We observe, for the first time, the S-2 state multiline electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal in Dy3+- and Cd2+-inhibited PSII and conclude that the Ca2+ cofactor is not specifically required for the S-1 to S-2 state transition of PSII. This observation provides direct support for the proposal that Ca2+ plays a structural role in the early S-state transitions, which can be fulfilled by other cations of similar ionic radius, and that the functional role of Ca2+ to activate water in the O-O bond-forming reaction that occurs in the final step of the S state cycle can only be fulfilled by Ca2+ and Sr2+, which have similar Lewis acidities.									43	1	1	0	16	0	44			0006-2960			WOS:000244854800030	17309233	
J	He, Jing; Zhou, Xin; Xu, Ping; Sun, Jianmin								Regulating Electron Redistribution of Intermetallic Iridium Oxide by Incorporating Ru for Efficient Acidic Water Oxidation								ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS				11	48					2102883	10.1002/aenm.202102883		NOV 2021		DEC 2021	2021	Developing high-performance electrocatalysts to catalyze water splitting for the generation of sustainable hydrogen remains a challenge in proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers. However, the only applicable IrOx in PEM electrolyzers for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a multiproton-coupled process, requires a higher standard due to the weak oxygen bonding on Ir sites, which causes high overpotential and poor stability under oxidative and acidic conditions. Herein, the intermetallic Ru1Ir1Ox is synthesized through incorporation of Ru into IrOx, which exhibits a record overpotential of 204 mV (10 mA cm(geo)(-2)) and excellent stability of 110 h (100 mA cm(geo)(-2)) with a high stability number (1.13 x 10(6)) toward the acidic OER. Through fine characterizations, Ir sites with lower than +4 valence state are observed due to charge redistribution, in turn enhancing the acidic OER performance. Theoretical calculations reveal that incorporation of Ru effectively moves the Fermi level to the Ir 5d band center, thus enhancing the adsorption of oxygen intermediates and decreasing the energy barrier of the potential-determining step from 1.02 to 0.65 eV. The decreased valence states of Ir and enhanced valence state of Ru due to the charge redistribution significantly tunes the electronic structure of Ir sites, thereby drastically enhancing the OER performance.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000717027000001

However, their commercialization is challenging owing to their low charging/discharging efficiencies, short battery lives, high overpotentials, and high cathode manufacturing costs. In this study, we prepared a metal-free, N,P co-doped, porous activated carbon (N,P-PAC) electrode via KOH activation and P doping for application as a Li-O-2 battery cathode. When used in a rechargeable Li-O-2 battery, the N,P-PAC cathode showed a high specific discharge capacity (3724 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1)), an excellent cycling stability (25 cycles with a limit capacity of 1000 mA h g(-1)), and a low charge/discharge voltage gap (1.22 V at 1000 mA h g(-1)). The N,P-PAC electrode showed a low overpotential (EOER-ORR) of 1.54 V. The excellent electrochemical performance of the N,P-PAC electrode can mainly be attributed to its large active area and oxygen-containing functional groups generated via KOH activation and P-doping processes. Therefore, the N,P-PAC prepared in this study was found to be a promising eco-friendly and sustainable metal-free cathode material for Li-O-2 batteries.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8				2073-4344		WOS:000592918200001

A few-layer reduced graphene oxide-supported NiCo2O4 catalyst is prepared using a rapid and easy two-step method of synthesis. It consists of the solvothermal poyl(vinylpyrrolidone)-assisted assembly of metal complexes onto few-layer graphene followed by a calcination step aiming at converting metal complexes into the spinel phase. Using this synthesis approach, the most active material demonstrates an outstanding activity towards the OER and ORR, making it one of the best bifunctional catalysts of these reactions ever reported. This composite catalyst exhibits improved bifunctional behaviour with a low reversibility criterion of 746mV. The ORR process follows a four-electron pathway and the hydroxyl selectivity is higher than those with pure reduced graphene oxide or NiCo2O4 materials, showing the synergistic effect between the two phases. Moreover, the high activity of this composite catalyst is confirmed by comparing its performance with those obtained on other cobaltite catalysts prepared using a different synthesis method, or those obtained using a different graphene-based support.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000424761200010	29207211

The cathode has an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst and the anode comprising both a hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) catalyst and an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst with metal oxide supported iridium oxide. The method involves depositing the iridium oxide on the metal oxide support. The depositing has sputtering the iridium oxide onto the metal oxide support. USE - Method of making solid polymer electrolyte fuel cell (claimed) use in fuel cell applications through sputter deposition methods. ADVANTAGE - The high chloride content contributes to enhance degradation of the anode catalysts in the fuel cells. The reduction of chlorine content is achieved through the method leads to improved fuel cell durability and limits corrosion of the flow field plates and other downstream fuel cell components due to washout of impurity in the fluid exhausts. The elimination of the chloride-induced decomposition reduces the number of process steps and reduction of generated waste in fuel cell production. These benefits can offset the higher costs associated with use of vacuum sputter deposition.															0						DIIDW:2018042428

However, the underlying mechanism behind the catalytic activity remains controversial due to the different nature of oxygen reduction and evolutions reactions (ORR, OER) in non-aqueous cells compared to those in classic aqueous based reactions. In the present study, we reveal a detailed spectroscopic and electrochemical picture of the mechanism of catalytic activity in Na-and Li-O-2 cells. We demonstrate that ORR and OER catalytic activity in alkali metal-O-2 cells primarily originates from the stabilization of O-2(-) intermediates on the catalyst surface during the electrochemical reaction. Monitoring the electronic state of the solid state catalyst during the ORR and OER revealed a dynamic interaction occurring between the catalyst and the discharge product. The morphology and composition of discharge products is also illustrated to be influenced by solid state catalysts. The findings of the present study suggest that catalysts with a higher oxygen-bonding capability may exhibit a higher catalytic activity in alkali metal-O-2 cells.									44	2	0	0	2	0	44			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000395208000026

Tannic acid-platinum/gold nanocomposites were prepared by simple electrodeposition and self-assembly on ITO conductive glass, and the nanocomposites were subjected to various characterizations as well plasmon-enhanced electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction performance tests. The experimental results showed that the nanocomposites exhibited excellent electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction performance. This can be attributed to the promotion of charge transport by Au nanoparticles and the adsorption of H* by oxygen-containing groups in tannic acid. Meanwhile, the cross-linked network of tannic acid provided coordination sites for the binding of platinum, and the introduction of platinum exposed more electrochemically active sites. With the assistance of an external light source, the electrocatalytic performance of tannic acid-platinum/gold was further improved. The excellent enhanced electrocatalytic performance is mainly due to the hot carrier generated by the localized surface plasmon resonance effect of gold nanoparticles to the catalytic surface of platinum, which facilitated the adsorption of intermediates and the charge transfer processes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000861545000001

Herein, we report a new hydrogen evolution nanowire electrocatalyst, consisting of S-doped CoWP nanoparticles embedded in S- and N-doped carbon matrix (S-CoWP@(S,N)-C), which is in situ transformed from Hofmann-type (Co, W)-based metal-organic framework (MOF) nanowires. Because of S and N doping to the carbon matrix and the S doping to CoWP nanoparticles, the obtained S-CoWP@(S,N)-C catalyst reaches a current density of -10 mA cm(-2) at -35 and -67 mV (vs RHE) in acidic and alkaline electrolytes, respectively. Powered by a lead halide perovskite solar cell, an unassisted two-electrode solar water-splitting device using MOF-derived S-CoWP@(S,N)-C HER electrocatalysts and S-CoW@(S,N)-C OER electrocatalysts displays a solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 10.98%. Our method is highly applicable for developing robust electrocatalysts toward efficient and low-cost solar-driven water splitting.									118	7	0	0	3	0	119			2380-8195			WOS:000435159000030

The accurate determination of the intrinsic activity is essential for identifying efficient catalysts. While a huge number of studies of electrocatalysis for various applications have been reported, the effects of electrode loading on the apparent intrinsic activity obtained experimentally have been rarely dis-cussed. With a high mass loading on the electrode, not all the catalyst surfaces can be electrochemically active because not all the surfaces can be wetted by the electrolyte. The loading also affects the transport of electrons over the electrode as well as the transport of ions in the electrolyte, and thus affects the kinetics. These lead to the derivations of the apparent intrinsic activity from the real intrinsic activity. Herein, for better understanding the derivations, we evaluate and discuss the effects of electrode mass loading using oxygen evolution reaction as an example.									6	1	0	0	0	0	7			2096-9457	2667-3258		WOS:000854147200001

This design utilizes the conductivity and ultrahigh pore volume of the carbon network, boosting the catalytic activity of LDH and enhancing the catalytic durability in both half-cell measurements and RZAB assemblies. The RZAB with our MCN-LDH catalyst can discharge and recharge consistently at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for at least 5 days, tripling the life hour of RZAB with noble metal catalysts.									37	2	0	0	2	0	37			2574-0962			WOS:000462944700026

Uniform cobalt-nickel glycerate solid spheres are first synthesized as the precursor and subsequently chemically transformed into cobalt-nickel oxide/S,N-codoped carbon hollow nanospheres.

Herein, we developed an effective strategy for fabricating highly active and stable bifunctional oxygen catalysts using a highly active ORR catalyst and hybridizing it with an OER catalyst. The effects of single (S)- and multi (S and N)-doping on the ORR catalytic efficiency of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets were investigated. Cobalt hydroxide (Co(OH)(2)) nanocrystals with diameters of less than 5 nm were directly grown on SN-rGO via a simple precipitation method at room temperature to produce a bifunctional oxygen catalyst (Co(OH)(2)@SN-rGO). The Co(OH)(2)@SN-rGO bifunctional oxygen catalyst exhibited outstanding catalytic activities for both OER and ORR and showed excellent stability up to 40 h. The results demonstrated that the bifunctional oxygen electrode activities of the non-noble metal-based catalyst prepared in this study were as high as those of commercial noble metal-based oxygen electrodes.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2052-1553			WOS:000501285400009

In this work, we demonstrate for the first time a facile strategy for in situ coupling of ultrafine Co0.85Se nanocrystals and N-doped carbon (Co0.85Se@NC) by directly selenizing zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) polyhedra. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the coupling between Co0.85Se and NC, the Co-N-C structure, and the porous conductive carbon network, Co0.85Se@NC affords excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with a small overpotential, remarkable stability, and high faradaic efficiency. Furthermore, Co0.85Se@NC can also efficiently catalyze hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and we therefore investigated its applications as a trifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting and Zn-air batteries. When used as both the anode and cathode for overall water splitting, a low cell voltage of 1.76 V is sufficient to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2); the obtained Zn-air batteries exhibit a very low discharge-charge voltage gap (0.80 V at 10 mA cm(-2)) and long cycle life (up to 180 cycles). These results not only demonstrate a facile strategy for the synthesis of affordable Co0.85Se@NC but also present its huge potential as a trifunctional electrocatalyst for clean energy systems.									176	10	0	0	1	0	177			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000398889600025

We demonstrate through operando electrochemical experiments that the low HER activity of TiO2 can reversibly approach those of the state-of-the-art non-precious metal catalysts when the TiO2 is under tensile strain. At 3% tensile strain, the HER overpotential required to generate a current density of 1 mA/cm(2) shifts anodically by 260 mV to give an onset potential of 125 mV, representing a drastic reduction in the kinetic overpotential. A similar albeit smaller cathodic shift in the OER overpotential is observed when tensile strain is applied to TiO2. Results suggest that significant improvements in HER and OER activities with tensile strain are due to an increase in concentration of surface active sites and a decrease in kinetic and thermodynamics barriers along the reaction pathway(s). Our results highlight that strain applied to TiO2 by precisely controlled and incrementally increasing (i.e. dynamic) tensile stress is an effective tool for dynamically tuning the electrocatalytic properties of HER and OER electrocatalysts relative to their activities under static conditions.									19	1	0	0	1	0	19			2045-2322			WOS:000493898100014	31685891

We found suitable conditions for the particles to adhere sufficiently stably for detailed electrochemical characterization of a single particle. The special electrode design opens the possibility to dose gaseous oxygen to the nanoparticle under study. Deactivation of the catalytic activity of the AgNP upon excessive exposure to oxygen as well as the recovery of catalytic activity under reducing conditions is presumably attributed to hydrogen evolution at the applied low potentials. The proposed approach allows mechanistic parameters for the ORR to be extracted at a single AgNP in highly alkaline media in the absence of any binder materials and under exclusion of averaging ensemble effects.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			2196-0216			WOS:000438339200018

Herein, a series of hierarchical core-shell hybrid nanostructured bifunctional electrocatalysts have been successfully synthesized by electrodepositing amorphous nickel oxide nanoflakes (A-NiOx) on the surface of crystalline Mn-doped Ni2P nanosheet arrays (Mn-5-Ni2P). Benefitting from the synergistic effect generated from the outer amorphous NiOx and inner highly crystalline Mn-5-Ni2P nanosheets, the optimal A-NiOx-20/Mn-5-Ni2P sample exhibits quite low overpotentials for the HER (55 mV) and OER (255 mV) to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline electrolyte. Moreover, the two-electrode water electrolysis device only requires a small cell voltage of 1.54 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) and shows no obvious attenuation for 20 hours. Our work will provide a valuable method to design and synthesize efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting and other applications of energy conversion and storage.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2398-4902			WOS:000492020200017

Stability of the electrode as dimensionally stable anode in impressed current cathodic protection systems was investigated in a mixture of 1 mol L-1 sodium sulfate and 1 mol L-1 sulfuric acid at 30 degrees C under 1.5 A cm(-2) constant current density. For this purpose, the potential of work electrode (anode) was recorded against time during the stability test. The changes in electrochemical properties of the electrode were fallowed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry at different times of stability test. In addition, Tafel polarization test was done at the beginning of stability test in order to studying the mechanism of oxygen evolution reaction at the surface of the electrode. Morphological analysis was done by means of field emission scanning electron microscope and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer. The results indicated that the durability of the electrode at concentrated acidic sulfate medium is about 88 hours and the oxygen evolution reaction proceeds through the redox exchanging of different iridium oxide species.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2070-2051	2070-206X		WOS:000439954100022

The best sample exhibits an ECSA of 8.6 cm(2). With the increase of ECSA both OER activity and the supercapacitive performance of the composites increases. The MC composite exhibits a low over potential (0.385 V) for OER activity. The composite displays outstanding catalytic activity for OER in the alkali medium as well as exhibits excellent supercapacitive activity (specific capacitance of 1039 F g(-1) at a scan rate of 2 mV s(-1)). An asymmetric supercapacitor has also been developed which shows very high specific capacitance within a wide working potential of 1.8 V. This device can supply an energy and power density of 60.55 Wh kg(-1) and 8.45 kW kg(-1), respectively.

However, the existing electrocatalysts still suffer from low catalytic efficiency, and need a large overpotential to drive the overall water-splitting reactions. Herein, we report an iridium-tungsten alloy with nanodendritic structure (IrW ND) as a new class of high-performance and pH-universal bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution catalysis. The IrW ND catalyst presents a hydrogen generation rate similar to 2 times higher than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst in both acid and alkaline media, which is among the most active hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts yet reported. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the high HER intrinsic catalytic activity results from the suitable hydrogen and hydroxyl binding energies, which can accelerate the rate-determining step of the HER in acid and alkaline media. Moreover, the IrW NDs show superb oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and much improved stability over Ir. The theoretical calculation demonstrates that alloying Ir metal with W can stabilize the formed active iridium oxide during the OER process and lower the binding energy of reaction intermediates, thus improving the Ir corrosion resistance and OER kinetics. Furthermore, the overall water-splitting devices driven by IrW NDs can work in a wide pH range and achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in acid electrolyte at a low potential of 1.48 V.									130	6	0	0	5	0	130			2374-7943	2374-7951		WOS:000445724800025	30276259

In this review, we discuss recent progress in promoting electrocatalysis for renewable energy technologies based on surface or interface engineering with special emphasis on the geometric structures. We first introduce the state-of-the-art engineering methods for achieving the desired surface or interface and correlate these structures with their catalytic performances. Then, we describe classic examples of rational surfaces and interfaces for tuning metallic nanomaterials for several key catalytic reactions in renewable energy technologies, including the hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions, oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, methanol oxidation reaction, and electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction.

Herein, a CuCoSe@NC nanocomposite with copper-cobalt selenides embedded in highly graphitized N-doped porous carbon was synthesized by an in situ encapsulation strategy with metal-organic framework crystals (CuCo-BDC) as templates followed by selenization, and used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for Zn-air batteries in lye. The result shows that the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activity of the optimal CuCoSe@NC-2 was enhanced, and the assembled Zn-air batteries exhibited a remarkable electrochemical performance with the use of the CuCoSe@NC-2 electrode, including a high power density (137.1 mW cm(-2)) and excellent charge-discharge cycling stability, which were better than those of the Pt/C + RuO2 electrocatalyst. Such improvement is attributed not only to the higher porosity and larger specific surface area (342 m(2) g(-1)) of the carbon matrix, which increased the contact area with oxygen-containing species, but also the encapsulation effect of the highly graphitized N-doped carbon layer and the high content of pyridine-N species also further improved the conductivity of selenide composites.

Several transition metal containing perovskites were recently explored for the development of superior OER catalysts, and their activity was correlated with the applied potentials at a specific current density to e(g) electron density present in the materials. The rock salt structure is envisaged here as a model host structure similar to perovskite to tune the e(g) electrons to obtain superior electro-catalytic activity. Incorporation of Ni into CoO lattices helps to stabilize the rock salt structure and modulate the e(g) electrons to develop superior OER and ORR electrocatalysts. Nickel doped rock salt structured CoO, NixCo1-xO (0 <= x <= 0.5), were synthesized by employing a solid state metathesis synthesis route. The compounds were characterised by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), TGA, FT-IR and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). Ni0.3Co0.7O with 1.3 e(g) electrons showed superior electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction. The overpotential for the Ni0.3Co0.7O sample was also found to be similar to 0.450 V for 1 M and about similar to 0.389 V at 5 M concentration of the KOH electrolyte.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2046-2069		WOS:000534282700055	35515582

To address this issue, a novel self-standing and bifunctional electrocatalyst, consisting of Co-doped MoS2 nanosheets anchored on carbon fiber paper, has been prepared via hydrothermal method. Taking advantage of conductive substrate of carbon fiber paper, sufficient-exposed active edges of MoS2 sheets, and metallic character caused by Co-doping, our electrode exhibits high-efficient bifunctional activities for the overall water splitting in alkaline electrolyte (1 M KOH), which can produce a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 197 mV for HER and 235 mV for OER.

Developing effective electrocatalysts for water splitting is central to the area of renewable energy. Herein, we performed density functional calculations to predict the electrocatalytic performance of a Ni2P surface and Ni2P/Cr2CO2 (MXene) interface as bifunctional electrocatalysts and clarified the mechanisms of the improvement of the electrocatalytic activity of the Ni2P/Cr2CO2 interface. The optimal overpotential of the Ni2P surface for the oxygen evolution reaction is 0.95 V, and the ideal overpotential of the Ni2P/Cr2CO2 interface for the oxygen evolution reaction is 0.80 V. The Gibbs free energy for the adsorption of atomic hydrogen (G(H*)) on the Ni2P/Cr2CO2 interface can reach -0.09 eV at a suitable hydrogen coverage. The HER processes of both Cr2CO2 and the Ni2P/Cr2CO2 interface follow the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism with the activation energy barriers (E-a) of 0.76 eV and 0.68 eV, respectively. The Ni2P/Cr2CO2 interface promotes charge transfer from the Ni atom to O atom, which weakens the interaction between Ni and intermediates and therefore improves the catalytic effect of Ni2P for either the HER or OER. The present results indicate that the hierarchical Ni2P/Cr2CTx composite could be an effective medium for achieving a promising bifunctional electrocatalysis for water splitting.									29	1	0	0	1	0	29			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000465152700065

Repeatable hydrogen adsorption/desorption surface area measurements along with oxygen evolution kinetics for carbon supported pure platinum catalysts (Pt/C) illustrate practical reproducibility (+/-10%) across the 16 glassy carbon working electrodes. Automated liquid-precursor impregnation using robotic liquid dispensing is shown to produce catalysts in precisely controllable atomic ratios as confirmed via energy dispersive spectroscopy. The combinatorial array demonstrates the ability to produce reliable trends in electrocatalytic activity data for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on both binary Pt-M catalysts (with M=Ir, Re, Ru, Pd), as well as tertiary Pt-Ru-M catalysts (with M=Ir, Pd)), when compared to a more rigorous kinetic analysis on a rotating disk electrode. It was shown that Ru-rich materials are better suited for use as OER catalysts relative to Pt-, Ir-, Pd-, and Re-rich materials. The OER catalyst materials discovered are expected to significantly lower the necessary input power of electrochemical water splitting devices in acidic environments (proton exchange membrane fuel cell electrolyzers).

In this study, we demonstrate the physical and electrochemical properties of BaFe12-xCoxO19 (x = 0-12), a solid solution of magnetoplumbite-structured BaFe12O19 and BaCo12O19. Single-phase samples in the whole composition range are successfully obtained by using high-pressure and high-temperature conditions of 6.5 GPa and 1373 K. Co- and Fe-doping into BaFe12O19 and BaCo12O19, respectively, efficiently increases the catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The OER activity of BaFe12-xCoxO19 is maximized at two compositions of x = 5 and 10, whereas the nonsystematic change in the OER activity for the intermediate compositions between x = 5 and 10 indicates a competition of positive and negative factors on the OER activity such as the dopant as an active site, electrical conductivity, spin polarization, and charge-transfer resistance. We eventually found a characteristic relationship between specific activity and charge-transfer resistance reflecting the mechanistic difference for BaFe12-xCoxO19.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000822501800001

An effective method is to prepare ideal catalysts by integrating different components, which can increase the number of active sites and generate the synergistic effect among different components. Based on this idea, the NiFe LDH (NiFe Layered Double Hydroxide) nanosheets are anchored on ZnCo2O4 nanowires to form a core-shell structure ZnCo2O4@NiFe LDH. Thanks to the synergistic effect between ZnCo2O4 and NiFe LDH, the ZnCo2O4@NiFe LDH shows excellent catalytic performance for OER. It only needs a low overpotential of 249 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm-2 with a low Tafel slope of 96.7 mV dec(-1). Furthermore, after 20 h of stability test, the catalytic performance of the ZnCo2O4@NiFe LDH shows no obvious attenuation. Therefore, this work provides a promising strategy for the future development of OER systems. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, cobalt/iron(oxides) heterostructures with interface engineering for regulating surface structure properties toward enhanced OER and benzyl alcohol oxidation (BAO) are demonstrated. Interface engineering triggers generation of local crystallinity and defective oxygen, enabling the material to export 50 mA cm(-2) for OER at an overpotential of 329 mV and continuous 20 h of operation without apparent decay. Further, BAO is also boosted on the heterostructures, further propelling water splitting to export 10 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of only 1.42 V. Theoretical calculation reveals that the defective sites dominated by interfaces facilitate adsorption/dissociation of intermediates during electrocatalysis. The findings in this work place Fe/Co(oxides) heterostructures as an excellent bifunctional OER/BAO catalyst and also provide a promising interface-regulated electrocatalysis strategy for development of other advanced heterostructures toward various applications.									55	4	0	0	2	0	57			2380-8195			WOS:000441852800011

Owing to the sluggish reaction kinetics for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), it is urgent to explore efficient and inexpensive OER electrocatalytic materials. Herein, a highly efficient three-dimensional (3D) hybrid of anions (Cl- and CO32- ) doped cobalt hydroxide catalyst coupled with nitrogendoped carbon dots (Co(OH)2@NCDs) is reported via a simple in situ hydrothermal method. Interestingly, the additional mass ratio of NCDs in Co(OH)2 hybrid has strong influence on the morphology of as-prepared composites. The well-defined urchin-like Co(OH)2@NCDs composite exhibits superior OER performance, achieving the low overpotential (eta) of 296 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and high durability in 1 M KOH solution. The urchin-like Co (OH)2@NCDs catalyst could achieve 29-fold electrochemical active surface area than that of the pure Co(OH)2. Additionally, after coupling with NCDs, analysis result shows new Co-N charge transfer channel is generated in hybrid and an optimized electronic environment is originated from the strong electronic interaction among Co atom and NCDs, which can provide efficient charge channels for the rapid electron transfer and further improve the intrinsic activity and promote the OER kinetics. The work may endow a new strategy for the construction of excellent transition metal-based hydroxide water oxidation electrocatalysts.									19	1	0	0	2	0	19			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000664791400001

Herein, oxygen-incorporated nickel-cobalt phosphide/nitrogen-doped carbon (denoted as NiCoPO/NC) nanosheets were controllably synthesized by utilizing zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) as the precursor. This precursor can generate Ni-Co layered double hydroxide/2-methylimidazole (Ni-Co LDH/MeIM) after chemical etching. A subsequent phosphorization process leads to the formation of NiCoPO/NC nanosheets, which possess both nitrogen-doped carbon and incorporated P/O elements in the hybrid structure. As expected, due to the resulting structural and compositional characteristics, the NiCoPO/NC nanosheets exhibit superior electrocatalytic activity with an overpotential of 300 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent long-term stability, comparable to commercial RuO2 and NiCoPO/NC nanocages. The facile and controllable synthetic method paves the way for synthesis of other two-dimensional nanomaterials for energy and environment-related applications.									100	8	0	0	2	0	101			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000513814400060

Herein, narrow bandgap Sr2CoWO6 double perovskites with a light absorption edge of >= 700 nm are synthesized by a solid-state reaction method varying the precursor ratios. The sample synthesized with a precursor Co/W ratio of 1:4 has a conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) located at -0.82 and 0.95 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) at pH = 7, respectively. As a result, both the photocatalytic OER and HER are observed even without loading any cocatalysts. After loading Pt and Rh cocatalysts, the average photocatalytic OER and HER rates are 188 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) (apparent quantum efficiency of 3% at approximate to 420 nm) and 30 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), respectively. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the OER active sites may shift from a high overpotential W-site to a low overpotential Co-site when the W content is increased, which renders high photocatalytic activity for W-rich samples. Therefore, W-rich Sr2CoWO6 double perovskite is identified as a novel narrow bandgap bifunctional semiconductor photocatalyst for photocatalytic OER and HER, which is rare for oxide semiconductor photocatalysts. This work opens up a new avenue for the development of oxide-based double perovskite semiconductor photocatalysts for photocatalytic water splitting.									26	2	0	0	1	0	26			2367-198X			WOS:000500748200002

This disadvantage can be solved by the development of hierarchically structured three-dimensional (3D) carbon. Through carbonization method, we synthesize the bifunctional catalysts, Fe, P, N, and S multidoped porous graphene (FePNS-G) for use in rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZABs). FePNS-G-2 indicates superior active site density for both the OER and ORR. Moreover, the FePNS-G-2 exhibits excellent long-term electrochemical stability for 10 h in both the OER and ORR. ZABs assembled for FePNS-G-2 shows a higher power density (168.3 mW cm(-2)) and a higher specific capacity (782.36 mA h g(-1)) than benchmark Pt/C + IrO2 electrocatalyst. The sturdy durability of FePNS-G-2 for OER and ORR leads to the charge-discharge cycle durability. The excellent electrocatalytic activity and steady cycling life of FePNS-G-2 examines the air cathode as an electrocatalyst in feasible ZAB applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000836356100002

In contrast, several non-noble metals based electro-catalysts have been identified for alkaline and neutral medium water electrolysis and fuel cells. Herein we report for the very first time, F doped Cu1.5Mn1.5O4, identified by exploiting theoretical first principles calculations for ORR and OER in PEM based systems. The identified novel noble metal-free electro-catalyst showed similar onset potential (1.43 V for OER and 1 V for ORR vs RHE) to that of IrO2 and Pt/C, respectively. The system also displayed excellent electrochemical activity comparable to IrO2 for OER and Pt/C for ORR, respectively, along with remarkable long term stability for 6000 cycles in acidic media validating theory, while also displaying superior methanol tolerance and yielding recommended power densities in full cell configurations.									86	3	0	0	2	0	88			2045-2322			WOS:000379131800001	27380719

In this work we investigate the galvanic replacement of electrochemically synthesised iron nanocubes on glassy carbon, with gold and palladium. The resultant nanomaterials demonstrate quite a difference in morphology; the original cuboid like template is maintained in the case of gold but destroyed when palladium is used.

These CoFeP nanoparticles are rich in active sites of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at surfaces and provide metallic conductivity in their bulk phases. The N, P dual-doped carbon matrix provided abundant active sites of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and formed a conductive network substrate. The ideal composite structure endowed CoFeP@C with highly efficient bifunctional performance for catalyzing both OER and ORR, accordingly making CoFeP@C an ideal catalyst for rechargeable Zn-air batteries. The liquid Zn-air battery of CoFeP@C has achieved a large power density of 143.5 mW/cm(2) and can be charged and discharged stably for 200 h (1200 cycles). The solid-state Zn-air battery of CoFeP@C has achieved a power density of 72.6 mW/cm(2) and can stably run for 20 h.

Highly active and low cost electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are of great importance for future renewable energy conversion and storage. Herein, NiFe-based layered double hydroxides with laminar structure (NFLS) were successfully fabricated via a one-step hydrothermal approach by using sodium dodecyl sulfate as surfactant. The as-fabricated NFLS showed a well-defined periodic layered-stacking geometry with a scale down to 1-nm. Benefitting from the unique structure, NFLS exhibited an excellent catalytic activity towards OER with current densities of 10 mAcm(-2) at overpotential of 197 mV. The synergistic effect of Ni and Fe plays a key role in electrode reactions.

However, the intrinsic reaction mechanism of the Ni/Fe-based compounds still remains unclear and under debate. Herein a Ni/Fe-based heterometallic compound Fe0.5Ni0.5Pc-CP has been prepared by a flexible method through coupling of Ni[Pc(ethynyl)(4)] and Fe[Pc(I)(4)]. The as-prepared Fe0.5Ni0.5Pc-CP exhibits an excellent performance toward the OER with the overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) as low as 317 mV, superior to those of FePc-CP (570 mV) and NiPc-CP (440 mV) and even comparable to that of commercial RuO2 (320 mV). Importantly, both the experimental and theoretical methods demonstrate that the improved OER performance of Fe0.5Ni0.5Pc-CP relative to the homometallic analogues can be attributed to the electronic interactions between the adjacent Fe and Ni atoms in Fe0.5Ni0.5Pc-CP, which facilitate the generation of the high-valence Fe/Ni species in Fe0.5Ni0.5Pc-CP and in turn boost the OER. The present result helps gain insight into the reaction mechanism of Ni/Fe-based OER electrocatalysts and further develop OER electrocatalysts with promising performance.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			2052-1553			WOS:000511447700008

The obtained nanocomposite was characterized by X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) methods to get information about the structure, composition and morphology. After physicochemical characterization of the prepared sample, it was applied as an electro catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

In this study, a catalytic material with controlled nanoscale domains of Pt and Ni is formed by a self-assembly process at room temperature. The final structure of the catalyst is achieved through two-stage transformation, first is the formation of Pt-Ni nanoscale domains and then inducing Ni to higher oxidation states. The material has a nanowire-like morphology at the macroscale, which ensures rapid kinetics and mass transfer. The results prove that the nanoscale domains of Pt, Ni, and Ni2+ and Ni3+ with close interfacing are crucial for the performance of the electrocatalyst and ensure the presence of Ni in a high oxidation state, leading to both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The catalyst has a low overpotential and ultralow Tafel slope for both HER and OER, 13.7 and 32 mV dec(-1), respectively, crucial for high power applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000689697400001

Herein, we develop a reactive template route to fabricate a high-efficiency oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/ oxygen evolution reaction (OER)/hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) trifunctional electrocatalyst (CoFe/N-H-C NS) via pyrolyzing the mixture containing CoFe-layered double hydroxide@glucosaminoglycan (CoFe-LDH@p-Glu) and urea/dicyandiamide. In this strategy, the CoFe-LDH not only provides a well-defined two-dimensional template to form carbon NSs but also employs a well-distributed CoFe precursor to form uniform CoFe nanoparticles (NPs). Such a synthetic strategy has been demonstrated effective to controllably fabricate the special nanostructure with metal NPs embedded in N-doped carbon NSs and favorable exposure of active sites, leading to a strong synergistic effect between CoFe and N-doped carbon NSs and abundant electrocatalytic active sites for energy electrocatalysis. CoFe/N-H-C NS exhibits superior ORR performances to Pt/C with more positive half-wave potential (844 mV for CoFe/N-H-C NS vs 832 mV for Pt/C), longer stability, and better methanol tolerance in alkaline conditions. Furthermore, CoFe/N-H-C NS displays an identical current density to commercial RuO2 at 1.8 V (vs RHE) toward OER and a remarkable electrocatalytic property toward HER in alkaline conditions.

Ir centers are connected to each other via mu-O type oxygen linkages that allow for the Ir centers to electronically couple to each other. The most intense peaks in Raman spectra were characterized by stretching movement of Ir-mu-O bonds in the basal plane of the octahedra coupled to OH bending movements of hydroxyl groups bound to the Ir centers. Oxidation of Ir3+ to Ir4+ at 0.7-1.2 V within a mu-linked polymeric geometry results in a blue coloration of the material at high potentials. Theoretical calculations indicate that the optical transition responsible for the color is essentially an Ir to Ir charge transfer transition. The active compound that carries out oxygen evolution is resistant to further structure-directing influence of oxidation. In the course of oxidation, it was observed that IrO2 with a rutile structure could form at potentials greater than 1.2 V as a side product of the reaction.									55	0	0	0	1	0	55			2155-5435			WOS:000389399400010

Herein, an electrospinning-pyrolysispartial selenization strategy is proposed to construct the heterostructure nanoparticles of CoSe2-CoO, which are encapsulated into N-doped carbon fibers (CoSe2-CoO/NCF). The assembled CoSe2-CoO/NCF hybrid enables to integrate and optimize the multicomponent features from different components through electronic coupling effects. The heterojunction between CoO and CoSe2 owns abundant nanointerface, which could induce the electron rearrangement to enhance the charge transfer ability and optimize the adsorption towards reaction intermediates. As a result, CoSe2-CoO/NCF presents superior cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities with low overpotentials, small Tafel slopes and robust durability. Impressively, the overpotentials to afford 10 mA cm(-2) current density for acidic HER, alkaline HER and OER upon CoSe2-CoO/NCF are 72, 117 and 279 mV, respectively, much lower than those counterparts. Further, the full water splitting device with CoSe2-CoO/NCF as both cathode and anode requires a low voltage of 1.604 V to attain 10 mA cm(-2) The current work proposes a new insight for interface engineering to improve the electrocatalytic performance of transition metal-based materials.

Herein, petal-like NiCoP sheets were synthesized on carbon paper covered with a 3D nitrogen-doped car-bon nanofiber network (NiCoP/CNNCP) by a simple hydrothermal process followed by phosphorization. The HER overpotential in 0.5 M H2SO4 and OER overpotential in 1 M KOH of the NiCoP/CNNCP electrode only required 55 mV and 260 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2, respectively, which was comparable or even better than most nickel-and cobalt-based phosphide catalysts. The overall water-splitting electrolyzer with an asym-metric electrolyte system assembled using NiCoP/CNNCP as bifunctional electrodes required an extremely low cell voltage of 1.04 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2, which was much lower than almost all alkaline electrolysis systems.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

In this paper, we explored a fluid model to investigate the production and destruction of ROS in atmospheric radio-frequency (RF) discharges with helium-oxygen mixture as working gas; to speed up the computation, only 17 species and 48 reactions are considered in plasmas. At a given applied voltage, the variations of ROS depending on the oxygen admixture are discussed and the key reactions related to the generation of ROS are further confirmed. Through increasing the applied voltage, the evolution of ROS based on the simulation results are also given.

Using an existing cell with a commercial and iridium-based catalyst coated membrane, it was possible to fully reduce V3.5+ and V3+ solutions to V2+ with the formation of oxygen and with coulomb efficiencies of over 96%. The cell achieved a maximum current density of 75 mA/cm(2) during this process and was limited by the proximity of the V(III) reduction to the hydrogen evolution reaction. Due to the specific reaction mechanisms of V(IV) and V(III) ions, V(III) solutions were reduced with an energy efficiency of 61%, making this process nearly twice as energy efficient as the reduction of V(IV) to V(III). Polarisation curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used to further investigate the losses of half-cell reactions and to find ways of further increasing efficiency and performance levels.

The synergistic effect between transition metal heteroatoms and rational interface structural design can effectively enhance the electrocatalytic capability. Herein, utilizing the ZIFs as precursor, we fabricate a simple nickel-decorated three-dimensional Fe-/N- co-doped carbon continuously coated on porous cobalt oxide nanowires array. The partially immersion of carbon into porous CoO can form interlocked interface to enhance the structural stability. The vertically aligned N-doped carbon can facilitate the OH adsorption, while the Ni-/Fe-/N- co-doped carbon on porous CoO can increase the active sites and enhance the intrinsic electrocatalytic capability. Therefore, the optimal electrode exhibits a low OER onset overpotential of 247.1 mV, low Tafel slope of 38.8 mV dec(-1) and robust durability during 60 h test under alkaline condition. This work provides a new feasible strategy for rational structural design of advanced non-precious metal electrocatalysts. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

However, this process can be facilitated by manipulating the composition and morphology of the electrocatalyst. Here, by tuning the annealing temperature, a series of cobalt borides (CoB@300, CoB@450, CoB@550 and CoB@650) were synthesized from a metal-organic framework Prussian blue analogue (PBA) following boronization. The resulting borides were characterized systematically and we explored their electrocatalytic activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In an alkaline electrolyte, the in situ surface transformation of the boride working electrode to the corresponding metaborite and cobalt oxyhydroxide took place which thereafter acted as the active catalytic sites for the OER. Interestingly, the amorphous form of cobalt boride (i.e., CoB@300) shows many fold increased catalytic activity compared to those of crystalline CoB and commercial RuO2 requiring only 290 mV overpotential to reach the benchmarked 10 mA cm(-2) current density and the trend follows the order as CoB@300 > CoB@450 > CoB@550 > CoB@650 > PBA. The dominant catalytic activity of the amorphous cobalt boride nanostructure is attributed particularly to its amorphous nature and synergy between the in situ formed catalytically active centres (meta-borites and cobalt oxyhydroxide).									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000747401000001	35084405

We report porous Co3O4 nanoplates with the average size and thickness of similar to 100 and similar to 20 nm, respectively, and a surface area of 98.65 m(2) g(-1). The mesoporous nano structure shortens the lengths for ion/electron transport and provides abundant reaction sites. In the alkaline solution, the Co3O4 nanoplates exhibit a comparable limiting current density to that of Pt/C in the ORR and a superior activity in the OER. Redox reactions corresponding to the oxidation reduction of cobalt species with a high pseudocapacitance and stability are observed, indicating the multifunctional properties. Using Co3O4 nanoplates in the air electrode, the Zn-air battery delivers a maximum power density of 59.7 mW cm(-2). At a current density of 1 mA cm(-2), a gravimetric energy density of 901.6 Wh kg(Zn)(-1) and an energy efficiency of 67.3% are achieved. Moreover, the voltage gaps between discharge and charge as well as the energy efficiency of 58% at 10 mA cm(-2) are maintained for 100 cycles. The porous Co3O4 nanoplate is a promising active material for efficient Zn-air batteries with excellent cycling stability and high energy density. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The [DEME][TFSI]-LiTFSI solution is studied in terms of ionic conductivity, viscosity, electrochemical stability, and compatibility with lithium metal at 30 degrees C, 40 degrees C, and 60 degrees C. The electrolyte shows suitable properties for application in Li-O-2 battery, allowing a reversible, low-polarization discharge-charge performance with a capacity of about 13Ahg in the positive electrode and coulombic efficiency approaching 100%. The reversibility of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is demonstrated by exsitu XRD and SEM studies. Furthermore, the study of the cycling behavior of the Li-O-2 cell using the [DEME][TFSI]-LiTFSI electrolyte at increasing temperatures (from 30 to 60 degrees C) evidences enhanced energy efficiency together with morphology changes of the deposited species at the working electrode.

The well-known cobalt-based metal organic zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-67) are used not only as the morphological template but also as the cobalt precursor. During the two-step temperature-raising hydrothermal process, ZIF-67 polyhedrons are first transformed to hollow cobalt sulfide polyhedrons by sulfidation, and then molybdenum disulfide nanosheets further grow and deposit on the surface of hollow cobalt sulfide polyhedrons at the increased temperature. The crystalline hollow Co3S4@MoS2 heterostructures are finally obtained after subsequent thermal annealing under a N-2 atmosphere. Due to the synergistic effects between the hydrogen evolution reaction active catalyst of MoS2 and the oxygen evolution reaction active catalyst of Co3S4, the obtained hollow Co3S4@MoS2 heterostructures exhibit outstanding bifunctional catalytic performances toward both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions in acidic and alkaline media.									395	17	0	0	16	0	399			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000405535700016

The reaction pathway is considered to be involving two steps, including a H2O2 molecule dissociated on the metal single site to form the (metal(1)-N-x)=O active site, and followed by the dissociation of another H2O2 on the other side of metal atom to form O=(metal(1)-N-x)=O intermediate center, which is active for the adsorption of benzene molecule via the formation of a C-O bond to form phenol. In this manuscript, we report a Cu SAC with nitrogen and oxygen dual-coordination (Cu-1-N3O1 moiety) that doesn't need the first H2O2 activation process, as verified by both experimental and density function theory (DFT) calculations results. Compared with the counterpart nitrogen-coordinated Cu SAC (denoted as Cu-1/NC), Cu SAC with nitrogen and oxygen dual-coordination (denoted as Cu-1/NOC) exhibits 2.5 times higher turnover frequency (TOF) and 1.6 times higher utilization efficiency of H2O2. Particularly, the coordination number (CN) of Cu atom in Cu-1/NOC maintains four even after H2O2 treatment and reaction. Combining DFT calculations, the dynamic evolution of single atomic Cu with nitrogen and oxygen dual-coordination in hydroxylation of benzene is proposed. These findings provide an efficient route to improve the catalytic performance through regulating the coordination environments of SACs and demonstrate a new reaction mechanism in hydroxylation of benzene to phenol reaction.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000712941900004

Metal-based electrocatalysts are widely used in the above fields. However, metal-based electrocatalysts have many disadvantages, including resource scarcity, low durability, and damaging environmental effects. To address this dilemma, we investigated a simple pyrolysis mode to synthesize a nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and oxygen (O) -doped (i.e., tridoped) defect-rich porous carbon-based electrocatalyst, named as GNP-900, for HER, OER, and ORR by heating the assembled hybrid super molecule of graphene oxide (GO), phytic acid (PA), and polyethyleneimine (PEI) at 900 degrees C. The developed GNP-900 shows high electrocatalytic activities for HER and OER with low Tafel slopes of 93 mV dec(-1) and 127 mV dec(-1) and small overpotentials of 179 mV and 299 mV, respectively, to achieve the current density of (j) +/- 10 mA cm(-2). For ORR, the GNP-900 offers a very small loop current density and presents good CH3OH tolerance. In addition, features with a positive onset potential of 0.96 V and half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.824 V, strongly suggesting the high electrocatalytic performance. The excellent electrocatalytic performance of the porous GNP-900 is mainly ascribed to the tridoped heteroatoms and the abundant defect sites on the substrate.									22	1	0	0	1	0	22			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000618286300001

Carbon materials have been widely employed in LOB for its light weight and facile availability. In particular, graphene is a suitable candidate due to its unique two-dimensional structure, high conductivities, large specific surface areas, and good stability at high charge potential. However, the intrinsic catalytic activity of graphene is insufficient for the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in LOB. Therefore, various surface functionalization schemes for graphene have been developed to tailor the surface chemistry of graphene. In this review, the properties and performances of functionalized graphene cathodes are discussed from theoretical and experimental aspects, including heteroatomic doping, oxygen functional group modifications, and catalyst decoration. Heteroatomic doping breaks electric neutrality of sp(2) carbon of graphene, which forms electron-deficient or electron-rich sites. Oxygen functional groups mainly create defective edges on graphene oxides with C-O, C=O, and -COO-. Catalyst decoration is widely attempted by various transition and precious metal and metal oxides. These induced reactive sites usually improve the ORR and/or OER in LOB by manipulating the adsorption energies of O-2, LiO2, Li2O2, and promoting electron transportation of cathode. In addition, functionalized graphene is used in anode and separators to prevent shuttle effect of redox mediators and suppress growth of Li dendrite.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000606020900001	33291089

In this work, Pd nanocrystals (Pd-NCs) modified ultrathin NiO nanoplates (NiO-uNPs) hybrids (Pd-NCs/NiO-uNPs) are successfully synthesized using successive cyanogel hydrolysis, chemical reduction, and calcination treatment methods. Various electrochemical measurements and physicochemical characterization results demonstrate that Pd-NCs/NiO-uNPs hybrids have excellent electrocatalytic performance for both GEOR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline medium, which benefit from the large specific surface area, uniform distribution of Pd-NCs, and the modified electronic structure of Ni atoms. At Pd-NCs/NiO-uNPs hybrids, only 1.43 V is needed to obtain the current density of 100 mA.cm(-2) for GEOR, much lower than that for oxygen evolution reaction (1.82 V). In addition, Pd-NCs/NiO-uNPs hybrids exhibit better HER performance than commercial Pd/C electrocatalyst. As a result, the constructed Pd-NCs/NiO-uNPs parallel to Pd-NCs/NiO-uNPs glycerol electrolyzer only requires 1.62 V electrolysis voltage to reach 10 mA.cm(-2) current density, showing an energy-efficient and economy-competitive synthesis for the coproduction of glyceraldehyde and hydrogen.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000701372600002

NiFe2O4-Ni3S2 nanosheets (NSs) were also prepared by direct hydrothermal sulfuration of the NiFe alloy for comparison. Compared to the dense NS structure of the NiFe2O4-Ni3S2 NSs/NF, the NiFe2O4-Ni3S2 NRs/NF showed better oxygen evolution performance due to its unique weed-like NR array structure composed of additional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) active sites, with a strong electron interaction for Ni and Fe and the active sulfide synergistic effect with oxides. Therefore, Driving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) only requires an overpotential of 189 mV and the catalyst could provide 100 mA cm(-2) continuously and be constant for more than 80 h in 1.0 M KOH. This experiment indicated that Fe3+ immersion had an indirect regulating effect on the morphological growth of the catalyst, which provided a novel concept for designing better OER catalysts.

Transition metal sulfides have attracted extensive interest owing to their easily adjustable electronic structures and rich chemical properties. Herein, the growth of MoS2-Ni(3)S(2)on a nickel foam (MoS2-Ni3S2/NF) surface is investigated in the presence of urea, which can tune the morphology, surface electronic state and surface hydroxyl content of the product. The MoS2-Ni3S2/NF with optimal urea content shows remarkable electrocatalytic activity to hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions with the corresponding overpotential at 100 mA cm(-2)of only 181 mV and 355 mV, respectively.

Herein, the cobalt nanoparticles encapsulated in iron and nitrogen co-doped urchin-like porous carbons (Co@Fe-Nx/C) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for ORR and OER is fabricated via a facile pyrolysis treatment. The Co@Fe-Nx/C catalyst displays a typical urchin-like morphology anchored with numerous CNTs and many monodispersed cobalt nanoparticles are encapsulated in the carbon matrices, which not only enable effective and fast electron transfer, but also can prevent Co nanoparticles from surface oxidation and agglomeration-induced activity degradation, thus improving the electrocatalytic activities and durability. The Co@Fe-Nx/C catalyst exhibits a superb ORR/OER catalytic activities with a low reversible oxygen potential gap (0.67 V), surpassing the commercial Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts (0.69 V). Liquid r-ZAB constructed with Co@Fe-Nx/C as the air cathode manifest outstanding energy density (802 mAh g(-1)), superb charge/discharge performance and excellent reversibility and durability compared to the precious metal couple catalysts. The remarkable bifunctional catalytic activities are due to the synergistic effect of Co nanoparticles and Fe-Nx/C substrates.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000819824700003

In this study, the kinetics of the OER over Ni-Co oxide structured by KIT-6 templating and non-structured Ni-Co oxide catalysts in alkaline solution have been investigated aiming for insight with regard to the respective kinetically relevant surface reactions. Steady-state Tafel plot analysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to determine kinetic parameters, Tafel slopes and the order of reaction. A dual Tafel slope behavior was observed for both catalysts. Tafel slopes of ca. 40 and 120 mV dec(-1) and 90 and 180 mV dec(-1) at low and high overpotentials appear for structured and non-structured Ni-Co oxide, respectively. A reaction order of unity was observed for structured Ni-Co oxide, while non-structured Ni-Co oxide possessed a fractional reaction order in the high overpotential region. The kinetics of OER over structured Ni-Co oxide were governed by Langmuir adsorption with the rate-limiting step after primary adsorption of surface intermediates. In contrast, non-structured Ni-Co oxide obeyed the Temkin adsorption isotherm condition with the primary adsorption step being rate-limiting.									38	1	0	0	0	0	38			2196-0216			WOS:000492431900001

However, the overall efficiency is strongly limited by the low activity of Ga-LTCA. The present work demonstrates a drastic improvement in the H-2 evolution activity of Ga-LTCA after loading small Rh cocatalyst particles exhibiting uniform dispersion and intimate contact with the photocatalyst. Using this system, an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 11.2 +/- 0.9% at 420 nm was obtained for H-2 evolution from an aqueous Na2S-Na2SO3 solution, this being the highest value yet reported for a sacrificial H-2 evolution reaction using an oxysulfide photocatalyst. Following modification with a Cr2O3 layer, efficient Z-scheme water splitting was also accomplished using the cocatalyst-loaded Ga-LTCA in combination with H+/Cs+/PtOx/WO3 as the OEP, with an improved AQY of 2.4% at 420 nm.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000723805800001

In this work, we introduce approximately 1 at % cobalt to tungsten sulfides nanosheets (Co-WS2) to create a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A boosted ORR activity with half-wave potential of 840 mV vs. RHE is achieved for Co-WS2 compared to that of WS2 (776 mV vs. RHE). Meanwhile, the overpotential for delivering 10 mA cm(-2) in OER catalysis is decreased from 492 to 303 mV after doping with Co atoms. The excellent ORR and OER activities are ascribed to the presence of Co2+ and Co3+ species in Co-WS2, enabling OOH* intermediate formation and strong binding ability to O-2, respectively. The assembled liquid rechargeable ZAB from Co-WS2 exhibits a threefold higher power density than commercial Pt/C-IrO2; moreover, a stable discharge-charge performance (100 cycles) is recorded. Finally, the fabricated all-solid-sate ZAB exhibits a reasonably high power density of 58 mW cm(-2) and good stability, implying the potential application of Co-WS2 as an air electrode for rechargeable ZABs.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2196-0216			WOS:000492768600001

From Arrhenius plots, apparent activation energies, E(a), and apparent pre-exponential factors, A, were calculated for the oxygen-reduction and oxygen-evolution reactions at La0.84Sr0.16MnO3 cathodes. At low overpotentials (\eta\less-than-or-equal-to 0.2 V), both apparent activation energies and apparent pre-exponential factors are much higher in the temperature range T = 800-1000-degrees-C (E(a) almost-equal-to 160-210 kJ/mol, log A almost-equal-to 6-9) compared with those in the range T= 500-800-degrees-C (E(a) almost-equal-to 80-110 kJ/mol, log A = 2-4). For oxygen reduction, reaction orders of z(e) = 1 at p(O2) > 0.2 bar and z(e) = 0.5 at p(O2) < 0.2 bar were obtained. These values may be related to either oxygen adsorbed as molecules or atoms as the reacting species. From impedance spectroscopy, it follows that the rate of the oxygen-exchange reaction is determined not only by charge transfer, but also by another process, possibly the adsorption or surface diffusion of intermediates. For the nickel zirconia cermet anode fabricated by wet powder spraying (WPS), an increase in sintering temperature to 1400-degrees-C results in an increase in current density. A current density of 0.27 A cm-2 at an overvoltage of 0.1 V may be achieved. From Arrhenius plots, an energy of activation of 130 +/- 10 kJ mol-1 was determined.					3rd Grove Fuel Cell Symposium: The Science, Engineering and Practice of Fuel Cells3rd Grove Fuel Cell Symposium: The Science, Engineering and Practice of Fuel Cells	SEP 28-OCT 01, 1993SEP 28-OCT 01, 1993	ELSEVIER SCI LTDELSEVIER SCI LTD	IMPERIAL COLL, LONDON, ENGLANDIMPERIAL COLL, LONDON, ENGLAND	36	3	0	0	0	0	38			0378-7753			WOS:A1994NP06100019

The key to its success is to design an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst with efficient conversion and reliable stability. Interface engineering is one of the most effective approaches for adjusting local electronic configurations. Adding other metal elements is also an effective way to enrich active sites and improve catalytic activity. Herein, high-valence iron in a heterogeneous interface of NiFe2O4/NiMoO4 composite was obtained through oxygen plasma to achieve excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability. In particular, 270 mV of overpotential is required to reach a current density of 50 mA cm(-2), and the overpotential required to reach 500 mA cm(-2) is only 309 mV. The electron transfer effect for high-valence iron was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The fast and irreversible reconstruction and the true active species in the catalytic process were identified by in situ Raman, ex situ XPS, and ex situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements. This work provides a feasible design guideline to modify electronic structures, promote a metal to an active oxidation state, and thus develop an electrocatalyst with enhanced OER performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1996-1944		WOS:000803212400001	35629714

J	Liu, Feng; Liu, Jing; Yang, Yingju; Wang, Zhen; Zheng, Chuguang								Reaction mechanism of spinel CuFe2O4 with CO during chemical-looping combustion: An experimental and theoretical study								PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE				37	4			4399	4408		10.1016/j.proci.2018.06.222				2019	2019	Spinel CuFe2O4 is a promising oxygen carrier due to its synergistic enhanced performance. A fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanism between oxygen carrier and fuels is important for a rational design of highly efficient oxygen carrier. The reaction mechanism of spinel CuFe2O4 with CO during chemical-looping combustion (CLC) was studied based on thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Two distinct reaction stages were clearly observed. CuFe2O4 was mainly transformed into Cu and Fe3O4 with a rapid reaction rate in the initial stage, and then product Fe3O4 was slowly reduced to FeO or even to Fe. The reactivity of CuFe2O4 is much higher than that of Fe2O3, which is ascribed to the existence of Cu. The enhanced oxygen evolution activity of CuFe2O4 at low temperature is validated by both the experimental and theoretical methods. Three types of surface oxygen coordinated with different metal atoms show different reactivity. Two kinds of reaction pathways are involved in CO oxidation over CuFe2O4. In the one-step reaction pathway, CO directly reacts with the oxygen bonding to two octahedral Cu and one octahedral Fe atoms to form a CO2 molecule without an energy barrier, which corresponds to the surface oxygen consumption observed in TGA experiments. In the possible two-step reaction pathway, CO first adsorbs on the surface, and then reacts with the oxygen bound to one octahedral Cu and two octahedral Fe atoms to generate CO2 by surmounting an energy barrier of 10.84 kJ/mol, which is the most kinetically and thermodynamically favorable pathway.

Here the active forms of these materials are elucidated by synthesizing a hybrid catalyst, which has a metal chalcogenide in the form of CoSe2 and metal phosphide in the form of CoPCoSe2|CoP. Both CoSe2 and CoP in the as-prepared catalyst are completely transformed into their respective oxyhydroxides and hydroxides, which are, in fact, the true OER-active species in alkaline medium and not the selenide and phosphide themselves. The derived oxides from the hybrid catalyst deliver an excellent OER activity by reaching a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 240 mV (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and a Tafel slope of 46.6 mV dec(-1). The stability of the derived oxyhydroxide/hydroxide catalyst shows no appreciable deactivation during 120 h of continuous electrolysis, displaying an extraordinary operational stability.									14	2	0	0	0	0	14			0934-0866	1521-4117		WOS:000441893400011

In this paper, the first-principles thermodynamic calculations were performed to study the catalytic activity of X-doped graphene (X = B, N, Al, Si, and P) materials as potential cathodes to enhance charge reactions in a lithium-air battery. Among these materials, P-doped graphene exhibits the highest catalytic activity in reducing the charge voltage by 0.25 V, while B-doped graphene has the highest catalytic activity in decreasing the oxygen evolution barrier by 0.12 eV. By combining these two catalytic effects, B, P-codoped graphene was demonstrated to have an enhanced catalytic activity in reducing the O-2 evolution barrier by 0.70 eV and the charge voltage by 0.13 V. B-doped graphene interacts with Li2O2 by Li-sited adsorption in which the electron-withdrawing center can enhance charge transfer from Li2O2 to the substrate, facilitating reduction of O-2 evolution barrier. In contrast, X-doped graphene (X = N, Al, Si, and P) prefers O-sited adsorption toward Li2O2, forming a X-O-2(2-)...Li+ interface structure between X-O-2(2-) and the rich Li+ layer. The active structure of X-O-2(2-) can weaken the surrounding Li-O-2 bonds and significantly reduce Li+ desorption energy at the interface. Our investigation is helpful in developing a novel catalyst to enhance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in Li-air batteries.									60	3	0	0	5	0	62			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000355633400037	25970821

Herein, for the first time Ni is combined with MnO species, and a 3D porous graphene aerogel-supported Ni/MnO (Ni-MnO/rGO aerogel) bifunctional catalyst is prepared via a facile and scalable hydrogel route. The synthetic strategy depends on the formation of a graphene oxide (GO) crosslinked poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogel that allows for the efficient capture of highly active Ni/MnO particles after pyrolysis. Remarkably, the resulting Ni-MnO/rGO aerogels exhibit superior bifunctional catalytic performance for both ORR and OER in an alkaline electrolyte, which can compete with the previously reported bifunctional electrocatalysts. The MnO mainly contributes to the high activity for the ORR, while metallic Ni is responsible for the excellent OER activity. Moreover, such bifunctional catalyst can endow the homemade Zn-air battery with better power density, specific capacity, and cycling stability than mixed Pt/C + RuO2 catalysts, demonstrating its potential feasibility in practical application of rechargeable metal-air batteries.									422	25	0	0	23	1	425			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000423793100012	29235164

In this work, we design an electrocatalyst of the edge-rich nickel sulfide arrays on the nickel foam (Ni3S2 NSs-NF) by a facile yet efficient wet-chemical method. Benefiting from the three-dimensional nanostructure with numerous active edges, the prepared Ni3S2 NSs-NF exhibits superior OER performance in alkaline conditions. An in-depth study reveals that the real active sites toward OER are the in situ formed heterogenous Ni3S2-NiOOH. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate the density of state (DOS) of the Ni3S2-NiOOH heterojunction near the Fermi level is enhanced, contributing to higher electronic conductivity. As a result, the Ni3S2 NSs-NF with abundant Ni3S2-NiOOH heterojunctions exhibits an efficient electrochemical activity toward OER in alkaline conditions. The Ni3S2 NSs-NF electrode shows an overpotential of 244 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 75 mV dec(-1) and possesses ultrastable performance even at 100 mA cm(-2).									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000800363400001

RuO2, Ru0.7Rh0.3O2 and IrO2 pellet electrodes have been prepared and the occurrence of the hydrogen evolution reaction on these oxides has been characterised by cyclic voltammetric and galvanostatic polarization curves in 2.5 M H-2 SO4 solution at room temperature. Measurements of the pH dependence of the surface charge densities on oxide particles have been carried out to correlate surface oxide properties with electrochemical properties. Reaction mechanistic pathways on metals and intermetallic compounds have incorporated the adsorption of hydrogen atoms on metal sites. It is suggested from the correlation of surface acid/base properties of oxides with their electrochemical properties that the sites of reaction are the surface oxygen atoms covalently bonded to suitable cations and possessing the appropriate energetics in the oxides.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0253-4134			WOS:A1997WQ65400001

In this paper, we reported a novel electrocatalyst based on an exfoliated two-dimensional (2D) MXene (Ti3C2Tx) loaded with bimetallic oxide alloy nanoparticles (NPs) of Pt and Pd (represented by PtOaPdObNPs@Ti3C2Tx), which was synthesized via solution plasma (SP) modification. The prepared materials were then utilized as highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts toward the HER and OER in alkaline solution. At a high plasma input power (200 W), bimetallic oxide alloy nanoparticles of Pt and Pd or nanoclusters with different metallic valence states were deposited onto the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets. Because of the synergism of the noble-metal NPs and the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets, the electrocatalytic results revealed that the as-prepared PtOaPdObNPs@Ti3C2Tx nanosheets under the plasma input power of 200 W for 3 min only required a low overpotential to attain 10 mA cm2 for the HER (-26.5 mV) in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution and OER (1.54 V) in 0.1 M KOH solution. Moreover, water electrolysis using this catalyst achieved a water splitting current density of 10 mA cm2 at a low cell voltage of 1.53 V in 1.0 M KOH solution. These results suggested that the hybridization of the extremely low usage of PtOa/PdOb NPs (1.07 mu g cm2) and Ti3C2Tx nanosheets by SP will expand the applications of other clean energy reactions to achieve sustainable energy.									76	7	0	0	1	0	77			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000439528400049	29939006

In this work, Co-Fe alloy nanochains are presented as efficient catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction. The nanochains with uniform nanospheres coupled to each other can range up to several micrometers. A metal-metal oxide heterostructure is attained when the alloy is exposed to the air or oxidized by the electrochemical process. The metal can inject electrons into the surface oxide, which changes the work function of the oxide and improves its catalytic efficiency. Series of samples with different compositions (Co, Co7Fe3, Co5Fe5, Co3Fe7, and Fe) were prepared and the effect of Fe/Co ratio on the catalytic activity was studied. Co7Fe3 exhibits the optimal performance with an onset point of 1.50 V (vs. RHE) and an overpotential of 365 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The nanochains also exhibit excellent stability with 92.0% current retention after a long-term chronoamperometry test. Cobalt-based alloys with other metals (Ti, Nb, and Mo) are synthesized by the same method and they have also shown promising application in the oxygen evolution reaction.									18	2	0	0	1	0	18			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000433163900018

In alkaline electrolyte, Platinum (Pt) shows a much slower hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics relative to acidic condition. Here, we show a versatile synthetic approach for combining different noble metals, such as Rhodium (Rh), RhPt and Pt nanoparticles, with carbon forming noble metal nanoparticles/nanocarbon composites, denoted as Rh(nP)/nC, RhPt(nP)/nC and Pt(nP)/nC, respectively. It was found that in alkaline media these composites exhibited higher performance for the HER than the commercial Pt/C. In particular, Rh(nP)/nC displayed a small overpotential of 44 mV at a current density of 5 mA cm(-2)and a low Tafel slope of 50 mV dec(-1). Meanwhile, it also showed a comparable activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to the benchmarking catalyst RuO2. The superior HER and OER performance benefits from the very small size of nanoparticles and synergy between carbon support and nanoparticles.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000579877200006	33001129

It stands out in a range of cobalt-based materials and is even comparable to some precious-metal-based materials composed of Pt or Ru. A shown by with structural characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the interfaces between CoP/Co nanoparticles not only provide the active sites of HzOR but also promote the multistep dehydrogenation reaction of N2H4, thus enhancing the HzOR activity.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1948-7185			WOS:000657347700011	34000185

Here, we report a simple method to prepare A-site deficiency SrxCo0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (x = 0.9, 0.95, 1) perovskites by sol-gel. XRD. SEM and XPS are used to characterize structure and element valence of catalysts. The introduction of A-site deficiency results in the expansion of lattice expansion due to the increase of oxygen vacancies and optimization of e(g) occupancy of B-site transition metal, which greatly improves the OER activity of catalysts. Among them, Sr0.95Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (S0.95CF) exists the best activity. Besides, after the durability test, an unusual activation process with enhanced OER activity was observed for all the prepared perovskites. This work highlights the importance of tailoring A-site deficiency of perovskites as a valid strategy to improve OER activity. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We have deliberately chosen a high boiling solvent and a combination of high and low boiling solvents to control the morphology. The synthesized In2S3 hollow spheres proved to be electrocatalytically active for an overall electrocatalytic water splitting and drive the oxygen evolution reactions at 230 mV and the hydrogen evolution reactions at 239 mV to produce a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000660888300001

In this review, the latest progress of the MOF-derived non-noble metal-oxygen electrocatalysts in ZABs is reviewed. The performance of these MOF-derived catalysts toward oxygen reduction, and oxygen evolution reactions is discussed based on the categories of metal-free carbon materials, single-atom catalysts, metal cluster/carbon composites and metal compound/carbon composites. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive overview on the design strategies of various MOF-derived non-noble metal-oxygen electrocatalysts and their structure-performance relationship.

J	Xiaoning Li; Zhenxiang Cheng; Xiaolin Wang								Understanding the mechanism of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the consideration of spin [arXiv]								arXiv								15 pp.	15 pp.						11 April 2020	2020	Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with intractable high overpotential is the rate-limiting step for rechargeable metal-air battery, water electrolysis systems, and solar fuels devices. There exists a spin state transition from spin singlet OH-/H2O reactant to spin triplet O2 product, which has not received enough attention yet. In this perspective, we attempt to retrospect electron behaviours during the whole OER process, with the consideration of spin attribute. Regardless of the adopted mechanisms by different electrocatalysts, for example, adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) or lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM), the underlying rationale is that active sites have to extract three in four electrons with the same spin direction before the formation of O=O. This spin-sensitive nature of OER superimposes additional high requirements on the electrocatalysts, especially on the spin structure, to compliment the fast electron transfer in the interface with spin selection and smoothly delivery afterwards. When optimizing the geometric and electronic structures catering for the spin-sensitive OER, awareness of the couplings between spin, charge, orbital and lattice is necessary. Some spin-correlated physical properties, such as (1) crystal field, (2) coordination, (3) oxidation, (4) bonding, (5) eg electron number, (6) conductivity and (7) magnetism, are also discussed briefly. It is hoped that our perspective could shed lights on the underlying physics of the slow kinetics of OER, providing a rational guidance for more effective energy conversion electrocatalysts designs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0						INSPEC:19761192

Heterostructured materials, with a high active surface area and electron effect, accomplish enhanced catalytic performance. Here, a nitride-sulfide composite (FeNi3N-Ni3S2) has been prepared by a simple hydrothermal process coupled with nitridation. The prepared composite electrocatalyst FeNi3N-Ni3S2 possesses lower electron densities compared to those of FeNi3N and Ni3S2, lessening the activation energy (E-a) toward the OER. Consequently, the prepared FeNi3N-Ni3S2 exhibits excellent OER performance with a low overpotential (230 mV) and a small Tafel slope (38 mV dec(-1)). Highly stable FeNi3N-Ni3S2 composite delivers lower charging voltage and extended lifetime in rechargeable Zn-air battery, compared with IrO2.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000572965700050	32804470

OER influences some important renewable clean energy technologies such as water splitting. In this study, a highly active matrix based on NiO and porous reduced graphene oxide (NiO-prGO) nanocomposite was prepared by simple and efficient electrochemical routine and characterised, which presents good performance for OER. The superior electrochemical performance of prGO nanosheets might be attributed to their high surface area, which could efficiently accelerate rate of the whole electrochemical reaction and improve the catalytic activity for OER in alkaline solution. NiO-prGO modified carbon paste electrode (NiO-prGO/CPE) exhibits more negative onset potential and high current density in NaOH 0.1 M compared to NiO-reduced graphene oxide modified CPE (NiO-rGO/CPE), NiO-graphene oxide modified CPE (NiO-GO/CPE) and NiO modified CPE (NiO/CPE), which indicates pores can significantly enhance NiO loading and the OER performance. The electro-catalytic activity and stability of the catalysts were evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry and chronoamperometry, showing that the NiO on prGO was beneficial for both OER activity and stability. This report affords a hybrid electro-catalyst, which can be applied to energy conversion storage processes.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			1023-1935	1608-3342		WOS:000470325900010

In this assembly, monolayer graphene works as an interfacial layer which inhibits the direct contact of the actual electroactive material and electrolyte during electrochemical reaction. The results show that while graphene is electrochemically inert, it behaves as an active material to catalyze oxygen evolution reaction (OER) once placed on top of Co3O4 nanosheets. The graphene-covered Co3O4 model system shows electrochemical performance similar to Co3O4 indicating complete transference of the electrochemical property of the metal oxide to the graphene. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, charge transfer from graphene to Co3O4 is the key factor for turning the electrochemically inactive graphene to an apparent active material.

Herein, an advanced electrocatalyst possessing shells of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) on molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) for efficient electrocatalytic activity in alkaline electrolytes is reported. The strained sheets of curved MoS2 surround the surface of Mo2C, turning the inactive basal planes of MoS2 into highly active electrocatalytic sites in the alkaline electrolyte. The van der Waals layers, which even possess van der Waals epitaxy along (100) facets of MoS2 and Mo2C, enhance the spin coupling between MoS2 and Mo2C, providing an easy electron transfer path for excellent electrocatalytic activity in alkaline electrolytes and solving the stability issue. In addition, it is found that curved MoS2 sheets on Mo2C show 3.45% tensile strain in the lattice, producing excellent catalytic activity for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) (with E-1/2 = 0.60 V vs RHE) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (overpotential = 1.51 V vs RHE at 10 mA cm(-2)) with 60 times higher electrochemical active area than pristine MoS2. The unique structure and synthesis route outlined here provide a novel and efficient approach toward designing highly active, durable, and cost-effective ORR and OER electrocatalysts.									33	3	0	0	2	0	33			2196-7350			WOS:000487375600001

To speed up the sluggish hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER), electrocatalysts are essential for reducing their kinetic energy barriers and eventually improving the energy conversion efficiency. As efficient strategies for modulating the binding ability of water-splitting intermediates on electrocatalyst surface, the support effect and interface effect are drawing growing attention. Herein, some of the recent research progress on the support and interface effects in HER, OER, and overall water-splitting electrocatalysts is highlighted. Specifically, the correlation between the electronic interaction of the constituent components and the electrocatalytic water-splitting performance of electrocatalysts is profoundly discussed, with the aim of advancing the development of highly efficient water-splitting electrocatalysts, which may eventually replace the noble-metal-based electrocatalysts and bring the practically widespread utilization of water-splitting electrolyzers into a reality.									201	8	0	0	15	0	201			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000484129400008	30838688

This study reports a general method for controllable synthesis of a class of IrM (M = Co, Ni, CoNi) multimetallic porous hollow nanocrystals (PHNCs), through etching Ir-based, multimetallic, solid nanocrystals using Fe3+ ions, as catalysts for boosting overall water splitting. The Ir-based multimetallic PHNCs show transition-metal-dependent bifunctional electrocatalytic activities for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic electrolyte, with IrCo and IrCoNi PHNCs being the best for HER and OER, respectively. First-principles calculations reveal a ligand effect, induced by alloying Ir with 3d transition metals, can weaken the adsorption energy of oxygen intermediates, which is the key to realizing much-enhanced OER activity. The IrCoNi PHNCs are highly efficient in overall-water-splitting catalysis by showing a low cell voltage of only 1.56 V at a current density of 2 mA cm(-2), and only 8 mV of polarization-curve shift after a 1000-cycle durability test in 0.5 m H2SO4 solution. This work highlights a potentially powerful strategy toward the general synthesis of novel, multimetallic, PHNCs as highly active and durable bifunctional electrocatalysts for high-performance electrochemical overall-water-splitting devices.									308	15	0	0	15	0	310			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000418068700012	29083497

Using liquid exfoliated Co(OH)(2) nanosheets as a model system, a simple procedure is developed to maximize the activity of any oxygen evolution reaction nanocatalyst. First the nanosheet edges are confirmed as the active areas by analyzing the catalytic activity as a function of nanosheet size. This allows the authors to select the smallest nanosheets (length approximate to 50 nm) as the best performing catalysts. While the number of active sites per unit electrode area can be increased via the electrode thickness, this is found to be impossible beyond approximate to 10 mu m due to mechanical instabilities. However, adding carbon nanotubes increases both toughness and conductivity significantly. These enhancements mean that composite electrodes consisting of small Co(OH)(2) nanosheets and 10 wt% nanotubes can be made into freestanding films with thickness of up to 120 mu m with no apparent electrical limitations. The presence of diffusion limitations results in an optimum electrode thickness of 70 mu m, yielding a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 235 mV, close to the state of the art in the field. Applying this procedure to a high-performance catalyst such as NiFeOx should significantly surpass the state of the art.									76	3	0	0	5	0	76			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000434031400009

However, to date, their application is still limited by insufficient electronic conductivity. The widely applied carbon conductive additives are thermodynamically instable during OER process. Herein, we report for the first time an efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst for Zn-air batteries (ZABs) based on alpha-MnO(2 )NWs modified by stable and highly conductive TiC nanoparticles (NPs). TiC NPs are uniformly distributed on alpha-MnO2 NWs, which effectively compensate for the relatively low electron conductivity of alpha-MnO(2 )NWs and thereby facilitate the charge transfer process. TiC-modified alpha-MnO2 NWs (TiC/alpha-MnO2NW) delivers a remarkable bifunctional activity with a half-wave potential of 0.78 V for ORR and a low potential of 1.64 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER, far exceeding the pristine alpha-MnO2 NWs. Impressively, its ORR activity is comparable to Pt/C and OER activity is superior to IrO2. The ZAB with TiC/alpha-MnO2NW achieves a higher peak power density of 161 mW cm(-2) and a better cycle performance than those for ZAB using Pt/C-IrO2 benchmark. The TiC/alpha-MnO2NW material suggests a promising strategy for designing active and durable bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Difficulties in synthesising the material in its cubic phase have been overcome by doping it with Sc and Nb ions [Mater. Horiz. 2015, 2, 495-501]. Using ab initio calculations and special quasi random structures we undertake a systematic study of these dopants in order to elucidate the effect of doping on electronic structure of the SrCoO3 host and the formation of oxygen vacancies. We find that while the overall electronic structure of SrCoO3 is preserved, increasing the Sc fraction leads to a decrease of electrical conductivity, in agreement with earlier experimental work. For low Sc and Nb doping fractions we find that the oxygen vacancy formation increases relative to undoped SrCoO3. However, as the dopants concentration is increased the vacancy formation energy drops significantly, indicating a strong tendency to accommodate high concentration of oxygen vacancies and hence non-stoichiometry. This is explained based on the electronic instabilities caused by the presence of Sc ions which weakens the B-O interactions as well as the increased degree of electron delocalization on the oxygen sublattice. Sc dopants also shift the p-band centre closer to the Fermi level, which can be associated with experimentally reported improvements in oxygen evolution reactions. These findings provide crucial baseline information for the design of better electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reactions as well as fuel-cell cathode materials.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2405-8297			WOS:000413971500026

Benefitted from robust integration, the original aggregation and restacking of individual materials have been overcome, thereby leading to superior elelctrocatalysis durability. This facile and universal strategy may inspire the researchers on the design and construction of advanced functional composites. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Here we present laser ablation synthesis in solution in tandem with galvanic replacement reaction (LASiS-GRR), for the first time, as a facile route to synthesize nanocomposites (NCs) of PtCo nanaoalloy (NA) embedded in CoOx matrices as bifunctional electrocatalysts. High resolution TEM reveals PtCo NA of mean sizes similar to 8.5-17.7 nm embedded in sponge-shaped CoOx matrices, while electron diffraction and X-ray diffraction data along with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) confirm the NC compositions and crystalline structures. Detailed electrochemistry data indicates outstanding ORR and OER activities for the PtCo/CoOx NCs while exhibiting better stability than the respective standard nanocatalysts. Such activities are ascribed to the shrunken lattice constants of alloyed PtCo that promote oxygen adsorption and the synergic "spillover" effect from high surface area CoOx matrices that accelerate both ORR and OER through symbiotic adsorption/desorption of intermediate species, while preventing aggregation and/or dissolution in alkaline medium. We report a combined overpotential of 756 mV vs. RHE for the PtCo/CoOx NC with 33.3% (molar) Pt content which is the best value ever reported for catalysts supported by carbon black. The enhanced bifunctional catalytic activities of the NCs are attributed to their unique heteronanostructures tailored by our one-pot, "green" synthesis route of LASiS-GRR. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It is noted that optimized 30 mol% nickel-substituted cobalt carbonate hydroxide hydrate (NCCHH-30) nanostructures show quite high specific surface area (similar to 229.55 m(2) g(-1)) owing to the formation of hierarchically hollow interconnected ring-type morphology facilitating the electrode-electrolyte interfacial interaction. As a result, NCCHH-30 showed significant amplification in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with ultralow overpotential (similar to 141 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2)), Tafel slope (similar to 49 mV dec(-1)), and excellent durability (12 h and 2000 cycles) in 1.0 M KOH. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, interconnected NCCHH-30 hierarchical hollow rings exhibited the best overpotential (eta(100) similar to 198 mV) value reported for cobalt-based electrocatalysts in alkaline OER. In addition, this material exhibited exceptionally high oxygen evolution performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art commercial RuO2 electrocatalyst in 1.0 M KOH. Such interconnected hierarchically hollow nickel (30 mol%)-substituted cobalt carbonate hydroxide hydrate nanostructured rings could act as an ultraefficient, cost-effective, and stable electrocatalyst for OER in alkaline medium.

Owing to the vigorous gas evolution, the durability under OER conditions is disappointingly low for most powder electrocatalysts as there are no strategies to securely fix powder catalysts onto electrode surfaces. Thus reliable studies of catalysts during or after the OER are often impaired. Herein, we propose the use of composites made from precursors of polybenzoxazines and organophilically modified NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) to form a stable and highly conducting catalyst layer, which allows the study of the catalyst before and after electrocatalysis. Characterization of the material by XRD, SEM, and TEM before and after 100 h electrolysis in 5 M KOH at 60 degrees C and a current density of 200 mA cm(-2) revealed previously not observed structural changes.									96	2	0	0	4	0	96			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000408605300031	28649797

Herein, biomass-derived nitrogen self-doped porous carbon nanosheets (NPCNS) are produced by a facile and green pyrolysis of Euonymus japonicus leaves at controlled temperature and then the nitric acid pickling was carried out to remove the excess metal ingredients. The obtained NPCNS exhibits a hierarchically porous distribution, high BET surface area and uniform nitrogen doping. Electrochemical measurements show that the NPCNS possess a high electrocatalytic activity for both ORR and OER. Among these NPCNS catalysts, the sample carbonized at 900 degrees C (NPCNS-900) with the highest concentration of pyridinic nitrogen shows the best ORR and OER activity. According to our DFT calculations, the high content of pyridinic nitrogen with the moderate O and OH adsorption energies among the three types of nitrogen should be the critical factor for the efficient catalytic performance of NPCNS-900 toward ORR and OER. This work demonstrates that the facile prepared NPCNS-900 is a potential candidate material with excellent performance in electrocatalytic applications such as fuel cells or metal-air batteries.

The as-prepared electrocatalyst exhibits excellent bifunctional oxygen activity, with a low overpotential of 304 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction and a high halfwave potential (0.861 V) for the oxygen reduction reaction, resulting in a low potential gap (DE) of 0.673 V. The exceptional composite design and synergistic interaction of each component are responsible for the excellent bifunctional catalytic performance. Furthermore, FeCo-NCNT arrays on carbon cloth are used as binder-free air cathodes for both aqueous zinc-air batteries (ZABs) and flexible quasi-solid-state ZABs, which also have a high specific capacity of 881.8 mAh/gZn and excellent stability (working life of >245 h at 5 mA/cm2) for aqueous ZABs. Density functional theory calculation further reveals the synergy mechanism between Fe-N4, Co-N4 atomic sites and FeCo-nanoparticles, which can induce higher Fe-d/ Co-d anti-bond orbitals filling degree and weaken the binding ability of oxygen intermediates, as a result in improving the oxygen evolution reaction/oxygen reduction reaction activity.

Even activators enhancing the activity of the OER catalyst by promoting the redox reactions are reported, but here the exclusive position of iron in the nanostructures indeed boosted the efficiency due to ideal placement. Moreover, these nanostructures are also prepared in a sophisticated mechanistic approach in which selectively one metal is phosphidated and the other is not. Interestingly, in the absence of iron, nickel phosphide crystallized in a different shape, but in the presence of iron, this specifically formed amorphous NixP became more efficient for promoting the OER. Details of the formation of this active catalyst are studied; the electrochemical reactions are investigated, and the OER activity is compared with that of different leading metal phosphides.									50	1	0	0	2	0	50			2380-8195			WOS:000422814500021

Ligand-protected Au-n NCs can be synthesized with atomic precision, and the geometric structures of many Au-n NCs have been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. In addition, Au-n NCs can be doped with various types of elements. Clarification of the effects of changes to the chemical composition, geometric structure, and associated electronic state on catalytic activity would enable a deep understanding of the active sites and mechanisms in catalytic reactions as well as key factors for high activation. Furthermore, it may be possible to synthesize Au-n NCs with properties that surpass those of conventional catalysts using the obtained design guidelines. With these expectations, catalyst research using Au-n NCs as a model catalyst has been actively conducted in recent years. This review focuses on the application of Au-n NCs as an electrocatalyst and outlines recent research progress.									23	0	0	0	1	0	23				2079-4991		WOS:000522456300057	32013164

Herein, porous dendritic alloyed Pt68Ag32 nanodandelions (NDs) were synthesized by a one-pot successive co-reduction method, using amrinone as the new stabilizer and structure director, without any template, seed or complicated instrument. The correlative shapes, composition, and crystalline structure were examined by a range of characterization techniques. It is found that the molar ratio of the precursors (AgNO3 and H2PtCl6), the dosage of amrinone, and different reductants play the essential roles during the synthesis process. The Pt68Ag32 NDs exhibited dramatically enlarged electrochemically active surface area, enhanced catalytic activity and stability for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as compared to commercial Pt/C, Pt black, home-made Pt75Ag25 nanocrystals (NCs) and Pt56Ag44 NCs catalysts.

Herein, we report a novel efficient bifunctional OER/ORR catalyst of Co9S8/CNT, which is synthesized using an advanced technique of atomic layer deposition (ALD) for conformally coating a uniform thin layer of Co9S8 on a high-surface-area carbon-nanotube (CNT) network scaffold. The ALD-synthesized Co9S8/CNT catalyst displays remarkable electrocatalytic performance with excellent catalytic activity and stability toward both the OER and ORR, and is further demonstrated to be a superior bifunctional oxygen catalyst for high-performance rechargeable Zn-air batteries. The fabricated aqueous rechargeable Zn-air batteries are able to deliver a remarkably high power density with superior long-term cycling stability, and the fabricated solid-state rechargeable Zn-air batteries are able to display very good flexibility and stability upon bending.

The material displays excellent electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction, reaching a high limiting diffusion current density of -7.8 mA cm(-2) , outperforming metal-organic frameworks derived multifunctional electrocatalysts, and oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction with low overpotentials of 380 and 107 mV, respectively. When the electrochemical properties are further evaluated, the electrocatalyst as an air cathode for Zn-air batteries exhibits a high cycling stability for 63 h as well as a maximum power density of 308 mW cm(-2) , which is better than those for most Zn-air batteries reported to date. In addition, a power density of 152 mW cm(-2) is provided by the solid-state Zn-air batteries, and the cycling stability is outstanding for 24 h. The remarkable electrocatalytic properties are attributed to the synergistic effect of the 3D porous carbon nanofibers network and abundant inserted CoNxC active sites, which enable the fast transmission of ions and mass and simultaneously provide a large contact area for the electrode/electrolyte.

The ORR is happened in cathode electrode in fuel cells or metal air batteries when discharging, the OER is occurred in anode electrode in water splitting or rechargeable metal air batteries when charging. Currently, the high-performance catalyst developed for ORR still relies on platinum (Pt) and its alloys. On the other hand, ruthenium (Ru) oxides were demonstrated to be high performance electrocatalysts for OER. However, their scarcity, limited stability, and aggregation limited the development of electrochemistry energy storage and conversion. Herein, we synthesize a series of transition metal nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (M-CNT) and further decorating the interface of N-CNT with Fe element for enhancing oxygen catalytic activities. The results show that the type of transition metal determine the morphologies of N-CNT and the catalytic performance in ORR and OER. After further modification by introducing Fe element, the Fe-CNT based catalyst displays a superior ORR activity, even surpasses that of Pt/C, the Ni-CNT based catalyst with Fe decoration also showes a significant enhancement in OER. This work provides a feasible strategy to develop highly efficient oxygen catalysts with low-cost, earth-abundant transition metal elements via further decoration.					6th International Conference on Advanced Composite Materials and Manufacturing Engineering (ACMME 2019)6th International Conference on Advanced Composite Materials and Manufacturing Engineering (ACMME 2019)	22-23 June 201922-23 June 2019		Yunnan, ChinaYunnan, China	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1757-8981			INSPEC:19062194

The optical properties of the films were also characterized to evaluate their application as window layers. The polycrystalline films deposited at residual gas pressures of 6 or 10 mTorr exhibited moderate activity for oxygen evolution in 1 N KOH and pronounced coloration and bleaching during alternating anodic/cathodic bias. Properties of these films were not sensitive to growth rate over the range studied, 0.5 to 4 Angstrom/s. In contrast, films deposited at 2 mTorr exhibited poor activity for oxygen evolution and severely limited electrochromic behavior which we attribute to marked changes in the morphology and crystallinity in the low-pressure films. The films grown at 6 mTorr and higher tended to be more oriented, to have a higher degree of crystallinity, and higher oxygen content. Strong linkages between the electrochemical and optical behaviors observed in this work provide new insights into the processes involved in oxygen evolution reaction catalysis and electrochromism in reactively sputtered NiOx films. The results presented indicate that reactive sites located on or near grain boundaries are responsible for both behaviors.									76	6	0	0	4	0	80			0013-4651			WOS:A1997XH82800036

Electrocatalysis for reactions of oxygen reduction and evolution and their involvement in the storage of renewable energy								BOLETIN DEL GRUPO ESPANOL DEL CARBON					55			28	31						MAR 2020	2020	The electrochemical reactions of oxygen reduction and evolution are fundamental for the development of electrochemical devices for the conversion and storage of renewable energy such as electrolysers, fuel cells and regenerative fuel cells. The hydrogen would be generated from the electrolysis of water when there is excess of energy, and the fuel cell generates electricity when the demand increases and stored hydrogen is available. If both stacks are combined into a single unit, the cell is called unitized regenerative fuel cell, where only one of the two modes (electrolyser or fuel cell) can be operated at one time. Research and development efforts are currently focused on obtaining electrocatalysts capable of reducing oxygen and oxidising water, both in terms of efficiency (high overpotentials) and durability (aggressive degradation conditions).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2172-6094			WOS:000518457700006

The electrocatalytic activity of Sr2PdO3 toward OER was assessed via the anodic potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The glassy carbon modified Sr2PdO3 (GC/Sr2PdO3) electrode exhibited a higher electrocatalytic activity, by about 50 times, in comparison to the unmodified electrode. The order of the reaction was close to unity, which indicates that the adsorption of the hydroxyl groups is a fast step. The calculated activation energy was 21.6 kJ.mol(-1), which can be considered a low value in evaluation with those of the reported OER electrocatalysts. The Sr2PdO3 perovskite portrayed a high catalyst stability without any probability of catalyst poisoning. These results encourage the use of Sr2PdO3 as a candidate electrocatalyst for water splitting reactions.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				1422-0067		WOS:000543400300047	32471134

Representative ultrathin petal edge exposes adequate active sites and provides a sufficient contact interface between Li2O2 and positive electrode, which are essential for reducing the charge overpotential during OER.

Here, we investigate the effect of inactive MoO(4)(2-& nbsp;)escaped from a pre-catalyst of Fe incorporated nickel-molybdenum oxyhydroxide (NiMo-Fe) on OER performance. The results of in-situ Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that MoO(4)(2-& nbsp;)can be easily dissolved into KOH electrolyte and re-adsorbed on surface of catalyst during OER processes, which delivers a promoting effect on OER performance. The dissolution of MoO(4)(2-& nbsp;)is beneficial for increasing the reconstruction degree of NiMo-Fe to form the active phase of NiFeOOH. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the re adsorbed MoO(4)(2-& nbsp;)is favorable for the adsorption of the OOH* intermediate, thus boosts the OER activity. As expected, the NiMo-Fe shows a superior electrocatalytic performance for OER, outperforming the pre-catalyst without Mo species. This finding enriches the knowledge of inactive-ion effect on alkaline OER performance and offers a path for developing efficient electrocatalysts.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000788161200002

However, their poor rechargeability and low efficiency remain critical barriers for practical applications. By using first-principles computations, we disclosed that NiFe2O4 has superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity for the decomposition of Li2O2. Guided by computations, we prepared a composite of NiFe2O4 and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through a hydrothermal route and applied it to Li-O-2 batteries. The batteries with NiFe2O4-CNT air cathodes displayed lower charging over-potential and better cycling performance than those with CNT air cathodes. The improved electrochemical performance was attributed to the high OER activity of NiFe2O4 for the decomposition of Li2O2.									44	4	0	0	1	0	46			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000378946700007

In this work, a three-dimensional (3D) porous nanoparticle Fe-NiTe2/Ni2P is presented, which exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity and excellent stability. Specifically, the OER activity of Fe-NiTe2/Ni2P requires only 190 mV overpotential at the current density of 10 mA cm-2, which is the first time the overpotential of tellurides gets within 200 mV. It is because the rough porous 3D structure leads to a large number of exposed active sites, allowing enough channels to release oxygen and perform mass exchange. In addition, Fe doping can modulate the electronic structure of the catalyst, accelerate the electron transfer, and thus improve the activity of the catalyst. The catalyst remained stable in 1 M KOH solution for 22 h, indicating that it has strong corrosion resistance. In this work, a simple, efficient, low-cost and corrosion resistant iron-doped transition metal telluride electrocatalyst has been synthesized, which provides a valuable way for the study of water electrolysis.

Characterization of oxygen evolution discontinuities in the light-response curves								PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS				10	44			6607	6614		10.1039/b809294j				2008	2008	In two previous papers (Fragata et al., J. Phys. Chem. B, 2005, 109, 14707-14714; Fragata et al., J. Phys. Chem. B, 2007, 111, 3315-3320), it was shown that the variation of oxygen evolution with the light intensity (I) in photosystem II ( PSII) in steady state conditions can be formulated according to the Langmuir adsorption isotherm for heterogeneous catalysis. This yielded the expression OEth = OEth(max) I/(L-1/2 + I), where OEth is the theoretical oxygen evolution, OEth( max) the maximum oxygen evolution, and L-1/2 the irradiance giving OEth(max)/2. In this approximation, the photons interaction with the chlorophylls in the PSII reaction center is assumed to be a heterogeneous reaction in which the light is represented as a stream of particles instead of an electromagnetic wave. That is, the chlorophyll molecules are the adsorption surfaces (or heterogeneous catalysts), and the incident (or exciting) photons are the substrate, or the reagent. Recently, the examination of new experimental data obtained with 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone (DCBQ) and p-benzoquinone (pBQ) as exogenous electron acceptors, disclosed the presence of oxygen evolution discontinuities ( or transitions) in the light-response curves. The new data were fitted with a mathematical summation of hyperbola of order n(i) > 1, OEth = Sigma(i) [OEth(max)](i) I (n(i))/[(L-1/2)(i)(n(i)) + I (n(i))], where the n(i)'s are the number of sites used by the incident photons in their interaction with the photosynthetic pigments in each population i of PSII centers open for photochemistry. The mathematical simulations yielded only three distinct n(i)'s, that is, 1.8, 4.8, 8.5 and 1.8, 4.2, 8.4 for isolated PSII particles incubated with DCBQ and pBQ, respectively. Implicitly, this means the simultaneous excitation of each PSII reaction center with more than one photon, that is, the excitation of more than one pigment molecule. It is suggested that these transitions have their origin in the cooperative interaction of the photons and the chlorophylls, and most likely also the pheophytins. This indicates that the discontinuities (or transitions) observed in the light-response curves of oxygen evolution are consistent with the hypothesis of photochemical cooperativity in photosystem II.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000260775400003	18989471

Currently, it is still challenging to develop cost-effective, highly efficient, and robust bifunctional catalysts for ZABs. Herein, a novel silver decorated cobalt carbonate (Ag@CoCO3) hybrid catalyst is proposed as the potential bifunctional catalyst to drive OER and ORR for ZABs. Engineering Ag nanoparticles onto the surface of CoCO3 microsphere not only facilitates the charge transfer, but also modulates the electronic structure, which are beneficial to intrinsic bifunctional activity. As a result, this Ag@CoCO3 catalyst yields a substantially enhanced bifunctionality compared to the pristine CoCO3 catalyst. Moreover, the homemade Ag@CoCO3 based ZABs provides a high peak power density of 146 mW cm(-2), superior to 107 mW cm(-2) for CoCO3 based ZABs and 111 mW cm(-2) for commercial Pt/C-IrO2 based ZABs.

The discovery of the high OER catalytic activity in Ni12P5 has attracted a great deal of attention recently. Herein, the microscopic mechanism of OER on the surface of Ni12P5 is studied using density functional theory calculations (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamics simulation (AIMD). Our results demonstrate that the H2O molecule is preferentially adsorbed on the P atom instead of on the Ni atom, indicating that the nonmetallic P atom is the active site of the OER reaction. AIMD simulations show that the dissociation of H from the H2O molecule takes place in steps; the hydrogen bond changes from O-a-HMIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSISOb to (OMIDLINE)-M-a HORIZONTAL ELLIPSISH-O-b, then the hydrogen bond breaks and an H+ is dissociated. In the OER reaction on nickel phosphides, the rate-determining step is the formation of the OOH group and the overpotential of Ni12P5 is the lowest, thus showing enhanced catalytic activity over other nickel phosphides. Moreover, we found that the charge of Ni and P sites has a linear relationship with the adsorption energy of OH and O, which can be utilized to optimize the OER catalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2079-4991		WOS:000781446600001	35407247

This paper reviews the new development of self-supported electrocatalysts in three categories: electrocatalysts growing on rigid substrates, electrocatalysts growing on soft substrates, and free-standing catalyst films. They are distinct and superior to the conventional powdery electrocatalysts, showing advantages in controllable nanostructure and chemical component, flexible electrode configuration, and outstanding catalytic performance. The self-supported electrocatalysts with various architectures like nanowire/plate/pillar arrays and porous films, composed of metals, metal oxides/selenides/phosphides, organic polymers, carbons and their corresponding hybrids, are presented and discussed. These catalysts exhibit high activity, durability and selectivity toward oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution, and/or hydrogen evolution reactions. The perspectives on the relevant areas are also proposed.									214	20	1	0	5	0	219			1369-7021	1873-4103		WOS:000377882400018

In this work, a homogeneously dispersed carbon-based cobalt/iron catalyst (Co/Fe-C) with abundant oxygen vacancies and favorable hydrophilicity is fabricated via a facile metal-polyphenol complexes strategy. The tannic acid (TA) and fulvic acid (FA) derived 0.3 Co/Fe-C catalysts show greatly similar morphologies, as well as the performance optimization process of electrocatalytic OER. Specifically, the TA-derived 0.3 Co/Fe-C catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 284 mV at 10 mA cm-2 for OER in alkaline electrolyte. Combined a series of characterization techniques suggest that abundant oxygen vacancies and favorable surface hydrophilicity can improve electronic conductivity of the catalyst and accelerate reactant adsorption and charge transfer rate on the catalyst surface, thus promoting OER activity of the catalysts. This study might provide a new perspective to construct advanced electrocatalysts with oxygen vacancies and hydrophilic surface for electrocatalytic applications.(c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Here, we propose a simple method to enhance the OER activity of NiFe LDH supported on Super P. The NiFe LDH@Super P catalyst with a nanoflower nanostructure was successfully synthesized via pre-hydrothermal treatment method, which ensures the normal nucleation process of the highly active NiFe LDH precursor and significantly promote the full contact of NiFe LDH and Super P in the three-dimensional space. The as synthesized NiFe LDH@Super P-2h sample exhibited excellent OER performances in alkaline media, and the overpotential is only 260 mV at a current density of 10 mA . cm-2. The outstanding OER electrocatalytic reaction performance is attributed to the unique three-dimensional nanoflower structure and excellent composite effect with Super P, which provides more specific surface areas and enables efficient transfer of electrons between them. This research work provides a simple and effective method for developing non-precious metal-based OER catalysts to replace expensive precious metal catalysts.					5th International Workshop on Advances in Energy Science and Environment Engineering (AESEE 2021)5th International Workshop on Advances in Energy Science and Environment Engineering (AESEE 2021)	9-11 April 20219-11 April 2021		Xiamen, ChinaXiamen, China	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2267-1242			INSPEC:20923141

In this study, we propose a novel strategy to improve the catalytic performance of CoO through the integration with the dotted carbon species and oxygen vacancies. We have successfully prepared carbon-dotted defective CoO with oxygen vacancies (CoO/C) by sintering the pink precursors obtained from the ethanol-mediated Co(Ac)(2)center dot 4H(2)O. In comparison with the commercial or oxygen-vacancies-only CoO, the cycling stability, the initial capacity, and the rate capability of CoO/C-catalyzed cathode have all been greatly enhanced, and the overpotential has also been decreased, which can be attributed to the synergetic effect of the dotted carbon species and oxygen vacancies on both ORR and OER. Oxygen vacancies can enhance the mobility of e(-) and Li+ and bind to O-2 and Li2O2 as active sites. The dotted carbon species not only improve the conductivity of CoO but also stabilize the oxygen vacancies during ORR/OER. In addition, our further investigation on the evolution of the morphology and phase composition of CoO/C and commercial CoO based cathodes under different charge/discharge states confirms that CoO/C can largely accelerate the formation and decomposition of Li2O2 during discharge charge cycles.									141	9	0	0	6	0	143			2155-5435			WOS:000367706800044

J	De Greef, RAT; Janssen, LJJ								Electrochemical dissolution of tin in methanesulphonic acid solutions								JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY				31	6			693	702						2001	2001	High-rate electroplating of tin on a moving steel strip is generally carried out in cells with dimensionally stable anodes. To obtain a matt tin deposit a concentrated acidic tin methanesulphonate solution containing a small concentration of sulphuric acid is used. The concentrated tin methanesulphonate solution is prepared by dissolution of tin particles with oxygen in a special column. To describe this dissolution process electrode reactions (namely, reduction of oxygen, hydrogen peroxide and hydrogen ions on a tin electrode and oxidation of tin) were studied using electrochemical techniques. It was concluded that on tin, oxygen is almost entirely reduced to water and that H2O2 cannot corrode tin directly, but its decomposition products, for instance oxygen, can. The exchange current density and the charge transfer coefficient for the investigated electrode reactions are estimated. The dissolution of tin by oxygen is determined by the kinetic parameters of the oxygen reduction reaction and by the mass transfer of (i) dissolved oxygen to and (ii) Sn-2+ ions from the tin electrode surface. Hydrogen evolution can be neglected during the dissolution of tin in the presence of oxygen. Moreover, it was found that the rate of tin corrosion increases with (i) increasing H+ concentration, (ii) oxygen concentration, (iii) convection intensity and (iv) temperature. It is likely that the tin surface is not covered with oxygen during corrosion in pure methanesulphonic acid solutions, but an oxide layer may be present on the tin surface during oxygen corrosion in pure sulphuric acid solutions. This oxide layer may hinder the oxygen corrosion of tin.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0021-891X			WOS:000169213200012

Non-precious transition metal oxides (TMOs) are attractive electrocatalysts for OER but usually suffer from relatively low intrinsic activity, poor electrical conductivity and inferior stability. In this current opinion article, recent design strategies for enhancing TMO-based OER electrocatalysts have been outlined including (i) nanostructuring for enhancing surface area and number of active sites, (ii) tuning catalyst composition and electronic structure for enhancing intrinsic activity of each site, (iii) hybridizing with catalyst support for enhancing conductivity, and stability, and (iv) hierarchical porous electrode architecture for enhancing OER efficiency.									25	1	0	0	2	0	25			2451-9103			WOS:000442800000005

Mechanistic Studies of the Oxygen Evolution Reaction by a Cobalt-Phosphate Catalyst at Neutral pH								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY				132	46			16501	16509		10.1021/ja106102b				NOV 24 2010	2010	The mechanism of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by catalysts prepared by electrodepositions from Co2+ solutions in phosphate electrolytes (Co-Pi) was studied at neutral pH by electrokinetic and O-18 isotope experiments. Low-potential electrodepositions enabled the controlled preparation of ultrathin Co-Pi catalyst films (<100 nm) that could be studied kinetically in the absence of mass transport and charge transport limitations to the OER. The Co-Pi catalysts exhibit a Tafel slope approximately equal to 2.3 x RT/F for the production of oxygen from water in neutral solutions. The electrochemical rate law exhibits an inverse first order dependence on proton activity and a zeroth order dependence on phosphate for [Pi] >= 0.03 M. In the absence of phosphate buffer, the Tafel slope is increased similar to 3-fold and the overall activity is greatly diminished. Together, these electrokinetic studies suggest a mechanism involving a rapid, one electron, one proton equilibrium between Co-III-OH and Co-IV-O in which a phosphate species is the proton acceptor, followed by a chemical turnover-limiting process involving oxygen-oxygen bond coupling.									919	32	1	0	110	0	927			0002-7863			WOS:000284792000041	20977209

In this work, the potential of utilizing the synthesized one-dimensional transition metal salen-type complexes (TM-SCs) as bi-functional electrocatalysts of ORR and OER is sys-tematically explored by computational screening approach. The results demonstrate that different types of macrocyclic ligands, including N2O2, N3O and N4 as donor groups around the active sites, govern the OER/ORR catalytic performances. Co-SCs with N2O2 ligands exhibit the highest bifunctional catalytic activities. In particular, low limiting over -potentials of 0.22 V for OER and 0.33 V for ORR can be observed on Co sites, which are even superior to those of noble metal catalysts. Analyzing the linear relationships between the adsorption strength of intermediates and the overpotentials shows that the origin of excellent electrocatalytic performance is the smaller slope (0.86) for OOH* vs OH* on TM-SCs compared to metal surfaces, resulting in strengthened binding of the OOH* interme-diate. Besides, the adsorption energies of the intermediates bound on Co-N2O2 are close to the ideal values, while too strong on the Co-N3O and Co-N4 catalysts. By applying external strains, the adsorption strengths of reaction intermediates can be further modulated due to the tunable d-band centers, and the resulting ORR/OER activities are further boosted. Considering that the Co salen-based chain has been synthesized experimentally, this work highlights the excellent electrocatalytic performances of this new material and devises novel strategy by straining for catalyst optimizations.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Therefore, searching for a high-yield method to fabricate advanced nanostructures and understanding their reactivity are challenging but urgent tasks. Here, rather than conventional liquid exfoliation, we report an electrochemical route for potentially large-scale production of ultrathin CoOOH nanosheets, which deliver exceptionally high OER activity. This nearly-all-surface material provides an excellent platform to study the surface chemistry for electrocatalytic activity. Combining operando X-ray spectroscopy and theoretical calculations demonstrated a potential-dependent deprotonation reaction, i.e., Co3+OOH is transformed into an active Co3+/4+OOH1-x phase for water oxidation under the applied potential. Comprehensive analysis suggested that reducing the deprotonation energy is the key to enhance the OER activity, and oxidized oxygen ions might act as electrophilic centers for the OER.									100	4	0	0	5	0	100			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000459741700022

Herein, for the first time, we present a novel heterostructure catalyst, constructed by ultrafine NiS/Fe3O4 heterostructural nanoparticles decorated on a carbon nanotube (CNT) matrix (NiS/Fe3O4 HNPs@CNT), which is synthesized by a facile hydrothermal reaction and subsequent sulfurization process. The NiS/Fe3O4 HNPs@CNT hybrid delivers superior OER activity in alkaline medium: it delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an ultralow overpotential of 243 mV with a small Tafel slope of 44.2 mV dec(-1), which outperforms the benchmark RuO2 electrocatalyst; moreover, it exhibits terrific long-term stability over 36 h without any noticeable performance decay. The exceptional OER performance can be attributed to the unique nanoarchitecture, high conductivity of the CNT matrix, and particularly, the interaction between the Ni and Fe species in NiS/Fe3O4 heterostructural nanoparticles. This work introduces a sensible nanoarchitecture design with a facile and novel fabrication strategy to attain nonprecious metal-based composite catalysts with high OER performance and outstanding long-term stability.									48	0	0	0	0	0	48			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000551488400048	32558533

Different hydrothermal conditions are explored in order to obtain the optimal hydrothermal carbon based cathode. Then a kind of one-step synthesis method of yeast based cathode is developed to simplify the experimental scheme. The yeast derived hydrothermal carbon is rich in various atoms including N, P, S, which could provide amounts of active sites for electrochemical reactions in the cathode. Another feature of the hydrothermal carbon based cathode is the mild preparation process in which there is no need of introduction of other surfactants and catalysts. This study is aimed to provide a feasible plan to utilize the biomass derived hydrothermal carbon with unique microstructures, higher heat value, higher carbon content, lower ash content as well as green and inexpensive access. A lithiumeoxygen battery with the cathode delivers a high capacity of 21,000 mAh g(-1) at 185 mA g(-1) in a 1 M LiTFSI/TEGDME electrolyte system. Moreover, the cathode exhibits a good oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction activity. These results suggest that the yeast derived hydrothermal carbon can be efficiently optimized for efficient electrocatalytic reactions in lithium eoxygen batteries. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The development of an inexpensive, highly active, and durable nonprecious-metal-based oxygen electrocatalyst is indispensable for emerging energy technologies, including anion exchange membrane fuel cells, metal-air batteries (MABs), water electrolyzers, etc. The activity of an oxygen electrocatalyst largely decides the overall energy storage performance of these devices. Although the catalytic activities of Pt and Ru/Ir-based catalysts toward an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are known, the high cost and lack of durability limit their extensive use for practical applications. This review article highlights the oxygen electrocatalytic activity of the emerging non-Pt and non-Ru/Ir oxygen electrocatalysts including transition-metal-based random alloys, intermetallics, metal-coordinated nitrogendoped carbon (M-N-C), and transition metal phosphides, nitrides, etc., for the development of an air-breathing electrode for aqueous primary and secondary zinc-air batteries (ZABs). Rational surface and chemical engineering of these electrocatalysts is required to achieve the desired oxygen electrocatalytic activity. The surface engineering increases the number of active sites, whereas the chemical engineering enhances the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. The encapsulation or integration of the active catalyst with undoped or heteroatom-doped carbon nanostructures affords an enhanced durability to the active catalyst. In many cases, the synergistic effect between the heteroatom-doped carbon matrix and the active catalyst plays an important role in controlling the catalytic activity. The ORR activity of these catalysts is evaluated in terms of onset potential, number of electrons transferred, limiting current density, and durability. The bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic activity and ZAB performance, on the other hand, are measured in terms of potential gap between the ORR and OER, Delta E = E-j10(OER) - E-1/2(ORR), specific capacity, peak power density, open circuit voltage, voltaic efficiency, and charge-discharge cycling stability. The nonprecious metal electrocatalyst-based ZABs are very promising and they deliver high power density, specific capacity, and round-trip efficiency. The active site for oxygen electrocatalysis and challenges associated with carbon support is briefly addressed. Despite the considerable progress made with the emerging electrocatalysts in recent years, several issues are yet to be addressed to achieve the commercial potential of rechargeable ZAB for practical applications.									31	0	0	0	1	0	31			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000693050200002	34424683

Therefore, seeking out a facile and cost-effective way to synthesize highly active and stable seawater-splitting catalysts is of great interest to both the research community and industry. Here we developed an Fe2+-driven, one-step, and spontaneous fabrication method for a seawater-oxygen-evolution-active NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) at room temperature. The NiFe LDH was found to exhibit very high activity and stability toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline natural seawater electrolyte, delivering current densities of 100 and 500 mA/cm(2) at low overpotentials of 247 and 296 mV, respectively, and with no significant degradation observed over long-term stability testing of 96 h under a large current density of 500 mA/cm(2) in 1 M KOH seawater electrolyte. After coupling with a good hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst, NiMoN, the two-electrode electrolyzer was found to achieve current densities of 10, 100, and 500 mA/cm(2) at voltages of 1.477, 1.533, and 1.665 V, respectively, in alkaline natural seawater with good durability over 100 h at 500 mA/cm(2). The oxidation of Fe2+ is the driving force for the growth of NiFe LDH, and this mechanism is universal to the fabrication of other Fe-based hydroxides as efficient OER catalysts.

In this study, a bimetallic/trimetallic ZIF nanosheets was successfully synthesized using 2-methylimidazole as an organic ligand. The 2D structure provided more active centres and better ion transfer passage, while the trimetallic structure increased the conductivity, which led to these ZIF nanosheets exhibiting a more active property, with an overpotential of 216 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 23.25 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH, and they also showed good stability under alkaline conditions.									57	8	0	0	1	0	58			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472566400031

For this reason, it has been deemed appropriate to present a critical review of the major and most recent contributions towards a fundamental understanding of what determines the OER electrocatalytic properties of a material. Furthermore, the technologies used to produce practical OER electrodes with top activities are assessed and the current benchmarks of performance are identified. Furthermore, results pertaining to our work on Raney-Ni gas diffusion anodes, which have been optimized in thickness and composition, are presented. An addition of 10 wt.% of a Co3O4 micrometric powder as co-catalyst (with Raney Ni-Fe) was found to enhance the polarization behavior and performance. The electrode so obtained achieves activities comparable with those of the best electrodes reported in the literature.Great emphasis has been placed in the analysis of the stability of the prepared Gas Diffusion Electrodes. Most of the GDEs were found to be stable in weeks long experiments with intermittent operation. The issue of integrating several functional layers (gas diffusion layer, active layer with current collector, separator layer) within a single, mechanically strong electrode assembly is briefly addressed.

The bifunctionality for oxygen electrocatalysis as shown by the OER-ORR potential difference (SE) could be reduced to as low as 0.87 V, comparable to the state-of-the-art non-noble bifunctional catalysts, when the Co(OH)(2) nanoplates were compounded with nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO). The good performance was attributed to the nanosizing of Co(OH)(2) and the synergistic interaction between Co(OH)(2) and N-rGO. A zinc air cell assembled with a Co(OH)(2)-air electrode also showed a performance comparable to that of the state-of-the-art zinc-air cells.

Developing earth-abundant heterogeneous electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity and stability is of great importance for achieving highly efficient water splitting. Here, an overview of the recent developments in the earth-abundant heterogeneous electrocatalysts for PEC water splitting is presented. The main earth-abundant electrocatalysts for the PEC hydrogen-evolution reaction (PEC-HER) include transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD)-based materials, transition-metal carbides/phosphatides, and N-doped graphene, whereas the earth-abundant PEC oxygen-evolution reaction (PEC-OER) electrocatalysts are focused on mixed transition-metal oxides, TMD-based materials, and transition-metal-and/or heteroatom-doped carbon catalysts. In addition, earth-abundant bifunctional (HER/OER) electrocatalysts, including NiFe layered double hydroxide and Co-Mn oxide nanoparticles/nitrogen-doped carbon frameworks, are introduced for overall water splitting. The strategies for improvement of the catalytic performance and the composition/structure-catalytic-activity relationships are highlighted. Finally, current existing challenges and the future research directions for enhancing the PEC water-splitting performance of earth-abundant heterogeneous electrocatalysts are provided.									105	9	0	0	3	0	106			2366-9608			WOS:000410930700001

The perovskite electrocatalyst crystal phase, surface morphology, and composition were examined by X-ray diffraction, a scanning electron microscope, and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping. The electrochemical investigations of the oxyhalides catalysts showed that the doping of F, Cl, or Br into the Sr2CoO4 parent oxide enhances the electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the onset potential as well as the potential required to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) shifting to lower potential values in the order of Sr2CoO4 (1.64, 1.73) > Sr2CoO3Br (1.61, 1.65) > Sr2CoO3Cl (1.53, 1.60) > Sr2CoO3F (1.50, 1.56) V vs. HRE which indicates that Sr2CoO3F is the most active electrode among the studied catalysts under static and steady-state conditions. Moreover, Sr2CoO3F demonstrates long-term stability and remarkably less charge transfer resistance (R-ct = 36.8 ohm) than the other oxyhalide counterparts during the OER. The doping of the perovskites with halide ions particularly the fluoride-ion enhances the surface oxygen vacancy density due to electron withdrawal away from the Co-atom which improves the ionic and electronic conductivity as well as the electrochemical activity of the oxygen evolution in alkaline solution.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2073-4344		WOS:000725499800001

However, the improvement of CuCo2S4 electrocatalytic activity has been a difficult problem owing to lack of effective electron transfer and ion transport. Herein, the unique structure connected CuCo2S4 nanosheets and carbon cloth (CC) with Fe2O3 nanoparticles to form CuCo2S4/Fe2O3/CC. Compared with CuCo2S4/CC, the resistances of electron transfer and ion transport were decreased by 65 and 84 %, respectively. The electrochemical surface area of CuCo2S4/Fe2O3/CC was 2.76 times larger than that of CuCo2S4/CC due to the high double-layer capacitance. For the oxygen evolution reaction, CuCo2S4/Fe2O3/CC could achieve an overpotential of 273 mV and a Tafel slope of 67 mV dec(-1) in alkaline solution.									2	1	0	0	0	0	2			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000594464700001	33150979

Hydrogen production from electric cracking water is the most effective and mature development method at present. Heterostructured electrocatalysts are favored due to their low overpotential, excellent assembly structure and good electron transfer ability. Consequently this paper reviews the development of heterogeneous electrocatalysts, the measurement parameters of electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and related research progress, and gives the hydrogen evolution mechanism in acidic, alkaline and neutral environments.

Here, a series of S-doped cobalt-based phosphate nanomaterials are synthesized through a simple co-precipitation process. It is found that the amorphous S-doped cobalt-iron phosphate (S-doped Co-Fe-Pi) nanosheets with an Co/Fe ratio of 6.9:1 can display the best electrochemical activity for OER, requiring an overpotential of only 273 mV to drive the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1M KOH. As a highly efficient catalyst, both the structure features and the electrocatalytic performance of S-doped Co-Fe-Pi catalysts are discussed in this work. More importantly, the OER performance of the catalysts affected by thiophosphate anions and Fe incorporated cations is investigated. Finally, it is suggested that the outstanding activity can be attributed to not only the porous nanostructure existing in amorphous morphology, but also the proper electronic state of Co atoms induced by the decoration of Fe and S atoms.

To promote electrocatalytic conversion efficiency of fuel cells and water splitting devices, high-performance electrocatalysts are necessary to reduce kinetic barriers in hydrogen and oxygen reactions.

The chemical traps 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran and rubrene are used to monitor singlet oxygen production in organic solvents through the O-2 [(3)Sigma(-)(g)] -> O-2 [(1)Delta(g)] transition. In this Letter evolution of the trap concentration is monitored continuously and we propose a new and simple method to measure singlet oxygen production rate. We derive an analytical expression for the trap disappearance rate that allows simultaneous and independent determination of the 1270 nm absorption cross section and the half quenching concentration with the chemical trap.

The process is based on the direct reaction between iron group metals (Fe, Co, Ni) and carbon source, which are facilely get high purity carbide nanocrystals (NCs) and avoid any other impurity at relatively low temperature. The M3C-GNRs exhibit superior enhanced electrocatalystic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), including low Tafel slope (39, 41, and 45 mV dec(-1) for Fe3C-GNRs, Co3C-GNRs, and Ni3C-GNRs, respectively), positive onset potential (similar to 0.8 V), high electron transfer number (similar to 4), and long-term stability (no obvious drop after 20 000 s test).

Powder-based semiconductor photocatalysts, in particular, have tremendous potential in cost mitigation due to system simplicity and scalability. The control and implementation of powder-based photocatalysts are, in reality, quite complex. The identification of the semiconductorphotocatalytic activity relationship and its limiting factor has not been fully solved in any powder-based semiconductor photocatalyst. In this work, we present systematic and quantitative evaluation of photocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen evolution using a model strontium titanate powder/aqueous solution interface in a half reaction. The electron density was controlled from 10(16) to 1(02)0 cm(3) throughout the strontium titanate powder by charge compensation with oxygen nonstoichiometry (the amount of oxygen vacancy) while maintaining its crystallinity, chemical composition, powder morphology, and the crystal and electronic structure of the surface. The photocatalytic activity of hydrogen evolution from aqueous methanol solution was stable and enhanced by 40-fold by the electron doping. The enhancement was correlated well with increased Delta absorbance, an indication of prolonged lifetime of photoexcited electrons, observed by transient absorption spectroscopy. Photocatalytic activity of oxygen evolution from aqueous silver nitrate solution was also enhanced by 3-fold by the electron doping. Linear correlation was found between the photocatalytic activity and the degree of surface band bending, Delta Phi, above 1.38 V. The band bending, potential downhill for electronic holes, enlarges the total flux of photoexcited holes toward the surface, which drives the oxygen evolution reaction.									27	1	0	0	1	0	27			2155-5435			WOS:000441112400039

However, trial-and-error routes are usually used to search for better catalysts from multi-doped complex material systems, and establishing design principles or intrinsic descriptors would accelerate the discovery of new efficient catalysts. Here, a descriptor based on p(z)-orbitals of active sites is proposed to describe the catalytic performance of dual-/tri-element-doped graphene catalysts for the ORR and the OER. In addition to multiple doping, the established descriptor is universal in nature and can also predict the contributions of defects and edges or their combinations. The prediction capacity of the descriptor is further enhanced by introducing a correction factor based on crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) analysis, which reveals the differences between the adsorption mechanism of edged C and graphitic C on graphene. The predictions are consistent with DFT calculations and experimental results. This work provides a powerful tool for rapidly screening multi-doped complex material systems for the desired ORR and OER bifunctional catalysts.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000574599500034	32945308

In an effort to overcome these barriers, robust and highly active FeNi@NCNTs nanowire arrays are rationally synthesized on carbon cloth which directly serves as an integrated air-electrode for zinc-air batteries. FeNi@NCNTs/CC shows excellent bifunctional electrochemical performances toward oxygen reduction reaction (onset potential = 0.95 V, half-wave potential = 0.77 V vs RHE) and oxygen evolution reaction (eta = 252 mV@10 mA cm(-2)), and exhibits excellent stability after being tested for more than 720 hours. More importantly, flexible solid-state rechargeable Zn-air batteries directly equipped with the FeNi@NCNTs/CC air-cathode are demonstrated to exhibit a high discharge voltage (approximate to 1.0 V@2 mA cm(-2)) and a low charge voltage (approximate to 1.65 V@2 mA cm(-2)), along with an excellent mechanical and cycling stability (voltage gap increased approximate to 0.03 V after 200 cycles). The novel designed air-cathode and simple methodology for flexible solid-state rechargeable Zn-air batteries contribute valuable enlightenment toward the development of emerging portable electronics in practice.									57	6	0	0	0	0	59			2196-7350			WOS:000431960200006

In recent years, microbes have been explored as novel precursors to synthesize carbon-based (nano)materials and as substrates or templates to produce carbon-containing (nano)composites. Being greener and more affordable, microbe-derived carbons (MDCs) offer good potential for energy applications. In this review, we describe the unique advantages of MDCs and outline the common procedures to prepare them. We also extensively discuss the energy applications of MDCs including their use as electrodes in supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries, and as electrocatalysts for processes such as oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution, and hydrogen evolution reactions which are essential for fuel cell and water electrochemical splitting cells. Based on the literature trend and our group's expertise, we propose potential research directions for developing new types of MDCs. This review, therefore, provides the state-of-the-art of a new energy chemistry concept. We expect to stimulate future research on the applications of MDCs that may address energy and environmental challenges that our societies are facing.

However, bubbles produced during water electrolysis add to capital and operational costs, due to blocking of the electrode surface and the necessary use of pumps and gas-liquid separators in electrolyser systems. Here 'bubble-free' electrocatalytic oxygen evolution from water was studied using a gas diffusion electrode that extracted oxygen as it was evolved, before bubbles were formed. The electrode comprised a gas-generating catalyst-binder layer, a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) interlayer, and a gas-extracting expanded PTFE (ePTFE) membrane (Gore-Tex (R)). Electrode properties between 20-60 degrees C, and with excess pressure on the alkaline electrolyte (<= 80 kPa), were examined using detailed electrochemical measurements and video recordings. Electrochemical signal drift (dV/dt) was developed as a sensitive probe of bubble formation. 'Breathability', or the capacity for evolved oxygen to be directly extracted without forming bubbles, correlated with performance, and improved with temperature. A significant decline in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activation energy with temperature was also observed. Bubble-free operation proceeded through the transportation of gas along a continuous network of hydrophobic, 'aerophilic' PTFE surfaces. The further development of bubble-free electrodes ought to permit revolutionary, low-cost electrolyser designs, adding impetus to the creation of a future hydrogen economy.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2398-4902			WOS:000616375400017

For this, Cl -sufficient membranes and low-Cl- membranes were used. The presence of Cl- in the reaction medium did accelerate oxygen evolution, which remained unaffected by heat treatment up to 40 degrees C in PSII membranes and up to 42.5 degrees C in thylakoids. Heat resistance of Cl--induced activation of oxygen evolution was found to be independent of the presence of `bound Cl-' in the preparations. However, the functional stability of the PSII complex during heat treatment showed a marked dependence on the presence of bound Cl- in PSII. Electron paramagnetic resonance study of manganese (Mn) release per reaction center/YD+ showed that there was little loss of Mn (2+) up to 42 degrees C in our preparations, although the PSII activity was significantly lowered. These observations together with data from steady state chlorophyll a fluorescence imply that the site of action of Cl- causing direct activation of oxygen evolution was different from the site of primary heat damage. A differential response of chloride binding sites to heat stress was observed. The high-affinity ( tightly bound, slow exchanging) site of chloride is affected earlier (similar to 37 similar to C) while low-affinity loosely bound, fast exchanging) site gets affected at higher temperatures ( 42.5 similar to C in thylakoids and 40 degrees C in the case of PSII-enriched membranes).									7	0	0	0	7	0	7			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000248913300012	17340213

Nanocarbon materials, as a promising alternative to replace the state-of-theart noble metal electrocatalysts, have attracted much interest, whereas the balance of the defect engineering and electric conductivity for them is still challenging. This work reports a discrete CoOx nanoparticles (CoO(x)NPs) situated in N-doped graphitic carbon nanorings (CoOx@NGCR), featuring graphitic but defect-rich characteristics, through a facile process of hydrothermal synthesis and subsequent high-temperature pyrolysis with in situ catalytic graphitization. The synergy arising from defect engineering and enhanced electric conductivity as well as hollow ring-shaped nanostructure of the fabricated CoOx@NGCR significantly boost the electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline system. CoOx@NGCR exhibits extraordinary ORR activity in terms of the positive onset potential (0.91 V), half-wave potential (0.80 V), and large limiting current density (4.9 mA cm(-2)), even comparable to those of the Pt/C benchmark. Furthermore, CoOx@NGCR shows impressive performance for OER along with robust durability. High bifunctional activity and excellent stability of CoOx@NGCR are further confirmed in an assembled Zn-air battery with a high power density and long-time operation stability, revealing great potential in practical applications.									29	6	0	0	1	0	29			2168-0485			WOS:000449577200240

NiFe hydroxide offers efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis in alkaline electrolyte, however weak binding of oxygenated intermediates on NiFe hydroxide still badly limits its catalytic activity. Now, a facile ball-milling method was developed to enhance binding strength of NiFe hydroxide to oxygenated intermediates via generating tensile strain, which reduced the anti-bonding filling states in the d orbital and thus facilitated oxygenated intermediates adsorption. The NiFe hydroxide with tensile strain increasing after ball-milling exhibits an OER onset potential as low as 1.44 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) and requires only a 270 mV overpotential to reach a water oxidation current density of 10 mA cm(-2).									202	15	0	0	13	0	204			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000455033700011	30461141

The Calcium cobaltite (CCO) crystallizes in a layered structure with alternate rock salt (RS) type arrangement and CoO2 layer stacked along the c axis having monoclinic symmetry with a mis-fit between RS and CoO2 layer along the b axis. Rietveld refinement confirms the formation of the similar crystal structure with no impurity phases for all the doped composites. XPS and FTIR data reveal that at an initial stage, Mo enters RS structure and at higher concentrations of doping Mo may exist in both the layers. Multivalent Mo acts as an electron dopant that reduces hole concentration resulting in an increase in seebeck coefficient (S).

Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of flower-like Mo3S4/Co1-xS composites on Co foil (Mo3S4/Co1-xS@CF) as high-performance electrochemical water-splitting catalysts in an alkaline environment. The flower-like array structure of Mo3S4/Co1-xS@CF not only increases the electrochemically active surface area of the catalyst, but also facilitates the release of bubbles generated, resulting in enhanced catalytic activity. For the hydrogen evolution reaction, the Mo3S4/Co1-xS@CF electrode exhibits good stability and excellent catalytic activity in 1.0 M KOH (eta(10) = 105 mV), 1.0 M PBS (eta(10) = 92 mV) and 0.5 M H2SO4 (eta(10) = 68 mV) solutions. For the oxygen evolution reaction, the electrode displays excellent stability and catalytic activity in 1.0 M KOH solution (eta(10) = 215 mV). When used for overall water splitting in 1.0 M KOH solution, Mo3S4/Co1-xS@CF achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low potential of 1.58 V and maintains it stably for 40 h. This study presents a simple method for preparing transition metal-based bimetallic composite catalysts for efficient hydrogen production. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Fe2P , Co2P, N and P modified carbon material(Fe/Co/P-NPs) was obtained by phosphating reaction with Fe/Co-MOF as metal and carbon sources. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) , transmission electron microscopy (TEM) , X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction analysis ( XRD) were employed to characterize the morphology and structure of the materials. The electrocatalytic activity and stability of the materials were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). It is found that Fe/Co/P-NPs display good catalytic activity in oxygen evolution reaction, with over potentials of 270 and 300 mV to deliver 10 mA/cm(2) and 100 mA/cm(2) current density , respectively , proving the better activity than that of RuO2.

After mining, the coal body is exposed to oxygen, and the oxidation reaction results in significant changes in the micro-structure of the oxidized coal body. To understand the change process, in this paper, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy are employed to test a coal body subjected to flow of hot gas. The evolution patterns of the coal oxidation micro-structure under different temperatures and oxygen conditions are compared and analysed. The results show that in an environment with oxygen, as the temperature increases, the stacking height (L-c) of the coal macromolecular lattice follows an overall increasing trend and has a self-repair capability. During oxidation, the spatial arrangement of the evolution of the coal molecular structure is reversible. In an environment without oxygen, the hydroxyl (-OH) peak height and peak area exceed those of an environment with oxygen, which suggests that the -OH group facilitates coal oxidation. Coal functional groups under high-temperature fracture polymerize constantly, and oxidation produces new functional groups.									28	3	0	0	1	0	30			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000500155800018

Here we report a low-Ir core-shell OER electrocatalyst consisting of an intermetallic IrGa (IrGa-IMC) core and a partially oxidized Ir (IrOx) shell. In acidic electrolytes, the IrGa-IMC@IrOx core-shell catalysts exhibit a low overpotential of 272 mV at 10 mA center dot cm(-2) with Ir loading of similar to 20 mu g center dot cm(-2) and a mass activity of 841 A center dot g(Ir)(-1) at 1.52 V, which is 3.6 times greater than that of commercial Ir/C (232 A center dot g(Ir)(-1)) catalyst. We understand by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations that the enhanced OER activity of the IrGa-IMC@IrOx catalysts is ascribed to the lifted degeneracy of Ir 5d electron of surface IrOx sites induced by the intermetallic IrGa core, which increases the adsorption capacity of IrOx layer for O and OH binding and eventually lowers the energy barrier of the OER rate-determining steps.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000690826200002

The construction of photoanodes that appreciably enhance the efficiency of this process is of vital technological importance towards solar fuel synthesis. In this work, Mo-modified BiVO4 (Mo:BiVO4), a promising water splitting photoanode, was modified with various oxygen evolution catalysts in two distinct configurations, with the catalysts either deposited on the surface of Mo:BiVO4 or embedded inside a Mo:BiVO4 film. The investigated catalysts included monometallic, bimetallic, and trimetallic oxides with spinel and layered structures, and nickel boride (NixB). In order to follow the influence of the incorporated catalysts and their respective properties, as well as the photoanode architecture on photoelectrochemical water oxidation, the fabricated photoanodes were characterised for their optical, morphological, and structural properties, photoelectrocatalytic activity with respect to evolved oxygen, and recombination rates of the photogenerated charge carriers. The architecture of the catalyst-modified Mo:BiVO4 photoanode was found to play a more decisive role than the nature of the catalyst on the performance of the photoanode in photoelectrocatalytic water oxidation. Differences in the photoelectrocatalytic activity of the various catalyst-modified Mo:BiVO4 photoanodes are attributed to the electronic structure of the materials revealed through differences in the Fermi energy levels. This work thus expands on the current knowledge towards the design of future practical photoanodes for photoelectrocatalytic water oxidation.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000533830300003

Despite great merits, both of these reactions require robust electrocatalysts for lowering the overpotential and promoting their practical applications in energy conversion and storage devices. Although, noble metal-based catalysts (especially Pt-based catalysts) are at the forefront in boosting the ORR and HER kinetics, high cost, limited availability, and poor stability in harsh redox conditions make them unfit for scalable use. To this end, various strategies including downsizing the catalyst size, reducing the noble metal, and increasing metal utilization have been adopted to appropriately balance the performance and economic issues. This mini-review presents an overview of the current state of the technological advancements in noble metal-based heterogeneous nanocatalysts (NCs) for both ORR and HER applications. More specifically, we focused on establishing the structure-performance correlation.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14				2076-3417		WOS:000589071700001

Recently, cobalt oxide spinel catalysts have shown promising visible-light-driven water oxidation activities. Although some efforts have been made to understand the role of the spinel structure in photocatalytic oxygen evolution from water, the underlying correlation is still unclear. Here, we have successfully synthesized a series of metal-substituted Co3O4 catalysts using a hard templating method and investigated their photocatalytic properties for water oxidation. Findings from this study suggest that Ni3+/4+ and Mn3+/4+ substitution create surface sites which bind oxygen too strongly or too weakly relative to Co3+, respectively, therefore decreasing oxygen evolution rates in the visible-light-driven [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+)-persulfate system. On the other hand, mesoporous Mg-substituted Co3O4 exhibit very limited oxygen evolution activity in the first 2 min of reaction; while a high turnover frequency (TOF) of similar to 1.6 x 10(-4) s(-1) per Co was observed after 30 min of photocatalysis. Detailed structural analysis has been done to reveal the mechanism of Mg-Co3O4 activation and the relationship to structural properties in metal-substituted Co3O4 oxygen evolution catalysts.

Among the two half reactions of electrochemical water splitting, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is highly desirable yet challenging to prepare a cost effective and viable electrocatalyst to boost the OER activity. Herein, we have prepared a novel electrocatalyst, CoOx-CoP/N-CNTs, by the phosphidization of cobalt oxides (CoOx) encapsulated N- doped carbon nanotubes (CoOx/N-CNTs). The CoOx/N-CNTs composite is derived via pyrolysis of cobalt based zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF-12) at 950 degrees C under argon atmosphere. The CoOx/N-CNTs is phosphidized at various temperatures ranging from 320 degrees C to 400 degrees C. The optimized temperature to attain the best catalytic activity is 380 degrees C. The phosphatized material, CoOx-CoP/N-CNTs, shows superior performance towards OER with an overpotential of 250 mV @ 20 mAcm(-2) vs 532 mV @ 20 mAcm(-2) of unphosphidized material, CoOx/N-CNTs, which shows significant effect of phosphidization. The maximum current density of 160 mAcm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution is achieved. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we develop a novel monoclinic ABO(4)-type metal oxide as versatile candidate for high performance OER catalysis. It has a flexible multi-metal composition and tunable structure which can rationally optimize the OER catalytic activities of ABO(4)-type oxide. Remarkably, the obtained single-crystal Ee(0.4)Co(0.6)Wo(0.6)O(4) shows an excellent OER catalytic activity with an overpotential of 276.4 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), as well as an ultra-low Tafel slope of 30.9 mV decade(-1), which outperforms that of the state-of-the-art RuO2 electrocatalyst. Mechanism analysis by density functional theory calculations confirms that the octahedral A sites with low valence state can serve as the active sites in ABO(4)-type oxide for OER. In addition, faster charge transfer occurs in the low spin state of Co2+ sites (LS: t(2g)(6) e(g)(1)), in which the formation of O* from OH* as the rate-determining step in OER can be accelerated for favorable OER. More importantly, the new monoclinic ABO(4)-type material presented in this work is significantly different from the known spinel and perovskite oxides and may pioneer a new wave of research as efficient electrocatalysts and energy materials.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000663706600002

The use of metal-organic framework (MOF) catalysts after postprocessing is an important method to optimize catalytic activity; however, little attention has been paid to the transformation of the electronic structure and coordinated ions under operando conditions. Here, we focus on a Prussian blue analogue (PBA) with the formula Na2Co2+[Fe2+(CN)(6)]center dot nH(2)O after postprocessing at a temperature of 400 degrees C. The catalysts exhibit a significant improvement in the OER activity with an overpotential of 254 mV against 320 mV for the initial PBA at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. Our ex situ soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) results demonstrate that some of the high-spin Co2+ and low-spin Fe2+ ions of PBA exhibit exchange with N and C ligands. Our fast operando hard XAS study revealed a dynamic evolution process of the transformation of ligands from N(C) in the initial Na2Co[Fe(CN)(6)]center dot nH(2)O to oxygen and the formation of pure low-spin Co3+ oxide and high-spin Fe3+ oxide after OER. The amorphous (Co,Fe)OOH chemical state was identified as the catalytically active state based on our operando X-ray spectroscopy results. The results of this study provide insights into a dynamic evolution process of MOFs after postprocessing and the formation of real active sites during electrocatalysis.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000773693300039

Although Ru-based mixed metal oxides have long been used as CER catalysts, they suffer from a selectivity problem due to the competing oxygen evolution reaction. To overcome this shortcoming, we have developed a new CER catalyst composed of atomically dispersed Pt-N-4 sites on carbon nanotubes (Pt-1/CNT). In this study, we demonstrate that the catalytically active Pt-N4 sites can be constructed from H2PtCl6 center dot 6H(2)O and an ionic liquid via a bottom-up approach and a Pt-porphyrin-driven top-down method. Both catalysts exhibit excellent CER activity and remarkable selectivity, demonstrating the general efficacy of Pt-1/CNT for the CER. The electrochemical and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy analyses reveal that Pt1/CNT catalysts show a reaction order of similar to 1.8 in the low overpotential regime, where the Volmer step is reconciled with the rate-determining step (RDS). Interestingly, in the high overpotential region, the CER over Pt-1/CNT proceeds with a lower reaction order and the RDS switches to the Heyrovsky step. These unprecedented kinetic insights are clearly distinguished from the oxide-based CER catalysts with the opposite sequence of the RDS.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000704700800040

In particular, the role of hydrogen in near-neutral pH SCC has remained unknown. In this work, cyclic voltammetry was used to comprehensively investigate the fundamentals of the electrochemical corrosion reactions occurring at the steel/solution interface in diluted, 5% CO2/N-2-purged, near-neutral pH bicarbonate solutions. It is shown that there is no stable oxide film formed on the steel surface in near-neutral pH solution. The dissolution-based cracking mechanism does not apply for near-neutral pH SCC of pipelines. The formation of a metastable Fe(OH)(2) deposit layer shows a catalytic activity on hydrogen evolution reaction, indicating that a significant amount of hydrogen could be generated under near-neutral pH condition. The presence of corrosive anions in the soil electrolyte enhances both the anodic polarization of the steel and the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction, resulting in an increased hydrogen evolution rate. The introduction of oxygen could form a stable oxide film on the surface of steel, resulting in the loss of the surface catalytic effect on hydrogen evolution reaction. Thus, a hydrogen-based mechanism does not apply for SCC in the presence of oxygen. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									88	16	0	0	1	1	97			0169-4332			WOS:000249248100012

We studied the factors that influenced the synthesis of the oxygen-evolution catalyst (electrolyte environment temperature, silver ion concentration, concentration of carbonates) under mild conditions. The structure, morphology, composition, and catalytic activity of Ag-C-i catalyst were analyzed using techniques such as X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electrochemical measurements. Our results showed that the diffraction peaks of the Ag-C-i catalysts synthesized at 70 degrees C were consistent with the Ago phase and that the catalytic composition of the Ag-C-i catalyst was the (AgO)-O-I/(AgO)-O-II redox couple. The oxygen-evolution rate of the catalyst synthesized in a carbonate solution (pH = 8.3) at 70 degrees C was 50 times higher than that synthesized at 5 degrees C (18.3 mu mol h(-1)); additionally, its oxygen evolution overpotential decreased to 246.7 mV. The electrolyte solution and Ag+ ion concentration greatly impacted the catalytic activity of the Ag-C-i catalyst for water splitting. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The atomic FeNi SAs/NC catalyst displays high onset potential (0.98 V) and half-wave potential (0.84 V) for the ORR, as well as, low overpotential of (270 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER. The density functional theory calculations indicate that the Fe site as the active center can facilitate the four-electron reaction process, while Ni sites regulate the electronic structure of Fe sites and further reduce the energy barrier of the rate-determining step. In addition, the nitrogen-doped carbon matrix prevents the metal atoms from aggregation and corrosion, leading to the improvement of catalyst durability. As a proof of concept, flexible quasi-solid-state zinc- and aluminum-air batteries assembled with the FeNi SAs/NC catalyst exhibit superior peak power densities and discharging specific capacities outperforming the commercial Pt/C. This work provides rational guidance for the synthesis of bifunctional electrocatalysts in next-generation energy devices for flexible consumer electronics.									80	3	0	0	6	0	80			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000663377300001

Here, we combine 2D TMOHs with 1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to construct a mutually interpenetrated hybrid structure, in which the CNT network acts as a porous conductive skeleton and the TMOH sheets behave as a bifunctional catalytic substrate to deposit discharge product effectively. Such a collective function results in superior properties when serving as a lithium-oxygen cathode, exhibiting long cycle life of 300 cycles under areal capacity limit of 0.5 mAh cm(-2), and 178 cycles (similar to 1400 hours) even at 2 mAh cm(-2). Our mixed-dimensional hybrid electrodes offer a promising route in developing high performance electrochemical catalysis and energy storage systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2405-8297			WOS:000836432000001

Up until now, the generation of these HEMG NPs involved tedious synthesis procedures where the generated particles were only available on highly specialized supports, which limited their widespread use. Hence, more flexible synthetic approaches to obtain colloidal HEMG NPs for applications in energy conversion and storage are highly desirable. We utilized pulsed laser ablation of bulk high entropy alloy targets in acetonitrile to generate colloidal carbon-coated CrCoFeNiMn and CrCoFeNiMnMo HEMG NPs. An in-depth analysis of the structure and elemental distribution of the obtained nanoparticles down to single-particle levels using advanced transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) methods revealed amorphous quinary and senary alloy phases with slight manganese oxide/hydroxide surface segregation, which were stabilized within graphitic shells. Studies on the catalytic activity of the corresponding carbon-HEMG NPs during oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions revealed an elevated activity upon the incorporation of moderate amounts of Mo into the amorphous alloy, probably due to the defect generation by atomic size mismatch. Furthermore, we demonstrate the superiority of these carbon-HEMG NPs over their crystalline analogies and highlight the suitability of these amorphous multi-elemental NPs in electrocatalytic energy conversion.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000691639200001

Its perienteric fluid contains an octameric haemoglobin(1-3) that binds oxygen nearly 25,000 times more tightly than does human haemoglobin(4,5). Despite numerous investigations, the biological function of this molecule has remained elusive. The distal haem pocket contains a metal, oxygen and thiol(6), all of which are known to be reactive with nitric oxide. Here we show that Ascaris haemoglobin enzymatically consumes oxygen in a reaction driven by nitric oxide, thus keeping the perienteric fluid hypoxic. The mechanism of this reaction involves unprecedented chemistry of a haem group, a thiol and nitric oxide. We propose that Ascaris haemoglobin functions as a 'deoxygenase', using nitric oxide to detoxify oxygen. The structural and functional adaptations of Ascaris haemoglobin suggest that the molecular evolution of haemoglobin can be rationalized by its nitric oxide related functions.									181	3	1	0	154	3	191			0028-0836			WOS:000082981200061	10519555

Herein, we develop a three-dimension (3D) heterostructured catalyst (Ni0.82Co0.18O@C/NF) by coupling of ultrathin Co-doped NiO (Ni0.82Co0.18O) nanosheets and carbon on nickel foam (NF) with synergism of geometric engineering and electronic modulation. Benefiting from the unique 3D configuration, highly exposed active sites and the synergistic effect of the active Ni0.82Co0.18O and the carbon, the catalyst exhibits exceptional hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with low overpotentials and Tafel slopes and excellent stability in alkaline media. Specifically, the NNi0.82Co0.18O@C/NF employed as catalyst for both anode and cathode enables an alkaline electrolyzer to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) by a cell voltage of only 1.42 V, which is not only much lower than that of the integrated performance of the commercial noble Pt/C and IrO2/C catalyst couple (similar to 1.61 V), but also superior to most reported results to date. Our finding may provide a new opportunity to design advanced bifunctional catalysts toward practical overall water splitting.									63	2	0	0	7	0	64			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000469906200023

Photo-brightening and reversible photoluminescence quenching are observed in PEA(2)SnI(4) film at ultralow oxygen concentration (< 1.5 vol%). In the case of 1.5 vol% < [O-2] < 21 vol%, the photoluminescence emission of PEA(2)SnI(4) film can be partially recovered after resetting the samples to nitrogen box. As the oxygen concentration further increases with the range of 21 to 95 vol%, the photoluminescence emission of PEA(2)SnI(4) film is significantly quenched and can only be slightly recovered after removing it to the nitrogen box. By correlating the material characterizations and theoretical analysis, the interactions between PEA(2)SnI(4) and oxygen contain physisorption and chemical reactions are illustrated. Depending on the oxygen concentration, the chemical reactions between PEA(2)SnI(4) and oxygen can be reversible and/or irreversible. The insights into oxygen concentration effects provide a guideline to optimize the stability of PEA(2)SnI(4) for achieving high-performance optoelectronic devices.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000704237700001

The reaction was performed at 350 degrees C in a glass reactor, with a dry-ice cold trap and a recirculation pump. The reactor was connected to a mass spectrometer for on-line gas analysis. It has been checked that oxygen isotopic heteroexchange did not occur at a significant rate. The changes with reaction time of the O-18 isotopic labelling shows that only lattice oxygen is active for the formation of MA and the other products. For MA, this conclusion has been further confirmed by comparing the experimental evolution of the isotopic distribution (amu 98, 100, 102 and 104) with calculated mass spectra assuming a progressive replacement of lattice O-16 by O-18 in agreement with a redox mechanism. When the steady-state O-18 labelling of products is achieved, the oxygen balance indicates the presence of O-18 within a few surface layers of the catalyst. This result has been further confirmed by post-reaction analysis using low energy ion spectroscopy, providing a direct evidence of both O-18 and O-16 on the surface.									38	2	0	0	0	0	39			0920-5861			WOS:A1997WF26200003

HER and OER electrocatalysts usually require very different pH values to keep them stable and active. Thus, the development of earth-abundant nonprecious metal catalysts for both HER and OER is of great importance to practical applications. This work reports the results of integrated water electrolysis using the hybrids of electrospun La-0.5(Ba0.4Sr0.4Ca0.2)(0.5)Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (L-0.5) perovskite nanorods attached to reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets as bifunctional electrodes. Via rationalizing the composition and morphology of L-0.5/rGO nano-hybrids, excellent catalytic performance and stability toward OER and HER are achieved in alkaline media. The operating voltage of integrated L-0.5/rGO electrolyzer is tested to be 1.76 V at 50 mA cm(-2), which is close to that of the commercially available IrO2/C-Pt/C couple (1.76 V @ 50 mA cm(-2)). Such a bifunctional electrocatalyst could be extended toward practical electrolysis use with low expanse and high efficiency. More generally, the protocol described here broadens our horizons in terms of the designs and the diverse functionalities of catalysts for use in various applications.									99	5	0	0	7	0	100			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000413695300011

In this paper, the research progress of single-atom electrocatalysts on multiple energy conversion reactions over recent years is reviewed. The discussion begins with a background on the various types of single -atom electrocatalysts (SAECs). The paper then conducts a review of synthetic methods that use the latest microscopic and spectroscopic techniques to control atom dispersal and atomic decomposition charac-terization of metal sites. In view of the wide application of SAECs, the electrocatalytic study of SAECs was analyzed from the perspective of important electrochemical reactions such as ORR (oxygen reduc-tion reaction), HER (hydrogen evolution reaction), OER (oxygen evolution reaction), CO2RR (carbon (IV) oxide reduction reaction) and NRR (nitrogen reduction reaction). A variety of successful attempts are ex-emplified to describe the catalytic synthetic strategies, characterization, and electrocatalysis applications. Finally, we identify challenges, and suggest future directions for nonprecious-metal SAECs within the bur-geoning sector. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Since the last few decades finding alternatives for state-of-the-art catalysts such as IrO2 and RuO2 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and platinum for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has been a major challenge in the field of water electrolysis. To replace such precious metals, many efforts have been made to develop transition metal based bifunctional catalyst for alkaline water electrolysis. Among them, transition metal phosphides (TMPs) show superior activity in both OER and HER with varying pH conditions. Moreover, the different phases of phosphides, P-rich or P deficient metal composites (Ni/Co-P) offer a great opportunity in total water splitting (TWS) applications. There is no detailed review in the literature outlining the possible combinations, synthesis methods and morphologies of Ni and Co based phosphides. Based on the above shortage about TMPs as a bi-functional catalyst for water electrolysis, this review summarizes the activity and stability Ni and Co phosphides. Furthermore, the review highlights monometallic phosphides such as NiP and CoP, bi-metallic phosphides such as NiCoP, and the synergistic effect of doping Fe into NiP/CoP or Fe -NiCoP systems while detailing their preparation methods. Overall, this review extends the role of designing Ni and Co phosphides for efficient large scale electrocatalysis of hydrogen production.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2196-0216			WOS:000710771500001

The main goal of the presented work is to investigate the influence of SHMP as an electrolyte additive on the performance of the lead-acid batteries. To achieve the point, the examinations are done in two separate ways: i) Investigation electrochemical behavior of lead alloy electrode, by studying Hydrogen and Oxygen Evolution Reaction (HER and OER) with electrochemical techniques including; Cyclic Voltammetry and Linear Sweep Voltammetry. Then, Scan of Electron Microscopy (SEM performed to study the surface of the electrode after electrochemical treatments. By increasing SHMP concentration, overpotential of hydrogen and oxygen evolution is increased due to improving particle size of PbSO4 which consequently lessens water loss. ii) Real battery tests including; water consumption test, capacity measurements and High Rate Partial State of Charge (HRPSoC) as a cycle-life examination. Also, Scan of Electron Microscopy from the surface of the negative electrode and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis of negative electrode plate at the charge and discharge state after cycle-life test are prepared for study the PbSO4 particles size and quantity or the morphology of sulfating layer. Addition of SHMP to the electrolyte of the lead-acid battery increases cycle-life numbers and accordingly prolongs battery life. Therefore, SHMP is a promising electrolyte additive and it would be used with a combination of additives to increase the overall performance of a lead-acid battery. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Zeolitic-imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) offer rich platforms to design multifunctional materials due to their flexibility and ultrahigh surface area. Herein, an advanced Co-N-x/C nanorod array derived from 3D ZIF nanocrystals with superior electrocatalytic activity and stability toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) compared to commercial Pt/C and IrO2, respectively, is synthesized. Remarkably, as a bifunctional catalyst (E-j = 10 (OER) - E-1/2 (ORR) approximate to 0.65 V), it further displays high performance of Zn-air batteries with high cycling stability even at a high current density. Such supercatalytic properties are largely attributed to the synergistic effect of the chemical composition, high surface area, and abundant active sites of the nanorods. The activity origin is clarified through post oxygen reduction X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis and density functional theory studies. Undoubtedly, this approach opens a new avenue to strategically design highly active and performance-oriented electrocatalytic materials for wider electrochemical energy applications.									543	49	0	0	19	0	549			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000423512300009

It is often discussed in the context of carbon dioxide free combustion and storage of electrical energy after conversion to chemical energy. Since the oxidation and reduction reactions are related to significant overpotentials, the search for suitable catalysts is of particular importance. Ferroelectric materials, for example, lithium niobate, attracted considerable interest in this respect. Indeed, the presence of surfaces with different polarizations and chemistries leads to spatial separation of reduction and oxidation reactions, which are expected to be boosted by the electrons and holes available at the positive and negative surfaces, respectively. Employing the density functional theory and a simplified thermodynamic approach, we estimate the overpotentials related to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on both polar LiNbO3 (0001) surfaces. Our calculations performed for ideal surfaces in vacuum predict the lowest overpotential for the hydrogen evolution reaction (0.4 V) and for the oxygen evolution reaction (1.2 V) at the positive and at the negative surfaces, respectively, which are lower than (or comparable with) commonly employed catalysts. However, calculations performed to model the aqueous solution in which the reactions occur reveal that the presence of water substantially increases the required overpotential for the HER, even inverting the favorable polarization direction for oxidation and reduction reactions.

The authors report that FeB2 nanoparticles, prepared by a facile chemical reduction of Fe2+ using LiBH4 in an organic solvent, are a superb bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. The FeB2 electrode delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 61 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 296 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolyte with Tafel slopes of 87.5 and 52.4 mV dec(-1), respectively. The electrode can sustain the HER at an overpotential of 100 mV for 24 h and OER for 1000 cyclic voltammetry cycles with negligible degradation. Density function theory calculations demonstrate that the boron-rich surface possesses appropriate binding energy for chemisorption and desorption of hydrogen-containing intermediates, thus favoring the HER process. The excellent OER activity of FeB2 is ascribed to the formation of a FeOOH/FeB2 heterojunction during water oxidation. An alkaline electrolyzer is constructed using two identical FeB2-NF electrodes as both anode and cathode, which can achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.57 V for overall water splitting with a faradaic efficiency of nearly 100%, rivalling the integrated state-of-the-art Pt/C and RuO2/C.									154	18	0	0	11	0	158			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000409410000032

By virtue of similar lattice orientation and structure coordination, the hybrid hydroxides amalgamate atomically without phase separation. Importantly, this in situ growth strategy, in combination with configurable percolated nanosheets, renders a high areal density of catalytic sites, immobilized structures, and conductive pathways between the nanosheets and underlying foils-all of which allow monocrystalline CoZn hydroxide nanosheet materials to function as effective electrodes for electrochemical oxygen evolution reactions. This convenient and eco-friendly topotactical transformation approach facilitates high-quality single crystal growth with improved multiphase purity and homogeneity, which can be extended to other transition metals for the fabrication of advanced functional nanocomposites.									53	3	0	0	2	0	53			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000383373700024	27416988

Parallel to ORR, GO and PdO get gradually reduced to graphene and Pd, respectively. With cycling, the half-wave potential of ORR shifts positively with both the oxides. The simultaneous evolution of the peroxide oxidation current on the Pt ring electrode is investigated. On PdO that reduces to Pd, ORR proceeds by the four-electron reduction to OH and the peroxide oxidation current on the ring electrode decreases with cycling. On the other hand, on GO that reduces to graphene, the ORR proceeds primarily by the two-electron reduction of oxygen and the peroxide oxidation current on the ring electrode increases with cycling. The voltammetric features stabilize with the reduction of the oxides. The ORR and the peroxide oxidation current on the ring electrode with electrochemically reduced GO (e-RGO), chemically reduced GO (c-RGO), carbon-black, and graphite are comparable and they are different from those of the Pd-based precious metal catalyst. The evolution of ORR polarization curves and the peroxide oxidation current on the ring electrode are explained on the basis of the removal of adsorbed-oxygenated species, oxides and by the hydrogen under potential deposition (H-upd) at lower potentials. The results are supported with Koutecky-Levich plots and the voltammograms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000371143200010

Sonochemical synthesis of electrocatalysts for low-temperature water electrolysers								Journal of the Acoustical Society of America				151	4			A38	A38		10.1121/10.0010583				2022	2022	An important step in the process of producing hydrogen a viable method is to improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of low-temperature water electrolysers. One of the most crucial components is the catalyst used to drive the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Traditionally, the nanosized electrocatalysts are synthesized through a chemical reduction method involving a strong reducing agent like sodium borohydride, polyol, etc. Being able to control the nucleation and growth and therefore the size of the nanocatalysts, however, is not straightforward with the chemical reduction method where the use of surfactants is heavily relied upon, thus complicating the method for the industry. An alternative synthesis route involves the in-situ generation of radicals to serve as reducing agents through high power ultrasound (20 kHz-1 MHz) in a process where water is split into OH- and H-radicals referred to as water sonolysis. This presentation highlights the effects of ultrasonication frequencies, ultrasonication, times, pH solutions, reducing agents, and different saturation gasses on the generation of metallic nanoparticles and their subsequent electrocatalytic activities towards the HER and OER in mild acidic and alkaline environments. A series of physical characterizations on these sonochemically prepared nanoelectrocatalysts will be shown and discussed.

Lithium-air/lithium-oxygen (Li-O-2) batteries have received extraordinary research attention recently owing to their potential to provide positive electrode gravimetric energies considerably higher (similar to 3 to 5x) than Li-ion positive electrodes, although the packaged device energy density advantage will be lower (similar to 2x). In light of the major technological challenges of Li-O-2 batteries, we discuss current understanding developed in non-carbonate electrolytes of Li-O-2 redox chemistry upon discharge and charge, oxygen reduction reaction product characteristics upon discharge, and the chemical instability of electrolytes and carbon commonly used in the oxygen electrode. We show that the kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction are influenced by catalysts at small discharge capacities (Li2O2 thickness less than similar to 1 nm), but not at large Li2O2 thicknesses, yielding insights into the governing processes during discharge. In addition, we discuss the characteristics of discharge products (mainly Li2O2) including morphological, electronic and surface features and parasitic reactivity with carbon. On charge, we examine the reaction mechanism of the oxygen evolution reaction from Li2O2 and the influence of catalysts on bulk Li2O2 decomposition. These analyses provide insights into major discrepancies regarding Li-O-2 charge kinetics and the role of catalyst. In light of these findings, we highlight open questions and challenges in the Li-O-2 field relevant to developing practical, reversible batteries that achieve the anticipated energy density advantage with a long cycle life.									711	23	0	0	30	0	720			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000315165700006

To improve the activity of IrO2-based catalysts, we prepared RuO2@IrO2 core-shell nanocatalysts using carbon-supported Ru as the template. At 1.48 V, the OER specific activity of RuO2@IrO2 is threefold that of IrO2. While the activity volcano plots over wide range of materials have been reported, zooming into the top region to clarify the rate limiting steps of most active catalysts is important for further activity enhancement. Here, we verified theory-proposed sequential water dissociation pathway in which the O-O bond forms on a single metal site, not via coupling of two adsorbed intermediates, by fitting measured polarization curves using a kinetic equation with the free energies of adsorption and activation as the parameters. Consistent with theoretical calculations, we show that the OER activities of IrO2 and RuO2@IrO2 are limited by the formation of O adsorbed phase, while the OOH formation on the adsorbed O limits the reaction rate on RuO2.									79	3	0	0	4	0	80			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000435619700040

The performance is closely related to the lattice, electronic, and defect structure of the oxides, which determine surface and bulk properties and consequent catalytic activity and durability. Further, interfacial interactions between phases in a nanocomposite may affect bulk transportation and surface adsorption properties in a similar manner to phase doping except without solubility limits. Herein, we report the development of a single/double perovskite nanohybrid with limited surface self-reconstruction capability as an OER electrocatalyst. Such superior performance arises from a structure that maintains high crystallinity post OER catalysis, in addition to forming an amorphous layer following the self-reconstruction of a single perovskite structure during the OER process. In situ X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy and high-resolution synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction reveal an amorphization process in the hybrid single/double perovskite oxide system that is limited in comparison to single perovskite amorphization, ensuring high catalytic activity.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000530086200001	32253811

Herein, we synthesized CoS2-MoS2 multi-shelled hollow spheres (MSHSs) as efficient electrocatalysts both for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) using a Schiff base coordination polymer (CP). Co-CP solid spheres were converted to Co3O4 MSHSs by sintering in air. CoS2-MoS2 MSHSs were obtained by a solvothermal reaction of Co3O4 MSHSs and MoS4 anions. CoS2-MoS2 MSHSs have a high specific surface area of 73.5 m(2) g(-1). Due to the synergistic effect between the CoS2 and MoS2, the electrode of CoS2-MoS2 MSHSs shows low overpotential of 109 mV with Tafel slope of 52.0 mV dec(-1) for HER, as well as a low overpotential of 288 mV with Tafel slope of 62.1 mV dec(-1) for OER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solution. The corresponding two-electrode system needs a potential of 1.61 V (vs. RHE) to obtain anodic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and maintains excellent stability for 10 h.

Herein, a durable and bifunctional catalyst consisting of Ni-FeOx and FeNi3 is prepared on nickel foam (Ni-FeOx/FeNi3/NF) by in situ solution combustion and subsequent calcination to accomplish efficient alkaline water splitting. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows that the high HER activity is attributed to the strong electronic coupling effects between FeOx and FeNi3 in the Janus nanoparticles by modulating Delta G(H*) and electronic states. Consequently, small overpotentials (eta) of 71 and 272 mV in HER and 269 and 405 mV in OER yield current densities (j) of 50 and 1000 mA cm(-2), respectively. The catalyst shows outstanding stability for 280 and 200 h in HER and OER at a j of similar to 50 mA cm(-2). Also, the robustness and mechanical stability of the electrode at an elevated j of similar to 500 mA cm(-2) are excellent. Moreover, Ni-FeOx/FeNi3/NF shows excellent water splitting activities as a bifunctional catalyst as exemplified by j of 50 and 500 mA cm(-2) at cell voltages of 1.58 and 1.80 V, respectively. The Ni-FeOx/FeNi3/NF structure synthesized by the novel, simple, and scalable strategy has large potential in commercial water electrolysis, and the in situ combustion method holds great promise in the fabrication of thin-film electrodes for different applications.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000816334500001	35686853

Here, we use nickel oxide for its high hydrophilicity and ammonium fluoride to cause the current collector to produce more active sites with increased adhesion to prepare 2D ultrafine Mo-based precursor nanosheets with uniform dimensions and a stable structure on nickel foam (NF). Further phosphorization treatment is performed to obtain porous molybdenum phosphide (MoP) nanosheets on Ni3P/NF. As a freestanding integrated electrode, MoP@Ni3P/NF possess excellent catalytic activity for the HER and OER with low overpotentials (45 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER and 331 mV to reach 35 mA cm(-2) for the OER). The performance of this catalyst is close to that of some precious metal catalysts. The activity as both an anode and cathode catalyst for overall water splitting can reach 1.67 V at 10 mA cm(-2). Due to its scalable preparation and stability, the MoP@Ni3P/NF electrocatalyst is promising for use in practical water-alkali electrolysis.									32	5	0	0	0	0	33			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000472176900164

Nano metal-organic framework (NMOF) can be employed to fabricate nanodots-confined nanohybrids for use in electrocatalytic processes. Herein, we report a controlled synthesis of gold nanodot assembly within cobalt chalcogenide nanoshell (dots-in-shell Au/CoxSy nanohybrids). A cobalt-based NMOF (the cobalt-based zeolite imidazole framework, ZIF-67) is used as a versatile sacrificial template to yield dots-in-shell Au/CoxSy nanohybrids. Due to the synergistic effect of the well-dispersed Au nanodots and the thin CoxSy nanoshell, the obtained dots-in-shell Au/CoxSy nanohybrids exhibit enhanced performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with low overpotential values at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope (343 mV and 62 mV dec(-1), respectively).

Anion engineering can create a series of PGM compounds (such as RuP2, IrP2, PtP2, RuB2, Ru2B3, RuS2, etc.) that provide a promising prospect for improving the electrocatalytic performance and use of Pt-group noble metals. This review seeks the electrochemical activity origin of anion-modulated PGM compounds, and systematically analyzes and summarizes their synthetic strategies and energy-relevant applications in electrocatalysis. Orientation towards the sustainable development of nonfossil resources has stimulated a blossoming interest in the design of advanced electrocatalysts for clean energy conversion. The anion-modulated strategy for Pt-group metals (PGMs) by means of anion engineering possesses high flexibility to regulate the electronic structure, providing a promising prospect for constructing electrocatalysts with superior activity and stability to satisfy a future green electrochemical energy conversion system.

Multivariate metal-organic frameworks (MTV-MOFs) are ideal precursors to prepare multimetallic nanocomposites with high catalytic activity since the uniform distribution and precise regulation of mixed metal centers, as well as the consequent strong synergistic effect, could be readily achieved. Herein, a Mn/Co/Ni trimetallic catalyst (MnCoNi-C-D) with a hollow rhombic dodecahedron shape was synthesized via pyrolysis of the corresponding trimetallic-based MTV-MOF. The catalyst shows outstanding electrochemical activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction including a half-wave potential of 0.82 V and superior tolerance against methanol as well as high stability in an alkaline medium, and its oxygen evolution reaction activity also surpasses a RuO2 catalyst. Moreover, primary and rechargeable zinc-air batteries based on MnCoNi-C-D delivered preferable performances compared with commercial Pt/C-RuO2, including higher peak power density (116.4 mW cm(-2)), higher specific capacity (841.3 mAh g(-1)), higher open-circuit potential (OCV) (1.46 V), and better stability for more than 180 h. A comprehensive comparison was also conducted to prove the necessity of employing the MTV-MOF as the precursor and investigate the intrinsic superiority of the catalyst.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000677540900057	34229429

Here, a novel MOF-hybrid-assisted strategy to synthesize Co3O4/Co-Fe oxide double-shelled nanoboxes is reported. In the first step, zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67, a Co-based MOF)/Co-Fe Prussian blue analogue (PBA) yolk-shell nanocubes are formed via a facile anion-exchange reaction between ZIF-67 nanocube precursors and [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) ions at room temperature. Subsequently, an annealing treatment is applied to prepare Co3O4/Co-Fe oxide double-shelled nanoboxes.

The thickness of Ru overlayers can be accurately tuned at an atomic level, which has been confirmed by atomic force microscopy and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy. After annealing in air, the Pd@Ru NSs were transformed to PdO@RuO2 NSs with rutile RuO2 epitaxially grown on the PdO. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and stability strongly depend on the atomic layers of RuO2 and similar to 4 atomic layers of RuO2 (PdO@RuO2-4layers) exhibit superior stability and optimal activity for OER with only 257 mV of the overpotential to reach 10 mA cm(-2). Density functional theory calculations well reproduce the thickness dependence of OER activity and reveal that O* binds more weakly on the PdO@RuO2-4layers that boosts the rate-determining step for formation of HOO*, assuring the best OER performance.									24	5	0	0	1	0	24			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000497263600049	31642318

The experiments were performed in steady-state conditions at temperatures between 273 and 303 K. The results show discontinuities, or thermal transitions, in the temperature-response curves of oxygen evolution. The experimental data was examined with the Marcus theory of electron transfer modified to take into account the oxygen evolution discontinuities. For this purpose, the Gibbs free energy of activation of the electron transfer reaction, Delta G degrees, is replaced in the classical Marcus equation with the expression Delta H degrees - T Delta S degrees, where H degrees and Delta S degrees are respectively the enthalpy and entropy of activation, and T is the temperature in kelvin. The result of the derivation is a summation of j Gaussian functions, or states, OE = 69 250 Sigma(j){(V-DA(4)/lambda T)(1/2) exp[-(T-max - T)(2)/2T sigma(2)(o)]}(j) (eq 1), where OE is expressed in mu mol oxygen evolution.(mg Chl.h)(-1), and V-DA is the electronic coupling matrix element between electron donor (D) and acceptor (A) wave functions, lambda the reorganization free energy, k(B) the Boltzmann constant, T-max = (Delta H degrees + lambda)/Delta S degrees, sigma(o) = (2k(B)lambda/Delta S degrees 2)(1/2), and sigma = T-1/2 sigma(o) is the standard deviation of the Gaussian hand. The mathematical simulations revealed the presence of six thermal transitions, or Gaussian bands with maxima at 275.3, 281.2, 286.4, 291.4, 297.1, and 302.4 K. The resolution of the Gaussian bands is about 0.55 owing to multiple hand superpositions. The theoretical analyses showed that (i) the oxygen evolution in PSII is essentially dependent on V-DA(2)/(lambda T)(1/2) in the pre-exponential term of the modified Marcus equation (eq 1), and (ii) the reorganization energy, lambda, decreases exponentially with increasing temperature, and is also dependent on the electron donor-acceptor distance. It is concluded that the temperature dependence of the large enhancement of oxygen evolution observed in this work originates, at least partly, in heat-induced structural rearrangements in the photosystem II reaction center.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1520-6106	1520-5207		WOS:000271580700035	19856932

However, with the enhancement of NOR activity by modification methods, the competitive oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is always improved simultaneously. Here, a hybrid electrocatalyst composed of Au nanoparticles and oxygen vacancy-enriched niobium oxide nanobelts (Au-Nb2O5-x) was prepared on niobium foil for N-2 fixation into NO3-. The results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) demonstrate that electron transfer occurs between Au nanoparticles and the oxygen vacancies in Nb2O5-x nanobelts, which adjusts the electronic structures of oxygen vacancies near the Au/Nb2O5-x interface. Electrochemical and N-2 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) tests indicate that the optimization of the electronic structure suppresses the activity of the competitive OER on oxygen vacancy sites and facilitates nitrogen adsorption on the surface of Au-Nb2O5-x, which significantly enhances the NOR performance of the electrocatalyst.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000681725700001

NiCo bimetallic nanoparticles embedded in N-doped nanotubes (NCNTs) on carbon cloth substrate were formed here by a simple two-step method via hydrothermal treatment followed by in-situ pyrolysis and self-catalysis through chemical vapor deposition. The unique three-dimensional network and Ni/Co-N-C coordination of NiCo/NCNTs electrocatalyst provide predominant advantage for short-range and long-range conductivity and exposure of active sites. Such beneficial characteristics result in significant improvement in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances. The electrocatalysts obtained from two NiCo bimetallic hydroxides with different structures exhibit the overpotential of 210 and 290 mV at current density of 20 mA cm(-2) and the Tafel slope of 148 and 160 mV dec(-1), respectively.

Herein, the electronic properties of Pt could be modified with a nickel nitride (Ni3N) support through forming an interface of a low ratio of Pt nanoclusters (Pt NCs)viaa simple impregnation approach combined with nitridation. 1.5Pt@Ni3N-360 can offer excellent bifunctional performance for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) which is competitive with commercial IrO(2)and Pt/C catalysts under alkaline media. It shows a low overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2)(285 and 71 mV) and a small Tafel slope (57 and 48 mV dec(-1)) for OER and HER, respectively. The excellent bifunctional electrochemical activity of 1.5Pt@Ni3N-360 is due to the interface and synergetic effect between Ni3N and dispersed Pt clusters, which changes the electron distribution of the material, so that the hydrogen adsorption energy tends to the optimal value (Delta G(H*)similar to 0). It is believed that the utilization of low-ratio Pt as an co-electrocatalyst with a variety of metal nitrides opens new horizons and opportunities to fabricate more efficient electrocatalysts for broad applications in energy-related devices.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16				2052-1537		WOS:000562931700008

However, it is highly restricted by the sluggish kinetics of the four-electron process of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Therefore, there is quite an urgent need to develop efficient, abundant, and economical electrocatalysts. Transition metal carbides (TMCs) have recently been recognized as promising electrocatalysts for OER due to their excellent activity, conductivity, and stability. In this review, widely-accepted evaluation parameters and measurement criteria for different electrocatalysts are discussed. Moreover, five sorts of TMC electrocatalysts-including NiC, tungsten carbide (WC), Fe3C, MoC, and MXene-as well as their hybrids, are researched in terms of their morphology and compounds. Additionally, the synthetic methods are summarized. Based on the existing materials, strategies for improving the catalytic ability and new designs of electrocatalysts are put forward. Finally, the future development of TMC materials is discussed both experimentally and theoretically, and feasible modification approaches and prospects of a reliable mechanism are referred to, which would be instructive for designing other effective noble-free electrocatalysts for OER.									26	0	0	0	1	0	26				2073-4344		WOS:000584477200001

The results indicated that the particle size increased with the calcination temperature increasing, while BET and CH4 conversion declined with the calcination temperature increasing using LaFeO3 oxide as oxygen donor in the absence of gaseous oxygen. CO selectivity remained at a high level such as above 92%, and increased slightly as the calcination temperature increased. Exposure of LaFeO3 oxides to methane atmosphere enhanced the oxygen migration of in the bulk with time online owing to the loss of lattice oxygen and reduction of the oxidative stated Fe ion simultaneously. The high reaction temperature was favorable to the migration of oxygen species from the bulk toward the surface for the synthesis gas production with high CO selectivity. The product distribution and evolution for POM by sequential redox reaction was determined by amounts of replenished lattice oxygen with gaseous oxygen. The optimal process should decline the total oxidation of methane, and increase the selectivity of partial oxidation of methane.									29	9	0	0	0	0	30			1002-0721			WOS:000258476900007

Common synthesis methods are frequently associated with an accompanying addition of phosphoric acid. The presence of free phosphoric acid is known to be detrimental for catalytic activity of the common oxygen evolution catalysts. In this work composite electrocatalytic layers of iridium oxide, Nafion (R) and zirconium hydrogen phosphate were fabricated on glassy carbon disk electrodes. Zirconium hydrogen phosphate was prepared by mixing zirconium oxychloride and phosphoric acid. The effect of the electrocatalyst constituents were electrochemically investigated with respect to the oxygen evolution reaction in 0.5 M sulfuric acid electrolyte at room temperature. Slow linear sweep voltammograms showed that the electrocatalyst performance depends only to a small extent on the way the composite electrodes were manufactured. However, the coexistence of zirconium hydrogen phosphate particles in the electrode structure offsets the destructive effect of any phosphoric acid remaining in the electrode more or less completely. Inherent catalyst activity is unaffected by the addition of zirconium hydrogen phosphate, but apparently worsen the current per mass emphasizing the necessity of optimizing the catalytic layers with respect to performance and mechanical properties.

Mixed metal oxide electrodes consisting of RuO2, IrO2, and Ta2O5 with various ratios on a titanium substrate were prepared by spray thermal decomposition. The crystallinity of the synthesized catalyst was investigated via X-ray diffraction, and the oxidation state of each component was determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Surface morphology was investigated by scanning electron microscopy, and the roughness factor was determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 1 M H2SO4. Electo-catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction was measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 1 M KOH at room temperature, and it was found to be strongly dependent on composition of catalyst. Among all electrodes tested, catalyst with a composition of Ru:Ir:Ta= 1:2:2.5 exhibited the highest current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at 1.67 V, corresponding to an overpotential of 0.44 V.									7	1	0	0	1	0	8			1533-4880	1533-4899		WOS:000386123100020	27483764

In this study, low-crystallinity and microspherical CoFe-P/NF catalyst synthesized by potentiostat electrodeposition on a foam nickel substrate had an excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and water splitting performance. In 1 M KOH solution, the CoFe-P/NF required the overpotentials of 45 mV for HER and 287 mV for OER in order to create a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the Tafel slope for HER and OER was measured as 35.4 and 43.2 mV dec(-1), respectively. Serving as the bifunctional catalysts, the CoFe-P/NF electrode couple displays a low voltage of only 1.58 V at 10 mA cm(-2) with an excellent long-term stability. Such remarkably properties of the CoFe-P/NF are attributed to the crystalline-amorphous phase structure, the synergistic effect of Co, Fe and P, and rapid separation of bubbles from the electrode surface. In summary, this study provides a new method for developing cost-effective catalyst towards green hydrogen production via water splitting. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

In this work, we reported the preparation of porous Ni-Co nitride nanowires (NiCoN NWs) supported on carbon cloth, and used as bifunctional electrocatalysts to achieve overall water splitting. Benefiting from the 1D porous nanowire structure, the close contact between catalysts and support, and the increased conductivity, the resultant NiCoN NWs exhibited high activities in both the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) with low overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (approximate to 145 mV for HER and 360 mV for OER), low Tafel slope (105.2 mV dec(-1) for HER and 46.9 mV dec(-1) for OER), and good electrochemical stability.

Herein, a simple and cost-effective approach is developed to prepare novel materials based on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanocomposite (CNT/BN) through a one-step hydrothermal method. The structural analysis and morphology study confirms the formation of a homogeneous composite and merging of few exfoliated graphene layers of CNTs on the graphitic planes of h-BN, respectively. Moreover, the electrochemical study implies that CNT/BN nanocompo-site shows a significantly higher ORR activity with a single step 4-electron transfer pathway and an improved onset potential of +0.86V versus RHE and a current density of 5.78 mA cm(-2) in alkaline conditions. Interestingly, it exhibits appreciably better catalytic activity towards OER at low over-potential (eta = 0.38 V) under similar conditions. Moreover, this bifunctional catalyst shows substantially higher stability than a commercial Pt/C catalyst even after 5000 cycles. Additionally, this composite catalyst does not show any methanol oxidation reactions that nullify the issues due to fuel crossover effects in direct methanol fuel cell applications.									50	2	0	0	3	0	52			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000393625600026	27709715

LaMn0.5Ni0.5O3 perovskites with or without strontium (Sr) doping were prepared using a sol-gel process and characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and BrunauerEmmett-Teller (BET) gas adsorption techniques. A structural transition in the LaMn0.5Ni0.5O3 perovskite was observed upon doping, suggesting its pinning effect on the crystal structure. The SEM and BET results showed that the incorporation of Sr2+ into this oxide material markedly decreased the particle size into the nanoscale range and increased the active surface area. The oxide electrocatalytic properties toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline medium were measured using a rotating disk electrode. The results revealed that La0.8Sr0.2Ni0.5Mn0.5O3 is a more active catalyst than LaMn0.5Ni0.5O3 for the ORR and OER. The improved electrocatalytic performance of the Sr-doped oxide is related to the increase in ORR/OER current density and the positive shift in the ORR onset potential compared with that of the LaMn0.5Ni0.5O3 catalyst. The overall electron transfer number was measured as approximately 4. The basis of this enhanced performance is discussed in terms of the material electronic structure and morphology.

Searching for novel catalytic materials for electrochemical oxygen generation is essential for improving the total efficiency of water splitting processes. We report the synthesis, structural characterization, and electrochemical performance in the oxygen evolution reaction of Fe-doped NiO nanocrystals. The facile solvothermal synthesis in tert-butanol leads to the formation of ultrasmall crystalline and highly dispersible FexNi-xO nanoparticles with dopant concentrations of up to 20%. The increase in Fe content is accompanied by a decrease in particle size, resulting in nonagglomerated nanocrystals of 1.5-3.8 nm in size. The Fe content and composition of the nanoparticles are determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy measurements, while Miissbauer and extended X-ray absorption fine structure analyses reveal a substitutional incorporation of Fe(III) into the NiO rock salt structure. The excellent dispersibility of the nartoparticles in ethanol allows for the preparation of homogeneous ca. 8 nm thin films with a smooth surface on various substrates. The turnover frequencies (TOF) of these films could be precisely calculated using a quartz crystal microbalance. Fe0.1Ni0.9O was found to have the highest electrocatalytic water oxidation activity in basic media with a TOF of 1.9 s(-1) at the overpotential of 300 mV. The current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is reached at an overpotential of 297 mV with a Tafel slope of 37 mV dec(-1). The extremely high catalytic activity, facile preparation, and low cost of the single crystalline FexNi1-xO nanoparticles make them very promising catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction.									370	12	0	0	11	0	373			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000355383000053	25831435

Meanwhile, loading Pt-based catalysts on graphene has great research value for improved stability and dispersity of the catalysts. Herein, a facile L-proline-mediated solvothermal strategy was reported to construct reduced graphene oxide (rGO) supported sheet-like PtCo nanocrystals (Pt78Co22 NCs/rGO) in ethylene glycol (EG). The as-synthesized nanocomposite manifested remarkably improved catalytic properties and chemical stability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), surpassing home-made Pt29Co71 nanoparticles (NPs)/rGO, Pt83Co17 NPs/rGO, Pt52Co48 NPs, commercial Pt/C and Pt black catalysts. These scenarios demonstrated an improved catalytic performances by tailoring the feeding ratio of Pt:Co and introducing rGO as a support. This work provides some new insights to design rGO-supported Pt-based catalysts by engineering the shapes and compositions in practical fuel cells. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Water splitting involves hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), in which OER is the limiting factor and has attracted extensive research interest in the past few years. Conventional noble-metal-based OER electrocatalysts like IrO2 and RuO2 suffer from the limitations of high cost and scarce availability. Developing innovative alternative nonnoble metal electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity and long-term durability to boost the OER process remains a significant challenge. Among all of the candidates for OER catalysis, self-supported layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have emerged as one of the most promising types of electrocatalysts due to their unique layered structures and high electrocatalytic activity. In this review, we summarize the recent progress on self-supported LDHs and highlight their electrochemical catalytic performance. Specifically, synthesis methods, structural and compositional parameters, and influential factors for optimizing OER performance are discussed in detail. Finally, the remaining challenges facing the development of self-supported LDHs are discussed and perspectives on their potential for use in industrial hydrogen production through water splitting are provided to suggest future research directions.									58	4	0	0	1	0	58				2639-5274		WOS:000526092000001	32159161

We show that this Ru-CoSe system undergoes chemical and structural transformations under hydrogen evolution conditions: CoSe NCs, which initially exhibit a hexagonal crystal structure, are converted into CoSe2 NCs having a cubic structure. The Co that is extracted during this process forms a Co oxide/hydroxide layer; the Ru clusters aggregate and form Ru NCs. Such modifications result in a final Ru-CoOx/Co(OH)(x) CoSe2 nanocomposite that exhibits an enhanced hydrogen evolution activity. Our work highlights the importance of studying the chemical transformations that occur in both the catalyst and the support during hydrogen evolution reactions.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2574-0970			WOS:000488423900040

In this study, a highly efficient bifunctional oxygen catalyst, which was made of bamboo-like nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes with embedded cobalt nanoparticles (Co@NCNTs), was fabricated by a one-step pyrolysis route. Systematic electrochemical results demonstrated that the optimized electrocatalyst only needed a small potential hysteresis of about 0.834 V to achieve 1 mAcm(-2) ORR current and 10 mAcm(-2) OER current, and simultaneously gave superior stability and methanol tolerance to those of commercial metal catalysts. The major factors that influenced the bifunctional catalyst performance of Co@NCNTs are discussed, among which the nitrogen chemical state and metal element play important roles. Moreover, the catalyst showed good activity and stability in rechargeable zinc-air batteries, which indicated their potential applications in metal-air batteries, fuel cells, and water-splitting devices.									25	2	0	0	1	0	25			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000407591200019

Detailed analysis of energy balance and efficiency of solar hydrogen production are presented. The role of hydrogen peroxide formation as an intermediate in oxygen evolution reaction is newly revealed and explains why an oxygen evolution is not taking place at the thermodynamically expected 1.23 V potential. Mechanism of cascading oxidation of water molecules via the peroxide stage is proposed and conforms with experimental observation.Solar hydrogen production with electrical-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 52% is demonstrated using a simple similar to 0.7%-efficient n-Si/Ni Schottky solar cell connected to a water electrolysis cell. This case study shows that separation of the processes of solar harvesting and electrolysis avoids photo-electrode corrosion and utilizes optimal electrodes for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions and achieves similar to 10% efficiency in light to-hydrogen conversion with a standard 18% efficient household roof Si-solar cells.

Herein, we propose a scalable approach to integrate ZIF derivatives into cavity porous carbon nanofibers (CPCNFs) via an electrospinning technique and thermal treatment (Zn/CoNC@CPCNFs). The ultralong interconnected nanofiber matrix is beneficial, and the developed Zn/CoNC@CPCNFs catalyst with excellent flexibility can be utilized as a free-standing electrode based on an air-cathode. Moreover, this confinement strategy ensures the dispersion of Co-based species and abundant porosity structure, which contributes to the transport and adsorption of oxygen and exposes more Co-N coordination catalytic centers, as a result of a drastically ultralow voltage gap. Consequently, a cell based on a Zn/CoNC@CPCNF electrode presents remarkably decreased charge-discharge polarization (0.36 V), a high initial discharge capacity with an ultra-low overpotential of 0.59 V, and long-term cyclability with a cut-off capacity of 0.2 mA h cm(-2) at 0.02 mA cm(-2). We hope that our protocol will offer instruction for the design and application of oxygen electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000703756500001	34605509

Here, a 3D core-shell electrocatalyst consisting of Co(OH)(2) cavity array-encapsulated NiMo alloy on the flexible carbon cloth substrate (Co(OH)(2)/NiMo CA@CC) is proposed. Density functional theory reveals that coupling NiMo with Co(OH)(2) can better optimize the water adsorption/dissociation and hydrogen adsorption energies in hydrogen evolution reaction, and also accelerate the kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction. Based on this, the open porous structure of the outer Co(OH)(2) cavity array further promotes the diffusion of the electrolyte into the heterogeneous interface between NiMo and Co(OH)(2), significantly shortening the electron transfer pathways and exposing multiple active sites. In addition, the macroporous array structure accelerates the bubble evolution and desorption process, thus ensuring a rapid mass transfer.

The practical industrial electrode should fulfill several criteria of high activity, structural stability, and fast bubble evolution at a large current density. In this study, a novel monolithic 3D hollow foam electrode that can achieve the requirements of large current density water electrolysis is developed and fabricated through a simple electroless plating-calcination strategy. This strong 3D Ni-Mo-B hollow foam electrode can withstand a pressure of 2.37 MPa and exhibits high electrochemical surface area, high conductivity, and low gas transfer resistance, drastically boosting its catalytic performance. It affords 50 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of only 68 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction and 293 mV for oxygen evolution reaction and can survive at a large current density of 5 A cm(-2) while maintaining its structure and performance in 1.0 m KOH. The advantages of facile preparation, high mechanical strength, high gas mass transfer ability, and excellent performance enable this structure to be a potential electrode, active substrate, or 3D catalyst in many fields.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000704754400001

More importantly, the FeVO4 nanobelts exhibit more efficient electrocatalytic activities than the nanosheets, with a low overpotential of 240 mV (10 mA cm(-2)) and durability (36 h) towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Further studies clearly reveal that the improved activity of FeVO4 nanobelts is mainly attributed to the open surface structure and favorable atomic arrangements of {010} facets, which assure rapid charge transfer and Fe-V dual-active sites for the OER.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472225200011

The abundances of the three main isotopes of oxygen are altered in the course of the CNO-cycle. When the first dredge-up mixes the burning products to the surface, the nucleosynthesis processes can be probed by measuring oxygen isotopic ratios.Aims. By measuring O-16/O-17 and O-16/O-18 in red giants of known mass we compare the isotope ratios with predictions from stellar and galactic evolution modelling.Methods. Oxygen isotopic ratios were derived from the K-band spectra of six red giants. The sample red giants are open cluster members with known masses of between 1.8 and 4.5 M-circle dot. The abundance determination employs synthetic spectra calculated with the COMARCS code. The effect of uncertainties in the nuclear reaction rates, the mixing length, and of a change in the initial abundance of the oxygen isotopes was determined by a set of nucleosynthesis and mixing models using the FUNS code.Results. The observed O-16/O-17 ratios are in good agreement with the model results, even if the measured values do not present clear evidence of a variation with the stellar mass. The observed O-16/O-18 ratios are clearly lower than the predictions from our reference model. Variations in nuclear reaction rates and mixing length parameter both have only a very weak effect on the predicted values. The C-12/C-13 ratios of the K giants studied implies the absence of extra-mixing in these objects.Conclusions. A comparison with galactic chemical evolution models indicates that the O-16/O-18 abundance ratio underwent a faster decrease than predicted. To explain the observed ratios, the most likely scenario is a higher initial O-18 abundance combined with a lower initial O-16 abundance. Comparing the measured O-18/O-17 ratio with the corresponding value for the interstellar medium points towards an initial enhancement of O-17 as well. Limitations imposed by the observations prevent this from being a conclusive result.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1432-0746			WOS:000357502600045

Here, we provide a successive hydrothermal, oxidation, and phosphidation method to fabricate a 3D nest-like ternary NiCoP/carbon cloth (CC) electrocatalyst with superior catalytic activity and stability toward HER/OER.

We found that Au nanoparticles incorporated with Ni nanoparticles can enhance the OER activity and stability of Ni nanoparticles due to the local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect of the Au nano particles. The efficiency of NiAu/TiO2/n-Si photoanode can be boosted at least three times under the illumination (100 mW/cm(2)) by LSPR effect of the Au nanoparticles. A small onset potential of 1.03 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (overpotential, eta(0) = -0.20 V) and a current density of 18.80 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode can be obtained. The NiAu/TiO2/n-Si photoanode exhibits a high saturation current density of 35 mA/cm(2), which is greater than that of most of the state-of-the-art silicon photoanodes.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			1944-8244			WOS:000426143900023	29384361

For long-distance transportation by pipeline and bulk tanker, a liquid form of energy carrier is ideal, focusing attention on liquid hydrogen and ammonia. Development of high-activity and selectivity electrocatalyst materials to produce these energy carriers by reductive electrochemistry has therefore become an important area of research. Here, recent developments and challenges in the field of electrocatalytic materials for these processes are discussed, including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Some of the mis-steps currently plaguing the nitrogen reduction to ammonia field are highlighted.

Herein, Prussian blue analogues (PBA)-derived CoFe-based nanomaterials with increased specific surface area and abundant catalytic active sites are utilized as efficient and durable electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Due to the adjustable chemical conformation and controllable 3D morphology, CoFe-B nanocubes exhibit an ultrathin nanosheets-wrapped nanocube structure with excellent electrocatalytic performance and remarkable reaction kinetics in 1.0 m KOH aqueous solution. In addition, CoFe-B nanocubes cost overpotentials of 261 and 338 mV at corresponding current densities of 10 and 200 mA cm(-2), respectively, with small Tafel slope of 61 mV dec(-1) for OER, which displays higher catalytic capability than the reported commercial RuO2. The outstanding electrocatalytic performance can be mainly attributed to the unique ultrathin nanosheets-wrapped nanocube structure which is generated from calcination. This work not only provides a new way for the application of PBA but also obtains an alternative for efficient electrocatalysis.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000588405000001

However, the sluggish electrochemical reactions occurring at the anode and cathode, namely, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively, consume a tremendous amount of energy, seriously hampering its wide application. Recently, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have been proposed to effectively enhance the kinetics of these two reactions. In this minireview, we focus on the recent progress in SACs for OER and HER applications. Three classes of SACs have been reviewed, i.e., alloy-based SACs, carbon-based SACs and SACs supported on other compounds. Different factors affecting the activities of SACs are also highlighted, including the inherent element property, the coordination environment, the geometric structure and the loading amount of metal atoms. Finally, we summarize the current problems and directions for future development in SACs. (C) 2021, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Herein, an exquisite triphasic interfacial structure featuring the encapsulation of FexNi alloy in a graphitic shell with a partial exposure of the FeOy thin-layered surface is manipulated via an electronic modulation strategy. The spontaneous integration of well-crystallized metal alloy, carbon shell with a tunable active FeOy layer, not only guarantees smooth charge transfer across the thin oxide layer, but also generates the synergistic effect at the interface, thus dramatically boosting the intrinsic activity of oxygen catalysis. Benefiting from these attributes, the hybrid catalyst outperforms the commercial noble-metal benchmarks with a higher half-wave potential of 0.890 V for oxygen reduction reaction and lower overpotential of 308 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media. Beyond that, a high-performance rechargeable Zn-air battery is realized with a narrow voltage gap of 0.742 V and excellent cyclability over 500 cycles at 10 mA cm(-2), demonstrating the great potential of the as-developed triphasic electrocatalyst for practical applications.									47	5	0	0	2	0	48			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000501577600001

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are used to produce a material composed of porous nitrogen-doped carbon materials encapsulating cobalt and tungsten carbide (Co/W-C@NCNSs). Nanoscale MOFs are successfully synthesized via a microwave method and are denoted as HZIF-W. Moreover, the obtained MOFs are annealed under N-2 atmosphere at a temperature of 600 and 800 degrees C, and the obtained samples are designated as Co/W-C@NCNSs(600) and Co/W-C@NCNSs(800), respectively, according to the annealing temperature. The results show that the obtained Co/W-C@NCNSs exhibit superior performance toward both the OER and HER in alkaline media. Co/W-C@NCNSs(800) shows the best electrocatalytic activities, requiring an overpotential of 323 mV (vs RHE) and -252 mV (vs RHE) to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the electrocatalytic OER and HER in an aqueous solution. A water electrolyzer device using Co/W-C@NCNSs(800) as both the anode and cathode requires only a cell voltage of 1.68 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), thus illustrating that cobalt/tungsten carbide-based NCNSs derived from MOFs can be prospective materials for the electrocatalysis of water splitting.									30	2	0	0	0	0	30			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000466486200017

A simple sol-gel method with citric acid as a multipurpose chelating and reduction agent was used. The subsequent thermal treatment was carried out in an oxygen-deficient atmosphere (pyrolysis). The catalysts were characterized by rotating disc electrode (RDE) OER measurements, N-2 adsorption, XRD, XPS, TEM, DLS and elemental analyses. The highest activity in the OER was achieved with a Co:Cu ratio of 5 (47 Ag-catalyst(-1) at 1.6 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode). This is the first time that such high activity has been reported. These transition metal oxide catalysts might be promising candidates as an anode material in alkaline water electrolyzers. Higher and lower Co:Cu ratios revealed less activity.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			2196-0216			WOS:000410498700043

Hexagonal perovskite materials show great application potential in this field. Here, we synthesized 5% Iridium (Ir)-doped hexagonal phase perovskite BaCo0.8Fe0.15Ir0.05O3-delta (BCFI). Using the Rietveld method to refine the structure, combining with the spherical aberration corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) atomic imaging, we found that BCFI is a ten-layer hexagonal (10H) structure, which belongs to the P 6 over bar m2 space group. In addition, BCFI shows excellent OER catalytic effect and good stability in 1 mol/L KOH solution, and the overpotential reaches 294 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The reduction of Cobalt (Co) valence state induced by Ir doping significantly enhances the OER activity of BCFI. Meanwhile, density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the 2p-band center of oxygen (O) in BCFI is closer to the Fermi level than that in undoped BaCo0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BCF), which is beneficial to the OER. This work reveals a novel 10H-BCFI material with excellent OER performance, and provides a basis for the design of hexagonal perovskite materials in OER and other energy conversion fields.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1001-604X	1614-7065		WOS:000826779700001

Herein, we proposed a simple method for constructing dendritic N-doped carbon/ manganese oxides (N-C/MnOx) hybrid nanocomposites by annealing the composite of nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots (N-CQDs) and gamma-MnOOH (gamma-MnOOH@N-CQDs) at different temperatures under N-2/O-2 atmosphere. The obtained N-C/MnOx exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic activity and stability for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) owing to their unique dendritic structure, rich oxygen vacancies, optimized electronic structure, abundant Mn-C/N, and large electrochemical active area. Among of the prepared N-C/MnOx hybrid nanocomposites, N-C/Mn2O3 showed the best performance toward OER with an overpotential of merely 347 mV to reach to 10 mA cm(-2), along with a small Tafel slope of 75.51 mV dec(-1). More remarkably, by combining Pt/C with N-C/Mn2O3 for overall water splitting, a battery voltage of only 1.67 V is needed to reach the 10 mA cm(-2), rivaling the activity of the state-of-the-art IrO2 parallel to Pt/C couple.

As the extension of single-atom catalyst, double-atom catalyst (DAC) featuring with the metal dimer anchored on a suitable substrate has recently emerged as a research focus for the energy-related electrocatalysis reactions. Due to the flexible dual-metal sites and the synergetic effect between the two metal atoms in DACs, there are more possibilities to adjust their geometrical configurations and electronic structures. The wide tunability of the active sites could offer more opportunities to optimize the binding strength of the reaction intermediates and thus the catalytic activity and/or selectivity of chemical reactions. Moreover, the neighboring metal sites provide a platform to perform more complex electrocatalysis reaction involving the chemical bond coupling. This review aims to summarize the recent advance in theoretical research on DACs for diverse energy-related electrocatalytic reactions. It starts with a brief introduction to DACs. Then an overview of the main experimental synthesis strategies of DACs is provided. Emphatically, the catalytic performance together with the underlying mechanism of the different electrocatalytic reactions, including nitrogen reduction reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, and oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, are highlighted by discussing how the outstanding attributes mentioned above affect the reaction pathway, catalytic activity, and product selectivity. Finally, the opportunities and challenges for the development of DACs are prospected to shed fresh light on the rational design of more efficient catalysts at the atomic scale in the future.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000749506700001

It was accompanied by a rapid increase of the gel content in the stage of the weight gain of 6 similar to 8 wt% and microflaw generated on the surface of the cured PACS fibers. In the initial stage, Si-H bonds in PACS reacted with oxygen to form Si-O-Si bonds and the (M) over bar (n) Of the PACS fiber increased greatly, which resulted in a cross-linked structure in the cured PACS fiber. In the medium stage, the remaining Si-H bonds continued to react with oxygen and the reaction between Si-CH3, Si-H and oxygen took place producing Si-O-C groups. In the last stage, the fiber cross-linked completely and it consisted Of SiC4, SiC3H, Si-O-Si and Si-O-C groups.									4	4	0	0	0	0	5			0567-7351			WOS:000239852900012

In this work, we report the synthesis of homogeneous ternary Fe2-xMnxP nanorods with control of Mn incorporation (0 <= x <= 0.9) from the solution-phase reaction of manganese and iron carbonyl complexes with trioctylphosphine. The OER activity of Fe2-xMnxP nanorods dramatically increases with the incorporation of Mn (overpotential as low as 0.44 Vat 10 mA/cm(2) for x = 0.9), and the overpotential can be further decreased (by nearly 0.1 V) by postdeposition annealing. The enhanced OER activity and stability, along with the abundance and availability of Fe and Mn, make bimetallic manganese-iron phosphides a promising class of materials for more cost-effective and efficient water oxidation catalysis.									118	5	0	0	1	0	119			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000399264100050

The electrocatalytic activity of a catalyst is associated with the surface/interface, geometric structure, and electronic properties. Coupling Ir with transition metal compounds is an effective strategy to improve their electrocatalytic performance. In this review, we summarize the recent progress of Ir coupled transition metal compound catalysts for the application in driving electrochemical water splitting. The significant role of Ir played in the promotion of electrocatalytic performance is firstly illustrated. Then, the applications of Ir-based catalysts in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are comprehensively discussed, with an emphasis on correlating the structure-function relationships. Lastly, the challenges and future directions for the fabrication of more advanced Ir coupled electrocatalysts are also presented.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1527-8999	1528-0691		WOS:000843625100001	36000851

Ni foam (NF) is highlighted for its 3D porous structure, impressive conductivity and large specific surface area. Herein, nano/micro structured dendritic cobalt activated nickel sulfide grown on 3D porous NF (Co-Ni3S2/NF) has been successfully synthesized by one-step hydrothermal method. Due to the ingenious incorporation of Co, Co-Ni3S2/NF electrode shows auspicious electrocatalytic performance for OER compared with Ni3S2/NF electrode. As a result, Co-Ni3S2/NF needs overpotential of only 274 and 459 mV at current density of 10 and 50 mA cm(-2), respectively, while Ni3S2/NF requires overpotential of 344 and 511 mV. At potential of 2.0 V (vs. RHE), Co-Ni3S2/NF displays current density of 191 mA cm(-2), while Ni3S2/NF just attains current density of only 135 mA cm(-2). Moreover, Co-Ni3S2/NF demonstrates excellent stability for uninterrupted OER in alkaline electrolyte. The strategy of designing and preparing cobalt activated nickel sulfide grown on NF renders a magnificent prospect for the development of metal-sulfide-based oxygen evolution catalysts with excellent electrocatalytic performances.

However, introducing vacancy defects into single-crystalline nanostructures with given facets and studying their defect effect on electrocatalytic properties remains a great challenge. Here this study deliberately introduces oxygen defects into single-crystalline ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets with O-terminated {111} facets by mild solvothermal reduction using ethylene glycol under alkaline condition. As-prepared defect-rich Co3O4 nanosheets show a low overpotential of 220 mV with a small Tafel slope of 49.1 mV dec(-1) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is among the best Co-based OER catalysts to date and even more active than the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst. Such vacancy defects are formed by balancing with reducing environments under solvothermal conditions, but are surprisingly stable even after 1000 cycles of scanning under OER working conditions. Density functional theory plus U calculation attributes the enhanced performance to the oxygen vacancies and consequently exposed second-layered Co metal sites, which leads to the lowered OER activation energy of 2.26 eV and improved electrical conductivity. This mild solvothermal reduction concept opens a new door for the understanding and future designing of advanced defect-based electrocatalysts.									342	22	0	0	11	0	344			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000423342400011

Among all the materials capable of catalyzing OER, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) stand out as one of the most effective electrocatalysts owing to their compositional and structural flexibility as well as the tenability and the simplicity of their preparation process. For this reason, numerous efforts have been dedicated to adjusting the structure, forming the well-defined morphology, and developing the preparation methods of LDHs to promote their electrocatalytic performance. In this article, recent advances in the rational design of LDH-based electrocatalysts toward OER are summarized. Specifically, various tactics for the synthetic methods, as well as structural and composition regulations of LDHs, are further highlighted, followed by a discussion on the influential factors for OER performance. Finally, the remaining challenges to investigate and improve the catalyzing ability of LDH electrocatalysts are stated to indicate possible future development of LDHs.									405	30	0	0	24	0	406			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000471338400003

A facile and ultrafast two-step method was developed to prepare a Ni/NiO@CoFe layered double hydroxide hierarchical nanostructure (NCF) within a few minutes by femtosecond laser ablation and electrodeposition. In 1 m KOH solution, the optimized NCF catalysts show a low overpotential of 230 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a low Tafel slope of 34.3 mV dec(-1), indicating fast and efficient OER kinetics. Owing to the synergistic effect between NiO and CoFe layered double hydroxide, the hydrogen evolution reaction performance of the NCF was also improved. The synthesized electrocatalysts were further utilized in overall water splitting with a potential of only 1.56 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent durability, better than that of the commercial RuO2(+)//Pt/C(-) system. The present work provides new insights on the rapid and facile preparation of efficient electrocatalysts for overall water splitting on a large scale.									26	2	0	0	1	0	27			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000478761200035	31020771

The time evolution of degradation of trifluralin (I) and the aforementioned three main photoproducts was studied in water and acetonitrile as solvents. The pseudo-first order rate constants allow one to calculate the branching ratios for some of the reactions involved. The preference for either N-dealkylation or cyclization depends on the solvent employed. Dissolved oxygen accelerates the photodegradation, especially the dealkylation.									16	0	0	0	9	0	16			1474-905X	1474-9092		WOS:000232845900003	16252042

In this paper, a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst Co parallel to MnCo2O4.5/NC with heterostructure and oxygen vacancies is prepared utilizing solid reaction in-situ. The optimal catalyst is obtained at 650 degrees C with the mass ratio (1:8) of MnCo2O4 s and Dicyandiamide (DCD). It shows excellent electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with high half-wave potential (0.81 V) and limit current density (6.22 mA cm(-2)), which is better than that of the commercial 20% Pt/C(0.81 V, 5.52 mA cm(-2)). At the same time, it also exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with low overpotential (330 mV) and a faster dynamics process. The superior electrocatalytic properties may be resulted from the presence of heterostructure and increasing ratio of oxygen vacancies, which helps to the rapid transfer of electrons and creates more active sites. Moreover, the self-generated N-doped carbon provides high conductivity of the as-prepared Co parallel to MnCo2O4.5/NC composite. It can be seen that the application of interface engineering technologies is useful for improving the performance of the catalyst, providing an effective and facile synthesis strategy for non-noble metal catalyst.

Herein, we synthesized nickel-doped pyrrhotite iron sulfide (Fe0.95-xNixS1.05) nanosheetsviaa one-pot synthetic route. When tested for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in alkaline solutions, the as-prepared Fe(0.8)Ni(0.15)S(1.05)catalyst exhibited superior electrocatalytic performance to commercial IrO(2)with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)at an overpotential of 228 mV, and a Tafel slope of 53 mV dec(-1).

Thus, it is of great significance to develop highly active and stable OER catalyst for alkaline water electrolysis or to substitute the more kinetically demanding acidic OER with a facile electron-donating reaction such that OER is no longer the bottleneck half-reaction for either acidic or alkaline water electrolysis. Herein, the hierarchical Fe-Ni phosphide shelled with ultrathin carbon networks on Ni foam (FeNiP@C) is reported and shows exceptional OER activity and enhanced chemical stability in 1 M KOH. This unique electrode provides large active sites, facile electron transport pathways, and rapid gas release, resulting in a remarkable OER activity that delivers a current density of 100 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of 182 mV with a Tafel slope of 56 mV/dec. Combining the hydrogen evolution reaction with organic pollutant (methylene blue) oxidation, a multifunctional electrolyzer for simultaneous cost-effective hydrogen generation and organic pollutant decomposition in acid wastewater is proposed. Our strategies in this work provide attractive opportunities in energy- and environment-related fields.									82	5	0	0	3	0	82			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000427910800039	29446613

High-resolution X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are consistent with the formation of cobalt vacancies at tetrahedral sites and an increase in the lattice parameter of Co3O4 after the laser treatment. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) further reveal increased disorder in the structure and a slight decrease in the average oxidation state of the cobalt oxide. Molecular dynamics simulation confirms the surface restructuring upon laser post-treatment on Co3O4. Importantly, the defect-induced PLPP was shown to lower the charge transfer resistance and boost the oxygen evolution activity of Co3O4. For the optimized sample, a 2-fold increment of current density at 1.7 V vs RHE is obtained and the overpotential at 10 mA/cm(2) decreases remarkably from 405 to 357 mV compared to pristine Co3O4. Post-mortem characterization reveals that the material retains its activity, morphology, and phase structure after a prolonged stability test.									10	0	0	0	0	0	9			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000718271300017	34323466

In this work, a cobalt covalent doping approach capable of inducing HER and OER bifunctionality into MoS2 for efficient overall water splitting is reported. The results demonstrate that covalently doping cobalt into MoS2 can lead to dramatically enhanced HER activity while simultaneously inducing remarkable OER activity. The catalyst with optimal cobalt doping density can readily achieve HER and OER onset potentials of -0.02 and 1.45 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) in 1.0 m KOH.

In this work, synergism effect of iron and copper is investigated for the oxygen evolution reaction. Here we reported the facile synthesis of microspheres of CuOx decorated with dendritic nanoarrays of FeOx (3% FeOx@CuOx) via spray coated on the FTO substrate used as an OER electrocatalyst. As oxides of copper (CuOx) are resistive to undergo oxidation, therefore act as strong platform where, heterostructures 3% FeOx@CuOx expose numerous active sites as well as the synergistic effect of copper and iron can catalyze the OER reaction at low overpotential and increases the durability of electrocatalyst as well. Moreover the optimization of Fe ions concentration mediate the electrochemical active surface area and intrinsic activity of electrocatalyst. Interestingly, it is found that after electrochemical oxidation by continuous CV cycling in 1.0 M KOH solution promotes the OER performance. The synthesized electrode obtain current density of 10 mAcm(-2) and 80 mAcm(-2) at low overpotential of 257 mV and 320 mV respectively, with small tafel slope (37 mVdec(-1)) for 3% FeOx@CuOx as compared to 3% FeOx@Cu2O. Moreover, the increase in electrochemical surface area and intrinsic activity of resultant material 3% FeOx@CuOx enhances considerably. Both experimental and computational studies indicate the auspicious surface properties for the adsorption and desorption of intermediates involved in the OER process. This can be attributed to the phase transformation of Cu2O to CuO during electrochemical oxidation process, changing the electronic structure of active sites which led to the generation of Oxides/hydroxides of iron and enhancing the Fe-O bonding, overall benefiting the OER process. The activity of optimized 3% FeOx@CuOx is comparable to the state of electrocatalyst RuO2.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000783242000001

Lyons, Michael/AAG-2445-2022; Lyons, Michael/AFK-3652-2022	Lyons, Mike/0000-0002-0320-7547			The significance of electrochemical impedance spectra recorded during active oxygen evolution for oxide covered Ni, Co and Fe electrodes in alkaline solution								JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				631	1-2			62	70		10.1016/j.jelechem.2009.03.019				JUN 1 2009	2009	Although the mechanism for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is likely to be similar for oxidised electrodes of the adjacent transition metals Ni, Co and Fe, the electrochemical impedance spectra, recorded for each of these anodes during oxygen evolution in 1.0 M NaOH, are significantly different in appearance. This impedance data is analysed using an approach similar to that of Cahan and Chen [B.D. Cahan, C.T. Chen, J. Electrochem. Soc. 129 (1982) 700-705] in an earlier important article on this topic. A controversial proposal by these workers that OER "Tafel slopes" (measured by either ac or dc techniques) for many electrode systems are not in fact characteristic of the kinetics of the reaction, but instead of the potential dependent conductivity of the oxide, is dismissed on the basis of our data. In the case of Co, however, it is found that the kinetics of the OER are masked by a dominant low frequency pseudo-capacitance, arising most likely from a non-homogeneous surface charge distribution associated with the oxidation of Co(III)Co(IV) oxy-hydroxide species. A consistent interpretation of the data is provided, which envisages that Fe exhibits the most general impedance response with the spectra for the other anodes taking the form of limiting cases. Consideration is also given to the most appropriate choice of equivalent circuit model (with a firm physical basis) to aid our understanding of the complex interface at which oxygen evolution proceeds.

Herein, a class of CoSe2 nano-vesicle that derived from ZIF-67 nanocubes is fabricated by a facile one-pot hydrothermal method. Benefitting from the hollow structure, abundant oxygen vacancies, strong synergistic effect between Co and Se, and facilitated electron transfer rate, the optimized CoSe2-30 exhibits excellent OER performance with a low overpotential of 287 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and small Tafel slope of 54.3 mV dec(-1), which is much superior to the reported OER electrocatalyst derived from ZIF-67 via complicated prepared method. In addition, these electrocatalysts can also maintain original current density and voltage after long-term chronoamperometry and chronopotentiometry tests, respectively. This work demonstrates a favorable hydrothermal method for transforming cubic ZIF-67 nanocrystal structure into hollow CoSe2 nano-vesicle with excellent electrocatalytic performance for OER and thus opens up a sunshine road for the practical applications of water electrolysis.									45	2	0	0	3	0	46			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000502040600154

Herein, the single-atom In-doped subnanometer Pt nanowires (SA In-Pt NWs) as high-performance electrocatalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and EOR under universal pH conditions is designed. The SA In-Pt NWs/C can be employed to integrate HER with EOR to avoid the large overpotential caused by sluggish OER, which requires a smaller voltage of 0.62 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2)compared with that of water splitting (2.07 V). The reaction also exhibits a high faradaic efficiency of over 93% in upgrading ethanol to valuable acetate in the anodic cell. Mechanistic investigations indicate that the combination of the ultrathin 1D morphology and single-atom In decoration provides the maximum number of active sites and effectively activates Pt atoms for catalysis. Density functional theory calculations further demonstrate that doped In can effectively promote the HER, while also promoting the conversion of ethanol to acetate. Moreover, through the use of SA In-Pt NWs/C as electrocatalysts, many other alcohols can also be employed as anodic feedstock to achieve coupled electrolysis.									35	3	0	0	4	0	35			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000567834800001

However, problems arose that the conventional electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution may produce extensive by-products of reactive oxygen species and cause severe metal leaching, both of which induce strong toxicity toward microorganisms. Moreover, poor stability of electrocatalysts cannot be qualified for long-term operation. These problems may result in poor biocompatibility between electrocatalysts and microorganisms. To solve the bottleneck problem, Co anchored on porphyrinic triazine-based frameworks was synthesized as the electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution and further coupled with Cupriavidus necator H16. It showed high selectivity for a four-electron pathway of oxygen reduction reaction and low production of reactive oxygen species, owing to the synergistic effect of Co-N-x modulating the charge distribution and adsorption energy of intermediates. Additionally, low metal leaching and excellent stability were observed, which may be attributed to low content of Co and the stabilizing effect of metalloporphyrins. Hence, the electrocatalyst exhibited excellent biocompatibility. Finally, the microbial electrosynthesis system equipped with the electrocatalyst successfully converted CO2 to poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate. This work drew up a novel strategy for enhancing the biocompatibility of electrocatalysts in microbial electrosynthesis system.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-0179	2095-0187		WOS:000864315100001

However, effective manipulation of the quantity and quality of heterointerfaces in two-dimensional (2D) lateral nanoscale is still an extremely urgent but daunting task. Herein, cobalt molybdenum phosphide hybrid nanosheets (Co-Mo-P NSs) are tactfully constructed via a successive phosphidation strategy. The as-created multinary heterointerfaces and their synergistic effects can optimize the hydrogen adsorption/desorption energy (Delta G(H*)), as evidenced by density functional theory calculations, and improve the reaction kinetics. Moreover, the unique ultrathin nanosheet can maximize the exposure of interior atoms and heterointerfaces as reaction sites for catalysis, thus co-facilitating intrinsic catalytic activities. As an encouraging result, the optimized Co-Mo-P NSs exhibit considerable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance, particularly with a 5.5 and 3.0 times higher turnover frequency than bare MoP and CoP, respectively. Moreover, it also exhibits superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity (eta(10) = 261.9 mV) and profound full water decomposition behavior. This research proposes a facile strategy to controllably construct multinary heterointerfaces within 2D transition metal phosphide nanosheets, which might provide new insights into designing other advanced electrocatalysts.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			2398-4902			WOS:000661178100001

Regulation of the geometrical structures of the spinel oxides is one of the most effective approaches for enhancing their OER performance. However, more wide and deep investigations remain because of the structural complexity of spinel oxides, for example, how to fill the unoccupied octahedral interstices to construct a large number of active sites for boosting the OER. Herein, iron foam (IF) supported NiFe2O4 nanocubes with high occupancy at octahedral sites (HOoct-NFO NC/IF) are synthesized by hydrothermal method followed by anchoring and annealing. Detailed structural characterizations indicate that the foreign Fe cations can be filled into the octahedral interstices along the geometrical defects channel of transition metal cations coordinated with six oxygen anions (TMO6) by etching TMO6 units with an anchoring agent. As a result of the increasing of TMO5 sites with better activity and tuning of the electronic structures, the as-fabricated HOoct-NFO NC/IF electrocatalysts exhibit excellent performance for OER with overpotentials of 260 and 310 mV to reach 10 and 400 mA cm(-2), respectively. Meanwhile, the catalysts show faster kinetics and superior stability.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000786482500001

Herein, sulfur-doped LaNiO3 nanoparticles are elaborately synthesized, and their catalytic activity toward oxygen redox reactions in Li-O2 batteries is comprehensively studied. As confirmed by the density functional theory calculations and experimental results, the substitution of oxygen atoms by sulfur atoms with lower Pauling electronegativity can enhance the covalent feature of bonds, thus increasing electrical conductivity of catalyst. In addition, abundant oxygen vacancies created after sulfur doping are capable of providing concentrated active sites. Simultaneously, sulfur dopants boost the hybridization between Ni 3d orbital and O 2p orbital and increase the covalency of Ni-O bonds due to the increase of Ni3thorn with the near-unity occupancy of the eg orbital, thereby increasing the adsorption strength of oxygen-containing intermediates on the surface. Eventually, lowered reaction energy barriers and accelerated reaction kinetics of oxygen electrode reactions are realized, contributing to the optimized electrochemical performance of Li-O2 battery. The Li-O2 battery based on sulfur-doped LaNiO3 with the optimized S-doping level of 2.89 wt% (marked as S2.89 wt%-LNO) delivers a high specific discharge capacity of 24067 mAh/g, an ultralow overpotential of 0.37 V and extended life of 347 cycles.

Operando analysis reveals that Fe and Niincorporations not only expedite the dynamic response of self-reconstructions of the Fe,Ni-CoS2surface but also accelerate theoxidation of Co and Fe into high-valence oxyhydroxides while suppressing nickel oxidation to form Ni(OH)2for optimized activityand robust stability.

In recent years, copper(II) coordination compounds have been extensively used for the OER. However, challenges remain in finding the mechanism of the OER in the presence of these metal coordination compounds. Herein, the electrochemical OER activity is investigated in the presence of a copper(II) coordination compound at pH approximate to 7. While the investigations on finding true catalysts for the OER are focused on the working electrode, herein, for the first time, the focus is on the decomposition of copper(II) coordination compound (CuL3, L: 2,2 '-bipyridine N,N '-dioxide) during the OER on the counter electrode toward the precipitation of copper(i) oxide and metallic Cu.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000829501200001	35876690

Here, we combine the concepts of relative and optimal photonic efficiencies to normalize activities with an internal benchmark material, RuO2 photodeposited on a P25-TiO2 photocatalyst, which was optimized for reproducibility of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Additionally, a general set of good practices was identified to ensure reliable quantification of photocatalytic OER, including photoreactor design, photocatalyst dispersion, and control of parasitic reactions caused by the sacrificial electron acceptor. Moreover, a method combining optical modeling and measurements was proposed to quantify the benchmark absorbed and scattered light (7.6% and 81.2%, respectively, of lambda = 300-500 nm incident photons), rather than just incident light (approximate to AM1.5G), to estimate its internal quantum efficiency (16%). We advocate the adoption of the instrumental and theoretical framework provided here to facilitatematerial standardization and comparison in the field of artificial photosynthesis.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2590-2393	2590-2385		WOS:000555892900015	32803152

Here, we describe the development of a hierarchical CuO@NiCo layered double hydroxide core-shell nanoarray on copper foil (CuO@NiCo LDH/CF) as a 3D OER electrocatalyst. When tested in 1.0 M KOH, such CuO@NiCo LDH/CF offers superior catalytic activity with a geometrical catalytic current density of 20 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of only 256 mV.

Herein, we demonstrated that N-incorporation could efficiently activate NiFeOx catalysts for significantly enhancing the oxygen evolution activity and stability of BiVO4 photoanodes, and the photocurrent density has been achieved up to 6.4 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), AM 1.5 G). Systematic studies indicate that the partial substitution of O sites in NiFeOx catalysts by low electronegative N atoms enriched the electron densities in both Fe and Ni sites. The electron-enriched Ni sites conversely donated electrons to V sites of BiVO4 for restraining V5+ dissolution and improving the PEC stability, while the enhanced hole-attracting ability of Fe sites significantly promotes the oxygen-evolution activity. This work provides a promising strategy for optimizing OER catalysts to construct highly efficient and stable PEC water splitting devices.While solar-to-fuel conversion offers a renewable energy production strategy, photoelectrochemical water splitting requires further optimization. Here, authors examined nitrogen-doped NiFeOx catalysts to improve the oxygen evolution activity and stability of BiVO4 photoanodes.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22				2041-1723		WOS:000723756500020	34845221

MIL-53(Cu) was synthesized by a hydrothermal approach using 1,4-bezenedicarboxylic acid as organic precursor and further annealed at 300 degrees C to form CuO nanostructures on its surface. The produced electrocatalyst, CuO@MIL-53(Cu), was characterized using various techniques. Under alkaline conditions, the developed electrocatalyst exhibited an overpotential of 801 and 336 mV versus RHE at 10 and 1 mA cm(-2), respectively. The reproducibility of the catalytic performance was validated using several electrodes. It was confirmed that the CuO hair-like nanostructures grown on MIL-53(Cu) using thermal treatment exhibit high OER activity, good kinetics and durability.

In the latter case elimination of one volt out of a theoretical maximum of 1.34V (in case of hydrogen evolution electrode) provides very significant energy savings. Here we report iron based Fe-N-x catalyst with promising activity compared to state of the art noble metal catalysts (RhxSy) for hydrochloric acid recovery systems. A combined electrochemical and synchrotron-based spectroscopic approach is used to probe the structural and elec tronic properties of the active centers. The surface sensitive delta-mu (Delta m) analysis of the near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS), supported by first-principles calculations, reveals the immunity of the Fe-N-x-C-y active centers to chloride poisoning. Initial stability studies show that even after a harsh corrosive treatment, the catalyst ORR activity remains comparable to the current state of the art precious based material. Our study opens up promising avenues for developing affordable and robust oxygen consuming electrodes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

One such attempt at finding effective renewable energy is recycling of lithium-ion batteries and using the recycled material as an electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) step in water splitting reactions. In electrocatalysis, the OER plays a crucial role and several electrocatalysts have been investigated to improve the efficiency of O-2 gas evolution. Present research involves the use of citric acid coupled with lemon peel extracts for efficient recovery of lithium cobaltate from waste lithium-ion batteries and subsequent use of the recovered cathode material for OER in water splitting. Optimum recovery was achieved at 90 degrees C within 3 h of treatment with 1.5 M citric acid and 1.5% extract volume. The consequent electrode materials were calcined at 600, 700 and 800 degrees C and compared to the untreated waste material calcined at 600 degrees C for OER activity. The treated material recovered and calcined at 600 degrees C was the best among all of the samples for OER activity. Its average particle size was estimated to be within the 20-100 nm range and required a low overpotential of 0.55 V vs. RHE for the current density to reach 10 mA/cm(2) with a Tafel value of 128 mV/dec.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2079-4991		WOS:000736694000001	34947692

Both the CoTe2 with nanodendrite and CoTe with nanosheet morphologies on the CoTe2 nanotube (CoTe2 NDs/CoTe2 NTs and CoTe NSs/CoTe2 NTs) supported by CFP exhibit high activities toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Particularly, the CoTe NSs/CoTe2 NTs only require an overpotential of 230.0 mV to deliver the current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in acid solution. After cycling for 5000 cycles or 20 h continual electrolysis, only a small performance loss is observed.									99	4	0	0	3	0	99			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000370211400004	26809181

Three surface oxidized nickel borides of Ni-B-O@Ni3B, Ni-B-O@Ni2B and Ni-B-O@NiB2 electrocatalysts have been prepared and investigated. Surface oxidation, which is inevitable for the bifunctional nickel borides, promotes the activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but leads to activity degradation for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Meanwhile, boron is found to play a crucial role in the oxidation of nickel, facilitating the formation of an active intermediate for the OER. Ni-B-O@Ni3B turns out to be the best bifunctional electrocatalyst. An alkaline electrolyzer constructed using Ni-B-O@Ni3B electrodes as both anode and cathode has achieved a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.58 V for overall water splitting with satisfied durability, rivaling the integrated noble metal electrode.									21	2	0	0	0	0	22			2196-0216			WOS:000458972400022

Here, an interface strategy is proposed to prepare a free-standing copper-cobalt-nickel nitride electrode,in which copper-cobalt-nickel nitride is anchored on hydrophilic treated nickel foam. Compared to bi-metal hierarchical catalysts, the as-fabricated epitaxial heterostructure shows excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with an ultralow overpotential of 190 mV, as well as an overpotential of 63 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the current density of 10 mA cm-2. Most importantly, the modified tri-metal nitrides exhibit improved interfacial compatibility due to the interfacial defects, which can increase electron transport across the junction during the catalytic reactions. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the synergistic effect between copper, cobalt, and nickel nitride creates a proper electronic structure that lowers the reaction barriers of HER/OER.

The polypeptide core also tunes the redox potentials of cofactors and provides for unidirectional progress of various reaction steps.

The resulting metal-nitrogen complexed carbon showed outstanding catalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solutions. At an overpotential of 380 mV, the optimal sample yielded a current density of 83.6 mAcm(-2), which is 2.5 times that of benchmark IrO2 (32.8mA cm(-2)), rendering it as one of the best OER catalysts reported so far. It also showed negligible activity decay in alkaline solutions during long-term durability tests. Control experiments and X-ray absorption fine structure analyses revealed that Fe-N-x species in the samples are the active sites for OER. Further density functional theory calculations indicated that the presence of sulfur in the carbon matrix modified the electronic structures of active species, thereby leading to the superior activity of the sample.

We find that N-SMCTs@N-rGO yields superior bifunctional ORR/OER activity with high durability (E-1/2 of 0.87 V for ORR, eta(10) of 351 mV for OER). Moreover, the zinc-air battery with this material as an electrode displays high power density of 126 mW cm(-2) with excellent cycle stability. Density functional theory (DFT) unveils a dual-site mechanism: the carbon adjacent to graphitic-N in N-SMCTs is the most active site for *OOH intermediate while the carbon neighboring to pyridinic-N in N-rGO is beneficial for the adsorption of *O/*OH intermediates. The unique active-active interface with dual-site mechanism suggests its potential to overcome energy barrier bottleneck in the traditional bifunctional oxygen catalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000770869500001

In order to further decrease the cost of the catalysts, cobalt-copper-iron trimetal sulfides (CoCuFe-S) are designed and successfully fabricated via a simple hydrothermal method following a thermal treatment. CoCuFe-S has a three-dimensional nanostructure, which is assembled by numerous nanosheets. Three components are uniformly distributed in the composite. CoCuFe-S with different ratios are employed as OER catalysts and compared with pure Co9S8,CuS and FeS. The optimal CoCuFe-S-8 catalyst exhibits high and robust activity for OER with a small overpotential of 0.30 V at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 79 mV.dec(-1). The turnover frequency is 0.27 s(-1) and the mass activity is 114Ag(-1) at overpotential of 0.30 V, even better than the commercial RuO2. In addition, CoCuFe-S-8 catalyst showed long-term durability under 1 M KOH solution. The excellent OER performance may result from the synergistic effect among the three sulfides. The introduction of FeS and CuS are beneficial for the formation of Co9S8, increasing the conductivity of the catalyst and decreased the adsorption of the oxygen atoms on Co atom.

The electrocatalytical results can be attributed to both cationic composition of the oxide and electrode manufacturing. In order to study separately the surface area effects and the intrinsic catalytic nature, Cu1+xMn2-xO4(1.4 greater than or equal to 1 + x greater than or equal to 1) spinel oxides were synthesized by two different ways: spray pyrolysis and, thermal decomposition of metallic salts. The oxides obtained were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), electrical conductivity and pzc (pH of zero charge) measurements. Five types of electrodes were obtained from the electrocatalytic candidate material. Their electrochemically accessible surface area (easa) was determined using Zn2+ adsorption and kinetic measurements of a simple redox couple; results of which were in good agreement. The electrocatalytical activity of electrode materials was evaluated studying the oer (oxygen evolution reaction) in 1M KOH. The activity was found to be dependent of the surface area effects and (Mn3+ + Mn4+) ions stoichiometry (octahedrally co-ordinated with oxygen atoms in spinel structure). The possibility that information about the structure of the bulk oxide can be extrapolated to the surface is emphasized.

The role of structural behavior of obtained specimens and corresponding electrochemical performances were characterized through X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, while cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were analyzed for electrochemical measurements and evaluation of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) along with oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The electrochemical studies have shown that these materials exhibit reasonable performance for both the ORR and the OER. The findings concluded that the Si/CB base catalyst has shown both OER and ORR activities in comparison to Si/MWCNTs and Si/NCNTs where only ORR performance was monitored. However, Si/NCNTs have shown much higher ORR activity compared to the others. This work highlights the comparison of three possible alternative materials as a potential catalyst to develop optimum alternatives of Pt-free catalysts for fuel cell and lithium-based battery systems.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2523-3963	2523-3971		WOS:000494952200023

For this aim, nano X zeolite (NXZ) is first synthesized through a hydrothermal method using silica extracted from the agro waste stem sweep and then employed as a stabilizing matrix for AuNi bimetallic nanoparticles. The unique porous structure of NXZ is beneficial to suppress the aggregation of AuNi bimetallic nanoparticles and improve their performance in the catalytic process. Furthermore, the tendency for the promotion of OER catalytic activity is manifested by the incorporation of AuNiNXZ with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MVVCNTs). After optimization of AuNiNXZ and MWCNT contents in the carbon paste electrode (25 wt % AuNiNXZ and 25 wt % MWCNT), the catalyst with improved activity just needs a low overpotential of 210 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER, providing a small Tafel slope of 48 mV dec(-1) and great stability during a 12 h period in a chronoamperometry test. The availability of more bimetallic active sites and good electrical conductivity of the catalyst are because of the presence of both NXZ and MWCNT, respectively, which account for its superior OER activity with excellent durability.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2168-0485			WOS:000503330400008

Herein, an effective phosphorus-modified hollow porous Nickel-Cobalt oxides nanocube was prepared by thermal oxidation and partial phosphorization processes. The optimal P-NiO/NiCo2O4 nanocube disclosed remarkable electrochemical activity for OER in 1.0 M KOH with a low overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 49.6 mV dec-1, and good long-life stability for 20 h. Based on the experimental and theoretical calculation results, the introduction of P was proved to be the key to the excellent electrochemical activity for OER. P doping could optimize the ad-sorption of the intermediates, decrease the energy barrier and change the rate-determining step. Meanwhile, the P-dopant could modulate the electronic structure and enhance the conductivity of NiO/ NiCo2O4. In addition, hollow, porous hybrid structure and oxygen vacancies could increase the number of active sites exposed, and facilitate the ion transport. The present work provides a valuable strategy to design transition-metal oxide based electrocatalysts with enhanced electrocatalytic performances by controlling partial P doping.

The modified Ni-Mo-based materials exhibited excellent catalytic performance in KOH solution by adjusting the amount of Pt introduced. Due to the introduction of platinum, a large number of defects are formed, thereby improving the performance of the catalyst. At a current density of 100 mA cm(-2), overpotentials of 242 and 448 mV are required for the hydrogen evolution reaction and the oxygen evolution reaction, respectively. The system needs a cell voltage of 1.58 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). In addition, the material exhibits good stability for up to 45 hours, which is considered high for bifunctional electrocatalysts. In addition, the effects of hydrothermal and immersion methods on the catalytic performance of platinum were explored. The immersion method shows a strong potential.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000686296400001

Herein, a novel hollow urchin-like TiO2 nanomaterial with Pt loaded on the inner surface and RuO2 on the outer surface is reported. The Pt acts as the electron capture centre and is responsible for the reduction reaction, whereas the RuO2 acts as the holetrapping centre for the oxidation reaction. Compared to nanospheres, the urchin-like structures have a larger specific surface area. Moreover, the as-prepared TiO2 contained numerous single-electron oxygen vacancies (Vo center dot). The synergy between the highly dispersed catalytic material and spatially separated dual cocatalysts, characterised by hollow structures, a large specific surface area, and oxygen vacancies, greatly increased the activity of the catalyst. When Pt (0.5 wt%) is loaded on the inner surface of the nanomaterials, the hydrogen evolution rate is as high as 2045.1 mu molg(-1) h(-1); moreover, it further improves to 3904.0 mu molg(-1) h(-1) when RuO2 is loaded on the outer shell.

In this work, a facile solid-state synthesis strategy is developed to construct the interfacial engineering of W2N/WC heterostructures, in which abundant interfaces are formed. Under high temperature (800 degrees C), volatile CNx species from dicyanodiamide are trapped by WO3 nanorods, followed by simultaneous nitridation and carbonization, to form W2N/WC heterostructure catalysts. The resultant W2N/WC heterostructure catalysts exhibit an efficient and stable electrocatalytic performance toward the ORR, OER, and HER, including a half-wave potential of 0.81 V (ORR) and a low overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER (320 mV) and HER (148.5 mV). Furthermore, a W2N/WC-based Zn-air battery shows outstanding high power density (172 mW cm(-2)). Density functional theory and X-ray absorption fine structure analysis computations reveal that W2N/WC interfaces synergistically facilitate transport and separation of charge, thus accelerating the electrochemical ORR, OER, and HER. This work paves a novel avenue for constructing efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts for electrochemical energy devices.									236	17	0	0	14	0	236			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000496844000001	31736168

Since catalysis is strongly dependent on surface areas, texture and structural homogeneity, the development of effective modes of preparation of perovskites is of utmost importance for the achievement of high performances, especially for electrochemical applications in fuel cells and metal/air batteries. The precipitation reaction method for the synthesis of La0.1Ca0.9MnO3 at low temperatures in the presence of alkaline support electrolyte has shown significant gain in the surface and electrochemical properties. Enhanced BET-surface area of this production method as compared to the dry pyrolysis method was obtained. Multifunctional application for cathodic reactions in alkaline fuel cell (AFC) and intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC) as well as for bifunctional systems of both oxygen reduction reaction (orr) and oxygen evolution reaction (oer) has been investigated. Parameter optimisations of the ingoing materials and analyses of the solid-state properties of the catalyst pertaining to structural, chemical and surface characteristics have also been carried out.					5th International Conference on Processing and Manufacturing of Advanced Materials5th International Conference on Processing and Manufacturing of Advanced Materials	JUL 04-08, 2006JUL 04-08, 2006	Minerals, Met & Mat SocMinerals, Met & Mat Soc	Vancouver, CANADAVancouver, CANADA	5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0255-5476		978-0-87849-428-6	WOS:000245106101052

Fixed potential holds and potential cycling were applied to probe the durability of Ir nanoparticles, and performance losses were found to be driven by particle growth (coarsening) at moderate potential (1.4 to 1.6V) and Ir dissolution at higher potential (>= 1.8V). Several different commercially available samples were evaluated and standardized conditions for performance comparison are reported. The electrocatalyst RDE results have also been compared to results obtained for performance and durability in electrolysis cells. (C) The Author(s) 2016. Published by ECS.

However, the knowledge of the intrinsic activity, such as the rate-law of the water oxidation reactions, has been inadequately studied. Up to date, the highest order reported is the third one under photoelectrochemical condition. In this work, we identified the fourth-order charge decay reactions on hematite by using a time-resolved surface photovoltage probe technique. A theoretical turnover frequency (TOF) > 100 nm(-2).s(-1) can be expected for O-2 molecules when the hole density >0.1 nm(-2). This work demonstrates a facile and robust method to investigate the high-order reaction kinetics. More excitingly, this research built the bridge between the rate-law, rate-determining step, and energy barrier of intermediates.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2589-0042		WOS:000740243900004	34934920

Transition metal composites have emerged as exceptional electrocatalysts for water splitting; however, their practical implementation is hindered by their low conversion efficiency and poor long-term stability. Tuning the electronic structure of transition metal-based electrocatalysts by introducing additional anions, which possess different electronegativities and sizes as compared to the parent anion, is a rational strategy for enhancing the electrochemical performance. In this review, we attempt to review the recent progress on anion-mediated multi-anion transition metal electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and overall water-splitting process. A brief overview of anion-containing transition metal-based electrocatalysts is presented, followed by recent advance surveys in the design of multi-anion-doped transition metal electrocatalysts for high electrochemical performances. The rationale behind the utilization of anion regulation to tune the electrocatalyst properties is described by combined theoretical and experimental approaches. Finally, we discuss the challenges to be addressed and the steps to be taken toward further advancing this research area to achieve affordable carbon-free hydrogen generation in the future.

To intensify transfer and increase reaction active sites as well as decrease polarization, binder-free flexible three-dimensional porous oxygen electrodes were prepared by in situ deposition and decomposition of ZIF-67 on graphite foam (GF). Compared with GF, the modified sample has a much more stable discharge platform, lower charge/discharge polarization, higher reversibility, and higher reaction activity during oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction processes. The current densities of the reduction peak and oxidation peak of the pristine GF can be improved by a ZIF-67 derivative about 794 and 1367%, respectively. After 100 cycles at 0.1 mA.cm(-2), the R-ct of GF is decreased about 52% by the ZIF-67 derivative. The work paves a promising strategy for oxygen electrodes by combining absorption and electrocatalysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0888-5885			WOS:000706190000009

In a PEMWE the anode is the most complex electrode to study due to the high overpotential of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), not widely understood. A physical bottom-up multi-scale transient model describing the operation of a PEMWE anode is proposed here. This model includes a detailed description of the elementary OER kinetics in the anode, a description of the non-equilibrium behavior of the nanoscale catalyst-electrolyte interface, and a microstructural-resolved description of the transport of charges and O-2 at the micro and mesoscales along the whole anode. The impact of different catalyst materials on the performance of the PEMWE anode, and a study of sensitivity to the operation conditions are evaluated from numerical simulations and the results are discussed in comparison with experimental data.									26	0	0	0	1	0	26			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000305965200018	22724123

In order to achieve the desirable qualities, rational construction of the structure and chemical composition of electrocatalysts is of fundamental importance. Herein, petal-like structure Ni0.33Co0.67P shells grown on conductive silver nanowires (Ag NWs) cores as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting were synthesized through a facile hydrothermal method and phosphorization. The resultant three-dimensional core-shell petal-like structure Ag NWs@Ni0.33Co0.67P possesses excellent catalytic activities in alkaline conditions with the overpotential of 259 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), 121 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and a full cell voltage of 1.64 V to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Highly conductive Ag NWs as cores and high surface area petal-like Ni0.33Co0.67P as shells can endow outstanding catalytic performance for the bifunctional electrocatalyst. Thus, the synthetic strategy of the three-dimensional core-shell structure Ag NWs@Ni0.33Co0.67P considerably advances the practice of Ag NWs toward electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2079-4991		WOS:000780562500001	35407323

At present, the development of high-efficiency bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts is still a puzzling challenge. Herein, we propose a scalable strategy for embedding and beading ZIF-derived hollow Co-N-x nanocube cage dispersion implanted with porous carbonized nanofibers (EH/PCNFs and BH/PCNFs) through electrospinning and annealing. The cobalt species prevent themselves from agglomerating during the annealing process through the "fence" effect of the non-volatile Zn species, thereby synergizing with ligand volatilization to facilitate the formation of Co-N-x nanocube cages. Benefiting from the ultralong interconnected multi-layered carbon nanofiber matrix, the hollow Co-N-x nanocube cages can change the charge density and electron distribution of the carbon nanofiber matrix, endowing the carbonized nanofiber carrier with special surface polarization and accelerating the electrocatalytic kinetics. Remarkably, the integrated Li-O-2 batteries (LOBs) based on BH/PCNFs and EH/PCNFs electrodes exhibit significantly decreased charge/discharge polarization (0.79 V) and a long-term cyclability (147 cycles) under a cut off capacity of 500 mA h g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1).

This reaction was modelled by taking into account the two dissociation reactions of dissolved CO,. The mathematical problem was solved numerically using a finite element method (FEM). A fair agreement between the measurements performed on a steel rotating disc electrode and the theoretical calculations was obtained. Thus, the cathodic behaviour of steel in CO2-containing solutions can be fully explained by the buffering effect induced by the presence Of CO2. Some interfacial pH measurements performed on a gold electrode also support this conclusion. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									80	6	0	0	0	0	84			0010-938X			WOS:000256184800027

These oxides are characterized by XRD and show pure nanocrystalline phase of Co3O4 with no separated peaks related to Ni/NiOx and confirms that Ni has been substituted in the lattice. TEM results indicate that the morphology and size of all the compounds are similar. Electrochemical measurements indicate that Co3O4: Co3-xNixO4 are active for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and also shows that low amount of nickel doping in Co3O4 can remarkably enhance OER activity in neutral, alkaline and buffer (pH-7) electrolytes. Out of all compositions, 0.5% Ni-doped Co3O4 (CO2.985Ni0.015O4) seems to be more active than Co3O4 in terms of both current density and onset potential in K2SO4 medium. The enhancement in terms of OER activity, however, decreases until the doping concentration reaches beyond 0.5%. Phosphate buffer solution (PBS) studies reveal that Co3O4 and 0.5% Ni-doped Co3O4 show OER at near thermodynamic potential. Detailed x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies have indicated that surface oxygen (lattice oxygen) concentration is an important factor in deciding the OER activity which is highest for 0.5% Ni doped Co3O4 (CO2.985Ni0.015O4) and hence gives the highest OER activity.									10	0	0	0	0	1	12			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000443664700058

Herein, the facile preparation of Ni single atoms embedded hollow S/N-doped carbon macroporous fibers (Ni SAs@S/N-CMF) as efficient catalysts for OER through pyrolysis of designed CdS-NiSx/polyacrylonitrile composite fibers is reported. Specifically, CdS provides the sulfur source for the doping of polyacrylonitrile-derived carbon matrix and simultaneously creates the hollow macroporous structure, while NiSx is first reduced to nanoparticles and finally evolves into single Ni atoms through the atom migration-trapping strategy. Benefiting from the abundantly exposed single Ni atoms and hollow macroporous structure, the resultant Ni SAs@S/N-CMF electrocatalysts deliver outstanding activity and stability for OER.

Perovskite fluorides are emerging as alternative electrocatalysts for OER, however, their intrinsically active sites during real operation are still elusive. Herein, the self-reconstruction on newly designed Ni-Fe coupled perovskite fluorides during OER process is demonstrated. In situ Raman spectroscopy, ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and theoretical calculation reveal that Fe incorporation can significantly activate the self-reconstruction of perovskite fluorides and efficiently lower the energy barrier of OER. Benefiting from self-reconstruction and low energy barrier, the KNi0.8Fe0.2F3@nickel foam (KNFF2@NF) electrocatalyst delivers an ultralow overpotential of 258 mV to afford 100 mA cm(-2) and an excellent durability for 100 h, favorably rivaling most the state-of-the-art OER electrocatalysts.

Herein, a simple and facile strategy was followed to prepare Ni-substituted MnCo2O4/rGO nanocomposite as an electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The structural and morphological analyses show the successful bonding between spinel-carbon hybrid. Nickel substitution and addition of rGO disclose a drastic change in the catalytic activity of the same towards OER. Among all the electrocatalysts, Mn1-xNixCo2O4/rGO with x = 0.6 exhibits low overpotential of 250 and 290 mV for attaining the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) before and after potential cycling respectively. It also exhibits low onset potential of 1.48 V with a Tafel slope of value 78 mV/dec. The electrocatalyst also shows excellent stability, high ECSA and roughness factor (R-f) which are responsible for enhanced OER performance.

Here, well-defined arrays of vanadium-iron bimetal organic frameworks (VFe-MOF) with controllable stoichiometry have been successfully prepared on nickel foam (NF). The as-fabricated VFe-MOF@NF electrode exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity and durability for OER and HER in alkaline medium. The material's overpotentials of 10 mA/cm(2) are 246 mV for OER and 147 mV for HER, respectively. The electrolyzer made from the VFe-MOF@NF electrodes as both the cathode and anode in 1 mol/L KOH needs only a voltage of 1.61 V to reach a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). The superior performance of VFe-MOF@NF can be attributed to the morphological control and electronic regulation of the bimetals, that is, 1) the exposure of the active sites at electrocatalyst/electrolyte interfaces due to the array structure; 2) the synergistic effect of vanadium and iron metals on electro-catalyzing the overall water splitting.

Fe3O4 NPs show uniform particle size distribution with an average diameter of similar to 5.0 nm. BET surface area and average pore diameter of the nanoparticles were found to be similar to 150 m(2)/g and similar to 3.0 nm, respectively. FTIR, Raman, EDAX and XPS studies were also carried out to confirm the phase purity of the prepared materials. Electrochemical water splitting reactions have been carried out using Fe3O4 NPs as electrocatalysts in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte solution. Polarization studies confirm dual nature of Fe3O4 electro-catalysts in water electrolysis for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Potentiodynamic polarization curves reveal low Tafel values of 295 and 126 mV/dec (+/- 2) for OER and ORR, respectively. The overpotential for water oxidation reaction was found to be -390 mV (+/- 5) at the current density of 1 mA/cm(2) in 0.1 M KOH.

Scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope observations demonstrate that the as-prepared electrocatalyst is composed of graphene sheets with nanoparticles mainly in the size of 20-50 nm, while X-ray diffraction characterization confirms that the sample is composed of multiple species such as carbon, cobalt/iron oxide, cobalt/iron sulfide and metallic iron. The cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammograms tests of the electrocatalyst demonstrate favorable electrocatalytic activity for both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, suggesting its bifunctionality. With the electrocatalyst/Ketjen Black (KB) oxygen electrode applying in LOBs, a specific capacity of 4772 mAh g(KB)(-1) and a discharge plateau potential of similar to 2.75 V are reached at the density of 100 mA gKB(-1) for the related LOBs by discharging to 2.0 V and charging to 4.4 V.

Developing cost-effective electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of foremost importance for these electrochemical conversion devices. Herein, we developed a nonmetallic and cost-effective sulfur-doped SrCoO3-delta perovskite electrocatalyst, namely SrCoO3-x,S-x (x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08 and 0.1, denoted as SCS2, SCS4, SCS6, SCS8 and SCS10, respectively) for water splitting in alkaline solution. Sulfur doping results in a structural change of SrCoO3-delta perovskite from hexagonal to cubic perovskite. The electrochemical performance of this catalyst indicates that an optimal sulfur doping could enhance the conductivity of SrCoO3-delta, resulting in a remarkable improvement on OER activity. The DFT calculation also confirm S doping can improve the electron conduction by lowering the activation energy of electron conductivity. Moreover, the doped SrCoO3-x,S-x, also show enhanced durability due to the stable cubic structure with sulfur substitution. This work offers an inexpensive doping strategy for SrCoO3-delta perovskite as an efficient electrocatalyst for the enhanced electrochemical performance of OER activity in water splitting.

A parametric study is carried out on a lab-scale experimental setup developed based on the essential heat and mass transfer characteristics of actual UCFs to understand the factors influencing the inception and evolution of coal fires. Effects of heat accumulation, moisture content and coal layer height are systematically examined by varying the relevant parameters on the experimental setup. Temporal evolution of coal temperature and volumetric fractions of CO and CO2 are measured and analyzed. The results indicate that heat accumulation, moisture content and coal layer height mainly influence the time needed to reach the ignition state. Without sufficient heat accumulation, coal-oxygen reactions are not self-sustainable even after they enter the rapid reaction stage. The reaction regimes inside the coal tank are mainly determined by the local oxygen concentration, while the temperature changing rate depends on the relative magnitudes of heat generation and heat transfer (gain/loss). The ratio of CO2/CO is more informative in the detection of high-temperature stage of UCFs.									6	2	0	0	1	0	7			0015-2684	1572-8099		WOS:000490829500001

By simply manipulating (electro)chemical gradients using a combined hydrothermal and electrodeposition strategy, we herein show the controlled growth of Co(OH)(2) nanostructures, mimicking the process of garden cultivation. The resulting "nano-garden" can selectively contain different patterns, all of which can be fully phosphidated into CoP without losing the structural integrity. Remarkably, these CoP nanostructures show distinct catalytic performance in oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions. Under pH-universal conditions, the CoP "soil + flower-with-stem" structure shows a much more "effective" surface area for gas-evolving reactions with lower activation and concentration overpotentials. This provides superior bifunctional catalytic activity for both reactions, outperforming noble metal counterparts.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000530495500059

The monolayer is kinetically and thermodynamically stable and shows a small cleavage energy of 0.35 J m(-2), suggesting that it can be prepared by exfoliation from its bulk material, and exhibits a direct band gap of 2.98 eV, which can be engineered by applying strain. The Pd3P2S8 bilayer is an indirect band gap semiconductor with a slightly smaller band gap of 2.83 eV. The photoexcited holes generate favorable driving forces for promoting the specific solar-driven O-2 evolution reaction. The extraordinary electronic properties, pronounced light harvesting capability in the visible and ultraviolet regions and active surface sites render the Pd3P2S8 monolayer and bilayer as compelling 2D materials with interesting application potential for photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic water splitting.									37	0	0	0	1	0	37			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000451813300029

Among them, noble metal free Lanthanum based perovskite got much attention as a catalyst for Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) due to their flexibility in the cation arrangement and tailorable electronic and ionic properties. In this study a rapid and cost effective solution combustion technique was used for the preparation of LaMn1-xCoxO3 (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1). Following this method, Co doped LaMnO3 has been successfully prepared. From the results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), it was found that the high Co content levels activate the surface enhancement in B-site cation in their respective higher oxidation state (Mn4+ and Co3+). It was observed that, compared with other catalysts, LaMn0.2Co0.8O3 had good stability and shows acceptable OER activity with a lower overpotential of 430 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a lower Tafel slope of value 57.95 mV/dec. This study provides a simple cost effective synthesis route for the preparation of perovskite material and also offers a path for enhancing OER activity by B-site cation substitution.									4	0	0	0	1	0	3			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000807718000011

The Co-TiO2 particles have been characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray (EDAX), FT-IR spectroscopy and voltammetry techniques. XRD results show pure Co-TiO2 and TiO2 powders with average crystallite size about 12 nm and 15 nm, respectively. Co loaded in TiO2 hasn't influence crystalline structure. Moreover, efficient Co-TiO2-based anode was fabricated by casting of the Co-TiO2 solution on glassy carbon electrode (Co-TiO2/GCE). The electrocatalysis of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at Co-TiO2/GCE has been examined using linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) in alkaline media. The OER is significantly enhanced at Co-TiO2/GCE, as demonstrated by a negative shift in the LSV curve at the Co-TiO2/GCE compared to that obtained at the unmodified one. The value of energy saving of oxygen gas at a current density of 5 mA cm(-2) is 12.6 kWh kg(-1). The low cost as well as the marked stability of the modified electrode make it promising candidate in industrial water electrolysis process.									16	0	1	0	0	0	17			0009-4536	2192-6549		WOS:000337676400013

Here, we deliver a novel and simple spontaneous redox synthesis strategy to fabricate a self-supported Pt-CoFe(II) layered double hydroxide (LDH) electrocatalyst. The three-dimensional porous structure of the catalyst and the synergistic effect of Pt clusters and CoFe hydroxides jointly contribute to its excellent catalytic activity and enhanced chemical stability. Specifically, in 1 M KOH, the overpotentials for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of Pt-CoFe(II) LDH at 10 mA cm(-2) are 214 mV and 15 mV, respectively. The catalysts are stable for at least 40 h at high current densities of 100 and 500 mA cm-2. Compared with previously reported electrocatalysts, Pt-CoFe(II) LDHs || Pt-CoFe(II) LDHs overall water (seawater) electrolyzers only require 1.634 (1.651) and 1.798 (1.858) V to reach 100 and 500 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH water (seawater) electrolyte, confirming the superior catalytic activity of the self-supported Pt-CoFe(II) layered double hydroxide electrocatalysts. This study provides a novel and simple synthesis strategy to prepare advanced water/seawater splitting electrocatalysts, which is highly relevant for commercial applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000793522400004

Their phase purity, size and morphology were investigated by powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopic studies. Their electrochemical performance studies demonstrated promising catalytic activity in the electrolysis of water to the hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) compared to bulk CuAlO2. More specifically, these CuAlO2 nanoparticles showed 12 times higher current density to the OER than the bulk counterpart. Hence, being a low-cost semiconducting material, these delafossite CuAlO2 nanoparticles with the size of 20 urn could be useful to further study their other applications like solar cells, photochemical water splitting, proton exchange membrane water electrolysis etc. (C) 2015 American Chemical Society					Symposium on Nanostructural Materials for Next-Generation Energy Storage and Conversion at the 246th ACS National Meeting and ExpositionSymposium on Nanostructural Materials for Next-Generation Energy Storage and Conversion at the 246th ACS National Meeting and Exposition	SEP 08-12, 2013SEP 08-12, 2013	Amer Chem Soc, Div Colloid & Surface ChemAmer Chem Soc, Div Colloid & Surface Chem	Indianapolis, INIndianapolis, IN	20	0	0	0	0	0	20			0097-6156		978-0-8412-3116-0	WOS:000371100600004

Herein, we demonstrate a unique two stage encapsulation strategy to regulate the structure and performance of catalysts featured with thin graphene nanosheets coupling with full encapsulated ultrafine and high-loaded (similar to 25 wt %) transition metal nanoparticles (TMs@N(C)x) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By optimizing the electronic modulation effect from suitable metal cores, the best NiFe@NCx catalyst exhibits high stability and activity with an onset potential of 1.03 V for ORR and an overpotential of only 0.23 Vat 10 mA cm(-2) for OER, which is superior to commercial Pt/C and IrO2 catalysts. Rechargeable Zn-air battery using NiFe@NCx catalyst exhibited an unprecedented small charge-discharge overpotential of 0.78 V at 50 mA cm(-2), high reversibility, and stability, holding great promise for the practical implementation of rechargeable metal-air batteries.									165	13	0	0	2	0	168			2155-5435			WOS:000385057900002

However, the oxygen evolution during cycling is a crucial factor in the structure deterioration, potential change, and capacity decay of cathodes, limiting the commercial application of high-Ni (Ni > 0.9) layered oxides in batteries. Herein, we demonstrate a feasible approach to enhance the stability of oxygen framework, through the surface oxygen immobilization with yttrium and bulk oxygen stabilization with aluminum in high-Ni layered oxides. As expected, benefiting from the oxygen-stabilized framework, the bulk structure deterioration, and interfacial parasitic reaction are mitigated obviously during battery operation, along with the improved thermal stability of cathode. Correspondingly, the as-prepared high-Ni oxide delivers high reversible capacity, impressive cycle ability, and low potential polarization upon cycling. Such significant improvement on the electrochemical performance is primarily attributed to the strong oxygen affinities of both yttrium at the surface layer and aluminum in the bulk, which synergistically stabilizes the oxygen framework of high-Ni oxide via raising the energy barrier for oxygen evolution. Therefore, building the stable oxygen framework is critical for enhancing the energy density output, cycle operation, and thermal stability of high-Ni oxide cathodes.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2575-0356		WOS:000693725000001

Their potential application as cathode catalysts of rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries were electrochemically evaluated and analyzed with diverse physicochemical techniques. The results reveal that both SnS2 materials are capable of catalyzing oxygen reduction reaction as well as oxygen evolution reaction in the cathode of Li-O-2 batteries, while the plate-like ones perform much better.

In this work, a photoassisted Fe-air battery (PFAB) with two photoelectrodes of ZnO-TiO2 heterostructure and polyterthiophene (pTTh)-coated CuO (pTTh-CuO) grown on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) is proposed. The band structure of semiconductors and the charge-transfer mechanism of heterostructure are studied. The electrochemical results show that the photogenerated electrons and holes play key roles in reducing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER)/oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) overpotential in the discharging and charging processes, respectively. The short-circuit current density, the open-circuit voltage, and the maximum power output of the PFAB can reach 34.28 mA cm(-2), 1.15 V, and 5.69 mW cm(-2) upon illumination, respectively. The photoassisted Fe-air battery exhibits a low charge voltage of 0.64 V for ZnO-TiO2 as photoelectrode and a discharge voltage of 1.38 V for pTTh-CuO as a photoelectrode at 0.1 mA cm(-2).									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000726291100001	34862712

Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been proposed as active and affordable electrocatalysts in OER. It has been reported that the activity of LDHs can be effectively tuned by doping of other metals. Despite previous experimental synthesis and improved catalytic performance, the in-depth OER mechanism on metal doped LDHs remains ambiguous. In the present work, transition metals (Cr, Mn and Co) doped NiFe LDHs were designed to investigate the doping effect in OER by both experimental analysis and density functional theory calculations. Based on experimental results, the intrinsic OER activity is Cr-NiFe LDHs > Co-NiFe LDHs > Mn-NiFe LDHs > NiFe LDHs, while the enhanced catalytic performance upon doping can be attributed to the interface effect, which results in the tuning of the binding energies of the intermediate states in OER.

Herein, we report a hierarchical nickel-carbon composite, fabricated by directly growing sheet-like Ni-MOFs on commercial nickel foam prior to high-temperature annealing, as a highly efficient bifunctional catalyst. This composite shows remarkable catalytic activities for both the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions in an alkaline electrolyte, affording a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 37 mV for the HER and 265 mV for the OER. Furthermore, an electrolyzer employing the composite as a bifunctional catalyst in both the cathode and the anode delivers a current density of 35.9 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.60 V with extended stability, which is even superior to the integrated Pt/C and RuO2 counterparts. This excellent performance is believed to be a result of a concerted synergy due to its hierarchical structure, enabling excellent reaction kinetics. Further ex situ XRD and XPS analyses reveal that while metallic nickel is responsible for the HER, Ni nanoparticles with an oxide shell encapsulated in graphitic carbon are the OER catalytically-active sites formed in situ.									180	13	0	0	6	0	184			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000445215400006

Based on the analyses of operando Raman spectra, DFT theoretical calculations and electrochemical characterizations, the superior electrocatalytic performance of catalysts for OER at the industrial grade current density can be attributed to Fe2O3/NiFe-LDHs heterointerfaces that can obviously promote interfacial electron transfer from Ni2+ to Fe3+ and optimize d-orbit electronic configuration with e(g) occupancy of Ni close to the unity, resulting in moderate adsorption/desorption energies of oxygenated intermediates, and thus facilitating remarkably electrocatalytic performance and superior intrinsic kinetics for OER in alkaline media.									26	0	0	0	2	0	25			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000783838700003

Herein, we report low ruthenium content ruthenium cobalt nanoalloys encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon layers synthesized via incipient-wetness impregnation-pyrolysis method (denoted as RuCo@NC-temp.). A series of characterizations reveal that trace amounts of ruthenium inserts into the cobalt lattice matrix that can form RuCo alloys. The optimized catalyst (RuCo@NC-750, 1.56 wt% Ru) shows superior catalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline, acidic, and neutral media, as well as oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media. The catalytic reaction displays an overpotential of 25 mV (1.0 M KOH), 29 mV (0.5 M H2SO4), and 163 mV (1.0 M PBS) for hydrogen evolution reaction and 308 mV (1.0 M KOH) for oxygen evolution reaction at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). RuCo@NC-750 needs only 1.54 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) when it serves as both the anode and cathode material in a two-electrode electrolyzer. The excellent electrocatalytic performance can be attributed to the doping of ruthenium into the cobalt lattice matrix, which effectively enhance the electron transfer from the metal core to the carbon surface, and is beneficial for regulating the electronic structure of the carbon surface and strengthening the carbon-hydrogen bond and surface defects.

Heterogeneous solid catalysts cannot adequately address the problematic overpotentials when the surfaces become passivated. However, there exists a class of biomolecules which have been designed by nature to guide complex solution-based oxygen chemistries. Here, we show that the heme molecule, a common porphyrin cofactor in blood, can function as a soluble redox catalyst and oxygen shuttle for efficient oxygen evolution in non-aqueous Li-O-2 batteries. The heme's oxygen binding capability facilitates battery recharge by accepting and releasing dissociated oxygen species while benefiting charge transfer with the cathode. We reveal the chemical change of heme redox molecules where synergy exists with the electrolyte species. This study brings focus to the rational design of solution-based catalysts and suggests a sustainable cross-link between biomolecules and advanced energy storage.									98	7	0	0	9	0	101			2041-1723			WOS:000385617200001	27759005

Graphite, melamine, and elemental sulfur were used as raw materials. The surface area-normalized linear sweep voltammograms revealed that the N-doped and S-doped MSMG have higher intrinsic ORR/OER activity than the undoped MSMG. When the MSMG samples were used in GDEs, the N-doped and S-doped MSMG showed higher OER activity but lower ORR activity than the undoped MSMG. We analyzed the relationship between the specific surface area, intrinsic ORR/OER activity, and ORR/OER activity of GDEs and found that both the intrinsic ORR activity and surface area are important in the fabrication of GDEs with high ORR activity and that the intrinsic OER activity rather than the surface area is important in the fabrication of GDEs with high OER activity. The GDE fabricated from the S-doped MSMG showed the highest ORR/OER bifunctional activity among the MSMG-based GDEs, and its ORR/OER bifunctional activity was higher than the GDEs fabricated from other materials, such as reduced graphene oxide and electroconductive oxides.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000814822900001

A nickel nitride/sulfide electrode (NiNS), whereby Ni3N and Ni3S2 species are interfaced, is synthesized via a one-step calcination process of Ni foam with thiourea in a vacuum-sealed ampoule. The resultant NiNS can be employed directly as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting with excellent activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. The significant electrocatalytic performance of NiNS is attributed to the interface between Ni3N and Ni3S2, which functions as the electrochemical active sites and is beneficial for dissociative adsorption of water molecules. Current densities of 12.4 mA cm(-2) and 48.3 mA cm(-2) at 1.8 V are achieved for overall water electrolysis under neutral pH conditions and in seawater, respectively, when NiNS is applied as both the anode and cathode. This performance is significantly better than that of the benchmark Ir-C and Pt-C electrode system.

Herein, we reported the partially oxidized cobalt species in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes hierarchical structures to produce dual-functionality towards oxygen/hydrogen evolution reactions. The in situ transformation of carbon nanotubes and well-exposed metal-oxide contributes to mass diffusion and greater electrolyte-accessible surface area. The as-synthesized catalyst displays low overpotentials of 287 mV and 171 mV for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions at 10 mA cm(-2) of current density with remarkable performance during long-term stability. Furthermore, when employed as cathode and anode, a respectable performance of 1.68 V demonstrated our catalyst as an efficient bifunctional material for conducting water-splitting operation.

In this work, a new strategy was employed for the rational design of 3D hierarchical oxygenated nickel tungsten selenide on conductive nickel foam substrate (O-Ni1-xWxSe2/NF) by a low-cost hydrothermal process, followed by a partial controlled-selenization process. Owing to the enriched oxygenated intermediates and abundant active sites with nanoporous networks, the optimal O-Ni0.5W0.5Se2 hierarchical nanostructure shows excellent catalytic activities for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions, which exhibit a low overpotential of - 109 and 238 mV at 20 mA cm-2, with remarkable durability. Most significantly, the O-Ni0.5W0.5Se2||ONi0.5W0.5Se2 electrolyzer required a small cell voltage of - 1.56 V at 10 mA cm-2. The present study suggests a new strategy for designing highly active hierarchical 3D oxygenated enriched metal selenide as a durable bifunctional electrocatalyst.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000722569900003

However, the high potential needed for driving OER usually leads to electrochemical oxidation of carbon-based materials, reducing their catalysis durability. Meanwhile, the weak interaction between carbon-based conductive additive and transition metal oxides, nitrides, sulfides and other compounds that possess electrocatalyst activity affects the performance of the electrocatalysts. Herein, a novel three-dimensional (3D) bifunctional electrocatalyst was prepared by embedding CoO nanoparticles into nitrogen and sulfur co-doped carbon framework (denoted as Co/N/S-CF) through morphology-controlled solid-state pyrolysis. The carbon framework was derived from a morphology-retaining pyrolysis of poly(aniline-co-2-aminothiophenol) precursor, retaining the 3D porous structure of the latter. The embedded CoO nanoparticles improve electrocatalysis durability of the 3D carbon-based framework as CoO has lower OER potential than the electrooxidation decomposition potential of doped carbon materials. Only 1.61 V can attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile, the catalyst retains the highly efficient activity of N and S co-doped carbon framework towards ORR with an onset potential of about 0.92 V, suggesting that it is a qualified electrocatalyst for ORR. Long-term stability of the catalyst for ORR and OER is superior to the commercially available Pt/C and IrO2. Furthermore, the overpotential between ORR and OER (oxygen electrode activity parameter) of the catalyst is calculated to be 0.796 V, indicating that the catalyst could be a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for both ORR and OER.

Here we report a carbon supported FeNi catalyst synthesized from an in situ freeze-drying method (fd-FeNi/C) with a commonly seen biomass, jasminum mesnyi flower. The fd-FeNi/C exhibits a N-doped hierarchically mesoporous carbon structure decorated with small FeNi nanoparticles with a small diameter of similar to 4 nm. Electrochemical measurements show excellent catalytic performance in 1 M KOH solution with an overpotential of 301 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The value is 41 mV lower than that of the commercial IrO2/C. A small Tafel slope (64.5 mV dec(-1)) and high stability are also recorded. This work provides a facile, scalable, and template-free approach to convert biomass into highly active electrochemical catalysts, which shows great potential for future applications.

Herein, guided by theoretical calculations, we demonstrate highly efficient water splitting in alkaline solution using quarternary mixed nickel iron phosphosulfide (Ni1-xFexPS3) nanosheets (NSs), even though neither NiPS3 nor FePS3 is a good HER (or OER) electrocatalyst. With tuned electronic structure and improved electrical conductivity induced by mixing appropriate amount of Fe into NiPS3, Ni09Fe0.1PS3 NSs display excellent HER activity (an overpotential of 72 mV vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at a geometric catalytic current density of -10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 73 mV dec(-1)), which is among the best HER catalysts under alkaline conditions. Ni0.9Fe0.1PS3 NSs also show a good apparent OER activity (an overpotential of 329 mV vs RHE at a catalytic current density of 20 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 69 mV dec(-1)), although structural investigation indicates the formation of Ni(Fe)OOH and Ni(Fe)(OH), layers on the catalyst surface after OER reactions as likely the real active species. These mixed nickel iron phosphosulfide non-precious-metal electrocatalysts with enhanced intrinsic activity and long-term stability and durability should have great potential in overall water-splitting applications.									214	14	0	0	1	0	215			2155-5435			WOS:000417230500063

In this paper, a series of transition metal alloy nanoparticles embedded hierarchically porous carbon nanosheets (denoted as FexCoy@PCNSs) have been successfully designed and synthesized. After optimizing the metallic contents in FexCoy alloy, Fe3Co7@PCNSs displays superior water electrolysis performances compared to other control samples and previously reported non-noble metal catalysts. This advance is mainly due to the synergistic effect of increased carbon edges exposure, abundant accessible active sites, and improved electron/mass transport capability of 3D hierarchically porous architecture. More importantly, when Fe3Co7@PCNSs is applied as both cathode and anode in a two-electrode cell for carrying out the overall water splitting process, it just needs the corresponding cell voltages of 1.667 and 1.707 V to attain the 10 and 20 mA cm(-2) current densities respectively. The synthesis of Fe3Co7@PCNSs confirms the importance of Fe and Co elements in designing catalyst structures. The electrochemical measurements further display the key roles of structural features and metal alloy@C active sites for boosting water splitting performances.

The remarkable mass activity is attributed to the excellent intrinsic activity of CMO, small and well-dispersed CMO nanosheets on graphene sheets and hydrophilized graphene due to the synthetic process. Furthermore, CMO/G exhibits excellent stability.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000687282600001	34498625

Recently explored Co3O4 shows good activity and stability toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid; however, the stability is not adequately explained. Lack of such information delays the design of an acid-stable OER electrocatalyst. Here, we investigate the structural origin of cobalt dissolution by various local atomic configurations of Co3O4. Operando Raman studies and voltammetric data reveal that chemical reduction of the CoO2 intermediate accompanied by lattice oxygen loss leads to under-coordinated CoO sites, which then react with water and form an amorphous three-dimensional (3D) porous network of CoO(OH)(x), called the hydrous oxide layer (HOL). Growth of HOL mainly depends on the oxygen vacancies and near-surface OI- that impair the crystalline integrity and favor dissolution. These insights provide a fundamental relation between OER activity and stability and offer a specific guideline for the electrocatalyst design.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000664289800046	34096278

In this study, we report cobalt oxide (Co3O4) and oxidized graphite (G(OX)) synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method to prepare a catalyst (Co3O4/G(OX)) for the OER. Time-dependent oxidation of graphite (G) and Co3O4 nanoparticles was observed by physical and electrochemical studies. The optimal catalyst (Co3O4/G(OX-10)) demonstrated the best catalytic OER performance with the lowest overpotential of 250 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 67 mV dec(-1), which is substantially smaller than that of pristine Co3O4 and Co3O4/G. An efficient synergistic effect between Co3O4 and GOX in the composite catalyst was observed compared to the individual catalysts. The optimal catalyst exhibited high specific activity (1.543 mA cm(-2)) and turnover frequency (0.474 s(-1)) compared to the other catalysts in this study. The high catalytic performance of the catalyst is attributed to the presence of oxygen functional groups, which induced a high electrochemical surface area, additional active site exposure, fast electron transfer, and enhanced dispersion of the catalyst. Thus, the synthesized Co3O4/G(OX-10) catalyst can replace noble metals as an efficient OER electrocatalyst.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000821819600006

It has been established that on constant voltage polarization, the cell reaches a certain state after which its temperature (T) and current (I) begin to increase spontaneously and pass through maxima before reaching stationary values. This phenomenon is called thermal runaway (TRA). These maxima are a result of self-accelerating interrelation established between the rates of the reactions involved in the oxygen cycle at the two electrodes. At high polarization voltages and currents, electrochemical reactions proceed at the positive and negative plates leading to changes in the surface properties and the structures of the PbO2 and Pb plates as well as in the composition of the electrolyte filling the pores of the active masses. The above changes result in passivation of the PbO2 electrode, decrease of the rate of 02 evolution at the positive plates and initiate new chemical exothermic reactions of O-2 reduction at the negative plates. The generated heat causes the cell temperature to rise. If the temperature is higher than 60 degrees C for a long period of time, this may impair the performance characteristics of the cell. This paper proposes a mechanism of the chemical and electrochemical reactions that proceed at the positive and negative plates during operation of the oxygen cycle (OxCy) and their evolution on constant voltage polarization of the cell. It has been established that there are critical values of T and 0 above which the OxCy efficiency declines substantially and thermal phenomena proceed causing TRA. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The reversibility of Co(IV)/Co (III) and Tafel slope of the OER are found to depend on the crystalline structure and composition/surface morphology of these binary oxides performed by X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. A combination of the electrochemical and textural investigations reveals that NiO, NiCo2O4 and Co3O4 predominate the electrochemical behavior of Ni-Co oxides with Ni composition (i) above 80 m/o, (ii) between 60/70 and 20 m/o and (iii) below 20 m/o, respectively. The intimate mixing of NiO and NiCo2O4 with ca. 50 m/o Ni, rendering an increase in the nonstoichiometric sites, exerts a synergistic effect for the OER.									62	3	0	0	2	1	62			0254-0584			WOS:A1997XC80700011

At 1.5 V-RHE, our results suggest that there is an -OO group on the coordinatively unsaturated ruthenium (Ru-CUS) site of the (100) surface (and similarly for (110)), but adsorbed oxygen on the Ru-CUS site of (101). Density functional theory results indicate that the removal of -OO from the Ru-CUS site, which is stabilized by a hydrogen bond to a neighbouring -OH (-OO-H), could be the rate-determining step for (100) (similarly for (110)), where its reduced binding on (100) increased activity. A further reduction in binding energy on the Ru-CUS site of (101) resulted in a different rate-determining step (-O + H2O - (H+ + e(-)) -> -OO-H) and decreased activity. Our study provides molecular details on the active sites, and the influence of their local coordination environment on activity.									85	4	0	0	3	0	87			2520-1158			WOS:000531778200001

The iron/cobalt-mixed melilites were successfully synthesized for the first time and found to exhibit high OER activity in highly alkaline media. In particular, the OER performance of Sr2Fe0.67Co0.67Ge1.66O7 (x = 0.67) is comparable to, or even superior to, that of a precious-metal catalyst, RuO2. The remarkable OER activity of the melilites seems to originate from a synergetic effect of Fe/Co coexistence as well as the structural feature of melilites, where "coordinatively unsaturated" Fe/Co sites effectively promote the formation of catalytically active surface layers through the adsorption of OH- ions in highly alkaline media.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000566337800004

In this study, a NiFe layered double hydroxide-decorated phosphide (NiFe LDH@CoP/NiP3) was constructed to display satisfactory OER activity and good stability for water splitting in alkaline media. At an overpotential of 300 mV, NiFe LDH@CoP/NiP3 achieved a current density of 82 mA cm(-2) for the OER, which was 9.1 and 2.3 times that of CoP/NiP3 and NiFe LDH, respectively. Moreover, the reconstruction behavior, during which oxyhydroxides formed, was studied by a combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. A synergistic effect between NiFe LDH and CoP/NiP3 was also observed for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Furthermore, when NiFe LDH@CoP/NiP3 acted as both the cathode and anode for overall water splitting, a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2) was maintained for more than 275 h. In addition, under Xe light irradiation, a solar to hydrogen efficiency of 9.89% was achieved for solar-driven water splitting. This work presents the coupling of different active compositions, and can provide a reference for designing bi-functional electrocatalysts.									31	4	0	0	0	0	32			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000614689400001

Because of the advantage of the hierarchical structure, the as-prepared catalyst reveals excellent catalytic performance in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with overpotential of 232 mV at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2). It also performs well in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which only needs overpotential of 171 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, heterostructure CoCO3@NiFe LDH is used for overall water splitting, the voltage required at 10 mA cm(-2) is only 1.67 V. The performance of the CoCO3@NiFe LDH showed little degradation in the 20 h stability test. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, alkaline electrolytes cause critical obstacles in realizing a long battery life. Thus, neutral electrolytes are attracting growing interest. However, the current understandings of R-ZABs in neutral/near-neutral electrolytes are far behind those in alkaline electrolytes. This review summarizes the latest research progress of neutral electrolytes used in R-ZABs, including aqueous inorganic and organic salt solutions, water-in-salt electrolytes, and quasi-solid electrolytes based on polymer hydrogels. Research efforts in improving the stability of Zn anodes in neutral electrolytes are also reviewed. Reaction mechanisms of oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in alkaline and neutral electrolytes are compared in the context of R-ZABs, together with a summary of potential oxygen electrocatalysts applicable in neutral conditions. Different device configurations are introduced. We further provide our perspectives on future research directions of R-ZABs with neutral electrolytes.									23	2	0	0	2	0	23			2589-7780			WOS:000697024100001

These flames often assume the shape of propagating curved interfaces that can be identified with level sets corresponding to a prescribed ignition temperature. The present paper is concerned with the analysis of such interfaces in two spatial dimensions under a single assumption of their small curvature. We derive a strongly nonlinear evolution equation that governs the dynamics of an interface. This equation relates the normal velocity of the interface to its curvature, the derivatives of the curvature with respect to the arc-length of the interface, and physical parameters of the problem. We study solutions of the evolution equation for various parameter regimes and discuss the ranges of validity of the corresponding simplified models. Our theoretical findings are illustrated and supported by numerical simulations.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0036-1399	1095-712X		WOS:000408945700003

The development of many key sustainable energy technologies relies on fast oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics. However, both reactions are sluggish. In the present work, we address these two issues synergistically by fabricating Fe2O3 wrapped in P and S dual-doped graphitized carbon (Fe2O3/P-S-CG) from soiled baby diapers, whose disposal and recycling are beneficial to the environment. Electrochemical tests revealed that Fe2O3/P-S-GC has a significant catalytic activity towards both the ORR and OER in 0.1 M KOH. In particular, the difference between the ORR potential at 3 mA cm(-2) and the OER potential at 10 mA cm(-2) is as small as similar to 0.86 V. This value is comparable to that of commercial precious metal-based catalysts. In addition, Fe2O3/P-S-GC exhibits a favorable catalytic durability, making it a promising bi-functional non-precious catalyst for the ORR and OER.									18	1	0	0	1	0	18			2046-2069			WOS:000379442400014

The development of stable non-noble nanomaterials as bifunctional OER/HER electrocatalysts is the foremost bottleneck to commercial applications. Herein, the fabrication of Te-modulated FeNiOOH nanocubes (NCs) by a novel tailoring approach is reported, and the doping of Te superbly modulated the local electronic structures of Fe and Ni. The Te/FeNiOOH-NC catalyst displays better mass and electron transfer ability, exposure of plentiful OER/HER edge active centers on the surface, and a modulated electronic structure. Accordingly, the as-made Te/FeNiOOH-NC catalyst reveals robust OER activity (overpotential of 0.22 V@10 mA cm(-2)) and HER activity (overpotential of 0.167 V@10 mA cm(-2)) in alkaline media. Considerably, this bifunctional catalyst facilitates a high-performance alkaline water electrolyzer with a cell voltage of 1.65 V at 10 mA cm(-2). This strategy opens up a new way for designing and advancing the tellurium dopant nanomaterials for various applications.									36	1	0	0	2	0	36			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000629054100028	33641328

In this research, CeO2 nanowires and nanosphere samples are prepared by hydrothermal method. Their electrocatalytic properties are evaluated by Cyclic Voltammetry and Linear Sweeping Voltammetry techniques. Even though both samples exhibit similar catalytic ability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the CeO2 nanospheres are more active in promoting oxygen evolution reaction (OER) than its nanowires counterpart. Their molecular characteristics and crystal structures are investigated by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, Raman and High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope, which confirmed that molar concentration of lattice defects on the surface of the CeO2 nanospheres is substantially higher than that on the nanowires surface, leading to the enhanced OER catalytic performance. The research work could provide experimentalists more insights and guidelines in designing optimum morphology of high-performance catalysts for bifunctional electrode application.									12	0	0	0	3	0	12			0026-265X	1095-9149		WOS:000474492600006

However, it is hindered by the lack of high-performance anode catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid electrolyte. Herein, IrCuNi deeply concave nanocubes (IrCuNi DCNCs) are successfully synthesized from the selective etching of the facet of cubic nanoparticles, and they significantly boost the OER. The obtained IrCuNi DCNCs show high activity toward OER in the acidic electrolyte, which only requires an overpotential of 273 mV to achieve the OER current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low Ir loading of 6.0 mu g(Ir) cm(-2). The precious metal based mass activity is 6.6 A mg(Ir)(-1) at 1.53 V, which is 19 times as high as that of pristine Ir. It demonstrates that the outstanding catalytic performance is beneficial from the well-defined multimetal concave nanostructures, which may shed light on the fabrication of efficient water electrolyzers.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000641160500015	33733796

IrO2 (Ir4+: 5d(5)) ranks among the most active known OER catalysts. However, it is unclear how the environment of the Ir4+ oxygen-coordination octahedra affects the OER electrocatalysis. Herein, we present the OER kinetics on a single-crystal, epitaxial SrIrO3(100)(p) perovskite oxide synthesized using molecular-beam epitaxy on a DyScO3(110) substrate. We find that by switching the host structure of the Ir4+ oxygen-coordination octahedra from corner-and edge-sharing rutile (IrO2) to purely corner-sharing perovskite (SrIrO3), the OER activity increases by more than an order of magnitude. We explain our finding with the correlated, semimetal electronic structure of SrIrO3; our density functional theory calculations reveal that the adsorption energetics on SrIrO3 depends sensitively on the electron-electron interaction, whereas for IrO2, it depends rather weakly. This finding suggests the importance of correlations on the OER and the design of future transition metal oxide electrocatalysts.									50	2	0	0	6	0	49			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000375608500013

Herein, we demonstrate a facile strategy to obtain a nickel-iron-aerogels and graphene oxide composite, grown on nickel foam (NiFe@GO/NF) via a mild sol-gel method. The aerogels with the three-dimensional cross-linked networks are successfully anchored to graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets, which greatly increases the specific surface area of aerogels (242.4 m(2) g(-1)) and effectively avoids the agglomeration of the cross-linked networks. Benefited from the special composite morphology and the synergistic effect of NiFe-bimetal and GO, the NiFe@GO/NF driving a 10 mA cm(-2) only requires a low overpotential of 233 mV in 1 M KOH. Surprisingly, the NiFe@GO/NF shows considerable OER performance in industrial operating environments (6 M KOH and 50 degrees C). Thus, the NiFe@GO/NF could be a very promising electrocatalyst for water oxidation. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast, starting with Cu2O, the rate of C2 production is >5,000 times faster than pure Cu(111) and comparable to H2 production. To validate these predictions experimentally, we combined time-dependent product detection with multiple characterization techniques to show that ethylene production decreases substantially with time and that a sufficiently prolonged reaction time (up to 20 h) leads only to H2 evolution with ethylene production similar to 1,000 times slower, in agreement with theory. This result shows that maintaining substantial subsurface oxygen is essential for long-term C2 production with Cu catalysts.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			0027-8424			WOS:000684996200004	34083432

In 1.0 M KOH, this Ni-MOF/NF catalyst drives 100 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 320 mV.

To this end a series of carbon supported Pt based electrocatalysts containing Ru and Co have been prepared and thoroughly characterized. The catalytic performance on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) both in the presence and in the absence of methanol by linear sweep voltammetry on rotating disk electrode has been studied. In spite of its documented ability towards methanol and CO oxidation, when Ru-containing catalysts are Subjected to excursions to potentials more positive than 0.8 V vs. NHE they develop a certain tolerance to the presence of methanol. This feature is attributed to the formation of upper oxide Ru species that impede the methanol oxidation reaction to occur under the typical reaction conditions of the oxygen reduction process, i.e. potentials more positive than 0.7 V vs. NHE and oxygen saturated atmospheres. The evolution of Ru species with the applied potential has been investigated by XPS, identifying the presence Of upper oxidized Ru phases. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AbstractZinc-air batteries (ZABs) hold tremendous promise for clean and efficient energy storage with the merits of high theoretical energy density and environmental friendliness. However, the performance of practical ZABs is still unsatisfactory because of the inevitably decreased activity of electrocatalysts when assembly into a thick electrode with high mass loading. Herein, we report a hierarchical electrocatalyst based on carbon microtube@nanotube core-shell nanostructure (CMT@CNT), which demonstrates superior electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction with a small potential gap of 0.678 V. Remarkably, when being employed as air-cathode in ZAB, the CMT@CNT presents an excellent performance with a high power density (160.6 mW cm(-2)), specific capacity (781.7 mAhg Zn-1) as well as long cycle stability (117 h, 351 cycles). Moreover, the ZAB performance of CMT@CNT is maintained well even under high mass loading (3 mg cm(-2), three times as much as traditional usage), which could afford high power density and energy density for advanced electronic equipment. We believe that this work is promising for the rational design of hierarchical structured electrocatalysts for advanced metal-air batteries.									38	4	0	0	2	0	40			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000528955000004	34138105

Herein, we report the easy fabrication of 3D porous core-shell Ni nanochains@NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets with extraordinary oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and OWS performance. In specific, a simple magnetic field-assisted method is used for the in situ growth of Ni nanochain cores with large surface areas, allowing the subsequent vertical growth of few-layered NiFe LDH nanosheets to form densely packed shells. Benefiting from the meticulously designed nanoarchitecture, the electrocatalyst possesses rich exposed active sites, plentiful charge transfer channels and high porosity for the release of gas bubbles. The OER performance and durability of the electrocatalyst are far better than those of both commercial RuO2 and IrO2, while its HER performance is competitive with the performance of the benchmark Pt/C electrode in alkaline electrolytes. When these catalysts are further employed as anode and cathode electrodes, small cell voltages of 1.53 and 1.78 V can be achieved at current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) for a long-term OWS reaction. Towards the commercial use, we design an electrolytic overall-water-splitting cell pack, which demonstrates a linear relationship between the numbers of packing cells and the increase of current density under a given voltage.									75	1	0	0	8	0	75			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000490235800055

Intensive experimental explorations have therefore been carried out to investigate the LDHs synthesis, amorphous control, intrinsic material modifications, interfacing with other phases, strain, etc. There is still the need for a fundamental understanding of the structure-property relations, which could hinder the design of the next generation of the LDHs catalysts. In this review, we firstly provide the crystal structure information accompanied by the corresponding electronic structures. Then, we discuss the conflicts of the active sites on the NiFe LDHs and propose the synergistic cooperation among the ligand units during OER to deliver a different angle for understanding the current structure-property relations beyond the single-site-based catalysis process. In the next section of the OER process, the linear relationship-induced theoretical limit of the overpotential is further discussed based on the fundamental aspects. To break up the linear relations, we have summarized the current strategies for optimizing the OER performance. Lastly, based on the understanding gained above, the perspective of the research challenges and opportunities are proposed.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000738907100001	34985485

Particle fragmentation from 8 nm to 4 nm occurs and is attributed to the oxidation process in water where oxidative species are present and the local temperature is rapidly elevated under laser irradiation. Significantly higher surface area, crystal phase transformation, and formation of structural defects (Co2+ defects and oxygen vacancies) through the PLFL process are evidenced by detailed structural characterizations by nitrogen physisorption, electron microscopy, synchrotron X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. When employed as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction under alkaline conditions, the fragmented cobalt oxides exhibit superior catalytic activity over pristine and nanocast cobalt oxides, delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 369 mV and a Tafel slope of 46 mV dec(-1), which is attributed to a larger exposed active surface area, the formation of defects, and an increased charge transfer rate. The study provides an effective approach to engineering cobalt oxide nanostructures in a flowing water system, which shows great potential for sustainable production of active cobalt catalysts.									41	5	0	0	3	0	41			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000504786300001	31756030

However, the precise design and preparation of the heterojunction with desirable catalytic performance remain a challenge. Herein, a hierarchical Ni2P/FeOOH Schottky junction supported on nickel foam was prepared by electrodeposition of FeOOH on the surface of Ni2P. The electrocatalytic activity of the Ni2P/FeOOH Schottky junction can be remarkably improved, owing to the unique hierarchical architecture and strong electron interaction in the Ni2P/FeOOH Schottky junction. As-prepared Ni2P/FeOOH exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity for an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with an ultralow overpotential of 246 mV to reach 100 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 62.8 mV dec(-1). This work provides not only a new method for the design of hierarchical nanomaterials but also an efficient strategy to design efficient OER electrocatalysts by constructing hierarchical heterojunctions.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000612551400057	33404210

Until now, many efforts have been paid in the electrocatalyst development for the air electrode, but few works have been done on the electrode structure design which is quite import for the battery performance. Herein, we design a decoupled air electrode by integrating a hydrophilic mesh active for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a hydrophobic layer active for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The decoupled air electrode could separate the OER and ORR sites at microscale, which could alleviate the oxidative corrosion of the ORR layer along cycling. Meanwhile, it also shows adjustable contact angle by fancily changing the texture of the mesh, which enables the optimal hydrophilicity towards abundant triple phase boundary for superior discharge performance. The ZAB based on the decoupled air electrode exhibits a small initial voltage gap of 0.75 V at 10 mA cm(-2), and it was stably cycled for 240 h. This work provides a feasible strategy to simultaneously accelerate the electrochemical reaction and improve the electrode stability, and it could be inspiring for other multiphase reaction involved devices.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000781372900006

Herein, we reported a highly active Co0.7Cu0.3 alloy, which screening from a series of CoxCu1-x alloys (x = 0.1-0.9) via surface composition controlling and electron state modification. Compared with the Co, other CoxCu1-x alloys, as well as commercial RuO2/IrO2, the Co0.7Cu0.3 catalyst exhibited very high activity in electrocatalytic O2 production from alkaline solution (-207 mV overpotential). Meanwhile the Co0.7Cu0.3 catalyst exhibited excellent durability for OER, after 72,000 s operation, the attenuation rate of Co0.7Cu0.3 catalyst is lower than - 20%. The high catalytic activity of Co0.7Cu0.3 is attributed to positive shift of d-band center and surface species of Co0.7Cu0.3 alloy which facilitates oxygen-containing species (OCS) formation (*H2O2, *OOH, *OH) and electron transfer. This method of improving the catalytic performance by adjusting the alloy composition to achieve the microscopic electronic perturbation effect is expected to attract attention in the later research.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000730163000003

Here, we report a novel Gd-doped porous IrO2 (Gd-pIrO(2)) catalyst with a high specific surface at 293 m(2) g(-1) and enhanced catalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER), where the overpotential required to reach 10 mA cm(-2) is only 287 mV. We found that Gd3+ doping induces the formation of abundant oxygen vacancies and an increase in Ir4+/Ir3+ ratio, due to the charge compensating mechanism in defect chemistry. Combining experimental techniques and density functional theory calculations, we revealed that Gd doping at an appropriate content leads to an overall enhancement in OER performance, where oxygen vacancies facilitate the adsorption of water molecules and the high ratio of Ir4+/Ir3+ facilitates the H dissociation. The novel strategy proposed in this study provides an efficient way for designing high-performance electrocatalysts for water electrolysis.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			2168-0485			WOS:000687050400005

Here we report the hierarchical porous nanosheet arrays with abundant Ni3N-Co3N heterointerfaces on Ni foam with superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and HzOR activity, realizing working potentials of -43 and -88 mV for 10 mA cm(-2), respectively, and achieving an industry-level 1000 mA cm(-2) at 200 mV for HzOR.

Here, considering the synergistic effect of differently metal sites and excellent electrocatalytic activities of bimetallic phosphides, the hybrids of NiCo bimetallic phosphides (NiCo-P) are prepared by one-step phosphorization of NiCo metal-organic frameworks (NiCo-BDC) as bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting. Benefiting from the unique porous structure and synergistic effect of Ni2P and Co2P in bimetallic phosphides system, Ni1Co1-P hybrid exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activities for both OER and HER, with small overpotentials 343 mV (OER) and 169 mV (HER) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline conditions, respectively, which compares to monometallic phosphides (Ni-P and Co-P) and Ni-P + Co-P sample, illustrating the existence of Ni2P/Co2P interface as an essential requirement to achieve the synergistic effect and the improved catalytic activities in NiCo-P system.

During the discharge treatment process, metal W in the mixture is activated and reacts with B4C to form WCx, WB4, and graphite nanoribbons. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance of W-WB4-WCx/B4C is tested in an alkaline solution, and the results show that the W-WB4-WCx/B4C composite electrocatalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 0.36 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER, a small overpotential of -0.19 V (j = 10 mA cm(-2)) for the HER, as well as good stability. The significantly enhanced electrocatalytic performance of the W-WB4-WCx/B4C composites is attributed to their unique structure, in which WCx and WB4 not only improve the catalytic activity for the OER and HER, but also effectively anchor the W coating on the substrate.									21	1	0	0	1	0	22			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000418098000021	29186228

Here, we presented a simple method to synthesize highly dispersed cobalt manganate spinel nanodots in-situ embedded in amine-functionalized carbon black. Silane coupling agent 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) played dual roles in the preparation: (1) to achieve amine-functionalization of carbon support; (2) as weak alkali to precipitate metal hydroxides which were then converted to spinel nanodots after mild calcination. The hydrophilicity of the carbon substrate was enhanced by amine modification from APTES to disperse metal oxide evenly, and the electrochemical activity was promoted through the strong interface interaction between embedded spinel nanodots and carbon substrate during the calcination process. As expected, the CoMn2O4/C-NH2-300 catalyst exhibited satisfactory bifunctional catalytic performance for both ORR and OER with an Delta E (E-1/2-E-j10) = 0.75 V, which was lower than most state-of-the-art catalysts. In addition, CoMn2O4/C-NH2-300 as a cathode also exhibited remarkable zinc-air battery performance in alkaline solution. This strategy of APTES as a bifunctional coupling agent provided a novel way to design and explore highly active, durable, and cost-effective catalysts for renewable energy conversion and storage.

The as-synthesized alpha-CoNiOOH sheet exhibits excellent oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) and produces a current of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of merely 190 mV in an alkaline environment. Moreover, the alpha-CoNiOOH sheet attains an exceptionally high current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of only 270 mV. Additionally, this electrocatalyst possesses a 33 mV dec(-1) Tafel slope with higher values of TOF (11 s(-1)) and double-layer capacitance (7.76 mF cm(-2)). This enhancement is attributed partially to the substitution of Ni during the conversion of alpha-Co(OH)(2) to alpha-CoNiOOH and partially to the exceptionally thin sheets allowing potential octahedral sites for improved oxygen evolution reactions.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000597124500043	33191427

Herein, the FeCo/CoFe2O4 nanoflowers are successfully embedded in N-doped graphitic carbon (NGC) by hydrothermal method and subsequently annealing process (FeCo/CoFe2O4 @NGC). It only needs 1.47 V and 1.32 V for OER and UOR to produce a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Besides, it can work continuously for 100 h at different current densities (10; similar to 1000 mA cm(-2)), displays outstanding stability, which is mainly ascribed to the N-doped carbon encapsulated FeCo modified CoFe2O4 heterostructure and porous structure. This study thus provides a simple synthesis method to design and manufacture low-cost and highperformance catalytic materials for OER and UOR, and promotes the industrial application of water splitting.

Hence, multi-particle nano-single crystal coalesced PtCu NSs are designed and successfully synthesized by a cost-effective aqueous solution method. The formed PtCu NS catalyst exhibits a superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalytic activity with an ultralow onset potential of 18 mV at the current density of 2 mA/cm(2) and high mass activity of 1.08 A/mg(pt) (7.2 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C catalysts). Also, it shows an enhancement of 3.2 and 2.7 times in the mass and specific activities toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to that of Pt/C. Moreover, it possesses an excellent catalytic durability for both ORR and HER. Even after 10,000 cycles, its ORR mass activity retains 87% of its initial value. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that by introducing Cu atoms into the Pt lattice, a downshift of the D-band center and favorable hydrogen adsorption free energy of approaching to zero (Delta G) occur, indicating the increased electrocatalytic activity of Pt electrocatalysts.

Additionally, significant inhibition of back reactions, especially the oxidation of sulfide ions during the photocatalytic water oxidation catalysis, is an arduous task that requires an efficient photogenerated hole transfer dynamics. Here, a ternary dumbbell-shaped catalyst based on RuO2/CdS/MoS(2)with spatially separated catalytic sites is developed to achieve simultaneous production of hydrogen and oxygen under simulated solar-light without any sacrificial agents. Particularly, MoS(2)nanosheets anchored on the two ends of CdS nanowires are identified as a reduction cocatalyst to accelerate hydrogen evolution, while RuO(2)nanoparticles as an oxidation cocatalyst are deposited onto the sidewalls of CdS nanowires to facilitate oxygen evolution kinetics. The density functional theory simulations and ultrafast spectroscopic results reveal that photogenerated electrons and holes directionally migrate to MoS(2)and RuO(2)catalytic sites, respectively, thus achieving efficient charge carrier separation. The design of ternary dumbbell structure guarantees metal sulfides against photocorrosion and thus extends their range in solar water splitting.									53	0	0	0	3	0	53				2198-3844		WOS:000548222700001	32995115	
J	Kluge, Regina M.; Haid, Richard W.; Bandarenka, Aliaksandr S.					Kluge, Regina/0000-0001-7742-2306			Assessment of active areas for the oxygen evolution reaction on an amorphous iridium oxide surface								JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				396				14	22		10.1016/j.jcat.2021.02.007		FEB 2021		APR 2021	2021	Electrocatalytic ``green" production of hydrogen from water for sustainable energy provision schemes is currently inefficient due to the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anodes of the electrolysers. In the case of acidic polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysers, iridium (Ir) oxide catalysts pose a promising compromise between good OER activity and stability. However, the structure-activity relations for these materials remain largely unknown because the surface of a "real" oxide catalyst under reaction conditions becomes amorphous. In order to contribute to the understanding of these systems, we use electrochemical scanning tunnelling microscopy under reaction conditions ('noise' or n-ECSTM). With this technique, active areas can be detected by an increased noise level of the STM signal compared to inactive sites. The n-EC-STM measurements are applied to an amorphous iridium oxide surface, which is formed during electrochemical cycling of Ir(111). By doing so, we can monitor OER activity insitu while simultaneously assessing the surface morphology. In order to elucidate the active areas, step and terrace sites were quantitatively compared to each other. The measurements reveal that terraces, step sites and concavities lead to a similar noise level increase in the STM signal. We, thus, conclude that the OER on the amorphous extended iridium oxide surface shows little structure-sensitivity. Subsequently, we suggest that in contrast to, e.g., metallic Pt for the oxygen electro-reduction, the shape of amorphous IrOx nanoparticles in an acidic medium should not significantly influence the OER turnover frequency.

Melamine was pyrolyzed into N-doped carbon nanotubes, which afford oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) active sites, and meanwhile, the generated NiFe2O4 particles can act as active components for oxygen evolution reactions (OERs). The as-prepared catalyst named Fe-Me-Ni exhibits excellent bifunctional activities for ORRs with a half-wave potential of 0.841 V, and for OERs with an overpotential of 313 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The Zn-air battery fabricated from Fe-Me-Ni can work at a discharge voltage of 1.23-1.28 V with a specific capacity of 798 mA h g(Zn)(-1) at 10 mA cm(-2), outperforming those of the Pt/C + RuO2 catalyst (1.17-1.24 V, 787 mA h g(Zn)(-1)). The battery evaluation results also indicate the remarkable rechargeability and long-term cycling stability of the catalyst Fe-Me-Ni in practical applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000754672700001

Engineering the electronic structure of low-cost transition metal oxides (MOs) for the ORR and OER is highly demanding for such devices. Herein, a nonprecious mixed MO hybrid is reported that comprised of nanostructured Co3O4 and CeO2 supported on carbon (Co3O4-CeO2/C) with adequate oxygen vacancies and strong oxide/oxide and oxide/carbon heterointerfaces. The Co3O4-CeO2/C hybrid is highly active toward the ORR with values of the onset potential (-0.12 V) and Tafel slope (69 mV decade(-1)) comparable to that of benchmark Pt/C with a high limiting current density in alkaline medium. It can catalyze the OER efficiently at a less positive onset potential (0.23 V) and low Tafel slope (176 mV decade(-1)), in contrast with the standard RuO2 catalyst (0.45 V and 179 mV decade(-1)). The remarkable activity of the Co3O4-CeO2/C hybrid represents a promising route to replace noble metals and to develop low-cost bifunctional electrodes for energy devices.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000687707000048

In this strategy, the MnOx lattice is doped with either electropositive (Sr, Ba) or electronegative (Bi, Pb) elements that results in the coincorporation of electron-rich donor (Mn2+) and electron-poor acceptor (Mn4+) defects in the same parent (Mn3+) lattice. These defects effectively catalyze the reduction (ORR) and oxidation (OER) processes on the same electrode surface. This study is based on the results of a previous study on Mn2O3 that showed Mn2+ and Mn4+ as the active sites for ORR and OER processes, respectively. Our results show that BiMnOx is the most promising bifunctional catalyst with OER/ORR activities that are comparable to the individual activities of state-of-the-art commercial Pt or RuO2 catalysts. Stability tests show the catalyst to be stable for more than 3 h of continuous OER or ORR polarization. This work provides a pathway for the individual tuning of defects to control electrocatalytic activities, which opens up new possibilities for the rational design of many perovskite-based oxides.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000677581600006

In spite of tremendous research efforts, developing high-performance OER catalysts at low cost remains a great challenge. Inspired by two earth-abundant elements Fe and Si, herein, we report a Fe-Co2SiO4 composite consisting of well dispersed iron oxide (FeOx) decorated Co2SiO4 hollow nanospheres as an economical and promising OER catalyst. Although Co-2 SiO4 or FeOx alone has little OER activity, their composite exhibits satisfied performance, that is highly related to geometric effect and bimetal component electronic interactions. The Fe-Co-2 SiO4 composite exhibits comparable catalytic activity to most of transition mental oxide/hydroxide relevant composites at 10 mA cm(2). It is even 1.6 times higher than commercial RuO2 electrocatalyst at high current density 100 mA cm(2) in alkaline solution. In this work, surface decoration of transition metal silicate provides a new horizon to design high-performance and economical OER catalysts. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

However, it is extremely difficult to enclose the beta-NiOOH crystal with undercoordinated facets because of its inevitable crystal transformation to gamma-NiOOH, resulting in the exfoliation of the catalytic surfaces. Herein, we demonstrate {111}-faceted Ni octahedra as the parent substrates whose surfaces are easily transformed to catalytically active beta-NiOOH during the alkaline OER. Electron microscopic measurements 1.2 demonstrate that the horizontally stacked beta-NiOOH on the surfaces of Ni octahedra has resistance to further oxidation to gamma-NiOOH. By contrast, significant crystal transformation and thus the exfoliation of the gamma-NiOOH sheets can be observed on the surfaces of Ni cubes and rhombic dodecahedra (RDs). Electrocatalytic measurements show that the beta-NiOOH formed on Ni octahedra exhibits highly enhanced OER durability compared to the Ni cubes, Ni RDs, and the state-of-the-art Ir/C catalysts.									51	1	1	0	1	0	51			1944-8244			WOS:000428972700026	29513002

For CaSO4 oxygen carriers, their low reactivity and the evolution of sulfur species limit their practical application in CLC. In this study, CaSO4 oxygen carriers decorated with hematite were prepared by a mechanical blending method with natural anhydrite as active support and hematite as additive. Experiments on the gasification and CLC of coal char in a steam medium were conducted in a laboratory-scale fluidized-bed reactor at atmospheric pressure. The effects of the reaction temperature, iron-sulfur ratio and cycle numbers on the performance of CaSO4/Fe2O3 oxygen carriers were investigated in terms of carbon conversion and CO2 yield as well as the rate of evolution of SO2. Temperature and hematite favored an enhancement of the carbon conversion and CO2 yield. The evolution of SO2 increased with a rise in reaction temperature, but the peak time was delayed, which was ascribed to the sulfur-suppressing effect of hematite. The iron-sulfur ratio had slight influence on the product gas concentrations and there was no obvious decrease in the rate of evolution of SO2 when the iron-sulfur ratio reached 0.13. Redox cycling tests showed that the cumulative rate of evolution of SO2 in reduction/oxidation decreased first and increased subsequently with the increase of cycle number. Related chemical equations involving an oxygen transfer mechanism of iron-catalyzed reduction were proposed.									24	4	0	0	2	1	28			2046-2069			WOS:000357803200093

It is found that trinary LDH containing nickel, cobalt, and iron (NiCoFe-LDH) shows a reasonable bifunctional performance, while exploiting a preoxidation treatment can significantly enhance both oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction activity. This phenomenon is attributed to the partial conversion of Co2+ to Co3+ state in the preoxidation step, which stimulates the charge transfer to the catalyst surface. The practical application of the optimized material is demonstrated with a small potential hysteresis (800 mV for a reversible current density of 20 mA cm(-2)) as well as a high stability, exceeding the performances of noble metal catalysts (commercial Pt/C and Ir/C). The combination of the electrochemical metrics and the facile and cost-effective synthesis endows the trinary LDH as a promising bifunctional catalyst for a variety of applications, such as next-generation regenerative fuel cells or metal-air batteries.									280	21	0	0	9	0	285			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000357880100006

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a critical semi-reaction, severely limits the occurrence of water splitting due to the slow kinetics of four-electron transfer. Cobalt-based materials are the well-stocked conductive catalytic feedstock, which can drive down the energy cost needed for OER via lowering the over potential. Herein, cobalt-based materials and their derivatives in the field of OER catalysis in alkaline, acidic and neutral media are summarized. The interface design and composition regulation strategy are the key approaches for cobalt-based catalysts design in recent years. The related catalytic mechanisms and structure-function relationship have been deeply discussed and analyzed.

Common techniques for the synthesis of noble metal often result in crystalline nanostructures. The synthesis of amorphous noble metal nanostructures remains a substantial challenge. We present a general route for preparing dozens of different amorphous noble metal nanosheets with thickness less than 10 nm by directly annealing the mixture of metal acetylacetonate and alkali salts. Tuning atom arrangement of the noble metals enables to optimize their catalytic properties. Amorphous Ir nanosheets exhibit a superior performance for oxygen evolution reaction under acidic media, achieving 2.5-fold, 17.6-fold improvement in mass activity (at 1.53 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) over crystalline Ir nanosheets and commercial IrO2 catalyst, respectively. In situ X-ray absorption fine structure spectra indicate the valance state of Ir increased to less than + 4 during the oxygen evolution reaction process and recover to its initial state after the reaction.									160	8	0	0	10	0	160			2041-1723			WOS:000492140800011	31649272

However, the development of LOBs is severely hindered by adverse parasitic reactions and sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, hierarchical Ni3Se2/NiSe2 heterostructure nanoforests on Ni foam (Ni3Se2/NiSe2@NF) is designed as a high efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for LOBs. As expected, owing to 3D hierarchically branched nanoforests structure, the Ni3Se2/NiSe2@NF electrode can build up an effective channel for mass transfer and expose sufficient active sites for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In addition, the strong interface interaction between Ni3Se2 and NiSe2 in the heterostructure causes distinct electron redistribution along the interface, which plays a vital role in enhancing electrocatalytic performance of Ni3Se2/NiSe2@NF. Accordingly, LOBs based on Ni3Se2/NiSe2@NF shows a high discharge specific capacity of 23,092 mA h g(-1) at 500 mA g(-1), a low voltage gap of 0.96 V and an improved cycling life of 500 cycles. It is worth noting that this study has a significant guidance for designing effective bifunctional electrocatalysts via constructing the heterostructure to boost oxygen electrode kinetics and improve Li-O-2 battery performance.									24	0	0	0	2	0	24			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000543021900006

In this work, we report the synthesis of highly dispersed CoSx nanocrystals anchored on N-doped mesoporous carbon (CoSx@NMC) network electrode. CoSx@NMC, derived from Fe/Co dual tuning nitrogen/sulfur-containing polymer as carbon precursor, manifests discrete dual-active-sites endowing excellent bifunctional catalytic activity toward both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The zinc-air battery system assembled from this CoSx@NMC electrode exhibits an open circuit voltage of 1.44V (vs. Zn/Zn+) and a peak power density of 269.7 mW cm(-2). Notably, it exhibits a super stability in the galvanostatic discharge of 5 mA and 50 mA, and the voltage could be maintained stable at 1.25V over 90h galvanostatic discharge. Rechargeable zinc-air battery delivers an excellent cycling stability beyond 1288 charge/discharge cycles. The superior electrochemical catalytic properties for ORR/OER are attributed to the strongly coupled pyridine-N, graphitic-N and nanoscale CoSx, which can promote the simultaneous exposure of both OER and ORR active centres. Further investigations reveal that the microstructure of the mesoporous carbon might experience a structural remodeling during the charge/discharge process.									16	2	0	0	1	0	16			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000490030800001

It was shown that by activation of the electrodes one can reduce the overall polarization losses at cathode and anode by about 0.3-0.4 V. The characteristic lengths of the processes (hydrogen and oxygen evolution) occurring at the electrodes with nickel surface Raney catalysts were determined. The reasons were discussed why the specific activities (exchange currents of the hydrogen and oxygen reaction) of the highly disperse catalysts are lower than those of compact metals and alloys. A method was suggested for enhancing the strength of adhesion of the active catalytic electrode layers; this method secures electrochemical characteristics of the electrolysis cells with activated electrodes which are constant with time.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0038-5387			WOS:A1992JV15900009

Its success requires a drastic improvement in the kinetics of the anodic half-reaction of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which determines the overall system efficiency to a large extent. A simple electrochemical protocol has been developed to activate Ni electrodes, by which a stable NiOOH phase was formed, which could weakly bind to alkali-metal cations. The electrochemically activated (ECA) Ni electrode reached a current of 10 mA at <1.40V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at practical operation temperatures (> 75 degrees C) and a mild pH of ca. 10 with excellent stability (> 24 h), greatly surpassing that of the state-of-the-art NiFeOx electrodes under analogous conditions. Water electrolysis was demonstrated with ECA-Ni and NiMo, which required an iR-free overall voltage of only 1.44 V to reach 10 mA cm(geo)(-2).									48	1	0	0	3	0	47			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000399384700029	28345220

In this work, We reported a catalyst composed of cobalt nanoparticles embeded in a carbon lattice through synthesis with a cationic polymer (PEI) and carbonization process at three temperatures (800, 900 and 1000 degrees C). The material obtained at 1000 degrees C showed the highest activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline medium (1M KOH). Moreover, the OER overpotential required to reach 10 mAcm(-2) of 296 mV, was lower than for the commercial RuO2 catalyst. Further, the material also exhibited very good stability in a long-term stability test at 10 mAcm(-2).									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2196-0216			WOS:000444225300024

In view of this, the present work is focused on one-step hydrothermal fabrication of graphite paper (GP)-supported cobalt carbonate hydroxide (Co-2(CO3)(OH)(2)/GP) nanostructures and its nickel- and manganese-substituted products, Co1.9Ni0.1(CO3)(OH)(2)/GP and Co0.95Mn0.05CO3/GP, respectively. This is followed by the investigation of their crystal structure, morphology, and electrocatalytic oxygen evolution activity. Our findings showed modification of the electronic structure in substituted cobalt carbonate hydroxides. In addition, specific and electrochemically active surface areas were also enhanced in Co1.9Ni0.1(CO3)(OH)(2)/GP and Co0.95Mn0.05CO3/GP compared to pure Co-2(CO3)(OH)(2)/GP. It was noted that Ni- and Mn-substituted Co-2(CO3)(OH)(2) exhibited dramatically enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in 1.0 M KOH. In addition, the mechanism of the OER was explored experimentally to reveal the origin of their enhanced electrocatalytic activity. Our findings also established the relatively superior performance of Co1.9Ni0.1(CO3)(OH)(2)/GP and Co0.95Mn0.05CO3/GP compared to the commercial RuO2 electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution in alkaline media. It was also inferred that Co1.9Ni0.1(CO3)(OH)(2)/GP exhibited the best performance as indicated by the lowest overpotential (similar to 266 mV) in achieving 10 mA cm(-2) current density, a small Tafel slope (similar to 44.8 mV dec(-1)), quite low charge-transfer resistance (similar to 0.72 Omega), and excellent durability. Thus, Ni-substituted Co-2(CO3)(OH)(2) nanostructures could be employed as promising, efficient, and durable electrocatalysts for the OER in alkaline media.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			2574-0962			WOS:000563784400013

However, under such harsh conditions, higher requirements are put forward for the catalytic activity and adaptability of a catalytic electrode. Herein, we advance an ultrasimple dipping-and-heating method to engineer the surface of Ni foam (NF) into an interface-rich FeNi oxide layer and realize an exceptional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. It only requires overpotentials of 182 and 267 mV to achieve current densities of 10 and 1000 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, respectively, which are significantly lower than those of the recently reported catalysts. The as-prepared FNE300 parallel to MoNi4/MoO2 electrolyzer realizes the industrial demand of 500 mA cm(-2) at low voltages of similar to 1.75 V for overall alkaline natural seawater and domestic sewage electrolysis, as well as satisfactory stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that modifying the electronic structure so as to optimize the intermediate adsorption is well achieved by constructing the interfaces between NiO and Fe2O3. The interaction of Fe with oxygen intermediates can be optimized by e(-)-e(-) repulsion between Ni2+ and oxygen intermediates. This work provides a facile approach to fabricate an electrocatalyst for seawater and domestic sewage electrolysis, which is of great significance to the synergetic development of hydrogen economy and environmental science.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000685245800046	34318662

ACS applied materials & interfaces											10.1021/acsami.2c12739				2022-Oct-21	2022	Li-rich Mn-based layered oxide cathodes with a high discharge capacity hold great promise for high energy density lithium-ion batteries. However, application is hampered by voltage and capacity decay and gas evolution during cycling due to interfacial side reactions. Here, we report coating by oxygen-deficient perovskite La0.9Sr0.1CoO3 using the Pechini process. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy both exhibit a uniform coating layer with a high oxygen vacancy concentration. The coating effectively mitigates the first cycle irreversible capacity loss and voltage decay while increasing cyclability. Optimized coating improves capacity retention from 55.6% to 84.8% after 400 cycles at 2 C. Operando differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy shows that such a coating can significantly mitigate the release of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and post-mortem analysis indicate that the coating layer forms a stable interface and restricts structure evolution and cation mixing during cycling, conferring these cathode materials with better cycling and voltage stability. The perovskite can be applied to other cathodes with high voltage and capacity to suppress interfacial side reactions toward developing stable high energy density batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1944-8252		MEDLINE:36268653	36268653

This lamellar material exhibits uniform mesoporous channels and ease of modification by using different nitrogen sources, such as melamine, urea, and ammonia. Nitrogen-doping on this material leads to a high specific surface area of 761 m(2) g(-1) and uniform pores with a diameter of 9 nm. Electrochemical tests show that the N-doped OMCS possesses high catalytic activities on the oxygen reduction reaction, which can be attributed to the pyridinic-type and pyrrolic-type nitrogen activating nearby carbon atoms. In addition, we demonstrate that the unique physical structure and surface chemical properties of OMCS improve the dispersion and structure of supported metal Ru nanoparticles, which lead to enhance oxygen evolution reaction activity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1380-2224	1573-4854		WOS:000430552400028

Herein, we report a needle-like cobalt carbonate hydroxide hydrate (Co(CO3)(0.5)OH center dot 0.11H(2)O) nanoarrays, which in situ grown on the surface of carbon cloth through a facile one-step hydrothermal method. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterizations demonstrate that the Co(CO3)(0.5)OH nanoarrays with high porosity is composed of numerous one-dimensional (1D) nanoneedles. Owing to unique needle-like array structure and abundant exposed active sites, the Co(CO3)(0.5)OH@CC only requires 317 mV of overpotential to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is much lower than those of Co(OH)(2)@CC (378 mV), CoCO3@CC (465 mV) and RuO2@CC (380 mV). For the stability, there is no significant attenuation of current density after continuous operation 27 h.

A novel catalyst which could be a promising candidate for such electrocatalysts is described. Co0.85Se supported on three-dimensional hierarchical porous graphene-like carbon (HPG) exhibits outstanding catalytic performances for OER in alkaline medium. It is found that the onset overpotential is 311 mV on the Co0.85Se/HPG electrode, which is more 28 and 41 mV negative than that on the Co/HPG and Co3O4/HPG electrodes. What's more, the value of Tafel slope is 61.7 mV dec(-1) and the overpotential at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is 385 mV on this electrode.

Here, recent progress on the electrocatalytic performance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) is built by engineering its surface defect structure through a versatile, effective, and controllable lithium reduction strategy. It is established that the lithium reduction treatment causes the formation of a structurally disordered layer at the surface of LSCF nanoparticles. The treated nanoparticles demonstrate significantly enhanced OER and ORR performance, especially for 5 wt% lithium-reduced LSCF, whose OER potential decreases from 1.66 to 1.55 V at current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and ORR onset potential increases from 0.70 to 0.84 V. This work provides the foundation for the optimization of catalytic performance of perovskite oxide (LSCF). Moreover, such defective materials are promising candidates for energy conversion and storage applications.									26	0	0	0	0	0	26			2366-9608			WOS:000458557500012

However there are still challenges remaining in the development of stable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution half-reaction. Here we investigate the effects that the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has on an electrodeposited Ni(OH)(2) catalyst operated under alkaline conditions. The electrocatalyst was characterised by established methods including cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy both before and after the OER to identify changes that may have occurred in the structure and/or composition of the catalyst. In addition, synchrotron X-ray absorption near edge structure mapping was used to generate spatially resolved maps of the species present within the Ni(OH)(2) catalyst and how they change in a heterogeneous manner into a NiO species after the OER. When compared to the morphological data it suggests that changes in the morphology after the OER can be correlated to the formation of NiO within the newly formed clusters that were generated across the electrocatalyst.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0003-2654	1364-5528		WOS:000501829000022	31701960

However, the design and synthesis of self-supporting metal borides remain a big challenge. Herein, metal-organic framework-derived metal boride electrode is in-situ formed on 3D framework via controllable boronation strategy, which is of great significance to the construction of self-supporting metal borides. This strategy not only produces the metal boride materials but also achieves the metal borides based self-supporting electrode with multiple structures. The as-fabricated CoFe-PBA-B exhibits a low overpotential of 255 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 51 mV dec-1 due to the enhanced active sites of multiple structures and effective electronic interaction between metal atoms and boron atom.

Herein, an effective multifunctional electrocatalyst comprising Fe2O3 nanoparticles immobilized on N and S codoped C has been synthesized via heat-treatment of Fe(II) complex at 800 degrees C (denoted as Fe2O3/NS-C-800). Favorable features including the introduction of maghemite nanoparticles, N/Scodoping effect, and close contact between the Fe2O3 nanoparticles and NS-C ender the Fe2O3/NS-C-800 with high multifunctional catalytic performance. The onset potential (0.97 V) and half-wave potential (0.81 V) of the Fe2O3/NS-C-800 towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are comparable to Pt/C (0.99 and 0.82 V). The Fe2O3/NS-C-800 also exhibits high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity with low OER and HER overpotentials of 0.37 and -0.27 V at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. In addition, higher ORR, OER and HER stabilities than Pt/C are observed for the Fe2O3/NS-C-800. More importantly, the assembled water electrolyzer using the Fe2O3/NS-C-800 as the anode and cathode exhibits a high stability at a water electrolysis current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The present study offers a new promising non-noble multifunctional catalyst for future application in renewable energy technologies. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The possibility of using the scalable flame spray synthesis (FSS) technique for the production of BSCF nanoparticles intensified the interest in this material for a future application in an alkaline water electrolyzer. A possible scale-up would require the optimization of the synthesis parameters to maximize the production rate. To further understand the influence of the synthesis parameters of the tunable FSS on the OER activity of BSCF, a systematic study was carried out by producing BSCF with different total metal concentrations (C-TM), flow rates of the precursor solution (FRPS) and of the dispersion gas (FRDG). This study reveals that all three parameters have a direct impact on the OER activity of BSCF-measured in a rotating disc electrode (RDE) setup-due to the controllability of the initial Co and Fe oxidation state-indicated by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements-and with that also of the oxygen vacancy concentration in the as-synthesized BSCF. This controllability enables the optimization of the OER activity of BSCF and emphasizes the importance of having Co in a lower initial oxidation state for reaching a high electrocatalytic performance.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2073-4344		WOS:000580022600001

Interestingly, ultrafine Co/CoO nanoparticles with an average size of 1.8 +/- 0.2 nm anchored on graphitic carbon surface (Co/CoO-C) can be obtained through further acid/alkali rinsing treatment of the as-prepared Co@C using HNO3 and NH3 center dot H2O aqueous solutions respectively, followed by thermal treatment at 900 degrees C in N-2 atmosphere. The formation of Co/CoO-C with a surface area of 247 g cm (2) can be ascribed to the dissolution and reorganization process of carbon-encapsulated metallic Co under acid/alkali rinsing and post-thermal-treatment conditions. As the electrocatalyst, Co/CoO-C exhibits superior bifunctional electrocatalytic activities of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, notably better than ORR and OER activities of Co@C. The characterization results show that Co-N-x and N doping can be found in both Co@C and Co/CoO-C due to triethylamine (TEA) as solvent providing N source during Co-MOFs synthesis, which are catalytic active species toward electrocatalytic oxygen reactions. Furthermore, the highly exposed ultrafine Co/CoO on graphitic carbon surface can provide more catalytic active sites for high-performance ORR and OER, while carbon-encapsulated metallic Co in Co@C is incapable of directly contacting the electrolyte (only influencing shell-layer carbon function work) with limitedly improved electrocatalytic performance. The fabricated Co/CoO-C with superior bifunctional ORR and OER activities as air cathode material was assembled into a rechargeable zinc-air battery, exhibiting high power density and long-term stability. Our work provides an approach to transform low catalytic active electrocatalyst to high catalytic active one for renewable energy applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

X-ray diffraction confirmed a continuous solid solution of the cubic perovskite structure with an increase in the lattice parameter with increasing x from 0.392 +/- 0.001 nm for SrTiO3 to 0.386 +/- 0.001 nm for SrFeO3. A Raman mode corresponding to an O-stretching vibration was observed which is disallowed by symmetry in the cubic structure suggests a localised lattice distortion. The perovskites exhibited poor conductivity for low values of x (rho < 7 x 10(-8) S cm(-1)) but conductivity increased with increasing Fe content before reaching a plateau at rho = 0.041 S cm(-1) for x > 0.75. Increasing electrocatalytic activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with increasing Fe content was observed, characterised by a 100 mu A onset potential varying monotonically from 1.52V(RHE) (x = 0.2) to 1.40V(RHE) (x = 0.85). The high OER activity was however found to correlate with low electrode stability, consistent with the participation of lattice oxygen in the OER mechanism. The latter was evidenced by the redox electrochemistry associated with reversible oxygen intercalation. SrTi0.5Fe0.5O3-y exhibited the optimal composition with good OER activity and electrode stability. Low electrocatalytic activity towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was observed for all oxygen stoichiometric compositions. The ORR did not occur until after reduction of the films suggesting that surface reduction is required for the creation of the active surface sites. ORR activity on the oxygen sub-stoichiometric perovskites showed the opposite trend with compositional variation to OER activity on the oxygen stoichiometric perovskites.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000435619700037

Herein, a facile strategy is developed to synthesize Ni-doped CoOOH nanosheets with poor crystallinity and 3D mesh structure, which is in situ derived from the Na+-induced spontaneous reconstitution of polymetallic phosphate precursors during OER process. The resulted Ni-CoOOH/NF with a large number of active sites exhibits a highly efficient OER catalytic activity outperforming the commercial RuO2 catalysts, indicated by low overpotentials of only 265 and 410 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline and neutral media, respectively. This Na+-induced in situ conversion strategy opens up a new way for the design and synthesis of electrocatalysis towards various energy systems.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000578922200006

Incorporating an adequate amount of W into Ni-Fe hydroxides modulates the electronic structure by changing the local environment of Ni and Fe and create oxygen vacancies, resulting in abundant active sites for the OER. The optimized electrocatalyst, with a substantial number of catalytic sites, is found to outperform the well-established 20 wt% Ir/C electrocatalyst. The catalyst only requires small overpotentials of 224 mV and 251 mV to generate current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) and 50 mA cm(-2), respectively, at an extremely low Tafel slope. Surface study after long-term chronopotentiometry (ca. 30 h) reveals that the tungsten dopant undergoes reduction to stabilize the Ni and Fe active sites for predominant water oxidation. This research provides new insight to apply optimum amounts of tungsten doping to enable more significant electronic coupling within Ni-Fe for the chemisorption of hydroxy and oxygen intermediates and greatly improved OER activity.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000610864500001	33381900

However, the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and highly corrosive environment on the anode side narrow the catalysts to be expensive Ir-based materials. It is very challenging to develop cheap and effective OER catalysts. Herein, Co-hexamethylenetetramine metal-organic framework (Co-HMT) as the precursor and a fast-quenching method is employed to synthesize RuO2 nanorods loaded on antimony-tin oxide (ATO). Physical characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that the ATO can increase the electrochemical surface areas of the catalysts, while the tensile strains incorporated by quenching can alter the electronic state of RuO2. The optimized catalyst exhibits a small overpotential of 198 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER, and keeps almost unchanged after 150 h chronopotentiometry. When applied in a real PEMWE assembly, only 1.51 V is needed for the catalyst to reach a current density of 1 A cm(-2).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2198-3844		WOS:000812704200001	35717677

Although some intermediate states have been detected in transient absorption spectroscopy, the O-2 evolution kinetics after the multi-step, four-electron oxidation of water remain unknown. In this study, transient amperometry with a microelectrode was applied to operando O-2 detection over Al-doped SrTiO3 particles doubly loaded with RhCrOx and CoOy cocatalysts, an efficient photocatalyst for the overall water-splitting reaction. Electrochemical O-2 detection at intervals of 0.1 s unexpectedly indicated instantaneous O-2 adsorption and desorption in addition to steady, photocatalytic O-2 evolution on the photocatalyst modified under intense light irradiation. We hypothesized that electrons excited in the conduction band were transferred to O-2 in water thorough Ti cations neighboring an oxygen anion vacancy on the modified Al-doped SrTiO3. The negatively charged O-2 was then bound to the Ti cations. It was neutralized and released when shaded through electron back-transfer to the conduction band. The hypothesized mechanism for O-2 adsorption and desorption was compared with the photoinduced O-2 desorption known to occur on anion vacancies of TiO2(110). The microelectrode-based transient amperometry demonstrated in this paper will be applied to many other phenomena at liquid-solid interfaces.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000693147700001	34473157

Nevertheless, the poor electric conductivity and insufficient electroactive sites hinder its commercial application. In this work, oxygen vacancies-rich NiCo2O4-4x nanowires assembled on porous carbon derived from discarded cigarette ash (named as O-v-NCO/PC-Y) are achieved via hydrothermal treatment combined with partial reduction process. The rich oxygen vacancies could offer remarkable conductivity, rapid ions transport rates, and rich electroactive sites. The introduction of phosphate ions is favorable for weakening the activation energy of their redox reactions, and therefore greatly promoting their surface reactivity and electrochemical reaction reversibility. Moreover, the interconnected 3D porous network structure of porous carbon (PC) could offer large surface area and short transport channel of ions/electrons. In virtue of intrinsic characteristic and structural advantage, O-v-NCO/PC-0.1 can be regarded as an effective HER catalyst with a low overpotential of 135.9 mV to reach 10 mA/cm(2). Furthermore, O-v-NCO/PC-0.1 demonstrates superior specific capacitance of 1002.2 F/g, and O-v-NCO/PC-0.1//AC-based aqueous asymmetrical supercapacitor delivers the energy density of 32.7 Wh/kg at the power density of 160.2 W/kg. Moreover, the specific capacitances of O-v-NCO/PC-0.1//AC-based aqueous asymmetrical supercapacitor nearly keep unchanged after 3500 cycles. Overall, these findings shed fundamental insight on constructing high-performance bifunctional transition metal oxides for optimizing electrochemical energy conversion and storage.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				2352-152X		WOS:000780275500001

Herein, we construct a novel Ag@polymer/NiAl LDH (designated as APL) nanohybrid as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst by a simple hydrolysis method. The well-fabricated APL/GCE exhibited an extensive linear range from 0.1 to 100 mu M in optimized conditions. It showed a detection limit (LOD) of 0.0096 mu M (9.6 nM) (S/N = 3) for 4-NP in pH 6 by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Meanwhile, the newly fabricated APL exhibited outstanding OER activity with a very low overpotential of 259 mV to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) current density (J) at a scan rate of 5 mV/s. The Tafel plot value of APL is low (97 mV/dec) compared to that of the benchmark RuO2 due to a fast kinetic reaction. Besides, the durability of the electrocatalyst was assessed by a chronoamperometry test (CA) for 36 h at 1.55 mV vs RHE, and the long-term cycling stability was analyzed by using cyclic voltammetry (CV); after 5000 cycles, the electrocatalyst was highly stable. These demonstrated results could lead to an alternative electrocatalyst construction for the bifunctionally efficient electrochemical sensing of 4-nitrophenol and oxygen evolution reaction.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000768699400019	35084176

Here, a new strategy for the catalyst support design focusing on oxygen vacancy (OV)-rich, low-bandgap semiconductor is proposed. The OVs promote the electrical conductivity of the oxide support, and at the same time offer a strong metal-support interaction (SMSI), which enables the catalysts to have small metal size, high catalytic activity, and high stability. The strategy is demonstrated by successfully synthesizing ultrafine Co-metal-decorated 3D ordered macroporous titanium oxynitride (3DOM-Co@TiOxNy). The 3DOM-Co@TiOxNy catalyst exhibits comparable activities for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, but much higher cycling stability than noble metals in alkaline conditions. The zinc-air battery using this catalyst delivers an excellent stability with less than 1% energy efficiency loss over 900 charge-discharge cycles at 20 mA cm(-2). The high stability is attributed to the strong SMSI between Co and 3DOM-TiOxNy which is verified by density functional theory calculations. This work sheds light on using OV-rich semiconductors as a promising support to design efficient and durable nonprecious electrocatalysts.									120	7	0	0	11	0	120			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000459630600023	30536845

Herein, an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst is designed and fabricated by encapsulating Co nanoparticles in interconnected N-doped hollow porous carbon nanofibers (designated as Co@N-C/PCNF) using an ultrafast high-temperature shock technology. Benefiting from the synergistic effect and intrinsic activity of the Co-N-C moiety, as well as porous structure of carbon nanofibers, the Co@N-C/PCNF composite shows high bifunctional electrocatalytic activities for both OER (289 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and ORR (half-wave potential of 0.85 V).

The role of sulfur in Ni-sulfide was found to be an activator that transformed sulfide into hydroxide, which was eventually transformed into (oxy)hydroxide. The Ni-(oxy)hydroxide phase was also found to be layered and/or amorphous. This activated catalyst showed significant enhancement in water oxidation performance with a low overpotential value of 256 WV at current density of 10 mA cm -2.

The difficulty comes from not only the low intrinsic activity, but also the structural uncertainty of catalysts under the operating conditions. Therefore, finding the relationship between structural evolution and the OER activity is urgently required. At present, first-principles simulations have become a powerful tool to understand the mechanism of the OER at the atomic level. In this review, TiO2, MnOx, and CoS2 are used as examples to demonstrate how first-principles calculations can predict the morphology of nanoparticles, explore the pathway of electrochemically induced phase transition, and resolve the structure of a heterojunction. With these new theoretical techniques, the structure-activity relationship of the OER for a complex catalytic system can be determined without experimental inputs. Such a bottom-up strategy holds great promise to reveal the active site and mechanism of a complex catalytic system from first-principles calculations.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000471314900007	30614211

Mixed Ni-Fe catalysts have showed excellent activities towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER), however, the long-term stability at high current densities has not been well-documented. Here we fabricate three-dimensional (3D) self-supported Ni1-x-FexOOH/carbon fiber cloth (CFC) electrodes for highly efficient oxygen evolution through in situ electrochemical activation of the corresponding 3D Ni1-x-FexS/CFC precursors. The activated Ni-Fe electrodes exhibit remarkably enhanced OER activities compared to the pure Ni and Fe catalysts and the highest OER activity is achieved as x = 0.30. To drive current densities of 100 and 200 mA cm(-2), the 3D Ni0.70Fe0.30OOH/CFC electrode in 1.0 M KOH only requires overpotentials of 200 and 205 mV, respectively, outperforming the commercial IrO2 catalyst and all previously reported Ni-Fe catalysts. Furthermore, the Ni0.70Fe0.30OOH/CFC electrode can continuously operate at > 350 mA cm(-2) over 100 hours with a negligible current loss in 1.0 M KOH. Such excellent activity and robust long-term stability at high current density demonstrate that the 3D Ni-Fe catalysts can applied in industry for large-scale oxygen production.

Herein, a CoAl-CO32- SL-LDH which stays stable in water and powdery state is first synthesized using ethylene glycol as a reaction medium. The SL-LDH, with thickness of similar to 0.85 nm, is composed of one Co(Al)O-6 layer sandwiched between two CO32- layers. The SL-LDH powder shows high specific surface area (similar to 289 m(2)/g) and excellent electrocatalytic oxygen evolution efficiency. This work provides the first simple way to prepare CO32- SL-LDHs and will open an avenue for synthesizing other SL-LDHs.									31	3	0	0	1	0	32			1944-8244			WOS:000404090000003	28590111

We report a synthetic method to obtain IrxCo/C clusters by polyol reduction. The catalyst is small in size and can be evenly distributed. The Ir3Co/C cluster catalyst had very good activity under acidic conditions. The overpotential of the best-performing Ir3Co/C cluster for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is only 290 mV and 91 mV when 10 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2). The catalyst performance may be improved because of the synergistic effect and the small size of the prepared catalyst, which accelerates proton transfer.

Herein, IrO(2)pIr/TiN electrocatalysts employing TiN as the support have been developed and shown high efficiency toward OER. TiN is found not only to disperse the IrO2@Ir nanoparticles effectively but also to exert the electronic modulation of Ir by downshifting its d-band center of 0.21 eV compared to pure IrO2. Excitingly, TiN remarkably enhances the catalytic performance of Ir, where the overpotential to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is only 265 mV for the IrO(2)pIr/TiN (60 wt %) catalyst. As a result, 71.7 wt % of the Ir metal can be saved to compare with the commercial Ir-black counterpart. Moreover, TiN can inhibit the aggregation and oxidative dissolution of Ir species, thereby enhancing the operational stability. The combined advantages of TiN open a new solution to reduce the anodic catalyst cost through boosting the catalytic activity and stability.									52	1	0	0	1	0	53			1944-8244			WOS:000449887600039	30335932

Herein, amorphous FeCo hydroxides are controllably electroplated onto nickel mesh to produce binder-free bifunctional FeCo-LDH/NM electrodes for water splitting.

As a promising candidate, metallic Co4N already demonstrated electrocatalytic performance relying on specific nanostructures and electronic configurations. Herein, nickel was introduced as the dopant into one-dimensional (1D) hierarchical Co4N structures, achieving effective electronic regulation of Co4N toward high OER performance. The amount of Co3+ increased after Ni-doping, and the in-situ formed surface oxyhydroxide during OER enhanced the electrocatalytic kinetics. Meanwhile, the 1D hierarchical structure further promoted the performances of Co4N owing to the high electrical conductivity and abundant active-sites on the rough surface. As expected, the optimal Ni-doped Co4N with a Ni/Co molar ratio of 0.25 provides a small overpotential of 233 mV at a current density of 10 mAcm(-2), with a low Tafel slope of 61 mV dec(-1), and high long-term stability in 1.0 mol L-1 KOH.

Herein, we synthesized core shell structured ZIF67@ZIF8 and converted it into Co decorated porous carbons (CS-Co/Cs) consisting of the ZIF67 derived uniformly dispersed Co nanoparticles encapsulated in graphitic carbon as cores and the ZIF8 derived porous carbon as shells. Compared to individual ZIF67 derived samples (Co/Cs), the unique structure of CS-Co/Cs leads to the larger surface area and more hydrophilic surface, both of which facilitate the mass transfer, contributing to the enhanced OER performance.

OER (oxygen evolution reaction) is an extremely important research field in electrochemistry, and several OER catalysts are investigated in order to reduce overpotential and to improve their catalytic activity. Transition metal oxides have so much of attention as potential catalysts for OER because of their excellent catalytic activity and affordable cost. Introduction of various forms of defects can significantly alter the structural characteristics of TMOs (transition metal oxides). Focusing on this point, the current review critically analyse all the types of defect, point defects, line defects and plane defects, which play a significant role in enhancing the activity of catalyst. Defect engineering strategies and the mechanisms by which these defect centers will boost the activity of the catalyst is also demonstrated with high priority in view of the last five years scientific reports, while not at all ignored the previous history. Apart from the advancements in the field the core science behind electrocatalytic OER in acidic, basic as well as neutral medium, characteristics of an OER electrocatalyst, expressions for evaluating catalyst activity measures and various strategies in use for boosting the efficiency of TMOs towards OER, were also discussed in depth.

Feasible structural design can facilitate electron transport and increase specific surface area. Herein, the porous CoP4/FeP4 hollow cubes are synthesized by two steps: synthesizing the Co-Fe prussian blue analogues via co-precipitation and phosphating it by calcination. The construction of heterojunction in CoP4/FeP4 not only accelerates electronic transmission but also provides active sites, which acts synergistically on the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions. Therefore, the CoP4/FeP4 hollow cubes with the exist of mesoporous exhibit the promising performance for water splitting. The enhanced performance that basically originates from bimetallic synergy and unique morphological structure is acquired with a low overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and the Tafel slope of 42.4 mV dec-1 towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Electrolyzer with two-electrode system assemble by utilizing the CoP4/FeP4 hybrid as anode and cathode exhibits a cell voltage of 1.74 V to achieve 10 mA cm-2 for overall water splitting.

Herein, by in-suit construction of the heterostructure between MgO and NiCo2S4 on carbon cloth (CC), a novel MgO/NiCo2S4 heterostructure on CC (MgO/NCS-CC) is successfully fabricated. Benefitting from the optimized electronic structure attributed to the construction of heterointerface, and the intense adsorption of H2O on the surface of catalysts owing to the introduction of hydration-effect-promoting (HEP) element Mg, the MgO/NCS-CC exhibits outstanding OER activity with overpotential of 145 mV at the current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) in pH-neutral electrolyte and can maintain stability over 40 h. Density-functional theory (DFT) also demonstrates that the MgO/NiCo2S4 heterostructure can effectively adjust the electronic structure and enhance the adsorption of reactant, thus further optimizing Gibbs free energies and improving the activity for OER in pH-neutral electrolyte.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000803750800001

The presence of hydroxyl functional groups on the surface of HNT is more suitable for O2 evolution reaction (OER). The HNT based electrocatalyst coated on Ni foam substrate shows excellent water oxidation activity with an overpotential of 287 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and have excellent stability in alkaline electrolyte solution over 32 h without any decay. The adsorption of OHspecies occurs on the surface of HNT from the alkaline electrolyte via one-electron transfer, the metal cation underwent repeated oxidation and reduction reactions during the OER.

However, Li-oxygen cell rechargeability is limited by cathode passivation due to nonconductive discharge products. Despite efforts to efficiently oxidize these products, oxygen recovery remains poor at potentials where cell constituents are stable. Transition metal oxide (TMO) cathodes have shown low charging potentials, but a correspondence to improved oxygen evolution efficiency is debated. This is because the deposition of electrically insulating Li2O2 during the battery discharge could passivate the TMO surfaces and render them inactive for catalyzing oxygen evolution during charge. Contrary to this, we show that TMOs enable charging at low overpotentials without compromising the oxygen evolution efficiency. Charge potentials are lowered by 130-400 mV in batteries employing TMO-based cathodes compared to carbon-only cathodes. By a combination of current-sensing atomic force microscopy and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, we show that Li2O2 has a greater propensity for deposition on carbon surfaces and only sparingly covers the RuO2 surfaces. Our results suggest that chemically heterogeneous cathodes containing (1) surfaces that favor Li2O2 growth and (2) surfaces that are catalytically active but do not promote Li2O2 deposition can decrease charge overpotentials without decreasing oxygen evolution efficiency.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1932-7447			WOS:000393008900003

However, it is an urgent problem to construct bifunctional electrocatalysts for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution performance. Herein, we adopted Ag nanowires as templates to prepare one-dimensional Ag nanowire@ZIF-8@ZIF-67 precursors (1D AgNW@ZIF-8@ZIF-67). Through pyrolysis, AgNW@ZIF-8@ZIF-67 precursors transformed into nitrogen-doped carbon frameworks (NCF) embedded with zinc-cobalt (ZnCo) nanoparticles on the surface of Ag NWs (denoted as Ag@ZnCo/NCF nanohybrids). The nanohybrids were consisted of Ag NWs with good conductivity and ZnCo/NCF nanohybrids with rich accessible active sites. Benefiting from their large specific surface area, accessible active sites and synergistic effect among components, Ag@ZnCo/NCF nanohybrids exhibit lower overpotentials of 139 mV and 279 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solution, severally. Compared with other catalysts, Ag@ZnCo/NCF nanohybrids possess smaller Tafel slope, indicating their higher catalytic activity.

As a proof-of-concept, in this communication, we tailor the unique perovskite oxides/(CoFe)P-2 heterointerfaces on the surface of La0.8Sr1.2Co0.2Fe0.8O4+delta (LSCF) layered perovskite oxides through an in-situ reducing and phosphating process. XRD, SEM and TEM characterizations show that island-like (CoFe)P-2 nanoparticles with a diameter of similar to 20 nm are generated, which adjusts the oxygen vacancy of perovskite oxides and accelerates the charge transfer during the OER. As a result, a small OER overpotential of 350 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), an excellent OER activity with a Tafel slope of 64 mV dec(-1) and a stability over 1000 cycles are obtained, which outperform commercial IrO2 and most reported perovskite oxides based electrocatalysts.

Herein, an efficient solution to the search for MXene-based bifunctional catalysts is proposed by introducing non-noble metals such as Fe/Co/Ni at the surfaces. These results indicate that the ultrahigh activities in Ni1/Ni2- and Fe1/Ni2-modified MXene-based double-atom catalysts (DACs) for bifunctional ORR/OER are better than those of well-known unifunctional catalysts with low overpotentials, such as Pt(111) for the ORR and IrO2(110) for the OER. Strain can profoundly regulate the catalytic activities of MXene-based DACs, providing a novel pathway for tunable catalytic behavior in flexible MXenes. An electrochemical model, based on density functional theory and theoretical polarization curves, is proposed to reveal the underlying mechanisms, in agreement with experimental results. Electronic structure analyses indicate that the excellent catalytic activities in the MXene-based DACs are attributed to the electron-capturing capability and synergistic interactions between Fe/Co/Ni adsorbents and MXene substrate. These findings not only reveal promising candidates for MXene-based bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts but also provide new theoretical insights into rationally designing noble-metal-free bifunctional DACs.									37	1	0	0	0	0	37			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000680534500001	34342921

For the first time, in this study, OER for cobalt and gold was investigated in Fe and Ni-free KOH. This paper is highlighted the role of impurities in electrolyte for OER.

These catalysts mainly contain macropores which can provide sufficient surface area for active sites. With metal oxides depositing on CNTs, it overcomes some drawbacks such as low conductivity and agglomeration of metal oxides. The catalysts show great electrocatalytic toward ORR and OER even comparing with commercial Pt-C/RuO2 catalysts. Through constructing an air battery and testing the performance of cycling, the stability of the catalyst can also be proved. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Having previously identified the catalyst as a manganese (III) oxide with alpha-Mn2O3 crystallinity, in this study we further characterize the catalyst surface to understand changes in the surface chemistry under different reaction conditions. We identify key electrochemical features of the catalyst using cyclic voltammetry and then probe the changes in the surface oxidation state of manganese in the potential region between the ORR and the OER using ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Despite the surface sensitivity of XPS, these measurements do not reveal any differences in surface oxidation state between samples tested at ORR potentials and those examined at potentials relevant to the OER. We show, however, that electrochemical methods can discern a difference in oxidation states of the two samples upon re-insertion of the samples into an electrochemical cell after the completion of ex-situ XPS measurements. These results suggest that oxidative processes on the catalyst surface are extremely shallow, which we quantify based on the experimental results and theoretical modeling of the XPS spectra.

Here we report a hybrid composite of cobalt nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon (Co/N-C) via a solvothermal carbonization strategy. With the synergistic effect arising from the N-doped carbon and cobalt nanoparticles in the composite, the Co/N-C hybrid catalyst exhibits highly efficient bifunctional catalytic activity and excellent stability toward both ORR and OER. The Delta E (oxygen electrode activity parameter for judging the overall electrocatalytic activity of a bifunctional electrocatalyst) value for Co/N-C is 0.859 V, which is smaller than those of Pt/C and most of the non-precious metal catalysts in previous studies. Furthermore, the Co/N-C composite also shows better bifunctional catalytic activity than its oxidative counterparts, which could be attributed to the high specific surface area and the efficient charge transfer ability of the composite, as well as the good synergistic effect between N-doped carbon and the Co nanoparticles in the Co/N-C composite.									433	15	0	0	17	0	433			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000345458200061	25369741

One direction to solve this issue is to understand elementary steps of electrode processes and build an unconventional strategy for a conversion of inert and, therefore, stable materials into efficient catalysts. Herein, we propose a simple concept for obtaining catalysts from inert and hence stable materials by forming their heterojunctions, namely, covering inert Au with corrugated carbon nitrogen-based two-dimensional porous frameworks. It shows more than 10 times better activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction than for the pure Au surface, and it also demonstrates the high catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) via an effective four-electron reduction mechanism, which is different from the usual two electron reduction typical for ORR on Au surfaces. This activity induced by formation of a heterojunction was analyzed by a conjugation of computational and experimental methods and found to originate from alternative efficient reaction pathways that emerged by the corrugated porous framework and the Au surface. This work provides not only the method for creating active surface but also the knowledge on elementary steps of such complicated multielectron transfer reactions, thereby leading to intriguing strategies for developing energy conversion reactions based on materials which had never been considered as catalysts before.									37	1	0	0	1	0	37			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000395357300070	28135413

High resolution inkjet printing was used to produce 5456 discrete oxide compositions containing the elements nickel, iron, cobalt and cerium. The catalytic performance of each of these compositions was measured under conditions applicable to distributed solar fuels generation using a three-electrode scanning drop electrochemical cell. The catalytic activity and stability of representative compositions (Ni0.5Fe0.3Co0.17Ce0.03Ox and Ni0.3Fe0.07Co0.2Ce0.43Ox) from 2 distinct regions were verified by resynthesizing these compositions on glassy carbon rods for electrochemical testing. The activity of the new Ce-rich catalysts was further verified using an unrelated synthetic method to electrodeposit a pseudo-ternary composition Ni0.2Co0.3Ce0.5Ox, which produced a catalyst with 10 mA cm(-2) oxygen evolution current at 310 mV over-potential. The unique Tafel behavior of these Ce-rich catalysts affords the opportunity for further improvement.									123	8	0	0	10	0	127			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000331413700021

Nevertheless, the monotonic performance and insufficient stability severely hamper their practical application in rechargeable batteries. Herein, we simultaneously combine ultrathin NiFe-LDH nanowalls with renewable soybean-derived Fe-N-C matrix to obtain a hybrid materials (NiFe-LDH/FeSoy-CNSs-A), which exhibits robust catalytic activities for OER (E-j=10 = 1.53 V vs. RHE) and ORR (E-1/2 = 0.91 V vs. RHE), with a top-notch battery parameters and stability in assembled rechargeable Zn-air batteries. Intensive investigations indicate that the vertically dispersed NiFe-LDH nanosheets, Fe-N-C matrix derived from soybean and the strong synergy between them are responsible for the unprecedented OER and ORR performances. The key role of intrinsic N defects involved in the hybrid materials is firstly specified by ultrasoundassisted extraction of soy protein from soybean. The exquisite design can facilitate the utilization of sustainable biomass-derived catalysts, and the mechanism investigations of N defects and oxygenic groups on the structure-activity relationship can stimulate the progress of other functional hybrid electrocatalysts.									22	1	0	0	0	0	22			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000593100400001

Herein, an interface engineering concept has been proposed to achieve high-performance Ag-PBSC (Ag-PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+delta) heterostructure nanofibers catalyst. Benefiting from the significant ligand action and interparticle cooperation of exsolved Ag NPs and PBSC double perovskite, ORR/OER catalytic kinetics have been successfully boosted. In details, the PBSC double perovskite possessing abundant oxygen vacancies can provide oxygen channels and facilitate the transfer of electrons and oxygen. The embedded Ag NPs can deliver superior catalytic durability for the heterostructure interface. As expected, the as-synthesized Ag-PBSC heterostructure catalyst performs a favorable electrochemical performance in the oxygen-based applications. In alkaline media, the catalyst exhibits an excellent activity for ORR (E-onset: 0.88 V vs. RHE and E-1/2: 0.72 V vs. RHE) and OER (1.67 V at 10 mA cm(-2)). When adopting the Ag-PBSC heterostructure catalyst in LOBs, the corresponding battery provides an outperforming capacity performance (13 000 mAh g(-1)), low discharge-charge polarization (1.37 V), and considerable cycling performance (128 cycles at the restricted capacity of 3 000 mAh g(-1) and 400 mA g(-1)). Apparently, the work described here confirms that the interface engineering of perovskites can open up opportunities to develop highly active and durable heterostructure electrocatalysts for multitudinous oxygen-based electrochemical applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000727347700001

Here, we report a perovskite structure Sr0.9M0.1RuO3-delta (SMRO, M=K, Na, Ag) synthesized via sol-gel method performing excellent bifunctional catalytic activity. With the metal ion (M+) doping in A-site, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis reveals that oxygen vacancy and lattice oxygen are introduced into the structure, which is confirmed as the primary reason for the improvement of catalytic activity. The highest OER and ORR activity among these four samples is observed in Sr0.9Ag0.1RuO3 (SARO). This work may shed light on the designing of high-efficiency bifunctional OER/ORR electrocatalysts.

LMO-NR/RGO composites are synthesized by using cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as template via a simple hydrothermal reaction followed by heat treatment; overlaying of Ag nanoparticles is obtained through a traditional silver mirror reaction. Electron microscopy reveals that LMO-NR is embedded between the sheets of RGO, and the material is homogeneously overlaid with Ag nanoparticles. The unique composite morphology of Ag/LMO-NR/RGO not only enhances the electron transport property by increasing conductivity but also facilitates the diffusion of electrolytes and oxygen. As confirmed by electrochemical testing, Ag/LMO-NR/RGO exhibits very strong synergy with Ag nanoparticles, LMO-NR, and RGO, and the catalytic activities of Ag/LMO-NR/RGO during ORR and OER are significantly improved. With the novel catalyst, the homemade zinc-air battery can be reversibly charged and discharged and display a stable cycle performance, indicating the great potential of this composite as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for metal-air batteries.

In this work, yolk-shell Ni3Fe/Ni3FeN was prepared by a spray-pyrolysis technique, which could be scaleable. The yolk-shell Ni3Fe/Ni3FeN presents excellent catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with overpotentials of 268 and 166mV at 10mAcm(-2), respectively, and bears a prominent electrochemical durability. Overall water splitting with an electrolyzer containing the yolk-shell Ni3Fe/Ni3FeN as the cathode and anode only requires a cell voltage of 1.62V to reach a current density of 10mAcm(-2). The present research not only introduces a new route for the synthesis of advanced functional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting but also sheds light on their potential commercial applications.									26	2	0	0	1	0	26			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000417561000011	28846207

In this work, novel hafnium phosphide-reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (HfP-rGO NS) and hafnium disulfide-reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (HfS2-rGO NS) were synthesized and investigated as bifunctional electrocatalysts for OER and ORR. The prepared HfP-rGO NS and HfS2-rGO NS catalysts showed nanosheet structures, where the HfP or HfS2 nanosheet was closely packed with rGO. A unique methodology was adopted to lodge the non-metal oxide catalytic sheets (i.e., HfP and HfS2) over the rGO sheets, which positioned the oxide layer on the catalytic sheet surface for instant oxygen evolution. Low intensity X-ray diffraction patterns and Raman spectra confirmed the sheet-like structure of HfP-rGO NS and HfS2-rGO NS. Scanning electron microscope mapping images revealed that all elements (i.e., Hf, P, C and O for HfP-rGO NS and Hf, S, C and O for HfS2-rGO NS) were equally distributed in the synthesized heteroatomic nanosheets. Moreover, both the HfP-rGO NS and HfS2-rGO NS demonstrated excellent durability for both ORR and OER. This outperforms the most state-of-the-art non-precious-metal-based bifunctional catalysts, which is attributed to the synergistic effect of rGO and Hf-based catalysts. The different ORR and OER reaction potentials in HfP-rGO NS and HfS2-rGO NS likely result from the influence of HfP and HfS2.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8				2046-2069		WOS:000457379300033	35520513

A recent study has demonstrated that the intrinsic activity of catalysts is strongly associated with diverse electronic structure parameters; therefore, designing an effective strategy to optimize electronic structures in multiple aspects is highly attractive for realizing high-performance OER catalysts. Here, we report a facile A/B-site cosubstitution strategy to regulate the electronic structures of oxygen-deficient brownmillerite oxides for optimizing the OER performance. Cosubstitution of strontium and cobalt into Ca2Fe2O5 parent oxide is found to be very effective in enhancing the OER catalytic performance. Combined soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis and density functional theory calculations show that optimized CaSrCoFeO6-delta (CSCF) is endowed with multiple advantageous electronic structure features for OER catalysis including favorable valence, orbital, and spin states of metal ions and an upshifted O 2p-band center as well as high metal-oxygen covalency. Benefiting from these ideal electronic structure parameters, CSCF exhibits ultrahigh OER activity with a low overpotential of only 330 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH, outperforming noble metal RuO2 and various state-of-the-art metal oxides ever reported while maintaining robust stability as evidenced by operando spectroscopy.									20	1	0	0	1	0	20			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000674266000037

Herein, we present a study of epitaxial manganite perovskite thin films (Pr1-xCaxMnO3) active for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) from electro-catalytic water splitting. X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) at the Mn L- and O K-edges, as well as X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) of the O 1s and Ca 2p states have been performed in ultra-high vacuum and in water vapor under positive applied bias at room temperature. It is shown that under the oxidizing conditions of the OER a reduced Mn2+ species is generated at the catalyst surface. The Mn valence shift is accompanied by the formation of surface oxygen vacancies. Annealing of the catalysts in O-2 atmosphere at 120 degrees C restores the virgin surfaces.									57	0	0	0	4	0	57			2073-4344			WOS:000339590600004

Here, a simple approach for the facile construction of a defective nanocarbon material is reported with B and N dopants (B,N-carbon) as a superior bifunctional metal-free catalyst for both ORR and OER. The catalyst is prepared by pyrolyzing the composites of ethyl cellulose and high-boiling point 4-(1-naphthyl)benzeneboronic acid in NH3 atmosphere with an inexpensive Zn-based template. The obtained porous B,N-carbon with rich carbon defects exhibits excellent ORR and OER performances, including high activity and stability. In alkaline medium, B,N-carbon material shows high ORR activity with an onset potential (E-onset) reaching 0.98 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), very close to that of Pt/C, a high electron transfer number and excellent stability. This catalyst also presents the admirable ORR activity in acidic medium with a high E-onset of 0.81 V versus RHE and a four-electron process. The OER activity of B,N-carbon is superior to that of the precious metal RuO2 and Pt/C catalysts. A Zn-air battery using B,N-carbon as the air cathode exhibits a low voltage gap between charge and discharge and long-term stability. The excellent electrocatalytic performance of this porous nanocarbon material is attributed to the combined positive effects of the abundant carbon defects and the heteroatom codopants.									142	10	0	0	7	0	145			2198-3844			WOS:000439842100015	30027038

Herein, we report an advanced nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon (NMC) composite (NiCo2O4/CoNx-NMC) formed from a mixture of Co- and Ni-hydroxide-infiltrated phenolic resin and melamine resin. This composite exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity, stability, and selectivity for the ORR and OER. The activity parameter (Delta E), which is an indicator of the overall catalytic activity of bifunctional catalysts, was 0.76 V for NiCo2O4/CoNx-NMC. Therefore, catalyst outperforms the majority of previously reported non-precious metal-based bifunctional electrocatalysts. The remarkable ultra-high catalytic performance of NiCo2O4/CoNx-NMC for the ORR and OER can be attributed to the presence of different active sites of the CoNx structure and the formation of NiCo2O4 with the spinel structure, which was obtained by a stepwise pyrolysis process. This synthesis strategy opens a new avenue for the rational design of highly active bifunctional electrocatalysts.									33	12	0	0	1	0	33			1001-0521	1867-7185		WOS:000503717900001

Herein, we report the successful synthesis of N-, O-, and S-doped carbon encapsulated Ni,S, and NiS core-shell architectures (Ni3S2/NiS/NOSCs) by pyrolysis of S- and Ni(II)-containing polypyrrole solid precursors, producing carbon-encapsulated Ni3S2 composites (Ni3S2/NOSCs), followed by the conversion of the Ni3S2 core's surface into NiS shell with concentrated HCl solution. The materials are proven to serve as bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media. Notably, Ni3S2/NiS/NOSC-900, pyrolyzed at 900 degrees C, exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic performance toward HER with a low overpotential of 180 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 83 mV dec(-1), and a good long-term stability of 15 h. Moreover, it can also efficiently electrolyze ORR with good performance, affording positive onset and half-wave potentials and high electron transfer number (similar to 4), as well as robust stability and methanol crossover tolerance. The materials' excellent catalytic activities might be attributed to the synergistic effect between NOSC layers and Ni3S2/NiS core-shell nanostructures, as well as the interface effect between the NiS and Ni3S2 phases.									39	2	0	0	0	0	39			2168-0485			WOS:000449577200215

Synthesized materials are of nanoparticulate nature and show a single phase diffraction pattern conforming to a tetragonal oxide of the rutile structural type. Magnesium ions are not distributed homogeneously in the material, but exist in Mg-rich clusters as shown by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The refinement of the Mg EXAFS functions for materials with low Mg content shows that the magnesium rich clusters contain Mg in a highly strained environment similar to that of the rutile-type structure. The Mg environment shifts to an ilmenite-type inclusion when Mg occupies more than 10% of all cationic positions. All Mg modified materials are active in oxygen evolution and chlorine evolution reactions. Although the Mg containing catalysts show lower overall activities compared with the non-doped ruthenia, they feature enhanced selectivity toward the chlorine evolution process, which is attributed primarily to the opening of a reaction pathway for chlorine evolution associated with presence of Mg modified active sites.

Here, a new type of binder-free hollow TiO2@Co9S8 core-branch arrays is developed as highly active OER and HER electrocatalysts for stable overall water splitting. Hollow core-branch arrays of TiO2@Co9S8 are readily realized by the rational combination of crosslinked Co9S8 nanoflakes on TiO2 core via a facile and powerful sulfurization strategy. Arising from larger active surface area, richer/shorter transfer channels for ions/electrons, and reinforced structural stability, the as-obtained TiO2@Co9S8 core-branch arrays show noticeable exceptional electrocatalytic performance, with low overpotentials of 240 and 139 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) as well as low Tafel slopes of 55 and 65 mV Dec(-1) for OER and HER in alkaline medium, respectively. Impressively, the electrolysis cell based on the TiO2@Co9S8 arrays as both cathode and anode exhibits a remarkably low water splitting voltage of 1.56 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and long-term durability with no decay after 10 d. The versatile fabrication protocol and smart branch-core design provide a new way to construct other advanced metal sulfides for energy conversion and storage.									149	14	0	0	10	0	149			2198-3844			WOS:000428310500018	29593976

Controllable fabrication of MOFs materials at macro-scale may be more promising for their large-scale practical applications. Here we report the synthesis of macro-scale Co-MOFs crystals using 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (H3BTC) linker in the presence of Co2+, triethylamine (TEA) and nonanoic acid by a facile solvothermal reaction. Further, the as-fabricated Co-MOFs as precursor was pyrolytically treated at different temperatures in N-2 atmosphere to obtain metallic Co nanoparticles embedded in N-doped porous carbon layers (denoted as Co@NPC). The results demonstrate that the Co-MOFs derived sample obtained at 900 degrees C (Co@NPC-900) shows a porous structure (including micropore and mesopore) with a surface area of 110.8 m(2) g(-1) and an N doping level of 1.62 at.% resulted from TEA in the pyrolysis process. As electrocatalyst, the Co@NPC-900 exhibits bifunctional electrocatalytic activities toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media which are key reactions in some renewable energy technologies such as fuel cells and rechargeable metal-air batteries. The results indicate that the Co@NPC-900 can afford an onset potential of 1.50 V (vs. RHE) and a potential value of 1.61 V (vs. RHE) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for ORR and OER with high applicable stability, respectively. The efficient catalytic activity of Co@NPC-900 as bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst can be ascribed to N doping and embedded metallic Co nanoparticles in carbon structure providing catalytic active sites and porous structure favourable for electrocatalysis-related mass transport.

The binary Ru-Sn oxides in various compositions show the typical oxide solid solution in the rutile phase. Among all binary Ru-Sn oxides, RuSn73 (70 atom % RuO2 and 30 atom % SnO2) and RuSn37 (30 atom % RuO2 and 70 atom % SnO2) show the highest catalytic activities toward the OER and ORR, respectively. Consequently, a novel design of the air electrode consisting of a RuSn37 coating on the carbon paper and a Ti mesh coated with RuSn73 (denoted RuSn(37-Cl73-Ti)) is proposed to possess the optimal charge-discharge performances. A unique cell employing such an air electrode has been demonstrated to exhibit a very low charge-discharge cell voltage gap of 0.75 V at 10 mA cm(-2). This cell with a peak power density of 120 mW cm(-2) at the current density of 235 mA cm(-2) also shows an outstanding charge-discharge stability over 80 h.

Fine-tuning the exposed active sites is a competent way to improve their performance. Herein, the NaCl template-assisted strategy for rationally designing a three-dimensional cellular structured nitrogen-doped carbon matrix integrated with nano-scaled Co species has been developed. The resulting elec-trocatalyst (3D Co/N-C) exhibits a positive half-wave potential of 0.84 V (vs RHE) in ORR, and a low potential of 1.56 V (vs RHE) at 10 mA cm-2 during OER process. Moreover, 3D Co/N-C based Zn-air Batteries (ZABs) exhibit excellent battery performance, especially remarkable power density. The poisoning experiments and DFT cal-culations identify active sites as pyridinic N and Co during ORR and OER processes, respectively. This work provides a general and easy-to-perform tactic to design bifunctional catalysts, thus helps precisely modulate effective components for ZABs.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773452600003

Herein, a new type of Co-doped Ce-N-C bifunctional electrocatalyst has been synthesized through a simple two-step method, which realizes the high dispersion of Co3O4 on the CeO2 carbon frame and stabilizes its specific surface area. Benefiting from the synergistic interaction between Co3O4 and CeO2, the conductivity of the electrocatalyst is improved and the oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen storage properties are promoted. The resultant Co3O4-CeO2@N-C catalyst shows remarkable ORR activity with the high initial potential (E (0) = 0.8 V), the large limiting current density (j (L) = 6 mA cm(-2)), and a low Tafel slope (81 mV dec(-1)). In full cell tests, Co3O4-CeO2@NC as the oxygen electrode exhibites superior charge/discharge capacity and excellent cycle stability.

A unified kinetic model describing the non-branching chain reacting processes induced by atomic-oxygen and synergistic effects on hydrogen-containing polymers is first constructed. A unified form of equations in terms of mass change of polymeric materials is then deduced by incorporating the kinetic model into the mass loss model due to Colin et al. The resulting equations can be simplified under certain conditions, and analytic solutions describing the nonlinear mass variation can be obtained via the bulk reactive rate in the fractal reaction dynamics. For demonstration, the mass change associated with four types of polyethylene and Kapton were simulated, and the results are in good agreement with the experimental data. The dependencies of the mass loss on crystallinity, the fractal dimensions of erosion surface, and environmental factors for all four types of polyethylene are explained briefly. The theoretical framework is generalized to yield a mass evolution prediction formula for heterogeneous media induced by the diffusion-reaction process of incoming particles impinging into the media. Hereby, mass losses of polymers such as Teflon FEP, etc., as well as polymer-layered silicate nanocomposites caused, respectively, by the vacuum ultraviolet irradiation and oxygen plasma are simulated. The fitted curves agree well with the experimental data. The validation through the chosen materials reveals that the present unified model is capable of providing a tool for evaluating the nonlinear mass loss of both polymers and nanocomposites.

However, the drawback of this concept is the severe carbon evaporation during their synthesis, resulting in a reduction of active sites and catalytic durability. To solve this problem, this study proposes the possibility of using Ketjen black (KB) to replenish the carbon content. Impressively, MOF-derived bimetal and oxide N-doped porous carbon (CoNi-CoO-NiO@NC-800) exhibits extremely high catalytic activity with an oxygen reduction reaction (half-wave potential: 0.83 V) and oxygen evolution reaction (overpotential: 352 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2)) potential gap of 0.75 V due to the virtue of the hierarchically porous structure and sufficient active sites. By combining theoretical studies, a strong synergetic coupling of the CoNi dual metal is proposed in decreasing the overall reaction barriers and promoting the reversible oxygen reactions. Moreover, the assembled liquid- and all-solid-state Zn-air batteries (ZABs) with the bifunctional catalyst as the air cathode demonstrate superior discharging (223 mW cm(-2) at 310 mA cm(-2)) and charging-discharging performance and long lifetime (450 cycles, 75 h). This work will provide guidance for the rational design of metal/carbon hybrid catalysts and cut-price reproducible energy systems.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000708632400001	34666342

The Te surface termination forms a TeO2 skin in an oxygen environment. In ambient atmosphere, passivation is achieved in less than 30 min with the TeO2 skin having a thickness of about 7 angstrom. NiTe2 shows outstanding tolerance to CO exposure and stability in water environment, with subsequent good performance in both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. NiTe2-based devices consistently demonstrate superb ambient stability over a timescale as long as one month.

The overall water electrolyzer using PNOF as anode and cathode can achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low voltage of 1.52 V with excellent long-term stability, which is superior to precious metal catalysts of Pt/C and Ir/C.

We report for the first time an easy procedure for a unique nitrogen-rich sandwich-architectured catalyst (CoNP@NC/NG) as a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for ORR and OER. Physical characterizations confirmed the coexistence of Co2P and CoxN crystal phases in the nanostructure. The as-prepared CoNP@NC/NG exhibited potent bifunctional electrochemical performance with superior positive onset potential, large kinetic current density, and outstanding stability toward both ORR and OER, thereby showing excellent activities compared with Pt/C and state-of-the-art nonprecious catalysts. The excellent performance could have originated from the robust conjugation between the Co2P and CoxN crystal structures leading to a synergistic effect of the two interfaces, and the carbon shell also increased the number of nitrogen active sites. Moreover, the integrated structure of CoNP@NC/NG provided high electrical conductivity and facilitated electron transfer. Furthermore, the rechargeable zinc-air battery testing of CoNP@NC/NG-700 revealed good performance and long-term stability. The current work provided a new pathway to design bifunctional catalysts with multiple crystal phases for energy conversion and storage.									127	3	0	0	9	0	128			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000379493500025

The total overvoltage eta for hydrogen evolution was divided into two components (eta(1) and eta(2)) corresponding to the elementary reactions. The mechanism of the hydrogen evolution reaction was analyzed on the basis of the dependence of eta(1) and eta 2 on current density.

Additionally, they show great potential as bifunctional catalysts for the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) in an alka -line medium. However, to compete with state-of-the-art catalysts, the nature of the active sites and the surface stability under reaction conditions need to be understood in depth. Here, we present a principle study on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), evaluating the surface behavior under both ORR and OER conditions in 0.1 M KOH. We use noise analysis in electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (n-EC-STM) to monitor and compare ORR and OER active sites with resolution down to the nanoscale. Furthermore, surface degradation can be evaluated during the operation. We find that close to the re-spective reaction onset, step sites and defects are active for both ORR and OER. Terraces sites are largely inactive and only become involved in the OER at higher potentials. This could imply corrosion of the carbon. However, since the observed surface structures remain unaltered before and after applying the OER in our experiments, we find no clear evidence of surface destruction. These fundamental insights could inspire further research concerning the active sites and stability of carbon-based catalysts as well as carbon support structures, to discover ways to tune the surface activity and stability to the dedicated purpose.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the development of highly efficient, low-cost and durable electrocatalysts remains an ongoing challenge in industrial applications. Herein, a strategy integrating vacancy engineering and metal doping was proposed to design and screen M@CuS catalysts with excellent catalytic activity via density functional theory (DFT) calculations. TM single atoms anchored by the vacancy of the CuS surface show high stability, and serve as the active centers for water splitting. Ti@CuS and Co@CuS exhibit exceptional performance towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Ti@CuS and Co@CuS can achieve hydrogen adsorption free energies (Delta G(H*)) of 0.01 eV and -0.03 eV, respectively. The HER process of Ti@CuS is controlled by the Heyrovsky mechanism. Co@CuS also shows superior catalytic activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and presents a relatively lower OER overpotential of 0.41 V. Co@CuS serves as a promising candidate of bifunctional HER/OER electrocatalysts. This work not only provides highly efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting, but also inspires a novel concept to guide the extending design of catalysts in other catalysis fields.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000789984900001	35504047

The critical challenges that limit the practical use of this technology include sluggish kinetics of the electrochemical oxygen reactions on the cathode during discharging and charging. Here, urchin-like alpha-MnO2 materials decorated with Au and Pd nanoparticles are developed for use as a cathode catalyst for rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries with hybrid electrolytes. Au and Pd particles as large as 3-8 nm are uniformly dispersed on the vertically aligned nanorods of alpha-MnO2. The Au/alpha-MnO2 and Pd/alpha-MnO2 catalysts show excellent bi-functional activity for both oxygen reduction and evolution. A rechargeable Li-O-2 battery with a hybrid electrolyte is constructed using the nanostructured composite catalysts. Charging and discharging experiments of the batteries indicate that the metal-decorated, urchin-like alpha-MnO2 can be used as an efficient bi-functional catalyst for rechargeable hybrid Li-O-2 batteries.

A novel porous covalent phenanthroline framework (Fe-Phen-COFs) that involved Fe-DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) coordination complexes is successfully synthesized using 3, 8-dibromophenanthroline and 1, 3, 5-benzenetriboronicacid trivalent alcohol ester as a rigid building block via Suzuki coupling reaction. Fe-Phen-COFs as the self-carrier enriched with Fe, S, N, and C is pyrolyzed to produce N-S-codoping carbons with embedded core-shell Fe3C and FeS composite nanostructures (FeS/Fe3C@N-S-C). The FeS/Fe3C@N-S-C-800 obtained by pyrolysis at 800 degrees C exhibits efficient trifunctional electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) within a wide pH range. Impressively, the ORR half-potential of FeS/Fe3C@N-S-C-800 reaches 0.87 V in 0.1 m KOH, more positive than the previously reported Pt-free electrocatalysts. It could be utilized as the advanced air electrode materials in zinc-air batteries, which exhibit an excellent power density and cycling stability superior to those of Pt/C-based zinc-air battery. Thermal conversion of novel Fe-Phen-COFs provides an effective strategy to prepare high-performance trifunctional electrocatalytic materials for the new-generation powerful energy conversion technologies.									106	9	0	0	3	0	108			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000453604700014

The anodic deposition of a CeOx layer prevents the loss of such Fe species from the OER catalysts, achieving a highly stable performance. The CeOx layer does not affect the OER activity of the catalyst underneath but exhibits unique permselectivity, allowing the permeation of OH- and O-2 through while preventing the diffusion of redox ions through the layer to function as a selective O-2-evolving electrode. The use of such a permselective protective layer provides a new strategy for improving the durability of electrocatalysts.									74	4	0	0	2	0	75			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000423494500033	29206340

Herein, the electrocatalytic HER and OER activity of the conductive metal-benzenhexathiolate (M-BHT) frameworks has been evaluated utilizing first-principles calculations. The in-plane pi-d conjugation of M-BHT guarantees fast electron transfer during electrocatalytic reactions. Notably, Rh-BHT holds the promise of bifunctional HER/OER activity with the overpotentials of 0.07/0.36 V. Furthermore, the application of strain engineering tailors the adsorption of intermediates and promotes the overall water splitting performance. Rh-BHT with the +1% tensile strain shows the HER/OER overpotential of 0.02/0.37 V. This work not only demonstrates the prospects of conductive metal-organic frameworks in electrocatalysis but also offers new insights into designing efficient catalysts by strain engineering.

The effect of GDC loading was investigated, and 10 wt% GDC nanoparticle infiltration of the LSCF (10GDC/LSCF) anode results in the highest OER performance. Electrochemical impedance spectra measurements indicate that the infiltration by GDC nanoparticles greatly decreases the polarization resistance of the SOECs with the 1OGDC/LSCF anodes. The following distribution of relaxation time analysis suggests that four individual electrode processes are involved in the OER and that all of them are accelerated on the 10GDC/LSCF anode. Three phase boundaries, surface oxygen vacancies, and bulk oxygen mobility increased, based on scanning electron microscopy and temperature-programmed desorption of O-2 characterizations, and contributed to the enhancement of the four electrode processes of the OER and electrochemical performance of SOECs.

Herein, oxygen-doped nickel iron phosphide nanocube arrays (Ni2P/(NiFe)(2)P(O) NAs) grown on Ni foam is rationally designed and fabricated from PBAs. The porous structure and the synergistic effect of Ni and Fe enable superior electrocatalytic performance and stability toward the OER in alkaline electrolytes.

In 1 m KOH, the Ni2P/(NiFe)(2)P(O) NAs afford current densities of 10 and 800 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 150 and 530 mV, respectively, which outperform the commercial noble metal IrO2. Ni2P/(NiFe)(2)P(O) NAs also have long-term stability over 100 h at a high current density.

The distinctive atomistic and electronic structure characteristics of the edges of MoS2 imbue high reactivity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction. MoS2 is nevertheless characterized by significantly high overpotentials as compared to platinum. Here, we demonstrate that modulation of the electronic structure of MoS2 through interfacial hybridization with MoO3 and alloying of selenium on the anion sublattice allows for systematic lowering of the conduction band edge and raising of the valence band edge, respectively. The former promotes enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution, whereas the latter promotes enhanced activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction. Such alloyed heterostructures prepared by sol-gel reactions and hydrothermal selenization expose a high density of edge sites. The alloyed heterostructures exhibit low overpotential, high current density, high turnover frequency, and prolonged operational lifetime. The mechanistic origins of catalytic activity have been established based on electronic structure calculations and x-ray absorption and emission spectroscopy probes of electronic structure, which suggest that interfacial hybridization at the MoO3 interface yields low-lying conduction band states that facilitate hydrogen adsorption. In contrast, shallow Se 4p-derived states give rise to a raised effective valence band maximum, which facilitates adsorption of oxygen intermediates and engenders a low overpotential for the oxygen evolution reaction. The findings illustrate the use of electronic structure modulation through interfacial hybridization and alloying to systematically improve electrocatalytic activity.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2688-4070			INSPEC:20452891

Herein, for the first time, it is reported that the oxygen defect modulated Ti2Nb10O29-x (TNOx) on interlinked graphene array (denoted as TNO(x)G) can achieve a wide potential window up to 1.8 V in 1 m H2SO4 electrolyte and deliver an extremely high capacitance up to 368.9 F g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1). Accompanying the improved charge transfer efficiency and preferable H ion diffusion, the oxygen defects in TNO(x)G are capable of stimulating more pseudocapacitive behavior and simultaneously suppressing oxygen evolution reaction. Furthermore, a 1.4 V high voltage quasi-solid-state TNO(x)G-based symmetric supercapacitor is demonstrated, yielding a maximum energy density of 0.58 mWh cm(-3) at a power density of 0.57 W cm(-3) and exceptionally excellent cycling durability. It is believed that this strategy of oxygen defect modulation to optimize reaction kinetics will lead to further improvements in the performance of high-voltage aqueous SCs.									96	5	0	0	4	0	96			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000450367700024

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), with unsaturated active metal sites, functionalized organic linkers, and large surface areas, are emerging heterogeneous electrocatalysts for the water oxidation process.

The superior OER activities might be ascribed to more convenient electron transfer from the SnO2 additive to the electrode medium, effective surface area and unsaturated active cobalt centers, and more beneficial delivery for hydroxy radicals in the microporous Co-MOF skeleton in the process of the OER.									38	1	1	0	0	0	38			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000467351100055	30995020

The integrity of the catalyst layer is maintained without a polymer electrolyte membrane to facilitate minimization of electronic, protonic, and diffusion resistances of catalyst layer. A binder bonds the catalyst layer to gas diffusion layer and is selected from perfluorosulfonated ionomer or high-viscosity agent. USE - Gas diffusion electrode used in cathode for HER, anode for OER (all claimed) in PEM water electrolyzer.

Herein, a new modulation strategy is reported to the active moiety FeN4 via a precise "single-atom to single-atom" grafting of a Pt atom onto the Fe center through a bridging oxygen molecule, creating a new active moiety of Pt-1-O-2-Fe-1-N-4. The modulated Fe-N-C exhibits remarkably improved ORR stabilities in acidic media. Moreover, it shows unexpectedly high catalytic activities toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with overpotentials of 310 mV for OER in alkaline solution and 60 mV for HER in acidic media at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), outperforming the benchmark RuO2 and comparable with Pt/C(20%), respectively. The enhanced multifunctional electrocatalytic properties are associated with the newly constructed active moiety Pt-1-O-2-Fe-1-N-4, which protects Fe sites from harmful species. Density functional theory calculations reveal the synergy in the new active moiety, which promotes the proton adsorption and reduction kinetics. In addition, the grafted Pt-1-O-2- dangling bonds may boost the OER activity. This study paves a new way to improve and extend NPMCs electrocatalytic properties through a precisely single-atom to single-atom grafting strategy.									254	27	0	0	6	0	255			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000419327200006

This technology is however challenged by the lack of efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. Here we report on the synthesis of platinum-nickel hydroxide nanocomposites and their electrocatalytic applications for water reduction. An in situ reduction strategy taking advantage of the Ni(H)/Ni(III) redox has been developed to enable and regulate the overgrowth of Pt nanocrystals on single-layer Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets. The obtained nanocomposites (denoted as Pt@2D-Ni(OH)(2)) exhibit an improvement factor of 5 in catalytic activity and a reduction of up to 130 mV in overpotential compared to Pt for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A combination of electron microscopy/spectroscopy characterizations, electrochemical studies and density function theory calculations was employed to uncover the structures of the metal-hydroxide interface and understand the mechanisms of catalytic enhancement.									86	5	0	0	6	0	87			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000393446500052

Atomic steps, consisting of one-atom level covering the surface of such Ir NSs, were observed by aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM). The prepared Ir NSs exhibited remarkably enhanced activity both for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic medium. As a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting, they achieved a cell voltage of 1.535 V @ 10 mA/cm(2), which is much lower than that of Pt/C-Ir/C couple (1.630 V @ 10 mA/cm(2)).									15	1	0	0	0	0	16				1996-1944		WOS:000489126600187	31540464

This structure-activity relationship is demonstrated through a disorder-order transformation in LaA2Fe3O8 (A = Ca, Sr). The defect-ordered oxide, LaCa2Fe3O8, shows electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction, on par with that of the state-of-the-art precious metal catalyst RuO2. In addition, it is capable of catalyzing the other halfreaction of water-splitting, namely the hydrogen evolution reaction. Importantly, it is an iron-based catalyst and can be used as a single phase bulk material. The most important aspect of this work is the pronounced impact of defect order on the electrocatalytic properties of oxides.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2574-0962			WOS:000734172700004

Herein, we propose a simple strategy of integrating atomically dispersed and nanoscaled Co species embedded in micro-/mesoporous carbon nanosheet/nanotube architecture. Revealed by control and SCN poisoning experiments, N species and atomically dispersed Co species are the main active centers for ORR; whereas the metal Co nanocrystals are the chief active species for OER. Additionally, the balanced micro/mesopore distribution offers fast mass diffusion, and carbon nanosheet/nanotube architecture supplies favorable 3D electrical conduct. As a result, the as prepared CoNC (1:4) exhibits a positive half-wave potential of 0.87 V (vs RHE) for ORR, and a low potential of 1.55 V (vs RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER. Importantly, the flexible Zn-air battery using the catalyst exhibits a peak power density of 117 mW cm(-2), a higher round-trip efficiency of 68% cycling at 2 mA/cm(-2), and an excellent cycling stability with 3% decrease after 126 cycles test. This work provides a general strategy to design bifunctional catalysts by integrating atomically dispersed and nanoscaled transitional metal species together with N-doped micro-/mesoporous 3D carbon.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000600984100001

Herein, we carefully designed p-p heterojunction precursor Co4-MOF@La(HCO2)(3) with internal electric field through electrostatic adherence, which then in-situ transformed into p-p type heterojunction electrocatalyst (Co(OH)(2))4@La(OH)(3) under KOH activation strategy. The one-step in-situ conversion of (Co(OH)2)4@La(OH)3 generated the interface with significant difference in metal atomic radius and exhibits fascinating nanostructures, which enhances the specific surface area and increases the number of active sites compared with the parent material. Impressively, the obtained material (Co(OH)(2))4@La(OH)(3) demonstrates satisfying electrocatalytic activity in OER with a low overpotential of only 233 mV to reach a current density of 20 mA cm(-2), and excellent stability for 50 h at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline medium. In-situ Raman technique indicates that multivalent Co centers are the true active sites during the OER process. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculation results, La atoms possess empty d orbitals, which are beneficial to facilitate charge transfer from Co to La at the heterojunction interface. Meanwhile, the introduction of La atoms changes the coordinated environment around the adjacent atoms at the interface, which induces the upshift of the d-band center for Co atoms and increases the binding strength of the adsorbed oxygen intermediate.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000863079400002

For a future large-scale application, core-shell nanoparticles are an appealing route to minimize the demand for these precious oxides. Here, we employ first-principles density-functional theory (DFT) and ab initio thermodynamics to assess the feasibility of encapsulating a cheap rutile-structured TiO2 core with coherent, monolayer-thin IrO2 or RuO2 films. Resulting from a strong directional dependence of adhesion and strain, a wetting tendency is only obtained for some low-index facets under typical gas-phase synthesis conditions. Thermodynamic stability in particular of lattice-matched RuO2 films is instead indicated for more oxidizing conditions. Intriguingly, the calculations also predict an enhanced activity and stability of such epitaxial RuO2/TiO2 core-shell particles under OER operation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000782297100001	35293136

The high cost, scarcity and instability of precious-metal-based electrocatalysts for the ORR and OER dramatically hamper their practical application in such clean-energy set-ups. Here, we report highly active Co5.47N-loaded N-doped carbon (CoNMC), prepared via the direct NH3 annealing of a millet-CoCl2 mixture, which is a cheap and mass-producible form of biomass. The optimized product shows superior ORR activity (a half-wave potential of 0.81 V vs. RHE) and electrochemical stability (a 16.5 mV negative shift of the half-wave potential after 2000 cycles) in alkaline media. Also, it shows appealing OER activity (an operating potential at 10 mA cm(-2) of 1.62 V vs. RHE). This excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to the formation of active Co5.47N nanoparticles, the large specific surface area, the abundance of nitrogen active sites, and the high graphitization degree. When assembled into a Zn-air battery, the CoNMC-based cell shows comparable performance to a Pt/C-RuO2 one.									22	1	0	0	4	0	22			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000520487300033	32129400

The structure contains a noninterpenetrated diamondoid Co-O-Co inorganic building block, which introduces unique helices and an extra-large intersecting {Co-36} ring channel. The unique 3D cobalt oxide framework decorated by pi-conjugated t-cinnamate with the electron flexibility near Co centers and permanent pores with catalytic active sites results in good electrocatalytic activity toward the OER conducted in basic electrolytes. The observed overpotential of 361 mV at 10.0 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH and a Tafel slop of 28 mV dec(-1) are better than those of the reference materials.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000645429400010

The results show that MCAR/MDA maintains the Mo-oxo species throughout the process, reducing the maximum C6H6 yield, but extending the reaction life by at least 4 time. As O/CH4 increases, MCAR/MDA changes from oxygen-deficient to oxygen-rich state. For MCAR/MDA under oxygen-deficient condition, O-2 can only delay the accumulation of aromatics. Grown of coke on Bronsted acid eventually leads to complete blockage of the micropores of the catalyst. Slowly deposited graphite coke in MCAR/MDA extended the critical time by nearly 4 times. For MCAR/MDA under oxygen-rich condition, a 70% C6H6 selectivity was maintained throughout the process. After 3700 min of operation, the remaining micropore volume and micropore surface of the deactivated catalyst remained above 1/3. The timely removal of graphite coke at the pore mouth by the MCAR/MDA reaction under oxygen-rich conditions can eliminate the limitation of C6H6 diffusion, thereby effectively preventing the acceleration of the coke deposit micropores which cause the MDA reaction to be rapidly deactivated.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1011-372X	1572-879X		WOS:000515693400001

We demonstrated that the density of oxygen defects could be regulated by different cooling methods and speculated that oxygen vacancy with appropriate concentration range could promote photocatalytic activity through suppressing the recombination of photo-induced carriers. The specific exposed facets with higher oxidation efficiency were prepared by solvothermal reaction. WO3-A treated by air cooling exhibits the best photocatalytic oxygen evolution rate at 500 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) using AgNO3 as sacrifice agent under visible light (lambda > 400 nm) without any co-catalysts, which is about 2 times higher than WO3-N without oxygen defects. This strategy, using different cooling methods to regulate oxygen vacancy concentration on tungsten oxides, could contribute to the design of other high efficiency photocatalysts.									72	3	0	0	9	0	72			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000424694400029	29368784

We describe a very efficient and stable bifunctional electrocatalytic system for reversible oxygen electrodes obtained by direct CVD growth of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) on the surface of cobalt boride (CoB) nanoparticles. A detailed investigation of the crystalline structure and elemental distribution of CoB before and after NCNT growth reveals that the NCNTs grow on small CoB nanoparticles formed in the CVD process. The resultant CoB/NCNT system exhibited outstanding activity in catalyzing both the OER and the ORR in 0.1 M KOH with an overvoltage difference of only 0.73 V between the ORR at -1 mA cm(-2) and the OER at +10 mA cm(-2). The proposed CoB/NCNT catalyst showed stable performance during 50 h of OER stability assessment in 0.1 M KOH. Moreover, CoB/NCNT spray-coated on a gas diffusion layer as an air-breathing electrode proved its high durability during 170 galvanostatic charge-discharge (OER/ORR) test cycles (around 30 h) at +/- 10 mA cm(-2) in 6 M KOH, making it an excellent bifunctional catalyst for potential Zn-air battery application.									49	2	0	0	2	0	50			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000413189100004

The hydrogen evolution reaction (h.e.r.) on the cobalt electrodes was performed in 30 wt % KOH at 25, 40, 50, 60 and 70-degrees-C. Without oxygen bubbling during deposition, the cobalt electrodes prepared from the acetate bath gave superior performance for h.e.r. than electrodes deposited from the other baths.

However, to speed up the electrocatalytic conversion efficiency of their half reactions including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), electrocatalysts are usually essential to reduce their kinetic energy barriers. Electrospun nanomaterials possess a unique one-dimensional structure for outstanding electron and mass transportation, large specific surface area, and the possibilities of flexibility with the porous feature, which are good candidates as efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting. In this review, we focus on the recent research progress on the electrospun nanomaterials-based electrocatalysts for HER, OER, and overall water splitting reaction. Specifically, the insights of the influence of the electronic modulation and interface engineering of these electrocatalysts on their electrocatalytic activities will be deeply discussed and highlighted. Furthermore, the challenges and development opportunities of the electrospun nanomaterials-based electrocatalysts for water splitting are featured. Based on the achievements of the significantly enhanced performance from the electronic modulation and interface engineering of these electrocatalysts, full utilization of these materials for practical energy conversion is anticipated.									48	2	0	0	3	0	48				2637-9368		WOS:000669753200005

Some nickel-based materials are usually used in water-alkaline electrolysis, but their composition and structure are still not optimized. In this work, porous aligned flake arrays of Ni-embedded NiO (Ni/NiO) and single-crystalline NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) are proposed to be HER and OER electrocatalysts to produce H-2 and O-2, respectively. The former catalyst, fabricated by non-contact Al-reduction of nickel hydroxide precursors, showed high HER activity, approaching that of commercial Pt/C. The latter catalyst, prepared by the fluorinion-assisted hydrothermal method, possessed higher activity for the OER than the well-known RuO2. The water-alkaline electrolyser assembled by the arrays of Ni/NiO and NiFe LDH in 1 M NaOH exhibits an ultra-small cell voltage of 1.52 V at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) at room temperature, as well as good long-term stabilities. These high performances of our nickel-based arrays result from their improved charge transfer and mass transport, and faster kinetics of catalytic reactions. So the arrays of Ni/NiO and NiFe LDH are promising in the application of water-splitting devices.									107	8	0	0	2	0	110			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000366825300016

Herein, a robust electrocatalyst of V-CoP2 porous nanowires arranged on a carbon cloth is successfully fabricated by incorporating vanadium into the CoP2 lattice. Structural characterizations and theoretical analysis indicate that lattice expansion of CoP2 caused by V incorporation results in the upshift of the d-band center, which is conducive to hydrogen adsorption for boosting the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Besides, V promotes surface reconstruction to generate a thicker Co3O4 layer with an oxygen vacancy that enhances acid-corrosion resistance and optimizes the adsorption of water and oxygen-containing species, thus improving activity and stability toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Accordingly, it presents a superior acidic overall water splitting activity (1.47 V@10 mA cm(-2)) to Pt-C/CC||RuO2/CC (1.59 V@10 mA cm(-2)), and remarkable stability. This work proposes a new route to design efficient non-noble metal electrocatalysts for PEMWE.									27	0	0	0	2	0	27			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000748281400001	34984764

However, both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) associated with water electrolysis are kinetically sluggish, leading to low efficiency in corresponding electrolysis devices. In addition, current electrocatalysts that can catalyze both HER and OER to practical rates require noble metals such as platinum that are low in abundance and high in price, severely limiting commercialization. As a result, the development of high-performance and cost-effective non-noble metal electrocatalysts to replace noble ones has intensified. Based on this, this review will comprehensively present recent research in the design, synthesis, characterization and performance validation/optimization of non-noble metal HER electrocatalysts and analyze corresponding catalytic mechanisms. Moreover, several important types of non-noble metal electrocatalysts including zero-dimensional, one-dimensional, two-dimensional and three-dimensional materials are presented with an emphasis on morphology/structure, synergetic interaction between metal and support, catalytic property and HER activity/stability. Furthermore, existing technical challenges are summarized and corresponding research directions are proposed toward practical application. Graphic Water electrolysis is a sustainable approach for hydrogen production by using electricity from clean energy sources. However, both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are kinetically sluggish, causing low efficiency of the electrolysis devices. The currently used noble metals, such as Pt-based electrocatalysts for catalyzing both HER and OER to practical rates, have low abundances and high price, limiting their commercialization. In this regard, developing high-performance and cost-effective non-noble metal electrocatalysts to replace noble ones has become a hot research topic.									74	0	0	0	3	0	72			2520-8489	2520-8136		WOS:000623819800001

Herein, we develop the MoS2 nanoflowers with 210-470 nm in diameter constructed by nanosheets using a facile hydrothermal method. The MoS2 nanoflowers obtained expose greater numbers of unsaturated S atoms on the edge sites and exhibit excellent electro-catalytic activities in acidic medium. When serving in hydrogen evolution reaction, MoS2 nanoflowers show enhanced catalytic activity with the onset potential of 117 mV and the required potential of 255 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm(2), which is superior to commercial MoS2 under the same conditions. Meanwhile, the MoS2 nanoflowers also show excellent catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction after 1000 cycles. Moreover, the higher stability without apparent activity loss and long-term durability for 5 h are also observed. Overall, the MoS2 nanoflowers exhibit excellent activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction and are a promising functional catalyst in practical application. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, a series of transition metal oxyphosphides with ultrafine nanosheet structure have been successfully created as high-performance electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Taking advantages of the abundant surface defects, modified electronic effects, as well as the high surface active areas, we herein successfully construct a novel class of highly-efficient electrocatalysts, and the resultant NiZn oxyphosphide nanosheets (NiZnP NSs) can exhibit relatively low overpotentials of 290 and 332 mV to achieve the current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm(-2) for OER, respectively, outperforming most of non noble metal electrocatalysts. More impressively, such NiZnP NSs can also retain high catalytic activity with negligible composition and structure variations after long-term electrochemical test. This work provides prospects to construct highly efficient, earth abundant, and ultra-durable two-dimensional (2D) electrocatalysts for water splitting. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In OER, water is converted to O(2)and H+/e(-)pairs, while in ORR the reverse process happens to form water. Both reactions and their efficiency are important enablers of a hydrogen economy where hydrogen will act as a fuel or energy storage medium. OER and ORR can both be described assuming a four-step electrochemical mechanism with coupled H+/e(-)transfers between four intermediates (M-*,M-OH,M = O,M-OOH,M = active metal site). Previously, it was shown for mixed metal-oxyhydroxides that an unstableM-OOHspecies can equilibrate to anM-OOspecies and a hydrogenated acceptor site (M-OOH/eq), enabling a bifunctional mechanism. Within OER, the presence of Fe within a nickel-oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) acceptor site was found to be beneficial to lower the required overpotential (Vandichel et al. in Chemcatchem 12(5):1436-1442, 2020). In this work, we present the first proof-of-concept study of various possible mechanisms (standard and bifunctional ones) for OER and ORR, i.e. we include now the active edge sites and hydrogen acceptor sites in the same model system. Furthermore, we consider water as solvent to describe the equilibration of theM-OOHspecies toM-OOH/eq, a crucial step that enables a bifunctional route to be operative. Additionally, different single Fe-dopant positions in an exfoliated NiOOH model are considered and four different reaction schemes are studied for OER and the reverse ORR process. The results are relevant in alkaline conditions, where the studied model systems are stable. Certain Fe-dopant positions result in active Ni-edge sites with very low overpotentials provided water is present within the model system.

Herein, a series of bifunctional catalysts is designed that exploit intramolecular reorientation of nitrogen atom within the hollow nanoball from polyacrylonitrile on graphene through thermal treatment to achieve covalent doping. The as synthesized hollow carbon nanoballs on graphene (HCNB@G) catalysts have huge defective edges and microporous channels and contain a high density of electroactive graphitic-N and pyridinic-N as dual-active sites. As a result, the optimized HCNB@G-700 enhances electrocatalytic activities for both oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER) in 1.0 m KOH by generating 217 and 108 mV overpotential to gain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. This remarkable electrocatalytic activity mainly originates from the appropriate combination of suitable nitrogen active sites and edge defects with microchannels that not only facilitate the penetration of electrolyte but also improve the stability of the HCNB@G. In addition, the superior conductivity and high surface area of HCNB@G boost electrocatalytic activity by supporting efficient charge transport and enabling rapid mass diffusion with gas release, respectively.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2196-7350			WOS:000695519500001

The as-prepared hybrid materials demonstrate outstanding catalytic activities as non-noble metal electrodes rendered by the synergistic effect of bimetal elements and N-dopants, the improved electrical conductivity, and hydrophilism. Ni/Mo2C@N-doped porous carbon (NiMo-polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)) and NiFe@N-doped carbon (NiFe-PVP) produce low overpotentials of 130 and 297 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) as catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively. In addition, these binder-free electrodes show long-term stability. Overall water splitting is also demonstrated based on the couple of NiMo-PVP||NiFe-PVP catalyzer. This represents a simple and effective synthesis method toward a new type of nanometal-carbon hybrid electrodes.									130	13	0	0	1	0	131			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000407275300022

Linear sweep voltammetry and chronoamperometry techniques showed that NiA has higher catalytic activity for these two reactions, as evidenced by higher current densities, which can be correlated with a higher weight fraction of Ni in this electrocatalyst than in the NiX and with its higher conductivity. HER and OER kinetic parameters, including Tafel slope, exchange current density and apparent activation energy were evaluated. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis yielded values of the resistance of the solution, charge transfer and mass transfer, as well as double layer capacitance and pseudo-capacitance of the working electrode, at different potentials and temperatures. Unlike the HER, during which the mass transfer resistance of the adsorbed intermediate is dominant in the case of NiA, the OER impedance response is controlled by the charge transfer process itself at the potentials of interest for these process. The overall resistance related to the HER is lower for NiA than for NiX. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Its success requires an intensive improvement in the kinetics of the anodic half- reaction of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which determines the overall system efficiency to a large extent. In this work, we designed a facile and one-route strategy to activate the surface of metallic nickel (Ni) for the OER in alkaline media by ultrasound (24 kHz, 44 W, 60% acoustic amplitude, ultrasonic horn). Sonoactivated Ni showed enhanced OER activity with a much lower potential at + 10 mA cm(-2) of + 1.594 V vs. RHE after 30 min ultrasonic treatment compared to + 1.617 V vs. RHE before ultrasonication. In addition, lower charge transfer resistance of 11.1 omega was observed for sonoactivated Ni as compared to 98.5 omega for non-sonoactivated Ni. In our conditions, ultrasound did not greatly affect the electrochemical surface area (A(ecsa)) and Tafel slopes however, the enhancement of OER activity can be due to the formation of free OH center dot & nbsp; radicals resulting from cavitation bubbles collapsing at the electrode/electrolyte interface.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1350-4177	1873-2828		WOS:000797196200006	35483165

Herein, we designed a new type of electrocatalysts consisting of transition metal halide molecules covered by graphene sheets, which is supported by experiments. To rapidly screen the best catalysts from numerous candidate materials, the electronic structures, reaction free energies and overpotentials of those graphene-covered halide catalysts were studied by the first-principles calculations to predict the catalytic activities for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). An intrinsic descriptor, the electrostatic force induced by the metallic ions, was found to well describe the catalytic activities and provide a better understanding of the local electrical field effects on catalytic activities. The spin-down d-band center was also introduced to describe catalytic activities of the catalysts. The results demonstrate that the graphene-covered CrBr2 shows the best bifunctional catalytic activities for fuel cells while graphene-covered CoF2 could well facilitate H2O2 production. These catalysts are better than the best commercial noble metal catalysts (e.g., Pt and RuO2) in terms of overpotentials and activities. This work provides a theoretical base for rationally designing durable electrocatalysts with excellent catalytic activities.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000492992600040	31603158

Molybdenum carbide materials have recently emerged as a type of promising catalysts for electrocatalytic reactions due to the earth-abundance and Pt-resembled electrical properties. In this work, taking the advantage of the interaction between the basic groups of the Mo(VI)-melamine polymer and the acidic groups on the surface of the oxidized carbon nanotubes (CNTs), N-doped CNTs supported Mo2C nanoparticles (Mo2C/NCNT) are prepared, which exhibit outstanding electrocatalytic activity and durability for both the hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions. The impressive performance of Mo2C/NCNT can be attributed to the small size of Mo2C particles, the large exposure ratio of surface sites and the presence of N-doped CNTs. This work enlarges the multi-field applications of molybdenum carbide-base materials as promising non-precious metal electrocatalysts, which is of great significance for sustainable energy-related technologies.

Recently, we have shown that the degradation of these catalysts represents a serious challenge. In this work we explore the degradation mechanisms further by considering different catalysts and experimental conditions. For this, Pt/IrOx with varying Pt to Ir ratios are synthesized and their performances are evaluated. It is found that catalysts with higher Pt and Ir contents have higher oxygen reduction (ORR) and evolution reaction (OER) activities, respectively. The materials stability is investigated under a potential pulses protocol. Using on-line dissolution analysis, it is found that, besides the transient Pt dissolution identified in the previous works, continuous dissolution of Ir during the OER must be considered. The latter is assigned to a continuous formation of common OER and Ir dissolution intermediates. Further, identical location microscopy is employed to reveal the changes in the catalyst layer structure and morphology. It is shown that dissolution triggers significant particles agglomeration/coalescence, which are the main causes for the catalysts degradation. These processes must be attenuated for a feasible long-term application of Pt/IrOx materials as bifunctional oxygen catalyst. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The X-ray diffraction pattern of the as-synthesized powders exhibited a majority phase identical to that of La0.6Ca0.4CoO3, indicating successful incorporation of Ir4(+) at the Co cation sites. Scanning Electron Microscope images demonstrated a foam-like microstructure with a surface area of 13.31 m(2) g(-1). For electrochemical characterization, the La0.6Ca0.4CO0.8Ir0.2O3 particles were supported on carbon nanocapsules (CNCs) and deposited on commercially available gas diffusion electrodes with a loading of 2.4 mg cm(-2). In current- potential polarizations, La0.6Ca0.4Co0.8Ir0.2O3/CNCs revealed more enhanced bifunctional catalytic abilities than La0.6Ca0.4CoO3/CNCs. Similar behaviors were observed in galvanostatic profiles for oxygen reduction and evolution at current densities of 50 and 100mAcm(-2) for 10 min.

In this work, Co9S8-Ni3S2 heterointerfaced nanotubes on Ni foam (Co9S8-Ni3S2 HNTs/Ni) have been successfully developed via a two-step hydrothermal method as a highly efficient, robust and flexible bifunctional electrodes for water splitting. Co9S8-Ni3S2 HNTs are composed of inner 1D Co9S8 nanotubes surrounded by outer 2D Ni3S2 nanosheets. Co9S8-Ni3S2 HNTs/Ni electrode achieves 10mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 85 mV for H-2 evolution reaction (HER) and 50 mA cm(-2) at overpotential of 281 mV for O-2 evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M KOH solution, substantially better than that on single-phased Co9S8 nanotubes and Ni3S2 nanosheets on Ni foam. The reason is most likely due to formation of defect-rich heterointerfaces between Co9S8 nanotubes and Ni3S2 nanosheets, and the significant change of binding energies of Co 2p and Ni 2p level between the Co9S8 and Ni3S2, leading to the synergistic effect on the enhanced catalytic activity for HER and OER. The robust and flexibility of Co9S8-Ni3S2 HNTs/Ni electrodes are demonstrated in an alkaline electrolyzer, delivering 10 mA cm(-2) electrolysis current at a cell voltage of 1.59 V, one of the best bifunctional electrodes for water splitting. Owing to the fact that reaction occurs at the defects-rich heterointerfaces, the Co9S8-Ni3S2 HNTs/ Ni electrodes are structurally very stable. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we present a small molecular amine mediated one-step approach to directly synthesize thin cobalt sulfide nanosheets by employing sulfur powder and CoCl2 as the reaction precursor. The surface chemical environment including cobalt oxidation state of the obtained cobalt sulfide materials can be in situ finely tuned by sulfur dosage. The as-prepared and optimized cobalt sulfide nanosheets with thickness of 5-12 nm have a favorable surface chemical environment including amounts of highly active Co(III) species, easy transform of Co(II) to Co(III), richness of defects, and higher electrochemical surface area, which induce enhanced catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. When used as an electrocatalyst, the optimized cobalt sulfide catalyst offers an overpotential of 312 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and mass loading of 0.37-0.45 mg cm(-2), which can remain constant for at least 36 h of OER operation in 1 M KOH electrolyte. This electrocatalytic activity is better than most of reported monometallic cobalt sulfide materials and commercial RuO2.									26	3	0	0	1	0	26			2574-0962			WOS:000473116600058

Herein, we show that highly active earth-abundant metal oxide oxygen and hydrogen evolution electrocatalysts can be synthesised using the Adams method, in which the metal salts are oxidised in a melt of sodium nitrate. We also demonstrate that such oxides are usually highly crystalline powders with high specific surface areas. Disc electrodes of the Adams method metal oxides, specifically RuO2, Mn2O3, Co3O4 and NiO, are prepared using a recently reported mechanical, solvent-free method, involving pressing a mixture of the metal oxide and a small amount (5wt%) of PTFE powder. Each electrode is tested as an electrode for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1m NaOH. In the former role, Mn2O3 appears better than a platinum wire electrode (overpotential at 10mAcm(-2), (10)=61mV compared to 70mV for Pt). In the OER study, although RuO2 is the best electrocatalyst (with (10)=267mV), Co3O4 is also very effective (with (10)=330mV). Using Mn2O3 as the cathode and Co3O4 as the anode, a silicon solar cell is used to photocleave water into H-2 and O-2.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2367-0932			WOS:000427241600020

XRDresults show that NiSe phaseonNFand NiSe2 phase on NF (Ox) have been obtained after the identical selenization process, respectively. The nanorods morphology of NiSe on NF and pyramid structure of NiSe2 on NF (Ox) have been revealed by SEM images. The different structure and morphology of NiSe/NF compared with NiSe2/NF (Ox) can be ascribed to the oxidation pretreatment of NF which affiliates the formation of ultrathin beta-Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets on NF. The electrochemical measurements for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) exhibit an enhanced electrocatalytic activity of NiSe2/NF (Ox) with onset potential of 1.54 V (vs. RHE) and small Tafel slope of 96 mV dec(-1). Moreover, NiSe2/NF (Ox) possesses lower charge-transfer resistance (R-ct) indicating a faster electron transfer rate than NiSe/NF. The excellent stability further confirms the improved elctrocatalytic performance of NiSe2/NF (Ox). We speculate that the high Ni2+ proportion and octahedral structure of NiSe2 may be the keys for excellent electrocatalytic properties for OER. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In nature, organisms utilize tyrosinase to catalyse oxidation reactions of tyrosine to produce multifunctional compounds in different pathways. However, it remains a great challenge to manipulate the pathway selection of tyrosinase-guided chemical evolution for achieving biomaterials with on-demand functions. We herein report that controlling oxygen concentration is effective in regulating the evolution of tyrosinase-catalysed oxygenation pathways of tyrosine-containing peptides and even proteins. The melanin formation pathway predominates under oxygen-enriched conditions, while fluorescent compounds are preferentially generated under hypoxic conditions. The chemical evolution of tyrosine-containing peptides, regardless of their neighbouring amino acid types and sequences, tends to be governed by these two competitive pathways. These competitive pathways are manipulated by conformational transformation of tyrosinase active centre that is determined by oxygen concentration. Moreover, the oxygen-controlled chemical evolution of tyrosine-containing biomolecules can be broadly realized by tyrosinase to obtain melanin-based photothermal materials or multicolour fluorescent materials. This work reveals the plausible role of oxygen in the pathway selectivity of enzyme-controlled chemical evolution of tyrosine-containing peptides and verifies the possibility of fluorescent detection in living cultured melanoma cells, which provides a versatile strategy for precise design and engineering of tyrosine-involved multifunctional biomaterials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000875249700005

Herein, a nitrogen-doped nanonetwork assembled by porous and defective NiCo2O4@C nanowires grown on nickel foam (N-NiCo2O4@C@NF) is crafted via biomimetic mineralization and following carbonization of phase-transited lysozyme (PTL)-coupled NiCo2O4. The as-obtained N-NiCo2O4@C@NF electrocatalysts exhibit an exceptional catalytic activity with ultralow overpotentials for the HER (42 mV) and OER (242 mV) to afford 10 mA cm(-2) while maintaining good stability in alkaline media. Meanwhile, the N-NiCo2O4@C electrocatalysts presents a superior catalytic activity for ORR and a favorable four-electron pathway. The unprecedented catalytic performance arises from a highly porous structure and abundant defects and synergistic effects of components. This work may offer a new possibility in the exploration of multifunctional electrocatalysts for various energy-related electrocatalytic reactions.									52	4	0	0	1	0	54			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000502689000017	31724846

Iron nitrides exhibit mediocre oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to their unsuitable d-band energy level. In this work, we strongly boost the HER and OER catalytic performance of Fe2N for the first time by doping Co and Al, which could not only induce the formation of Fe2N/Fe3N hybrid interface but also tune the d-band center position. The CoAl-Fe2N/Fe3N nanoparticles display HER and OER overpotential of 145 and 307 mV at 10 mA/cm(2). XPS and DFT calculations confirm that tailoring the d-band center position and interfacial engineering facilitates strong electronic interactions between Fe2N and Fe3N, synergistically optimize the electronic structure, which enriches H and H2O adsorption energy and oxygen-containing intermediates. An alkaline electrolyzer based on CoAl-Fe2N/Fe3N requires an overall potential of 1.67 V at 10 mA/cm(2), demonstrating the use of iron nitrides as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting activity.									62	6	0	0	5	0	63			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000483567800001

The electrochemical pre-activation process facilitates the growth of an amorphous Ni(OH)(2) layer on the surface of NiSe-NixSy hybrid nanorods, and Ni(OH)(2) can be easily transferred into NiOOH in alkaline solution as actually active sites for OER. The chemical composition, oxidation state, hybrid structure and surface morphology of NiSe/NF, NiSe-NixSy/NF and activated NiSe-NixSy/NF have been characterized and confirmed by XRD, XPS, SEM, EDX and EDX mapping. Electrochemical measurements have revealed enhanced OER performances of activated NiSe-NixSy/NF including smaller overpotential, Tafel plot and charge-transfer resistance than NiSe/NF and NiSe-NixSy/NF. The superior OER performances of activated NiSe-NixSy electrocatalysts may be not only due to the hybrid nanorods but also ascribed to Ni(OH)(2) layer on the nanorods derived from electrochemical pre-activation process. Therefore, the method of combining an electrochemical pre-activation process with novel hybrid nanostructures may be a feasible strategy for preparing excellent OER eletrocatalysts.

Catalytic activity enhancement was demonstrated through the formation of CoS2 nanoparticles with mono-phase and extremely porous structures. To fabricate porous structures at the nanometer scale, Co-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), namely a cobalt Prussian blue analogue (Co-PBA, Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)), was used as a porous template for the CoS2. Then, controlled sulfurization annealing converted the Co-PBA to mono-phase CoS2 nanoparticles with similar to 4 nm pores, resulting in a large surface area of 915.6 m(2) g(-1). The electrocatalysts had high activity for overall water splitting, and the overpotentials of the oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction under the operating conditions were 298 mV and -196 mV, respectively, at 10 mA cm(-2).									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2045-2322			WOS:000508870500014	31862953

The NiO/TiO2-OV catalyst exhibited a substantially improved performance in the photodegradation of organic pollutant and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The sensitization by narrow bandgap semiconductor of NiO enhanced the light response of catalysts. More importantly, the intrinsic defects, the Ti3+ and oxygen vacancies, acted as the mid-gap state in TiO2, and resulted in the direct Z-scheme charge transfer between the Ti3+/oxygen vacancies state and the valance band (VB) of NiO to suppress the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. Meanwhile, the realignment of band structure caused by constructing NiO/TiO2 heterojunction made the photogenerated carries more active in the photocatalytic reduction and oxidation reactions.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000475744800032

Herein, a hybrid morphological-modulation strategy is investigated, which integrates etching treatment with surface strain engineering and can be used as a facile and scalable approach to fabricate efficient FeNi-based amorphous electrocatalysts for alkaline water splitting. In comparison with the as-spun sample, the etched amorphous FeNiCoMoP sample displays superior electrocatalytic performance toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Further, the electrocatalytic activity of this etched material is significantly improved through the pretreatment of surface strain engineering, which is mainly ascribed to the harmonized electron-modulation of multi-metal amorphous alloys and enhancement in surface areas caused by unique micro-holes architecture as well as the strain-induced positive shift of binding energy. The hybrid morphological-modulated sample (namely, FNCMP-S-20) exhibits advanced alkaline HER and OER performance as evidenced by low overpotentials of 146 mV and 205 mV, respectively, to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, a two-electrode electrolyzer constructed by FNCMP-S-20 is shown a remarkably low cell voltage of 1.59 V along with excellent stability of 12 h operating at 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting performances.

Here, a simple convertible electrolyzer in membraneless and membrane-based modes is proposed. For the first time, this enables comprehensive investigations of water splitting with pure water, acidic and alkaline electrolytes in one cell. With the simple electrolyzer and high-speed visualization system, the influences of flow rate, electrolytes, concentration, and Nafion membrane on the oxygen evolution reactions (OERs), hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) and electrolyzer performance are comprehensively investigated. Visualization results reveal that water splitting only occurred at the edge between the electrode and the Nafion membrane in pure water. However, they occurred on the whole electrode surface in alkaline and acidic electrolytes, indicating easily tunable reaction sites with the convertible electrolyzer. This demonstrates the feasibility of using the simple convertible electrolyzer for understanding the water splitting mechanism. The relation between electrolyte thickness and resistances with different electrolytes is also quantified. This work provides an insight for optimizing electrochemical devices while delivering an inexpensive and fast way for electrode evaluations and electrochemical reaction studies.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000609161300007

JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS				11	10			3754	3760		10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c00778				MAY 21 2020	2020	We demonstrate that key parameters for efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of water are the energetics of the redox complexes associated with their ionization and electrochemical potentials coupled to the change of metal-oxygen band hybridization. We investigate the catalytic activity of the LiCoPO4-LiCo2P3O10 tailored compound, which is a 5 V cathode material for Li-ion batteries. The reason for the weak catalytic activity of the lithiated compound toward the oxygen evolution reaction is a large energy difference between the electronic states involved in the electrochemical reaction. A highly active catalyst is obtained by tuning the relative energetic position of the electronic levels involved in the charge transfer reaction, which in turn are governed by the lithium content. A significant lowering of the overpotential from >550 mV to similar to 370 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) is achieved via a decrease of the ionization potential and shifting the electrochemical potential near the electronic states of the molecule, thereby facilitating water oxidation.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1948-7185			WOS:000537432500001	32301321

Herein, we demonstrate such remarkable bifunctional catalysts for both ORR and OER with tunable dimensional and structural properties. Three-dimensional (3D) interconnected frameworks comprising Co and N dual-doped carbon nanosheets (CNSs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were fabricated, delivering a half-wave potential of 0.812 V (vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) for ORR in alkaline media, only a little bit lower than that of the state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C (0.856 V vs. RHE). Such catalyst also displayed an OER potential of 1.582 V (vs. RHE) with an overpotential of 0.80 V between ORR and OER at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), significantly lower than that of Pt/C. We found that Co and N species synergistically played a crucial role in tuning the electrocatalytic performance. This 3D framework provided a promising bifunctional catalyst alternative for both ORR and OER. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The experimental approach integrated a handful of surface-sensitive physical-analytical methods with traditional electrochemical techniques, all harbored in a single environment-controlled electrochemistry-surface science apparatus (EC-SSA); the catalyst samples were typically precious noble metals constituted of well-defined single-crystal surfaces. More recently, attention has been diverted from fuel-to-energy generation to its converse, (solar) energy-to-fuel transformation; e.g., instead of water synthesis (from hydrogen and oxygen) in fuel cells, water decomposition (to hydrogen and oxygen) in artificial photosynthesis. The rigorous surface-science protocols remain unchanged but the experimental capabilities have been expanded by the addition of several characterization techniques, either as EC-SSA components or as stand-alone instruments. The present manuscript describes results selected from on-going studies of earth-abundant electrocatalysts for the reactions that underpin artificial photosynthesis: nickel-molybdenum alloys for the hydrogen evolution reaction, calcium birnessite as a heterogeneous analogue for the oxygen-evolving complex in natural photosynthesis, and single-crystalline copper in relation to the carbon dioxide reduction reaction.

The oxidation mechanism of PCs was investigated under typical CFB roasting conditions with the temperature of 850 degrees C and oxygen concentration of 1-21% on a drop tube furnace. The oxidation reaction pathway and products of PCs are strongly coupled with particle morphology evolution, which affects the oxygen diffusion from the particle surface to the core. A reaction path model of PC oxidation coupled with particle morphology evolution under CFB roasting conditions was proposed. The initial relatively slow oxidation of the porous particle structure followed by the relatively fast oxidation for complete oxidation was demonstrated to be the ideal reaction path for the CFB roasting operation of PCs. The critical issue for PCs roasting in the CFB reactor is to inhibit the particle temperature rise in dense phase region to avoid the formation of compact solid spheres. The flow and reaction behaviors of PC particles in CFB reactor naturally follow the ideal reaction path and make the CFB roasting technology feasible. Finally, the design principles of PCs CFB roasting process were suggested.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0255-2701	1873-3204		WOS:000551293100002

We apply the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) to separate the OER current from the carbon corrosion current. We then use transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to visualize changes in the carbon morphology resulting from corrosion.

In this work, a Co3O4 with abundant oxygen vacancy is synthesized via aldehyde reduction. After the procedure, the reduced Co3O4 exhibits larger electrochemical active surface areas and better electrical conductivity. These outstanding characteristics can improve its performance of catalytic and energy storage. As for catalyst of oxygen evolution reaction, the reduced Co3O4 delivers a smaller potential of 1.55 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode to realize a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a lower Tafel slope of 71 mV dec(-1) in alkaline solution, and these values are smaller than those of pristine Co3O4. Especially the reduced Co3O4 possesses superior stability: the measurements of the polarization curves before and after 15h of stability tests basically coincide. In a supercapacitor, the positive electrode of reduced Co3O4 achieves about 1.7 times areal capacitance of pristine Co3O4 at current density of 1 mA cm(-2). Significantly, the superior cycling stability is still retained. Also, an aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled to evaluate the energy storage performance of the R-Co3O4. Moreover, the oxygen vacancy formation strategy for Co3O4 may be generally extended to other metal oxides for application in energy storage and conversion.									27	0	0	0	1	0	27			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000475777300002	31212267

Here, the authors study the oxygen evolution activity on Pt(111) during potential cycling and find that the current density reaches a maximum in the third cycle and is nine times higher than that in the initial cycle, owing to a roughened Pt(111) surface and formation of islands and atomic vacancies in the second subsurface Pt layer.Highly active electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are essential to improve the efficiency of water electrolysis. The properties of OER active sites on single-crystal Pt electrodes were examined herein. The OER is markedly enhanced by repeated oxidative and reductive potential cycles on the Pt(111) surface. The OER activity on Pt(111) is nine times higher in the third cycle than that before the potential cycles. OER activation by potential cycling depends on the (111) terrace width, with wider (111) terraces significantly enhancing the OER. The oxidation/reduction of the Pt(111) surface produces atomic-sized vacancies on the terraces that activate the OER. Structural analysis using X-ray diffraction reveals that the active sites formed by potential cycling are defects in the second subsurface Pt layer. Potential cycling induces the bowl-shaped roughening of the electrode surface, wherein high-coordination number Pt atoms at the bottom of the cavities activate the OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2399-3669			WOS:000867656000001

Herein, we report the synthesis of two-dimensional Co(OH)(2) nanosheets with different thicknesses and explore the thickness effect of the nanosheets on oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It is demonstrated that the OER performances can be greatly enhanced with the decrease of Co(OH)(2) nanosheets' thickness, which would relate to the increasing active sites for reaction due to the ultrathin nature of the nanosheets. The ultrathin Co(OH)(2) nanosheets with a thickness of about 4.0 nm exhibit excellent OER performances with a low onset potential, a low overpotential of 327 mV and a small Tafel slope of 78 mV per decade in alkaline media, which are even better than those of commercial IrO2.

Decorating NiFe catalysts with other transition metals offers a new path to boost their catalytic activities but often suffers from the low controllability of the electronic structures of the NiFe catalytic centers. Here, we report an interfacial atom-substitution strategy to synthesize an electrocatalytic oxygen-evolving NiFeV nanofiber to boost the activity of NiFe centers. The electronic structure analyses suggest that the NiFeV nanofiber exhibits abundant high-valence Fe via a charge transfer from Fe to V. The NiFeV nanofiber supported on a carbon cloth shows a low overpotential of 181 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), along with long-term stability (>20 h) at 100 mA cm(-2). The reported substitutional growth strategy offers an effective and new pathway for the design of efficient and durable non-noble metal-based OER catalysts.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000748150500001	34936185

Herein, a bifunctional electrocatalyst constituted by FexNiy and CeO2 nanoparticles supported on the N-doped nanocarbon (NC) is fabricated by a simple one-pot pyrolysis of the homogeneous mixture of Fe, Ni, Ce nitrates and melamine. The synergistic effect of each component in the FexNiy/CeO2/NC gives rise to outstanding electrocatalytic activities and stability toward the HER and OER. For hydrogen evolution, the FexNiy/CeO2/NC shows a smaller overpotential of 260 mV to achieve a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) in a 1 M KOH electrolyte. More significantly, a small overpotential of 240 mV for FexNiy/CeO2/NC affords an oxygen evolution current density of 10 mA cm(-2), far lower than that of the benchmark IrO2. The practicability and electrocatalytic activity of the prepared FexNiy/CeO2/NC under practical operation conditions are also investigated. In particular, the FexNiy/CeO2/NC-based overall water splitting cell only needs a cell voltage of 1.70 V to output 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline electrolytes, comparable to that of the IrO2 parallel to Pt/C cell. The present study may pioneer a new avenue for developing novel bifunctional electrocatalysts with high-performance and low cost for water splitting.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2052-1553			WOS:000509528500016

Since the electrochemical reactions are mediated by RMs, the power capability of the system would be critically dependent on the intrinsic kinetic properties of the RM in mediating the reaction. Herein, we performed a comparative kinetic study on several reported RMs of the oxygen evolution reaction by probing the RM-assisted charging process with respect to the rate of chemical decomposition of the discharge products and the diffusivity of the RMs in controlled lithium-oxygen cells. It was found that the overall kinetics of RMs had a positive correlation with the redox potential of the RM, and multi-redox RMs could display distinct properties depending on the oxidation states. Among the investigated RMs, DMPZ(2+) (5,10-dihydro-5,10-dimethylphenazine) exhibited highest reaction rate for lithium peroxide decomposition, whereas TEMPO+ (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy) showed highest mass diffusion rate. In addition, the choice of electrolytes is shown to significantly affect the rate capability of the RM-assisted charging and thus must be carefully considered. This study suggests the importance of understanding the kinetics of RMs and provides guidelines for achieving an optimized RM/electrolyte combination to realize high-power lithium-oxygen batteries.									21	1	0	0	0	0	21			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463970400061

The objective is to accelerate the sluggish kinetics of both oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction by facilitating electronic/ionic transport and improving oxygen diffusion in a porous structure. In this study, high-surface-area and porous cobalt phosphide (Co2P) nanosheets are synthesized via an environmentally safe hydrothermal method, where red phosphorous is used as the phosphorous source. It was found that the as-prepared Co2P/acetylene black (AB) composite delivered enhanced electrochemical performances, such as high capacities of 2551 mA h g(-1) (based on the total weight of Co2P and AB) or 5102 mA h g(-1) (based on the weight of Co2P or AB) and a good cycle life of more than 1800 h (132 cycles) in lithium-oxygen battery. The rational design of the Co2P/AB porous oxygen electrode structure provides sufficient accessible reaction sites and a short diffusion path for electrolyte penetration and diffusion of O-2.									38	4	0	0	0	0	40			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000437811400027	29874026

To effectively suppress the competitive OER and improve gaseous ozone escaping, here we present a capillary effect-enabled electrolysis strategy by employing an unusual partial-submersed mode of anode composed of a beta-PbO2 cuboids-loaded bulk porous Pb, and realize a much enhanced electrocatalytic gaseous ozone production in comparison to the cases of solid Pb counterpart and/or usual submersion operation. Detailed study reveals a capillary pressure-induced "molecular oxygen-locking effect" in the electrolyte fully filled in the porous structure of the electrode area above the electrolyte pool level, which unexpectedly leads to the production of unusual center dot O-3(-) intermediate. Distinctive from the traditional electrochemical ozone production (EOP) mechanism dependent on the essential reaction between the atomic oxygen and molecular oxygen, the center dot O-3(-) intermediate generation favors the EOP process in the special case where the capillary action is relevant for a porous bulk anode.									28	1	0	0	4	0	28			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000416496400034	29096439

A key challenge to improve the efficiency of water electrolysis systems is to develop efficient and robust electrocatalysts for water splitting. We propose a simple strategy to construct a nanostructure composed of zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)-67 grafted onto vanadium-doped nickel hydroxide (Ni-V) microflowers (MFs). In this integrated structure, the ZIF-67 polyhedrons were well assembled on the surface of the Ni-V MFs (ie, Z-67/Ni-V), thus enhancing the OER kinetics as a result of the interaction between Ni-V and Co and increasing the electrocatalytic activity. In addition, the Z-67/Ni-V nanostructure is an efficient catalyst that exhibits improved surface area and pore volume. The Z-67/Ni-V nanostructures demonstrated greater OER electrocatalytic activity for alkaline water electrolysis and improved structural stability. Compared to their bare Ni-V-hydroxide counterparts, the Z-67/Ni-V nanostructure reveals an exceptionally low overpotential of 320 mV with a low Tafel slope of 71 mV dec(-1) and remarkable long-standing stability at current density of 10 mA cm(-2).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000787085800001

Increasing the number of iron active sites at the solid-liquid interface is beneficial to enhancing the OER performance of catalysts but still challenging. Here, by systematic exploring the activity trends of M(OH)(x) and Cu-M(OH)(x) (M = Mn, Cu, Ni, Fe, and Co), we discover that the Cu doping can promote the deposition of Fe active sites on metal hydroxide and Cu-Co(OH)(2) shows the most favorable iron adsorption capacity. When loaded on a conductive substrate (cobalt foam (CF), the M-Cu-Co(OH)(2)/CF (Co(OH)(2) prepared by molten salt method) exhibits an attractive low overpotential of 337 mV at 1,000 mA.cm(-2). Using in anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyzer, the single cell with M-Cu-Co (OH)(2)/CF as anode catalyst performs a stable cell voltage of 2.02 V to reach 1,000 mA.cm(-2) over 24 h, indicating a great application potential for actual electrolytic water. Therefore, the promoted adsorption of copper on iron provides a new perspective for further enhancing the OER activity of other metal hydroxides.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000871179100004

Electrocatalysts with superior activity and stability are still highly desired. Herein, a stepwise electrochemical strategy is developed to prepare Co(OH)(2)/NiPx nanosheet arrays with intimate and abundant heterostructures. The Co(OH)(2) nanosheets, which are first electrodeposited on a blank carbon cloth electrode, serve as the substrate for the nucleation and growth of NiPx. The resultant heterointerfaces are well regulated by altering the loading of NiPx. The heterostructured Co(OH)(2)/NiPx with optimal NiPx loading demonstrate significantly enhanced conductivity and hydrophilicity, which greatly facilitate electron and mass transfer. In addition, strong electronic interaction between Co(OH)(2) and NiPx is observed, favoring the generation of high-valence cobalt center, thus the electrocatalytic performances toward OER are remarkably improved. The heterostructured Co(OH)(2)/NiPx nanosheets achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 236 mV, while the corresponding values for Co(OH)(2) and the benchmark Ir/C are 292 and 262 mV, respectively. This study provides a facile and effective strategy to fabricate transition metal hydroxide/phosphide composite nanomaterials with intimate heterostructures, enhanced conductivity, and improved wettability, which opens a new direction for the design of highly active electrocatalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000828900900001

Diamond layers were deposited on Ti stretch metal substrates by the hot-filament method, by which a double side diamond deposition was possible. Triethylboron was used as a boron source. The influence of different deposition parameters on nucleation, growth and quality of the deposited boron doped diamond layers and their adhesion on the substrates were investigated. To examine the electrochemical properties of the different layers cyclic voltammetry measurements were carried out in 0.1 N H2SO4 and 6 N NaOH. From these measurements the electrochemical operating window, which is characterized by the starting oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction, can be determined.

Herein, self-activated anodic nanoporous stainless steel is demonstrated as a highly efficient and durable electrode with improved catalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Etched and anodized stainless steel (EASS) is prepared by anodization using etched stainless steel 304 foil with a rough surface, followed by thermal annealing. Due to its extremely high surface area, evolved oxygen vacancies, and excellent durability for 100 h at 100 mA cm(-2), EASS that has been annealed in an Ar/H-2 atmosphere (EASS-Ar/H-2) exhibits an overpotential of 370 mV, lower than that of pristine etched stainless steel electrode (466 mV) in 1 M KOH aqueous solution. In contrast, EASS annealed in air (EASS-air) displays no catalytic activity. Interestingly, the overpotential of EASS-Ar/H-2 is further reduced to 244 mV after 10,0 0 0 cycles of linear sweep voltammetry by self-activation due to the generation of Ni-rich hydroxide with increasing oxygen vacancies.

The catalyst showed a low overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and remarkable mass activity of about 13.8 times higher than that of the current state-of-the-art commercial Ir/C catalyst.

Design of composite catalysts with synergy between active and stable components proves to be a promising approach. Herein, Ndoped carbon armored Co3O4 hollow nanocubes electrochemically anchored on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates are developed as efficient and stable catalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reactions. Co3O4 acts as the active component with N-doped carbon coating layer serving as the stable protection component, shielding Co3O4 from direct attack of anodic dissolution. Electrochemical fixation offers firm holding of the composite catalyst onto acid-tolerant FTO substrates and hollow nanocubes serve as nanoreactors for confined fast reactions. Under optimal conditions, the composite catalyst achieves an overpotential of 465 mV at 10 mA cm (2) in 0.5 M H2SO4, and stays stable for 12 hr with a 10% increment in applied potentials.

Here, we accelerate the sluggish OER kinetics by controlling the morphology and engineering electronic structure of FexNi1-xSe2 catalysts. FexNi1-xSe2 nanotubes with tunable stoichiometry were fabricated through the removal of sacrificial templates (Cu2O nanowires) and subsequent low-temperature selenization process. By precise tuning of Fe doping amount in FexNi1-xSe2 nanotubes, the optimized Fe0.125Ni0.875Se2 nanotubes show a low overpotential of 253 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1), and superior durability. By combining analysis of the experimental results with density-functional-theory (DFT) simulations, we reveal that the in-situ formed amorphous hydroxyl group layers on the surface of Fe0.125Ni0.875Se2 (Fe0.125Ni0.875Se2-OH) enable highly efficient oxygen evolution catalysis. The Fe dopant can achieve a near-optimal adsorption energy for OER intermediates (OH*, O*, and OOH*) on the oxidized surface of Fe0.125Ni0.875Se2-OH, which is responsible to the enhanced OER performance of Fe0.125Ni0.875Se2.

However, it has become a bottleneck in the development of sustainable energy conversion systems because of its slow kinetics, especially in the common electrolytic water reaction. At present, although there are a lot of researches on OER's catalysts, it is still a great challenge. In this work, a new type of composite was prepared by simple co-precipitation method and Hydrothermal, which is composed of Ce-doped NiFe Layered Double Hydroxide (LDH) and MoSe2. The electrochemical test results of OER show that the overpotential of 6.7%Ce-NiFe LDH@MoSe2 is 221 mV at 10 mA/cm(2), which is better than that of NiFe LDH (409 mV). And it is better than most of the reported OER catalysts in literature, including precious metal catalysts. Simultaneously, 6.7%Ce-NiFe LDH@MoSe2 also has smaller Tafel slope (35.8mV/dec), larger ESCA (6689 cm(2)), long-time stability and selectivity with 92.1% Faraday efficiency. The excellent OER performance of 6.7%Ce-NiFe LDH@MoSe2 benefits from the increase of active and defective sites and the interface coordination between MoSe2 and Ce-NiFe LDH.

The crystalline framework is formed by the assembly of metal ions and polyphenol followed by oxidative self-polymerization of the organic ligands (polyphenol) during hydrothermal treatment in alkaline condition.

The metal (Co or Fe)-natural abundant polyphenol (tannin) coordination crystals are a renewable source for the fabrication of metal/carbon composites as a nonprecious-metal catalyst, which show high catalytic performance for both oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. Such excellent performance makes metal-polyphenol coordination crystals an efficient precursor to fabricate low-cost catalysts for the large-scale application of fuel cells and metal-air batteries.									143	5	0	0	9	0	144			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000387119000001	27581166

However, in dilute chloride solutions, DSAs preferentially produce oxygen rather than chlorine because of their low overpotential for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Considering the frequent use of electrochlorination in dilute conditions, the poor efficiency of DSAs severely limits their environmental and industrial applications. Therefore, the aim of this study is to improve the CER efficiency of IrO2 in dilute chloride solutions with the addition of Fe2O3 as a co-catalyst which has a slow reaction rate of OER. In a dilute chloride solution of 1 mM NaCl, Ir-0.11Fe0.25O0.64 showed a far higher current efficiency for CER (28%) than that of IrO2 (3%). Ir0.11Fe0.25O0.64 also exhibited better current efficiency in NaCl solution of various concentrations (1 mM to 2 M) than that of IrO2. This is attributed to the synergistic effect of Fe2O3 (slow OER rate) and IrO2 (fast CER rate). Moreover, the long-term stability of Ir0.11Fe0.25O0.64 was demonstrated with tap water electrolysis for 50 days. These results suggest that Ir0.11Fe0.25O0.64 has great potential to expand the scope of application of the electrochlorination system, particularly in dilute solutions.

Doping Co3O4 with other transition metals, such as Ni, Cu, and Mn, resulted in a fascinating morphological transformation from quasi-spherical nanoparticles to hierarchical micro/nanostructures. Hollow urchin-like NiCo2O4 exhibited a high specific surface area which led to excellent electrochemical performance towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It achieved a low overpotential of about 309 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) current density, which is comparable to other reported electrocatalysts. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique revealed the redox processes that occur on the surface of NiCo2O4 and supported that Co4+ could be the active center during electrocatalysis. In general, the excellent electrocatalytic activity, stability, and reversibility of NiCo2O4 in alkaline condition suggest its applicability as an OER electrocatalyst.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000519504300001

Herein, a trifunctional electrocatalyst composed of FePx nanoparticles and Fe-N-C moiety supported on the N-, P-codoped carbon (NPC) is masterly synthesized by a facile one-pot pyrolysis of the mixture of tannic acid, ferrous chloride, and sodium hydrogen phosphate. The synergy of each component in the FePx/Fe-N-C/NPC catalyst renders high catalytic activities and excellent durability toward both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The electrocatalytic performance and practicability of the robust FePx/Fe-N-C/NPC catalyst are further investigated under the practical operation conditions. Particularly, the overall water splitting cell assembled by the FePx/Fe-N-C/NPC catalyst only requires a voltage of 1.58 V to output the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to that of IrO2-Pt/C-based cell. Moreover, the FePx/Fe-N-C/NPC-based zinc-air batteries deliver high round-trip efficiency and remarkable cycling stability, much better than that of Pt/C-IrO2 pair-based batteries. This work offers a new strategy to design and synthesize highly effective multifunctional electrocatalysts using cheaper tannic acid derived carbon as support applied in electrochemical energy devices.									157	11	0	0	5	0	157			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000459624100009

In the catalyst system, carbon nanotubes are served as the support substrate to enhance the conductivity of ZnCo2O4 and provide a high specific area; meanwhile, Au species accelerate the electron-stripping from cobalt ions during the catalytic process, leading to a fast promotion of cobalt ions with high valence state which possess a highly electrocatalytic efficiency. With the well synergistic effect between the components, ZnCo2O4/Au/CNTs exhibits low potential of 1.67 V at j = 10 mA cm(-2), large current density of 97.8 mA cm(-2) at high operating potential (1.8 V), and prominent durability in alkaline.

The focus of this study is to investigate into the influences of chemical impact, thermal variation and ageing effect on microstructure and performance evolutions of ilmenite OCs. Iron element migration, crystallinity and morphology alterations, and irreversible change of chemical composition were identified to be the major aspects responsible for gradual microstructural evolutions of Ilmenite OCs. Iron element migration from bulk materials to particle surface, occurring during the oxidation step of redox cycles, was of temperature- and O-2 concentration- dependences. A schematic diagram was developed to explain the pathways of irreversible iron migration and alteration of chemical composition in redox cycle reactions. By lowering phase interaction between Fe2TiO5 and TiO2, the cycled thermal shock (due to reaction and processing in CLC) promotes the iron element concentration on OC particle surface and the ilmenite OC reactivity. Longterm ageing at elevated temperature, as one of typical severe conditions in CLC, exhibits activation effects for ilmenite OCs, even though it causes increased crystallinity, denser particle structure and redistribution of Fe2TiO5-TiO2 phase									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0378-3820	1873-7188		WOS:000749956300005

The composition and structure of catalysts are of great importance for catalytic performance. In this work, a heterogeneous Ru modified strategy is engineered to improve the catalytic performance of porous NiCo2O4 nanosheets (NSs). Profiting from favorable elements composition and optimized structure property of decreased charge transfer barrier, more accessible active sites and increased oxygen vacancy concentration, the Ru-NiCo2O4 NSs exhibits excellent OER activity with a low overpotential of 230 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) and decent durability. Furthermore, Ru-NiCo2O4 NSs show superior HER activity than the pristine NiCo2O4 NSs, as well. When assembling Ru-NiCo2O4 NSs couple as an alkaline water electrolyzer, a cell voltage of 1.60 V can deliver the current density of 10 mA/cm(2). This work provides feasible guidance for improving the catalytic performance of spinel-based oxides.

Here, nonprecious-metal electrocatalysts (MnO nanowires) are electrochemically deposited on the surface of a porous gold microgrid. The discontinuous solid-liquid contact lines, which are formed by the microgrids during the liquid-phase electrochemical reaction, generate MnO nanowires with high coating uniformity. The micro/nanostructure of the electrode induces a superhydrophilic surface, which facilitates the wetting of the alkaline electrolyte and increases the electrochemical active surface area. Simultaneously, the underwater superaerophobicity of the electrode promotes the release of the oxygen products, thus reducing the occupation of the catalytic sites by the gas bubbles. The synergistic effect of electrolyte wetting and gas release ensures that this superhydrophilic/superaerophobic electrode exhibits a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER at an overpotential of 530 mV in 0.1 m KOH, placing the catalyst among the best MnO catalysts for OER. This work avails a new basis for synergistically optimizing the synthesis methods (electrolyte wetting and gas-bubble release) toward high-performance OER electrodes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-7350			WOS:000723198200001

This compound includes intrinsic oxygen deficiency denoted as d. We obtained a highly oxidized cubic perovskite BSCF by using high-pressure and moderate-temperature (8 GPa and 500 1C) conditions with NaClO3 as the oxidizing agent, although the hexagonal phase was obtained when treated at conventional high-pressure and high-temperature (8 GPa and 1000 1C) conditions with KClO4 as the oxidizing agent. The highly oxidized BSCF sample contained a small amount of oxygen deficiency (d = 0.12) compared to the BSCF samples (d = 0.38) synthesized in typical conditions, thus proposing an alternative route to obtain the metastable phase of highly oxidized perovskite. The electric and magnetic measurements revealed that the metallic phase was predominant for the highly oxidized sample (d = 0.12) in contrast to the non-metallic properties for the conventional oxygen-deficient sample (d = 0.38). The catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was evaluated within a wide range of oxygen content from heavily oxygen-deficient (d = 0.51) to conventional (d = 0.38) to highly oxidized (d = 0.12) samples. Both the highly oxidized and heavily oxygen-deficient samples were inferior to the conventional one in OER catalytic activity, indicating that an adequate amount of oxygen deficiency is favorable for the activation of OER by BSCF.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11				2052-1537		WOS:000471040100020

The reaction between PbO2 and Fe(II) ions produced secondary dual layers, consisting of an inner amorphous FeOOH film and an outer crystalline ?-FeOOH deposit, respectively. This peculiar behavior was in contrast with analogous reactions involving other transition metal ions, which yielded only continuous amorphous secondary oxide layers.

Herein, continuous tracking of the Pb-based anode was conducted for 60 d to reveal the evolution of structure-activity relationship with the growth of AOF. Results showed that three competitive re-actions including Pb corrosion reaction, Mn2+ oxidation reaction and OER on the anode had complex interactive influences on the characteristic evolution of AOF as time increased periodically. With the continuous formation and coverage of AOF (PbSO4/ PbO2/MnO2) during the early 15 d, the Pb-based anode exhibited obvious self-protection effects of less Pb released and less MnO2-containing waste generated, which were attributed to the physically blocking effect of AOF against the excessive exposure of Pb surface by the dense and reticular structure and the electrochemically inhibiting effect for the Mn2+ oxidation by abundant Mn3+ and oxygen vacancy (Ov) of MnO2. Density-Functional-Theory (DFT) calculation indicated that the PbSO4 with higher energy band gap (4.19 eV) and lower formation energy (-1.51 eV atom(-1)) was prone to form and accumulate, which caused increasing voltage and accelerating release of Pb in the late stage due to over-thickness and structure instability of AOF. This study can provide inspiration for the future design or reconstruction of highly effective AOF structure to syn-ergistically reduce pollution generation of Pb and anode slime and decrease OER overpotential.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000862896600005

But the concentration of Co2+ is as low as 0.5 mM due to poor solubility of a cobalt salt in phosphate medium. In the present study, a cobalt acetate based oxygen evolution catalyst (Co-Ac) is prepared from a neutral acetate buffer solution, where the solubility of Co2+ is very high (>100 times in comparison with phosphate buffer solution). The Co-Ac possesses better catalytic activity than the Co-Pi with an additional advantage of easy bulk scale preparation. The comparative studies on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of Co-Ac and Co-Pi in phosphate and acetate buffer electrolytes reveal that the Co-Ac exhibits enhanced synergistic catalytic activity in phosphate solution, probably due to partial substitution of acetate in the catalyst layer by phosphate, resulting in the formation of a Co-Ac-Pi catalyst.									26	1	0	0	0	0	27			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000332395700050	24504009

Herein, iron phosphate (FePi) electrode is synthesized using a successive ionic layer deposition and reaction (SILAR) method on a nickel foam substrate at room temperature and is used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting. The prepared FePi electrodes show excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The FePi electrode exhibits low overpotential of 230 mV and 157 mV towards the OER and HER, respectively, with superior long-term stability. As a result, an electrolyzer that exploits FePi as both the anode and the cathode is constructed, which requires a cell potential of 1.67 V to deliver a 10 mA cm(-2) current density in 1 M KOH solution. The exceptional features of the catalyst lie in its structure and active metal sites, increasing surface area, accelerated electron transport and promoted reaction kinetics. This study may provide a facile and scalable approach to design a high-efficiency, earth abundant electrocatalyst for water splitting. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In this work, a bifunctional catalyst originating from the interfacial assembly of a thin Mo,P-codoped Co layer (approximate to 50 nm) shelled Co nanowire (Co-Mo-P/CoNWs) network is fabricated via a facile approach. The catalyst exhibits low overpotentials of 0.08 and 0.27 V to reach a current response of 20 mA cm(-2)for the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively, together with long-term stability in 1.0mKOH medium. The outstanding performance is further demonstrated by a Co-Mo-P/CoNWs-based electrolyzer, which enables a cell voltage of only 1.495 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2), superior to one derived from commercial (Pt/C + RuO2/C) as well as to various reports recently published elsewhere. It is recognized that the formation of multiactive centers together with the increased active site number caused by Mo and P dual doping synergistically promote both hydrogen and oxygen evolution performance. Such a hybrid material opens a new approach for developing efficient and cost-effective catalysts for water splitting application.									66	0	0	0	4	0	66			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000544597100001

Activating O-2 electrocatalysis on the catalyst surface requires effective regulation of the surface spatial and electronic structure to facilitate the in situ generation of active species. Here, we report an in situ surface reconstruction method to boost the activity of a Ni-based perovskite hydroxide, NiSn(OH)(6), for OER catalysis. The surface reconstruction is modulated by anodic polarization during the OER process, building a Ni3+-containing amorphous layer with selective Sn etching. Taking advantage of the in situ surface amorphization that facilitates the generation of active metal oxy(hydroxide) species, a significant performance enhancement is achieved on NiSn(OH)(6). Theoretical calculations further demonstrate that the Sn vacancies on the surface optimize the electronic structure of the Ni sites and promote the adsorption of the reaction intermediates.									5	0	0	0	0	0	4			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000732017100001

Among different methods, heteroatom doping has been considered as an effective method, which modifies the local bonding environments and the electronic structures. Meanwhile, the design of novel two-dimensional (2D) nanostructures also offers new opportunities for achieving efficient electrocatalysts. In this work, Mn-doped ultrathin Ru nanosheet branches (RuMn NSBs), a newly reported 2D nanostructure, is synthesized. With the ultrathin and naturally abundant edges, the RuMn NSBs have exhibited bifunctionalities of hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction with high electroactivity and durability in different electrolytes. Experimental characterizations have revealed that Ru-O bonds are shortened due to Mn doping, which is the key factor that leads to improved electrochemical performances. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have confirmed that the introduction of Mn enables flexible modulations on the valence states of Ru sites. The inversed redox state evolutions of Ru and Mn sites not only improve the electroactivity for the water splitting but also the long-term stability due to the pinning effect of Ru sites. This work has provided important inspirations for the design of future advanced Ru-based electrocatalysts with high performances and durability.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000707321000001	34610648

In this study, a success was achieved in synthesizing the hollow nanospheres with amorphous nickel-iron phosphorusoxides nanoflakes layer grown on Ni-Fe foam (NiFe-POx/NFF). Firstly, with the assistance of oxygen bubbles templates, the hollow spheres comprised of NiFe-OH nanosheets were produced through the in-situ chemical oxidation of NFF surface. After phosphorylation, crystalline NiFe-OH nanosheets were transformed into amorphous NiFe-POx with plenty of defects and disorders, thus improving the density of active sites. The catalytic performance of NiFe-POx/NFF was further improved by a combination of stable 3D hierarchical nanostructure, effective mass transport and charge transfer, as well as the electrochemical specific surface area expanded by fluffy featherlike nanoflakes. The self-supported electrode of NiFe-POx/NFF exhibited outstanding catalytic property in the presence of alkaline electrolyte, including a small overpotential of 110 and 247 mV required to achieve 50 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER in 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution, respectively. As a bifunctional electrocatalyst, NiFe-POx/NFF could provide a low cell voltage of 1.52 V to reach 20 mV cm(-2) under a two-electrode system as required for the occurrence of overall water electrolysis under alkaline medium, while showing extended durability under continuous electrolysis without degradation.

Herein, we developed a robust synthesis technique consisting of electrochemical exfoliation under alternating currents and subsequent liquid-phase exfoliation to prepare highly uniform few-layer NbS2 nanosheets. The obtained few-layer NbS2 material has a 2D nanosheet structure with an ultrathin thickness of similar to 3nm and a lateral size of similar to 2 mu m. Benefiting from their unique 2D structure and highly exposed active sites, the few-layer NbS2 nanosheets drop-carted on carbon paper exhibited excellent catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acid with an overpotential of 90 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 83 mV dec(-1), which are superior to those reported for other NbS2-based HER electrocatalysts. Furthermore, few-layer NbS2 nanosheets are effective as bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen production by overall water splitting, where the urea and hydrazine oxidation reactions replace the oxygen evolution reaction.									38	1	0	0	1	0	39			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000464769400017	30882199

Oxygen Reduction at the Liquid-Liquid Interface: Bipolar Electrochemistry through Adsorbed Graphene Layers								CHEMELECTROCHEM				3	3	SI		472	479		10.1002/celc.201500343				MAR 2016	2016	The reduction of oxygen and protons at the interface between two immiscible electrolyte solutions (ITIES) has received a great deal of interest over the last decade, with various materials being used to catalyse these reactions. Probing the mechanisms through which these reactions proceed when using interfacial catalysts is important from both from the perspective of fundamental understanding and for catalyst optimisation. Herein, we have used interfacial-assembled graphene to probe the importance of simple electron conductivity towards the catalysis of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the ITIES, and a bipolar setup to probe the homogeneous/heterogeneous nature of the ORR proceeding through interfacial graphene. We found that interfacial graphene provides a catalytic effect towards the reduction of oxygen at the ITIES, proceeding via the heterogeneous mechanism when using a strong reducing agent.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			2196-0216			WOS:000372296100021

Herein, we applied a unique and extremely facile pulsed laser ablation in the liquid synthesis route for the fabrication of phase-engineered CuxSy nanospheres. The multifunctionality of these catalysts was assessed by examining the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). As a result, low overpotentials of 390 mV (HER) and 440 mV (OER) were achieved for sulfur-rich and copper-rich samples in alkaline media, respectively. Furthermore, the high selectivity of Cu over methanol and the high number of electrochemically accessible active sites equal to 7.9 x 10(16) promoted the MOR with a current density of 28.3 mA/cm(2) at the vertex potential. It is worth emphasizing that in this research, we consider the electrocatalyst's initial electrocatalytic water decomposition function to gain a better understanding of the photoelectrocatalytic behavior. Using a beneficial photo-assisted electrochemical method, a high OER catalytic activity was obtained under light irradiation due to the large light absorption coefficients of the synthesized electrocatalysts, which facilitated electron transfer at the electrode-electrolyte interface.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000752949600001
