We present La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM) perovskite nanorods as high active electrocatalyst fabricated via a soft template method for lithium-air batteries. The as-prepared LSM nanorods are microporous with numerous defects and large surface area (20.6 m(2) g(-1)), beneficial to the ORR and OER in the discharge and charge processes, respectively. Lithium-air batteries based on the microporous LSM nanorods electrocatalysts show enhanced electrochemical performances, including high first discharge specific capacity (6890 mAh g((electrode))(-1) at 200 mA g(-1)), low overpotential, good rate capability (up to 400 mA g(-1)), and cycle stability (only 1.1% voltage loss after 30 circles of specific capacity limit of 1000 mAh g(-1) tested at 200 mA g(-1)). The improved performance might be due to the synergistic effect of the unique microporous and one-dimensional structure and numerous defects of the prepared LSM catalyst. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Zhu, Jiahong/0000-0001-5074-935X			Effects of testing conditions on the performance of carbon-supported bifunctional electrodes								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				292				446	457		10.1016/j.electacta.2018.09.168				DEC 1 2018	2018	Carbon-based electrodes with a bifunctional catalyst are being studied extensively for use in rechargeable metal-air batteries. In this study, the effects of various testing conditions on the electrochemical performance, cyclic lifetime, and degradation mechanism of the electrodes prepared using the bifunctional La0.6Ca0.4CoO3 catalyst mixed with the graphitized Vulcan XC-72 carbon black and polytetra-fluoroethylene were evaluated in detail. The electrochemical performance and total cycle life of the electrodes were not noticeably affected by the KOH electrolyte concentration or rest time between the charge/discharge. The charge/discharge current density used for the cyclic test significantly influenced both the total cyclic lifetime and degradation mechanism of the electrode. At the higher current densities (+/- 50 and +/- 100 mA/cm(2)), carbon corrosion led to electrode flooding and the loss of oxygen reduction capability while the oxygen evolution reaction occurring at the catalyst was largely sustained. At a lower current density (+/- 6 mA/cm(2)), with periodic replacement of electrolyte to avoid carbonate formation in the electrode pores, the loss of the anodic catalytic ability of the bifunctional catalyst presumably via surface oxidation was clearly evident from the increase in oxygen evolution reaction overpotential. With the unchanged electrolyte, the electrode gas transport pore could be blocked by carbonate formation, leading to a decreased catalytic capability of the electrode for oxygen reduction. The failure modes of these electrodes under various cycling conditions were also assessed using impedance spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry.

Although transition bimetal catalysts have advantages for OER, which of the metal plays a dominant role is still not clearly identified. Here, we synthesized a series of crystal (NixCo1-x)(2)B catalysts via a simple ball-milling method. Among these catalysts, (Ni0.75Co0.25)(2)B exhibits the best OER activity with a low overpotential of 224 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in a 1 M KOH solution as well as robust stability, which is superior to that of the benchmark IrO2 catalyst. More importantly, the chemical origins of these catalysts have been successfully identified via CV cycling on hydrophobic and hydrophilic electrodes. We found that Co sites served as both the adsorption centers of OH* intermediates and active centers for OER, while Ni sites facilitated the key conversion of Co2+ to Co3+ during OER through CV cycling. The findings are well supported by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data. Our results open a reasonable strategy for high-performance OER catalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000524587800016

The results showed that with the increase of temperature, the corrosion rate of J55 steel first increased and then decreased and the corrosion rate reached the maximum at 100degC. The corrosion rate was closely related to the formation of corrosion products. The increase of the flow rate speeded up the transfer rate of the corrosive medium to the metal surface and hindered the formation of FeCO3 on the metal surface. The corrosion rate was significantly higher than the corrosion rate under static conditions, and as the flow rate increased, the corrosion rate of J55 steel increased accordingly. The increase of the pH value gradually reduced the concentration of hydrogen ions, and cathodic reaction of hydrogen ion depolarization during metal corrosion process was inhibited, and the tendency to form an oxidizing protective film on the surface of carbon steel increased, thereby reducing the corrosion rate of metals. With the increase of oxygen content, there were both hydrogen evolution reaction of CO2 and oxygen absorption reaction caused by O2in the cathode process. The corrosion rate of J55 steel gradually increased, and at the same oxygen content, the higher the carbon dioxide content, the greater the corrosion rate is.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0255-5476			INSPEC:21062944

However, catalyst development for hydrogen and oxygen evolution remains a challenge under neutral conditions. Here we report a simple electrodeposition and reductive annealing procedure to produce a highly active Ni-Co-Cr metal/metal oxide heterostructured catalyst directly on Ni foam. The resulting electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) requires only 198 mV of overpotential to reach 100 mA/cm(2) in 1 M potassium phosphate (pH = 7.4) and can operate for at least two days without significant performance decay. Scanning transmission electron microscopy coupled with electron energy loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) imaging reveals a Ni-Co alloy core decorated with blended oxides layers of NiO, CoO and Cr2O3. The metal/metal oxide interfaces are suggested to be responsible for the high HER activity.									23	7	0	0	2	0	24			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000469405300026

However, the Zn-air battery suffers from huge energy loss and poor cycling performance, which are due to the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER) and the instability of bifunctional catalysts. The state-of-the-art bifunctional catalyst is the composite of Pt and Ir/Ru oxides, which is hindered by the scarce resource and high cost. Therefore, developing low-cost and high-efficient bifunctional nonnoble metal-based catalysts is essential to the deployment of Zn-air batteries. Herein, we report a dual-nitrogensource mediated pyrolysis route to rationally design and synthesize the hybrid Co/Co-N-C bifunctional catalyst. The tailored catalyst consisting of carbon confined Co nanoparticles and atomically dispersed Co-N-C moiety is identified. Remarkably, the dual-nitrogen-source derived Co/Co-N-C catalyst demonstrates excellent electrochemical performances with a half-wave potential of 0.882 V for ORR and a potential of 1.640 Vat 10 mA cm(-2) for OER; reasonably, the bifunctionality of Co/Co-N-C, which is supported by the excellent self-breathing Zn-air battery performance (the maximum energy density of 897.1 Wh kg(Zn)(-1); no obvious degradation within 167h cycling). The abundant Co-Nx sites and metallic Co nanoparticles synergistically boost the ORR and OER.									23	3	0	0	1	0	23			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000607096900002

Extensive studies have been reported to further improve the electrocatalytic activity of NiFe-LDHs via various strategies. However, controlling the degree of amorphization and stabilizing the amorphous zone during the electrocatalytic process are still challenging. Here, we report a facile method to synthesize a space-confined amorphous NiFe-LDH (SCA-NiFe-LDH) by selectively etching the surfaces of electrocatalysts. Due to the successful anchoring of amorphous zones onto the basal planes of the two-dimensional NiFe-LDH, the optimized SCA-NiFe-LDH exhibits high electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential of 190 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 31 mV dec(-1) and excellent long-term stability. The substantially enhanced OER performance is attributed to the increased amount of active sites and the modified electronic structure of NiFe-LDH after amorphization.									27	5	0	0	1	0	27			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000490991700035	31596308

Herein, an intrinsic p-type poly(3hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is used as hole transport layer (HTL) for the first time to unleash the potential of BiVO4(BV)/NiCo-layered double hydroxide(LDH) photoanode. Furthermore, tetra-tert-butyl substituted copper (II) phthalocyanine (CuPc) derivative as dopant is introduced into the P3HT HTL to compensate the energy loss of photogenerated holes in the BV/P3HT/LDH photoanode. Benefitted from the modulated HTL, the prepared BV/P3HT-CuPc/LDH photoanode exhibits a superior photocurrent density of 5.54 mA cm-2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE with hole scavenger and 4.25 mA cm-2 in borate buffer electrolyte. The built-in potential formed at the interface of BiVO4 film and P3HT HTL is beneficial for rapid hole extraction and transfer, while the doped CuPc induces outward driving force for the photoinduced holes to participate in OER more efficiently. This work provides a pioneering view for designing energy band matched HTL by considering charge transport and charge energy to balance the transfer efficiency in bulk and at solid/liquid interface of photoanode for water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000875172200004

The chemical stability, microstructure evolution and electrochemical performance of the composite cathode are investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and AC impedance spectroscopy respectively. The composite cathode exhibits enhanced chemical stability. The metal Ag remains un-reacted with SCC and Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (CGO) at 800 degrees C for 72 h. The polarization resistance of the composite cathode decreases with the addition of metal Ag. The optimum cathode SCC-Ag05 exhibits the lowest area specific resistance (ASR, 0.43 Omega cm(2)) at 700 degrees C in air. Investigation shows that metal Ag accelerates the charge transfer process in the composite cathode, and the rate limiting step for electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) changes to oxygen dissociation and diffusion process.

Much attention is devoted to the structure design and the composite incorporation to develop the catalytic activity and durability of perovskite oxides used in the electrode. Herein, we propose an integration of atomic layered deposition iron oxide and perovskite LaNiO3 as a novel catalyst for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Owing to the unique interconnected structure and the synergistic effect of Fe2O3 and LaNiO3, the 6 nm thick Fe2O3/LaNiO3 hybrid catalyst demonstrates the considerable intrinsic activities, which favorably outperforms other the state of the art perovskite catalysts. In addition, the Li-O-2 battery employing this tailored catalyst displays a significantly decreased reduced discharge/charge voltage gap of 0.77 V at 50 mA g(-1) with good rate capability and considerable cycle stability, indicating the practical feasibility of Fe2O3/LaNiO3 hybrid as a promising oxygen electrode catalyst for Li-O-2 batteries. This study highlights a new and feasible scheme to promote the bi-functionally of perovskite catalysts for the development of Li-O-2 batteries and other electrochemical devises.

Here we present the synthesis and application of porous CoMn2O4 and MnCo2O4 spinel microspheres as highly efficient multifunctional catalysts that unify the electrochemical OER with oxidant-driven and photocatalytic water oxidation as well as the ORR. The porous materials were prepared by the thermal degradation of the respective carbonate precursors at 400 degrees C. The as-prepared spinels display excellent performances in electrochemical OER for the cubic MnCo2O4 phase in comparison to the tetragonal CoMn2O4 material in an alkaline medium. Moreover, the oxidant-driven and photocatalytic water oxidations were performed and they exhibited a similar trend in activity to that of the electrochemical OER. Remarkably, the situation is reversed in ORR catalysis, that is, the oxygen reduction activity and stability of the tetragonal CoMn2O4 catalyst outperformed that of cubic MnCo2O4 and rivals that of benchmark Pt catalysts. The superior catalytic performance and the remarkable stability of the unifying materials are attributed to their unique porous and robust microspherical morphology and the intrinsic structural features of the spinels. Moreover, the facile access to these high-performance materials enables a reliable and cost-effective production on a large scale for industrial applications.									189	4	0	0	10	0	190			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000347541700020	25394186

Scrap tungsten carbide-cobalt (WC-Co) die, used in wire drawing processes in industrial applications, may be recovered as tungsten trioxide (WO3) by the electrolysis method. In this study, all composite catalysts were prepared as their weight percentage IW-x (0 <= x <= 100). Here, I, W, and x represent IrO2, WO3, and the weight percent of Ir in the mixed composite oxide, respectively. Then, the prepared IW-75, IW-50, and IrO2 catalysts are referred to as 75% IrO2-25% WO3, 50% IrO2-50% WO3, and Ir's pure oxide form, respectively. These materials are compared with WO3 and IrO2 to investigate their OER performance. According to the linear sweep voltammetry results, the IW-75 catalyst has a 15.03% higher current density than the pure IrO2 catalyst. In the Tafel polarization curve of the catalysts, it is determined that the corrosion potential of IW-75 is enhanced, and the overpotential value is decreased 1.2 times compared to the synthesized IrO2 catalyst sample. As a result, using composite oxide from scrap wire drawing die and IrO2, the cost of the proton-exchange membrane water electrolyzer's anode catalyst is reduced by more than 25%.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-0485			WOS:000859201300001

Yet, slow ORR (oxygen reduction reaction) and OER (oxygen evolution reaction) kinetics demonstrate a limiting factor for energy conversion performance of high-tech ZABs. Hence the development of effective catalysts for ORR and OER at air electrode to remarkably reduce the polarization loss in metallic-air batteries that seriously prevents the rate capability, operating life and energy performance is very important. We illustrate the powerful ZABs with innovative electrochemical-synthesized benzene-1,3,5 tricarboxylate (BTC)metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) bi-functional oxygen electrocatalysts as compared to routine MOFs. Ni/Fe-BTC-MOF shows superior electrocatalytic activity (0.595 V) with half-wave potential (0.964 V) for ORR and over-potential (1.521@10 mA cm(-2)) for OER, outperforming commercial RuO2 and Pt/C. Ni/Fe-BTC-MOF cathode represents a high open circuit potential (1.55 V), discharge peak power density (182 mW cm(2)) and a large specific capacity (775 mAh g(-1) at 10 mA cm(-2)) compared to the previous reported. Also Ni/Fe-BTC-MOF shows the excellent lifetimes for 594 h (65.80% round trip efficiency @10 mA cm(-2)) with 5264 cycles. These encouraging results demonstrate the great potential of these novel MOFs for marketable execution of rechargeable Zn-air batteries.									37	3	0	0	1	0	37			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000518874300001

However, most reported metal/metal compound heterostructures were designed by partially converting the metal into corresponding metal compound on a one-metal basis. Herein, a facile "coordination construction-thermal decomposition" strategy is developed to construct Co/MnO heterointerface embedded in N-doped carbon nanowires by employing nitrilotriacetic acid as chelating agents to stabilize different metal ions and construct the nanowire structure. The in situ generated Co nanocrystals not only create highly conductive heterointerfaces with MnO, but also facilitate the formation of graphitic carbon as the conductive agent. The resultant Co/MnO@NC exhibits extraordinary bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic activities and durability with a reversible oxygen overpotential of only 0.66 V. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the formation of Co/MnO heterostructure leads to optimized adsorption energy for oxygen-containing intermediates in OER and ORR. As the air-cathode, the assembled aqueous zinc-air battery (ZAB) can provide a remarkable peak power density of 146 mW cm(-2) and an impressive discharge/charge stability for 400 h/600 cycles at 20 mA cm(-2). The Co/MnO@NC-based quasi-solid-state ZAB also exhibits outstanding mechanical flexibility in addition to high battery performance. This strategy can be extended to prepare Fe/MnO@NC and Ni/MnO@NC electrocatalysts with other iron group elements, which paves a new way for development of efficient and robust electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage.									15	0	0	0	3	0	15			2405-8297			WOS:000703793400004

In this work, we report an OER catalyst comprising Cr-CoFe, CoFe, Co5.47N and Fe3O4 sites embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene (denoted as CCF-1) that operates remarkably in alkaline water. This catalyst requires only 210/290 mV overpotential to generate current densities of 10/500 mA cm(-2) with small Tafel slope (39.1 mV dec(-1)) which is much better than the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst (310 mV @10 mAcm(-2) with Tafel slope of 74.8 mV dec(-1)). This striking OER performance is ascribed to substituted Cr atoms in the host matrix which modulated the geometric site/electronic structure of the catalyst and brings the optimal binding energies for oxygen intermediate with increased charge/mass transfer process for the fast kinetics of the OER reactions. Furthermore, CCF-1 demonstrated excellent OER durability which maintains the stable performance during the 200 h chronoamperometry test in 1 M KOH solution. The high stability of CCF-1 is attributed to the physicochemical protection effect of N doped graphitic layers which prevents the alloy nanoparticles from dissolution/re-deposition and aggregation during the prolonged OER operation.									14	1	0	0	1	0	14			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000601347000006

High over-potential and poor stability of catalysts remain to be challenges for overall water splitting. In this work, through the first-principles calculations, we screen a novel series of TM@C8N8 monolayers, constructed by embedding transition metal atoms in our proposed C8N8 monolayer based on poly(pyrazine-2,3-diamine) units using the kinetic stability and the projected density of states. Their catalytic performance of intrinsic TM-N-4 moiety is investigated for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) using the Gibbs free energy change (Delta G) of each elementary step. Especially, Rh@C8N8 exhibits superior catalytic activity toward HER and OER with hydrogen adsorption free energy (Delta G(H)*)/over-potential (eta) of 0.08 eV/0.49 V at pH = 7. In addition, it is unbroken at high temperatures (1000 K) using the first-principle molecular dynamics simulation. Therefore, Rh@C8N8 monolayer can perform as an efficient bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting. It is also expected that our results can serve as the theoretical basis to open the door for future experimental research on novel CN layered-materials containing TM-N-4 moiety.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000630052600001

The formation of NiOx through the electro-oxidation process has been proved by SEM and EDX, with some dense black dots appearing on the surface of Ni foam and the molar ratio of O/Ni increasing, which is nearly 7 times larger than the pure Ni foam. The increase in O content indicates the formatted black particles on the surface of Ni foam are composed of NiOx. The electrocatalytic property of the obtained 3D NiOx/Ni structure has been measured and it can be used as a highly active electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The overpotential to reach j= 10 mA cm(-2) is 0.39 V. And after the long-term I-t measurement, extremely high electrochemical and physical stability are exhibited in the 3D structure, keeping electrochemical activity and morphology the same. The excellent OER properties may be attributed to the 3D structure and the interface effect of NiOx/Ni. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Firstly, electrodeposition process is conducted to fabricate binary Ni-Co hydroxides on NF (NiCo/NF). Then, a hydrothermal sulfuration of NiCo/NF has been adopted to prepare NiCoS nanorods arrays uniformly grown on the surface of NF (NiCoS/NF). XRD indicates that NiCoS/NF has mixed crystal phases of Ni3S2, CoS and Co9S8. SEM images display the uniform NiCoS nanorods composed of many vertical nanosheets on the surface, implying more exposed active sites. OER measurements demonstrate that NiCoS/NF has better activity with an overpotential of 370 mV to reach 100 mA cm(-2) than NiCo/NF and CoSx/NF. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests confirm the faster charge-transfer rate of NiCoS/NF and smaller Tafel slope derived from binary NiCoS, implying the excellent electrocatalytic performances of binary metal sulfides.

The reaction process was monitored by UV-vis absorbance spectra and X-ray diffraction (XRD), which clearly demonstrate a structure evolution from NPC precursor to a Pd-rich PdCu alloy structure upon the completion of the reaction. Structure characterization by means of transmission electron microscope (TEM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) indicates that the replacement reaction between NPC and [PdCl4](2-) solution results in a nanotubular mesoporous structure with a nanoporous shell, which is comprised of interconnected alloy nanoparticles with size around 3 run. The resulted PdCu nanostructure shows superior activity toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with a half-wave potential at 0.840 V, which is significantly better than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst.									143	8	0	0	9	0	148			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000268174400016

Platinum (Pt) catalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a promising technology to produce hydrogen because the consumed electricity can be generated from renewable energy. To overcome the high cost of Pt, one effective strategy is decreasing the Pt nanoparticle (NP) size from submicron to nano-scale or even down to single atom level for efficient interacting water molecules. Herein, atomically dispersed Pt and ultra-fine Pt NPs embedded porous carbons were prepared through the pyrolysis of Pt porphyrin-based conjugated microporous polymer. As-prepared electrocatalyst exhibit high HER activity with overpotential of down to 31 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and mass activity of up to 1.3 A mg(Pt)(-1) at overpotential of 100 mV, which is double of commercial Pt/C (0.66 A mg(Pt)(-1)). Such promising performance can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of the atomically dispersed Pt and ultra-fine Pt NPs. This work provides a new strategy to prepare porous carbons with both atomically dispersed metal active sites and corresponding metal NPs for various electrocatalysis, such as oxygen reduction reaction, carbon dioxide reduction, etc.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				1996-1944		WOS:000529875600031	32224913

The nanocomposite PEDOT/nano-Co3O4/rGO is discussed as an example in this respect, which is specific for photo electro-catalytic oxygen (O-2) generation from water using light (PEDOT = poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene); rGO = reduced graphene oxide). We show that the conducting polymer PEDOT and the conductive additive rGO may be used to notably amplify the rate of O-2-generation from water by the nano catalyst, Co3O4. A composite film containing the precise molar ratio 7.18 (C; PEDOT):1 (Co):5.18 (C; rGO) exhibited high photocatalytic activity (pH 12) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 0.80 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), with a current density of 1000 +/- 50 mu A/cm(2) (including a photocurrent of 500 mu A/cm(2)), achieved after >42 h of operation under illumination with a light of intensity 0.25 sun. By comparison, the best industrial catalyst, Pt, yielded a much lower 150 mu A/cm(2) under the same conditions. Oxygen gas was the sole product of the reaction.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2504-477X			WOS:000702317200001

This study numerically dealt with the coupling modeling of chemically reacting interface in carbon-oxygen dissociating environment in order to accurately and reliably predict the Mars entry heating load. Computational fluid dynamics, computational heat transfer and interface balance with proper coupling strategy were involved in the coupling algorithm to take into account the surface catalysis, material ablation and structural thermal response. Numerical simulation shows that the interfacial reaction model has influences on coupling evolution by exchanging various patterns of heat transfer on the interface, including that from temperature gradient, that caused by chemical reaction, and that carried by the injection kinetic energy. The types and energy barriers of interfacial reaction were found to change the aerodynamic heating enhancement and its evolution over coupling time, which is the most remarkable difference from the perfect gas result. Gas-solid interaction involving interfacial reaction exhibits three distinct temporal intervals: the initial, developing and fully developed stages, and the chemical dynamics and heat transfer characteristics vary at different temporal scales. Related research provides important technical support for the design of thermal protection system for space vehicles.					7th Asian Symposium on Computational Heat Transfer and Fluid Flow (ASCHT)7th Asian Symposium on Computational Heat Transfer and Fluid Flow (ASCHT)	SEP 03-07, 2019SEP 03-07, 2019	Heat Transfer Soc Japan; Japan Soc Mech Engineers; Asian Union Thermal Sci & EngnHeat Transfer Soc Japan; Japan Soc Mech Engineers; Asian Union Thermal Sci & Engn	Tokyo Univ Sci, Tokyo, JAPANTokyo Univ Sci, Tokyo, JAPAN	2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1880-5566			WOS:000556912600008

For these batteries and electrolyzers to be economically viable, it is essential to have efficient, durable, and inexpensive electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction. In this article, we describe new insights for predicting and tuning the activity of inexpensive transition metal oxides for designing efficient and inexpensive electrocatalysts. We have focused on understanding the factors determining the electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution in a strong alkaline medium. To this end, we have conducted a systematic investigation of nanophase calcium-doped lanthanum cobalt manganese oxide, an example of a mixed metal oxide that can be tuned for its electrocatalytic activity by varying the transition metal composition. Using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electrochemical polarization experiments, and analysis of mechanisms, we have identified the key determinants of electrocatalytic activity. We have found that the Tafel slopes are determined by the oxidation states and the bond energy of the surface intermediates of Mn-OH and Co-OH bonds while the catalytic activity increased with the average d-electron occupancy of the sigma* orbital of the M-OH bond. We anticipate that such understanding will be very useful in predicting the behavior of other transition metal oxide catalysts.									38	1	0	0	4	0	38			1932-7447			WOS:000353249500004

Herein, we demonstrated that RuO2 can be also efficiently used as an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalyst, thereby serving as a bifunctional material for rechargeable Zn-air batteries. We found two forms of RuO2 (i.e. hydrous and anhydrous, respectively h-RuO2 and ah-RuO2) to show different ORR and OER electrocatalytic characteristics. Thus, h-RuO2 required large ORR overpotentials, although it completed the ORR via a 4e process. In contrast, h-RuO2 triggered the OER at lower overpotentials at the expense of showing very unstable electrocatalytic activity. To capitalize on the advantages of h-RuO2 while improving its drawbacks, we designed a unique structure (RuO2@C) where h-RuO2 nanoparticles were embedded in a carbon matrix. A double hydrophilic block copolymer-templated ruthenium precursor was transformed into RuO2 nanoparticles upon formation of the carbon matrix via annealing. The carbon matrix allowed overcoming the limitations of h-RuO2 by improving its poor conductivity and protecting the catalyst from dissolution during OER. The bifunctional RuO2@C catalyst demonstrated a very low potential gap (triangle EOER-ORR=ca. 1.0V) at 20 mA cm(-2). The Zn|| RuO2@C cell showed an excellent stability (i.e. no overpotential was observed after more than 40 h).									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			2045-2322			WOS:000406816300023	28769087

Opening LDH with expanded interlayer is highly desirable to expose more active sites for electrocatalysis and more accessible surface for ion transfer in the interlayer, which can greatly boost the performance of LDH. Herein, interlayer expanded nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) was fabricated by the intercalation with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) using a one-pot hydrothermal route. For compassion, the NiFe-LDH without SDS were also prepared as hierarchical hollow spheres (NiFe-LDH HSs), while hollow spheres were transformed into hierarchical nanosheets (NiFe(SDS)-LDH NSs) with the addition of SDS. Moreover, the interlayer spacing of NiFe(SDS)-LDH NSs was effectively enlarged to 2.36 nm contrast to 0.77 nm of NiFe-LDH HSs. As expected, a highly enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance was obtained on NiFe(SDS)-LDH NSs with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotential of 115 mV, while 225 mV for NiFe-LDH HSs. The intercalation of SDS in NiFe-LDH plays an indispensable role in boosting OER. It indicates the importance of enlarging the interlayer space of LDH for high-performance OER. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with tunable composition, morphology as well as porous structure are desirable for constructing various functional materials acting as precursors. In this work, a facile self-templating strategy is developed to synthesize hollow Fe-CoxP nanospheres. The solid Co-glycerate nanospheres are synthesized and used as self-sacrificing templates, which are converted to Co-Fe Prussian blue analogue (PBA) via an anion-exchange process by reacting with K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] at room temperature, and then followed by phosphorization treatment to produce the Fe-CoxP. The transformation process endows the resultant product not only the hollow nanostructure, but also Fe atoms doping into the CoxP. By taking advantages of structural and compositional benefits as well as improved conductivity, the Fe-CoxP exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), reaching the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 300 mV. The post-OER catalyst is carefully characterized and the results indicate the phase transformation of the crystalline Fe-CoxP to the amorphous FeCo (oxy)hydroxides acting as the catalytically active species. The novel self-templating strategy avoids the challenge from the removal of the template, which can possibly be employed to produce a sequence of PBA-based functional nanomaterials for applications in electrochemical energy conversion and storage.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000618081200004

In this study, using a novel solution-reduction process, self-assembled Ir/IrOx OER catalysts are prepared, with a controlled Ir oxidation-state ratios. Spectroscopic and electron microscopic analyses confirm that these catalysts have a gradient oxidation state, which gradually decreases from the shell to the core. In half-cell tests, before and after the accelerated stress test (AST) at 10 mA cm(-2), the optimized Ir/IrOx catalyst exhibits an overpotential change of approximately 21 mV(RHE), which is 3.3 times lesser than that of the state-of-the-art IrO2 (approximately 69 mV(RHE)). Further, quantification of the dissolved Ir content during the AST shows that the Ir/IrOx catalyst has a strong corrosion resistance under acidic OER conditions. Single-cell testing of the as-prepared OER catalyst demonstrates a remarkable cell performance of 1.73 V at 1.0 A cm(-2). After 48-h durability testing, the increase in the membrane electrode assembly cell voltage with the as-prepared OER catalyst is approximately 5.3 times lesser than that of the reference at 250 mA cm(-2). The proposed novel catalyst with high activity and stability can aid the development of cost-effective PEMWE systems.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000637753500005

And it is improved that the research on direct use of MOFs as electrocatalysts through the development of two-dimensional (2D) shaped MOFs direction is feasible. In this paper, a kind of ultrathin NiFeZn-MOF nanosheets containing few metal oxide nanoparticles grown on nickel foam (NiFeZn-MNS/NF) are successfully synthesized, and they are used as catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and overall water splitting. The NiFeZn-MNS/NF catalyst behaves the most excellent electrocatalytic performance with the best overpotential of 350 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) and has the best current density stability with the 5% drop of the initial polarization current density at the end of 120 h. The voltage of NiFeZn-MNS/NF as a bifunctional overall water-splitting catalyst is 1.52 V at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to commercial noble metal electrocatalytic combination of RuO2/NF(+)//Pt-C/NF(-)(1.63 V). The structure and morphology of the nanosheets and the synergistic effect of nickel, iron and zinc ions enhance the catalytic activity. While the addition of zinc ion promotes the rapid growth of nanosheets on nickel foams, which further improves the stability of nanosheets. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we report a nickel/tungsten carbide (Ni/WC) composite catalyst in which WC nanoparticles are embedded underneath thin Ni layers as a highly active OER catalyst in an alkaline electrolyte. The thin Ni layer has a modulated electronic structure stemming from the interaction with the WC. The Ni/WC composite exhibits excellent OER activity and durability in a 1 M KOH solution. The turnover frequency of the Ni/WC composite (0.58 s(-1)) is increased by approximately 5.8 times relative to that of the Ni nanoparticles (0.10 s(-1)). The significant increase in catalytic activity of the Ni/WC composite can be attributed to the adsorption property change originating from the interaction between the Ni layers and the WC nanoparticles. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculation results show that the electronic structure of the Ni layers can change due to electron transfers from the WC nanoparticles to the Ni layer across their interfaces. This electronic structure change reduces the kinetic barrier of the rate-determining step of the OER pathway by lowering the O* binding energy that impedes the OER kinetics. As a result, the overall OER on the Ni/WC surface is accelerated. These findings suggest a unique strategy by which to enhance the catalytic activity of the OER in an alkaline electrolyte.									10	1	0	0	1	0	12			2574-0962			WOS:000469885300053

The electronic and surface structure, shape, size, and catalyst support largely control the electrocatalytic activity. We demonstrate the synthesis of bifunctional CoFe alloy electrocatalysts encased in nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon (N-C-CoFe) and supported on nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO-CoFe) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the influence of catalyst support on the electrocatalytic performance. N-C-CoFe and N-rGO-CoFe were synthesized from a single-source precursor, potassium cobalt hexacyanoferrate multimetal complex, by thermal annealing. Both catalysts efficiently catalyze ORR and OER at low overpotential. The benchmark current density of 10 mA/cm(2) for OER is obtained at very low overpotentials of 0.22 and 0.29 V with N-rGO-CoFe and N-C-CoFe, respectively. The N-C-CoFe catalyst is highly durable toward OER and ORR, whereas N-rGO-CoFe has limited durability. N-C-CoFe could retain >98% of its initial ORR activity even after repeated 2000 cycles. The chemical nature of nitrogen and degree of graphitization of the catalyst support largely control the overall performance of the catalyst. A highly graphitized carbon (sp(2) C-C) support containing a large amount of graphitic nitrogen highly favors ORR. The effective encapsulation of the active catalyst into nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon and the presence of nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon nanostructures ensure high durability of the catalyst in a harsh environment. The graphitized carbon with a large amount of graphitic nitrogen is an ideal catalyst support for bifunctional CoFe alloy catalysts.									30	0	0	0	2	0	30			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000439661000005

Herein, we first reported the successful synthesis of delafossite CuGaO2 particles with three different morphologies, i.e. nanocrystalline hexagons, sub-micron sized plates and micron sized particles by a modified hydrothermal method at 190 degrees C for 60 h [1-3], a sono-chemical method followed by firing at 850 degrees C for 48 h, and a solid state route at 1150 degrees C, respectively. Morphology, composition and phase purity of the synthesized samples was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopic studies, and then their electrocatalytic performance as active and cost effective electrode materials to the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions in 0.5 M KOH electrolyte versus Ag/AgCl was investigated and compared under the same conditions for the first time. The nanocrystalline CuGaO2 hexagons show enhanced electrocatalytic activity than the counterpart sub-micron sized plates and micron-sized particles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, ORR is currently facing the dilemma of sluggish intrinsic kinetics and the noble electrocatalysts of high price and low reserves. In this work, isolated Co atoms anchored on defective nitrogen-doped carbon graphene single-atom catalyst (Co-SAC/NC) are synthesized via the proposed movable type printing method. The prepared Co-SAC/NC catalyst demonstrates admirable ORR performance, with a high half-wave potential of 0.884 V in alkaline electrolytes and outstanding durability. In addition, an assembled zinc-air battery with prepared Co-SAC/NC as air-cathode catalyst displays a high-peak power density of 179 mW cm(-2) and a high-specific capacity (757 mAh g(-1)). Density functional theory calculations confirm that the true active sites of the prepared catalyst are Co-N-4 moieties, and further reveal a significantly electronic structure evolution of Co sites in the ORR process, in which the project density of states and local magnetic moment of Co atom varies during its whole reaction process. This work not only paves a new avenue for synthesizing SACs as robust electrocatalysts, but also provides an electronic-level insight into the evolution of the electronic structure of single-atom catalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2575-0356		WOS:000777676700001

Herein, we developed a superior nonprecious bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst, fabricated through spatial confinement of Fe/Fe3C nanocrystals in pyridinic N and Fe-N-x rich carbon nanotubes (Fe/Fe3C-N-CNTs). During ORR, the resultant electrocatalyst exhibits positive onset potential of 1.0 V (vs. RHE), large half-wave potentials of 0.88 V (vs. RHE), which is more positive than Pt/C (0.98 V and 0.83 V, respectively). Remarkably, Fe/Fe3C- N-CNTs exhibits outstanding durability and great methanol tolerance, exceeding Pt/C and most reported nonprecious metal-based oxygen reduction electrocatalysts. Moreover, Fe/Fe3C-N-CNTs show a markedly low potential at j =10 mA/cm(2), small Tafel slopes and extremely high stability for OER. Impressively, the Fe/ Fe3C-N-CNTs-based Zn-air batteries demonstrate high power density of 183 mW/cm(2) and robust charge/ discharge stability. It is revealed that the spatial confinement effect can impede the aggregation and corrosion of Fe/Fe3C nanocrystals. Meanwhile, Fe/Fe3C and Fe-N-x play synergistic effect on boosting the ORR/OER activity, which provides an important guideline for construction of inexpensive nonprecious metal-carbon hybrid nanomaterials.

An outperform and active non-noble electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction which is a hotspot in the current research activities for oxygen & hydrogen production with zero carbon dioxide emission. Herein, we present an advanced material Co3O4/polyethyne for the first time to produce oxygen at a reasonable overpotential. The best oxygen evolution performance of Co3O4/ polyethyne (20) providing the best performance at low overpotential 260 mV at 10 mAcm(-2) the Tafel slope 64 mVdec(1), further strongly acceptable durability approximately for the 30 h & finally obtained charge transfer resistance value of 82.58 Ohms & greater capacitance 1.56 mF value for Co3O4. The key element in the success of newly developed catalyst is the greater amount of Co3O4 nanoparticles due to selective growth on polyethyne which has played a dominant role in oxygen production. It is because of the worth mentioning properties of polyethyne as a good electrical conductor, as efficient catalyst Co3O4 with more surface roughness and high surface area, which is strongly boosting the production of oxygen. The developed material can be applied in other competing fields such as lithium-ion batteries, solar cells, energy storage devices, and photochemical water splitting.

Unfortunately, many promising ionic liquid electrolytes suffer degradation under the operation conditions of Li-O-2 batteries. This work demonstrates that the addition of redox mediators can transform the reaction mechanism and suppress the degradation of the electrolytes in Li-O-2 batteries. 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoro-methylsulfonyl)imide (EMIMTFSI) is a room temperature ionic liquid that is widely being explored for battery applications, but its instability in the presence of reduced oxygen species (superoxide) limits application in Li-O-2 batteries. The addition of redox mediators can suppress the degradation of EMIMTFSI in Li-O-2 cells, leading to remarkable improvements in capacity and reversibility. In situ surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy and operando-pressure evaluation demonstrate that 2,5-ditert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DBBQ) is capable of suppressing the attack of superoxide species against EMIMTFSI, thus promoting the desirable two-electron pathway to the Li2O2 discharge product. A detailed evaluation of the gas evolution was carried out using online mass spectrometry. In spite of an efficient two-electron oxygen reduction with the use of DBBQ additive, this effect did not translate into a substantial improvement in the oxygen evolution during charging. However, when a charge mediator was used in combination with DBBQ a significant improvement in oxygen evolution could be observed. This work provides the first direct experimental evidence that redox mediators can enable the incorporation of electrolytes prone to degradation by the attack of superoxide species in practical and reversible Li-O-2 batteries.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000482545700019

RuO2 nanoparticles with the mean size of 1.57 nm are uniformly distributed on Mn2O3 nano-rods grown on electrospun CNFs. The electrocatalytic activity of the composites are investigated towards ORR/OER under alkaline condition. The ternary RuO2/Mn2O3/CNF composite showed superior ORR activity in terms of onset potential (0.95 V versus RHE) and Tafel slope (121 mV dec(-1)) compared to its RuO2/CNF and Mn2O3/CNF counterparts. In the case of OER, the RuO2/Mn2O3/CNF exhibited 0.34 V over-potential value measured at 10 mA cm(-2) and 52 mV dec(-1) Tafel slope which are lower than those of the other synthesized samples and as compared to state of the art RuO2 and IrOx, type materials.

In the present work, ultrafine Fe3O4 nanoparticles were uniformly decorated on the layered surface of graphene oxide (GO) sheets using the microwave-assisted hydrothermal method and successfully tested for bifunctional oxygen reaction activities for the first time. This heterostructure composites were used as a promising candidate for highly efficient bifunctional material for oxygen evolution/reduction reactions (ORR/OER) in both KOH and H2SO4 solutions. The composite structure and morphology were characterized by scanning and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These heterostructure composites show a very low onset potential value for ORR (0.975 V vs RHE) and OER (1.25 V vs RHE) in the presence of KOH solution. Additionally, the composites exhibit superior performance activity for ORR (0.92 V vs RHE) and OER (1.2 V vs RHE) in sulfuric acid solution. Interestingly, the pure GO showed a better result than the previously reported work that supported the superior electrocatalytic performance of the hybrid composites. This coupling of techniques provides a higher density of Fe-C-O crystalline sites and ultrafine Fe-O particles as boosting higher charge transferability in the composites.

Herein, we report a simple yet robust route to synthesize cobalt nanoparticles rooted in the hierarchically hollow nitrogen-doped carbon frameworks (Co@HNCs). This strategy employs the pyrolysis of nanostructured hollow Co-based metal-organic framework (ZIF-67) precursors produced by selective linker cleaving with pyrazino(2,3-f)(1,10)phenanthroline-2,3-dicarboxylic acid molecules (H(2)PPDA). The designed hierarchically architecture is favorable for the accessibility of the active sites in the catalyst, which affords enhanced bifunctional performance for ORR and OER. Moreover, when used as a cathode in liquid and all-solid-state Zn-air batteries, the resultant Co@HNCs delivers high efficiency and outstanding durability, even outperforming the benchmark Pt/C + RuO2. This work provides a feasible design avenue to achieve advanced dual-phasic oxygen electrocatalyst and promotes the development of rechargeable Zn-air batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000858980000001	36149364

In a PV-EC system, efficient catalysts are required to increase the rate of both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, the development of a CoFeVOx bifunctional catalyst produced by a simple electrodeposition method is presented. It is found that after the water splitting reaction, vanadium is almost completely depleted in the mixture of elements for OER, while its concentration at the HER catalyst is similar or even higher after the reaction. For the OER catalyst, the depletion of vanadium might lead to the formation of pores, which could be correlated with the activity enhancement. The developed catalyst is integrated into PV-EC devices, coupled with different types of silicon PV. An average solar to hydrogen efficiency of 13.3% (9.6 cm(2) PV aperture area) is achieved with a shingled module consisting of three laterally series-connected silicon heterojunction solar cells.									10	1	0	0	0	0	11			2365-709X			WOS:000588665700001

Temporal evolutions of species were captured reasonably during the processes of thermal decomposition. The effects of oxygen content, temperature and heating rate were also analysed. In addition, the kinetic properties were predicted with reliable parameters. The results show good agreements with the available ones, which illustrate that the species with two carbon atoms are the vast majority of final products. Higher oxygen content and temperature promote the generation of small molecules with carbon atom number less than or equal to 10. In the presence of oxygen, greater activation energy span and reaction order are calculated with lower adjust R-2, which indicates complex reactions according to kinetic analysis. The initial decomposition temperature of PE is proportional to the heating rate owing to heat transfer lag.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0892-7022	1029-0435		WOS:000434194300002

Herein, a strategy is developed to fabricate freestanding bifunctional electrodes from the predeposited nickel nanoparticles (Ni-NCNT) on carbon fiber paper. The steric effect of monodispersed SiO(2)nanospheres limits the configuration of carbon atoms forming 3D interconnected nanotubes with uniformly distributed NiN(2)active sites. The bifunctional electrodes (Ni-NCNT) demonstrate ideal ORR and OER properties. The zinc-air batteries assembled with Ni-NCNT directly exhibit extremely outstanding long term stability (2250 cycles with 10 mA cm(-2)charge/discharge current density) along with high power density of 120 mV cm(-2)and specific capacity of 834.1 mA h g(-1).

Plasma treatment is a helpful way to preserve the uniformity of metal sites in the open framework of Prussian blue analogue (PBA) with highly active OER activity. Herein, we integrate the notable ORR performance of N-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNT) with oxygen-plasma activated NiFe PBA (O-PBA), which serves as an active OER catalyst, to realize the bifunctionality of the oxygen conversion reaction. Integrating N-CNT with O-NiFe PBA frameworks provides the individual active sites for ORR and OER with a stable performance. OER performance of O-PBA/N-CNT exhibited an overpotential of 280 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2), outperforming the commercial RuO2 due to the activated metal site of O-PBA anchored in conductive N-CNT. Even after the plasma treatment, the N-CNT still had its electrocatalytic ability to improve the ORR performance, and the structure of NiFe PBA was still maintained. The combined benefits of dual active electrocatalytic sites of O-PBA/N-CNT produced a low potential gap at the value of 0.83 V in the OER/ORR polarization curve, which also exhibited stable charge-discharge performance for 45 h with a negligible potential gap of 0.70 V in RZAB application. This study presents the exploration of producing a facile synthesis of a dual active oxygen transformation electrocatalyst by utilizing the combination of surface engineering between surface doping and plasma activation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000831534100001

Among all the metal oxides, Co3O4 spinel exhibits a high activity as an oxygen evolution catalyst. In this paper, we demonstrate that the photocatalytic oxygen evolution activity of Co3O4 spinel can be further enhanced by substituting cobalt with manganese in the spinel structure. Using a facile hydrothermal approach, we have successfully synthesized pure, Mn-substituted, and Ni-substituted Co3O4 nanopartides with a typical particle size of 5-7 nm. The morphologies and crystal structures of the as-synthesized nanoparticle catalysts have been carefully examined using various structural characterization techniques, including PXRD, TEM, gas adsorption, and XAS. The photocatalytic activities of as-made nanoparticles have been investigated using a well-studied visible light driven [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+)-persulfate system. In both Clark electrode and reactor/GC systems, Mn-substituted Co3O4 nanoparticles exhibited the highest TOF among all the three catalysts. The data presented in this paper suggest that the photocatalytic water oxidation activity of Co3O4 spinel catalyst could be further enhanced by Mn3.1+ substitution at the octahedral sites.

The development of highly efficient, low-cost, durable, and sustainable electrocatalysts is required for these three crucial electrochemical reactions. Herein, an effective tri-functional electrocatalyst, Co3O4 nanoparticle-modified N-doped hollow hierarchical porous carbon microtubes (Co3O4/ NCMTs), was successfully prepared via the pyrolysis of metal cobalt(II) complex willow catkin biomass under an argon-ammonia atmosphere. The obtained carbon materials inherit the original micron tubular structure of the willow catkin and form a hollow micro/mesoporous hierarchical construction. Ammonia can hugely elevate the content of doped nitrogen in the carbon skeleton. The doped N and Co3O4 nanoparticles contribute to form more active sites for the electrochemical reactions. When compared with the Pt/C catalyst, the Co3O4/NCMT-800 electrocatalyst with a positive onset potential (E-0 = 0.906 V) and half-wave potential (E-1/2 = 0.778 V) exhibit superior catalytic stability and tolerance to methanol in the ORR. The optimal Co3O4/NCMT-800 material exhibit high activity with a low overpotential of 0.35 V for the OER and 0.21 V for the HER to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The enhanced OER and HER performance of the Co3O4/NCMTs contribute to improve the overall water splitting ability. The excellent tri-functional electrocatalytic activity can be ascribed to the doped N and Co3O4 nanoparticles loaded into the hollow hierarchical porous carbon microtubes that accelerate electron transport and enhance charge delocalization. Due to the abundant biomass precursor with a unique structure, the advanced non-noble metal-doped hollow porous carbon materials exhibit outstanding application prospects in the electrocatalysis field.									77	7	0	0	5	0	78			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000412781700010

When operating in a potential range of water decomposition, strongly oxidising hydroxyl radicals are formed while oxygen evolution is minimised. The majority of research studies undertaken to-date have focused on the application of BDDs for the remediation of wastewater contaminants, however there is an increasing need for a suitable technology to address recalcitrant micropollutants in a drinking water context. Pesticide micropollutants are widely detected in surface- and ground-waters and are of increasing concern. In this paper, the treatment of pesticides by BDD electro-oxidation is reviewed. Their degradation and mineralisation, as well as the effect of operating conditions, formation of intermediate by-products, reaction pathways and kinetics are summarized. In general, BDD electro-oxidation was found to be effective for the degradation of pesticides with the degradation performance proportional to the electrolytic current, due principally to the increased generation of (OH)-O-center dot radicals. Most contaminants followed pseudo first-order reaction kinetics under mass transport limitations. Generally, the same aromatic and aliphatic by-products were formed through similar oxidation pathways. Finally, research gaps and potential future research topics are discussed.									47	0	0	0	12	1	47			2053-1400	2053-1419		WOS:000513135200003

The classic design principle for an oxide electrocatalyst believes that point defect engineering, such as oxygen vacancies (VO..) or heteroatom doping, offers the opportunities to manipulate the electronic structure of material toward optimal OER activity. Oppositely, in this work, we discover a counterintuitive phenomenon that both VO.. and an aliovalent dopant (i.e., proton (H+)) in perovskite nickelate (i.e., NdNiO3 (NNO)) have a considerably detrimental effect on intrinsic OER performance. Detailed characterizations unveil that the introduction of these point defects leads to a decrease in the oxidative state of Ni and weakens Ni-O orbital hybridization, which triggers the local electron-electron correlation and a more insulating state. Evidenced by first-principles calculation using the density functional theory (DFT) method, the OER on nickelate electrocatalysts follows the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM). The incorporation of point defect increases the energy barrier of transformation from OO*(VO) to OH*(VO) intermediates, which is regarded as the rate-determining step (RDS). This work offers a new and significant perspective of the role that lattice defects play in the OER process.									5	0	0	0	0	0	4			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000659315800050	34002602

Herein, we synthesized Cu2S/Ni3S2 catalysts on nickel foam (NF) with different molar ratios of Ni/Cu by a simple two-step hydrothermal method. Cu2S/Ni3S2-0.5@NF (CS/NS-0.5@NF) effectively reduces the overpotential of OER, displaying small overpotentials (237 mV@100 mA cm(-2) and 280 mV@500 mA cm(-2)) in an alkaline solution, along with a low Tafel slope of 44 mV dec CS/NS-0.5@NF also presents an excellent durability at a relatively high current density of 100 mA cm(-2) for 100 h. The excellent performance is benefited by the prominent structural advantages and desirable compositions. The nanosheet has a high electrochemical active surface area and the porous structure is conducive to electrolyte penetration and product release.

Herein, a facile thermal transformation strategy was developed to synthesize nickel iron phosphate nanoparticles incorporated in N-doped carbon (NiFeP/N-C) nanoflakes as highly efficient OER electrocatalysts based on a metal organophosphonate precursor. The amino trismethylene phosphonic acid ligand used here has excellent affinity toward various metals and thus can act as a P, C, and N source on a molecular scale, which simplifies the synthesis of conductive material-supported multi-metal phosphates. Benefiting from the derived N-doped carbon and the synergistic effect of bimetal ions, the sample denoted NiFeP/N-C-700 exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity.

Herein, we report an efficient solution method for a new class of three-dimensional (3D) Ir superstructure that consists of ultrathin Ir nanosheets as subunits. Electrochemical studies show that it delivers the excellent electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline condition with an onset potential at 1.43 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a very low Tafel slope of 32.7 mV decade(-1). In particular, it even shows superior performance for OER in acidic solutions with the low onset overpotential of 1.45 V versus RHE and small Tafel slope of 40.8 mV decade(-1), which are much better than those of small Ir nanoparticles (NPs). The 3D Ir superstructures also exhibit good stability under acidic condition with the potential shift of less than 20 mV after 8 h i-t test.

The heat capacity and the heat transfer coefficient are experimentally obtained. The quasi-steady state characteristics of the cell at constant charging current are measured. The experimental data show that, when operating in recombination regime, the stationary cell temperature is a linear function of the charging current. When the cell is gassing, part of the heat is dissipated with the released gases, as a result of which the cell temperature is lower than predicted from the linear temperature/current dependence. Introduced dimensionless slope of the temperature/current dependence is a characteristic of the VRLA battery, which could be used for fast and easy estimation of the temperature increase of the battery. The kinetic parameters of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) proceeding at the positive plates of VRLA cells are experimentally determined. The current/overpotential dependence of the OER obeys the Tafel relation. The temperature/current dependence and the kinetics of the OER are used to estimate the critical charging voltage for safe operation of the battery. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, while SACs with various coordination environment have become experimentally feasible, knowledge about the structure-performance relationship of SACs is still very limited, especially for the emerging multiple p-block element-doped SACs substrates. Herein, by adjusting the coordination environment of single-atom iron catalysts, 122 SACs with various substrates were designed for comprehensive analysis. Through spin-polarized density functional theory calculations with van der Waals corrections, 52 stable single-atom iron catalysts were identified. To analyze their OER performance, an OER volcano activity model was derived to predict their performance as the function of O* and HO* binding free energies. Interestingly, a Fe1B1C1N2-pen structure was found to have an outstanding OER activity (with a theoretical overpotential of 0.40 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) due to its unique adsorption mode that strengthens HO-bonding by forming the Fe-OH-B bond. Based on these results, the OER performance of 26 TM1/B1C1N2-pen (TM=Ti-Zn, Zr-Cd, and Hf-Au) SACs were determined based on this unique coordination environment by B-doping. Most importantly, this study shows that the OER performance of SACs can be significantly improved by tuning the coordination environment of an active metal center.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000872148500001

In this work, self-assembled cobalt oxide (Co3O4) and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles on thermally reduced graphene oxide (TRGO) were successfully synthesized via simple chemical wet, sol-gel, and thermal routes as highly efficient electrocatalysts for the OER in acidic media. The synthesized TRGO@ZnO/ Co3O4 catalyst presents improved OER performance, owing to the TRGO, which acted as a conducting support in the synthesized catalyst. The catalyst exhibited a low ovepotential of 160 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 50 mV dec(-1), which is much smaller than that of pristine Co3O4 and TRGO. The specific activity and turnover frequency of the optimal catalyst at an overpotential of 400 mV were 0.334 mA cm(-2) and 2.891 s(-1), respectively, which are considerably higher than those of pristine Co3O4 (0.102 mA cm(-2), 0.088 s(-1)) and ZnO/Co3O4 (0.063 mA cm(-2), 0.109 s(-1)). In addition, it exhibited excellent stability and initial catalytic activity remained at 89% after a long time of 50 h at 10 mA cm(-2) with faradaic efficiency of 95.34%. Thus, the synthesized TRGO@ZnO/Co3O4 catalyst material can be a promising candidate material to replace the expensive noble metal as an OER catalyst.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0020-1693	1873-3255		WOS:000800172300002

With the increasing urea concentration, the cobalt hydroxide carbonate precursors transformed from rods to sheets, and their crystal structures changed from orthorhombic to monoclinic. After the calcination process, the cobalt hydroxide carbonate converted to Co3O4 without obvious change of their morphology. Meanwhile, a large number of mesopores appeared in the Co3O4 nanostructures. Of the three morphologies, analysis of catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) demonstrated that the Co3O4 nanosheets exhibited highest current density and lowest over potential. The superior electrochemical performance of Co3O4 nanosheets might be attributed to their high surface areas and porous structure, which could efficiently accelerate electron transport and improve the catalytic activity for OER in alkaline solution.

Moreover, single metal atoms embedded in a two-dimensional material substrate have emerged as outstanding catalysts. Owing to its large surface area and novel electronic properties, graphyne (GY) is a promising substrate for the fabrication of single-atom catalysts (SACs). By doping foreign atoms of different types on GY, their local electronic/chemical environment and catalytic performance would be improved. Based on recent experimental advances, we used density functional theory (DFT) simulations to identify a suitable series of co-decorated GY materials, with boron-, nitrogen-, phosphorus-, and sulfur-doped GY (3B-GY, 3N-GY, 3P-GY, 3S-GY) as the two-dimensional substrate, and transition metal (TM) atoms (Sc to Zn) as the single-atom centers. Our screening process showed that Co@GY and Ni@3B-GY would be highly promising multifunctional electrocatalysts for HER/OER/ ORR. Then, we built quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) between electronic density of states (DOS) structure and catalytic performance using comparative DOS analysis (CoDOSA). The present results further support the development and application of d-band center theory. Our work identifies promising codecorated GY for HER/OER/ORR and provides quantitative information on their DOS.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000806956400001

Instead, it has been suggested that they may represent the result of a merger episode between a helium and a carbon-oxygen white dwarf. In this Letter, we present a nucleosynthesis study of the merger of a 0.4 M-circle dot helium white dwarf with a 0.8 M-circle dot carbon-oxygen white dwarf, by coupling the thermodynamic history of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics particles with a post-processing code.

J	Wang, Huan; Feng, Er-ming; Liu, Yan-ming; Zhang, Chun-yang								High-performance hierarchical ultrathin sheet-based CoOOH hollow nanospheres with rich oxygen vacancies for the oxygen evolution reaction								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				7	13			7777	7783		10.1039/c9ta00878k				APR 7 2019	2019	The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key process in water splitting, rechargeable metal-air batteries and fuel cells, and the design of highly efficient, stable and non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts for the OER remains a great challenge so far. Here, we report the rational design and synthesis of hierarchical ultrathin nanosheet-based CoOOH hollow nanospheres with rich oxygen vacancies using a room-temperature self-template strategy with organic-inorganic hybrid Pi-Co-glycerate hollow nanospheres as the templates. The anions (H2PO2-) in the templates enable the proceeding of anion-exchange reaction at room temperature, and the resultant unique structural features (i.e., ultrathin thickness, rich oxygen vacancies and central void space) endow the CoOOH hollow nanospheres with excellent performance in the electrocatalytic OER. The obtained CoOOH hollow nanospheres exhibit a Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1) and a low overpotential of 275 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), superior to the -CoOOH nanosheets with an overpotential of 304 mV and the bare Ni foam with an overpotential of 362 mV at the same current density. Importantly, these CoOOH hollow nanospheres possess the lowest overpotential of 340 mV at the current density of 200 mA cm(-2) among the reported Co-based nanomaterials (370-770 mV). This research proposes a new chemical conversion mechanism and provides a new approach for the fabrication of hollow nanomaterials at room temperature, facilitating the development of efficient OER catalysts.									56	3	0	0	3	0	57			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463819400049

Ruthenium complexes with terpyridine (tpy) and bipyridine (bpy) as ligands are considered to be an important catalyst for OER electrocatalysis. Their catalytic performance is affected by substituent groups of the tpy (and bpy) ligands, and is often limited by low current density. Here, we report a Ru-polypyridine complex covalently anchored to single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) via a tpy ligand to form a hybrid material of SWCNT-tpyRubpy. Electrocatalytic OER studies have shown that the covalent attachment of the Ru-polypyridine complexes to SWCNTs avoids noticeable molecular aggregations and increases the conductivity. Compared with that of the SWCNT-unattached complex, SWCNT-tpyRubpy exhibits a higher electrocatalytic OER activity with a low onset potential of 1.48 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) and a smaller Tafel slope of 109 mV dec(-1) in alkaline solution. Therefore, the CNT-hybridization is an effective method for the construction of advanced SWCNT-based Ru complex electrocatalysts and to understand their catalytic performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000707501000001

Here, we report a simple one-step: synthesis of a three-dimensional (3D) carbon-coated Ni8P3 nanosheet array as bifunctional catalyst for both hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER). The nanosheet array, ossesses low overpotentials, high current densities, and small Tafel slopes in both HER and OER and shows high electrocatalytic activities and long-term stability. The carbon layer with high electric conductivity serves not only as a protective layer to prevent Ni8P3 dissolution but also as an active layer to decrease the electrocatalysis overpotential. The nanosheet array has HER outstanding activity in both acid and alkaline media. Its superior performance in OER can be due to the synergistic interaction at the Ni8P3/NiOx heterojunction. Furthermore, cell voltage as low as 1.65 V can achieve 10 mA cm(-2) current density for full water splitting in an alkaline water electrolyzer, indicating potential application of C@ Ni8P3 as bifunctional catalyst for clean and renewable energy utilization.									90	7	0	0	2	0	90			1944-8244			WOS:000385992400049	27696849	
J	Park, Kyoung-Won; Kolpak, Alexie M.				Park, Kyoung-Won/AAL-8877-2020				Mechanism for spontaneous oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions on CoO nanoparticles								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				7	12			6708	6719		10.1039/c8ta11087e				MAR 28 2019	2019	Overall photocatalytic water splitting with a high efficiency of approximate to 5% has recently been observed for CoO nanoparticle suspensions in the absence of an applied bias or co-catalyst. Although experimental measurements indicate that the overall photocatalytic water splitting is caused by optimal band edge alignments with respect to the redox potentials of water, the mechanism by which H-2 and O-2 simultaneously evolve on these nanoparticles is unknown. In this study, we used first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the mechanisms for the charge separation and H-2 and O-2 evolution on CoO nanoparticles under illumination in aqueous solution. We demonstrated that electrons are driven to the CoO(100) facet and holes are driven to the hydroxylated CoO(111) facet (OH*-CoO(111)) as a result of the built-in potential arising from the difference in the band edge positions on the two facets. Furthermore, based on a set of criteria, depending on if the photoexcited electrons and holes have sufficient energy to overcome the kinetic barrier along the H-2 and O-2 evolution reaction pathways, respectively, on the relevant surface facet, we show that H-2 evolution preferentially occurs on the CoO(100) facet, while O-2 evolution occurs on the OH*-CoO(111) surface. Our understanding of the overall water splitting mechanism on CoO nanoparticles provides a general explanation for the experimentally observed overall water splitting phenomena on a variety of self-standing photocatalysts, including -Ga2O3, Cu2O, and KTaO3, without an external driving potential or co-catalyst. In addition, we provide a new strategy for designing novel photocatalysts with high efficiency by controlling their surface configurations and morphologies.									20	2	0	0	1	0	20			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463814800008

Based on this, how to improve the catalytic activity of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) becomes self-evident. Currently, single atom catalysts (SACs) are widely used as structural design models for the OER, ORR and HER because of the single active site and maximum metal atom utilization, but significant challenges remain. Herein, the catalytic properties of the OER, ORR and HER with a single metal atom as the active site are discussed through first-principles calculations by introducing a single metal atom in the Mn vacancy of Mn2B2 (TM@Mn2B2, TM = Au, Ag, Co, Cd, Cu, Ir, Pd, Ni, Rh, Ru and Pt). The results show that Ni@Mn2B2 is suitable as a dual-function electrocatalyst for the OER/ORR with overpotentials of 0.38 V and 0.37 V, which are lower than those of the OER overpotential of RuO2/IrO2 (0.42 V/0.56 V) and the ORR overpotential of Pt (0.45 V). Meanwhile, Pt@Mn2B2 is available as an OER/HER dual-function electrocatalyst for overall water splitting with a lower overpotential of OER (0.45 V) and lower |Delta G(H)| (-0.15eV) under 1/4 hydrogen coverage for the HER. This work proposes a practical strategy for developing single metal atom doped MBene as a dual-function electrocatalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000843709700001	36000359

The O-uptake curves, which were determined from the evolution of the O-1s peaks, indicate that simple Langmuir type kinetics can describe dissociative adsorption of O-2 with an incident energy (E-i) below 0.5 eV under Theta <= 0.5 ML. The reaction order dependence oil E-i implies two competing dissociation mechanisms, trapping-mediated and directly activated adsorption. Oxidation at Theta <= 0.5 ML proceeds rather effectively using highly energetic HOMB at E-i >= 1.0 eV. The azimuthal dependence of the sticking probability during the effective oxidation using HOMB incidence Suggests that the added rows, which consist of the Cu-O structure, shade the reactive hollow sites in the trough where oxygen penetrates into the subsurface. The surface Cu-2 formed with highly energetic HOMB incidence decomposes with desorbing subsurface oxygen even at room temperature, demonstrating that HOMB can induce a metastable surface Structure that cannot be produced in the thermal equilibrium process.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1089-5639			WOS:000273263700128	19810738

However, the sluggish kinetics of electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the prohibitive cost, low reserves and easy oxidation of noble metal-based electrocatalysts force researchers to explore efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts. Bimetal nanostructred materials are proved to have enhanced OER catalytic performances. In this study, a series of bimetallic metal-organic frameworks (Fe/Ni-MOFs) are prepared by a solvothermal method. The prepared MOFs present abundant unsaturated metal active sites for OER. The optimized Fe/Ni bimetal-MOF has low overpotentials of 236 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 284 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) for OER In addition, in comparison with most of the previously reported OER electrocatalysts, the present MOF shows a lower Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1). Besides, the MOF catalyst exhibits high electrochemical stability and the OER activity shows a negligible change after stability test for 15 h and 10,000 voltammetric cycles. Meanwhile, the Fe-doped Ni-MOFs show faster catalytic kinetics and higher conductivity than the monometallic Ni-MOF. This work paves a way to exploit bi- or multi-metallic MOFs with high conductivities and electrocatalytic performances for electrochemical energy conversion. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

As a result, the development of highly efficient catalysts for the OER has become an area of intense research. With the advantages of low cost and high efficiency, copper (Cu)-based materials are competitive candidates owing to their excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability with a relatively lower overpotential to achieve a corresponding current density. Varieties of synthetic methods including hydrothermal/solvothermal methods, electrodeposition, spray pyrolysis, the solegel method, and so on have been successfully applied to prepare Cu-based materials. This review is generally focused on recent progress with respect to Cu-based materials applied as electrocatalysts to the OER. Moreover, the Cu-based materials are introduced via synthesis methods and the electrochemical performances of the electrode materials. Although there is still much room for further improvement, much progress has been made with Cu-based materials as electrocatalysts. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Here an exciting methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) to formic acid in acidic media is achieved on CeO2/RuO2. The reaction contributes to a reaction potential as low as 1.195 V in half cell and a cell voltage reduction to 1.308 V in full cell when paralleling with Pt/C cathode at 10 mA cm(-2), about 300 mV and 260 mV lower to the ordinary OER and overall water splitting by using pure RuO2, respectively. The production of formic acid reaches to a selectivity above 50% in a wide potential window with a top partial current density of formic acid up to 49.8 mA cm(-2) at 1.52 V. The results generally demonstrate a promising application of MOR on CeO2/RuO2 in the substitution for OER to achieve an energy-saving H-2 generation via acidic water splitting. Mechanism insights reveal that CeO2/RuO2 contains abundant oxygen vacancies and high-valence Ru species caused by the strong electronic interaction between the two subparts, which can greatly improve the water dissociation and the subsequent hydration of MOR intermediates, thereby favoring a non-CO pathway of MOR on CeO2/RuO2.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000833420400001

It is demonstrated that O atoms are generated in high concentration (similar to 5 x 10(17) cm(-3)) directly below the high-voltage anode in a point-to-plane geometry. The corresponding lifetimes in air were on the order of hundreds of microseconds. Fuel chemistry provides consumption pathways via chain branching reactions even without sustained combustion, and the corresponding O-atom lifetimes were much shorter than in air and dependent on the fuel concentration. At the richest conditions, corresponding to a fuel-air equivalence ratio of 2.4, O lifetimes were on the order a few microseconds or less.

Herein, 2D cobalt ion (Co2+) and benzimidazole (bIm) based zeolite-imidazole framework nanosheets, ZIF-9(III), are reported as exceptionally efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Specifically, liquid-phase ultrasonication is applied to exfoliate a [Co-4(bIm)(16)] zeolite-imidazole framework (ZIF), named as ZIF-9(III) phase, into nanoscale sheets. ZIF-9(III) is selectively prepared through simple mechanical grinding of cobalt nitrate and benzimidazole in the presence of a small amount of ethanol. The resultant exfoliated nanosheets exhibit significantly higher OER activity in alkaline conditions than the corresponding bulk phases ZIF-9 and ZIF-9(III). The electrochemical and physicochemical characterization data support the assignment of the OER activity of the exfoliated nanosheet derived material to nitrogen coordinated cobalt oxyhydroxide N4CoOOH sites, following a mechanism known for Co-porphyrin and related systems. Thus, exfoliated 2D nanosheets hold promise as potential alternatives to commercial noble metal electrocatalysts for the OER.									78	5	0	0	3	0	80			2198-3844			WOS:000451173200023	30479932

Herein, cobalt iron hydroxide nanosheets are directly deposited on nickel foam by a simple and rapid electrodeposition method. The cobalt iron hydroxide (CoFe/NF) nanosheets not only allow good exposure of the highly active surface area but also facilitate the mass and charge transport capability. As an anode, the CoFe/NF electrocatalyst displays excellent oxygen evolution reaction catalytic activity with an overpotential of 220 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). As a cathode, it exhibits good performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction with an overpotential of 110 mV, reaching a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). When CoFe/NF electrodes are used as the anode and the cathode for water splitting, a low cell voltage of 1.64 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent stability for 50 h are observed. The present work demonstrates a possible pathway to develop a highly active and durable substitute for noble metal electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									134	4	0	0	1	0	136			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000425147000011	29251422

Herein, the direct growth of misaligned and intertwined molybdenum selenide nanosheets surrounding nickel selenide sub-microislands on nickel foam (denoted as Mo-Ni-S-@NF) was demonstrated via a simple one-step hydrothermal approach. The as-prepared Mo-Ni-S-@NF demonstrates excellent electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline electrolyte, demanding a low overpotential of 113 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and a small Tafel slope of 85.7 mV dec(-1). It also displays good catalytic performance towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with an overpotential of 397 mV at the current density of 100 mA cm(-2), and a Tafel slope of 44.9 mV dec(-1). Moreover, when applied as both anode and cathode in a two-electrode electrolyzer for overall water splitting, low voltages of 1.583 and 2.098 V are allowed to reach the current densities of 20 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Large electrochemical surface area, low electron-transfer resistance, and good stability were demonstrated during the test. The superior activity of Mo-Ni-Se@NF is largely attributed to the seamless integration of the three-dimensional and conductive Ni foam substrate, the direct growth of molybdenum selenide nanosheets on Ni foam with sufficient active sites, and the metallic nickel selenide sub-microislands with good activity and electronic conductivity for the electrons transfer from the substrate to the active sites on molybdenum selenide nanosheets during electrocatalytic process. This work can inspire the optimal design of bimetal selenides on metal foam as efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Studies with a vitreous carbon rotating disk electrode were performed to determine the potential regions where the reactions take place and also to calculate the kinetic parameters under experimental conditions. Reproducible results were obtained only when a mercury film was deposited on the vitreous carbon surface prior to each experiment. Potentiodynamic polarizations were obtained from 5 x 10(-4) M Hg(II) solutions and different NaCl concentrations ranging from 1 M to 4 M, in the presence and absence of dissolved oxygen. The mercuric complex deposition and the oxygen reduction proceeded via mixed control within the first 50 mV overpotential, followed by a diffusion control. After -0.450 V vs see the H-2 evolution started. This reaction occurred at free vitreous carbon left between the liquid mercury droplets where the hydrogen overpotential is smaller. Kinetic parameters as well as the reaction rate expression for mercury deposition from its chloride complexes were obtained.

A series of electrocatalysis reactions, including oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), CO2 reduction reaction (CO2 RR), N-2 or nitrate reduction reaction (NRR or NOxRR), and methanol or ethanol oxidation reaction (MOR or EOR), have become promising ways to solve these serious issues and realize sustainable development. However, the limited understanding of the dynamic process of electrocatalysis still hinders the rational design of these electrocatalysts. Combining infrared spectroscopy with electrocatalysis, in situ electrochemical infrared spectroscopy (in situ EIRS) is a mighty tool to acquire deep insight of dynamic electrocatalytic reaction process at molecule level. Moreover, the surface sensitive in situ EIRS could acquire information about the adsorbates and the key intermediate, making it broad prospects in the study of electrocatalytic dynamic process. In this short review, we summarize recent progress of in situ EIRS with the focus of probing dynamic reactions. In particular, we first briefly introduce the fundamental and the methodological development of in situ EIRS. Then, the recent advances of in situ EIRS applications in electrocatalytic reaction is demonstrated, including OER, HER, CO2RR, NRR, and MOR. Finally, challenges and perspectives of future research in related fields are discussed.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000719766300002

The effect of UV-B treatment on primary photosynthetic reactions - energy interaction between the main pigment-protein complexes and oxygen evolution, was evaluated at low (4 degrees C) and at room (22 degrees C) temperature. UV-B-induced alterations of investigated photosynthetic reactions are better expressed at 22 degrees C than at 4 degrees C for Cvi. For Te ecotype the energy interaction was suppressed to higher extent at 22 degrees C, while oxygen evolving activity was affected similarly at both temperatures. At low and room temperature, the energy interaction in the complex PSII-core antenna is affected stronger by UV-B treatment than the energy distribution between both photosystems, as revealed by fluorescence ratios of 77 K spectra. The results presented indicate that the Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Cvi (Cape Verde Islands) is less affected by UV-B irradiation in respect to the investigated primary photosynthetic reactions than the ecotype Te (Finland).									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1310-1331			WOS:000322100100009

Compared to the well-known metal hydroxides or (oxyhydr)oxides with lamellar structure, delafossites (ABO(2)) are characterized by alternating layers of A cations and edge-sharing BO2 octahedra, but are rarely used in OER due to their poor electron conductivity and intrinsic activity. Here, we propose a delafossite analog by mutation of metal oxyhydroxide and delafossite based on first-principles calculations. Modulation on the electronic structure due to distortion of the original crystal field of the BO2 layers is calculated to enhance electron conductivity and catalytic activity. Inspired by the theoretical design, we have experimentally realized the delafossite analog by electrochemical self-reconstruction (ECSR). Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy and other experimental techniques reveal the formation of delafossite analog with Ag intercalated into bimetallic cobalt-iron (oxyhydr) oxide layers from a metastable precursor through amorphization. Benefirting from the featured local electronic and geometric structures, the delafossite analog shows superior OER activity, affording a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) at an overpotential of 187 mV and an excellent stability (300 h) in alkaline conditions.									38	3	0	0	2	0	38			0027-8424			WOS:000572967300016	32848064

We report the solution synthesis, structural/compositional characterization, and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic properties of similar to 2-3 nm thick films of NiOx, CoOx, NiyCo1-yOx, Ni0.9Fe0.1Ox, IrOx, MnOx, and FeOx. The thin-film geometry enables the use of quartz crystal microgravimetry, voltammetry, and steady-state Tafel measurements to study the electrocatalytic activity and electrochemical properties of the oxides. Ni0.9Fe0.1Ox was found to be the most active water oxidation catalyst in basic media, passing 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 336 mV with a Tafel slope of 30 mV dec(-1) with oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity roughly an order of magnitude higher than IrOx control films and similar to the best known OER catalysts in basic media. The high activity is attributed to the in situ formation of layered Ni0.9Fe0.1OOH oxyhydroxide species with nearly every Ni atom electrochemically active. In contrast to previous reports that showed synergy between Co and Ni oxides for OER catalysis, NiyCo1-yOx thin films showed decreasing activity relative to the pure NiOx films with increasing Co content. This finding is explained by the suppressed in situ formation of the active layered oxyhydroxide with increasing Co. The high OER activity and simple synthesis make these Ni-based catalyst thin films useful for incorporating with semiconductor photoelectrodes for direct solar-driven water splitting or in high-surface-area electrodes for water electrolysis.									1188	34	0	0	84	0	1197			0002-7863			WOS:000309854700051	22991896

Herein, well-defined bimetallic CoFe alloyed nanocrystals wrapped in nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon nanocubes (CoFe@N-GCNCs-700) are synthesized by pyrolysis of CoFe-based Prussian blue analogue nanocubes@phenolic resin. The resulting CoFe@N-GCNCs-700, as an advanced trifunctional catalyst, exhibits prominent electrocatalytic behaviors for ORR (0.802 V of half-wave potential), OER (273 mV of overpotential at 10 mA cm-2) and HER (91.5 mV of overpotential at 10 mA cm-2) in the alkaline solution. Furthermore, its practicability is further exploited by overall water splitting. The output voltage of only 1.63 V is demanded to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2. Besides, the CoFe@N-GCNCs-700 based rechargeable Zn-air batteries exhibit large peak power density (132.5 mW cm-2) and superior cycling stability (100 h without evident degeneration). This research offers some new prospects in fabrication of highly effective multifunctional catalysts for electrochemical energy applications.									33	0	0	0	2	0	33			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000593855200005

Their performance in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) covered a wide range and their sequence of increasing activity differed when electrocatalysis in alkaline electrolyte and chemical water oxidation using Ce(4+)were compared. The decisive factors that explain this difference were identified in the catalysts' microstructure. Chemical water oxidation activity is substantially governed by the exposed surface area, while the electrocatalytic activity is determined largely by the electric conductivity, which was found to correlate with the particle morphology in terms of needle length and aspect ratio in this sample series. This correlation is rather explained by an improved conductivity due to longer needles than by structure sensitivity as was supported by reference experiments using H(2)O(2)decomposition and carbon black as additive. The most active catalyst R-cryptomelane reached a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)at a potential 1.73 V without, and at 1.71 V in the presence of carbon black. The improvement was significantly higher for the catalyst with lower initial activity. However, the materials showed a disappointing catalytic stability during alkaline electrochemical OER, whereas the crystal structure was found to be stable at working conditions.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000565707500001	32159252

This work draws inspiration from stainless metals to synthesize highly anticorrosive amorphous Ni-P via electroless deposition. Holly leaves with three-dimensional micro/nanoarchitecture were firstly calcined at 800 degrees C in nitrogen to obtain self-supporting biocarbon as the substrate for eletroless deposition. After depositing Ni-P for 30 min, the as-obtained Ni-P/carbonized leaf (Ni-P/CL) composite showed an excellent electrocatalytic performance for the OER. Benefiting from the high electronic conductivity and catalytic activity of Ni-P, and the efficient mass transport behavior in the three-dimensional architecture, a low overpotential of 300 mV was required to reach a current density of 40 mA cm(-2). The anticorrosive amorphous and P-doping feature of Ni-P can prevent catalytic active species from leaching out; and to some extent, can protect the biocarbon substrate from corrosion during the OER process. The current retained 85.7 % of the initial value after performing at 1.6 V (vs. RHE) for 12 h.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			2196-0216			WOS:000475465600013

Texture coefficient, over-potential, q*, Q(dl) and R-ct deduced the influences of heat treatments on the electrocatalytic performance. The anode with its substrate treated by recrystallization annealing Ti substrate has the highest preferred orientation of the close-packed (101) plane and q* and Q(dl) value and the lowest R-ct value, so it owns more stable porous structure and better electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction.

The effect of the surface oxygen vacancy layer of BCN-TiO2 binary heterostructures on the charge carrier transfer and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution was thoroughly investigated. UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra results reveal that the surface oxygen vacancy can extend the light absorption from the UV to the visible-light region for BCN-TiO2 binary heterostructures. The steady-state/time-resolved photoluminescence spectra exhibit an increased charge carrier lifetime, improved charge carrier separation efficiency and strengthened direct Z-scheme charge transfer process for BCN-TiO2-x heterostructures. As expected, the BCN-TiO2-x heterostructures exhibited a higher visible-light photocatalytic efficiency, about 7 and 11 times higher than that of the pure TiO2 and BCN samples. Namely, the photocatalytic activity of hydrogen evolution can be greatly promoted by constructing the surface oxygen vacancy layer. This work provides a new pathway to construct an efficient contact layer for the direct Z-scheme system to improve the charge carrier separation and transfer and thereby improve the photocatalytic activity.									22	2	0	0	2	0	23			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000438934700020

Herein, we design and synthesize, for the first time, a novel cost-efficient electrocatalyst, i.e., hierarchical yolk-shell Ni2P/ZnP2 hollow microspheres (NZP HMSs), via a two-step strategy involving a solvothermal process and subsequent phosphatization. When utilized as a promising electrocatalyst for the OER, the yolk-shell NZP HMS specimen exhibits more exceptional OER performances than its solid Ni2P counterpart, including a lower overpotential of 210 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a smaller Tafel slope of 57.8 mV dec(-1) and more superior electrochemical stability in 1 M KOH. The superb electrocatalytic OER properties are attributed to the synergistic contributions from the Ni2P/ZnP2 hetero-interface at the nanoscale, favorable electronic conductivity and high electroactive surface area. More significantly, we strongly envision that this simple synthetic methodology can be highly versatile for other hierarchical yolk-shell hollow phosphides towards the OER and beyond.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23				2052-1537		WOS:000534239200024

Herein, the authors report a bifunctional electrocatalyst composed of hollow CoSx and Ni-Fe based layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) nanosheets for efficient overall water splitting (OWS). The optimized heterostructure is obtained by the electrodeposition of NiFe LDH nanosheets on metal-organic framework-derived hollow CoSx nanoarrays, which are supported on nickel foam (H-CoSx@NiFe LDH/NF). The unique structure of the hybrid material not only provides ample active sites, but also facilitates electrolyte penetration and gas release during the reactions. Additionally, the strong coupling and synergy between the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) active CoSx and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) active NiFe LDH gives rise to the excellent bifunctional properties. Consequently, H-CoSx@NiFe LDH/NF exhibits remarkable HER and OER activities with overpotentials of 95 and 250 mV, respectively at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. Even at 1.0 A cm(-2), the electrode requires small overpotentials of 375 mV (for HER) and 418 mV (for OER), respectively.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which occurs at an anode during the process, requires efficient electrocatalysts to reduce activation energies. Although Ru- or Ir-containing materials show excellent electrocatalytic activities, their high cost is a critical drawback. Consequently, the development of efficient electrocatalysts composed of low-cost metal components is a great challenge. In this study, we develop a new route to produce a hybrid material (Fe-NC) containing Fe3C particles dispersed on the surface of N-doped carbon (NC) materials by heat treatment of a mixture of urea and Fe(II)Cl-2(H2O)(4). Microscopic analyses prove that the Fe3C particles are placed on the surfaces of thin NC materials. Additionally, various characterizations reveal that the particles contain Fe3C structure. Fe-NC shows good electrocatalytic properties with onset and overpotentials of 1.57 V and 545 mV, respectively, for OER in KOH electrolyte. This study suggests the possibility of the use of Fe3C-based composites as OER electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1976-4251	2233-4998		WOS:000759015600002

The generation of highly active electrocatalysts for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) requires the rational design of a precatalyst that can enhance the number density of the active catalyst generated during water splitting. In this work, we report sulfurincorporated iron-doped cobalt silicate (CoFeSiO-S) nanoparticles, which exhibit a unique ability to show gradual improvement in the electrocatalytic behavior with time. The precatalyst could reach a low overpotential of 267 +/- 6 mV at benchmark current density of 10 mA/cm(2) and 300 mV at 100 mA/cm(2) current density after applying chronopotentiometry for 30 h. The exceptional OER performance is further evidence by a low Tafel slope of 37.0 +/- 0.5 mV/dec with a very high TOF value of 1.05 s(-1). This improved activity is attributed to 1) facilitation of Co2+/Co3+ by Fe doping, 2) faster catalyst activation due to lower metal-sulfur bond energy compared to metal-oxygen bond energy, 3) higher pore diameter that enables faster diffusion of reactants and products, 4) lower charge transfer resistance of sulfur incorporated iron-doped cobalt phyllosilicate than pristine, and 5) silicate anion etching in the electrolyte. This work establishes a fundamental understanding of the surface reconstruction occurring during the OER process where silicates are employed as precatalyst.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2196-0216			WOS:000736074300001

Combining diverse characterizations of the series of FeCoNi-CNTs revealed that multiple metal modes such as metallic species (Fe, Co, and Ni), M-N, M-O, and FeCoNi alloy are coexisted and evenly distributed in the carbon matrix. The control experiments and DFT calculations verified integration of superior electrocatalytic abilities of these metal active sites and enhanced conductivity of multilayered CNTs endowed the developed electrocatalysts with outperformed catalytic properties. When used FeCoNi-CNTs-2 catalyst (gained by adding 0.2 g transition metal salts and calcined at 700 degrees C) as electrode, the assembling Zn-air battery (ZAB) delivered a stable open circuit potential of 1.49 V, a high power density of 210.5 mW cm(-2) and specific capacity of 815.5 mA h g(Zn)(-1) at 10 mA cm(-2). The ZAB performances were higher than most reported metal compound-based electrocatalysts.

Co3O4 based electrocatalysts have grabbed the attention of researchers due to their high catalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, a facile hydrothermal method was adopted as the fabrication technique of synthesizing Co3O4 and the as-prepared metal oxide nanocomposite was further devised by adding the appropriate amount of transition metal dopants to investigate their effect on the catalytic activity following their electrochemical behaviors. The synthesized transition metal doped metal oxides were systematically characterized by different techniques. The electrochemical studies were carried out and Co3O4 was found to exhibit a high OER activity in alkaline medium. With the further addition of dopants such as chromium, iron and nickel, the catalytic activity of Co3O4 was enhanced, and among them, the Cr-Co3O4 shows the best electrocatalytic activity followed by Ni-Co3O4, Fe-Co3O4 and Pure Co3O4.

The construction of interface and defects engineering is an effective strategy to obtain the optimal Delta G(H*). Ni3N exhibits poor HER activity due to its undesirable Delta G(H*). By cooperating with Nb2O5, the d-band center of Ni3N was reduced, improving its catalytic performance. The optimized Nb2O5-Ni3N displays an overpotential of 80 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and superior activity than the benchmark Pt/C catalyst when the current density is greater than 125 mA cm(-2). Experimental and density functional theory results demonstrate that the improved catalytic activity is because the electronic interaction between Ni and Nb changes the coordination numbers of these two atoms, resulting in oxygen vacancies at the interface. Under the synergistic effect of Nb2O5 and Ni3N, the catalyst exhibits optimal Delta G(H*) and water adsorption energy.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000639581300001

It is thus urgent to exploit cost-effective and durable electrocatalysts to perfect LOBs performance and promote their practical application. In this work, lattice-matching composites are synthesized based on homologous heterostructure (HHS) with hollow nanocage-like architecture. As expected, the unique architecture with built-in electric fields of NiS2/NiSe2 HHS enables the rapid transfer of electron/ions, favorable electrolyte permeation on the cathode surfaces, and provides sufficient active sites for oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction. Moreover, the constructs NiS2/NiSe2 HHS can evidently catalyze the formation of dispersed platelet-shape and fluffy film-like Li2O2 discharge products via the surface/solution routes due to the greatly reduced adsorption energy of the LiO2 intermediates on the built-in electric fields, while the NiS2 and NiSe2 counterparts induce the formation of Li2O2 films by the surface path, limiting its electrocatalytic activities. These results suggest that lattice-matching HHS engineering of cathode catalysts can be an effective approach to tuning the Li2O2 formation, which holds attractive and great application prospects in the development of high-performance LOBs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000874473600001

Herein, a novel wet chemical strategy is reported for the synthesis of an IrRuMn catalyst with a sphere structure and porous features. In the synthetic process, the combined use of citric acid and formamide is requisite for the formation of the sphere structure. This method leads to a favorable 3D IrRuMn sphere structure with many fully exposed active sites. Furthermore, an alloying noble metal, such as Ir or Ru, with the transition metal leads to enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The doping of a transition metal, such as Mn, is an interesting example, because it exhibits stability and activity in both acidic and alkaline media. For the OER, the IrRuMn sphere catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 260 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in strongly acidic 0.1 m HClO4, which is superior to that of a commercial IrO2/C catalyst. This approach provides a novel way to synthesize an Ir-based multimetallic spherical electrocatalyst, which exhibits exceptional efficiency for the acidic OER. It will pave the way for new approaches to the practical utilization of PEM electrolyzers.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000525803000001	32078744

Herein, electronic reconfiguration and introducing conductive carbon-based materials are simultaneously conducted to enhance the ZABs and SCs performance of Co2P. We develop a simple and efficient electrospinning technology followed by carbonization process to synthesize embedding Co2P nanoparticles in Cu doping carbon nanofibers (Cu-Co2P/CNFs). As a result, the 7% Cu-Co2P/CNFs presents high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity (half-wave potential of 0.792 V for ORR, an overpotential of 360 mV for OER). The ZABs exhibit a power density of 230 mW cm(-2) and excellent discharge-charge stability of 80 h. In addition, the 7% Cu-Co2P/CNFs show the specific capacitance of 558 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1). Moreover, the 7% Cu-Co2P/CNFs//CNFs asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled applying 7% Cu-Co2P/CNFs electrode and pure CNFs, which exhibits a high energy density (25.9 Wh kg(-1)), exceptional power density (217.5 kW kg(-1)) and excellent cycle stability (96.6% retention after 10 000 cycles).

However, application of the pristine Ni(OH)(2) is limited by the poor conductivity and low exposure of the active sites. Herein, a hemin@Ni(OH)(2) composite is prepared through a hydrothermal reaction. Heat treatment temperature proves to have a great influence on the electrocatalytic activity. In 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, the composite treated at 175 degrees C shows an overpotential of only 287 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA.cm(-2). Besides, the low Tafel slope (42 mV.dec(-1)) and superior stability (15 h at 10 mA.cm(-2)) also confirm the composite as an excellent OER electrocatalyst. The brilliant activity and stability toward OER can be attributed to the promoted coupling between Ni and Fe centers and the improved conductivity due to the 2D 18 p-electrons ring conjugate structure of hemin. Besides, effective hydrogen bonds between Ni(OH)(2) and hemin hinder the aggregation of Ni(OH)(2), which ensures the catalyst enormous accessible active sites. This work offers a new method for the modification of Ni(OH)(2) as OER electrocatalysts. And the application of hemin also serves as a successful case for the use of biomass materials in OER electrocatalysis. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

We report the synthesis of room temperature-stable metallic rutile VO2 (VO2 (R)) nanosheets by topochemically transforming liquid-phase exfoliated VSe2 in a reductive Ar-H2 atmosphere. The asproduced VO2 (R) represents an example of two-dimensional (2D) nonlayered materials, whose bulk counterparts do not have a layered structure composed by layers held together by van der Waals force or electrostatic forces between charged layers and counterbalancing ions amid them. By pretreating the VSe2 nanosheets by O-2 plasma, the resulting 2D VO2 (R) nanosheets exhibit a porous morphology that increases the material specific surface area while introducing defective sites. The assynthesized porous (holey)-VO2 (R) nanosheets are investigated as metallic catalysts for the water splitting reactions in both acidic and alkaline media, reaching a maximum mass activity of 972.3 A g(-1) at -0.300 V vs RHE for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 0.5 M H2SO4 (faradaic efficiency = 100%, overpotential for the HER at 10 mA cm(-2) = 0.184 V) and a mass activity (calculated for a non 100% faradaic efficiency) of 745.9 A g(-1) at +1.580 V vs RHE for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M KOH (overpotential for the OER at 10 mA cm(-2) = 0.209 V). By demonstrating proof-of-concept electrolyzers, our results show the possibility to synthesize special material phases through topochemical conversion of 2D materials for advanced energy-related applications.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000736824500001	34939404

Herein, we discovered that Mn doping has a promotional role in stabilizing nanocarbon catalysts for the ORR/OER in alkaline media. Stable nanocarbon composites are derived from an inexpensive carbon/nitrogen precursor (i.e., dicyandiamide) and quaternary FeCoNiMn alloy via a template-free carbonization process. In addition to FeCoNiMn metal alloys/oxides, the carbon composites comprise substantial carbon tube forests growing on a thick and dense graphitic substrate. The dense carbon substrate with high degree of graphitization results from Mn doping, while active nitrogen-doped carbon tubes stem from FeCoNi. Catalyst structures and performance are greatly dependent on the doping content of Mn. Various accelerated stress tests (AST) and life tests verify the encouraging ORR/ OER stability of the nanocarbon composite catalyst with optimal Mn doping. Extensive characterization before and after ASTs elucidates the mechanism of stability enhancement resulting from Mn doping, which is attributed to (i) hybrid carbon nanostructures with enhanced resistance to oxidation and (ii) the in situ formation of the beta-MnO2, and FeCoNi-based oxides capable of preventing carbon corrosion and promoting activity. Note that the improvement in stability due to Mn doping is accompanied by a slight activity loss due to a decrease in surface area. This work provides a strategy to stabilize carbon catalysts by appropriately integrating transition metals and engineering carbon structures.									101	9	0	0	3	0	100			2155-5435			WOS:000417230500044

These data strongly support the conclusion that this was indeed a 'neon' nova that occurred on an oxygen, neon, magnesium white dwarf. In addition, X-ray studies of its outburst imply that the mass of the white dwarf is about 1.25 M.. We, therefore, report on the results of new calculations of thermonuclear runaways on 1.25-M. oxygen, neon, magnesium white dwarfs, using our one-dimensional, fully implicit, hydrodynamic stellar evolution code that includes a large nuclear reaction network. We have updated the nuclear reaction network, with the inclusion of new and improved experimental and theoretical determinations of the nuclear reaction rates. We have also incorporated the OPAL carbon rich tables and have investigated the effects of changes in convective efficiency on the evolution. Our results show that the changes in the reaction rates and opacities that we have introduced produce important changes with respect to our previous studies. For example, relevant to nucleosynthesis considerations, a smaller amount of Al-26 is produced, while the abundances of P-31 and S-32 increase by factors of more than two. This change is attributed to the increased proton-capture reaction rates for some of the intermediate mass nuclei near 26Al and beyond, such that nuclear fusion to higher mass nuclei is enhanced. The characteristics of our models are then compared to observations of the outburst of V1974 Cyg 1992 and we find that the predicted amount of mass ejected is at least a factor of 10 less than observed. The low values for the amount of ejected mass are a consequence of the fact that the OPAL opacities are larger than those we previously used, which results in less mass being accreted on to the white dwarf. This is a general problem with respect to the comparison of observations and theory for ONeMg novae and we suggest a possible resolution of this discrepancy.									182	0	0	0	0	0	182			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000074003700006

The oxygen evolution photocatalyst BiVO4 was prepared by the microwave-assisted hydrothermal method. The method is fast and simple, as compared to conventional hydrothermal synthesis. The catalysts were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and UV-visible spectroscopy. The photocatalytic water splitting is investigated in (i) aqueous AgNO3 as sacrificial electron scavengers and (ii) a Z-scheme photocatalytic water splitting system. The BiVO4 photocatalysts prepared by the microwave-assisted hydrothermal method not only showed a very high oxygen evolution rate (2622 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) of water splitting reaction in an aqueous AgNO3 solution but also achieved a high H-2 evolution rate (340 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) and O-2 evolution rate (172 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) in a Z-scheme overall water splitting system.									27	0	0	0	2	0	27			2470-1343			WOS:000527748400024	32337456

MOF-derived semiconducting-metallic core-shell electrocatalyst Co3O4@Co/NCNT (NCNT = nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube), which was shown to catalyze oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), is also found to be an active electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a low overpotential of 171 mV. Here, the HER activity of Co3O4@Co/NCNT is presented and is shown as highly efficient and robust trifunctional electrocatalyst. The detailed theoretical calculation has found N-center of Co-N-4 moiety to be the H+ binding active site and thus proves Co3O4@Co/NCNT to be active for HER. Further, the ORR and OER bifunctionality of Co3O4@Co/NCNT helped in fabricating secondary Zn-air battery with high power density of 135 mW/cm(2). Also, an all-solid-state flexible and wearable battery with Co3O4@ Co/NCNT as cathode and electrodeposited Zn on carbon fiber cloth as anode was shown to withstand its performance even under stressed conditions. Finally, the material being trifunctional in nature was used both as an anode and cathode material for the electrolysis of water, which was powered by the Zn-air batteries with Co3O4@Co/NCNT as the cathode material. It is believed that the development of a trifunctional catalyst would help in wide commercialization of regenerative fuel cells.									34	1	0	0	0	0	34			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000518088800061	32052963

Herein, a nanohybrid, in which N,S-codoped carbon nanotubes were decorated with Co9S8 nanoparticles encapsulated in porous graphene layers, was fabricated by a one-step heat-treatment process. The N,S dopant species were the major active sites for the ORR, and Co9S8 nanoparticles were mainly responsible for the OER. Compared with commercial 20 wt % Pt/C and Ir/C electrocatalysts, this nanohybrid exhibited a comparable ORR half-wave potential (0.831 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) and OER potential (1.591 V at 10 mA cm(-2)), better long-term stability in an alkaline medium, and a narrower potential gap (0.76 V) between ORR and OER. Furthermore, as air electrode of the rechargeable zinc-air battery, it delivered a low charge-discharge voltage gap (0.65 V at 5 mA cm(-2)), high open-circuit potential (1.539 V), good specific capacity (805 mA h g-1Zn at 5 mA cm(-2)), and excellent cycling stability (48 h), superior to those of commercial Pt/C and Ir/C catalysts, and thus showed promise for applications in renewable energy conversion devices.									35	0	0	0	0	0	35			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000478633900022	30895738

Herein, an interface engineering coupled with shell-protection strategy was applied to construct three-dimensional (3D) core-shell NixSy@MnOxHy heterostructure nanorods grown on nickel foam (NixSy@MnOxHy/NF) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst. NixSy@MnOxHy/NF was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal reaction followed by an electrodeposition process. The X-ray absorption fine structure spectra reveal that abundant Mn-S bonds connect the heterostructure interfaces of NixSy@MnOxHy, leading to a strong electronic interaction, which improves the intrinsic activities of hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Besides, as an efficient protective shell, the MnOxHy dramatically inhibits the electrochemical corrosion of the electrocatalyst at high current densities, which remarkably enhances the stability at high potentials. Furthermore, the 3D nanorod structure not only exposes enriched active sites, but also accelerates the electrolyte diffusion and bubble desorption. Therefore, NixSy@MnOxHy/NF exhibits exceptional bifunctional activity and stability for overall water splitting, with low overpotentials of 326 and 356 mV for OER at 100 and 500 mA cm(-2), respectively, along with high stability of 150 h at 100 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, for overall water splitting, it presents a low cell voltage of 1.529 V at 10 mA cm(-2), accompanied by excellent stability at 100 mA cm(-2) for 100 h. This work sheds a light on exploring highly active and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts by the interface engineering coupled with shell-protection strategy.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000790259600003	35505126

Herein, we show for the first time that nickel can be extracted from NiFe-layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) to generate an Ni2P@FePOx heterostructure. The Ni2P@FePOx heterostructure was converted to an Ni2P@NiFe hydroxide heterostructure (P-NiFe) during water splitting, which displays high electrocatalytic performance for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1.0 M KOH solution, with an overpotential of 75 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for HER, and overpotentials of 205, 230 and 430 mV at 10, 100 and 1000 mA cm(-2) for OER, respectively. Moreover, it could afford a stable current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting at 1.51 V in 1.0 M KOH with long-term durability (100 h). This cell voltage is among the best reported values for bifunctional electrocatalysts. The results of theoretical calculations demonstrate that P-NiFe displays optimized adsorption energies for both HER and OER intermediates at the nickel active sites, thus dramatically enhancing its electrocatalytic activity.									199	14	0	0	9	0	200			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000424010600034	29675186

Aiming at this goal, hierarchical CoMoS3 nanotubes constructed of ultrathin nanosheet subunits are prepared via a self-sacrifice template method. The conversion from CoMoO4 nanorods to hierarchical MoCoS3 nanotubes is successfully realized through a facile solvothermal process. The obtained sample simultaneously possesses advanced structural superiority and synergism of ternary Co-Mo-S. Endowed with these advantages, MoCoS3 can serve as a pH-universal and high-performance electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution, delivering low onset overpotential, small overpotential required to generate current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and good stability. Moreover, it exhibits excellent catalytic performance in the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction, making it a promising dual-functional catalyst for water electrolysis.									72	3	0	0	0	0	72			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000402734600062

It significantly affects on residues upgrading and coke formation during slurry-phase hydrocracking. The structural and compositional evolution of TI were investigate in hydrocracking experiments with oil-soluble catalysts. Experiment results showed that the concentrations of TI after hydrocracked initially decreased and then increased as the increase of reaction temperature. And TI consisted organic aromatic compounds and inorganic species. At low temperatures, the TI evolution involved the thermal decomposition along with the elimination of heteroatoms groups. The Fe-1 S-x was formed by self-sulfurized from inorganic matters and was studied. At relatively high temperatures, the TI evolution included both mesophase and coke formation through the aromatic sheet stacking of rich-oxygen compounds. On the basis of experimental studies, the pathway of the TI evolution was proposed for slurry-phase hydrocracking. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The accumulation of gas bubbles on electrode surfaces prevents electrolyte access and passivates the electrochemically active surface area. Electrode morphologies are sought to assist in the removal of gas from surfaces to achieve higher reaction rates at operational voltages. Herein, regular arrays of linear ridges with specific microscale separations were systematically studied and correlated to the performance of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The dimensions of the linear ridges were proportional to the size of the oxygen bubbles, and the mass transfer processes associated with gas evolution at these ridges were monitored using a high-speed camera. Characterization of the adhered bubbles prior to detachment enabled the use of empirical methods to determine the volumetric flux of product gas and the bubble residence times. The linear ridges promoted a self-cleaning effect as one bubble would induce neighboring bubbles to simultaneously release from the electrode surfaces. The linear ridges also provided preferential bubble growth sites, which expedited the detachment of bubbles with similar diameters and shorter residence times. The linear ridges enhanced the OER in comparison to planar electrodes prepared by electrodeposition from the same high-purity nickel (Ni). Linear ridges with a separation distance of 200 mu m achieved nearly a 2-fold increase in current density relative to the planar electrode at an operating voltage of 1.8 V (vs Hg/HgO). The electrodes with linear ridges having a separation distance of 200 mu m also had the highest sustained current densities over a range of operating conditions for the OER. Self-cleaning surface morphologies could benefit a variety of electrocatalytic gas evolving reactions by improving the efficiency of these processes.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000612551400023	33405506

The obtained electrocatalyst, Mo2C@NPC, possesses small dimension with the size about 200 to 300nm. Mo2C@NPC exhibits very excellent HER activity. It exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance in basic condition, with overpotential 60mV and Tafel slope 63mVdec(-1) to get 10mAcm(-2) current density for H-2 evolution reaction (HER). To realize overall H2O splitting, Co was doped into Mo2C@NPC and a new electrocatalyst, named as Co/Mo2C@NPC was obtained. Co/Mo2C@NPC shows outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Under same condition, to get current with density of 10mAcm(-2), Co/Mo2C@NPC merely need 360mV. The electrocatalyst also possesses excellent durability, after 1000 cycles as well as 10h long-term HER and OER tests, the current keeps stable. To achieve overall H2O splitting, an electrolyzer is constructed with Mo2C@NPC and Co/Mo2C@NPC as cathode and anode. To get a current with density 10mAcm(-2), it only needs a voltage of 1.60V. We expect Mo2C@NPC and Co/Mo2C@NPC electrocatalyst can act as a new material for overall H2O splitting.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			1380-2224	1573-4854		WOS:000475691200011

The precise internal mixture of carbon and oxygen is the largest single source of uncertainty in ages derived from white dwarf cosmochronometry, and it contains information about the rate of the astrophysically important, but experimentally uncertain, C-12(alpha, gamma)O-16 nuclear reaction. Recent determinations of the internal composition and structure of two helium-atmosphere variable (DBV) white dwarf stars, GD 358 and CBS 114, initially led to conflicting implied rates for the C-12(alpha, gamma)O-16 reaction. If both stars were formed through single-star evolution, then the initial analyses of their pulsation frequencies must have differed in some systematic way. I present improved fits to the two sets of pulsation data, resolving the tension between the initial results and leading to a value for the C-12(alpha, gamma)O-16 reaction rate that is consistent with recent laboratory measurements.									51	1	0	0	0	0	52			0004-637X			WOS:000182105700011

However, the successfully developed non-noble metal catalysts have a small tested range and the current density is usually less than 100 mA cm(-2), which is still far away from the practical application standards. Aiming to provide guidance for the fabrication of more advanced electrocatalysts with a large current density, we herein systematically summarize the recent progress achieved in the field of cost-efficient and large-current-density electrocatalyst design. Beginning by illustrating the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) mechanisms, we elaborate on the concurrent issues of non-noble metal catalysts that are required to be addressed. In view of large-current-density operating conditions, some distinctive features with regard to good electrical conductivity, high intrinsic activity, rich active sites, and porous architecture are also summarized. Next, some representative large-current-density electrocatalysts are classified. Finally, we discuss the challenges associated with large-current-density water electrolysis and future pathways in the hope of guiding the future development of more efficient non-noble-metal catalysts to boost large-scale hydrogen production with less electricity consumption.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000762438100001	35231082

This article presented a facile one-pot synthesis method that is based on polyol method for preparing IrCu microspheres. In the process of synthesis, formaldehyde solution and ethylene glycol were used as reducing agent and solvent, respectively, while poly(vinylpyrrolidone) was used as surfactant and dispersant, and all of them played important roles in the successful synthesis of Ir-Cu microspheres. The Ir-Cu microspheres, as synthesized, showed well sphere shape and smooth surface, while their alloy features were quite clear and the composition could be adjusted. Benefitting from the synergistic electronic effect between the Iridium and Cupric atoms from the alloy, the IrCu0.77 microspheres exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity towards OER in 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte, and to achieve 10 mA cm(-2), IrCu0.77 microspheres only required the overpotential of 282 mV, which was much lower than that of commercial Ir/C catalysts.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8				2079-4991		WOS:000483604500120	31405095

Significantly lower overpotentials are required for PdP2@CB (27.5 mV in 0.5 m H2SO4; 35.4 mV in 1m KOH; 84.6 mV in 1 m PBS) to achieve a HER electrocatalytic current density of 10mAcm(-2) compared to commercial Pt/CB (30.1 mV in 0.5 m H2SO4; 46.6 mV in 1 m KOH; 122.7 mV in 1 m PBS).

The influence of S doping amount on the OER activity of the resulted NiFe-LDHs was studied and the optimal surface S content was ca. 0.43 at%. The developed S-doped NiFe-LDH exhibits excellent OER catalyst activity in 1.0 M KOH with overpotential of only 257 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the catalyst could maintain high activity after 30 h stability test. The high activity of the S-doped NiFe-LDH catalysts may originate from the synergistic effect between S and the Fe sites.

J	Wang, Vincent C. -C.								Exploring the kinetic and thermodynamic aspects of four-electron electrochemical reactions: electrocatalysis of oxygen evolution by metal oxides and biological systems								PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS				18	32			22364	22372		10.1039/c6cp03500k				AUG 28 2016	2016	Finding fundamental and general mechanisms for electrochemical reactions, such as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) from water and reduction of CO2, plays vital roles in developing the desired electrocatalysts for facilitating solar fuel production. Recently, density functional theory (DFT) calculations have shown that there is a universal scaling relation of adsorption energy between key intermediate species, HO(ad) and HOO(ad), on the surface of metal oxides as OER electrocatalysts. In this paper, a kinetic and thermodynamic model for the four-electron electrochemical reaction based on previous OER mechanisms proposed by DFT calculations is developed to further investigate the electrocatalytic properties over a wide range of metal oxides and photosystem II. The OER activity of metal oxides (i.e. electrocatalytic current) calculated from the DFT-calculated equilibrium potentials with kinetic properties, such as the rate constants for interfacial electron transfer and catalytic turnover, can lead to a volcano-shaped trend that agrees with the results observed in experiments. In addition, the kinetic aspects of the impact on the electrocatalysts are evaluated. Finally, comparing the results of metal oxides and photosystem II, and fitting experimental voltammograms give further insights into kinetic and thermodynamic roles. Here, the general guidelines for designing OER electrocatalysts with unified kinetic and thermodynamic properties are presented.									15	2	0	0	0	0	15			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000381436500039	27460039

Here the graphene oxide membrane was used as a scaffold to grow nickel oxide/nickel heterostructures under thermal annealing at different temperatures. The formation of reduced graphene oxide (RGO)-NiO/Ni heterostructure membranes was confirmed by structural characterization and thereby used as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in basic solution. The OER performance was optimized with the sample annealed at 500 degrees C, with a NiO/Ni core/shell structure, where the average NiO size was similar to 6 nm. A Tafel slope of 81 mV/decade was measured for the sample, with a potential of similar to 1.76 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). In comparison with the three-dimensional (3D) RGO foam previously studied, the catalysts on RGO membranes show weaker OER performance, possibly due to less porous surfaces in a tightly packed layered structure, which may limit the access of electrolytes for ion transport and reaction. Our current study suggests that future work may need to focus on 3D RGO foam scaffolds for growth of efficient water-splitting nanocatalysts. (C) The Author(s) 2017.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been intensively studied as pyrolyzing precursors to prepare electrocatalysts. However, the aggregation of powder and the low conductivity of polymer binders have limited the applications of powder electrocatalysts. Therefore, the direct growth of MOFs on conductive and porous substrates will be a favorable way to prepare efficient electrocatalysts for electrocatalytic water splitting. Herein, we report a facile strategy for constructing three-dimensional N-doped carbon nanotube frameworks derived from metal-organic framework on Ni foam as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. The resulting electrocatalyst exhibits excellent stability and high OER and HER activity with rather low overpotentials of 230 and 141 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. Specifically, the as-synthesized electrodes were used as both the cathode and anode for overall water splitting with 10 mA/cm(2) at a cell voltage of only 1.62 V. The outstanding electrocatalytic performance is mainly attributed to a large number of accessible active sites of Co nanoparticles dispersed by the N-doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and the ultra-high surface area of CNT frameworks. The presented strategy offers a novel approach for developing MOF-derived nanocarbon materials on Ni foam for electrocatalysis and electrochemical energy devices.									52	3	0	0	0	0	52			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000509428300029	31858792

The core-shell structured materials with transition metal phosphide as the core and nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) as the shell have been known as promising HER electrocatalysts. However, their oxygen-related electrocatalytic activities still remain unsatisfactory, which severely limits their further applications. Herein an effective strategy to improve the core and shell performances of core-shell Co2P@NC electrocatalysts through secondary metal (e.g., Fe, Ni, Mo, Al, Mn) doping (termed M-Co2P@M-N-C) is reported. The as-synthesized M-Co2P@M-N-C electrocatalysts show multifunctional HER/OER/ORR activities and good integrated capabilities for overall water splitting and Zn-air batteries. Among the M-Co2P@M-N-C catalysts, Fe-Co2P@Fe-N-C electrocatalyst exhibits the best catalytic activities, which is closely related to the configuration of highly active species (Fe-doping Co2P core and Fe-N-C shell) and their subtle synergy, and a stable carbon shell for outstanding durability. Combination of electrochemical-based in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with extensive experimental investigation provides deep insights into the origin of the activity and the underlying electrocatalytic mechanisms at the molecular level.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000684471700001	34390182

Construction of nanoarrays on conductive substrates is an effective way to obtain high OER performance, due to the high surface area, enhanced mass diffusion and low interface resistance between catalysts and collectors. To achieve these merits, effective control in the composition, phase structure and size of nanoarrays is highly desirable. Herein, nanosheet arrays of single-phase Co3O4, NiO and Co3O4/NiO nanocomposites were directly grown on carbon cloth by an electrodeposition method. The composition can be finely tuned via changing the Ni2+/Co2+ ratio in the electrodeposition solution. The thickness and plane size of the nanosheets can be also well controlled. The effects of size, composition and phase on the OER activity were investigated in detail. The optimized nanosheet arrays were further coated with a NiO layer to achieve an even enhanced OER activity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0009-2614	1873-4448		WOS:000560719500011

Transition metals-based layered double hydroxides (LDH) have been considered as highly active OER catalysts, while low conductivity and limited active site exposures hinder their further applications. Herein, CoNi LDH/Ti3C2Tx MXene is facilely constructed by using Ti3C2Tx coated nickel foam as support to load CoNi LDH through electrodeposition. Surprisingly, a significant enhancement in OER activity of pristine CoNi LDH is achieved due to the metallic conductivity and hydrophilic and electronegative surface of Ti3C2Tx. Importantly, CoNi LDH/Ti3C2Tx displays prominent OER performance and stability in alkaline medium, which exhibits a low overpotential of 257.4 mV to reach current density of 100 mA/cm(2) and a small Tafel slope of 68 mV/dec. The experimental and calculated results demonstrate electron transfer from CoNi LDH to Ti3C2Tx plays a significant role in boosting OER activity by lowering the binding strength of intermediates.									63	1	0	0	6	0	63			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000561587100010		
J	Liu, Huibing; Yang, Liu; Qiao, Kangwei; Zeng, Xiaofei; Huang, Yan; Zheng, Lirong; Cao, Dapeng								A new concept analogous to homogeneous catalysis to construct in-situ regenerative electrodes for long-term oxygen evolution reaction								NANO ENERGY				76						105115	10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105115				OCT 2020	2020	Achieving in-situ regeneration of heterogeneous catalysts to solve the shedding and dissolution questions of catalysts loaded in electrode is significantly important for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we propose a new concept analogous to homogeneous catalysis to construct in-situ regenerative electrodes to achieve longterm OER, in which the solution of metal salt dispersed in the alkaline electrolyte is considered as pre catalysts to in-situ generate the active species on the surface of the current collector during OER. An uninterrupted OER process of 300 h at a high current density about 80 mA cm-2 is accomplished by the new method. Importantly, in the unique system, the liquid-phase dispersed metal salt in the electrolyte as pre-catalysts, which is analogous to homogenous catalysis system, guarantees the in-situ continuous regeneration of active species, and therefore can solve the shedding and dissolution questions of catalysts during OER, while the previously reported traditional methods cannot achieve the continuous process to solve the shedding and dissolution questions of catalysts during OER. It is expected that this work would open a novel avenue for solving the bottleneck problem of long-term continuous OER process.									10	3	0	0	1	0	10			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000571080900003

In this study, chromium deposition and poisoning at the La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) anode or the oxygen electrode of SOECs are studied for the first time under a current density of 200 mA cm(-2) at 900 and 800 degrees C. After polarization in the presence of the Fe-Cr interconnect at 900 degrees C for 20 h, electrode polarization resistance and overpotential of the O-2 evolution reaction (OER) on the LSCF electrode are 0.413 Omega cm(-2) and 127 mV, respectively, which is nearly 7 and 18 times the initial values of the electrode before the polarization. Significant performance degradation was also observed for the reaction at 800 degrees C in the presence of the Fe-Cr alloy. XRD and XPS analyses clearly identified the deposition of SrCrO4, CrO2.5 and Cr2O3 phases on the surface of LSCF oxygen electrodes and their formation is closely related to the increased segregation of the SrO species under anodic polarization conditions. Sr segregation leads to Sr deficiency at the A-site, thus deteriorating the electrocatalytic activity of the LSCF oxygen electrodes for OER. The results indicate that Cr deposition is essentially a chemical reaction and is initiated by the nucleation reaction between the gaseous Cr species and segregated SrO on the surface region of the LSCF oxygen electrode.									44	3	0	0	4	0	44			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000346473600011	25435014

However, in traditional. PECs, the oxygen evolution reaction and the hydrogen evolution reaction are coupled, and so the rate of both of these is limited by the photocurrents that can be generated from the solar flux. This in turn leads to slow rates of gas evolution that favor crossover of H-2 into the O-2 stream and vice versa, even through ostensibly impermeable membranes such as Nafion. Herein, we show that the use of the electron-coupled-proton buffer (ECPB) H3PMo12O40 allows solar-driven O-2 evolution from water to proceed at rates of over 1 mA cm(-2) on WO3 photoanodes without the need for any additional electrochemical bias. No H-2 is produced in the PEC, and instead H3PMo12O40 is reduced to H5PMo12O40. If the reduced ECPB is subjected to a separate electrochemical reoxidation, then H-2 is produced with full overall Faradaic efficiency.									63	1	0	0	6	0	66			0002-7863			WOS:000377151400004	27159121

A series of electrochemical tests were carried out and the composites were found to exhibit excellent oxygen evolution properties under alkaline conditions. The excellent catalytic activity and stability make the composite have great potential for wide application and provide a basis for its industrial application.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1750-0443			WOS:000472681500001

This study proposes that Nb-doped nickel nitride nanosheets supported on Ni foam (Nb-Ni3N/NF) as novel and effective catalysts demonstrate enhanced electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reduction (OER) compared to the pristine Ni3N samples. DFT calculations reveal that the Nb doping optimizes the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (Delta G(H*)) close to zero and lowers the d-band center of Ni, facilitating the HER process. Meanwhile, the improved OER performance is due to the Nb dopant enhancing the catalytic activity of NiOOH, which in situ formed on the Ni3N surface during anodic oxidation. An alkaline electrolyzer using Nb-Ni3N/NF as electrodes can realize a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.61 V, even close to that of the combination of Pt and RuO2.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000692358700001

Based on high-throughput density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, we chose Ni and V as central ions and prepared Ni-V bimetal MOFs nanospheres (NiV-MNs) assembled from ultrathin 2D MOFs nanosheets through a simple one-step solvothermal method. So far, V-based ultrathin 2D MOFs have been firstly reported. Gradient experiments demonstrated that NiV-MNs shows the best catalytic activity when the amount of Ni is equal to that of V (denoted as Ni1V1-MNs). The Ni1V1-MNs can deliver a high current density of 50 mA.cm(-2) at a low over-potential of 370 mV in alkaline condition even after 10000 s continuous catalytic testing. Coincidentally, the DFT calculations further confirmed that the Delta G of Ni1V1-MNs is much lower compared with Ni1V2-MNs and Ni2V1-MNs. Based upon the experimental results and DFT calculations, we propose that the better performance of Ni1V1-MNs should be attributed to the grater intrinsic activity of Ni and the coupling effect between Ni and V, as they are crucial for tuning the electrochemical activity.

Herein, mixed-metal borides are shown to be competitive with established electrocatalysts like noble metal oxides and other transition-metal(oxide)-based catalysts. Iron incorporation into nanoscale dicobalt boride results in excellent activity and stability in alkaline solutions. (Co0.7Fe0.3)(2)B shows an overpotential of =0.33V (1.56V vs. RHE) at 10mAcm(-2) in 1m KOH with a very low onset potential of approximate to 1.5V vs. RHE, comparable to the performance of IrO2 and RuO2. XPS shows that the original catalyst is modified under the reaction conditions and indicates that CoOOH and Co(OH)(2) are formed as active surface species, whereas the Fe remains in the catalyst, contributing to an improved catalyst performance. The nanoscale borides are obtained by a one-step solution synthesis, calcined, and characterized by XRD, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and SEM.

In accordance to this direction, iridium/titanium films deposited directly on carbon substrates via magnetron sputtering are operated as electrodes for the oxygen evolution reaction interfaced with Nafion 115 electrolyte in a laboratory single cell PEM hydrogen generator. The anode with 0.2 mg cm(-2) It catalyst loading was electrochemically activated by cycling its potential Value between 0 and 1.2 V (vs. RHE). The water electrolysis cell was operated at 90 degrees C with current density 1A cm(-2) at 1.51 V without the ohmic contribution. The corresponding current density per mgr of Ir catalyst is 5 A mg(-1). The achieved high efficiency is combined with sufficient electrode stability since the oxidation of the carbon substrate during the anodic polarization is almost negligible. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

By combining first-principle calculations and reactive molecular dynamics simulations, we show that surface functionalization of 2D MXene nanosheets offers a high degree of tunability of the catalytic activity for oxygen-reduction and oxygen-evolution reactions (ORR/OER). We show that the controlled creation of active vacancy sites on the MXene surface enhances ORR in excess of a factor of 60 compared to graphene-based cathode materials. Furthermore, we find that increasing the ratio of fluorine vs. oxygen termination of the functionalized Ti4N3-MXene catalyst reduces the charge overpotential by up to 70% and 80% compared with commercial platinum-on-carbon and graphene catalysts, respectively. These results provide direct guidance toward the rational design of functionalized 2D materials for modulating the catalytic activity for a wide range of electrocatalytic applications.									32	1	0	0	2	0	32			2399-3669			WOS:000480601200001

Simultaneous photoelectrochemical oxidation of benzylamine and hydrogen production through Ti doping								NANO ENERGY				61				36	46		10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.04.013				JUL 2019	2019	Overall water splitting represents one of the most promising approaches toward solar energy conversion and storage, which is, however, severely challenged by the four-electron/four-proton nature of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). One option to overcome this issue is to replace OER with a more useful reaction, for simultaneous production of both hydrogen and chemicals of interest. For the purpose, in this paper a cheap, hydrothermally prepared Ti-doped nanostructured hematite photoanode was employed for the first time as highly stable, heterogeneous catalyst for the low bias, efficient and highly selective photoinduced oxidation of benzylamine to N-benzylidenebenzylamine, and for the simultaneous production of hydrogen in a double solvent/environment cell. A preliminary estimate indicates the possibility to obtain a similar to 150 mu mol h(-1) H-2 production, with the contemporary production of stoichiometric benzylidene N-benzylamine in a 5 x 5 cm(2) area electrode. This study contributes to overcome the 40-year lasting issues limiting the use of hematite in industrial photo-electrochemical sunlight conversion and storage, due to poor performance of hematite and lack of economic value of oxygen production, providing solid evidence for the use of hematite in alternative oxidation reactions of industrial importance.									33	1	0	0	1	0	33			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000471201800005

Here, two types of electrodes have been investigated-Ti0.7Ru0.3Ox, and electrodes with aimed composition Ti0.34Ru0.3Sn0.3Sb0.06Ox, both compared with platinum anodes. The cell oxygen off-gas was analyzed employing mass spectrometry together with ex situ UV-vis spectroscopy to quantify the kinetic rate constants. Noteworthy is that the respective rates of oxygen formation from anodic and chemical reactions in the presence of hypochlorite are of the same magnitude. The addition of Sn and Sb doubled the surface area of the electrodes and decreased oxygen production when electrodes were used for the first time. However, rate constants for total oxygen production with reused electrodes follow the trend: homogeneous hypochlorite decomposition < TiRu < TiRuSnSb to the highest value obtained by Pt. The same trend is noticed for rate constants concerning the hypochlorite decomposition.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0888-5885			WOS:000700883000008

The specific adsorption of Cl- on coatings, the effect of La on the chlorine evolution reactions (ClER) and the kinetic mechanism were investigated by using differential capacity (DC) and polarization curves (PC). Results show that the coating surface exhibits significantly specific adsorption of Cl- in NaCl neutral solution, which has an influence on the kinetics of the chlorine evolution process, resulting in an increase of the Tafel slope and a decrease of the reaction order. The addition of lanthanum reduces the overpotential of Ti/RuO2 coating and enhances the exchange current density, which improves the chlorine evolution reaction of the coatings. Both kinetic mechanisms of recombination and electrochemical desorption of adsorbed intermediate species for the coatings are comparatively studied. It is confirmed that the Chlorine evolution reaction on Ru-La-O oxide coatings in NaCl neutral solution is controlled by the process of 2 S center dot OCl* -> 2 S center dot O+ Cl-2.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1000-324X			WOS:000355772400007

In this work, we report the transformation of Ni3S2 nanowire array on nickel foam into the amorphous nickel carbonate nanowire array on nickel foam (NiCO3/NF). The resulting NiCO3/NF shows high electrocatalytic activity towards water oxidation and affords current density of 50 mA.cm(2) at overpotential of 395 mV in 1.0 mol.L-1 KHCO3. Moreover, this NiCO3/NF is also durable with a long-term electrochemical durability of 60 h.

Recently, research has been conducted to decrease the operation temperature of SOECs below 750 degrees C to overcome high system costs and rapid degradation rate at high operation temperatures. Although La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta(LSCF) is a promising oxygen electrode for SOEC, when the operating temperature is reduced, the reaction kinetics of the LSCF oxygen electrode is significantly decreased due to high activation energy of the oxygen ion transport. To address this issue, we developed a composite oxygen electrode of LSCF combined with Gd and Nd double doped ceria (GNDC). Due to excellent oxygen ion transport nature of GNDC, the SOEC with the LSCF-GNDC oxygen electrode yielded impressive current density of similar to 1,174 mA cm(-2)at 1.3 V at 750 degrees C along with excellent stability. These results demonstrated that the novel LSCF-GNDC composite is promising as an efficient and durable oxygen electrode for SOEC applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1615-6846	1615-6854		WOS:000546133600001

Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbon/nitrides (MXene) materials have shown great potential as highly efficient catalysts due to their excellent properties. In this work, the heteroatom X (X = N, B, P, S) doping effect on the HER of M2C MXene (M = Ti, Mo) with or without oxygen functional groups have been performed by well-defined density functional calculations (DFT). The X doped M2CT2 (M = Mo, Ti; T = O) exhibited better HER catalytic activity than the X doped pristine M2C (M = Mo and Ti). Moreover, the calculated Gibbs free energies of hydrogen adsorption (Delta G(H)) indicate that the N-doped Ti2CO2 has improved electrocatalytic activity than that of Pt(1 1 1). Additionally, based on the electronic structure of X-doped Ti2CO2, the electrical conductivity of N-doped Ti2CO2 is higher than that of pristine Ti2CO2.									65	7	0	0	5	0	67			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000496923200030

The catalyst was fabricated by the electrodeposition of a Cu-Ni alloy onto titanium nitride (TiN) nanoparticles on carbon mesh. The use of TiN on carbon as a solid support greatly enhances both the CO2 reduction and O-2 evolution catalytic activity of the Cu-Ni particles. By combining both the CO2RR and OER in a two-electrode device, this bifunctional system exhibited good durability for 24 hours at an overpotential of 670 mV at 2 mA cm(-2). In this configuration, this device produced 19.1% CO and 6.7% formate as products of the CO2RR. Through cyclic voltammetry studies, it was found that Cu-Ni preferentially deposits on TiN as compared to bare carbon, thus allowing for more Cu-Ni to be uniformly deposited, which significantly enhances catalysis. Current densities normalized to the amount of the Cu-Ni catalyst demonstrate that Cu-Ni on TiN/C is significantly more active per gram of catalyst. X-ray diffraction studies suggest that the Cu (111) and Ni (111) facets contribute to the enhanced catalytic activity.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2398-4902			WOS:000582936800022

Hydrogen peroxide not only has oxygen storage capacity of similar to 1,600 times that of air but is also in some ways more convenient for storage and transportation than high-pressure cylinders. H2O2 may be a viable alternative in non-oxygen conditions. Here, we report aqueous Zn-H2O2 battery that is designed by replacing O-2 gas with hydrogen peroxide using Co/N doped carbon nanosheet as a multifunctional catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and H2O2 decomposition. The optimized Zn-H2O2 battery exhibits superior high-rate discharging performance among 20-120 mA cm(-2), 23% higher than that of Zn-air battery at the rate of 120 mA cm(-2). As an application, two-serial Zn-H2O2 batteries can light a red LED array and work well in water. Therefore, we think Zn-H2O2 battery has numerous applications in high-power devices.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2666-3864		WOS:000658740500002

Materials, so obtained, were tested for their electrocatalytic properties towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the form film on Ni-support in alkaline solution. The study showed that the electrocatalytic properties the material increased with partial substitution of Co for Ni in the base oxide (Ni1.5Fe1.5O4). The value being highest with 1.25 mol Co-substitution. At E = 850 mV vs Hg/HgO in 1M KOH at 25 degrees C, the electrode showed apparent current density 137.1 mA cm(-2), which is about 2.5 times higher than the base oxide. The Tafel slope values were ranged between 53-90 mV decade-1. A pair of redox peak, an anodic (E-Pa = 522 +/- 28 mV) and corresponding cathodic (E-Pc= 356 +/- 9 mV), was observed in the cyclic voltammetry (CV) study of the material. The thermodynamic parameters namely, standard apparent electrochemical enthalpy of activation (Delta H-el degrees(not equal)), standard enthalpy of activation (Delta H degrees(not equal)) and standard entropy of activation (Delta s degrees(not equal)) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have also been determined by recording anodic polarization curve in 1M KOH. The value of Delta H degrees(not equal) was observed to be almost similar with each oxide electrode.

In particular, two-dimensional MOF nanosheet materials possess the advantages of both 2D layered nanomaterials and MOFs and are considered to be promising nanomaterials. Herein, we report a facile and scalable in situ hydrothermal synthesis of Co-hypoxanthine (HPA) MOF nanosheets, which were then directly carbonized to prepare uniform Co@N-Carbon nanosheets for efficient bifunctional electrocatalytic hydrogen-evolution reactions (HERs) and oxygen-evolution reactions (OERs). The Co embedded in N-doped carbon shows excellent and stable catalytic performance for bifunctional electrocatalytic OERs and HERs. For OERs, the overpotential of Co@N-Carbon at 10mAcm(-2) was 400mV (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). The current density of Co@N-Carbon reached 100mAcm(-2) at an overpotential of 560mV, which showed much better performance than RuO2; the largest current density of RuO2 that could be reached was only 44mAcm(-2). The Tafel slope of Co@N-Carbon was 61mVdec(-1), which is comparable to that of commercial RuO2 (58mVdec(-1)). The excellent electrocatalytic properties can be attributed to the nanosheet structure and well-dispersed carbon-encapsulated Co, CoN nanoparticles, and N-dopant sites, which provided high conductivity and a large number of accessible active sites. The results highlight the great potential of utilizing MOF nanosheet materials as promising templates for the preparation of 2D Co@N-Carbon materials for electrocatalysis and will pave the way to the development of more efficient 2D nanomaterials for various catalytic applications.									33	0	0	0	0	0	33			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000434216200012	29624891

The atomic oxygen concentration evolution is described by the diffusion equation as the mean free path of atoms is very small in comparison with the reactor radius. The recombination coefficient values are calculated from the concentration profile obtained by VIS-spectroscopy and for different temperatures of the sample. We also have measured the gas temperature profile above the sample using molecular emission spectroscopy with very precise measurement close to the surface sample where recombination occurs. Finally, we can reach the activation energy of the atomic oxygen recombination reaction for each material in the studied temperature range.The experimental results are compared with semiclassical Molecular Dynamics calculations performed on the same catalytic system aiming at determining, at a molecular level, the basic features of the surface catalytic activity. A substantial agreement between the experimental and the theoretical recombination coefficients has been found in the surface temperature range explored in the experiments. hi addition to that, the collision dynamics simulation has revealed interesting aspects concerning the energetic and the mechanism of the surface reaction, still under current discussion. In particular, results are reported and discussed on the relative importance of the Langinuir-Hinshelwood and Eley-Rideal reaction mechanisms and the fraction of the energy flux deposited to the silica substrate.					4th European Symposium on Aerothermodynamics for Space Vehicles4th European Symposium on Aerothermodynamics for Space Vehicles	OCT 15-18, 2001OCT 15-18, 2001	European Space Agcy; CIRA; ASIEuropean Space Agcy; CIRA; ASI	CAPUA, ITALYCAPUA, ITALY	3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0379-6566		92-9092-789-5	WOS:000177017700055

Here we report the nickel-molybdenum-nitride nanoplates loaded on carbon fiber cloth (Ni-Mo-N/CFC), for the concurrent electrolytic productions of high-purity hydrogen at the cathode and value-added formate at the anode in low-cost alkaline glycerol solutions. Especially, when equipped with Ni-Mo-N/CFC at both anode and cathode, the established electrolyzer requires as low as 1.36 V of cell voltage to achieve 10 mA cm(-2), which is 260 mV lower than that in alkaline aqueous solution. Moreover, high Faraday efficiencies of 99.7% for H-2 evolution and 95.0% for formate production have been obtained. Based on the excellent electrochemical performances of Ni-Mo-N/CFC, electrolytic H-2 and formate productions from the alkaline glycerol solutions are an energy-efficient and promising technology for the renewable and clean energy supply in the future.									159	14	0	0	12	0	161			2041-1723			WOS:000498689500001	31767871

To consider the effect of solvent species on the local configuration of the active single metal, a thermodynamical full-landscape searching (TFLS) scheme is employed. The calculated thermodynamic overpotentials (eta(td)) from our TFLS indicate that Co@N(4)TG displays high catalytic activity toward both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and reduction reaction (ORR), with eta(OER)(td) and eta(ORR)(td) as 0.397 and 0.357 V, respectively. Its OER potential cannot be captured if only one four electron reaction loop (FERL) is considered. The actual active pathways do not always turn out to be the reactions starting from the bare site. Our findings demonstrate that TG is a promising support and TM confined TD can be used to design effective and cheap multifunctional electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2191-1363			WOS:000618682600001	33594818

However, developing bifunctional electrocatalysts with Pt-like activity and superior stability under acidic media still remains a big challenge. Herein, we report a successful synthesis of Ir wavy nanowires with an ultrathin diameter of 1.7 nm through a simple wet-chemical approach. Benefiting from the unique morphology with high aspect ratios and a large specific surface area, the as-synthesized ultrathin Ir wavy nanowires exhibit enhanced activity and durability for both the oxygen evolution reaction and the hydrogen evolution reaction in acidic electrolytes. Moreover, when used for overall acidic water splitting, a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is achieved at only a cell voltage of 1.62 V in 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte with longterm stability. In view of the excellent electrochemical water splitting performance and superior stability in acidic electrolytes, we believe that the obtained Ir wavy nanowires could be potential alternative catalysts toward PEM water electrolysis.									85	7	0	0	2	0	85			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000423355300038	29313049

In this regard, in the present work a three-dimensional Fe2TiO5/nitrogen-doped graphene (denoted as 3D FTO/NG) hybrid electrocatalyst was synthesized via a facile in-situ process using a hydrothermal method. Structural characterization of the prepared nanocomposite is performed by various techniques e.g. field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectra (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopic methods. A novel binder-free electrode for OER activity has been prepared by coating a 3D FTO/NG onto nickel foam (NF). In particular, the 3D FTO/NG nanocomposite, which is synthesized with in-situ hydrothermal process, exhibited a remarkable OER performance in alkaline media. The prepared electrocatalyst showed a small overpotential of 0.36 V with a Tafel slope of 0.07 V dec(-1) at 100 A m(-2) with a long-term stability for OER reaction in 1 M KOH. The outstanding OER performance and durability of 3D FTO/NG can be attributed to the synergistic effects originating from NG and FTO in the prepared electrocatalyst, which helps to enhance the conductivity of the nanocomposite. The presence of conductive NG in the prepared 3D nanocomposite can not only improve the mechanical stability, but also facilitate its electron transport. Also, N atoms and FTO provide abundant electrocatalytic active sites, which accelerate evolution of gas bubbles. This work provides a promising approach for synthesis of inexpensive and efficient OER electrocatalysts. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

A well-defined hollow spherical structure with a heterointerface between Ni3S2 and MoS2 is constructed using solvothermal and sulfurization processes. Owing to their bimetallic heterostructure, porous hollow carbon structure with large surface area, and numerous exposed active sites, the Ni3S2/MoS2 hollow spheres are found to be efficient electrocatalysts for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The heterostructured Ni3S2/MoS2 hollow spheres show small overpotentials of 303 and 166 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER and HER in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. Furthermore, an overall water-splitting electrolyzer consisting of the Ni(3)S2/MoS2 hollow spheres as both the anode and cathode requires a very low cell voltage of 1.62 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with outstanding long-term stability for 100 h. Our findings offer a new pathway for the design and synthesis of electrochemically advanced bifunctional catalysts for various energy storage and conversion applications.

This work investigates the real capabilities of cryptomelane as an oxidation catalyst. In particular, the preferential CO oxidation (CO-PROX), has been studied as a simple reaction model. When doped with copper, the cryptomelane-based material has revealed a great potential, displaying a comparable activity to the high-performance CuO/CeO2. Despite stability concerns that compromise the primary catalyst reusability, CuO/cryptomelane is particularly robust in the presence of CO2 and H2O, typical components of realistic CO-PROX streams. The CO-PROX reaction mechanism has been assessed by means of isotopic oxygen pulse experiments. Altogether, CuO/CeO2 shows a greater oxygen lability, which facilitates lattice oxygen enrolment in the CO-PROX mechanism. In the case of CuO/cryptomelane, in spite of its lower oxygen mobility, the intrinsic structural water co-assists as active oxygen species involved in COPROX. Thus, the presence of moisture in the reaction stream turns out to be beneficial for the stability of the cryptomelane structure, besides aiding into the active oxygen restitution in the catalyst. Overall, this study proves that CuO/cryptomelane is a promising competitor to CuO/CeO2 in CO-PROX technology, whose implementation can bring the CO-PROX technology and H-2 purification processes a more sustainable nature.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2168-0485			WOS:000651053000018	34567850

To overcome the limitation of catalysts with only one active site, Ni-Sn dual sites, respectively pointing at the amino and carbonyl groups of the urea molecule, were designed based on the orbital symmetry matching principle to electrocatalytically oxidize urea at the anode for highly efficient hydrogen evolution at the cathode. The synthesized Ni-Sn sulfide catalyst, having a high active surface area (145 m(2)g(-1)), displayed outstanding performance in the UOR with a low potential of 1.36 V (vs.RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2)and achieved a high hydrogen production rate (100 L min(-1)g(cat)(-1)) at the potential of 1.69 V (vs.RHE). The density functional theory studies combined with Raman experiments unveiled that the enhanced performance is due to the weakening of the urea C-N bond, resulting from the precisely designed Ni-Sn dual active sites, and the self-driven electron transfer between Ni and Sn. The synergistic strategy of point-to-point dual active sites developed here not only achieved a highly efficient UOR to boost hydrogen production, but also provides a new concept when designing catalysts for other catalytic reactions.									36	0	0	0	2	0	36			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000553632500026

The electrocatalytic performance for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is characterized in alkaline solution. As an anode material, the catalyst shows excellent OER catalytic activity with a low Tafel slope of 67.3 mV dec(-1) and a low overpotential of 303 mV to reach 20 mA cm(-2), which is comparable to RuO2. As a cathode material, the as prepared Ni-P shows relatively good catalytic performance for HER with a moderate Tafel slope of 75.2 mV dec(-1) and an overpotential of -176 mV to deliver 20 mA cm(-2). Employing the bifunctional catalyst as anode and cathode material in a two electrode system, a cell voltage of 1.63 V is required to reach an overall water splitting current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with good electrochemical stability. The excellent performance should be attributed to the coupling effect of the Ni-P composition with amorphous and P compositing feature and the hollow dendritic architecture with high accessible surface area.

The efficiency of these devices depends on material characteristics, in particular porosity and oxygen content. This paper focusses on densification and oxygen evolution in Cu and Cu-25 wt%Cr compacts during sintering. Chemical reactions and their relationships with sintering are studied by dilatometric and thermogravimetric analyses coupled with mass spectrometry. High density Cu compacts swell during sintering, due to the gas released in closed pores by Cu oxide reduction reactions. The addition of Cr hinders the sintering kinetics by a mechanical effect but prevents swelling phenomena by trapping the released oxygen in solid chromium oxide. The furnace atmosphere has a major effect as its reducing degree determines the chemical reactions. Under neutral atmosphere such as secondary vacuum, copper oxide reduction occurs at high temperature, when densification has already produced close pores. In Cu compacts, this leads to large swelling while in Cu-25 wt% Cr compacts the oxidation of Cr traps the oxygen in CR2O3 interfacial nodules. A reducing atmosphere such as diluted hydrogen flux reduces the Cu oxide at lower temperature, so that part of the released oxygen is evacuated out of the compact. This leads to lower swelling in Cu compact and to a reduced amount of chromium oxide in lower oxygen Cu-25 wt% Cr compacts, which results to better bonding between Cu and Cr particles.

Herein, a two dimensional (2D) nanosheet ammonium cobalt phosphate hydrate (NH4CoPO4 center dot H2O) catalyst based on the earth-abundant non-noble metal is reported. When used for the challenging alkaline saline water electrolysis, the NH4CoPO4 center dot H2O catalyst with the optimal thickness of 30 nm achieves current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) at the record low overpotentials of 252 and 268 mV, respectively, while maintaining remarkable stability during the alkaline saline water oxidation at room temperature. X-ray absorption fine spectra reveal that the activation of Co (II) ions (in NH4CoPO4 center dot H2O) to Co (III) species constructs the electrocatalytic active sites. The 2D nanosheet morphology of NH4CoPO4 center dot H2O provides a larger active surface area and more surface-exposed active sites, which enable the nanosheet catalyst to facilitate the alkaline freshwater and simulated seawater oxidation with excellent activity. The facile and environmentally-benign H2O-mediated synthesis route under mild condition makes NH4CoPO4 center dot H2O catalyst highly feasible for practical manufacturing. In comparison with noble metals, this novel electrocatalyst offers a cost-effective alternative for economic saline water oxidation to advance water electrolysis technology.									18	1	0	0	0	0	18				2198-3844		WOS:000651031100001	34306978

Here, a nickel foam-supported electrocatalyst consisting of a one-dimensional Co3O4 nanowire and two-dimensional NiFe-LDH nanosheets is reported. The optimized Co3O4@NiFe-LDH/NF catalyst affords 79 and 215 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for catalyzing the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction in 1.0 M KOH, which also exhibits quick reaction kinetics and excellent durability. The self-supported electrode only requires 1.58 V to afford 10 mA cm(-2) with astonishing stability for water splitting.

In the present work, a novel strategy of controllable assembly and synergistic catalysis based on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) active and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) active single functional sites, was ingeniously assembled to high-performance catalysts for overall-water-splitting. Monodispersed zeolitic imidazolate framework cubes were adopted as the reaction precursors to construct bi-functional electrocatalysts through conformal Prussian blue analogue layer coating and the subsequent thermal phosphorization process. HER active Co-P and OER active Co-Fe-P hetero-components were simultaneously anchored on the shell layers of the resulted Co-Fe-P hollow nanoboxes. Benefiting from the unique structural design and functional integration, the product catalyst afforded small overpotentials of 174 and 53 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) for the OER and HER in alkaline media, respectively and a ultra-low operating cell voltage of 1.46 V for overall-water-splitting, superior to most recently reported striking bi-functional electrocatalysts. Moreover, its ultrastable catalytic activity was also impressive, delivering only negligible performance loss after a 24 h durability testing. More broadly, this combined double functionalization concept and nanoscale hollowing design is unique and advantageous, especially suitable for developing highly active and durable electrocatalysts of energy conversion reactions.									63	5	0	0	5	0	63			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000623317400004

However, spatially dependent degradation pathways for porous catalysts remain elusive. Here, we reveal the multiple degradation behaviors of individual PtCu3 nanocatalysts spatially by threedimensional (3D) electron tomography. We demonstrate that the surface area-volume ratio (SVR) of cycled porous particles decreases linearly rather than reciprocally with particle size. Additionally, an improved SVR (about 3-fold enhancement) results in increased oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) efficiency at the early stage. However, in the subsequent cycles, the degradation of catalytic activity is due to the excessive growth of pores, the reduction of reaction sites, and the chemical segregation of Cu atoms. The spatial porosity evolution model of nanocatalysts is applicable for a wide range of catalytic reactions, providing a critical insight into the degradation of catalyst activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000810022200001	35638553

We present for the first time hierarchical hollow microspheres grafted with metallic Co-embedded bamboo-like N-doped carbon nanotube bundles (Co-b-NCNTs hollow microspheres) as oxygen electrodes for Li-air batteries. Hierarchical composite microspheres are prepared via a facile two-step process involving synthesis of Co3O4-MgO hollow microspheres by spray pyrolysis, followed by internal and external growth of bamboo-like NCNTs in the shells. During post-treatment, metallic Co and MgO nanoparticles play key respective roles in catalyzing in-situ growth of NCNTs and maintaining structural integrity of the composites. The hierarchical composite structure with Co and N doping not only provides ample active sites for the OER and ORR, but also sufficient space for storing produced Li2O2. Thus, Co-b-NCNTs hollow microspheres exhibit high initial round-trip efficiency, long-term cycling and ultrahigh rate performances when applied as oxygen electrodes for Li-O-2 batteries. The initial discharge capacity and round-trip efficiency at a current density of 200 mA g(-1) are 28,968 mA h g(-1) and 78.2%, respectively. Specific capacities at cutoff capacities of 500 and 1000 mA h g(-1) are stable for 201 and 157 cycles, respectively.									28	2	0	0	5	0	28			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000418533400249

The competition for introducing catalysts with higher performance and cost-efficiency in comparison to the previous systems based on noble metals is one of the most interesting directions in this field. By merging the advantages of inorganic and organic materials, MOFs (metal-organic frameworks) have gained an ample attention as highly versatile electro- and photoelectrocatalytic platforms. This is governed by the intricate features of MOFs including extraordinary surface area, exceptional porosity, tailorable pore size, vast structural and chemical tunability, and pre- and post-synthesis structural modifiability. In contrast to monometallic compounds, bimetallic MOFs (BMOFs) and their composites offer many advantages, including improved electrical conductivity, extended active sites, high charge capacity, and adjustable electrochemical activity. Metal-organic frameworks can also be combined with other electrochemically active materials, resulting in advanced composites with large specific area, increased electrical conductivity, and superiour dispersion. Besides, some BMOFs show an enhanced electrocatalytic activity under light irradiation, thus permitting their application as photoelec-trocatalysts. The present review summarizes the state-of-the-art on bimetallic MOFs and derived composites for the main current types of electro- and photoelectrocatalytic applications. The study also aims to highlight the challenges and opportunities in this area, with a focus on future perspectives of such multimetallic compounds and materials, with a particular emphasis in the field of energy and electrophotocatalysis.

Gas evolution from arc-fused MgO								High Temperatures - High Pressures				15	3			347	9						1983	1983	Dissolved `atomic' carbon in MgO has a very pronounced tendency to diffuse into the elastically relaxed subsurface zone and to build up steep subsurface carbon concentration profiles. Upon heating, back diffusion takes place, but chemical reactions also occur at the surface leading to the evolution of gases. The `atomic' carbon is capable of reacting with lattice oxygen to give CO2 and CO, lattice hydrogen derived from traces of codissolved H2O, viz. OH-, to give a large variety of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons, including aromatics, and lattice nitrogen, contained as an impurity in the MgO, to give HCN and other nitrogen-containing species.					8th European Thermophysical Properties Conference8th European Thermophysical Properties Conference	27 Sept.-1 Oct. 198227 Sept.-1 Oct. 1982		Baden Baden, West GermanyBaden Baden, West Germany	0	0	0		0	0	0			0018-1544			INSPEC:2211477

Several flake-like quantum dots with different shapes such as triangulene, elliptical, rhomboid, and square, as well as hydrocarbons having sunflower, kekulene, and snow-like structures, are considered and their electrocatalytic activities toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are theoretically evaluated. The activity analysis indicates that the OER overpotentials for the examined carbon materials vary in the range between 0.56 and 1.22 V. Benefiting from the improved electronic properties due to the proper morphology, remarkable catalytic activity was achieved for the snow-like morphology affording over potentials of 0.56 V for OER and-0.05 V for HER. In addition to snow-like, other morphologies such as triangulene and square can effectively promote acidic hydrogen evolution via Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. On contrary, the high values of free energies for H2O dissociation step reveal that, under the alkaline condition, the examined carbon materials cannot be considered as efficient HER catalysts.

Proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis is the utmost suitable technology for this purpose, although the quest for low cost, highly active and durable catalysts is persistent. Here we develop a nanostructured iridium catalyst after electrochemically leaching ruthenium from metallic iridium-ruthenium, Ir0.7Ru0.3Ox (EC), and compare its physical and electrochemical properties to the thermally treated counterpart: Ir0.7Ru0.3O2 (TT). Ir0.7Ru0.3Ox (EC) shows an unparalleled 13-fold higher oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity compared to the Ir0.7Ru0.3O2 (TT). PEM electrolyzer tests at 1 A cm(-2) show no increase of cell voltage for almost 400 h, proving that Ir0.7Ru0.3Ox (EC) is one of the most efficient anodes so far developed.									77	4	0	0	1	0	77			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000400383300039

It is shown that sulfate-containing FeNiCoCrMnS2 exhibits superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with an exceptionally low overpotential of 199, 246, 285, and 308 mV at current densities of 10, 100, 500, and 1000 mA cm(-2), respectively, and surpassing its unary-, binary-, ternary-, and quaternary-metal counterparts. The electrocatalyst yields exceptional stability after 12 000 cycles and 55 h of durability even at a high current density of 500 mA cm(-2). Various in situ and ex situ analyses are used to investigate the self-reconstruction of the sulfides during the OER for the first time. The resulting metal (oxy)hydroxide is believed to be the true active center for OER. The remaining sulfate also contributes to the catalytic activity. Density function theory calculation is in good agreement with the experimental result. The extraordinary OER performance of the high entropy sulfide brings a great opportunity for desirable catalyst design for practical applications.									26	0	0	0	2	0	26			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000691435200001

Universal and efficient electrocatalysts for these reactions are essential elements for the development of renewable and clean energy technologies. Herein, we show the design and fabrication of the rhodium nanoparticles modified fluorine-doped graphene (Rh/F-graphene) catalyst using silicon nanowires (SiNWs) as the sacrifice template. The optimized Rh/F-graphene catalyst (Rh/F-graphene-2) has a low Rh mass fraction of 9.4% and F doping of 4.0%. The mean diameter of Rh is 9.39 nm. Rh/F-graphene-2 serves as a proton-adsorption-dominated multifunctional electrocatalyst for both HER and FAOR with performance superior to 20 wt % Pt/C in acidic solution. In addition, due to the doping of fluorine, the stability of Rh/F-graphene-2 catalyst greatly improves and is the best among all the compared electrocatalysts. This design for multifunctional catalysts could greatly increase the utilization ratio of Rh, which may provide a new avenue for the preparation of other noble metal-based catalysts.									48	0	0	0	0	0	48			1944-8244			WOS:000446919800024	30193058

The synthesis of nano structured phosphides often involves highly reactive and hazardous phosphorous-containing compound's. Herein,. we report the synthesis of nickel phosphides through thermal treatment under H-2(5%)/Ar of layered nickel phenylphosphonate (NiPh) or methylphosphonate (NiMe) that act as single-source precursors. Ni12P5, Ni12P5-Ni2P, and Ni2P nanoparticles (NPs) with, sizes of ca. 15-45 nm coated with a thin shell of carbonaceous material were produced. Thermogravirnetric.analysis coupled with mass spectrometry (TG-MS) showed that H-2, H2O, P-2, and-C6H5 are the main compounds formed during the transformation of the precursor under argon and no-hazard-.phosphorous-containing compounds are created,. making a simple and relatively safe route for fabricating nanostructured TMPs. The H-2 most likely reacts with the-PO3 groups, of the precursor to form H2O and P-2, and: the latter subsequently reacts with the metal to produce the phosphide. The Ni12135-Ni2P and Ni2P NPs efficiently catalyze the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with Ni2P showing the best performance and generating a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 87 mV and exhibiting long-term stability. Co2P and CoP NPs were also synthesized following this method. This approach may be utilized, to explore the rich metal phOsphonate chemistry for fabricating phosphide-based materials for electrochemical energy conversion and storage applications.									45	3	0	0	2	0	47			1944-8244			WOS:000400321800023	28357856

However, as hydrogen ions (H+) are the minority species in alkaline media, the kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is markedly reduced. Concurrently, the transport of hydroxide ions (OH-) is limited under large current density in alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, Ni nanoparticles-decorated Mo-Ni microrods (Ni/Mo-Ni) are adopted to boost the ion adsorption. Finite-element simulations suggest that a strong local electric field around the Ni nanoparticles exponentially increases ion adsorption towards the electrode surface, which facilitates reaction kinetics and mass transfer for HER at the cathode and OER at the anode. Thus, the Ni/Mo-Ni electrode exhibits a low overpotential of only -24 mV for HER and + 215 mV for OER to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and can achieve an industrial alkaline splitting current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at a low voltage of 1.76 V and stably operate for 87 h. This work suggests a new paradigm in the design and engineering of high-performance catalysts for alkaline electrolyzers.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000774914800001

However, the sluggish kinetic of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process deteriorates their activity toward overall water splitting. To overcome this issue, two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin arrays of metal-doped CoP (MCoP; M = Fe, Ni, and Mg) were successfully prepared by using layered double hydroxides (LDHs) as precursors. The as-obtained 2D ultrathin arrays exhibit an outstanding electrocatalytic activity and long-term durability toward both half-reaction in overall water splitting. As a result, the electrolyzer assembled by FeCoP UNSAs consumes a cell potential as low as 1.60 V (at 10 mA cm(-2)). An experimental-theoretical combination study reveals that the electronic structure of Co is modulated via the incorporation of Fe, which benefits the adsorption of water molecule and the dissociation of OH group, accounting for the largely enhanced activity toward overall water splitting.									161	10	0	0	3	0	165			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000415302600064

The major difference between this work and previous work is that we use more recent opacity data from the OPAL project. Since, in general, these opacities are higher than those available 10 years ago, at a given effective temperature, convection zones go deeper than in models with older opacity data. Thus convective dredge-up of observationally detectable carbon in helium atmosphere white dwarfs can occur for thicker helium layers than found by Pelletier et al, We find that the range of observed C to He ratios in different DQ white dwarfs of similar effective temperature is well explained by a range of initial helium layer mass between 10(-3) and 10(-2)M., in good agreement with stellar evolution theory, assuming a typical white dwarf mass of 0.6 M.. We also predict that oxygen will be present in DQ white dwarf atmospheres in detectable amounts if the helium layer mass is near the lower limit compatible with stellar evolution theory. Determination of the oxygen abundance has the potential of providing information on the profile of oxygen in the core and hence on the important C-12(alpha, gamma)O-16 reaction rate.									39	0	0	0	0	0	39			0035-8711			WOS:000074003700007

However, their insulating nature has limited their application as electrocatalysts. Herein, we report a heterogeneous nanostructure of a Ni-based MOF-modified Ni3S2/NiS hollow nanoparticle. The Ni3S2/NiS hollow core is prepared by a sulfuration process from a colloidal nickel nanoparticle using dodecanethiol followed by a low-temperature heat treatment in air to remove the adsorbed organic ligands. The thin shell of the Ni-based MOF (Ni-BDC) is synthesized using an in situ method in which the nickel sulfides supply the metal source and the additional terephthalic acid serves as the linker. Serving as an oxygen evolution reaction catalyst, this hybrid nanocomposite shows superior electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 298 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) without carbon addition and a long-time endurability with no detectable activity deterioration, which can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the advantageous heterogeneous structure, combining the good hydrophilicity and coordinative unsaturation of the Ni-BDC shell and the high conductivity and porosity of the Ni3S2/NiS core as well as the strongly coupled interface between them.									31	1	0	0	3	0	31			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000474670100030	31252455

The oxide is grown using a repetitive potential multicycling technique, and the mechanism of the latter hydrous oxide formation process has been discussed. A duplex layer model of the oxide/solution interphase region is proposed. The acid/base behaviour of the hydrous oxide and the microdispersed nature of the latter material has been emphasised. The hydrous oxide is considered as a porous assembly of interlinked octahedrally coordinated anionic metal oxyhydroxide surfaquo complexes which form an open network structure. The latter contains considerable quantities of water molecules which facilitate hydroxide ion discharge at the metal site during active oxygen evolution, and also charge compensating cations. The dynamics of redox switching has been quantified via analysis of the cyclic voltammetry response as a function of potential sweep rate using the Laviron-Aoki electron hopping diffusion model by analogy with redox polymer modified electrodes. Steady state Tafel plot analysis has been used to elucidate the kinetics and mechanism of oxygen evolution. Tafel slope values of ca. 60 mV dec(-1) and ca. 120 mV dec(-1) are found at low and high overpotentials respectively, whereas the reaction order with respect to hydroxide ion activity changes from ca. 3/2 to ca. 1 as the potential is increased. These observations are rationalised in terms of a kinetic scheme involving Temkin adsorption and the rate determining formation of a physisorbed hydrogen peroxide intermediate on the oxide surface. The dual Tafel slope behaviour is ascribed to the potential dependence of the surface coverage of adsorbed intermediates.									66	1	0	0	4	0	67			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000297560200042	22068318

The sample with a CoCO3 content of 26.8 wt % (CoCO3/NCNT-1) exhibits excellent performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte with an overpotential of 58 mV to reach 10 mA cm-2, better than the most nonnoble metal catalysts reported; meanwhile, it exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction. The excellent performance of the catalyst is attributed to the nanotip effect caused by the sea-cucumber-like morphology. Notably, CoCO3/NCNT-1 can attain turnover frequencies of 2.7 s-1 at an overpotential of 50 mV, higher than that of Pt/C (1.5 s-1). A cell constructed using CoCO3/NCNT-1 as the catalyst of the electrode pair needs a low cell voltage of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm-2, superior to most reported cells.

X-ray diffraction study indicated the formation of almost pure spinel ferrite phase with some impurities, which is found basically in the case of Co0.5Fe2.5O4 oxide. The formation of spinel ferrite was also confirmed by recording the IR spectra. The cyclic voltammogram was carried out in the potential region 0.0 - 0.7 V and shows a pair of redox peaks; one an anodic (E-pa = 524 +/- 36) and corresponding cathodic (E-Pc = 351 +/- 6) peak prior to the onset of oxygen evolution reaction. The anodic polarization study showed that the substitution of Co for Fe in the Fe3O4 lattice strongly affects the electrocatalytic properties of the materials. The optimum improvement in the activity is being with 1.0 mol Co-substitution. At E = 850 mV vs Hg/HgO/1M KOH (25 degrees C), the current density with CoFe2O4 (j = 315.6 mA cm(-2)) oxide was about 13 time higher than Fe3O4. The Tafel slope values also decreased from 68 mV decade(-1) to 44 mV decade(-1) with Co-substitution. The thermodynamic parameters have been calculated for the oxide electrode, CoFe2O4, at different potentials. It appears that as the potential is increased, the electrochemical standard enthalpy of activation (Delta H-el degrees(#)) of the oxide is decreased. SE-micrograph indicates that the substitution of Co for Fe decreases the crystallite size of the materials.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1452-3981			WOS:000551732800050

The study showed that Cr-substitution from 0.2 to 1.0 mol increased the electrocatalytic activity of the oxide towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the optimum improvement in apparent electrocatalytic activity being with 0.8 mol Cr. At E = 600 mV versus Hg/HgO in 1 M KOH (25 degreesC), the apparent oxygen evolution current density (j(d)) with the catalyst, CoFe1.2Cr0.8O4, was similar to 80 times greater than that observed with the base oxide (i.e. CoFe2O4). The OER on Cr-substituted oxides showed two Tarel slopes, one (b = 42 +/- 1 mV per decade) at low overpotential and the other (b = 66 +/- 6 mV per decade) at higher potential. The reaction order with respect to OH- concentration was similar to 1.3 +/- 0.1 for each electrocatalyst. The thermodynamic parameters for the OER, namely, standard apparent electrochemical enthalpy of activation (DeltaH(el)(o#)), standard enthalpy of activation (DeltaH(o#)) and standard entropy of activation (DeltaS(o#)) have also been determined. It was observed that values of the DeltaH(el)(o#) and DeltaH(o#) decreased with Cr-substitution in the CoFe2O4 lattice; the decrement, however, being the greatest with 0.8 mol Cr. The DeltaS(o#) values were largely negative varying between similar to - 61 and - 126 J deg(-1) mol(-1).

Herein, a new type of CoMo-LDH ultrathin nanosheet was synthesized as a bifunctional electrocatalyst with both OER and HER activity for full water splitting. Benefiting from the ultrathin structure and the tuned electronic structure by the doping of Mo6+, the catalyst exhibits superior OER performance with an overpotential of 290 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). When acting as a HER catalyst, the catalyst shows a low overpotential of 115 mV achieving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the catalyst also shows bifunctional catalytic activity with a voltage of 1.63 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and exhibits excellent stability for 30 h when used in the full water splitting cell. Thus, the novel CoMo-LDH ultrathin nanosheet provides a guideline for the future design of highly active and bifunctional materials for water splitting.									42	2	0	0	3	0	43			2052-1553			WOS:000453914100028

Herein, we achieved an unprecedented surface morphology and shape tuning to obtain hollow NiCo2P with a continuum of active sharp edges (spiked) on a hollow spherical surface by means of facile hydrothermal treatments. The highly exposed, branched spike covered hollow structure of NiCo2P shows remarkable performance enhancement for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction in a wide range of Ph solutions. This catalytic performance was utilized to assemble a water electrolyzer working in an alkaline environment. In particular, this electrolyzer only requires an output voltage of 1.62 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm -2 and shows almost no decrease in this value even after a continuous surface -engineered NiCo213, establishes to be highly active, cost-effective, and robust toward electrochemical energy conversion. Additionally, the charge storage capabilities of spike -covered hollow NiCo2Px structures is also investigated, and it shows a specific capacitance of 682 and 608 F g' at a current density of 1 A g-' with excellent rate capacitance retention. Thus, the importance of surface engineering of nanocrystalline morphologies in design toward the development of a multifunctional electrocatalyst for efficient water splitting and charge storage applications is demonstrated.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000493869700038	31613589

P	PARK H; SHIN S S; PARK S Y; SHIN H S; PAULSEN J M								Preparing lithium mixed transition metal oxide for lithium secondary battery cathode involves subjecting lithium carbonate and mixed transition metal precursor to solid-state reaction under oxygen-deficient atmosphere					US2008032196-A1	LG CHEM LTD																			NOVELTY - Preparing lithium mixed transition metal oxide involves: subjecting lithium carbonate and a mixed transition metal precursor to a solid-state reaction under an oxygen-deficient atmosphere with an oxygen concentration of (10-50) vol.% to obtain a powdered lithium mixed transition metal oxide. USE - For preparing a lithium mixed transition metal oxide; which is useful as a cathode material for lithium secondary battery (claimed). ADVANTAGE - The method results in lithium mixed transition metal oxide i.e. high-Ni lithium mixed transition metal oxide in powder from by a simple solid-state reaction under an oxygen-deficient atmosphere and using a precursor material that is cheap, environmentally friendly and easy to handle, such as manganese containing material; and enables industrial-scale production of the lithium mixed transition metal oxide with significantly decreased production costs and high production efficiency. Under the oxygen-deficient atmosphere, desorption of some oxygen atoms takes place from the mixed transition metal oxide (MO) layers, which leads to a decrease in an oxidation number of Ni, and increased amounts of Ni2+ ions. As a result, some of the Ni2+ ions are inserted into the reversible lithium layers. However, contrary to conventionally known or accepted ideas in the related art that intercalation/de-intercalation of lithium ions is hindered due to the insertion of Ni2+ ions into the reversible lithium layers, an insertion of an effective amount of Ni2+ ions prevents destabilization of the crystal structure that may occur due to the repulsive force between oxygen atoms in the MO layers, upon charge. Hence, stabilization of the crystal structure is achieved to result in no occurrence of further structural collapse by oxygen desorption. Further, the lifespan characteristics and safety are simultaneously improved, due to no further formation of Ni2+ ions with maintenance of the oxidation number of Ni ions inserted into the reversible lithium layers, even when lithium ions are released during a charge process. The method further enables industrial scale production (such as greater than or equal to5 kg) of the lithium mixed transition metal oxide, using high rate of air circulation. The cathode active material produced by the method is substantially free of Li2CO3, as compared to the prior art processes that contain impurities that are not decomposed in sintering and gas generation, and does not lead to disintegration of secondary particles into single primary crystallites, show high storage stability, and no deterioration of the high-temperature safety resulting from the gas evolution due to the reaction of the residual Li2CO3 with the electrolyte in the battery. As the cathode active material stably maintains the layered crystal structure by a specific composition of transition metal elements and a reaction atmosphere, despite the use of Li2CO3 as a raw material, it is possible to carry out the sintering process at a high-temperature, which results in small amounts of grain boundaries. In addition, as retention of unreacted lithium on surfaces of particles is prevented, the particle surfaces are substantially free of water-soluble bases such as lithium carbonates, and lithium sulfates. Thus, the produced lithium mixed transition metal oxide is substantially free of impurities; and when included in batteries, such as lithium secondary batteries, shows low swelling, and exerts a high capacity and excellent cycle stability, in conjunction with significantly improved storage stability and high-temperature stability. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Preparing a lithium mixed transition metal oxide involves: subjecting Li2CO3 and a mixed transition metal precursor to a solid-state reaction under an oxygen-deficient atmosphere with an oxygen concentration of (10-50) vol.% to obtain a powdered lithium mixed transition metal oxide having a composition of formula LixMyO2 (I).M=M'1-kAk;M'=Ni1-a-b(Ni1/2Mn1/2)aCob;a+b=0.65-0.85;b=0.1-0.4;A=a dopant;k=0-0.05;x+y=2;x=0.95-1.05.															0						DIIDW:2008C45630

Herein, a novel molten salt decomposition method to prepare 3D metal nitrate hydroxide (MNH, M = Ni, Co, and Cu) nanoarrays homogenously grown on different conductive substrates, especially on nickel foam (NF) for OER applications, is reported. Compared with the as-prepared CoNH/NF and CuNH/NF, NiNH/NF presents a superior electrocatalytic OER activity and stability in an alkaline solution, with a very low overpotential of only 231 mV versus a reversible hydrogen electrode to deliver a geometrical catalytic current density of 50 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 81 mV dec(-1), outperforming most reported transition metal compound catalysts. Structural investigation after the OER process reveals the morphology integrity of the nanoarrays but the formation of metal oxyhydroxide (for NiNH and CoNH) or oxide (for CuNH) as the likely real active species. These metal nitrate hydroxide non-noble metal electrocatalysts can be prepared by an economical and simple method, with enhanced intrinsic activity and long-term stability and durability, which might be new candidates for energy conversion and storage applications.									37	2	0	0	2	0	38			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000456505700013	30468561

Herein, we design a three-dimensional Co3O4@NiFe-LDH (LDH: layered double hydroxide) core-shell nanostructure on Ni foam, in which the core Co3O4 nanowires play a key role in the stability and the shell NiFe-LDH nanosheets provide the main active sites for electrocatalytic water splitting. The as-prepared Co3O4@NiFe-LDH exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity for OER with a low overpotential of 269mV at a current density of 100mAcm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 66mVdec(-1), and excellent stability without degradation over 40h. Furthermore, the sample also demonstrates robust performance for HER with a low overpotential of 74mV at a current density of 10mAcm(-2). Most importantly, when employing the Co3O4@NiFe-LDH/NF as both anode and cathode, only 1.56V is needed to achieve a current density of 10mAcm(-2), which is lower than the combination of Pt/C and IrO2 catalysts for overall water splitting. This work provides a significant strategy toward the rational design of novel core-shell electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									31	1	0	0	1	0	31			2196-0216			WOS:000431974500004

By using a sulfite complex-based preparation procedure, an amorphous iridium oxide precursor was obtained at 80 degrees C, which was, successively, calcined at different temperatures: 350 degrees C, 400 degrees C and 450 degrees C. A physico-chemical characterization was carried out by X Ray Diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and X-ray-photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The various IrO2 catalysts were sprayed onto a Nafion 115 membrane with a loading of 2.5 mg cm(-2) to form the anode. A Pt/C catalyst (Pt loading 0.5 mg cm-2) was used as cathode. The best electrochemical performance was obtained for the cell based on the IrO2 calcined at 350 degrees C. The maximum current density at high potentials (1.8 V) was about 1.75 A cm-2. Accelerated time-tests at 2 A cm-2 demonstrated a suitable stability of the IrO2 calcined at 350 degrees C; however, the intrinsic stability appeared to increase with the calcination temperature. The sample calcined at 400 degrees C could represent a good compromise between performance and intrinsic stability. Copyright (C) 2010, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we report that K2Fe4O7 nanocrystals (nano-KFO) are hydrothermally grown on a nickel foam (NF). The formed nano-KFO/NF exhibits good stability and delivers an extremely large current density up to 2000 mA cm(-2) at low overpotentials of 343 mV (HER) and 421 mV (OER) in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. By employing nano-KFO/NF as both cathode and anode, a water electrolyzer can operate over 60 hours at a current density of 1500 mA cm(-2) with cell voltages of 2.01 V in 1.0 M KOH and 1.89 V in 10.0 M KOH, demonstrating the great potential of this bifunctional electrocatalyst for large-scale hydrogen production. Our theoretical calculation reveals that the structure has instinct high catalytic activities for both HER and OER in alkaline media. In addition, the large surface area, good conductivity, and inherent superhydrophilic properties of nano-KFO lead to its highly efficient electrocatalytic water splitting performance.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000635284900021

Herein, the catalytic activity and reaction mechanism for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on bis(iminothiolato)rhodium (RhIT) monolayer have been investigated by means of density functional theory. Our results indicate that *OOH hydrogenation to form *OH + *OH pathway is the kinetically most favourable pathway. The formation of two *OH intermediates is the rate-determining step with an energy barrier of 0.89 eV, close to 0.80 eV for pure Pt catalyst. The calculated working potential is 0.79 V, which is also close to 0.78 V for pure Pt. Thus, RhIT could be a potential ORR catalyst.

Owing to the strong interactions between RuCo2O4 and Ti3C2Tx sheets, which are verified by density functional theory (DFT)-based simulations, RuCo2O4/Ti3C2Tx MXene@NF can serve as a bifunctional electrode for both water splitting and supercapacitor applications. This electrode exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity with low overpotentials of 170 and 68 mV at 100 A m(-2) toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The RuCo2O4/Ti3C2Tx MXene@NF-based alkaline water-splitting cell only requires 1.62 V to achieve a current density of 100 A m(-2), which is much better than that of RuO2@NF and Pt/C@NF-assembled cells (1.75 V@100 A m(-2)). The symmetric supercapacitor (SSC)-assembled electrode displays a high specific capacitance of 229 F g(-1) at 3 A g(-1). The experimental results, complemented with theoretical insights, provide an effective strategy to prepare multifunctional materials for electrocatalysis and energy storage applications.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000741069000001	35014999

Here, a self-supported CoNiO2/Ni0.46Co0.54 hybrid catalyst with an open 3D nanostructure is constructed using electrochemical co-deposition to fabricate the Ni0.46Co0.54 parent alloy followed by a one-step annealing process. This self-supported 3D nanostructure derived by tuning the crystal phase of the parent alloy provides a large surface area and barrier-free electron transport medium. The CoNiO2 with a high ratio of Ni3+ and Co2+ converted from the surface layer of the Ni0.46Co0.54 alloy offers abundant active sites for the highly efficient OER. Moreover, the optimized Ni0.46Co0.54 alloy works synergistically with CoNiO2 to further boost the intrinsic HER performances. The resulting CoNiO2/Ni0.46Co0.54 hybrid catalyst exhibits superior activity with 58 and 195 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER and OER, respectively. Moreover, it requires a quite small cell voltage of 1.51 V to drive 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting and outperforms all the reported catalysts. Impressively, it shows excellent durability at a commercially practical current of 500 mA cm(-2) for 30 h, suggesting promising applications for large-scale hydrogen generation.									9	1	0	0	1	0	9			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000519704200033

Herein, two-dimensional cobalt phosphate hydroxides (Co-5(PO4)(2)(OH)(4)) nanosheets, a unique stacking-disordered phosphate-based inorganic material, are successfully prepared via a facile and scalable method for the first time to serve as a superior and robust electrocatalyst for water oxidation. On the basis of the detailed characterization (e.g., X-ray absorption near-edge structure and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy), the obtained nanosheets consist of special zigzag CoO6 octahedral chains along with intrinsic lattice distortion and excellent hydrophilicity, in which these factors contribute to the highly efficient performance of prepared electrocatalysts for OER. Specifically, (Co-5(PO4)(2)(OH)(4)) deposited on glassy carbon electrode (loading amount approximate to 0.553 mg cm -2 ) can exhibit an unprecedented overpotential of 254 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 57 mV dec(-1) in alkaline electrolytes, which outperforms the ones of CO3(PO4)(2)(370 mV) and Co(OH)(2) (360 mV) as well as other advanced catalysts. Evidently, this work has opened a new pathway to the rational design of promising metal phosphate hydroxides toward the efficient electrochemical energy conversion.									21	1	0	0	0	0	21			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000492802100027	31550123

Therefore, the development of a low-price and highly efficient catalyst is critical to meet the industrial demand. In this work, a unique composite electrocatalyst that cobalt sulfide electrodeposited on NiFe hydroxide nanosheet (NiFe hydroxide@CoS) was reported. The NiFe hydroxide@CoS exhibited a low overpotential of 259 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 45.8 mV dec(-1) and excellent durability in 1 M KOH solution. The enhanced catalytic activity is ascribed to the strong interactions between NiFe hydroxide nanosheet and CoS that modified the electronic structures of the active sites, and the increased active sites after electrodeposition. Therefore, the facile electrodeposition of CoS benefits NiFe hydroxide nanosheet with the enhanced activity toward OER, facilitating the low-cost and stable water electrolysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000782714500006

Herein, we introduce a scalable chemical dealloying procedure to synthesize mutually interacting and stable bifunctional catalysts, consisting of imbedded Ag nanoparticles for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and quantitatively designed multicomponent high-entropy oxides (HEOs) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The ORR performance and the Zn-Ag battery capacity can be precisely controlled by the content of Ag nanoparticles. Impressively, with a significantly low Ag content (similar to 9.13 wt%) in the bifunctional (AlNiCoFeCr)(3)O-4/Ag, our hybrid Zn-Ag/Zn-air batteries using such catalysts are able to be continuously charged/discharged for more than 450 h and deliver a high energy density of 810 W h kg(-1). We expect that these stabilized noble metals in HEO nanocomposites may work as multifunctional electrocatalysts in many other energy conversion devices.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000697265700001	34543369

Here, we report on the combustion rate of hydrogen in supercritical water. The reaction of hydrogen oxidation by oxygen is studied in a flow-through reactor operating under continuous steady state conditions in terms of surface oxidation. Hydrogen released in situ from the metal oxide reactor surface is accounted for in the overall reaction kinetics. Rate constants are presented for 500, 550, and 650 degrees C at 25 MPa. The activation energy for the homogeneous oxidation reaction is estimated to be 96.4 kJ mol(-1). This value is comparable with the activation energies obtained for other small fuel molecules.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1932-7447			WOS:000392035500007

Since the oxygen evolution half-reaction (OER) requires high overpotentials, much research has focused on finding catalyst materials that minimize this energy loss. Oxynitrides with a layered perovskite structure have the potential to combine the superior photocatalytic properties of layered perovskite oxides with enhanced visible-light absorption caused by the band gap narrowing due to less electronegative nitrogen ions. In this paper, we study the OER on the (001) and (100) surfaces of the layered oxynitride Sr2TaO3N using density functional theory (DFT) calculations to obtain the OER free-energy profiles and to determine the required overpotentials at various sites on each surface. We find that the reconstructed grooved (100) surface is most relevant for photocatalysis due to suitable band-edge positions combined with a low overpotential and good carrier mobility perpendicular to the surface.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000507721600006

The activity governing mechanism and products could vary with the catalyst material, which can be described by material descriptor(s), typically the binding strength(s) of key intermediate species. Density functional theory calculations can be used to identify dominant reaction mechanisms. However, the dominant reaction mechanism is sensitive to the choice of the exchange-correlation functional. Here, we demonstrate this using the chlorine evolution reaction on rutile oxides as an example, which can occur through at least three reaction mechanisms each mediated by different surface intermediates and active sites. We utilize Bayesian error estimation capabilities within the BEEF-vdW exchange correlation (XC) functional to quantify the uncertainty associated with predictions of the operative reaction mechanism by systematically propagating the uncertainty originating from DFT-computed adsorption free energies. We construct surface Pourbaix diagrams based on the calculated adsorption free energies for rutile oxides of Ru, Ir, Ti, Pt, V, Sn, and Rh. We utilize confidence value (c value) to determine the degree of confidence in the predicted surface phase diagrams. Using the scaling relations between the adsorption energies of intermediates, we construct a generalized Pourbaix diagram showing the stable surface composition as a function of potential and the oxygen binding energy on the cus site (Delta E-O(c)). This allows us to incorporate consistency between activity and surface stability, which is necessary to determine activity volcano relationships for surface reactivity. We incorporate the uncertainty in linear scaling relations to quantify the confidence in generalized Pourbaix diagram and the associated activity. This allows us to compute the expectation limiting potential as a function of Delta E-O(c),, which provides a more appropriate activity measure incorporating DFT uncertainty. We show that the confidence in the classification problem of identifying the active reaction mechanism is much higher than that for the prediction problem of determining catalytic activity. We believe that such a systematic approach is needed for accurate determination of activities and reaction pathways for multielectron electrochemical reactions such as N-2 and CO2 reduction.									51	1	0	0	2	0	52			2155-5435			WOS:000447224100008

Formation of graphene encapsulated cobalt-iron phosphide nanoneedles as an attractive electrocatalyst for overall water splitting								Catalysis Science & Technology				11	5			1814	26		10.1039/d0cy02170a				2021	2021	The rational design of stable, low cost, and earth-abundant electrocatalysts with advanced compositional and structural superiority is very desirable for water splitting. As an inexpensive and helpful class of materials, metal phosphide (MP) nanostructures present promising applications in water splitting. Herein, a helpful binder-free electrocatalyst derived from CoFe-P nanoneedles encapsulated in a graphene texture on nickel foam (NF) (denoted CFP-G@NF) was rationally fabricated. Such an innovative architecture effectively maximized interfacial contact and conductive properties to enhance charge-mass transfer, boosting the catalytic performance and stability towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). CFP-G@NF exhibits reasonable performance for the HER (small overpotentials of 71, 64, and 161 mV in alkaline, acidic, and neutral solutions at 10 mA cm-2) and the OER in alkaline solution (an overpotential of 400 mV at 60 mA cm-2). Besides, the assembled CFP-G@NF||CFPG@NF water splitting cell reveals a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at a cell voltage of 1.63 V. Most significantly, the encapsulation of graphene texture prevents CoFe-P nanoneedles from corrosion, indicating good durability after 24 h operation.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2044-4753			INSPEC:21061056

Herein, twin-like MOF nanobricks, a quasi-hollow 2D architecture, with multi-metal nodes and replaceable organic ligands, are uniformly and firmly grown on conductive Ni foam through a generic one-pot approach. The formation process of twin-like MOF nanobricks mainly includes selective epitaxial growth of Fe-rich MOF layer and simultaneously dissolution of the pre-formed Ni-rich metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), all of which can be ascribed to a special self-templated mechanism. The fantastic structural merits of twin-like MOF nanobrick arrays, featuring highly exposed active sites, remarkable electrical conductivity, and hierarchical porosities, enable this material for efficient electrocatalysis. Using bimetallic NiFe-MOFs grown on Ni foam as an example, the resultant twin-like nanobrick arrays can be directly utilized as three-dimensional (3D) integrated electrode for high-performance water oxidation in 1 M KOH with a low overpotential, fast reaction kinetics (28.5 mV.dec(-1)), and superb stability. Interestingly, the unstable NiFe-MOFs were served as an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) pre-catalyst and the single-crystalline NiFe-MOF precursor can be in-situ topochemically regulated into porous and low-crystalline NiFeOx nanosheets during the OER process. This work extends the hollowing strategy to fabricate hollow MOFs with 2D architectures and highlights their direct utilization for advanced electrocatalysis.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000714511900001

PV-EC systems are composed of catalysts toward CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), solar cells, and catholyte/anolyte. CO, C2H4, formate, and acetate have been considered as direct target products from solar-driven CO2RR using PV-EC devices. PV-EC systems are reviewed by covering their operating principle and various research activities related to CO2RR/OER catalysts and solar cells with a main focus on their current/current density - voltage (I/J-V) characteristics. By analyzing the PV-EC component materials, the I/J-V characteristics of PV-EC systems, and the corresponding solar-to-fuel efficiency altogether, a comparison between various PV-EC systems would be much easier from an industrial viewpoint. CO is the most popular CO2RR product, and the solar-to-CO efficiency has increased from -6% to -19% in recent years. The solar-toC2H4 efficiency manages to reach 1.5% with a combined solar-to-C2 product efficiency of -3%. The solar-toformate/acetate efficiencies are -7% and -4%, respectively. The effectiveness of using a bipolar membrane, which enables the operation of EC cells adopting electrolytes of different acidity in reducing the EC cell voltage, has not been verified conclusively. A couple of PV-EC systems that are likely to produce CO and C2H4 efficiently and economically are suggested based on their I/J-V characteristics.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000730235600006

Herein, the combination of selenization of Ni foam (NF) and successive electrodeposition growth of CoFe LDH was proposed to synthesize the three-dimensional heterostructure of NiSe nanowires and CoFe LDH nanosheets on NF (NiSe@CoFe LDH/NF) which can enable more accessible active sites, enhanced structural stability, and eliminate contact resistance for OER process. The optimal NiSe@CoFe LDH/NF possesses superior OER performance with ultralow overpotential of 203 and 236 mV to achieve 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), low Tafel slope of 90.3 mV dec(-1) and robust stability in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations unveil that the interfacial synergism on NiSe@CoFe LDH can induce electrons redistribution by charge transfer from CoFe LDH to NiSe, and reduce the energy barrier of deprotonation of OH to O as the rate limiting step by the stronger chemical bond of Fe-O in OER, and thus significantly increase the intrinsic OER activity. Moreover, the two-electrode configuration based on NiSe@CoFe LDH/NF||Pt/C/NF couple for driving water splitting can achieve a current density of 300 mA cm(-2) at an ultralow voltage of 1.69 V with super stability (100 h). This work provides deep insights into the roles of interfacial electronic modulation by fabrication the three-dimensional heterostructure to design high-efficiency electrocatalysts for OER.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773467500005

Herein, we fulfill significant OER improvement in both activity and stability by constructing a class of Ni(OH)(2)-CeO2 supported on carbon paper (NixCey@CP) with an intimate hydroxide (Ni(OH)(2))-oxide (CeO2) interface. Such interface largely promotes the OER activity with a low overpotential of 220 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 81.9 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis shows that the intimate interface induced by the strong electronic interactions between Ni(OH)(2) and CeO2 involves the modulation of binding strength between intermediates and catalysts, making a great contribution to the OER enhancement. Importantly, such intimate interface structures can be largely maintained even after a long-time stability test. We have further demonstrated that, when pairing the Ni4Ce1@CP after phosphorization (P-Ni4Ce1@CP), the Ni4Ce1@CP and P-Ni4Ce1@CP assembly is highly active and stable for overall water splitting with a low voltage of 1.68 Vat 25 mA cm(-2) and negligible stability delay over 30 h of continuous operation, which are much better than the commercial Ir/C and Pt/C.									97	6	0	0	4	0	98			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000436910200124	29763293

However, the high-cost and poor stability of traditional rare-earth metal-based electrocatalysts make it difficult to yield hydrogen economically. Here, we report an efficient and durable film electrocatalyst of N-doped monolayer carbon encapsulated Mo-doped ultrafine Ni nanoparticles anchored on single-wall carbon nanotube network (NMoNi/SWCNT) for total water splitting in an alkaline solution. The single layer carbon prevents oxidation of encapsulated Ni and Mo species and facilitates desired electronic structure modulation to achieve a high catalytic activity. Hence, the freestanding NMoNi/SWCNT film catalyst shows low overpotentials of 255 mV and 130 mV to attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, respectively, with a good stability. More importantly, the NMoNi/SWCNT film only requires a potential of 1.6 V to reach a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) when employed as both anode and cathode for a total water splitting.									29	0	0	0	1	0	29			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000532683200060

The structural design of non-noble metal electrocatalysts is essential for tuning their electrocatalytic properties. Hierarchical nanostructures with hollow architectures can provide rich active sites and transmission channels. In this work, hollow hierarchical Mn-Co-P nanoarrays on a nickel foam substrate are successfully fabricated via a facile two-step hydrothermal synthesis, followed by phosphorization. The resultant hollow hierarchical Mn-Co-P nanoarrays not only exhibit outstanding overall water splitting electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential of 250 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 63 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and a full cell voltage of 1.57 V at 10 mA cm(-2) current density, but also present extraordinary stability in 1.0 M KOH, resulting from the high surface areas and rapid electron transfer ability of hollow hierarchical nanoarrays. These binder free constructed hollow hierarchical Mn-Co-P nanoarrays with high efficiency and good durability are a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for practical application in overall water splitting.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2398-4902			WOS:000741535500001

In this research, a porous CuMoO4@Co3O4 nanosheet electrocatalyst is prepared, which is uniformly decorated on nickel foam (NF) by hydrothermal reactions and the impregnation method. The CuMoO4@Co3O4 is an efficient bifunctional catalyst with prominent electrocatalytic activity and durability. It requires overpotentials of only 54 and 251 mV to obtain current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm(-2) for the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1.0 mol L-1 KOH, corresponding to Tafel slope values of 98.8 and 87.4 mV dec(-1), respectively. Furthermore, the CuMoO4@Co3O4 shows excellent stability of 120 h chronopotentiometry at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) for the HER/OER. Notably, an alkaline electrolyzer (with CuMoO4@Co3O4 as the HER and OER electrodes) can deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low voltage of 1.51 V. The catalytic activity of CuMoO4@Co3O4 can be attributed to the structure of the porous nanosheets and the synergistic effect between CuMoO4 and Co3O4.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000838177600001	35946555

To further improve the reaction rate, well-defined heterostructures based on plasmonic gold nanoparticles on MXene Ti3C2Tx nanosheets (Au NPs@Ti3C2Tx) were rationally designed and systematically investigated to improve the performance of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The results demonstrated that the catalysis performance of the Au NPs@Ti3C2Tx system could be easily tuned by simply varying the concentration and size of Au NPs, and Au NPs@Ti3C2Tx with an average Au NP diameter (similar to 10 nm) exhibited a 2.5-fold increase in the oxidation or reduction current compared with pure Ti3C2Tx. The enhanced OER performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the plasmonic hot hole injection and Schottky junction carrier trapping. Owing to easy fabrication of Au NPs@Ti3C2Tx, the tunable size and concentration of Au NPs loaded on MXene nanosheets, and the significantly enhanced OER, it is expected that this work can lay the foundation to the design of multidimensional MXene-based heterostructures for highly efficient OER performance.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000642344900050	33787232

The deposited film reported an overpotential of 247 and 245 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) toward the HER and OER, respectively. A least squares procedure was performed to fit a theoretical current density model with experimental linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) results, and the chemical reaction rate constants for the OER and HER steps were identified. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were taken at different potentials, and the resulting kinetic model demonstrates a good agreement between theoretically calculated faradaic resistance and experimental EIS results. The HER results indicated the Heyrovsky step as rate controlling, with a dependence of reaction mechanism on potential. At low potential, the mechanism begins with a Volmer step, followed by parallel Tafel and Heyrovsky steps. At higher potential, the mechanism becomes consecutive combination of the Volmer and Heyrovsky steps. The OER data point to the formation of the adsorbed peroxide as rate controlling. The HER and OER kinetic data were combined into a model capable of predicting the electrolysis cell current-potential characteristics, which can be used for process design and optimization.

Herein, we adopt a simple electrodeposition method to synthesize amorphous nickel sulfide electrocatalysts. Through altering the added amounts of electroplating bath consisting of NiCl2 and thiourea (TU), the HER electrocatalytic activity in alkaline electrolyte of these nickel sulfides can be optimized, and it exhibits a low overpotential of 130 mV at a current density of -10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 91 mV dec(-1), and high electrochemical stability. The experimental analysis and density functional theory calculations suggest that the excellent electrochemical activity is ascribed to the coordination regulation of Ni nanostructures decorated with sulfur and oxygen anions. These findings demonstrate a simple and effective method to explore high efficiency electrocatalysts to HER.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000647276600001

Herein, the Ni-Co-O-C-P hollow tetragonal microtubes grown on 3D Ni foam (Ni-Co-O-C-P/NF) was synthesized via a one-step solvothermal method and followed by a simple carbon coating and in situ phosphorization treatment. Benefiting from the unique open and hierarchical nano-architectures, the as prepared Ni-Co-O-C-P/NF presents a high activity and durability for both the HER and OER in alkaline media. The overall-water-splitting reaction requires a low cell voltage (1.54 V @ 10 mA cm(-2)) in 1 M KOH when Ni-Co-O-C-P/NF is used as both the anode and cathode. The highly flexible structure can provide a large amount of exposed active sites and shorten the mass transport distance. Furthermore, bimetallic phosphides also favor the electrocatalysis due to the higher electronic conductivity and the synergetic effect. This work demonstrated a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for water electrolysis in alkaline media with potential in future applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2046-2069		WOS:000483541000013	35530997

Due to the high specific surface area of honeycomb-like structure, the exposed Co-Mn active sites and the pyridine-N and graphitic-N, the prepared 3%Co-Mn/silk cocoon carbon materials (3%Co-Mn/SCC) exhibits good hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with a low onset potential of 121 mV, a low overpotential of 155 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 130 mV.dec(-1) as well as a long-term stability in acidic electrolyte. Meanwhile, the 2%Co-Mn/SCC also shows great oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in 1 mol.L-1KOH with the lowest onset potential 1.5 mV and a Tafel slope of 143 mV.dec(-1).

Here, using single-crystalline thin films as model electrocatalysts, the structure-activity relationship of Fe states doping in perovskite LaNiO3 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is studied. Fe4+ state is found to be crucial for enhancing the OER activity of LaNiO3, dramatically increasing the activity by six times, while Fe3+ has negligible effect. Spectroscopic studies and DFT calculations indicate Fe4+ states enhance the degree of Ni/Fe 3d and O 2p hybridization, and meanwhile produce down-shift of the unoccupied density of states towards lower energies. Such electronic features reduce the energy barrier for interfacial electron transfer for water oxidization by 0.2 eV. Further theoretical calculations and H/D isotope experiments reveal the electronic states associated with Fe4+-O2--Ni3+ configuration accelerate the deprotonation of *OH to *O (rate-determining step), and thus facilitate fast OER kinetics.									17	0	0	0	0	0	16			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000624583000001	33656259

The cobalt diselenides with two typical morphologies (agaric-like and nanorod-like) were synthesized by precisely controlling reaction time and temperature in the same system. They show excellent electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reactions. Especially, the agaric-like diselenide cobalt electrode has the low overpotential (187 and 199 mV) to obtain the current density of 50 and 100 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 37 mV dec(-1) in acidic medium. The excellent catalytic performance of the agaric-like cobalt diselenide can be attributed to its large specific surface area and fast electron transfer rate. More importantly, the agaric-like cobalt diselenide supported carbon nanofiber electrode has excellent long-term stability in electrolyte. The outstanding electrocatalytic performance and stability of agaric-like cobalt diselenide supported carbon nanofiber indicate that it is a promising electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reactions.

However, the efficiency is limited by their low conductivity and thus carbonization is usually required. Herein, we report a new strategy by covalently linking cobalt(III) corrole and cobalt(II) porphyrin onto a semiconducting fluoro-graphdiyne (F-GDY) film through nucleophilic substitution reaction. The crystalline F-GDY film was prepared by Glaser-Hay coupling at the water/dichloromethane interface, followed by ultrasonic-assisted exfoliation in liquid. The Co(III) corrole-tethered F-GDY material exhibited excellent four-electron ORR activity, with a halfwave potential of 0.875 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode). It also displayed high discharge performance and capacity in a zinc-air battery device, superior to the commercial Pt/C.

Significantly, metallic-phase and defect-abundant nanosheets are synthesized from SL-exfoliated molybdenum disulphide (SL-MoS2), exhibiting the desired morphological features with a high percentage of monolayers and uniform planar size. Additionally, SL-MoS2 has the excellent structural features of a metallic phase and abundant defects, thereby supporting high activity during the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Nevertheless, the unique structural and morphological characteristics of SL-MoS2 are proved to cause the rapid dissociation of the SL-MoS2 nanosheets in H2O2-rich environments, and the electrocatalytic performance accordingly declines. The HER current density, which is dependent on the number of active sites of SL-MoS2, specifically reflects the reactive-oxygen-species-based degradation of the SL-MoS2 nanoprobes; this can contribute to the electrochemical monitoring of enzyme-associated biological targets and processes using developed chips based on SL-MoS2-modified carbon fibers.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000643893300001

Herein, by employing large-scale density functional theory computations, we demonstrate that atomically dispersed bi-atom catalysts (BACs) could act as a versatile design platform to achieve efficient electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (OER), and ORR activity. Through regulating bi-atom combinations on a g-CN substrate, a materials genome containing 26 homonuclear and 253 heteronuclear BACs (M-2/g-CN and MIMII/g-CN) is built. Eight, one and three BACs go beyond the activity benchmark of Pt(111) and IrO2(110) surfaces and have excellent performance for the HER, OER, and ORR, respectively. Especially, PdNi/g-CN and AgPt/g-CN exhibit a negligible potential barrier for the HER. AuRh/g-CN shows a small overpotential of 0.35 V for the ORR. AgPd/g-CN has promising bifunctional activity for both the OER and ORR with small overpotentials of 0.43 and 0.48 V respectively. AuCo/g-CN reveals tremendous trifunctional activities (with an overpotential of 0.05 V for the HER, 0.52 V for the OER, and 0.48 V for the ORR). A kinetic simulation further verifies their catalytic performance. Finally, a machine-learning technique is employed to establish the internal relationship between the HER/OER/ORR, and identify the key characteristic factors that govern the catalytic performance including the geometry parameters of the M-M-N-6 (M-I-M-II-N-6) moiety. This work not only provides a comprehensive view of BACs for water splitting and the ORR, but also presents a new path for designing and searching for efficient BACs toward electrochemical reactions.									3	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000793390900001

Herein, ultrasmall molybdenum-oxygen (MoOx) clusters are developed as a novel non-noble cocatalyst, which significantly promotes the photocatalytic hydrogen generation rate of CdS nanowires (NWs). As indicated by extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis, direct bonds are formed between CdS NWs and MoOx clusters, which guarantee the migration of photo-generated charge carriers. Moreover, the MoOx clusters induce deep electron trap states owing to the unique atomic arrangement and configuration with the generation of long-lived electrons to enhance the activity. These findings may guide the design of efficient cocatalytic materials for solar water splitting and open a new avenue toward practical applications of ultrasmall clusters.									197	9	0	0	15	0	197			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000459630600006	30556181

However, the ways for regulation of spin states of catalysts are still limited, and the underlying relationship between the spin states and catalytic activities remains unclear. Herein, for the first time, by taking Ni-II-based compounds without high or low spin states for example, it is shown that their spin states can be delocalized after introducing structural distortion to the atomic layers. The delocalized spin states for Ni atoms can provide not only high electrical conductivity but also low adsorption energy between the active sites and reaction intermediates for the system. As expected, the ultrathin nanosheets of nickel-chalcogenides with structural distortions show dramatically enhanced activity in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution compared to their corresponding bulk samples. This work establishes new way for the design of advanced electrocatalysts in transitionmetal- based compounds via regulation of spin states.									690	29	0	0	29	0	690			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000407048800028	28593650

Herein, aiming to simultaneously bolster the HER and OER kinetics, a metal-organic framework (MOF) mediated topotactic transformation tactic is deployed to fabricate holey ternary CoFeNi LDHs on nickel foam, exposing polygonal mesopores with atomistic edge steps and lattice defects. The optimized catalyst requires only an external voltage of 1.49 V to afford the water splitting current density of 10 mA cm(-2) apart from the superb electrolytic stability, far surpassing the benchmark Pt/C||RuO2 couple. More importantly, mechanistic investigations utilizing advanced spectroscopies in conjunction with density function theory (DFT) understandings unravel while the synergetic effect among under-coordinated metal centers lowers the energy barrier of water dissociation, Fe-doping enables further modulating the d-band density of states (DOS) of Co and Ni in favor of intermediates binding, thereby promoting the intrinsic HER activity. Operando Raman studies reveal negligible structural change of the LDHs during the HER process, whereas for OER the active sites can quickly turn into oxyhydroxides in the presence of lattice defects and under-coordinated metal centers.									79	5	0	0	1	0	80			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000588659800001	33184955

Here we adopted microwave-assisted method to synthesize Vulcan XC-72 supported Fe-Co Sulfide (FeCoS2/XC-72) and then investigated its electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline medium. FeCoS2/XC-72 exhibits overpotential of only 230 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Notably, the overpotential is only 350 mV even the current density increases up to 100 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, FeCoS2/XC-72 retains 90.5% of its initial current density after continuously 10-h OER working at the potential corresponding to 20 mA cm(-2) in 1M KOH electrolyte, which demonstrates much better stability than most reported Co-based electrocatalysts. This indicates it can be a promising OER electrocatalyst thanks to its excellent performances.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1293-2558	1873-3085		WOS:000487809800019

In this study, we successfully prepared a series of NdCuOx@CN catalysts via encapsulating bimetallic NdCuOx nanoparticles into nitrogen doped carbon (CN), which combines the advantages of rare-earth-transition bimetallic oxides and CN. And we obtained an optimal ORR catalyst (NdCuOx@CN-1000) by exploring the ratio of NdCuOx to aniline in the precursors and carbonization temperature. The optimal NdCuOx@CN-1000 catalyst yields comparable ORR activity to commercial Pt/C catalyst and exhibits excellent stability as well as tolerance to methanol crossover. This excellent performance is attributable to the formation of encapsulated structure and CN composite. Simultaneously, synergistic effect between different components in the catalyst also boosts the ORR performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Catalysts play a valuable role in water splitting, especially the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, we report a Fe-doped Co3V2O8 nanoparticle catalyst (iron-rich V-Co-Fe), which possesses outstanding OER catalytic activity with eta(j) = 10 mA cm(-2) = 307 mV, and a low Tafel slope of 36 mV dec(-1), benefiting from a large degree of amorphization, a rich porous structure and a high specific surface area (about 232.1 m(2) g (-1)). More remarkably, the catalytic performance of the V-Co-Fe catalyst is markedly superior to commercial ruthenium oxide. In addition, the durability of the V-Co-Fe catalyst is fine. The current density collapses by less than 3 percent at 1.55 V vs. RHE after 11 h in comparison to the initial value. Moreover, this work reveals that the V-Co-Fe catalyst displays an excellent performance in both OER catalytic activity and stability, and may have the potential to be the ideal substitute for noble metal-based catalysts for water splitting to obtain affordable clean energy.									98	3	0	0	3	0	100			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000360049900033

In this work, the Fe/C@CNT carrier that the carbon-coated Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles (iron-carbon heterostructure) uniformly growing on carbon nanotube (CNT) is obtained via the fast pyrolysis (only 3 min) of ferrocene on CNT with efficient microwave thermal effect. The unique heterostructure improves the dispersity and stability of Ni, Ru-based compounds on Fe/C@CNT carrier during the fast preparation progress of Ni-Ru@Fe/C@CNT catalyst and the subsequent catalytic reaction processes, and promotes the formation of efficient active sites for HER (Ru (0)) and OER (Ni (3 +)). Therefore, Ni-Ru@Fe/C@CNT shows robust bifunctional activity and enduring stability, and just needs the low overpotential about 32 mV and 246 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER, respectively, which are better than the Ni-Ru-Fe@CNT using smooth CNT as carrier and even far superior to the commercial Pt/C and RuO2. More importantly, the whole preparation process of Ni-Ru@Fe/C@CNT is fast, simple and lowcost, providing a facile and environment friendly strategy to rapidly prepare efficient catalysts.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000707037200074

In view of the increasing demand for chemical commodities and specialties linked to the growth of the world's population and the living standards, highly efficient and low-cost catalysts are urgently required. The metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) catalysts family is one of the most promising candidates. In this work, a series of benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate linker based metal organic frameworks (MOFs) were used as self-sacrificial templates and tunable platform for designable preparation of M-N-C catalysts. Changing the pillars between the 2D layers and the nature of the metal ions in the pristine MOFs significantly influenced the structure, chemical composition and catalytic activity of the resulting M-N-C catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Furthermore, the influence of the MOF units on the catalyst performance, the role of the metals in the M-N-C catalysts and the primary catalytically active sites for ORR were explored by a combination of density functional theory (DFT), in-depth structural and chemical/ elemental characterizations, and electrochemical studies. Among the prepared catalysts, Co-BTC-bipy-700 exhibited the highest electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which showed a larger limiting current density and similar half-wave potentials with less catalyst degradation and much higher methanol tolerance than the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Meanwhile, as a bifunctional electrocatalyst, Co-BTC-bipy-700 catalyst was also employed for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and demonstrated a lower overpotential (lowered by 140 mV at a current density of 10mA cm(-2)) and better durability than IrO2. Furthermore, in terms of device performance, the Zn-air battery enabled by Co-BTC-bipy-700 catalyst reached a maximum specific energy as high as 1009.8 Wh kg(-1), which is 76.5% of the theoretical value (1320Wh kg(-1)), and demonstrated higher discharge potential and lower charge potential than that based on the Pt/C catalyst. Importantly, the presented strategy for tailor-made M-N-C catalysts by controlling the synthesis of the pristine MOFs could offer a guide map for the future design of M-N-C catalysts family not only for electrochemical reactions but also beyond electrochemistry.									45	1	0	0	2	0	45			2405-8297			WOS:000456689500006

Understanding the detailed mechanism and kinetics of this reaction is important for the development of robust catalysts with improved efficiency. TiO2 is one of the best-known photocatalysts as well as a model system for the study of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here we use hybrid density functional based energetic calculations and first-principles molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the pathway and kinetics of the OER on the majority (101) surface of anatase TiO2 in a water environment. Our results show that terminal Ti-OH groups are stable intermediates at the aqueous (101) interface, in accord with the experimental observation that OH radicals are efficiently produced on anatase. Oxidation of Ti-OH gives rise to a second stable intermediate, a surface-bridging peroxo dimer ((O-2(2-))(br)) composed of one water and one surface lattice oxygen atom, consistent with the surface peroxo intermediates revealed by "in situ" measurements on rutile. Our calculations further predict that molecular oxygen evolves directly from (O-2(2-))(br) through a concerted two-electron transfer, thus leading to oxygen exchange between TiO2 and the adsorbed species. Oxygen exchange is found to be negligible on rutile, so that different OER pathways are likely to be operative on the two main TiO2 polymorphs. This difference could explain the observed lower OER activity of anatase relative to rutile.									62	1	0	0	5	0	62			2155-5435			WOS:000379457300087

However, pure cobalt selenide has by far still exhibited catalytic activity far below what is expected. Herein, this paper for the first time reports the synthesis of new monoclinic Co3Se4 thin nanowires on cobalt foam (CF) via a facile one-pot hydrothermal process using selenourea. When used to catalyze the OER in basic solution, the conditioned monolithic self-supported Co3Se4/CF electrode shows an exceptionally high catalytic current of 397 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential (eta) of 320 mV, a small Tafel slope of 44 mV dec(-1), a turnover frequency of 6.44 x 10(-2) s(-1) at eta = 320 mV, and excellent electrocatalytic stability at various current densities. Furthermore, an electrolyzer is assembled using two symmetrical Co3Se4/CF electrodes as anode and cathode, which can deliver 10 and 20 mA cm(-2) at low cell voltages of 1.59 and 1.63 V, respectively. More significantly, the electrolyzer can operate at 10 mA cm(-2) over 3500 h and at 100 mA cm(-2) for at least 2000 h without noticeable degradation, showing extraordinary operational stability.									216	10	0	0	9	0	217			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000409410000004

Herein, a lattice distortion nickel-molybdenum sulfide electrocatalyst on foam nickel (NiMoS4-12/NF) has been synthesized through a novel, simple, and effective crystalline-amorphous strategy. The electrocatalyst only requires 1.47 V to obtain 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting (OWS) and can function stably for 100 h at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2), demonstrating an excellent electrocatalytic performance and stability. From the results of the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR), it can be seen that the (104) crystal lattice of NiMoS4-12 undergoes interface strain under the crystalline-amorphous state, resulting in rich sulfur defects caused by lattice distortion, which could improve the intrinsic catalytic activity of NiMoS4-12. According to the differential charge density analysis, around the sulfur defects, the Mo and Ni atoms with abundant lone pairs of electrons acted as libraries of lone pairs of electrons to enable an efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). From the total density of states (TDOS) and the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (Delta G(H*)), the libraries of lone pairs of electrons not only effectively optimized the distribution of the surface electron density of states at the Fermi level, but also reduced the Delta G(H*), thereby improving the intrinsic HER electrocatalytic performance. The in situ Raman test results demonstrate that during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the surface of the nickel molybdenum sulfide was reconstructed, and highly active Ni-OOH was generated. From the calculated free energy diagrams, the Ni-OOH could optimize the reaction barrier of the rate-determining step (RDS) for the OER to enhance the slow oxygen evolution reaction kinetics. This work will contribute to the rational design of a 2d-TMSs electrocatalyst, as well as investigation of the catalytic mechanism.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000741090500001	35018403

Herein, we synthesize a FeWO4-WO3 heterostructure catalyst growing on nickel foam (FeWO4-WO3/NF) by a combination of hydrothermal and calcination method. It shows good catalytic activity with ultralow potentials for OER (eta(10) = 1.43 V, eta(1.000) = 1.56 V) and HzOR (eta(10) = -0.034 V, eta(1.000) = 0.164 V). Moreover, there is little performance degradation after being tested for 100 h at 1,000 (OER) and 100 (HzOR) mA.cm(-2), indicating good stability. The superior performance could be attributed to the wolframite structure and heterostructure: The former provides a high electrical conductivity to ensure the electronic transfer capability, and the later induces interfacial electron redistribution to enhance the intrinsic activity and stability. The work offers a brand-new way to prepare good performance catalysts for OER and HzOR, especially at large current density.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000658997200001

The MOF arrays have exhibited excellent structural characteristics for electrochemical reactions, including ultrathin architecture, metallic conductivity, and hierarchical macro-/micro-porosity. Particularly, 2D nickel, iron-MOF arrays act as bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting, which deliver a current density of 500 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 305 mV for anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), 359 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and similar to 640 mV for overall reactions. The electrode also shows prolonged stability against bulk water splitting (up to 20 h at 500 mA cm(-2)). In addition, the water splitting system has been further coupled with commercial solar cells to simulate natural water photolysis, demonstrating a high solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 17.69%. Mechanism study thorough density function theory (DFT) computations shows strong synergistic effect between Ni and Fe active sites that can reduce the Gibbs energy barrier of hydroxyl dissociation step (OH* -> O*) during OER and H* desorption step during HER simultaneously. These promising results open up enormous opportunities of designing versatile low-dimensional conductive MOF architectures for renewable energy applications.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000636271000001

The results showed that the presence of fluoride ions contributed to a smoother anodic layer with lower PbO2 concentration, which resulted in lower double layer capacity and higher charge transfer resistance for the oxygen evolution reaction. Consequently, the Pb-Ag anode showed a higher anodic potential (about 35 mV) in the fluoride-containing electrolyte. In addition, the fluoride ions accelerated the detachment of loose flakes on the anodic layer. It was demonstrated that the anodic layer formed in the fluoride-containing H2SO4 solution was thinner. Furthermore, fluoride ions aggravated the corrosion of the metallic substrate at interdendritic boundary regions. Hence, the presence of fluoride ions is detrimental to oxygen evolution reactivity and increases the corrosion of the Pb-Ag anode, which may further increase the energy consumption and capital cost of zinc plants.									8	5	0	0	0	0	12			1047-4838	1543-1851		WOS:000360229700018

Herein, we found a convenient, simple method to prepare porous Ni-Co oxide/carbon nanoparticles via a simple heat treatment of Ni(NO3)(2)6H(2)O, Co(NO3)(2)6H(2)O and Tween-85, a polysorbate surfactant with a boiling point above 100 degrees C. And the obtained porous Ni-Co oxide/carbon nanocomposites possess high activity and good durability for the OER in alkaline solution. The catalyst exhibits good stability for a current density of 10mA cm(-2) for 2h and low Tafel slope of 54mV per decade for OER. The following electrochemical and physical characterizations demonstrate that the high OER activity of the hybrid catalysts arises from the synergistic effect between Ni-Co bimetallic oxide and carbon.									12	1	0	0	1	0	12			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000460643200106

Here, using a combined in situ/operando experiments and theory, the catalytic mechanism of the ordered OER active Co and Ir ions in Sr2CoIrO6-delta is studied, which exhibits an unprecedented low overpotential 210 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2), ranking the highest performance among perovskite-based solid-state catalysts. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopies as a function of applied voltage indicates that Ir4+ ion is gradually converted into extremely high-valence Ir5+/6+, while the part of Co3+ ion is transferred into Co4+ under OER process. Density functional theory calculations explicitly reveal the order Co-O-Ir network as an origin of ultrahigh OER activity. The work opens a promising path to overcome the sluggish kinetics of OER bottleneck for water splitting via proper arrangements of the multi-active sites in catalyst.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000680519300001

Herein, an efficient in situ etching-deposition growth strategy is employed to transform pristine two-dimensional (2D) Co-metal-organic frameworks into hollow Ni/Co double hydroxide arrays (denoted as Ni/Co-DH), which not only yields a larger surface area and exposes more active sites but also decreases the activation energy to the OER. With structural and compositional benefits, the Ni/Co-DH exhibits high performance with an overpotential of 229 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and exceptional long-term stability of over 90 h in 1 M KOH medium for OER, comparable to most non-noble oxygen evolution catalysts reported so far. In addition, a two-electrode Ni/Co-DHIIPt/C electrolyzer also requires a considerably low voltage of 1.58 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting. This study affords a rational strategy to develop water-alkali electrolyzers with great complexity for large-scale water-splitting systems.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000733839500001	34914388

Herein, we fabricated a free-standing electrocatalyst in the form of vertically oriented Fe-doped Ni3S2 nanosheet array grown on three-dimensional (3D) Ni foam (Fe-Ni3S2/NF), which presented a high activity and durability for both HER and OER in alkaline media. On the basis of systematic experiments and calculation, the Fe-doping was evidenced to increase the electrochemical surface area, improve the water adsorption ability, and optimize the hydrogen adsorption energy of Ni3S2, which resulted in the enhancement of HER activity on Fe-Ni3S2/NF. Moreover, metal sites of Fe-Ni3S2/NF were proved to play a significant role in the HER process. During catalysis of OER, the formation of Ni Fe (oxy)hydroxide was observed on the near-surface section of Fe-Ni3S2/NF, and introduction of the Fe element dramatically enhanced the OER activity of Ni3S2. The overall water splitting electrolyzer assembled by Fe-Ni3S2/NF exhibited a low cell voltage (1.54 V @ 10 mA cm(-2)) and a high durability in 1 M KOH. This work demonstrated a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for water electrolysis in alkaline media with potential application in the future.									350	14	0	0	11	0	353			2155-5435			WOS:000434369600071

In spite of considerable success in obtaining relatively high solar conversion efficiency, the main drawbacks hindering practical application of hematite are its intrinsically hampered charge transport and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics on the photoelectrode surface. In the present work, we report a strategy that synergistically addresses both of these critical limitations. Our approach is based on three key features that are applied simultaneously: i) a careful nanostructuring of the hematite photoanode in the form of nanorods, ii) doping of hematite by Sn4+ ions using a controlled gradient, and iii) surface decoration of hematite by a new class of layered double hydroxide (LDH) OER co-catalysts based on Zn-Co LDH. All three interconnected forms of functionalization result in an extraordinary cathodic shift of the photocurrent onset potential by more than 300 mV and a PEC performance that reaches a photocurrent density of 2.00 mA cm(-2) at 1.50 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode.									28	3	0	0	2	0	28			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000434961400018	29644796

The corresponding apparent quantum yield (AQY) of O-2 evolution was measured as high as 30.7% under 420 nm light irradiation, a new record AQY for BiVO4. The high-index facets are not only energetically favorable for water dissociation, but also exhibit an obvious reduction in the overpotential (0.7-1.0 V) for the oxygen evolution reaction.									21	2	0	0	1	0	21			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000468003200003	30951063

However, the role of oxygen in the evolution mechanism of SiC surface at atomic scale has not been comprehensively elaborated. Here, we reveal the manipulation effect of oxygen on the competitive growth of thermal oxidation SiO2 (TO-SiO2) and thermal chemical vapor deposition SiO2 (TCVD-SiO2) on the 4H-SiC substrate at 1500 degrees C. TO-SiO2 is formed by the thermal oxidation of SiC, in which the substrate undergoes layer-by-layer oxidation, resulting in an atomically flat SiC/TO-SiO2 interface. TCVD-SiO2 growth includes the sublimation of Si atoms, the reaction between sublimated Si atoms and reactive oxygen, and the adsorption of gaseous SixOy species. A relatively high sublimation rate of Si atoms at SiC atomic steps causes the transverse evolution of the nucleation sites, leading to the formation of nonuniform micron-sized pits at the SiC/TCVD-SiO2 interface. The low oxygen concentration favors TCVD-SiO2 growth, whose crystal quality is much better than that of TO-SiO2 due to the high surface mobility in the thermal CVD process. We further achieve the epitaxial growth of graphene on 4H-SiC in an almost oxygen-free reaction atmosphere. Additionally, ReaxFF reactive molecular dynamic simulation results illustrate that the decrease in oxygen concentration can promote the growth kinetics of SiO2 on single crystal SiC from being dominated by thermal oxidation to being dominated by thermal CVD.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000597774500003

Here, we report a heterostructure Ni(OH)(2)/ZrO2 catalyst made in one step using a simple alcohol thermal method that has the same onset potential (0.84 V) and overpotential (390 mV) as 20% Pt/C, abundant active sites, low Tafel slope (57 mV dec(-1)), good stability and excellent methanol tolerance. Moreover, we found that ZrO2 has a great influence on Ni(OH)(2) through its abundant oxygen vacancies and inhibits the oxidation of Ni2+. However, the nature of its excellent catalytic performance is still unclear, so we analyzed it using a density functional theory (DFT) calculation. In particular, we studied the heterostructure Ni(OH)(2)/ZrO2 due to the simultaneous adjustment of composition and geometric structure, the abnormal synergistic effect of charge transfer and heterostructure interface and stabilized O radicals using ZrO2, which promoted the spontaneous progress of the Ni(OH)(2)/ZrO2 ORR, thereby improving the catalytic performance. This work not only provides new insights for the development of low-cost catalysts with excellent ORR performance but also successfully combines experiments and theory to reveal fully the reaction mechanism of heterostructure Ni(OH)(2)/ZrO2, and provides a new idea for the design of high-activity industrial ORR catalysts.(C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0009-2509	1873-4405		WOS:000779581200008

However, its sluggish hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process greatly limits its practical applications. Here, we develop a NiFeAu LDH with Au atoms partially substituting Fe atoms via a simple one-step hydrothermal process to improve its HER performance. Experimental results reveal that electronegative Au atoms change the electronic structure of the NiFe LDH, resulting in enhanced conductivity and facile electron transfer. The NiFeAu LDH affords superior HER activities with a low overpotential of 89 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and even exhibits a low overpotential of 192 mV at a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, its OER performance is also greatly improved, with overpotentials of 181 mV and 267 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2). Consequently, when the NiFeAu LDH is used as both a cathode and an anode for overall water splitting, only 1.57 V battery voltage is needed to reach 10 mA cm(-2).									29	2	0	0	1	0	29			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000547719400030

In this work, surface galvanic formation of Co-OH on K0.45MnO2 (KMO) was achieved via the redox reaction of hydrated Co2+ with crystalline Mn4+. The synthesis method takes place at ambient temperature without using any surfactant agent or organic solvent, providing a clean, green route for the design of highly efficient catalysts. The redox reaction resulted in the formation of ultrathin Co-OH nanoflakes with high electrochemical surface area. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirmed the changes in the oxidation state of the bulk and surface species on the Co-OH nanoflakes supported on the KMO. The effect of the anions, such as chloride, nitrate and sulfate, on the preparation of the catalyst was evaluated by electrochemical and spectrochemical means. XPS and Time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) analysis demonstrated that the layer of CoOxHy deposited on the KMO and its electronic structure strongly depend on the anion of the precursor used during the synthesis of the catalyst. In particular, it was found that Cl- favors the formation of Co-OH, changing the rate-determining step of the reaction, which enhances the catalytic activity towards the OER, producing the most active OER catalyst in alkaline media.

Here, in situ growth of Fe2+-doped layered double (Ni, Fe) hydroxide (NiFe(II,III)-LDH) on nickel foam with well-defined hexagonal morphology and high crystallinity by a redox reaction between Fe3+ and nickel foam under hydrothermal conditions is reported. Benefiting from tuning the local atomic structure by self-doping Fe2+, the NiFe(II,III)-LDH catalyst with higher amounts of Fe2+ exhibits high activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as well as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. Moreover, the optimized NiFe(II,III)-LDH catalyst for OER (O-NiFe(II,III)-LDH) and catalyst for HER (H-NiFe(II,III)-LDH) show overpotentials of 140 and 113 mV, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 m KOH aqueous electrolyte. Using the catalysts for overall water splitting in two-electrode configuration, a low overpotential of just 1.54 V is required at a benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, it is demonstrated that electrolysis of the water device can be drived by a self-powered system through integrating a triboelectric nanogenerator and battery, showing a promising way to realize self-powered electrochemical systems.									79	5	0	0	4	0	79			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000481804700001	31423746

The in situ Raman technology was used to identify the role of oxygen vacancy and the structure evolution of catalysts. The physicochemical characterizations suggest that pure Ce-Fe-O solid solution is formed for the samples with relatively low Fe content (x <= 0.3). When further increasing Fe content, free Fe2O3 nanoparticles are detected. The Ce0.6Fe0.4O2-delta catalyst displays the best activity due to the dominated role of free Fe2O3 nanoparticles. However, the Ce0.6Fe0.4O2-delta catalyst is more sensitive to the space velocity, and higher space velocity significantly reduces the activity, owing to the low concentration of oxygen vacancies. It is also found that the activity of Ce0.6Fe0.4O2-delta catalyst continuously decreases during the long-term testing due to the growth of surface Fe2O3 particles. The in situ Raman experiment suggests that the oxygen vacancy concentration decreases with reaction temperature. The comparison on the evolution of Raman spectra under different atmospheres indicates a possible reaction mechanism: the methane firstly adsorbs and reacts with the reducible species (e.g., free Fe2O3 clusters or surface oxygen species) on catalyst, and then the gas phase oxygen replenishes the defects (i.e., reduced iron species or oxygen vacancies) to close the redox process.					4th China-USA Symposium on Energy4th China-USA Symposium on Energy	JUN 25-27, 2017JUN 25-27, 2017	Natl Nat Sci Fdn China; Int Assoc Hydrogen Energy, ACS Energy & Fuel Div; Int Assoc Hydrogen Energy, Hydrogen Storage DivNatl Nat Sci Fdn China; Int Assoc Hydrogen Energy, ACS Energy & Fuel Div; Int Assoc Hydrogen Energy, Hydrogen Storage Div	Shanghai Univ, Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINAShanghai Univ, Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA	39	3	0	0	5	0	41			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000448949300012

Herein, graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with numerous graphitic edges are chosen as supporting material to hybridize with nitrogen atoms and cobalt oxide (Co3O4) through a simple one-step hydrothermal reaction. With a high edgeto-plane ratio, the GNR sheets could increase the accessibility of N-atom doping into the graphene edges to form active ORR sites, and be also interconnected with each other to form a conductive network, thus facilitating the fast electron transfer. The intimate contacts between Co3O4 nanoparticles and nitrogen-doped GNRs (N-GNRs) along with the porous structure impart the N-GNR/Co3O4 hybrid with excellent ORR performance, which leads to a comparable onset-potential to commercial Pt/C catalyst but larger current density, better long-term stability and superior tolerance to crossover effects.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			2199-692X			WOS:000387680000007

Transition metal oxide catalysts have shown high activity for the OER in alkaline medium, however, they are generally inactive for the HER. Here, we report an aliovalent fluorine anion substitution and anodization-induced amorphization strategy to enhance the HER activity of CoO and concomitantly obtain the optimal OER performance. Aliovalent fluorine anions at O2- sites significantly induce the charge redistribution of neighboring Co sites, facilitate water dissociation and weaken hydrogen adsorption, enabling the optimal states for the HER. More importantly, the anodization causes F-leaching-assisted amorphization, which leads to the formation of a highly catalytic shell for the OER. When using F-CoO as the bifunctional catalyst, a low cell voltage of 1.53 V is observed to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to that of noble-metal-based Pt/C-IrO2. This work provides a novel strategy of aliovalent fluorine anion substitution to dramatically activate transition metal oxides for overall water splitting.									20	0	0	0	2	0	20			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000538143000018

Herein, catalytically active metastable monoclinic-phase Co3Se4 nanorods supported on carbon hybrids of reduced graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes (Cu-14-Co3Se4/GC) were selectively prepared by adding Cu(II) ions to the precursors that were successively treated by a hydrothermal process and thermal annealing at 300 degrees C, while only low-activity orthorhombicphase CoSe2 nanorods were obtained without the addition of Cu(II) ions. The resulting grape-bunch-like Cu-14-Co3Se4/GC sample contained a trace amount of Cu element and showed efficient trifunctional activities, with an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential of 280 mV and impressively the highest half-wave potential of +0.782 V (i.e., E-ORR,E-1/2) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in 0.1 M KOH as well as the lowest hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) overpotential of 166 mV among the Co3Se4 composites reported to date at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. Moreover, a voltage difference (Delta E) of only 0.680 V was observed between the potential for OER at 10 mA cm(-2), (E-OER,E-10) and E-ORR1/2 in 1.0 M KOH, and merely 1.620 V was required to reach 10 mA cm(-2) in overall water splitting. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements and theoretical simulations reveal the evident change of the electronic state after incorporation of Cu atoms onto Co-Se skeletons. Density functional theory calculations suggest that upon structural transformation from orthorhombic CoSe2 to monoclinic Co3Se4, the Gibbs free energies of the rate-determining steps were significantly reduced from 0.43 to 0.22 eV for ORR, from 2.64 to 1.90 eV for OER, and from 1.08 to 0.23 eV for HER, mainly accounting for the high catalytic activities of Cu-14-Co3Se4/GC. Besides, the presence of abundant open-channel nanocavities in three-dimensional grape-bunch-like Cu-14-Co3Se4/GC helps maximize the exposure of active sites and facilitates mass diffusion, while the GC networks improve electrical conductivity, hence expediting the electrocatalysis process. The results in the present work highlight the importance of structural engineering in electrocatalysis and may pave an avenue for the preparation of low-cost, efficient, and multifunctional electrocatalysts.									68	2	0	0	7	0	69			2155-5435			WOS:000502169900018

Herein, we identify a relationship between the atom-projected density of states of surface oxygen and its ability to make and break bonds with the surrounding metal atoms and hydrogen. This structure-property relationship is shown to hold across different classes of materials (metals, rutile metal-oxides, and perovskite metal-oxides) and for different oxygen binding sites (Le. different oxygen coordination numbers). We utilize understanding from the d-band model and the simple two-level quantum coupling problem to shed light on the physical origin of this relationship for transition metal surfaces and we hypothesize similar principles extend to the other materials considered. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the identified descriptor to serve as a tool for high throughput screening of oxygen active sites for large systems where many unique oxygen sites exist and can be computationally expensive to probe individually. As an example, we predict the reactivity of 36 unique oxygen atoms at a kinked RuO2 extended surface from a single self-consistent DFT calculation.									93	5	0	0	5	0	93			0039-6028	1879-2758		WOS:000460496100019

Basically, oxide materials intrinsically possess a semiconducting nature; therefore, tuning conducting properties is important in achieving high electrocatalytic activity. Here, black TiO2 nanotube arrays deposited with RuO2 by pulsed electrodeposition are investigated as a three-dimensional supporting electrode for chlorine and hydrogen evolution. RuO2-loaded black titania achieves high chlorine evolution activity (10 and 100 mA cm(-2) at 1.090 and 1.125 V vs. SCE) with a faradaic efficiency of 95.25% while RuO2-loaded titania has no activity, though hydrogen evolution reaction performance is similar. This suggests that the type of titania support affects the conducting property at anodic potentials and chlorine evolution activity. This work provides new insights into the importance of black titania materials in enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of anodic reactions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The slow cycling voltammetry (CV) of CoTMPP electrode shows irreversible O-2 reaction instead of Co/Ni electrode where the capacity of oxygen evolution reaction is about 3 times less than of the oxygen reduction reaction. Nevertheless, the obtained reversibility at slow CV, the galvanostatic cycling tests at 1 mA shows irreversibility of the process most probably to the very high polarization at that current.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0324-1130			WOS:000342409900020

Herein, we for the first time synthesized an efficient Mn-based (oxy)hydroxide catalyst through MnSe as an intermetallic phase. As iron was further incorporated into the MnSe, the MnFeSe electrode showed an outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity (an overpotential of 247 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and reaction kinetics (a Tafel slope of 35 mV dec(-1)). The MnFeSe was electrochemically converted to Se-incorporated MnFe (oxy)hydroxides under oxidative potential during the OER. Remarkably, the novel Mn-based multi-metal catalyst was applied to BiVO4 for solar-driven water splitting. The resulting photoelectrode exhibited a current density of 4.85 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE in 1 M KBi under AM 1.5G illumination. More importantly, a 20 h durability was achieved owing to avoiding the photocorrosion of BiVO4, which is so far the best PEC performance using a highly active Mn-based cocatalyst compared to the common MnOx. Further DFT calculations on models of MnSe, MnFeSe, MnOOH, Se,Fe-MnOOH, MnO2, and Se,Fe-MnO2 explained well the OER/PEC experimental results. This work developed a new strategy for designing and exploring advanced cocatalysts for a practical solar-driven water splitting system.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000599249300040

A single inexpensive solid precursor, phosphorus pentoxide, is combined with common saccharides in a stepwise multiple templating process for 2D construction, phosphorus doping, and regulated micro-/mesopore creation. This reliable 2D porous carbon production technique can potentially be utilized in a variety of energy storage and conversion fields. The effects of different porous structures on the electrocatalytic activity of 2D-PPCN based electrocatalysts are specifically investigated in this work. The interconnected open-pore system and high specific surface area result in a high catalytic efficiency for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). When integrated into an air breathing cathode for rechargeable Zn-air batteries, the best-performing 2D-PPCN demonstrates better cell performance than a noble metal benchmark catalyst and a higher durability with over 1000 charge-discharge cycles.									126	8	0	0	2	0	127			2155-5435			WOS:000426804100094

It has higher electrical conductivity and more suitable energy level for oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution than pure TiO2 due to the presence of Ti3+ species. The unique electronic structure and strong metal-support interaction make it a candidate support for Pt-based electrocatalyst. Carbon is universal as support of Pt based electrocatalyst. However, it is restricted to the poor durability and bad methanol tolerance. On the contrary, the chemical stability of nitrogen-doped TiO2 contributes to the higher durability and methanol tolerance of Pt/Nx:TiO2, than Pt/C catalyst. Monodisperse Pt nanoparticles are loaded on Nx:TiO2-x by a facile borohydride reduction method. The Pt/Nx:TiO2-x hybrid shows better oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity with the half wave potential of 0.78 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) than Pt and good hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with 19 mV onset overpotential, similar to Pt/C catalyst. More importantly, Pt/Nx:TiO2-x catalyst has robust durability and higher methanol tolerance than Pt/C catalyst. All these electrostatic performances stem from the suitable energy level for ORR and HER and the strong interaction between Pt and Nx:TiO2-x support. This hybrid material is a promising candidate for the fuel cell in the future. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			0925-8388	1873-4669		WOS:000395839100083

Herein, we describe a facile wet-chemical method to directly grow a series of coralloid trimetallic oxyhydroxides on arbitrary substrates such as nickel foam (NF) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The amount of iron in these oxyhydroxide sponges on NF and CNTs was precisely controlled, revealing that the electrocatalytic activity of the WCoFe trimetallic oxyhydroxides depends on the Fe amount in a volcano-like fashion. The optimized W0.5Co0.4Fe0.1/NF catalyst exhibited an overpotential of only 310 mV to deliver a large current density of 100 mAcm(-2) and a very low Tafel slope of 32 mVdec(-1). It also showed superior stability with negligible activity decay after use in the OER for 21 days (> 500 h). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the addition of Fe leads to an on average lower Co oxidation state, which contributes to the enhanced OER performance.									183	11	0	0	10	0	185			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000398154000016	28322493

Monolithic Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets are fabricated through a facile hydrothermal oxidation procedure of commercial Ni foam. And Ni2P, Ni2S3 and NiSe2 nanosheets are obtained by subsequent low-temperature phosphorization, sulfurization and selenization of the monolithic Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets, respectively. The resultant monolithic materials can be directly employed as self-supported electrodes for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media, especially, Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets for OER and Ni2P nanosheets for HER, respectively, revealing their versatile and practical nature for hydrogen production. Moreover, a well water electrolyzer through a matched electrode pair with Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets as anode and Ni2P nanosheets as cathode can achieve a water splitting current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.64 V, and maintains this current density as least 48 h without evident decay in 1.0 mol L-1 KOH electrolyte.

In situ/operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a powerful technique with the potential of revealing the electronic and geometric structure of nanoparticulate electrocatalyst systems under gas-evolving conditions, thereby providing vital insight into the nature of the catalytic active site in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on oxide-based electrocatalysts. This article provides an overview detailing the recent applications of operando XAS as applied to the OER for state-of-the-art acid membrane and alkaline electrolyte systems. In doing so, we portray the fundamental studies that have assisted in the identification of key reactive species participating in the OER for IrO2-based acidic electrolyte systems and those that have aided in elucidating the role of Fe in Fe-Ni oxide alkaline electrolyte systems.									46	1	0	0	1	0	47			2451-9103			WOS:000424679700004

Here, a carbon-based bifunctional catalyst of magnetic catalytic nanocages that can direct enhance the oxygen catalytic activity by simply applying a moderate (350 mT) magnetic field is reported. The catalysts, with high porosity of 90% and conductivity of 905 S m(-1), are created by in situ doping metallic cobalt nanodots (approximate to 10 nm) into macroporous carbon nanofibers with a facile electrospinning method. An external magnetic field makes the cobalt magnetized into nanomagnets with high spin polarization, which promote the adsorption of oxygen-intermediates and electron transfer, significantly improving the catalytic efficiency. Impressively, the half wave-potential is increased by 20 mV for ORR, and the overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) is decreased by 15 mV for OER. Compared with the commercial Pt/C+IrO2 catalysts, the magnetic catalyzed Zn-air batteries deliver 2.5-fold of capacities and exhibit much longer durability over 155 h. The findings point out a very promising strategy of using electromagnetic induction to boost oxygen catalytic activity.									67	5	0	0	5	0	66			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000599604500001	33336466

It is reported that RuO2 has higher OER catalytic activity, while IrO2 possesses better electrochemical stability during the OER process in acid. Therefore, many combined strategies have been proposed to utilize the advantages of both IrO2 and RuO2 catalysts in water electrolysis applications. In this article we describe how, by tuning the wet-chemical synthesis process in which the Ir precursor is added after the synthesis of RuO2 nanoparticles (NPs) (two-step), the Ru0.5Ir0.5O2 NPs have been synthesized to improve the OER catalytic activity in both acidic and alkaline media. In detail, the specific OER activity of the Ru0.5Ir0.5O2 NPs (with a particle size of ca. 10 nm) is 48.9 mu A cm(-2) at an overpotential eta = 0.22 V (vs. RHE) and 21.7 mu A cm(-2) at eta = 0.27 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M HClO4 and 0.1 M KOH, respectively. These values are higher than those for the one-step (Ir-0.5+Ru-0.5)O-2 NPs (obtained by contemporaneously adding both Ru and Ir precursors), which are 19.5 and 15.5 mu A cm(-2) at the same measuring conditions, respectively. Additionally, with more IrO2 component distributed on the particle surface, the two-step Ru0.5Ir0.5O2 NPs show better OER catalytic stability than RuO2 NPs. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The efficient water decomposition electrocatalysts need both intrinsic activities determined by electronic structure and superb mass transfer ability. For this, in the contribution, an efficient self-supported bi-functional catalyst, i.e., nanoscale hetero Mo2C-CoO encapsulated in N-doped carbon nanofibers (Mo2C-CoO@N- CNFs), is designed and fabricated with facile electrospinning avenue. Density functional theory and electro-chemical investigation manifest that the synergistic effect of bimetallic Mo/Co accelerates kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and lowers the energy barrier of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Thanks to the structural and compositional merits, the optimized integrated Mo2C-CoO@N-CNFs film demonstrates remarkable catalytic activities in both OER and HER, and renders a current density of 10 mA cm(-2 )at 1.56 V when used for alkaline whole water cracking.

The work discussed here focused on time-resolved in situ XAS investigations aiming, first, at understanding structural evolution under dynamic conditions and, second, at revealing properties of the system studied not available from investigations under stationary conditions. In order to demonstrate the potential of TR-XAS in heterogeneous catalysis, TR-XAS investigations combined with mass spectrometry of the structural evolution of Keggin type heteropolyoxomolybdates (HPOM) during thermal treatment in propene and in propene and oxygen in the temperature range from 300 K to 773 K are presented. It is concluded, that the undistorted Keggin ion in the as-prepared HPOM has to be regarded as a precursor of the active catalyst, while the formation of lacunary Keggin ions is a prerequisite for catalytic activity.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0031-8949			INSPEC:9558916

However, noble metal-based catalysts for the ORR and OER always suffer from high cost and poor stability. Carbon-based materials with many advantages such as low cost, good conductivity, a large specific surface area and considerable durability are considered as promising alternatives to noble metal-based catalysts. In particular, the doping of heteroatoms into carbon has been proven to be an effective method to improve catalytic performance. Herein, we synthesized N, F, P ternary doped macro-porous carbon fibers (NFPC) as a bifunctional catalyst for primary and rechargeable Zn-air batteries for the first time via an electrospinning method with subsequent thermal annealing. The uniform distribution of heteroatoms in the macroporous carbon fibers induced a greatly improved catalytic efficiency towards the ORR and OER, showing exceptional properties in Zn-air systems.									154	20	0	0	7	0	158			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000439389100033

Excellent performance depends largely on the clever design of nano-architectures and smart hybridization of active components. It is also very important to establish the relationship between structure and performance of materials. Form perspectives of chemical composition and nanostructure, we developed a novel heterostructure of Ni-3-S-2@CoMoS4/NiFeOOH coaxial nanorods on NF scaffold, in which the two-dimensional CoMoS4 nanoplates and ultrathin NiFeOOH nanosheets vertically coil around the Ni3S2 nanorods by hydrothermal reaction combined with electrodepostion process. Such hierarchical nanorods can provide the heterointerface with highly open surface, ensuring the maximization of synergistic interaction. This heterostructure results in prominent bifunctional activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline water electrolysis systems, and HER coupled with urea oxidation reaction in urea electrolysis devices. It exhibits very low cell voltages for alkaline water splitting (1.732 V) and urea electrolysis (1.660 V) to afford a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in the two-electrode system as well as excellent long-term stability. Our work provides a new construction for combining various active materials to competitive bifunctional electro-catalysts applied in energy-relative electrochemical devices.

In the synthesis, Co2+ ions were firstly coordinated with 8-hydroxy quinoline (8-HQ) to form a sheet-like precursor (Co-HQ). Then, the CoP/NCS was obtained by controllable phosphorization of Co-HQ precursor. The electrochemical test indicated that CoP/NCS can be used as a bifunctional catalyst to catalyze hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M KOH. For HER, the CoP/NCS can drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (eta 10) at a low overpotential of 71 mV. The catalyst also shown the good activity for OER with the onset overpotential of 254 mV, and eta 10 of 313 mV. The cell assembled by using CoP/NCS as both cathode and anode needed a cell voltage of 1.63 V to achieve current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The results also indicated that the catalytic activity of CoP/NCS is related to the suitable conductivity and surface areas. The interaction between carbon sheets and CoP particles is also favorable for improving the performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, a series of V-doped LaCoO3 (V-LCO) OER electrocatalysts with optimized d-band centers are fabricated. When utilized as an electrode for the OER, as-formed LaCo0.8V0.2O3 (V-LCO-II) requires an overpotential of only 306 mV to drive a geometrical catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, at a given overpotential of 350 mV, the OER current density of V-LCO-II is about 22 times that of pure LaCoO3 (LCO) nanoparticles. Tailoring of the d-band center by V doping facilitates the adsorption of OER intermediates and promotes the formation of amorphous active species on the surface of LCO through the exchange interaction between high-spin V4+ and low-spin Co2+. This work may create new opportunities for developing other highly active OER catalysts through d-band center engineering.									23	2	0	0	0	0	23			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000520753200001	31965761

In this work, ternary (NixFey)(2)P nanoplates arrays on 3D self-supported nickel foams were prepared through a simple coelectrodeposition followed by phosphorization. The synthesized (NixFey)(2)P nanoplates arrays showed remarkable bifunctional electrocatalytic performances in the KOH electrolyte, with the Tafel slopes of 57.8 mV.dec(-1) and 53.6 mV.dec(-1), and low overpotentials of 115 mV and 182 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively. In addition, the optimized (Ni0.66Fe0.33)(2)P anode and cathode demonstrated outstanding ability for overall water splitting in the two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer, generating a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at the applied cell voltage of 1.61 V. This benefited by the active surface to expedite reactants absorption, faster electron transport in the solid-liquid interface and reduced charge-transfer resistance due to the bimetallic synergistic effect. This delicate design of bifunctional transition metal phosphides provides a potential approach to realize water reuse and energy regeneration by the full water splitting. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the most active transition metal phosphides, CoP, has been tested for its stability and operability under mild conditions that it may be exposed to in its applications (photoelectrochemistry and artificial photosynthesis). Surface-interrogation scanning electrochemical microscopy (SI-SECM) revealed that CoP HER catalyst is vulnerable to oxidation (by oxygen and chemical oxidants). The degradation mechanism was shown to be surface oxidation by dioxygen, followed by acid etching of the oxidized layer. The compositional integrity (unity ratio of cobalt and phosphorus) was maintained throughout the film decomposition progress.									9	2	0	0	2	0	11			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000407988600055	28726380

Although a single-atom catalyst with maximum utilization per metal atom shows great promise, its catalytic performance is still far from satisfactory. Here we tackle this challenge by introducing a P-O bond to update the intrinsic activity of a single-atom site and thus reduce the reaction overpotential of the Zn-air battery. The critical role of the P-O bond in producing a favorable surface electronic environment of the single-atom metal site and improving its catalytic activity is identified with density functional theory simulations. The P-O-doped, atomically dispersed catalyst is shown experimentally to deliver excellent bifunctional performance, with a remarkable half-wave potential of 0.89 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs RHE) for oxygen reduction reaction and a reversible oxygen electrode index of 0.74 V, exceeding those of most reported nonprecious metal catalysts. When subjected to practical application, both aqueous and all-solid-state Zn-air batteries illustrate superior power density and robust cyclic performance, confirming their potential feasibility in next-generation electronic devices.									35	4	0	0	1	0	36			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000486360500048	31419105

Results showed that REE treatment could induce the generous expression of LhcII b in A. thaliana and increase the content of light-harvesting complex II and its trimer on the thylakoid membrane significantly. Meanwhile, the light absorption in the red and blue region and fluorescence quantum yield near 683 nm were obviously increased; oxygen evolution rate was greatly improved too, suggesting that REEs could enhance the efficiency of light absorption, regulate excitation energy distribution from photosystem I (PSI) to PSII, and thus increase the activity of photochemical reaction and oxygen evolution accordingly. The efficiency order of the four treatments was Ce3+> Nd3+> La3+> control.									16	2	0	0	12	0	16			0163-4984	1559-0720		WOS:000267102300005	19221699

The Co, N, P-PCNS exhibited prominent oxygen reduction performance with a positive half-wave potential (E-1/2 = 0.87 V) alternative to commercial Pt/C (E-1/2 = 0.84 V) in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, coupled with a low overpotential (eta = 319 mV) for oxygen evolution at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline circumstance (i.e., 1.0 M KOH). Impressively, the as-assembled Zn-air battery attained remarkable peak power density of 101.3 mW cm(-2) at a potential of 0.71 V.

This study investigates the complex morphology and behavior of reactive species in nanosecond laser-produced uranium plasmas. Comparing plasma morphology in various inert and reactive ambient gases provides information about the role of gas-phase chemistry in plume hydrodynamics. Background gases including nitrogen and argon foster collisional interactions leading to more significant plume confinement and the increase in persistence of uranium species. On the other hand, environments containing reactive gases such as oxygen promote chemical reactions between the plasma and ambient species. By comparing the expansion dynamics of uranium plumes in nitrogen, air, and argon, we discover that chemical reactions modify the hydrodynamics of the plume at later times of its evolution in the air background. Furthermore, we observe that varying the concentration of oxygen in the fill gas promotes different reaction pathways that lead to the formation of uranium oxides. The reaction pathways from atoms to diatomic to polyatomic molecules strongly vary with ambient oxygen concentration. Lower oxygen concentrations enhance the formation of uranium monoxide from atomic uranium, whereas higher oxygen concentrations tend to depopulate both atomic uranium and uranium monoxide concentrations through the formation of more complex uranium oxides.									16	0	0	0	5	0	16			1070-664X	1089-7674		WOS:000483876800005

Herein, we report NiCo-NiCoO2 heterostructures embedded in N-doped carbon (NiCo-NiCoO2@NC) as an efficient bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting in alkaline media. Partially reduced nickel and cobalt interfaced with nickel cobalt oxide result from thermal decomposition of nickel cobalt double hydroxide precursors encapsulated in high surface area carbon. Bimetallic thin film NiCo-NiCoO2@NC exhibits a synergy of two active metals - Ni and Co, achieving remarkably small onset potentials of 0 and 200 mV, and overpotentials of 94 and 318 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively, and achieving TOFs at eta = 500 mV more than 2-fold of Pt/C in the HER and IrO2 in the OER. Momentously, a water electrolyzer that achieves 20 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.44 V is fabricated by utilizing cheap non-precious NiCo-NiCoO2@NC as anode and cathode catalysts simultaneously. Thanks to the protective carbon coating and the mutual aid of Ni-Co alloy and NiCoO2, NiCo-NiCoO2@NC maintains 20 mA cm(-2) for at least 50 h in alkaline media without trivial activity losses. The prominent synergetic and structural effects have been extensively discussed to shed light on the overall water splitting electrocatalyst design.									81	3	0	0	0	0	81			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000406672400048

Herein, we demonstrate an efficient strategy for constructing a Pt nanoparticle-decorated Ni3S2 microrod array supported on Ni foam (Pt/Ni3S2/NF) by electrodeposition of Pt nanoparticles on hydrothermally synthesized Ni3S2/NF. The Pt/Ni3S2/NF heterostructure array exhibits an extremely low overpotential of 10 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), surpassing that of commercial Pt/C and representing the best alkaline HER catalysts to date. Impressively, at an overpotential of 0.15 V, Pt/Ni3S2/NF displays a Pt mass activity and a normalized current density (against the electrochemical surface area) of 5.52 A mg(-1) and 1.84 mA cm(-2), respectively, which are 8.8 and 15.3 times higher compared to those of Pt/C, respectively. In addition, this electrode also shows much enhanced catalytic performance and stability in neutral media. Such enhanced HER activities are attributed to the constructed interface in the Pt/Ni3S2 heterostructure array, which synergistically favor water dissociation and subsequent hydrogen evolution, which is supported by density functional theory calculations.									21	2	0	0	1	0	21			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000569268800033	32805829

On the basis of the metal nodes (clusters) and organic linkers, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their derivatives are rapidly gaining ground in the fabrication of electrocatalysts, with promising catalytic activity and sound durability in OER, thanks to their controllable pore structures, abundant unsaturated active sites of metal ion, extensive specific surface area, as well as easily functionalized/modified surfaces.

Ru- and Ir-based materials are benchmark electrocatalysts towards the OER, yet the precious metals are expensive and scarce. Herein, we develop a kind of Ru-doped NiFe-based catalyst with three-dimensional nanoporous surface (NP-Ru-x), which fulfils both performance and cost requirements for the OER electrocatalysis. This novel material can directly work as a support-free electrode and exhibits excellent OER performance with an ultralow overpotential of 245 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 15 mV dec(-1) as well as low charge transfer resistance. The superior performance could be rationalized as follows: (1) Generated Ru-rich nanoporous architecture can not only supply a large number of active sites but also facilitate mass transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface; ( 2) Multiple metals (hydro)oxides generated on the surface have the synergistic catalytic effect for the OER; (3) The in-situ generation of (hydro)oxides and the firm bonding of nanoporous layer and the substrate allow for easy electron transfer. These features make NP-Ru-x a promising oxygen-evolving electrode material toward water electrolysis.

Replacement of platinum with inexpensive and stable electrocatalysts remains a major bottleneck hampering large-scale hydrogen production by using clean and renewable energy sources. Here, we report electrocatalytically active and ultra-stable Polymer-Derived Ceramics towards HER. We successfully prepared ultrathin silicon and carbon (Si-C) based ceramic systems supported on electrically conducting 2D reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets with promising HER activity by varying the nature and the composition of the ceramic with the inclusion of nitrogen, boron and oxygen. Our results suggest that oxygen-enriched Si-B-C-N/rGO composites (O-SiBCN/rGO) display the strongest catalytic activity leading to an onset potential and a Tafel slope of -340 mV and similar to 120 mV dec(-1) respectively. O-SiBCN/rGO electrodes display stability over 170 h with minimal increase of 14% of the overpotential compared to similar to 1700% for commercial platinum nanoparticles. Our study provides new insights on the performance of ceramics as affordable and robust HER catalysts calling for further exploration of the electrocatalytic activity of such unconventional materials.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2045-2322			WOS:000601310400016	33319809

In spite of the wide scope of studies carried out on TMDB in the physical field, investigations on its electrochemistry remain limited. Since the physical properties play a vital role in any material's electrochemical behaviour, we explore the viability of the most popular form of titanium boride, layered TiB2, as catalysts for electrochemical energy reactions, including hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction. Three types of TiB2 were compared in this work - TiB2 separately modified with sodium naphtalenide and butyllithium in an attempt to exfoliate TiB2 and unmodified TiB2. The electrocatalytic activity displayed by all three TiB2 materials provides a wider range of opportunities for the application of TiB2 in material studies.									24	1	0	0	0	0	26			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000358207700035	26137856

Functional evolution of photochemical energy transformations in oxygen-producing organisms								FUNCTIONAL PLANT BIOLOGY				36	6			505	515		10.1071/FP09087				2009	2009	Chlorophyll a is the photochemical agent accounting for most oxygenic photosynthesis, that is, over 99.9% of photosynthetic primary activity on Earth. The spectral and energetic properties of chlorophyll a can, at least in part, be rationalised in terms of the solar spectral output and the energetics of oxygen production and carbon dioxide reduction with two photochemical reactions. The long wavelength limit on in vivo chlorophyll a absorption is probably close to the energetic limit: longer wavelengths could not support a high rate and efficiency of oxygenic photosynthesis. Retinal, a beta-carotene derivative that is the chromophore of rhodopsin, acts not only as a sensory pigment, but also as an ion-pumping photochemical transducer. Both sensory and energy-transforming rhodopsins occur in oxygenic phototrophs, although the extent of expression and the function of the latter are not well understood.									28	1	0	0	25	0	29			1445-4408	1445-4416		WOS:000267247200004	32688665

However, developing efficient, earth-abundant electrocatalysts that can survive under harsh corrosive conditions for a long time is still a significant technical challenge. Herein, the fabrication of a self-supported nickel-iron phosphosulfide (NiFeSP) nanotube array electrode through a two-step sulfurization/phosphorization approach is reported. The as-obtained NiFeSP nanotubes comprise abundant NiFeS/NiFeP heterointerfaces and under-coordinated metal sites, exhibiting outstanding activity and durability for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) in simulated alkaline-seawater solution (KOH + NaCl), with an overpotential of 380 (HER) and 260 mV (OER) at 500 mA cm(-2) and outstanding durability of 1000 h. Theoretical calculations support the observed outstanding performance, showing that the heterointerface and under-coordinated metal sites synergistically lower the energy barrier of the rate-determining step reactions. The NiFeSP electrode also shows good catalytic performance for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). By coupling UOR with HER, the bifunctional NiFeSP electrode pair can efficiently catalyze the overall urea-mediated alkaline-saline water electrolysis at 500 mA cm(-2) under 1.938 V for 1000 h without notable performance degradation.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000824106500001

Herein, a novel top-down strategy to realize a hierarchical branched Mo-doped sulfide/phosphide heterostructure (Mo-Ni3S2/NixPy hollow nanorods), by partially phosphating Mo-Ni3S2/NF flower clusters, is proposed. Benefitting from the optimized electronic structure configuration, hierarchical branched hollow nanorod structure, and abundant heterogeneous interfaces, the as-obtained multisite Mo-Ni3S2/NixPy/NF electrode has remarkable stability and bifunctional electrocatalytic activity in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 m KOH solutions. It possesses an extremely low overpotential of 238 mV at the current density of 50 mA cm(-2) for OER. Importantly, when assembled as anode and cathode simultaneously, it merely requires an ultralow cell voltage of 1.46 V to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), with excellent durability for over 72 h, outperforming most of the reported Ni-based bifunctional materials. Density functional theory results further confirm that the doped heterostructure can synergistically optimize Gibbs free energies of H and O-containing intermediates (OH*, O*, and OOH*) during HER and OER processes, thus accelerating the catalytic kinetics of electrochemical water splitting. This work demonstrates the importance of the rational combination of metal doping and interface engineering for advanced catalytic materials.									271	16	0	0	14	0	274			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000532297600003

The dynamic migration mechanism of organic oxygen during coal pyrolysis was explored by heat-up ReaxFF molecular dynamics simulations. A multicomponent molecular model for Fugu subbituminous coal was simulated in the temperature range of 300-2500 K with a heating rate of 1 K/ps using the GMD-Reax software. The difference between the pyrolysis products yields and their oxygen content indicates that organic oxygen in Fugu coal migrates preferentially into gas-phase oxygen during pyrolysis. Molecules of CO2, H2O, CH2O, and CO are identified as major O-containing gas products and their generation sequence shows consistency with reported experimental observations. CH2O molecules are produced mainly from cleavage of alkyl-alkyl ethers and their secondary cracking reactions will lead to their decrease trend and contribute partially to the rapid production of CHO radicals at high temperatures. The phenolics and carbonyl groups are found as the dominant functionalities in asphaltene and tar. The cleavage of alkyl-aryl and aryl-aryl ethers contributes to the production of phenolics that transform into carbonyl groups at higher temperatures through isomerization of aromatic rings. The decrease of phenolics and increase of carbonyl groups in the fast pyrolysis stage should be attributed mainly to the structure transformation reactions rather than migration among different pyrolyzate lumps of gas, tar, and asphaltene. This work suggests that ReaxFF MD simulation is useful for exploring the comprehensive dynamic migration mechanism of organic oxygen in coal pyrolysis.									6	1	0	0	0	0	7			0165-2370	1873-250X		WOS:000663089300008

Mesoscopic restructuring and mass transport of metal atoms during reduction of the Ag(111)-p(4x4)-O surface with CO								JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS				126	8					084707	10.1063/1.2483919				FEB 28 2007	2007	The reduction of the Ag(111)-p(4x4)-O surface oxide with CO was used to study the restructuring of the surface during reaction. Scanning tunneling microscopy images taken during the reaction show the formation of Ag islands and pits within the reacted areas surrounded by unreacted p(4x4)-O. The number of Ag adatoms incorporated in the Ag(111)-p(4x4)-O structure was determined to be 12 from the areas of these islands and pits. The evolution of the reacted area with exposure to CO indicates that direct reaction with the Ag(111)-p(4x4)-O is not preferred, but that the boundary between the p(4x4) and the freshly created Ag(111) surface is the source of the reactive oxygen.(c) 2007 American Institute of Physics.									25	0	0	0	3	0	25			0021-9606			WOS:000244530900037	17343469

This study designed a unique ordered three-dimensional (3D) core-shell nanostructure bifunctional ORR and OER electrocatalysts consisting of Co nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in S, N co-doped carbon nanotubes (S,N-Co@CNT). The prepared S,N-Co@CNT exhibited excellent bifunctional electmcatalytic performance, with a high half-wave potential of 0.874 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) toward ORR, and a low overpotential of 276 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) for the OER. The unique core-shell nanostructure has delivered considerable durability and stability in the S,N-Co@CNT, demonstrating almost no change in the potential gap between the ORR and OER after more than 5000 cycles of the accelerated durability test. Moreover, the S,N-Co@CNT serves as a high-active and low-price air-cathode catalyst for a rechargeable zinc-air battery, with a high peak power density of 171 mW.cm(-2), and a long continuous charging-discharging ability. Based on mechanistic studies, the high activity of the S,N-Co@CNT was derived from the suitable oxygen adsorption energy due to the effects from S, N co-doping. The outcomes from this study offer a novel strategy to prepare non-noble metal bifunctional oxygen catalysts for metal-air batteries.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000693417600002		
B	Graham, D.J.								The Influence of Intramolecular Proton Relays on Catalysis								The Influence of Intramolecular Proton Relays on Catalysis								166 pp	166 pp						2015	2015	Global energy demand is predicted to increase at an alarming rate over the next century; in order to meet this demand while also limiting the effects of runaway climate change, society will need to shift toward renewable sources of energy. Many of the fundamental chemical transformations that store renewable energy as fuel require the addition or removal of protons. Optimization of catalysts that carry out these transformations can be achieved with proton management at the molecular level. Deliberate construction of molecular catalysts with an intramolecular proton relay is one strategy for controlling the movement of protons during catalysis. These so-called "hangman" catalysts have been shown to increase the rate of catalysis in the cases of hydrogen evolution, oxygen reduction, hydrogen peroxide dismutation, and olefin epoxidation. A new class of hangman porphyrins is now available on the gram scale and can easily be further modified, allowing for unprecedented control the strength and character of pendant proton relays. Using iron complexes of these new hangman porphyrins, the level of control over proton management is demonstrated with the variation in the rates of hydrogen evolution electrocatalysis depending on the nature of the proton relay in the second coordination sphere. Understanding the fundamental electron transfer reactions of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is important in the chemistry of renewable energy storage, but also in a biological context. Hydrogen bond donors are known to affect the electron transfer reactivity of ROS, with the strength of the hydrogen bond determining the nature of oxygen-oxygen bond activation. The catalytic performance of iron corroles towards peroxide dismutation is markedly enhanced by the presence of a pendant hydrogen bond donor which is also capable of transferring protons to bound substrates. Contrary to hangman corroles, the six hydrogen bond donors in hexacarboxamide cryptand do not readily transfer protons, allowing it to facilitate the chemically reversible two-electron reduction of dioxygen to "naked" peroxide dianion. Using electrochemical techniques and computational modeling, it is possible to use cryptand-encapsulated peroxide as a model for the electron transfer reactions within lithium-oxygen batteries.									0	0	0		0	0	0					978-13-392-9280-9	INSPEC:16721464

Herein, the synthesis of layered hybrid NiFe-phenylphosphonate compounds from metal acetylacetonate precursors and phenylphosphonic acid in benzyl alcohol, and their oxygen evolution reaction performance in alkaline medium, are reported. The hybrid particles are formed by inorganic layers of NiO6 and FeO6 distorted octahedra separated by bilayers of the organic group, and template the formation in situ of NiFe hydroxide nanosheets of sizes between 5 and 25 nm and thicknesses between 3 and 10 nm. X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements suggest that the hybrid also acts as a template for the local structure of the metal sites in the active catalyst, which remain distorted after the transformation. Optimum electrocatalytic activity is achieved with the hybrid compound with a Fe content of 16%. The combination of the synergistic effect between Ni and Fe with the structural properties of the hybrid results in an efficient catalyst that generates a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 240 mV, and also in a stable catalyst that operates continuously at low overpotentials for 160 h.									48	6	0	0	1	0	50			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000413756000018

Herein, we focus on developing amorphous NiCoP with dandelion-like arrays anchored on nanowires through a universal strategy of hydrothermal and phosphorization. The hierarchical structure features in larger catalytic surface areas expedited reaction kinetics and improved structural stability. Benefiting from these merits, the NiCoP reaches 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of mere 57 mV for a hydrogen evolution reaction in standard solution. Also, a profound activity for the generation of oxygen is along with it, which requires 276 mV to attain 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, it demonstrates satisfying durability for both processes.									1	1	0	0	0	0	2			2470-1343			WOS:000710449700001	34693104

The electrode coated with this Ti4O7 material showed activities for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). For the ORR, several parameters, including overall electron transfer number, kinetic constants, electron transfer coefficient, and percentage H2O2 production, were obtained using the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technique and the Koutecky-Levich theory. The overall electron transfer number was found to be between 2.3 and 2.9 in 1, 4, and 6 M KOH electrolytes, suggesting that the ORR process on the Ti4O7 electrode was a mixed process of 2- and 4-electron transfer pathways. Electrochemical durability tests, carried out in highly concentrated KOH electrolyte, confirmed that this Ti4O7 is a stable electrode material, suggesting that it should be a feasible candidate for the aircathodes of zinc-air batteries. To understand the stability of this material, Raman and XPS spectra were also collected for the Ti4O7 samples before and after the stability tests. The results and analysis revealed that a thin layer of TiO2 formed on the Ti4O7 surface, which may have prevented further oxidation into the bulk of the Ti4O7 electrode.

Z-scheme systems based on two-step photoexcitation of a hydrogen evolution photocatalyst (HEP) and an oxygen evolution photocatalyst (OEP) are suited to harvesting of sunlight because semiconductors with either water reduction or oxidation activity can be applied to the water splitting reaction(4,5). However, it is challenging to achieve efficient transfer of electrons between HEP and OEP particles(6,7). Here, we present photocatalyst sheets based on La-and Rh-codoped SrTiO3 (SrTiO3:La, Rh; ref. 8) and Mo-doped BiVO4 (BiVO4:Mo) powders embedded into a gold (Au) layer. Enhancement of the electron relay by annealing and suppression of undesirable reactions through surface modification allow pure water (pH 6.8) splitting with a solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency of 1.1% and an apparent quantum yield of over 30% at 419 nm. The photocatalyst sheet design enables efficient and scalable water splitting using particulate semiconductors.									956	47	0	0	68	1	968			1476-1122	1476-4660		WOS:000376528000011	26950596

Here, the construction of a novel class of cost-efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), employing carbon dots (CDs), is reported. Benefitting from the successful incorporation of CDs into MnO2 nanoflowers, the resultant CDs-MnO2 with high surface areas, enhanced conductivity, as well as fast charge transfer pathways display not only greatly promoted electrocatalytic activity but also high stability for OER. Remarkably, to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the optimal of CDs(0.15)-MnO2 requires the overpotential of only 343 mV and the relatively low Tafel slope of 43.6 mV dec(-1). More significantly, such CDs(0.15)- MnO2 catalyst also displays outstanding long-term stability with limited activity and morphology change, showing an advanced class electrocatalyst. These findings open up a new way for the application of CDs and add to the growing family of CDs-metal hybrids with high OER performances. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Compared with well-investigated cobalt-based materials, the reconstruction of rocksalt CoO with purely Co2+ in octahedral (Oh) coordination has not been revealed in detail. Herein, monolayer CoO supported on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was synthesized via a one-pot hydrothermal strategy with calcinating in Ar atmosphere. The structure evolution of two-dimension (2D) CoO/rGO during OER was revealed by in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The transition from CoO toward Co3O4 already occurred at open circuit potential, further enhanced at 1.23 V (vs. RHE). The CoOx(OH)(y) was determined as the active phase at 1.53 V, displaying a tetrahedral Co coordination defective spinel Co3O4 with the Co-O shell that featured the (oxy)hydroxide, not the standard CoOOH. After OER, the irreversible transition from CoO to Co3O4 was observed. In contrast, in situ Raman spectra revealed a reversible amorphization process on Co3O4/rGO under operation conditions. Furthermore, this study indicated that the reconstruction behavior could be more effectively revealed by XAS using 2D materials.

However, the rational plot of such integrated catalytic system remains an enormous challenge due to the spatial disparity between photocatalytic components and electrocatalytic components. Herein, a MgCo2O4@WO3 core-shell heterostructure (MCW CSHS) is constructed by the simple one-step hydrothermal coordination of the spinel oxide MgCo2O4 (as the electron acceptor) and the WO3 semiconductor (as the electron donor). The cogitatively designed MCW CSHS catalyst can effectively eliminate the spatial disparity between the two above functional components and provide significantly increased surface area and roughness, which can enhance light absorption by restraining diffuse reflection and promoting electron transfer in EWS. Under solar illumination, the electrocatalytic activity of MCW CSHS is significantly improved due to the electronic structure regulation, yielding 50 mA.cm 2 at overpotentials of 243 mV for oxygen evolution reactions and 161 mV for hydrogen evolution reactions in 1 M KOH. The solar energy enhanced electrochemical system based on bifunctional materials has a broad application prospect in the efficient H2 production by EWS.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000729469900003

Herein, we developed a facile strategy to construct functional carbon materials with a fluffy peony-like structure and dense binary FeCo-N-x active sites (termed as f-FeCo-CNT). By regulating the metal content in precursors, a three-dimensional (3D) interconnected conductive carbon nanotubes network was in-situ formed throughout the atomically dispersed FeCo-NC matrix during pyrolysis. Taking advantage of rich pore hierarchy and co-existence of highly active FeCo-N-x sites and beneficial FeCo alloy nanoparticles, the f-FeCo-CNT material exhibited excellent bifunctional performance towards oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reactions (ORR/OER) with respect to the atomically dispersed FeCo-NC (SA-f-FeCo-NC) and commercial Pt/C+RuO2 mixture, surpassing the SA-f-FeCo-NC with a 20 mV higher ORR half-wave potential and a 100 mV lower OER overpotential (at 10.0 mA/cm(2)). Remarkably, the f-FeCo-CNT-assembled Zn-air battery (ZAB) possessed a maximum specific power of 195.8 mW/cm(2), excellent rate capability, and very good cycling stability at large current density of 20.0 mA/cm(2). This work provides a facile and feasible synthetic strategy of constructing low-cost cathode materials with excellent comprehensive ZAB performance.									51	4	0	0	0	0	50			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000526243700002

Herein, a concept has been proposed to solve this issue by doping Fe into CCHH nanowires grown on nickel foam (denoted as Fe-CCHH/NF) for achieving efficient OER catalysis by electro-chemical transformation. The obtained Fe-CCHH/NF-30 exhibits OER catalytic performance with an overpotential of only 200 mV versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and small Tafel slope of 50 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH. Moreover, it displays stability for over 130 h at a large current density of 55 mA cm(-2), and no activity decline is observed after the 3000 cycle test. The performance of Fe-CCHH/NF-30 renders it one of the most promising OER catalysts. The density functional theory calculation reveals that the doped Fe can greatly enhance the OER activity by lowering the reactive energy barrier.									26	0	0	0	1	0	26			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000571433500027	32805817

In general, the thermal radiation synthesis usually involves a slow heating and cooling process. Here, a high-frequency induction heating (IH) is employed to rapidly prepare various self-supported electrocatalysts grown on Ni foam (NF) in liquid- and gas-phase within 1-3 min. The NF not only serves as an in situ heating medium, but also as a growth substrate. The as-synthesized Ni nanoparticles anchored on MoO2 nanowires supported on NF (Ni-MoO2/NF-IH) enable catalysis of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), showing a low overpotential of -39 mV (10 mA cm(-2)) and maintaining the stability of 12 h in alkaline condition. Moreover, the NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH/NF-IH) is also synthesized via IH and affords outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with an overpotential of 246 mV (10 mA cm(-2)). The Ni-MoO2/NF-IH and NiFe LDH/NF-IH are assembled to construct a two-electrode system, where a small cell voltage of approximate to 1.50 V enables a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). More importantly, this IH method is also available to rapidly synthesize other freestanding electrocatalysts on NF, such as transition metal hydroxides and metal nitrides.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000615793900001

Herein we report the direct growth of cobalt phosphide (CoP) nanowires on conductive nickel foam (CoP@NF) as an efficient bifunctional catalyst for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium. CoP@NF electrodes were facilely synthesized by a one-pot hydrothermal method followed by a phosphorization step. For HER, the CoP@NF electrode showed excellent catalytic activity with a low overpotential of only similar to 100 mV to reach 10 mA/cm(2), a low Tafel slope of 57 mV/dec, and long-term durability in 1.0 M KOH. Interestingly, anodic activation of the CoP@NF electrode led to the formation of a CoP/CoO core-shell structure. The CoP/CoO core shell structure exhibited a low overpotential of 300 mV to reach 10 mA/cm(2) for OER and a Tafel slope of 64 mV/dec was achieved with good durability in 1.0 M KOH. Furthermore, CoP@NF and CoP/CoO@NF electrodes were used to construct a water splitting electrolyzer, which can perform overall water splitting activity with a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) under a voltage of 1.62 derived by a commercial solar cell.									24	2	0	0	1	0	25			2168-0485			WOS:000456631800059

In this work, we elucidate the inherent thermodynamicdriving forces behind the reduction of metal oxides to metals (M-OER). It is shown that the thermodynamics of M-OER can besystematically tuned via the interactions of oxygen with theparticipating metal cations as a function of metal-oxygen covalency,oxygen-oxygen covalency, and metal-oxygen ionicity. We screenboth group 1 elements and metals that are able to exist in the +2oxidation state for M-OER thermodynamics. Li, Fe, and Co areidentified as having low thermodynamic overpotentials for electro-lytic extraction from their metal oxides due to interactions between oxygen and these metals being neither too strong (covalent) nortoo weak (ionic). We further show that the bulk formation energies are predictive of M-OER reaction energetics on surfaces bydeveloping unified design principles for tuning the thermodynamics of these reduction reactions both in bulk oxides and on surfaces.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000795962300027

Herein, the authors integrate morphological design with compositional manipulation, and successfully achieve well-defined CoNiFe sulfide mesoporous nanospheres (CoNiFe-S MNs). The as-prepared CoNiFe-S MNs exhibit superior OER and ORR catalytic activity, delivering a low overpotential of only 199 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 m KOH solution and a half-wave potential of 0.78 V in 0.1 m KOH solution toward OER and ORR, respectively. The CoNiFe-S MNs involved Zn-air battery exhibits remarkable charge-discharge performance (voltage gap of 0.76 V at 2 mA cm(-2)) and high power density (over 140 mW cm(-3)). Extended-time durability tests validate the structural recoverability of the mesoporous morphology, and the remarkable performance can be attributed to the intrinsic synergistic effect of heterometallic ions. It is believed that the method could pave the way for the design of novel electrocatalysts for Zn-air batteries.									81	5	0	0	5	0	81			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000452401000021

A set of systematically modified nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) materials was synthesized using the hydrothermal method in which the degree of N-doping and N-bonding type is manipulated using two nitrogen precursors (urea and uric acid) and different thermal annealing temperatures. The bioactivity of the NG samples was evaluated using the oxidation of the intracellular antioxidant glutathione (GSH) and bacterial viability (of Escherichia coli K12), and oxidative stress was identified as the predominant antibacterial mechanism. Two key energy-relevant electrochemical reactions, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), were used to characterize the influence of different N-types on the electronic properties of the NG materials. Electron-donating graphitic-N and electron-withdrawing pyridinic-N were identified as effective promoters for ORR and OER, respectively. The similar mechanisms between the GSH oxidation (indicative of oxidative stress) and ORR mechanisms reveal the role of graphitic-N as the active site in oxidative stress related bioactivity, independent of other consequential properties (e.g., defect density, surface area). This work advances a growing rational design paradigm for graphene family materials using chemical composition and further provides valuable insight into the performance-hazard tradeoffs of NG applications in related fields.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			2051-8153	2051-8161		WOS:000501324000017

This approach is popular in that a simple tool is available for searching for promising electrode materials. However, thermodynamics alone may be misleading to assess the catalytic activity of an electrochemical reaction as we exemplify with the chlorine evolution reaction (CER) over a RuO2(110) model electrode. The full procedure is introduced, starting from the stable reaction intermediates, computing the energy barriers, and finally performing microkinetic simulations, all performed under the influence of the solvent and the electrode potential. Full kinetics from first-principles allows the rate-determining step in the CER to be identified and the experimentally observed change in the Tafel slope to be explained.									78	1	0	0	5	0	80			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000383077400034	27168427

Herein, an accessible method is presented to synthesize nickel diselenide (NiSe2) ultrathin nanowires decorated with amorphous nickel oxide nanoparticles (NiOx NPs) as multifunctional electrocatalysts (NSWANs) for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (HER and OER). The NSWANs exhibit quite low HER and OER overpotentials of 174 and 295 mV, respectively, holding the current density of 20 mA cm(-2) for 24 h continuous operations in alkaline media. Meanwhile, a cell voltage of 1.547 V at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting has been achieved by the NSWANs for the practical application, which could maintain fascinating activity of 20 mA cm(-2) for 72 h without degradation. The decorated NiOx NPs not only prevent the NiSe2 from further oxidation but also expose requisite active sites for electrocatalytic process. It is believed that this study may provide a valuable strategy to design high-efficiency electrocatalysts and expand the applications of selenide-based materials.									55	4	0	0	4	0	55			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000412167100008	28745829

Acid treatments with HNO3 or a HNO3-H2SO4 mixture resulted in a progressive introduction of oxygen-containing groups which led to a strong increase of the capacitance and a higher tendency to carbon corrosion. In contrast, an inhibition of the hydrogen evolution current (at potentials more negative than -1.0 V) was observed for oxidized samples in comparison to the un-treated material. HER was also tested in the presence of dissolved CO2 to study the influence of the surface chemistry on the CO2 electroreduction. An inhibition of the H-2 evolution current was evidenced in the CO2 saturated electrolyte due to the adsorption of species from CO2 reduction. A strong hydrogen current decrease (65-78%), and thus a higher tendency to adsorb (CO2)(red) species, was obtained on the original Vulcan and the HNO3-treated samples, in comparison to the carbon oxidized with HNO3-H2SO4 (15%), which could be related to the highest content of basic groups of the last carbon.

Nevertheless, most of the catalysts suffer from low yield rate and Faradaic efficiency in this process. In this work, we developed a porous carbon with oxygen-containing groups (denoted as oxidized carbon) to promote N-2 electroreduction into NH3. At-0.3 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs RHE), oxidized carbon achieves a high Faradaic efficiency of 16.50% for NH3, which is 3.3 times as high as porous carbon (denoted as pristine carbon) (5.07%). Notably, the yield rate of oxidized carbon for NH3 reaches 32.20 mu gNH(3)mg(-1)cat. h(-1), higher than that (14.52 mu gNH(3) mg(cat.)(-1) h(-1)) of pristine carbon at-0.5 V vs RHE. Mechanistic studies revealed that the introduction of oxygen-containing groups into porous carbon effectively decreased the energy barrier of hydrogenation and suppressed the competing hydrogen evolution reaction, thereby promoting N-2 electroreduction to NH3.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000780376700004

Herein, a novel nitrogen doped carbon nanocage (N-CNC-900) is fabricated via facile carbonization of bimetal-organic framework (BMOF). The newly obtained N-CNC-900 catalyst is featured by multiple carbon layers with a wide lattice spacing of 0.434 nm and the aperture of approximate 10 nm, ultrahigh specific surface area and abundant N doping amount as well. As results, the optimized N-CNC-900 exhibits a low overpotential of 1.52 V toward OER at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2), and also show a large half-wave potential of 0.90 V for ORR, respectively. High activity and stability toward the bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis are also demonstrated on the N-CNC-900. When explored as air cathode for rechargeable Zn-air battery, a high open-circuit voltage (1.54 V) and long-term stability (after cycling 200 h) can be realized, outperforming the commercial Pt/C + RuO2 association. This outstanding performance can be attributed to improved reaction kinetics of both ORR and OER, which originates from the enlarged lattice spacing in the few-layer conductive carbon nanocage structure and the existing metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-x-C). These results forebode the optimized N-CNC-900 presenting a promising application in metal-air batteries, as well the lattice modulation of carbon materials providing a novel approach for designing advanced electrocatalysts.

A variety of materials with nonstoichiometry have emerged in electrochemical energy conversion and storage, which necessitates a solid understanding of their formation mechanism and structure-function relationship. This review presents a summary of the progress made in this emerging field, starting from the introduction of the multiscale top-down and bottom-up strategies for generating nonstoichiometry and the related characterization methodologies. Then, representative nonstoichiometric materials (NMs) are discussed in properties and merits, with selected examples of each material category. A special focus is placed on the dimensionality from atomic sites to surface/interfaces, grains, microstructure, and hierarchical macroscale. After that, recent advances are overviewed for the use of exemplified NMs in electrocatalysis (i.e., oxygen reduction/evolution, hydrogen evolution, and nitrogen reduction) and batteries (i.e., Li/Na/Zn batteries). The review is concluded with a summary highlighting the beneficial effects of NMs and a perspective on further research to address remaining issues.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000649842000001

In this work, on the basis of first-principles calculations, we screened a series of late transition metal atoms supported on a C9N4 monolayer (TM@C9N4, where TM represents Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir, and Pt) as electrocatalysts for both the HER and OER. Our results demonstrate that the TM atoms can be bonded with the nitrogen atoms around the hole to form stable structures, and the bonded TM atoms are stable against diffusion. Co@C9N4 exhibits high catalytic activity toward the HER. In particular, the N active sites in the Co@C9N4, Ni@C9N4, and Pt@C9N4 systems demonstrate relatively high performance for the HER. However, Co@C9N4 and Pt@C9N4 exhibit low OER activities with large overpotentials. Among the ten cases of TM@C9N4 considered here, only Ni@C9N4 performs as a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst with N and Ni atoms as catalytic active sites for the HER and OER, with a calculated hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy (Delta G(H star)) of -0.04 eV and an OER overpotential (eta(OER)) of 0.31 V. The results demonstrate that TM@C9N4 is a promising single-atom catalytic system, which can be used as the non-noble metal bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting.									39	4	0	0	1	0	39			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000512634500024	31556893

The influence of calcination times, properties and the electrochemical performance of the catalyst were investigated by utilizing cyclic voltammetry, potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques. The surface of the catalysts, which were prepared in different combinations were physically characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The SEM and TEM images showed that among the different catalysts, the gel@LiMo catalyst has a different crystal structure. The gel/LiMo catalyst shows good electrochemical performances in an organic solution and has a good structural stability.

J	Cheng, Weiren; Su, Hui; Liu, Qinghua					Su, Hui/0000-0001-7653-3426			Tracking the Oxygen Dynamics of Solid-Liquid Electrochemical Interfaces by Correlative In Situ Synchrotron Spectroscopies								ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH											10.1021/acs.accounts.2c00239		JUL 2022			2022	CONSPECTUS: Oxygen-involved electrocatalytic processes, including the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), are central to a series of advanced modern energy and conversion technologies, such as water electrolyzers, fuel cells, and CO2 reduction or N-2 fixation devices. A comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the charge transfer and energy conversion process that ubiquitously occurs over solid- liquid electrochemical interfaces during oxygen electrocatalysis is crucial for understanding the key essence of oxygen-related electrochemistry. The huge challenges for dynamic studies over solid-liquid interfaces during oxygen electrocatalysis lie in the allembracing electrochemical processes of the catalytic reactions, associated with both structural and reactive intermediates evolution on the electrode surface, and in the significant influence of the aqueous environments of electrolytes used. Hence, overcoming these challenges intrinsically calls for a great cooperation of multiple cutting-edge in situ technologies. Synchrotron radiation (SR) X-ray absorption fine structure (SR-XAFS) spectroscopy is highly sensitive to the local atomic structure of nanomaterials, and SR-based Fourier transform infrared (SR-FTIR) spectroscopy features unique molecular fingerprint identification to determine active species on the surface of electrodes. One can imagine that the correlative in situ SR-XAFS/FTIR spectroscopic investigations will potentially provide sufficient, reliable, and complementary information at the atomic/molecular level to depict vivid and comprehensive "dynamic movies" of solid-liquid electrochemical interfaces during oxygen electrocatalysis, which will help effectively promote/ simplify the complicated screening process of advanced oxygen electrocatalysts for efficient high-energy-density energy systems. In this Account, starting with some fundamentals of SR-based spectroscopic technologies, tips for obtaining high-quality SR-XAFS and SR-FTIR spectroscopy results during the electrocatalytic process are comprehensively specified. Subsequently, the latest research achievements of dynamic investigations mainly from our group based on in situ SR-XAFS and/or SR-FTIR spectroscopies will be systematically scrutinized and properly emphasized in detail, where the currently attractive metal-organic-framework (MOF) nanomaterials and single-atom catalysts (SACs) are selected as the main object of research. Moreover, the vital contributions of correlative in situ SR-XAFS/FTIR studies on new discoveries of the dynamic evolution of solid-liquid interfaces during oxygen electrocatalysis are highlighted. In particular, our pioneering research found that the potential-dependent dynamically coupled oxygen formed in the precatalytic stage was a very useful promoter in SACs to promote efficient OER kinetics under acidic conditions. In addition, the in situ generated metastable Ni-1-N(2 )centers with more structural degrees of freedom in SACs could potentially facilitate the fast 4e(- )ORR kinetics. This Account is anticipated to stimulate broad interest in dynamic explorations in various catalytic processes of interest in the material science and electrochemistry communities using correlative SR-based technologies.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000830432500001	35801353

In this study, NiCoP nanowire arrays grown on 3D Ni foam (NiCoP NWAs/NF) were successfully synthesized by a two-step method, which were developed as novel bifunctional electrocatalysts for evaluating in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Their special cone nanostructure and bifunctional crystal structure enable the electrocatalysts to display remarkable electrocatalytic performance and stability for OER and HER (maintained for 28 h in the long-term HER and OER stability test with slight attenuation). The electrodes have very low overpotentials of 197 mV and 370 mV for HER and OER in 1.0 M KOH at a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. All the merits can be attributed to several parameters: the inherent nature of transition metal phosphides, the presence of a bimetal synergetic effect, special morphology design, and the formation of "secondary" electrocatalysts on the surface of NiCoP. Meanwhile, the excellent bifunctional electrocatalysts can be developed as both anode and cathode of an alkaline electrolyzer (1.0 M KOH) which needs a cell voltage of 1.64 V to achieve 20 mA cm(-2) current density.									206	9	0	0	3	0	208			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000405689000039

In order to improve the energy efficiency and cycle life of Li-O-2 battery, spinel mesoporous CuCo2O4 was successfully synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method and investigated in Li-O-2 batteries. The electrochemical measurements show that mesoporous CuCo2O4 possess higher oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution activity than bulk CuCo2O4 both in alkaline and non-aqueous solution. Owing to the inherent catalytic activity, high conductivity and facile mass transfer of mesoporous CuCo2O4, Li-O-2 battery shows enhanced electrochemical performances, including much lower charge overpotential and a high capacity up to 5288 mAh g(-1). When restricting the discharge capacity at 500 mAh g(-1), it could operate over 80 cycles and exhibit superior cycle stability. These results indicate that mesoporous CuCo2O4 nanoparticles are appropriate bifunctional catalysts for Li-O-2 batteries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, efficient and stable water electrolysis remains a challenge. In particular, the design of a bifunctional electrocatalyst with excellent performance and stability is the key to realizing high-efficiency water splitting. Here, through a simple two-step electrochemical method, we have combined doping and heterostructure construction to synthesize a Cu- and Fe-co-doped Ni/Ni(OH)(2) heterostructured electrocatalyst (EO-Cu-3-Fe-2-Ni-50/NF) with excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) dual catalytic functions. XPS and in situ Raman spectroscopy show that the Cu and Fe co-doping optimizes the electronic structure of the catalyst by decreasing the oxidation state of Ni in the catalytic process, which thereby reduces the energy barrier of electron transfer and improves the oxygen production efficiency. In addition, the Ni/Ni(OH)(2) heterostructure provides plentiful HER-active Ni-Ni(OH)(2) interfaces, and these interfaces are further stabilized by Fe doping, thereby enhancing the HER performance. With the dual strategy, the HER and OER catalytic activities of EO-Cu-3-Fe-2-Ni-50/NF are greatly optimized so that at a current density of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), ultra-low overpotentials of 25 and 88 mV, and 202 and 240 mV can be achieved, respectively. EO-Cu-3-Fe-2-Ni-50/NF also exhibits excellent stability for the OER such that a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) can be maintained for at least 100 hours without obvious attenuation. And when the catalyst is used for both the anode and cathode for alkaline water electrolysis, a remarkable low cell voltage of 1.439 V is required to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and it could last for at least 36 hours. The efficient and stable water electrolysis of EO-Cu-3-Fe-2-Ni-50/NF surpasses that of most non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000782955600001

Herein, the use of this technique to develop a multicomponent composite catalyst with CoSx core encapsulated in an ultrathin porous carbon shell entangled with Co, N-codoped carbon nanotubes is reported. The as-prepared catalyst has a superior catalytic activity for oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions, an ultralow potential gap of 0.74 V, and outstanding durability, surpassing most previous reports. Such superiority is ascribed, in part, to the unique 3D electrode architecture of the composite, which is favorable for transporting oxygen species and electrons and creates a synergy between the components with different functionalities. Moreover, the flexible solid Zn-air battery assembled with such an air electrode shows a steady discharge voltage plateau of 1.25 V and a round-trip efficiency of 70% at 1 mA cm(-2). This work presents a simple strategy to design highly efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts and may pave the way for the practical application of these materials in many energy conversion/storage devices.									157	11	0	0	5	0	157			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000476276800001

Herein, via a facile one-pot hydrothermal approach, high-performance bifunctional catalysts of Co3O4-CeO2 with pollen-petal-like heterostructures are synthesized in situ on 3D FeNi3 foam (FNF) (denoted as Co3O4-CeO2@FNF). In a 1.0 M alkaline aqueous solution of KOH, the designed Co3O4-CeO2@FNF with a large surface area exhibits both outstanding HER and OER activities, with an ultralow overpotential of 53.8 and 236 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Additionally, a standard two-electrode system fabricated by employing Co3O4-CeO2@FNF as both the cathode and anode shows an overpotential of 1.59 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and moreover retains 93% of the activity after a 70 h long-term stability test. Moreover, the electron transportation is accelerated due to the increased density of states across the Fermi level resulting from oxygen vacancy doping, which further endows Co3O4-CeO2@FNF with outstanding catalytic performance. Furthermore, it should be noted that the designed catalysts could be manufactured on a large scale, which further envisions their promising commercial utilization for overall water splitting.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2398-4902			WOS:000632013900001

However, the sluggish reaction kinetics of oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution on the air electrodes of ZABs require to developing cost-effective and high-efficiency bifunctional electrocatalysts for commercialization ZABs. Currently, transition metal-based materials have been explored as potential bifunctional electrocatalysts for ZABs with the advantages of highly activity, cost-effective and excellent stability. Therefore, this review intends to give a comprehensive overview on developments of transition metal-based catalysts (TMCAs) in most recently. According to different constitutions of TMCAs, catalysts of single atom, nanoalloys, oxides, hydroxides, chalcogenides, nitrides and phosphides are systematically introduced in the review. The structural modulations of TMCAs via nanosizing, heteroatom doping and their interface effect are also discussed since they play vital roles in exposing sufficient intrinsic active sites for enhancing the catalytic performance. Finally, the existing challenges of TMCAs and feasible strategies for enhancing the bifunctional catalytic performance and promoting the performance of ZABs are also explored detailly. Based on this review, we hope to provide reference values for building effective bifunctional electrocatalysts for commercial rechargeable ZABs.									26	1	0	0	1	0	26			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000582488600013

Herein, the cation (iron) and anion (borate) co-doping strategy was proposed to effectively trigger the OER performance on a low-cost NiO material. The optimal hollow Fe/B-i-NiO bipyramidal prism shows superior OER performance, and displays a low overpotential (261 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2), accompanied by a low Tafel slope (46 mV dec(-1)), excellent intrinsic activity and robust stability. The overall alkaline water splitting using Fe/B-i-NiO/NF as an anode affords low cell voltages of 1.50 and 1.63 V at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), and operates steadily at a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2) for 55 h without decay. The excellent electrocatalytic activity could be ascribed to the hollow structure to shorten the mass transfer pathway, the electronic modulation by Fe doping, the increased accessible electroactive sites created by oxygen vacancies through borate doping, and the formation of BO33--OH- to accelerate the deprotonation of OHads.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000683769700001	34477697

Not only can Ag colloids, as template agents, modify the morphologies of urchin-like CCHH microspheres to expose more active sites available, but also the supported Ag NPs formed by Ag colloids can transfer the electron to CCHH surfaces, accelerating the transformation of surface Co(II)to Co-III/Co-IV(proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) process). The urchin-like Ag/CCHH (0.013 mmol) precatalyst (before cyclic voltammetry (CV) activation) exhibits a better OER performance (a low overpotential of 273 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)and small Tafel slope of 65 mV dec(-1)) as compared with commercial RuO2. Furthermore, the dynamic surface self-reconstruction (surface CO(3)(2-)and OH(-)exchange) can further enhance the activities of Ag/CCHH precatalysts. Consequently, the optimal Ag/CCHH (0.013 mmol) catalyst presents a superior activity (a lower overpotential of 267 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)and markedly reduced Tafel slope to 56 mV dec(-1)) along with an excellent stability after CV cycles. The study provides a feasible strategy to fully realize the low overpotential of CCHH-based OER electrocatalysts.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000568456600001	32886648

However, the significant kinetic barriers associated with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), one of the two half reactions at the heart of water electrolysis, greatly hinder the sustainable production of hydrogen at a large scale. A wide variety of materials have thus been designed and explored as OER catalysts. In this perspective, we briefly review the development of Ir-based OER catalysts in acidic conditions and discuss the limitations of a design strategy solely based on the physical and electronic properties of OER catalysts, highlighting the importance of understanding the catalyst-electrolyte interface which affects the stability and activity of the catalyst. We then share our perspective on a group of crystalline, bulk protonated iridates obtained via cation exchange in acidic solutions to be used as promising stable and active OER catalysts. Finally, we discuss the advances recently made in understanding the impact of the active site environment on the OER kinetics, emphasizing the influence of the water structure and/or solvation properties of ions in the electrolyte. We highlight the importance of developing a better understanding of these influencing factors and incorporate them into our design of OER catalysts with enhanced properties.									33	0	0	0	1	0	33			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000492800700003

Precious metal catalysts such as Ir, Ru and their oxides are usually used for enhancing reaction kinetics but are limited by their scarcity. The challenges associated with alternative nonprecious metal catalysts such as transition metal oxides and (oxy)hydroxides are their low electronic conductivity and durability. The carbon encapsulating transition metal nanoparticles are expected to address these challenges. However, the relationship between precursor compositions and catalyst properties, and the intrinsic functions of each component has been rarely studied. Herein, we report a highly durable (no degradation after 20,000 cycles) and highly active (360 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(GEO)(-2)) OER catalyst derived from bimetallic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) precursors. This catalyst consists of NiFe nanoparticles encapsulated by nitrogen-doped graphitized carbon shells. The electron-donation/deviation from Fe and tuned lattice and electronic structures of metal cores by Ni are revealed to be primary contributors to the enhanced OER activity, whereas N concentration contributes negligibly. We further demonstrated that the structure and morphology of encapsulating carbon shells, which are the key factors influencing the durability, are facilely controlled by the chemical state of precursors.									114	5	0	0	7	0	116			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000408878200025

To address this issue, herein, one unique hybrid electrode is synthesized with the local photothermal effect (LPTE) by supporting the novel ternary nickel (Ni)-bismuth (Bi)-sulfur (S) nanosheet arrays onto nickel foam (Ni3Bi2S2@NF) via a one-pot hydrothermal reaction. The combined experimental and theoretical observations reveal that owing to the intrinsic LPTE action of Bi, robust phase stability of Ni3Bi2S2 as well as the synergistic effect with hierarchical configuration, upon injecting the light, the as-prepared Ni3Bi2S2 exhibits remarkably improved efficiency of 44% and 35% for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. Such enhanced values are also comparable to those performed in working media heated to 80 degrees C. In addition, the overall water splitting system by using Ni3Bi2S2@NF as bifunctional electrodes only delivers an ultralow voltage of 1.40 V at 10 mA cm(-2) under LPTE, and can be stable more than 36 h at 500-1000 mA cm(-2). More broadly, even worked at 0-5 degrees C, alkaline simulated seawater and high salt seawater, the electrodes still show apparent LPTE effect for improving catalytic efficiency.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000747588100001	35088573

The electrochemical responses were compared with Pt and DSA (Ti/IrO2/SnO2/Sb2O5) electrodes, considering them as well behavior electrodes for water oxidation reaction. This study allows us to identify that SnO2-nCFE electrode depresses the water oxidation potential, the reaction is catalyzed, and the SnO2-SCFE electrode extends the oxygen evolution potential. Consequently the electrodes were evaluated in 0.1M KHCO3/CO2 with pH 6.8, and 0.1M KHCO3 2% Reactive Blue dye, respectively. The assessment in these specific systems enables to evaluate their possible use as anodes. In a future work, the efficiency and cell potential will be reported in order to confirm the effective performance of these electrodes materials.					27th National Meeting of the Mexican-Electrochemical-Society (MES) / 5th Meeting of the Mexican-Section of the Electrochemical-Society (ECS)27th National Meeting of the Mexican-Electrochemical-Society (MES) / 5th Meeting of the Mexican-Section of the Electrochemical-Society (ECS)	JUN 11-15, 2012JUN 11-15, 2012	Mexican Electrochem Soc; Electrochem Soc, Mexican Sect; Mexican State Univ; Res Ctr Sustainable ChemMexican Electrochem Soc; Electrochem Soc, Mexican Sect; Mexican State Univ; Res Ctr Sustainable Chem	Toluca, MEXICOToluca, MEXICO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1938-5862	1938-6737	978-1-60768-442-8	WOS:000337749400009

CdS-derived nanostructures have been identified as potential catalysts for water splitting for decades. Realizing the competence of transition-metal (TM) doping in the desirable tuning of the properties of nanostructures, we have studied the catalytic activity of late TM (TM = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Os, Ir, Pt, and Au)-doped CdS nanotubes (TM@CdS NTs) for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Systematic screening of stability as well as activity among the doped NT structures is carried out, and the results are compared with pristine CdS NT and bulk CdS. The doping of TMs is found to be accompanied by an enhancement of impurity d states near the Fermi level, suggesting an efficient electrocatalytic activity. Majority of TM-doped structures are associated with significant stability and are observed to improve both OER and HER activities. Activity analysis places Pd@CdS and Ru@CdS as optimal catalysts for OER and HER, respectively, with the lowest overpotential, outperforming pristine CdS NTs as well as bulk CdS. The origin of the activity trend is attributed to the differences in the interaction with the reaction intermediates across the series of doped NT structures. A complete scrutiny of energetics of elementary reactions for all TM@CdS NT structures is provided, and an activity plot is constructed to have a correlation between overpotential and adsorption energetics.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000470938400005

A new coordination-polymer-derived, oxygen-vacancy-rich Co3O4-based composite is chosen as a cathode material for this hybrid battery. The pseudocapacitance property of this composite is attractive with a specific capacitance of 213.7 mAh.g(-1) at 1 A-g(-1). Its rate capability is promising with 62.6% capacitance retained when the current density increases to 20 A.g(-1). The composite follows a typical four-electron mechanism during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), its overpotential and Tafel slope are 347 mV and 79.4 mV.dec(-1), respectively. For the hybrid aqueous Zn battery, the discharge process is divided into two stages, namely, a Zn-Co3O4 battery and a Zn-air part. With the current density at 1 mA.cm(-2), two discharge plateaus locate at 1.72 and 1.02 V. In this case, the specific capacitance of the hybrid battery reaches 788 mAh.g(-1) with an energy density of 921 Wh.kg(-1). Its peak power density reaches 48.9 mW.cm(-2) at 34.8 mA.cm(-2). The charge-discharge platforms and specific capacitance remain stable after continuous experiments for 300 cycles. This work introduces a referable example for the design and fabrication of a high-performance hybrid aqueous Zn battery.									17	2	0	0	0	0	19			2168-0485			WOS:000526356300011

This work reports the synthesis and characterization of highly porous cobalt hydroxide (meso-Co-OH) formed by a simple chemical precipitation within the interstitial space of liquid crystal template. The physicochemical properties of the meso-Co-OH were characterized by surface area analyzer, X-ray diffraction, XPS, scanning and transmission electron microscopes. The meso-Co-OH exhibits low crystallinity and high surface area of 457 +/- 5 m(2)/g with a mesoporous structure and pore diameter of 4.0 +/- 1.0 nm. As confirmed by the electrochemical characterizations, the meso-Co-OH is highly effective electro-catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at low applied potential and shows superior activity and stability than iridium oxide during long term water electrolysis in alkaline media. The meso-Co-OH shows oxygen evolution current and onset potential comparable to the IrO2 catalyst and the current is enhanced by 10 times than the values of bulk cobalt hydroxide electrode. For meso-Co-OH catalyst the oxygen evolution overpotential of 1.55 V (vs. RHE) at current density of 25 mA cm(2) has been achieved in 1.0 M KOH. The enhanced OER activity was attributed to the substantial increase in the active catalyst surface area due to the formation of mesoporous network within the cobalt hydroxide framework.

The process of water electrolysis is greatly influenced by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Therefore, it is necessary to develop a very effective catalyst for improving OER performances. The electronic properties and morphological structure of electrocatalysts can significantly affect their OER performance. Electrocatalysts with the morphology of dendrite can expose more active sites which would enhance the OER activity. Here, the 3D dendritic Ni@Ni(Fe)OOH core-shell material has been developed on nickel foam (NF) with a controllable morphology and composition using an extremely simple and fast method. The doping of Fe can effectively modulate the morphology and the electronic structure of Ni@NiO to improve the intrinsic activity of active sites. The porous dendritic core-shell structure could allow more active sites to grow and transport electrolyte faster. At the same time, the internal Ni core can work as fast electronic transfer networks. As a result, the optimized Ni@Ni(Fe)OOH/NF shows a great catalytic performance for OER with an overpotential of 226 mV cm(-2) at 10 mA cm(-2) and an excellent stability in alkaline solution. The results given in paper may bring important implications for the development of a series of hydrogen and oxygen catalysts.									23	2	0	0	1	0	24			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000454617200084

Phase engineering has been proven to effectively tune the active-site electronic structure and thus improve the activity of electrocatalysts. However, phase transition usually induces morphology transformation, and the influence of realistic morphological feature change on the activity of electrocatalysts has seldom been considered. Herein, we present a facile thermal annealing strategy to transform cobalt-copper oxide nanosheets (Co2Cu1-ONS) into nanoparticle-stacked porous sulfide nanonetworks (Co2Cu1-S). Density functional theory (DFT) and dynamic DFT calculations confirm that the S thermal annealing process could bring about higher intrinsic activity of active sites and faster mass transfer of reactants, which endow Co2Cu1-S with remarkably higher OER/ORR catalytic performance than that of Co2Cu1-ONS and Co3S4. Its potential gap between the potential for an OER current density of 10.0 mA cm(-2) and the ORR half-wave potential is as low as 0.74 V. The Co2Cu1-S is then employed as an air electrode for a rechargeable Zn-air battery, which exhibits a peak power density of 0.195 W cm(-2), high specific capacity of 815.3 mA h g(-1), and robust stability (up to 80 h).									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000686543400001

For the pulsed mode measurement, both of the measurements were performed in a time-resolved method using a boxcar sampling technique. For the conversion of the retarding field analyzer measurement results into absolute positive ion densities, argon plasma was used as a reference. The pulsed oxygen plasma was generated using the inductively coupled antenna and modulated at a repetition rate of 5 kHz and the duty ratio of 50%. The gas pressure was changed from 5 to 30 mTorr. The time evolution of the electronegativity shows that there is a pressure regime where the electron attachment reaction during the RF on-time is very active, indicating that the negative ion density reaches its maximum value during the RF on-time. Compared to the CW oxygen plasma, the electronegativity of the pulsed oxygen plasma varies within a wider range of values. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, the as-prepared nanocube Ni-based catalysts underwent a reconstruction process and transformed from gamma-NiOOH to beta-NiOOH structure by iron incorporation under the applied bias, which was confirmed by in-situ Raman measurement. According to the methanol oxidation current response difference, the hydroxyl adsorption intensity was proposed to be regulated by iron incorporation and the rate-determining step would be the formation of *OOH for Fe-doped beta-NiOOH, which was further supported by DFT calculation. This work reveals the effect of iron-doped on the phase structure transform and the regu-lation of intermediate species elaborately and offers new insight on the understanding of the activity origins for NiFe-based catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000817833200006

CHEMCATCHEM				11	12			2926	2935		10.1002/cctc.201900576				JUN 19 2019	2019	Three structurally distinct interfaces, i. e. Au/alpha-Fe2O3-THB-Air, Au/alpha-Fe2O3-HS-Air, and Au/alpha-Fe2O3-QC-Air, with the major substrate facet being {113}, {001}, and {012} respectively, were controllably prepared. The low temperature water gas shift (WGS) reaction (100-260 degrees C) was applied to these unique systems to reveal how these structurally distinct interfaces can impact on the reaction behavior. With the detailed performance evaluation plus the characterizations of CO-TPSR, XPS, and in situ-FTIR in particular, the correlations between the evolution of different intermediates and the distinct catalytic behaviors have been established. The substrate facet structure and the Au entity largely determine the form and reactivity of surface OH/H2O species which in turn determine the formation of different intermediates and eventually the product formation. The Au/alpha-Fe2O3-THB-Air is enriched with oxygen vacant sites, favorable for dissociative adsorption of H2O, carboxyl intermediate formation and H-2 production. The Au/alpha-Fe2O3-HS-Air is enriched with surface lattice oxygen, favorable for molecular adsorption of H2O, formate intermediate formation, and CO2 production. The Au/alpha-Fe2O3-QC-Air interface is enriched with surface Fe sites, favorable for dissociative adsorption of H2O and evolution of stable carboxyl intermediate as well as isolated OH species at low reaction temperatures. The findings are informative to control the interfacial structure for the WGS and other reactions.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000477935900020

The development of economical and efficient catalysts with precisely modulated active sites is crucial for exploring the reaction mechanism and promoting the water oxidation process. Herein, we present isolated Au atom-decorated CoSe2 (Au-1-CoSe2) nanobelts with precisely engineered active sites for an enhanced OER. Theoretical investigations showed that the decoration of isolated Au atoms could shift up the d-band center and thus lower the H2O adsorption energy of Co active sites. Moreover, the trace amount of Au atoms (0.1 wt%) also ensures the effective exposure of Co active sites and minimizes the use of Au. Both the intrinsically enhanced H2O adsorption and the sufficient exposure of active sites contributed to the remarkable electrocatalytic performance of the Au-1-CoSe2 nanobelts. The asprepared Au-1-CoSe2 nanobelts exhibited a 21.1-fold, 5.7-fold, and 1.9-fold higher OER activity relative to pure CoSe2 nanobelts, Au nanoparticle-deposited CoSe2 (Au-N-CoSe2) nanobelts, and commercial Ir/C, respectively. This study demonstrates the validity of atomic-scale control of active sites in Co-based catalysts, which could also be extended to the design of highly efficient catalysts for other energyrelated processes.									46	0	0	0	0	0	46			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000412781700014

Herein, a cation-modulated V-Co-based oxyhydroxide one-dimensional scaffold configuration (Co1-xVxOOH) assembled using uniform similar to 4 nm thick nanosheets is reported, which demonstrates superb OER activity and durability. Theoretically, the Co sites adjacent to V in the bimetal samples have the maximum required energy of 0.37 V (*O -> *OOH) when combined with 20% V (Co0.8V0.2OOH), which is favorable for enhancing the OER activity with the ultralow overpotential of 190 mV vs. the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), Tafel slope of 39.6 mV dec(-1) and remarkable durability over 100 h. To the best of our knowledge, the overpotential of 190 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) is the best value reported to date for Co or V (oxy)hydroxide-based OER catalysts. The outstanding activity is ascribed to the hierarchically stable scaffold configuration, high electrochemically active surface area, enhanced oxygen vacancies on the surface and the synergistic effect of the active metal atoms. This study affords a strategy for the rational design of earth-abundant electrocatalysts for energy conversion applications.									44	0	0	0	2	1	45			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000490235800029

Herein, cobalt nanoparticles embedded-nitrogen doped carbon composite (Co-NC) is prepared by pyrolysis of a Co based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) precursor, which is synthesized by KOH assisted deprotonation of 2-methylimidazole ligand and coordination with Co(Ac)(2) in a safe ethanol medium. The alkali deprotonation and employment of Co(Ac)(2) reactant obviously enhance the yield, phase purity and structural stability of the afforded ZIF-67 precursor (denoted as K-ZIF-67-Ac) and further the OER catalytic efficiency of the resultant Co-NC composite. The typical Co-NC catalyst prepared by carbonization of K-ZIF-67-Ac at 800 degrees C in N-2 atmosphere, denoted as K-ZIF-67-Ac-800, displays obviously lower overpotential (350 mV) at current density of 50 mA cm(-2), higher OER catalytic kinetics and robust durability over other ZIF-67 derived Co-NC catalysts. The current work paves a feasible avenue to prepare efficient Co-NC OER catalyst from alkali deprotonation assisted ZIF precursor. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

This paper reviews the activity, stability and durability for hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline medium of different types of recently reported potential electrocatalysts such as Ni, Co, NiCo, Fe, Cu, W, Mo, Se, Mn, Zn, V, and metal free based earth-abundant-electrocatalysts. Further, this paper reviews the strategies used to achieve the remarkably low overpotential (including eta(10): <= 35 mV), high long term stability (including >= 100 h) and high durability (including >= 5000 cycles) of potential earth-abundant-electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline medium and those are better or well comparable with the state-of-the-art, noble, Pt/C electrocatalyst.

(1992) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1099, 137-144). In this paper, a similar stabilisation is demonstrated for oxygen-evolving PS II core preparations. The presence of such co-solutes appears, however, to have no ability to stabilise PS II reaction-centre preparations against heat-induced changes in their absorption spectrum. Nor do they protect electron transport from artificial electron donors in PS II core preparations lacking the extrinsic 33 kDa polypeptide of the oxygen-evolution system. Measurements performed on core preparations retaining the 33 kDa polypeptide but lacking the 17 kDa and 23 kDa polypeptides indicate that the co-solutes protect PS-II-mediated electron transport by stabilising the binding of the 33 kDa polypeptide to the core complexes. These findings are discussed in terms of an extension of the general principles underlying the Hofmeister effect observed for soluble proteins to the stabilisation of photosynthetic membrane preparations.									41	1	0	0	38	0	42			0006-3002			WOS:A1992HQ87900012	1567886

To address the conjecture, the detailed structure evolution of Na0.76V6O15 nanorods is investigated with different electrochemical reaction voltage windows. High time resolution in situ X-ray diffraction, ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ex situ Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy demonstrate the amorphization of Na0.76V6O15 nanorods and formation of ionized oxygen in nanorods, leading to the increased polarization voltage and fast capacity fading. The amorphization and diffusion of ionized oxygen in nanorods is controlled by optimizing the voltage window, resulting in the great increase of capacity retention from 26% to 80%. It is demonstrated that controlling the voltage window and corresponding ionized oxygen diffusion can mitigate the fast capacity fading to achieve long lasting lithium ion batteries.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000384809800009

However, controlling the electronic spin state of materials is still a challenge. In this work, we synthesized Fe-doped meso-Co3O4 via a nanocasting method. The merit of our method lies in high spin state Fe3+ (t(2g)(3)e(g)(2)) being controllably introduced into an octahedral site to regulate the valence states and configure the eg electron of Co3+. The introduced Fe3+ prefers to occupy octahedral sites due to its lower formation energy. Then, Fe3+ doping enlarges the Co3+-O distance and decreases the lattice symmetry, leading to the splitting of the d-orbital in Co3+. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that spin state optimized Co-(Oh)(3+) acts preferentially as an active site. Furthermore, CoFe-7.5 (Co2.775Fe0.225O4), with its maximum Fe-(Oh)(3+) content, exhibits the best OER activity. Our work indicates that the introduction of Fe3+ enables an improvement in the electrocatalytic performance of Co3O4 by regulating the spin state of Co3+.									18	1	0	0	1	0	17			2052-1553			WOS:000512754200033

Metallic nickel, thermally oxidized nickel, and black nickel coating were used as Ni electrodes. The methods of cyclic voltammetry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were employed. The study was undertaken with a view to find the evidence of peroxide-type nickel surface compounds formation in the course of OER on the Ni electrode surface. On the basis of experimental results and literature data, it has been suggested that in alkaline solution at E approximate to 1.5 V (RHE) reversible electrochemical formation of Ni(IV) peroxide takes place according to the reaction as follows: NiO(OH)(2) + 2OH(-) double left right arrow NiOO2 + 2H(2)O + 2e(-). This reaction accounts for both the under-potential (with respect to E-H2O2/H2O(0) = 1: 77 V) formation of O-2 from NiOO2 peroxide and also small experimental values of dE/dlgi slope (<60 mV) at low anodic current densities, which are characteristic for the two-electron transfer process. It has been inferred that the composition of the gamma-NiOOH phase, indicated in the Bode and revised Pourbaix diagrams, should be similar to 5/6 NiOOH + similar to 1/6 NiOO2. The schemes demonstrating potential-dependent transitions between Ni surface oxygen compounds are presented, and the electrocatalytic mechanisms of OER in alkaline, acid, and neutral medium have been proposed.									132	3	0	0	5	0	134			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000258705000011

In this study, Hi-Nicalon(TM) SiC fibers were annealed and crept at 1500 degrees C for 1 hour in air, an argon flow and an ultra high-purity argon flow in order to investigate the effects of atmospheres and load conditions on the decomposition behavior and microstructural evolution of the fibers. After the fibers were annealed and crept in air, a silica layer with cracks was formed on the fiber surface. Under the creep load, the silica layer became thicker and porous due to the oxidation mechanism change from diffusion of ionic oxygen to transportation of oxygen molecules. An oxygen-enriched amorphous layer was formed at the fiber surface in the case of annealing in an argon flow, whereas SiC crystals were produced by the gas-phase reaction on the fiber surface when the fiber was crept in an argon flow. In an ultra high-purity argon flow, SiC crystals grew on the surface of both annealed and crept fibers. Growth of beta-SiC grain was enhanced under low oxygen partial pressure atmospheres and creep load. (C) 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers.									31	6	0	0	0	0	37			0022-2461			WOS:000085040000014

The present work proposed to fabricate hierarchical NiSe-based nanocone arrays on stainless steel (SS) for OER. Firstly, nickel nanosheet array was electrodeposited on SS (Ni/SS). Then, the Ni/SS was selenized via hydrothermal to form NiSe@Ni/SS. Finally, activation was performed by consecutive CV scans to convert NiSe into O-NiSe (O-NiSe@Ni/SS). The influence of selenization temperature and duration time on the morphology and OER performance were systematically investigated. Results showed that the optimized O-NiSe@Ni/SS performed high OER activity and good stability in 1.0 M KOH (pH = 14). To provide a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), an overpotential of 290 mV was needed and a small Tafel slope of 48 mV dec(-1) was observed.

However, it is still unclear how the mechanism of O-O coupling depends on the applied electrode potential. Herein, using water-in-salt electrolytes, we systematically altered the water activity, which enabled us to probe the O-O bond-forming mechanism on heterogeneous Co-based catalysts as a function of applied potential. We discovered that the water-oxidation mechanism is sensitive to the applied potential: At relatively low driving force, the reaction proceeds through an intramolecular oxygen coupling mechanism, whereas the water nucleophilic attack mechanism prevails at high driving force. The observed mechanistic switch has major implications for the understanding and control of the water-oxidation reaction on heterogeneous catalysts.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2451-9294			WOS:000685496400010

Herein, Mg doped Ni layered double hydroxides (NiMg-LDHs) were prepared by a novel 2-methyl-imidazole-assisted solvothermal route. Mg-induced generation of oxygen vacancies in the NiMg-LDH host layers during the synthetic process is accountable for the improvement of electron transfer and OH- anion adsorption during electrolysis. Thus NiMg-LDHs exhibit an enhanced performance for the electrocatalytic OER with a low over-potential (eta(10): 254 mV) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and high mass activity (56.3 A g(-1)) at an overpotential of 321 mV. The electro-catalytic activity was further improved after introducing reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to form hybrid composites of NiMg-LDHs/Go with decreasing of eta(10) to 232 mV. This finding highlights the promise of s-block metals in regulating electrocatalytic activity for the OER, which is helpful for extending the scope of superior electrocatalysts in energy-related fields.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000451380800003

We herein report the preparation of a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst, composed of Co/ZnCo2O4 nanoparticles sandwiched in leaf-like nitrogen-doped carbon microplates interwoven with carbon nanotubes (denoted as Co/ ZnCo2O4@NC-CNTs). Owing to large amount of metal-Nx and Co3+ active sites as well as the interwove CNTs on the surface of carbon microplates, the Co/ZnCo2O4@NC-CNTs catalyst reveals excellent ORR/OER activities manifested as a small potential gap (Delta E = 0.70 V), a superior high-power density of 305 mW cm(-2) and a stable rechargeability of up to 103 h with the Zn-air battery. Meanwhile, the Co/ZnCo2O4@NC-CNTs-based flexible solid-state Zn-air battery also exhibits competitive peak power density (151 mW cm(-2)), robust flexibility and integrability.									75	4	0	0	1	0	76			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000634228600001

In this work, five different rare earth (RE) metals doped (La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Er) Ag-nanoparticles-decorated alpha-Co(OH)(2) nanostructured electrocatalysts, which are grown on nickel foam (NF), are successfully prepared by a facile one-step hydrothermal approach. It is found that La-doped 2D ultrathin (similar to 2.0 nm) CoAg nanosheets arrays (denoted as La-CoAg/NF) can demonstrate the highest electrochemical activity towards OER in 1 M KOH solution among these RE-doped electrocatalysts. It delivers the lowest overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) (233 mV), the smallest Tafel slope (44.3 mV dec(-1)) and extraordinary stability for 35 h with no significant change during harsh OER process. The reasons for the enhanced performance may come from unique ultrathin 2D nanostructure and La-induced strong electronic interaction among Co, Ag, and La atoms.

J	Wang, Jie; Wang, Gui-Chang								Dynamic Evolution of Methane Oxidation on Pd-Based Catalysts: A Reactive Force Field Molecular Dynamics Study								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C											10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c04841		AUG 2022			2022	Studying the dynamic evolution of the reaction process that identifies the key intermediate is important for elaborating the reaction mechanism, but it is still challenging from the point of view of the experiment. Methane oxidation over Pd-based catalysts including Pd (111) with different oxygen coverages and PdO (101) is studied by reactive force field molecular dynamic simulations in this work to explore the dynamic character of oxygen species like chemisorbed oxygen and lattice oxygen on the C-H bond activation and the C-O bond formation. The results show that methane oxidation on the Pd (111) surfaces is initiated by the direct dissociation of methane molecules (CH4-* CH3 + H) rather than the oxygen-assisted dissociation (CH4 + O-* CH3 + OH), which is in agreement with the first-principle electronic structure calculation results. A comparison of methane oxidation at different oxygen coverages shows that the catalytic activity increases with the increase of oxygen pressure in general: There is no CO at low oxygen coverage and CO is formed at higher oxygen coverage up to 3/9 ML, but no CO2 is formed. This is because the C-O bond formation barrier is higher than the H- O bond formation barrier. Therefore, it is in favor of the formation of OH species instead of the CO2 formation for methane oxidation on metallic Pd. On the PdO (101) surface, we notice that the lattice oxygen species are more active compared to the chemisorbed oxygen species in both the activation of methane and the oxidation of CHx species due to its strong hydrogen affinity and high electron density, leading to high methane oxidation activity and ultimately CO2 formation. Importantly, a novel path for the CO2 formation via a dioxymethylene (H2COO) intermediate (CH2O + O-* H2COO) or a hydroxymethoxy (H2COOH) intermediate (CH2O + OH-* H2COOH) has been identified from our present reactive force field molecular dynamic simulations, which is generally ignored in the static electronic structure scheme like density functional theory. It is hoped that the present results would be a guide for the rational design of the methane oxidation catalysts by controlling the active phase of Pd (or Pt) or provide more essential knowledge for a better understanding of the methane oxidation or methane reformation reaction mechanism.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000841290200001

How to develop a facile and universal strategy for significantly improving their catalytic performance is of great significance, but still faces great challenges. Herein, a series of cobalt-based nanowires (CoS2, CoP, CoF2, and Co3O4) are synthesized and used as conceptual examples to explore the universality to enhance their OER catalytic activity. The FeOOH-modified cobalt-based electrocatalysts exhibit significantly improved OER catalytic performance compared to the pristine samples. Especially, the optimal CoS2@FeOOH material delivers the smallest overpotential of 260 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), which outperforms most of the reported excellent materials. Notably, the CoP|| CoP@FeOOH electrolyzer (1.63 V@30 mA cm(-2)) delivers higher performance than the CoS2|| CoS2@FeOOH electrolyzer (1.72 V@30 mA cm(-2)) benefiting from the better HER catalytic activity of CoP. In addition, the post-characterizations confirm that the real catalytic structure of those electrocatalysts consists of a surface CoOOH@FeOOH catalytic layer and cobalt-based nanowire core. The Co-Fe catalytic layer provides more active centers for the adsorption and dissociation of water molecules as well as the formation of oxygen, while the nanowire core acts as an electron transport channel to realize better reaction kinetics. Our work not only develops a general strategy to enhance the catalytic activity but also provides new ideas for the facile design of other advanced catalytic materials. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

The associated reaction mechanism has been assigned to a transformation from layered to spinel, accompanied a partial oxygen removal process from the surface. Nevertheless, many questions are still unanswered concerning the influence of oxygen extraction and reaction on the chemical composition and evolution of the electrode/electrolyte interphase. Quantitative Li-7, F-19 and P-31 MAS NMR shows that the partial oxygen extraction at the surface of the electrode material above 4.5 V has a strong influence on the composition/nature of the interphase and exacerbates reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Oxygen reacts as soon as it is extracted from the structure of the positive electrode material to form fluorophosphates in much higher amount in the case of the overlithiated material compared to the stoichiometric material exposed to comparable potentials. The presented study indicates that the release of oxygen from the Li-rich layered oxides greatly influences the electrode/electrolyte interphasial chemistry. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, cross-linked Al-doped CoP nanosheets on three-dimensional (3D) nickel foam (Al-CoP/NF) are synthesized by a simple low-temperature phosphidation method using a CoAl layer double hydroxide precursor and exhibit high activity and good stability towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at all pH values, with low overpotentials of 51 mV (0.5 M H2SO4, pH = 0), 66 mV (1.0 M KOH, pH = 14) and 83 mV (1.0 M PBS, pH = 7) to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). In addition, this self-supported electrode shows excellent activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, affording an anodic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 330 mV. As a result, Al-CoP/NF as a bifunctional electrocatalyst can afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.63 V over a long-term overall water splitting operation in 1.0 M KOH. The remarkable catalytic performance of the self-supported Al-CoP/NF is closely associated with its outstanding structural advantages such as a 3D conductive framework, fascinating porous characteristics and Al doping. This study might open up a new route to improve the activity and durability of self-supported electrocatalysts by heteroatom doping.									49	7	0	0	1	0	49			2052-1553			WOS:000457275000005

Then, the composite electrode was fabricated by using 13X zeolite and aniline monomer in nickel foam by electropolymerization technique in an acidic medium (13X/PANI). The synthesized 13X zeolite was characterized by physicochemical characterization techniques such as Fourier transform infra-red (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern and nitrogen sorption isotherm. 13X/PANI composite was further analyzed by XRD, XPS and FE-SEM techniques. Furthermore, the catalyst activity of the synthesized 13X, PANI and 13X/PANI composite electrodes was evaluated in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by using linear square voltammetry (LSV) and Tafel slope method. The Tafel slopes of HER were found to be 203 mV dec(-1), 440 mV dec(-1) and 282 mV dec(-1) for 13X, PANI and 13X/PANI-15 electrodes respectively. While the OER Tafel slopes were found to be 423 mV dec(-1), 310 mV dec(-1) and 168 mV dec(-1) for 13X, PANI and 13X/PANI-15, respectively. 13X/PANI-15 electrodes show excellent catalytic performance about the overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and the overpotential at 20 mA cm(-2) for OER. The obtained results suggest fabricated novel electrodes are a potential candidate for HER and OER reaction and can be open new avenue for other electrochemical reactions.

However, for this technology to become realizable, round-trip efficiency issues and slow kinetics at the cathode require implementation of a catalyst. With design parameters not well understood and limitations on material selection, choosing an ideal catalyst is complex. In Li-air batteries, energy storage is achieved by reactions between Li and O oxygen reduction reaction for discharge and oxygen evolution reaction for charge). Here, phosphorene is proposed as a solution through simulations of its catalytic behavior toward discharge initiated via either O-2 dissociation or Li adsorption. After obtaining intermediate geometries for both nucleation paths leading to either Li2O2 or 2(Li2O), free-energy diagrams are generated to predict the promoted discharge product of Li2O2. Furthermore, considering a final product of Li2O2, the overpotentials are predicted to be 1.44 V for discharge and 2.63 V for charge. Activation barriers for the catalytic decomposition of Li2O2 (during charge) are found to be 1.01 eV for phosphorene versus 2.06 eV for graphene. This leads to a major difference in reaction rate up to 10(17) times in favor of phosphorene. These results, complemented by electronic analysis, establish phosphorene as a promising catalyst for Li-air batteries.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000455561200051	30521304

The catalyst improved catalytic OER performance with the lowest overpotential of 260 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 79 mV dec(-1), which is smaller than that of ZnO/Co3O4 and O-CNT. The catalyst exhibited fast electron transfer and high electrical conductivity owing to the O-CNT that acted as a conducting support, and the introduction of ZnO synergistically enhanced the OER activity of the synthesized catalyst. The specific activity and turnover frequency of the ZnO/Co3O4@O-CNT catalyst at an overpotential of 400 mV were 0.130 mA cm(-2) and 2.45 s(-1), respectively, which are considerably higher than those of pristine ZnO/Co3O4 (0.024 mA cm(-2), 0.23 s(-1)) and O-CNT (0.012 mA cm(-2), 0.03 s(-1)). The high catalytic performance of the catalyst is attributed to the presence of oxygen functional groups, which induced a high electrochemical surface area, additional active site exposure, fast electron transfer, and enhanced dispersion of the catalyst. Thus, the synthesized ZnO/Co3O4@O-CNT catalyst can be a good candidate as an alternative to high-cost noble metals for OER performance. (c) 2022 The Electrochemical Society ("ECS").

Traditional technologies have poor selectivity for lithium recovery from waste LIBs. Metallic Ni, Co, and Mn are usually recovered by leaching, precipitation, and solvent extraction. These recycling methods are costly and have a long recycling route and high potential for secondary waste generation. In this paper, a mechanochemical activation approach was proposed for the selective recycling of lithium and recovery of Ni0.5Mn0.3Co0.2(OH)(2) from spent LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2 batteries. The leaching efficiency and Li selectivity were found to be 95.10% and 100%, respectively. The structure of Ni0.5Mn0.3Co0.2(OH)(2) was investigated using various characterisation techniques. The selective reaction mechanism of mechanochemical activation was identified. High-purity Li2CO3 (99.96 wt%) was obtained. Electrochemical tests showed that the performance of Ni0.5Mn0.3Co0.2(OH)(2) was comparable to that of a commercial oxygen evolution reaction catalyst (IrO2). This research demonstrates an effective and shorter route from waste to a functional material during recycling spent LIBs that incorporates the principles of green chemistry and shows great potential for practical application.

Cracking in the Li2MnO3 center dot LiMO2 electrode particle under operando microscopy observation was revealed to be initiated by the solid-solution reaction of the LiMO2 phase on charge to 4.55 V vs Li+/Li and intensified during further charge to 4.7 V vs Li+/Li during the concurrent two-phase reaction of the LiMO2 phase, involving the largest lattice change of any phase, and oxygen evolution from the Li2MnO3 phase. Notably, significant healing of the generated cracks in the Li2MnO3 center dot LiMO2 electrode particle occurred during subsequent lithiation on discharge, with this rehealing being principally associated with the solid-solution reaction of the LiMO2 phase. This work reveals that while it is the reduction of lattice size of electrode phases during charge that results in cracking of the Li2MnO3 center dot LiMO2 electrode particle, with the extent of cracking correlated to the magnitude of the size change, crack healing is possible in the reverse solid-solution reaction occurring during discharge. Importantly, it is the phase separation during the two-phase reaction of the LiMO2 phase that prevents the complete healing of the electrode particle, leading to pulverization over extended cycling. This work points to the minimization of behavior leading to phase separation, such as two-phase and oxygen evolution, as a key strategy in preventing capacity fade of the electrode.									82	10	0	0	4	0	83			0002-7863			WOS:000380295600030	27314640

The reaction kinetics of a redox couple is dependent on the chemical valence and is a key issue in electrocatalytic performance. In this study, a metallic Co catalyst was synthesized by pyrolyzing Co(OH)(2). The effect of the chemical valence of Co on the oxygen reduction reaction ( ORR) was investigated by comparing the electrocatalytic properties of three Co-based catalysts containing Co-0, Co2+, and Co3+. The electrocatalytic properties were evaluated mainly by linear scan voltammetry (LSV) and a direct borohydride fuel cell (DBFC) where the Co-based catalysts were used as cathodes. The LSV results show that the ORR peak current density increases with a decrease in chemical valence. The DBFC with the Co-0 cathode exhibits highest power density and good durability. In situ X-ray diffraction combined with in situ X-ray absorption fine structure tests was carried out to reveal the dynamic microstructure evolution of the Co-0 cathode during ORR. The in situ results clearly demonstrate the evolution of metallic Co to Co(OH) (2) and then to CoOOH during the ORR.									1	1	0	0	0	0	2			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000416054400046	29125605

However, to date, little attention has been paid to the effect of using heteroatomoccupied lattice sites on the energy level to engineer electrocatalytic activity. In order to explore heteroatom-engineered energy levels of spinel Co3O4 for highly-effective oxygen electrocatalysts, herein Al atoms are directly introduced into the crystal lattice by occupying the Co(2+)ions in the tetrahedral sites and Co(3+)ions in the octahedral sites (denoted as Co-Td(2+) and Co-Oh(3+), respectively). Experimental and theoretical simulations demonstrate that Al3+ ions substituting Co-Td(2+) and Co-Oh(3+) active sites, especially Al3+ ions occupying the Co-Td(2+) sites, optimizes the adsorption, activation, and desorption features of intermediate species during oxygen evolution reaction (OER) processes. As a result, the optimized Co1.75Al1.25O4 nanosheet exhibit unprecedented OER activity with an ultralow overpotential of 248 mV to deliver a current of 10 mA cm(-2), among the best Co-based OER electrocatalysts. This work should not only provide fundamental understanding of the effect of Al-occupied different Co sites in Co3-xAlxO4 composites on OER performance, but also inspire the design of low-cost, earth-abundant, and high-active electrocatalysts toward water oxidation.									25	5	0	0	0	0	26			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000463290700008	30735295

Herein, we report a defect-rich samarium ortho-ferrite interfaced with samarium-doped nickel ferrite (SFO/Sm-NFO) as an efficient OER electrocatalyst. By multiple in situ ion-exchanges and calcination processes, the inverse degree and defects of SFO/Sm-NFO are effectively regulated to modulate the electronic structure at the interface. Our experimental and theoretical studies show that the Sm doping in NFO inverse spinels facilitates the rearrangement of Ni atoms to the octa-hedral sites that are the active site for OER. This enables highly enhanced OER activity as manifested by a low overpotential of 228 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) (Tafel slope = 38.6 mV dec(-1)) with excellent stability at 500 and 1000 mA cm(-2) for 100 h. This work provides useful insights into the rational designing of multimetallic nanohybrids for active and practical electrocatalysts.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000809955900001

In this study, Cu-doped LaFeO3 samples were prepared and used as heterogeneous catalysts of PMS for the degradation of pharmaceuticals. Compared to LaFeO3 (LFO), the increased catalytic activity of LaFe1-xCuxO3 (LFCO) samples was observed, among which LFCO-7.5 exhibited the best performance. The enhanced catalytic activity of LFCO-7.5 was attributable to the generation of abundant oxygen vacancies. Hydroxyl radicals, sulfate radicals, superoxide and singlet oxygen were detected in the LFCO-7.5/PMS system. However, selective effects of radical scavengers on the degradation of different pharmaceuticals and selective reactivity of singlet oxygen toward different pharmaceuticals indicate the existence of compound-specific degradation mechanisms in the LFCO-7.5/PMS system. Furthermore, possible degradation pathways of SDZ and the toxicity evolution were investigated during sulfadiazine (SDZ) degradation. This study further enhances our knowledge on the degradation reaction mechanisms of organic pollutants in PMS activation processes.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773585700004

Use of EIS in different areas of energy research wherever current, potential, and charge determine the performance has become inevitable. Electrocatalytic water splitting is one of such fields focused on generating high purity hydrogen, where EIS is used to correlate the activity trends measuring charge transfer resistances (R-ct). In doing so, different conventions are followed. A few perform EIS at the open circuit potential (OCP), a few perform at onset potential or at a potential before onset potential, a few perform at different potentials for different catalysts at which they deliver the same current density, and a large group of people choose a constant potential beyond onset, at which all the studied catalysts show appreciable catalytic activity. Existence of such different practices in using EIS to characterize water splitting electrocatalysts often lead to misinterpretation of the activity trends. Hence, to provide a clear view on the appropriate use of EIS in water splitting electrocatalysis, we have carried out a comparative EIS study on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity trend of stainless steel 304 (SS-304), Co, Ni, and Cu foils in 1 M KOH at all the above-stated conditions and the results showed that the EIS carried out at constant potentials in the catalytic turnover region is appropriate.									61	0	0	0	1	0	61			2196-0216			WOS:000536495700012

In this study, a mechanistic understanding of the degradation of an IrO2 anode co-catalyst under transient operation of a PEMFC is provided. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in reductive atmosphere (3.3 vol.% H-2/Ar) shows that IrO2 is not stable in H-2 containing atmosphere at operational temperatures of PEMFCs. By conducting a series of physical-chemical and electrochemical analyses, it is proven that H-2 under the operating conditions in a PEMFC anode can chemically reduce a few outer monolayers of the surface of IrO2 nanoparticles to metallic Ir. The metallic Ir formed on the IrO2 surface can then dissolve during fuel cell start-up/shut-down (SUSD) cycles. At least part of the dissolved Ir species formed in the anode electrode are shown to diffuse through the membrane to the cathode electrode, where they lead to a deterioration of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of the Pt cathode catalyst. The consequences of Ir dissolution on the cell reversal tolerance of the anode are also discussed.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000669982100001

This unique nanostructure possesses a large fraction of low-coordinated surface atoms and highly accessible surface areas due to its atomic thickness and mesoporosity, which could provide abundant active sites and facilitate the electrode/electrolyte contact for OER catalysis. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the loss of the neighboring layers gives the ultrathin nanostructure remarkable lattice distortion, which leads to decreased energy barriers for facile mass conversion and transfer on the surface of the catalyst. As a result, the graphene-like holey Co3O4 nanosheets exhibit excellent OER catalytic performance with low onset potential of 0.617 V vs. Hg/HgO, high current density of 12.26 mA cm(-2) at 0.8 V vs. Hg/HgO, and long-term stability with negligible fading in current density after 2000 cycles, significantly outperforming the performances of conventional Co3O4 nanostructures and commercial IrO2. This unique graphene-like holey structure should be of great benefit for applications ranging from electronic devices to energy conversion and storage systems.									157	14	0	0	6	0	158			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000390636100033

FeCo/N-C exhibits excellent activities toward both the ORR (half-wave potential of 0.84 V) and OER (overpotential of 345 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)), which are comparable to those of commercial Pt/C and RuO2, and by far exceeding their counterparts Fe/N-C and Co/N-C. Furthermore, the FeCo/N-C catalyst was evaluated in a rechargeable Zn-air battery for the full-cell test. The FeCo/N-C based battery is more durable with a smaller round-trip overpotential after 800 cycles than the battery using an expensive Pt/C + RuO2 mixture catalyst.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000713285300001	34723297

This metabolic pathway recycles phosphoglycolate, a toxic compound, back to phosphoglycerate, when oxygen substitutes for carbon dioxide in the first reaction of photosynthetic carbon fixation. The recovery of phosphoglycerate is accompanied by considerable carbon and energy losses, making photorespiration a prime target for crop improvement. The genomics era has allowed the precise functional analysis of individual reaction steps of the photorespiratory cycle, and more links integrating photorespiration with cellular metabolism as a whole are becoming apparent. Here we review the evolutionary origins of photorespiration as well as new insights into the interaction with other metabolic processes such as nitrogen assimilation and mitochondria! respiration.									408	21	1	0	379	1	419			1360-1385	1878-4372		WOS:000279311500004	20403720

In this reported study, we detail the synthesis of an N-doped hollow graphene nanospheres/CNTs architecture with encapsulated Fe3C@C nanoparticles (Fe3C@C-NGns-NCNTs) via a facile, in situ fabrication method. The resulting catalyst had a high specific surface area (450 m(2) g(-1)) with a hierarchical meso-macroporous structure. In an alkaline electrolyte, the catalyst manifested remarkable bifunctional catalytic activity with a half-wave potential for ORR of ca. 23 mV that was higher than that produced by a commercial Pt/C and the former had a small overpotential of 412 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER. The Delta E (oxygen electrode activity parameter) value for the Fe3C@C-NGns-NCNTs was only 0.787 V. We posit that the high electrocatalytic performance of this catalyst was due to the following factors: (1) a synergistic effect, induced by the presence of multiple types of active sites, including Fe3C@C nanoparticle, nitrogen dopant and possible Fe-N-x-C sites; (2) the unique hollow graphene nanospheres/CNTs architecture, which facilitated the adsorption/diffusion of reactants/products and rapid electron transfer; and (3) the high degree of graphitization of the catalyst that improved the electrocatalytic stability.

We extend a phenomenological expression for the reaction rate, proposed recently by Gasques [Phys. Rev. C 72, 025806 (2005)] for the one-component plasma of nuclei, to the multicomponent plasma. The expression contains several fit parameters which we adjust to reproduce the best microscopic calculations available in the literature. Furthermore, we show that pycnonuclear burning is drastically affected by an (unknown) structure of the multicomponent matter (a regular lattice, a uniform mix, etc.). We apply the results to study nuclear burning in a C-12-O-16 mixture. In this context, we present new calculations of the astrophysical S factors for carbon-oxygen and oxygen-oxygen fusion reactions. We show that the presence of a C-O lattice can strongly suppress carbon ignition in white dwarf cores and neutron star crusts at densities rho greater than or similar to 3x10(9) g cm(-3) and temperatures T less than or similar to 10(8) K.									94	2	0	0	0	0	94			0556-2813	1089-490X		WOS:000240873300063

Nevertheless, its HER activity is far from that of platinum-containing electrocatalysts. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a novel strategy to simultaneously increase the number of active sites (N-AC) and decrease charge-transfer resistance (RCT) to favor HER. Herein, we have demonstrated an efficient approach to etching oxygen-incorporated MoS2 (O-MoS2) nanosheet arrays on carbon cloth for excellent electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The influence of temperature (T) at the etching stage and the concentration of ammonium fluoride ([NH4F]) on the micro-structure and HER activity of the as-obtained catalysts have been systematically investigated. The higher etching temperature or [NH4F] is achieved; the faster etching kinetics is obtained. At slow etching kinetics, the etching degree of O-MoS2 nanosheets is relatively low, which cannot supply sufficient unsaturated sulfur atoms for HER. At fast etching, the balance between active site and electron transfer for these etched nanosheets is achieved, which is available to efficient HER. However, excessive etching leads to inefficient HER because of the unsatisfactory RCT. The optimized elctrocatalysts exhibit the superior HER activity among all samples, accompanied by excellent catalytic stability. Therefore, this work promises important application in production of hydrogen.									12	0	0	0	0	0	11			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000479082900030

The electrodeposition follows the same reaction scheme previously reported in the literature for PbO2. The electrocatalytic activity of the resulting oxides is assessed for the reactions of O-2 and O-3 evolution. Fluoride and iron into PbO2 have different effects on the electrocatalytic activity of PbO2 for O-2 evolution and O-3 formation. With F-PbO2 the first process is favoured and the second one inhibited, whereas with Fe-PbO2 electrodes we observed the opposite trend. Lead dioxide grown from F- and Fe(III) containing solutions showed the highest activity for O-3 formation. The larger amount of iron incorporated into PbO2 in the presence of F- is proposed as a possible cause of the enhanced activity for ozone formation of (F-Fe)-PbO2 electrodes.

Pure oxygen was shown to evolve from Ce(SO4)(2) solution and pure hydrogen from Ce-2(SO4)(3) solution with stoichiometric formation of Ce-2(SO4)(3) and Ce(SO4)(2), respectively.The rate of photocatalytic hydrogen production was lower than the rate of photocatalytic oxygen production on the same catalyst. The influence of initial cerium salt concentration, acidity and catalyst loading was checked for photocatalytic oxygen and hydrogen production. The dependences of the hydrogen and oxygen production rate on Ce3+ and Ce" concentration have maxima. Kinetic equation for the rate of photocatalytic oxygen production was proposed that takes into account the inner filter effect; constants of this equation were calculated. Optimal conditions for photocatalytic reactions were found and explained.The shuttle charge transfer regime was tested for consecutive O-2 and H-2 production over the same and different portions of catalyst and same Ce3+/Ce4+ system. It was found that separate catalyst batches are needed to avoid mixed evolution of hydrogen and oxygen, (C) 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Based on their translational energy distributions and evolution behavior, two different formation mechanisms are proposed: One is exothermic recombination reaction of OH radicals, OH+OH -> H2O+O(P-3(J)) and the other is the photodissociation of OH radicals on the surface of amorphous solid water. The translational and internal energy distributions of OH radicals as well as the evolution behavior were also measured by REMPI to elucidate the roles of H2O2 and OH in the O(P-3(J)) formation mechanisms.

However, the practical application of ZAB relies heavily on developing durable support materials to replace conventional carbon supports which have unrecoverable corrosion issues, severely jeopardizing ZAB performance. Herein, a novel porous FeCo glassy alloy is developed as a bifunctional catalytic support for ZAB. The conducting skeleton of the porous glassy alloy is used to stabilize oxygen reduction cocatalysts, and more importantly, the FeCo serves as the primary phase for oxygen evolution. To demonstrate the concept of catalytic glassy alloy support, ultrasmall Pd nanoparticles are anchored, as oxygen reduction active sites, on the porous FeCo (noted as Pd/FeCo) for ZAB. The Pd/FeCo exhibits a significantly improved electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction (a half-wave potential of 0.85 V) and oxygen evolution (a potential of 1.55 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2)) in the alkaline media. When used in the ZAB, the Pd/FeCo delivers an output power density of 117 mW cm(-2) and outstanding cycling stability for over 200 h (400 cycles), surpassing the conventional carbon-supported Pt/C+IrO2 catalysts. Such an integrated design that combines highly active components with a porous architecture provides a new strategy to develop novel nanostructured electrocatalysts.									25	1	0	0	3	0	25			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000598292200001

Tungsten oxides have been long expected to be promising acidic HER electrocatalysts, whereas the poor intrinsic stability in an alkaline electrolyte and inferior electrical conductivity hamper their application in the alkaline HER. Herein, we design a hierarchical electrocatalyst, Ni loaded on N-doped carbon shell coated oxygen-vacancy-rich WOx nanowires. The composite shows an overpotential of 67 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) and 164 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, which is highly comparable to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. It also shows long-term electrochemical durability over 20 h. The excellent HER performance of the electrocatalyst is attributed to the synergetic catalytic effects between the highly dispersed Ni nanoparticles and the N-doped carbon-encapsulated WOx nanowires with rich oxygen vacancies, as well as the carbon shell endowing enhanced chemical stability.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2398-4902			WOS:000528920000027

Experiments with a slow flow velocity transverse capacitive RF discharge were performed and detailed measurements of the spatial evolution Of O-2(b(1)Sigma(+)(g)), O-2(a(1)Delta(g)), O(P-3) and flow temperature were taken. Simulations of three different experimental configurations were in good agreement with the data for the spatial decay of O-2(b(1)Sigma(+)(g)). The simulations also provided reasonable agreement with experimental data for atomic oxygen, O-2(a(1)Delta(g)) and temperature, where the data were available. Updated electron impact cross-sections for oxygen dissociation were included in the simulations; this proved critical for proper modelling of the production of atomic oxygen and the subsequent decay of O-2(b(1)Sigma(+)(g)). At low oxygen atom densities the decay Of O-2(b(1)Sigma(+)(g)) was principally from heterogeneous quenching. For the slow flow velocity experiment, O atom recombination and O-2(b(1)Sigma(+)(g)) deactivation by the walls play an important role; in the far downstream afterglow region a quasi-stationary O-2(b(1)Sigma(+)(g)) concentration was found owing to a near-equilibrium between the pooling reaction and losses to the walls for this slow velocity case.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000231049400011

This study demonstrates an advanced WES with double superaerophobic electrodes, which are achieved by constructing a nanostructured NiMo alloy and NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) films for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively. The superaerophobic property gives rise to significantly reduced adhesion forces to gas bubbles and thereby accelerates the hydrogen and oxygen bubble releasing behaviors. Benefited from these metrics and the high intrinsic activities of catalysts, this WES affords an early onset potential (approximate to 1.5 V) for water splitting and ultrafast catalytic current density increase (approximate to 0.83 mA mV(-1)), resulting in approximate to 2.69 times higher performance compared to the commercial Pt/C and IrO2/C catalysts based counterpart under 1.9 V. Moreover, enhanced performance at high temperature as well as prominent stability further demonstrate the practical application of this WES.									84	8	0	0	5	0	87			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000376611800012	26997618

In this work, atomic scale structure-activity relationships of two different nano-structured manganese oxides, MnOx, are established using a combination of X-ray absorption, diffraction and electrochemistry. Prepared by chemical symproportionation (s-MnOx) and impregnation (i-MnOx), the s-MnOx catalyst consisted of a layered structure similar to delta-MnO2 while the i-MnOx catalyst displayed a mixture of tunnelled, 3D cross-linked beta- and defective gamma-MnO2 structures. During electrocatalytic oxygen evolution the structural motifs of both MnOx remain largely unchanged, but the oxidation state of Mn increases from 3.5 to 3.9-4. Kinetic parameters of the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction were extracted using Tafel slope analysis and pH titration experiment, and the role of the protons abstracted was analyzed. The study reveals fundamental differences of general importance in the catalytic activity between layered and cross-linked structures. The exclusive presence of di-mu-oxo-bridged Mn ions in the layered structure is coupled to a pronounced redox and charge capacity behaviour. This ensured efficient use of surface and bulk active sites, and resulted in a relatively large Tafel slope. Consequently, the intrinsic OER activity is especially high in s-MnOx. In contrast, 3D cross-linked structures with both mono-and di-mu-oxo-bridged Mn ions resulted in lower intrinsic activity but smaller Tafel slope, and thus favourable activity at technological water-splitting rates. The insights from this comparative study will provide guidance in the structural design and optimization of other non precious metal oxide OER catalysts.									216	5	0	0	28	0	216			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000323198100024

Herein, we report a strongly cooperative spinel nano hybrid as a promising air electrode catalyst for rechargeable Zn-air batteries. Ultrafine sub-10 nm MnFe2O4 crystals are in situ grown on the ultrathin NiCo2O4 nanosheets, leading to a highly effective surface area and a strong synergistic chemical coupling effect. The distinct architecture and complex composition endow an excellent bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic activity in alkaline condition. The practical rechargeable Zn-air battery with the hybrid electrocatalyst demonstrates a high round-trip efficiency (a low discharge-charge voltage gap of 0.81 V at a reversible current density of 10 mA cm(-2)) and an outstanding durability, which outperforms the commercial Pt/Ru/C electrocatalyst. The resulting hybrid (MnFe2O4/NiCo2O4) shows great promise as an alternative bifunctional electrocatalyst to the precious metals for the application in Zn-air batteries.									67	4	0	0	2	0	68			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000437965900042

Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the development of oxygen isotope methods of phosphate and application to understand the biogeochemical cycling of P. With the advent of robust analytical techniques able to accurately determine stable oxygen isotope ratios in phosphate (delta O-18(p)) and the increased understanding of isotope effects from controlled process- or reaction-based studies, delta O-18(p) values have been increasingly applied to identify sources and cycling of P in many natural environments. Because different sources have distinct isotopic compositions and various processes impart specific isotopic fractionation or produce distinct pathways of isotopic evolution, application of delta O-18(p) values as a tracer for Pin biogeochemical processes is expected to continue to expand as an exciting field of research in the future.									43	0	0	0	26	0	43			0065-2113		978-0-12-800137-0	WOS:000334129100001

The means of applying highly efficient solar-thermal conversion on practical electricity-driven water splitting could be a significant stride toward this goal, while some bottlenecks remain unresolved. Herein, photothermic electrocatalytic oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions are proposed, which bestow a distinctive exothermic activation and electrochemical reactivity in a reconstructed electrolyzer system, and which are poised for efficient renewable energy production. Attributed to the synergistic in situ coupling of the N-doped carbon, metallic alloy and oxides, in view of their broadband light absorption, high electrochemical surface area, and efficient charge transfer attributes, the hybrid photothermal electrocatalytic electrode simultaneously satisfies efficient photon-to-heat conversion and augmented electrochemical catalytic activity. Finally, a system level design of an appropriate photothermally mediated electrolytic cell with close-proximity light-illumination window along with a low-thermal-emittance electrolyte separator that preserve an overall large localized thermal gradient and efficient mass transport is devised. Such a photothermally mediated electrocatalytic system presented here may open up new avenues for the development of solar-thermal energy utilization in other forms.									30	2	0	0	7	0	30			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000479632200001	31364796

Here we describe an inexpensive, low-temperature method to synthesize single-crystal orthorhombic phase alpha-Mn2O3 prisms bound by the {100} facets. The synthesis is the first method to use the cation bridging effect to assist in the creation of alpha-Mn2O3 prisms. According to structural analysis using X-ray diffraction, X-ray pair-distribution function (PDF) measurements and high resolution transmission electron microscopy, the material is composed exclusively of alpha-Mn2O3 prisms, and no additional amorphous or nanocrystalline phases are present. Heating the prisms transformed the material to a more symmetrical, cubic phase alpha-Mn2O3 that exhibited strong bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution (OER) and oxygen reduction (ORR) reactions. We compared the oxygen electrode activities (OEA) and found that the alpha-Mn2O3 prisms performed 79% better than commercially- produced alpha-Mn2O3 powders, indicating that these alpha-Mn2O3 prisms perform well as inexpensive, earth-abundant materials for reversible electrodes.									31	0	0	0	1	0	31			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000388369000013	27722388

The highest barrier step is the first proton transfer reaction (0 -> 1). The following reactions involving electron transfers were precisely analyzed in terms of their energies, structures and spin densities. We found that the one-electron transfer from the Mn4Ca cluster to Y161 triggers the O-O sigma bond formation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Here, the significantly enhanced ORR and OER kinetics and stability of a conventional La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) air electrode by an efficient catalyst coating of barium cobaltite (BCO) is reported. The polarization resistance of a BCO-coated LSCF air electrode at 600 degrees C is 0.16 omega cm(2), about 30% of that of the bare LSCF air electrode under the same conditions. Further, an R-PCEC with the BCO-coated LSCF air electrode shows exceptional performance in both fuel cell (peak power density of 1.16 W cm(-2) at 600 degrees C) and electrolysis (current density of 1.80 A cm(-2) at 600 degrees C at 1.3 V) modes. The performance enhancement is attributed mainly to the facilitated rate of oxygen surface exchange.									16	0	0	0	0	0	15			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000672327300001

This method enables effective utilization of one of nature's rarest elements while different substrates facilitate the exploration of promising bimetallic catalysts for a sustainable hydrogen economy. Semi-coherent Ir films were deposited on Au, Pt and Ni substrates using K3IrCl6-Na2SO4-H2SO4 electrolytes operated between 40 degrees C and 70 degrees C. However, the deposition reaction is quenched at the onset of H-2 production where adsorbed H blocks the reduction of IrCl6-xH2Oxx-3 to Ir. The electrode can be reactivated for further deposition by pulsing the potential to more positive values where adsorbed H is oxidized. The electrocatalytic activity of ultrathin Ir and Pt films, and combinations thereof, were examined as function of the number of self-terminating deposition pulses. The ultrathin films match or exceed the best reported activity metrics for hydrogen oxidation in alkaline media and oxygen evolution in acid.									38	1	0	0	1	0	38			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000365412300012

The sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER)(1-4) has long posed one of the biggest challenges in this field, and electrocatalysts based on expensive platinum-group metals are often required to improve the activity and durability of these reactions. The use of alloying(5-7), surface strain(8-11) and optimized coordination environments(12) has resulted in platinum-based nanocrystals that enable very high ORR activities in acidic media; however, improving the activity of this reaction in alkaline environments remains challenging because of the difficulty in achieving optimized oxygen binding strength on platinum-group metals in the presence of hydroxide. Here we show that PdMo bimetallene-a palladium-molybdenum alloy in the form of a highly curved and sub-nanometre-thick metal nanosheet-is an efficient and stable electrocatalyst for the ORR and the OER in alkaline electrolytes, and shows promising performance as a cathode in Zn-air and Li-air batteries. The thin-sheet structure of PdMo bimetallene enables a large electrochemically active surface area (138.7 square metres per gram of palladium) as well as high atomic utilization, resulting in a mass activity towards the ORR of 16.37 amperes per milligram of palladium at 0.9 volts versus the reversible hydrogen electrode in alkaline electrolytes. This mass activity is 78 times and 327 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C and Pd/C catalysts, respectively, and shows little decay after 30,000 potential cycles. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the alloying effect, the strain effect due to the curved geometry, and the quantum size effect due to the thinness of the sheets tune the electronic structure of the system for optimized oxygen binding. Given the properties and the structure-activity relationships of PdMo metallene, we suggest that other metallene materials could show great promise in energy electrocatalysis.									508	39	0	0	20	0	516			0028-0836	1476-4687		WOS:000488832500034	31554968

Herein, we endeavor to introduce a high entropy alloy (HEA) of CuCoNiFeMn as an active model system for a bifunctional electrocatalyst at neutral-pH, synthesized by a room-temperature high-energy-milling process. The formation of a single-phased face-centered-cubic (fcc) HEA with homogenous distribution of each element was confirmed. In neutral electrolyte (PBS, pH 7.4), as-synthesized HEA shows promising performance, i.e., long-term durability for over 20 h, an overpotential of -320 mV vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for the hydrogen evolution reaction, and 680 mV vs. RHE for the oxygen evolution reaction at high current densities, which are lower than for other controlled electrocatalysts as well as being comparable with reported nanostructured electrocatalysts. Besides, HEA shows much smaller electrical and charge transfer resistance values than its controlled un-alloyed counterpart. Our preliminary results could open a new insights to developing nanostructured HEAs that could be used as efficient electrocatalysts in a neutral water splitting system, thus increasing hydrogen production viability.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000678596600001

Due to its toxicity, it urgently needs to be abandoned and its functions fulfilled by new solutions. In the industrial production of sodium chlorate, homogeneous decomposition of the hypochlorite intermediate to chlorate is a key step. As a competing loss reaction, hypochlorite can decompose to oxygen. How chromium(VI) affects these reactions is not well understood.ResultsThis work shows, for the first time, that chromium(VI) selectively accelerates the chlorate formation from hypochlorite both in dilute and concentrated, industrially relevant solutions. The effect of the ionic strength and the specific contribution of different electrolyte components were systematically studied. By simultaneously measuring the concentration decay of hypochlorite (UV-vis spectroscopy) and the oxygen formation (mass spectrometry), both the rate and the selectivity of the reactions were evaluated.ConclusionIn the presence of chromium(VI) the hypochlorite decomposition is described by the sum of an uncatalyzed and a parallel catalyzed reaction, where oxygen only forms in the uncatalyzed reaction. When removing chromium(VI), the homogeneous oxygen formation increases, causing economic and safety concerns. The need for a catalyst selective for chlorate formation is emphasized.

Herein, it is designed one-dimensional rod-like Mn3O4/NiCo2S4 nanostructure. The inner Mn3O4 nanorod and the outer coating of the NiCo2S4 layers make the composite material have a stable structure, thus exhibiting a rather high bifunctional catalytic activity (Delta E = 0.74 V) and long-term durability toward ORR/OER. An interlaced region is formed at the interface of the dual phases by the Kirkendall effect, where Mn3O4/NiCo2S4 nanocrystals, oxygen vacancies and defects co-exist. The Mn3O4/NiCo2S4 exhibits an onset potential of 0.92 V and a half-wave potential of 0.81 V, and the OER potential is only 1.55 Vat 10 mA cm(-2). When using this catalyst in rechargeable ZABs, the batteries show a high power density (106.26 mW cm(-2)), superior rate stability, small charge-discharge voltage gap (0.86 V) and long-term cycles (650 cycles over 216 h at 5 mA cm(-2)). The flexible ZABs exhibit a high open-circuit voltage of 1.427 V and stably cycled 50 cycles (16.8 h) with a small charge-discharge voltage gap (0.5 V) at 1 mA cm(-2).									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000531025800007

Herein we report on the isolation and characterization of the bimetallic Co-Mo alkoxide [Co3Mo4O10(OCH3)(10)(dmf)(4)] (Co3Mo4; dmf=N,N-dimethylformamide), which was prepared by the anion metathesis reaction of the corresponding metal chlorides. The Co-Mo alkoxide was explored as a well-defined precursor of cobalt oxide catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolyte MOH. The catalysts demonstrated excellent activity in the OER, manifested in low onset potentials and Tafel slopes and superb stability under the operating conditions both in alkaline and nearly neutral media. It was observed that the nature of the metal cation of the alkaline electrolyte MOH (M+=Li+, Na+, K+, Cs+) greatly affected the catalytic performance of the material. We propose that the positive effect of larger metal cations on the film activity in the OER could be explained by the higher hydration enthalpies of larger ions and enhanced mass transport within a larger interlayer space between the [CoO2](-) sheets of the in situ formed binary oxides. It may be deduced that this trend is universal and may be extended to other types of metal oxides forming layered structures during the OER.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000445447300029	30030924

Herein, based on the idea that functionalized atoms can adjust the electronic properties of MXenes-based catalysts, we have screened some catalysts with high catalytic activity for ORR/OER using first-principles calculations. Specifically, we firstly explored the stability of Pt doped Ti2CNL ((N = F, Cl, Br and I, L = O, S and Se)) and Ti2CN(L)2 though calculating the vacancy formation energy and binding energy. Moreover, compared the overpotential of Pt doped Ti2CN(L)2 and Ti2CNL for ORR and OER, the Janus-MXenes configurations can tune the d-band center, work-function, density of state (DOS) and charge distribution of the catalysts, and then improve the catalytic performance of catalysts. Pt-VS-Ti2CSBr, Pt-VI-Ti2COI and Pt-VS-Ti2CSBr as ORR, OER and ORR/OER bifunctional catalysts were revealed due to their ultra-low overpotential of 0.35, 0.34 and 0.79 V, respectively. Additionally, compared to H ions, the catalyst preferentially adsorbs O2, thus ensuring the ORR advantage to proceed rather than hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Even so, Pt-VO-Ti2COI, Pt-VS-Ti2CSI and Pt-VSe-Ti2CSeI have high activity for HER. Our work not only screened out catalysts with encouraging catalytic performance but also guided the design of high-performance catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000802586500003

A simplified calcium-alkali-silicate system was created to simulate the multiple interactions among reactive silica, alkaline solution and portlandite near the aggregate surface during the formation and evolution of the reaction rim in an alkali-silica reaction. A transport barrier preventing the migration of calcium and silicate through itself was found on the interface between the alkali silicate and the calcium hydroxide. The barrier was mainly composed of calcium alkali silicate with silicon-oxygen organizations of Q(2) and Q(3) according to the results of Si-29 nuclear magnetic resonance, the calcium to silica mole ratio ranging from 0.22 to 0.53 and the alkali to silica ratio ranging from 0.20 to 0.26 based the location of the elemental compositional analysis and the storage period of the system.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1996-1944			WOS:000383456800009	28773793

Electron transfer from Co3O4 to Co-3(PO4)(2), together with the special networked structure and the porous nature of the nanosheets enable the Co-3(PO4)(2)-Co3O4 hybrid to have a high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and outstanding stability in alkaline electrolyte, e.g., an overpotential of 270 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and a Tafel slope of 39 mV dec(-1), which are superior to most non-noble metal-based OER electrocatalysts reported thus far and as well the commercial RuO2 electrocatalyst. Furthermore, Co-3(PO4)(2)-Co3O4 hybrid is demonstrated to be used as an efficient cocatalyst to enhance the photoelectrochemical OER performance of BiVO4 photoanode. A significantly increased photocurrent density of 3.0 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE), and a potential reduction of 530 mV with respect to that of bare BiVO4 at the photocurrent density of 0.5 mA cm(-2) are achieved. The electron transfer-induced enhancement of OER by a hybrid structure may pave the new routes for the design and synthesis of low-cost catalysts for electrochemical and photoelectrochemical oxygen evolution.									46	1	0	0	1	0	46			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000417566500018	28922550

Electrochemical reactions on graphite cathodes in high-voltage capacitors								28th Symposium for Passive Electronic Components								253	4, 259-60						2008	2008	In a recent CARTS contribution, we demonstrated that activated carbon in the form of graphite printed onto titanium substrates is a viable cathode material for high-voltage implantable cardioverter-defibrillator capacitors. In this paper, we report on the electrochemical properties of the graphite-on-titanium cathode in aqueous electrolytes. We have characterized electrochemical reactions on the graphite cathode as a function of electrode potential and electrolyte pH. In the potential range from -0.1 to about -0 7 V the reduction of molecular oxygen to hydrogen peroxide was observed. This reaction is diffusion limited and dependent upon the oxygen concentration at the electrode-electrolyte interface It controls the self-discharge of this electrode. At potentials more negative than -0 7 V and at pH values of 5 and larger, the hydrogen evolution reaction was the dominant charge transfer reaction. We conclude that none of these reactions impact the performance of the capacitor provided that the cathode is properly designed.					28th Symposium for Passive Electronic Components28th Symposium for Passive Electronic Components	17-20 March 200817-20 March 2008	ECAECA	Newport Beach, CA, USANewport Beach, CA, USA	0	0	0		0	0	0					0-7908-0118-3	INSPEC:11115243

Li-O-2 cells with PtAu/C were found to exhibit the highest round-trip efficiency reported to date. During OAR via xLi(+) + O-2 + xe(-) -> LixO2 the discharge voltage with PtAu/C was considerably higher than that of pure carbon and comparable to that of Au/C. During OER via LixO2 -> xLi(+) + O-2 + xe(-), the charge voltages with PtAu/C fell in the range from 3.4 to 3.8 V-Li, which is slightly lower than obtained with Pt. It is hypothesized that PtAu NPs exhibit bifunctional catalytic activity, having surface Au and Pt atoms primarily responsible for ORR and OER kinetics in Li-O-2 cells, respectively.									1064	73	0	0	66	1	1109			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000281460100006	20527774

Spectroscopy of iron-oxo intermediates and density functional theory calculations								CHEMICAL SCIENCE				6	10			5891	5903		10.1039/c5sc01680k				2015	2015	The macrocyclic [Fe-III(L1)Cl-2](+) (1, L1 = N,N'-dimethyl-2,11-diaza[3,3](2,6) pyridinophane) complex is an active catalyst for the oxidation of water to oxygen using [NH4](2)[Ce-IV(NO3)(6)] (CAN), NaIO4, or Oxone as the oxidant. The mechanism of 1-catalysed water oxidation was examined by spectroscopic methods and by O-18-labelling experiments, revealing that Fe-IV=O and/or Fe-V=O species are likely to be involved in the reaction. The redox behaviour of 1 and these high-valent Fe=O species of L1 has been examined by both cyclic voltammetry and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In aqueous solutions, the cyclic voltammograms of 1 at different pH show a pH-dependent reversible couple (E-1/2 = +0.46 V vs. SCE at pH 1) and an irreversible anodic wave (E-pa = +1.18 V vs. SCE at pH 1) assigned to the Fe-III/Fe-II couple and the Fe-III to Fe-IV oxidation, respectively. DFT calculations showed that the E value of the half reaction involving [Fe-V(L1)(O)(OH)](2+)/[Fe-IV(L1)(O)(OH2)](2+) is + 1.42 V vs. SCE at pH 1. Using CAN as the oxidant at pH 1, the formation of an Fe-IV=O reaction intermediate was suggested by ESI-MS and UV-vis absorption spectroscopic measurements, and the rate of oxygen evolution was linearly dependent on the concentrations of both 1 and CAN. Using NaIO4 or Oxone as the oxidant at pH 1, the rate of oxygen evolution was linearly dependent on the concentration of 1, and a reactive Fe-V=O species with formula [Fe-V(L1)(O)(2)](+) generated by oxidation with NaIO4 or Oxone was suggested by ESI-MS measurements. DFT calculations revealed that [Fe-V(L1)(O)(2)](+) is capable of oxidizing water to oxygen with a reaction barrier of 15.7 kcal mol(-1).									53	2	0	0	5	0	53			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000361212000066	29861914

The model is based upon theoretical and experimental findings that indicate that the dominant reaction pathway leading to NH3 decomposition is via direct abstraction of an H atom from adsorbed ammonia via adsorbed oxygen or OH.The temporal evolution of the dynamic defects that are created during the phase transition is also explicitly introduced in the model. The important role of the average concentration of defects has been shown in experiments of forcing on the NO + CO reaction on Pt{100}.In the present work we show that the role of such defects is also important in determining the characteristics of the oscillatory regime of the NO + NH3 reaction on Pt{100}.The predictions of the model agree with experimental results significantly better than previous mean-field models.

Two primary processes, including oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occur on the air cathode and dominate the battery performance during battery charging and discharging. Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent-organic frameworks (COFs) emerge as promising cathode catalysts due to their structure and composition superiority. The unique characteristics of MOFs and COFs contribute to improved performance. This review mainly summarizes the recent applications of MOFs and COFs in a series of MABs, mainly including lithium- and zinc-air batteries. Additionally, some critical issues are emphasized regarding MOFs and COFs used in other MABs limited progress, their fabrication and alternatives to potential problems.

This article reports the integration of cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) and cobalt borate (Co-Bi) OECs with three-dimensional (3D) graphene foam (GF) for the electrocatalytic water oxidation reaction. The GF showed a unique advantage to serve as a highly conductive 3D support with large capacity for anchoring and loading Co-OECs, thereby facilitating mass and charge transfer due to the large amount of active sites provided by the 3D graphene scaffold. As a result, this integrated system of GF and Co-OECs exhibits synergistically enhanced catalytic activity. The overpotential (eta) of Co-Pi and Co-Bi/graphene catalysts is about 0.390 and 0.315 V in neutral solutions, respectively. Besides, the integrated Co-OECs/graphene catalysts have also exhibited improved and stable oxygen evolution catalytic ability in alkaline solution.									44	15	0	0	9	0	46			2095-9273	2095-9281		WOS:000360550800005

Crystalline phase without impurities was verified by XRD, FTIR, TEM and Mossbauer techniques. From Tafel plots, values of 65 and 110 mV dec(-1) at low and high potential, respectively, were obtained; all electrocatalysts showed lower overpotentials around 265 mV, and sample Ni3Co3Fe3 with equimolar composition ratio exhibited the best performance (lowest overpotential 250 mV). Cobalt in low-spin configuration has effect on the electronic properties of brucite layer sheet, modulating the necessary potential for nickel oxidation which acts as active site for water splitting.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000418294200049

Here we demonstrate a cobalt vanadium oxide (CoVOx-300) working as such an efficient and durable electrocatalyst. Such an active catalyst is beneficial from the balanced Co3+-O-V4+ active species, which show the high surface Co3+ contents with matched V4+ generated by rapid heat treatment. The CoVOx-300 with highest Co3+/Co2+ ratio of 1.4 and corresponding highest V4+/V5+ ratio of 1.7 exhibits remarkable OER activity with an overpotential of 330 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(10)), a shallow Tafel slope of only 46 mV dec(-1) and a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 0.38 V vs RHE, which is 20 times higher than the active CoOx-300 and 1000 times higher than VOx-300. The catalyst also shows excellent stability for 10 h in alkaline media and a 40 % reduced activation energy to the counterpart, CoOx-300. The overpotential (eta(10)) of CoVOx-300 also shows nearly 70 and 80 mV lower than the corresponding CoOx-300 and CoVOx catalysts, respectively and 20 % lower Tafel slope than the commercial benchmark catalyst RuO2. Thus, this study for the first time demonstrates that surface Co3+-O-V4+ species play a crucial role in improving electrocatalytic properties and stability for water oxidation reaction and the approaches allow the rational design and synthesis of other active transition metal oxides toward efficient OER activity.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000591696100008

Recovering valuable materials from e-wastes and utilizing them for development of eco-design devices guides one to a more productive way of managing wastes. Recycled copper is capable of retaining its intrinsic properties and can be reused with same expectation of performances; capitalizing on this fact, herein, it is attempted to utilize copper from e-waste as an economically viable catalytic substrate for overall water splitting. Upon deposition of amorphous nickel cobalt phosphide films, the scrap copper wires are highly efficient for catalyzing hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction at low overpotential ((10)eta-(HER) = 178 mV, (10)eta-(OER) = 220 mV), and considerably promote water catalysis at 1.59 V@ 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the electrodes demonstrate long-term stability in alkaline electrolyte that can potentially be employed for large-scale electrolyzer application. The proposed electrode architecture, by the explicit growth of bimetallic phosphide on highly conductive Cu substrate, facilitates fast electron transport and promises a minimum contact resistance between electrocatalyst and current collector. This work paves the way for development of environmentally sound electrode materials from e-waste that can be exercised for a myriad of other clean energy reactions.									60	2	0	0	5	0	59			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000452401000009

But the limited spatiotemporal resolution in experiments, in particular, makes it challenging to explore the microstructural evolution of AlNP oxidation and associated mechanisms. Here, we perform large-scale reactive molecular dynamics simulations to study the structural evolution of AlNPs with a 2-4 nm thick oxide shell in an oxygen environment. We find the temporal hollowing processes of AlNPs for both symmetrical and asymmetrical oxidations, in which the morphological evolution can be understood by a discrepant electric field and temperature distributions for different systems. In the early time, core aluminum atoms experience a fast reaction with an oxide shell. Environmental oxygen does not react with AlNPs until the surface O/Al ratio decreases to similar to 1.2. Moreover, based on our simulation results, previous experimental data agree well with the proposed model, which can well describe the relationship between combustion efficiency and oxide shell thickness, confirming that the oxide shell promotes rather than hinders the combustion of AlNPs. The molecular insights obtained here would be significant for understanding the underlying mechanism and further modeling of AlNP combustion.

In this study, we have reported the preparation of SrFe2O4 nanoflowers (NFs) which have proved to be quite fruitful for the purpose of water oxidation reaction. SrFe2O4 NFs have been characterized via SEM, TEM, PXRD, FTIR, TGA and XPS. Crystallographic information of the material is obtained through Rietveld refinement and is provided in this work. The electrochemical studies were executed in two different basic mediums and in both cases unprecedented results have been gained as is reflected in the fact that SrFe2O4 NFs in 1 M aqueous KOH solution displayed a very low overpotential of 312 mV whereas in 0.1 M aqueous KOH solution the overpotential was 370 mV at 10 mAcm-2 current density. The capability of spinel SrFe2O4 NFs to effectively oxidize water is reflected in its appreciable turnover number (4.8x105, in 1 M KOH) and extraordinary turn frequencies (11.11 s-1, in 1 M KOH). Additionally, the synthetic technique of SrFe2O4 NFs is very simple, green and economical. Finally, this work brings forth an expedient and green method to devise highly efficient catalyst for water splitting reaction.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000829297200004

However, the slow reaction rate of hydrogen reaction in alkaline media, and unfavorable kinetics for oxygen evolution reaction have hindered the progress of water splitting technologies for clean hydrogen production. Considering the high price and scarce storage of noble metals which are known as the most effective catalysts for water splitting, it is urgently required to develop non-noble metals based alternatives with highly intrinsic acivity, low price and high tolerance to increase electrocatalytic efficiency and reduce the reaction overpotential from an economic perspective. In this review, we summarize recent research efforts in exploiting advanced transition metal based electrocatalysts with outstanding performance for water splitting catalysis, mainly including transition-metal-based chalcogenides, phosphides, nitrides and carbides as well as single atom catalysts. First, we give a simple description of water splitting mechanism in alkaline media. Then we discuss the promising structural design of transition metal based electrocatalysts for enhancing water splitting, and disclose the underlying relationship between structure and electrocatalytic performance for water splitting with assistance of theoretical simulation. Finally, we provide our personal perspective to highlight the challenges and propose the opportunities for developing transition metal based electrocatalysts for water splitting in alkaline solution.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			2589-7780			WOS:000646911300004

In this study, ternary Fe substituted CoCu-glycerate microspheres (CoCuFe(X)-Gly) with cobalt (Co):copper (Cu):iron (Fe) atomic ratio of 2:1-X:X (X = 0.15, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8) have been prepared through facile template-free solvothermal method to examine their performance as alkaline OER catalyst. The results suggested that Fe incorporation could enhance the OER activity, and all Fe-modified samples showed lower overpotential with faster kinetic, as revealed by their Tafel slope and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. Among the fabricated samples, CoCuFe(0.5)-Gly possessed the smallest overpotential of 317 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) with 3.58-fold higher current density than that of Fe-free CoCu-Gly at the overpotential of 350 mV. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) disclosed that Fe incorporation imposed strong electronic interactions that facilitate the transformation of metal-glycerate surface into active oxyhydroxide species under anodic condition prevalent before oxygen evolution reaction. Using various characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method of surface area analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), the physiochemical traits of samples have been carefully elucidated to determine the changes applied upon Fe substitution. Also, through Fe introduction, owing to the outward diffusion of ions to replace 2-propanol with glycerol, the solid microspheres partly become hollow which results in higher BET surface area and increase in accessible active sites. However, the evaluation of current density normalized by electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) indicates that the promotional effect of Fe was not solely related to the higher surface area but also because the intrinsic activity of Fe-modified samples has also been enhanced. The durability of optimal CoCuFe(0.5)-Gly catalyst has been examined using chronopotentiometry, chronoamperometry and potential cycling methods the findings of which suggest the good short-term and long-term stability of catalyst.

J	Wang, Dingsheng								2D materials modulating layered double hydroxides for electrocatalytic water splitting								CHINESE JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				43	6			1380	1398		10.1016/S1872-2067(21)63987				JUN 2022	2022	Exploring highly efficient electrochemical water splitting catalysts has recently attracted extensive research interest from both fundamental researches and practical applications. Transition metal-based layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been proved to be one of the most efficient materials for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), however, still suffered from low conductivity and sluggish kinetics for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which largely inhibited the overall water splitting efficiency. To address this dilemma, enormous approaches including doping regulation, intercalation tuning and defect engineering are therefore rationally designed and developed. Herein, we focus on the recent exciting progress of LDHs hybridization with other two-dimensional (2D) materials for water splitting reactions, not barely for enhancing OER efficiency but also for boosting HER activity. Particularly, the structural features, morphologies, charge transfer and synergistic effects for the heterostructure/heterointerface that influence the electrocatalytic performance are discussed in details. The hybrid 2D building blocks not only serve as additional conductivity and structural supported but also promote electron transfer at the interfaces and further enhance the electrocatalytic performance. The construction and application of the nanohybrid materials will guide a new direction in developing multifunctional materials based on LDHs, which will contribute to energy conversion and storage.

Hereby, we report a bifunctional catalytic material with core-shell structure constructed by Co3O4 nanowire arrays as cores and ultrathin NiFe-layered double hydroxides (NiFe LDHs) as shells (Co3O4@NiFe LDHs). The introduction of Co3O4 nanowires could provide abundant active sites for NiFe LDH nanosheets. Most importantly, the deposition of NiFe LDHs on the surface of Co3O4 can modulate the surface chemical valences of Co, Ni, and Fe species via changing the electron donor and/or electron absorption effects, finally achieving the balance and optimization of ORR and OER properties. By this core-shell design, the maximum ORR current densities of Co3O4@NiFe LDHs increase to 3-7 mA cm(-2), almost an order of magnitude increases compared to pure NiFe LDH (0.45 mA cm(-2)). Significantly, an OER overpotential as low as 226 mV (35 mA cm(-2)) is achieved in the designed core-shell catalyst, which is comparable to and/or even better than those of commercial Ir/C. Hence, the primary zinc-air battery employing Co3O4@NiFe LDH as an air electrode achieves a high specific capacity (667.5 mA h g(-1)) and first-class energy density (797.6 W h kg(-1)); the rechargeable battery can show superior reversibility, excellent stability, and voltage gaps of similar to 0.8 V (similar to 60% of round-trip efficiency) in >1200 continuous cycles. Furthermore, the flexible quasi-solid-state zinc-air battery with bendable ability holds practical potential in portable and wearable electronic devices.									80	4	0	0	2	0	79			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000472683300025	31124648

Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical porous Co/CoOx nanoparticles embedded N-doped carbon hybrid threaded with carbon nanotubes (Co/CoOx@NC-CNTs) was prepared via in situ threading CNTs through ZIF-67 polyhedron and a succedent carbonation process. Compared to those of commercial electrocatalysts (Pt/C and RuO2), the as-prepared hybrid showed comparable electrocatalytic activity with positive ORR half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.836 V, low OER potential (E-j=10-E-1/2 = 1.62 V), good methanol tolerance and excellent electrocatalytic stability. Moreover, the small overpotential difference value (Delta E = E-j=10-E-1/2) of 0.784 V is competitive to those of recent reported outstanding bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts. The high electrocatalytic properties of the Co/CoOx@NC-CNTs hybrid are attributed to the synergistic effect of high surface area, desirable pore structure and reasonable chemical composition.

This study focuses upon the mechanism by which the O-O bond is formed. Stopped-flow kinetics at variable acidities in H2O and D2O are used to complement the analysis of competitive oxygen-18 kinetic isotope effects (O-18 KIEs) upon consumption of natural abundance water. The derived O-18 KIEs provide insights concerning the identity of the transition state. Water attack (WA) and oxo-coupling (OC) transition states were evaluated for various reactions of monomeric and dimeric ferrates using a calibrated density functional theory protocol. Vibrational frequencies from optimized isotopic structures are used here to predict O-18 KIEs for comparison to experimental values determined using an established competitive isotope-fractionation method. The high level of agreement between experimental and theoretic isotope effects points to an intramolecular OC mechanism within a di-iron(VI) intermediate, consistent with the analysis of the reaction kinetics. Alternative mechanisms are excluded based on insurmountably high free energy barriers and disagreement with calculated O-18 KIEs.									69	4	0	0	16	0	72			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000308830600045	22900971

In this article, we report on the systematic characterization of mixed proton and electron conducting compounds of composition BaFe1-xCoxO3-y-delta(OH)(y) synthesized via nebulized spray pyrolysis. Independent of the value of x, all samples BaFe1-xCoxO3-y-delta(OH)(y) were found to crystallize in an orthorhombic ordering/distortion variant of the perovskite type structure (space group Cmcm) and are isotypic to the border phases (x = 0 or 1) reported previously. A minimum water content was observed for the composition with x = 0.5, which increases steadily for Co or Fe richer compositions. Impedance studies show that the conductivity increases with increasing Co-content, with BaCo0.5Fe0.5O2.07(OH)(0.74) showing a total electrical conductivity of 10(-7) S cm(-1) at 298 K, an order of magnitude higher than found for BaFeO2.33(OH)(0.33).

Herein, it is demonstrated that 2D MXene (Ti3C2) with high electron conductivity can act as an effective electron transfer and transport medium after being hybridized with Ag3PO4, a well-documented photocatalyst for oxygen evolution. The obtained Ag3PO4/MXene photocatalysts exhibit a significantly high photocatalytic water oxidation activity under visible light illumination. The optimized hybrid shows a remarkable oxygen-evolving concentration (35.8 mu mol L-1), which is 2.6 times higher than that of pure Ag3PO4 nanoparticles. Unprecedentedly, the Ag3PO4/MXene hybrid exhibits a further improved oxygen evolution rate without using the electron sacrificial agent, implying that Mxene nanosheets may act as an electron "pool" that in situ consumes the photogenerated electrons. Other characterizations reveal that the hydrophilic functional groups on the surface of MXene favor the interaction of the photocatalyst with water and in the meantime inhibit the self-corrosion of Ag3PO4 under illumination.									41	5	0	0	5	0	41			2367-198X			WOS:000495141500001

The number of exposed active sites can be enriched by exfoliating the bulk structure into fewer layers. Herein, we successfully achieved multielement doping and exfoliation for Co3Fe LDHs by one SF6-plasma etching step at room temperature (named as Co3Fe LDHs-SF6). The obtained Co3Fe LDHs-SF6 ultrathin nanosheets display outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, which only needs 268 mV overpotential to reach 10 mA cm(-2). Tafel slope and charge transfer resistance are dramatically decreased indicating a faster reaction kinetic rate. The excellent OER activity can be attributed to an increased number of active sites and an optimized electronic structure modulated by the incorporation of electron-withdrawing F, electron-donating S, and abundant vacancies resulting in proper adsorption energy to oxygen species.									14	1	0	0	0	0	15			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000500415700020	31692327

Herein, we report a three-dimensional coral-like Zn,O-codoped Ni3S2 nanostructure grown on nickel foam (denoted as ZO-Ni3S2/NF) by a facile solvothermal method. We show that the introduction of Zn2+ can not only trigger the generation of a three-dimensional coral-like nanoarchitecture of Ni3S2/NF with a larger catalytically active area, but also increases the number of active Ni3+ sites in ZO-Ni3S2/NF, which enhances the adsorption capacity of intermediates in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process. Moreover, the O-doping endows Ni3S2 with improved intrinsic electronic conductivity and thus facilitates fast charge transfer during the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). As expected, ZO-Ni3S2/NF exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance, requiring only 235 mV and 450 mV to deliver 500 mA cm(-2) for the HER and OER, respectively. The findings in our work provide new insights for the development of highly active and stable noble-metal-free electrocatalysts at high current density for industrial hydrogen fuel production.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000731780300001

However, the rational utilization of coordination polymers (CPs) or their derivatives as electrocatalysts has been hindered by a lack of insight into their underlying catalytic mechanisms. Herein, a convenient approach is presented where a series of Ni10-xFex-CPs (0 <= x <= 5) is first synthesized, followed by the introduction of abundant structural deficiencies using a facile reductive method (R-Ni10-xFex-CPs). The representative low-crystalline R-Ni8Fe2-CPs (R-NiFe-CPs) with a thickness of sub-2 nm display promising oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with a very low overpotential of 225 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)and high long-term durability over 120 h. Comprehensive investigations including X-ray absorption spectroscopy, density functional theory, and mass diffusion theory reveal strong synergistic effects of structural deficiencies on the OER activity. A super-Nernstian pH-dependence of 85.15 mV pH(-1)suggests that the catalytic OER mechanism of R-NiFe-CPs involved a decoupled proton-electron transfer (PT/ET) pathway, leading to notably higher OER activity compared to the concerted coupled proton-electron transfer pathway. New insights into the catalytic reaction mechanisms of CP-related materials open up new approaches to expedite the design of efficient electrocatalysts.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000564418200001

Although CNX catalysts are not as active as Pt/C in ORR and Ir/C in OER, they exhibit significantly lower combined overpotential for ORR and OER relative to those shown by the two commercial catalysts, which are highly active only for one of the two reactions, but not both. The effect of various nitrogen functionalities on the ORR and OER activity of CNX catalysts was also studied. CNX samples with higher pyridinic-N site density exhibited higher ORR and OER activity.

Herein, we designed a simple strategy to fabricate a quaternary Zn-Co-N-S co-doped tubular carbon (0.3-Zn-Co-N/S-C) via direct pyrolysis of various mixtures of precursors. The high porosity of 3D nanostructure not only provides better mass transfer but also offers a large number of active sites thereof superior ORR and OER performances. As a result, the rechargeable ZAB fabricated using optimized 0.3-Zn-Co-N/S-C as cathode exhibited a higher open-circuit voltage, stable discharge rate, and better reversibility, even exceeding the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst in alkaline solution. The catalytic mechanism indicates that the synergistic effect of Co metal nanoparticles, Co-N/Zn-N active sites, and the high-yield of N/S-doped tubular carbon dominate the outstanding catalytic performance.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000704467300027

Herein, a nickel foam-based monolithic electrode is reported with high performance for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions in neutral media. The karst landform-featured electrode consists of metallic Ni in the valley areas and Ni/alpha-Ni(OH)(2) heterostructures as towers on the surface. Remarkably, the electrode can switch between HER and OER reversibly and flexibly with long-term viability. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) analysis and computational studies proved the vital roles of the karst landform structure and the interface of the heterostructure in its efficient bifunctionality. Combined with a common photovoltaic cell, a water electrolysis cell with the bifunctional electrode can implement splitting of natural seawater (pH similar to 8.0) with a high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 16.5%. This cheap, flexible, robust, easily obtained and bifunctional electrode has potential applications for water splitting in the hydrogen economy.									68	8	0	0	2	0	69			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000508857600010

OZONE-SCIENCE & ENGINEERING				22	5			447	460		10.1080/01919510009408789				OCT 2000	2000	Many parameters can influence the kinetics of cellulose models ozonation. In this work the effect of pH and oxygen as gas carrier on the evolution of the reaction was studied. The involvement of free radical species seemed to be unimportant in high ozone concentration available in water, even at high pH with regard to the reaction rate and by-product formation. Conversely, in basic pH conditions better reaction selectivity with formation in a higher yield of gluconic acid and cellobionic acid was found during the glucose and the cellobiose ozonation. The participation of the solvent and the partial ionization of the hydroxyl group at the C1 position explain this enhanced selectivity. Furthermore, the formation of compounds with a low molecular weight has been proved to be due to a hydrotrioxide fragmentation mechanism involving oxygen.									15	1	0	0	5	0	16			0191-9512			WOS:000165088700002

Meanwhile, the OER activity and durability of the as-synthesized Pt-NiMnO3 under different pH conditions are found to be Pt-content-dependent. Particularly, Pt1-NiMnO3 showed superior OER efficiency relative to its counterparts Pt0.5-NiMnO3, Pt0.1- NiMnO3, NiMnO3, and commercial Pt/C at different pH values, ascribed to the size, morphology, and composition effects as confirmed via XRD, XPS and electrochemical characterization.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2398-4902			WOS:000422784900019

Its corresponding electrocatalytic performance towards oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR and OER) was systematically investigated in alkaline electrolyte. Structural, morphological and compositional studies revealed changes in electronic and surface properties when CeO2 was introduced as an oxygen buffer material. The oxygen vacancies effectively enhanced the electrocatalytic activity, while the synergistic effect of co-catalyst CeO2, CoOx active-centers, and defective graphene with many voids facilitate the charge/mass transfer, making CoOx/CeO2/RGO an efficient and stable bifunctional electrocatalyst for OER/ORR with Delta E = 0.76 V (Delta E = E-10 mA cm(-2), OER - E-1/2,E- ORR). This parameter is 70 mV and 270 mV lower than CoOx/RGO and the benchmark Pt/C, respectively. In addition, the OER/ORR bifunctionality of CoOx/CeO2/RGO composite outperforms that of Pt/C catalyst in a H-2-O-2 micro fuel cell platform.

In this study, nonprecious metal carbides composed of Fe3C and Mo2C supported by carbon nanoplates are prepared and utilized as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. Spatially confined annealing of the polydopamine-coated metal precursors affords a structure containing porous cubes isolated by carbon nanoplates encapsulated with Fe3C and Mo2C nanoparticles. The hybrid electrocatalyst with a hierarchical structure, large surface area, and abundant exposed active sites benefits from efficient mass transport and more importantly the strong charge-transfer effect between the iron and molybdenum moieties. Under strong alkaline conditions, the optimized Fe3C-Mo2C hybrid (with a Fe/Mo ratio of 1 : 2) requires a low overpotential of 274 and 301 mV for the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction at current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, accompanied with decent hydrogen evolution activity, thereby demonstrating efficient bifunctional electrocatalytic activity towards overall water splitting.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000568026500001	32662544

JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				169	5					054516	10.1149/1945-7111/ac67f7				MAY 1 2022	2022	In many electrochemical systems, such as carbon dioxide reduction, batteries and supercapacitors, hydrogen evolution reaction is an undesired competing reaction. Herein, we investigate the factors controlling the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on seven different commercial carbon materials commonly found in many of these systems. The electrochemical HER response was determined by rotating disk electrode potential hold measurements in acidic media, and correlated with the physical characteristics of the carbon materials determined nitrogen adsorption/desorption, as well as previous experiments on the same materials. An on-chip electrochemical mass spectrometer was used to probe the gaseous products produced at the electrode in situ, which allowed HER to be distinguished from other competing reaction and the onset of the reaction was established to be -0.38 V vs RHE. The results indicate that carbons with low amount of metal impurities have the lowest H-2 evolution rates.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000794029300001

Herein, an iron-rich La0.6Sr0.4CO0.2Fe0.8O2.9 (LSCF28) perovskite with an open porous topographic structure was developed as an electrocatalyst by a straightforward molten-salt synthesis approach. It was found that porosity correlates with both the iron content and the molten-salt approach. Benefiting from the large surface area, high activity of the porous internal surface, and the optimal electronic configuration of redox sites, this inexpensive material exhibits high performance with a large mass activity of 40.8 A.g(-1) at a low overpotential of 0.345 V in 0.1 M KOH, surpassing the state-of-the-art precious metal IrO2 catalyst and other well-known perovskites, such as Ba0.5Sr0.5CO0.8Fe0.2O3 and SrCoO2.7. Our work illustrates that the molten-salt method is an effective route to generate porous structures in perovskite oxides, which is important for energy conversion and storage devices.									28	1	0	0	2	0	28			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000441237100029

Adding mesopores in the plane of ultrathin 2D metals is the next big step in manipulating these structures because increasing their surface area improves the utilization of the material and the availability of active sites. Here, we report a novel synthetic strategy to prepare an unprecedented type of 2D mesoporous metallic iridium (Ir) nanosheet. Mesoporous Ir nanosheets can be synthesized with close-packed assemblies of diblock copolymer (poly-(ethylene oxide)-b-polystyrene, PEO-b-PS) micelles aligned in the 2D plane of the nanosheets. This novel synthetic route opens a new dimension of control in the synthesis of 2D metals, enabling new kinds of mesoporous architectures with abundant catalytically active sites. Because of their unique structural features, the mesoporous metallic Ir nanosheets exhibit a high electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic solution as compared to commercially available catalysts.									241	7	0	0	11	0	241			0002-7863			WOS:000446920100024	30129750

Toward this goal, we synthesized an amorphous FeOOH (a-FeOOH) phase that has not previously been studied as an OER catalyst. The a-FeOOH films show activity comparable to that of another OER cocatalyst, Co-borate (Co-B-i), in 1 M Na2CO3, reaching 10 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of similar to 550 mV for 10 nm thick films. Additionally, the a-FeOOH thin films absorb less than 3% of the solar photons (AM1.5G) with energy greater than 1.9 eV, are homogeneous over large areas, and act as a protective layer separating the solution from the solar absorber. The utility of a-FeOOH in a realistic system is tested by depositing on amorphous Si triple junction solar cells with a photovoltaic efficiency of 6.8%. The resulting a-FeOOH/a-Si devices achieve a total water splitting efficiency of 4.3% at 0 V vs RHE in a three-electrode configuration and show no decrease in efficiency over the course of 4 h.									427	24	0	0	27	1	433			0002-7863			WOS:000331779800024	24475949

This material could fundamentally influence the catalytic processes and performance of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The OER and HER activities of Co3O4-/MoO3-based nanorods are enhanced by blending with conducting support, for example, graphitic carbon nitrides (g-C3N4). The X-ray diffraction pattern and the attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared data revealed that the as-synthesized nanorods are highly crystalline in nature and are attached to the g-C3N4 support. Transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy studies also affirm the successful heterointerface formation between Co3O4/MoO3 nanorods and g-C3N4. This Co3O4/MoO3/g-C3N4 rod- shaped catalyst is highly stable in comparison to its individual constituent and generates a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 206 mV for OER and 125 mV for HER in alkaline and acidic media, respectively. This work could pave the way for developing Co3O4/MoO3/g-C3N4 composite materials as electrocatalysts for overall water splitting reactions.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				2574-0970		WOS:000752894100129

A study on the metallorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) of Ru and RuO2 using ruthenocene precursor and oxygen gas								Advanced Metallization Conference 1999 (AMC 1999). Proceedings of the Conference								495	500						2000	2000	Thin films of Ru and RuO2 were deposited using ruthenocene and oxygen as a precursor and reaction gas, respectively. Two phases, Ru and RuO2, could be deposited using the same source and reaction gas. The phase of the as-deposited film was found to be critically dependent on the deposition process parameters such as precursor partial pressure, oxygen partial pressure, and substrate temperature. An increase in oxygen partial pressure led to RuO2 formation. It was also identified that there exists a substrate temperature range in which a Ru film is deposited at a given processing condition. When the temperature is either higher or lower than this temperature range, RuO2 film deposition results. From careful analysis of the film deposition rate in conjunction with the evolution of the film phase, we conclude that film deposition occurs by two independent processes. One is the source gas decomposition process resulting in Ru film deposition and the other is the oxidation of the Ru film resulting in RuO2 formation.

This knowledge gap obscures the connections between the input precursors and the output products, clouding the pathway toward Fe-N-C catalyst improvement. Herein, we unravel the evolution pathway of precursors to ORR-active catalyst comprised exclusively of single-atom Fe-1(II)-N-4 sites via in-temperature X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The Fe precursor transforms to Fe oxides below 300 degrees C and then to tetrahedral Fe-1(II)-O-4 via a crystal-to-melt-like transformation below 600 degrees C. The Fe-1(II)-O-4 releases a single Fe atom that diffuses into the N-doped carbon defect forming Fe-1(II)-N-4 above 600 degrees C. This vapor-phase single Fe atom transport mechanism is verified by synthesizing Fe-1(II)-N-4 sites via "noncontact pyrolysis" wherein the Fe precursor is not in physical contact with the N and C precursors during pyrolysis.									105	6	0	0	9	0	105			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000509425600038	31880925

N-doped (TiO2)n clusters), to accurately design photocatalyst with enhanced reactivity at a given environmental conditions (i.e. temperature (T), pressure () and doping (mue)). Since free energy potential energy surface consists of many competing isomers even in a small energy window, computational design of specific metastable photocatalysts with enhanced activity is extremely challenging. This requires fixing various parameters as follows; (i) favorable formation energy, (ii) low fundamental gap, (iii) low excitation energy, (iv) high vertical electron affinity (VEA) and (v) low vertical ionization potential (VIP) to drive the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for water splitting. Here, we show that by integrating several first principles based methodologies that consideration of the global minimum structure alone can severely underestimate the activity. First, we have used a suite of genetic algorithms (namely, searching clusters with conventional minimum total energy ((GA)); searching clusters with specific property i.e. high VEA ((GA)), and low VIP ((GA))) to model the N-doped (TiO2)n( n = 4-10, 15, 20) (meta)stable clusters. Next, we have identified its free energy using abinitio atomistic thermodynamics to confirm that the metastable structures are not too far from the free energy global minima. We find that N-substitution ((N)) prefers to reside at highly coordinated oxygen site, whereas N-interstitial ((NO)) and split-interstitial ((N) favor the dangling oxygen site. (NO) and (N doped states are thermodynamically stable at finite temperature (T) and pressure (). Interestingly, each types of defect (viz. substitution, interstitials) reduce the fundamental gap and excitation energy substantially. However, (N doped clusters are found to be less probable in the Pourbaix phase diagram, whereas (N) and (NO) doped metastable clusters show significant occupance probability near the phase boundaries. The latter ensures much higher electrocatalytic activity for water splitting than the most stable configurations.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2515-7639			INSPEC:20116322

This approach enables the largest screening of OER activity and operational stability to date, as illustrated through investigation of the (Cu-Mn-Ta-Co-Sn-Fe)O-x composition space as 15 unique quaternary composition spaces. In total 2121 compositions are tested between pH 3 and 13, creating an extensive dataset whose interpretation requires development and application of data science to provide insights that are both beyond the standard composition-activity relationships and beyond human interpretation due to the dimensionality of the dataset. Three distinct classes of OER catalysts are identified with respect to pH-dependent activity and stability. The large-scale screening reveals a new class of Co-rich OER catalysts that can be compositionally tailored to a specified pH and perform on par with state-of-the-art acid OER catalysts.									13	3	0	0	0	0	15			2051-6347	2051-6355		WOS:000474644700013

In this work, the Mott-Schottky electrocatalyst Cu NDs/Fe2O3-NPCs was developed by creating Cu nanodots (NDs)/Fe2O3 heterojunction nanoislands rooted on N-rich porous carbon nanosheets (NPCs). The formed Mott-Schottky heterojunction Cu NDs/Fe2O3 nanoislands promoted the electron transfer from the metallic Cu to the semiconductive Fe2O3 phase, as a result, the adsorptions towards O-2 and OH species were improved, and sequentially the catalytic activities for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were both remarkably enhanced. In addition, the porous nature of the developed catalyst also contributed to the effectiveness of the required mass transfer. The optimal Mott-Schottky Cu NDs/Fe2O3-NPCs catalyst exhibited an onset potential of 0.98 V and a Tafel slop of 53.7 mV dec(-1) for ORR, and an overpotential of 328 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER. Further, the ZAB assembled with Cu NDs/Fe2O3-NPCs catalyst displayed a high power density of 138 mW cm(-2) and an excellent long-term cyclability.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000800588200001

Consequently, C-MFECs have attracted a great deal of interest for various applications, including metal-air batteries, water splitting devices, regenerative fuel cells, solar cells, fuel and chemical production, water purification, to mention a few. By altering the electronic configuration and/or modulating their spin angular momentum, both heteroatom(s) doping and structural defects (e.g., atomic vacancy, edge) have been demonstrated to create catalytic active sites in the skeleton of graphitic carbon materials. Although certain C-MFECs have been made to be comparable to or even better than their counterparts based on noble metals, transition metals and/or their hybrids, further research and development are necessary in order to translate C-MFECs for practical applications. In this article, we present a timely and comprehensive, but critical, review on recent advancements in the field of C-MFECs within the past five years or so by discussing various types of electrocatalytic reactions catalyzed by C-MFECs. An emphasis is given to potential applications of C-MFECs for energy conversion and storage. The structure-property relationship for and mechanistic understanding of C-MFECs will also be discussed, along with the current challenges and future perspectives.									43	1	0	0	2	0	42			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000698793700001	34559871

The unique structure is assembled via a self-templated strategy by utilizing the FeNi oxalate (FeNi-C2O4/NF) nanopyramid as the templates, followed by an anion-exchange reaction at room temperature. Due to the intrinsic activity of Fe-doped beta-Ni(OH)(2) along with unique porous array structures consisting of two-dimensional (2D) active materials on three-dimensional (3D) conductive substrates, the developed electrode exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic activity for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an alkaline medium. The introduced amount of Fe plays a significant role in promoting OER and HER activity compared to the beta-Ni(OH)(2) electrode. The optimal electrode (U-Fe-beta-Ni(OH)(2)/NF-2) generated a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpotentials of 218 mV for the OER and 121 mV for the HER. The electrode also demonstrated considerably stable performance during the continuous water splitting process. Furthermore, we elucidated the promotion mechanisms of the active Fe-doped beta-Ni(OH)(2) compound for the OER and HER based on extensive characterization and electrochemical measurements. Hence, this work provides a facile approach to developing low-cost, efficient, and stable hydroxide-based electrodes for bifunctional OER and HER in water splitting.									26	0	0	0	2	0	26			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000562182900043	32687306

Polymorphic ternary metal chalcogenide solid solution nanopowder as electrocatalyst for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction								MATERIALS SCIENCE IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING				152						107102	10.1016/j.mssp.2022.107102				DEC 2022	2022	Here, in this work, a novel synthesis route of polymorphic FexNi1-xSe2 nanopowders consisting of nanoparticles and nanorods for x = 0.2-0.8 has been investigated by a simple hydrothermal process. Coral shaped NiSe2 (x = 0) and nanorod structured FeSe2 (x = 1) are in pure cubic and orthorhombic phase, respectively whereas FexNi1-xSe2 solid solution nanopowder is a combination of both. After important basic characterizations, electro-chemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) are carried out using FexNi1-xSe2 as cathode and anode, respectively. Among all the variations, x = 0.4 has exhibited the highest HER activity with low overpotential of-106 mV for 10 mA/cm2 in acidic medium and x = 0.2 is the most efficient as anode in OER in alkaline medium with overpotential of 280 mV to drive the current density of 10 mA/cm2 with a small amount of oxidation. Long term stability is achieved without any degradation for both HER and OER in extreme pH for FexNi1-xSe2. The insertion of Fe in the lattice of NiSe2 has improved the conductivity thereby increasing the charge transfer phenomenon. The coexistence of two different morphologies for the optimum ratio of Fe/Ni has generated more active sites participating in the electrochemical reactions. The easy oxidation of catalysts during OER can be restricted by the polymorphic crystal structure of FexNi1-xSe2.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1369-8001	1873-4081		WOS:000862353800001

Herein, a series of dual-functional NiFe-MOF@FeOOH-based composites with different electrodeposition intervals were synthesized via a solvothermal method and subsequent electrodeposition process. It was noted that when the electrodeposition time was set as 300 s, the corresponding composites exhibited the most effective OER catalytic activity with a low overpotential of 303 mV at 40 mA cm(-2). The optimal composites also displayed fast reaction kinetics with a small tafel plot of 36 mV dec(-1) and superior durability for 20 h. Meanwhile, the composite only required 137 mV for HER to reach a catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) under the same condition. Clearly, the obtained composites depicted excellent dual-functional electrocatalytic performance which can be ascribed to its unique 3D hierarchical structure, larger electrochemical surface area, strong synergistic effect as well as improved electrical conductivity. Besides, the adopted FeOOH was favorable for the transformation from Ni2+ to Ni3+,which acted as the active centers of catalytic reaction to advance the OER process. All in all, this study provided a novel insight to design bimetallic MOF based electrode materials with both excellent HER and OER properties.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000863150800003

The electrocatalytic activity and corrosion resistance of the porous MnxSiy electrodes were evaluated. The results demonstrated that the electrodes with lower silicon content presented lower potential during a 24-h polarization period and that the corrosion resistance of MnxSiy electrodes was enhanced as the Si content increased. Among these prepared oxygen electrodes, the porous Mn5Si3 electrode exhibited the highest catalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1.63 mol l(-1) sulfuric acid solutions. The influence of the electrode active surface on electrocatalytic activity was also studied, and the results showed that large active surface greatly promoted the electrocatalytic performance of the electrodes. The porous MnxSiy electrodes were also tested in conditions which simulate industrial zinc electrowinning and compared to conventional Pb and Pb-Ag (0.8 wt%) anodes. The current efficiency of porous Mn5Si3 electrode reached 85.7%, which was comparable to that of Pb and Pb-Ag (0.8 wt%) anodes. Moreover, the zinc cathode exhibited much lower impurity content.

The XRD results show that the deposit is a mixture of an alpha + beta phase (a dominant beta-PbO2 phase with a minor alpha-PbO2 phase present), and the SEM images show that Co3O4 and CNT have been simultaneously deposited with PbO2. The 3D-Ti/PbO2-(4 g.L-1) Co3O4-(0.4 g.L-1) CNT electrode exhibits a voltammetric charge 5 times larger than that of the 3D-Ti/PbO2 electrode, which indicates outstanding electrocatalytic activity.

Nevertheless, the dynamic valence state and local structure of reactive centers (i. e., Ru) in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes have not been systematically investigated yet, especially through in situ approaches. Herein, we employed in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy to study the dynamic valence state and local structure of RuO2 during the OER in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. In the acidic electrolyte, the Ru center was reduced near the onset potential prior to launching the OER and was oxidized during the OER process, while the coordination numbers and the bond lengths of the Ru-O path also decreased as revealed by in situ EXAFS analysis. Besides, in the alkaline electrolyte, RuO2 showed a similar behavior as revealed under acidic conditions. These results provide an evident insight into the dynamic change of the RuO2 electrocatalyst during the OER.									20	1	0	0	0	0	20			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000472454100052	30839999

Cobalt oxides, especially Co3O4, have attracted much attention due to their high catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It is difficult to improve the catalytic activity of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for rechargeable zinc-air batteries. In this paper, Co3O4 containing rich oxygen vacancies is prepared by in-situ growth on the nickel foam, and the carbon coating treatment on the surface increases the conductivity and stability of Co3O4, which prolongs its cycle life. The results show that moderate oxygen vacancies can achieve the best catalytic performance. The peak power density of zinc-air battery assembled by this air electrode can reach 54.5 mW cm(-2), which is 51.4% higher than that of the untreated Co(3)O(4)catalyst. The cycle life of the battery can reach 716 cycles (358 h), prolonging about 250 h compared with Co3O4 without carbon coating treatment. It is proved that the improved Co3O4 can increase the power output and cycle life of the rechargeable zinc-air battery, which helps to expand the application range of cheap Co3O4 catalyst, and provides an effective and economic solution to obtain excellent electrocatalysts for metal-air batteries.

Here, we report a universal and green method to prepare high-entropy layered (oxy) hydroxide (HE-LH) nanosheets under ambient conditions. This method is based on a self-reliant electrochemical process, utilizing only low-cost metal foils and electrolytes as reactant, with no need of involving extra alkali salts and/or organic reagents. Importantly, the composition of HE-LH nanosheets is widely tunable by simply adjusting the combination of metal foils. As a representative example, quinary layered (oxy)hydroxide (CoFeNiCrV-LH) nanosheets are rationally designed, which exhibit superior electrocatalytic activity and long-term durability towards the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction, outperforming both CoFe layered double hydroxides and most previously reported transition-metal-based electrocatalysts. Comprehensive characterization and analysis reveal that the high-entropy effects play a significant role in forming the defect-rich, low-crystalline microstructures, along with large specific surface areas and optimized electronic configurations, thus enabling the boosted electrocatalytic performance. This electrochemical synthetic approach is generally applicable to the scalable synthesis of diverse HE-LH materials towards versatile promising applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0021-9797	1095-7103		WOS:000806636300004	35290807

In this work, hybrid materials composed of bimetallic (Co and Fe) sulfide (Co8FeS8) nanoparticles supported on N,S-doped carbon microparticles that can serve as dual-function oxygen electrocatalysts are synthesized. The synthesis of the materials is performed by preparing and then pyrolyzing silica-protected Fe- and Co-modified, S-containing polyphthalocyanine at different temperatures. The materials are named (Fe,Co)SPPc-T-sp, where T denotes the pyrolysis temperature and sp represents the silica protection applied for their synthesis. Among them, the material synthesized at 900 degrees C, denoted (Fe,Co)SPPc-900-sp, shows superb electrocatalytic activities in an alkaline solution both toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), with a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.830 V vs RHE, and toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential (eta(10)) of 353 mV. The catalytic activities of this material for both reactions are comparable with those of the respective benchmark, precious-metal-based catalysts, namely, Pt/C (20 wt %) and RuO2, respectively. An alkaline Zn-air battery assembled using (Fe,Co)SPPc-900sp as an air electrode delivers a high peak power density (158.6 mW cm(-2)) and outstanding charge-discharge cycling stability (for over 50 h). These catalytic performances are better than those of the corresponding battery containing Pt/C and RuO2 electrocatalysts.

Co nanoparticles dispersed nitrogendoped graphitic nanospheres (Co@NGC-NSs) were developed using a unique synthesis strategy, and it showed excellent bifunctional catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium. The potential difference calculated with Co@NGC-NSs, considering the potential for the current density of 10 mAcm(-2) for OER and current density corresponding to the half wave potential for ORR, is found to be (0.78 V) lower than that of Pt/C and IrO2 (0.87 V) system. The zinc-air cell constructed using Co@NGC-NSs shows an open circuit voltage of 1.36 V having a maximum power density of similar to 52 mW cm(-2) and an energy density of 876 Wh/kg, and these values are on par with the Pt/C system while much better in terms of long-term stable performance where Pt/C is found to be failing. A detailed comparison with the reported performance of other catalyst-based ZABs indicates that the Co@NGC-NSs-based ZABs has high potential as a practically viable system, where the catalyst development is also found to be simple and nonexpensive in nature.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2574-0962			WOS:000563784400061

Herein, hierarchical CoSx@MoS2 was synthesized via a one-pot solvothermal process. Formation of the heterostructure was confirmed by electron microscopy and spectroscopic techniques. CoSx@MoS2 showed competent electrocatalytic activity towards both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium. Superior electrocatalytic activity was attributed to the increase in number of active sites, betterment in charge transfer and facilitation of H- and O- containing active species adsorption-desorption at the active sites. Overall water splitting efficiency of CoSx@MoS2 was found to be superior in comparison to the state-of-the-art RuO2-Pt/C couple. Along with efficiency the heterostructure also exhibited long-term operational durability. Thus, hierarchical CoSx@MoS2 is a potential non-noble metal based bifunctional electrocatalyst towards overall water splitting.									36	2	0	0	1	0	37			2196-0216			WOS:000456207200020

Compound 1 displays a metal-organic chain-like structure formed by the {Cu-2(3-nba)(4)} double-paddle wheel units and the mu(2)-bridging L ligands. The adjacent polymeric chains form a supramolecular layered structure through hydrogen bonding.

They also demonstrate much better kinetic parameters compared to the state-of-the-art RuO2. Interestingly, under the OER operational conditions (in alkaline medium), the topotactic transformation of alpha-Co(OH)(2) to a stable Brucite-like beta-Co(OH)(2) phase leads to a synergistic interaction between the beta-Co(OH)(2) sheets on the CoO nanoparticles for enhancing the OER electrocatalytic activity.									36	2	0	0	2	0	36			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000409381800031	28820532

However, the controllable synthesis of a core-shell structure to achieve optimal OER performance remains a great challenge. In this work, we reported the crafting of a cobalt-hydroxides@polyfluoroaniline (Co(OH)(2)@PFANI) core-shell structure via a facile route of in situ polymerization. This strategy has good control over the thickness of the PFANI shell, which can be as thin as similar to 1.7 nm. Because of the unique composition (i.e., high electronegative F- anion) and thin thickness of the PFANI shell, the core-shell-structured Co(OH)(2)@PFANI demonstrated a synergy of electronic and interface engineering, leading to the optimization of electronic structures and hydrophilicity, strongly coupled hetero-interfaces of Co(OH)(2) and PFANI, highly exposed active sites, and accelerated charge transfer. As a result, the as-synthesized core-shell Co(OH)(2)@PFANI structure displays excellent performance for OER with a small overpotential of 265 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), surpassing most reported non-noble OER electrocatalysts. Therefore, this work provides new strategies for the rational design and crafting of advanced core-shell structures for efficient electrocatalysis.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2168-0485			WOS:000526884000033

Herein, an effective defect engineering strategy, Ar plasma treatment, was adopted to promote both the HER and OER activity of pre-synthesized Fe-doped Ni(3)S(2)nano-pyramid arrays on nickel foam. The abundant sulfur vacancies endow the Fe-doped Ni(3)S(2)nano-pyramid arrays with a low overpotential of 171 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)and a small Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1)to drive the OER in 1.0 M KOH. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that sulfur vacancies together with Fe doping can effectively regulate the electronic structure of Ni3S2, resulting in increased electrical conductivity and a reduced energy barrier, as well as enhanced reaction kinetics through weakening the binding strength between active sites and intermediates. Such defect-rich hetero-metal doped catalyst also delivers enhanced HER activity. As a result, a cell assembled using defect-rich Fe-Ni(3)S(2)nano-pyramid arrays as both the anode and cathode needs a low applied voltage of 1.63 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and exhibits outstanding long-term stability up to 60 h.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			2398-4902			WOS:000544657200009

For the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), these materials show a poor electrocatalytic activity. In this work, we take CoFe LDH grown on nickel foam as a model system, and for the first time we treat CoFe LDH under plasma etching conditions, which results in a highly active HER electrocatalyst in alkaline media. Massive defects and amorphous phase formation occur during plasma etching. More importantly, phase transformation of CoFe LDH into CoFe2O4 takes place. Additional introduction of Ce leads to more active sites and improved electrical conductivity, which provide an overpotential of 73 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for V-Ce/CoFe LDH. The experimental results match well with DFT calculations, proving that defect engineering, phase transformation, and electronic structure tailoring can result in a high efficiency of HER activity. Moreover, a cell constructed of CoFe LDH||V-Ce/CoFe LDH is capable of overall water splitting with a cell voltage as low as 1.65 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and a remarkable long-term stability of 60 h. The plasma etching strategy can also be effective for other LDH-based electrocatalysts (e.g. NiFe LDH and NiCo LDH), which demonstrates the universality of the strategy for improving HER performance. This work provides a simple but feasible pathway for designing alkaline HER electrocatalysts based on advanced LDH materials.									83	2	0	0	4	0	83			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000521200000022

Materials (Basel, Switzerland)				11	4						10.3390/ma11040601				2018 Apr 13	2018	Traditional noble metal platinum (Pt) is regarded as a bifunctional oxygen catalyst due to its highly catalytic efficiency, but its commercial availability and application is often restricted by high cost. Herein, a cheap and effective catalyst mixed with alpha-MnO₂ and nitrogen-doped Ketjenblack (N-KB) (denoted as MnO₂-SM150-0.5) is examined as a potential electrocatalyst in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER). This alpha-MnO₂ is prepared by redox reaction between K₂S₂O₈ and MnSO₄ in acid conditions with a facile hydrothermal process (named the SM method). As a result, MnO₂-SM150-0.5 exhibits a good catalytic performance for ORR in alkaline solution, and this result is comparable to a Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, this catalyst also shows superior durability and methanol tolerance compared with a Pt/C catalyst. It also displays a discharge voltage (~1.28 V) at a discharge density of 50 mA cm-2 in homemade Al-air batteries that is higher than commercial 20% Pt/C (~1.19 V). The superior electrocatalytic performance of MnO₂-SM150-0.5 could be attributed to its higher Mn3+/Mn4+ ratio and the synergistic effect between MnO₂ and the nitrogen-doped KB. This study provides a novel strategy for the preparation of an MnO₂-based composite electrocatalyst.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1996-1944			MEDLINE:29652850	29652850

The stability, lifetime, and failure behavior of the GDE were studied in a strongly acidic MnSO4-H2SO4 electrolysis system. The results show that the GDE has good reproducibility and stability, and its lifetime is up to 400 h in a MnSO4-H2SO4 electrolysis system. Parallel experiments indicate that the major reason for the first increase in the anode cell voltage is the deposition on the anode of a certain thickness of EMD. When the current density is 100 A.m(-2), the cathode reaction rate is controlled by a mixture of oxygen ionization and oxygen diffusion before failure of the GDE, and the cathode reaction process consists of two simultaneous reactions after failure of the GDE, i.e., oxygen depolarization and hydrogen depolarization. Hydrogen depolarization is the main controlling process after GDE failure. One of the reasons for electrode failure is destruction of the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) network structure in the catalyst layer and dissolution of the nickel mesh layer. Platinum agglomeration reduces the electrocatalytic activity of the GDE, and this is the main reason for electrode failure. Cathode failure is the main reason for the second increase in the anode cell voltage.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1000-6818			WOS:000329039600009

Modulation of the electronic structure through heteroatom doping is considered as one of the most potential strategies to boost OER performances. Herein, a rational design of Mn-doped NiFe layered double hydroxide/reduced graphene oxide (Mn-NiFe LDH/rGO) is demonstrated by a facile hydrothermal approach, which exhibits outstanding OER activity and durability. Experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations manifest that the introduction of Mn can reprogram the electronic structure of surface active sites and alter the intermediate adsorption energy, consequently reducing the potential limiting activation energy for OER. Specifically, the optimal Mn-NiFe LDH/rGO composite shows an enhanced OER performance with an ultralow overpotential of 240 mV@10 mA cm(-2), Tafel slope of 40.0 mV dec(-1) and excellent stability. Such superior OER activity is comparable to those of the recently reported state-of-the-art OER catalysts.

Herein, an interesting atom migration phenomenon induced by Kirkendall effect is reported for the preparation of cobalt-iron (Co-Fe) phosphides by the direct phosphorization of Co-Fe alloys. The compositions and distributions of the Co and Fe phosphides phases on the surfaces of the electrocatalysts can be readily controlled by CoxFey alloys precursors and the phosphorization process with interesting atom migration phenomenon. The optimized Co7Fe3 phosphides exhibit a low overpotential of 225 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 m KOH alkaline media, with a small Tafel slope of 37.88 mV dec(-1) and excellent durability. It only requires a voltage of 1.56 V to drive the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) when used as both anode and cathode for overall water splitting.

In this work, we design a highly efficient and durable water splitting system in an alkaline solution, in which platinum (Pt) sub-nanocluster (average size: 0.59 nm) functionalized nickel-iron layered double hydroxide nanosheets on carbon fiber cloth (Pt-NiFe LDH/CC) serve as the cathode and hierarchical (Ni0.77Fe0.23)Se-2 nanosheets on CC ((Ni0.77Fe0.23)Se-2/CC) act as the anode. For the HER, the threedimensional (3D) Pt-NiFe LDH/CC electrode with an ultralow Pt content (1.56 wt%) drives a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an ultralow overpotential of 28 mV. For the OER, the edge-rich (Ni0.77Fe0.23) Se-2/CC electrode displays a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small overpotential of 228 mV, and the Tafel slope is as low as 69 mV dec(-1). More importantly, the assembled Pt-NiFe LDH/CC parallel to(Ni0.77Fe0.23) Se-2/CC water splitting electrolyzer exhibits a high current density of 30 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.57 V, which is superior to that of the electrolyzer assembled using commercial 20 wt% Pt/C and RuO2 electrodes (30 mA cm(-2) at 1.62 V). Additionally, the Pt-NiFe LDH/CC parallel to(Ni0.77Fe0.23) Se-2/CC electrolyzer displays excellent stability over 40 h even at a high current density of 50 mA cm(-2), which shows its great potential in the practical applications of full water splitting.									45	2	0	0	0	0	45			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000457893400045

J	MARSHAKOV, AI; MIKHAILOVSKII, YN								THE INFLUENCE OF OXYGEN-CONTAINING OXIDANTS ON THE RATES OF CATHODIC EVOLUTION AND PENETRATION OF HYDROGEN INTO THE METAL								RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMISTRY				30	4			484	491						APR 1994	1994	The oxidants were shown to have a dual effect on the rates of hydrogen evolution and penetration into the metal. Reduction of oxygen and oxoanions gives rise to an increase in solution pH near the electrode and therefore lowers the rate of hydrogen-ion discharge. The values of critical oxidant concentration that correspond to a minimal rate of hydrogen penetration into iron were determined. Dependences of the rates of hydrogen evolution and penetration into the metal on the oxoacid concentration exhibit peaks with magnitudes that are determined by the electrode potential, solution pH, and the degree of metal surface hydrophily. The interrelations between the reactions of oxidant reduction and hydrogen-ion discharge were explained in terms of spatial separation of the reactants in the compact part of the electrical double layer.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1023-1935			WOS:A1994NY81500014

The electrodes were pre-anodized at a current density of 5 A cm-2 prior to determination of the kinetic parameters of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The presence of dissolved cobalt in the electrolyte enhances the OER since the accumulation of an anodic coating of CoOOH/Co3O4 on the electrode surface significantly increases the exchange current density, while the Tafel slope remains practically constant with the cobalt loading. The nature and morphology of the anodic coating were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and scanning electron microscopy.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:A1991FV73300005

In this work, I present systematical study of the hydrogen evolution reactions on MXenes (Mo2X and W2X, X = C and N) based on density-functional-theory calculations. I find that their HER performances strongly depend on the composition, hydrogen adsorption configurations, and surface functionalization. I show that W2C monolayer has the best HER activity with near-zero overpotential at high hydrogen density among all of considered pure MXenes, and hydrogenation can efficiently enhance its catalytic performance in a wide range of hydrogen density further, while oxidization makes its activity reduced significantly. I further show that near-zero overpotential for HER on Mo2X monolayers can be achieved by oxygen functionalization. My calculations predict that surface treatment, such as hydrogenation and oxidization, is critical to enhance the catalytic performance of MXenes. I expect that MXenes with HER activity comparable to Pt in a wide range of hydrogen density can be realized by tuning composition and functionalizing, and promotes their applications into hydrogen-energy technologies.									77	3	0	0	4	0	77			2045-2322			WOS:000382637600001	27604848

The growth of NiSe nanowire film on nickel foam (NiSe/NF) insitu by hydrothermal treatment of NF using NaHSe as Se source is presented. When used as a 3D oxygen evolution electrode, the NiSe/NF exhibits high activity with an overpotential of 270mV required to achieve 20mAcm(-2) and strong durability in 1.0M KOH, and the NiOOH species formed at the NiSe surface serves as the actual catalytic site. The system is also highly efficient for catalyzing the hydrogen evolution reaction in basic media. This bifunctional electrode enables a high-performance alkaline water electrolyzer with 10mAcm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.63V.									1202	70	0	0	32	0	1216			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000358621500038	26136347

In this study, amorphous Fe-Mo-O/NF was designed as an effective and durable catalyst for OER in 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution. The OER catalytic performance of amorphous Fe-Mo-O/NF is obviously improved compared to Fe2O3/NF. The synthesized amorphous Fe-Mo-O/NF exhibits excellent catalytic activity and the current density reached 50 and 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution with only overpotentials of 215 and 224 mV. This remarkable electrocatalytic activity is considered as the following: (1) The pristine catalytic performance originates from the OER catalytic activity inherent in transition-metal Fe-based oxides electrocatalysts; (2) the introduction of Mo element increases the number of active sites; (3) the coupling synergy effect between metals is more conducive to the adsorption of oxygen intermediates; and (4) the tight bonding of the amorphous Fe-Mo-O nanostructures to the conductive substrate ensures the structure rapid electron transport and ultrahigh stability. We anticipate that our research will extend the range of transition-metal-based materials as effective electrocatalysts for OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2574-0970		WOS:000821949000001

In fact, electrochemical water splitting, which is conventionally known as water electrolysis, has the potential to meet primary energy requirements in the near future when coal and hydrocarbons are completely consumed. Due to the sudden and exponentially increasing attention on this field, many researchers across the world, including our group, have been exerting immense efforts to improve the electrocatalytic properties of the materials that catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode, aided by the recent revolutionary discovery of nanomaterials. However, the pressure on the researchers to publish their findings rapidly has caused them to make many unnoticed and unintentional errors, which is mainly due to lack of clear insight on the activity parameters. In this perspective, we have discussed the use and validity of ten important parameters, namely overpotential at a defined current density, iR-corrected overpotential at a defined current density, Tafel slope, exchange current density (j(0)), mass activity, specific activity, faradaic efficiency (FE), turnover frequency (TOF), electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and measurement of double layer capacitance (C-dl) for different electrocatalytic materials that are frequently employed in both OER and HER. Experimental results have also been provided in support of our discussions wherever required. Using our critical assessments of the activity parameters of water splitting electrocatalysis, researchers can ensure precision and correctness when presenting their data regarding the activity of an electrocatalyst.									700	17	0	0	25	2	703			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000430537000003

All materials showed comparable OER activity with Tafel slopes in the range 56-98 mV/dec. The overvoltage at 10 mA . cm(-2), measured on a well-defined geometric surface area, was in the range 0.38-0.45 V. The best performing materials among the ones investigated were LaNiO3 (multiphase) and La2Ni0.9Fe0.1O4. The chemical stability of the stoichiometric materials was also assessed in 31wt% and 45 wt% KOH respectively at 100 degrees C and 220 degrees C. All materials were partially decomposed after 1 week of exposure at 220 degrees C. After 1 week of exposure at 100 degrees C LaNiO3 had formed secondary phases whereas LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 and La2Ni0.9Fe0.1O4 showed only traces of secondary phase. The main secondary phases were in all cases La(OH)(3), NiO, Ni(OH)(2) and Fe2O3. These observations indicate that the investigated oxygen electrode materials are not suitable for operation in alkaline electrolysis cells above 100 degrees C.

This work demonstrated the use of copper molybdenum sulfide nanostructures on Ni foam (CMS/Ni) as a bifunctional catalyst for the HER and OER. Physicochemical characterizations such as X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and field-emission scanning electron microscopic analyses confirmed the formation of hierarchical CMS nanostructures on Ni foam using a hydrothermal method. The CMS/Ni electrocatalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic properties in an alkaline electrolyte (1 M KOH) with a low overpotential of about 213 and 350 mV for the HER and OER (to drive a current density of 50 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel slope values of 80 and 124 mV dec(-1), respectively. A lab-scale water electrolyzer is constructed using the CMS/Ni electrocatalyst (as anode and cathode), which requires a low voltage of 1.62 V (at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2)) for electrochemical water splitting reaction. The multi-current and long-term stability analysis suggested better electrocatalytic properties of the CMS/Ni electrode. Finally, a self-powered water electrolyzer system was constructed via integration of a solar cell with the fabricated CMS/Ni electrolyzer, which demonstrated potential application towards next-generation energy conversion and management systems.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6				2633-5409		WOS:000612088000030

The hydrogen economy provides a very interesting scenario. In fact, hydrogen is a valuable energy carrier and can act as a storage medium as well to balance the discontinuity of the renewable sources. In order to exploit the potential of hydrogen it must be made available in adequate quantities and at an affordable price. Both goals can be potentially achieved through the electrochemical water splitting, which is an environmentally friendly process as well as the electrons and water are the only reagents. However, these devices still require a lot of research to reduce costs and increase efficiency. An approach to improve their performance is based on nanostructured electrodes characterized by high electrocatalytic activity. In this work, we show that by using template electrosynthesis it is possible to fabricate Ni nanowires featuring a very high surface area. In particular, we found that water-alkaline electrolyzers with Ni nanowires electrodes covered by different electrocatalyst have good and stable performance at room temperature as well. Besides, the results concern nickel-cobalt nanowires electrodes for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction will be presented and discussed. Finally, preliminary tests concerning the use of Ni foam differently functionalized will be shown. For each electrode, electrochemical and electrocatalytic tests aimed to establishing the performance of the electrolyzers were carried out. Long term amperostatic test carried out in aqueous solution of KOH will be reported as well.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9				1996-1073		WOS:000498072600080

Here we show that a significant amount of oxygen is released from the surface of correlated VO2 films during hydrogen spillover, contrary to the well-established observation of the formation of hydrogen interstitials in the bulk part of VO2 films. By using ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we prove that the formation of surface oxygen vacancies is a consequence of a favorable reaction for the generation of weakly adsorbed H2O from surface O atoms that have low coordination and weak binding strength. Our results reveal the importance of in situ characterization to prove the dynamic change during redox reaction and present an opportunity to control intrinsic defects at the surface.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1948-7185			WOS:000497261200046	31696710

However, the role of Fe for this enhanced activity is not fully elucidated, especially under hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we combine electrochemical and spectroscopic techniques to investigate the Fe doping effect on self-standing NiO nanosheets for enhanced activities for both HER and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in overall water splitting. The results show that the presence of Fe suppresses Ni self-oxidation and adjusts the Ni-O local environment and its ability to form surface phases. In operando Raman spectroscopy is utilized to explore the active intermediates present under catalytic conditions. Apart from a slight suppression of grain size, our results show that Fe incorporation into NiO enhances in-situ formation of active layered intermediates NixFe1-xH with a phase transformation of FeOOH layers into gamma-NiOOH layers containing Ni4+ at potentials approaching OER in contrast to undoped NiO electrodes with a dominating conversion of NiO to beta-NiOOH, with persisting Ni3+. In addition, the work function on the electrode surface is reduced by 90 meV upon Fe doping, revealing a higher intrinsic Fermi-level and thus a lower requirement for added bias during HER. Together with the lower resistance for electron transport beneficial for both HER and OER, this leads to improved OER and HER efficiency upon Fe-doping. The study shows how Fe doping influences the active catalytic NiO intermediates for both HER and OER. Specifically, in operando vibrational spectroscopy utilized in parallel with electrochemical characterization can shed light on enhancement mechanisms and influence of doping for catalytic intermediates under any chosen bias at the respective electrode under full water splitting.									113	8	0	0	6	0	113			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000503062400038

The Pd core stabilizes the Ru shell to increase the stability by up to 10x, while maintaining the high current densities of pure Ru nanoparticles. Results show that the activity and stability of the nanoparticles is highly dependent on the nanoparticle shell thickness, with thin Ru shells and full coverage of the Pd cote being vital for increasing both activity and stability.									28	1	0	0	2	0	28			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000442614000003	30074032

In this study, tremella-like Ru-doped Co-V layered double hydroxide nanosheets on Ni Foam (Ru-CoV-LDH@NF) was fabricated by a one-pot solvothermal reaction. As-prepared Ru-CoV-LDH@NF, with a nominal Ru loading of around 51.6 mu g cm(-2) exhibits excellent bifunctional catalytic activity towards HER and OER in alkaline media. To accomplish a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), it demands 32 mV and 230 mV overpotentials for HER and OER, respectively. The alkali electrolyzer utilizing Ru-CoV-LDH/NF as bifunctional electrocatalyst affords 10 mA cm(-2) electrolytic current density at an extremely low cell voltage of 1.50 V, showing excellent performance compared to a Pt/C-RuO2-based electrolyzer and many other bifunctional electrocatalyst-based ones. The incorporation of Ru changes the morphology of the resultant nanosheets to offer high electrochemical surface areas for electrocatalysis; at the same time, it significantly boosts the intrinsic HER/OER electrocatalytic activity. For HER, the energy barrier of the Volmer step is efficiently reduced upon Ru doping, whereas the Ru dopants optimize the absorption strength of *O intermediates to facilitate the OER process. This work offers a feasible means to optimize the Co-based hydroxide materials for improved electrocatalysis in overall water splitting.									29	1	0	0	0	0	29			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000591731700001	33225588

Herein, we demonstrate a stepwise electrochemical construction of crystalline alpha-FeOOH/beta-Ni(OH)(2) composite structure supported on nickel foam (FeOOH/Ni(OH)(2)/NF) through cathodic electrodeposition of beta-Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets followed by electrophoretic deposition of alpha-FeOOH nanoparticles. Taking advantange of the synergistic effect of Ni and Fe as well as the formed interface, this composite structure is highly active for the OER process in alkaline media (1 M KOH), providing a very low overpotential of 207 mV versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at a geometric catalytic current density of 40 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 70 mV dec(-1), which is superior to most reported (oxy)hydroxide-based OER electrocatalysts. In combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is verified that the synergistic interface effect between the real active sites NiOOH and FeOOH can facilitate the OER process. We believe this stepwise electrochemical technique for constructing Ni-Fe (oxy)hydroxide composites can provide new insights into the design and synthesis of highly efficient electrocatalysts for energy conversion applications.									61	4	0	0	5	0	63			2574-0962			WOS:000469885300105

Experiments were conducted under potentiodynamic and potentiostatic polarisation in 0.1M NaOH. In chronoamperometry experiments with steps between potentials, oxide thickness continued increasing beyond the onset of OER. The thickness dropped significantly from >10 nm to <5 nm approximate to 400 mV above the OER onset. The presence of CuO, Cu2O and Cu4O3 was observed by Raman spectroscopy after the onset of OER. Correlating with the thickness drop, strong PL was observed at 1.55 eV, indicating the formation of singly charged oxygen vacancies V-O(+), following the classical PL spectrum interpretation from the literature. PL observation speaks against vacancy pair coalescence as mechanism of dissolution. After electrochemical experiments, the films were n-type semiconductors, not p-type conductors as expected for copper oxides. Results indicate that transpassive dissolution may be triggered by the instability of the oxide with respect to defect formation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Hydrogen with no existing infrastructures for transportation and combustion will be converted to methane at the desert coasts by the reaction with carbon dioxide captured by energy consumers. Among systems in global carbon dioxide recycling, seawater electrolysis and carbon dioxide methanation have not been performed industrially.

Recently, much effort has been devoted to the synthesis and catalytic applications of HEAs. It is of great significance and urgency to explore new HEAs for the applications in clean energy conversion and beyond. In this review, we discuss the recent development of HEAs in terms of their synthesis methodologies and catalytic applications. Four novel synthetic strategies relating to HEAs are discussed, which include carbothermal shock, fast moving bed pyrolysis (FMBP), electro-shock, and theoretical prediction methods. Importantly, we highlight the importance of computationally aided methods, e.g. density functional theory (DFT) calculations, high-throughput, and machine learning (ML), to the discovery and design of HEAs. In addition, we focus on the applications of HEAs in the field of catalytic clean energy conversion reactions, including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and ammonia (NH3) decomposition. Furthermore, the prospects and future opportunities for utilization of HEAs from the experimental and theoretical aspects as well as their future applications in various catalytic processes have been thoroughly discussed.

Herein, hierarchically porous S,N-co-doped carbon materials derived from bamboo are prepared via pyrolysis of bamboo and thiourea to function as oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalysts. Due to their controlled mesopore ratio and increased effective dopant amount, the S,N-co-doped bamboo carbons (SNBCs) present half-wave potentials and stabilities comparable to those of commercial Pt/C catalysts. As cathode materials for anion exchange membrane fuel cells and Zn-air batteries, SNBCs exhibit high performances, attributed to their intrinsic activities as well as well-developed secondary pore structure in the catalyst layer. Thus, we demonstrate the viability of biomass-derived catalysts for practical energy applications.									72	5	0	0	1	0	74			2155-5435			WOS:000464075700068

However, this methodology is severely impeded by the tardy oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Hence, designing a preferable kinetics and thermodynamics oxidation reaction that supersede OER is very significant for the energy-saving production of H-2. Herein, hollow needle-like copper cobalt sulfide was constructed on carbon cloth (CuCo2S4/CC) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst to accelerate H-2 generation and simultaneously convert ethanol into value-added acetic acid. Thanks to the synergistic effect and unique structure of Cu and Co, CuCo2S4/CC displays superior catalytic activity and durability in ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) with a low potential of 1.38 V vs. RHE (@10 mA cm(2)). Meanwhile, it exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance. The homemade CuCo2S4/CC//CuCo2S4/CC ethanol-water electrolyser only demands a voltage of 1.59 V to deliver 10 mA cm(2), 150 mV less than that used for ordinary water splitting. This shows that the ethanol-water electrolyser elaborated here holds encouraging potential in the energy-saving production of H-2 and oxidation of ethanol into value-added acetic acid. This present work may open the way for the rational design of other electrocatalysts for efficient biomass oxidation reaction and relevant H-2 production applications. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The Co9S8/MoS2@NSOC nanocomposite exhibited remarkable catalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with overpotential of 194 and 233 mV in 1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4 solution under 10 mA cm(-2), respectively, which was ascribed to the multiheteroatom-doped hierarchical porous carbon matrix and the synergistic effect of intrinsic activity of Co9S8 and MoS2.

The N/C atomic ratios can be accommodated by regulating the amount of urea during the preparation of the hydrogel, and the final microporous structures are obtained after KOH activation. These materials present high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities in alkaline electrolytes, and the ORR performance of such materials is highly dependent on the N/C atomic ratio of precursors. Among these catalysts, the sample labeled PAM-N-0.41 displayed better ORR catalytic performance and stability than commercial Pt/C catalysts. The excellent ORR performance of PAM-N-0.41 can be attributed to its high specific surface area and large numbers of exposed active sites derived from the doping of nitrogen.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1452-3981			WOS:000429101700017

Herein, a highly efficient, pH-universal overall water-splitting electrocatalyst, was reported by ingeniously controlling the bulk and surface electronic structures of Ru with Co-doping and interfacial incorporation of carbon dots (CDs), respectively. The developed RuCo@CD electrocatalyst present superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities with great durability over a wide pH range, achieving a very low overpotential of 51 mV, 11 mV and 67 mV for HER, and 190 mV, 257 mV and 410 mV for OER at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1.0 M KOH and neutral 1.0 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS), respectively. A modified chemical/valence state originating from the strong electronic coupling process among Co, Ru and CDs, is revealed by combined experimental and theoretical results, which contributes to the optimization of water dissociation kinetics. A RuCo alloy was unprecedentedly endowed with efficient and stable bi-functional activities for the first time through electronic coupling with CDs. This reflects the dependence of catalytic activity on chemical/valence states and electronic structures at the atomic level. The work provides a new approach for the design of excellent Ru-based overall water splitting electrocatalysts.									49	4	0	0	2	0	49			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000536690000013

However, its catalytic activity is principally restricted by the low density of exposed active sites. Herein, we design hierarchically structured oxygen electrodes with a hierarchical nitrogen doped carbon layer on macroporous carbon cloth (termed as CC@NCLs). The outer NCLs are well controlled with the same chemical components and defect degrees, but different geometric structures. It is noted that only catalytic moieties adjacent to mesopores and macropores can be utilized. The multi-scaled CC@NCL possesses a large oxygen diffusion coefficient (4.97 x 10(-3) cm(2) s(-1)) and thereby a high utilization of catalytic sites. Resultingly, CC@NCL exhibits excellent catalytic activity for both ORR (half-wave potential of 0.855 V) and OER (1.580 V at 10 mA cm(-2)), and shows preferable activity and stability over noble Pt and IrO2 in zinc air flow batteries. This provides an insight for developing high density and accessible active sites in the practical energy device, including, but not limited to, metal-air battery, CO2 electrolyser and N-2 electrolyser.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000615923600003

However, their low stability under harsh electrochemical conditions hinders their widespread applications. Tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) has proven to be a stable material under ORR conditions, but its activity is limited. In this work, we incorporate single atom catalysts (SACs) in Ta2O5 resolves the limited ORR activity of this material by altering the electronic structures of surface Ta atoms. We use density functional theory (DFT) calculations to identify the most promising SACs with enhanced ORR activity. Pt, Rh, and Ir, are found to be the most promising SACs with improved ORR activity and high stability. This work suggests that SACs are effective in enhancing Ta2O5 catalytic activities for ORR.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000780999200001

In this study, we report a new strategy to significantly enhance the OER activity of Ni3Se4 nanochains via growth of uniformly vertical FeOOH ultrathin nanoneedles on the surface. The as-prepared catalyst demonstrates splendid OER performance with a low overpotential of 249.0 mV for driving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), yielding a small Tafel slope of 46 mV dec(-1). After continuous operation of 10 h, a tiny degeneration of 4.0% is afforded, evidencing the excellent durability of the catalyst. On the basis of electrochemical measurement together with theoretical analysis, we attribute the boosted OER kinetics to the synergistic effect of electron, geometry and interface, concretely, two main reasons should be emphasized: 1) the complementary adsorption/desorption nature of nickel and iron leads to optimized Gibbs free energy; 2) redistribution of localized pi-symmetry electrons at the interface endows the favorable adsorption/desorption for the oxygenated species. We anticipate that our work would push boundaries for the fabrication of high-performance transition metal- and selenium-based electrocatalysts. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In this approach, the preparation of stable and efficient photoanodes is challenging due to the susceptibility of sensitive semiconductors to photocorrosion. Here, we demonstrate a metalorganic electrochemical approach by which amorphous transition metal oxides are formed on silicon under cathodic electrochemical conditions. This approach makes anti-corrosive interlayers potentially superfluous and realizes an oxide-silicon heterostructure with enhanced activity for the light-induced oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolytes. Exemplifying analysis of electronic and optical properties is provided for a nickel oxide / silicon heterojunction.

The NCD@NiFe-LDH hybrid shows hierarchical three-dimensional flower-like morphology assembled with similar to 1.4 nm ultrathin nanosheets possessing higher surface area values and well conductivity. The as-synthesized NCD@NiFe-LDH hybrid exhibits excellent performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and just require 363 mV to achieve a higher current density of 500 mA cm(-2) compared to the state-of-the-art IrO2 in 0.1M KOH. Besides, NCD@NiFe-LDH hybrid shows long-term stability and satisfactory durability even at 10 00 mA cm(-2). Such an excellent OER performance at high current density can be ascribed to the unique porous ultrathin structure with abundant active edges and sites and the synergistic effect of the NCD and NiFe-LDH. The work offers a new way for the design and synthesis of other carbon-hybridized LDH ultrathin nanosheets with unique electrochemical properties. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there is a lack of non-precious electrocatalysts that are active and stable for the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) relevant to hydroxide-exchange membrane fuel cells. Here we report the discovery and development of Ni3N as an active and robust HOR catalyst in alkaline medium. A supported version of the catalyst, Ni3N/C, exhibits by far the highest mass activity and break-down potential for a PGM-free catalyst. The catalyst also exhibits Pt-like activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline medium. Spectroscopy data reveal a downshift of the Ni d band going from Ni to Ni3N and interfacial charge transfer from Ni3N to the carbon support. These properties weaken the binding energy of hydrogen and oxygen species, resulting in remarkable HOR activity and stability.									124	16	0	0	9	0	128			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000474803100047	30951227

Herein, quaternary electrocatalyst characterized by abundant interfaces supported on carbon cloth (denoted as Mo-Co-S-Se/CC) is designed through a facile solvothermal and post-low-temperature selenylation process, which delivers excellent catalytic performances in HER, oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) in alkaline electrolyte. Benefiting from the rich interfaces, the designed catalyst delivers current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) with low overpotentials of 58 and 167 mV, respectively, and small Tafel slope of 84 mV dec(-1) for HER. For the anodic OER, only 350 mV overpotential is needed to drive 100 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution. Moreover, Mo-Co-S-Se/CC also presents remarkable catalytic activity for UOR in 1 M KOH solution, which provides another way to substitute the sluggish OER to reduce the cost of hydrogen production. As a proof of concept, overall water-splitting tests are measured with Mo-Co-S-Se/CC as both anode and cathode, respectively, in 1 M KOH solution with 0.5 M urea; only 1.4 V is required to drive 10 mA cm(-2), much lower than that for urea-free electrolyte with 1.62 V.									48	2	0	0	2	0	48			2168-0485			WOS:000489986400081

By using a simple sonochemical route, we prepared amorphous Ni and Fe-alkoxide (NiFe(A)) NPs whose composition can be controlled in the entire composition range (Ni100-xFex, 0 <= x <= 1). These samples are composed of extremely small NiFe(A) NPs with Ni and Fe atoms homogeneously distributed. NiFe(A) NPs are readily converted into corresponding electrocatalytically active NiFe(H) NP by a simple electrochemical treatment. Electrochemical analysis data show that the OER activity of amorphous NiFe(H) samples follows the volcano-type trend when plotted against the Fe content. Ni70Fe30(H) sample showed the lowest overpotential of 292 mV at 10 mA and the lowest Tafel slope of 30.4 mV dec(-1), outperforming IrOx/C (326 my, 41.7 mV dec(-1)). Our samples are highly durable based on the chronopotentiometry data at the current density of 10 mA cm(geo)(-2), for 2 h which show that Ni70Fe30 sample maintains the steady-state potential, contrary to the time-varying IrOx/C.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			1350-4177	1873-2828		WOS:000412959700062	28946457

Cobalt-substituted SrTi0.3Fe0.7O3-delta: a stable high-performance oxygen electrode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide electrochemical cells								Energy & Environmental Science				11	7			1870	9		10.1039/c8ee00449h				1 July 2018	2018	A key need in the development of solid oxide cells (SOCs) is for electrodes that promote fast oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions at reduced operating temperature (les700 degC), with sufficient durability to allow operation over desired 40000 h lifetimes. A wide range of electrode materials have been investigated, with some providing resistance low enough for cell operation below 700 degC, but it is generally found that the electrode performance degrades over time. Here we demonstrate an oxygen electrode material, Sr(Ti0.3Fe0.7-xCox)O3-delta (STFC), that provides a unique combination of excellent oxygen electrode performance and long-term stability. The addition of a relatively small amount of Co to Sr(Ti0.3Fe0.7)O3-delta, e.g., x = 0.07, reduces the electrode polarization resistance by >2 times. The STFC electrode yields stable performance in both fuel cell and electrolysis modes at 1 A cm-2. The fundamental oxygen diffusion and surface exchange coefficients of STFC are determined, and shown to be substantially better than those of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta, the most widely used SOC oxygen electrode material. While other electrode materials have been shown to exhibit better oxygen transport coefficients than STFC, they do not match its stability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1754-5692			INSPEC:18626966

Herein, cactus-like porous cobalt oxide (Co3O4) nanoarchitecture doped with manganese cation and nitrogen anion (N-Mn-Co3O4) was fabricated on the nickel foam by hydrothermal and subsequent N-2 plasma treatment. Unique hierarchical structure and surface atomic engineering endow the N-Mn-Co3O4 with rich active sites, abundant oxygen vacancies, enhanced electrical conductivity and rapid ion diffusion. Hence, as electrocatalysts for OER, the N-Mn-Co3O4 exhibits low overpotentials of 302 and 320 mV to drive the current density of 50 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, and superior stability over 40 h under alkaline environments. More strikingly, when assembling the N-Mn-Co3O4 with Pt/C anode into an alkaline electrolyzer, the system delivers a small voltage of 1.55 V at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with excellent durability. This work may shed light on design and fabrication of efficient OER electrocatalysts by synergistically tailoring electronic and geometric structures. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we report a facile in situ self-assembly strategy to encapsulate a strong Bronsted acid, H3PMo12O40, in the customized cavities of an acid-vulnerable Co-based metal-organic framework (ZIF-67), generating a series of unique hollow H3PMo12O40@ZIF-67 hybrids. The calcination of the hybrids in air leads to porous Co3O4/CoMoO4 nanocages consisting of ultrafine crystallites, which provide rich active sites for surface redox reactions. Compared with Co3O4 derived from pristine ZIF-67, the optimal Co3O4/CoMoO4-50 exhibits significantly enhanced OER catalytic activity with a low onset potential of 1.47 V (vs. the RHE) and an almost constant overpotential of 318 mV to maintain a stable current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media for at least 15 h. These electrochemical performances are superior to most of the MOF-derived OER catalysts and highly competitive among reported non-precious metal-based OER catalysts. Furthermore, our study confirms that the suitable concentration of Co2+ in the octahedral sites plays an important role in the enhanced OER activity of Co3O4/CoMoO4-50.									111	3	0	0	8	0	111			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000423466100032

Herein, we report the first experimental and theoretical investigation regarding the influence of sulfur doping on the activity of a carbon nitride (C3N4)-based electrocatalyst in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). It is found that the sulfur dopant within the mesoporous carbon-supported C3N4 motif can remarkably boost its ORR activity, which rivals that of commercial Pt/C yet with better cross-over tolerance and durability, while the HER performance of the composite catalyst is superior than most other reported metal-free electrocatalysts and is even comparable to the most active non-noble metal -based HER materials. Theoretical calculations further reveal that the excellent activity of the doped composite stems from the high charge and spin densities in the C3N4 motif as well as altered competent adsorption energies of reaction intermediates via the atomic sulfur doping. The results in this work feature a facile and effective approach for engineering a high performance C3N4-based electrocatalyst, which may also enlighten the designing and fabrication of other metal-free materials as next-generation electrocatalysts.									90	6	0	0	5	0	92			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000382095100027

This process occurs through a light-induced cycle that produces oxygen and protons. While coupled proton and electron transfer reactions play an important role in PSII and other proteins, direct detection of internal proton transfer reactions is challenging. Here, we demonstrate that the unnatural amino acid, 7-azatryptophan (7AW), has unique, pH-sensitive vibrational frequencies, which are sensitive markers of proton transfer. The intrinsically disordered, PSII subunit, PsbO, which contains a single W residue (Trp241), was engineered to contain 7AW at position 241. Fluorescence shows that 7AW-241 is buried in a hydrophobic environment. Reconstitution of 7AW(241)PsbO to PSII had no significant impact on oxygen evolution activity or flash-dependent protein dynamics. We conclude that directed substitution of 7AW into other structural domains is likely to provide a nonperturbative spectroscopic probe, which can be used to define internal proton pathways in PsbO.									2	1	0	0	1	0	3			1554-8929	1554-8937		WOS:000334823200008	24437616

Normally, different electrocatalysts are applied for HER and OER because of their different reaction intermediates and mechanisms. Here, the synthesis of a heterostructured CoP@a-CoOx plate, which constitutes the embedded crystalline cobalt phosphide (CoP) nanoclusters and amorphous cobalt oxides (CoOx) nanoplates matrix, via a combined solvothermal and low temperature phosphidation route is reported. Due to the presence of synergistic effect between CoP nanoclusters and amorphous CoOx nanoplates in the catalyst, created from the strong nanointerfaces electronic interactions between CoP and CoOx phases in its heterostructure, this composite displays very high OER activity in addition to favorable HER activity that is comparable to the performance of the IrO2 OER benchmark and approached that of the Pt/C HER benchmark. More importantly, an efficient and stable alkaline water electrolysis operation is achieved using CoP@a-CoOx plate as both cathode and anode as evidenced by the obtainment of a relatively low potential of 1.660 V at a 10 mA cm(-2) current density and its marginal increase above 1.660 V over 30 h continuous operation.									84	3	0	0	4	0	84				2198-3844		WOS:000444940600028	30250794

Through rational nanostructure design with modified compositions, herein, a hierarchical scale-like trimetallic hydroxide (CuCoNi-OH) array is synthesized using a novel bimetallic 2D-zeolitic imidazolate framework (CuCo-ZIF-L) as structure-inducing template under a moderate alkaline hydrolysis strategy. The hierarchical and porous structure offers large exposure of active sites and rapid electrolyte diffusion, and the multi-metallic synergistic effect provides high electrical conductivity and fast redox transformation, both promoting the electrochemical reaction kinetics of supercapacitor and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). When evaluated as a battery-type electrode, the CuCoNi-OH electrode delivers a high specific capacity of 821.6 C g-1 at 1 A g-1 with capacity retention of 89.8% at 20 A g-1, and the assembled hybrid supercapacitor exhibits high energy density and power density. Moreover, the CuCoNi-OH electrode also shows competitive OER activity with a low overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mA cm-2. This strategy demonstrates its universality in the fabrication of bimetallic ZIF-L and corresponding metallic hydroxides, and opens a new approach for the rational design of high-performance materials for electrochemical energy storage and conversion applications.

ACS CATALYSIS				12	1			295	304		10.1021/acscatal.1c04647		DEC 2021		JAN 7 2022	2022	Ni oxides and oxyhydroxides (NiOx) have been studied for a long time as cathode materials for alkaline batteries and electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Yet, understanding of the connection between their atomic and electronic structures and electrochemical performance or stability is still incomplete. In this work, we use first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations to revisit the structure, electronic properties, and OER activity of beta-NiOOH, the catalytically active phase of NiOx. Following extensive DFT-based screening, we identify a hitherto overlooked structure characterized by a uniform distribution of H atoms on the NiO2 layers. All the Ni3+ cations in this structure exhibit an identical t(g)(6)e(g)(1) electronic configuration with an occupied 3d(z)(2) orbital. Comparison of the calculated bond lengths with extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data unequivocally supports this structure relative to all other low-energy configurations. Based on this structure, we uncover and detail defect-dominated OER mechanisms on the basal beta-NiOOH (001) surface, with overpotentials as low as 0.39 V. The present results should provide a valuable contribution to ongoing efforts for understanding and developing enhanced transition-metal hydroxide catalysts for the OER.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000733843500001

Herein, a scalable electrodeposition method coupled with in situ oxidation to produce amorphous Co-Fe-W trimetallic oxyhydroxides enriched with Co(Oh)(3+)is developed. X-ray absorption, in operando spectroscopic analysis, and computational studies reveal that 72% of the Co atoms are present in Co(Oh)(3+)sites. Fe and W synergistically affect the electronic structure of Co and provide a favorable coordination environment. The Co-Fe-W oxyhydroxide exhibits superior OER catalytic performance with an impressive turnover frequency of 1.96 s(-1)at an overpotential of 300 mV, a low Tafel slope of 32 mV dec(-1), and small activation energy of 53 kJ mol(-1)in alkaline electrolyte. The catalyst directly deposited on Ni foams can serve as a robust OER electrode in two-electrode water electrolyzers; they deliver a current density of 100 mA cm(-2)at a small overpotential of 234 mV in alkaline electrolyte with excellent durability under 100 mA cm(-2)over 120 h. These catalysts are excellent for practical water splitting applications.									26	1	0	0	2	0	26			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000574174200001

The Ag-TiO2 nanoparticles were characterized with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), voltammetric and spectroscopic techniques i.e. X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) and Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR). The results from XRD indicated pure Ag-TiO2 and TiO2 powders in anatase phase with an average crystallite size of 11 nm and 15 nm, respectively. However, Ag doped in TiO2 did not significantly affect the crystalline structure of TiO2. An efficient Ag-TiO2-based anode was fabricated by casting a solution of the synthesized Ag-TiO2 on glassy carbon electrode (Ag-TiO2/GCE). Linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) in alkaline media was performed to investigate the electrocatalytic performance of Ag-TiO2/GCE towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The OER is significantly enhanced at the Ag-TiO2/GCE, evidenced by a negative shift in the LSV curve of Ag-TiO2/GCE compared to the curve obtained at the unmodified electrode.

Herein, a series of CoNi0.5FexP/CC (x=0, 0.08, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5) catalysts have been successfully prepared by a simple hydrothermal and phosphorization process, and directly used as bifunctional electrocatalysts for OER and HER. Benefiting from the suitable Fe element doping content and novel nanowire-nanosheet co-existent hierarchical nanostructure, the optimal CoNi0.5Fe0.125P/CC catalyst shows an outstanding bifunctional catalytic performance, with 344 mV low overpotential to reach at 100 mA cm(-2) during OER process and 74 mV overpotential to reach at 10 mA cm(-2) during HER process. The water electrolysis device employing CoNi0.5Fe0.125P/CC as cathode and anode at the same time, it only requires as low as 1.61 V of voltage to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solution, implying a great practical application value of this novel hierarchical nanostructured material for overall water splitting.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2365-6549			WOS:000471808200010

It has been studied extensively by surface analytic methods, such as scanning tunneling microscopy. However, it is still challenging to secure a direct observation of the structural evolution of surfaces of nanocatalysts in reaction (gas and heating) conditions at the atomic scale. Here we report an in-situ observation of atomic reconstruction on Pt {100} surfaces exposed to oxygen in an environmental transmission electron microscope (TEM). Our high-resolution TEM images revealed that Pt-{100}-p(2 x 2)-O reconstruction occurs during the reaction between oxygen atoms and {100} facets. A reconstruction model was proposed, and TEM images simulated according to this model with different defocus values match the experimental results well. (C) 2016 Chinese Materials Research Society.

In these systems, one necessary reaction at the cathode is the catalysis of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which is the rate-determining factor affecting overall system performance. Therefore, to increase the rate of ORR for enhanced system performances, efficient electrocatalysts are essential. And although ORR electrocatalysts have been intensively explored and developed, significant breakthroughs have yet been achieved in terms of catalytic activity, stability, cost and associated electrochemical system performance. Based on this, this review will comprehensively present the recent progresses of ORR electrocatalysts, including precious metal catalysts, non-precious metal catalysts, single-atom catalysts and metal-free catalysts. In addition, major technical challenges are analyzed and possible future research directions to overcome these challenges are proposed to facilitate further research and development toward practical application.									115	10	0	0	3	0	115			2520-8489	2520-8136		WOS:000606752600002

Herein, hierarchical NiCo2O4@CoMoO4 on Ni foam (NF) was synthesized via a facile two-step method which involved hydrothermal and calcination processes. In addition, to explore the mechanism for the growth of hierarchical NiCo2O4@CoMoO4/NF nanostructures, variable time-dependent experiments were carried out. The results showed that the optimal NiCo2O4@CoMoO4/NF-7 electrode exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance and excellent durability for OER, HER and overall water splitting, which presents a low overpotential of 265mV at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) for OER and 121 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER in 1.0 M KOH. Meanwhile, when used as an electrocatalyst electrode for overall water splitting, NiCo2O4@CoMoO4/NF-7 shows a quite low cell voltage of 1.55 V at 10 mA cm(-2), and long-term durability during a 12 h stability test at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. The study demonstrates that synergistic effects between NiCo2O4 and CoMoO4 in NiCo2O4@CoMoO4/NF heterostructures can effectively enhance electrochemical performance and provides a wide range of possibilities for the further development of inexpensive electrode materials for overall water splitting.									120	5	0	0	1	0	121			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000445218000023

ORR is a cathodic reaction occurring in HFC, whereas HER can convert the H2O byproduct from HFCs into H-2 gas via water splitting. Platinum (Pt)-based catalysts are the most effective catalysts for both reactions. In this work, we used a fast, facile, and chemical-free method, called solution plasma sputtering (SPS), to synthesize Pt nanoparticles supported on Ketjen Black (KB). The discharge time was varied (5, 10, and 20 min) to alter the Pt loading. Characterization results revealed that the plasma did not affect the morphology of KB, and the Pt loading on KB increased with increasing discharge time (5.5-17.9 wt%). Well-crystallized Pt nanoparticles, similar to 2-5 nm in diameter, were obtained. Electrochemical measurements revealed that Pt/KB exhibited bifunctional catalytic activity toward HER and ORR in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. Both HER and ORR activities enhanced as the loading of Pt nanoparticles increased with a longer discharge time. Moreover, Pt/KB exhibited better HER and ORR stability than a commercial Pt-based catalyst, which was attributed to the stronger adhesion between Pt nanoparticles and KB support. Thus, SPS can be applied as an alternative synthesis method for preparing Pt/KB catalysts for HER and ORR.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2504-477X			WOS:000582120200001

Moreover, graphene and its derivatives have many advantages, including high electronic conductivity, controllable morphology, and eco-friendliness, etc., which show great promise for electrocatalytic splitting of water to produce hydrogen. This review article highlights recent advances in the synthesis and the applications of graphene-based supported electrocatalysts in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, powder-based and self-supporting three-dimensional (3D) electrocatalysts with doped or undoped heteroatom graphene are highlighted. Quantum dot catalysts such as carbon quantum dots, graphene quantum dots, and fullerenes are also included. Different strategies to tune and improve the structural properties and performance of HER electrocatalysts by defect engineering through synthetic approaches are discussed. The relationship between each graphene-based HER electrocatalyst is highlighted. Apart from HER electrocatalysis, the latest advances in water electrolysis by bifunctional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and HER performed by multi-doped graphene-based electrocatalysts are also considered.

Recently, FeNi3 nanoparticles encapsulated by one layer of nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) denoted FeNi3@NC were experimentally reported to be highly active. However, the electrocatalytic performance of such system has not been optimized and the influences of factors such as the thickness and defects of N-doped carbon layers on the catalytic activity remain unknown. In this work, we report that FeNi3@NC is more catalytically active than the same system covered by three N-doped carbon layers, and that the presence of defects in the N-doped layer only has a minor influence on the OER activity. We used density functional theory (DFT) calculations with dispersion correction based on a slab model of thermodynamically stable fcc(111) surfaces of FeNi3. We found that the mechanism depends on the charge transfer from FeNi3 to NC layers, which can be tuned by adjusting the thickness of the carbon layers. Our results agree well with the available experimental over-potentials reported in literature for NC as well as FeNi3@NC.					8th Czech-Italian-Spanish Symposium on Zeolites and Catalysis8th Czech-Italian-Spanish Symposium on Zeolites and Catalysis	JUN, 2019JUN, 2019		Amantea, ITALYAmantea, ITALY	4	1	0	0	0	0	5			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000522039100025

A simple model is proposed that assumes equal proton activities in the catalyst film and the near-surface electrolyte. Equations are derived that describe the limitations relating to proton transport mediated by fluxes of molecular "buffer bases" in the electrolyte. The model explains (1) the need for buffer bases in near-neutral OER and (2) the pH dependence of the catalytic current at high overpotentials. The latter is determined by the concentration of unprotonated buffer bases times an effective diffusion constant, which can be estimated for simple cell geometries from tabulated diffusion coefficients. The model predicts (3) a macroscopic region of increased pH close to the OER electrode and at intermediate overpotentials, (4) a Tafel slope that depends on the reciprocal buffer capacity; both predictions are awaiting experimental verification. The suggested first-order model captures and predicts major trends of OER in the near-neutral pH, without accounting for proton-transport limitations at the catalyst-electrolyte interface and within the catalyst material, but the full quantitative agreement may require refinements. The suggested model also may be applicable to further electrocatalytic processes.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11				2304-6740		WOS:000460321800001

Developing efficient catalysts and their synthesis methods is highly desired to improve the kinetics of the OER and therefore the overall efficiency of the water electrolysis. In this report, we present a facile wet-chemical method for synthesizing IrO2 and RuO2 nanoparticles (NPs) for the OER. The nanoparticles were synthesized by reducing metal chlorides in ethylene glycol in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone, followed by annealing in air. The particle size was controlled by adjusting the annealing temperature. The activity of IrO2 and RuO2 NPs supported on carbon black was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in alkaline (0.1 M KOH) electrolyte. As-synthesized IrO2 and RuO2 NPs showed high OER activity. The IrO2 NPs exhibited a specific activity of up to 3.5 (+/- 1.6) mu A/cm(2) (oxide) at 1.53 V (vs. RHE), while the RuO2 NPs achieved a value of 124.2 (+/- 8) mu A/cm(2) (oxide). Moreover, RuO2 NPs showed a mass activity for OER, up to 102.6 (+/- 10.5) A/g(oxide) at 1.53 V (vs. RHE), which represents the highest value reported in the literature to date.									41	2	0	0	2	0	41			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000382390900007		
B	Smith, A.M.								Transition metal oxides for solar water splitting devices								Transition metal oxides for solar water splitting devices								119 pp	119 pp						2015	2015	Although the terrestrial flux of solar energy is enough to support human endeavors, storage of solar energy remains a significant challenge to large-scale implementation of solar energy production. One route to energy storage involves the capture and conversion of sunlight to chemical species such as molecular hydrogen and oxygen via water splitting devices. The oxygen evolution halfreaction particularly suffers from large kinetic overpotentials. Additionally, a photoactive material that exhibits stability in oxidizing conditions present during oxygen evolution represents a unique challenge for devices. These concerns can be potentially addressed with a metal oxide photoanode coupled with efficient water oxidation electrocatalysts. Despite decades of research, structurecomposition to property relationships are still needed for the design of metal oxide oxygen evolution materials. This dissertation investigates transition metal oxide materials for the oxygen evolution portion of water splitting devices. Chapter I introduces key challenges for solar driven water splitting. Chapter II elucidates the growth mechanism of tungsten oxide (WOX) nanowires (NWs), a proposed photoanode material for water splitting. Key findings include (1) a planar defect-driven pseudo-onedimensional growth mechanism and (2) morphological control through the supersaturation of vapor precursors. Result 1 is significant as it illustrates that common vapor-phase syntheses of WOX NWs depend on the formation of planar defects through NWs, which necessitates reconsideration of WOX as a photoanode. Chapter III presents work towards (1) single crystal WOX synthesis and characterization and (2) WOX NW device fabrication. Chapter IV makes use of the key result that WOX NWs are defect rich and therefore conductive in order to utilize them as a catalyst scaffold for oxygen evolution in acidic media. Work towards utilizing NW scaffolds include key results such as stability under anodic potentials and strongly acidic conditions used for oxygen evolution. Chapter V includes work characterizing nickel oxide/oxyhydroxide oxygen evolution catalysts at near-neutral pH. Key findings include (1) previous reports of anodic conditioning resulting in greater catalytic activity are actually due to incidental incorporation of iron impurities from solution and (2) through intentional iron incorporation via electrochemical co-deposition, catalytic activity is increased ~50-fold over Fe-free catalysts.

Herein, we report on Mn2O3-based systems supported on nickel foams and functionalized with first-row transition-metal (Fe, Co, Ni) oxide nanoparticles (NPs) as OER electrocatalysts in alkaline media, fabricated by a plasma-assisted process. The remarkable substrate porosity and high Mn2O3 active area, due to the quasi-onedimensional nano-organization, enabled an efficient ultradispersion of Fe2O3, Co3O4, and NiO NPs into Mn2O3 and an intimate oxide-oxide interfacial contact, enhancing thus charge carrier transport and facilitating reactants and products diffusion. Among the developed systems, Fe2O3-Mn2O3 yielded the highest electrocatalytic activity, corresponding to a low overpotential of similar to 350 mV at 10 mA x cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 70 mV x dec(-1), allowing high current density values. The obtained performances, discussed in relation to the material properties, are superior to almost all the state-of-the-art manganese oxide catalysts and compare favorably with various noble-metal-based systems, paving the way to additional activity improvements via compositional and interfacial engineering.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2574-0970			WOS:000583331600095

Herein, CoFe and NiFe spinel oxide solid solutions with different Fe/M (M: Co or Ni) ratios are produced by a fast autocombustion reaction between glycine and the metal nitrates. The CoFe and NiFe spinel oxide powders are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy(EDS); then the catalysts are studied by Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) in 1 M KOH solution. The CV curves reveal that the CV signatures and the corresponding OER activities for both systems are crucially affected by the Fe content. The OER overpotential versus Fe at.% curves show minima at around 17 at.% and 20 at.% Fe for NiFe oxide and CoFe oxide, respectively. Furthermore, it is found that for NiFe oxide the minimum overpotential coincides with the maximum CV mid-peak potential, while for the CoFe oxide the mid-peak potentials monotonically increase without a maximum. The CV studies of the underlying synergistic intermetallic effects imply that the Co2+ and Ni2+ centers act as the active OER centers, and the Fe ions modify their redox and OER activities.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000572428400015

Herein, we demonstrate for the first time the production of Co3O4 and FexCo3-xO4 nanoparticles using vapor-fed flame aerosol synthesis (VFAS), a continuous and scalable process requiring minimal waste treatment. In 1 M KOH, the catalysts exhibit stable OER overpotentials of 295 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and Tafel slopes down to 38 mV/dec, which are comparable to the performances of wet-chemically derived benchmark (Fe-doped) Co3O4 catalysts. The high activity is attributed to ultrafine particle size of (D-p) = 3.1-4.4 nm and rich surface defects. Furthermore, nanostructured Co3O4 and FexCo3-xO4 films can be conveniently grown on graphite substrates by VFAS and serve as OER electrodes without further treatment. Remarkably, the morphology of the films can be easily tuned from columnar to granular by varying precursor concentration in feed gas, achieving optimal utilization of catalytic materials with a hierarchical structure consisting of elongated nanoparticulate building blocks.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2574-0962			WOS:000458705100054

Assessment of these materials is often complicated by inadequate dispersion of the materials, charge transport limitations, and lack of surface area characterization. Thin films deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) present an excellent way to overcome these issues. Here, we present the first work using ALD to investigate ternary oxide electrocatalysts, specifically with the Ti-Mn ternary oxide system. Thin-film mixtures of between 1.4 and 2.8 nm in thickness are successfully synthesized by ALD and show a high degree of mixing. At compositions between similar to 10 and 70% Mn:(Mn+Ti), there is a reduction in ALD growth rate relative to the growth rates of the binary constituents. Moreover, we observe a shift in the chemical binding energies of both Mn and Ti over this composition range. An elevation in the activity of Mn active sites for OER is observed with increasing MnOx content in TiO2, increasing the turnover frequency (TOF) by approximately an order of magnitude. These results are consistent with previous DFT calculations. We also explore the effect of film thickness of the ternary metal oxide on catalytic activity, highlighting how ALD allows for charge transport limitations to be minimized.									33	0	0	0	1	0	33			2155-5435			WOS:000350843500026

Herein, cobalt sulfide (CoSx) nanovesicles decorated with iron sulfide (FeSx) heterophases were successfully synthesized by using a metal-organic framework precursor through a solvothermal method. The obtained CoSx/FeSx exhibited much elevated OER activity as compared to pristine CoSx and even most previously reported cobalt-based electrocatalysts, with the overpotential of 304 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. As revealed by operando Raman and X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements, the electrocatalytically active species transformation in CoSx nanovesicles could be stimulated by the incorporated FeSx heterophases due to the increased average valence state of cobalt and lowered coordination of cobalt sites. As a result, the electrocatalytically active cobalt oxyhydroxides could be more easily formed on the catalyst surface during OER and thus contributed to the highly improved performance. This real-time spectral and electrochemical insight into the electrocatalytically active species transformation may guide the rational design of highly efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting from the viewpoint of electronic structure-electrocatalytic activity relationship.									72	5	0	0	5	0	72			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200020

Introducing structural defects to the nanosheets is a particularly attractive method for increasing the number of active sites and tailoring the intrinsic electronic properties. Herein, defects were introduced on Ni-Fe nanosheets through sequentially electrodoping and dedoping the surface of the material with tetramethylammonium ions. The as-prepared defect-rich Ni-Fe nanosheets showed an enhanced catalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) compared with conventional NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs), exhibiting an overpotential of only 172 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The relationship between pH and OER activity indicated that the lattice oxygens participated in the catalytic OER process as active sites. This work provides new insights into the understanding of the structure-activity relationship of layered materials and helps to develop new methods to implement defects on such frameworks aided by organic molecules.									9	1	0	0	2	0	9			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000555297100001	32666717	
J	Yang Lijun; Yu Yang; Zhang Lei								Construction of Dual-functional 2D/3D Hydrid Co2P-CeOx Heterostructure Integrated Electrode for Electrocatalytic Urea Oxidation Assisted Hydrogen Production								CHEMICAL JOURNAL OF CHINESE UNIVERSITIES-CHINESE				43	6					20220082	10.7503/cjcu20220082				JUN 10 2022	2022	A high catalytic activity and stable dual-functional hierarchical 2D/3D hybrid Co2P-CeOx integrated electrode(Co2P-CeOx/NF) for electrocatalytic urea oxidation assisted hydrogen production was prepared by multi-step electrodeposition and low-temperature phosphating on nickel foam (NF). Through the strong interfacial interaction and electron synergistic coupling between 3D CeOx nanoflower and 2D Co2P nanosheet, the as-prepared Co2P-CeOx/NF exhibited high conductivity, catalytic activity and stability, and enhanced the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) performance. Assembling an electrolyzer with a straight substitution of UOR for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) , it needed only 1.42 V to achieve a current density of 30 mA/cm(2), which was 0.17 V less than that required for water splitting. After 10 h of electrocatalysis, the degradation efficiency of urea reached 76.4%, realizing the preparation of clean energy hydrogen and synchronous wastewater purification, opening up a new path for green energy development and environmental governance. Based on the comprehensive analysis above, the electron transfer at the heterogeneous interfaces between 2D Co2P nanosheet and 3D CeOx nanoflower would cause the rearrangement of surface/interfacial charges ; the formed oxygen vacancies provided coordination unsaturated sites, exposed more active sites, optimized the adsorption energy of reactant molecules on the catalyst surface and promoted molecular activation, making it have higher catalytic activity. In this study. a 2D/3D hybrid Co2P-CeOx heterojunction was constructed to regulate the charge states at the surface/interface of the electrocatalyst and thus improve the catalyst activity , providing a new idea for the construction of other efficient electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0251-0790			WOS:000875469100002

The comparison is carried out on char samples prepared by gasification with both reactants under conditions satisfying a tentative criterion for kinetic similarity. Accordingly, reaction temperatures and partial pressures of either oxygen or carbon dioxide were selected so as to satisfy the equality of Thiele moduli.Char samples were characterized by porosimetric analysis in order to shed light on pore activation and textural changes induced by the two reactions. Differences in reaction mechanisms associated with the two gasification processes are indirectly assessed. It is inferred that the pathway micropore chemisorption-spillover-desorption at reactive sites plays a much larger role for O-2 than for CO2 gasification, providing a key for the differences in the observed gasification patterns.

Such an issue is particularly important in the case of the formation of nano-oxides, which have strong potentialities in heterogeneous catalysis reactions. Herein, we show that a Low-nucLearity graphene supported Ag duster (formed by 11 atoms) shows a local AgO4 configuration, spatial charge distribution and two oxidation states that are similar to those of buLk AgO. This result indicates that buLk oxide conformations can start to develop already for extremely small atomic aggregates (<1 nm), differently from metallic dusters. This local conformation shows the Lowest oxygen vacancy formation energy, which affords high efficiency in the ethylene epoxidation reaction with Ag and strongly supports the possibility of incorporating sub-nanometric dusters in important catalytic reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000818086900001

Herein, we describe a novel electrochemical deposition method for synthesizing three-dimensional NiCo, NiCu, and CoCu alloy foams at a planar electrode substrate for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and NiFe alloy foam for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The electrodes are composed of multiscale porous structure caused by concomitant hydrogen gas bubbles evolved during cathodic deposition. The unique electrode structure is beneficial for exposing more catalytic active sites, enhancing mass transport, and accelerating dissipation of gas bubbles generated during water electrolysis. The two electrode alkaline water electrolyzers constructed with these alloy foams can afford a current density of 400 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.73 V for Ni30Fe parallel to NiCo and at 1.71 V for Ni30Fe parallel to NiCu and exhibit excellent durability in prolonged bulk electrolysis. The strategy developed in this study highlights construction of three-dimensional, multiscale porous electrocatalysts at a planar electrode substrate which is significant for catalysis application.									14	2	0	0	0	0	15			2168-0485			WOS:000460600500092

Shape-controlled hollow nanostructures represent a class of interesting architectures for use in electrocatalysis, given that they may offer large surface area, preferably exposed active sites, reduced diffusion pathways for both charge and mass transport, as well as enhanced catalytic activity due to the nano-cavity effect. Herein, we for the first time report the synthesis of hollow cobalt phosphide nanoparticles with a well-defined octahedral shape (CoP OCHs) via multi-step reactions. When used as precatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline solution, the as-obtained CoP OCHs not only show high apparent catalytic activity requiring an overpotential of only 240 mV to deliver the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2), but also exhibit an exceptionally high catalyst surface-area-based turnover frequency (TOF) of 17.6 s(-1) and a catalyst mass-based TOF of 0.072 s(-1) at a low overpotential of 300 mV, demonstrating excellent intrinsic catalytic activity. Moreover, the CoP OCHs also show high electrocatalytic activity for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), outperforming most metal phosphide based MOR catalysts reported so far. The synthetic strategy reported here can be readily extended to prepare other hollow shape-controlled metal phosphide catalysts.									71	2	0	0	4	0	71			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000451600200004

A rectangular region was completely etched on plain glass and used as a spacer between reaction and cover plates to create a planar microreaction compartment. The water splitting activity to produce oxygen using sodium iodate as a sacrificial agent (electron acceptor) was tested in the fabricated planar microreactor under visible light illumination (with 400 W metal halide lamp). The effect of catalyst coating thickness and the reactant flowrate on the rate of oxygen production was studied in detail. An oxygen evolution rate of 3.99 mmol h-1 g-1 (1.84 mu mol h-1 cm-2) was observed from the IrO2/TiO2 film of 3078 +/- 362 nm thickness at an optimal flow rate of 0.3 mL min-1 in the presence of visible light. The stability study showed that the IrO2/TiO2 film was stable for at least 4 cycles, indicating the superior activity of the film firmly adhered to the glass substrate.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0960-1481	1879-0682		WOS:000862961300005

However, these metal cocatalysts can also catalyze hydrogen and oxygen recombination to form water. In this paper, we found that the pre-adsorbed halogen atom catalyst could inhibit the reverse reaction of water formation from H-2 and O-2 due to the decrease of adsorption energies of H-2 and O-2 on Pt. The adsorption energy decrease of H-2 and O-2 followed the order of F/Pt < Cl/Pt < I/Pt < Br/Pt. H-2-TPD results exhibited similar dependence. This inhibition was achieved via the occupation of halogen atom on the Pt surface sites, and thereby the adsorption and activation of hydrogen and oxygen molecules were decreased. The occupation difference of halogen atoms are determined by radius of halogen ions, which further leads the different activity for H-2 and O-2 recombination. By inhibition of water formation reverse reaction, the over-all water splitting over various TiO2 photocatalysts has been achieved. Isotope experiments with D2O and (H2O)-O-18 confirmed the over-all water splitting to H-2 and O-2. This study may help scientist to develop high-efficient photocatalyst for overall water splitting.									36	6	0	0	3	0	37			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000437965900026

In this study, YBCO thin films were produced by TFA-MOD method. The oxygenation process was carried out at 450 degrees C for 40 min, in various oxygen partial pressures from 0.01 to 1 atm. An in situ resistance measurement system was built up to record the resistance evolution during the whole heat treatment process. It was found that the resistance decreased exponentially and reached a saturate value in a few minutes during oxygen annealing. It was also found both the balanced resistance and the c-axis length of YBCO decreased with increasing oxygen partial pressure. A defect reaction was found to control the mechanism of the oxygenation process. A porosity assisted oxygen diffusion mechanism was proposed to explain the fast diffusion kinetics of oxygen in MOD YBCO thin films. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

In this paper, we report novel two-dimensional "senbei"-like Co9S8/CeO2/Co-NC nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (Co9S8/CeO2/Co-NC) derived from a unique 2D Co/Ce bimetallic ZIF. The phase transition from 3D spherical Co-ZIF to 2D Co/Ce-ZIF was achieved through the introduction of Ce ions.

Co-CeO2 nanoparticle-incorporated carbon nanofibers (Co-CeO2@CNF) exhibit an outstanding electrocatalytic HER performance with an overpotential and Tafel slope of 92 mV and 54 mV/dec, respectively. For the counterpart, electrolysis, we incorporate the widely used Ni2Fe catalyst with a high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity into the carbon nanofiber (Ni2Fe@CNF). To evaluate their electrochemical properties for the overall water splitting, Co-CeO2@CNF and Ni2Fe@CNF were used as the HER and OER electrocatalysts in an alkaline electrolyzer. With the paired Co-CeO2@CNF and Ni2Fe@CNF electrodes, an overall water splitting current density of 10 mA/cm(2) was achieved by applying 1.587 V across the electrodes with a remarkably lower overpotential of 257 mV compared to that of an electrolyzer comprised of Pt/C and IrO2 electrodes (400 mV).

Herein, ultrafine Co2P nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated in nitrogen and phosphorus dual-doped porous carbon nanosheet/carbon nanotube hybrids are prepared via a straightforward pyrolysis method. Impressively, the hybrids exhibit remarkable catalytic performance for both the OER and HER in 1.0 M KOH solution, with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low over-potentials of 280 mV for the OER and 154 mV for the HER, respectively. More importantly, when fabricated as an alkaline electrolyzer, the hybrids afford 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.64 V with strong stability, rivalling the integrated performance of a commercial IrO2 and Pt catalyst couple. The achieved ultrahigh catalytic performance can be attributed to the nitrogen and phosphorus dual-doped carbon nanosheets, carbon-encapsulated ultrafine Co2P NPs, high conductivity of incorporated carbon nanotubes, large surface area (199.94 m(2) g(-1)), interpenetrated macro-/mesoporous structure, and the strong synergistic effect among these factors.									77	1	0	0	2	0	78			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000386310600029		
J	Yan, Ran; Yang, Wangjin; You, Di; Yang, Hongxing; Han, Chong								Photoinduced evolution of optical properties and compositions of methoxyphenols by Fe(III)-carboxylates complexes in atmospheric aqueous phase								CHEMOSPHERE				295						133860	10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.133860				MAY 2022	2022	The changes in optical properties and chemical compositions of methoxyphenols, which acted as an important aromatic compound from the biomass burning, were investigated in the presence of Fe(III)-carboxylates under aqueous phase conditions. The light was confirmed to be a key factor for stimulating the reaction of methoxyphenols and Fe(III)-carboxylates. The photoinduced evolution of optical properties of methoxyphenols was dependent on various factors, including irradiation intensity, types of carboxylates, dissolved oxygen and pH. The changes in the mass absorption efficiency at 306 nm (MAE306) positively relied on irradiation intensity and dissolved oxygen. The acceleration effects of carboxylates on the decreases in MAE306 of methoxyphenols followed the order of oxalate > citrate > malonate. The change amplitude of MAE306 decreased with an increasing pH (3.5-9), while that of the mass absorption efficiency at 364 nm (MAE364) increased with pH ranging from 3.5 to 7. The compositional evolutions of methoxyphenols by the photochemical aging were analyzed with the attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR), confirming the decrease of C-O groups and the increase of O-H and C-O groups. The photochemical reaction pathways of methoxyphenols with Fe(III)carboxylates were proposed according to optical properties and compositions measurements.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0045-6535	1879-1298		WOS:000758401900006	35124090

The resulting IrO2Pt(Ni)/GC electrodes have a homogeneous and compact morphology (SEM), while surface electrochemistry and spectroscopic measurements (EDS, XPS) confirm the ternary bulk structure (EDS: 56.39% Ir- 7.60% Pt - 36.01% Ni atomic ratio) and the existence of a IrO2-Pt thin skin on the outermost layers of the deposits (XPS: Ir+ Pt atomic ratio of 21.7). IrO2Pt (Ni)/GC electrodes were evaluated as bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution (OER) and oxygen reduction (ORR) reactions in acid, by means of steady-state current-potential measurements and linear sweep voltanunetry at a Rotating Disc Electrode (RDE) respectively. The OER overpotential required for a current density (per substrate geometric area) of 1 (eta(1)) and 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(10)) on the prepared electrodes was 235 and 302 my respectively, which is in the range of some typical thermally produced IrO2-based DSAs. Their intrinsic OER catalytic activity (as estimated by normalization of the recorded currents at an overpotential of 260 mV by the oxides charge) was found to be 0.29 mA mC(-1) comparable or better to other thermally produced IrO2 and Pt-IrO2 systems. Koutecky-Levich analysis shows that ORR proceeds on the ternary catalysts via the four electrons pathway. The overall ORR catalytic activity (0.4 mA cm(-2) at +0.8 V vs. SIIE) is found to be in the range of that recorded on nanoparticle catalysts, while a suppression of the intrinsic activity compared to bulk Pt is observed most probably due to the presence of IrO2, the latter being in line with similar non-alloyed Pt-IrO2 systems reported in the literature.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000588305500005

The (PbO2 + CoOx) + Co3O4 composites thus prepared are very rough and their Co concentration, expressed as X-Co = N-Co/(N-Co + N-Pb), where N represents the number of atoms, approaches 0.5. As a result, they are more active catalysts in the oxygen evolution reaction than either PbO2 + CoOx or PbO2 + Co3O4 prepared in the past by our group. For samples prepared in the presence of particles, the potential required to evolve oxygen at a fixed current density varies roughly linearly with X-Co, irrespective of the fact that Co is present as Co3O4 or CoOx.

J	Shang, Yi; Niu, Fujun; Shen, Shaohua								Photocatalytic water oxidation over BiVO4 with interface energetics engineered by Co and Ni-metallated dicyanamides								CHINESE JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				39	3			502	509		10.1016/S1872-2067(17)62943-7				MAR 2018	2018	Photocatalytic water oxidation based on semiconductors usually suffers from poor charge transfer from the bulk to the interface, which is necessary for oxygen generation. Here, we construct a hybrid artificial photosynthesis system for photocatalytic water oxidation. The system consists of BiVO4 as the light harvester, a transitional metal complex (M(dca)(2), M = Co, Ni, dca: dicyanamide) as the water oxidation catalyst, and S2O82- as a sacrificial electron acceptor. The system exhibits enhanced oxygen evolution activity when M(dca)(2) is introduced. The BiVO4/Co(dca)(2) and BiVO4/Ni(dca)(2) systems exhibit excellent oxygen evolution rates of 508.1 and 297.7 mol/(h center dot g) compared to the pure BiVO4 which shows a photocatalytic oxygen evolution rate of 252.2 mu mol/(h center dot g) during 6 h of photocatalytic reaction. Co(dca)(2) is found to be more effective than Ni(dca)(2) as a water oxidation catalyst. The enhanced photocatalytic performance is ascribed to the M(dca)(2)-engineered BiVO4/electrolyte interface energetics, and to the M(dca)(2)-catalyzed surface water oxidation. These two factors lead to a decrease in the energy barrier for hole transfer from the bulk to the surface of BiVO4, which promotes the water oxidation kinetics.

The morphology and electronic structure will largely determine the activity and stability for amorphous nickel-iron-based catalysts. Herein,we developed a series of amorphous borate-modulated NiFeB OER catalysts through a facile two-step method, including sodium borohydride reduction and low temperature annealing. Benefiting from the monopoly of core-shell nanoparticles and the modulation of the boron electronic structure, the obtained NiFeB NPs-300 exhibits an overpotential of 231 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH as well as excellent stability.

The schemes include reactions competing with chain propagation through a reactive free radical. The chain evolution stage in these schemes involves three or four types of free radicals. One of them-CH2=C(CH3)CdotH2, CH2=CHCdotHOH, HCdot=O, o-CH3C6H4CH2Odot4, or HOdot4-is relatively low-reactive and inhibits the chain process by shortening of the kinetic chain length. Based on the suggested schemes, nine rate equations containing one to three parameters to be determined directly are set up using quasi-steady-state treatment. These equations provide good fits for the nonmonotonic (peaking) dependences of the formation rates of the molecular addition products (1 : 1 adducts) on the concentration of the unsaturated component in liquid homogeneous binary systems consisting of a saturated component (hydrocarbon, alcohol, etc.) and an unsaturated component (olefin, formaldehyde, or dioxygen). The unsaturated compound in these systems is both a reactant and an autoinhibitor generating low-reactive free radicals. A similar kinetic description is applicable to nonbranched-chain free-radical hydrogen oxidation. The energetics of the key radical-molecule reactions is considered.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1687-806X			INSPEC:12642336

The strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between the metal and carrier causes the charge transfer and mass transport from the support to the metal. Herein, Pt species (0.5 wt.%) with various particle sizes supported on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been synthesized by a photo-reduction method. The similar to 1.5 nm-sized Pt catalyst shows much higher HER performance than the counterparts in all pH solutions, and the mass activity of it is even 23-36 times that of Pt/C. While for ORR, the similar to 3 nm-sized Pt catalyst exhibits the optimal performance, and the mass activity is 3 times and even 16 times that of Pt/C in acidic and alkaline media, respectively. The high HER and ORR performances of the similar to 1.5 nm- and similar to 3 nm-sized Pt catalysts benefit from the SMSI between Pt and the CNTs matrix and the higher ratio of face sites to edge sites, which is meaningful for the design of efficient electrocatalysts for renewable energy application.									29	2	0	0	0	0	29			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000561725600001

However, the low current density caused by the competition of the oxygen evolution reaction at the anode has hindered the large-scale production of fine chemicals and H-2. Besides, the separation of products from the complicated electrolyte also remains a significant barrier. Herein, we present the integration of hybrid water electrolysis and conventional crystallization separation for the first time, achieving the electrocatalytic production and separation of benzoic acid without impurities. An amorphous nanosheet composed of Ni, Co hydroxide supported on Ni foam (A-Ni-Co-H/NF), with a large active area and low charge transfer resistance, is prepared for the first time and applied to catalyze the electrocatalytic benzyl alcohol oxidation reaction. A-Ni-Co-H/NF enables us to achieve an industrial-scale current density over 400 mA cm(-2) without the occurrence of the OER, and delivers ultrafast reaction kinetics. The yield of Ph-COOH is close to 100%, only spending 15 min at room temperature and atmosphere pressure. In situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that the as-made A-Ni-Co-H/NF catalyst features reversible structure evolution and recovery during the EBA reaction. The converted nickel oxyhydroxide containing Co species (Co-NiOOH) is confirmed as the real active species. This presents a novel electrocatalyst to achieve industrial-scale prodution for value-added chemicals and the novel integrated technology also provides guidance for the separation and collection of products during the electrocatalytic process.									48	7	0	0	3	0	49			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000599751100027

The origin of the abundance patterns, however, still remains poorly understood. We have studied the impact of p-capture reaction cycles on the abundances of oxygen, sodium and aluminium considering nuclear reaction cycles of carbon-nitrogen oxygen-fluorine, neon-sodium and magnesium-aluminium in massive stars in stellar conditions of temperature range x 10(7) to 10 x 10(7) K and typical density of 10(2) gm cc(-1). We have estimated abundances of oxygen, sodium and aluminium with respect to Fe, which are then assumed to be ejected from those stars because of rotation reaching a critical limit These ejected abundances of elements are then compared with their counterparts that have been observed in some metal-poor evolved stars, mainly giants and red giants, of globular clusters M3, M4, M13 and NGC 6752. We observe an excellent agreement with [O/Fe] between the estimated and observed abundance values for globular clusters M3 and M4 with a correlation coefficient above 0.9 and a strong linear correlation for the remaining two clusters with a correlation coefficient above 0.7. The estimated [Na/Fe] is found to have a correlation coefficient above 0.7, thus implying a strong correlation for all four globular clusters. As far as [AI/Fe] is concerned, it also shows a strong correlation between the estimated abundance and the observed abundance for globular clusters M13 and NGC 6752, since here also the correlation coefficient is above 0.7 whereas for globular cluster M4 there is a moderate correlation found with a correlation coefficient above 0.6. Possible sources of these discrepancies are discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1674-4527			WOS:000416068900004

The films realized a direct four-electron pathway for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media with an onset potential of -0.10 V versus the saturated calomel electrode. The films exhibited superior stability and better electrocatalytic performance than commercial Pt/C. Electrochemical studies and composition characterization illustrated that the enhanced catalytic activity of the AuNP/MoS2 films could be attributed to the synergistic effect of the positive onset potential of the gold nanoparticles for the ORR and the four-electron oxygen reduction properties of the ultrasmall MoS2 nanoparticles, which is different from gold nanoparticle and MoS2 nanoparticle modified electrodes.									49	4	0	0	8	0	50			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000340573200009

Herein, the morphology, crystal structure and more importantly, the OER electrochemical activity of Scandium-doped MIL-101(Fe) were investigated. It was found that the competitive nucleation as well as the difference in the oxytropism between Sc3+ and Fe3+ ions, which lead to the crystalline structure change and consequently the morphology evolved from quadrangular star-shaped bipyramid to hexagonal bipyramids. Moreover, the OER electrocatalysis performance was improved significantly when incorporation Sc3+ ion into the MIL-101(Fe) host body. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis demonstrated that the strong bimetal interaction between Fe3+ and Sc3+ ions, leading to well-modified Fe3+ electronic structure. It yielded optimal hydroxyl adsorption energy on Fe3+ and thus facilitated the process of O2 evolution. Such Sc3+ ion doping strategy to modulate the OER performance was also extendable to other Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) structures. It demonstrates a better OER activity with a low overpotential of 300 mV at 10.0 mA cm-2 and Tafel slope of 125 mV dec-1 for Sc-CoBDC-3, which provides great potential for fabricating optimal OER MOFs.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000817182400001

Herein, we have developed Ni-based efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts using apple seeds (that contains cyanogenic glycosides) as the precursor for nitrogen and carbon. With tuning the temperature, we were able to optimize the nitrogen doping up to similar to 3 at.%. The optimized electrocatalyst catalyses the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process with muted peroxide generation (for 0.750-0.1 V the % HO2- generation similar to 3 - 2%), preferential 4e(-) reduction pathways (n similar to 3.93 to 3.98 in 0.75-0.1 V range) and electron transfer via inner-sphere electron transfer mechanism which ensures the maximum utilization of instituted active centres owing to the direct interaction of reactant species. Alike to ORR, the superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with smaller E-onset, E-J =10, Tafel slope and enduring accelerated stability test advocates its potential as a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst. Moreover, smaller potential gap Delta E (E-J10_(OER) - E-1/2_(ORR)) of 0.845 V further warrants the energy efficient OER/ORR process. A porotype of Al-air battery system using our catalysts as oxygen electrode and chocolate wafer as anode material is well capable of powering the light emitting diodes.

The alloy core of NiFexSn could promote charge transfer, and the amorphous shell of NiFe (oxy)hydroxide is defect-rich and nanoporous due to the selective electrochemical etching of Sn in alkaline medium. The optimized catalyst of NiFe0.5Sn-A displays a remarkable OER performance with a low overpotential of 260 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 50 mV dec(-1), a high turnover frequency of 0.194 s(-1) at an overpotential of 300 mV, and a robust durability. Further characterizations indicate that the superior OER performance of the core-shell structured NiFe0.5Sn-A nanospheres might originate from abundant active sites and small charge transfer resistance. This work brings a new perspective to the design and synthesis of core-shell structured nanospheres for electrocatalysis through a facile electrochemical strategy.									47	2	0	0	4	0	47				2198-3844		WOS:000521812500001	32440488

The conversion of crystalline transition metal-based catalysts into partially amorphous counterparts is considered to be a promising but challenging strategy for improving OER performance of MNHS. Here, a simple and rapid microwave method is reported to synthesize partially amorphous borate doped iron-nickel nitrate hydroxide nanoarray uniformly grown on conductive iron foam (m-B-FeNiNH/IF) for OER. The microwave activation can promote the formation of the partial amorphous structure, leading to optimize geometric, electronic structure, and produce more high intrinsic activity. Moreover, with the addition of borate, synergistically promoted FeOOH (Fe-4(NO)(3)(OH)(11) -> FeOOH) as active species may significantly improve OER performance with a low overpotentials of only 246 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) and a 26.5 mV dec(-1) Tafel slope, outperforming most of the non-noble metal based catalysts reported. The partially amorphous and self-supported m-B-FeNiNH/IF maintain catalytic durability and structural integrity for 100 h at 100 mA cm(-2) large-current-density. This work may provide insights into improving electrocatalytic performance by introducing partially amorphous structures.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000830053600002

The primary issue in this field is the development of earth-abundant and active photoelectrocatalytic materials. Herein, a novel hierarchical g-C3N4/g-C3N4 metal-free homojunction catalyst is synthesized through partial hydrolysis of melamine in alkali and subsequent thermal treatment. RESULTS The hierarchical g-C3N4/g-C3N4 metal-free homojunction composed of lamellas features large exposed surface area, abundant interface contact and more channels for mass transfer, making it highly effective for water splitting with a small overpotential of 500 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and low Tafel slope of 93.1 mV dec(-1) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1.0 mol L-1 potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution, as well as 259 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 109.33 mV dec(-1) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 0.5 mol L-1 sulfuric acid (H2SO4) solution. Furthermore, the overpotential and Tafel slope further decrease to 383.4 mV and 69.52 mV dec(-1) for OER, 150.1 mV and 67.93 mV dec(-1) for HER upon visible light irradiation, demonstrating the exceptional photo-responsive catalytic performance, which can be attributed to the direct Z-scheme homojunction resulting in effective charge transfer and center dot OH and superoxide free radicals produced under visible light irradiation. CONCLUSION This work provides a facile but effective approach for the construction of metal-free OER/HER bifunctional catalyst with high photo-responsive performance, achieving higher activity for catalyst-assisted water splitting.

Here, a scheme for regulating the phase of electrocatalysts using carbon nanotubes is proposed, which significantly boosts the OER activity of transition metal complexes, exhibiting comparable electrocatalytic performance to noble metals. In this process, an organic complex of cobalt was combined with carbon nanotubes that prevent the catalyst from crystallizing during vulcanization, with sulfur atoms replacing some of oxygen atoms to further modify the active center. The as-fabricated amorphous CoOxSy complex showed excellent OER activity with a unique electronic structure, resulting in overpotentiats of 290 mV and 330 mV at current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, and a Tafel slope of 50.8 mV dec(-1). Moreover, the participation of carbon nanotubes further enhanced the electrochemical stability of the catalyst, which exhibited consistent performance in stability tests up to 60 hours. The results demonstrate the potential of carbon-based amorphous transition metal complexes as highly active electrocatalysts and provide a new possibility to design efficient catalysts by phase engineering.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1466-8033		WOS:000818954900001

Here we report a new FeNb (oxy)hydroxide catalyst, which delivered a high OER activity with an overpotential as low as 0.34 V (at 10 mA cm(-2)). To attain a homogeneous mixing of metal components, niobium was initially incorporated into the framework of iron oxalate dihydrate. The mixed oxalate could be structurally transformed into short-range ordered (oxy)hydroxide, the reactive species for the OER. Incorporation of Nb has been demonstrated to improve the intrinsic OER activity based on Fe species and to accelerate the charge-transfer kinetics across the solid-electrolyte interface. It is also found that strong Fe-Nb interaction can induce the formation of high-valent Fe species. Theoretical calculation results further illustrate the role of NbOx in the OER mechanism, in which Fe serves as the active site and the Nb species can promote the conversion of *OH to *O intermediates to reduce the OER overpotential.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000597647100031

In this work, we demonstrate a simple solution-phase method to generate nucleophilic sulfide sites on colloidal WS2 nanosheets that subsequently serve as ligands for Ni single atoms. These materials can be controllably functionalized with varying amounts of Ni on the surface ranging from 9% to 47% coverage with respect to W. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy coupled to electron energy loss spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy indicate that adsorbed Ni species bind as single atoms at low coverage and a mixture of single atoms and multimetallic clusters at high coverage. The Ni single atoms adsorbed on WS, show altered electronic properties, and both the electronic perturbation and isolated atom geometry play a role in enhancing the intrinsic catalytic activity of Ni-WS, samples for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction.									26	1	0	0	0	0	27			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000518024700091	31994865

IrO(2)is a promising and widely used catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction in commercial applications, but is rarely used for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), due to the high Gibbs free energy for hydrogen adsorption (Delta G(H*)). Herein, an approach to modify the electronic structure of IrO(2)via cyclic voltammetry is proposed. In this process, Ir(+4) is partially reduced and trace Pt is simultaneously deposited on IrO2, which greatly lowers the Delta G(H*)and thus accelerates the reaction kinetics. The as-prepared Pt-IrO2/CC with low noble metal loading (36.6 mu g cm((Ir+Pt))(-2)) exhibits excellent HER activity with overpotentials of 5, 22, and 26 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)in 0.5mH(2)SO(4), 1mKOH, and 1mphosphate buffer solution, respectively, making it possible to organize an all-IrO(2)based water electrolyzer. The Pt-IrO2/CC||IrO2/CC couple exhibits a promising activity and stability in pH-universal conditions as well as natural seawater for H(2)production. Density function theory calculations reveal that the optimized electronic structure of IrO(2)balances the Delta G(H*), resulting in a much enhanced HER performance.									62	1	0	0	4	0	62			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000540738100001

All of the electrodes were fabricated by growing the Ni(1-x)Cu(x)Co(2)O(4)electrode spinel-structural active materials onto the graphite felt (GF). Five types of electrodes, NiCo2O4/GF, Ni0.875Cu0.125Co2O4/GF, Ni0.75Cu0.25Co2O4/GF, Ni0.625Cu0.375Co2O4/GF, and Ni0.5Cu0.5Co2O4/GF, were prepared for application to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As Cu(2+)ions were substituted, the electrochemical performances of the NiCo2O4-based structures were improved, and eventually the OER activities were also greatly increased. In particular, the Ni0.75Cu0.25Co2O4/GF electrode exhibited the best OER activity in a 1.0 M KOH alkaline electrolyte: the cell voltage required to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)was only 1.74 V (eta = 509 mV), and a low Tafel slope of 119 mV dec(-1)was obtained. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of Ni1-xCuxCo2O4/GF before and after OER revealed that oxygen vacancies are formed around active metals by the insertion of Cu ions, which act as OH-adsorption sites, resulting in high OER activity. Additionally, the stability of the Ni0.75Cu0.25Co2O4/GF electrode was demonstrated through 1000th repeated OER acceleration stability tests with a high faradaic efficiency of 94.3%.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14				2079-4991		WOS:000580764100001	32878224

Constraining the evolution of the redox state of the mantle is of paramount importance for understanding the chemical evolution of major terrestrial reservoirs, including the core, mantle, and atmosphere. In order to evaluate the secular evolution of the redox state of the mantle, oxygen fugacities of six komatiite systems, ranging in age from 3.48 to 2.41 Ga, were determined using high-precision partitioning data of the redox-sensitive element vanadium between liquidus olivine, chromite and komatiitic melt. The calculated oxygen fugacities range from -0.11 +/- 0.30 Delta FMQ log units in the 3.48 Ga Komati system to +0.43 +/- 0.26 Delta FMQ log units in the 2.41 Ga Vetreny system. Although there is a slight hint in the data for an increase in the oxygen fugacity of the mantle between 3.48 and 2.41 Ga, these values generally overlap within their respective uncertainties; they are also largely within the range of oxygen fugacity estimates for modern MORB lavas of +0.60 +/- 0.30 Delta FMQ log units that we obtained using the same technique. Our results are consistent with the previous findings that argued for little change in the mantle oxygen fugacity since the early Archean and indicate that the mantle had reached its nearly-present day redox state by at least 3.48 Ga.

However, they often suffer from serious agglomeration during the electrocatalytic process, which leads to significant attenuation of catalytic performance. Herein, highly dispersed Fe nanoparticles with small sizes of similar to 7 nm are confined in amorphous carbon matrix by pulsed laser deposition technology. Based on this, a simple N-2 radio frequency plasma strategy is proposed to introduce N doping in the Fe nanoparticles. Electrochemical measurements suggest that N-doped Fe nanoparticles exhibit enhanced OER activity and stability, which offers a low overpotential of 246 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and the Tafel slope of 50 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH solution. Based on experimental measurements combined with first-principles calculations, the outstanding OER performance of N-doped Fe nanoparticles can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the unique confined structure and N doping, which not only enhances the electrochemical surface area and improves electrical conductivity but also weakens the adsorption of intermediates and reduces the energy barrier of OER reaction. This work provides a facile method for the construction of metal nanoparticles with confined nanostructure and controlled N doping, which will greatly promote the development of OER electrocatalysts.& nbsp;Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0003-6951	1077-3118		WOS:000787884500003

The key to realizing hydrogen-based energy systems is to develop efficient and economical hydrogen production methods. The water electrolysis technique has the advantages of cleanliness, sustainability, and high efficiency, which can be applied to large-scale hydrogen production. However, the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode plays a decisive role in the efficiency of hydrogen evolution during water splitting. Generally, noble metal catalysts (such as ruthenium and iridium) are considered to exhibit the best OER performance; however, they exhibit disadvantages such as high costs, limited reserves, and poor stability. Therefore, the research on highly efficient non-noble metal catalysts that can replace their noble metal counterparts has always been important. This review presents the recent advances in the preparation of high-performance OER electrocatalysts by regulating the electronic structure of 3d transition metals. First, we introduce the reaction mechanism of water splitting and the OER, which reveals the high requirement of the complex four-electron process of the OER. Second, the electron transfer mode and development progress of highly active transition metal electrocatalysts are used to summarize the research situation of transition metal OER catalysts in water splitting. Finally, the future development direction and challenges of transition metal catalysts are prospected based on the current research progress.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000772977500001	35333268

Carbon-based nanomaterials have been widely employed as electrocatalysts for the independent HER or OER; however, research on bifunctional metal-free electrocatalysts for water splitting is still in its infancy and remains a formidable challenge to develop highly active catalysts for future applications. Here we report a highly active defect-rich, carbon-based, bifunctional metal-free water splitting electrocatalyst, prepared by a template approach, in which a nitrogen-enriched polydopamine analogue is used as the carbon precursor. The resultant defect-rich porous carbon (DRPC) exhibits a large specific surface area with a hierarchically micro/ mesoporous structure and a high nitrogen doping content with rich pyridinic N. Accordingly, the newly developed DRPC electrocatalysts display superb bifunctional catalytic activities for both the HER and the OER in alkaline solution, outperforming all other reported metal-free catalysts. Significantly, the DRPC catalyst couple-based alkaline water electrolyzer with strong durability delivers a 10 mA cm(-2) overall water splitting current at a considerably low voltage of 1.74 V, and a demonstration of a self-powered electrochemical water splitting system is also presented, highlighting its great potential for practical applications.									51	7	0	0	2	0	53			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000407641200065

Here we propose a strategy for the development of controllably alloyed, porous, and low density nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co) based alloys - hose electrocatalytic properties can be tuned to make them multifunctional. Ni and Co based alloy with the chemical structure of Ni1Co2 is identified as an efficient OER catalyst among other stoichiometric structures in terms of over potential @ 10 mAcm(-2) (1.629 V), stability, low tafel slope (87.3 mV/dec), and high Faradaic efficiency (92%), and its OER performance is also found to be on par with the benchmarked IrO2. Tunability in the porous metal synthesis strategy allowed the incorporation of graphene during the Ni sponge formation, and the Ni-incorporated nitrogen doped graphene sponge (Ni-NG) is found to have very high HER activity. A water electrolysis cell fabricated and demonstrated with these freestanding electrodes is found to have high stability (>10 hours) and large current density (10 mAcm(-2) @ 1.6 V), opening new avenues in the design and development of cost effective and light weight energy devices.									38	1	0	0	1	0	38			2045-2322			WOS:000381183400004	27510857

Understanding the exact mechanisms of oxygen evolution by water-splitting reaction, which has been regarded as a bottleneck to realize the water splitting in practical basis, should help us to enhance solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency. Here, we present a detailed investigation based on two types of bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) crystals. One is a monoclinic scheelite crystal that forms a truncated tetragonal bipyramidal shape (MS), and the other is a tetragonal zircon crystal that forms an octahedral shape (TZ). MS, which has relatively higher photocatalytic activity of water oxidation, rarely adsorbed reduced mediator (Fe2+).

In this study, three-dimensional (3D) cobalt-nickel bimetal MOFs were used as precursors to synthesize catalysts through thermal decomposition, carbonization, nitriding, oxidation, phosphating, sulfurizing, and selenization, respectively. In 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, the overpotential of Co/Ni-MOFs@Se for OER was 238 mV and the that of Co/Ni-MOFs@P for HER was 194 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Based on the excellent OER and HER performances of Co/Ni-MOFs@Se and Co/Ni-MOFs@P, these two materials were further assembled into electrodes for overall water splitting. Results showed that a potential of only 1.59 V was required to provide a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The electrodes also exhibited long-term durability in a 2000 min stability test without significant changes in the catalytic performances. According to the difference in the doped nonmetal elements, an electrode pair with a suitable matching degree was constructed, thereby improving the overall water splitting performance. Thus, the controllable modification of the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-derived carbon materials (CMs) effectively improved the materials' catalytic water splitting performance. It was possible to further develop an efficient, inexpensive, and low-cost assembled electrode pair. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, the current methods fail to distinguish multiple pathways (multi-paths) of polymer aging due to the lack of spatiotemporal resolution. In this work, using polyimide as a model polymer, the hydroxyl, carboxyl, and amino groups from the polyimide aging process were labeled using specific fluorescent probes through boron-oxygen, imine, and thiourea linkages, respectively. When the excitation and emission wavelengths of each fluorescent probe were controlled, the multi-paths in polyimide aging can be visualized individually and simultaneously in three-dimensional fluorescent images. The overall aging process under hydrothermal treatment was destructured into the pyrolysis and hydrolysis pathways. Three-dimensional dynamic studies discovered that the increased humidity, along with the decreased oxygen content, could hamper the pyrolysis reaction and accelerate the hydrolysis reaction, leading to severe degradation of the overall polyimide aging. More importantly, the oxygen showed a higher regulation coefficient in accelerating the pyrolysis reaction, than the water vapor in motivating the hydrolysis reactions. Such a multidimensional identification methodology is able to guide the long-term use of polymers and control their aging process to a harmless direction in advance by tuning the contents of oxygen and water vapor.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000679366000042	34269562

The NiCo2O4 catalyst with S-doped rGO outperformed the other catalysts, indicating that the sulphur atoms attached on rGO possess low oxophilicity and optimum free energy. This results in facile adsorption of the intermediate products formed during the OER and a rapid release of O-2 molecules. The same catalyst requires an overpotential of 1.51 V vs. RHE to attain the benchmark current density value of 10 mA cm(-2) and shows a Tafel slope of 57 mV dec(-1). It also reveals outstanding stability during its operation for 10 h with a minimum loss in potential. On the other hand, NiCo2O4/S,N-rGO reveals superior activity with high efficiency and stability in catalyzing methanol oxidation. The catalyst delivered a low onset potential of 0.12 V vs. Hg/HgO and high current density of 203.4 mA cm(-2) after addition of 0.5 M methanol, revealing the outstanding performance of the electrocatalyst.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2516-0230			WOS:000642106200001	36133652

However, most of its OER catalytic studies are mainly based on aggregated LiCoO2 powder, and thus construction of distinct LiCoO2 nanostructures would be the primary quest for OER performance optimization. In this work, mesoporous LiCoO2 hierarchical nanosheets were hydrothermally synthesized on carbon cloth and then chemically delithiated for OER electrocatalysis. Two types of LiCoO2 hierarchical nanostructures, including sheet-on-rod and sheet-on-sheet features, have been prepared and compared for OER activity. The LiCoO2 sheet-on-sheet structure with higher OER performance was further chemically delithiated towards Li1-xCoO2 to activate the Co4+/Co3+ pair and boost the OER process. As a result, the delithiated LiCo0.72O2 catalyst delivers an outstanding and durable catalytic performance toward OER in alkaline solution, including an overpotential of 289 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), small Tafel slope, and low charge transfer resistance. First-principle calculations indicate that the delithiation can change the electronic state of the LiCoO2 system, and the water oxidation can be promoted by optimizing the adsorption Gibbs free energy of OER intermediates. The present investigation paves an interesting avenue for the rational design of highly efficient LiCoO2 water oxidation catalysts. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Currently, most related work focuses on employing MOFs as porous substrate materials to fabricate confined nanoparticle or heteroatom-doped electrocatalysts which have to be annealed at high temperature before application. However, the annealing process would destroy the structure completely and lose the intrinsic active sites in MOFs framework. Herein, a simple solvothermal process is used to synthesize a series of Fe/Ni bimetallic MOFs. The as-prepared MOFs are applied directly as highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts with no post-annealing treatment. The bimetallic FeNi-MOFs show higher OER activity than single metal MOFs and commercial precious RuO2 catalysts. With the optimized FeNi-MOF as the catalyst, the OER current densities of 50 and 100 mA/cm(2) can be achieved at the overpotentials of only 270 and 287 mV, respectively. Meanwhile, a small Tafel slope of 49 mV/dec was obtained. Moreover, this catalyst shows high electrochemical stability in strong basic solution. This work demonstrates that through structural optimization, bimetallic and multimetallic MOFs may have promising potentials as advanced catalysts for electrochemical energy conversion.									92	5	0	0	2	0	92			2168-0485			WOS:000470331800003

In particular, the precise modulations in the porosity and size are highly challenging. In this work, we have introduced small molecules to overcome such a challenge. And this substantially contributes to the energy related applications, especially to the water-energy (WE) treatment. Electrocatalytic water-splitting is hindered by the sluggish kinetics of water oxidation, requiring efficient earth-abundant electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein we demonstrate the robust OER activity by introducing metal and oxygen multivacancies in noble-metal-free layered double hydroxides (LDHs) through the specific electron-withdrawing organic molecule methyl-isorhodanate (CH3NCS). Our work reveals that the metal and oxygen vacancies endow NiFe LDH with enhanced electron transfer and modulate the H2O adsorption, thereby boosting the OER electrocatalytic properties. Remarkably, the best-performing laminar NiFe LDH nanosheets with metal and oxygen multivacancies (v-L-LDHs) show an ultra-low overpotential of 230 mV at 100 mA cm(2) and Tafel slope of 37.1 mV dec 1. Density functional theory (DFT) has revealed the improved OER performance is realized by the co-existence of metal and O vacancies in NiFe LDH, where the defective region activates the electroactivity of Ni sites and O sites to promote the electron transfer and intermediate transformation. The Fe sites play a key role to preserve the high electroactivity of the Ni sites in long-term applications. The superior OER performance underpins the high potential of the reported facile organic anchor strategy for designing and synthesizing advanced electrocatalysts in both LDH and other potential 2D layered materials.									86	4	0	0	3	0	88			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000620327600002

Herein, we use a standard protocol as a primary screen for evaluating the activity, short-term (2 h) stability, and electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of 18 electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 26 electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under conditions relevant to an integrated solar water-splitting device in aqueous acidic or alkaline solution. Our primary figure of merit is the overpotential necessary to achieve a magnitude current density of 10 mA cm(-2) per geometric area, the approximate current density expected for a 10% efficient solar-to-fuels conversion device under 1 sun illumination. The specific activity per ECSA of each material is also reported. Among HER catalysts, several could operate at 10 mA cm(-2) with overpotentials <0.1 V in acidic and/or alkaline solutions. Among OER catalysts in acidic solution, no non-noble metal based materials showed promising activity and stability, whereas in alkaline solution many OER catalysts performed with similar activity achieving 10 mA cm(-2) current densities at overpotentials of similar to 0.33-0.5 V. Most OER catalysts showed comparable or better specific activity per ECSA when compared to Ir and Ru catalysts in alkaline solutions, while most HER catalysts showed much lower specific activity than Pt in both acidic and alkaline solutions. For select catalysts, additional secondary screening measurements were conducted including Faradaic efficiency and extended stability measurements.									2437	85	0	0	134	0	2459			0002-7863			WOS:000352752000019	25668483

However, the design of such a device has been impeded by sluggish kinetics of its half reactions, i.e., cathodic N-2 reduction reaction (NRR) and anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, it is predicted from density function theory that high-entropy oxides (HEOs) are potential catalysts for promoting NRR and OER, and subsequently develop a facile procedure to synthesize HEOs in the morphology of sea urchin-shaped hollow nanospheres assembled from ultrathin nanosheets. The excellent electrocatalytic activities of HEOs for both NRR (NH3 yield rate: 47.58 mu g h(-1) mg(-1) and Faradaic efficiency (FE): 10.74%) and OER (215 mV @10 mA cm(-2)) are demonstrated. Consequently, a prototype device of N-2 electrolysis driven by commercial batteries is constructed, which can operate smoothly and deliver remarkable NH3 yield rate (41.11 mu g h(-1) mg(-1)) and FE (14.14%). Further mechanism study has attributed the excellent catalytic performances of HEOs to their unique electronic structures originated from multi-metal synergistic effects and entropy increase effects. The work will provide new clues for designing versatile catalysts and devices for large-scale industrialization.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000740641000001	35001481

Metal surfaces can catalyze the same transformations by coupling independent half-reactions for oxygen reduction and substrate oxidation mediated via the exchange of band-electrons. Metal- and nitrogen-doped carbons (MNCs) are promising catalysts for aerobic oxidation that consist of molecule-like active sites embedded in conductive carbon hosts. Owing to their combined molecular and metallic features, it remains unclear whether they catalyze aerobic oxidation via the sequential redox cycling pathways of molecules or band-mediated pathways of metals. Herein, we simultaneously track the potential of the catalyst and the rate of turnover of aerobic hydroquinone oxidation on a cobalt-based MNC catalyst in contact with a carbon electrode. By comparing operando measurements of rate and potential with the current-voltage behavior of each constituent half-reaction under identical conditions, we show that these molecular materials can display the band-mediated reaction mechanisms of extended metallic solids. We show that the action of these band-mediated mechanisms explains the fractional reaction orders in both oxygen and hydroquinone, the time evolution of catalyst potential and rate, and the dependence of rate on the overall reaction free energy. Selective poisoning experiments suggest that oxygen reduction proceeds at cobalt sites, whereas hydroquinone oxidation proceeds at native carbon-oxide defects on the MNC catalyst. These findings highlight that molecule-like active sites can take advantage of band-mediated mechanisms when coupled to conductive hosts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000820974500001	35699525

In this study, we experimentally investigated the kinetics of oxygen isotopic exchange between submicron-sized amorphous forsterite grains and water vapor at protoplanetary disk-like low pressures of water vapor. The isotopic exchange reaction rate is controlled either by diffusive isotopic exchange in the amorphous structure or by the supply of water molecules from the vapor phase. The diffusive oxygen isotopic exchange occurred with a rate constant D (m(2) s(-1)) = (1.5 +/- 1.0) x 10(-19) exp[-(161.5 +/- 14.1 (kJ mol(-1))) R-1(1/T-1/1200)] at temperatures below similar to 800-900 K, and the supply of water molecules from the vapor phase could determine the rate of oxygen isotopic exchange at higher temperatures in the protosolar disk. On the other hand, the oxygen isotopic exchange rate dramatically decreases if the crystallization of amorphous forsterite precedes the oxygen isotopic exchange reaction with amorphous forsterite. According to the kinetics for oxygen isotopic exchange in protoplanetary disks, original isotopic compositions of amorphous forsterite dust could be preserved only if the dust was kept at temperatures below 500-600 K in the early solar system. The O-16-poor signatures for the most pristine silicate dust observed in cometary materials implies that the cometary silicate dust experienced oxygen isotopic exchange with O-16-poor water vapor through thermal annealing at temperatures higher than 500-600 K prior to their accretion into comets in the solar system.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000445822300007

A method has been developed for the preparation of hematite particles by using xonotlite nanowires (XNWs) as growth modifiers. The concentration of the XNWs has a profound effect on the final morphology of the products, whereas the concentration of the iron(III) ions can control the size of the hematite particles. The underlying mechanism of the bio-inspired XNW-modified mineralization process has been proposed. The obtained hematite particles exhibit good catalytic performance in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), affording a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with an overpotential of 370 mV, a small Tafel slope of 65 mV dec(-1), and good stability in alkaline electrolyte. This strategy for preparing functional materials by using nanowires as the growth modifiers has great potential for future application in the construction of various materials with hierarchical structures.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000478985400001	31295386

However, the high overpotential for traditional metal catalysts to drive oxygen evolution limits the conversion efficiency. Plasmonic metal-semiconductor systems can potentially overcome this problem, as hot electrons generated by localized surface plasmon resonance are rapidly injected into the semiconductor and hot holes are concentrated to oxidize water. The intermediates and pathways of such plasmon-induced water oxidation are currently unknown. Herein, taking Au-nanostructured TiO2 as a prototype, we investigated distinct spectral characteristics of water oxidation intermediates at electrochemical potentials close to the flat-band potential of TiO2 using in situ electrochemical surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Au-O stretching vibrations are attributed to the initial oxidized-state intermediate Au(OH)(3) at pH 0 or 13 and the highest-energy intermediate AuOOH at pH 7. The existence of AuOOH provides the first robust experimental evidence for the accelerated four-electron multistep reaction via plasmon-assisted water oxidation.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2380-8195			WOS:000526315900030

Although several in situ techniques are now available to track structural changes during electrocatalysis, especially of water oxidation, a direct observation, in real space, of morphological changes of nanostructured electrocatalysts is missing. Herein, we implement an in situ electrochemical Transmission Electron Microscopy (in situ EC-TEM) methodology for studying electrocatalysts of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during operation, by using model cobalt oxide Co3O4 nanoparticles. The observation conditions were optimized to mimic standard electrochemistry experiments in a regular electrochemical cell, allowing cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry to be performed in similar conditions in situ and ex situ. This in situ EC-TEM method enables us to observe the chemical, morphological, and structural evolutions occurring in the initial nanoparticle-based electrode exposed to different aqueous electrolytes and under OER conditions. The results show that surface amorphization occurs, yielding a nanometric cobalt (oxyhydr)oxide-like phase during OER. This process is irreversible and occurs to an extent that has not been described before. Furthermore, we show that the pH and counterions of the electrolytes impact this restructuration, shedding light on the materials properties in neutral phosphate electrolytes. In addition to the structural changes followed in situ during the electrochemical measurements, this study demonstrates that it is possible to rely on in situ electrochemical TEM to reveal processes in electrocatalysts while preserving a good correlation with ex situ regular electrochemistry.									77	2	0	0	5	0	77			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000492801600047	31584800

Using urea oxidation reaction (UOR) to replace OER has been a feasible and energy-saving approach because of its lower electrode potential. Furthermore, UOR is also an important process in wastewater treatment. This paper successfully synthesizes a high-performance bifunctional catalyst for urea electrolysis. The catalyst is nickel nitride bead-like nanospheres array supported on Ni foam (Ni3N/NF). Several characterization methods are used to analyze the catalyst's morphology, structure, and composition as well as catalytic activity/stability, including X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electrochemical methods (cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and CAM). A concurrent two-electrode electrolyzer (Ni3N/NF vertical bar vertical bar Ni3N/NF) is constructed and used to validate the catalyst performance, and the results show that the cell achieves 100 mA.cm(-2) at 1.42 V, while the cell voltage of Pt/C parallel to IrO2 is 1.60 V, indicating that the Ni3N/NF catalyst is superior to precious metals.									99	3	0	0	4	0	100			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000464769400013	30900444

Highly performant bimetallic Ni/Fe catalyst films with various atomic ratios have been prepared by magnetron sputtering in an oblique angle configuration (MS-OAD) and used as anodes for AEMWE. Electrocatalytic experiments in a small three-electrode cell and a thorough analysis of the electrode properties with various physico-chemical characterization tech-niques have been used to select the nanostructured anode catalyst which, depicting an optimized Ni/Fe ratio, presents the maximum activity for the oxygen evolution reaction. These anode layers are then scale-up for their integration in an AEMWE cell where the influence of assembly conditions and the effect of adding an ionomer to the anodes have been studied. The obtained results have demonstrated the outstanding properties of the fabri-cated bimetallic films in terms of activity, stability, and operation under ionomer-free conditions. Current density values around 400 and 600 mA cm(-2) at 40 degrees C and 60 degrees C (2.0 V), respectively, much higher than those obtained with pure Ni, were obtained with an optimized membrane electrode assembly. The high yield obtained with these electrodes gains further relevance when considering that the current yield per unit mass of the anodic active phase catalyst (i.e., 1086 mA mg(-1) at 2.0 V and 40 degrees C) is the highest among equivalent values reported in literature. The possibilities and prospects of the use of bimetallic catalyst films prepared by MS-OAD for AEMWE are discussed.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000784350600004

HER in alkaline media is imperative for the hydrogen supply in commercial applications. However, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been validated to be eminently propitious to acid HER, instead of alkaline solutions. It still remains challenging to design effective TMDs electrocatalysts towards alkaline HER rationally. This study gives a description of gearwheel-like WTe2 nanomaterials with induced anionic (Te) vacancies which affords an overpotential of 178 mV at current densities of 10 mA/cm(2) as well as a durable stability (with minor activity decay after the 15 h test) in alkaline HER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1452-3981			WOS:000826841100014

Herein, a unique vanadium-mediated space confined strategy is reported to construct a composite structure involving Co/Co9S8 nanoparticles anchored on Co-N-doped porous carbon (VCS@NC) as bifunctional electrocatalysts toward HER and ORR. Benefitting from the ultrafine nanostructure, abundant Co-N-x active sites, large specific surface area and defect-rich carbon framework, the resultant VCS@NC exhibits unexceptionable HER catalytic activity, needing extremely low HER overpotentials in pH-universal media (alkaline: 117 mV, acid: 178 mV, neutral: 210 mV) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), paralleling at least 100 h catalytic durability. Notably, the VCS@NC catalyst delivers high-efficiency ORR performance in alkaline solution, accompanied with a quite high half wave potential of 0.901 V, far overmatching the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Our research opens up novel insight into engineering highly-efficient multifunctional non-precious metal electrocatalysts by a metal-mediated space-confined strategy in energy storage and conversion system.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000697790900001	34549748

Here extensive periodic first-principles calculations integrated with modified-Poisson-Boltzmann electrostatics are utilized to reveal the physical origin of the high overpotential of the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on RuO2(110). By determining the surface phase diagram, exploring the possible reaction channels, and computing the Tafel lines, we are able to elucidate some long-standing puzzles on the OER kinetics from the atomic level. We show that OER occurs directly on an O-terminated surface phase above 1.58 V vs NHE, but indirectly on a OH/O mixed phase below 1.58 V by converting first the OH/O mixed phase to the O-terminated phase locally. The rate-determining step of OER involves an unusual water oxidation reaction following a Eley-Rideal-like mechanism, where a water molecule from solution breaks its OH bond over surface Os with concurrent new O-OH bond formation. The free energy barrier is 0.74 eV at 1.58 V, and it decreases linearly with the increase of potential above 1.58 V (a slope of 0.56). In contrast, the traditionally regarded surface oxygen coupling reaction with a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism is energetically less favored and its barrier is weakly affected by the potential. Fundamentally, we show that the empirical linear barrier similar to potential relation is caused by the linear structural response of the solvated transition state to the change of potential. Finally, the general strategy for finding better OER anode is also presented.									411	21	0	0	31	0	415			0002-7863			WOS:000285818700040	21133410

The electrocatalytic properties of NixCo2-xO4/C composites towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were studied using rotating ring-disk electrode (RDE) technique and Koutecky-Levich theory in 1 M, 3M, and 6 M KOH electrolytes. The results show that the synthesized spinel NixCo2-xO4 exhibits activities for both ORR and OER. The OER Tafel slope is around 60mVdec(-1) at a low overpotential, and the ORR process is dominated by a 4-electron transfer pathway. Cell test demonstrates that the ORR activity of non-carbon NixCo2-xO4 air electrode reached 56mA cm(-2) at a potential of 0.9V and the OER activity reached 62mA cm(-2) at a potential of 2.2V for the first cycle However, the ORR cycling property is not satisfying due to flooding issues. This can probably be solved by an advanced air electrode design.

Here, ultrathin tungsten-doped nickel iron layered double hydroxide (Ni-Fe-W LDH) nanosheets, which are composed of nanoparticles with size of 2 to 6 nanometers, have been directly grown on nickel foam (NF) using a facile and scalable water bath reaction. When applied as a catalyst for OER catalysis, this self-supported Ni-Fe-W LDH/NF shows superb OER activity, requiring low overpotentials of only 247 and 320 mV to attain current densities of 100 and 1000 mA cm(-2), respectively, with a small Tafel slope of 55 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. The high catalytic activity is attributed to the unique open porous structure, high density of crystalline-amorphous phase boundaries, abundant active sites, and enhanced conductivity resulting from the combination of W doping and Ni-Fe LDH. This work presents a general approach toward the large-scale fabrication of inexpensive trimetallic LDH-based OER electrocatalysts.									37	1	0	0	3	0	37			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000530495500056

Many in situ and ex situ analyses have been reported to address chemical species of reduction intermediate and products, whereas details of the dynamic Li-O-2 reaction have not as yet been fully unraveled. For this purpose, visual imaging can provide straightforward evidence, formation and decomposition of products, during the Li-O-2 electrochemical reaction. Here, we present real-time and in situ views of the Li-O-2 reaction using electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC-AFM). Details of the reaction process can be observed at nano-/micrometer scale on a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) electrode with lithium ion-containing tetraglyme, representative of the carbon cathode and ether-based electrolyte extensively employed in the Li-O-2 battery. Upon oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), rapid growth of nanoplates, having axial diameter of hundreds of nanometers, length of micrometers, and similar to 5 nm thickness, at a step edge of HOPG can be observed, which eventually forms a lithium peroxide (Li2O2) film. This Li2O2 film is decomposed during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), for which the decomposition potential is related to a thickness. There is no evidence of byproduct analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) after first reduction and oxidation reaction. However, further cycles provide unintended products such as lithium carbonate (Li2CO2), lithium acetate, and fluorine-related species with irregular morphology due to the degradation of HOPG electrode, tetraglyme, and lithium salt. These observations provide the first visualization of Li-O-2 reaction process and morphological information of Li2O2, which can allow one to build strategies to prepare the optimum conditions for the Li-O-2 battery.									88	7	0	0	3	0	91			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000322432400041	23808397

This enzymatic route is hindered by the requirement of a stoichiometric supply of auxiliary substrates for cofactor recycling and difficulties with supplying the necessary oxygen. The recombinant production of BVMO in cyanobacteria allows the substitution of auxiliary organic cosubstrates with water as an electron donor and the utilization of oxygen generated by photosynthetic water splitting. Herein, we report the identification of a BVMO from Burkholderia xenovorans (BVMOXeno) that exhibits higher reaction rates in comparison to currently identified BVMOs. We report a 10-fold increase in specific activity in comparison to cyclohexanone monooxygenase (CHMOAcineto) in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (25 vs 2.3 U g(DCW)(-1) at an optical density of OD750 = 10) and an initial rate of 3.7 +/- 0.2 mM h(-1). While the cells containing CHMOAcineto showed a considerable reduction of cyclohexanone to cyclohexanol, this unwanted side reaction was almost completely suppressed for BVMOXeno, which was attributed to the much faster lactone formation and a 10-fold lower KM value of BVMOXeno toward cyclohexanone. Furthermore, the whole-cell catalyst showed outstanding stereoselectivity. These results show that, despite the self-shading of the cells, high specific activities can be obtained at elevated cell densities and even further increased through manipulation of the photosynthetic electron transport chain (PETC). The obtained rates of up to 3.7 mM h-1 underline the usefulness of oxygenic cyanobacteria as a chassis for enzymatic oxidation reactions. The photosynthetic oxygen evolution can contribute to alleviating the highly problematic oxygen mass-transfer limitation of oxygendependent enzymatic processes.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000731123000001	35036041

Herein, a binder-free bifunctional porous HEA electrode has been designed and fabricated by selectively etching eutectic dual-phase microstructures. The AlCrFeCoNiW HEA consisting of FCC and ordered BCC phases was dealloyed with the aluminum-enriched BCC phase being removed effectively to construct a three-dimensional porous architecture. The porous HEA electrode exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution reaction activity (overpotential of 101 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)) and oxygen evolution reaction activity (overpotential of 270 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2)), along with outstanding stability under industrial conditions. The in situ electrochemical infrared spectra illustrate that the great electrocatalytic performance in alkaline electrolyte may be closely related to the enhanced interactions between the electrode surface and adsorbed water molecules. First-principles calculations based on density functional theory reveal an improvement in the intrinsic catalytic activity after the dealloying process. This work combines the concept of HEA with multiple active sites for catalysis and selective etching tuned by the eutectic microstructure, paving a new way for designing low-cost self-supporting electrodes for future sustainable energy applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000789962400001		
P	REDEY L I; GOURISHANKAR K								Control of direct electrolytic reduction of metal oxide or mixtures of metal oxides to metal or metals involves monitoring anode and cathode potentials compared to reference electrodes					US6540902-B1	US DEPT ENERGY																			NOVELTY - The anode potential compared to reference electrode (35) is monitored to prevent anode dissolution and gas evolution other than oxygen. Subsequently, a cathode potential compared to reference electrode (40) is monitored to prevent production of reductant metal from ions in electrolyte (15), to control direct electrolytic reduction of metal oxide or mixtures of metal oxides to metal or metals. USE - For controlling direct electrolytic reduction of metal oxide or mixtures of metal oxide, e.g. spent nuclear fuels, to metal or metals in electrochemical cell used for extraction of metals. ADVANTAGE - The direct electrolytic reduction of metal oxides or mixtures of metal oxides to corresponding metal or metals is controlled in a single step using a single vessel process which eliminates engineering complexities associated with handling and transfer of molten salts and metals and reduces the number of components associated with two-step process. Unwanted side reactions at cathode or anode are prevented by the use of one or more reference electrodes, to control electrode potential. Free-floating or excess reductant metal is not formed in the cell. Since the controlling method is a semi-continuous process, only periodic exchange of basket or pan is required. High purity metals are produced even with a starting mixture of impure metal oxides. Reduced level of dissolved oxide-ion concentration is maintained in the electrolyte to reduce oxides easily. The method is eco-friendly, since the by-product is oxygen. Spent nuclear fuels are processed with reduced capital expenditure. The non-consumable anodes are chemically and dimensionally stable in the electrolytic environment. A shroud is provided around each anode to retain and transport oxygen out of the cell, thereby preventing diffusion of oxygen to other cell locations where the oxygen result in corrosion of cell components or lowering of cell efficiency by recombining with reduced metal. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The non-consumable anode (17) and a cathode are contacted with a molten salt electrolyte (15) having mobile oxygen ions and reductant metal ions. Reference electrodes (35,40) are provided near the non-consumable anode and the cathode, respectively. A constant voltage is maintained across the anode and the cathode, or a constant current is passed between the anode and the cathode to reduce the metal oxide or oxide mixtures to the metal or metals by producing oxygen gas. An anode potential compared to the reference electrode (35) is monitored to prevent anode dissolution and gas evolution other than oxygen. A cathode potential compared to the reference electrode (40) is monitored to prevent production of reductant metal from ions in the electrolyte, to control direct electrolytic reduction of metal oxide or mixtures of metal oxides to the metal or metals.An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for method of electrochemically reducing metal oxide.

J	Guo, Wenlong; Lian, Xin								Kinetics mechanism insights into the oxygen evolution reaction on the (110) and (022) crystal facets of beta-Cu2V2O7								CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				10	15			5129	5135		10.1039/d0cy00959h				AUG 7 2020	2020	The sluggish kinetics for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) seriously limits the photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation performance of the monoclinic beta-Cu(2)V(2)O(7)which has been identified as a potential photoanode in a PEC cell. Among various strategies for improving the kinetics, tailoring the crystal facets of semiconductors is an effective one which has not been applied on beta-Cu(2)V(2)O(7)so far. We therefore study the OER kinetics mechanism on the (110) and (022) facets of beta-Cu(2)V(2)O(7)using the density functional theory (DFT). On both (110) and (022), the rate-limiting step is the dehydrogenation of the *OH group. The adsorbates (O and OH species) adjacent to the reaction sites are able to facilitate this elementary step. With and without the neighboring adsorbates, *OH dehydrogenation is more kinetically favorable on the (110) facet compared to the (022) surface. In addition, the dissociation of *OOH to form *OO is spontaneous and barrierless in all cases. The product O(2)is easier to desorb from the (110) facet than the (022) surface. Our results suggest that the (110) orientation is more active than (022) for the OER, which will be helpful for tailoring the crystal facets of beta-Cu(2)V(2)O(7)in experiments.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000556422000018

Directly identifying and monitoring these sites during a reaction should therefore provide insight that might aid the targeted development of heterogeneous catalysts and electrocatalysts (those that participate in electrochemical reactions) for practical applications. The invention of the scanning tunnelling microscope (STM)(1,2) and the electrochemical STM3,4 promised to deliver such imaging capabilities, and both have indeed contributed greatly to our atomistic understanding of heterogeneous catalysis(5-8). But although the STM has been used to probe and initiate surface reactions(9,10), and has even enabled local measurements of reactivity in some systems(11-13), it is not generally thought to be suited to the direct identification of catalytically active surface sites under reaction conditions. Here we demonstrate, however, that common STMs can readily map the catalytic activity of surfaces with high spatial resolution: we show that by monitoring relative changes in the tunnelling current noise, active sites can be distinguished in an almost quantitative fashion according to their ability to catalyse the hydrogen-evolution reaction or the oxygen-reduction reaction. These data allow us to evaluate directly the importance and relative contribution to overall catalyst activity of different defects and sites at the boundaries between two materials. With its ability to deliver such information and its ready applicability to different systems, we anticipate that our method will aid the rational design of heterogeneous catalysts.									124	7	0	0	10	0	126			0028-0836	1476-4687		WOS:000409388700035	28880284

Cobalt-based materials have been widely studied because of their promising activity and abundance. However, exposing more active sites for cobalt-based electrocatalysts with enhanced activity and durability still remains as a great challenge. Herein, we demonstrate that chlorine intercalated alpha-type cobalt hydroxide can be electrochemically etched to form a highly active OER catalyst, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an OER overpotential of similar to 320 mV. The improvement in the OER activity can be ascribed to the dechlorination induced defective structures and in situ formation of cobalt oxyhydroxide fragments as active sites via anodic polarization. Our findings suggest a novel strategy of electrochemical etching of chlorine containing hydroxide catalysts to obtain defective oxyhydroxides for continuous electrochemical water splitting.									98	2	0	0	3	0	99			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000378946700029

Herein, we decorated Ni0.85Se hollow nanospheres onto reduced graphene oxide (RGO) through a hydrothermal route, then annealed this composite at different temperatures (400 degrees C, NiSe2-400 and 450 degrees C, NiSe2-450) under argon atmosphere, yielding a kind of NiSe2/RGO composite catalysts. Positron annihilation spectra revealed two types of vacancies formed in this composite catalyst. We found that the NiSe2-400 catalyst with dual Ni-Se vacancies is able to catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) efficiently, needing a mere 241 mV overpotential at 10 mA center dot cm(-2). In addition, this catalyst exhibits outstanding stability. Computational studies show favorable energy barrier on NiSe2-400, enabling moderate OH(-)adsorption and O(2)desorption, which leads to the enhanced energetics for OER.									11	2	0	0	2	0	12			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000561979800006

We used a rotating ring disc (RRDE) assembly and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) in order to monitor the consumption or the production of species in the course of the electrode processes. By intercepting the intermediate of the electrochemical water oxidation with chemical reactions we demonstrate clearly, albeit indirectly, that in the water oxidation process at BDD above 2.5 V the first step is the formation of (OH)-O-center dot radicals. The electro-oxidation of CO to CO2 at BDD electrodes proceeds only via a first attack by (OH)-O-center dot radicals followed by a further electron transfer to the electrode. At potentials below the onset of oxygen evolution from water, H2O2 is oxidised by a direct electron transfer to the BDD electrode, while at higher potentials, two different reactions paths compete for the (OH)-O-center dot radicals formed in the first electron transfer from water: one, where these (OH)-O-center dot radicals react with each other followed by further electron transfers leading to O-2 on the one hand and one, where (OH)-O-center dot radicals react with other species like H2O2 or CO with subsequent electron transfers on the other hand.									33	0	0	0	12	0	33			1463-9076			WOS:000315649500020	23422949

Here, the reasonable strategy and synthesis of an inventive class of alloy@C materials from EMOFs via one-step pyrolysis was reported as the first example. The freshly progressive NiCo@C with a individual hierarchical structure, being composed of uniformly distributive metal alloy nanoparticles (MANPs) decorated by N-doped porous hollow carbon nanotubes (HCNTs), displayed the extraordinary bifunctional catalytic activity (oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions) than that of commercial precious-metal catalysts. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations revealed the vital role of NiCo alloy doping in adjusting both performances. Moreover, as an air electrode in Zn-air batteries, NiCo@C demonstrated a large peak power density (170 mW cm(-2)) and superior long-term stability over 600 cycles. In consideration of the expansive category of EMOFs and the governable fixation of single/multiple metal particles, this strategy gives evidence of a capacious scientific range.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000788220900004

However, explorations of specific interface structures for catalysts are still limited and challenging. Herein, a novel core-shell architecture comprising of Ru and FeRu hybrid enwrapped with a carbon shell anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon substrate (Ru-FeRu@C/NC) was constructed. Specifically, the interfacial electronic interaction between Ru and FeRu regulate the electron configuration and broaden the electron transfer pathway to boost its electrocatalytic performance. Particularly, Ru-FeRu@C/NC required ultralow overpotentials of 23 and 345 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2 for HER and OER, respectively, and a positive half-wave potential of 0.90 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for ORR. Furthermore, an electrocatalytic water splitting cell powered by a Zn-air battery was successfully fabricated using Ru-FeRu@C/NC as the "one-in-all" electrocatalyst. The present work paves the way for design and construction of efficient multifunctional electrocatalyst in energy conversion and storage.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000779966300001

An efficient and environmentally friendly hydrothermal method to prepare bimodal mesoporous undoped SnO2 with a very high surface area (>130 m(2) g(-1)) and a general deposition-precipitation method for the synthesis of well-dispersed Ni species on undoped SnO2 are reported. The powders were characterized by adsorption-desorption isotherms, TG-DTA, XRD, SEM, TEM, Raman, TPRH2, and XPS. The best NiSn composite generates, under certain experimental conditions, a very high TOF value of 1.14 s(-1) and a mass activity higher than 370 A g(-1), which are remarkable results considering the low amount of Ni deposited on the electrode (3.78 ng). Moreover, in 1 M NaOH electrolyte, this material produces more than 24 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential value of approximately +0.33 V, with only 5 wt % Ni species. This performance stems from the dual role of undoped SnO2, on the one hand, as a support for active and well-dispersed Ni species and on the other hand as an active player through the oxygen vacancies generated upon Ni deposition.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000529202100019	32216306

A potential alternative to the OER is hence required and is seen in the electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) as it offers concomitant value-added product generation from a cheap and abundant feedstock. Here, we show a facile solid-state synthesis method to obtain Ni-boride, a non-noble metal-based catalyst subsequently used in an in-depth study of the GOR product distribution as a function of key electrolysis parameters. Highly crystalline, mixed-phase Ni borides were obtained, and their synthesis was successfully optimised regarding GOR activity. Long-term chronoamperometry was conducted in a circular flow-through cell and samples were analysed by HPLC. It is shown that the formation of lactic acid, one of the most valuable GOR products, can be enhanced by optimising the electrolyte composition and the applied potential.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2196-0216			WOS:000674290100025

The synthesized core-shell nanowires with an average diameter of 50-100 nm manifest superior catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in Li-O-2 batteries with the charge voltage plateau reduced to similar to 3.8 V. An outstanding performance of cycling stability was also achieved with a cutoff specific capacity of 1000 milliampere hour per gram over 40 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g(-1). The excellent electrochemical properties of Fe@Fe2O3 as an O-2 electrode are ascribed to the high surface area of the nanowires' structure and high electron conductivity.

In order to provide insight into this phenomenon, the behavior of an isolated bubble rising in molten glass is examined both experimentally and numerically.An experimental procedure developed specifically to observe, in situ, a rising bubble is described. Two soda-lime-silica compositions are tested, with low and high iron content, respectively.The numerical model used to describe bubble shrinkage is based on the results recently proposed in Pigeonneau (2009). A specific mass transfer coefficient is used for oxygen where the oxidation-reduction reaction of iron oxides is taken into account.A comparison between the experimental and numerical results shows the importance of the oxidation-reduction reaction of iron in the mass transfer of oxygen. The shrinkage rate of a pure O-2 bubble is enhanced with reduced molten glass iron content. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The deposition method is applicable to a wide range of photoanodes and catalytic films as thin as a few nanometers can be easily grown. The Ni: FeOOH films with 5-20% Ni content reach 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M NaOH at an overpotential ranging from 420-460 mV initially, and improve with anodization at 10 mA cm(-2) to below 400 mV.

Herein, we developed three donor-acceptor (D-A) type thiophene-containing narrow-band-gap conjugated polymers with pyrene as a donor and different fused-thiophene derivatives as acceptors via direct C-H arylation coupling polymerization. It was found that the band gap of the polymers can be tuned by adjusting the number of the fused-thiophene rings. The visible light absorption range can be extended by increasing the number of the thiophene rings, the planar molecular structure for both donor and acceptor units facilitates the charge transmission along the polymer skeleton, and the D-A type polymer structure promotes the dissociation of photo-induced electrons and holes. As a result, a high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 33.07 mmolh(-1) g(-1) was obtained by PyTP-2 with an optimized molecular structure under visible light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm) without the aid of Pt co-catalyst. In addition, PyTP-2 also shows a photocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution with an average oxygen evolution rate of 58.37 mu molh(-1) g(-1).									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000692986100001

Here, the authors discuss self-healing catalysis as a new tool in the design of stable and functionally active catalysts in acidic to basic solutions, and a variety of water sourcesElectrochemical and photoelectrochemical water splitting offers a scalable approach to producing hydrogen from renewable sources for sustainable energy storage. Depending on the applications, oxygen evolution catalysts (OECs) may perform water splitting under a variety of conditions. However, low stability and/or activity present challenges to the design of OECs, prompting the design of self-healing OECs composed of earth-abundant first-row transition metal oxides.

In this work, unique peapod-like Cu2S/C exhibiting superb electrocatalytic performance toward OER is successfully synthesized, by employing Cu(OH)(2) nanorods as the template and nontoxic glucose as the carbon source and then annealing with sublimed sulfur. It can be seen that this work explores a new application area for Cu2S. More precisely, the novel morphology contributes to increasing the electrochemical active surface area effectively and promoting contact between the Cu2S nanoparticles and the electrolyte. During electrochemical measurements, the peapod-like Cu2S/C shows enhanced electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential of 401 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 52 mV dec(-1). More importantly, our material is able to maintain stability for at least 8 h at constant potential and the current loss is negligible after 2000 cycles. Obviously, these striking properties fully demonstrate that the peapod-like Cu2S/C as an efficient catalyst shows great promise for OER.									18	1	0	0	0	0	18			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000406265700002	28617247

Efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and overall water splitting are highly desired with low overpotentials to promote the industrial applications of energy conversion and devices. 2D MOF nanostructures provide long-term stability and high electrical conductivity to enhance catalyst activity and durability. This review briefly summarizes the synthesis and electrocatalytic applications of 2D MOF for HER/OER/water splitting. More attention is focused on the synthetic strategies of 2D MOF and their derivatives. The catalytic performance and superior properties of these materials are highlighted. The outperformance of these materials originates from the rational design, myriad of abundant active sites, and atomic-level thickness. The current and future challenges in this field and the scientific perspectives to overcome these challenges are highlighted. It is suggested that the construction of 2D MOF nanostructures can develop a state-of-the-art electrocatalyst in energy and environmental division.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				2688-4062		WOS:000854304100001

It has been regarded as a promising candidate in electrical device since 2014 due to its high carrier mobility and controllable band gap, especially in the application of water splitting electrocatalysis. However, the low intrinsic activity and weak stability of low-dimensional BP severely hinder its further application as efficient electrocatalyst. To improve the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and overall water splitting activity of low-dimensional BP, many facile methods have been developed and explored for preparation of BP-based activated catalysts. In this regards, certain strategies have been tried to overcome their weaknesses of intrinsic activity and stability, including metal/nonmetal doping, building of heterostructure, and covalent functionalization. This work discusses the promotion strategies of high-efficient electrocatalysts for HER/OER and overall water splitting based on low-dimensional BP materials, providing an effective orientation of development and practical application of low-dimensional BP-based materials. Finally, a comment is also made on the recent developments, future outlook and challenges ahead in BP-based electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2213-2929	2213-3437		WOS:000812983500003

Herein, motivated by the high activity of OER catalyst on water dissociation that is the rate-determining step of alkaline HER, a bifunctional catalyst of metallic nickel-decorated transition metal oxide nanosheets vertically grown on ceria film (ceria/NiTMO) is synthesized by composition controlling and surface engineering. Because of the idealized electronic structure of the active centers and the abundance of such sites, as well as a synergistic effect between the carbon cloth/ceria film and the in situ formed TMO/Ni nanoparticles, the as-synthesized ceria/NiTMO exhibited long-time stability and a low cell voltage of 1.58 V at 10 mA/cm(2) when applied as both the cathode and anode in alkaline solutions. Moreover, it is the first time that pH independent four-proton-coupled-electron-transfer processes and multiple adsorption desorption processes were found to occur at the interfaces of ceria/TMO and Ni/TMO in a single catalyst for catalyzing OER and HER, respectively.									106	5	0	0	1	0	107			2380-8195			WOS:000425560900005

A crucial question to solve for the progress of artificial photosynthesis is to understand the influential interactions during water oxidation in PSII. We study the principles of interatomic electron transfer steps in OER, with emphasis on exchange interactions, revealing the influence of delocalizing ferromagnetic spin potentials during the catalytic process. The OEC is found to be an exchange coupled mixed-valence electron-spin acceptor where its orbital physics determine the unique activity of PSII. The two unpaired electrons needed in the triplet O-2 molecule interact with the high spin state of the catalyst via exchange interactions; the optimal ferromagnetic catalyst and the resulting radical intermediates are spin paired. As a result, the active center of the CaMn4O5 cofactor, stimulated by the driving potential provided by photons, works as a spin valve to accelerate the formation and release of O-2 from diamagnetic H2O.									31	1	0	0	5	0	31			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000416496400032	29064697

These metallicity-dependent yields represent an important improvement in the chemical evolution of galaxies, but there are still uncertainties in the stellar evolution which prevent completely satisfactory results. From the comparison of the model predictions with the corresponding observational constraints, we find that Maeder's nucleosynthesis reproduces the oxygen and carbon abundances and provides consistent Delta Y/Delta(O/H) ratios if a significant amount of gas is accreted by the galactic disc during its whole lifetime. The lower mass limit for the black hole formation (M(bh)) must be larger than 22.5 M(circle dot) to avoid oxygen underproduction.									32	1	0	0	0	0	32			0035-8711			WOS:A1995QP14900026

Herein, we report a novel and facile strategy of synthesizing three-dimensional porous carbon network by polymer-assisted molding strategy. The porous carbon framework with Co-CoF2 and carbon nanotubes (PCF@CCFCNT) was directly obtained by the calcination, in which Co-CoF2 heterojunctions uniformly dispersed in the interconnected holes. Benefiting from the special hierarchical porous morphology, the dual-function catalytic activity of Co-CoF2 heterojunctions and existence of Co-N-x species, the as-obtained PCF@CCFCNT composites exhibit excellent performance in the oxygen evolution reaction (eta = 300 mV@10 mA cm(-2)), as well as outstanding oxygen reduction reaction performance in alkaline medium (E-1/2 = 0.852 V, vs RHE). Moreover, as an air electrode in Zn-air batteries (ZABs), PCF@CCFCNT demonstrates a large peak power density of 184 mW cm(-2) and superior long-term stability, which is much more stable than the one consisting of commercial Pt/C. This finding not only shows a simple composite design to achieve high-performance ZABs but also may stimulate the rapid development of 3D hierarchical porous electrocatalysts for advanced energy technologies.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773003700001

The phase structure, surface morphology, and microstructure of the oxide layer were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Electrocatalytic activity and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics on these electrodes in 1.0 mol.dm(-3) KOH solution were studied by recording open-circuit potential, cyclic voltammetry, and polarisation curves. The results showed that the appropriate content of CeO2 could reduce the grain size and increase active surface area. The electrocatalytic activity shows a strong dependence on the CeO2 content in the film. Catalytic performance of mixed oxide electrodes with 40 mol %CeO2 was the best, with the greatest voltammetric charge, 86.23 mC.cm(-2), and the smallest apparent activation energy for OER at 0.60 V was 22.76 kJ.mol(-1).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1687-4110	1687-4129		WOS:000292402700001

However, the sluggish oxygen evolution kinetics makes this process vulnerable as it requires relatively high overpotentials. Hence, significantly effective electrocatalysts are necessary to access the water-oxidation process at a low overpotential to make this process industrially viable. Therefore, in order to reduce the energy barrier, we developed bimetallic CoSe2-FeSe2 heteronanoparticles along the carbon nanotube network (CoSe2-FeSe2/CNT) via a facile selenization strategy. Due to the unique assembly of highly conductive nanoparticles along the CNT network, the CoSe2-FeSe2/CNT displays an exceptionally good oxygen evolution (OER) activity; it requires 248 mV overpotential to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(10)) with an ultra-low Tafel slope of 36 mV dec(-1) and displays an overpotential of 1.59 V (eta(10)) in the full water-splitting catalysis with the commercial Pt/C cathode. The high OER activity of CoSe2-FeSe2/CNT over the monometallic CoSe2/CNT and FeSe2/CNT electrocatalysts approve the synergistic interactions. Therefore, the superior performance is possibly ascribed to the unique porous nanoarchitecture and the strong coupling interactions between CoSe2 and FeSe2 heteronanoparticles on the conductive network. This study introduces an innovative approach to rationally design and fabricate cost-effective and highly proficient electrocatalysts for boosted OER performance.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000652246000001	34013941

It was proved that the CO2, CO, and H-2 gases are released as a result of electrolyte decomposition. And it shows that the CO and H-2 gases evolution is a direct consequence of the electrochemical reaction of electrolyte decomposition, while the CO2 generation is a consequence of the additional chemical reaction of interaction between the O-2 released from the cathode atomic lattice oxygen and CO released from the same place on the cathode (appearing because of the electrolyte decomposition). That is why at the same electrochemical reaction of electrolyte decomposition, the ratio CO2/CO varies in the wide range from 0.82 to 2.42 depending on cycling conditions (temperature and cutoff voltage). It was proved that a potential-independent H-2 evolution is a consequence of its adsorption in pores of powdered graphite on anode. There was proposed the mechanism of the electrolyte decomposition and the gases evolution in lithium-ion cells at their cycling, which corresponds quantitatively to all obtained experimental results.

Deposited at 12 K under ultra-high vacuum conditions (UHV), the irradiated condensates were monitored on-line and in situ in the solid-state by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), revealing the formation of ozone (O-3) in irradiated oxygen ice; and ozone, carbon monoxide (CO), and cyclic carbon trioxide (c-CO3) in irradiated carbon dioxide. In addition to these irradiation products, evolution of gas-phase molecular hydrogen (H-2), atomic helium (He) and molecular oxygen (O-2) were identified in the subliming oxygen and carbon dioxide condensates by quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS). Temporal abundances of the oxygen and carbon dioxide precursors and the observed molecular products were compiled over the irradiation period to develop reaction schemes unfolding in the ices. These reactions were observed to be dependent on the generation of atomic oxygen (O) by the homolytic dissociation of molecular oxygen induced by electronic, S-e, and nuclear, S-n, interaction with the impinging ions. In addition, the destruction of the ozone and carbon trioxide products back to the molecular oxygen and carbon dioxide precursors was promoted over an extended period of ion bombardment. Finally, destruction and formation yields were calculated and compared between irradiation sources (including 5 keV electrons) which showed a surprising correlation between the molecular yields (similar to 10(-3)-10(-4) molecules eV(-1)) created by H+ and He+ impacts. However, energy transfer by isoenergetic, fast electrons typically generated ten times more product molecules per electron volt (similar to 10(-2)-10(-3) molecules eV(-1)) than exposure to the ions. Implications of these findings to Solar System chemistry are also discussed.									21	1	0	0	1	0	22			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000290224900049	21483931

Herein, Th-MOF-supported semirigid single-metal-site catalysts of MCl2@Th-BPYDC (M = Cu, Co, Ni) were prepared by postmetalation of a bipyridyl Th-MOF (Th-BPYDC) crystal toward an acidic OER. Impressively, the structure of the anchoring single-metal site can be well resolved by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, giving a near-square-planar MN(2)Cl(2 )coordination geometry, indicative of its potential as a double-accessible open-metal site and an unusual semirigid character because of two rotatable charge-balance Cl- anions. The optimal CoCl2@Th-BPYDC not only discloses an outstanding acidic OER activity comparable to commercial IrO2 but also exhibits a high electrocatalytic stability, which is attributed to the combination of the robust rigid Th-BPYDC framework, the strong chelating coordination between single-metal-site with bipyridine N in BPYDC ligand, and an accessible open single-metal site. More importantly, as unveiled by theoretical calculations and kinetic analysis, the single-metal-site catalysts show an unusual semirigid character during the OER process, totally different from the well-known MN4 rigid single-site catalysts since Cl atoms are found to rotate freely to provide suitable geometric space when attaching and activating reaction intermediates, thus largely reducing the reaction energy barrier.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000838222100001

Herein we report a high-performance bifunctional oxygen catalyst of alpha-MnO2 nanowires synthesized using ionic liquid (IL) as the structure-directing agent. While increasing the IL addition enables to gradually transform the reaction products from beta-MnO2 nanorods to alpha-MnO2 nanowires, increasing the reaction time enables to further improve their crystallinity. For both OER and ORR activities, the same trend was found following beta-MnO2 nanorods < alpha-MnO2 nanowires with low crystallinity < alpha-MnO2 nanowires with high crystallinity, corroborating the view that the crystallographic structure is more determinative on the electrocatalytic behaviour of MnO2 than other contributors such as surface area. The superior OER and ORR activities of the alpha-MnO2 nanowires are mainly attributed to its large K+-embedded tunnel structure and high Mn-III content accompanied with ample oxygen vacancies. Liquid and solid-state rechargeable Zn-air batteries fabricated using the alpha-MnO2 nanowires demonstrate a high open-circuit potential of 1.51 V, a maximal power density of 166 mW cm(-2), superior cycling stability, as well as great potential in powering portable electronics.									56	2	0	0	2	0	56			2405-8297			WOS:000495867200024

We here report hierarchical porous Fe3O4/Co3S4 composite nanosheets for a highly efficient electrocatalytic OER in alkaline electrolytes. The preparation of the composite involves a hydrothermal synthesis and a subsequent sulfurization process. The prepared porous Fe3O4/Co3S4 composite shows strong synergetic coupling effects, facilitating active site exposure, and facile charge transfer. Remarkably, Fe3O4/Co3S4 nanosheets afforded an electrocatalytic OER with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low potential of 1.50 V and a small Tafel slope of about 56 mV dec(-1). This indicates that the composite of porous Fe3O4/Co3S4 nanosheets is promising as an efficient electrocatalyst for the OER that can be used in the fields of fuel cells, metal-air batteries and water splitting for hydrogen production.									116	2	0	0	6	0	117			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000401316100047		
J	Batool, Mariam; Waseem, Amir; Nadeem, Muhammad Arif								Three-dimensional Ni4O4-cubane metal-organic framework as a high-performance electrocatalyst for urea oxidation								RSC ADVANCES				12	44			28388	28394		10.1039/d2ra05145a				OCT 4 2022	2022	The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is considered to be a replacement of the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in overall water-splitting. A three-dimensional (3D) nickel-containing metal-organic framework {[Ni-2(II)(pdaa)(OH)(2)(H2O)](n) (MOF 1) (where, H(2)pdaa = 1,4-phenylene diacetic acid) was investigated as a robust and highly efficient electrocatalyst for the UOR. MOF 1 comprised 1D nickel(ii) chains crosslinked through Ni4O4 cubane units to form a 3D extended network. Dangling NiMIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSISOH- groups were exposed in the MOF 1 structure, and could act as active catalytic centers for the UOR. MOF 1 required a very small onset potential of 1.18 V for urea oxidation in KOH (1 M) and urea (0.33 M) and had a low Tafel slope of 38.8 mV dec(-1) (in contrast to 1.84 V for the oxygen evolution reaction). The overpotential required to attain a catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) was 1.24 V, which is much lower than that for many materials. Controlled potential electrolysis, powder X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy affirmed the physicochemical integrity of the catalyst over a 17 h test reaction. This work not only addresses the problem of urea contamination, it also helps to utilize it in an energy-conversion process.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2046-2069		WOS:000864269000001	36320492

However, this reaction is highly limited by the low performance of existing electrocatalysts. Herein, we report a novel yet effective catalyst that comprises nonprecious trimetallic (Ni, Fe, and Co) nanoalloy as a core in a phosphidated nitrogen-doped carbon shell (referred to as sample P-NiFeCo/NC) for efficient electro-oxidation of kraft lignin at different temperatures in alkaline medium. The as-synthesized catalyst electro-oxidizes lignin only at 0.2 V versus Hg/HgO, which is almost three times less positive potential than in the conventional oxygen evolution reaction (0.59 V versus Hg/HgO) at 6.4 mA/cm(2) in 1 M KOH. The catalyst demonstrates a turnover frequency (TOF) three to five times greater in lignin containing 1 M KOH than that of pure 1 M KOH. More importantly, the catalyst P-NiFeCo/NC shows theoretical hydrogen production of about 0.37 mu moles/min in the presence of lignin, much higher than that in pure 1 M KOH (0.0078 mu moles/min). Thus, this work verifies the benefit of the NiFeCo nanoalloy incorporated in carbon matrix, providing the way to realize a highly active catalyst for the electro-oxidation of kraft lignin.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4360		WOS:000859661800001	36145928

The process in the absence of the oxalate nanorods yields Cu2O at a much higher temperature of 850 degrees C. The Cu2O synthesized at lower temperature (350 degrees C) has smaller particles than Cu2O synthesized at 850 degrees C. We explored these nanomaterials as electrocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution which are highly desirable for renewable and clean energy applications. Electrochemical studies such as the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction (HER & OER) were carried out on glassy carbon as well as on platinum as the working electrode in KOH solution. Cu2O synthesized at lower temperature (350 degrees C) has 14 times higher current density during HER and 2 times higher current density during OER. These electrocatalysts were stable for 50 cycles. However, the Cu2O synthesized at higher temperature (850 degrees C) showed very efficient (similar to 98%) degradation of methylene blue (MB) in 120 min and the catalyst is stable up to the 4th cycle whereas Cu2O (350 degrees C) shows only 40% degradation.									46	0	0	0	0	0	46				2046-2069		WOS:000332470000069		
J	Liu, Qinghua; Zhao, Hui; Jiang, Meng; Kang, Qing; Zhou, Wei; Wang, Pengcheng; Zhou, Feimeng					Liu, Qinghua/0000-0002-3687-6405			Boron enhances oxygen evolution reaction activity over Ni foam-supported iron boride nanowires								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				8	27			13638	13645		10.1039/c9ta14256h				JUL 21 2020	2020	Transition metal borides are one of the most promising electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but the precise role of boron is still not understood. Herein, we demonstrate experimentally and computationally that boron facilitates OER by modulating the interaction energies of the reaction intermediates. Through a simple chemical reduction in an externally applied magnetic field, one-dimensional (1D) Fe2B nanowires (NWs) can be directly deposited onto a three-dimensional (3D) nickel foam (NF). OER in alkaline solution converts interconnected Fe2B NWs to a thicker and larger network of metaborate- and FeOOH-covered Fe2B NWs. The Fe2B NWs/NF-based catalyst lowers the overpotential to 276 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)(normalized to the electrochemical surface area). This intrinsic catalytic activity ranks top among the transition-metal-based compounds. This catalyst is highly stable, showing only 6 mV change in overpotential over continuous testing for 11 h. Such high efficiency is mainly attributed to the catalyst's unique electronic structure, accelerated charge transport, and hydrophilic surface. The remarkable stability stems from the increase in corrosion resistance by the metaborate species in the catalyst.									30	3	0	0	1	0	32			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000548452100019

However, catalysts that simultaneously take into account activity and stability are generally difficult to fabricate. Herein, heterogeneous NiFex/NiFe2O4 nanoflowers were successfully embedded in an N-doped graphitic carbon (NC) matrix with a porous 3D superstructure in a simple partial oxidation process after the pyrolysis of a metal-organic framework (MOF). The optimized heterogeneous NiFex/NiFe2O4@NC nanoflower catalyst exhibited high OER performance in terms of its low overpotential of 262 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and outstanding long-term stability (for 150 h) in 1 M KOH as the electrolyte, which are mainly ascribable to its intrinsic heterogeneous and 3D porous structure. First-principles computations confirmed that NiFex/NiFe2O4@NC requires a lower overpotential to promote OER, compared with those of single-component catalysts, which further highlights that this material is a promising low-cost and highly efficient OER electrocatalyst candidate.									49	1	0	0	5	0	49			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000489345300028

Herein, we demonstrate a composite electrode obtained by anchoring polyhedral Fe3O4 particles on nickel foam (NF) is a highly active catalyst for OER. Notably, this catalyst was able to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 251 and 310 mV. Also, Fe3O4-NF displayed a low Tafel slope of 45 mV dec(-1). Moreover, at an overpotential of 300 mV Fe3O4-NF showed a turnover frequency (TOF) of 3.12 x 10(-3) s(-1) suggesting that Fe3O4-NF has a high intrinsic catalytic activity which is on par with commercial RuO2 catalyst. Furthermore, due to the close contact and strong adhesion between Fe3O4 and NF, the Fe3O4-NF displayed good stability during OER. The post-activity characterizations indicate that iron oxyhydroxide (Fe(O)OH) formed due to in-situ oxidation of Fe3O4 surface functions as the active catalytic phase whereas, bulk of the catalyst acts as a conducting scaffold.

It is found that the circuit can be implemented with equal probability as a capacitive circuit with physically different current carriers and as an inductive circuit in water and dilute aqueous solutions of oxygen-containing electrolytes. The occurrence of an inductive resistance is caused by the presence of particles with intrinsic magnetic moment, i.e., reactive oxygen species. The frequency ranges of possible pulse energy transformation in an electrochemical system that contains oxygenated water are shown. In the absence of oxygen, this circuit is not implemented.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1068-3755	1934-8002		WOS:000304444900014

Here, authors find cobalt to promote the self-healing of leached iron centers in borate-intercalated nickel-iron-cobalt oxyhydroxides.While self-healing is considered a promising strategy to achieve long-term stability for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, this strategy remains a challenge for OER catalysts working in highly alkaline conditions. The self-healing of the OER-active nickel iron layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDH) has not been successful due to irreversible leaching of Fe catalytic centers. Here, we investigate the introduction of cobalt (Co) into the NiFe-LDH as a promoter for in situ Fe redeposition. An active borate-intercalated NiCoFe-LDH catalyst is synthesized using electrodeposition and shows no degradation after OER tests at 10 mA cm(-2) at pH 14 for 1000 h, demonstrating its self-healing ability under harsh OER conditions. Importantly, the presence of both ferrous ions and borate ions in the electrolyte is found to be crucial to the catalyst's self-healing. Furthermore, the implementation of this catalyst in photoelectrochemical devices is demonstrated with an integrated silicon photoanode. The self-healing mechanism leads to a self-limiting catalyst thickness, which is ideal for integration with photoelectrodes since redeposition is not accompanied by increased parasitic light absorption.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15				2041-1723		WOS:000707028100020	34645825

The SiOx thin layer coated on Ti-doped porous hematite induces preferential deposition of the Ti-FeOOH co-catalyst on the inner pores of Ti-PH, which enhances oxygen evolution reaction performance without interrupting the absorption of light by hematite. The photocurrent density of Ti-FeOOH/Ti-PH is 4.06 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE, 3.4 times higher than that of conventional worm-like hematite, with excellent long-termstability for 36 h. This represents the state-of-the-art performance among hematite-based systems with the exception of very few studies that used precious materials. Importantly, the proposed photoanode can be fabricated by a simple and cost-efficient solution-based method, i.e. with cheap precursors and without any specific equipment.									32	3	0	0	2	0	32			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000390433700007

In this scheme, either the bare surface without O and OH decoration or a decorated phase chosen from a surface Pourbaix diagram is employed as a starting point in a four-electron reaction loop (FERL) to describe the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process. The electrode potential that makes every step of this FERL exothermic is defined as the thermodynamic overpotential (eta(OER)(td)) of the OER reaction and is often compared with the experimental overpotential. In this study, we point out that for complex systems where each reaction site can bind multiple species, this widely used scheme could lead to wrong eta(OER)(td). To yield the correct reaction path and eta(OER)(td), one needs to extend the CHE scheme to a full Gibbs free energy landscape scheme, where all of the intermediate states and their possible transitions are laid out and considered. The correct criterion for eta(OER)(td) should not be "there is no trapped intermediate state (TIS) for any single FERL", rather "there is no TIS for the whole reaction landscape". Using transition metal-doped graphene-nitrogen (TMN(4)Gra) (TM = Fe and Co) as examples, we show that these two approaches yield different results.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000547461000020	32520545

IrO2 on boron-doped reduced graphene oxide (B-rGO) is synthesized via sequential steps of pyrolysis to prepare B-rGO and a hydrothermal method for modification of B-rGO with IrO2 nps. With 2 wt% boron doping in graphene, a 0.10 V decrease in the OER onset potential is observed for IrO2 catalysts on B-rGO (IrO2-B-rGO). The Tafel slope for the OER on B-rGO is estimated to be 124.8 mV dec(-1), which is lower than that on IrO2-rGO and suggests strong adsorption of intermediates such as OH on the IrO2 surface by the B-doping of graphene in acidic solution. In this article, we demonstrate the effect of boron doping on the electronic structure modification of the IrO2 nps, which is expected to generate more electrocatalytic centers and enhance the catalytic activity.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000575019100013

While aqueous solutions have some desirable properties as electrolyte solutions, one drawback is the narrow potential window of water due to the electrolysis reactions of water (oxygen/hydrogen evolution reaction, OER/HER). Recently, it has been reported that the potential windows were expanded in concentrated electrolyte solutions. In this study, we investigated the potential windows in aqueous concentrated electrolyte solutions with various salts at different concentrations. A neutral pH solution with the lowest water concentration showed the largest potential window, and the potential windows were not affected by the electrolyte salts. In addition, we observed an asymmetric expansion of potential windows: the upper potential limits were shifted more than the lower limits. This can be explained by the local pH change in the vicinity of electrodes caused by OER/HER and the decrease in the rate of OER due to the reduced water concentrations. (c) The Author(s) 2018.

Widely used Ir-based catalysts suffer from insufficient activity, while more active Ru-based catalysts tend to dissolve under OER conditions. This has been associated with the participation of lattice oxygen (lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM)), which may lead to the collapse of the crystal structure and accelerate the leaching of active Ru species, leading to low operating stability. Here we develop Sr-Ru-Ir ternary oxide electrocatalysts that achieve high OER activity and stability in acidic electrolyte. The catalysts achieve an overpotential of 190 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and the overpotential remains below 225 mV following 1,500 h of operation. X-ray absorption spectroscopy and O-18 isotope-labeled online mass spectroscopy studies reveal that the participation of lattice oxygen during OER was suppressed by interactions in the Ru-O-Ir local structure, offering a picture of how stability was improved. The electronic structure of active Ru sites was modulated by Sr and Ir, optimizing the binding energetics of OER oxo-intermediates.									53	2	0	0	1	0	53			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000648704100023	33891414

A strategy is designed to avoid the agglomeration of metal compound during the pyrolysis of precursor. MgO template is introduced into a 1-10-phenanthroline-iron (II) precursor to promote the evolution of Fe-Nx active sites while avoiding the formation of inactive species. The template also contributes to the formation of micro/mesoporous structure. The as-prepared catalyst shows good performance in half-cell test with half-wave potential of 0.80 V in acidic media.

To our knowledge, for the first time, we report a designable synthesis of three-dimensional (3D) and mesoporous Co3N@amorphous N-doped carbon (AN-C) nanocubes (NCs) with well-controlled open-framework structures via monodispersed Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) Prussian blue analogue (PBA) NC precursors using in situ nitridation and calcination processes. Co3N@AN-C NCs (2 h) demonstrate better OER activity with a remarkably low Tafel plot (69.6 mV.dec(-1)), low overpotential of 280 mV at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2). Additionally, excellent cycling stability in alkaline electrolytes was exhibited without morphological changes and voltage elevations, superior to most reported hierarchical structures of transition-metal nitride particles. The presented strategy for synergy effects of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-derived transition-metal nitrides-carbon hybrid nanostructures provides prospects for developing high-performance and advanced electrocatalyst materials.									75	8	0	0	4	0	76			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000473174000011

Lumped compositions, molecular weight and reductance degree of cellular protein, monoclonal antibody, biomass and amino acid consumption (excluding glutamine and alanine) are found to be relatively constant for different hybridoma cell lines and may be used as regularities. The calculated rates of oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide evolution agree well with experimental values of several different cultures reported in the literature.

Despite the recent progress in the synthesis of this class of nanomaterials, hollow nanostructures with tunable compositions and controlled morphologies have rarely been reported. Here, we report a facile synthetic route to a series of compositionally tunable, hollow mixed metal sulphide (CoxNiySz) octahedral nanocages. The sulfidation of CoO octahedral nanoparticles generates CoO@CoxSy core-shell octahedra, and the in situ etching of the CoO core and annealing yield Co9S8 (pentlandite) octahedral nanocages (ONC). The addition of a Ni precursor during the etching/annealing process of CoO@CoxSy core-shell octahedra progressively yields hollow ONC structures of Co9-xNixS8, Ni9S8, Ni9S8/beta-NiS, and Ni3S2/beta-NiS via cation exchange reactions. Mixed cobalt/nickel sulphide, Co9-xNixS8 ONC, shows superior oxygen evolution reaction activity to monometallic sulphide ONC structures, demonstrating the synergy between different metal species.									40	1	0	0	1	0	40			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000413905200019	28975945

However, in this study hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and corrosion reaction of OH ions are found to be another two important factors determining the fate of coated resistors. When temperature effects can be neglected, corrosion resulted from OH ions generated in HER may be the major reason of polymer degradation, the mechanism of which is discussed based on the polymer films mainly formed by phenolic and epoxy resins.

Herein, a CoNi nano-alloys modified yolk-shell carbon cage (CoNi/NC-YS) catalyst was synthesized through a green synthesis method, which shows an outstanding OER activity with a low overpotential of 292 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2), and a robust OER catalytic stability. The experimental and density functional theory (DFT) results demonstrate that the hydrophilic yolk-shell CoNi/NC-YS catalyst with large specific area contributes to exposing more active sites, and increases the reaction contact area between catalysts and electrolyte. Meanwhile, CoNi nano-alloys can regulate the electronic configuration of CoNi/NC-YS catalyst and optimize Gibbs free energies for water adsorption, accelerating OER process in alkaline media and showing an outstanding OER performance. This work can provide a low-cost and green strategy to construct nano-alloys modified yolk-shell OER catalysts for renewable energy systems.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000809946800003

Furthermore, the formation mechanism and microstructure evolution of Ba2Ti9O20 ceramics prepared by reaction sintering method were investigated. The formation behavior of Ba2Ti9O20 phase was analyzed from the perspective of diffusion, where the reaction activation energy required for the process was calculated to be about 386.17kJ/mol. Combined with the scanning electron microscopy and the energy dispersive spectrometer, it was revealed that the pores on Ba2Ti9O20 grains in the process of reaction sintering might be caused by the absence of oxygen element. Meanwhile, the reason for the roughness of ceramic surface was that the local inhomogeneous distribution of barium on the surface of Ba2Ti9O20 grain leaded to the enrichment of titanium.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000486752000001

The properties of the pressed electrodes and the kinetic parameters of the HER were determined. The constant phase element model adequately describes the a.c. behaviour of these electrodes. It was found that the HER proceeds through the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. An increase in catalytic properties was observed for materials doped with Rh, Ru and Co.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			0021-891X			WOS:A1994PX57500011

Even though recent studies are mainly focused on atomically thin nanomaterials with layered structures due to their easy preparation and characterization, the investigation of non-layered nanomaterials is also proceeding as new types of ultrathin nanostructures are constantly being created, such as metals, metal oxides, metal chalcogenides, some transition metal dichalcogenides, and perovskites. Here in this review, we comprehensively summarize the preparation methods for atomically thin non-layered nanomaterials, study their exotic electronic structures, introduce electronic-structure manipulation strategies, and provide an overview of their applications in energy storage and conversion, with particular emphasis on lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, catalysis of hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, CO2 reduction, CO oxidation reactions, etc. The central theme of this review is to provide correlation among the materials synthesis, structural and electronic properties, and their major applications. Finally, based on current research progress, we propose future directions yet to be explored for enhanced properties and novel functionalities in practical applications.									120	6	0	0	4	0	120			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000417020300012	29039859

To realize the practical applications of HER, it is necessary to develop cost-effective, high-activity electrocatalysts. In this work, Al-amorphized, flexible Fe2O3 nanofibrous membranes are synthesized for the first time, which are used as self-supported electrocatalysts for HER. It is found that the amorphization results in higher density of oxygen vacancies, which translate into enhanced electrocatalytic activities. Moreover, the amorphization endows the Fe2O3 nanofibrous membranes with robust flexibility, which allows for good self-regulating abilities according to the electrocatalytic conditions. In consequence, the resultant amorphous Fe2O3 nanofibrous membranes exhibit better HER performances than the crystalline counterparts.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2452-2139			WOS:000604631500003

Here, an anodized Prussian blue analogue (PBA) containing Ni and Co is reported as a promising OER electrocatalyst in alkaline media. Detailed post-mortem characterizations indicate the transformation from PBA to Ni(OH)(2) during the anodic process, with the amorphous shell of the PBA facilitating the transformation by promoting greater structural flexibility. Further study with operando Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal the increase of anodic potential improves the degree of deprotonation of the transformed core-shell PBA, leading to an increase of Ni valence. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the increase of Ni valence results in a continuous increase in the adsorption strength of oxygen-containing species, exhibiting a volcano relationship against the OER activity. Based on the experiments and calculated results, an OER mechanism for the transformed product is proposed. The fully activated catalyst also works as the cathode and the anode for a water-splitting electrolysis cell with a high output current density of 13.7 mA cm(-2) when a cell voltage of 1.6 V applied. No obvious performance attenuation is observed after 40 h of catalysis.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000691570100001

J	Ivanov, B								The competition between methyl viologen and monodehydroascorbate radical as electron accepters in spinach thylakoids and intact chloroplasts								FREE RADICAL RESEARCH				33	3			217	227		10.1080/10715760000301391				2000	2000	In spinach thylakoids prepared from intact chloroplasts by shocking in the presence of ascorbate to preserve the operation of ascorbate peroxidase, the rate of oxygen uptake with methyl viologen as acceptor decreased in response to the addition of H2O2. Such a decrease was not observed in the presence of KCN or when the thylakoids lost ascorbate peroxidase activity. Illumination of intact chloroplasts in the presence of H2O2 and methyl viologen showed an initial rate of oxygen exchange, which is intermediate between the initial rate of oxygen evolution in the presence of H2O2 alone and steady-state oxygen uptake in the presence of methyl viologen. The data showed that monodehydroascorbate radical generated in ascorbate peroxidase reaction could compete with methyl viologen for electrons supplied by the electron transport chain in both thylakoids and intact chloroplasts. During the illumination of intact chloroplasts the rate of oxygen uptake increased. The presence of nigericin swiftly led to steady-state oxygen uptake, and to a clear-cut 1:1 relationship between the electron transport rate estimated from fluorescence assay and the electron transport rate determined from oxygen uptake, taking the stoichiometry 1O(2):4e. The increase in oxygen uptake was attributed to the cessation of monodehydroascorbate radical generation brought about by consumption of intrachloroplast ascorbate in the peroxidase reactions, and the effects of nigericin were explained by acceleration of such consumption. The competition between methyl viologen and monodehydroascorbate radical in the intact chloroplasts was estimated under various conditions.									16	0	3	0	14	0	20			1071-5762			WOS:000089221500002	10993476

Herein, we demonstrate a facile sequential template-engaged strategy for fabricating Co-Ni-Fe phosphide hollow nanoboxes with hierarchical structures and desired hetero-metal compositions (Co-Ni-Fe-P HNBs). Starting from ZIF-67 templates, binary-metal Co-Ni and ternary-metal Co-Ni-Fe HNBs are sequentially synthesized and further phosphidated into hetero-metal Co-Ni-Fe-P HNBs. As-resultant Co-Ni-Fe-P HNBs endow multiple structural and compositional merits that expose abundant active sites, accelerate mass/ion diffusion and optimize adsorption energies of oxygen and hydroxyl groups, thus kinetically promoting electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Specifically, Co-Ni-Fe-P HNBs disclose remarkable OER activity with an overpotential of 249 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and stability with 86% activity retained over 24 h, which represents one of the toppest values of OER electrocatalysts. This work thus paves an effective protocol to rationally engineer hierarchical and hetero-metal electrocatalysts towards targeted applications.									14	1	0	0	1	0	14			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000618794400026

Iridium oxide (IrO2) is the only currently known 5d transition metal oxide possessing admirable OER activity. Tremendous efforts have been carried out to enhance the activity of iridium oxides. Unfortunately there lies a gap in understanding what factors responsible for the activity in doped IrO2 or the novel crystal structure. Based on two metallic pyrochlores (Bi2Ir2O7 and Pb2Ir2O6.5) and IrO2. It has been found that there exists a strong correlation between the specific OER activity and IrO6 coordination geometry. The more distortion in IrO6 geometry ascends the activity of Ir sites, and generates activity order of Pb-Ir > IrO2 > Bi-Ir. Our characterizations reveal that distorted IrO6 in Pb-Ir induces a disappearance of J = 1/2 subbands in valence band, while Bi-Ir and IrO2 resist this nature probe. The performed DFT calculations indicated the distortion in IrO6 geometry can optimize binding strength between Ir-5d and O-2p due to broader d band width. Based on this insight, enhancement in OER activity is obtained by effects that change IrO6 octahedral geometry through doping or utilizing structural manipulation with nature of distorted octahedral coordination.									65	4	0	0	6	0	65			2045-2322			WOS:000389085300003	27910932

Carboxyl O atoms coordinate to Mn(II) from unidentate ligands with a cis-configuration. Two uncoordinated O atoms of benzoate anions locate on the one side of the coordination plane so that there is free space on the other side of the plane; such a spatial arrangement may promote the attack of a water molecule at the manganese atom in the oxygen evolution process in photosystem II.									15	2	0	0	1	0	16			0095-8972			WOS:000082689300013

However, it is difficult to control the distribution of transition metals in the precursor and electrocatalyst. Herein, we design a covalent organic polymer to realize the uniform distribution of metal, nitrogen and carbon precursors. The structure of the obtained electrocatalyst is FeNi nanoparticles coated with carbon shells dispersed on Ndoped multilayer porous carbon (FeNi@NC). The resultant FeNi@NC delivered a half-wave potential for ORR of 0.878 V and a low potential of 1.59 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) for OER, which surpasses commercial platinum/carbon and ruthenium dioxide. The outstanding bifunctional properties of FeNi@NC attribute to the synergistic coupling between N-doped carbon shells and dense FeNi nanoparticles. Moreover, the self-made zinc-air battery with FeNi@NC air-cathode displayed an excellent energy density of 137.7 mW cm(-2) as well as cycling stability (100 h, 200 cycles).

The final results show that 0.3-NCCN presented a remarkably visible-light (lambda > 400 nm) photocatalytic H-2 evolution reaching 9297 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), and the reaction process follows the zero-order kinetic model. The increase in crystallization of 0.3-NCCN implies a higher-ordered arrangement of tris-s-triazine. The nonmetal interlayer formed by oxygen-contained graphitized carbon can extend the pi-conjugated system. Both above significantly benefit the rapid migration and separation of charge-carrier. Moreover, the narrowed band gap provides a stronger thermodynamic driving force for improving the photocatalytic water splitting efficiency.

Layered metal diborides (MDbs) holding attractive features mainly due to the presence of borophene subunits in its crystal structure have lately sparked a great deal of attention for electrocatalytic applications. Here, we highlight the synthesis and electrocatalytic properties of HfB2-based electrocatalysts as Hf1-xTMxB2 (TM = Ni and Co; x = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER) under 1 M KOH. Amidst as-prepared samples, Hf0.8Ni0.2B2 and Hf0.8Co0.2B2 appeared to be the best OER and HER catalysts, generating the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 320 and 430 mV, individually. Concerning the OER, Hf0.8Ni0.2B2 performed an oxygen-evolving process similar to benchmarking RuO2 (an overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and even more facile kinetics compared to RuO2 with Tafel slopes of 39.5 mV dec(-1) vs. 66.2 mV dec(-1). In addition, regarding HER, Hf0.8Co0.2B2 displayed an enhanced performance relative to pristine HfB2 (an overpotential of 620 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)), still inferior to noble metal 10% Pt/C (an overpotential of 198 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)). Furthermore, the interpretation of Tafel slopes unveils that all samples follow the Volmer path as HER mechanism. Finally, both best-performing electrocatalysts tolerated the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for 20 h, manifesting stable bifunctional catalysts. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Cobalt oxide (Co3O4) nanostructures with mixed valences (II,III) have been regarded as promising electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). They are able to promote catalytic support of OER but with only modest activity. Here, we demonstrate that the OER performance of cubic Co3O4 electrocatalyst is obviously improved when they are anchored on delaminated two-dimensional (2D) Ti3C2 MXene nanosheets. Upon activation the overpotential of the hybrid catalyst delivers 300 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in basic solutions, which is remarkably lower than those of Ti3C2 MXene and Co3O4 nanocubes. The strong interfacial electrostatic interactions between two components contribute to the exceptional catalytic performance and stability. The enhanced OER activity and facile synthesis make these Co(3)O(4 )nanocubes-decorated ultrathin 2D Ti3C2 MXene nanosheets useful for constructing efficient and stable electrodes for high-performance electrochemical water splitting.

Low-temperature electrochemical water splitting technologies include alkaline, proton exchange membrane, and anion exchange membrane water electrolyses, which normally consist of two coupled half reactions: the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Despite the advances over decades, formidable challenges still exist and hinder the practical application of large-scale, energy-efficient, and economically viable water electrolysis, including large energy penalty, sluggish kinetics, high cost of precious metal based electrocatalysts, possible H-2/O-2 gas crossover, difficulty in storage, and distribution of H-2. Herein, we first briefly introduce the fundamentals of water electrolysis, summarize the recommended standardized electrochemical characterization protocols, and demonstrate the metrics and key performance indicators that are used to evaluate the performances of HER and OER electrocatalysts and electrolyser cells. Then, we present six new strategies to mitigate the technical challenges in conventional water electrolysis. These emerging strategies for disruptive innovation of water electrolysis technology include overall water electrolysis based on bifunctional nonprecious electrocatalysts (or pre-catalysts), magnetic field-assisted water electrolysis, decoupled water electrolysis, hybrid water electrolysis, acid/alkaline asymmetric electrolyte electrolysis, and tandem water electrolysis. Finally, the remaining challenges, perspectives and future directions are discussed. This review will provide guidance and inspire more endeavours to deepen the mechanistic understanding and advance the development of water electrolysis.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2633-5409		WOS:000815201000001

Most of 19 alkali halides show the activity in the reactions mentioned above. Three spectral regions of alkali halides stimulation by light are distinguished in relation to kinetics of oxygen photoadsorption and reactivity of adsorbed oxygen species. They are in correspondence with: (i) bulk exciton absorption bands; (ii) extrinsic and intrinsic bulk and surface absorption bands and (iii) color centers absorption bands. In the latter case the activity of alkali halides arises after pre-excitation in exciton bands, which leads to sensitization of alkali halides to visible light. The H-2 and CO photooxidation on alkali halides is two-step photoprocess involving some excited states of adsorbed oxygen. The latter is quenching by gaseous oxygen as it is shown for hydrogen oxidation over KBr. The photodecomposition of carbon dioxide is treated as CO2 dissociative adsorption with CO evolution into the gas phase. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The systems were annealed in air after, or both prior and after, sputtering of Co, to analyze the treatment influence on functional performances. The interplay between processing conditions and chemico-physical features was investigated by a multitechnique characterization. Photocurrent density measurements in sunlight-assisted H2O splitting revealed a performance improvement upon Co3O4 loading. A cathodic shift of the onset potential was also observed, highlighting Co3O4 activity as catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction.									35	0	1	0	3	0	36			1612-8850	1612-8869		WOS:000368454200015

We adopted four silica materials, namely, SBA-15, KIT-6, MCM-41, and MCM-48 as templates to prepare MnO2 materials by using a nanocasting route. The structural characteristics of the resultant MnO2 materials were thoroughly investigated by using XRD, BET, FESEM, HR-TEM, XPS, and Raman techniques. All studies confirmed the replication of porous MnO2 nanostructures from silica supports in beta-crystallographic form. By employing X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), we identified the existence of Mn and oxygen vacancies in the developed MnO2 material. The hydrodynamic linear sweep voltammetric technique was employed to demonstrate the efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of the catalyst in 0.1 M KOH solution. The KIT-6-derived MnO2 nanostructure displayed equal activity to the benchmark catalyst RuO2 . This work lays a foundation to prepare and employ ordered mesoporous MnO2 materials as OER/ORR catalysts, which have potential applications in electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices.									25	1	0	0	1	0	26			2196-0216			WOS:000461673300023

Simulation results are in close agreement with experimental results obtained by several condensed matter physics research groups working in this field, suggesting that the photoreactions of this model may, indeed, describe the physical processes involved in Ge-doped silica preform photosensitivity. The proposed photosensitivity model is defined by two differential equations that describe the temporal evolution of a set of color-center concentrations. The first is a modification of a very fast reversible reaction previously proposed by Fujimaki et al., where the reaction precursor has a different chemical structure (it is a neutral oxygen divacancy NODV unrelated to the previously proposed germanium lone pair center GLPC). The chemical structure of this precursor defect explains the generation of nonintrinsic neutral oxygen monovacancy (NOMV) color centers. These centers are transformed into GeE' defects by means of a second nonlinear reaction. This justifies the slow increase in the absorption peak experimentally measured at 6.3 eV, which had no satisfactory explanation.									6	2	0	0	0	0	7			1943-0655	1943-0647		WOS:000325407400017

Recently, numerous studies have shown that the OER reaction kinetics can be modified by optimizing components, introducing carbon matrix, and regulating porous nanostructures. Herein, a flexible and controllable electrospinning strategy is proposed to construct porous nitrogen (N)-doped carbon (C) nanofibers (NFs) with nickel-iron (NiFe) alloy nanoparticles encapsulated inside (NiFe@NCNFs) as an OER electrocatalyst. Benefiting from the strong synergistic effects that stem from the one-dimensional mesoporous structures with optimized binary metal components encapsulated in the N-doped carbon nanofibers, the NiFe@NCNFs exhibits enhanced OER performance with a low overpotential (294 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and excellent durability (over 10 h at 10 mA cm(-2)) in alkaline solution. Both experimental characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations validate that a suitable binary metal ratio can lead to the optimal catalytic activity. Moreover, a two-electrode electrolyzer is assembled by using NiFe@NCNFs anode and Pt/C cathode in 1.0 M KOH media for the overall water splitting, which delivers an initial cell voltage of only 1.531 V at 10 mA cm(-2), as well as long-term stability up to 20 h. This study sheds light on the design and large-scale production of low-cost and high-performance electrocatalysts toward different energy applications in the future.									45	1	0	0	0	0	45			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000551488400043	32569458

In this study, a novel Fe-doped cobalt-phosphate nanosheet-packed 3D microsphere developed on a planar Cu substrate (FexCo3-x(PO4)(2)/Cu) with a tunable stoichiometry (x = 0-0.64) is fabricated using a facile one-step electrodeposition approach from a Reline-based deep eutectic solvent. The Fe-tuned integrated electrode exhibits superior HER electrocatalytic performance over a wide pH range and robust bifunctional catalytic activity for overall water splitting in alkaline media. The optimized Fe0.43Co2.57(PO4)(2)/Cu needs overpotentials of only 108.1, 128.8, and 291.5 mV to drive a promising current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, 0.5 M H2SO4, and 1.0 M phosphate-buffered saline, respectively, along with outstanding durability. Moreover, the developed Fe0.43Co2.57(PO4)(2)/Cu can catalyze both HER and OER in 1.0 M KOH with high efficiency and robust stability over 100 h. The remarkably enhanced performance of the integrated FexCo3-x(PO4)(2)/Cu can be ascribed to the modification of the O active electronic property in phosphate with Fe doping, which results in optimal hydrogen adsorption on the active sites. Further, the unique 3D microsphere structure coupled with a 2D nanosheet internal architecture offers abundant catalytic interfaces with more active sites and favorable transfer kinetics. All these synergistically contribute to its superior electrochemical performance.									14	1	0	0	0	0	15			2168-0485			WOS:000572823400024

Electrocatalytic water splitting is a possible route to the expanded generation of green hydrogen; however, a long-term challenge is the requirement of fresh water as an electrolyzer feed. The use of seawater as a direct feed for electrolytic hydrogen production would alleviate fresh water needs and potentially open an avenue for locally generated hydrogen from marine hydrokinetic or off-shore power sources. One environmental limitation to seawater electrolysis is the generation of chlorine as a competitive anodic reaction. This work evaluates transition metal (W, Co, Fe, Sn, and Ru) doping of Mn-Mo-based catalysts as a strategy to suppress chlorine evolution while sustaining catalytic efficiency. Electrochemical evaluations in neutral chloride solution and raw seawater showed the promise of a novel Mn-Mo-Ru electrode system for oxygen evolution efficiency and enhanced catalytic activity. Subsequent stability testing in a flowing raw seawater flume highlighted the need for improved catalyst stability for long-term applications of Mn-Mo-Ru catalysts. This work highlights that elements known to be selective toward chlorine evolution in simple oxide form (e.g., RuO2) may display different trends in selectivity when used as isolated dopants, where Ru suppressed chlorine evolution in Mn-based catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2076-3417		WOS:000735870100001		
J	SHUTILOVA, NI; KLIMOV, VV; ANTROPOVA, TM; SHNYROV, VL								THERMAL INACTIVATION OF THE OXYGEN-EVOLVING COMPLEX OF THE FUNCTIONAL CORE OF PHOTOSYSTEM-II IN CHLOROPLASTS								BIOCHEMISTRY-MOSCOW				57	10			1042	1048						OCT 1992	1992	The rates of thermal inactivation of the oxygen evolution in three subchloroplast preparations has been compared The preparations are the isolated oxygen-evolving pigment-protein-lipid complex (OEC) which is the functional core of Photosystem H (PS-II), PS-II subchloroplast particles, and the initial granal thylakoids of spinach chloroplasts. Substantial increase in thermal lability of these preparations was found in the series. PS-II subchloroplast particles < granal thylakoids < OEC. The temperatures for half-inactivation of oxygen evolution are 45, 40, and 34-degrees-C, respectively. The thermally induced inhibition is irreversible and is accompanied by sudden release of endogenous Mn2+ which occurs in the range of the half-inactivation temperatures. The thermal lability series correlates with the exposure of hydrophilic groups of the functional core to the aqueous phase in the corresponding preparations. This exposure was estimated from the ratio between the rates of oxygen evolution in the presence of hydrophilic and hydrophobic electron acceptors. An increase in hydrophilicity of the surface of the PS-II core occurs on isolation of OEC from membranes using detergent. This effect is clearly related to the interaction of the OEC with the light-harvesting complex.Three thermally induced structural transitions in the functional core of PS-II have been observed by differential scanning microcalorimetry. The low-temperature or A-transition correlates strictly with the corresponding half-inactivation temperature of oxygen evolution in the studied preparations. The A-transition occurs below the melting temperatures of proteins in the OEC. From physicochemical analysis of this data, it is proposed that the water-oxidizing system is located in a region of hydrophobic contacts between two PS-II reaction centers. The native state of the OEC has also been suggested to be a dimer of two core complexes. We assume that the water-oxidizing system cannot be isolated in the form of a single enzyme complex. The hydrophobic locus forming the contact region of the two reaction centers may play a key role in the structure of water-oxidizing system and in stabilization of the highly reactive oxidized intermediates that are produced during its function. The low thermal stability of the water-oxidizing system may be due to thermally induced dissociation of the dimer complex.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0006-2979			WOS:A1992LE59100008

In this work, alpha-MnO2 nanorods are synthesized by a simple hydrothermal technique and are modified with palladium (Pd) nanoparticles to form Pd-deposited alpha-MnO2 (Pd/alpha-MnO2) nanostructures. The physical characteristics of the thus prepared materials are analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), SEM, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) techniques. These analyses confirmed the successful synthesis of 8 similar to 10-nm-sized Pd nanoparticles deposited on 82 similar to 85-nm-sized alpha-MnO2 nanorods. The catalytic activities of the synthesized Pd/alpha-MnO2 nanostructure for oxygen reduction reaction and evolution reaction were studied by measuring linear sweeping voltammograms in aqueous solution. The as-prepared material exhibited high electrocatalytic activities which were comparable to that of the commercial Pt/C catalysts. The Pd/alpha-MnO2 nanostructures were then examined as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in the air cathode of Li-air batteries in non-aqueous media. The Li-air batteries fabricated with the Pd/alpha-MnO2 catalyst deliver a high discharge capacity with low overpotential compared to the other batteries without Pd deposition or any catalyst.									18	3	0	0	0	0	19			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000353234200026

Herein, Fe doped beta-Ni(OH)2/NF with three-dimensional (3D) hybrid structure is synthesized by a facile two-step hydrothermal design. The doping of trace iron on the surface of beta-Ni(OH)2 was achieved by precipitation/dissolution equilibrium while maintaining the order of the beta-Ni(OH)2 matrix. The 3D hybrid structure provides more sites for iron incorporation on the surface/edge/corner of beta-Ni(OH)2 host by precipitation/dissolution equilibrium doping mode. The addition of iron on the surface can expose more Fe-Ni-Fe sites, adjust the electronic structure of nickel sites, and optimize the adsorption/analytical energy of OER reaction intermediates. As expected, Fe2(0.1)-beta-Ni(OH)2/NF demonstrates optimal OER catalytic activity, with only 300 mV overpotential at 100 mA cm-2 current density and a small Tafel slope up to 44.0 mV dec-1. Its morphology and OER performance present inconspicuous decay after 72 h of stable operation at 100 mA cm-2 current density. This paper provides a feasible path for the design and synthesis of trace doped bimetallic OER catalysts with high efficiency and stability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000866264200004

Multishell, hollow NiCoFe alloy spheres were prepared with vacancies, gaps or defect, and tilting of an atomic plane with incorporated graphitic carbon derived from the surfactant. The extra gaps or defects in the lattice, which can be verified by high-resolution transmission electron microscope, provide additional active edge sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction. As a result, three-dimensional NiCoFe alloy poses a very low overpotential of 16 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 for the hydrogen evolution reaction and an unexpectedly small Tafel slope of 38 mV dec(-1). This work can therefore broaden horizons and provide a new dimension for the design of new, highly efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution in an acidic medium.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2398-4902			WOS:000498612600002

It is important to develop highly efficient electrocatalysts for the OER due to its sluggish kinetics. The electronic properties and morphological structure of electrocatalysts can significantly affect their OER performance. Electrocatalysts with the morphology of nanosheets can expose more active sites which would enhance the OER activity. Here, we report an extremely simple and fast method to synthesize a NixFe1-xSe@Ni(Fe)OOH core-shell nanostructure with a nanosheet shell by a facile solvothermal selenization and ion exchange reaction. The NixFe1-xSe@Ni(Fe)OOH core-shell nanostructure gives an excellent catalytic activity toward the OER with an overpotential as low as 260 mV to reach a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) and excellent electrochemical long-term stability in 1 M KOH solution. The enhanced OER activity can be attributed to the dual modulation of electronic properties and the morphological structure by Fe doping.									59	3	0	0	2	0	60			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000417953100040

Morphology/surface optimization can be intensively applied to enhance the catalytic activity of specific materials. Herein, we propose an electrospinning method followed by heat treatment to fabricate CoOx nanoparticles on N-doped carbon nanofibers (CoOx@NCF). Significantly, the electrocatalytic activity can be largely improved through modulating the exterior Co2+/Co3+ ratio by controlling the heat-treatment process. The prepared CoOx nanoparticles possess high uniformity together with good dispersion, which integrates the advantages of morphology and surface properties, making them an effective active catalyst for Li-O-2 batteries. The cell with the CoOx@NCF catalyst shows impressively good performance towards the ORR and OER with a high initial discharge capacity (7763.7 mA h g(-1)), enhanced cycling stability, desirable rate capability and relatively low overpotential. Moreover, the result of LSV indicates that CoOx@NCF enables the decomposition of the side product LiOH efficiently. In addition, the CoOx@NCF catalyst is capable of forming nanosheet-like Li2O2, which is much easier to decompose, compared with toroidal-like Li2O2. The boosted cycling life can be attributed to the synergistic effect of architecture design and surface engineering.									22	6	0	0	4	0	26			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000465404200024

The 27R polytypoid (Al9O3N7) powders were mixed with a stoichiometric amount of Y2O3 and, then hot-pressed at 20 MPa. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the phase change from 27R to AlN started at about 1350 degrees C in the absence of a liquid phase, since the lowest liquidus temperature in the system AlN-Al2O3-Y2O3 is reported to be about 1690 degrees C. The result revealed that the diffusion of oxygen out of 27R grains can progress in part through solid-state reaction at low temperatures. However, the reaction was complete at temperatures exceeding 1700 degrees C in the presence of liquid phase. Thermal conductivity of the hot-pressed samples was also measured and discussed in terms of the phase change as well as microstructural evolution. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd and Techna S.r.l.

Herein, a hierarchical core-shell structure electrocatalyst ZIF-Co2P/V3P is in situ grown on Ni foam (abbreviated as ZIF-Co2P/V3P@NF) by a stepwise method. Firstly, Co, V layered double hydroxides (CoV-LDHs) is grown directly on Ni foam (NF) substrate by solvothermal method. Secondly, CoV-LDHs@NF is transferred into 2-MeIm solution and its surface is coated with a layer of imidazolate zeolite skeleton (ZIF). Finally, ZIF-Co2P/V3P@NF catalyst is obtained by low-temperature phosphorization method. The performance of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be adjusted by tuning molar ratio of Co/V, and the optimized ZIF-Co2P/V3P@NF-2 manifests superior performance due to its core-shell structure covered by ZIF skeleton, rich heterogeneous interfaces, as well as the positive synergistic interaction between the Co2P and V3P. The overpotentials are only 57 mV@10 mA cm(-2) for HER and 261 mV@10 mA cm(-2) for OER. Remarkably, the alkaline electrolyzer assembled with ZIF-Co2P/V3P@NF-2 catalyst acquires a small operating voltage of 1.54 V to drive the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and displays excellent long-term durability. This work provides a novel opinion for design and preparation of non-noble metal electrocatalysts. (C) 2022 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Here, an innovative superhydrophilic vanadium-modulated Ni3Se2 nanorod@nanosheet array in situ grown on nickel foam (V-Ni3Se2/NF) is synthesized via a solvothermal strategy employing a NiV-LDH nanosheet as a precursor. Experimental investigations disclose that the hierarchical nanostructure endows V-Ni3Se2/NF with abundant electrochemically surface active sites that render the easy accessibility of the electrolyte to the electrode, thereby enhancing the electron transfer efficiency and electrocatalytic activity toward HER and OER. Furthermore, the modulated electronic configuration in V-Ni3Se2/NF not only favors the water dissociation and formation of adsorbed hydrogen but also optimizes the binding energy of key reaction intermediates, thus expediting the water electrolysis kinetics. Consequently, the V-Ni3Se2/NF electrode requires ultralow overpotentials of 275 and 370 mV at a large current density of 500 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution toward HER and OER, respectively. The assembled V-Ni3Se2/NF parallel to V-Ni3Se2/NF electrolyzer yields a low cell voltage equaling to 1.56 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) together with an extraordinary long-term durability for 80 h, far outperforming the benchmark Pt/C/NF parallel to IrO2/NF counterpart (1.76 V, 10 mA cm(-2)), demonstrating its glorious potentials in large-scale industrial water electrolysis applications. This work puts forward novel synergistic tactics to construct bifunctional electrocatalysts with prominent water splitting performance in a harsh alkaline electrolyte.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2168-0485			WOS:000695384700037

Without understanding the physics behind the TM-induced catalytic enhancements, it would be challenging to design the next generation of electrocatalysts. Herein, single Ru atoms are introduced into a CoCr LDHs lattice to improve activity. In 0.1 m KOH, CoCrRu LDHs require only 290 mV overpotential to drive to 10 mA cm(-2) and show a Tafel slope of 56.12 mV dec(-1). Electronic structure analyses based on density functional theory confirm that promoted OER activity originates from synergetic charge transfer among Ru, Cr, and Co elements. Specifically, Ru dopants can downshift d states of Co and enhance electron donation of Cr to oxygenates, which essentially breaks the scaling relation and achieves higher activity. This work provides insights into how single atomic Ru dopant tunes the electronic structures of its neighbor's active site Co and thus increases OER activities.									47	4	0	0	1	0	48			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000506466400001	31922697

Co-based catalysts have been regarded as promising ORR and OER catalysts owing to the multivalence characteristic of cobalt element. Herein, the synthesis of Co nanoislands rooted on Co-N-C nanosheets supported by carbon felts (Co/Co-N-C) is reported. Co nanosheets rooted on the carbon felt derived from electrodeposition are applied as the self-template and cobalt source. The synergistic effect of metal Co islands with OER activity and Co-N-C nanosheets with superior ORR performance leads to good bifuctional catalytic performances. Wavelet transform extended X-ray absorption fine spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy certify the formation of Co (mainly Co-0) and the Co-N-C (mainly Co2+ and Co3+) structure. As the air-cathode, the assembled aqueous Zn-air battery exhibits a small charge-discharge voltage gap (0.82 V@10 mA cm(-2)) and high power density of 132 mW cm(-2), outperforming the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Additionally, the cable flexible rechargeable Zn-air battery exhibits excellent bendable and durability.

Herein, a step-by-step self-assembly strategy is developed to allocate nickel (Ni) and iron (Fe) single atoms respectively on the inner and outer walls of graphene hollow nanospheres (GHSs), realizing separate-sided different single-atom functionalization of hollow graphene. The Ni or Fe single atom is demonstrated to be coordinated with four N atoms via the formation of a Ni-N(4)or Fe-N(4)planar configuration. The developed Ni-N-4/GHSs/Fe-N(4)Janus material exhibits excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic performance, in which the outer Fe-N(4)clusters dominantly contribute to high activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), while the inner Ni-N(4)clusters are responsible for excellent activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Density functional theory calculations demonstrate the structures and reactivities of Fe-N(4)and Ni-N(4)for the ORR and OER. The Ni-N-4/GHSs/Fe-N(4)endows a rechargeable Zn-air battery with excellent energy efficiency and cycling stability as an air-cathode, outperforming that of the benchmark Pt/C+RuO(2)air-cathode.

Herein, B, N and F tri-doped lignin-based carbon porous nanofibers (BNF-LCFs) were prepared by electrospinning and pyrolysis without extra post-treatment using biomass lignin as carbon precursor, PVP as spinning additive, zinc borate as boron source, ammonium fluoride as fluorine source and partial nitrogen source. This method is simple, efficient, and environmentally friendly. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of B, N and F heteroatoms, large specific surface area and abundant defect sites, the BNF-LCF catalyst exhibits impressive bifunctional electrocatalytic performance towards ORR and OER with a small potential gap (Delta E) of 0.728 V.

Traditional heteroatom doping and structural design is still unsatisfactory due to the high cost. Herein, the Ni -based metal-organic framework (Ni-MOF) was used as precursor and self-template, and a series of N-doped Ni-Co bimetallic sulfides (N-NixCoy-S) were synthesized using oil bath plus solvothermal method. The as-prepared sulfide displayed hollow sphere structure with a diameter of 300-500 nm. The electrocatalytic activity was investigated using a typical three-electrode system (Hg/HgO and carbon rod as reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively). By optimizing the Ni/Co ratio, the precisely tailored N-Ni1Co4-S material delivered superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances with a low overpotential of 286.2 & PLUSMN; 2.4 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution (pH = 13.5). Such the catalyst can further exhibit a long-term catalytic stability with almost no decay during 36 h in KOH electrolyte.

Transition metal based oxides have been deeply investigated, benefiting from their promising catalytic activity as well as their low cost. However, among these oxides, the OER efficiency of molybdenum oxides has rarely been studied due to its limited intrinsic activity. Herein, we reported amorphous cobalt-doped molybdenum oxide (Co-MoOx) with a core-shell structure as an effective OER catalyst for the first time. Benefiting from the cobalt doping as well as the amorphous structural character, the charge transfer process and the active sites are both well optimized, which is highly desired for an advanced electrocatalyst. As expected, the Co-MoOx catalyst afforded an extremely low overpotential of 340 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and a small Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1) in KOH solution.

The resulting Co@NC-0.1 can synchronously accelerate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), representing a preponderant universal catalytic activity and outstanding stability in alkaline electrolyte. Such a remarkable performance is mainly credited to considerable specific surface area, high pore volume, well-dispersed copious active sites (especially efficient Co-N-x moieties) and the synergy of a close contact between cobalt nanoparticles and carbon frameworks. Accordingly, a Co@NC-0.1 driven liquid rechargeable ZAB can achieve well-qualified assembly, including a confined discharge-charge voltage gap of 0.85 V at 20 mA cm(-2) and well-maintained cycling stability beyond 200 h. More attractively, Co@NC-0.1 is also utilized as a cathode catalyst for button-type and flexible rechargeable ZABs, which performs respectable performances. Undoubtedly, this finding provides a simple tactic for allowing one to construct advanced 3D bifunctional catalyst toward affordable catalysis and future energy conversion technologies.

X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns indicate that the prepared 3-DOM IrO2 has a rutile structure. Images of scanning and transmission electron microscopies suggest that the 3-DOM IrO2 possesses a hierarchical pore structure, in which the honeycomb array of 300 nm primary macropores were cross-linked by secondary mesopores on the walls. The presence of mesopores is also indicated by the N-2 adsorption/desorption isotherms and the small-angle XRD patterns. As compared with IrO2 prepared by conventional colloidal method, the 3-DOM IrO2 exhibited much larger BET area and voltammetric charges. Accordingly, about two and half times enhancement in OER activity was achieved by using 3-DOM IrO2 as the electrode materials, showing prospect of 3-DOM materials in reducing the demand of the expensive IrO2 electrocatalyst for OER in water electrolysis.									143	6	0	0	3	0	145			0959-9428	1364-5501		WOS:000301195300018

In this work, CxNy particles@N-doped porous graphene (CxNy@NPG) with a novel three-dimensional architecture is successfully synthesized via a simple template method and employed as the cathode catalyst of Li-O-2 batteries. It is surprisingly found that the as-synthesized CxNy@NPG cathode not only demonstrates a remarkable cycling performance of 200 cycles at 1000 mA g(-1) but also an intriguing high-rate capability with 8892 mA h g(-1) at 1000 mA g(-1), both of which can be attributed to a synergistic effect between the unique 3D porous structure and an effective N-doping. Specifically, it is believed that the unique porous 3D structure will, on one hand, build numerous microchannels, thus facilitating rapid O-2 diffusion, and on the other hand, provide sufficient storage space to accommodate adequate discharge products. Indispensably, it is also believed that the N-doped porous graphene enables improved bifunctional catalytic activities towards both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), thus decreasing the discharge/charge overpotential, and reducing undesired side reactions. It is anticipated that the new 3D porous CxNy@NPG provides an inspiring route to design long cycling and high-rate performance cathodes for Li-O-2 batteries.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000438246000060	29946588

A melt size of 50 kg was used. Experimental parameters, namely nature and size of the deoxidising reactants and bath parameters, such as dissolved carbon, nitrogen and oxygen levels in the bath and temperature of the bath, were varied to investigate effects on the extent, of denitrogenation. A trend of increasing denitrogenation with increasing gas evolution in the bath was observed. The extent of denitrogenation showed a decreasing trend with increasing temperature and oxygen level in the bath. Thermodynamic consistency was checked by calculating the average partial pressure of desorbed nitrogen from the total gas generated and the total volume of nitrogen liberated at the reaction site.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0301-9233			WOS:000181490000005

However, due to the high energy consumption and low conversion efficiency of water splitting, it remains a challenge to design an oxygen-efficient and stable catalyst. In this work, NiOx nanoflakes were prepared by electrochemical codeposition and dealloying, and Co3O4 films were deposited on the NiOx nanoflakes by atomic layer deposition (ALD). After annealing, it was found by HRTEM that NiCo2O4 formed between the NiOx nanoflakes and Co3O4 layers. These nanoflakes had a low overpotential of 315 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) in a 1 M NaOH solution. Furthermore, the sandwich-like nanostructure also provided good oxygen evolution stability and a large carrier concentration. Due to the Co+2/Co+3 and Ni+2/Ni+3 electron pairs of NiCo2O4 combined with NiOx and Co3O4, the charge transferred easily and the activity increased. Thus, an efficient and simple OER catalyst was developed, which can contribute to the production of green energy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we designed an efficient NiO-based NRR electrocatalyst by introducing oxygen vacancies (OVs) through a facile plasma technique. Although the pristine NiO nanosheets exhibited poor NRR activity, the plasma-engineered NiO nanosheets with enriched OVs delivered significantly enhanced NRR activity with an NH3 yield of 29.1 mu g h(-1) mg(-1) and a faradaic efficiency of 10.8% in 0.1 M Na2SO4 at -0.5 V (RHE) under ambient conditions, comparable or superior to most reported NRR catalysts. Density functional theory calculations revealed that OV introduction could readily tailor the electronic structures of NiO to result in enhanced conductivity, improved N-2 adsorption, a reduced reaction energy barrier, and a less-promoted hydrogen evolution reaction.									55	7	0	0	2	0	56			2052-1553			WOS:000509528500014

Journal of colloid and interface science				629	Pt B			179	192		10.1016/j.jcis.2022.09.068				2022-Sep-16	2022	With high prices of precious metals (such as platinum, iridium, and ruthenium) and transition metals (such as cobalt and nickel), the design of high-efficiency and low-cost non-precious-metal-based catalysts using iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) metals for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are critical for commercial applications of water splitting devices. In the study, without using any template or surfactant, we successfully designed novel cross-linked manganese borate (Mn3(BO3)2) and iron carbide (Fe3C) embedded into boron (B) and nitrogen (N) co-doped three-dimensional (3D) hierarchically meso/macroporous carbon nanowires (denoted as FexMny@BN-PCFs). Electrochemical test results showed that the HER and OER catalytic activities of Fe1Mn1@BN-PCFs were close to those of 20wt% Pt/C and RuO2. For full water splitting, (-) Fe1Mn1@BN-PCFs||Fe1Mn1@BN-PCF (+) cell achieved a current density of 10mAcm-2 at a cell voltage of 1.622V, which was 14.2mV larger than that of (-) 20wt% Pt/C||RuO2 (+) benchmark. The synergistic effect of 3D hierarchically meso/macroporous architectures, excellent charge transport capacity, and abundant active centers (cross-linked Mn3(BO3)2/Fe3C@BNC, BC3, pyridinic-N, MNC, and graphitic-N) enhanced the water splitting catalytic activity of Fe1Mn1@BN-PCFs. The (-) Fe1Mn1@BN-PCFs||Fe1Mn1@BN-PCF (+) cell exhibited excellent stability owing to the superior structural and chemical stabilities of 3D hierarchically porous Fe1Mn1@BN-PCFs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1095-7103		MEDLINE:36152575	36152575

In this study, we investigate nickel oxide (NiOx) nanoparticles as a water oxidation catalyst in hybrid photoanodes based on polymeric carbon nitride (CNx) supported on electron-collecting mesoporous TiO(2)support. The performance of the resulting TiO2-CNx/NiO(x)photoanodes is evaluated with respect to our previous results on hybrid TiO2-CN(x)photoanodes modified with IrO(x)and CoO(OH)(x)cocatalysts. The deposition of NiO(x)into TiO2-CN(x)photoanodes enhances significantly the photocurrent (from mu A to >250 mu A cm(-2)at 1.23 Vvs.RHE) under visible light irradiation (lambda> 420 nm, similar to 200 mW cm(-2)) and triggers the photoelectrocatalytic oxygen evolution. No oxygen evolution was observed without a cocatalyst. As compared to photoanodes modified with IrO(x)or CoO(OH)(x), the TiO2-CNx/NiO(x)photoanodes excel by the very negative photocurrent onset potential (0 Vvs. RHE), which we ascribe to good hole-extracting properties of NiOx. However, the comparatively low Faradaic efficiencies for oxygen evolution (similar to 18%) and dramatically decreased operational stability of the photoanodes indicate that the extracted holes do not efficiently oxidize water to dioxygen, but instead accumulate in the NiO(x)particles and increase thus the oxidative photodegradation of the photoanodes. Our study highlights the fact that employing outstanding electrocatalysts like NiO(x)in photoelectrochemical water-splitting systems does not necessarily lead to satisfactory results, especially when the photoelectrode cannot be operated at optimal pH due to light absorber stability issues.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2515-7655			WOS:000575276000001

The samples were irradiated at (i) room temperature or (ii) elevated temperature (350 degrees C) by MeV electrons and then isothermally annealed at 8 different temperatures in the range of 300 degrees C to 500 degrees C. The evolution of the concentrations of oxygen complexes (O-n, n <= 3) and mono-vacancy-oxygen defects (VOn, n <= 4) have been followed by infrared absorption measurements of local vibrational modes originating from the individual defects. The experimental kinetics data have been compared with simulation results based on the theory for diffusion limited reactions, assuming a model where sequential build-up of the VOn defects is a key ingredient. A close quantitative agreement is obtained for both sets of samples despite quite different initial conditions prior to the annealing, which adds evidence to the validity of the model. Values for the diffusivity and dissociation rates of VOn (n <= 4) and O-n (n <= 3) have been deduced and in general, the mobility and stability of VOn decrease and increase with n, respectively. For all the defects, partial dissociation appears as a prevailing process during diffusion, while full dissociation of VOn is limited by an energy barrier identical to that of interstitial oxygen (O-i) diffusion (similar to 2.55 eV). The oxygen dimer and trimer are fast diffusers but slower than substitutional oxygen, i.e., VO; VO is found to be the most mobile species, whilst O-i is the slowest one with a difference in diffusivity of up to 7 orders of magnitude in the studied temperature range.

Synthesis of double perovskite and g-C3N4 composite that were used as bifunctional catalysts, which were prepared into bifunctional electrodes, and used to test its catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Then, the doping ratio (x=0.4) of Ni in double perovskite with the best oxygen catalytic activity was selected to be composited with a certain weight ratio of g-C3N4, testing the catalytic activity of the composite catalysts. The results show that the composite catalysts were obviously better than the single catalysts. When the amount of g-C3N4 added was 30% of the mass of the double perovskite, the maximum current densities of the catalytic ORR was 395.7 mA.cm(-2) (-0.6 V vs Hg/HgO), the catalytic OER was 372.0 mA.cm(-2) (1 V vs Hg/HgO). This indicates that the synergistic catalysis of g-C3N4 and Sr2Ni0.4Co1.6O6 could improve the catalytic activity of the double perovskite.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1001-4861			WOS:000461725200009

Among them, transition metal complexes, characterized by a redox-active single-metal-atom with biomimetic ligands, such as pyrolyzed cobalt-nitrogen-carbon (Co-N-x/C), have attracted considerable attention. Therefore, we reported the ORR mechanism of pyrolyzed Vitamin B12 using operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy coupled with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, which enables operando monitoring of the oxygen binding site on the metal center. Our results revealed the preferential adsorption of oxygen at the Co2+ center, with end-on coordination forming a Co2+-oxo species. Furthermore, the charge transfer mechanism between the catalyst and reactant enables further Co-O species formation. These experimental findings, corroborated with first-principle calculations, provide insight into metal active-site geometry and structural evolution during ORR, which could be used for developing material design strategies for high-performance electrocatalysts for fuel cell applications.									37	2	0	0	3	1	37				2041-1723		WOS:000567536300001	32843614

In this work, the density functional theory was used to predict the stability of Co9S8. The calculated results showed that stability could be improved through Fe-doping at the octahedral site compared to pure Co9S8. To validate the theoretical results, several Fe-incorporated Co9S8 hollow spheres ((Co1-xFex)(9)S-8) with different Co/Fe mole ratios were fabricated by a simple one-step hydrothermal method. The Mossbauer spectra indicated the preference of Fe replacement of Co at the octahedral site. The as-obtained (Co0.92Fe0.08)(9)S-8 hollow spheres exhibited superior electrocatalytic performances with a low overpotential of 268 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), as well as a smaller Tafel slope of 63.9 mV dec(-1) and robust stability toward oxygen evolution reaction for 60 h. The resulting (Co0.94Fe0.06)(9)S-8 hollow spheres also exhibited a high capacity of 454 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) and amazing cycling stability with 94.03% capacity retention after 5000 cycles. The superior electrochemical performances look promising and suggest the relevance of the proposed approach for the construction of future improved structures.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000772757000001

Unfortunately, the high cost of these noble metals has severely restricted their large-scale applications. Herein, we report the fabrication of a cost-effective OER/ORR bifunctional catalyst by embedding atomic Fe-Ni dual metal pairs into nitrogen-doped carbon hollow spheres (Fe-NiNC-50). The resultant catalyst shows exceptional catalytic performance towards both OER and ORR, which is even comparable to the noble metal-based benchmarks. By virtue of its bi-functionality, a rechargeable zinc-air battery is constructed and presents high power density (similar to 220 mW cm(-2)), stable discharge voltage and large specific energy density (similar to 932.66 Wh kg(Zn)(-1)). Moreover, the rechargeable Zn-air battery exhibits long-term durability in a charge-discharge cycling test (100 h) with negligible performance degradation. The outstanding bifunctional catalytic performance can be ascribed to the formation of Fe-Ni atomic pairs, which imposes mutual effects for tuning electronic structures of both Fe and Ni sites. Experiments and theoretical calculations further unravel that the electronically modified Ni and Fe atoms are the active sites for OER and ORR, respectively, facilitating both OER and ORR by tuning the binding energy of the reaction intermediates.									113	5	0	0	2	0	112			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000530670200033

Here, based on extensive first-principles calculations combined with excited state dynamics simulations, we report that a weak van der Waals (vdW) C7N6/Sc2CCl2 heterostructure is a mediator-free direct Z-scheme photocatalyst for solar water splitting. Theoretical results clearly reveal that this heterostructure displays a nice light-harvesting performance extending to the near-infrared region. The relatively strong interfacial nonadiabatic coupling accelerates the interlayer carrier recombination in the time scale of sub-picoseconds. The well separated electrons and holes with a strong redox capacity make the hydrogen evolution reaction spontaneously occur on the C7N6 surface and the oxygen evolution reaction on the Se-doped Sc2CCl2 surface, respectively, when the proposed heterostructure is radiated with solar light.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1948-7185			WOS:000757522900013	35129359

It is also established experimentally that corrosion and wettability of metal oxides can, in fact, enhance the catalytic activity for OER owing to the formation of a hydrated surface layer. However, the mechanistic interplay between surface wettability, interfacial water dynamics and OER across RuO2, and what degree these processes are correlated are still debated. Herein, spin-polarized Density Functional Theory Molecular Dynamics (DFT-MD) simulations, coupled with advanced enhanced sampling methods in the well-tempered metadynamics framework, are applied to gain a global understanding of RuO2 aqueous interface (explicit water solvent) in catalyzing the OER, and hence possibly help in the design of novel catalysts in the context of photochemical water oxidation. The present study quantitatively assesses the free-energy barriers behind the OER at the (110)-RuO2 catalyst surface revealing plausible pathways composing the reaction network of the O-2 evolution. In particular, OER is investigated at room temperature when such a surface is exposed to both gas-phase and liquid-phase water. Albeit a unique efficient pathway has been identified in the gas-phase OER, a surprisingly lowest-free-energy-requiring reaction route is possible when (110)-RuO2 is in contact with explicit liquid water. By estimating the free-energy surfaces associated to these processes, we reveal a noticeable water-assisted OER mechanism which involves a crucial proton-transfer-step assisted by the local water environment. These findings pave the way toward the systematic usage of DFT-MD coupled with metadynamics techniques for the fine assessment of the activity of catalysts, considering finite-temperature and explicit-solvent effects.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000707393100001	34486184

Nevertheless, their poor conductivity is still a barrier hindering their use. Herein, we report a catalyst prototype of Co-based antiperovskite nitrides CuNCo3-xVx (0 <= x <= 1) to be a highly effective OER electrocatalyst. The synthesized CuNCo3-xVx exhibits greatly enhanced activity and stability toward the OER in alkaline medium. The CuNCo2.4V0.6 shows a mere 235 mV of overpotential to reach 10 mA cm(-2), which is comparable to that of Ir/C (232 mV). More importantly, the CuNCo2.4V0.6 is more durable than the conventional Ir/C catalyst. The CuNCo2.4V0.6 catalyst enabled a Zn-air battery to exhibit a cycle life of 143 h with a much higher cell efficiency. The V-substituted CuNCo2.4V0.6 provides a higher content of the desirable Co3+ species in the post-OER catalyst, which ensures a high activity over a long-term operation. With these enhanced effects enabled by the compositional flexibility of CuNCo3-xVx antiperovskite nitride, a feasible strategy for optimizing an electrocatalyst with tunable properties is provided.									39	3	0	0	2	0	40			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000490353500095	31532687

It was found that with the increase of Fe doping content, the hydrogen evolution rate increased initially and then decreased. The highest hydrogen evolution of 697 mu mol g(-1) is observed for 2Fe/TiO2, after 4 h of light irradiation, which was five times greater than that in the case of pure TiO2 who has 140 mu mol g(-1) hydrogen evolution after 4 h of light irradiation. This improvement in the water-splitting efficiency owing to optimized Fe doping could be attributed to an enhancement in the visible-light absorption characteristics and an increase in the number of oxygen vacancies, which act as the reaction sites for water splitting.									8	2	0	0	0	0	9			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000417989900002	29176048

Under the reaction conditions employed (273 K to 773 K, and propene to oxygen ratios from 1:1 to 1:5), orthorhombic MoO3 remains the only crystalline phase detected by XRD. The starting temperature for the reaction of propene and oxygen in the presence Of MoO3 coincides with the temperature at which reduction of MoO3 begins in He, H-2 and propene (approximate to 620 K). At temperatures below 720 K, and independent of the atmosphere used, partial reduction Of MoO3 is observed resulting in the formation of "Mo18O52" type defects in the layer structure of alpha-MoO3. At temperatures above 720 K, and under oxygen or in an oxidizing atmosphere, the "Mo18O52" type defects are reoxidized to MoO3. Evidently, the catalytically active molybdenum oxide phase develops under partial oxidation conditions at temperatures below 720 K, and does not possess the undisturbed ideal layer structure of orthorhombic alpha-MoO3. The results presented clearly show the necessity and the potential for bulk structural investigations of heterogeneous catalysts under the reaction conditions used. The bulk structure, and particularly the type and number of defects in the material ("real" structure) considerably affect the catalytic properties. Hence, in order to rationally design a most active heterogeneous catalyst, both the structure and reactions of the surface, and the structure, defects, and reactions of the bulk need to be known in detail, and carefully considered.

Fe-N-C catalysts with abundant natural merits are considered as promising alternatives to noble-based catalysts, yet further improvements are urgently needed because of their poor stability and unclear catalytic mechanism. Here, an atomic-level Fe-N-C electrocatalyst coupled with low crystalline Fe3C-Fe nanocomposite in 3D carbon matrix (Fe-SAs/Fe3C-Fe@NC) is fabricated by a facile and scalable method. Versus atomically FeNx species and crystallized Fe3C-Fe nanoparticles, Fe-SAs/Fe3C-Fe@NC catalyst, abundant in vertical branched carbon nanotubes decorated on intertwined carbon nanofibers, exhibits high electrocatalytic activities and excellent stabilities both in ORR (E-1/2, 0.927 V) and OER (E-J=10, 1.57 V). This performance benefits from the strong synergistic effects of multicomponents and the unique structural advantages. In-depth X-ray absorption fine structure analysis and density functional theory calculation further demonstrate that more extra charges derived from modified Fe clusters decisively promote the ORR/OER performance for atomically FeN4 configurations by enhanced oxygen adsorption energy. These insightful findings inspire new perspectives for the rational design and synthesis of economical-practical bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts.									72	4	0	0	4	0	72			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000504705500001	31885216

Hydrogenation by calcining in H-2 atmosphere was conducted to improve the electric conductivity, which was owing to partially reduce of Ti4+ in TNTA. It was found that hydrogenated TiO2 can facilitate the electro-deposition of IrO2, and elevate the OER activity compared to that of non-calcined and air-calcined TNTA, which would be due to the improved conductivity of H-TNTA. IrO2/H-TNTA shows a fivefold higher activity than IrO2/air-TNTA with the same loading amount. The coverage of IrO2 on the surface of hydrogenated TNTA is crucial to the stability of catalyst and with the increased loading amount of IrO2, IrO2/H-TNTA shows much higher stability.

Continuous monitoring of the evolution of moisture and carbon dioxide would offer an interesting tool for determining reaction kinetics of non-enzymatic browning and optimising roasting processes. Isothermal and dynamic heating of small specimens of hazelnuts in a differential scanning calorimeter which was linked to a non-dispersive IR gas analyser presents a possibility to simulate roasting processes on a micro-scale. Formation of water and carbon dioxide was dependant on the initial moisture content of the hazelnuts, heating rate and composition of gas atmosphere (nitrogen vs. oxygen). Depending on the heating conditions, evolution of carbon dioxide is not only caused by degradation of amino acids and sugars but also by lipid oxidation.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0009-4293			WOS:000176708000005

Some of the 2D metal phosphorous trichalcogenides (M2P2X6 or MPX3 in its simplified form) have been reported to be useful catalysts for water splitting, although results have been less promising for the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to insufficient activity or compromised stability. Herein, we report the OER catalysis of a series of M2P2X6 (M2+ = Mn, Fe, Co, Zn, Cd; X = S, Se). From the series of MPX3, CoPS3 yields the best results with an overpotential within the range of values usually obtained for IrO2 or RuO2 catalysts. The liquid-phase exfoliation of CoPS3 even improves the OER activity due to abundant active edges of the downsized sheets, accompanied by the presence of surface oxides. The influence of the OER medium and underlying substrate electrode is studied, with the exfoliated CoPS3 reaching the lowest overpotential at 234 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2), also able to sustain high current densities, with an overpotential of 388 mV at a current density of 100 mA/cm(2), and excellent stability after multiple cycles or long-term operation. Quantum chemical models reveal that these observations are likely tied to moieties on CoPS3 edges, which are responsible for low overpotentials through a two-site mechanism. The OER performance of exfoliated CoPS3 reported herein yields competitive values compared to those reported for other Co-based and MPX3 in the literature, thus holding substantial promise for use as an efficient material for the anodic water-splitting reaction.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000657202500029	33983707

The approach is based on using graphene oxide (GO) as an effective oxidizing agent fuel and microwave irradiation for reaction initiation. A well-defined perovskite structure was obtained without further calcination and the direct reduction of GO to reduced graphene oxide (RGO) was achieved. Hazardous or reducing agents were not used in this procedure. The successful preparation is confirmed by different structural, surface and spectral analyses. The obtained LaFeO3-RGO was used as an electrode material for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in both acidic and basic media. The proposed electrode showed relatively higher kinetic parameters compared to LaFeO3 prepared by microwave-assisted citrate method. LaFeO3-RGO showed a current density two orders of magnitude higher than LaFeO3. The overpotential required to reach 10 mA/cm(2) is 130 mV for LaFeO3-RGO compared to 490 mV in case of LaFeO3 prepared by microwave-assisted citrate method.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			2365-6549			WOS:000417411400057

However, the undesirable sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics limit the practical production of rechargeable Na-air batteries. Therefore, it is essential to develop highly effective bifunctional electrocatalysts for OER and ORR. Although the pyrochlore oxides (A(2)B(2)O(7)) exhibits great potential for highly-active bifunctional electrocatalyst, the lack of studies regarding to A-site cations have hindered the development of new pyrochlore catalysts with comprehensive understanding of catalytic activity. In this work, we report the use of a novel nanocrystalline bismuth ruthenate pyrochlore oxide (Bi2Ru2O7) as an effective oxygen electrocatalyst by using the favorable oxidation nature of Bi and Ru ions in Bi2Ru2O7. Further, the oxidized cations can donate the electrons to the surface and inner layers, providing the low-resistance pathway during OER and ORR. Finally, the bifunctional electrocatalytic activities of Bi2Ru2O7 are successfully translated to a practical device, an aqueous Na-air battery, for the first time.									38	2	0	0	2	0	39			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000450105700002

Results showed that the higher aluminium-oxygen concentration product at the start of deoxidation, the higher area fraction and the number density of large-sized inclusions before the slag melting, then clustered alumina-based inclusions gradually became ripening. Thermodynamic equilibrium results indicated that initial contents of the [O] were 100, 200, 300 and 400 ppm in the molten steel, then contents of the [O] at the final reaction equilibrium were 4.6, 4.9, 5.8 and 9.5 ppm, respectively. The relationship between oversaturation and size of Al2O3 inclusions showed that the larger the critical radius of nucleus, the lower the oversaturation. Meanwhile, the evolution mechanism of alumina-based inclusions during the LF refining process was also revealed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0301-9233	1743-2812		WOS:000729707600001

This study explores the influence of minor change in oxygen concentration on NO formation in the primary combustion zone under deep air-staged combustion by experimental and density functional theory (DFT). Experimental results show that there is an optimal oxygen concentration for NOx formation under the deep staged combustion. The theoretical calculation further verifies the experimental results, and reveals that char model with one hydroxyl group is more conducive to the N-2 desorption than the char model with two hydroxyl groups at the mechanism level. Oxygen changes the reaction pathway of char-NO, and the reduction of NO to N-2 is accompanied by the formation of CO or CO2. Moreover, the char and CO2 gasification reaction promotes CO formation under low oxygen condition under deep air staging. The kinetic analysis also reveals that there is an optimal concentration of oxygen in promoting C-NO heterogeneous reduction. The carbonaceous surface with one hydroxyl group enhances char reactivity and increases the desorption rate of N-2 compared to char surface without hydroxyl group. The char surface containing two hydroxyl groups promotes the retention of the pyridine nitrogen in the structurally stable aromatic ring, which greatly reduces the N-2 desorption rate and inhibits NO reduction.

Here we introduce a new Li-O-2 cell architecture that employs a catalytic polymer-based membrane between the oxygen electrode and the separator. The catalytic membrane was prepared by immobilization of Pd nanoparticles on a polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofiber membrane and is adjacent to a carbon nanotube electrode loaded with Ru nanoparticles. During oxide product formation, the insulating PAN polymer scaffold restricts direct electron transfer to the Pd catalyst particles and prevents the direct blockage of Pd catalytic sites. The modified Li-O-2 battery with a catalytic membrane showed a stable cyclability for 60 cycles with a capacity of 1000 mAh/g and a reduced degree of polarization (similar to 0.3 V) compared to cells without a catalytic membrane. We demonstrate the effects of a catalytic membrane on the reaction characteristics associated with morphological and structural features of the discharge products via detailed ex situ characterization.									63	0	0	0	4	0	63			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000348086100069	25546408

As the used tobacco lamellar systems have an average diameter of 4-5-mu-m this lag phase is interpreted to be due to an average distance of 2.4-mu-m between oxygen emitting sources and the electrode surface. This interpretation of the lag phase is substantiated by the fact that photosystem I-mediated oxygen uptake in the same preparation measured with the same amperometric technique exhibits the same lag phase although the kinetic uptake parameters are considerably slower than those of oxygen evolution due to the water-splitting reaction. The analysis of the oxygen evolution signal shows that the sedimentation time i.e. the quality of the contact of the source with the electrode is decisive for the measured value for the oxygen release time, which with this method without much effort comes out to be certainly not longer than 1.5 ms. A computer simulation shows that the distance of the oxygen emitting layer from the electrode as well as its thickness and the actual release time are variables which influence practically all parameters (signal shape, amplitude etc.) of such amperometric signals. From this it appears that the determined apparent experimental parameters of oxygen evolution kinetics contain deformations due to the thickness of the sample and the diffusion distance from the electrode. An extrapolation calculated for a sample of infinite thinness separated from the electrode by a minimal distance of 0.001-mu-m with tau of 5.5 ms yields a lower limit value for the half-rise time of 0.5 ms, a value which has been experimentally determined by EPR oximetry (K.

In this regard, numerous two-dimensional electrocatalysts such as mono/binary compounds synthesized from group IV, III-V and V elements with compatible activity towards hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, oxygen reduction and CO(2)reduction have been reported. Motivated by the novel approach of material design and the need for better and cheaper electrocatalytic materials, we have investigated the ground state properties of the GeSb monolayer using state-of-the-art density functional theory. The computed electronic properties reveal the metallic nature of the pristine GeSb monolayer, indicating its potential for utilization as an electrocatalyst. The site-dependent catalytic response of the GeSb monolayer indicates that the Sb-site is more sensitive towards hydrogen adsorption amongst the considered sites. The computed adsorption and Gibbs free energies follow the trend ofEads/GibbsSb <Eads/GibbsHollow <Eads/GibbsGe. Finally, we have investigated the role of arsenic (As) and bismuth (Bi) doping on the catalytic activity of the GeSb monolayer. We notice that the electron density modulation occurs at the Sb-site due to incorporation of substitutional doping which results in a 72% enhancement in the catalytic activity of the monolayer on As substitution. The present study envisages that the electron density modulation can be utilized as a pathway for tailoring the catalytic activity of a system for the hydrogen evolution reaction.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000571344300038	32845260

It was found that the hydrogen evolution reaction occurs by a Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism with the first step being the RDS. Moreover, the apparent energy of activation calculated from the Tafel plots presented a value as high as 150 kJ mol(-1), indicating the formation of the M-H intermediate that is characteristic for the Volmer step. On the other hand, the apparent energy of activation for the oxygen evolution reaction was found to be 106 kJ mol(-1) suggesting that the RDS in this mechanism is the initial adsorption step. In this way, it was demonstrated that the interaction between water molecules and the electrode surface is strongly inhibited on BDD thus justifying the extended potential window observed for this material.									47	0	0	0	4	6	47			0103-5053	1678-4790		WOS:000189390600003

Here, we report nanoporous (NP) (Pt1-xNix)(3)Al intermetallic nanoparticles as oxygen electroreduction catalyst NP (Pt1-xNix)(3)Al, which circumvents this problem by making use of the extraordinarily negative formation heats of Pt-Al and Ni-Al bonds.

For the latter class of catalysts, iron-doped nickel oxyhydroxide (Ni1-xFexOOH) has shown promise for replacing precious-metal-based catalysts such as RuO2 and IrO2 for alkaline water electrolysis. Recently, we used first-principles quantum mechanics to illuminate the precise roles of Fe and Ni in this compound with respect to the mechanism of oxygen evolution. From periodic density functional theory using a screened-exchange hybrid exchange-correlation functional, we identified that the combined abilities of Fe to form an optimally metastable terminal oxo as Fe(IV)=O and Ni(III)'s relatively facile reduction to Ni(II) yield a very low overpotential OER In pursuit of other dopant(s) that can form other such optimal terminal oxos, here we assess the oxygen evolution mechanism and energetics when alternatively doping the beta-NiOOH((1) over bar2 (1) over bar1) surface, a catalytically active facet, with other first-row TMs, namely, V, Cr, Mn, and Co, and some second-row TMs, namely, Mo, Ru, and Rh. These dopants were chosen because their cations are known to form terminal oxos of varying strengths, and some are known to form oxides that are effective OER catalysts. Rather than finding an alternative dopant better than Fe, this study further confirms the unique chemistry of Fe that brings optimal OER activity. Co is found to be a competitive alternative to Fe, with only 0.07 V higher predicted thermodynamic overpotential. More importantly, this study also reveals the strong influence of Ni(III) on the oxidation state of the dopants, in that most dopants investigated could oxidize spontaneously to their respective high oxidation states, while lattice Ni(III) ion(s) reduce(s) concomitantly to Ni(II). Of note, V, Cr, Mo, Ru, and Rh could easily form +5, +6, +6, +7, and +5 TM-oxo groups, respectively. The enhanced stability of these high-oxidation-state cations due to the Ni(III)/Ni(II) redox render these dopants inactive toward reductive elimination of O-2, except for V, and thus we predict that they will be ineffective OER catalysts.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400035

Designing electrocatalysts with excellent performance and affordable price is promising to accelerate the reaction process and large-scale application. At present, ruthenium (Ru)-based nanomaterials have shown similar catalytic activity but superior price demand compared to commercial Pt/C. This undoubtedly makes Ru-based nanomaterials a perfect candidate to replace advanced Pt catalysts. Significant progress is made in the rational design of Ru-based electrocatalysts, but an in-depth understanding of the engineering strategies and induced effects is still at an early stage. This review summarizes the modification strategies for enhancing the catalytic activity of Ru, including surface structure, metal element, nonmetal element, size, bimetallic oxides, and heterostructure engineering strategies. Then the induced electronic modulation effects generated by the intramolecular and intermolecular of the Ru-based nanomaterials are elucidated. Further, the application progress of engineered Ru-based nanomaterials for hydrogen and oxygen conversion reactions is highlighted, and the correlations of engineering strategies, catalytic activity, and reaction pathways are elaborated. Finally, challenges and prospects are presented for the future development and practical application of Ru-based nanomaterials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000848790000001

Operations using such SS-bearing materials proceed under substantial overpotentials above the thermodynamic requirement due to the sluggish kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Traditional surface engineering of SS involves a corrosion process to optimize its composition and modify its surface morphology, but its catalytic properties remain unsatisfactory even after employing this technique. Here, we introduce an effective route, based on surface decoration, to construct a ternary phase composed of nickel iron selenide (NiFeSe) uniformly distributed on a stainless-steel mat (SSM). NiFeSe/SSM was found to require an overpotential of only 260 mV to drive a current density of 1,000 mA cm(-2) at 75 degrees C in alkaline solution, one of the best results among SS-based and even transition metal-based catalysts for OER. Additionally, this NiFeSe/SSM electrode shows negligible potential degradation after operating at 1,000 mA cm(-2) for 55 h. It is suggested that Se in the nickel iron selenide directly binds to the SSM through strong covalent bonding during selenization, which guarantees low charge-transfer resistance and excellent durability against the gas bubbles produced during operation at large current densities. This work opens a new route for performing surface engineering on SS or other conductive substrates to achieve superior OER performance. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

It is argued that the field of chemical reaction processes on solid surfaces has recently been paying increasing attention to the fundamental understanding of electrified solid-liquid interfaces and toward the operando study of the minute fraction of catalytically active, structurally dynamic non-equilibrium Taylor-type surface sites. Meanwhile, despite mounting evidence of acting as structural proxies in some cases, the concept of catalytic structure sensitivity of well-defined nanoscale solid surfaces continues to be a key organizing principle for the science of shape-controlled nanocrystals and, hence, constitutes a central recurring theme in this review. After addressing key aspects and recent progress in the wet-chemical synthesis of shaped nanocatalysts, three areas of electrocatalytic processes on solid shape-controlled nanocrystals of current scientific priority are discussed in more detail: the oxygen electroreduction on shape-controlled Pt-Ni polyhedra with its technological relevance for low temperature fuel cells, the CO2 electroreduction to hydrocarbons on Cu polyhedra and the puzzling interplay between chemical and structural effects, and the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction from water on shaped transition metal oxides. The review closes with the conclusion that Surface Science and thermal catalysis, honored by Ertl's Nobel prize a decade ago, continue to show major repercussions on the emerging field of Interface Science.									95	6	0	0	4	0	95			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000424136900005	29354840

Nickel hydroxide, Ni(OH)(2), was deposited on such nickel/epoxy surfaces by means of successive voltammetric cycles and galvanostatic reduction. Likewise, the same hydroxide was grown on polycrystalline nickel surfaces. The responses of such electrochemical systems was studied in KOH(aq) at several concentrations as well as in saturated Ca(OH)(2(aq)). Ni(OH)(2) grown on nickel/epoxy surfaces exhibited different potentiodynamic i-E profile and cathodic charges, which are largely affected by nickel/epoxy ratio, potential sweep rate and solution pH. The oxygen evolution on these types of electrodes is consistent with alpha-Ni(OH)(2) structure obtained by means of the voltammetric method.

Benefited from the unique skeletons full of micro/meso/macropores with effective site accessibility and mass transport, the nanoreactors exhibit a remarkable performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the overall pH range. Especially, the overpotential (eta) of such nanoreactors for alkaline HER is only 25 mV@10 mA cm(-2) with an ultrahigh turnover frequency (TOF) value of 2.04 H-2 S-1 at eta= 50 mV, greatly surpassing benchmark Pt/C. Moreover, the further conversed RuO2 catalyst well retains the hierarchical porous merits, showing prominent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. Taking advantages of their opulent exposed active sites and efficient charge/mass transport route of both kinds of the nanoreactors, the two-electrode device was constructed for efficient overall water splitting, demonstrating remarkably high H-2 generation rates in varied-pH media.									26	0	0	0	2	0	25			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000708026300003

A bifunctional catalyst is synthesized hydrothermally by coating hollow-net structure metal-onto various lengths of CNTs. For further improvements of the bifunctional performance of hybrid catalysts, an oxidation approach is adopted to introduce sufficient oxygen-containing groups onto the surface of CNTs in a KMnO4 solution. The chemically treated Co3O4/CNTs catalysts supply 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential (eta(over)) of 411 mV with strong OER activity and exhibit comparable OER performance with the highly active Ir/C catalyst (eta(over): 410 mV). For the ORR activity, the Co3O4/CNTs catalysts show on-set and half-wave potentials around 0.84 V and 0.66 V, respectively. The Co3O4/ox-CNTs has an oxygen electrode activity of 1.044 V and compares favorably to the other transition metal-based nanostructures and precious metal electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the hybrid Co3O4/CNTs catalysts show excellent durability for long periods of OER and ORR conditions (by the potential cycling). This excellent bifunctional performance is attributed to the enhanced incorporation of conducting CNT frameworks between neighboring Co3O4 nanoparticles during chemical functionalization.

Herein, we systematically studied the kinetic behavior of a Li-O-2 battery comprising perovskite La0.8Sr0.2VO3 nanofibers formed by partial Sr-cation doping and V cations with multiple oxidation states. Compared with undoped LaVO3 and La0.8Sr0.2VO4 nanofibers, perovskite La0.8Sr0.2VO3 nanofibers exhibited an improved capacity of 2000 mA g(-1), and a 20-times-longer cycle life in Li-O-2 batteries. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and photoluminescence analyses revealed that the performance variations mainly originated from crystal defects, which modulate oxygen reduction/evolution kinetics. Through in situ Raman analysis, we showed that these structural defects are closely related to the oxygen reduction/evolution behavior of La0.8Sr0.2VO3 nanofibers and result in fewer parasitic reactions. This study offers insights into the potential rate capability of Li-O-2 batteries and related devices.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9				2567-3165		WOS:000688968400001

Upon increasing the salt concentration towards superconcentration the onset of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) shifts more significantly than the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) does. The OER shift has been explained by the accumulation of hydrophobic anions blocking water access to the electrode surface, hence by double layer theory. Here we demonstrate that the processes during oxidation are much more complex, involving OER, carbon and salt decomposition by OER intermediates, and salt precipitation upon local oversaturation. The positive shift in the onset potential of oxidation currents was elucidated by combining several advanced analysis techniques: rotating ring-disk electrode voltammetry, online electrochemical mass spectrometry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, using both dilute and superconcentrated electrolytes. The results demonstrate the importance of reactive OER intermediates and surface films for electrolyte and electrode stability and motivate further studies of the nature of the electrode.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000657724200001

A catalyst with outstanding oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction catalytic activity is required. Here, in-situ growth ZIF-67 within three-dimensional nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (3D-N/rGO) layers was used to investigate a bifunctional catalyst. The inner space is supported by ZIF-67 particles, while 3D-N/rGO extends a suitable three-phase reaction interface and enhances O2 adsorbability. When assembled battery with normal electrolyte, it delivered a high specific capacity of 12028 mAh g-1, and stabilised for 203 cycles at 200 mA g-1 with a limited capacity of 500 mAh g- 1. When LiBr-gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) was used instead of electrolyte the lithium metal anode, the polarisation value of LiBr-GPE in Li/Li batteries was only about 0.0384 V after continuous working for 1600 h. When used as a cathode catalyst in Li-O2 batteries, the electrode performance was doubled compared with using the normal electrolyte. These findings pave the way for developing of all-encompassing battery materials with high capacity and long cycle life.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000743559700003

Herein, cobalt layered double hydroxide decorated with sub-1 nm platinum clusters (Pt/Co-LDH) were synthesized for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The integration of platinum unexpectedly induced unique nanocage structures assembled by ultra-thin LDH nanosheets via an in-situ redox process. The as-prepared Pt/Co-LDH nanocages exhibit high OER activity with a low overpotential of 265 mV at 10 mA cm-2. Experiments and density functional theory calculations indicate the high catalytic activity is mainly attributed to the strong interactions between Pt and Co-LDH, which can regulate the local coordination environment and electronic structures of cobalt. The well-defined Co-Pt-OH structures could help promote the adsorption energy of water molecules and reduce the energy barrier of rate-limiting step, benefiting from the enhanced electron transfer during the electrocatalytic process, playing the role of ldquoelectronic pumprdquo. Furthermore, the novel in-situ redox synthetic strategy also presents a facile universality to obtain metal-doped (Pt, Au, Pd) Co-LDH nanocage structures.

An aprotic Li-O-2 battery is made of a Li-metal anode, an aprotic electrolyte, and an O-2-breathing cathode. The aprotic electrolyte is a solution of lithium salt with aprotic solvent; and porous carbon is commonly used as the cathode substrate. To improve the performance, an electrocatalyst is deposited onto the porous carbon substrate by certain deposition methods, such as atomic layer deposition (ALD) and wet-chemistry reaction. The as-prepared cathode materials are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES). A Swagelok-type cell, sealed in a glass chamber filled with pure O-2, is used for the electrochemical test on a battery test system. The cells are tested under either capacity-controlled mode or voltage controlled mode. The reaction products are investigated by electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy to study the possible pathway of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This protocol demonstrates a systematic and efficient arrangement of routine tests of the aprotic Li-O-2 battery, including the electrochemical test and characterization of battery materials.									2	1	0	0	0	0	2			1940-087X			WOS:000385622600019	27501292

This stimulates the search for earth-abundant alternatives to replace noble metal electrocatalysts. Hence, in this study, we investigate a novel and low-cost bifunc-tional electrocatalyst consisting of ZnCoMnO4 anchored on nitrogen-doped graphene oxide (ZnCoMnO4/ N-rGO). Benefiting from the strong Co-N interaction in ZnCoMnO4 and the coupled conductive N-rGO, the catalysts exhibit high electrocatalytic activity. Moreover, density functional theory calculations support the dominant role of the strong Co-N electronic interaction, which leads to ZnCoMnO4/N-rGO having more favorable binding energies with O-2 and H2O, resulting in fast reaction kinetics. The obtained ZnCoMnO4/N-rGO electrocatalyst exhibits superb bifunctional activity, with a half-wave potential of 0.83 V for the oxygen reduction reaction and a low onset potential of 1.57 V for the oxygen evolution reaction in 0.1 M KOH solution. Furthermore, a Zn-air battery driven by the ZnCoMnO4/N-rGO catalyst shows remarkable discharge/charge performance, with a power density of 138.52 mW cm(-2) and long-term cycling stability for 48 h. This work provides a promising multifunctional electrocatalyst based on non-noble metals for the storage and conversion of renewable energy.

Here, we report on a novel hierarchical Cu@CoFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) core-shell nanostructure catalyst for efficient overall water splitting in the alkaline medium. Benefiting from the smart structure, the optimized composite affords small overpotentials of 171 mV for the HER and 240 mV for the OER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), along with Tafel slopes of 36.4 and 44.4 mV dec(-1) for the HER and OER, respectively. Strikingly, the overall water splitting performance is very good since it just requires a voltage of 1.681 V to gain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is only 60 mV larger than the benchmark of IrO2 (+)/Pt (-) electrodes. Moreover, the optimized composite electrodes exhibit outstanding durability within 48 h testing, which is much better than that of the benchmark. Our rational design of the hierarchical core-shell nanoarchitectures presents a simple approach to fabricate advanced catalysts for water splitting.									183	9	0	0	2	0	183			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000415302600035		
J	Wang, Si; Ma, Jialing; Chen, Lifang; Zhang, Xin								Role of Synergistic Effect in Oxygen Evolution Reaction over Layered Double Hydroxide								ACTA CHIMICA SINICA				79	2			216	222		10.6023/A20090435				FEB 15 2021	2021	Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) has played an important role in the field of catalysis because of its high dispersion of active sites, adjustable layer elements, and exchangeable interlayer anions. LDHs show excellent catalytic activity in oxygen evolution reaction (OER), due to the specific synergistic effect of double metals site. Thus, it is crucial to reveal the role of synergistic effect for promoting catalytic performance of photocatalyst and electrocatalyst. Although great efforts from experimental workers have been devoted to exploring the types and ratios of bimetals in LDHs, the role of synergistic effect on OER is still unclear. In this work, we systematically investigated the synergistic mechanism and the role of synergistic effect on OER performances based on density functional theory calculation plus U (DFf -FU) method. Five kinds of LDHs (M32+N3+-LDH (M2+ =Co2+, Ni2+; N3+ =Al3+, Cr3+, Mn3+, Fe3+)) were built to study the synergistic effect from different bimetal. The results showed that oxygen species is bridged by one M2+ and one N3+ metal, forming a stable adsorption structure. For electrocatalytic OER, the synergistic effect of the bimetallic sites decreased the free energy change of the potential-determining step, and further reduces the overpotential of the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction. Therein, Ni3Fe-LDH has the lowest overpotential, exhibiting superior electrocatalytic OER activity among the five LDHs. This is not the case in photocatalytic OER, the synergy of bimetals affects the band gap, work function and driving force of LDHs, which determine the ability of LDH photocatalytic OER. The five types of LDH studied are all visible light response, and Ni3Cr-LDH is predicted to be a good OER photocatalyst in view of its higher driving force than the overpotential. This work reveals the synergistic effect of bimetal in LDH on OER activity from a micro-atomic level, which will provide theoretical insights for the design of novel LDH-based catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7351			WOS:000625364500011

In bimetallic nanoalloys with well-defined shape, site-dependent metal surface segregation additionally affects the catalytic activity and stability. However, segregation on shaped alloy nanocatalysts and their atomic-scale evolution is largely unexplored. Exemplified by three octahedral PtxNi1-x alloy nanoparticle electrocatalysts with unique activity for the oxygen reduction reaction at fuel cell cathodes, we reveal an unexpected compositional segregation structure across the {111} facets using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy-loss spectroscopy. In contrast to theoretical predictions, the pristine PtxNi1-x nano-octahedra feature a Pt-rich frame along their edges and corners, whereas their Ni atoms are preferentially segregated in their {111} facet region. We follow their morphological and compositional evolution in electrochemical environments and correlate this with their exceptional catalytic activity. The octahedra preferentially leach in their facet centres and evolve into 'concave octahedra'. More generally, the segregation and leaching mechanisms revealed here highlight the complexity with which shape-selective nanoalloys form and evolve under reactive conditions.									925	49	0	0	72	0	940			1476-1122	1476-4660		WOS:000322119100025	23770725

However, the dispersed nature of QDs fundamentally prohibits the efficient charge transfer in various catalytic processes. Here, we report efficient and robust electrocatalytic oxygen evolution based on defective and highly conductive copper selenide (CuSe) QDs confined in an amorphous carbon matrix with good uniformity (average diameter 4.25 nm) and a high areal density (1.8 x 10(12) cm(-2)). The CuSe QD-confined catalysts with abundant selenide vacancies were prepared by using a pulsed laser deposition system benefitted by high substrate temperature and ultrahigh vacuum growth conditions, as evidenced by electron paramagnetic resonance characterizations. An ultra-low charge transfer resistance (about 7 omega) determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement indicates the efficient charge transfer of CuSe quantum-confined catalysts, which is guaranteed by its high conductivity (with a low resistivity of 2.33 mu omega middotm), as revealed by electrical transport measurements. Our work provides a universal design scheme of the dispersed QD-based composite catalysts and demonstrates the CuSe QD-confined catalysts as an efficient and robust electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000850659800001	36040248

In proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers it plays a pivotal role for electrochemical energy conversion, yet sluggish kinetics and the corrosive environment during operation still compel significant advances in electrode materials to enable a widespread application. Up-to-date Iridium is known as the best catalyst material for the OER in acidic media due to its relatively high activity and long-term stability. However, scarcity of iridium drives the development of strategies for its efficient utilization. One promising way would be the formation of mixtures in which the noble catalyst element is dispersed in the non-noble matrix of more stable metals or metal oxides. A promising valve metal oxide is TiOx, yet the degree to which performance can be optimized by composition is still unresolved. Thus, using a scanning flow cell connected to an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer, we examined the activity and stability for the OER of an oxidized Ir-Ti thin film material library covering the composition range from 20-70 at.% of Ir. We find that regardless of the composition the rate of Ir dissolution is observed to be lower than that of thermally prepared IrO2. Moreover, mixtures containing at least 50 at.% of Ir exhibit reactivity comparable to IrO2. Their superior performance is discussed with complementary information obtained from atomic scale and electronic structure analysis using atom probe tomography and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Overall, our data shows that Ir-Ti mixtures can be promising OER catalysts with both high activity and high stability.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			2515-7655			WOS:000637835800001

Here, we report the formation of cobalt (Co) nanoparticles and thin graphitic N-doped carbon (NC) supported on three-dimensional hierarchically porous graphene-like carbon (Co-NC/3DHPGC) to maximize the accessibility of Co-NC active sites for oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER). The produced Co-NC/3DHPGC exhibits a broad size distribution (5-30 nm) of Co nanoparticles dispersed on the external surface of 3DHPGC and coated with NC to a thickness of similar to 2 nm. We attributed the formation of Co nanoparticles with broad size distribution to the hierarchical porosity of 3DHPGC, which served as a cage to stabilize the Co nanoparticles and increase the metal dispersion; the produced Co nanoparticles catalyze the formation of graphitic NC. Compared with commercial Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts, the resultant Co-NC/3DHPGC exhibits excellent bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalytic activity and high durability. The high electrocatalytic performance is ascribed to the accessibility of highly active Co-NC sites through mesopores of 3DHPGC.

Herein, the dysprosium (Dy) doped copper oxide (Cu1-xDyxO) nanoparticles were synthesized via solution combustion technique and utilized as a non-noble metal based bi-functional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. Due to the improved surface to volume ratio and conductivity, the optimized Cu1-xDyxO (x = 0.01, 0.02) electrocatalysts exhibited impressive HER and OER performance respectively in 1 M KOH delivering a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) at a potential of -0.18 V vs RHE for HER and 1.53 V vs RHE for OER. Moreover, the Dy doped CuO electrocatalyst used as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting achieved a potential of 1.56 V at a current density 10 mA cm(-2) and relatively high current density of 66 mAcm(-2) at a peak potential of 2 V. A long term stability of 24 h was achieved for a cell voltage of 2.2 V at a constant current density of 30 mAcm(-2) with only 10% of the initial current loss. This showcases the accumulative opportunity of dysprosium as a dopant in CuO nanoparticles for fabricating a highly effective and low-cost bi-functional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting.

A major challenge associated with this process is the development of cheap, simple, and environmentally benign catalysts that lead to a minimum overpotential for water oxidation. Inspired by the Mn4CaOx cluster that catalyzes water oxidation in photosystemII, described here is the synthesis and characterization of the manganese cluster [Mn12O12(O2CC6H2(OH)(3))(16)(H2O)(4)] (Mn12TH) along with its electrocatalytic activity at pH 6. Electrochemical, spectroscopic, and electron microscopy studies show that Mn12TH is a homogeneous electrocatalyst for water oxidation and enables oxygen evolution with a reaction rate of 22 s(-1), high Faradic efficiency (93%), and an overpotential of only 74 mV, the lowest reported to date. Based on the electrochemical data, the organic ligands, which can be described as the second coordination sphere of the catalytic manganese core, play a key role in facilitating the oxidation process and accelerating the reaction.									32	2	0	0	0	0	32			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000459807200039	30648785

Herein, we demonstrate the possibility of enhancing the electrochemical activity of MOF-derived binary metal center catalysts by controlling the form of the Fe species. The introduction of Fe-SBU (iron 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid) into ZIF-67 is found to induce a distinct confinement effect and this can be exploited to improve the electroconductivity of binary metal center catalysts, and therefore, to reduce the OER reaction barrier (OOH* -> O*). When applied as an OER catalyst in 1 M KOH solution, the Fe-SBU@Co-Matrix catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 249 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and high stability for over 40 h. This work describes the secondary growth treatment of MOF-derived porous carbons to promote their application as catalysts in energy conversion reactions.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000610368100064	33404029

In this study, a new Pt SA strongly coupled with amorphous MoOX (Pt-SA/-MoOX) is rationally designed. The synergistic effect between unsaturated Pt atoms and defective MoOX can significantly lower the reaction barrier contributing to the fast HER reaction kinetics. Hence, Pt-SA/alpha-MoOX exhibits an ultrahigh mass activity of 52.0 A mgPt1 at an overpotential of 50 mV, corresponding to better acidic HER activity than those reported previously for Pt SA-based catalysts. Furthermore, PtSA/alpha-MoOX shows Pt-like kinetics with a small Tafel slope of 123 mV dec 1 and outstanding long-term electrochemical stability for 20 h. This developed synthetic method is also extended for the fabrication of other amorphous MoOX-supported SA catalysts (e.g. Ir, Au and Pb). As far as we know, our study reports the first example of the combination of metal SA and amorphous oxide for highly efficient electrocatalysis.									92	9	0	0	9	0	92			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000521052900011

Herein, the recent achievements in establishing interfacial interactions between cocatalysts and semiconducting light absorbers to improve the efficiency of these reactions are focused on. Four kinds of interactions are summarized to clarify the accelerated photogenerated charge carrier kinetics, thereby resulting in enhanced activity of these redox reactions. Especially, the coordination interaction formed by chemical linkage seems to be more preferred because of a well-provided tunnel for charge transfer. The extended applications of these interfacial interactions to other challenging reactions, such as N-2 fixation and organic synthesis, are also predicted.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2367-198X			WOS:000664892000001

Understanding the OER and ORR mechanisms and identifying a catalyst design principle that connects the properties of materials with catalytic activity can speed up the search for highly active and abundant metal-oxide catalysts to replace costly platinum. In this report, the OER and ORR mechanisms involving a redox cycle of LaNi1-xFexO3 perovskite-oxide catalysts for the zinc-air battery (ZAB) in alkaline media are presented. Here, we demonstrate that the electrocatalytic activity toward OER/ORR of LaNi1-xFexO3 catalysts is primarily correlated with their reduction rate (log upsilon(red,25)), such as the shape of a volcano. In addition, the OER/ORR activities of rapidly oxidized catalysts (LaNi1-xFexO3, where x = 0.5, 0.7, 0.9) and rapidly reduced catalysts (LaNi1-xFexO3, where x = 0, 0.1, 0.3) are linearly associated with their reduction rates and oxidation rates, respectively. The Tafel plot and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) analyses suggest that the activation of OH, a charge transfer from the catalyst, is a rate-determining step, which implies that the rapidly oxidized catalyst and rapidly reduced catalyst control the rate of OER and ORR redox cycles, respectively. Furthermore, the LaNi0.5Fe0.5O3 catalyst appearing high on the volcano-shaped plot exhibits high OER/ORR activities, and thus highlights the importance of the electronic structure in controlling the perovskite-oxide catalytic activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000671845100001

We present a model that describes the coupling of colored oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst thin films with semiconductor photoelectrodes. We use this model to define an "optocatalytic" efficiency (Phi(o-c)) based on experimental optical and electrokinetic data collected in basic solution. Because transition-metal oxides, hydroxides, and oxyhydroxides often exhibit electrochromism, in situ spectroelectrochemistry is used to quantify the optical absorption of active NiOx, CoOx, NiCoOx, Ni0.9Fe0.1Ox, and IrOx catalyst films at OER potentials. For the highest-activity Ni0.9Fe0.1Ox catalyst, Phi(o-c) is maximized (0.64) for a thickness of similar to 0.4 nm (similar to 2 monolayers). This work quantitatively shows that ultrathin catalyst films are appropriate to optimize the performance of water-splitting photoelectrodes and thus assists in the design and study of efficient photoelectrochemical water-splitting devices.									119	4	0	0	18	0	120			1948-7185			WOS:000316772900015	26291358

The single-atom catalyst (SAC) is a breakthrough in industrial catalysis because of the advantages of maximum metal atom utilization, single active sites, strong metal-support interactions, and great potential to accomplish high catalytic performance and selectivity. Herein, we investigate the electrocatalytic performance of a series of SACs supported on a phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) cluster for the HER, OER, and ORR by using first-principles-based calculations. It has been found that the most plausible binding site for the single-metal adatoms is the 4-fold hollow (4H) site over the PMA cluster. Due to the higher stability and catalytic activity of single-metal adatoms, fast electron transfer kinetics is permissible through catalysis. Mainly, Pt-1/PMA, Ru-1/PMA, V-1/PMA, and Ti-1/PMA realized decent catalytic performance toward the HER due to nearly ideal (Delta G(H)* = 0)Delta G(H)* values via the Volmer-Heyrovsky pathway. The Co-1/PMA (0.45 V) and Pt-1/PMA (0.49 V) can be active and selective catalysts for the OER with their overpotentials comparable those of to MoC2, IrO2, and RuO2. Among the considered candidates, a non-noble metal Fe-1/PMA SAC is a promising electrocatalyst for the ORR with an overpotential of 0.42 V, which is lower than that for the most favorable Pt (0.45 V) catalyst. Furthermore, Pt-1/PMA is an auspicious multifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting (-0.02 V for the HER and 0.49 V for the OER) and a metal-air battery (0.79 V for the ORR) catalyst. The current study is further extended to calculate the kinetic potential energy barrier for the excellent catalytic performance of Co-1 for the OER and Fe-1 for the ORR. The results suggest that the kinetic activation barrier values in all proton-coupled electron transfer steps are in good agreement with the thermodynamic results. It was revealed that the PMA cluster is a promising single-atom support for the HER, OER, and ORR and provides low-cost and highly efficient electrocatalytic activity under normal reaction conditions.									49	2	0	0	0	0	48			2155-5435			WOS:000674927200049

This is because Ni(OH)(2)has a good high rate discharge ability performance, wide operation and storage temperature range and relatively low. However, the Ni(OH)(2)positive electrode exhibits poor performance which results from (i) competitive reactions of the oxidation of the active material and evolution of oxygen. (ii) The reduced charge acceptance of Ni(OH)(2)positive electrode is suspected to be related to a relatively long distance between Ni(OH)(2)particles and the nearest portion of the substrate. In this study, electrodes are prepared using beta-Ni(OH)(2)powder as the active electrode material, hot-pressed onto a nickel mesh current collector. The Ni(2+)in the compound beta-Ni(OH)(2)material is partially substituted with Co(2+)and Al(3+)metals and the performance of as-prepared materials are optimized and examined. XRD, FTIR, TG-DTA, SEM/EDS, and ICP confirms the formation of the expected compositions. The samples with 5 wt.% Co2+, and 10 wt.% Al(3+)metals are found to be the optimal compositions with promising electrochemical activities. The modification of Ni(OH)(2)by the partial substitution of Co(2+)and Al(3+)metals for Ni(2+)shows some effect on the redox peaks of Ni(OH)(2)and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). E.g. the onset for oxidation of the active material is significantly improved with partial substitution of Ni(2+)by Co2+. On the other hand partial substitution of Ni(2+)with Al(3+)moves the onset of electrode oxidation to higher potential. In addition, the partial substitution of 10 wt.% Al(3+)metal improves both discharge capacity (from 128 mAh/g to 170 mAh/g), and the coulombic efficiency (from 87 % to 93 %) of the beta-Ni(OH)(2)electrode.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1040-0397	1521-4109		WOS:000567386500001

Flower-like nanostructures of Au@Pd bound to TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanocrystals (TCNC-Au@Pd) were decorated on amino-functionalized graphene (NH2-RGO) without losing their unique structure, allowing them to be deployed as an efficient, reusable and a green alternative heterogeneous catalyst. The decisive role of TCNC in the structural metamorphosis of nanoparticle morphology were inferred from the structural and morphology analyses. According to our study, the presence of -OH rich TCNC appears to play a pivotal role in the structured evolution of intricate nanostructure morphology. The feasibility of the bio-supported catalyst has been investigated in two concurrently prevalent model catalytic reactions, namely the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the reduction of 4-nitrophenol, the best model reactions in fuel cell and industrial catalytic applications, respectively.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0144-8617	1879-1344		WOS:000836777700007	35725192

Herein, it is demonstrated that the surface corrosion of a conventional Ni foam electrode in the presence of Fe3+ and V3+ cations can transform it into an electrode with a high catalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The corroded electrode consists of a ternary NiFeV layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheet array supported on the Ni foam surface. This NiFeV LDH electrode achieves an OER current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 272 mV in 1 m KOH, outperforming the IrO2 catalyst by 180 mV. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the unique structure and the presence of vanadium in NiFeV LDH play a key role in achieving improved OER activity. When coupled with a commercial Pt/C cathode catalyst, the resulting AEM water electrolyzer achieves a cell current density as high as 2.1 A cm(-2) at a voltage of only 1.8 V-cell in 1 m KOH, which is similar to the performance of the proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer obtained from the IrO2 and Pt/C catalysts pair.									15	1	0	0	0	0	16			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000657391500001	34081402

Although there are many such important reactions, this contribution focuses on the fundamental aspects of photocatalytic water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen by using light from the solar spectrum, which is one of the most investigated photosynthetic reactions. Photocatalytic water splitting using solar energy is considered to be artificial photosynthesis that produces a solar fuel because the reaction mimics nature's photosynthesis not only in its redox reaction type but also in its thermodynamics (water splitting: 1.23 eV vs glucose formation: 1.24 eV). To achieve efficient photocatalytic water splitting, all of the parameters, though involved at different time scales and spatial resolutions, should be optimized because the overall efficiency is obtained as the multiplication of all these fundamental efficiencies. The purpose of this Review is to provide the guidelines of a concept, "photocatalysis by design", which is the opposite of "black box screening"; this concept refers to making quantitative descriptions of the associated physical and chemical properties to determine which events/parameters have the most impact on improving the overall photocatalytic performance, in contrast to arbitrarily ranking different photocatalyst materials. First, the properties that can be quantitatively measured or calculated are identified. Second, the quantities of these identified properties are determined by performing adequate measurements and/or calculations. Third, the obtained values of these properties are integrated into equations so that the kinetic/energetic bottlenecks of specific properties/processes can be determined, and the properties can then be altered to further improve the process. Accumulation of knowledge ranging in fields from solid-state physics to electrochemistry and the use of a multidisciplinary approach to conduct measurements and modeling in a quantitative manner are required to fully understand and improve the efficiency of photocatalysis.									438	15	0	0	22	0	441			2155-5435			WOS:000414724700074

Herein, N-doped carbon coated Ni-Mo-N nanowire arrays supported on a nickel foam substrate (NC/Ni-Mo-N/NF) are constructed as a bifunctional electrocatalyst to facilitate electrocatalytic hydrogen production and selectively oxidize glycerol to formate simultaneously. With the desirable structural and compositional advantages of modified surface properties, optimized electronic structure, and Ni/Ni0.2Mo0.8N interfacial synergy effect, the resultant self-supported NC/Ni-Mo-N/NF electrode displays excellent electrocatalytic performance for both the hydrogen evolution reaction and glycerol oxidation reaction in alkaline conditions. Remarkably, the NC/Ni-Mo-N/NF||NC/Ni-Mo-N/NF two-electrode system needs only a cell voltage of 1.38 V at 10 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH containing 0.1 M glycerol, much lower than that of conventional overall water splitting system (1.57 V at 10 mA cm-2).									26	0	0	0	0	0	26			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000697031500002

E,Z-isomerizations triggered by O-2 and visible light are a new area of potential synthetic interest. The reaction involves the reversible addition of O-2 to form a peroxy intermediate with oxygen evolution and partial regeneration of the compound as its isomer. Targeting of O-2-dependent photoisomerizations also relates to a practical use of visible light, for example the improved light penetration depth for visible as opposed to UV photons in batch sensitized reactions. This review is intended to draw a link between visible-light formation of a peroxy intermediate and its dark degradation with O-2 release for unsaturated compound isomerization. This review should be of interest both to photochemists and synthetic organic chemists, as it ties together mechanistic and synthetic work, drawing attention to an overlooked subject.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			1477-0520	1477-0539		WOS:000592313200002	33155598

The limitations of the Sabatier principle could be overcome by tuning the interaction strength between the OER intermediates and the surface for the individual reaction steps via switching of the polarization direction. InSnO2N, a newly reported improper ferroelectric semiconductor, is promising for applications as a photocatalyst due to its direct band gap of 1.61 eV and its sizable ferroelectric polarization. Therefore, in this work, we use density functional theory to investigate the OER performance on its (001) surface as a function of the bulk polarization direction. We find that the clean surface of the downward (negatively) polarized bulk structure ("polarized bulk" henceforth) has a lower theoretical overpotential of eta = 0.58 V versus the standard hydrogen electrode compared to the clean surface with an upward (positively) polarized bulk structure (0.77 V). Under (photo)-electrochemical operating conditions, a monolayer (ML) OH-covered surface is the most stable for the negatively polarized bulk and shows a theoretical overpotential of 0.89 V, whereas for the positively polarized bulk structure, a surface covered with 2/3 ML OH is the most stable, also showing an overpotential of 0.89 V. Notably, when switching the polarization direction during the reaction, the overpotential becomes as small as 0.20 V for the clean surface and 0.23 V for the surface with the OH coverage, which is far below the usual minimum theoretical overpotential for oxides (eta = 0.37 V). We show that the reduction in reaction free energy by ferroelectric switching can be performed in a relevant frequency range and outweighs the energetic cost for polarization switching by a factor of 6-12. Our study demonstrates that switching of improper ferroelectricity is a highly promising route to boost the OER activity of oxynitride photocatalytic water splitting electrodes.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000709692900025

The "accelerated service life test" (ASLT) was performed for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), as well as for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and compared to that recorded for the Ni coating (Ni-dep) and Ni-mesh for both reactions. The morphology and chemical compositions of the NiSn and Ni coatings were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), while their surface composition was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) before and after the ASLT for both reactions, respectively. By measuring the potential at j = 0.3 A cm (-2) it was shown that during the ASLT the NiSn alloy coating catalytic activity for the HER decreases (about 24 mV after 25 cycles), while the catalytic activity for the OER increases (about 50 mV after 25 cycles), so that the cell voltage decreases for about 26 mV. The Ni-dep and Ni-mesh electrodes catalytic activity was found to increase for the HER (for about 103 mV), as well as for the OER (for about 52 mV) during the ASLT. Hence, the cell voltage for the Ni-dep and Ni-mesh electrodes decreased from 2.402 V to 2.245 V during the ASLT, while that for the NiSn electrode decreased from 1.967 V to 1.941 V. The cell voltage saving with the NiSn electrodes amounts to about 435 mV before the ASLT and about 304 mV after the ASLT. SEM results showed that no changes in the morphology of as prepared samples could be detected after the ASLTs for both reactions. EDS analysis confirmed that some changes occurred during the ASLT, particularly for the oxygen content in the surface layer. Similar conclusions were made from the XPS analysis.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000435619700003

The obtained samples were composed of N, P-doped MoC, Mo2C, and porous carbon fibers. Compared with each moiety, the composited samples have exhibited greatly improved electrocatalytic activities for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). As a result, the optimized MoxC-NPC-1.0-800 catalyst exhibits only 125/71 mV of overpotential at 10 mAmiddotcm-2 and superior stability in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH, respectively, which outperforms most of the reported analogous catalysts. In addition, a theoretical simulation has confirmed that N, P doping can significantly reduce |Delta GH*| for hydrogen adsorption of MoC and Mo2C and consequently enhance the electrocatalytic activity of the catalysts for HER greatly. This work provides a convenient avenue for fabricating highly efficient composite electrocatalysts of nonmetallic element doped metallic carbide and graphitic carbon.

However, the performance of pristine hematite semiconductors is unsatisfactory due to charge recombination occurring at different interfaces: back contact, bulk and semiconductor/electrolyte interfaces. Increasing efforts have been focused on enhancing the performance of hematite based photoanodes via nanostructure control, doping, heterojunction construction, and surface modification with a secondary semiconductor or an oxygen evolution electrocatalyst. Most of the previous studies attributed the enhanced PEC water splitting performance to the changes in the donor density via doping, the formation of type II heterojunction via a secondary semiconductor coating and the improved water oxidation kinetics via coating oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. However, the role of surface states presented at the semiconductor/electrolyte interfaces of hematite-based photoanodes has been overlooked in previous investigations, which virtually play a critical role in determining the photoelectrochemical water oxidation process. In this review, we summarize the recent progress of various techniques employed for the detection of surface states of hematite photoanodes and highlight the important role of modifying surface states in the development of high performance hematite based photoanodes for photoelectrochemical water splitting application. The challenges and future prospects in the study of hematite based photoanodes are also discussed.									57	2	0	0	8	0	57			2055-6756	2055-6764		WOS:000491348700002

In order to reduce the overpotential, noble metal oxides-based electrocatalysts like RuO2 and IrO2 are usually utilized. However, due to their scarcity, the development of cost-effective non-precious OER electrocatalysts with high efficiency and good stability is urgently required. Herein, we report a facile one-step annealing of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) strategy to synthesize N-doped graphene layers encapsulated NiFe alloy nanoparticles (NiFe@C). Through tuning the nanoparticle size and calcination temperature, NiFe@C with an average size of around 16 nm obtained at 700 degrees C exhibits superior OER performance with an overpotential of only 281 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and high durability. The facile synthesis method and excellent electrochemical performance show great potential of NiFe@C in replacing the precious metal-based electrocatalysts in the OER.									86	0	0	0	4	0	86			2045-2322			WOS:000384068500001	27658968

Herein, amorphous Fe-Ni-P-B-O (FNPBO) nanocages as efficient OER catalysts are synthesized by a simple low-cost and scalable method at room temperature. The samples are chemically stable, in clear contrast to reported unstable or even pyrophoric boride samples. The Fe/Ni ratio of the FNPBO nanocages can be continuously adjusted to optimize the OER catalytic performance. The FNPBO nanocages composed of multicomponent elements can weaken the metal-metal bonds, thus rearranging the electron density around the catalytic metal atom centers and reducing the energy barrier for intermediate formation. Hence the optimized FNPBO (Fe6.4Ni16.1P12.9B4.3O60.2) catalyst shows superior intrinsic electrocatalytic activity for OER. The low overpotential to afford the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (236 mV), the small Tafel slope (39 mV dec(-1)), and the high specific current density (26.44 mA cm(-2)) at a given overpotential of 300 mV make a sharp contrast to state-of-the-art RuO2 (327 mV, 136 mV dec(-1), and 0.028 mA cm(-2), respectively).									97	3	0	0	5	0	97			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000500650000069	31702132

The O2 evolution activities (measured by a Clarke-type oxygen electrode), protein composition (determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis), and the relative Mn and Ca content (measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy) are reported for each extraction procedure.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1064-3745			MEDLINE:15187281	15187281

In this work, cobalt- and vanadium-containing mixed oxides [Co-x(VO)(y)O-z] are synthesized, and further, a unique composite of mixed oxide nanocrystals with a covalent organic polymer [Co-x(VO)(y)O-z@COP] is prepared. A high increase in activity and stability is exhibited by the Co-x(VO)(y)O-z@COP in comparison to its independent oxide counterparts. Higher activity is attributed to the presence of the VO2+/VO2+ couple, which helps in the facile oxidation of CoOOH to CoO2 and enhances the oxygen evolution reaction activity. The optimized composite material Co-x(VO)(y)O-z@COP(1:1) shows a low overpotential of 265 and 298 mV for the current densities of 10 and 30 mA cm(-2), respectively. The composite shows a low Tafel slope (43 mV/dec), high turnover frequency (3.6 s(-1) at 1.58 V), and high durability (tested for 14 h continuous oxygen evolution at 1.53 and 1.60 V). The durability is further supported by (i) chronopotentiometry (10,000 s at 25 mA cm(-2)), (ii) negligible variation in the linear sweep voltammetry responses and electrochemically active surface area values before and after 1000 cyclic voltammetry cycles, (iii) negligible dissolution of cobalt during catalysis observed from inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy of the electrolyte, and (iv) insignificant change in the catalyst surface composition observed from post-catalysis X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. To the best of our knowledge, this Co-x(VO)(y)O-z@COP(1:1) material shows a higher activity in comparison to previously reported crystalline/amorphous cobalt-vanadium oxides. In addition, the increase in activity and stability from bare oxides to composite suggests that the COP shall work as a reliable catalytic support for future applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2574-0962			WOS:000813038200001

The HEAs exhibit a low OER overpotential of 270 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 77.5 mV.dec(-1), and long-term stability for over 35 h in 1 mol.L-1 KOH, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art OER electrocatalyst RuO2. The findings in this paper not only provide an industrial approach to produce nanoporous HEAs powder but also inspire the applications of HEAs as catalysts.									15	3	0	0	0	0	15			1001-0521	1867-7185		WOS:000660800900001

In this work, a simple and scalable method synthesizes a structurally unique Ni3N nanoarray on Ni foam, Ni3N-350/NF, that provides efficient electrocatalysis for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) that transports 10 mA cm(-2) at a low potential of 1.34 V. In addition, Ni3N-350/NF exhibits electro-defense electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction, which provides a low overpotential of 128 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). As proof of concept, all-water-urea electrolysis measurement is carried out in 1 M KOH with 0.5 M Urea with Ni-3 N-350/NF as cathode and anode respectively. Ni3N-350/NF parallel to Ni3N-350/NF electrode can provide 100 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of only 1.51 V, 160 mV less than that of water electrolysis, which proves its commercial viability in energy-saving hydrogen production.

Regulation of electronic structure through heteroatom doping represents one of the most powerful strategies to boost the electrocatalytic performance of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, a rational design of O-incorporated CoP (denoted as O-CoP) nanosheets, which synergistically integrate the favorable thermodynamics through modification of electronic structures with accelerated kinetics through nanostructuring, is reported. Experimental results and density functional theory simulations manifest that the appropriate O incorporation into CoP can dramatically modulate the electronic structure of CoP and alter the adsorption free energies of reaction intermediates, thus promoting the HER and OER activities. Specifically, the optimized O-CoP nanosheets exhibit efficient bifunctional performance in alkaline electrolyte, requiring overpotentials of 98 and 310 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER, respectively. When served as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting, a low cell voltage of 1.60 V is needed for achieving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This proposed anion-doping strategy will bring new inspiration to boost the electrocatalytic performance of transition metal-based electrocatalysts for energy conversion applications.									117	7	0	0	5	0	117			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000502933900001

Thus, developing the efficient HzOR electrocatalysts, combined with the cathodic H2 evolution reaction (HER) is of vital importance for the high-rate H2 fuel generation as well as for the advancement of a N2H4 fuel cell. Herein, we utilized a facile integrated process of pulsed laser irradiation and sonochemical process to synthesize AuPt alloys by the irradiation of laser to a mixture of Au/Pt solution in methanol/DI water in varied proportions. The AuPt alloy plays a key role in the chemisorption of N2H4 on its surface, forming a dative bond involving electrons of the lone pair of nitrogen in N2H4 and empty orbitals of Pt in the alloy, indicating its high intrinsic activity against HzOR. The optimal composition of Au1Pt8 electrode demonstrates outstanding characteristics of HER with an ultralow overpotential of 26 mV at 10 mA cm-2 in alkaline medium while requiring 502 mV to attain 10 mA cm-2 for HzOR in 0.5 M N2H4/1.0 M KOH electrolyte. In addition, the assembled overall N2H4 splitting electrolyzer cell using Au1Pt8 alloys as both anode and cathode requires cell voltage of only -0.172 V at 10 mA cm-2 with tremendous stability over 10 h, which is much lower than the voltage of 1.773 V required for the overall water splitting electrolyzer. The present study validates the feasibility of AuPt alloys for stimulating N2H4 fuel cells in the future to achieve both electrical energy generation and high-rate H2 fuel production.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000817833200001

In this work, a freestanding 3D heterostructure film is synthesized from a Ni-centered metal-organic framework (MOF)/graphene oxide. During the pyrolysis process, 1D carbon nanotubes formed from the MOF link with the 2D reduced graphene oxide sheets to stitch the 3D freestanding film. The results of the experiments and theoretical calculations show that the synergistic effect of the N-doped carbon shell and Ni nanoparticles leads to an optimized film with excellent electrocatalytic activity. Low overpotentials of 95 and 260 mV are merely needed for HER and OER, respectively, to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). In addition, a high half-wave potential of 0.875 V is obtained for the ORR, which is comparable to that of Pt/RuO(2)and ranks among the top of non-noble-metal catalysts. The use of an "all-in-one" film as the electrode leads to excellent performance of the homemade water electrolyzer and zinc-air battery, indicating the potential of the film for practical applications.									141	6	0	0	9	0	141			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000579170400001	33073399

The 3D porous cellular NiCoO2/graphene (NC-GN) network demonstrates advantageous bifunctional electrocatalytic durability and activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), owing to its fascinating 3D morphology, the high conductivity of graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets, and catalytic active sites of NiCoO2 binary transition oxides. In comparison with the commercial OER electrocatalyst (IrO2) and ORR electrocatalyst (PVC), the 3D porous cellular NiCoO2/graphene (NC-GN) network exhibits superior OER catalytic performance with a satisfactory overpotential of 436 mV vs. RHE at 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the 3D porous NC-GN network displays a good ORR catalytic activity with an adequate half-wave potential of 665 my vs. RHE. The cycling stability and limiting current density of the 3D porous NC-GN network towards OER and ORR are both better than the commercial IrO2 and Pt/C catalysts.

Herein, a porous biocarbon bifunctional catalyst (C-NBF-G) was directly synthesized via simple alkali activation and carbonization from bean residues. C-NBF-G exhibited hierarchical porous structures, ternary heteroatom (N, B, and F) doping, a large specific surface area, and a relatively high degree of graphitization. The synergistic action of these characteristics contributed to the outstanding catalytic properties of C-NBF-G for ORR and OER. The catalyst demonstrated an onset potential of 0.94 V, half-wave potential of 0.824 V, and a limiting current density of 5.92 mA cm(-2), comparable to those of the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalysts. C-NBF-G also exhibited an OER overpotential of 333 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 114 mV dec(-1), lower than those of the commercial Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts. These results proved the promising performance of C-NBF-G as a bifunctional catalyst for the ORR and OER. (C) 2022 The Electrochemical Society ("ECS").

In the present work, we report a simple preparation of 2D nanocomposites of NiSx (5 nm) uniformly embedded in several layered graphite (NiSx@graphite) through the sulfidation of nickel naphtalenedicarboxylic acid framework nanosheets (similar to 9 nm). The obtained NiSx@graphite nanosheet composites are used for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis. Electrochemical studies reveal that their OER activities under strongly alkaline conditions are ranked in the order of Ni9S8@graphite > NiS@graphite > NiS2@graphite. The outstanding OER performance offered by Ni9S8@graphite owes to the synergistic effects of large specific surface area and the special structure between nickel sulfide and graphite layer, and the intrinsic large TOFs and the optimal adsorption energy of Ni9S8. Furthermore, Ni9S8@graphite as an anode material used for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) also shows a high specific capacity with competitive rate performance. Such excellent performance and low price render nickel chalcogenides a promising candidate for the future OER catalyst and LIBs application. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The mechanism of the 2D, rather than bulk, MOF was revealed by studying the role of each component in the reaction mixture. It was found that these 2D MOF-Fe/Co(1:2) exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under basic conditions. The electrocatalytic mechanism was disclosed via both experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculation. The 2D morphology and co-doping of Fe/Co contributed to the superior OER performance of the 2D MOF-Fe/Co(1:2). The simple and efficient synthetic method is suitable for the mass production and future commercialization of functional 2D MOF with low cost and high yield.									70	5	0	0	5	0	71			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000640534400001	33709569

The efficiency of water splitting is limited to a large extent by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Numerous transition metal oxides have been developed as electrocatalysts for the OER in alkaline medium. However, in-depth studies of the stability of these catalysts have rarely been performed. Here we report a systematic investigation of the stability profiles of five archetypical OER catalysts including CoOx, CoFeOx, CoFeNiOx, NiOx, and NiFeOx. We combine measurements of electrochemical activity, electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (eQCM), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). We find that the eQCM analysis gives incorrect information about the mass change during the OER due to a non-ideal response, and confirms that activity is not a valid descriptor of stability. Of the five oxides, CoOx and CoFeOx lose some mass during the initial period of the OER while CoFeNiOx, NiOx, and NiFeOx maintain their mass. However, all five catalysts undergo noticeable compositional changes due to a dynamic exchange of metal ions with the electrolyte solutions. Partial dissolution of CoOx and incorporation of Fe ions are the main processes of this exchange. The dynamic exchange reaches equilibrium after 6 h, and the catalysts are stable afterwards.									31	0	0	0	2	0	31			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000509471800012

Herein, taking advantage of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we find that the existence of low-spin (LS) state cobalt cations hinders the OER activity of spinel zinc cobalt oxide, as the t(2g)(6)e(g)(0) configuration gives rise to purely localized electronic structure and exhibits poor binding affinity to the key reaction intermediate. Increasing the spin state of cobalt cations in spinel ZnCo2O4 is found to propagate a spin channel to promote spin-selected charge transport during OER and generate better active sites for intermediates adsorption. The experiments find increasing the calcination temperature a facile approach to engineer high-spin (HS) state cobalt cations in ZnCo2O4, while not working for Co3O4. The activity of the best spin-state-engineered ZnCo2O4 outperforms other typical Co-based oxides.									37	1	0	0	0	0	37			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000651092100001	33834580

We have prepared three different coadsorption systems to study the reactivity of different oxygen species; (1) CO on the O-2 preadsorbed Pt(111) surface, (2) CO on the nearly perfect Pt(111) p(2x2)-O surface, and (3) CO on the disordered atomic oxygen-preadsorbed Pt(111) surface. Four CO2 desorption peaks (alpha-CO2 at 125 K, beta(3)-CO2 at similar to 225 K, beta(2)-CO2 at similar to 260 K, and beta(1)-CO2 at 320 K) are observed. The desorption temperatures of CO2 strongly depend on the adsorbed states of oxygen species. We have shown that the alpha-CO2 state, beta(2,3)-CO2 states, and beta(1)-CO2 State are correlated with adsorbed O-2, disordered oxygen atoms, and p(2 X 2) oxygen atoms, respectively. The difference in CO2 desorption temperature is related to thermal excitation of each oxygen species, which is derived from the structural information of coadsorbed states during thermal evolution by means of low-energy electron diffraction and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy.

By incorporating alkyl and silicon protecting groups as axial ligands on the silicon center, two silicon phthalocyanines have been generated with the goal of developing photocatalysts for organic synthesis. Using cyclic voltammetry and Stern Volmer quenching studies, we have shown silicon phthalocyanines are capable of electron transfer with appropriate substrates, including Hunig's base. We have also successfully used these catalysts in a reductive quenching reaction where Hunig's base served as a sacrificial electron donor in the reaction. In addition to being redox-active, our preliminary data also shows these compounds are capable of performing energy transfer reactions, by performing a reaction that utilizes singlet oxygen as a reactant under visible light conditions. This reaction, in combination with cyclic voltammetry studies, has also served as a model to understand how axial substitution on the silicon center seems to influence the photostability of these species.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1010-6030	1873-2666		WOS:000704299800002

Esmael/0000-0001-9530-0484			Fluoride etched Ni-based electrodes as economic oxygen evolution electrocatalysts								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				47	3			1613	1623		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.10.127		DEC 2021		JAN 8 2022	2022	Electrochemical water splitting is a promising technology for eco-friendly energy storage. However, the design principles for highly active, robust, and noble metal-free electrocatalysts for industrial-scale hydrogen production remain controversial. Oxygen-free compounds containing anionic species with a very high oxidation potential, such as fluorides, have emerged as high-performance targets for thermodynamically stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. They can further be designed to fit the key criteria of high electrical conductivity and stability. Herein, we present a facile and scalable etching method for constructing fluoride doped metallic nickel-based anodes from industrial Ni foam sources with high application potential for large-scale hydrogen production setups. The fluoride-etched Ni-catalysts were investigated with a wide range of techniques, such as powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Optimized catalysts displayed a promising overpotential of 220 mV for the OER at a current density of 60 mA cm(-2), which is competitive with noble metal-based reference catalysts, such as iridium oxide. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies demonstrated that etching of the electrode surface in fluoride medium leads to a drastic decrease of Rct. The corresponding decreased resistivity towards electrochemical OER on the electrode surface gives rise to the notably enhanced performance, with a minimum of synthetic effort.

The results show that sewage sludge mainly contain carbon-carbon double bonds (C C), carboxyl groups (COOH), hydroxyl groups (OH), aldehyde groups (CHO) and benzene (pi-pi*). Pyrolysis temperature has an evident influence on the functional groups evolution. At the stage of the pyrolysis with a temperature lower than 350℃, the increased temperature results in the largest decrease of COOH content, which is approximately 33%. In the mid-temperature thermal cracking stage (350550℃), the production of C C, OH, CHO, and pi-pi* in pyrolysis product increased significantly, while COOH show a decreasing trend, but its mass ratio is still the highest. The benzene becomes the main functional groups when the pyrolysis temperature higher than 550℃. In the high temperature pyrolysis stage (>550℃), due to aliphatic hydrocarbon molecules. The chemical activity is enhanced, mainly due to aromatization polycondensation reaction such as dehydration, decarboxylation, decarbonylation and aldol condensation. In the range of pyrolysis temperature study, carbon-carbon double bonds, aldehyde groups and hydroxyl groups content are lower, but show obvious pyrolysis rules. Further, combining the pyrolysis rules of each functional group, the possible path of the pyrolysis evolution of carbon and oxygen-containing functional groups in sludge is proposed.			基于裂解-气相色谱/质谱联用技术(Py-GC/MS),分析了污泥中主要含碳和含氧官能团在不同温度条件下的热解演变规律和热化学转化路径.结果表明,污泥中主要含碳和含氧官能团为碳碳双键(C C)、羧基(COOH)、羟基(OH)、醛基(CHO)和苯环(pi-pi*).温度对官能团裂解演变的影响较大,低温热解阶段(<350℃),温度升高导致产物中COOH含量降幅最大,约降低33%;中温热解阶段(350~550℃),产物中C C、OH、 CHO和pi-pi*生成量显著增加,而COOH呈下降趋势,但其所占质量比仍最高;在高温热解阶段(>550℃),由于脂肪烃分子化学活性增强,主要发生以脱水、脱羧、脱羰和羟醛缩合等为主的芳香化缩聚反应,同时由于污泥中的蛋白质、纤维素等大分子热解使得pi-pi*成为产物中主要官能团.根据各个官能团热解演变规律,提出了污泥含碳、含氧官能团热解演变反应路径.						0	2	0	0	0	0	2			0438-1157			CSCD:6338371

Here we report C-coated stainless steel (CSS) mesh as a corrosion-resistant current collector using a multi-functional binder, NaPAA, in aqueous lithium-ion battery cathodes. The results show that the corrosion potential of the CSS mesh is shifted positively to a large extent, indicating the suppression of oxygen evolution at high potentials. Thereby, C-coated stainless steel mesh based electrodes show better rate capability and cycling stability than those fabricated on traditional stainless steel mesh, graphite-emulsion coated stainless steel mesh and even titanium mesh based current collectors, especially at ultrahigh current densities. The plausibility of using such low-cost and green corrosion-resistant current collectors for aqueous batteries marks an important step toward industrial applications for low-cost, safe and large-scale energy storage.									23	2	0	0	1	0	23			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000406672400032

The performance of metal-air batteries is determined by the catalytic activities of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Therefore, developing efficient catalysts with superior activities for the ORR and OER is of great significance to expand the application range of metal-air batteries. Herein, CoFe alloy nanoparticles adhered to the inside wall of nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (CoFe@NCNTs) are synthesized and can function as a Janus particle to efficiently catalyze the ORR and OER with desirable activities in 0.1 M KOH solution. Specifically, the CoFe@NCNTs present an onset potential of 0.95 V and a half-wave potential of 0.84 V as an ORR catalyst. When used as an air-cathode catalyst for a Zn-air battery, the CoFe@NCNTs cathode performs better than a Pt/C cathode, showing a high open-circuit potential of 1.45 V, a maximum power density of 150 mW cm(-2) and an average specific capacity of 808 mA h g(zn)(-1) at current densities from 2 mA cm(-2) to 10 mA cm(-2).									103	4	0	0	2	0	103			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000390660000012	27883155

Herein, we report an efficient 2-dimensional OER catalyst of ultrathin nickel-iron sulfide nanosheets (NiFeS-NS). Dodecanethiol is employed in the synthesis, which prohibits the growth along the Z-axis, thus a nanosheet is obtained. The NiFeS-NS shows high OER catalytic activity, which only requires a small overpotential of 273 mV to achieve the OER current density of 10 mA/cm(2) in alkaline electrolyte, and almost no decay after 150 h of chronopotentiometry test. The high performance is attributed to the 2-dimensional structure, the synergistic effect from the Ni and Fe components which promotes the formation of the high valence Ni species, and the tuning effect from the in-situ generated sulfate doping. This work demonstrates the advantages of the 2-dimensional sulfides in electrocatalysis.

Here, a new molten salt method (MSM) is designed to prepare atomic Ni co-catalyst on widely studied TiO2 nanoparticles. The liquid environment and space confinement effect of the molten salt leads to atomic dispersion of Ni ions on TiO2, while the strong polarizing force provided by the molten salt promotes formation of strong Ni-O bonds. Interestingly, Ni atoms are found to facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancies (OV) on TiO2 during the MSM process, which benefits the charge transfer and hydrogen evolution reaction. The synergy of atomic Ni co-catalyst and OV results in 4-time increase in H-2 evolution rate compared to that of the Ni co-catalyst on TiO2 prepared by an impregnation method. This work provides a new strategy of controlling atomic co-catalyst together with defects for efficient photocatalytic water splitting.									116	12	0	0	3	0	120			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000526818900040	32067299

On the path to implement this purpose, however, several scientific hurdles remain, one of which is the low energy efficiency due to the sluggish kinetics of the paired oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In response, it is highly desirable to synthesize high-performance and cost-effective OER electrocatalysts. Recent advances have witnessed surface reconstruction engineering as a salient tool to significantly improve the catalytic performance of OER electrocatalysts. In this review, recent progress on the reconstructed OER electrocatalysts and future opportunities are discussed. A brief introduction of the fundamentals of OER and the experimental approaches for generating and characterizing the reconstructed active sites in OER nanocatalysts are given first, followed by an expanded discussion of recent advances on the reconstructed OER electrocatalysts with improved activities, with a particular emphasis on understanding the correlation between surface dynamics and activities. Finally, a prospect for clean future energy communities harnessing surface reconstruction-promoted electrochemical water oxidation will be provided.									66	2	0	0	1	0	66			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000584741200001

Herein, two-dimensional closely packed amide polyphthalocyanine iron (CPMPcFe) supported on hierarchical three-dimensional graphene (3D-HG) has been well prepared. CPMPcFe/3D-HG possessed a micro-mesoporous graphene structure where CPMPcFe was uniformly distributed in the inner and surface of the 3D-HG. Owing to the pi bonds of both CPMPcFe and 3D-HG, there is a powerful pi-pi bond interaction between CPMPcFe and 3D-HG, which increases the electron cloud density, and it could be beneficial for improving the catalytic activity and durability. Electrochemically, CPMPcFe/3D-HG exhibits an excellent half-wave potential of 0.88 V (vs. RHE), and the electron transfer number of CPMPcFe/3D-HG is 3.99 @ 0.6 V (vs. RHE). The small value of overvoltage further indicates the excellent bifunctional catalytic performance. Additionally, a home-built Zn-air battery with CPMPcFe/3D-HG as the cathode exhibits a high power density of 193 mW cm(-2), a specific capacity of 683 mA h g(-1), and remarkable long-term stability. These results indicated that CPMPcFe/3D-HG could be a promising electrocatalyst for metal-air batteries.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2398-4902			WOS:000695637200001

In this study we identify a fundamental surface catalytic limitation of this process in terms of a compromise between selectivity and activity, as oxygen evolution is a competing reaction. By investigating two classes of materials, rutile oxides and two-dimensional transition metal nitrides and carbides (MXenes), we find a linear relationship between the energy needed to activate methane, i.e. to break the first C-H bond, and oxygen binding energies on the surface. Based on a simple kinetic model we can conclude that in order to obtain sufficient activity oxygen has to bind weakly to the surface but there is an upper limit to retain selectivity. Few potentially interesting candidates are found but this relatively simple description enables future large scale screening studies for more optimal candidates.									44	1	0	0	3	1	45			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000431821800054	29629464

Kinetics of the formation of singlet oxygen in a low-temperature plasma								Soviet Journal of Plasma Physics				11	2			130	3						Feb. 1985	1985	The efficiency of the excitation of the metastable a1Deltag electronic level of the oxygen molecule in the plasma of a pulsed gas discharge has been studied experimentally and theoretically. The time evolution of the intensity of the spontaneous emission on the a'DeltagrarrX3Sigmag- transition and that of the `dimol' emission from the reaction 2O2(a'Deltag)rarr2O2+planckomega with a wavelength lambda=634 nm, have been found. When argon is added to the gaseous medium, the fraction of the energy which goes into the a'Deltag electronic level of the oxygen molecule is increased. At argon concentrations of 70-50%, the energy in this level reaches a maximum value amounting to 30% of all the energy pumped into the discharge. This effect may occur because the argon atoms in the plasma open up a new pathway for population of the a1Deltag level.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0360-0343			INSPEC:2575808

This study demonstrates the preparation of bipolar membranes using dual-sulfonated poly(arylene ether ketone) as a cation exchange layer and butyl-N-3-substituted imidazolium-functionalized poly(arylene ether ketone) as an anion exchange layer. The synthesized bipolar membrane (BPM) was employed in an acid-alkaline dual-electrolyte water electrolysis system as a separator to restrain bulk neutralization. Results indicate that this BPM promoted water spitting reactions between the membranes at an applied voltage of 2.31 V and a current density of 160 mA cm(-2) in 1 M H2SO4 and 2 M KOH without any deposition of water dissociation catalysts at room temperature. The BPM synthesized in this work also exhibited excellent chemical stability by experiencing a weight loss less than 3.4% in both strong acids and bases after 28 days. These results indicate that this BPM is feasible to be applied in the novel type acid-alkaline water electrolysis system to produce hydrogen energy.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000627067700015

Nowadays, metal phosphates are widely used as high-efficiency catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, we studied common phosphoric acid salts including orthophosphate, pyrophosphate, and tripolyphosphate in a bimetallic catalyst to explore the effect of the anion in phosphate-based OER electrocatalysts. Co-Fe-Pi, Co-Fe-Pyro, and Co-Fe-Pyro were successfully synthesized through a simple and convenient co-precipitation method. Among them, Co-Fe-Pyro exhibits the best electrocatalytic activity, with a low overpotential of 276 mV at a current density of 10 mAcm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 32 mVdec(-1), and a durable stability of about 90% after 30000 s at 1.62 V vs. RHE in 1 M KOH. XRD reveals the amorphous structure of the materials and XPS confirms the formation of Co-Fe-Pyro. SEM and TEM present the nanosheets with a porous structure on the surface of Co-Fe-Pyro. The distribution and ratio of the elements in Co-Fe-Pyro are confirmed by using EDS and ICP-AES. Therefore, this work promotes a new thought regarding the anion structure in the phosphate-based electrocatalysts.									24	2	0	0	0	0	24			2196-0216			WOS:000482102400005

Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop Ir catalysts with nanostructures that reduce Ir consumption by maximizing the surface-to-volume ratio without limiting the mass transport of reactants and products of reactions. Ir OER catalysts on a template that consisted of porous nanotubes (PNTs) based on Ni are fabricated. The Ir/Ni PNTs offer multiple benefits, including high catalytic performance (potential of 1.500 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at an operating current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 44.34 mV decade(-1)), minimal use of Ir (mass activity of 3273 A g(-1) at 1.53 V vs RHE), and facile mass transport through the NT-sidewall pores (stable operation for more than 10 h). The Ir/Ni PNTs are also applied to a tandem device, consisting of a Cu(In,Ga)Se-2-based photocathode and halide perovskite photovoltaic cell, for unassisted water splitting. A solar-tohydrogen conversion efficiency that exceeded 10% is also demonstrated, which is nearly 1% point greater than when a planar Ir film is used as the anode instead of Ir/Ni PNTs.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2198-3844		WOS:000745875500001	35068083

In the present study, PdCo/C bimetallic nanocatalysts are prepared by a facile borohydride reduction method. To improve the activity and stability, the catalysts are heat-treated at 200 degrees C in H-2/Ar atmosphere from 4 h to 24 h. The optimal heat treatment time is found to be 8 h, at which the highest activity for both oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction is obtained. With the 8 h heat-treated PdCo/C catalyst, the rechargeable zinc-air battery exhibits a high power density of 180 mW cm(-2) and retains stability for more than 50 h at a discharge-charge current density of 10 mA cm(-2), while the magnesium-air battery obtains a power density of more than 200 mW cm(-2) and remains stable within 8 h at a discharge current density of 65 mA cm(-2).

Herein, a silver nanoparticle decorated nickel-cobalt (oxy)hydroxide composite is fabricated on nickel foam (Ag@NiCo(OH)(x)/NF) via electrodeposition followed by spontaneous redox reaction. Benefitting from the synergetic contributions of an amorphous/crystalline phase, abundant artificial heterointerfaces, and a 3D porous architecture, the as-designed Ag@NiCo(OH)(x)/NF shows substantially enhanced electrocatalytic performance toward the OER and urea oxidation reaction. Impressively, in the urea-assisted alkaline electrolyzer (coupled with commercial Pt/C on NF as the cathode) for hydrogen production, a cell voltage of only 1.49 V is required to deliver a current density of 50 mA cm(-2), much lower than that of traditional water splitting (1.69 V). Importantly, this work represents a facile and feasible method to exploit efficient self-supported electrocatalysts toward overall water splitting and urea-rich wastewater purification.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000829676100001	35861603

Therefore, it is of great significance to study stable and efficient non-noble metal based electrocatalysts. In this paper, three-dimensional (3D) spherical V-NiFe LDH@Ni3S2 was developed by exquisitely decorating ultra-thin V-doped NiFe layered dihydroxide (NiFe-LDH) on Ni3S2 nanosheets supported by nickel foam (NF). It is worth mentioning that V-NiFe LDH@Ni3S2 exhibits an excellent electrocatalytic performance and only 178 mV overpotential is required in 1 M KOH to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Long-term chronoamperometry manifests its superior electrochemical stability. The combination of NiFe LDH and conductive substrate coupling can drastically afford abundant active sites and accelerate charge transfer, and V doping can markedly regulate the electronic structure. Therefore, the activity and durability of the electrocatalysts are greatly improved. This study may provide a new strategy for the preparation of efficient OER electrocatalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000765860200001	35258063

The high overpotential of the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) caused by the multi-electron transfer process with a high chemical energy barrier, however, limits its competitiveness. Here, a highly active and stable OER electrocatalyst was designed through a cobalt-induced intrastructural enhancement strategy combined with suitable electronic structure modulation. A carved carbon nanobox was embedded with tri-metal phosphide from a uniform Ni-Co-Fe Prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanocube by sequential NH3 center dot H2O etching and thermal phosphorization. The sample exhibited an OER activity in an alkaline medium, reaching a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 182 mV and displayed a small Tafel slope of 47 mV dec(-1), superior to the most recently reported OER electrocatalysts. Moreover, it showed impressive electrocatalytic durability, increasing by approximately 2.7 % of operating voltage after 24 h of continuous testing. The excellent OER activity and stability are ascribed to a favorable transfer of mass and charge provided by the porous carbon shell, synergistic catalysis between the three-component metal phosphides originating from appropriate electronic structure modulation, more exposed catalytic sites on the hollow structure, and chainmail catalysis resulting from the carbon protective layer. It is foreseen that this successfully demonstrated design concept can be easily extended to other heterogeneous catalyst designs.									21	0	0	0	1	0	19			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000586010400001	33043594

However, proton-exchangemembrane electrolysers are impeded by the high cost and low availability of their noble-metal electrocatalysts, whereas alkaline electrolysers operate at a low power density. Here, we demonstrate that electrocatalytic reactions relevant for water splitting can be improved by employing magnetic heating of noble-metal-free catalysts. Using nickel-coated iron carbide nanoparticles, which are prone to magnetic heating under high-frequency alternating magnetic fields, the overpotential (at 20 mA cm(-2)) required for oxygen evolution in an alkaline water-electrolysis flow-cell was decreased by 200 mV and that for hydrogen evolution was decreased by 100 mV. This enhancement of oxygen-evolution kinetics is equivalent to a rise of the cell temperature to similar to 200 degrees C, but in practice it increased by 5 degrees C only. This work suggests that, in the future, water splitting near the equilibrium voltage could be possible at room temperature, which is currently beyond reach in the classic approach to water electrolysis.									170	7	0	0	9	0	171			2058-7546			WOS:000435024900014

Here we show by utilizing the hydrogen spillover effect at high temperature (700 degrees C) that the in situ formed surface oxygen vacancies on TiO2 nanobelts can facilitate the redispersion of Pt nanoparticles to stable single-atoms. The isolated Pt atoms are firmly confined by the surface oxygen vacancy sites in the internal surface of TiO2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have further proved that Pt atom is likely to be confined to oxygen vacancies to form single-atom sites. The as-obtained catalyst exhibits excellent photocatalytic water splitting performance with a hydrogen evolution rate of 38.33 mmol mg(Pt)(-1) h(-1) under simulated solar light irradiation, which is about 59.9 times higher than that of TiO2 nanobelts with Pt nanoparticles. This approach provides a facile method to prepare noble metal catalysts with both high atom economy and reaction activity.									18	1	0	0	1	0	18			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000653269400001

Herein, the nitrogen-doped carbon-decorated tricomponent metal phosphides of FeP4 nanotube@Ni-Co-P nanocage (NC-FNCP) with unique nested hollow architectures are fabricated by a self-sacrifice template strategy. Benefiting from the multi-component synergy, the modification of nitrogen-doped carbon, and the modulation of nested porous hollow morphology, NC-FNCP facilitates rapid electron/mass transport in water and urea electrolysis. NC-FNCP-based anode shows low potentials of 248 mV and 1.37 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) to attain 10 mA/cm(2) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR), respectively. In addition, the overall urea electrolysis drives 10 mA/cm(2) at a comparatively low voltage of 1.52 V (vs. RHE) that is 110 mV lower than that of overall water electrolysis, as well as exhibits excellent stability over 20 h. This work strategizes a multi-shell-structured electrocatalyst with multi-compositions and explores its applications in a sustainable combination of hydrogen production and sewage remediation.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000692079800001

The work focuses on synthesizing a bifunctional catalyst with a high efficiency, that is, a nickel phosphide doped with the reduced graphene oxide nanosheets supported on the Ni foam (Ni2P/rGO/NF), via the hydrothermal approach together with the calcination approach specific to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The Raman, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM), as well as elemental mapping, are adopted to study the composition and morphology possessed by Ni2P/rGO/NF. The electrochemical testing is performed by constructing a parallel two-electrode electrolyzer (Ni2P/rGO/NF||Ni2P/rGO/NF). Ni2P/rGO/NF||Ni2P/rGO/NF needs a voltage of only 1.676 V for driving 10 mA/cm(2), which is extremely close to Pt/C/NF||IrO2/NF (1.502 V). It is possible to maintain the current density for no less than 30 hours. It can be demonstrated that Ni2P/rGO/NF||Ni2P/rGO/NF has commercial feasibility, relying on the strong activity and high stability.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8				1996-1944		WOS:000515503100251	32041227

Fluoride addition in the concentration range of 25 - 200 ppm significantly reduces the lifetime of films through localized thinning and in some cases, complete removal of film. While the presence of fluoride does not affect the overpotential for oxygen evolution, it lowers the efficacy of oxygen evolution. Complexation of fluoride by aluminum ions reduces the deleterious effects of fluoride. Based on thermodynamic and XPS analyses, a degradation mechanism has been proposed.									1	1	0	0	0	0	2			0010-938X	1879-0496		WOS:000515204200048

Strategies are sought to mitigate the detrimental hydrogen uptake into the metal. The corrosion phenomenon is subdivided into anode and cathode processes caused by electron release upon O-2(-) oxidation at the metal/oxide interface in the case of the former and electron-proton recombination resulting in hydrogen pick-up or H-2 evolution in the case of the latter. In a previous study, the additive dependence of the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction was analysed. The present study examines the oxygen concentration dependence of the anode potential, presents the impact of oxygen concentration on the co-absorption of hydrogen and merges the anode and cathode processes. The computational model is validated by semi-quantitatively reproducing the experimental solubility limit for oxygen in alpha-Zr. The impact of the emerging conceptual understanding for material development is discussed.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2046-2069			WOS:000332469500004

In this study, one-dimensional porous La0.5Sr0.5CoO2.91 nanotubes were prepared by a simple and efficient electrospinning technique. These materials displayed an initial discharge capacity of 7205 mAh g(-1) with a plateau at around 2.66 V at a current density of 100 mA g(-1). It was found that the La0.5Sr0.5CoO2.91 nanotubes promoted both oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions in alkaline media and a nonaqueous electrolyte, thereby improving the energy and coulombic efficiency of the Li-O-2 batteries. The cyclability was maintained for 85 cycles without any sharp decay under a limited discharge depth of 1000 mAh g(-1), suggesting that such a bifunctional electrocatalyst is a promising candidate for the oxygen electrode in Li-O-2 batteries.

Dissolved oxygen availability is frequently limiting the biotransformation of these organic compounds in the subsurface due to the limited aqueous solubility of oxygen, the relatively slow rate of re-aeration of groundwater in the saturated zone, and the significant biological oxygen demand exerted during aerobic metabolism. Addition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) can augment the oxidant capacity of the aquifer. This paper reviews several reactions pertinent to remediating contaminated groundwaters via H2O2 addition. H2O2 is disproportionated by the action of microbial catalase and several inorganic catalysts such as iron oxide species to give 0.5 mol O2 per mole of H2O2 consumed. The resulting dissolved oxygen should then be available for microbial respiration. If disproportionation occurs too quickly evolution of oxygen gas can form bubbles that lower aquifer permeability. Another type of reaction is direct oxidation of organic compounds by H2O2 in the presence of enzymes (peroxidases) or metal oxide catalysts. Molecular oxygen is not evolved as a result of this type of H2O2-consuming reaction. Modifications in treatment strategy may also be necessary to minimize H2O2 toxicity as H2O2 is known to be toxic at a concentration within the cell of 0.1 mM.									145	5	0	0	93	1	157			0169-7722			WOS:A1992HP81400001

The purpose of this paper is to provide a summary of most significant scientific and technological achievements obtained at the end of the GenHyPEM project (FP6, 2005-2008), and to discuss future perspectives. Using carbon-supported platinum at the cathode for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and iridium at the anode for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), efficient membrane - electrode assemblies have been prepared and characterized using cyclic voltametry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Charge densities and impedances of lab-scale PEM cells have been measured and used as references to optimize the performances of a GenHy (R) 1000 PEM water electrolyser (1 Nm(3) H-2/h) and then to extend the production capacity up to 5 Nm(3) H-2/h. Different non-noble electrocatalysts have been successfully tested to replace platinum at the cathode. Some current limitations and future perspectives of the technology are outlined and discussed.

Reactions in the bulk and at two interfaces of an oxide layer and also oxidant diffusion are taken into consideration in the model. The reaction constants were calculated in the diffusion approximation. Computation results and experimental data are in good agreement in a temperature range of 800-1200degC and an oxide thickness range of 6-400 Aring for oxidation in dry oxygen or in an N2O ambient.									0	0	0		0	0	0			1063-7397			INSPEC:6036479

J	Haupt-Herting, S; Fock, HP								Oxygen exchange in relation to carbon assimilation in water-stressed leaves during photosynthesis								ANNALS OF BOTANY				89		SI		851	859		10.1093/aob/mcf023				JUN 2002	2002	In a study on metabolic consumption of photosynthetic electrons and dissipation of excess light energy under water stress, O-2 and CO2 gas exchange was measured by mass spectrometry in tomato plants using O-18(2) and (CO2)-C-13. Under water stress, gross O-2 evolution (E-o), gross O-2 uptake (U-o), net CO2 uptake (P-N), gross CO2 uptake (TPS), and gross CO2 evolution (E-C) declined. The ratio P-N/E-o fell during stress, while the ratios U-o/E-o and E-c/TPS rose. Mitochondrial respiration in the light, which can be measured directly by (CO2)-C-12 evolution during (CO2)-C-13 uptake at 3000 mul l(-1) (CO2)-C-13, is small in relation to gross CO2 evolution and CO2 release from the glycolate pathway. It is concluded that PSII, the Calvin cycle and mitochondrial respiration are down-regulated under water stress. The percentages of photosynthetic electrons dissipated by CO2 assimilation, photorespiration and the Mehler reaction were calculated: in control leaves more than 50 % of the electrons were consumed in CO2 assimilation, 23 % in photorespiration and 13 % in the Mehler reaction. Under severe stress the percentages of electrons dissipated by CO2 assimilation and the Mehler reaction declined while the percentage of electrons used in photorespiration doubled. The consumption of electrons in photorespiration may reduce the likelihood of damage during water deficit.

Uncoupled photosystem I electron transport rate was not affected by zaluzanin C; however, uncoupled photosystem II electron flow from water to 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl phenylenediamine and from water to silicomolybdate was inhibited, but electron transport from diphenylcarbazide to silicomolybdate was not affected. We conclude that the site of inhibition by zaluzanin C is located at the oxygen evolution level.									13	0	0	0	7	2	13			0098-0331			WOS:A1992JY19400001	24254770

The AM printed structures/electrodes (AMEs) produced using these filaments display bespoke electrochemical signals, in this case, efficient catalysis towards the major reactions that occur within a water electrolyser, namely the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on the cathode and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the anode without the need for any post-production treatments. Various percentage mass incorporations, of the additives, into the PLA filaments were explored, with a 25% mass incorporation representing an ideal compromise between electroactivity and printability. Utilizing the optimized M-10%-C-15%-AME and Pt/C-25%-AME as the cathode and anode, respectively, whilst a commercially available alkaline battery applied a potential of 1.5 V, water-splitting was achieved with obvious effervescence occurring at each electrode. This AM technique could mitigate the need for complex fabrication procedures, allowing researchers, industry and any interested individuals to rapidly go from 'desktop designs' to workable electrochemical prototype devices.									31	1	0	0	5	2	31			2398-4902			WOS:000503876500024

Cobalt coating on the surface of nickel hydroxide particles can be converted to CoOOH during charge. Well distributed CoOOH forms the conductive network on the surface of nickel hydroxide particles, thereby leading to higher utilization of active material. Cyclic voltammetric studies suggest that nickel hydroxide microencapsulated by cobalt has better reversibility of the Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH redox couple, greater discharge capacity and higher oxygen evolution overpotential than nickel hydroxide with added cobalt metal powder as a conductor. The mechanism of the electrode reaction is still found to be controlled by proton diffusion, and the proton diffusion coefficient is 1.2 x 10(-9) cm(2) s(-1).									39	11	0	0	0	0	43			0021-891X			WOS:000078577500014

In this paper, we investigated the effect of the support on photocatalytic water oxidation under visible light using cobalt oxide as a multielectron catalyst. A range of supported Co3O4 nanoclusters have been successfully synthesized via wet impregnation and bisolvent methods. Compared with the wet impregnation approach, the bisolvent method allowed us to obtain a high quality catalyst with all the Co3O4 nanoclusters formed inside the mesoporous support using hexane/water as the combination. The resulting catalyst consists of Co3O4 nanoclusters with a very small particle size (similar to 25 nm) and narrow size distribution. Catalytic water oxidation experiments were performed in [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+)-persulfate (photochemical) and Ce4+/Ce3+ (chemical) systems, and it was found that smaller Co3O4 cluster sizes resulted in higher water oxidation activity. In addition, KIT-6 was found to be a better support than SBA-15, which is likely due to the fact that the 3D porous structure of KIT-6 offers more accessible pores than the 1D channels in SBA-15. To further elucidate the role of support in the photocatalytic oxygen evolution, bare Co3O4 nanoparticles together with two SiO2- and gamma-Al2O3-supported ones were investigated. Photocatalytic studies show that both supported Co3O4 nanoparticles exhibited significant enhancement (50-80%) in oxygen evolution activity, compared with bare Co3O4 nanoparticles. However, switching from the SiO2 to gamma-Al2O3 support does not significantly change the activities, indicating composition and surface properties of the support do not participate in rate-limiting steps in oxygen evolution. It can be concluded that the major role of catalyst supports in Co3O4-based water oxidation catalysts is to provide a medium to physically separate Co3O4 nanoclusters from aggregation, leading to superior photocatalytic activities.									85	3	0	0	7	0	86			2155-5435			WOS:000312170100038

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is considered a bottleneck of electrochemical water splitting for hydrogen fuel generation. It is still challenging to extract a high density of charge carriers in noble-metal-free alternative catalysts to facilitate sluggish kinetics. Herein, we report the rational design and coherent interface engineering for combining light-harvesting Cu31S16 with electroactive Co9-xNixS8 (x = 0-9) to form novel Cu31S16-Co9-xNixS8 heterodimers. By delicately controlling the kinetic growth in a seed-mediated growth method, the bifunctional centers, even with two distinct crystal phases, were integrated into a synergistic architecture, which achieved full-spectrum solar energy capture and light conversion to drive and activate the electrochemical reaction. Benefiting from the well-defined structure, high-quality interface, oriented attachment, and optimal Co/Ni bimetal ratio, Cu31S16-Co7.2Ni1.8S8 produces a dramatically reduced overpotential (242 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) with a shift of 83 mV under visible-light excitation, achieving a 4.5-fold higher turnover frequency than that of its unirradiated Co7.2Ni1.8S8 counterpart. This enhanced performance also far exceeds commercial RuO2 (358 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and most nonprecious-metal nanocatalysts. Further mechanistic studies reveal that coherent interface engineering leads to a strong photo/electricity coupling effect and efficient spatial charge separation, which induces sufficient hot holes that eventually accumulate at the electroactive sites to accelerate the multihole-involved OER. This work would open up new opportunities for the fabrication of non-noble metal electrocatalysts and management of charge carriers.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000648552500051	33890773

The absorption rovibrational spectra of all the measured carbon dioxide isotopologues were assigned and used for the quantification of the time-dependent isotope exchange between oxygen atoms (O-16) from the crystalline lattice of the solid mineral samples and (O-18) oxygen atoms from gaseous (CO2)-O-18. Similarly to our previous studies devoted to isotopic exchange activity of titanium dioxide, we found out that rutile, montmorillonite, siderite, calcite or basaltic minerals also exhibit unexpectedly significant oxygen mobility between solid and gas phases. The rate of formation of gaseous (CO2)-O-16 is found to be highly dependent on the nature of the mineral sample. Our previous studies together with the results here presented suggest that such crystal lattice oxygen isotopes mobility can be explained by two mechanisms: cluster-like structure of finely powdered materials or the existence of oxygen deficiency sites in the structure of the crystal lattice.					18th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)18th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)	JUL 10-14, 2016JUL 10-14, 2016	IEEE Photon SocIEEE Photon Soc	Univ Trento, Fac Letters & Philosophy, Trento, ITALYUniv Trento, Fac Letters & Philosophy, Trento, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2162-7339		978-1-5090-1467-5	WOS:000389537400208

Herein, we report a novel metal-ion adsorption-pyrolysis strategy for the controllable zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 derived synthesis of individual high quality N-doped carbon nanotubes embedded with well dispersed nonprecious metal nanoparticles, which exhibit superior electrocatalytic activity and stability for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, and oxygen evolution reaction. Experimental analysis and density functional theory calculations indicate that the remarkable electrocatalytic activities are mainly attributed to the interface effects for the efficient electron transfer from metal nanoparticles to the N-doped carbon shell, as well as the large specific areas, unique tube structures, appropriate doping, high graphitization degree, and robust frameworks. The high reaction stability is attributed to the multiwalled graphitic carbon shells efficiently preventing metal nanoparticles from aggregation, corrosion, and oxidation. This novel synthetic strategy presents a facile universality for synthesizing N-doped carbon nanotube structures and will provide a guideline for developing low-cost, highly active, and stable electrocatalytic materials for sustainable energy conversion.									28	1	1	0	1	0	29			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000451496000039	30387595

Anodized nanostructured 3d transition metals and alloys with the formation of OER-active oxides/hydroxides are known to have high catalytic activity towards OERs but suffer from poor electrical conductivity and electrochemical stability in harsh oxidation environments. Here we report that high OER activity can be achieved from the metallic state of Ni which is passivated by atomically thick graphene in a three-dimensional nanoporous architecture. As a free-standing catalytic anode, the non-oxide transition metal catalyst shows a low OER overpotential, high OER current density and long cycling lifetime in alkaline solutions, benefiting from the high electrical conductivity and low impedance resistance for charge transfer and transport. This study may pave a new way to develop high efficiency transition metal OER catalysts for a wide range of applications in renewable energy.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000661562700001	34128521

But because of the overlapping of processes due to similar time constants, it is necessary to understand the system well to set up a correct equivalent circuit for analysis of the measured spectra. Distribution of relaxation times (DRT) offers a model-free approach for impedance analysis. In this work DRT was used to analyze a Ni/Co3O4 gas diffusion electrode (GDE) for metal-air batteries. To identify the corresponding process for the identified peaks temperature, current density, gas composition, electrolyte concentration and electrode material composition were varied. In total five processes could be identified. Four were observed both during oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A fifth could only be recognized during OER. In particular the charge transfer coupled with an adsorption process and the porous structure could be identified. Furthermore, it could be shown that having a bimodal pore size distribution, consisting of two different materials, the correct calculation of the DRT spectra is inhibited, resulting in two peaks instead of the characteristic number of peaks that are getting smaller towards smaller time constants.

However, most carbon materials are not stable in highly oxidative OER environments. Herein, nitrogen (N) and transition metal (TM) co-doped carbon nanosheets hybridizing with transition metal (TM/TM-N-C, TM= Fe, Co, Ni) are developed from biomass lysine by employing a NaCl template and molten-salt-promoted graphitization process. Among the as-synthesized TM/TM-N-C, the Ni/Ni-N-C with Ni nanocubes embedded in carbon demonstrates an excellent ORR-OER stability during the potential of 0.06-1.96 V. The rechargeable Zn-air battery with the fabricated Ni/Ni-N-C as the cathode catalyst produces a low voltage gap of 0.773 V, which is only slightly increased by 5 % after 150 cycles testing. Combined experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the exceptional activity and ORR-OER wide potential durability of Ni/Ni-N-C can be ascribed to highly active Ni-N-4-C configuration, synergistic effect between Ni and Ni-N-4-C, carbon nanosheets structure and formation of stable Ni3+-N for protecting carbon from oxidation.									62	4	0	0	1	0	62			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000533148700030

We found that noncovalent interaction between hydrated cations and covalently bonded OHad increases in the same order as specific charge density of the corresponding cation (K+ < Li+ < Ba2+). This interaction is also found to cause an increase in the density of OHad center dot center dot center dot center dot center dot M (n+)(H2O) (x) clusters in the compact part of double layer. The trend in interaction strengths is inversely proportional to the activity of the HOR and ORR, which suggests that the clusters "block" the metal active sites necessary for the adsorption of H-2 and O-2. In the case of the HER, however, we demonstrate that the activity is directly proportional to the strength of these noncovalent interactions. To explain this behavior, we suggest that the hydrated cations affect the rate of the water dissociation step which increases in the order K+ < Li+ < Ba2+.									49	1	0	0	2	1	49			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000312634100009

Hereby, a novel protocol is approached to design a heterostructure of Zinc MOF decorated on the surface of 2D activated carbon (AC) through a simplistic approach. To begin with, analytical, morphological and spectroscopical studies were performed to identify the functional moieties, cruciate-flower like morphology and oxidative state of atoms present in the composite ZnMOF @AC. The photocatalytic material aids in degrading both cationic and anionic dye in a UV (254 nm) irradiated environment at a rate of 86.4% and 77.5% within 90 mins. Subsequently, the hybrid materials are coated on the carbon substrate to evaluate the catalytic activity using oxygen evolution and reduction reaction process. The mechanical insight for the catalytic activity relies on the electronic transitions of atoms on the edges of the sheets ascribing to d-d energy levels between the interfacial electron movement. Our composite exhibits an overpotential of 0.7 V and a Tafel slope of 70 mV/dec for the oxygen reduction reaction. This study proposes an alternate approach for developing MOF decorated carbon-based composites for photocatalytic degradability and energy necessity.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000696924200001	34343883

Compared with single iron sulfide catalyst (Fe0.96S@NSPC), the obtained Fe1Co1Sx@NSPC exhibits enhanced activities in both ORR and OER, whose half-wave potential and overpotential (at 10 mA cm(-2)) are 0.82 V, 0.39 V. The improved electrocatalytic activities are believed to be from the synergistic effects between the binary sulfides and the N, S co-doping and the 3D porous structures. As expected, the home-made aqueous ZAB based on Fe1Co1Sx@NSPC exhibits a high peak power density (159 mW cm(-2)), large specific capacity (807 mAh g(-1)) and a long-term charge/discharge cycling stability over 378 cycles at about 852 mV. Moreover, the self-made all-solid-state button ZAB based on Fe1Co1Sx@NSPC shows a high peak power density (71 mW cm(-2)) and a well maintained cycle life at about 841 mV over 100 charge/discharge cycles.									19	2	0	0	2	0	21			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000510846500024

It was shown that the single hydrogenase of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is connected to the light reaction. We conducted measurements of hydrogenase activity, fermentative hydrogen evolution and photohydrogen production of deletion mutants of respiratory electron transport complexes. All single, double and triple mutants of the three terminal respiratory oxidases and the ndhB-mutant without a functional complex I were studied. After activating the hydrogenase by applying anaerobic conditions in the dark hydrogen production was measured at the onset of light. Under these conditions respiratory capacity and amount of photohydrogen produced were found to be inversely correlated. Especially the absence of the quinol oxidase induced an increased hydrogenase activity and an increased production of hydrogen in the light compared to wild type cells. Our results support that the hydrogenase as well as the quinol oxidase function as electron valves under low oxygen concentrations. When the activities of photosystem 11 and I (PSII and PSI) are not in equilibrium or in case that the light reaction is working at a higher pace than the dark reaction, the hydrogenase is necessary to prevent an acceptor side limitation of PSI, and the quinol oxidase to prevent an overreduction of the plastoquinone pool (acceptor side of PSII). Besides oxygen, nitrate assimilation was found to be an important electron sink. Inhibition of nitrate reductase resulted in an increased fermentative hydrogen production as well as higher amounts of photohydrogen. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Traditional methods of representing the SOA formation potential of an organic do not fully capture the dynamic, multi-generational nature of the SOA formation process. We apply the Statistical Oxidation Model (SOM) of Cappa and Wilson (2012) to model the formation of SOA from the formation of the four C-12 alkanes, dodecane, 2-methyl undecane, cyclododecane and hexylcyclohexane, under both high- and low-NOx conditions, based upon data from the Caltech chambers. In the SOM, the evolution of reaction products is defined by the number of carbon (NC) and oxygen (N-O) atoms, and the model parameters are (1) the number of oxygen atoms added per reaction, (2) the decrease in volatility upon addition of an oxygen atom and (3) the probability that a given reaction leads to fragmentation of the molecules. Optimal fitting of the model to chamber data is carried out using the measured SOA mass concentration and the aerosol O:C atomic ratio. The use of the kinetic, multi-generational SOM is shown to provide insights into the SOA formation process and to offer promise for application to the extensive library of existing SOA chamber experiments that is available.									29	0	0	0	5	0	29			1680-7316	1680-7324		WOS:000315406100032

However, the design of stable and efficient GNR catalysts remains a great challenge. Herein, a novel iron and cobalt co-doped carbon-based catalyst (C-MP-FeCo) with a GNR structure has been developed by a facile and one-step heat-treatment method. C-MP-FeCo is an excellent bifunctional electrocatalyst for low potential difference Delta E between the oxygen-evolution reaction and oxygen-reduction reaction (Delta E<INF>C-MP-FeCo</INF> = 0.70 V vs. Delta E<INF>(Pt/C+RuO<INF>2</INF>)</INF> = 0.765 V). The maximum power reached 331 mW cm<SUP>-2</SUP> at 0.97 V for a Zn-air battery derived from the C-MP-FeCo catalyst, and with the Pt/C + RuO<INF>2</INF> catalyst it was only 249 mW cm<SUP>-2</SUP> at 0.89 V; also, better discharge performance, voltage efficiency and durability were delivered by the former catalyst. Our findings show that the main methods of increasing electrocatalytic activity are (1) forming GNRs and exposing active sites, and (2) exploiting the synergistic effects of Fe, Co, N, and F.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000709007800001

The presence of volatile boron species has remarkable detrimental effect on the electrochemical activity of LSM oxygen electrode for the O-2 evolution reaction (OER). After polarization at 200 mA cm(-2) for 2 h, the electrode polarization and ohmic resistances increase rapidly from similar to 40 and 1.2 Omega cm(2) to 614 and 33 Omega cm(2), respectively. Under the anodic polarization conditions, there is an accelerated Sr segregation and boron deposition preferentially occurs at the electrode/electrolyte interface, forming lanthanum borates and manganese oxide. Boron deposition and reaction is driven to the interface region due to the increased activity and energetics of lanthanum at LSM lattice sites at the electrode/electrolyte interface under anodic polarization conditions, accelerating the disintegration and delamination of the LSM electrode. The results indicate the potential detrimental effect of volatile boron on the electrochemical activity and stability of LSM oxygen electrodes of solid oxide electrolyzers.

However, the nanoparticles usually suffer from limited charge-transfer efficiency, which can be solved by preparing one-dimensional materials. Herein, Co-Ni alloy nanochains are prepared by a direct-current arc-discharge method. The nanochains, comprised of mutually coupled uniform nanospheres, can range up to several micrometers in size. When the alloy is exposed to air or under the electro-oxidation process, a metal-metal-oxide heterostructure is obtained. The alloy can inject electrons into the oxide, which makes it more suitable for electrocatalysis. The composition of the samples can be changed by varying the ratio of Ni/Co (i.e., Co, Co7Ni3, Co5Ni5, Co3Ni7, Ni) in the synthesis process. The nanochains show good oxygen evolution performance that correlates with the Ni/Co ratio. Co7Ni3 demonstrates optimal activity with an onset point of 1.50 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and overpotential of 350 mV at 10 mAcm(-2). The alloy nanochains also show excellent durability with 95.0% current retention after a long-term test for 12 h.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000427243200012	29356148

Contrary to common belief, H2O2 is used for a variety of purposes in terrestrial biochemistry. The Viking Lander Biology Experiments have often been interpreted as the result of inorganic oxidants in the Martian soil. Here, we interpret the Viking findings as the result of the reactions of H2O2-H2O based life. Several hitherto puzzling findings are explained by the H2O2-H2O hypothesis. The lack of detected organics is the result of autooxidation of the organisms as these were gradually heated. Supportive observations were made in the PR and LR experiments. Our interpretation is that the addition of water vapor at a relatively high temperature could only be withstood by the organisms for a short time, as they perished due to hyperhydration. The evolution of oxygen in the GEx experiment is explained by the high oxidative content of the organisms as they perished in this experiment. The PR experimental conditions were most Mars-like and carbon assimilation could be detected but no growth. Particularly, the GEx experiment allows the calculation of biomass in the Martian soil based on measured evolution of reaction products. Further properties of the suggested organisms such as metabolic reactions and by-products may be detected by future Mars missions.

Herein, we develop high-performance catalysts of trimetallic sulfide (Ni3S2-FeS-CoS) nanosheets decorated with bimetallic-nitroxide (NiCo(N,O)(x)) nanodots on a 3D NiFeCo foam by in situ fabrication with approaches of the dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma and hydrothermal sulphurization. The resulting catalyst shows excellent electrocatalytic activity for overall water splitting in alkaline medium, with the overpotentials 82 m V for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 170 m V for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (j(10)), which are very competitive to most recent non-noble-metal electrocatalysts. Specially, the nanodots help achieve ultra-stable electrocatalytic performance evidenced by negligible changes for the physico-chemical structure of catalyst after a harsh HER or OER test over 50 h. Our results offer a versatile approach for the development of next-generation electrocatalysts for hydrogen economy and other applications.									54	2	0	0	5	0	55			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000496897000028

In particular, specific transient and isotopic experiments (use of (CO)-C-13, (CO2)-C-13, and O-18(2)) were designed and conducted in an attempt at providing insights about the effect of support's preparation method on the concentration (mg g(cat)(-1)), reactivity towards oxygen, and transient evolution rates (mu mol g(cat)(-1) s(-1)) of the inactive carbon formed under (i) CH4/He (methane decomposition), (ii) CO/He (reverse Boudouard reaction), and (iii) the copresence of the two (CH4/CO/He, use of (CO)-C-13). Moreover, important information regarding the relative contribution of CH4 and CO2 activation routes towards carbon formation under DRM reaction conditions was derived by using isotopically labelled (CO2)-C-13 in the feed gas stream. Of interest was also the amount, and the transient rate, of carbon removal via the participation of support's labile active oxygen species.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			2073-4344			WOS:000478652600020

Here, we present a catalytic activity map for nanoceria, calculated as a function of shape, size, architecture, and defect content, using atom-level models. The activity map reveals that as oxygen is gradually depleted from the nanoceria catalyst, so it becomes energetically more difficult to extract further oxygen. We propose that the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ceria corresponds to the level of oxygen depletion, where it becomes thermodynamically prohibitive to extract further oxygen from the material (positive free energy). Moreover, because the reaction enthalpy contributes to the free energy, we predict that the OSC is influenced by the particular reaction being performed. Specifically, the more negative the reaction enthalpy, the higher the potential OSC (notwithstanding entropic contributions). The decrease in catalytic activity during an oxidation reaction emanating from the increase in energy required to extract oxygen suggests that there exists a "window of catalytic operation", where the activity of the catalyst can be controlled by operating at different points within this window. We show experimentally how the activity can be modified by engineering the oxygen vacancy concentration and hence the oxygen content of the catalyst to facility tunable activity. In addition to the defect content, we find that size (particle diameter, mesoporous wall thickness) and nanostructuring (particle, cube, mesoporous architecture, morphology, and surfaces exposed) are key drivers of catalytic activity. To generate the atom-level models of ceria nanostructures, we use nonequilibrium molecular dynamics to simulate the self-assembly of mesoporous ceria from amorphous nanobuilding blocks, followed by a (simulated) crystallization step; the latter evolves the crystal structure and microstructural features such as grain-boundaries and dislocations. Our simulated crystallizations emanate wholly from a multitude of "random" atom collisions, which result in the spontaneous evolution of a crystalline seed that nucleates crystallization of the whole system. The atomistic models generated by "simulating synthesis" are shown to be in quantitative structural agreement with experiment.									41	0	0	0	4	0	41			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000386421900014

The as-fabricated Au-Co(OH)(2) forms a typical wreath-shaped structure on a nanosheet with an urchin-like Au-Co(OH)(2) structure located in the centre surrounded by densely grown Co(OH)(2) nanoarrays. Morphological evolution of the Au-Co(OH)(2) microclusters through intermediate steps could be identified by varying the reaction time. The incorporated electronegative Au may be responsible for the decrease of binding energy of Au-Co(OH)(2) compared to Co(OH)(2). The Au-Co(OH)(2) electrode was found to be a promising catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in neutral pH solutions, with a larger roughness factor, lower OER onset and much higher current density than a Co(OH)(2) electrode. The improvement of the OER activity of Au-Co(OH)(2) microclusters may be due to their large surface area provided by the 3D network of microclusters, and the incorporation of Au as an electron sink to facilitate the oxidation of Co(II) and Co(III) to Co(IV).									51	2	0	0	2	0	51			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000321675600025	23771130

Excellent yields with TOF50 numbers up to 1000 h(-1) have been achieved using CAN as electron acceptor at [CAN]/[Ir] ratios higher than 700. The investigation of the reaction mechanism by UV-vis seems to evidence that both catalyst precursors are transformed into the same active molecular species resulting from the degradation of the hydrocarbon ligands which is partially supported by the similarity of the oxygen evolution profiles at moderate oxidant/catalyst ratios for both catalyst precursors and the same chemical oxidant. In addition, DLS studies provide evidence for the participation of homogeneous iridium molecular species as intermediates likely stabilized by the carboxylate-functionalized bis-NHC ligand.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000462662100010

The need to engineer and fabricate electro-catalysts of low over-potential for water oxidation necessitates using readily available technologies and precursors. In the present study, OER electro-catalyst with composition neodymium telluride hollow shells vaporized on Ni Foam (NdTe-HS/NF) is fabricated at a substantially lower energy cost than other abundant metal-containing catalytic structures. The catalytic system functions properly, starting the oxygen evolution process at an over-potential of 301 mV vs. RHE, attaining a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a modest Tafel slope of 91 mV dec(-1) is also achieved. This tafel slope value suggests the presence of an electron/proton transfer channel. The catalyst sustains a constant current density over lengthy periods of up to 9 h of water electrolysis testing. Because of an easily accessible production technique, NdTe-HS/NF maintains its integrity, form, and chemical profile even after several hours of nonstop water electrolysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0947-8396	1432-0630		WOS:000853852600001

After the oxidative stabilization of MCMB, the oxygen content and the number of functional groups are increased, while the micro-crystal structures become worse. However, after the successive carbonization and graphitization, the oxygen content and the number of functional groups are decreased, the micro-crystal structures become well, and the yields are decreased.					2009 16th IEEE International Symposium on the Physical and Failure Analysis of Integrated Circuits (IPFA)2009 16th IEEE International Symposium on the Physical and Failure Analysis of Integrated Circuits (IPFA)	6-10 July 20096-10 July 2009		Suzhou, Jiangsu, ChinaSuzhou, Jiangsu, China	0	0	0		0	0	0					978-1-4244-3911-9	INSPEC:10863909

The effects of operational parameters (such as VER dosage, PMS concentration, initial pH, and current density) on DOX degradation were studied and the optimal parameters were discussed. Electrochemical degradation and electrochemical analysis showed that the addition of VER particles could improve the electrochemical conversion efficiency of the 3D electrochemical system by increasing the oxygen evolution potential and inhibiting the occurrence of oxygen evolution side reactions. Quenching experiments showed that sulfate free radicals are the leading reactive oxygen species in the system. A possible pathway for DOX degradation by the reaction system was proposed based on intermediates detected using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-quadrupole-time of flight (LC-ESI-Q-TOF). The toxicity of all the intermediates was predicted using the ECOSAR program. Our study showed that the 3D VER/PMS electrode system was reliable for repairing surface water or groundwater polluted by antibiotics.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1383-5866	1873-3794		WOS:000814751300006

An anti-galvanic replacement reaction involving the reduction of Ru(iii) ions by nanoporous Pd nanowires to form nRuPd alloy nanowires was observed. A series of nRuPd/C materials with various Ru/Pd ratios were prepared by the spontaneous deposition of a Ru cluster on a Pd nanowire core using different Ru precursor concentrations (RuCl3 = 0.5, 1.0, 5.0 mM). The successful formation of low content Ru-incorporated Pd nanowires without individual Ru clusters were confirmed using physicochemical characterization. The electrocatalytic activity of the nRuPd/C for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media was measured by RDE polarization experiments. The electrocatalytic activity varied greatly depending on the Ru content on the Pd nanowires. Among the catalysts, the prepared Pd nanowires incorporated with a very small amount of Ru (ca. 1.4 wt%) exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity toward the ORR and HER: positive ORR/HER onset and E-1/2 potentials, higher n value, and lower Tafel slope.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2046-2069		WOS:000696361100037	35478580

The catalysts were characterized by XRD,SEM,XPS and BET. The catalytic activities of NiCo-MOF-74 in the oxygen evolution reaction( OER) were evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry( LSV) in 1 mol /L KOH electrolyte. The results show that the prepared MOF catalysts contain C,O,Ni and Co elements. The catalysts have high crystallinity and a bar-polyhedron structure. However,when the content of Ni is low,the catalyst has excellent activity for OER. When the content of Ni exceeds 10%,the activity for OER decreases with further increases in the content of Ni. By adjusting the molar ratio of Ni /Co in the raw material,Ni_(0.5)Co_(9.5)MOF-74 was prepared and this material shows the best activity for OER,with an overvoltage at a current density of 10 mA/cm~2 of only 352 mV. Under the same test conditions,the stability of this material is better than that of RuO_2.			采用简单的一步水热法制备了不同Ni、Co物质的量比的双金属NiCo-MOF-74催化剂,利用X射线衍射( XRD) 、扫描电子显微镜( SEM) 、X射线光电子能谱( XPS)和N_2吸/脱附法( BET)对催化剂进行了结构表征,并且在1 mol /L KOH电解液中通过线性伏安法评价了催化剂的氧气析出反应( OER)催化性能。结果表明:所制备的催化剂中含有C、O、Co、Ni 4种元素,并且具有棒状多面体结构和较高的结晶度;当Ni含量较低时,催化剂具有较好的OER催化活性;当Ni的摩尔分数超过10%时,催化剂的OER催化性能随着Ni含量的增加而下降。通过调节原料中Ni、Co的物质的量比,制得的Ni_(0.5)Co_(9.5)-MOF-74样品具有最好的OER催化性能,其在电流密度为10 mA/cm~2时的过电压仅为352 mV,在相同测试条件下稳定性优于RuO_2。						1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1671-4628			CSCD:6532772

We discuss and quantify the uncertainties in the cooling times predicted by the models, arising from the treatment of mixing during the central H-and He-burning phases, the number of thermal pulses experienced by the progenitors, progenitor metallicity, and the C-12(alpha, gamma)O-16 reaction rate. The largest sources of uncertainty turn out to be related to the treatment of convection during the last stages of the progenitor central He-burning phase and the C-12(alpha, gamma)O-16 reaction rate. We compare our new models to previous calculations performed with the same stellar evolution code, and discuss their application to the estimate of the age of the solar neighborhood and the interpretation of the observed number ratios between H- and He-atmosphere WDs. The new WD sequences and an extensive set of WD isochrones that cover a large range of ages and progenitor metallicities are made publicly available at the official BaSTI Web site.									92	0	0	0	0	0	92			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000278459000026

C-MFECs, as alternatives to nonprecious transition metals and/or precious noble metal-based electrocatalysts, have been consistently demonstrated as efficient catalysts for oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution, hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, nitrogen reduction, and many other (electro-) chemical reactions. Recent research and development of C-MFECs have indicated their potential applications in fuel cells, metal-air batteries, and hydrogen generation through water oxidation as well as electrochemical production of various commodity chemicals, such as ammonia, alcohols, hydrogen peroxide, and other useful hydrocarbons. Further research and development of C-MFECs would surely revolutionize traditional energy conversion and storage technologies with minimal environmental impact. In this short review article, we summarize the journey of C-MFECs over the past 10 years with an emphasis on materials development and their structure-property characterization for applications in fuel cells and metal-air batteries. Current challenges and future prospects of this emerging field are also discussed.									80	5	0	0	4	0	81				2637-9368		WOS:000669757500005

Here, a series of coexistent composite materials (CoNi/NHCS-TUC-x) of cobalt-nickel supported on nitrogen-doped hollow spherical carbon and tubular carbon are obtained using a simple pyrolysis strategy. Co and Ni in the composites are mainly present in the form of alloy nanoparticles, M-N-x and M-C-x (M = Co or Ni) species, with high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electroactivity. The materials containing different proportions of spherical carbon and tubular carbon obtained by simply adjusting the raw materials for generating tubular carbon exhibit interesting bifunctional performance: samples with an abundant tubular content have the highest ORR onset potential (0.91 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode), while those with a rich spherical content have the highest ORR current density (5.13 mA.cm(-2)). Furthermore, CoNi/NHCS-TUC-3 provides the lowest potential difference (Delta E = E-j=10 - E-1/2) of 0.806 V. We then test the potential possibility of CoNi/NHCS-TUC-3 as an air electrode for primary and rechargeable Zn-air batteries. The primary battery delivers an open-circuit potential of 1.59 V, a peak power density of 361.8 mA.cm(-2), and a specific capacity of 756.5 mA h.g(Zn)(-1). The rechargeable battery could be cycled stably for more than 55 h at 10 mA.cm(-2). These characteristics make CoNi/NHCS-TUC-3 a superior electrocatalyst for both the ORR and OER, as well as a suitable bifunctional electrode applied to a rechargeable Zn-air battery.									26	0	0	0	1	0	25			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000703995900026	34519493

Herein, a rationally designed oxide/sulfide heterostructures, which named as CoO/CoS2, are successfully realized. Benefited from the electrons interaction between multiple components at the heterojunction interface and the defect structure, the CoO/CoS2 displays highly effective bifunctional cata-lytic performance and robust durability. CoO/CoS2 expresses a truncated overpotential of 320 mV at 10 mA cm(-1) for OER, a half-wave potential of 0.78 V for ORR, and a potential difference of approximately 0.78 V. For practical application, the assembled aqueous Zn-air battery with CoO/CoS2 as the air cathode displays a large open-circuit voltage of 1.40 V, a high power density (84 mW cm(-2)) and superb charge-discharge stability. This work illustrates the great application prospects of CoO/CoS2 as a next-generation power source device.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2452-2627			WOS:000754748800001

To better understand the behavior of the low-index Ir surfaces in an electrochemical environment, we perform a systematic thermodynamic analysis by means of the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. On the basis of computed surface energies of the Ir (111), (110) and (100) facets as a function of applied electrode potential and coverage of adsorbed water species we determine stability maps and predict equilibrium shapes of Ir nanoparticles. Our calculations also show that metastable oxide precursors formed at the initial stages of Ir surface oxidation are responsible for enhanced catalytic activity toward OER as compared to metal surfaces covered by oxygen adsorbates and thick-oxide films. Such enhancement occurs not only due to the modified thermodynamic stability of OER intermediates, but also because thin-oxide layers may display the more energetically favorable I2M (interaction of two M-O units) rather than WNA (water nucleophilic attack) OER mechanism.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000454751000028

However, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the carbonous cathode of Li-O-2 batteries are kinetically sluggish. Herein, we explore the electrocatalytic activities, electronic structures, and the underlying catalytic mechanisms of nitrogen-doped graphene nanoribbons (N-GNRs) by density functional theory calculations. The edge effect of zigzag GNRs and the doping effect of nitrogen atoms alter the electronic structure of GNRs and significantly reduce the energy barrier of the two-electron ORR/OER. The overpotential of the GNRs can reach 0.025 V, demonstrating better catalytic activity than the noble metals Ag(111) and Au(100). Four-electron preferential sites also exist in N-GNRs, usually located at the center of the nanoribbons and far away from the nitrogen atom.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000853612800001	36102806

In this work, we report the synthesis of the self-supported sandwich-structured electrode with Co3-xNixO4/Co3O4 nanowire arrays (NS@Co3-xNixO4/Co3O4). This novel nanostructure demonstrates very high reversible Faradaic redox reaction of CoNi-O -> CoNi-O-OH and excellent bifunctional activity toward both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Moreover, the air cathode, prepared by pressing the stainless steel (SS)@Co3O4 sandwiched between two Ni foam (NF)@Co3-xNixO4, possesses a dense and interconnected structure with a high loading of active catalyst. The Ni foam in this work not only acts as a substrate, but also serves as a nickel precursor for the formation of the Co3-xNixO4 catalyst. Meanwhile, combining the 3D porous structure of NF and intrinsic high OER activity of SS, the assembled porous air electrode can take full advantage of the sandwich structure to promote the electrocatalytic reaction kinetics of NS@Co3-xNixO4/Co3O4. Rechargeable battery system assembled from this NS@Co3-xNixO4/Co3O4 electrode based on both Zn-Co3-xNixO4 and Zn-air electrochemical reactions exhibits much higher energy efficiency and durability than those of commercial Pt/C and RuO2 electrocatalysts. This protocol opens a new avenue for the rational design of highly efficient and stable self-supported air electrode for metal-air batteries.									40	3	0	0	1	0	40			2405-8297			WOS:000500484000025

Metal oxides can be of industrial importance by offering an economic and green route for selectively converting styrene into styrene oxide (SO). Herein, by treating the pristine porous 2D Co3O4 sheets with NaBH4 solution, a novel hierarchical structure, i.e., OD Co3O4 nanoparticles decorated on 2D porous Co3O4 sheets, was obtained. This simple solution reduction strategy not only realizes the morphology evolution, but also induces the modification of the valence states of metal ions and the simultaneous generation of surface oxygen vacancies. The hierarchical OD/2D Co3O4 hybrids rich in oxygen vacancies (OV-Co3O4) exhibit a much better SER performance than the Co3O4 sheets (P-Co3O4), with the yield of SO more than doubled. The excellent catalytic performance of the OV-Co3O4 can be ascribed to the synergistic effects regarding the hierarchical porous structure, the modification of surface chemical composition and the creation of surface oxygen vacancies.

Herein, we synthesized 3D porous Active-N-rich graphene-like carbon layer-encapsulated Fe/Fe3C (Fe@NCG) via pyrolysis of a mixture of solvent-free assembled Fe-chitosan chelates and additional small molecule nitrogen source urea, wherein space-confinement effect of chelates suppressed agglomeration of Fe3+ ions and small molecule nitrogen source facilitated regulation of N configurations. The optimized catalyst Fe@NCG shows remarkable ORR/OER bifunctional catalytic activity with a half-wave potential of 0.86 V for ORR and a moderate potential difference of 0.85 V in alkaline medium. Comparative studies revealed that Active-N-rich carbon layer and inner well-dispersed Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles and the favorable interface structures between them were responsible for high catalytic activity. Excitingly, the assembled zinc-air battery with Fe@NCG catalysts exhibits a high open-circuit potential (1.45 V), extremely high peak power density (204.50 mW/cm(2)) and energy density (814.70 Wh kg(-1)) as well as robust charge-discharge durability, surpassing those of noble metal catalyst.

The electrodes were prepared by thermal decomposition of IrCl3, TiCl3 and Pb(NO3)(2) at 600 degreesC for 1 h using Ti as support. X-ray diffraction shows that the layers are crystalline and that the corresponding metal oxides are present. The surface morphology of the samples, before and after use under extensive oxygen evolution (Tafel experiment), was characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy and the micrograph analyses show that the OER promotes the dissolution of the oxide layer. The redox processes occurring on the surface were characterized by cyclic voltammetry at 20 mV s(-1) in 0.5 mol dm(-3) aqueous H2SO4, at room temperature, and were controlled by the Ir3+/Ir4+ couple. The measured anodic voltammetric charge is related to the active area of the electrode showing that the replacement of TiO2 by PbO2 increases the surface area with the higher value being at 50 mol% PbO2. After oxygen evolution, the surface area increases slightly. Tafel slopes are independent of Pb content with the values around 60 mV decade(-1), which suggest that only Ir sites are active for OER. The values of normalized current (i/q(a)) show some inhibition of the OER as TiO2 is replaced by PbO2 suggesting that PbO2, can be a good choice, with potential to improve the selectivity of the system. The reaction order with respect to H+ ion is zero at constant overpotential and ionic strength. The values of Tafel slope and reaction order indicate that a single reaction mechanism is operating.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0103-5053	1678-4790		WOS:000174728900012

In this paper, biomass chitin-derived N-doped carbon (C-Chitin)/graphitic C3N4 (g-C3N4) composites have been designed and fabricated via an ultralow-cost route including the low-temperature dissolution of biomass chitin and the subsequent carbonization. The C-Chitin/g-C3N4 composites exhibit well-designed loofa sponge-like three-dimensional (3D) network architectures assembled with massive interconnected ultrathin mesoporous nanosheets. Benefiting from the well-designed morphology and unique mesoporous structure with a high surface density of catalytic active sites, as well as the incorporation of N-doped carbon with g-C3N4, the C-Chitin/g-C3N4 composites exhibit pronounced ORR activity (4-electron pathway), superior OER activity (much lower onset potential and higher current density than Pt/C), excellent tolerance to methanol crossover and high durability toward both ORR and OER. Especially, the obtained C-Chitin/g-C3N4 composites with 20 wt % addition of g-C3N4 exhibit a potential gap of 0.90 V between the OER potential at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and the ORR half wave potential, which is even higher than some highly active metal catalysts including noble-metals, thus holding great promise as low-cost metal-free bifunctional catalysts for efficient ORR and OER.

Zirconium tetra-tert-butoxide reacts with tert-butyl hydroperoxide to form metal-containing peroxide and trioxide. Decomposition of the latter leads to oxygen evolution and is accompanied by radical formation. The alkoxyl and peroxyl radicals formed were identified by ESR spectroscopy. The nature of the oxidant (oxygen, zirconium-containing peroxide and -trioxide) in the Zr(OBU-t)(4)-t-BuOOH system is determined by the structure of the substrate molecule.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1070-3632	1608-3350		WOS:000239974800023

In both glass series, paramagnetic defects concentration shows a non-linear variation with Na content. The defect nature is also affected and more particularly boron oxygen hole center versus oxygen hole center relative proportion. By Raman spectroscopy, we showed that polymerization increase and molecular oxygen production, linked to the alkali migration, were minimized for some irradiated glass compositions. Mixed alkali effect blocks structural changes under electron irradiation in Na/Li glasses while for Na/K glasses, structural evolutions are smaller than in pure alkali glasses but non-completely annihilated.

Herein, we report an extremely simple method to prepare OER catalysts, which exhibit excellent activity and superior OER stability in alkaline conditions. The OER catalysts are composed of mixed Ni-Fe oxides or hydroxides that can be easily obtained by in situ reactive dip-coating of nickel foams in a Fe3+-containing aqueous solution. In specific, the as-prepared composites can give an overpotential value of 210 mV under a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH aqueous solution and there is not any obvious degradation in OER activity even after 50 hour's chronopotentiometry measurement at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2). More importantly, the samples prepared by this method also illustrate the good uniformity, in which this particular synthesis scheme would hold the great potency for practical fabrication of high-performance and low-cost catalysts in the large-scale industrialization.									54	1	0	0	1	0	54			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000402734600026

However, it is often challenging to implement oxidative reactions at scale due to the low activity and stability of the biocatalyst under industrial conditions. Consequently, it becomes critical to identify the bottlenecks for specific oxidation reactions as a first step in scale-up. Subsequently, we can identify where research the effort is required when developing a biocatalytic reaction for implementation in an industrial reaction, i.e., on biocatalyst development (e.g. improvement of expression levels), process development (e.g. improved oxygen supply, product removal strategies) or biocatalyst stabilization (e.g. through immobilization or directed evolution). This paper presents a systematic method to identify the bottleneck of a potential biocatalytic process using a monoamine oxidase to synthesize an intermediate in the manufacture of a drug for treating Hepatitis C (Telaprevir).

The conductivity can be adjusted by introducing graphene to construct hetero interface, in which the stacking of graphene remains a challenge. Herein, CoSe2 anchored on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composites were prepared using zeolitic imidazolate frameworks-67 (ZIF-67) and graphene oxide (GO) as precursors. Without iR-correction, CoSe(2 )anchored on rGO composites with a superior OER performance just demands a low potential of 296 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is lower than that of pure CoSe2 (348 mV). The interfacial interaction between CoSe2 and rGO adjusts the electronic structure of cobalt ions and optimizes the filling of eg orbital as well as the bonding strength between cobalt ions and oxygen intermediate species, ameliorating the intrinsic OER activity. Meanwhile, the employment of ZIF-67 with a three-dimensional structure alleviates the coverage of active sites caused by the accumulation of graphene, which is also responsible for the excellent OER activity.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000829304500004

Theoretical calculations indicate that the enhanced electron movement happened from FeNi/DCF to NC. The H-2 evolution activity of FeNi/DCF/NC showed 5.8-fold improvement compared to that of DCF at the overpotential of 400 mV in 1.0 M KOH.

Effects of Co2+ or/and Co3+ modifying on the structural, electronic, optical, and photoelectrochemical performances of Ta3N5 were investigated systematically. Co-modifying extended the absorption over the whole visible region due to the sub-band gap optical absorption from the increased heterojunction interfaces of CoxN/Ta3N5 or/and Ta2N/Ta3N5. Co2+/Co3+ dual-modifying inhibited the crystallite growth of Ta3N5. Uniformly dispersed Co elements on the Ta3N5 surface provided the more surface active sites. Co3+ played a key role in controlling the modifying amounts of both Ta2N and Co5.47N. Co2+/Co3+ dual-modifying produced a synergetic effect on enhancing the charge carrier separation, decreasing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotentials of Ta3N5, and then efficiently increasing the photocatalytic H-2-evolution activity. 1.5%Co2+/1.5%Co3+-TN possessed an excellent photocatalytic H-2-evolution activity (75.69 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) under visible light irradiation, 3.48 times higher than Ta3N5@Ta2O5 nanoparticles. Co5.47N and Ta2N as HER cocatalysts, and CoN and Co2N as OER cocatalysts, decreased the HER and OER overpotentials of Ta3N5, accelerating the kinetics of surface catalytic reaction. A synergetic mechanism for enhanced photocatalytic H-2-evolution performance was discussed in detail. Moreover, self-oxidation of Ta3N5 can be suppressed by surface-modified cobalt nitrides and Ta2N. This work provides a promising photocatalyst and a new strategy for develop efficient and stable Ta3N5-based photocatalysts for solar energy conversion. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Incorporating different divalent and trivalent metals into layered double hydroxides (LDHs) is an effective way to induce defects and generate abundant oxygen vacancies and adjust the morphology of the materials and thus enhance the intrinsic catalytic activity of the materials. In this work, a nano-flower-like Mg-doped NiCo-LDH (denoted as NiCoMg-LDH) was synthesized by a solvothermal method, and the effect of the molar ratio of Mg, Co and Ni on the electrochemical activity of NiCoMg-LDH was explored. The results showed that NiCoMg-LDH with the optimum molar ratio (Ni : Co : Mg = 3 : 3 : 0.3) exhibited excellent OER catalytic activity in 1.0 M KOH, with an overpotential of only 229 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 31.0 mV dec(-1), and an electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of 410 cm(2). This work provides a facile but effective method to improve the OER performance of layered double hydroxides.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000865264900001

The C 1s and O 1s core levels and the valence band spectra were used to identify the different oxidizing surface species and to evaluate the extension of the sp(2) conjugation as a function of oxidation time and annealing temperature. We found that epoxy groups are the dominant species only at the low oxidation stage, and ethers and semiquinones form as oxidation proceeds. The evolution of the ether/epoxy ratio with increasing oxygen coverage provides evidence for the occurrence of C-C bond unzipping. Epoxy groups are the functionalities with the lowest thermal stability and start to desorb around 370 K, strongly affecting the desorption temperature of other functional groups. The ratio between ethers and epoxy groups determines the balance between epoxy-epoxy and epoxy-ether reactions, the latter promoting the removal of C atoms from the C backbone. Adsorbate spectroscopy during thermal annealing definitely proves the catalytic effect of the basal plane oxygen atoms on the desorption reactions.									115	1	1	0	6	0	116			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000303848600007

In this work, through a facile hydrothermal method, cobalt-nitrogen-doped carbon nanocubes (Co-N/C), the calcination products of zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) are encapsulated by ultrathin C-MoS2 nanosheets to obtain Co-N/C@C-MoS2 composites which are used as host materials for the oxygen cathode. The synergistic effect between Co-N-x active sites and Mo-N coupling centers effectively promotes the formation and decomposition of Li2O2 during repeated discharge and charge process. The mesoporous C-MoS2 nanosheets with delicately designed morphology facilitate charge transfer and account for improved reaction kinetics and more importantly, suppressed side reactions between the carbon materials and the electrolyte. The oxygen cathode with the Co-N/C@C-MoS2 host shows a high initial discharge specific capacity of 21 197 mA h g(-1) and a long operation life of 332 cycles. Theoretical calculation provides in-depth explanation for the reaction mechanism and offers insights for the rational design of electrocatalysts for LOBs.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2575-0356		WOS:000671155000001

The experimental results on gas products and light tar pyrolyzed from Shenfu coal at various pyrolysis temperatures reflect the complex correlation between volatiles and coal structure affected by temperatures. Thermodynamic competitive evolution towards CO from oxygen-containing structures are analyzed by density functional theory. The formation mechanisms of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from by-product cyclopentadienyl through Diels-Alder reaction and C-H beta-scission are confirmed at the CBS-QB3//M06-2X/def2-TZVP level of theory. Kinetic rate coefficients of the rate-limiting step are computed. Thermodynamic and kinetic calculation results indicate that phenols pyrolysis have to cross a higher energy barrier. Moreover, cyclopentadienyl thermodynamically tends to form indene at 645 degrees C, while forming PAHs such as naphthalene, even fluorene, phenanthrene, and anthracene at 855 degrees C, which is consistent with the experimental results. A hydrogen-rich environment can kinetically facilitate the formation of PAHs. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0360-5442	1873-6785		WOS:000632504600009

This has allowed in-situ spatiotemporal mapping of gaseous species and temperature profiles inside the channels of commercial three way 1%Pd/0.07%Rh/Al2O3/CexZr1-xO2 and 3%Pd/Al2O3 monolith catalysts. The identification of the spatiotemporal reactant conversion, intermediate and product formation, as well as the associated heat evolution, has helped in the elucidation of reaction sequences and furthermore, the postulation of reaction mechanisms, both axially and temporally inside the monolith catalyst. Intriguingly in this work, the SpaciMS technique has provided previously unobserved insights into an apparent excess OSC-like behaviour of the 3%Pd/Al2O3 catalyst, where excess CO conversion is detected under rich CO oxidation conditions in the presence of water. It has been demonstrated that the water gas shift reaction is insufficient to account for the excess CO conversion in this work, therefore a Pd(OH)(x) surface species is hypothesised to be acting in the same way as an oxygen storage component under rich conditions.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000487570000042

Here, by adopting a precursor modulation strategy, the authors successfully synthesize single cobalt atom catalysts embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon, Co-N/C, with similar overall Co and N concentrations but different N types, that is, pyridinic N (N-P), graphitic N (N-G), and pyrrolic N (N-PY). Co-N/C with the Co-N-4 moieties coordinated with N-G displays far superior activity for oxygen reduction (ORR) and evolution reactions, and superior activity and stability in both zinc-air batteries and proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Density functional theory calculation indicates that coordinated N species in particular N-G functions as electron donors to the Co core of Co-N-4 active sites, leading to the downshift of d-band center of Co-N-4 and weakening the binding energies of the intermediates on Co-N-4 sites, thus, significantly promoting catalytic kinetics and thermodynamics for ORR in a full pH range condition.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000742021800001	35023622

Nagaiah, Tharamani/0000-0003-3545-6668			In situ incorporation of cobalt nanoclusters and nitrogen into the carbon matrix: a bifunctional catalyst for the oxygen depolarized cathode and chlorine evolution in HCl electrolysis								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				7	16			10019	10029		10.1039/c9ta00675c				APR 28 2019	2019	This study aimed at designing a simple and facile strategy of incorporating highly desirable nanoclusters of non-precious cobalt metal along with nitrogen (Co-NSC) into the carbon matrix for HCl electrolysis. The in situ co-insertion of Co and N was found to impart bifunctionality facilitating both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the oxygen depolarized cathode (ODC) and chlorine evolution at the chlorine evolving anode (CEA) in HCl electrolysis. Improvement in the kinetics and energetics of these reactions is expected to benefit from the improved energy quotient and waste HCl utilization towards greener commodity chemicals. Optimization of the Co-NSC catalyst synthesis was carefully performed using a Co-based complex by varying the thermal treatment conditions which largely impacted the composition of Co:N in the catalyst and also guided the obtainable morphology. Once synthesized a thorough investigation of the Co-NSC variants was performed using a range of physicochemical and analytical investigations to determine the most active Co:N composition and morphology facilitating bifunctional electrocatalysis at the ODC and CEA. The electrochemical activities observed were compared against those of benchmark and industrially applicable catalysts both under mild (0.4 M HCl) and stringent corrosive conditions (5 M HCl). Not just activity but stability of this carefully designed catalyst was later confirmed by performing accelerated degradation tests over the duration of a month and post analysis of the recovered catalyst. The visualization of the local electrocatalytic activity of the proposed catalyst towards the ORR was evaluated using scanning electrochemical microscopy.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000467249200061

Utilizing our newly developed deep-ultraviolet laser ionization mass spectrometry technique, here we observe the reactions of neutral cobalt clusters with oxygen and find a very stable cluster species of Co13O8 that dominates the mass distribution in the presence of a large flow rate of oxygen gas. The results of global-minimum structural search reveal a unique cubic structure and distinctive stability of the neutral Co13O8 cluster that forms a new class of metal oxides that we named as `metalloxo cubes'. Thermodynamics and kinetics calculations illustrate the structural evolution from icosahedral Co-13 to the metalloxocube Co13O8 with decreased energy, enhanced stability and aromaticity. This class of neutral oxygen-passivated metal clusters may be an ideal candidate for genetic materials because of the cubic nature of the building blocks and the stability due to cubic aromaticity.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2095-5138	2053-714X		WOS:000627417700011

This work introduced the solid-acid structure into electrocatalysts through surface bonding SO42- (like Co3O4 and CoNiFeOx). DFT calculations reveal the essence of solid acid modification is that triggers the production of Co4+ and intermediate spin Co3+ (t(2g)(5) e(g)(1)), then lifts metal d-band level and oxygen p-band level. Notably, the hydrogen bonding between SO42- group and *OOH provides additional adsorption contribution, thereby breaking the adsorption-energy scaling relation of OER. Modified by SO42-, the CNF-SO4 shows remarkably high performance with overpotential of 231 mV (at 10 mA cm(-2)) and low Tafel slop of 33.8 mV.dec(-1). This work provides an effective solid-acid-mediated strategy for electronic structure regulation and adsorption-energy scaling relation breaking in OER.									23	1	0	0	1	0	23			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000552015900062

With higher doping level of Ru, capacitance also increases as depicted in the CV behavior. Tafel slope measurements indicate that Ru substitution has profound effect as enhancement in the exchange current density is observed in neutral K2SO4 medium.

The N-doped carbon nanowebs mainly contribute to the high activity for oxygen reduction reaction, whereas the NiCo2O4 nanospheres act as an active phase for oxygen evolution reaction. The electrocatalytic performance is promoted by the synergistic effect between NiCo2O4 and N-doped carbon nanowebs. Benefiting from the hollow and N-doped structure with merits of more activity sites, fast charge and mass transport, the NiCo2O4/N-doped carbon nanowebs exhibit an excellent bifunctional catalytic activity, high selectivity of the apparent 4e(-) pathway, small Delta E values and long-term durability. Rechargeable Zn-air batteries using NiCo2O4/N-doped carbon nanowebs as catalyst display a lower overpotential, a high capacity (826.9 mAh g(-1)), a high energy density (954.2 Wh Kg(-1)) and long-term stability (600 cycles at 5 mA cm(-2)), when compared to commercial Pt/C + Ir/C. Furthermore, the NiCo2O4/N-doped carbon nanowebs is directly used as air catalyst in flexible Zn-air batteries, which also exhibit superior flexibility and cycling stability. This work provide a new method for developing highly efficiency electrocatalyst, rechargeable and flexible Zn-air batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the atomically dispersed dual-metal-site material for bifunctional catalysis in zinc-air battery is still rare. Herein, taking advantage of the trapping ability of graphene oxide to anchor metal ions, a dual-metal-site bifunctional catalyst with atomically dispersed FeN4 and NiN4 in the nitrogen doped graphene (Fe/Ni(1:3)-NG) is developed. Benefiting from the synergy effect between Fe and Ni, the catalytic performance can be greatly enhanced. The resultant catalyst exhibits highly efficient bifunctional catalytic activity, with the half-wave potential of 0.842 V for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and an over-potential of 480 mV at the current of 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). On the basis of bifunctional catalytic activities, the Fe/Ni(1:3)-NG based zinc-air battery shows an excellent power density (164.1 mW cm(-2)), outstanding specific capacity (824.3 mAh g(-1)) along with the prominent durability.

Many changes in the cell components were visible. Gas analysis revealed possible evidence of oxygen evolution from cathode and electrolyte degradation, including likely reaction products between electrolyte solvents and salt or binder. The anode surface was highly inhomogeneous and was comprised of a surface film of varying thickness, white precipitates, and dendritic growth of metallic Li and/or deliquescent salts. Manganese was incorporated into the anode and P, C, and O were preferentially incorporated into some areas of the anode surface.

This overall reaction involves the oxidation of water to oxygen at the anode and the reduction of protons to hydrogen at the cathode. Cobalt-phosphate-based catalyst (Co-Pi) is a potentially useful material for oxygen evolution reaction. In the present study, electrochemical deposition of Co-Pi catalyst is carried out on Au-coated quartz crystal from 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7) containing 0.5 mM Co2+ ion, along with the simultaneous measurement of mass changes at the electrode surface. Cyclic voltammograms and mass variations are recorded during the course of deposition. A current peak is observed at 0.92 V vs Ag/AgCl, 3 M KCl corresponding to oxidation of Co2+ ion. The mass of the electrode starts increasing at this potential, suggesting the deposition of a Co(III)-based insoluble product on the electrode surface. The stability of the catalyst is also studied at several potentials in both buffered and nonbuffered electrolyte by monitoring the real-time mass variations.									15	1	0	0	0	0	17			1932-7447			WOS:000318211200006

However, the short lifetime of catalytic electrodes remains a challenge for the electrocatalytic HMF oxidation reaction, and the high pH of the electrolyte causes denaturation of HMF during the reaction. Herein, deep eutectic solvents (DES) are employed for the preparation of efficient and durable catalytic electrodes for HMF oxidation. The catalytic electrode made up of DES avoided the complexity of multiple alkylations leading to 99% HMF conversion affording FDCA in 85.3% yield with high durability, due in part to the lower pH of the electrolyte.									15	1	0	0	0	0	16			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000562010300036

In this work, a 1-D Monte-Carlo Model is developed to calculate escape rates of energetic oxygen atoms produced from O-2(+) dissociative recombination reactions (DR) under 1, 3, 10, and 20 times present solar XUV fluxes. We found that although the overall DR rates increase with solar XUV flux almost linearly, oxygen escape rate increases from I x to 10x present solar XUV conditions but decreases when increasing solar XUV flux further. Analysis shows that atomic species in the upper thermosphere of early Mars increases more rapidly than O-2(+) when increasing XUV fluxes. While the latter is the source of energetic 0 atoms, the former increases the collision probability and thus decreases the escape probability of energetic O. Our results suggest that photochemical escape be a less important escape mechanism than previously thought for the loss of water and/or CO2 from early Mars. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

By taking advantage of upconversion luminescence material Pr3+-Y2SiO5 (Pr3+-YSO), visible light was upconverted into UV light and was used to excite UV responded nano-CaTiO3 to form charge pairs. Then the efficient forward charge transfer to hydrogen generation site Pt was fulfilled over RGO. Longer life time of charges was confirmed by fluorescence spectra in this catalyst. Simultaneously, removing nascent formed oxygen from reaction mixture by an artificial gill significantly inhibited hydrogen oxygen reverse recombination reaction. By those technologies application, visible light-driven overall water splitting was accomplished. The photocatalytic activity for hydrogen generation has been raised up to 480% with excellent stability in three recycle reactions.

Based on the octahedral site preference energy (OSPE) model, engineering the active sites of ternary M0.1Ni0.9Co2O4 for the OER and ORR in alkaline solutions is demonstrated in this work. From the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and OSPE models, Fe-doped NiCo2O4 (Fe0.1Ni0.9Co2O4) provides the highest Co2+/Co3+ ratio and the lowest Ni2+/Ni3+ ratio, leading to enhanced electrocatalytic activities toward both the OER and ORR in alkaline electrolytes from rotating ring disk voltammograms. In addition, all ternary oxides are examined as bifunctional electrocatalysts for the air electrode of rechargeable zinc-air batteries using the polarization curves of the ORR and OER in 6 M KOH in ambient air. The full-cell configuration using a Fe0.1Ni0.9Co2O4-coated air electrode exhibits a maximum power density of 150 mW cm(-2) at a current density of 250 mA cm(-2) in ambient air and facilitates long-term cycling stability (over 66.7 h at 10 mA cm(-2)). These results confirm the excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of Fe0.1Ni0.9Co2O4, which is considered to be a practical catalyst for the air electrode of rechargeable Zn-air batteries.									80	2	0	0	2	0	81			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000412800300055

Herein, we embedded an oxidized single nickel atom into pure ruthenium (Ru) metal (NiRu SAC), thereby constructing an atomic-level interface with high catalytic activity. NiRu SAC exhibits a long-term durability and an extremely low overpotential for hydrogen evolution reaction (optimal value reaches 17 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2) which is superior to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst and most reported Ru-based catalysts. NiRu-0.2 SAC also shows a remarkable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of 210 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and a resulted excellent water splitting property (1.5 V vs. RHE @ 10 mA cm(-2)). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate the fabricated oxidized singlenickel-atomic interface (between single nickel atom and neighboring Ru/O atom) not only lowers the energy barrier for water dissociation but also optimizes the H adsorption through the interaction between the interfacial Ru and O atoms. The single-atomic tailoring provides a new idea to further enhance the performance of single atom catalysts to satisfy the industrial applications.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Along this direction, transition metal-based oxides and nitrides have attracted attention due to their abundance, stability, and low cost. Here, Mn nitride, fabricated via annealing of Mn powder in N-2, is investigated for the first time as a candidate bifunctional electrode for rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZABs). Three samples were prepared by nitridation of a Mn precursor, with particle size < 100 mu m, at 1100 A degrees C for 4-30 h. The morphology and microstructure of the fabricated samples were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Phase quantification for all samples was performed using Rietveld-based fitting. The samples treated for 4 and 10 h had the largest fraction (similar to 5%) of nitride phases (Mn4N and Mn6N2.58); the remaining material was primarily MnO. The nitride phases were not pure, but contained oxygen, resulting in the formation of pseudobinary phases. The oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) performance of all samples was evaluated using rotating disk electrode (RDE) voltammetry in an alkaline electrolyte (0.1 M KOH). Among all the catalysts, the sample treated for 10 h exhibited the most positive ORR onset potential (-0.038 V vs. Hg/HgO) with good stability. The catalyst was incorporated into a practical ZAB and displayed a battery efficiency of 52.7% after 14 h of charge-discharge cycling (1 h/cycle) at a current density of 7.5 mA cm(-2).									18	1	0	0	1	0	18			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000402396400005

In this work, a chemical sodium extraction of Na from low-cost Na0.71CoO2 electrocatalyst was demonstrated as an effective way to enhance its catalytic activity and durability toward enhancing OER. By continuously extracting sodium ions out of Na0.71CoO2 for 2 days, a low overpotential eta (0.44 V) at 10 mA cm(-2), a good mass activity (65.93 mA mg(-1)) and a small Tafel slope (55 mV dec(-1)) were achieved, which are superior to those of using precious metal oxide IrO2. XPS measurements and BET surface areas investigations suggest that the dramatic improved OER performance should be ascribed to several major factors, including formed Co4+ ions oxidized from Co3+, increased surface oxygen vacancies and enlarged specific surface areas occurred during the Na extraction process. The research here highlights the importance of tuning cation deficiency in Na-based oxides for further designing advanced OER electrocatalysts. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The heat treatment not only improves the crystallinity of the MWCNTs, but also reduces the carbon-oxygen (C-O) bonding as it is replaced by the defect-carbon (sp(3) and C-H) bonding. These modifications in the heat treated MWCNT structure lead to the increase of electrochemical charge transfer. The heat treatment of MWCNTs in the composite with Pt (MWCNT-Pt composite) further facilitates electrocatalysis. The MWCNTs-Pt composite shows strong enhancement in the HER performance with an onset of overpotential of -0.04 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode and a Tafel slope of 10.9 mV/decade. This performance is indeed better than that of Pt, which is the best working material for HER. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

It is found that Fe-NMG shows higher ORR performance than Fe-NMP and Fe-MBZ, by both rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) and fuel cell tests. From characterization and surface analysis, it can be explained that the presence of higher amount of surface oxides and pyridinic nitrogen is the main reason for better performance towards ORR in alkaline media. To achieve the highest performance in alkaline exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC), the optimization of catalyst layer composition using various concentrations of ionomer (Tokuyama, AS4) was performed. At the optimum cathode layer configuration utilizing Fe-NMG produces the peak power density of 218 mWcm(-2), which is one of the highest values presented in the open literature.

Therefore, the development of highly efficient OER electrocatalysts is of great significance. Recently, various composites with porous nanostructures and superior catalytic ability for different electrochemical applications have been fabricated based on zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), and transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have been reported to be one of the most promising electrocatalysts for OER. Herein, in this work, we designed the porous CoP nanoparticles (P-CoP-NPs) composite as an effective catalyst for OER via a facile templating strategy using polystyrene (PS) spheres as the template and ZIF-67 as the cobalt source. The obtained P-CoP-NPs composite largely improved the OER catalytic performance. Such optimized P-CoP-NPs catalyst required an overpotential of 320 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm-2 in alkaline solution. P-CoP-NPs catalyst still exhibited superior catalytic stability after continuous water oxidation process with negligible decay in potential, indicating its potential to be a highperformance OER electrocatalyst. The strategy used in this study makes it possible to design and synthesize low-cost electrocatalysts with earth-abundant elements for water splitting in practical applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000777761700007		
J	Zhang, Yao; Guo, Haoran; Li, Xinpan; Ren, Wenlu; Song, Rui								The synergetic effect of the mixed phase of NiMoO4 with a 1D-2D-3D hierarchical structure for a highly efficient and stable urea oxidation reaction								MATERIALS CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS				6	11			1477	1486		10.1039/d2qm00100d		APR 2022		MAY 31 2022	2022	Using a urea oxidation reaction (UOR) instead of an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is regarded as an effective method for reducing the required hydrogen potential and overall energy costs. Nickel molybdate (NiMoO4) is considered as an efficient UOR catalyst, and its crystalline phase plays a pivotal role in improving the UOR activity. However, a deep understanding of the relevant mechanism of the NiMoO4 phase remains largely ambiguous. Herein, a mixed phase (alpha/beta) of the NiMoO4@NF electrode with a 1D-2D-3D hierarchical structure is fabricated using a facile solvothermal strategy. This unique 1D-2D-3D hierarchical structure is conducive to exposing more abundant active sites. The experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations jointly demonstrate that alpha/beta-NiMoO4 can bring "1 + 1 > 2" multiphase synergetic effects, higher conductivity and lower adsorption energy of urea molecules, which is beneficial for improving the UOR performance. Consequently, the alpha/beta-NiMoO4@NF electrode exhibits a decent UOR activity, i.e., at a potential of 1.36 V to reach 100 mA cm(-2), about 315 mV less than that of the OER. This study provides a promising method for energy conservation and treatment of urea-containing wastewater.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2052-1537		WOS:000796006300001

The utilization of stoichiometrically clear Co(tzbc)(2)(H2O)(4) as precursor could reap following benefits: i) sp(2) carbon and nitrogen in tzbc groups could directly convert to N-doping graphitized carbon; ii) metallic Co NCs formed from the thermal reduction of Co2+ in Co(tzbc)(2)(H2O)(4), which can subsequently catalyze the graphitization of the obtained carbons, avoiding additional reducing agent or using potentially dangerous atmosphere; iii) most importantly, complex precursor is easily available and could synthesize in a large scale by simple stirring reaction. As a result, the Co@NC catalyst exhibits excellent activity and stability toward both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER, respectively), approaching electrocatalytic performance shown by state-of-the-art Pt and RuO2. Such excellent HER and OER activities are attributed to the synergistic effect of the surface enwraped cobalt nanocrystyals and high conductivity of N-doped graphitized carbon. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, relatively low Coulomb efficiency, severe potential hysteresis, and poor rate capability, which mainly result from sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics, as well as pitiful cycle stability caused by parasitic reactions, extremely limit their practical applications. Manganese (Mn)-based oxides and their composites can exhibit high ORR and OER activities, reduce charge/discharge overpotential, and improve the cycling stability when used as cathodic catalyst materials. Herein, energy storage mechanisms for Li-air batteries are summarized, followed by a systematic overview of the progress of manganese-based oxides (MnO2 with different crystal structures, MnO, MnOOH, Mn2O3, Mn3O4, MnOx, perovskite-type and spinel-type manganese oxides, etc.) cathodic materials for Li-air batteries in the recent years. The focus lies on the effects of crystal structure, design strategy, chemical composition, and microscopic physical parameters on ORR and OER activities of various Mn-based oxides, and even the overall performance of Li-air batteries. Finally, a prospect of the research for Mn-based oxides cathodic catalysts in the future is made, and some new insights for more reasonable design of Mn-based oxides electrocatalysts with higher catalytic efficiency are provided.									127	11	0	0	4	0	131			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000430101100007

Therefore, highly efficient and earth-abundant catalysts are required to lower the anodic overpotential and accelerate the reaction rate. In this study, we developed a cobalt-iron phytate (Co-Fe-phy) nanoparticle oxygen-evolving electrocatalyst that possesses a great degree of amorphization, nanoporous structure and large electrochemically active surface area. These merits with the addition of the synergistic interaction between metals and phytate most probably lead to a superior activity. It can be noted that this catalyst displays a low overpotential of 278 mV to reach a 10 mA cm(-2) current density and a small Tafel slope of 34 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH, of which the performance exceeds commercial RuO2. Moreover, its exceptional durability was evaluated with the current density decreases approximately 5.6% after 10 h when compared to the initial value. More significantly, Co-Fe-phy as an anode shows a decrease in energy consumption in the practical hydrogen production configuration when compared with RuO2 and a commercial electrolyzer. This study not only highlights that the bimetallic phytate-based-catalyst owns extraordinary performance that a monometallic system can hardly reach, but also enables it as an extremely promising catalyst to substitute noble metal catalysts in water electrolysis and other devices.									26	2	0	0	0	0	27			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000387168300014

The promotion was verified with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and mainly attributed to the activation effect of Fe, which accelerates the charge transfer efficiency of Co to the benefit of catalyzing the reduction reaction of the hydrogen ions.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2574-0962			WOS:000458706800014

Three different nanocomposites with the tuned Mn precursors such as 0.625, 1.25 and 2.5 mmol, were prepared and denoted as MSSG-1, MSSG-2 and MSSG-3, respectively and loaded on the electrode's surface. Among the nanocomposites loaded electrodes, MSSG-1 loaded electrodes exhibit a maximum specific capacitance (C-sp) of 792 F/g at 3.5 A/g current density and is morphologically stable even after 5000 cycles with a retention level of 95.9%. With this outcome, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor (AASC) device is mechanized effectively to power the light emitting diodes (LEDs) for 62 s continuously. In addition, the prepared electrode materials were examined for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for enhanced electrocatalytic performance with low overpotential (346 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) current density) and Tafel slope (97 mVDec(-1)). In addition, the long-term durability study represents a stable performance of the loaded electrode lasting up to 72 h. Notably, the mesoporous nanostructures at the electrode surface offer an effective synergistic effect between SrCO3-Sr(OH)(2) supported on NH2-functionalized rGO nano-sheets (SSG) and alpha-MnO2.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000799206800001

Carbon is a distinctive chemical element which has superior properties such as porous structure, low cost, resistance to basic and acidic conditions, easy accessibility, low density, good recycling properties, more abundant and ability to combine with other chemical elements in different ways. In this review, we have critically assessed the recent developments in carbon based heterostructures for their applications in energy and environment. Special consideration has been paid on the applications in dye-sensitized solar cells, hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, Li-ion battery, supercapacitor, photocatalysis for the degradation of organic pollutants, electrochemical/bio sensors and biomedical applications. Finally, the challenges and future developments of carbon based heterostructures for applications in energy and environment are also outlined.

The effect of the applied cathodic current density (i(a)) and the dissolved-cobalt concentration in the electrolyte on the deposition rate suggests that the rate-determining step is the diffusion of the dissolved cobalt in the solution. The faradic efficiency of the cobalt deposition reaction and the coating morphology are linked to i(a), while the evolution rate of both oxygen and hydrogen in 30 wt% KOH at 70-degrees-C is dependent on the coating morphology.									2	0	0	0	0	0	3			0254-0584			WOS:A1992HK29500008

Using KMC, we monitor the time evolution of defect concentrations on a graphene surface. The degradation mechanism for oxygen exposure and subsequent anneal of graphene surface greatly depends on the temperature and initial concentrations of H and O atoms on the graphene surface. At oxygen surface coverage of similar to 0.05 and higher, the damage is caused by formation of vacancies due to desorption of CO and CO2. Hydrogen facilitates the removal of O without introducing vacancies.

Herein, Co tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin (Co-P) and Fe chloride tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin (Fe-P) were loaded on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for combining the electrocatalytic advantages of both Co-P and Fe-P. The resultant (Co-P)(0.5)(Fe-P)(0.5)@CNT composite displayed significantly boosted activity for the selective four-electron ORR with a half-wave potential of 0.80 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and for the OER with a potential of 1.65 V versus RHE to obtain 10 mA cm(-2) current density in 0.1 M KOH. A Zn-air battery assembled from (Co-P)(0.5)(Fe-P)(0.5)@CNT exhibited a small charge-discharge voltage gap of 0.74 V at 2 mA cm(-2), a high power density of 174.5 mW cm(-2) and a good rechargeable stability (>120 cycles).									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000637415100001	33881086

Due to the sluggish reaction kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the cathodes of PEMFCs and MABs, significant amounts of precious metal catalysts need to be used, driving up the cost of fuel cells and MABs and thereby hindering their commercialization on a large scale. Transition metal and nitrogen co-doped carbonaceous catalysts (M/N/C) have high catalytic activity towards the ORR and OER once the catalysts are modified with certain promoters/additives. In addition, M/N/C catalysts can be prepared from abundant, inexpensive materials, making their cost negligible compared with precious metal catalysts, a development that would efficiently decrease the cost of PEMFCs and MABs. In last decade, numerous researchers have attempted to realize these applications of M/N/C catalysts, and some exciting results have been achieved, making these promising replacements for precious metal catalysts. However, some serious problems and significant challenges remain. In this paper, we review the research on the application of M/N/C analogue catalysts in PEMFCs and MABs in the last 10 years, indicate the remaining challenges, and suggest the future research directions.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1002-0071	1745-5391		WOS:000606620800003

The electrochemical stability window varied in the order of Pt < Au < highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) < glassy carbon electrodes, and expanded when the salt concentration increased reaching 3.5 V in the dual cation water-in-salt electrolyte. This increase was due to the shift in the onset potential of the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions to more negative and positive potential values, respectively. It is noteworthy that there is a larger shift in the onset potential of the oxygen evolution on the Pt electrode. The capacitance at the potential of zero charge of the HOPG electrode was found to be about 4 mu F cm(-2) and almost independent of the electrolyte concentration while the potential of zero charge shifted to more negative values upon increasing the acetate salt concentration. Using ferricyanide and ferrocene methanol as redox probes, their redox potential, ion transport and electron transfer kinetics in acetate-based electrolytes were investigated. The apparent redox potential shifted in the opposite direction; to more positive and negative values for ferricyanide and ferrocene methanol redox systems, respectively. A significant decrease in the diffusion coefficient of ferricyanide ions, i.e. 4 orders of magnitude, was observed in the dual cation water-in-salt compared to a dilute single salt electrolyte. High viscosities might be partially responsible for the decrease of the heterogeneous rate constants obtained for the redox probes but other factors such as interactions with water, electrolyte ions and electrodes might be at play as well.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000709880000001

Currently, most of the spent devices end up in landfills or the conventional toxic and energy-intensive metal extraction processes. Advanced reuse and re-valorization practices are lacking due to both technical and economic barriers. To address this growing concern, we herein demonstrate that the fully degraded electrode of the state-of-the-art anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) can be "revitalized"in situduring the operation. The facile treatment involves fueling the SOFC with the readily available fuels containing H2S and the electrode pulverization. The resulting powder comprises porous particles with mixed nickel sulfide nanoclusters dispersed on Y-stabilized ZrO2(NiSx/YSZ) which enables superior activity in both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Its voltage gap between the ORR half-wave potential and OER potential at the benchmark 10 mA cm(-2)reached 0.74 V, rendering stable and efficient performance in a rechargeable Zn-air battery. This work might boost the awareness of treating end-of-life electrochemical materials sustainably and pave new ways for the circular economy.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000571356300016

The current central issue is to explore nonprecious metal based catalysts, especially bifunctional electrocatalysts with high activity for both ORR/OER processes with mild strategies. Herein, we report a facile yet scalable approach to fabricate hierarchical 3D macrosheets composed of interconnected in situ cobalt catalyzed nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (denoted as Co@NCNT HMS) through the pyrolysis of g-C3N4@Co-glycolate microsheets, which exhibit outstanding oxygen catalysis performance. Specifically, a record low potential gap (Delta E = E-j10 - E-1/2) of 0.681 V can be achieved in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Impressively, a Zn-air battery based on a Co@NCNT HMS air cathode achieves a specific capacity of 675.8 mA h g(-1) and a peak power density of 159.83 mW cm(-2). More importantly, the cycling stability of the rechargeable Zn-air battery is outstanding with an excellent output voltage retention (97.3% after 150 h).									55	8	0	0	1	0	55			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000442385800008		
J	Xu, Wei; Xu, WenWu; Duan, Xiangmei								C9N4 as excellent dual electrocatalyst: A first principles study*								CHINESE PHYSICS B				30	9					096802	10.1088/1674-1056/ac0ccf				SEP 2021	2021	We perform first principles calculations to investigate the catalytic behavior of C9N4 nanosheet for water splitting. For the pristine C9N4, we find that, at different hydrogen coverages, two H atoms adsorbed on the 12-membered ring and one H atom adsorbed on the 9-membered ring show excellent performance of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Tensile strain could improve the catalytic ability of C9N4 and strain can be practically introduced by building C9N4/BiN, and C9N4/GaAs heterojunctions. We demonstrate that the HER performance of heterojunctions is indeed improved compared with that of C9N4 nanosheet. Anchoring transition metal atoms on C9N4 is another strategy to apply strain. It shows that Rh@C9N4 exhibits superior HER property with very low Gibbs free energy change of -30 meV. Under tensile strain within similar to 2%, Rh@C9N4 could catalyze HER readily. Moreover, the catalyst Rh@C9N4 works well for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with an overpotential of 0.58 V. Our results suggest that Rh@C9N4 is favorable for both HER and OER because of its metallic conductivity, close-zero Gibbs free energy change, and low oneset overpotential. The outstanding performance of C9N4 nanosheet could be attributed to the tunable porous structure and electronic structure compatibility.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1674-1056	2058-3834		WOS:000698475400001		
J	Raymond, J; Blankenship, RE								The evolutionary development of the protein complement of Photosystem 2								BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-BIOENERGETICS				1655	1-3			133	139		10.1016/j.bbabio.2003.10.015				APR 12 2004	2004	During the transition from anoxygenic to oxygenic photosynthesis, the Type 2 reaction center underwent many changes, none so dramatic as the remarkable increase in complexity at the protein level, from only three or four Subunits in the anoxygenic reaction center to possibly more than 25 in Photosystem 2 (PS2). The evolutionary source of most of these proteins is enigmatic, as they have no apparent homology to any other proteins in existing databases. However, some of the proteins in PS2 have apparent homologies to each other, suggesting ancient gene duplications have played an important role in the development of the complex. These homologies include the well-known examples of the D1 and D2 reaction center core proteins and the CP43 and CP47 core antenna proteins. In addition, PsbE and PsbF, the two subunits comprising cytochrome b-559, show homology to each other, suggesting that a homodimeric cytochrome preceded the heterodimeric one. Other potential homologies that appear to be statistically significant include PsbV with the N-terminal part of D1 and PsbT with PsbI. Most of the proteins that make up the photosynthetic apparatus bear no relation to any other proteins from any source. This suggests that a period of remarkable evolutionary innovation took place when the ability to make oxygen was invented. This was probably a response to the production of highly toxic oxygen and these new proteins served to protect and repair the photosynthetic apparatus from the harmful effects of oxygen.

Their corresponding electrocatalytic performance was systematically investigated toward ORR in an alkaline electrolyte. The electrocatalyst chemical composition and structure evolution (e.g., microstrain, crystallite size, and cell volume) were confirmed by X-ray diffraction Rietveld analyses. The material generated at 550 degrees C (Co-Cat-T550) showed the largest cell volume of the C3N4 phase with a crystallite size of 4.1 +/- 0.1 nm. Independent of the heat-treatment temperature, the cobalt atom was coordinated to nitrogen moieties. The following findings: cobalt inserted in the carbon nitride framework (Co-g-C3N4), abundant Co-N-x and pyridinic-N species, unique encapsulated cross-tubular structure, and disordered carbon domains performed better in the ORR with Co-Cat-T550 among the obtained electrocatalysts. In addition, Co-Cat-T550 showed performance comparable to Pt/C in an alkaline hydrogen/oxygen microfuel cell platform.									21	1	0	0	0	0	21			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000535246100044	32309924

Pure and mixed cobalt- and iron- containing film electrodes were prepared by vapor deposition in an O-2 atmosphere and characterized under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Electro-chemical/catalytical measurements were performed in an electrochemical cell directly coupled to the UHV system. XPS measurements of mixed binary oxides with different Co:Fe atomic ratios reveal solely Co2+ and Fe3+ states, pointing to CoFe2O4 in combination with excess Co or Fe either in a CoO or a Fe2O3 phase. For the CoFe2O4/CoO binary metal oxide electrodes the base CVs in 0.5 M KOH show clear differences compared to Fe3O4(001) and the CoFe2O4/Fe2O3 electrodes at potentials > 0.5 V, reflecting the formation of Co2+ to Co3+ transition. The mixed cobalt- and iron-containing thin film electrodes show a higher overpotential for the OER than pristine CoO(111); it is, however significantly lower compared to magnetite Fe3O4(001). Together with changes in the ORR performance Fe doping is found to lower the overall efficiency as bifunctional catalyst, as compared to the pure CoO(111) and Co3O4(111) electrodes, but it is much higher compared to that of a pristine Fe3O4(001) electrode.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000692249500004

The electrocatalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), however, faces significant challenges for practical implementation of electrolyzers. In this work, a comparative study on the activity and stability of oxidized polycrystalline noble metals during the OER is presented. All studied metals exhibit transient and steady-state dissolution. Transient dissolution takes place during oxide formation and reduction. Steady-state dissolution depends on the OER mechanism on each surface: On metals such as Ru and Au, for which oxygen from the oxide participates in the OER, the Tafel slope is low and the dissolution rate is high. In contrast, on metals for which oxygen evolves directly from adsorbed water, such as Pt and presumably Pd, the Tafel slopes are high and the dissolution rates are low. This should be considered in the design of optimal OER catalysts.									282	8	0	0	22	0	283			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000340574600011

Ultrahigh dispersion of binary metal active sites with balanced atomic distribution enables the optimization of catalytic properties for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an alkaline solution. The obtained catalyst exhibits remarkably enhanced OER and HER activities as compared with its oxide counterpart and analogues with different Co/Ni ratios. It requires overpotentials of 296 and 192 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER and HER, respectively; it retains 96.6 and 96.9% activity after 32 h of OER and 36 h of HER tests at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. As directly used an anode and a cathode in an alkaline electrolyzer, a low cell voltage of 1.60 V could endow a water splitting current of 10 mA cm(-2), outperforming the benchmark RuO2 and Pt/C-based electrolyzer at 1.72 V@10 mA cm(-2). The current synthetic strategy may provide more opportunities for the design and direct synthesis of amorphous catalysts for overall water splitting and beyond.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000758026400001	35166520

However, it is very difficult to controllably regulate the performances of dynamic interfaces especially for industrial application. Based on this, we found that FeOOH-transformation equilibrium and the Fe* adsorption dissolution equilibrium could be regulated simultaneously to achieve the continuous update of the catalytic interface by changing the Fe3+ concentration in alkaline electrolyte. FeOOH-Ni-based oxygen evolution catalysts with high activity and long-term stability can be synthesized by in-situ electro-activation and directional regulation of catalytic equilibrium. Moreover, this strategy is suitable for almost all nickel-based materials, including Ni-MOF, Ni2P, Ni3S2, Ni(OH)(2), NiO. Among them, FeOOH-NiBDC-NF shows excellent activity for OER: when the current density reached 100 mA cm(-2) and 500 mA cm(-2), the overpotential is only 278 mV and 316 mV, respectively. Interestingly, the active catalytic interface can be updated in situ by directional adjustment of dynamic equilibrium, which can conveniently maintain the activity and stability of the catalysts. Finally, after testing at a large current density of 500 mA cm(-2) for 100 h, FeOOH-NiBDC-NF still maintained excellent performance. This study shows that the strategy of directionally regulating ion equilibrium at the dynamic interface is effective.									30	2	0	0	2	0	32			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773475300006

Electrocatalysts are indispensable elements for large-scale water electrolysis, which can efficiently accelerate electrochemical reactions occurring at both ends. Benefitting from high specific surface area, well-defined void space, and tunable chemical compositions, hollow nanostructures can be applied as promising candidates of direct electrocatalysts or supports for loading internal or external electrocatalysts. Herein, some recent progress in the structural design of micro-/nanostructured hollow materials as advanced electrocatalysts for water splitting is summarized. First, the design principles and corresponding strategies toward highly effective hollow electrocatalysts for oxygen/hydrogen evolution reactions are highlighted. Afterward, an overview of current reports about hollow electrocatalysts with diverse architectural designs and functionalities is given, including direct hollow electrocatalysts with single-shelled, multi-shelled, or open features and heterostructured electrocatalysts based on hollow hosts. Finally, some future research directions of hollow electrocatalysts for water splitting are discussed based on personal perspectives.									30	0	0	0	1	0	30				2198-3844		WOS:000743869700001	35043604

Herein, we report Co@Pd core-shell nanoparticles encapsulated in porous carbon derived from zeolitic imidazolate framework 67 (ZIF-67) for both ORR and HER. The controlled pyrolysis of ZIF-67 can lead to the formation of Co nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen-doped porous carbon (Co NC), which subsequently underwent galvanic replacement with Na2PdCl4 to form Co@Pd core-shell nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen doped porous carbon (Co@Pd NC). The Co@Pd NC exhibited outperformance in ORR and HER than commercial Pd/C, as manifested by more positive onset potential and larger diffusion-limited current density in ORR tests, as well as a small overpotential to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and much lower Tafel slope in HER tests. It also demonstrated more robust long-term stability than commercial Pd/C for both ORR and HER. Multiple techniques inter-confirmed that the Pd loading in the sample was very low. The findings can pave a path for fabricating a core-shell structured nanocomposite with ultralow noble metal usage as a bifunctional catalyst for electrochemical energy storage and conversion with high-efficiency and remarkable longevity.

The heterostructure and the interfacial oxygen vacancy of WO3@CoWO4 reduce the energy barriers in the OER. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and material characterizations reveal that the WO3@CoWO4 p-n heterojunction endows the composite with a narrowed band gap for better visible-light harvesting, rapid charge transfer across the interface and a lower recombination rate of the photo-excited carriers. The interface O-vacancy vests the active Co site with an enhanced density of state (DOS) at the valence band maximum (VBM), which can increase the concentration of the photogenerated holes to improve photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity. This study presents a proof-of-concept design towards low cost and multi-metal 2D/2D nanosheets for water oxidation applications.									60	0	0	0	4	0	59			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000430368900013

Remarkably, the as-fabricated Ni2P@C NAs/NF exhibited superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance and only required a small overpotential of 243 mV to deliver a current density of 15 mA cm(-2), which surpassed most reported noble-metal-free based OER catalysts working in alkaline media. Such striking results could be ascribed to the synergistic effect between the interconnected macroporous structure (facilitating mass transport and exposing rich accessible catalytic centers) and the modulated electronic states induced by electron transfer from the carbon matrix to nickel phosphide (optimizing its intrinsic electrocatalytic property). In particular, the alkaline two-electrode water electrolyser, which was assembled by simultaneously utilizing Ni2P@C NAs/NF as the cathode and anode, showed considerable water-splitting activity and durability. Additionally, systematic post-electrolysis structural study confirmed thein situformation of a gamma-NiOOH film on the Ni2P surface at the anode. This work provides a deep insight into the post-electrolysis structure of nickel-containing catalyst materials and would be helpful for the design of three-dimensional porous hybrid nanocatalysts.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2052-1553			WOS:000558029000006

Here, we prepare a defective TiO2 (Ov-TiO2) hollow nanosphere as photo-electrocatalyst for photo-assisted Li-O-2 batteries to reduce the overpotential. Under illumination, the oxygen vacancies as a charge separation center contribute to the separation of electrons and holes. The generated electrons could promote reducing O-2 to Li2O2 during oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process, while the generated holes are beneficial to Li2O2 decomposition during oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process. Additionally, the proper concentration of oxygen vacancies will decrease the recombination rate between electrons and holes. The photo-assisted Li-O-2 batteries with Ov-TiO2-650 exhibit advanced performances, such as the low overpotential (0.70 V), the fine rate capability, and the considerable reversibility accompanied with the formation/decomposition of Li2O2. We expect that these results could open a new mind to design of highly efficient photo-electrocatalysts for photo-assisted Li-O-2 battery.

In spite of the high catalytic activities of noble metal-based electrocatalysts for water oxidation, their high cost, rare reserves, and low stabilities drive researchers to exploit efficient but low-cost electrocatalysts. Ultrathin 2D nanomaterials are considered efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water splitting. Herein, a facile strategy is proposed to fabricate 2D FeNi layered double hydroxide (FeNi-LDH) nanosheets packed with the in situ produced 1D sword-like FeNi-MOFs by using FeNi-LDH as a semi-sacrificial template. In the composite, the thickness of the formed nanosheets is only 1.34 nm, much thinner than that of most previously reported 2D materials. The 1D porous sword-like MOF nanorods have a long length of around 1.3 mu m. Due to the unique 2D/1D combined structure, the as-prepared FeNi LDH/MOF is directly used as electrocatalyst for the OER displays enhanced OER electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 272 mV@100 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 34.1 mV dec(-1), high long-term durability. This work provides a new way to fabricate integrated ultrathin 2D nanosheets and MOFs as advanced catalysts for electrochemical energy conversion.									42	0	0	0	0	0	42			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000665865200001

Similarly, the nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers are prepared by simple electrospinning technique to use as negatrode. The prepared materials are raptly examined through primary studies for both energy conversion and storage applications. Fascinatingly, NiCoP electrode encourages oxygen evolution reaction, and the carbon nanofiber electrode emboldens hydrogen evolution reaction with the minimum overpotential of 257 mV and 160 mV, respectively. In addition, a supercapattery is designed and operated at a full voltage window of 1.6 V using the fusion of carbon nanofiber as the negatrode and the cutting-edge NiCoP as the positrode, which presents a superior energy (56 Wh kg(-1)) and an improved power density (5333 W kg(-1)) with a long cyclic stability (5000 cycles). Finally, the fabricated supercapattery device is used to power the constructed hybrid water electrolyser that requisites a low cell voltage of 1.71 V to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Overall, the prepared electrodes reveal its superiority of handling the multifunctional challenges for both water electrolyzer and supercapatteries. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Co/Ni-rich perovskite oxides are extensively studied as promising alternatives to precious-metal catalysts; however, low-cost and earth-abundant iron (Fe)-rich perovskites are rarely investigated to date due to their poor activity and durability. This study reports an Fe-rich Sr0.95Ce0.05Fe0.9Ni0.1O3-delta (SCFN) perovskite oxide with minor Ce/Ni co-doping in A/B sites as a high-performance OER electrocatalyst. Impressively, SCFN shows more than an order of magnitude enhancement in mass-specific activity compared to the SrFeO3-delta (SF) parent oxide, and delivers an attractive small overpotential of 340 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), outperforming many Co/Ni-rich perovskite oxides ever reported. Additionally, SCFN displays robust operational durability with negligible activity loss under alkaline OER conditions. The increased activity and stability of SCFN can be ascribed to co-doping-induced synergistic promotion between structural and electronic modulation, where Ce doping facilitates the formation of a 3D corner-sharing cubic structure and Ni doping gives rise to strong electronic interactions between active sites, which is key to achieving a highly active long-life catalyst. Importantly, this strategy is universal and can be extended to other Fe-based parent perovskite oxides with high structural diversity.									11	0	0	0	1	0	10			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000735930300001

We reveal the barriers and the hole-transfer pathway in the reaction. Compared with its bulk isomer phases, such as the rutile TiO2, the advantage of the TiO2 nanosheet in this reaction is that the key reaction intermediate Ti-OH has good hole-trapping capacity, which is extremely beneficial for the oxidation half-reaction. However, the poor stability of Ti OH relative to its precursor is a negative factor for the reaction on the TiO2 nanosheet and might have a huge effect on the photocatalytic efficiency of the nanosheet. We find that introducing Ti vacancies into the nanosheet to convert the TiO2 material into a p-type semiconductor can make bridging oxygen atoms become favorable active sites for water splitting and hence may be an effective way to increase the photocatalytic efficiency.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000773651500012

Herein, we report the design and preparation of tungsten-doped cobalt phosphide nanoneedle arrays on conductive carbon cloth (W-CoP/CC) as highly efficient and stable HER and OER electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. The nanoneedle array provides enriched active sites and facilitates ion diffusion and the 3D conductive CC skeleton enables fast charge transport. Moreover, tungsten doping improves the water adsorption ability, optimizes the hydrogen adsorption energy, and increases the electrochemical active surface area thereby resulting in much improved HER and OER catalytic activity. The W-CoP/CC composite shows low overpotentials of 32 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte for HER and 77 and 252 mV in 1 M KOH solution for HER and OER, respectively, outperforming most previously reported metal phosphide electrocatalysts. The electrolyzer for overall water splitting with W-CoP/CC as both the anode and cathode achieves a stable current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.59 V with no obvious voltage change even after operation for 20 h. The results provide a new strategy to design and prepare high-performance non-noble metal phosphides for overall water splitting.									30	2	0	0	0	0	30			2196-0216			WOS:000501380700008

Here, we report a bimetallic selenide heterostructure (CoSe2/ZnSe) and the fundamental mechanism behind their superior electrochemical performance. The charge redistribution at the phase boundaries of CoSe2/ZnSe was experimentally and theoretically proven. Benefiting from the abundant phase boundaries, CoSe2/ZnSe exerts low Na+ adsorption energy and fast diffusion kinetics for sodium-ion batteries and high activity for oxygen evolution reaction. As expected, excellent sodium storage capability, specifically a superb cyclic stability of up to 800 cycles for the Na3V2(PO4)(3)parallel to CoZn-Se full cell, and efficient water oxidation with a small overpotential of 320 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) were obtained.

Mukherjee, Manabendra/C-1747-2016				Oxidation of Rubrene Thin Films: An Electronic Structure Study								LANGMUIR				30	51			15433	15441		10.1021/la503357t				DEC 30 2014	2014	The performances of organic semiconductor devices are crucially linked with their stability at the ambient atmosphere. The evolution of electronic structures of 20 nm thick rubrene films exposed to ambient environment with time has been studied by UV and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (UPS and XPS), near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT). XPS, NEXAFS data, and DFT calculated values suggest the formation of rubrene-epoxide and rubrene-endoperoxide through reaction of tetracene backbone with oxygen of ambient environment. Angle dependent XPS measurement indicates that the entire probed depth of the films reacts with oxygen by spending only about 120 min in ambient environment. The HOMO peak of pristine rubrene films almost disappears by exposure of 120 min to ambient environment. The evolution of the valence band (occupied states) and NEXAFS (unoccupied states) spectra indicates that the films become more insulating with exposure as the HOMO-LUMO gap increases on oxidation. Oxygen induced chemical reaction completely destroys the delocalized nature of the electron distribution in the tetracene backbone of rubrene. The results are relevant to the performance and reliability of rubrene based devices in the environment.									25	0	0	0	1	0	25			0743-7463			WOS:000347437800009	25383646

Due to the unique physical and chemical properties, borophene has various potential applications. In this review, we summarize the progress on borophene with a particular emphasis on the recent advances. First, we introduce the phases of borophene by experimental synthesis and theoretical predictions. Then, the physical and chemical properties, such as mechanical, thermal, electronic, optical and superconducting properties are summarized. We also discuss in detail the utilization of the borophene for wide ranges of potential application among the alkali metal ion batteries, Li-S batteries, hydrogen storage, supercapacitor, sensor and catalytic in hydrogen evolution, oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution, and CO2 electroreduction reaction. Finally, the challenges and outlooks in this promising field are featured on the basis of its current development.									134	7	1	0	9	0	136			2095-0462	2095-0470		WOS:000464849100001

Ion implantation is shown to be accompanied by changes in the space charge constituents and the emergence in the electrode surface layer of new active centers brought about mainly by radiation modification. The increase in the catalytic activity in the oxygen evolution reaction at doped electrodes is shown to correlate with a part of the surface charge.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1023-1935			WOS:A1996UW58200013

This impressive catalytic performance is believed to result from the exposure of the most active catalytic sites after an activation process, chemical or electrochemical, which leads to a Pt surface enrichment. A foremost importance is to understand the structure and the elemental distribution of Pt-Ni octahedral, which leads to an optimal catalytic activity and stability. However, the factors governing the synthesis of the Pt-Ni octahedra are not well understood. In this study, unprecedented surface atomic segregation of Pt atoms in a Ni-rich Pt-Ni octahedral nanoparticle structure is established by advanced electron microscopy. The Pt atoms are almost exclusively located on the edges of the Pt-Ni octahedra. This structure is formed in a pristine form, i.e., prior to any chemical or electrochemical etching. A new growth mechanism is revealed, which involves the transformation from an octahedron with a Pt-rich core to a Ni-rich octahedron with Pt-rich edges. This observation may pave the way for a deeper understanding of this class of Pt-Ni octahedral nanoparticles as an electrocatalyst.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0934-0866	1521-4117		WOS:000461878400005

Herein, we report a phosphate-based electrocatalyst [Fe3Co(PO4)(4)@reduced-graphene-oxide(rGO)] showing outstanding OER performance (much higher than state-of-the-art Ir/C catalysts), the design of which was aided by first-principles calculations. This electrocatalyst displays low overpotential (237 mV at high current density 100 mA cm(-2) in 1M KOH), high turnover frequency (TOF: 0.54 s(-1)), high Faradaic efficiency (98%), and long-term durability. Its remarkable performance is ascribed to the optimal free energy for OER at Fe sites and efficient mass/charge transfer. When a Fe3Co(PO4)(4)@rGO anodic electrode is integrated with a Pt/C cathodic electrode, the electrolyzer requires only 1.45 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) for whole water splitting in 1M KOH (1.39 V in 6 M KOH), which is much smaller than commercial Ir-C//Pt-C electrocatalysts. This cost-effective powerful oxygen production material with carbon-supporting substrates offers great promise for water splitting.									72	5	0	0	2	0	72			2041-1723			WOS:000496713200008	31729366

Nitrate salt of Ni and Fe and freshly extracted egg-white (Ovalbumin) were used as starting materials. X-ray diffraction (XRD) study of the material showed the formation of almost pure spinel phase having some small impurity. For electrochemical studies, materials, so obtained, were transferred in the form of oxide film electrode on Ni-support by oxide slurry painting technique. The voltammogram of each oxide electrode exhibited a pair of redox peaks (E degrees = 446 +/- 12 mV) prior to the OER. The anodic polarization study showed that Ni-substitution in the base oxide increased the electrocatalytic activity considerably and the value was found to be maximum with 0.5 mol Ni (j = 100 mA cm(-2) at E = 865 mV vs Hg/HgO/1M KOH) substitution. Tafel slope values were ranged between 65-102 mV decade(-1). Each oxide electrode showed almost first order kinetics with respect to [OH-] concentration. The polarization curve has also been recorded at different temperatures in 1 M KOH and with the help of the data obtained at different temperatures, activation energy and other thermodynamic parameters were estimated.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1452-3981			WOS:000366177700040
